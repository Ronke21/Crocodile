<text>James Hardie Industries plc is a global building materials company and the largest global manufacturer of fibre cement products. Headquartered in Ireland, it is cross-listed on the Australian and New York Stock Exchanges. Its management team currently sits in Chicago, Illinois, United States. James Hardie was plagued by several asbestos-related scandals in the 20th century.

== History ==
James Hardie (27 July 1851 – 20 November 1920) emigrated to Australia in 1888 from Linlithgow, Scotland, and established a business importing oils and animal hides. Andrew Reid, also from Linlithgow, came to join Hardie in Melbourne, and became a full partner in 1895. When Hardie retired in 1911, he sold his half of the business to Reid.

=== Listing on Sydney Stock Exchange and asbestos-containing products ===
The company was listed on the Sydney Stock Exchange in 1951. At the time, the company manufactured products out of asbestos cement sheet and other related building material. By the middle of the twentieth century, James Hardie had become the largest manufacturer and distributor of building products, insulation, pipes and brake linings containing asbestos. In Australia, it operated asbestos plants in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. Working with the products containing asbestos – including asbestos cement – caused people to develop various pleural abnormalities such as asbestosis and malignant mesothelioma. In 1961, it merged its brake lining division with Turner &amp; Newall&#x27;s Ferodo, taking a 60% shareholding in Hardie-Ferodo. It purchased the remaining 40% in August 1980.

=== Asbestos-free products ===
By the mid 1980s, James Hardie invented the modern day asbestos-free fibre cement material and had transitioned production entirely to fibre cement, a product consisting largely of Portland cement, sand, and wood fibres.

=== Relocations to the Netherlands, Ireland and the U.S. ===
In December 2001, the company relocated its headquarters to the Netherlands. While the move to the Netherlands resulted in tax savings of $86 million over seven years, in 2009 the Australian Taxation Office issued an amended assessment for $172 million plus interest and penalties. James Hardie successfully appealed the assessment. Also in 2009, the US Internal Revenue Service alleged that James Hardie had not been in compliance with the US-Dutch treaty since it had been implemented in 2006 and claimed $US37 million in unpaid taxes plus $US10 million in interest and penalties.

In 2010 James Hardie moved its corporate domicile to Ireland.

James Hardie currently operates a corporate office in Chicago, Illinois, United States and operates more than a dozen manufacturing plants around the world.

== Sponsorship and philanthropy ==
James Hardie was the naming rights sponsor of the Bathurst 500/1000 from 1968 until 1987. It was shirt sponsor for the Parramatta Eels from 1981 until 1995, and will sponsor them again in 2025.

In 1988 James Hardie Industries made the largest donation ever made to an Australian public library when it gifted to the State Library of Queensland the meticulously developed and hugely significant Australian Library of Fine Art which was given as a bicentennial gift to the nation. This collection became the James Hardie Library of Australian Fine Arts, and was part of the Arts and Rare Books Unit at the State Library.

== Asbestos ==
=== History ===
In 1978 the effects of pleural abnormalities and other asbestos-related diseases were beginning to show up in the former mine workers. While other companies were involved in similar asbestos-related activities, most notably CSR, more than 50% of claims made to the Dust Diseases Tribunal of New South Wales in 2002 were brought against companies in the James Hardie group.

There were protests against the companies&#x27; operations near the small Aboriginal Australian community of Baryulgil on the NSW North Coast, with Lyall Munro Snr and the NSW Aboriginal Legal Service taking an active part in actions against the company.

James Hardie and its subsidiaries had been providing compensation for victims of its operations since the 1980s. Though some earlier claims had arisen, the proliferation of cases from the 1980s onwards forced James Hardie to acknowledge that it had known asbestos to be dangerous. James Hardie nonetheless maintained that it had done everything possible to protect workers. In 1978 the company began putting warning labels on its products explaining that inhalation of the dust could result in cancer. In March 1987 James Hardie ceased all asbestos manufacturing activities.

As concern grew about the serious adverse health effects of asbestos, in the mid-1980s James Hardie developed an asbestos-free fibre cement technology, without the dangers associated with asbestos.

=== The MRCF and move to the Netherlands ===
James Hardie had been structured as a parent company operating through subsidiaries since the 1930s. All asbestos operations, including the provision of compensation, were undertaken by James Hardie&#x27;s subsidiaries, principally James Hardie and Coy and Hardie-Ferodo (later known as Jsekarb). Between 1995 and 2000, James Hardie (the parent company) began to remove the assets of these subsidiaries (since renamed Amaca and Amaba respectively), while leaving them with most of the asbestos liabilities of the James Hardie group.

In 2001 these two companies were separated from James Hardie and acquired by the Medical Research and Compensation Foundation (MRCF) which was essentially created in order to act as an administrator for Hardie&#x27;s asbestos liabilities. Then CEO of James Hardie, Peter McDonald, made public announcements emphasising that the MRCF had sufficient funds to meet all future claims and that James Hardie would not give it any further substantial funds. Indeed, the net assets of the MRCF were $293 million, mostly in real estate and loans, and exceeded the &#x27;best estimate&#x27; of $286 million in liabilities which had been estimated in an actuarial report commissioned by James Hardie. The Jackson Report found that this &#x27;best estimate&#x27; was &#x27;wildly optimistic&#x27; and the estimates of future liabilities was &#x27;far too low&#x27;.

After this separation, James Hardie moved offshore to the Netherlands for what it claimed were significant tax advantages for the company and its shareholders. To make this move, the company had to assure Australian courts (as it was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange) that the MRCF would be able to meet future liabilities. The courts were assured of this and that more money would be made available to its Australian asbestos victims through the issue of partly paid shares to MRCF obliging the new Dutch parent company to meet a call for funds if it were needed. The value of the call at the time was $1.9 billion. The move to the Netherlands therefore proceeded. However, the tax benefits which James Hardie expected to receive as a result from its move did not eventuate following the revision of tax laws in the United States in 2001 and later with the United States signing a new trade agreement with the Netherlands in 2006.

Shortly after the move, an actuarial report found that James Hardie asbestos liabilities were likely to reach $574 million. The MRCF sought extra funding from James Hardie and was offered $18 million in assets, an offer the MRCF rejected. The estimate of asbestos liabilities was promptly revised to $752 million in 2002 and then $1.58 billion in 2003. The funding shortfall became of increasing concern in 2004 as it became clear that eligible victims would miss out on receiving compensation after it was revealed that in March 2003 James Hardie had cancelled the partly paid shares that were intended to be a safety net for the fund. In discussing the shortfall with the MRCF, James Hardie refused to accept further responsibility for the liabilities on the basis that the MRCF and James Hardie were separate legal entities.

=== Inquiry ===
On 12 February 2004, a judicial inquiry into the matter was commissioned by the Government of New South Wales. The findings were very critical of James Hardie and its management. Amongst other findings, it found that the actuarial reports commissioned by James Hardie which estimated liabilities at $286 million were inadequate because they used a financial model which made unfounded predictions on the value of investments held by Amaca and Amaba, the figures were subject to numerous unspecified conditions and they did not account for the effect of separating Amaca and Amaba from James Hardie. However, the inquiry found that James Hardie was under no legal obligation to provide compensation. Despite this finding, there was immense political and social pressure on James Hardie to negotiate a compensation deal; governments were boycotting James Hardie products and unions were threatening to instigate a global union movement against the company based on refusing to handle James Hardie products.

Following the results of the inquiry, James Hardie entered into negotiations with governments and trade unions in an effort to establish some sort of compensation system for eligible victims of James Hardie&#x27;s products. In December 2004, James Hardie agreed to pay compensation to the victims of its products through a voluntary compensation fund. The details of the fund were to be legally determined by June 2005 but progress was stalled and the company refused to disclose the date the deal would be finalised. Further conflicts between the company and the federal government over tax deductibility of donations to the voluntary fund saw finalisation of the deal further delayed. It was not until November 2006, after the federal government had created &#x27;black hole&#x27; tax legislation, which made the contributions of James Hardie into the voluntary fund tax deductible, and had granted the voluntary fund tax-exempt status, that James Hardie finalised the compensation deal. There was immense pressure on the Federal Government from state governments, union leaders and victims to remove the tax problem. The final step in giving the voluntary fund a legal structure was approval of the scheme by James Hardie shareholders. In February 2007, 99.6% of shareholders voted in favour of the scheme and it began operating days later.

=== Legal action ===
After the inquiry in 2004, prosecutors were considering bringing civil and criminal charges against the CEO and other senior executives for making fraudulent statements as to the liquidity of the MRCF. In February 2007 every member of the 2001 board and some members of senior management were charged by the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) with a range of breaches of the Corporations Act 2001 including breach of director&#x27;s duties by failing to act with care and diligence.

ASIC also undertook investigations into possible criminal charges against the company&#x27;s executives but in September 2008 the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions decided there was insufficient evidence and charges were not pursued.

In 2009, the Supreme Court of New South Wales found that directors had misled the stock exchange in relation to James Hardie&#x27;s ability to fund claims. They were also banned from serving as board members for five years. Former chief executive Peter Macdonald was banned for 15 years and fined $350,000 for his role in forming the MRCF and publicising it. The former directors, excepting Macdonald, appealed and the New South Wales Court of Appeal subsequently overturned the ruling against these directors in 2010. ASIC appealed against the ruling in the High Court of Australia in October 2011. In May 2012 the High Court upheld the 2009 New South Wales court decision and found that seven former James Hardie non-executive directors did mislead the stock exchange over the asbestos victims compensation fund.

In August 2019, Mathew Werfel, a DIY handyman from Adelaide, won $3 million in a compensation case against James Hardie. Werfel was exposed to asbestos while pulling down fences and renovating two homes between 1990 and 2000, and was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2017. James Hardie&#x27;s products no longer contain asbestos, but Werfel&#x27;s lawyer claimed the company should have done more to alert the public to the existence of asbestos in its old products, which were used in older homes.

In 2021, James Hardie a New Zealand court dismissed a lawsuit claiming Harditex cladding caused weathertightness problems in New Zealand homes. The judge found that bad building methods rather than James Hardie products caused the problems.

<doc id="892159" wikidata="Q1265965" url="?curid=892159" title="Serendib scops owl">
<text>The Serendib scops owl (Otus thilohoffmanni) is the most recently discovered bird of Sri Lanka. It was originally located by its unfamiliar &quot;poo-ooo&quot; call in the Kitulgala rainforest by prominent Sri Lankan ornithologist Deepal Warakagoda. Six years later, it was finally seen by him on 23 January 2001 in Sinharaja, and formally described as a species new to science in 2004. Apart from Sinharaja and Kitulgala, it has also been found at Runakanda Reserve in Morapitiya and Eratna Gilimale. It is known as පඩුවන් බස්සා in Sinhala.

It is the first new bird to be discovered in Sri Lanka since 1868, when the Sri Lanka whistling thrush—then Ceylon whistling thrush—(&quot;Myophonus blighi&quot;) was discovered. It is also the 24th (according to some authorities the 27th) endemic bird species for Sri Lanka.

The habitat of the Serendib scops owl is in the southern rainforests of Sri Lanka. There is an altitudinal range from 30 to 50 metres. This owl has no competition from other nocturnal birds, as the territories are completely different. This species has a very small population: at the end of January 2006 only 80 of them were known to exist. The places that it is expected to be found are in five protected areas, like the Forest Reserve or the Proposed Reserve of Sri Lanka. They seem to be declining because of the loss of habitat and the degradation. The first two hours of darkness are when the owl hunts for its food.

This rare species inhabits the rainforests in the southwestern part of Sri Lanka. Like most owls, it is strictly nocturnal and hunts insects (e.g. beetles and moths) close to the ground. It begins calling at dusk, then its frequency rises again some two hours before dawn.

Unlike the other two species of scops owl in Sri Lanka, Indian scops owl (&quot;Otus bakkamoena&quot;) and oriental scops owl (&quot;Otus sunia&quot;), it does not have ear-tufts and its facial disc is only weakly defined. The general colour of this long, short-tailed owl is reddish-brown with paler underparts, spotted all over with fine black markings. The irides are tawny yellow (more orangish in male) and the feet are a pale fleshy colour. Tarsi are feathered for less than half their length. The claws and bill are a pale ivory colour.

==Taxonomic status==

In 2006 and 2007, two papers were published by Sri Lankan ornithologists in the publication &quot;Loris&quot; questioning whether the Serendib scops owl was a distinct species from other scops owl species found in India, and if so, whether it was actually a new discovery or a rediscovery.

The species has been subsequently recognized as a valid and distinct species by two of the authors who had earlier speculated on its “taxonomic uncertainty” in the papers mentioned above, in their following works.

*&quot;Birds of Sri Lanka: A Tally List&quot; (2009) by C. D. Kaluthota and S. W. Kotagama.
*&quot;An Illustrated Guide to the Birds of Sri Lanka&quot; (2010) by S. W. Kotagama and G. Ratnavira.

The question of ‘ear-tufts’ in this species, which has been misunderstood and led to questioning of its “taxonomic uncertainty” in the papers above, had already been dealt with at length in two articles at:

<text>Vladimir Lvovich Burtsev (; November 17, 1862August 21, 1942) was a revolutionary activist, scholar, publisher and editor of several Russian language periodicals. He became famous by exposing a great number of agents provocateurs, notably Yevno Azef in 1908. Because of his own revolutionary activities and his harsh criticism of the imperial regime, including personal criticism of emperor Nicholas II, he was imprisoned several times in various European countries. In the course of his life, Burtsev fought oppressive policies from Tsarism in Imperial Russia, followed by the Bolsheviks and later Adolf Hitler&#x27;s National Socialism.

== Early life (1862–1886)==
Burtsev was born in Fort-Aleksandrovsky, in the Transcaspian Oblast of the Russian Empire (present-day Kazakhstan) to a military family. In 1882, he was expelled from Saint Petersburg State University and in 1885 from Kazan State University for taking part in student disturbances. As a member of Narodnaya Volya, he was imprisoned for two years (for about a year in the Peter and Paul Fortress) and in 1886 exiled to the Irkutsk region of Eastern Siberia.

== Exile and publications (1888–1914) ==
In 1888 Burtsev managed to escape from exile and emigrate to Switzerland. In 1889 he co-founded magazine &quot;Svobodnaya Rossiya&quot; (Свободная Россия, &quot;A Free Russia&quot;) but it survived only three issues. &quot;In 1890 . . . Burtsev, wanted by the czarist police, boarded a British boat bound from Constantinople to London. When the ship found itself surrounded by Turkish police vessels with Russians on board, the captain refused their demand to hand over the fugitive, announcing: “This is English territory. And I am a gentleman!”

In 1898, Burtsev was arrested by British police for advocating, in his magazine &quot;Narodovolets&quot; (Народоволец, &quot;A Member of Narodnaya Volya&quot;), the assassination of Nicholas II. Burtsev was found guilty and sentenced to 18 months at hard labour. On his release he went on to publish it in Switzerland, resulting in his permanent ban from that country.

In London, he published the two-volume book &quot;Za Sto Let (1800–1896)&quot; (За сто лет (1800–1896), &quot;For Hundred Years (1800–1896)&quot;). He founded and published six issues of &quot;Byloye&quot; (Былое, &quot;The Past&quot;), a historical magazine. After the Russian Revolution of 1905 Burtsev briefly returned illegally to Russia and founded the Russian version of the &quot;Byloye&quot; magazine. Upon his return to the West in 1907, Burtsev began publishing the magazine &quot;Obshcheye Delo&quot; (Общее дело, &quot;Common Cause&quot;) which was a continuation of the foreign edition of &quot;Byloye&quot; beginning with the 7th issue.

By exposing numerous Tsarist agent provocateurs such as Yevno Azef, Burtsev gained fame as a counterintelligence expert and became known as &quot;the Sherlock Holmes of the Revolution&quot;.

== World War I and the Bolsheviks (1914–1921) ==
At the outset of World War I in 1914 he repatriated, was arrested at the border and again exiled to Siberia. Amnestied in 1915, he returned to Petrograd.

Burtsev strenuously opposed the Bolsheviks. In 1917 he accused Lenin and his comrades of being agents of Germany. In his article &quot;Either Us or the Germans and Those with Them&quot; (&quot;Russian Freedom&quot;, July 7, 1917), he listed the major enemies of Russia:
# Bolsheviks, whose demagoguery puts their own goals above the interests of Russia
# Reactionary forces
# German agents and spies. The Bolsheviks are, and always have been, the agents of Wilhelm II.

On the day of the October Revolution, he was arrested on orders of Leon Trotsky, which led some historians to count him as the first political prisoner in the USSR.

Despite their political differences and public disputes in the press, Maxim Gorky pleaded for Burtsev&#x27;s release and in February 1918 he was indeed freed and left Soviet Russia. Burtsev spent the rest of his life as an emigre, first in Finland, then Sweden and later in France. During the Russian Civil War, he supported the White Movement of Admiral Kolchak and General Anton Denikin.

His numerous attempts to bring all anti-Bolshevik forces together under one ideological umbrella did not succeed.

== Later life and death (1921–1942) ==
In 1921 Burtsev co-founded and became chairman of the Russian National Committee.

In 1930s, Burtsev fought against fascism and antisemitism. In 1934–1935 he was a witness in the Berne Trial, exposing the Okhrana&#x27;s role in creating the infamous fraud &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;. In 1938 in Paris he published a book &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Proven Forgery&quot;. Burtsev died in poverty in Paris in 1942 from a blood infection.

<text>In 1882, the French Third Republic established a protectorate over the Merina Kingdom on the island of Madagascar, with the consent of the United Kingdom. The French position on the island was solidified by the First Madagascar expedition (May 1883 to December 1885, the first phase of the Franco-Hova Wars). The protectorate lasted until 1897, when the French abolished the monarchy and turned the island into a colony, following the Second Madagascar expedition (December 1894 to September 1895, the second and last phase of the Franco-Hova Wars). Afterwards, Madagascar remained part of the French colonial empire until 1958, when the autonomous Malagasy Republic was established. The Republic gained full independence in 1960.

<doc id="892168" wikidata="Q3567106" url="?curid=892168" title="Weird NJ">
<text>Weird NJ (sometimes abbreviated WNJ) is a semi-annual magazine that chronicles local legends, purported hauntings, ghost stories, folklore, unusual places or events, and other peculiarities in New Jersey. The magazine originated in 1989 as a newsletter sent to friends by Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman, but as it grew in popularity, it became a public magazine published twice a year. It spawned a series of books called &quot;Weird US&quot;, which chronicle oddities from individual states in the United States aside from New Jersey, which in turn led to a television series that aired on the History Channel.

==History==
&quot;Weird NJ&quot; began in 1989 as a personal newsletter sent to friends by Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman. Gradually it evolved from a fanzine into a public magazine published twice a year in May and October. Abandoned places, eerie experiences, unique people, and strange landmarks were and still are common subjects for the magazine. Past issues have covered everything from the Jersey Devil and UFO sightings to abandoned Nike missile silos, the legend of the &quot;Hookerman&quot; Lights and the life of Zippy the Pinhead. Subjects covered include the Evil Clown of Middletown, Midgetville, &quot;Gates of Hell&quot;, Shades of Death Road, Clinton Road, Demon Alley, and the Devil&#x27;s Tower. The painting of a grinning face named Tillie from the Palace Amusements building in Asbury Park has appeared in several &quot;Weird NJ&quot; publications and on the magazine covers.

In 2003 a &quot;Weird NJ&quot; book, made up of content from earlier issues, was published. The next year saw the follow-up &quot;Weird US&quot;, covering sites and stories across the country. That led to a series of &quot;Weird US&quot; books for other states and areas, including Florida, Illinois, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Texas, California and New England, and a TV series, &quot;Weird U.S.&quot;, on the History Channel. The popularity of the magazine has inspired a community of fans of Moran and Sceurman&#x27;s work.

<text>Jeju City (; ) is the capital of the Jeju Province in South Korea and the largest city on Jeju Island. The city is served by Jeju International Airport (IATA code CJU).

Located on an island off the Korean Peninsula, Jeju has mild, warm weather during much of the year. The city is a well-known resort, with prestigious hotels and public casino facilities. In 2011, 9.9 million passengers flew between the two cities of Seoul and Jeju, making the Gimpo–Jeju route the world&#x27;s busiest passenger air route.

Jeju welcomes over ten million visitors every year, mainly from the South Korean mainland, Japan, and China. The population of Jeju City is 486,604 people and 225,139 households (244,468 men and 245,136 women, May 2024). The population density is 503.18 (per square km, 2020).

==History==
The area of the city has played a central role in Jeju since before recorded history. The Samseonghyeol, holes from which the three ancestors of the Jeju people are said to have come, are located in downtown Jeju City.

During the Japanese rule of Korea, Jeju was renamed to Saishū.

The city has grown quite rapidly since the 1970s. Shin Jeju (), or &quot;new Jeju&quot;, was created some decades ago, up the hill from the airport and houses many government buildings. The thatched roof buildings that were common throughout the city until the 1970s are gradually disappearing.

The city was separated from Bukjeju County in 1955. However, in 2005 Jeju Province voters approved a proposal to merge the city with Bukjeju County, also merging Seogwipo with Namjeju County to create two large cities directly administered by the province. That change was put into effect in July 2006.

In 2012 Sang-Oh Kim became mayor; he was formerly the Jeju regional president of National Agricultural Cooperative Federation.

==Transportation==
Jeju City is the principal transportation center for Jeju Province. It is home to the island&#x27;s sole airport, Jeju International Airport; the Jeju-Seoul route is the world&#x27;s busiest airline route.

In addition, its port is the largest on the island, serving the great majority of passenger and cargo vessels that visit the island. It also stands at the center of the island&#x27;s road network. To travel throughout the city and island, various buses are available. A bus ride from Jeju City to Seogwipo (the second largest city on the island) is typically an hour.

==Economy==
Due to its central position in transportation, Jeju City sees the main share of tourist traffic to the island. Many tourists arrive at the city through the port terminal or airport, stay in the tourist hotels of the Sinjeju neighborhood, and stay within the city to visit various Jeju tourist attractions. These include Dragon&#x27;s Head Rock () along the coast; the Samseonghyeol, three holes in the downtown area; Hallasan National Park in the interior; the country&#x27;s tallest mountain, Hallasan; and world&#x27;s largest botanical garden, Bunjae Artpia. The 8,500-seat Jeju Baseball Stadium is near the center of the city.

The city also sells many oranges for which Jeju is famous. Jeju City is surrounded by orange and mandarin farms.

Jeju Air has its headquarters in Jeju City.

==Geography==
In its former boundaries, Jeju City was 19.3 kilometers from east to west, and 10.2 kilometers from north to south. To the north, it looks across the Korea Strait at the southern coast of South Jeolla Province. To the south, it meets Seogwipo at the top of Hallasan, the island&#x27;s sole mountain.

== Tourism ==
The Jeju Olle Trail and Jeju Olle Walking Festival passes through the city.

The island Udo, one of Jeju&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions, is located off the city&#x27;s east coast. It received 2.23 million visitors in 2016. Seongsan Ilchulbong, an unusually bowl-shaped mountain, is popular for seeing the first sunrise of the year. Around that time, it hosts a sunrise festival with performances and food.

The city has Jeju Stone Park in Jocheon. The large park focuses on Jeju&#x27;s cultural use of stones, its mythology, and its shamanism. The Jeju National Museum is located in the city proper, near the center. The Kimnyoung Maze Park is in the city. The Buddhist temple Yakcheonsa has a natural mineral spring claimed to have healing powers, and is one of the largest temples in East Asia. It participates in the Templestay program, where guests can stay at Buddhist temples and experience Buddhist culture.

==Demographics==

==Climate==
Jeju City has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) with very warm summers and cool winters. In Holdridge classification, Jeju City has a warm temperate moist forest climate. Due to its location, Jeju City is one of the warmest cities in Korea. However, ocean effect snow brings winter precipitation such as snow showers with strong wind during the winter. Precipitation is significant throughout the year, but is much wetter in summer, with more than of rain falling in each month from June to September. The highest temperature ever recorded is on 25 July 1942 while the lowest temperature ever recorded is on 16 February 1977.

<doc id="892184" wikidata="Q841696" url="?curid=892184" title="Royal Mail Ship">
<text>Royal Mail Ship (sometimes Steam-ship or Steamer), usually seen in its abbreviated form RMS, is the ship prefix used for seagoing vessels that carry mail under contract to the British Royal Mail. The designation dates back to 1840. Any vessel designated as &quot;RMS&quot; has the right both to fly the pennant of the Royal Mail when sailing and to include the Royal Mail &quot;crown&quot; insignia with any identifying device and/or design for the ship.

It was used by many shipping lines, but is often associated in particular with the White Star Line, Cunard, Royal Mail Lines, Union-Castle Line, Canadian Pacific Line, Orient Line and the P&amp;OSNC, which held a number of high-profile mail contracts, and traditionally prefixed the names of many of their ships with the initials &quot;RMS&quot;.

While some lines in the past, particularly the Royal Mail Lines, called all their ships &quot;RMS&quot;, technically a ship would use the prefix only while contracted to carry mail, and would revert at other times to a standard designation such as &quot;SS&quot;.

==History==
Originally, the British Admiralty operated these ships.

The designation &quot;RMS&quot; has been used since 1840. In 1850 contracts were awarded to private companies. Having the title &quot;RMS&quot; was seen as a mark of quality and a competitive advantage, because the mail had to be on time.

The most valuable route, with the highest volume, was between Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire), in Ireland, and Holyhead in Wales. The City of Dublin Steam Packet Company (CDSPCo) won the contract. They bought RMS &quot;St Columba&quot; and RMS &quot;Llewellyn&quot; from the Admiralty to supplement their &quot;Prince Arthur&quot;. In the CDSPCo contract, in 1860, there was a penalty clause of £1 1s 4d for every minute&#x27;s delay.

The Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s trans-Pacific Royal Mail contract required the building of the first three of a fleet of steamships: the , and which regularly sailed between Vancouver and Asia beginning in 1891.
The RMS designation was also used on the ships of the White Star, P&amp;O and Cunard lines of the 19th and 20th centuries.
The most famous liner with the RMS title was the Titanic.

==Modern times==
In recent years the shift to air transport for mail has left only three ships with the right to the prefix or its variations: , which serves as a passenger vessel in Gravenhurst, Ontario, Canada; , which serves the Isles of Scilly; and . The &quot;RMS&quot; prefix was granted to QM2 by Royal Mail when she entered service in 2004 on the Southampton to New York route as a gesture to Cunard&#x27;s history.

The Royal Mail continues a form of this tradition on modern day airliners. The UK&#x27;s flag carrier airline, British Airways, is contracted to carry mail on some of its scheduled long-distance routes. Aircraft operating these routes with the facilities to carry mail are allowed to display the Royal Mail&#x27;s logo and crest on their fuselage, usually alongside their registration markings.

==Other designations==
The less-common designations RMMV for Royal Mail Motor Vessel and RMMS for Royal Mail Motor Ship, were used for a period when RMS was restricted to steam-ships. Motor Vessel and Motor Ship indicated that propulsion was provided by diesel rather than steam.

The carries the designation RMV for Royal Mail Vessel and is the only active RMV.

<doc id="892185" wikidata="Q3182082" url="?curid=892185" title="John Melendez">
<text>John Edward Melendez (born October 4, 1965), also known as Stuttering John, is an American entertainer.

He is best known for being a staff member and wackpacker on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; from 1988 to 2004. Initially working as an intern, Melendez became known for asking celebrities impertinent questions at events and press conferences with his stuttering. He left the show to become the announcer on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and also worked on Leno&#x27;s later shows. He presented &quot;The Stuttering John Podcast&quot; from 2018 to 2024.

==Early life==
Melendez grew up in Massapequa, New York, on Long Island and attended Plainedge High School. Melendez was born to a Puerto Rican father and a Danish mother. According to Melendez, he began to stutter when he was in the second grade as a result of psychological mistreatment from his father after he witnessed an argument between his parents. He attended Plainedge High School, graduating in 1983, where he was picked on by the neighborhood bullies because of his stuttering.
In 1988, Melendez attended New York University&#x27;s film school and belonged to a band called &quot;Rock Slide.&quot; His college roommate, comedian Mitch Fatel, was on the verge of quitting his internship with &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, when Melendez asked him for a recommendation for an internship there. The show&#x27;s producer, Gary Dell&#x27;Abate, mentioned Melendez&#x27;s stuttering to Howard Stern who, without seeing him and even before he was interviewed, told the producer to hire him.

==Career==

===1988–2004: &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;===
On Stern&#x27;s show, Melendez&#x27;s primary role was answering phones and screening listener calls before they were allowed on the air. At the time of his joining, in addition to being heard in the New York City and Philadelphia radio markets via Infinity Broadcasting Corporation-owned WXRK 92.3 K-Rock and WYSP Rock94, respectively, the nationally syndicated morning drive time show had just added Washington, D.C.&#x27;s WJFK (also owned by Infinity) as its third carrier.

Over time, Melendez became known for segments in which he asked celebrities confrontational questions at red carpet events, functions, promotional appearances, and press conferences. The puerile questions—written by Howard Stern, Fred Norris, and Jackie Martling—centered around a given celebrity&#x27;s private life and were premised on the idea that they would not want to look bad by refusing an interview from someone who stuttered. Melendez sported long hair and metal T-shirts, asking questions by reading them from a sheet of paper. As he became better known, he occasionally wore a disguise consisting of an overcoat, fedora, and fake mustache. His interviews were characterized by punchline-free &quot;joke&quot; questions, such as asking actress Melanie Griffith how her father, Andy, was.

The absurdity of the questions Melendez asked was often amplified by the fact that he himself appeared to lack common pop culture knowledge and often did not even seem to know who the subjects of his interview were or why they were famous. Melendez would thus frequently be unaware of why his questions would provoke such angry reactions, such as when he asked Ally Sheedy if she had vomited lately, unaware that the actress suffered from bulimia. Some celebrities were a personal target of Stern&#x27;s, such as Ted Williams, who was interviewed by Melendez because Stern disapproved of athletes charging money for autographs. Celebrities would often react angrily, but other times, they would take the questions in good humor.

Melendez notably interviewed Gennifer Flowers, Ringo Starr, and the Dalai Lama. At Gennifer Flowers&#x27; news conference playing the &#x27;Clinton Tapes&#x27;, he asked her if she planned to sleep with any other candidates before the election, to which she reacted by laughing. He asked the Dalai Lama if anyone ever greeted him with &quot;Hello Dalai!&quot;, in a joking reference to the play and movie; the Dalai Lama&#x27;s translator whispered the translation to the Dalai Lama, who chuckled. At a press conference, Melendez asked Ringo Starr, &quot;What did you do with the money?&quot; When Starr asked, &quot;What money?&quot; Melendez responded with &quot;The money your mother gave you for singing lessons!&quot; Starr good-naturedly replied, &quot;I spent it on fish and chips.&quot; Singer Debbie Gibson also went along with the joke when Melendez asked her about losing an award to Wilson Phillips, jokingly agreeing with his idea that &quot;the fat one would eat the statue.&quot; Melendez also provided comic interest with his misadventures, poor grammar, and sloppy pronunciation.

====National exposure====
Melendez started receiving U.S. national exposure in the early 1990s as Stern&#x27;s syndicated morning radio show acquired more markets (including Los Angeles and Cleveland) and particularly from June 1994 when its condensed version began airing nightly on E!: Entertainment Television, a basic cable network with national coverage in the United States. In 1994, Melendez signed a record contract with Atlantic Records and released his self-titled album with a music video broadcast on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. That year, he was being paid $20,000 annually by the Stern show, which had 15 million listeners.

During his 15-year run as Stern&#x27;s employee, Melendez also starred in the Off-Broadway show &quot;Tony n&#x27; Tina&#x27;s Wedding&quot; where he met his future wife, Suzanna. He appeared in such films as &quot;Airheads&quot;, &quot;Meet Wally Sparks&quot;, &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car?&quot;, and &quot;Osmosis Jones&quot;, as well as Howard Stern&#x27;s film &quot;Private Parts&quot;. He has also appeared on television in episodes of &quot;Wings&quot;, &quot;Baywatch Nights&quot;, and the 2003 United States version of the reality series &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!&quot;.

Melendez was also the protagonist of some of the show&#x27;s more outrageous moments. In 2001, during A.J. Benza&#x27;s appearance, Melendez got slapped in the face by Benza who did not appreciate the incessant lampooning of his failed late-night show, seeing Melendez as the main culprit. The on-air slap prompted an extended fracas and resulted in Benza being permanently banned from Stern&#x27;s show.

Throughout the early part of 2002, Melendez and WXRK afternoon deejay Lee Mroszak (aka &quot;Crazy Cabbie&quot;) had numerous on-air spats, which were used by Stern as fodder for multiple segments on the show. Their feud eventually culminated in a boxing match scheduled for Friday morning May 31, 2002, at Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and was promoted on the show as &quot;The Flunky versus the Junkie&quot; with 2,500 tickets going on sale for $100 each. The 7 a.m. fight, essentially an extended segment on the show which itself was broadcast from around the ring that morning, was set for five two-minute rounds with a two-minute break in between each round. It went the distance, with the 175 lb Melendez winning over the 262 lb Cabbie by unanimous decision.

Following a guest appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; to promote &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; in 2003, Melendez received an offer from Jay Leno to become the late-night show&#x27;s New York &#x27;correspondent&#x27; who would ask celebrities questions on the red carpet, similar to one of his roles on the Stern show. Melendez claimed that he turned down the offer because he could not get a private conversation with Stern to ask him about it. Stern later claimed how &quot;lame&quot; an idea it was for Leno to reuse Melendez the way Leno wanted to (in a less edgy way).

In parallel with his duties on the Stern show in the morning, Melendez got a daily afternoon show on New York City&#x27;s WXRK (&quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; flagship station) from noon to 1 pm called &quot;Out to Lunch&quot;, consisting mostly of taking musical requests by e-mail and playing them. The show was canceled on August 21, 2003, with Stern turning the announced cancellation into a 45-minute segment at the end of his live broadcast that day by having WXRK program director Robert Cross (aka Chuck Roast) come in and break the bad news on the air to Melendez.

====Leaving the show====
In February 2004, the &quot;New York Post&quot; revealed that Melendez had been offered the announcer position on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; while Stern&#x27;s show was on vacation. Many perceived the move as an attempt by Jay Leno to attract a younger demographic. Melendez&#x27;s offer, which was made without Stern&#x27;s knowledge, prompted a rift between Stern and Leno. Stern berated Leno on his show for weeks on end, with insults such as &quot;To an 18- to 25-year-old male, Jay Leno is gay. He might as well put a dress on,&quot; as well as accusations that Leno was &quot;ripping him off.&quot;

Following Melendez&#x27;s departure, Stern organized an on-air contest to find his replacement. Billed as &quot;Win John&#x27;s Job&quot; (much like &quot;Win Jackie&#x27;s Money&quot; after writer Jackie Martling walked out), the contest resulted in the hiring of Sal Governale (aka &quot;Sal the Stockbroker&quot;) and Richard Christy, although for several years, L.A. radio disc-jockey &quot;Scary Gary&quot; (from 97.1 KSLX, which played Stern&#x27;s radio show in Southern California) did Stuttering John style interviews that Stern would play on his show. Also, in his latter years on the Stern show, John had become too recognizable for the type of celebrity interviews for which he became niche-famous.

====2020–2022 publicity right lawsuit against Sirius XM====
In August 2020, Melendez sued the Liberty Media-majority-owned satellite and online radio platform Sirius XM Holdings Inc. for &quot;using his name, likeness, and voice without permission&quot; on its two channels dedicated to &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; and related content. Filed in the Manhattan-based U.S. district court, the complaint sought unspecified damages for Sirius XM&#x27;s airing of old recordings of Melendez from his time on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, with Melendez claiming such action violated California law and his right of publicity while further estimating that more than 13,000 hours of the then-syndicated morning radio show feature his voice, name and identity which Sirius XM benefits from by selling advertising without compensating him.

Melendez&#x27;s lawsuit was dismissed in June 2021 by the U.S. District Judge Paul A. Crotty who ruled that U.S. federal copyright law preempted Melendez&#x27;s claims that Sirius XM violated his publicity rights under California law. The judge&#x27;s written ruling further stated that Melendez did not show he was injured or that Sirius XM illegally used him to promote its services, adding that &quot;the commercial advantage Sirius XM gains from playing &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; archives and running the advertisements flows from the rebroadcasting of the copyrightable sound recordings themselves, not from Melendez&#x27;s identity”. Melendez&#x27;s lawyer commented that the judge “adopted a unique analytic framework which we believe is inconsistent with prevailing law&quot; while announcing the intention to appeal the ruling. The appeal was dismissed by a three-judge panel in October 2022.

===2004–2014: Jay Leno&#x27;s shows===

====&quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;====
Melendez debuted on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on March 29, 2004, taking over for Edd Hall. On the show, he was identified simply as &quot;John Melendez&quot; as opposed to &quot;Stuttering John.&quot;

In late September 2004, only six months after Melendez joined the show, NBC announced that Leno would be succeeded by Conan O&#x27;Brien in 2009. Throughout his 2004–2009 run on the &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, Melendez regularly appeared in the show&#x27;s comedy sketches and did correspondent pieces. By July 2008, Leno&#x27;s last &quot;Tonight Show&quot; was set for 29 May 2009.

In December 2008, with the end of Leno&#x27;s run on the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; nearing, NBC (led by the NBCUniversal president and CEO, Jeff Zucker) announced the launch of &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;, a new prime time 10 p.m. Monday-to-Friday talk show set to premiere in September 2009. With Leno&#x27;s final &quot;Tonight&quot; broadcast imminent, during spring 2009, Melendez was uncertain whether he&#x27;d have a place on Leno&#x27;s upcoming prime time show, stating in a May 2009 interview: &quot;After May 29 I get on my knees and pray and hope Jay brings me to the new show&quot;. Melendez&#x27;s ambiguous job status with Leno even prompted a sarcastic job offer from his former boss Stern. In late July 2009, Melendez was confirmed as a writer on upcoming &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;. Confirmation of his status on Leno&#x27;s new prime time show came later than that of Eubanks, weeks after the end of Leno&#x27;s tenure on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, which led to speculation that Melendez would not appear at all.

====&quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;====
In September 2009, Melendez reunited with Leno and former &quot;Tonight&quot; bandleader Kevin Eubanks as a member of the writing staff on &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;.

When asked about Melendez&#x27;s new role, Leno stated that Melendez would appear in comedy segments during the show and that the new show would not have a studio announcer (though Wally Wingert would later serve as show announcer). On &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Leno described his interplay with Melendez as &quot;awkward,&quot; saying &quot;I&#x27;d throw to Kevin Eubanks, and I&#x27;d throw to John, and I realized that my guy is Eubanks.&quot;

====Return of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;====
Just like previously on &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;, with the return of Leno&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in March 2010, Melendez continued in the writing role. Melendez did not return as an announcer on the second incarnation of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; (the job went to Wally Wingert), but instead was employed as a staff writer and occasional on-air segment host until Leno&#x27;s departure from &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on February 6, 2014.

===2014–present===
====&quot;The Stuttering John Podcast &quot;and Trump prank call====
In April 2018, he launched his new podcast, &quot;The Stuttering John Podcast&quot;. During Melendez&#x27;s podcast on June 28, 2018, he prank-called the White House by pretending to be an assistant to Senator from New Jersey, Bob Menendez. Melendez ultimately received a call back from President Donald Trump as he was traveling on Air Force One. Melendez then impersonated Senator Menendez and had a four-minute conversation focusing on immigration reform and the Supreme Court vacancy. Notably, President Trump was congratulatory regarding the outcome of Senator Menendez&#x27;s ethics lawsuit. The White House has confirmed the security breach.

On July 2, 2018, Melendez announced that he had retained lawyer Michael Avenatti to represent him in relation to the prank call after being visited by Secret Service agents over the previous weekend.

Melendez presented the final episode of &quot;The Stuttering John Podcast&quot; on 31 December 2024.

====Published work====
Melendez&#x27;s book &quot;Easy for You to Say&quot; was released in October 2018.

==Personal life==
After moving to California in 2004 to work on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Melendez lived in Calabasas with his wife Suzanna Keller and their three children. The couple filed for separation in October 2011 and divorced in 2012.

<doc id="892192" wikidata="Q41156" url="?curid=892192" title="Administrative divisions of South Korea">
<text>South Korea is made up of 22 first-tier administrative divisions: 6 metropolitan cities (&quot;gwangyeoksi&quot; ), 1 special city (&quot;teukbyeolsi&quot; ), 1 special self-governing city (&quot;teukbyeol-jachisi&quot; ), and 14 provinces (&quot;do&quot; ), including three special self-governing provinces (&quot;teukbyeol jachido&quot; ) and five claimed by the ROK government. These are further subdivided into a variety of smaller entities, including cities (&quot;si&quot; ), counties (&quot;gun&quot; ), districts (&quot;gu&quot; ), towns (&quot;eup&quot; ), townships (&quot;myeon&quot; ), neighborhoods (&quot;dong&quot; ) and villages (&quot;ri&quot; ).

== Local government ==
&quot;Official Revised Romanization of Korean spellings are used&quot;

== Provincial-level divisions ==

The top tier of administrative divisions are the provincial-level divisions, of which there are several types: provinces (including special self-governing provinces), metropolitan cities, special cities, and special self-governing cities. The governors of the provincial-level divisions are elected every four years.

== Municipal-level divisions ==
=== &quot;Si&quot; (city) ===

A &quot;si&quot; (, pronounced ) is one of the divisions of a province, along with &quot;gun&quot;. A city must have a neighborhood(&quot;dong&quot;) and can have towns(&quot;eup&quot;), townships(&quot;myeon&quot;) if the city is combined with urban and rural areas. Once an eup of a county (&quot;gun&quot;) attains a population of 50,000, the county can become a city. A city with a population of over 500,000 (such as Suwon, Cheongju, Cheonan and Jeonju) is considered as a specific city, which can set non-autonomous districts(&quot;gu&quot;). An administrative city does not have a city council and the mayor of the city is appointed by the provincial governor.

=== &quot;Gun&quot; (county) ===

A &quot;gun&quot; () is one of the divisions of a province (along with &quot;si&quot;), and of the metropolitan cities of Busan, Daegu, Incheon and Ulsan (along with &quot;gu&quot;). A &quot;gun&quot; has a population of less than 150,000 (more than that would make it a city or &quot;si&quot;), is less densely populated than a &quot;gu&quot;, and is more rural in character than either of the other 2 divisions. &quot;Gun&quot; are comparable to British non-metropolitan districts. Counties are divided into towns (&quot;eup&quot;) and townships (&quot;myeon&quot;). Specially, the size of a &quot;gun&quot; is less than a US &quot;county&quot;.

=== &quot;Gu&quot; (district) ===

A &quot;gu&quot; () is equivalent to &quot;district&quot; in the West. The metropolitan cities of Busan, Daegu, Incheon and Ulsan contain &quot;gun&quot; as well. &quot;Gu&quot; are similar to boroughs in some Western countries, and a &quot;gu&quot; office handles many of the functions that would be handled by the city in other jurisdictions. &quot;Gu&quot; are divided into neighborhoods (&quot;dong&quot;).

==Submunicipal level divisions==
=== &quot;Eup&quot; (town) ===

An &quot;eup&quot; () is similar to the unit of town. Along with &quot;myeon&quot;, an &quot;eup&quot; is one of the divisions of a county (&quot;gun&quot;), and of some cities (&quot;si&quot;) with a population of less than 500,000. The main town or towns in a county—or the secondary town or towns within a city&#x27;s territory—are designated as &quot;eup&quot;. Towns are subdivided into villages (&quot;ri&quot;). In order to form an &quot;eup&quot;, the minimum population required is 20,000.

=== &quot;Myeon&quot; (township) ===

A &quot;myeon&quot; () is one of the divisions – along with &quot;eup&quot; – of a county (&quot;gun&quot;) and some cities (&quot;si&quot;) of fewer than 500,000 population. &quot;Myeons&quot; have smaller populations than &quot;eups&quot; and represent the rural areas of a county or city. &quot;Myeons&quot; are subdivided into villages (&quot;ri&quot;). The minimum population limit is 6,000.

=== &quot;Dong&quot; (neighborhood) ===

A &quot;dong&quot; () is the primary division of districts (&quot;gu&quot;), and of those cities (&quot;si&quot;) which are not divided into districts. The &quot;dong&quot; is the smallest level of urban government to have its own office and staff. In some cases, a single legal &quot;dong&quot; is divided into several administrative &quot;dong&quot;. Administrative &quot;dong&quot; are usually distinguished from one another by number (as in the case of Myeongjang 1-dong and Myeongjang 2-dong). In such cases, each administrative &quot;dong&quot; has its own office and staff.

The primary division of a &quot;dong&quot; is the &quot;tong&quot; (), but divisions at this level and below are seldom used in daily life. Some populous &quot;dong&quot; are subdivided into &quot;ga&quot; (), which are not a separate level of government, but only exist for use in addresses. Many major thoroughfares in Seoul, Suwon, and other cities are also subdivided into &quot;ga&quot;.

=== &quot;Ri&quot; (village) ===

A &quot;ri&quot; () is the only division of towns (&quot;eup&quot;) and townships (&quot;myeon&quot;). The &quot;ri&quot; is the smallest level of rural government to contain any significant number of people.

== History ==
Although the details of local administration have changed over time, the basic outline of the current three-tiered system was implemented under the reign of Gojong in 1895. A similar system also remains in use in North Korea.

<text>The administrative divisions of [[North Korea]] are organized into three hierarchical levels. These divisions were created in 2002. Many of the units have equivalents in the system of South Korea. At the highest level are nine provinces and four special municipalities. The second-level divisions are cities, counties, and districts. These are further subdivided into third-level entities: towns, dongs (neighborhoods), ris (villages), and workers&#x27; districts.

The three-level administrative system used in North Korea was first inaugurated by Kim Il Sung in 1952, as part of a massive restructuring of local government. Previously, the country had used a multi-level system similar to that still used in South Korea.

(The English translations are not official, but approximations. Names are romanized according to the McCune-Reischauer system as officially used in North Korea; the editor was also guided by the spellings used on the 2003 National Geographic map of Korea).

==First-level divisions==

The nine provinces (&quot;to&quot;; ) derive from the traditional provinces of Korea, but have been further subdivided since the division of Korea. They are large areas including cities, rural and mountainous regions. The four special cities (&quot;t&#x27;ŭkpyŏlsi&quot;; ) are large metropolitan cities that have been separated from their former provinces to become first-level units. Four other cities have been directly governed in the past, but were subsequently reunited with their provinces or otherwise reorganized.

The three special administrative regions were all created in 2002 for the development of collaborative ventures with South Korea and other countries. One of them, the Sinuiju Special Administrative Region, was intended to draw Chinese investment and enterprise, but as of 2006 appears never to have been implemented. The special administrative regions do not have any known second- and third-level subdivisions.
==Second-level divisions==
:&quot;See List of second-level administrative divisions of North Korea for a complete list.

The most common second-level division is the county (&quot;kun&quot;; ), a less urbanized area within a province or directly governed city. The more populous districts within provinces are cities (&quot;si&quot;; ).

The city centers of the directly governed cities are organized into districts (&quot;kuyŏk&quot;, equivalent to South Korean &quot;gu&quot;).

==Third-level divisions==
Rural parts of cities and counties are organized into villages (&quot;ri&quot;, ). The downtown areas within cities are divided into neighborhoods (&quot;dong&quot;, ), and a populous part of a county forms a town (&quot;ŭp&quot;, ). Some counties also have workers&#x27; districts (&quot;rodongjagu&quot;, ).

<doc id="892195" wikidata="Q6715122" url="?curid=892195" title="MDA (TV series)">
<text>MDA is an Australian television series that aired between 2002 and 2005 on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). It concerned the day-to-day operation of legal firm MDA, which specialised in medical defence.

==Synopsis==
The title refers to the firm Medical Defence Australia, a team of lawyers and doctors who defend doctors charged with malpractice, ranging from Botox injections gone wrong to spinal cord injuries. The firm operates by collecting annual subscriptions from doctors, rather than on a case-by-case fee basis.

The main characters in the pilot episode included Dr Louella &quot;Ella&quot; Davis, the moral centre of the firm whose passion lies equally distributed between her work at St Albans Hospital Emergency Ward, and defending doctors; &quot;Happy&quot; Henderson, a lawyer whose nickname can be greatly misleading; Dr Jamie Lawless, an optimistic young doctor whose passion for helping others often leads him to inner conflict; Caitlin King, the new law recruit at MDA whose ambitions far exceed what she can do at the firm; Layla Young of the Bahá&#x27;í faith, the friendly receptionist; Dr Tony McKinnon, a doctor who works with Ella at the hospital; and Richard Savage – the cutthroat plaintiff&#x27;s advocate who often does battles with MDA.

&quot;MDA&quot; premiered in 2002 during a downturn in the making of Australian television. Despite critical acclaim and a number of awards, initially no renewal was made after the second season (2003). A year later, the ABC ordered another 12 episodes for 2005, but by this time several key actors had moved on. More multi-episode story arcs were used and critical response was lukewarm. Although sentiment eventually warmed, the series was not renewed after the third season.

===Season 1===
In the opening episodes, Ella faced personal problems when her lover Nick wished to move out of the country, and she often discussed these with her sister Edwina, but those characters quickly faded into the background. Edwina did return, for one episode, in the second season.

The first episodes did not draw impressive ratings, and the critics were ambivalent, but by the eighth episode – &quot;Bowels, Bosch and the Whole Damn Thing&quot;, in which Happy faced health problems – Jamie fell for Wendy Rossi, a doctor facing manslaughter, and Caitlin began to consider working with Richard instead of MDA – the show began to gain attention.

Other notable characters of the first season were Helena, a prosecutor whose lack of ability often led to comic relief moments; Claudia, Richard&#x27;s sardonic barrister; Giles, the amiable old barrister contracted to MDA; Dr Vince Phillips, a doctor on the MDA board whose desire to take over led to a legal battle; and Dr Mark Matthews, the head of the MDA board.

In the final episodes of the season, Ella and Tony became victims of a civil suit which led to them facing considerable press exposure. They were found not guilty, but in the final moments of the season finale, &quot;Divine intervention&quot;, angry plaintiff Debbie Shanahan drove her car directly at Jamie, Tony and Ella, and the audience was left to wonder who had survived.

===Season 2===
Although the ratings had been average, &quot;MDA&quot; was granted a second season.

The second season improved markedly from the first season, tightening storylines and scripts. The season opened with the episode &quot;Eternity&quot; in which Tony died on the operating table, and Caitlin moved to Richard Savage&#x27;s firm. Caitlin gets off to a bumpy start with the MDA when she becomes involved with Justin Harris (a man secretly under investigation for murder, played by Jeremy Callaghan). After Justin is cleared he feels that there is no trust in their relationship and leaves Caitlin.

Two new characters joined: Amanda McKay, a legal case manager; and Simon Lloyd, a doctor joining MDA. Amanda and Simon&#x27;s relationship evolves as a will-they-or-won&#x27;t-they? couple of the show, with the risk increased due to his wife who worked abroad. By season&#x27;s end they were a couple, but were still easing into it.

Significant season two storylines included the destruction of Jamie and Wendy&#x27;s relationship, Dr Phillips&#x27; increasing efforts to become head of MDA, and the potential destruction of MDA itself as he attempts to incite a revolution against the firm, Caitlin and Richard&#x27;s personal and professional fighting, Layla&#x27;s grandmother getting closer to death, and Happy dealing with his son Jason.

In the second half of the season, Caitlin was written out of the show, as the producers decided her character had run its course. Kerry Armstrong also decided to leave – because the low Government funding for the arts in Australia under the Howard conservative government (often criticised within the industry) meant that appearing on one television show was not a sustainable income. Ella, subsequently, took a full-time posting at St. Albans&#x27; as Head of Emergency and only appeared occasionally during the latter half of season 2, making her final appearance in the penultimate episode &quot;Pas de deux&quot;.

Despite increased audience size, critical response, and award nominations, the ABC made no official announcement of the show&#x27;s renewal. The final episode, &quot;Memento Mori&quot;, aired on 17 December 2003.

While it was no surprise that the ABC did not make an immediate announcement about the show&#x27;s fate – many Australian television series will often miss a year due to actor&#x27;s schedules and production demands – it was eight months before an announcement was made. During this time, Jason Donovan and Felix Nobis both moved on to other projects.

===Season 3===
In August 2004, the ABC finally announced its new commitment: a 12-episode order, which would air as three four-hour miniseries in 2005. While the order was small, the renewal meant that &quot;MDA&quot; was the only series to have started in 2002 which was still on the air as of 2005.

The third season began on 30 June 2005, and was greeted with lacklustre ratings, despite an impressive guest cast. Critical response, initially negative, warmed as the season progressed, to the point where it was largely positive.

* Episodes 1–4: &quot;Second chance.&quot; Facing a separation from his wife, Happy becomes enamored of a brilliant geneticist, Dr Robyn Masterson (Sigrid Thornton) whose controversial experiments are in danger of being shut down. While Happy&#x27;s personal feelings lead him to champion her cause, he begins to discover that all is not as it seems. Meanwhile, Amanda investigates a separate case regarding Dr Masterson&#x27;s lab assistant Julia (Anita Hegh); and Layla, Mark and Jamie fear for Happy&#x27;s wellbeing. Aaron Blabey also stars as Dr Masterson&#x27;s assistant. As incident after incident befalls Robyn&#x27;s team, she blames outside forces but some suspect that she herself isn&#x27;t being honest with MDA, and ultimately Happy is forced to make the choice between his relationship with Robyn and the good of the company. Nicholas Hammond also guest stars in this episode.
* Episodes 5–8: &quot;Departure lounge.&quot; With Jamie on holiday, MDA take on a temporary case manager, Dr Andrew Morello (Vince Colosimo), an anaesthetist with strong suspicions about the high rate of infant deaths at his hospital. So when he and Amanda assist Ted Walsh (Terry Brady), a prominent doctor with similar suspicions, Morello begins to investigate – which leads him to suspect prominent cardiologist Rupert Carr (Frank Gallacher). As Morello confides in Happy, he begins attempting to stop Carr&#x27;s practices without coming out and speaking his mind, which will ultimately result in the end of both their careers. When Andrew goes up on his own charges, Happy recalls Jamie back to MDA so that Andrew can be dismissed. As everyone including MDA turns against him, news about his wife Lucy (Jane Allsop) ultimately compels Andrew to make a final decision. Meanwhile, Amanda goes up against Gabrielle Bromley (Wendy Hughes), a fierce prosecuting attorney.
* Episodes 9–12: &quot;A human cost.&quot; Happy has a sudden angina attack, and while in an outer suburban hospital befriends intern Dr Liz Gibson (Lisa McCune). The next day, Gibson becomes the subject of a medical negligence writ. Concerned that her boss, Meg Morrison (Louise Siversen), and her nemesis, nurse Chloe Davis (Jacinta Stapleton) are teaming up against her, Liz seeks Happy&#x27;s assistance. Even though both Amanda and Liz herself have doubts about her competence, Happy stands by her. However, when Jamie and Layla discover just how understaffed and incompetently run Prospect Valley Hospital is, they realise that someone might be making Liz a scapegoat to cover up greater crimes. Elsewhere, Amanda goes up against a Health Review Board manager, David Simpson (Erik Thomson) in court, only to find herself in a passionate relationship with him outside of work. But when she learns that he may be behind the plot to convict Liz, Amanda is put into a devastating conflict of interest. Things come to a head when Liz and her boyfriend – fellow intern Dr Tim Whitney (Paul Bishop) – must both be protected against the schemes at the hospital, and as Happy fights with Amanda over the case, his health takes a serious turn for the worse.

<text>Live at the Astoria is a live concert video by the English rock group Radiohead, taken from their performance at the London Astoria on 27 May 1994. It features performances of songs from their first two albums, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995). It was released on VHS in 1995, with DVD and streaming releases in later years.

==Release==
&quot;Live at the Astoria&quot; was released on VHS on 13 March 1995, the same day as Radiohead&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Bends.&quot; A DVD release followed in 2005. On 28 May 2020, Radiohead added &quot;Live as the Astoria&quot; to YouTube.

<text>Portobello is a coastal suburb of Edinburgh in eastern central Scotland. It lies 3 miles (5 km) east of the city centre, facing the Firth of Forth, between the suburbs of Joppa and Craigentinny. Although historically it was a town in its own right, it is officially a residential suburb of Edinburgh. The promenade fronts onto a wide sandy beach.

==History==
===Early years===
The area was originally known as Figgate Muir, an expanse of moorland through which the Figgate Burn flowed, from Duddingston Loch fed by the Braid Burn to the west, to the sea, with a broad sandy beach on the Firth of Forth. The name &quot;Figgate&quot; has been thought to come from an Old English term for &quot;cow&#x27;s ditch&quot;, but the land was used as pasture for cattle by the monks of Holyrood Abbey and the name is more likely to mean &quot;cow road&quot;, as in Cowgate in Edinburgh. In 1650 it was the supposed scene of a secret meeting between Oliver Cromwell and Scottish leaders. A report from 1661 describes a race in which twelve browster-wives ran from the Burn (recorded as the Thicket Burn) to the top of Arthur&#x27;s Seat.

===1700s===
By the 18th century the area had become a haunt of seamen and smugglers. A cottage was built in 1742 on what is now the High Street (close to the junction with Brighton Place) by a seaman called George Hamilton, who had served under Admiral Edward Vernon in the capture of Porto Bello, Panama, in 1739, and he named the cottage Portobello Hut in honour of the victory. By 1753 there were other houses around it. The cottage remained intact until 1851, when it became a hostelry for travellers known as the Shepherd&#x27;s Ha.

In 1763 the lands known as the Figgate Whins were sold by Lord Milton to Baron Mure for about £1,500. They were afterwards feued out by the latter to William Jameson or Jamieson at the rate of £3 per acre. Jameson discovered a valuable bed of clay near the burn, and built a brick and tile works beside the stream. He later built an earthenware pottery factory, and the local population grew into a thriving village. Land values subsequently rose, and by the beginning of the 19th century some parts had been sold at a yearly feu duty of £40 per annum per acre.

An advertisement for bathing machines for hire on Portobello beach appeared in the &quot;Edinburgh Evening Courant&quot; of 11 June 1795, according to a report in the &quot;Evening Dispatch&quot;. It says the bathing machines have steady horses and careful drivers, and the bathing sands are perfectly free from stones and &quot;danders&quot;, the water clear and the beach very retired.

===1800s===
Portobello Sands were used at that time by the Edinburgh Light Horse for drill practice. Walter Scott was their quartermaster. While riding in a charge in 1802 he was kicked by a horse and confined to his lodgings for three days. While recovering he finished &quot;The Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot;. &quot;The Scots Magazine&quot; in 1806 noted that the lands were &quot;a perfect waste covered almost entirely with whins or furze&quot;. Portobello grew into a bathing resort, and in 1807 new salt-water baths at the foot of Bath Street and Regent Street were erected at a cost of £5,000. In 1822, a visit of King George IV to Scotland organised by Scott included a review of troops and Highlanders held on the sands, with spectators crowding the dunes.
Before Portobello had a promenade and public beach, there was only a belt of dry sand between the firmer sand of the beach and the private properties adjoining the shore. Access to the beach was restricted by these property holders, as Sir William Rae discovered in 1842 when he tried to gain access to his favourite section for bathing. The proprietor of a villa adjoining the shore had extended his garden to include the sand and had built a wall leading right down to the sea. Sir William, a former Lord Advocate, viewed this as interfering with his right of way, as a private citizen and as an officer of the Crown. After legal action over several years and an appeal right up to the House of Lords, the proprietor and his neighbours were forced in July 1849 to demolish the walls they had erected. Fifteen years later, Portobello Town Council began to build the Promenade, so securing public access to the beach along its .

Portobello became industrialized in the 19th century, manufacturing bricks (&quot;Portobello brick&quot;), glass, lead, paper, pottery, soap and mustard. Joppa to the east was important as a salt producer.

In 1833 the town was made a burgh, and jointly with Leith and Musselburgh, it was represented by one member of Parliament. Then in 1896 Portobello was incorporated into Edinburgh by Act of Parliament. The Scotsman in 1912 noted that &quot;It was by the provisions of the Edinburgh Extension Act of 1895 under which Portobello was amalgamated with the city, that Edinburgh gave an undertaking to build and maintain the town hall in Portobello, and in February of this year the Corporation decided to implement the bargain&quot;. A formidable red-brick power station was built in 1923 at the west end of the beach. It was extended by Ebenezer James MacRae in 1938, and operated until 1977 when it was closed. It was demolished in the following 18 months.

Between 1846 and 1964 a railway station provided access for visitors to the resort, whose facilities came to include a large open-air swimming pool, heated by waste from the power station. The actor Sean Connery once worked there as a lifeguard. The pool was closed in 1979. There was also a lido (now demolished) and a permanent funfair, which closed in 2007 and was also eventually demolished to make way for new housing.

===1900s===
Portobello Baths were constructed in 1898 and completed in 1901 on The Promenade overlooking the beach. These, now known as Portobello Swim Centre, include one of only three remaining public Turkish baths in Scotland.

Portobello Pier was a pleasure pier near the end of Bath Street, open from 23 May 1871 until the start of the First World War. At 1,250 feet (381 m) long with a restaurant and observatory at the end, it cost £7,000 to build to a design by Sir Thomas Bouch, who was infamously linked to the Tay Bridge disaster. The iron supports rusted away and the pier was demolished as uneconomic to repair in 1917.

The Edinburgh Marine Gardens laid out north of Kings Road in 1908–1909 included an open-air theatre, an industrial hall, a ballroom (later a skating rink), a scenic railway, a &quot;rustic mill and water-wheel&quot; and a speedway track. It fell out of use in the First World War and never recovered, although the speedway/motor cycle track remained in use until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. The site was cleared in 1966 for the Lothian Buses Marine bus depot.

The 1983 Portobello was at the centre of police and media attention with the abduction of five-year-old Caroline Hogg from the Promenade area and her murder by Robert Black.

Portobello&#x27;s peak as a resort in the late 19th century gave way to slow decline through the 20th century. Whilst visitors were mainly from Edinburgh, it was also once popular with Glaswegians, particularly as the Glasgow Fair &quot;trade holiday&quot; signalled the start of a two-week holiday for the west of Scotland. By the 1960s, it had become an area of amusement arcades and permanent funfair attractions. From the 1980s these gradually disappeared, and by the end of the 20th century the Promenade had hardly any attractions specific to a seaside location, although the Tower Amusements arcade remains in business.

===2000s===
The 21st century has seen the emergence of community activities, some focused on the Promenade. The beach hosts regular beach volleyball, including Olympic beach-volleyball qualifiers, and the annual Big Beach Busk event. Other community activities focus more on the sea. They include the Portobello, Sailing, Kayaking and Rowing Club, Rowporty, and Eastern Amateur Coastal Rowing Club. Others concern community gardens, a monthly local food market, a youth theatre (now using a new web address), and culture and music. Artistic activity has become popular, including the annual Art Walk Porty. In April 2020 the Portobello Pencil Sharpening Project, thought to be an art installation, went viral on Twitter.

In 2019 Portobello was voted the best neighbourhood in the UK at the 2020 Urbanism Awards. In 2021 it was considered by a Sunday Times panel to be one of the top eight places to live in Scotland.

The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) classed the quality of the swimming water as &quot;sufficient&quot; in its 2019 survey, a small improvement on the previous year, when dolphins were sighted off the coast. In 2020 there was a sighting of what was thought to be a swordfish. A wild swimmers&#x27; club has been braving the waves through the year since 2010. Meanwhile, a warmer alternative is provided by the Turkish Baths in Portobello Swim Centre.

In October 2016 Portobello became the first urban community in Scotland to register a Community Right to Buy after the 2016 expansion of Land reform in Scotland to cover urban areas. Purchase of Bellfield Old Parish Church and Halls by Action Porty for £600,000 was confirmed by Scottish Government Ministers on 3 May 2017. The purchase was funded partly by the Scottish Land Fund and partly by community donations and borrowing. The buildings and grounds formally passed from the Church of Scotland to Action Porty on 6 September 2017 and opened as Bellfield (Community Centre), Portobello on 23 June 2018.

Work in 2019 on re-laying the paving setts in Brighton Place caused controversy over the cost and duration: the main road was closed to traffic until the end of 2019 while the work was done. Ultimately, the new surface proved of high quality, including smooth sets for cycling and a refuge for safe turning into the Christian Path. The final cost of about £750,000 was less than predicted. Minor problems remaining with drainage were to be dealt with when the spring 2020 lockdown was lifted.

During the 2020 Coronavirus Lockdown, police praised the public for curbing the spread of the virus by avoiding Portobello over Easter weekend, although as the weather improved in May the visitor numbers increased, causing concern to politicians. Portobello continued busy over the summer of 2020, with some disturbances reported. In August a Ferris wheel appeared on the old Fun City site, but its licence was suspended before it opened, as it broke government rules on the reopening of funfairs; despite this, some smaller attractions in the area have come and gone since. Concerns about overcrowding on Portobello promenade continued into 2021.

In September 2021, it was announced that the Swim Centre would shortly close for a £2.5 million refurbishment.

==Demographics==

==Transport==
===Buses===
Portobello is served by Lothian Buses which provide eleven services to the area, continuing towards Joppa and Eastfield to Musselburgh, Port Seton, Tranent or North Berwick, down Brighton Place to Fort Kinnaird or Royal Infirmary, and from Kings Road to Craigentinny. The former electric tramways operated by Edinburgh Corporation Transport Department were replaced by diesel buses in November 1956.

===Railway===
Portobello&#x27;s first railway station was initially served by the Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway. The Portobello (E&amp;DR) railway station operated from 1832 until 1846, when it was replaced by the Portobello (NBR) railway station operated by the North British Railway. The station closed in 1964 under the Beeching cuts.

===Hovercraft===
For two weeks in 2007 there was an experimental hovercraft service to Kirkcaldy in Fife. Stagecoach was interested in running a regular service, but the local authority refused planning permission for the infrastructure. Stagecoach planned to use a terminal to be built in Leith using public funds, which failed to materialise.

==Sport==
The Promenade and beach host two annual running races: Portobello Beach Race every summer since 2013, and the Promathom most New Year&#x27;s Days since 1987. A weekly Park Run every Saturday in Figgate Park provoked press-reported controversy and exhibitionism in 2018.

==Town halls==

As an independent burgh, Portobello had aspirations for a town hall, the town council having first met in rooms in Brighton Place and then in Rosefield House. The first purpose-built hall (now the Baptist Church in the High Street) was designed by David Bryce and erected in 1862. This proved inadequate for the purpose and was replaced in 1877 by a building designed by Robert Paterson, which is now Portobello Police Station.

The Edinburgh Extension Act 1895, which amalgamated Portobello with Edinburgh, gave effect to a number of undertakings, including extension of the Promenade, building of the Baths, surfacing various streets, providing drainage, extending the trams, providing a public park and a new town hall for public meetings. The new Portobello Town Hall was intended to hold at least 800 people and was built on the site of Inverey House to a design by the City Architect, James A. Williamson, opening in 1914.

In June 2019, the town hall was closed by the city council after the masonry and plasterwork were found to be in poor condition. The city council put the building on the market for lease in February 2020, and, following a competitive process, it agreed to enter into exclusive talks with a local community organisation known as Portobello Central in May 2021. The city council confirmed, in June 2021, that it had allocated £350,000 of capital investment to the town hall project, money provided by the Scottish Government under its Place Based Investment Programme. Portobello Central indicated that it hoped the funding would enable it to re-open the building by April 2022. The Town Hall opened for business on 1 June 2023, under a 25-year, full repairing lease from the City of Edinburgh Council at £1 per year rent.

It received full independent parish status in 1861.

The church hall, built in 1964, stands on the former graveyard, but several stones survive, for instance in the narrow gap behind the back of the hall and the boundary.

In 2017 the church was sold by the Church of Scotland to the local community and reopened in 2018 as Bellfield community centre.

<text>William Curtis (11 January 1746 – 7 July 1799) was an English botanist and entomologist, who was born at Alton, Hampshire, site of the Curtis Museum.

Curtis began as an apothecary, before turning his attention to botany and other natural history. The publications he prepared reached a wider audience than early works on the subject had intended. At the age of 25 he produced &quot;Instructions for collecting and preserving insects; particularly moths and butterflies&quot;.

Curtis was demonstrator of plants and Praefectus Horti at the Chelsea Physic Garden from 1771 to 1777. He established his own London Botanic Garden at Lambeth in 1779, moving to Brompton in 1789. He published &quot;Flora Londinensis&quot; (6 volumes, 1777–1798), a pioneering work in that it devoted itself to urban nature. Financial success was not found, but he went on the publish &quot;The Botanical Magazine&quot; in 1787, a work that would also feature hand coloured plates by artists such as James Sowerby and Sydenham Edwards. (William Kilburn is often erroneously cited as having contributed plates to &quot;Curtis&#x27;s Botanical Magazine&quot;. Though he did provide illustrations to &quot;Flora Londinensis&quot;, his association with Curtis seems to have ended by 1777, 10 years before the first publication of the &quot;Botanical Magazine&quot;)

Curtis was to gain wealth from the ventures into publishing, short sales on &quot;Londinensis&quot; were offset by over 3,000 copies of the magazine. Curtis said they had each brought &#x27;pudding or praise&#x27;.

Curtis might be the editor of an exsiccata-like series &quot;Hortus siccus gramineus&quot;, followed up by the series &quot;Hortus siccus gramineus or a collection of dried specimens of British grasses with their Latin and English names...&quot; (1802-1806), distributed by William Salisbury.

The genus &quot;Curtisia&quot; is named in his honour. His publication was continued as the esteemed botanical publication, &quot;Curtis&#x27;s Botanical Magazine&quot;. The noted natural history illustrators, James Sowerby and Sydenham Edwards both found a start with the eminent magazine.

He was buried in the churchyard at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Battersea at a location he chose himself, where he is commemorated in a stained glass window, as many of his samples were collected from the churchyard there. His headstone, now only partially remaining, had the epitaph:

While living herbs shall spring profusely wild, 
Or gardens cherish all that&#x27;s blithe and gay,&lt;br&gt;
So long thy works shall please, dear Nature&#x27;s child,&lt;br&gt;
So long thy mem&#x27;ry suffer no decay.
The epitaph, although lost from the grave is included in the stained glass window by John Hayward. The window design includes a chaplet of flowers from Curtis&#x27;s Flora Londinensis.

This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Curtis when citing a botanical name.

<text>Zumaia (, ) is a small town in the north of Spain in the Basque Country.

The town has two beaches (Itzurun and Santiago), which are of interest to geologists because they are situated among the longest set of continuous rock strata in the world. These formations are termed flysch and they date from the mid-cretaceous period to the present, a time period of over 100 million years. The K–T boundary is present at the Itzurun beach, and fossils can be found, notably of ammonites. The strata stretches along a distance of about 8 km, between the beaches of Deba and Getaria, with Zumaia lying in the middle.

The town is also the home-turned-museum of the painter Ignacio Zuloaga. Exhibits include works by El Greco, Rivera, Zurbarán and Goya. Across the street there is a museum of craft and hand-crafted products of Laia. Within the city centre, the Basque-style Gothic church of San Pedro can be found. It has a temple with a magnificent reredos by Juan de Antxieta, the only work by this Basque sculptor found in Gipuzkoa.

Zumaia is located at the point where the Urola and Narrondo rivers come together. The origins of the town can be traced by its ancient monastery. In the Middle Ages, the people who lived in the Sehatz valley having to endure the continuous attacks of pirates and pillagers, fortified the city. The church today retains the relic of its defensive appearance.

==Etymology==
It has been widely theorized that Zumaia&#x27;s name comes from &quot;zuma&quot; or &quot;zume&quot;, the Basque word for the wicker, a plant that apparently was plentiful on the area. With regards to Villagrana, there is a theory that states the possibility to be related with &quot;grana&quot;, meaning &quot;seeding&quot;, that were produced by the abundant groves of evergreen oaks in that period.

==History==
===Founding===
Despite the disagreements in certain aspects with regards to the origins of Zumaia, all historians agree that the villa emerged surrounding the Monastery of Santa Maria. According to the first preserved parchment in which is mentioned the place &quot;Zumaya&quot;, the Monastery of Santa Maria had been a donation by a privilege of Sancho VI of Navarre to the Roncesvalles&#x27;s convent in 1292.

Despite the different conclusions about the emplacement of the monastery, the monks of the Monastery of Santa Maria the direct witnesses of the birth of this villa, after the inhabitants dispersed by the valley of Sehatz decided to put an end to the continuous assaults of piracy and plunder and raise a villa walled and strengthened from where they could defend in group against the enemy. Due to its extent, its strategic location and its direct contact with the sea, the chosen place was Zumaia. Nevertheless, the villa was not constituted juridically until 1347, when Alfonso XI of Castile provided the municipal charter to its citizens of &quot;Villagrana de Zumaya&#x27;s Villa&quot;, to which was granted the Jurisdiction of San Sebastián.

In the 16th century, Zumaia relied on 136 houses, 70 of them distributed among six streets that existed inside the wall, and the remaining ones dispersed by three neighborhoods that were staying out of the wall. In total there were 108 neighborhood surnames, 53 of them with the qualification of nobility. Nowadays there is no evidence of the fortification that only was interrupted at a height of solar houses and towers that could play the same function of defending as the wall. The entrance halls included the Principal Entrance Hall of the villa and the great cross that presided over them. They were destroyed in the middle of the 18th century to clear the surroundings of the town. The only natural door was the one of the bar of the sea, which was apparently the most dangerous for being the most accessible.

Since the 16th century the bells of the parish have been melted many times. In 1578 the mayor ordered to ring them three times consecutively so that citizens were well-informed and came more assiduously to the meetings of the regiment, which was retired long time ago. Moreover, on the eve of the General Meetings—that were celebrated in the villa every 18 years, to offer fuel-wood and coal to the secretary of the province—two oaks were cut. In one of these sessions, on 27 December 1620, the same day in which Ignatius of Loyola, Patron Saint of Gipuzkoa was chosen, the patron saint of the town was named as the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary.

===Economic changes and development===
With the pass of centuries, has brought logically many changes not only in the former ordinances municipal written in 1584, but also in the urban development as well as in the customs and way of living of citizens. However, the best keys to notice the development of the villa from its foundation to the present day, is the economic predominant activity of every epoch. The majority of the first inhabitants of the villa were devoted to agriculture, though grouping in the same place accelerated the appearance of some professional and industrial activities. By the end of the 14th century, ships were constructed in the river. A high percentage of the population was devoted to fishing and navigation. The river was then very rich and many species could be fished, among them salmon, trout, shellfish and eels. Many were reconciling the coastal fishing with agriculture. By then, the manufacturing of cement had also become a relevant activity, for which they were taking advantage of the matters of tertiary areas of the surroundings. From the port they were departing goods towards the Netherlands as well as manufactured products were imported. Some historians even claim that the passenger liner that was joining the villa with the hermitage of Santiago – habitual accommodation of the pilgrims who were going towards Santiago de Compostela, were also among the most prominent sources of Zumaia&#x27;s revenue in the 16th century.

The following centuries, 17th century and the 18th century, were not brilliant periods at all. The land continued being the principal economic activity of the neighbors, in spite of the fact that Zumaia continued having many deficits in agriculture, especially in the production of wheat, corn and beans; until that in 1766 all the houses were recognized to verify if any neighbor possessed more grain than the necessary for their maintenance. There were also citizens dedicated to both maritime and terrestrial transport of goods, mainly iron, and the fishing activity was maintained and even increased, since in 1610 was created the Cofradía de Mareantes de San Telmo, meaning the Confraternity of the Seagoing of San Telmo.

It was in this period when there was emphasized the emigration begun at the end of the 16th century (in 1616 Zumaia embraced 935 inhabitants) and it did not stop until two centuries later with the economic reappearance.

The situation began to improve very quickly in the 17th century, among other reasons because the desiccation of the marshes enabled the cultivation of the former reed-beds and, consequently, the increase of the agricultural production, especially if corn. But there were some other factors that lead this reappearance, since in the 19th century the factories of cement turned into the engine of the economy of the villa, promoting the commercial activity of the port. The terrestrial transport also improved in this period of time, since between the year 1882 and 1885 a road that joined Zumaia with Getaria was created, which was already communicated with San Sebastián, in 1900 appeared a train that would join Zumaia with Zarautz, and in 1926 the railroad of the Urola was inaugurated, which nowadays is already removed. The improvement of the communications, nevertheless, harmed to the port of Bedua, whose commercial activity started to expire due to the fact that the bridge of Urola river was blocking the way to the ships upstream.

The industry of the cement began to decline at the beginning of the 20th century, at the same time as the naval industry started to arise again strongly, and soon later also the industry of the engine. An interesting fact that took place in Zumaia is that the first diesel engine of the whole Spanish State was set here, precisely in the enterprise Yeregui Hermanos. This industrial rise brought about logically a considerable increase of the population, mainly due to the immigration.

The percentages of the different activities that were stimulating the economy of Zumaia had considerably changed by the beginning of the 20th century. In 1950, the 56.1% of the population worked in the industrial sector, while only the 17% dedicated to agriculture. Some years later, the economic crisis also came to Zumaia, sharpened by moments with readjustment of personnel and even with the closing of some big workshops that had been emblematic until then. Today, fifty years later, several more modest companies have been created, which are also more chords with the new economic trends of the market.

==Cuisine==
===Octopus===
The octopus and Zumaia have been together since the early days of the creation of the town. There has been a special relation between this animal and the town in which other towns, in Getaria, Zarautz or Deba (which they are 5, 10 and 16 km from Zumaia), has never occurred. The tradition of catching octopuses on the coastline of Zumaia has been very typical, and the octopus has become the essence of the culture and tradition of the town.

There are three main places in Zumaia where people catch octopuses: The rocks of Itzurun beach, Inpernupe, and the coastline between Zumaia and Deba. The ideal moment is when the tide is not high. There have to be visible rocks to catch them, since the octopuses are hidden in the holes which the rocks usually have. So, the more rocks are visible, the more chances are to catch them. The hunt requires a fish hook to grab the octopus. But, there are different techniques, and they change according to the place:

*Looking the remains of crabs and other small sea animals in the entrance of the holes (so, there is a signal that the octopus is inside that hole) and catching them with a hook.

*Using a stick covered with bait to attract octopuses and, when they are visible, which they do not leave the hole if there is no bait, grab them with the hook.

Fishing octopuses has been a tradition in Zumaia. But, not all the people can catch them easily. There are some families where the tradition is strong. Some individuals had caught 100 in a day. But, they were other times, when there were many more octopuses than nowadays. The pollution, the fishing vessels and the non-limit octopus fishing years have been very prejudicial to the coastline. Because of this, the government has regulated the amount that one individual can catch (one octopus and heavier than 750 g).

Every year when there are big tides a lot of people usually go the coastline to fish for octopus, and as some of them are experienced, they fish more than 20 octopuses on a day. Nowadays, it is illegal to fish more than one per day, but some people (specially the old people who have been fishing all their lives) still fish a lot of them. The octopus cannot be eaten after it is fished. It has to be treated, but there are different ways to treat it. And, the way it is cooked depends on who it is treated after fishing it.

Fresh octopus meat is gristly, so it has to be frozen for at least a week to tenderize.

If the octopus is fresh, and it is tenderized after a lot of hits, it is cooked with tomatoes, &quot;a la gallega&quot; or with peppers and onion. But, those cooking recipes are very common in other places like Asturias or Galicia, where there are traditions of fishing and cooking octopuses. It was and still is common to cook in those ways. But, there is a recipe, which it needs dry octopus, that it is exclusively from Zumaia. In other towns near Zumaia there is not this tradition.

====Drying====
Drying octopuses is a typical tradition in Zumaia despite it being an uncommon practice on coastal populations. It consists of cleaning the octopus once dead, leaving it to dry in a bucket for 3 to 5 days and putting it in a stick for 7 to 8 days. Up to 80% of the original weight might be lost, and the result emits a strong odor.

==IUGS geological heritage site==
In respect of the site being &#x27;one of the best exposed, most continuous and highly studied outcrops of deep marine sediments in the world&#x27; the &#x27;Cretaceous-Paleogene Stratigraphic Section of Zumaia&#x27; was included by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in its assemblage of 100 &#x27;geological heritage sites&#x27; around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an &#x27;IUGS Geological Heritage Site&#x27; as &#x27;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.&#x27;

<doc id="892211" wikidata="Q3228351" url="?curid=892211" title="Zen in the Art of Archery">
<text>Zen in the Art of Archery (Zen in der Kunst des Bogenschießens) is a book by German philosophy professor Eugen Herrigel, published in 1948, about his experiences studying Kyūdō, a form of Japanese archery, when he lived in Japan in the 1920s. It is credited with introducing Zen to Western audiences in the late 1940s and 1950s.

==Origin==
Herrigel (1884–1955) was a German professor of philosophy, with a special interest in mysticism. From 1924 to 1929 he taught philosophy in Japan, and studied Kyūdō (the art of the Japanese bow) under a master named Awa Kenzô. Awa taught kyūdō in a way that was regarded by some as a mystical religion, called &quot;Daishadokyo&quot;. Daishadokyo was an approach to kyūdō that placed great emphasis on the spiritual aspect and differed from much of the mainstream practice at the time. In 1936, Herrigel wrote a 20-page essay about his experiences, and then in 1948 expanded the essay into a short book. The book was translated into English in 1953 and Japanese in 1955.

==Book==
The book sets forth theories about motor learning. Herrigel has an accepting spirit towards unconscious control of outer activity that Westerners heretofore considered to be wholly under conscious control. For example, a central idea in the book is how, through years of practice, a physical activity becomes effortless both mentally and physically, as if our physical memory (known today as &quot;muscle memory&quot;) executes complex and difficult movements without conscious control from the mind.

Herrigel describes Zen in archery as follows: (...) The archer ceases to be conscious of himself as the one who is engaged in hitting the bull&#x27;s-eye which confronts him. This state of unconscious is realized only when, completely empty and rid of the self, he becomes one with the perfecting of his technical skill, though there is in it something of a quite different order which cannot be attained by any progressive study of the art (...)

==Influence==
Herrigel&#x27;s book may have inspired Tim Gallwey&#x27;s 1974 book &quot;The Inner Game of Tennis&quot;. Both Herrigel and Gallwey approach sport and life as opportunities for learning inner cooperation. 
&quot;Zen in the Art of Archery&quot; also relates to the &quot;inner child&quot; idea in humanistic psychology. Later literature either discusses balancing the &quot;inner game&quot; and the &quot;outer game&quot; or counseling approaches to accessing, communicating and collaborating with the inner child beyond sports.

The title &quot;Zen in the Art of Archery&quot; most likely inspired the titles of many other works, either directly or indirectly. Foremost among these is Robert Pirsig&#x27;s 1974 book &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;. More than 200 works have been created with similar titles, including Ray Bradbury&#x27;s 1990 book &quot;Zen in the Art of Writing&quot;, as well as &quot;Zen and the Art of Poker&quot;, &quot;Zen and the Art of Knitting&quot;, &quot;Crazy Legs Conti: Zen and the Art of Competitive Eating&quot;, and so on.

J. D. Salinger&#x27;s fictional character Seymour Glass applied one aspect of Zen archery—aiming by deliberately not taking aim—to playing the children&#x27;s game of marbles.

The wider theme of many of these works is that a regular routine can have a spiritual dimension.

==Criticism==
Both Arthur Koestler and Gershom Scholem accused Herrigel&#x27;s book of being influenced by and justifying the politics of the Nazi party on the pages of Encounter magazine. Scholem also accuses Herrigel&#x27;s widow of editing his writing and hiding the fact that he was an active member of the Nazi party and the Nazi organization the Militant League for German Culture.

Others, such as Shoji Yamada in his book &quot;Shots in the Dark&quot;, claim that many of the conversations between Herrigel and Awa Kenzo were altered or completely fabricated by the author.

<text>Edwin Brock (19 October 1927 – 7 September 1997) was a British poet. Brock published ten volumes of poetry from 1959 through his death in 1997.

Two of Brock&#x27;s poems In particular -- &quot;Five Ways to Kill a Man&quot; (1972) and &quot;Song of the Battery Hen&quot; (1977) -- have been heavily anthologized.

==Early life==
Brock was born in Dulwich, London, in 1927. He grew up in a working-class family with no literary aspirations. He won a scholarship to a local grammar school but his formal education ended after he gained his School Certificate. Brock&#x27;s interest in poetry was inspired by a paperback anthology of modern verse which he picked up idly as a bored 18-year-old, waiting to be de-mobbed from the Royal Navy at the end of the Second World War. This chance encounter in Hong Kong was to prove revelatory and from then on Brock, completely self-taught, began to write his own poems.

==Professional life==
Gradually Brock started to be published, firstly in the smaller magazines and eventually in the Times Literary Supplement. During this period, Brock served as a police officer in the Metropolitan force, the unusual combination of policeman and poet giving rise to a brief period of fame when a tabloid journalist published an interview with Brock under the banner headline: &quot;THE THINGS HE THINKS UP AS HE POUNDS THE PECKHAM BEAT&quot;. Brock was embarrassed by the sudden attention, but he continued to pursue his writing with serious intent. His efforts bore fruit when his first collection was accepted by the small but prestigious Scorpion Press in 1959. Its title, &quot;An Attempt at Exorcism&quot;, touches on the essentially personal nature of Brock&#x27;s work, the frankness of which connects him to confessional poetry which at that time was in the ascendancy in the United States. Indeed, Brock is one of the few British poets of this period to be known in America, with New Directions publishing several of his collections.

Brock left the police to become an advertising copywriter, a profession which he claimed to despise, but in which he became very successful, creating the famous strapline for the UK Financial Times newspaper of &#x27;No FT. No comment&#x27;. Brock resented the way work distracted him from his real creative life in poetry, but he continued to write alongside his career, publishing over a dozen collections and becoming increasingly prolific toward the end of his life. He was also editor of the magazine &quot;Ambit&quot; for almost four decades. In 1966 his status was recognised by his inclusion in the influential Penguin Modern Poets series together with Geoffrey Hill and Stevie Smith.

==Personal life==
Brock married Patricia Weller (Nellie V. Weller, born 1930, died 2020) in 1949, with whom he had a son and daughter. The marriage proved to be an unhappy one and was dissolved in 1964. The traumatic experience of marital conflict and divorce permeated his poetry at the time, for instance in the bitter and powerful &quot;An Arrangement for Seeing Children&quot;. In 1964, Brock married Elizabeth Skilton to whom he remained married for 33 years until his death.

Brock died on 7 September 1997 in Norfolk, England.

== Titles ==
Brocapps listed ten volumes of poetry collections, a novel and an autobiography.

Brock wrote two of the best-known poems of the last century, &quot;Five Ways to Kill a Man&quot; and &quot;Song of the Battery Hen&quot;, but his work deserves wider recognition beyond these anthology favourites.

Brock&#x27;s poems amply demonstrate the virtues of his &quot;intensely felt, supple, direct and memorable work.&quot; &quot;Five Ways to Kill a Man&quot; is chilling in its deliberately emotionless tone as it uses the language of a practical manual to explore humanity&#x27;s cruelty. Progress is reduced to the way in which mankind has &quot;improved&quot; its methods of killing. Inspired by a performance of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s War Requiem and written quickly, the poem has an air of authority which Brock&#x27;s reading emphasises. &quot;Song of the Battery Hen&quot; is similarly suited to being spoken aloud. Though written as a dramatic monologue, in his introduction Brock makes it clear the poem has autobiographical resonance. As such it is a good example of his belief that &quot;most activity is an attempt to define oneself in one way or another: for me poetry, and only poetry, has provided this self-defining act.&quot;.

Brock&#x27;s works include:

*&quot;An Attempt at Exorcism&quot; (poetry collection, 1959)
*&quot;The Little White God&quot; (novel, 1962)
*&quot;A Cold Day At The Zoo&quot; (1970)
*&quot;Invisibility Is The Art Of Survival&quot; (1972)
*&quot;I Never Saw It Lit&quot; (chapbook, 1974)
*&quot;Paroxisms&quot; (1974)
*&quot;The Blocked Heart&quot; (1976)
*&quot;Here, Now, Always&quot; (autobiography, 1977)
*&quot;Song of the Battery Hen: Selected Poems&quot; (1977)
*&quot;The River &amp; The Train&quot; (1979)
*&quot;Five Ways To Kill A Man: New and Selected Poems&quot; (1990)
*&quot;And Another Thing&quot; (1999)

<text>San Mateo, officially the Municipality of San Mateo (), is a municipality in the province of Rizal, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 273,306.

Conurbated to the urban agglomeration of the Greater Manila Area, San Mateo is one of the fastest-growing municipalities in Rizal Province, according to the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and the Provincial Government of Rizal. It is a commuter hub to Metro Manila.

San Mateo is the home of the miraculous image of Our Lady of Aranzazu (Nuestra Señora de Aranzazu).

==History==

=== Spanish Colonial Era ===
In his book &quot;Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas&quot;, Father Gaspar de San Agustín records what is now San Mateo in 1572 to be a satellite settlement of Pasig. He described the inhabitants being “fierce but friendly and of quiet disposition.” Father Juan de Medina, in his account &quot;Relación de los Conventos Y Pueblos Fundados por los PP. Agustinos&quot; likewise put 1572 as the year the Parish of San Mateo was established. However, according to Miguel López de Legazpi, the first governor-general of the Philippines from 1571 to 1572, it was his nephew Juan de Salcedo who arrived at the site of the town during an expedition to Manila from Cebu. Accounts say that two years prior, Legazpi sent Salcedo along with 150 soldiers to prepare the inauguration of the City of Manila. It must have been Salcedo who discovered the town before Legazpi inaugurated Manila on 24 June 1571.

Still, another account was that of a certain Augustinian named Father Cavada, who said that the first chapel in the islands with Saint Matthew as patron was built by the riverside in 1596 south of the present &quot;Población&quot; of the town, which was then only a Barrio of Tondo. Saint Matthew thus gave the town his name as the chapel was built on his feast day.

What may be gleaned from the above accounts somehow is that San Mateo was discovered sometime in 1571, while its first church was built in 1596. It may be true, too, that the Parish of San Mateo was erected in 1572.

Aside from the disagreement over the town’s precise foundation date, there is uncertainty as to how San Mateo acquired its name. According to one account, when the Spaniards made a reconnaissance of Manila&#x27;s environs, they saw the San Mateo floodplains and were enamored by the natural beauty of the place. They decided to found a community there and one day, a Spanish scribe happened to stand on a mound with a book in one hand and a pen in the other. His statuesque pose prompted a companion to laugh and comment how the scribe resembled Saint Matthew, referring to the usual manner the evangelist is depicted in art. In the midst of their banter and merriment, they decided to call the place “&quot;San Mateo&quot;”.

Another account says that San Mateo was named for its geographical resemblance to another town in Spain of the same name. As described by Paluzie in a geographical book, this small Spanish town is near a high mountain (and) has a river that flowed through its center, which often floods but quickly recedes. The town is also a grazing pasture for big animals and a fishing village. The present San Mateo is traversed by the Maly and Nangka rivers and its flood plains may have been a lush grazing area then.

The Augustinian priests in San Mateo were later formally replaced (in 1689) by the Jesuits, who as early as 1637 included San Mateo among their missions, with the missions of San Isidro and Paynaan under it. The Jesuits brought with them an image of the Virgin Mary which came from the Spanish town of Arantzazu in Vizcaya. They were the ones responsible for building the church now located in the Población since the original chapel by the Augustinians beside the river was destroyed in a flood. The location of the present church is in Barangay Santa Ana and its patron saint is Our Lady of Aranzazu. The original image of Saint Matthew, which was housed in the destroyed Augustinian chapel, was translated to Barangay Dulongbayan (formerly llaya), where it was enshrined as patron of the village, which still keeps his feast on 21 September.

In the following centuries, San Mateo had a colorful and distinguished history. In 1639, a pitched battle ensued between Chinese rebels on one side and combined Spanish and native troops on the other. The Chinese were defeated and retreated east to the Sierra Madre Mountains, but not before burning the town and its church.

On 16 May 1687, the territory and convent of San Mateo were added to Pasig by the Augustinians, with the headquarters and residences of the mission at &quot;Mariquina&quot; (Marikina). Two years later, the Augustinians handed over the ecclesiastical administration of San Mateo to the Jesuits.

In 1699, the convent of Saint Augustine won a court case against native inhabitants with regard to a claim over a ranch in the district of San Mateo.

From 1696 to 1746, residents rebelled against Spanish authority in the town. They fled to the mountains and abandoned the lowland settlement until 1746, when they returned following dialogue and persuasion by the Jesuits.

The independent-mindedness of the San Mateo people showed itself again in the 15-year period from 1751 to 1765 when they rebelled against Spanish rule. The residents were ordered to surrender their weapons, but they refused. With this resistance, the Spanish government was forced to reduce the town to ruins.

In 1712, the governor-general, the Conde de Lizarriaga, sent Captain Don Lorenzo de Yturriaga together with twelve soldiers to punish Captain Pambila, a native chieftain who was reportedly inciting the residents to revolt against Spanish colonial authorities and the local Spanish priest. Captain Pambila attacked the Spanish officer, but the latter was able to parry the blow and shoot the native leader dead.
When municipal governance was instituted by the Spaniards in San Mateo in 1799, the town was governed by a Gobernadorcillo who served for one year and exercised the power to appoint the Cabeza de Barangay for the same term of one year. However, there were instances when the Governadorcillo served for two or three years. The first resident appointed to the post of Governadorcillo in 1799 was Donato Sulit while the last one to hold the post in 1895 was one Ismael Amado Jr., who incidentally continued serving up to 1905 even after the establishment of the civil government under the Americans in 1901 when he was appointed &quot;Capitán Municipal&quot; by the Military Governor of the United States Army Department.
San Mateo was ed on 27 April 1871, when Captain-General Isquierdo issued a decree separating the barrios of Balite, Burgos, Marang and Calipahan from San Mateo and formed them into the new municipality of Montalbán (Rodríguez).

In the Spanish period, there was only one public school in San Mateo and the educational advancement of the youth was very slow. The books used were limited to the religious tracts called Eaton, Camia, Castiana, and the &quot;Doctrina Christiana.&quot; After knowing how to read, most students quit school while the few wealthy enrolled in Catholic schools in Manila.

=== Philippine Revolution ===

On 23 August 1896, the Philippine Revolution began after the Cry of Pugad Lawin when Andrés Bonifacio and the Katipuneros began the tearing of cédulas in defiance to Spanish rule.

On 2 November, San Mateo would fall under the revolutionary forces led by Bonifacio, capturing the municipal hall and besieging the Spanish garrison in the town. Three days later, Bonifacio would be pushed back to Montalban, and the besieged Spanish garrison would be relieved by reinforcements from Manila. The same month, General Mariano Llanera made San Mateo his headquarters.

By 6 August 1898, San Mateo joined the revolutionary government of General Emilio Aguinaldo.

During the succeeding Philippine–American War, General Licerio Gerónimo&#x27;s guerrilla bands from the foothills of San Mateo and Montalbán attacked American troops in October 1900. However, the Filipinos were defeated. A curious twist of history occurred when during the fighting, Gen. Henry Ware Lawton–who had captured the elusive Apache leader Geronimo–was in turn killed by a sharpshooter under Gen. Gerónimo. In the eyes of the Filipino people, Gen. Geronimo became a great man for killing an illustrious American general who distinguished himself during the American Civil War and the American military campaign in Cuba as well as in northern, southern and central Luzon.

During the American Occupation, Act No. 137 of the Philippine Commission incorporated San Mateo, previously part of the Province of Manila, into the newly created Province of Rizal on 11 June 1901. In line with its policy of fiscal economy and centralized governance, the Philippine Commission also enacted Act No. 942 in 1903 which merged the towns of San Mateo and Montalbán, with the former serving as the seat of government.

On 29 February 1908, Executive Order No. 20 partitioned both, thus formalizing Montalbán&#x27;s status as an independent municipality. Its real divisions then included the barrios of Ampid, Santa Ana, Guitnangbayan, Dulongbayan, Malanday, Guinayang and Maly. However, due to constant development of the rural areas and the increase in population, the barrios of Guitnangbayan and Dulongbayan were divided into two sections.

With regard to education, it was in 1909 when public schools were opened in the country under the supervision of Dr. David Burrows. San Mateo became a recipient of the new, democratized education system when Mr. Frank Green was assigned as the town’s first school supervisor, assisted by two Filipino teachers José Bernabé and Miguel Cristi. The English language was also taught in the public school. Transportation and other facilities in the municipality were increased and repaired thus resulting to more communication and exchange of goods and services.

=== Japanese Occupation Era ===
During the Japanese occupation, the Imperial Japanese Army occupied San Mateo, but no battle transpired between Japanese and Filipino forces. There were only minor encounters between the Japanese soldiers and members of the Filipino guerrilla forces. Nevertheless, some prominent residents of the town were killed and maltreated by the Japanese military on suspicions that they were either guerrillas or sympathizers.

Upon their arrival in the municipality, the Japanese troops seized school buildings and several big houses for use as their headquarters. Productive ricelands irrigated by water from the main pipe of the Metropolitan Water District were also forcibly appropriated and tilled under the direct supervision of Japanese officials. Livestock and crops were confiscated to supply the Japanese military stationed in San Mateo and Montalban.

When the American forces landed north of Manila on 3 February 1945 and started recapturing the surrounding areas, San Mateo came under the line of fire of the Liberation Forces and was continued with help of Filipino soldiers under the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary and local guerrillas. Residents were advised by the Air Raid Warden to vacate the Población and seek refuge in Sitio Kalamyong on the west bank of the Marikina River. There, they built temporary shelters while the U.S. Air Force conducted daily bombings on Japanese installations in Montalbán. However, one afternoon, a bomb on board an American Air Force plane was accidentally dropped on the refugee camp at Sitio Kalamyong, killing a hundred civilians.

Although in the aftermath of the war the American government compensated the people of San Mateo for the war damages, there were cases when the amounts received were not considered commensurate with the sufferings endured.

=== Cityhood and redistricting proposal ===

As early as 2016, the town&#x27;s Sangguniang Bayan approved Resolution No. 60, Series of 2016 requesting Senate through its president, Franklin Drilon and the House of Representatives through its speaker, Feliciano Belmonte Jr. to co-sponsor a bill for San Mateo&#x27;s conversion into a city and creation of a lone legislative district.

This was proposed by Rizal&#x27;s 2nd district Representative Juan Fidel Felipe Nograles through House Bill No. 336, making sure that the second district of Rizal will be reorganized to add two more districts, along with Rodríguez (Montalbán). Finally, on 12 April 2021, the 3rd district of Rizal, which consists only of San Mateo, was established by virtue of Republic Act No. 11533. It elected its first representative in 2022 in the person of Jose Arturo Garcia Jr.

===Timeline===

Through &quot;Presidential Proclamation 681&quot;, September 21, 2024 was declared a special non-working day in San Mateo, to commemorate the town&#x27;s 452nd founding anniversary.

==Geography==
The town lies in the Marikina Valley. The Marikina River runs through the western portion of the municipality, while the Nangka River runs through the south, bounded by Marikina. San Mateo has lush trees in other high areas. Most of the municipality is composed of residential areas, whereas the eastern side is composed of high plateaus and foothills of the Sierra Madre Mountains.

San Mateo is bordered by Quezon City to the west, Marikina and Antipolo to the south, and by the Municipality of Rodriguez (Montalban) to the north. San Mateo is approximately east of Manila and north of Antipolo, the provincial capital of Rizal.

===Barangays===
San Mateo is politically subdivided into 15 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.
In the 2020 census, the population of San Mateo, Rizal, was 273,306 people, with a density of .

===Industries===
The industrial establishments found in San Mateo are classified as light to medium industries. Welding shops and motor pool are among the predominant industries found within the municipality. Other industrial establishments are relatively small scale, like leather craft and &quot;kiskisan&quot;. Moreover, agri-business establishments which include poultry and piggery do exist within the municipality.

Various products are being manufactured in San Mateo. In fact, a group of different factories is found along Kambal Road, Barangay Guitnang Bayan 2. This includes San Mateo Rubber Corp. (Nikon and Durawalk Slippers), Jolly Food Corp., First Win Corp. (Slippers), and Golden Union Footwear Inc. (Evans Shoes). A Coca-Cola warehouse is also situated at Patiis Road corner GSIS Street (Daang Tubo) in Barangay Dulong Bayan 2. San Mateo also primarily manufactures gravel and sand aggregates together with other construction supplies that are found in hardware shops distributed all over the municipality.

===Commerce and trade===

The Central Business District is strategically located amidst the concentration of settlements. A major commercial area starts from the vicinity of the public market, bounded by the national road going to Rodriguez (Montalban) and Street of Daang Bakal in Barangay Guitnang Bayan 2. This commercial zone is a conglomeration of financial institutions, a public market, restaurants/small eateries, retail stores and the like.

Another area, which may be considered as major commercial area, is within the vicinity of De los Santos Street corner Gen. Luna Avenue, in Barangay Ampid 1. Other commercial areas extending to St. Mattheus Medical Hospital near the boundary of San Mateo and Marikina are located near Puregold San Mateo (formerly the Producer&#x27;s Market) at Barangay Banaba and another at the corner of Patiis Road and Gen. Luna Avenue, in Barangay Malanday.

SM City San Mateo along Gen. Luna Avenue in Barangay Ampid 1 adds to the list of major commercial centers of San Mateo. This SM Supermall and the very first full-service mall of San Mateo opens on May 15, 2015, serving local residents and from neighboring areas. Further boost in San Mateo&#x27;s economy is expected with the mall.

===Banking===
San Mateo has many bank branches like Banco de Oro (BDO), Bank of the Philippine Islands, Metrobank, Philippine Savings Bank (PSBank), EastWest Bank, China Bank, Philippine National Bank (PNB), Premiere Bank, Merchants Bank, Banco San Juan, Marikina Valley-San Mateo (MVSM) Bank, RCBC Savings Bank, United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB), Banco Rodriguez, Country Builders Bank, the Real Bank (a thrift bank).

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
San Mateo has a variety of conveyances that provide the residents with ready means of transportation. These are public utility jeepneys, buses, tricycles, pedicabs and UV Express Service are operating in the town. These facilitate the movement of people and goods to Metro Manila and nearby towns of Rizal.

There are six jeepney terminals in San Mateo: San Mateo Plaza, Barangay Pintong Bukawe, Barangay Banaba (Puregold), Barangay Silangan (AFP Housing &amp; Tierra Monte) and Barangay Santo Niño (Modesta).

Transportation routes passing San Mateo, are Montalban-Cubao (jeepneys), Montalban-San Mateo (jeepneys), and Commonwealth, Philcoa-San Mateo (jeepneys) thru the San Mateo-Batasan Bridge. These routes traverses Quezon City, Marikina, San Mateo and Rodriguez (Montalban). The only way to get through Pintong Bukawe is through Marcos Hi-way, Cabading &amp; Sapinit Roads in Antipolo.

Long before the Manila Light Rail Transit System opened its services in Santolan in the Pasig-Marikina border in the early 2000s, steam train services had once served those places in the past, even before World War II.

In Marikina, there is a street named &quot;Daangbakal&quot;, also called by the names of &quot;Shoe Avenue Extension&quot;, &quot;Munding Avenue&quot; and &quot;Bagong Silang&quot;. There is also a similar &quot;Daangbakal&quot; in the San Mateo-Montalban (Rodriguez) area, and on the maps one can notice that the two roads should have been connected with each other. In fact, as the name suggests in Tagalog, these streets were once a single railway line. The two sides of the &quot;Daangbakal&quot; roads were once connected by a bridge in the San Mateo-Marikina border. However, as the railroad tracks have been largely ignored after the Japanese Occupation and was transformed into separate highways, the railway connection was abandoned.

The old railroad tracks, called the Marikina Line, was connected from Tutuban station in Manila, passing through Tramo (Barangay Rosario, Pasig) coming all the way to the town of Marikina up to Montalban. On the northern end of the &quot;Daangbakal&quot; road in Montalban is a basketball court. That basketball court which stands today, surrounded by the Montalban Catholic Church and Cemetery, was once the railway station terminus of that particular line.

The present-day Santo Niño Elementary School in Marikina was said to be a train depot. And also it was said that a railroad station once stood in the Marikina City Sports Park.

The Marikina Line was completed in 1906, and continued its operation until 1936. It was said that the Japanese Imperial Army made use of this railway line during the Second World War. These railways were dismantled during the 1960s and were converted into ordinary roads.

Today, the citizens are dependent on tricycles, jeepneys, Taxis, FX, Buses, and AUV&#x27;s which contribute to the everyday unusual and unbearable traffic of Metropolitan Manila. Even now, there is uncertainty in the Northrail project, which links Manila to the northern provinces of Luzon, because of corruption within the project&#x27;s construction.

Aside from the Marikina Line, two other lines have existed before but are now removed permanently.

First is the Cavite Line, which passed through Paco, Parañaque, Bacoor and up to Naic, Cavite. Completed in 1908, its operation continued until 1936.

Second is the Antipolo Line, which passed through Santa Mesa, Mandaluyong, Pasig, Cainta, Taytay, up to Antipolo near the &quot;Hinulugang Taktak&quot; Falls. There is also a street named &quot;Daangbakal&quot; in Antipolo, where like the &quot;Daangbakal&quot; roads on Marikina and San Mateo, a railway line once existed. The railroad tracks also passed through what is now the Ortigas Avenue Extension. Its operation ceased in 1917.

Jeepneys are the most common form of transportation within the municipality because of its convenience and low fare as compared to other forms of transportation. Other modes are tricycles and pedicabs which are used mainly to transport people and goods where regular jeepney routes are not available.

Buses – The Marikina Auto Line Transport Corporation (MALTC) buses are the public utility buses that mainly operate in San Mateo. They operate ordinary-type buses, and newly acquired airconditioned buses which provide safe travel to passengers. There are some private buses that transport people who work at the Fortune Tobacco Plant and other nearby factories in Marikina. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) implemented a route rationalization system for city buses. Along with MALTC, multiple bus companies operated routes from Montalban to Quezon Avenue (Route 7), and Cubao (Route 8) in Quezon City, both of which passes through San Mateo. In 2022, the LTFRB announced that they will modify Route 7 as Montalban to PITX via Quezon Avenue (Route 34), while Route 8 was cancelled because of stiff competition with smaller modes of transportation.

===Power===
Power services in the town are provided by the Manila Electric Company (Meralco), except in the mountain barangay of Pintong Bukawe. There were 23,189 customers in San Mateo as of March 1999. Of these, 27,115 or 95.37 percent residential customers while commercial, industrial and streetlights number 971 (4.19 percent), 36 (0.15 percent), and 67 (0.29 percent), respectively. The municipality of San Mateo had a total demand of 55,355 megawatt-hours in 1998.

====San Mateo Mini-Hydro Power Plant====
A 2.46 megawatt mini-hydro power plant is on the way to start its operation by 2016, the projected year of completion of the spearheading company Hydrotec Renewables, Inc. of Germany, along San Mateo River, part of Marikina River. The company has already obtained Certificate of Non-Coverage from the Department of Energy which permits to proceed with its construction. This hydro project is one among the eight hydro power application projects of Hydrotec in the north-western Rizal-Marikina area which will effectively contribute a combined capacity of 25 to 30 megawatts of environment-friendly and clean energy to the Luzon grid or Meralco franchise area. Flood events within the locality are also expected to be reduced with the upcoming hydro power plant.

===Water===
The main source of the municipality&#x27;s water supply are deep wells, pump wells (operated by Manila Water), open wells, springs and other ground water resources. Some of the elevated parts of the municipality are under watershed protected areas since the topography is characterized by rolling to mountainous terrain.
From 0.65%, San Mateo&#x27;s water sanitation reached 100% on 2006 through the operation of Manila Water.

====North Manila Septage Treatment Plant====
Completed and started operating in May 2007, the Manila Water North Septage Treatment Plant is located in Barangay Guitnang Bayan 2. This treats 586 cubic meters of septage a day.

;Santo Niño-Silangan Water Supply Project

About 42,000 residents are expected to benefit from continuous water supply once Manila Water&#x27;s P320-M water supply project in San Mateo, Rizal gets completed.

The project, dubbed as Santo Niño-Silangan Water Supply Project, is divided into two phases: Phase 1, which will serve barangays Gulod Malaya, Santo Niño and portion of Silangan, and Phase 2, which will serve the whole of Silangan and the elevated areas of Parang in Marikina.

The project involves the construction of pumping station and reservoirs and the laying of 25 kilometers of water lines including mainlines and will benefit twelve existing subdivisions occupying a total land area of 27 hectares.

Started in October 2007, the water project is expected to provide ample water supply to meet the 15 to 20 million liters per day (MLD) demand of the more than 13,000 households in the area.

===San Mateo Sanitary Landfill===
In 2008, a proposal to build a 200-hectare sanitary landfill within the jurisdiction of two barangays was met with resistance by several environmental groups. The proposed landfill was to be constructed on ground area within a protected forest.

Bucking opposition by environment activists, the operator of the San Mateo waste dump is ready to give it a go. Andy Santiago, president of the San Mateo Sanitary Landfill and Development Corp., said it has given the green light for the 19-hectare facility in Rizal province to do business.

===Communication===
Telecommunications serve as a major link, within the sub-sectors and among other sectors of the economy, in the population centers and hinterlands. It also serves as a catalyst for growth and development. Telephone (Fixed landline &amp; Wireless), &amp; DSL Broadband Internet services are being provided by the Philippines Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), PT&amp;T and Converge ICT. While cellular phone services are provide by Globe Telecom, Smart Communications, and Dito Telecommunity.

<text>The River Corrib (Irish: &quot;Abhainn na Gaillimhe&quot;) in the west of Ireland flows from Lough Corrib through Galway to Galway Bay. The river is among the shortest in Europe, with only a length of six kilometres from the lough to the Atlantic. It is popular with local whitewater kayakers as well as several rowing clubs and pleasure craft. The depth of this river reaches up to 94 feet.

The Corrib drains a catchment area of 3,138 km2.

Although the Corrib is one of Ireland&#x27;s shortest rivers, it has a mean long-term flow rate of 104.8 m3/s, making it Ireland&#x27;s second-largest river (by flow), only surpassed by the River Shannon.

==Naming==
The translation of the Irish name of the river is &quot;Galway river&quot; i.e. from &quot;Gaillimh&quot;. In Irish it is sometimes called &quot;An Ghaillimh&quot; (&quot;the Galway&quot;) and also incorrectly called &quot;Abhainn na Coiribe&quot;. The legend concerning its naming states that it was called after Gaillimh inion Breasail, the daughter of a Fir Bolg chieftain who drowned in the river. The word &quot;Gaillimh&quot; is believed to mean &quot;stony&quot; as in &quot;stony river&quot;. The commonly held myth that the city takes its name from the Irish word &quot;Gallaibh&quot;, &quot;foreigners&quot; i.e. &quot;the town of the foreigners&quot; (from &quot;Gall&quot;, a foreigner) is incorrect as the name Gaillimh was applied to the river first and then later onto the town. Indeed, the earliest settlement at Galway was called &quot;Dún Bhun na Gaillimhe&quot;, or &quot;the fort at the end of the Galway (river)&quot;.

The river gave its name to the town, which grew to a city, and from c. 1570 onwards, the city gave its name to the county. It also aided massively in the industrial development of the town, allowing it to develop electrical power before London. At the height of water power, there were over twenty water wheels in operation from races built on the river and its accompanying cut, the Eglinton Canal, which was built as part of the &quot;Drainage and Navigation scheme of Lough Carra, Lough Corrib and Lough Mask&quot; in the mid-19th century. The canal, which is about three-quarters of a mile long, had a sea-lock, a large basin, a second lock at Parkavore and five swivelling bridges. It is still in water but the swivelling bridges have been replaced by fixed bridges; the last vessel to use the navigation was the Amo II, a 90&#x27; motor-yacht that had been sold by the Guinness trustees to Frank Bailey, a Galway hotelier.

Lough Corrib is the anglicised form of &quot;Loch Coirib&quot; which itself is a corruption of Loch nOrbsean which, according to placename lore, is named after the Irish god of the sea. There is good fishing to be had on both the lake and river.

Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; (2nd century AD) described a river called Αυσοβα (&quot;Ausoba&quot;) which probably referred to the River Corrib.

===&quot;Upper&quot; and &quot;Lower&quot; Corrib===

The part of the river that flows from the southern end of the lake to the Salmon Weir is known as the &quot;Upper Corrib&quot;. The weir, a set of weir gates also built during the above navigation scheme, was originally built from stone and timber but now only two of these gates remain and are only opened in times of flood. The rest have been replaced by fourteen steel gates, as shown in the photograph above.

The main channel leaving Lough Corrib is called &quot;Friars&#x27; Cut&quot; or &quot;Friars&#x27; River&quot; () as it is the result of a very early piece of canal engineering. In 1178 the friars of Claregalway Abbey, being tired of the long detour they had to make to the west to enter the river, asked permission from the Blakes of Menloe to make an artificial cut, which in time became the main course of the river and was then widened.

The section of the river that runs from the Salmon Weir through Galway city and out into Galway Bay is known as the &quot;Lower Corrib&quot;. Three bridges cross the &quot;Lower&quot; – the Salmon Weir Bridge, William O&#x27;Brien Bridge and Wolfe Tone Bridge.

The only tributary of the Lower Corrib is Sruthán na gCaisleáin (Castle Stream) known by whitewater kayakers as the &quot;Shit Chute&quot; and the access point to the river, a small stream that flows through Newcastle, the grounds of NUI Galway, and empties into the Lower just downstream of King&#x27;s weir, commonly known as the fish gates.

The official publication for NUI Galway Alumni, Staff &amp; Friends, &quot;Cois Coiribe&quot;, is named in reference to the Corrib.

==Bridges==

Four bridges span Corrib in Galway. These are the Wolfe Tone Bridge, the William O&#x27;Brien Bridge, the Salmon Weir Bridge, and the Quincentenary Bridge. There is also a new pedestrian bridge adjacent to the Salmon Weir Bridge since 2023.

<text>In linguistics, a marker is a free or bound morpheme that indicates the grammatical function of the marked word, phrase, or sentence. Most characteristically, markers occur as clitics or inflectional affixes. In analytic languages and agglutinative languages, markers are generally easily distinguished. In fusional languages and polysynthetic languages, this is often not the case. For example, in Latin, a highly fusional language, the word &quot;&quot; (&quot;I love&quot;) is marked by suffix &quot;&quot; for indicative mood, active voice, first person, singular, present tense. Analytic languages tend to have a relatively limited number of markers.

Markers should be distinguished from the linguistic concept of markedness. An &quot;unmarked&quot; form is the basic &quot;neutral&quot; form of a word, typically used as its dictionary lemma, such as—in English—for nouns the singular (e.g. &quot;cat&quot; versus &quot;cats&quot;), and for verbs the infinitive (e.g. &quot;to eat&quot; versus &quot;eats&quot;, &quot;ate&quot; and &quot;eaten&quot;). Unmarked forms (e.g. the nominative case in many languages) tend to be less likely to have markers, but this is not true for all languages (compare Latin). Conversely, a marked form may happen to have a zero affix, like the genitive plural of some nouns in Russian (e.g. ). In some languages, the same forms of a marker have multiple functions, such as when used in different cases or declensions (for example &quot;&quot; in Latin).

<doc id="892232" wikidata="Q1047946" url="?curid=892232" title="Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr">
<text>Tanngrisnir (Old Norse: , literal meaning &quot;teeth grinder&quot; or &quot;one that grinds teeth&quot;) and Tanngnjóstr (, &quot;teeth thin&quot;, or &quot;one that has gaps between the teeth&quot;) are the goats who pull the chariot of the god Thor in Norse mythology. They are attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century.

The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; relates that when Thor cooks the goats, their flesh provides sustenance for the god, and, after Thor resurrects them with his hammer, Mjölnir, they are brought back to life the next day. According to the same source, Thor once stayed a night at the home of peasant farmers and shared with them his goat meal, yet one of their children, Þjálfi, broke one of the bones to suck out the marrow, resulting in the lameness of one of the goats upon resurrection. As a result, Thor maintains Þjálfi and his sister Röskva as his servants. Scholars have linked the ever-replenishing goats to the nightly-consumed beast Sæhrímnir in Norse mythology and Scandinavian folk beliefs involving herring bones and witchcraft.

==Etymology==
The Old Norse name &quot;Tanngrisnir&quot; translates to &quot;teeth-barer, snarler&quot; and &quot;Tanngnjóstr&quot; to &quot;teeth-grinder&quot;. Scholar Rudolf Simek comments that the names were young when recorded, and may have been inventions of Snorri. &quot;Tanngnjóstr&quot; is sometimes modernly anglicized as Tanngiost.

==Attestations==
===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===

Thor&#x27;s goats are mentioned in two poems in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, though they are not referred to by name. In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Hymiskviða&quot;, Thor secures the goats, described as having &quot;splendid horns&quot;, with a human named Egil in the realm of Midgard before Thor and the god Tyr continue to the jötunn Hymir&#x27;s hall. Later in the same poem Thor is referred to as &quot;lord of goats&quot;.

After having killed Hymir and his many-headed army, Thor&#x27;s goats collapse, &quot;half-dead&quot;, due to lameness. The poem says that this is the fault of Loki, yet that &quot;you have heard this already&quot;, and that another, wiser than the poet, could tell the story of how Thor was repaid by a lava-dweller with his children.

A stanza from the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Þrymskviða&quot; describes Thor&#x27;s goat-driven ride to Jötunheimr:


===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
In chapter 21 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, the enthroned figure of High divulges that the god Thor has two goats that drive his chariot and that these goats bear the names Tanngnjóstr and Tanngrisnir.

In chapter 44, the enthroned figure of Third reluctantly relates a tale in which Thor and Loki are riding in Thor&#x27;s chariot, pulled by his two goats. Loki and Thor stop at the home of a peasant farmer, and there they are given lodging for a night. Thor slaughters his goats, skins them and puts them in a pot. When the goats are cooked, Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal. Thor invites the peasant family to share the meal with him and they do so.

At the end of the meal, Thor places the skins of the goat on the opposing side of the fire and tells the peasants to throw the bones of the goats on to the goatskins. The peasant&#x27;s son Þjálfi takes one of the goat ham-bones and uses a knife to split it open, breaking the bone to get to the marrow.

After staying the night at the peasants house, Thor wakes up and gets dressed before the break of dawn. Thor takes his hammer Mjöllnir, raises it, and blesses the goat skins. Resurrected, the goats stand, but one of the two goats is lame in the hind leg. Noting this new lameness, Thor exclaims that someone has mistreated the bones of his goats; that someone broke the ham-bone during the meal the night before. Third notes that there is no need to draw out the tale, for:

:Everyone can imagine how terrified the peasant must have been when he saw Thor making his brows sink down over his eyes; as for what could be seen of the eyes themselves, he thought he would collapse at just the very sight. Thor clenched his hands on the shaft of the hammer so that the knuckles went white, and the peasant did as one might expect, and all his household, they cried out fervently, begged for grace, offered to atone with all their possessions.

At realizing how terrified he has made the peasants, Thor calms down and from them accepted a settlement of their children Þjálfi and Röskva. The two children become his servants and have remained so since. Leaving the goats behind, the four then set out for the land of Jötunheimr. The goats are again mentioned in chapter 48, where Thor is described as setting out to Midgard, the realm of mankind, in the form of a young boy, without goats or companions.

In chapter 75 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, the names of both goats appear among a list of names for goats.

==Theories and interpretations==
Scholar Rudolf Simek connects Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr with the beast Sæhrímnir (consumed nightly by the gods and the einherjar and rejuvenated every day), noting that this may point to sacrificial rites in shamanic practices.

In Scandinavian folklore, witches who magically replenish food sometimes appear in tales, the food usually being herring. However, in fear that one would waste away if one were fed the same morsel again and again, folk tales describe the breaking of the herring bones when eating it as a form of precaution. Thematic similarities—bone breaking ending food rejuvenation—between this folk belief and the Old Norse tales of Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr have led scholars Reimund Kvideland and Henning Sehmsdorf to highlight a connection between the two.

==Modern influence== 
Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr have been adapted in Marvel Comics as Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder.

In the film adaptation of the &quot;Speed Racer&quot; manga franchise, there is a racecar named after Tanngrisnir, driven by Gothorm Danneskjøld, who is appropriately dressed as a Viking and sponsored by a company called Thor-Axine, referring to the chariot.

In the Yu-Gi-Oh Trading Card Game, both Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr are represented as &quot;Nordic Beast&quot; Monster Cards. They are meant to be used in conjunction with other cards representative of other characters and creatures from Norse mythology, including their master Thor.

In Rick Riordan&#x27;s book &quot;Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard: The Sword of Summer&quot;, both Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr appeared. They are called Marvin and Otis, respectively, in the book and they are commonly sacrificed by the god Thor, to be reborn the next day.

In Heidevolk&#x27;s song &quot;Een met de storm&quot;, the &quot;dondergod&quot; (thunder god) rides in a &quot;bokkenkar&quot; (goat cart) over the clouds, alluding to Thor&#x27;s two goats. 

In the 2018 video-game &quot;God of War&quot;, the Grip of Tanngiost is a blade pommel that causes shock damage, which can be used on the Leviathan Axe.

Both goats appear in the Danish Valhalla comics series, and the animated feature based on it. The god Thor butchers and cooks one of the rams but strongly warns against breaking the bones. Loki persuades Tjalfe (Þjálfi) into sucking the marrow from a leg bone from one of the goats. When Thor resurrects the goats the next morning, he finds that one of the goats is lame in the leg and becomes enraged. As a result, Thor maintains Tjalfe and his sister as his servants.

Both goats appear in the game Super Auto Pets as Tandgnost and Tandgrisner. There is a food called the Yggdrasil Fruit that summons both of them.

<doc id="892233" wikidata="Q4915164" url="?curid=892233" title="Biomusicology">
<text>Biomusicology is the study of music from a biological point of view. The term was coined by Nils L. Wallin in 1991 to encompass several branches of music psychology and musicology, including evolutionary musicology, neuromusicology, and comparative musicology.

Evolutionary musicology studies the &quot;origins of music, the question of animal song, selection pressures underlying music evolution&quot;, and &quot;music evolution and human evolution&quot;. Neuromusicology studies the &quot;brain areas involved in music processing, neural and cognitive processes of musical processing&quot;, and &quot;ontogeny of musical capacity and musical skill&quot;. Comparative musicology studies the &quot;functions and uses of music, advantages and costs of music making&quot;, and &quot;universal features of musical systems and musical behavior&quot;.

Applied biomusicology &quot;attempts to provide biological insight into such things as the therapeutic uses of music in medical and psychological treatment; widespread use of music in the audiovisual media such as film and television; the ubiquitous presence of music in public places and its role in influencing mass behavior; and the potential use of music to function as a general enhancer of learning.&quot;

Whereas biomusicology refers to music among humans, zoomusicology extends the field to other species.

<text>Middle East Airlines – Air Liban S.A.L. (), more commonly known as Middle East Airlines (MEA) (), is the flag carrier of Lebanon, with its head office in Beirut, near Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport. It operates scheduled international flights to Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa from its base at Rafic Hariri International Airport.

Middle East Airlines (MEA) is a member of the SkyTeam airline alliance. MEA expressed its interest in becoming a SkyTeam associate member in early 2006 at a press conference in New York.
On 28 February 2011, the airline signed the partnership agreement with SkyTeam at a ceremony in Beirut, and officially joined the alliance on 28 June 2012, becoming its 17th member and the second member airline in the Middle East.

==History==

Middle East Airlines - Air Liban was founded on 31 May 1945 by Saeb Salam and Fawzi EL-Hoss with operational and technical support from BOAC. Operations started on 1 January 1946 using three de Havilland DH.89A Dragon Rapides on flights between Beirut and Nicosia, followed by flights to Iraq, Egypt, and Syria. Two Douglas DC-3s were acquired in mid-1946. Pan American World Airways acquired a stake and management contract in September 1949. Pan Am was replaced when BOAC acquired 49% of MEA&#x27;s shares in 1955. A Vickers Viscount was introduced in October 1955 while an Avro York cargo aircraft was leased in June 1957. On 15 December 1960 the first of four de Havilland Comet 4Cs arrived. After the association with BOAC ended on 16 August 1961, MEA was merged with Air Liban on 7 June 1963, which gave Air France a 30% holding (since relinquished). The full title was then Middle East Airlines – Air Liban. In 1963 MEA also took over Lebanese International Airways. 
The current name was adopted in November 1965 when the airline was merged with Air Liban. Although operations were interrupted by the 1967 Arab–Israeli war, and by the Israeli raid on Beirut Airport in 1968 - in which the airline lost three Comet 4C&#x27;s, two Caravelles, a Boeing 707, the Vickers VC10, and the Vickers Viscount - MEA restarted by acquiring a Convair 990A from American Airlines, which entered service on 24 June 1969. 
A Boeing 747-200B entered service in June 1975 on the Beirut–London route, and later on the Beirut–Paris–New York route from April 1983 until mid-1985. MEA had to adjust its operations due to the Lebanese Civil War between 1975 and 1991 but continued services despite multiple closures of the base at Beirut International Airport. Airbus A310-300s were acquired in 1993 and 1994, followed by an A321-200 in 1997 and the A330-200 (which replaced the A310s) in 2003. The airline has introduced self-check-in kiosks at Beirut International Airport as of 2010. 

In November 2011, MEA&#x27;s pilots union staged a 48-hour strike after a captain undergoing cancer treatment was dismissed shortly after going on sick leave. 
On 28 June 2012, Middle East Airlines joined the SkyTeam alliance to become its 17th member and the second in the Middle East following Saudia. 5,000 staff are employed across the airline group. The central bank of Lebanon, Banque du Liban, owns a majority share of 99.50%.

<text>Mile End Park is a park located in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It is a linear park of some , and was created on industrial land devastated by World War II bombing. Some of the park is within Limehouse and Bow, with the park lying on land to the east of the Regent&#x27;s Canal. In the north, it is separated from the southern edge of Victoria Park by the Hertford Union Canal. It is open 24 hours a day.
A plan existed from the end of the war to create the park, but extensive development did not begin until the end of the millennium. A pedestrian bridge, opened in July 1999, was built over the Mile End Road, which bisects the park, near Mile End tube station. The bridge was designed by Piers Gough. Prior to the park&#x27;s construction, &quot;193 Grove Road&quot; - at the edge of the park - was transformed by sculptor Rachel Whiteread into a cast of its interior. This work won her the Turner Prize in 1993.

In 1381, 60,000 &quot;Men of Essex&quot; camped here and met Richard II at Mile End, on 14 June 1381, during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt.

The park now consists of a number of elements (running north–south): &quot;The Play Arena&quot; - for children, &quot;The Ecology Park&quot; - including a lake, an ecology building, wind turbine and climbing wall, &quot;The Arts Park&quot;, &quot;The Green Bridge&quot;, &quot;The Terraced Garden&quot;, &quot;The South Park&quot;, &quot;Adventure Park&quot;, &quot;Sports Park&quot; - including the Mile End stadium, &quot;Kirk&#x27;s Place&quot; and &quot;The Children&#x27;s Park&quot;. Nearby are an extreme sports centre and an electric Go kart track.

The Ragged School Museum opened in 1990 in three canal side former warehouses in Copperfield Road. It faces the western edge of the park south of Mile End Road. The buildings previously housed Dr Barnado&#x27;s Copperfield Road Ragged School.

The park has been awarded the &quot;London First Award&quot;, the Green bridge the &quot;Institution of Civil Engineers Award of Merit&quot;, a commendation at the &quot;British Construction Industry Awards&quot; and a special commendation from the &quot;Prime Minister&#x27;s Award&quot;.

The park has an active Friends group. 

==Mile End Stadium==

Mile End Stadium, situated at the south end of the park, underwent refurbishment which was completed in 2005. A new sport and fitness centre, the Mile End Park Leisure Centre was built adjacent to the Stadium and opened in 2006. It houses a four- court sports hall, two swimming pools (including one competition standard pool), state-of-the-art fitness studios, and a health suite and sauna.

The Mile End Climbing Wall is also located in Mile End Park.

<doc id="892242" wikidata="Q948798" url="?curid=892242" title="Carolina Cougars">
<text>The Carolina Cougars were a basketball franchise in the American Basketball Association that existed from 1969 through 1974. The Cougars were originally a charter member of the ABA as the Houston Mavericks in 1967. The Mavericks moved to North Carolina in late 1969 after two unsuccessful seasons in Houston at the Sam Houston Coliseum.

==History==
===Early years in Carolina===
The Carolina Cougars franchise began when future Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina Jim Gardner bought the Houston Mavericks and moved them to North Carolina in 1969. At the time, none of North Carolina&#x27;s large metropolitan areas – Charlotte, the Piedmont Triad and the Triangle – was large enough to support a professional team on its own. With this in mind, Gardner decided to brand the Cougars as a &quot;regional&quot; team. Gardner sold the team after one season to Ted Munchak, who poured significant resources into the team.

The Cougars were based in Greensboro and played most of their home games at the Greensboro Coliseum, the state&#x27;s largest arena at the time. Games were also regularly played in Charlotte at the (original) Charlotte Coliseum and in Raleigh at Dorton Arena and Reynolds Coliseum. In early 1972, three regular season games were played in Winston-Salem at the Winston-Salem Memorial Coliseum, and one game was played at Fort Bragg.

Early on, the Cougars were not especially successful on the court, posting a 42–42 record in the 1969–70 season, a 34–50 record in 1970–71, and a 35–49 record in 1971–72. The 1969–70 Cougars managed to make the ABA playoffs but lost in the Eastern Division semifinals (first round) to a much stronger Indiana Pacers team. In spite of this, the Cougars had a good fan following, particularly in Greensboro.

The 1971–72 team was coached by former NBA All-Star Tom Meschery, who had just retired from 10 years of NBA play with the San Francisco Warriors and the Seattle SuperSonics.

===Success under Larry Brown===

In 1972–73, the Cougars hired retired ABA players Larry Brown and former Cougar Doug Moe as coaches. The 1972–73 Cougars were fairly talented and featured players Billy Cunningham, Joe Caldwell, and Mack Calvin. All three appeared in the ABA All-Star Game that season, and Cunningham was named the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player.

Carolina went on to post a 57–27 record, which was the best in the ABA. The Cougars beat the New York Nets in their first-round playoff series 4 games to 1, but lost a close series to the Kentucky Colonels 4 games to 3 in the Eastern Division finals. There were many upset and disappointed fans in Greensboro when the Cougars decided to hold game 7 of the series in Charlotte. Of the 42 scheduled regular season home games, 25 were usually scheduled for Greensboro while only 12 were played in Charlotte. With Cougar management having the choice of city to play game 7, it mystified its Greensboro area fans with the choice to play such a pivotal game on a less familiar court. Game 7 was hotly contested but Kentucky prevailed, much to Cougar fans dismay.

The 1973–74 Cougars started the season strong, winning 17 of their first 22 games. Despite injuries and internal squabbles, the Cougars posted a 47–37 record but were swept in the Eastern Division semifinals 4 games to 0 by the Kentucky Colonels.

===Move to St. Louis===
1973–74 turned out to be the Cougars&#x27; last season in North Carolina. Although they were moderately successful overall and had one of the most loyal fan bases in the ABA, talks toward an ABA–NBA merger were in the final stages, and it had become apparent that a &quot;regional&quot; franchise would not be viable in the NBA. Although the Charlotte/Greensboro/Raleigh axis (the Piedmont Crescent or I-85 Corridor) was beginning an unprecedented period of growth, none of these cities was big enough at the time to support an NBA team on its own. Additionally, several persons quoted in the book &quot;Loose Balls&quot; by Terry Pluto say the added travel expenses incurred by the regional concept ultimately proved insurmountable. Munchak sold the Cougars to a consortium of New York businessmen headed by brothers Ozzie and Daniel Silna, who moved to St. Louis as the Spirits of St. Louis. However, the new owners assembled an almost entirely new team after moving to St. Louis; only a few players from the 1973–74 Cougars suited up for the 1974–75 Spirits.

The Spirits were one of two teams that lasted until the very end of the league but not join the NBA; the other was the Kentucky Colonels (the Virginia Squires folded after the final ABA regular season ended but before the ABA–NBA merger due to their inability to meet a league-mandated financial assessment after the season ended.). At the time of the ABA–NBA merger, the Spirits&#x27; owners planned to move the team to Salt Lake City, Utah to play as the Utah Rockies; instead, its players were dealt in the 1976 ABA dispersal draft.

==Legacy==
Professional basketball would return to North Carolina in 1988 when the Charlotte Hornets entered the NBA.

Carl Scheer, who won Executive of the Year as a member of the Cougars, would later become the first executive of the NBA&#x27;s Charlotte Hornets. Cougars point guard Gene Littles would become an assistant coach, an executive, and the second head coach of the Hornets. Larry Brown, who coached the Cougars for two seasons and won Coach of the Year during his tenure, would eventually become the eighth head coach of Charlotte&#x27;s NBA franchise.

Two teams in other professional sports leagues include Carolina in their branding: the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League, and the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League. The former team is based in Charlotte, and the latter team in Raleigh.

Beginning in 2012, the Cougars&#x27; uniforms were worn by the Bobcats/Hornets under the NBA Hardwood Classics moniker.

<text>Widecombe Fair is an annual fair in England, held in the Dartmoor village of Widecombe-in-the-Moor on the second Tuesday of September. It is well known as the subject of the folk song of the same name, featuring Uncle Tom Cobley and his friends.

== History ==

The earliest written record was in 1850, when it was described in the &quot;Plymouth Gazette&quot; as a cattle fair. It soon became an opportunity to show and sell other livestock, particularly locally bred sheep and Dartmoor ponies, and by the 1920s it had also become a sports day for local schoolchildren. In 1933, stalls were introduced, selling rural arts and crafts. World War I saw a cancellation of the Fair between 1915 and 1918.

Widecombe Fair was suspended during the Second World War, but reinstated in 1945 with new attractions, including a gymkhana and tug of war. All profits were donated to the &#x27;Local Welcome Home Fund&#x27; for returning soldiers, sailors and airmen.

In 1989, it was decided to cancel the pony classes following an outbreak of Equine flu (these were replaced with terrier races, which have continued ever since). The Fair was cancelled altogether in 2001 due to the outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease, and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, despite these interruptions, the event has steadily grown in size and reputation. In its earlier years, it was held in various locations around the village, including the village green. Today, however, it occupies a large field to the south of Widecombe (known to locals as The Fair Field). Other fields become car parks, and a complex policing and marshalling system is put in place, with the narrow lanes transformed into a one-way road system.

Today&#x27;s visitors will still see displays of quality livestock, although there are many other attractions, including: a dog show, displays of local produce, vintage farm machinery, rural arts and crafts, bale tossing and a now traditional appearance by &quot;Uncle Tom Cobley&quot;: a local resident in fancy dress, riding a grey mare.

<doc id="892264" wikidata="Q1128004" url="?curid=892264" title="Wheelbase">
<text>In both road and rail vehicles, the wheelbase is the horizontal distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels. For road vehicles with more than two axles (e.g. some trucks), the wheelbase is the distance between the steering (front) axle and the centerpoint of the driving axle group. In the case of a tri-axle truck, the wheelbase would be the distance between the steering axle and a point midway between the two rear axles.

== Vehicles ==

The wheelbase of a vehicle equals the distance between its front and rear wheels. At equilibrium, the total torque of the forces acting on a vehicle is zero. Therefore, the wheelbase is related to the force on each pair of tires by the following formula:
:formula_1

:formula_2
where formula_3 is the force on the front tires, formula_4 is the force on the rear tires, formula_5 is the wheelbase, formula_6 is the distance from the center of mass (CM) to the rear wheels, formula_7 is the distance from the center of mass to the front wheels (formula_7 + formula_6 = formula_5), formula_11 is the mass of the vehicle, and formula_12 is the gravity constant. So, for example, when a truck is loaded, its center of gravity shifts rearward and the force on the rear tires increases. The vehicle will then ride lower. The amount the vehicle sinks will depend on counter acting forces, like the size of the tires, tire pressure, and the spring rate of the suspension.
If the vehicle is accelerating or decelerating, extra torque is placed on the rear or front tire respectively. The equation relating the wheelbase, height above the ground of the CM, and the force on each pair of tires becomes:
:formula_13

:formula_14
where formula_3 is the force on the front tires, formula_4 is the force on the rear tires, formula_6 is the distance from the CM to the rear wheels, formula_7 is the distance from the CM to the front wheels, formula_5 is the wheelbase, formula_11 is the mass of the vehicle, formula_12 is the acceleration of gravity (approx. 9.8 m/s2), formula_22 is the height of the CM above the ground, formula_23 is the acceleration (or deceleration if the value is negative). So, as is common experience, when the vehicle accelerates, the rear usually sinks and the front rises depending on the suspension. Likewise, when braking the front noses down and the rear rises.

Because of the effect the wheelbase has on the weight distribution of the vehicle, wheelbase dimensions are crucial to the balance and steering. For example, a car with a much greater weight load on the rear tends to understeer due to the lack of the load (force) on the front tires and therefore the grip (friction) from them. This is why it is crucial, when towing a single-axle caravan, to distribute the caravan&#x27;s weight so that down-thrust on the tow-hook is about 100 pounds force (400 N). Likewise, a car may oversteer or even &quot;spin out&quot; if there is too much force on the front tires and not enough on the rear tires. Also, when turning there is lateral torque placed upon the tires which imparts a turning force that depends upon the length of the tire distances from the CM. Thus, in a car with a short wheelbase (&quot;SWB&quot;), the short lever arm from the CM to the rear wheel will result in a greater lateral force on the rear tire which means greater acceleration and less time for the driver to adjust and prevent a spin out or worse.

Wheelbases provide the basis for one of the most common vehicle size class systems.

===Varying wheelbases within nameplate===

Some vehicles are offered with long-wheelbase variants to increase the spaciousness and therefore the luxury of the vehicle. This practice can often be found on full-size cars like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, but ultra-luxury vehicles such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom and even large family cars like the Rover 75 came with &#x27;limousine&#x27; versions. Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair was given a long-wheelbase version of the Rover 75 for official use. and even some SUVs like the VW Tiguan and Jeep Wrangler are available with long wheelbases.

In contrast, coupé varieties of some vehicles such as the Honda Accord are usually built on shorter wheelbases than the sedans they are derived from.

=== Bikes ===
The wheelbase on many commercially available bicycles and motorcycles is so short, relative to the height of their centers of mass, that they are able to perform stoppies and wheelies.

=== Skateboards ===

In skateboarding the word &#x27;wheelbase&#x27; is used for the distance between the two inner pairs of mounting holes on the deck. This is different from the distance between the rotational centers of the two wheel pairs. A reason for this alternative use is that decks are sold with prefabricated holes, but usually without trucks and wheels. It is therefore easier to use the prefabricated holes for measuring and describing this characteristic of the deck.

A common misconception is that the choice of wheelbase is influenced by the height of the skateboarder. However, the length of the deck would then be a better candidate, because the wheelbase affects characteristics useful in different speeds or terrains regardless of the height of the skateboarder. For example, a deck with a long wheelbase, say , will respond slowly to turns, which is often desirable in high speeds. A deck with a short wheelbase, say , will respond quickly to turns, which is often desirable when skating backyard pools or other terrains requiring quick or intense turns.

== Rail ==

In rail vehicles, the wheelbase follows a similar concept. However, since the wheels may be of different sizes (for example, on a steam locomotive), the measurement is taken between the points where the wheels contact the rail, and not between the centers of the wheels.

On vehicles where the wheelsets (axles) are mounted inside the vehicle frame (mostly in steam locomotives), the wheelbase is the distance between the front-most and rear-most wheelsets.

On vehicles where the wheelsets are mounted on bogies (American: trucks), three wheelbase measurements can be distinguished:
* the distance between the pivot points of the front-most and rear-most bogie;
* the distance between the front-most and rear-most wheelsets of the vehicle;
* the distance between the front-most and rear-most wheelsets of each bogie.

The wheelbase affects the rail vehicle&#x27;s capability to negotiate curves. Short-wheelbased vehicles can negotiate sharper curves. On some larger wheelbase locomotives, inner wheels may lack flanges in order to pass curves.

The wheelbase also affects the load the vehicle poses to the track, track infrastructure and bridges. All other conditions being equal, a shorter wheelbase vehicle represents a more concentrated load to the track than a longer wheelbase vehicle. As railway lines are designed to take a predetermined maximum load per unit of length (tonnes per meter, or pounds per foot), the rail vehicles&#x27; wheelbase is designed according to their intended gross weight. The higher the gross weight, the longer the wheelbase must be.

<text>Lucy Larcom (March 5, 1824 – April 17, 1893) was an American teacher, poet, and author. She was one of the first teachers at Wheaton Female Seminary (now Wheaton College) in Norton, Massachusetts, teaching there from 1854 to 1862. During that time, she co-founded &quot;Rushlight Literary Magazine&quot;, a submission-based student literary magazine which is still published. From 1865 to 1873, she was the editor of the Boston-based &quot;Our Young Folks&quot;, which merged with &quot;St. Nicholas Magazine&quot; in 1874. In 1889, Larcom published one of the best-known accounts of New England childhood of her time, &quot;A New England Girlhood&quot;, commonly used as a reference in studying antebellum American childhood; the autobiographical text covers the early years of her life in Beverly Farms and Lowell, Massachusetts.

Among her earlier and best-known poems are &quot;Hannah Binding Shoes,&quot; and &quot;The Rose Enthroned.&quot; Larcom&#x27;s earliest contribution to the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, when the poet James Russell Lowell was its editor, a poem, that in the absence of signature, was attributed to Emerson by one reviewer. Also of note was &quot;A Loyal Woman&#x27;s No&quot; which was a patriotic lyric and attracted considerable attention during the American Civil War. Larcom was inclined to write on religious themes, and made two volumes of compilations from the world&#x27;s great religious thinkers, &quot;Breathings of the Better Life&quot; (Boston, 1866) and &quot;Beckonings&quot; (Boston. 1886). Her last two books, &quot;As it is in Heaven&quot; (Boston, 1891) and &quot;The Unseen Friend&quot; (Boston, 1892), embodied much of her own thought on matters concerning the spiritual life.

==Early years and education==
Lucy Larcom was born in Beverly, Massachusetts, on March 5, 1824, to Lois and Benjamin Larcom. She was the ninth of ten children, eight of whom were daughters. According to her autobiography, &quot;A New England Girlhood, outlined from memory&quot;, Beverly was a small village at this time where she was able to play with neighbor children. She developed an early interest in reading and writing which she developed by reading children&#x27;s fiction of the period. Titles included &quot;Alonzo and Melissa, The Children of the Abbey,&quot; and collective fairy tales. She borrowed books from the Sabbath-school library, including &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress.&quot; Other favorites from a circulating library included &quot;The Scottish Chiefs, Paul and Virginia, Gulliver&#x27;s Travels,&quot; and &quot;The Arabian Nights.&quot; Again according to her autobiography, at the age of seven she wrote and self-published multiple collections of poetry. This period of her life ended when her father died in 1832, leaving her mother as a widow with ten children to raise.

Mr. Larcom&#x27;s death coincided with the rise of the Industrial Revolution in Lowell. The Lowell Mills were hiring young women as factory workers and older women to run the boarding houses where the Lowell Mill Girls lived. Mrs. Larcom found employment as a boarding house supervisor while Lucy and her siblings found employment in the mills. While in Lowell, she helped her mother with household work in the intervals between her hours of school and work.

==Career==
===Lowell Mill Girl===

At age eleven, in 1835, she began working at Boott Mills, a cotton mill in Lowell, as a doffer, to earn extra money for her family. She was among the very youngest of those employed at the mills. Her first work as a Lowell operative was in a spinning-room, doffing and replacing the bobbins, after which she tended a spinning-frame and then a dressing-frame, while looking out windows towards the river. Later, she was employed in a &quot;cloth-room,&quot; considered to be a more agreeable working-place because of its fewer hours of confinement, its cleanliness, and the absence of machinery. The last two years of her Lowell life, which covered in all a period of about ten years, were spent in that room, not in measuring cloth, but as bookkeeper, recording the number of pieces and bales. There, she pursued her studies during leisure moments, some textbooks in mathematics, grammar, English or German literature usually laying open on her desk.

Here, as in her earlier childhood, she put words to her visions through verses and by telling herself stories. Of those days, Larcom stated,— &quot;While yet a child, I used to consider it special good fortune that my home was at Lowell. There was a frank friendliness and sincerity in the social atmosphere that wrought upon me unconsciously, and made the place pleasant to live in. People moved about their every-day duties with purpose and zest, and were genuinely interested in one another; while in the towns on the seaboard it sometimes was as if every man&#x27;s house was his castle in almost a feudal sense, where the family shut themselves in, on the defensive against intruders.&quot; Still, she never lost her love and allegiance to the seaside area where she was born, while frequent visits kept up the charm, and gave her links to her home town.
The ten years that Larcom spent at the mills made a huge impact on her. The &quot;Lowell Offering&quot;, a magazine whose editors and contributors were &quot;female operatives in the Lowell mills,&quot; was published 1839–1845, and soon after it was launched Larcom became one of its corps of writers. One of her first poems was entitled &quot;The River,&quot; and many of her verses and essays were found in its volumes. Some of those &quot;Lowell Offering&quot; essays appeared afterwards in &quot;Similitudes&quot;, her first published work.

It was at one of the meetings of the literary circle, established among the &quot;mill girls&quot;, that Larcom first met the poet, John Greenleaf Whittier, who was then in Lowell editing a Free Soil journal. He became her friend, showing his real interest in her at once by criticising her share in the written contributions of the evening. She was then very young, but it was the beginning of an interest and gratitude that continued mutually in an established friendship. Afterward, when she had come to know and dearly love Whittier&#x27;s sister, Elizabeth (&quot;Lizzie&quot;), the three spent time together. During happy sojourns at Salisbury Beach, near the respective homes at Amesbury and Beverly, in visits at Amesbury, in counsel and work together, out of which in recent time have grown the beautiful compilations of &quot;Child-life&quot;, and &quot;Songs of Three Centuries&quot;, their lives ran near together and contributed the one to the other.

===Illinois===
One after another, Larcom&#x27;s sisters married out of the home, until only two remained. At about twenty years of age, Larcom accompanied the oldest of the Larcom sisters in Lowell, Emeline, to the then wild prairies of Illinois. Here, she shared in the efforts of a clergyman&#x27;s household in pioneer times. A truly pioneer life was theirs as they moved many times from place to place, dependent upon who summoned the clergyman. Somewhere in this prairie Larcom taught school in a vacated log building to a neighborhood. Her students came from small colonies within this radius. It was in the corner of a big township which included three counties. She taught under the auspices of a district committee, before whom, previous to induction to office, the candidate was obliged to hold up her right hand and swear to acquaintance, sufficient to instruct from, with writing, spelling, arithmetic, and geography. Her salary was for three months; and once, when the time for payment arrived, and her brother-in-law visited the committee-man whose duty it was to make it, his reminder was met with the rather startled remark, as if the subject had never presented itself in so strong a light before:— &quot;Forty dollars! Well, that&#x27;s a lot o&#x27; money to pay a young woman for three months&#x27; teaching&#x27;! She oughta know considerable!&quot; When the official was reassured by a statement of what Larcom&#x27;s antecedents in study and achievement had been, he replied:— &quot;Well, that&#x27;s a good deal for her to ha&#x27; done!&quot; before handing over the money.

During another sojourning, Larcom found herself in the neighborhood of an excellent young ladies&#x27; school. Switching from teacher to scholar, she spent three years at Monticello Female Seminary, following the full course of study. During the last two years, she took charge of the preparatory department of that institution.

===Back to Beverly===
Eventually, Larcom tired of life in the west, so she went back to Beverly, where, for a year or two, she taught a class of young ladies before accepting a position as teacher in Wheaton Female Seminary, at Norton. She remained there for six years, conducting classes in rhetoric, English literature, and composition, while sometimes adding history, mental and moral science, or botany. Larcom&#x27;s health began after these few years to suffer from such a constant strain of teaching work that she had to relinquish regular employment, although, from time to time, she lectured upon literature, or taught classes in various young ladies&#x27; schools of Boston. 

Her first poem in the &quot;Atlantic&quot; was &quot;The Rose Enthroned&quot; and it is remembered as her greatest inspiration. It was a parable-epic of creation with twenty-one four-line stanzas. Previously to this,— as far back as during her early residence in Illinois,— some poems were published with the name, and some slight sketch of the writer, in Griswold&#x27;s &quot;Female Poets of America&quot;; and at about the same time, verses of hers were printed in &quot;Sartain&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. During 1852–53, she wrote frequently for the &quot;National Era&quot;, of which Mr. Whittier was corresponding editor. Later, the &quot;Independent&quot; and the &quot;Boston Congregationalist&quot;, and various other magazines received and published her contributions. &quot;Hannah Binding Shoes&quot; appeared first in the New York &quot;Crayon&quot;; perhaps no single poem of hers was better known or more admired. When &quot;Our Young Folks&quot; magazine was started, Larcom became one of its assistant editors. Subsequently, for a year or two, she was the leading editor. For the next seven years, she lived quietly and independently at Beverly Farms.

In the spirit of ministry, she gathered together the compilation of &quot;Breathings of a Better Life&quot;. &quot;Roadside Poems&quot;, and &quot;Hillside and Seaside&quot;, were compilations from readings of nature. &quot;Childlife&quot;, &quot;Childlife in Prose&quot;, and &quot;Songs of Three Centuries&quot;, were pulled together in company with Whittier, and which he edited. The volume, &quot;Wild Roses of Cape Ann&quot; came after these.

Larcom served as a model for the change in women&#x27;s roles in society. She was a friend of Harriet Hanson Robinson, who worked in the Lowell mills at the same time. Robinson also became a poet and author; later, she was prominent in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. Both contributed to the literary magazine &quot;Lowell Offering&quot;.

==Death and legacy==

Larcom died at age 69 on April 17, 1893, in Boston and was buried in her hometown of Beverly, Massachusetts. Her influence is still felt in Beverly. A local literary magazine entitled &quot;The Larcom Review&quot; is named for her, as is the library at the Beverly High School. A theatre built in Beverly in 1912 was named the Larcom Theatre Music and Performing Arts after Larcom as well. 

Larcom Mountain, located in the Ossipee Mountains in New Hampshire, is named after her, as she frequented the area during the late 1800s. At Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts, the Larcom Dormitory is named after her. Rushlight Literary Magazine, which she founded, is still in publication today. Larcom&#x27;s legacy is honored in Lowell, Massachusetts, where she worked as a &quot;mill girl&quot; at the Boott Mills, and as such, the Lucy Larcom Park was named after her to honor her works of literature that recounted her life at the mills. The park is located between the two Lowell High School buildings, and excerpts from her writings can be found on monuments, statues and other works of art throughout the park.

==Style and themes==
Larcom&#x27;s later writings, assumed a deeply religious tone, in which the faith of her whole life found complete expression. In retrospection, she wrote &quot;Idyl of Work&quot;. Notwithstanding the fact that she really meant to set forth the image she had in her mind of her own elder sister, she unconsciously gave herself also, perhaps, through family likeness, in some touches of her portrayal of &quot;Esther&quot; in the &quot;Idyl&quot;. In her &quot;Idyl of Work&quot; and also in &quot;A New England Girlhood&quot;, Larcom described her early life. In the &quot;Idyl&quot;, the mill-life of forty or fifty years earlier was portrayed.

<doc id="892273" wikidata="Q8035647" url="?curid=892273" title="World Diamond Council">
<text>The World Diamond Council is an organization representing the entire diamond value chain including representatives from diamond mining, manufacturing, trading and retail. The council was established in July 2000. The purpose was to create a system to keep the supply chain of diamonds as free as possible from conflict diamonds.

In December 2000, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution supporting the creation of an international certification scheme for rough diamonds. By November 2002, negotiations between governments, the international diamond industry and civil society organisations resulted in the creation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS). The KPCS document sets out the requirements for controlling rough diamond production and trade. The KPCS entered into force in 2003, when participating countries started to implement its rules.

The KPCS is credited as being instrumental toward dramatically reducing “conflict diamonds” to less than 1% of the world&#x27;s diamond production today.

The World Diamond Council has representation on all the Kimberley Process&#x27;s working groups and is influential in determining its implementation and future reform.

The council was set up in July 2000 in Antwerp, Belgium after a joint meeting of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses (WFDB), representing all the world&#x27;s significant diamond trading centres, and the International Diamond Manufacturers Association (IDMA), representing significant manufacturers. The founding president was Eli Izhakoff, who served in the position until July 2013.

Charter members are the WFDB, the IDMA and International Confederation of Jewellers (CIBJO).

The council, headquartered in the US, is currently led by President Edward Asscher from Amsterdam, Netherlands.

<doc id="892276" wikidata="Q378629" url="?curid=892276" title="John Lindley">
<text>John Lindley FRS (5 February 1799 – 1 November 1865) was an English botanist, gardener and orchidologist.

==Early years==
Born in Catton, near Norwich, England, John Lindley was one of four children of George and Mary Lindley. George Lindley was a nurseryman and pomologist and ran a commercial nursery garden. Although he had great horticultural knowledge, the undertaking was not profitable and George lived in a state of indebtedness. As a boy he would assist in the garden and also collected wild flowers he found growing in the Norfolk countryside. Lindley was educated at Norwich School. He would have liked to go to university or to buy a commission in the army but the family could not afford either. He became Belgian agent for a London seed merchant in 1815.

At this time Lindley became acquainted with the botanist William Jackson Hooker who allowed him to use his botanical library and who introduced him to Sir Joseph Banks who offered him employment as an assistant in his herbarium. His first publication, in 1819, a translation of the &quot;Analyse du fruit&quot; of L. C. M. Richard, was followed in 1820 by an original &quot;Monographia Rosarum&quot;, with descriptions of new species, and drawings executed by himself, then in 1821 by &quot;Monographia Digitalium&quot;, and &quot;Observations on Pomaceae&quot;, which were both contributed to the Linnean Society.

==Career==

Lindley went to work at Banks&#x27; house in London. He concentrated on the genera &quot;Rosa&quot; and &quot;Digitalis&quot; and published the monograph &quot;A Botanical History of Roses&quot; which distinguished seventy-six species, describes thirteen new ones and was illustrated by nineteen coloured plates painted by himself. He became acquainted with Joseph Sabine who grew a large assortment of roses and was the Secretary of the Horticultural Society of London. His employment came to an abrupt end with the death of Banks a few months later. One of Banks&#x27; friends, a wealthy merchant called William Cattley, paid Lindley to draw and describe new plants in his garden at Barnet. He also paid for the publication of &quot;Digitalia Monographia&quot;. (Later Lindley honoured him by naming the orchid genus &quot;Cattleya&quot; after him.) In 1820, at the age of twenty-one, Lindley was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society of London.

From 1821 to 1826 he published a folio work with coloured illustrations that he had painted himself, &quot;Collectanea botanica or Figures and botanic Illustrations of rare and curious exotic Plants&quot;. Many of these plants came from the family Orchidaceae with which he had a lifelong fascination.

Lindley was appointed assistant secretary to the Royal Horticultural Society and its new garden at Chiswick in 1822, where he supervised the collection of plants.

Assistant secretary to the Horticultural Society since 1822, in 1829 Lindley was appointed to the chair of botany at University College, London, which he retained until 1860. He also lectured on botany from 1831 at the Royal Institution, including delivering the 1833 Royal Institution Christmas Lecture, and from 1836 at the Chelsea Physic Garden, starting the society&#x27;s flower show in the late 1830s.Lindley described the plants collected on Thomas Livingstone Mitchell&#x27;s expeditions of 1838 and wrote an Appendix to &quot;Edwards&#x27;s Botanical Register&quot; of 1839, describing plants collected by James Drummond and Georgiana Molloy of the Swan River Colony in Western Australia. According to John Ryan, Lindley&#x27;s 1840 &#x27;Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony&#x27; provided &#x27;the most succinct portrait to date of the flora of the Swan River Settlement&#x27;, which had been established in 1829. The Sketch, which was published during November 1839 and January 1840 in Edwards&#x27; Botanical Register and separately on its completion, was illustrated by nine hand-coloured lithographs and four wood-cuts. He also played a large part in having Charles Moore appointed as Director of the Sydney Botanical Gardens.

During his professorship, he wrote many scientific and popular works as well as making significant contributions to the &quot;Botanical Register&quot;, of which he was the editor for many years, and to &quot;The Gardeners&#x27; Chronicle&quot;, which he co-founded with Joseph Paxton, William Bradbury and Wentworth Dilke, and where he was in charge of the horticultural department from 1841. He was a fellow of the Royal, Linnean and Geological Societies. He received the Royal Society&#x27;s royal medal in 1857, and in 1853 became a corresponding member of the Institut de France. In 1862, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

===Horticultural Society of London===
About this time, the Horticultural Society of London, which became the Royal Horticultural Society at a later date, asked Lindley to draw roses and in 1822 he became the Assistant Secretary of the Society&#x27;s garden. The Society&#x27;s historian, Harold R Fletcher, later described him as &quot; ... the backbone of the Society and possibly the greatest servant it had ever had.&quot; Now with a steady income, in 1823 he married Sarah Freestone (1797–1869). They rented a house in rural Acton Green, a location convenient for the Society&#x27;s garden at Turnham Green.

The Secretary of the Horticultural Society of London at that time was Joseph Sabine and he authorised expenditure on large projects beyond the Society&#x27;s means. Lindley could only expostulate and was unsuccessful in moderating his actions. By 1830, the Society had mounting debts and a committee of enquiry was set up. Sabine resigned as Secretary and Lindley successfully defended his own position and carried the Society forward with the new Honorary Secretary, George Bentham.

==Middle years==
An eminent botanist of the time, John Claudius Loudon, sought Lindley&#x27;s collaboration on his &quot;Encyclopedia of Plants&quot;. This covered nearly fifteen thousand species of flowering plants and ferns. It was a massive undertaking and Lindley was responsible for most of it.

During his labour on this undertaking, which was completed in 1829, and through arduous study of character patterns, he became convinced of the superiority of the &quot;natural&quot; classification system devised by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu – a system that he believed reflected the great plan of nature as distinct from the &quot;artificial&quot; system of Linnaeus followed in the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Plants&quot;. This conviction found expression in &quot;A Synopsis of British Flora, arranged according to the Natural Order&quot; (1829) and in &quot;An Introduction to the Natural System of Botany&quot; (1830).

In 1828 Lindley was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London and in 1833 was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Munich. Other honours came from France, the United States and Switzerland.

In 1829 Lindley sought to augment his income and became professor of botany at the newly established London University while still continuing his post at the Royal Horticultural Society. He had not been to university himself but apparently was an excellent teacher, giving six hour-long lectures each week. Being dissatisfied with what was available, he wrote some botanical textbooks for his students.

After the death of Joseph Banks and the death also of their patron, King George III, the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew went into a decline. The Government commissioned a report on their future to be prepared by Lindley, Joseph Paxton and John Wilson, head gardener to the Earl of Surrey. The report recommended that the Gardens be retained but the Government did not accept their findings and proposed to abolish it, distribute the plants and pull down the glasshouses. On 11 February 1840, Lindley told the Prime Minister that the matter was to be raised in Parliament. This caused an outcry. The public was indignant, the Government backed down and the Gardens were saved. William Hooker was appointed to be the new Director.

In 1845, Lindley was part of a scientific commission set up by the Government to investigate potato blight and the Irish famine. The cause of the fungal disease was not known at the time and the weather was thought to be to blame. Although the commission was powerless to solve the problem, their report brought about the repeal of the 1815 Corn Laws which had forbidden the import of cheap wheat from America. This helped to alleviate the effects of the disease on populations that had become reliant on the monoculture of potatoes. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1859.

Lindley was very industrious and published a number of works including &quot;The Genera and Species of Orchidaceous Plants&quot;, the writing of which occupied him for ten years. He was acknowledged to be the top authority on the classification of orchids of his time. Bentham and Hooker, writing in 1883, accepted 114 genera he had named and described, and Pfitzer, in 1889, accepted 127. Over many years, Lindley had described a large number of orchid species, and many other plants, naming them and giving each a concise description of the plant&#x27;s characteristics.

He was held in high regard by other botanists and was honoured by naming more than 200 species with the epithets &quot;&quot;lindleyi&quot;, &quot;lindleyana&quot;, &quot;lindleyanum&quot;, &quot;lindleyanus&quot;, &quot;lindleya&quot; and &quot;lindleyoides&quot;&quot;.

==Later years==
In 1861, Lindley took charge of organising the exhibits from the British colonies for the International Exhibition at South Kensington. This was exhausting work and seems to have taken a toll on his health. His memory also began deteriorating. He resigned his university professorship that year and his position as Secretary to the Royal Horticultural Society two years later.

In 1863, he travelled to Vichy, a spa in the center of France, but his health continued to decline. He died at his home at Acton Green, near London, aged 66. He was survived by his wife, two daughters including Sarah Lindley Crease and a son. The daughters were accomplished artists themselves and the son, Nathaniel, became a distinguished lawyer, the Master of the Rolls and a life peer.

<doc id="892278" wikidata="Q7443127" url="?curid=892278" title="Second Battle of the Stronghold">
<text>The Second Battle of the Stronghold (a.k.a. Lava Beds) was a battle during the Modoc War between a band of the Native American Modoc tribe and the Army of the United States, in northeastern California. The battle began on April 15, 1873, and ended on April 17, 1873. The Army succeeded in forcing the Modoc to abandon their fortified position at Captain Jack&#x27;s Stronghold in the Lava Beds, but failed to capture the band.

==Background==
Following the assassination of Major General Edward Canby and another member of a peace delegation during a peace conference on April 11, 1873, the Army, under the command of Colonel Alvan Gillem, made preparations to attack the Stronghold.

==Fighting==
On April 15 a general attack began, troops advancing from Gillem&#x27;s camp on the west and Mason&#x27;s camp at Hospital Rock, northeast of the Stronghold. Fighting continued throughout the day, the troops remaining in position during the night. Each advance of troops on the 16th was under heavy fire from the Modoc positions. That night the troops succeeded in cutting the Modoc off from their water supply at the shore of Tule Lake. By the morning of April 17 everything was in readiness for the final attack on the Stronghold. When the order was given to advance, the troops charged into the Stronghold.

After the fighting along the shoreline of Tule Lake on the afternoon and night of April 16, the Modocs defending the Stronghold realized that their water supply had been cut off by the troops commanding the shoreline. On April 17, before the troops had received the order to charge the Stronghold, the Modoc escaped through a crevice left unguarded during a movement of troops from one position to another.

==Casualties==
During the fighting at the Stronghold, April 15–17, casualties included one officer and six enlisted men killed, and thirteen enlisted men wounded. The only Modoc casualty was a boy, reported to have been killed when a cannonball, which he was attempting to open with an axe, exploded. Several Modoc women were reported to have died from sickness.

<doc id="892279" wikidata="Q550302" url="?curid=892279" title="Nicolas de Largillière">
<text>Nicolas de Largillière (; baptised 10 October 1656 – 20 March 1746) was a French painter and draughtsman.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Largillière was baptised at the in Paris on 10 October 1656. The son of a merchant hatmaker, his family moved to Antwerp when Largillière was around three years old. Following a trip to London, Largillière&#x27;s father apprenticed him to the Flemish painter Anton Goubau. However, he left at the age of eighteen and again went to England, where he was befriended and employed by Sir Peter Lely for four years at Windsor, Berkshire. While there, Largillière also worked under the direction of Italian painter Antonio Verrio.

===Painting career===

====Early career====
His painting caught the attention of Charles II, who wished to retain Largillière in his service, but the controversy aroused by the Rye House Plot against Roman Catholics alarmed Largillière. He left for Paris, where he was well received by the public as a painter.

Upon ascending to the throne in 1685, James II requested Largillière to return to England. James II offered Largillière the office of keeper of the royal collections, but he declined due to being uneasy about Rye House Plot. However, during a short stay in London, he painted portraits of the king, the queen Mary of Modena, and the prince of Wales James Francis Edward Stuart. The portrait of the Prince of Wales could not have been painted during Largillière&#x27;s stay in London because the prince was not born until 1688. The three portraits painted by Largillière of the prince in his youth must have been executed in Paris, where he returned sometime before March 1686. The portrait of King James II was painted in 1686. King James is portrayed in golden armor with a white cravat and is positioned in front of a watercolour-like background set in a round frame.

====French Academy====
In 1686, Largillière produced a portrait of the painter Charles Le Brun for admittance to the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture. The portrait shows Le Brun, then the chairman of the academy, at work on an entombment, surrounded by classical busts and figurines scattered upon the floor and table within the picture. Le Brun, impressed by Largillière&#x27;s portrait, accepted him to the academy. In 1690, Largillière was documented by the French Academy as a historical painter, which was a prominent artistic trend of the academy.

In 1693, Largillière painted the Governor of Arras, Pierre de Montesquiou, to celebrate his promotion to brigadier in 1691.

In 1694, Largillière&#x27;s made a multi-figure work that is displayed in the church of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont.

In 1709, Largillière painted the royal family portrait of &quot;The Family of Louis XIV&quot;. This portrait shows King Louis XIV, Madame de Ventadour (governess of the children of the Duke of Burgundy), the 3-year old Louis, Duke of Brittany (1707–1712), Louis, Grand Dauphin and Louis, Duke of Burgundy, future dauphin. The King displays a sense of slight uneasiness unlike the other figures especially. In the painting, Largillière used the Renaissance technique of structured disposition.

A year later, Largillière painted a self-portrait which also contained two female members of his family.

Following the death of &quot;directeur&quot; Louis de Boullogne on 28 November 1733, the painter Hyacinthe Rigaud proposed that the four rectors of the Académie, Largillière, Claude-Guy Hallé, Guillaume Coustou, and himself, rotate the post. This oligarchy would persist until the election of Coustou as sole director on 5 February 1735. Largillière became director in 1738 and remained in that position until 1742.

====Later career====

Towards the end of his life, Largillière painted a repetition of anonymous male portraits of Parisian nobles. One example was painted in 1710, of a man standing with spread fingers that conceal a letter held in the other hand. Another portrait from about 1715 shows a frontal three quarter view of a man dressed in similar clothes and wig with a Doric column in the background.

In 1714, Largillière painted King Augustus II of Poland. Largillière also painted the artist Jacques-Antoine Arlaud in a red robe in a similar fashion to Largillière&#x27;s portrait of the painter Charles Le Brun, as well as the sculptor Nicolas Couston. Around the next year, Largillière painted &quot;The Study of Different Types of Hands&quot;, which currently resides in the Louvre.

In 1718, Largillière painted the French poet and essayist Voltaire.

&quot;The Entry of Christ into Jerusalem&quot; was a landscape painting that Largillière painted in 1720.

Largillière made his last self-portrait in 1725. This portrait displays the artist at his easel staring toward the audience.

Largillière was appointed as chancellor of the French Academy in 1743.

===Death===
Nicolas de Largillière died on 20 March 1746 at the age of 89. Upon his death, he donated to France several small landscapes and still life pictures he had created.

===Legacy===
The Ashmolean Museum (University of Oxford), the Fitzwilliam Museum (University of Cambridge), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Louvre, the National Gallery of Art (Washington D.C.), the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art (Kansas City, Missouri), the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg and Pinacoteca di Brera (Milan), Calouste Gulbenkian Museum, Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga (Lisbon), Museum de Fundatie (Zwolle), the Detroit Institute of Arts (Detroit) and the Speed Art Museum (Louisville) are among the public collections holding works by Nicolas de Largillière.

Jean-Baptiste Oudry and Jacob van Schuppen, Largillière&#x27;s pupil and nephew respectively, were also rococo painters.

<text>The Sikorsky S-76 is a medium-size commercial utility helicopter designed and produced by the American helicopter manufacturer Sikorsky Aircraft. It is the company&#x27;s first helicopter specifically developed for the civilian market.

The S-76 was developed during the mid-1970s, originally being designated &quot;S-74&quot; but renamed in honor of the U.S. Bicentennial. Drawing upon its recently-developed S-70 helicopter, it features twin turboshaft engines, four-bladed main and tail rotors, and retractable landing gear. On , the prototype performed its maiden flight. The initial production variant was the S-76A, the first deliveries of which took place on . Several improved models were produced over time, including the S-76 Mk II launched in 1982, and the S-76B in 1987. Development of the S-76D was particularly troubled, being delayed by four years of delays due to flight envelope issues; it was finally certified for operation on .

The S-76 initially encountered strong demand from the off-shore oil drilling industry; later on, demand shifted towards the VIP sector of the market. It performed several noteworthy flights, such as the first circumnavigation of the world in an east-to-west direction by a helicopter, and an autonomous demonstration flight during 2016. Sikorsky also used individual helicopters, often heavily modified for the purpose, for experimental purposes and to support other programmes. Demand for the S-76 waned during the 2010s, as newer helicopters such as the AgustaWestland AW139 proved to be stiff competition. During March 2022, Sikorsky halted new orders for the S-76, but stated that it was looking at opportunities for future overseas manufacturing with foreign partners.

==Development==
The development of the S-76 commenced during the mid-1970s as the &quot;S-74&quot;. The S-74 was subsequently redesignated the S-76 in honor of the U.S. Bicentennial. The company had set the design goal of producing a medium helicopter suitable for corporate transportation and the oil drilling industry. Sikorsky&#x27;s design work on the S-70 helicopter (which was selected for use by the United States Army as the UH-60 Black Hawk) was utilized in the development of the S-76, incorporating S-70 design technology in its rotor blades and rotor heads. It was the first Sikorsky helicopter designed purely for commercial rather than military use. Despite this, Sikorsky planned to design it to conform with either the relevant FAR or military standards, whichever was more stringent, with the goal being the production of a rugged civil helicopter which could be used &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; for military purposes. 

 It was announced on 19 January 1975, before it had even been designed and Sikorsky began taking contracts; they would use these already signed operators for market research during development. The intended engine had also not yet been designed and was to be purpose-built alongside the S-76. Prototype construction began May 1976, with the first flight scheduled for May 1977, and deliveries scheduled to commence July 1978. On , two months ahead of schedule, the prototype performed its maiden flight. On , initial US Federal Aviation Administration type certification was granted, while the first customer delivery took place on . During late 1978, the S-76 was officially named &quot;Spirit&quot;, however, this name was officially dropped by Sikorsky on , reportedly due to translation issues into some foreign languages.

The first production variant was the S-76A. Several improved models were produced over time. During 1982, the S-76 Mk II, equipped with more powerful engines and other refinements, was introduced. In 1987, production of the S-76B, powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6B-36A and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6B-36B engines; it was capable to attaining a maximum speed of at sea level. By early 2001, in excess of 500 S-76s had been delivered.

During the early 2000s, the S-76C+ was the main version in production; it was equipped with twin Turbomeca Arriel 2S1 engines with FADEC and a Honeywell EFIS suite. This version also incorporated active noise suppression, vibration dampers and a composite main rotor. On , the S-76 C++ replaced earlier versions in production; it is powered by twin Turbomeca Arriel 2S2 engines and incorporates an improved and quieter transmission as well as minor changes in the interior equipment and avionics. By January 2006, Sikorsky had secured 92 orders for this model.

Development of the follow-on S-76D was subject to four years of delays due to technical problems in expanding the flight envelope. On , the prototype conducted its first flight, and type certification was initially expected during 2011 while deliveries were forecast to start at the end of that year. The FAA issued certification on . Three prototypes were used in the certification program, with one aircraft used to certify the optional rotor electric ice-protection system. The &quot;D&quot; model is powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW210S engines driving composite rotors and incorporates active vibration control. Performance is substantially improved with the added power, but initial certification retains the same gross weight and maximum cruise speed as earlier models.

The rate of manufacturing noticeably declined during the 2010s; only a dozen S-76s were delivered between 2016 and 2020. During September 2013, it was announced that the Chinese manufacturer Changhe Aircraft Industries Corporation had been contracted to produce the S-76D airframe. By 2022 April, in excess of 875 S-76s had reportedly been built.

During March 2022, Sikorsky announced that it had halted new orders for the S-76 while potential overseas manufacturing partners and licensing opportunities were being evaluated. Reasons for the hold included decreasing sales volume, the high cost of supply and manufacturing, and the prohibitive costs associated with adapting the S-76 to meet increasing safety mandates. This move effectively ended production of the S-76 following the completion of the three orders that were outstanding, and represented a withdrawal by Sikorsky from the medium commercial helicopter market. Sikorsky has stated that it will continue to actively manufacture spare parts for the S-76 at its Connecticut facility.

==Design==
The S-76 is of a conventional configuration, with a four-bladed fully articulated main rotor and a four-bladed anti-torque rotor on the port side of the tailboom. It is powered by a pair of turboshaft engines, which are located above the passenger cabin. On the prototypes and initial production aircraft, these engines were Allison 250-C30s, a variant of the popular Allison 250 engine that was developed specially for the S-76l it had a single-stage centrifugal compressor instead of the multi-stage axial/centrifugal compressor of earlier models of the engine, rated at for takeoff. These engines are connected to the main rotor by the main gearbox, a three-stage unit with a bull gear as its final stage, rather than the planetary gear that had been used by previous generations of Sikorsky helicopters. This arrangement has 30% fewer parts and lower costs than a more conventional design.

The main rotor is furnished with a single piece aluminum hub fitted with elastomeric bearings, which are designed not to require lubrication or any other kind of maintenance throughout its design life. The main rotor blades have titanium spars and incorporate a ten degree twist to provide an even loading when hovering, while they use a non-symmetrical airfoil section with a drooped leading edge. The rotor tips are tapered and swept back. The rotor blades on later-build S-76s feature ice protection measures. The flight controls are servo-assisted and have a Stability Augmentation System fitted. A retractable nosewheel undercarriage is fitted, the reduced drag from this arrangement is credited with increasing the S-76A&#x27;s cruising speed by . Emergency flotation gear can be fitted, which uses helium-filled bags to increase buoyancy in the event of a forced landing on water.

The fuselage of the S-76 is made from both metal and composite materials; while the nose is composed of fiberglass, the cabin area primarily employs a light alloy honeycomb structure, the semi-monocoque tailboom is also constructed of light alloy. A pair of pilots are typically seated in a side-by-side arrangement in the cockpit, situated ahead of the cabin, which can accommodate a further 12 passengers in three rows of four, or between four and eight passengers in a more luxurious executive seating configuration. Later models can be flown by a single pilot when provisioned with an appropriately configured cockpit. The S-76 was not originally designed with crashworthy fuel systems, leading to difficulties continuing production after an FAA requirement was implemented in April 2020.

==Operational history==
Early on in its commercial career, the S-76 became popular for offshore operations, such as to oil rigs. Numerous operators have either purchased or leased the type specifically to operate in this sector.

During 1982, the S-76A set multiple class records for range, climb, speed and ceiling. In June 1995, the S-76 became the first helicopter to circumnavigate the world in an east-to-west direction, piloted by the Australian adventurer Dick Smith.

Several airlines have operated the S-76A on scheduled services, including Helijet Airways of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

During the campaigning in the run up to the 2005 United Kingdom general election, both the Labour and the Conservative parties dispensed with conventional &#x27;battle buses&#x27; in favour of S-76 helicopters to quickly transport their leaders around the British Isles. According to Jason Lambert, Sikorsky&#x27;s vice president of commercial and military systems, the S-76 had proven itself to be particularly popular amongst VIP customers. By 2020, according to Sikorsky, ten countries operated S-76s to carry their heads of state.

S-76s have been periodically used to test new technologies and capabilities. The highly-modified S-76 SHADOW (Sikorsky Helicopter Advance Demonstrator of Operators Workload) was built to demonstrate its advanced cockpit for single-pilot operations and to study the human engineering interface between the pilot and the cockpit controls and displays; this was in aid of the RAH-66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter programme. During the 2010s, an S-76 was configured for autonomous operation and demonstrated this ability in June 2016, flying for a distance of around 30 miles (48 km) with no human intervention beyond limited inputs made via a tablet computer, the take off and landing phases were also performed autonomously.

During the 2010s, many S-76 operators elected to replace the type with newer medium-lift rotorcraft, such as the AgustaWestland AW139. In early 2020, it was observed that, while the S-76D was no longer compliant with FAA regulations to permit its sale to US-based customers, sales were still possible to several other countries.

:A militarised variant suitable for naval operations, based on the S-76B, it was announced during 1985 but none were ever sold.

===Experimental derivatives===

;Sikorsky S-75: The Advanced Composite Airframe Program (ACAP) was an all-composite Sikorsky early LHX proof of concept aircraft. Designated S-75, it mated a new composite airframe with S-76 engines, rotors and powertrain components.
;Sikorsky S-76 SHADOW: Boeing-Sikorsky MANPRINT study. The original concept of the LHX program was to produce a one-man helicopter that could do more than a two-man aircraft. The Sikorsky (S-76) Helicopter Advance Demonstrator of Operators Workload (SHADOW) had a single-pilot advanced cockpit grafted to its nose. The purpose was to study the MANPRINT or human engineering interface between the pilot and the cockpit controls and displays. The cockpit was the prototype of a single-pilot cockpit designed for use on the prototype RAH-66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter. The cockpit was designed so sensors would feed data to the pilot through helmet-mounted displays. The MANPRINT study determined that single-pilot operation of the Comanche was unsafe, and would result in pilot overload. As result of this study, the Comanche was designed to be operated by a crew of two.

<doc id="892294" wikidata="Q77131" url="?curid=892294" title="Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius">
<text>Carl Friedrich Philipp (Karl Friedrich Philipp) von Martius (17 April 1794 – 13 December 1868) was a German botanist and explorer. Between 1817 and 1820, he travelled 10,000 km through Brazil while collecting botanical specimens. His most important work was a comprehensive flora of Brazil, &quot;Flora Brasiliensis&quot;, which he initiated in 1840 and was completed posthumously in 1906.

==Life==
Martius was born at Erlangen, the son of Prof Ernst Wilhelm Martius, court apothecary.

He graduated PhD from Erlangen University in 1814, publishing as his thesis a critical catalogue of plants in the university&#x27;s botanical garden. After that he continued to devote himself to botanical study, and in 1817 he and Johann Baptist von Spix were sent to Brazil by Maximilian I Joseph, the king of Bavaria. They travelled from Rio de Janeiro through several of the southern and eastern provinces of Brazil and travelled up the Amazon River to Tabatinga, as well as exploring some of its larger tributaries.

On his return to Europe in 1820 Martius was appointed as the keeper of the botanic garden at Munich, including the herbarium at the Munich Botanical Collection, and in 1826 as professor of botany in the university there, and he held both offices until 1864. He devoted his chief attention to the flora of Brazil, and in addition to numerous short papers he published the &quot;Nova Genera et Species Plantarum Brasiliensium&quot; (1823–1832, 3 vols.) and &quot;Icones selectae Plantarum Cryptogamicarum Brasiliensium&quot; (1827), both works being finely illustrated. He is credited for introducing the word in this latter work, referring to a specific layer of tissue in a lichen that his extensive microscopical work had revealed.

An account of his travels in Brazil appeared in three volumes between 1823 and 1831, with an atlas of plates, but probably the work by which he is best known is his &quot;Historia naturalis palmarum&quot; (1823–1850) in three large folio volumes, in which all known genera of the palm family are described and illustrated. The work contains more than 240 chromolithographs, with habitat sketches and botanical dissections. In 1840 he began the &quot;Flora Brasiliensis&quot;, with the assistance of the most distinguished European botanists, who undertook monographs of the various orders. Its publication was continued after his death under the editorship of A. W. Eichler (1839–1887) until 1887, and subsequently of Ignatz Urban. At completion, the &quot;Flora&quot; described almost 23,000 plants, of which 5,689 were new to science. He also edited several works on the zoological collections made in Brazil by Spix, after the death of the latter in 1826. In 1837, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

On the outbreak of potato disease in Europe he investigated it and published his observations in 1842. He also published works and short papers on the aborigines of Brazil, on their civil and social condition, on their past and probable future, on their diseases and medicines, and on the languages of the various tribes, especially the Tupi. He died at Munich; his gravestone is decorated with two palm fronds and the Latin inscription &quot;In palmis semper virens resurgo&quot;.

A species of South American snake, &quot;Hydrops martii&quot;, is named in his honor. The Martiusstraße in Munich is named after him.

He married (1801–1843). His son was German chemist, entrepreneur and company founder Carl Alexander von Martius (1838–1920).

In 2012, botanists Harley &amp; J.F.B.Pastore named a genus of flowering plants from Brazil and Peru, belonging to the family Lamiaceae as &quot;Martianthus&quot; in his honour.

His birthday, Apr 17, is International Palm Day, an observance by the International Palm Society to raise awareness of the conservation plight of palms.

==&quot;Herbarium Martii&quot;==
As well as a huge collection of flora specimens owned by Martius prior to his departure to South America, he returned with another 12,000 specimens which together formed the Herbarium Martii. At the time of his death the collection had been further expanded and comprised 300,000 specimens representing 65,000 species from around the world, and was one of the largest private herbaria assembled. Between 1837 and 1841 Martius published an exsiccata-like series with the title &quot;Herbarium florae Brasiliensis. Plantae Brasilienses exsiccatae, quas denominatas, partim diagnosi aut observationibus instructas botanophilis offert Dr. C. Fr. Ph. de Martius&quot;. 

The Belgian government acquired the collection in 1870 which formed the basis of the then newly established &quot;Jardin botanique de l&#x27;Etat&quot;. The collection is now held as part of the National Botanic Garden of Belgium.

The Martius Project is an effort by the Botanic Garden to digitize the entire collection.

Other herbaria also hold specimens collected by von Martius, including at the New York Botanical Gardens, the Kew Herbarium and National Herbarium of Victoria (MEL), Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria.

==Route followed in Brazil during 1817–1820 expedition==

Martius and Spix, accompanied by Johann Christian Mikan, his wife and the artist Thomas Ender travelled to Brazil with the Austrian Commission, which joined the wedding train of Archduchess Leopoldina of Austria and Dom Pedro de Alcantara, the future Emperor of Brazil. The party left from Trieste on 10 April 1817.

The first natural history collections were made in the city of Rio de Janeiro at Laranjeiras, Corcovado, Aqueduto, Fonte da Carioca, Tijuca, Botafogo, Jardim Botanico immediately following the wedding.

Spix and Martius then spent some days at &quot;Fazenda Mandioca&quot; with Grigori Ivanovitch Langsdorff and then went to a fazenda near Rio Paraiba before returning to Rio. A mounted expedition took them on horseback to Itaguaí (13 December 1817) through São Paulo state to the city of São Paulo where they arrived on 31 December 1817. They left on 9 January 1818 for Sorocaba and Itu on to Minas Gerais, then through Camanducaia to cross the Rio Sapucaí for São Gonçalo and Ouro Prêto. On 1 May 1818, they left for Diamantina, Minas Novas and then Montes Claros.
On 12 August 1818, they headed North-North East to Rio Carinhanha, as far as the Serra Geral then returned by Codó to Carinhanha arriving at Rio de Contas on 17 October 1818, then riding east to cross the Rio Paraguaçu arriving at Salvador on 10 November 1818, and leaving on 18 February 1819 via Coit and Jacobina. The party then travelled to Piauí, Oeiras where they arrived on 3 May. They departed on 11 May, arriving on 15 May at São Gonçalo do Amarante, where Martius became seriously ill. Spix had at this time contracted the schistosomiasis from which he eventually died.
On 3 June 1819, they arrived in Maranhão to replenish funds and supplies. They then sailed down the Rio Itapicuru to São Luis from where they left on 20 July for Belém, arriving there on 25 July, having collected specimens at several places in between. They left Belém on 21 August for an Amazon voyage, up the Tocantins to Breves, arriving in Gurupá on 9 September and Porto de Moz on the Rio Xingu on 10 September. They spent 19 September through 30th in Santarém, arriving at Barra do Rio Negro on 22 October and leaving on 2 November. They reached Tefé, then called Ega, on 26 November, then split up.

Spix left Tefé on 7 December 1819, for Solimões and visiting Tabatinga before returning to Manaus on 3 February 1820. He then travelled up the Rio Negro to Moura, Barcelos returning to Manaus on 26 February. Martius left Tefé on 12 December, ascended Rio Japurá, returning to Manaus on 11 March, where they reunited. They departed for Belém arriving on 16 April 1820, and left for Europe on 13 June 1820.

After this journey, Martius and Spix published their account of their travels and work in Brazil.
In the appendix, they included a piece of dance music, a lundu, the earliest example of this form of music recorded, now named &quot;Lundu: Recolhido por C.P.F. von Martius&quot;. A performance of this work by Orquestra e Coro Vox Brasiliensis &amp; Ricardo Kanji is included in their recording &quot;História da Música Brasileira – Período Colonial II&quot;.

<doc id="892307" wikidata="Q2928683" url="?curid=892307" title="Buses in London">
<text>Buses have been used as a mode of public transport in London since 1829, when George Shillibeer started operating a horse-drawn &quot;omnibus&quot; service from Paddington to the City of London. In the decades since their introduction, the red London bus has become a symbol of the city. In 2019, buses accounted for 11 per cent of trips taken in the city.

, London has 675 bus routes served by over 8,700 buses, almost all of which are operated by private companies under contract to (and regulated by) London Buses, part of the publicly-owned Transport for London. Over 1,400 buses in the fleet are battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell buses, the second largest zero emission bus fleet in Europe (behind Moscow). In 2006, London became one of the first major cities in the world to have an accessible, low floor bus fleet.

== History ==
Buses have been used on the streets of London since 1829, when George Shillibeer started operating his horse-drawn &quot;omnibus&quot; service from Paddington to the City. In 1850, Thomas Tilling started horse bus services, and in 1855 the London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) was founded to amalgamate and regulate the horse-drawn omnibus services then operating in London.

The LGOC began using motor omnibuses in 1902, and manufactured them itself from 1909. In 1904, Thomas Tilling started its first motor bus service. The last LGOC horse-drawn bus ran on 25 October 1911, although independent operators used them until 1914.

In 1909, Thomas Tilling and the LGOC entered into an agreement to pool their resources. The agreement restricted the expansion of Thomas Tilling in London, and allowed the LGOC to lead an amalgamation of most of London&#x27;s bus services. However, also in 1909, Thomas Clarkson started the National Steam Car Company to run steam buses in London in competition with the LGOC. In 1919, the National company reached agreement with the LGOC to withdraw from bus operation in London, and steam bus services ceased later that year.

Initially, buses in London were regulated with very limited oversight, licensed by the Police in a similar manner as taxicabs are licensed today, anyone could provide a bus service according to their best commercial judgement. After the First World War, many demobilised soldiers had learned to operate and maintain heavy vehicles like buses and established bus companies. In 1922, the Chocolate Express ran its first services, and many other independent operators entered the market until by 1924, the market was saturated with small independent bus companies which depressed patronage from established railways and larger bus companies – the worst affected being the London County Council&#x27;s tramways which ran at a deficit. Management&#x27;s efforts to control costs lead to a strike across the whole network, which was shortly followed by the major bus companies and railways in London.

Some of the bus operators in London included;

*Birch Brothers
*London Public Omnibus Company
*Orange Omnibus Company Ltd.
*Admiral Omnibus
*Premier Omnibus Company 
*Watford Omnibus

=== London Passenger Transport Board to London Regional Transport ===

In 1912, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), which at that time owned most of the London Underground, bought the LGOC. In 1933, the LGOC, along with the rest of the UERL, became part of the new London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). The name London General was replaced by London Transport, which became synonymous with the red London bus.

Bus numbers were first used in 1906. When the independent firms started in 1922, they used General route numbers, along with alphabetical suffixes to denote branch routes, so, for instance, the 36A ran parallel to the 36 for most of its route. In 1924, under the London Traffic Act, the Metropolitan Police was authorised to allocate route numbers, which all buses had to carry.

Under the direction of the Chief Constable responsible for traffic, A. E. Bassom, the LGOC were allocated numbers 1-199; the independent bus companies 200-299; country routes north of the Thames, working into the Metropolitan Police area, 300-399; country routes south of the Thames, working into the Metropolitan Police area, 400-499; Thames Valley routes working into the Met area, 500-510. All short, early morning, weekend or other special duties were to be given a suffix from the alphabet. To make way for these suffixes, previous suffix routes, denoting a branch, had to be renumbered in the one hundreds, so therefore, 36A became 136. Soon there were not enough route numbers and the police had to allocate 511-599 to the independents and 600-699 to the LGOC.

This ultimately led to chaos, and in the London Passenger Transport Act 1933 the power to allocate route numbers was taken away from the police and handed once again to professional busmen. Suffixes were gradually abolished over the decades, the last such route in London being the 77A, which became the 87 in June 2006.

The LPTB, under Lord Ashfield, assumed responsibility for all bus services in the London Passenger Transport Area, an area with a radius of about 30 miles from Central London. This included the London General country buses (later to be London Transport&#x27;s green buses), Green Line Coaches and the services of several Tilling Group and independent companies.

London buses continued to operate under the London Transport name from 1933 to 2000, although the political management of transport services changed several times. The LPTB oversaw transport from 1933 to 1947, when it was nationalised and became the London Transport Executive (1948 to 1962). The responsible authority for London Transport was then successively the London Transport Board (1963 to 1969), the Greater London Council (1970 to 1984) and London Regional Transport (1984 to 2000). However, in 1969, a new law transferred the green country services, outside the area of the Greater London Council, to the recently formed National Bus Company. Trading under the name London Country, the green buses and Green Line Coaches became the responsibility of a new NBC subsidiary, London Country Bus Services, on 1 January 1970.

Despite a comprehensive replacement of the bus fleet in the early 1950s, bus ridership fell dramatically – from 4.5 billion in 1950, to 3.1 billion by 1962 – while private car ownership rapidly increased. A seven day strike in 1958 and a fall in London&#x27;s population by over a million people exacerbated the fall in ridership.

A former network of express buses operated by London Transport in Central London was the Red Arrows. The routes, all numbered in the 500s, ran from main line stations to various locations in the West End and City. They were introduced in 1966 and expanded in 1968, but in the 1990s they were gradually phased out, with the last two routes withdrawn in 2023.

In 1974, Jill Viner became the first female bus driver for London Transport.

In 1979, the operation of London&#x27;s buses under the GLC was divided among eight areas or districts:

The districts were later reorganised and reduced to six (with the abolition of Tower and Watling), and, following the Transport Act of 1985, were done away with in 1989 with privatisation imminent.

=== Privatisation ===
In the 1980s the government of Margaret Thatcher decided to privatise the bus operating industry in Great Britain. At the time, local bus transport was dominated by London Transport in London, and in other major cities by large municipally owned operators, as well as by the government-owned National Bus Company and Scottish Bus Group elsewhere. The Transport Act 1985 brought about bus deregulation throughout Great Britain which opened up local bus operation to private operators and required municipal companies to operate independently of local government on a commercial basis.

However, the Transport Act 1985 did not apply in London – instead, the London Regional Transport Act 1984 required that an arms-length subsidiary company of London Transport called London Buses to be set up. London Buses would specify details of routes, fares and services levels, and the running of bus services would be contracted to private companies on a tendered basis. From 1985, bus routes were gradually tendered out to private companies, with London Buses split into business units from 1989. These business units were sold off in the private sector in the mid 1990s. Controversially, private operators were allowed to run buses in colours other than the traditional red. Following a campaign by tourism groups, tender specifications since 1997 specify that buses in London be 80% red.

Despite proposals from the Government in the 1990s to deregulate bus routes in London, the bus tendering regime is still in place today, with individual bus routes put out to competitive tendering by private companies. In 2024, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan pledged to bring bus routes back into public ownership as contracts expire.

=== Growth ===
In 2000, as part of the formation of the new Greater London Authority, the management of buses in London moved from the central government controlled London Regional Transport to the Mayor of London&#x27;s transport body, Transport for London (TfL). Upon appointment in 2000, the new Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone did not have the power to improve Tube service. Instead, investment was directed to increasing the number of, and the frequency of London&#x27;s bus routes, as well as introducing more bus lanes – assisted by income from the congestion charge. Flat fares were introduced in 2004, to speed boarding. From September 2005, under 16&#x27;s were able to ride buses for free.

Bus ridership subsequently rose rapidly, with a 19 per cent growth in passengers between 1999/00 and 2002/03, with ridership was at levels last seen in the late 1960s. Between 2000 and 2006, ridership growth was at 40 per cent in London, while ridership in the rest of the country fell by 6 per cent. The bus fleet grew to cope with demand, from around 5,500 buses to over 8,000. Traffic speeds across London improved, and levels of air pollution in central London decreased. By 2010, bus journeys in London had increased by 69 per cent since 2000, despite the growth rate in passengers slowing since the late 2000s.

From 2013 onwards, bus ridership fell slowly, with TfL blaming traffic congestion and roadworks, and some commentators blaming the introduction of Cycle Superhighways under Mayor Boris Johnson. The fall in ridership was mitigated by the introduction of the hopper fare in 2018, which allowed passengers to make multiple bus journeys within 1 hour. In 2019, buses accounted for 11% for daily trips in London.

== Vehicles ==
, the London Buses fleet total of 8,776 buses includes 3,826 hybrid buses, 1,397 battery electric buses, and 20 hydrogen fuel cell buses. The zero emission fleet is the largest in Europe, ahead of Moscow. All buses have been accessible and low floor since 2006, one of the first major cities in the world to achieve this.

The various bus operators operate a wide variety of vehicles, about the only immediately obvious common feature being their use of a largely red livery (mandatory since 1997). For each bus route, London Buses sets a specification for buses to be used, with the choice of particular vehicle that meets the specification left up to the operator. Particular examples of London Buses specification include the use of separate exit doors (increasingly unusual on buses in the United Kingdom outside London) and, on double-deckers, the use of a straight staircase. Additionally, London Buses has previously specified that vehicles operating in London use traditional printed roller destination blinds, whereas in most other parts of the country, electronic dot matrix or LED displays are the norm on new buses.

=== History ===
From the early days of motor bus operation by the London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) in the 1900s (decade) until the 1960s, London went its own way, designing its own vehicles specially for London use rather than using the bus manufacturers&#x27; standard products used elsewhere. The Associated Equipment Company (AEC) was created as a subsidiary of the LGOC in 1912 to build buses and other equipment for its parent company, and continued in the ownership of LGOC and its successors until 1962. Many of London&#x27;s local service buses over this period were built by AEC, although other manufacturers also built buses to London designs, or modified their own designs for use in London.

The last bus specifically designed for London was the AEC Routemaster, built between 1956 and 1968. Since then, buses built for London&#x27;s local services have all been variants of models built for general use elsewhere, although bus manufacturers would routinely offer a &#x27;London specification&#x27; to meet specific London requirements. Some manufacturers even went so far as to build new models with London in mind such as the Daimler Fleetline and Leyland Titan.

London did see the introduction of several of the newly emerging minibus and midibus models in the 1980s and 1990s, in a bid to up the frequency on routes, although the use of these buses dropped off to the level of niche operation on routes not suitable for full size buses.

==== Introduction of low floor buses ====
London was one of the earliest major users of low-floor buses, with the first low-floor single decker vehicles entering service in 1993 and the first low-floor double decker vehicles entering service in 1998. From 2002, the mainstay of the fleet, double-decker buses, were augmented with a fleet of articulated buses, rising to a peak fleet size of 393 Mercedes-Benz Citaros. These were introduced to help replace the (high-floor) AEC Routemaster, as well as to cope with an increased capacity. Following withdrawal of older, high floor vehicles, the bus fleet became fully accessible at the end of 2005, 10 years ahead of the national requirement.

==== New Routemaster and bendy bus withdrawal ====
In the 2008 London mayoral election campaign, prospective mayor Boris Johnson made several commitments to change the London Buses vehicle policy, namely to introduce a new Routemaster, and remove the bendy buses. Johnson was elected to office on 4 May 2008, and on 4 July 2008 Transport for London announced the New Bus for London Competition, in which conceptual and detailed design proposals would be sought for a new hybrid Routemaster, with development of a design that could be put into production hoped for completion by 2012 (the expected date of the next mayoral election).

In August 2008, the Commissioner of Transport for London Peter Hendy announced that the withdrawal of the bendy buses would take place, starting in 2009. To reduce additional costs to TfL, the articulated buses would be withdrawn as their 5-year operating contracts came up for renewal, with the replacement buses being decided by operators. Options for replacement would not preclude such measures as tri-axle buses. However, research by London TravelWatch in 2008 indicated that replacing articulated buses with double decker models would be more expensive, as additional vehicles would be required to maintain overall route capacity (capacity of 85 per bus versus 120).

The first buses to be withdrawn would be the Red Arrow fleet on routes 507 and 521 in May 2009. The last were withdrawn on 9 December 2011.

In May 2010, Mayor of London Boris Johnson unveiled the design of the New Routemaster, the proposed replacement for the Routemaster as an iconic standard bus for exclusive use in London. The buses, designed by Heatherwick Studio and built by Wrightbus feature two staircases, three doors and an open platform allowing passengers to hop on and off, and commenced operating in 2012. In December 2011 the British car magazine &quot;Autocar&quot; praised the New Routemaster in a road test, rating it ahead of contemporary and historic buses.

However, in December 2016 the new Mayor of London Sadiq Khan decided that no more orders would be placed for the bus after only 1,000 of Johnson&#x27;s envisaged fleet of 2,000 had been procured. In 2020 Transport for London announced that the New Routemasters would be converted so passengers only enter by the front door, with the middle and rear doors becoming exit-only. This was done to reduce fare evasion, which had been double that of other London buses.

==== Transition to zero emission bus fleet ====

Since the early 1990s, efforts have been underway to reduce the emissions of the bus fleet. Early work involved replacing older buses like the AEC Routemaster and fitting particulate filters to exhausts. In the 2000s, hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell buses were trialed – and the first hybrid buses entered service in 2006. It was originally intended that every bus introduced into service after 2012 would be a hybrid, but this requirement was later dropped.

Battery electric buses first entered service in 2014, and double decker hydrogen fuel buses were introduced in 2021. London now has the second largest zero-emission bus fleet in Europe with over 1,400 battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell buses in service. In 2021, it was announced that all buses in the fleet meet or exceed Euro VI emission standards, following the phasing out of older buses, the retrofitting of diesel vehicles and the introduction of new hybrid &amp; electric buses.

The Mayor of London is currently aiming for a zero emission bus fleet by 2037. From 2021, all new buses entering the fleet are either electric or hydrogen zero emission buses.

==Operation==
===Local buses===

Most local buses within London form a network managed by London Buses, an arm of Transport for London. Services are operated by private sector companies under contract to London Buses. With the introduction of the London congestion charge in central London and because at peak times the Underground is operating at maximum capacity, many bus service improvements have been undertaken, and central bus services are currently enjoying something of a resurgence.

Although the rear-entrance double-deck AEC Routemaster is the archetypal London bus, they were withdrawn in the early 2000s owing to their age, their inability to comply with disability legislation or accept wheelchairs or pushchairs, and their requirement for a two-person crew.

All other local bus services are now operated by modern low-floor buses, which may be single-deck or double-deck. Most buses operating in London have two sets of doors, and passengers board the bus using the front door and alight using the rear door, whilst some buses on less busy routes have only one door. Since 2006, all buses are low-floor and accessible, accepting passengers in wheelchairs and other mobility impaired passengers.

Following the privatisation of London bus services in the 1990s, the operating contracts for local buses in London are subject to a system of competitive tender. A wide range of companies now operate bus routes across London. Many services have been contracted out to leading transport groups such as Arriva, ComfortDelGro, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead Group, Stagecoach and Transport UK Group. Abellio, Transit Systems. Connex, National Express, RATP Group and Transdev previously operated services in London.

==== Limited stop / Express routes ====
A small number of bus routes (namely routes SL1, SL2, SL5, SL6, SL7, SL8, SL9 and SL10, run a daily limited-stop service, travelling a long distance but serving few stops in its route. These became part of the wider London Superloop express bus network in 2023.

==== Other bus services ====
Some local bus routes in the outer areas of London cross the London boundary. London Buses services that cross the boundary have standard red buses, and charge London fares for the whole length. Buses from outside London that cross into London are in their operators&#x27; own colour schemes, and may not accept the London fares even within the boundary.

Privately run bus services may also be operated independently of the regulated London bus network, but still require a permit from TfL. This permit applies to any service which has a stop in London and another within 15 miles of Greater London, such as commuter coaches, school buses and supermarket shuttle buses.

===Night buses===
Night buses began running as early as 1913, and they form part of the London Buses network. For many years until 1961, the night routes were numbered from around 280 to 299. But the imminent withdrawal of trolleybuses meant that numbers between 1 and 299 were in short supply. The 280+ route numbers were freed by giving night bus routes a prefix N for the first time. For example, while route 9 travels from Aldwych to Hammersmith, route N9 continues a further 16 miles (26 km) from Hammersmith to Heathrow Terminal 5.

There are also 24-hour routes, which run throughout the day and night. These do not have distinguishing numbers. Some of these only run at night during weekends, whereas others run throughout the week.

===Heritage routes===

Following the withdrawal of rear-entrance double-deck AEC Routemaster from all regular service routes in 2005, a small fleet was retained to operate on heritage routes. As the AEC Routemaster buses were not accessible to passengers in wheelchairs and other mobility impaired passengers, the heritage route was operated as a short-working of a regular service route bearing the same route number, thus ensuring that passengers unable to board the heritage buses are offered equivalent alternative transport arrangements.

Initially running on route 9 and route 15, Route 9H was withdrawn on 26 July 2014. In 2019, the remaining heritage route 15 was cut back to a seasonal service, running on weekends and bank holidays through the summer. In 2021, TfL announced that the heritage route would not return following the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2022, a private operator started operating &#x27;Route A&#x27;, a tourist focused heritage route between Piccadilly Circus and London Waterloo using AEC Routemaster buses. Unlike previous heritage routes, a higher fare is charged.

===Tour buses===
A common sight in central London are tour buses, the majority being open-top buses. These are double-decker buses with a fully or partially open upper deck, which provide tourist services with either live or recorded commentary. Most of these services allow passengers to embark and disembark at any of the company&#x27;s stops, continuing their journey on a later bus.

There are several competing operators of such services which do not form part of the London Buses network and do not issue or accept London Buses tickets, although at least one paints its buses in the same red as London&#x27;s local buses.

Other tours use coaches and generally need to be booked in advance through travel agents.

===Long distance coaches===

Long-distance coaches link London with the rest of the United Kingdom and with other cities across the European mainland. Many domestic services are run by National Express, with international services mainly provided by Flixbus and Eurolines. National Express&#x27; predominantly white vehicles are common on the roads of central London, on their way to and from their terminus at Victoria Coach Station.

In 2006, competition for long-distance traffic was introduced by Megabus, a subsidiary of the large UK bus operating company Stagecoach. This company operates cheap services aimed at students and the like, which must be booked in advance on the internet.

Other coach services link London to medium-distance destinations, and unlike National Express or Megabus provide walk-on fares. Good examples of this are the Green Line services to the Home Counties, mainly operated by Arriva, the service to the city of Oxford, where Stagecoach&#x27;s frequent Oxford Tube service competes with Go-Ahead&#x27;s similar Oxford Express service, and the many commuter services to medium-distance destinations operated by individual coach companies during peak times.

===Airport buses===

National Express is also the principal airport bus operator, serving Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted with its &quot;National Express Airport&quot; brand. Unlike their longer distance cousins, these are walk-on services, which serve stops throughout central London rather than running to Victoria Coach Station.

== Bus priority and bus lanes ==

, London has over of bus lanes, which generally restrict use of a traffic lane to buses, taxis, motorcyclists and cyclists. Bus lanes are clearly marked with road markings and signs, and sometimes with red paving. Other bus priority measures used in London include over 4000 traffic lights that give buses priority, dedicated bus queue jump lanes and bus gates. Some streets (such as Oxford Street) are entirely designated as bus lanes, with no access for general traffic. Bus priority is enforced by TfL, usually by closed-circuit television or cameras mounted to the front of buses.

=== Bus lanes ===
The first bus lane in London was introduced on Vauxhall Bridge on 26 February 1968. This bus lane was estimated to have saved &quot;up to 182 hours of passenger time&quot; each day. In 1972, Oxford Street was designated a bus lane during peak hours, reportedly causing an increase of £250,000 in retail sales. By 1977, over 130 bus lanes had been installed across London, totalling around in length. Despite this, London Transport considered that bus lanes were &quot;spread thinly&quot; across London, with many bottlenecks remaining. From the early 1990s, work to address substantial traffic congestion in London led to the introduction of red routes (which prohibit vehicles stopping, loading or unloading along them), as well as a larger rollout of bus lanes. By 1997, over 377 bus lanes were in place across London. Research showed that bus routes with bus lanes along them had journey time improvements of around 14 per cent, as well as ridership improvements around 15 per cent. Enforcement of bus lanes with cameras began in 1997.

In 2020, TfL announced that they would convert all bus lanes in London to 24/7 operation. This was made permanent in December 2021, with TfL stating that bus journey times had reduced and service reliability had improved. TfL aims to add more bus lanes by 2025.

=== Traffic light priority ===
Following a successful large-scale trial in 1987, London Transport began introducing selective vehicle detection to provide traffic light bus priority in the 1990s. This delivered journey time savings, as well as increased service reliability and reduced costs, as a smaller number of vehicles were required to deliver the same frequency. For example, it was estimated that route 15 could have a journey time 4 minutes shorter, due to the number of selective vehicle detection points passed.

Selective vehicle detection was replaced by the iBus system in the late 2000s, which uses the Global Positioning System instead of physical roadside equipment. iBus which tracks all London&#x27;s buses, allowing passengers to be provided with audio-visual announcements and improved information on bus arrivals, as well as triggering bus priority at traffic lights. All buses in London were fitted with the iBus system by 2009. The system can shorten red traffic lights or extend green lights as necessary to give buses priority, with some traffic lights only giving priority when buses are delayed. A new iBus system will be introduced from the mid 2020s.

== Bus and coach stations ==

There are around 50 bus and coach stations across London, located at transport interchanges, town centres and other major destinations such as shopping centres and hospitals. The busiest coach station in London is Victoria Coach Station, which serves around 14 million passengers a year. Cromwell Road bus station in Kingston upon Thames is the largest London Buses bus station, with 17 bus stands.

==Major accidents and incidents==

* October 1940: LT 669, operating on route 88, was abandoned by its passengers and crew on Balham High Road seconds before a bomb fell, creating a huge crater into which the bus rolled. It was hauled out of the crater two weeks later.

<text>Ginny Wright (full name Ethel Virginia Henderson) was an American country music singer who was born in Twin City, Georgia, August 1, 1932.

Ginny Wright first experience in live performance was singing in glee clubs, she then moved on and studied opera. She began performing country music in the early 1950s. Her first single was on the Triple A label, following her discovery by deejay Jack Gale.

Wright next signed with the new Fabor label on the West Coast, recording a duet with Jim Reeves, &quot;I Love You&quot; (Fabor 101), which spent 22 weeks on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; country charts in early 1954, peaking at No. 3. One year later she returned to the hit parade with another duet, &quot;Are You Mine?&quot; (Fabor 117), this time with Tom Tall, which did even better. Over a 26-week run on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; country charts, it peaked at No. 2. It was her second top 10 duet and her final chart appearance.

After taking a break from her career in the mid-1950s to raise a family, Wright entered country music in the 1960s, cutting a few singles for the Chart label. Wright recorded more duets, including additional ones with Tom Tall, who followed her to the Chart label.

Her sound began to change in the 1960s, acquiring more of a Nashville flavor. A series of one-off label recordings followed, including a couple for Jack Gale&#x27;s Gallery 11 label, one for Travel and a couple for Cayce. Wright also cut an album for Playback Records featuring gospel standards with organ accompaniment.

At this time Wright&#x27;s popularity began to rise in the German market. Her first German success was the album &quot;Ginny Wright&#x27;s Songs &amp; Duets&quot;. This was followed by another album on the Bear Family label titled &quot;Whirlwind&quot;; her duets with Tom Tall were issued on a separate LP under his name. These albums are out of print and the original singles are very rare.

Wright was inducted into the Louisiana Hayride Hall Of Fame in 2003; and a year later, Bear Family released a CD containing most of Wright and Tom Tall&#x27;s Fabor recordings.

Ginny died on September 5, 2021. Her funeral was held on September 9 in Augusta, Ga, aged 89. She was laid to rest in Antioch Primitive Baptist Church Cemetery.

<text>The University of California Davis School of Medicine is the medical school of the University of California, Davis. While the parent institution is located in Davis, California, the medical school is in Sacramento, California.

==History==
Founded in 1966, the UC Davis School of Medicine graduated its first class of physicians in 1972. The school maintains research facilities on the Davis campus while the majority of the school&#x27;s teaching and clinical space is located in Sacramento, 17 miles to the east of the Davis campus. With the December 2006 opening of its new Education Building, the school transitioned all medical school classes to the Sacramento campus. Classes are also held in the UC Davis Center for Health and Technology, which connects to the Education Building. Throughout their four years of medical school, students also take part in health care simulations at the UC Davis Health Center for Simulation and Education Enhancement, which is on the third floor of the UC Davis Center for Health and Technology building. Research activities continue in the same capacity at both the Davis and Sacramento campuses.

The school gained national attention in the late 1970s when an applicant challenged the school&#x27;s affirmative action admissions policy. In a complex and split decision, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in &quot;Regents of the University of California v. Bakke&quot;, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), that the applicant had unconstitutionally been denied admission and Bakke was admitted. They also ruled that affirmative action was legal within some limits.

==Admissions and ranking==
Admissions is highly competitive. In 2011, the school received 4,792 applications, offered interviews to 460 applicants of which 100 matriculated. The acceptance rate for applicants to UC Davis School of Medicine is approximately 1.8%. For 2019, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranks UC Davis School of Medicine #9 based on primary care methodology and #30 based on research methodology.

==Hospitals==
UC Davis Medical Center, located in Sacramento, is one of five teaching hospitals in the University of California system. It ranks among the top 50 hospitals in America, according to an annual survey published by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. Other hospitals affiliated with UC Davis school of medicine include:
*UC Davis Children&#x27;s Hospital
*UC Davis Cancer Center
*Shriners Hospitals for Children – Sacramento
*Sacramento VA Medical Center
*Kaiser Permanente Medical Centers in Sacramento, Roseville, and South Sacramento

==Research==
Faculty in the School of Medicine specializes in a wide range of basic and applied research, including those related to neuroscience, cancer biology, vascular biology, genetic diseases and functional genomics, health services, infectious diseases, nutrition, telemedicine, and vision science. The school receives approximately $90 million in NIH funding annually. About half of UC Davis medical students conduct research during their training.

==Primary care network==
The UC Davis Medical Center operates a network of clinics that provides outpatient medical services to members of the HMO that UC Davis operates. These clinics are staffed by UC Davis medical school faculty and also by staff physicians hired directly by the primary care network (PCN).

==Student clinics==

UC Davis School of Medicine has student-run clinics, which offers free primary care to the uninsured, low-income and other underserved population of Sacramento and surrounding areas. These clinics provide patients quality health care and allow UC Davis medical students to gain real world clinical experience during the early stages of their training.

<text>Interstate 390 (I-390) is a north–south auxiliary Interstate Highway located entirely within New York in the United States. The southern terminus of the route is at the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86 and New York State Route 17, or NY 17) in the town of Avoca. Its northern terminus is at I-490 (Western Expressway) in Gates, just west of Rochester. North of I-490, the expressway continues as NY 390 to the Lake Ontario State Parkway in Greece. I-390 connects to its parent, I-90 (New York State Thruway), in Henrietta, a southern suburb of Rochester. The route is known as the Genesee Expressway from Avoca to I-590 in Brighton, where it becomes part of the Rochester Outer Loop.

In addition to serving Rochester, I-390 serves as an important connecting route between the Rochester metropolitan area and Corning and the rest of the Southern Tier of New York. The freeway also serves several smaller communities between Corning and Rochester, including the Livingston County villages of Dansville and Geneseo. I-390 effectively replaced US Route 15 (US 15) and parallels NY 15, US 15&#x27;s de facto successor, north of Corning. From Lakeville north to Brighton, the two routes cross paths four times and are located no more than apart along the entire stretch.

The first section of the Genesee Expressway opened in the late 1960s, extending from Wayland in the east to Dansville in the west. The entirety of the then-proposed highway was designated as New York State Route 401 (NY 401) in 1970 but redesignated as I-390 . More sections of the freeway opened throughout the 1970s, and I-390 was extended northwestward to cover the southwestern quadrant of the Rochester Outer Loop in 1980 following the elimination of NY 47. I-390 was completed in the early 1980s.

==Route description==

In its southern sections, which account for most of the highway&#x27;s mileage, I-390 is a lightly trafficked freeway of two lanes in either direction going through minimally populated rural areas. Closer to Rochester, it becomes wider to accommodate the increased traffic it handles in the city itself.

===Steuben and Livingston counties===
I-390 begins as westbound traffic on the concurrent routes of I-86 and NY 17 proceeds below the overpass carrying those two routes to the west, at an interchange just east of the village of Avoca in Steuben County. The expressway heads northwest through the narrow valley of the Cohocton River to Cohocton, where the river leaves the expressway and heads north toward the hamlet of Atlanta. I-390 climbs gradually as it continues past Cohocton, eventually turning due west as it descends to an interchange with NY 21 south of Wayland. This exit is also the southern terminus of NY 15, which eventually parallels the Interstate further north.
The road climbs again as it makes a gentle bend and widens as it crosses the Livingston County line just south of Dansville and north of Stony Brook State Park. Descending again, it returns to its northwestern heading. North of the village, it climbs to the west side of the wide valley of Canaseraga Creek, giving the roadway a view over the area known locally as the Flats. NY 36 begins to parallel the highway closely, with NY 63 on the far side of the Flats. Just south of the hamlet of Sonyea, NY 36 crosses at a diamond interchange. I-390 turns northeast briefly but resumes its northwest course soon afterward. At this point, the highway follows more level ground, with woods and swamps mostly replacing farmland in the surrounding landscape.
After passing rest areas on either side, I-390 reaches the NY 408 exit adjacent to the American Rock Salt mine at Hampton Corners. Here, most traffic bound for the Buffalo area exits to go west to Mount Morris, visible across the Flats from the freeway, where it follows NY 36 north. To the immediate east of the exit, NY 408 ends at NY 63, which carries traffic from the Interstate into Geneseo, the county seat. north of the exit, Canaseraga Creek drains into the Genesee River on the road&#x27;s west side.

The expressway continues north through Livingston County to Geneseo, which I-390 skirts to the south and east. While there is no exit for Geneseo on the part of the freeway that encroaches the village, exit 8, an interchange with US 20 Alternate (US 20A) east of Geneseo, provides the connection. Also accessible from the junction is the hamlet of Lakeville, situated off to the east at the junction of US 20A and NY 15. I-390 continues on, encountering NY 15 north of Lakeville and southeast of Avon. From here north to Rochester, I-390 and NY 15 follow closely parallel alignments. Both highways meet US 20 and NY 5 east of Avon prior to crossing into Monroe County.

===Monroe County===
As I-390 heads north through the southern extents of the county, the surroundings become more residential and commercial in nature. The freeway meets NY 15 and NY 251 in Rush ahead of an interchange with both the New York State Thruway (I-90) and NY 253 in southern Henrietta. Past the thruway, the transition from the rural landscapes of the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes to residential and commercial areas is completed as I-390 continues into the suburbs of Rochester and the commercial center of Henrietta. Roughly from NY 253, I-390 has an exit leading to Hylan Drive, a through street leading to The Marketplace Mall. Farther north, I-390 meets both NY 15A and NY 252 in equally commercialized areas before entering Brighton.
Shortly after entering Brighton, I-390 crosses over the Erie Canal and meets the southern terminus of I-590 at a large semi-directional T interchange located adjacent to the canal and South Clinton Avenue. The latter of the two passes through the eastern half of the junction, crossing over I-590 but passing under the ramps connecting I-590 south to I-390 south and I-390 north to I-590 north. Past the exit, I-390 turns to the west, joining the Rochester Outer Loop and crossing back over the canal ahead of an interchange with NY 15 and NY 15A. After passing under NY 15, the freeway begins to run along the southern edge of the Erie Canal, here delimiting the southern city limits of Rochester. The canal and I-390 run side by side for just over to the Genesee River, where I-390 veers slightly to the west as it meets NY 383 at a partial cloverleaf interchange.
For the next mile (), I-390 follows a more northwesterly alignment along the northeastern edge of the Greater Rochester International Airport grounds. It meets Brooks Avenue (NY 204) at the northern edge of the grounds before leaving the airport area and curving more to the north, matching changes in the Erie Canal&#x27;s alignment as both entities proceed around the southwestern edge of the city. Now in Gates, I-390 crosses over the Rochester and Southern Railroad just south of another partial cloverleaf interchange with NY 33A. The freeway continues on, passing under the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision and NY 33 before connecting to I-490 at a complex interchange roughly west of the canal and the Rochester city limits. I-390 ends here; however, the freeway continues northward toward Greece as NY 390.

==History==

Construction on a limited-access highway between Wayland and Dansville began . The highway opened to traffic as a realignment of NY 245. On January 1, 1970, the expressway became part of NY 401, a designation that also extended south to the town of Avoca and north to the city of Rochester along the Genesee Expressway, a proposed freeway utilizing the US 15 corridor. NY 401 was added to the Interstate Highway System and redesignated I-390 . As initially planned, I-390 would continue north into Downtown Rochester and end at I-490 while the entirety of the Rochester Outer Loop south of I-490 would become I-590.
Construction began on the portion of I-390 between NY 17 near the village of Avoca and NY 21 south of Wayland. It opened to traffic . By 1977, work had begun on the leg between NY 251 in Rush and the New York State Thruway (I-90) in Henrietta. This section was completed by 1981, as were the Dansville–Groveland (NY 36), Avon–Rush, and thruway–Hylan Drive segments. The remainder of I-390 in Monroe County up to the modern I-390/I-590 interchange was built , and the final gap in the expressway from NY 36 to US 20 in Livingston County opened .

By the late 1970s, in the face of community opposition, the proposed extension of I-390 into Downtown Rochester was scrapped. Instead, the state of New York began to look into the possibility of changing the designations that were assigned to the outer loop. In one proposal submitted to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials in the late 1970s, I-590 would be truncated to begin at the then-proposed junction with I-390 in Brighton. The rest of the loop south of I-490, meanwhile, would become part of an extended I-390, which would continue north past I-490 to the outer loop&#x27;s northwestern end at the Lake Ontario State Parkway. NY 47, the then-current designation for much of the outer loop, would be eliminated.

Most of the plans went into effect when the NY 47 designation was eliminated on March 18, 1980. The southern half of the outer loop was signed as planned; however, I-390 and I-590 were modified to end at their junctions with I-490. While NY 47 was officially assigned to the entirety of the outer loop prior to its removal, only the portion from NY 383 north to I-490 was actually once part of NY 47.

On February 10, 2008, whiteout conditions caused a 36-car pileup near the Scottsville Road exit, which led to a 17-year-old girl&#x27;s death. Firefighters had to climb over cars and cut off roofs to get to people. More than 20 people were taken to the hospital.

On July 17, 2011, a tour bus heading northbound from Washington DC to Niagara Falls crashed between the Avoca and Cohocton exits, killing two and injuring at least 35 others. Preliminary investigation listed a blown-out tire as a possible cause of the crash.

==Future==
As the successor to US 15 in Western New York, it has been suggested that I-390 be added to the routes of either I-99 or I-83 as recently as 2002, with I-99&#x27;s northern completed segment currently sharing the US 15 routing up to Corning, south of I-390&#x27;s current southern terminus. However, no official moves have been forwarded to fulfill this.

<text>Noble Lee Sissle (July 10, 1889 – December 17, 1975) was an American jazz composer, lyricist, bandleader, singer, and playwright, best known for the Broadway musical &quot;Shuffle Along&quot; (1921), and its hit song &quot;I&#x27;m Just Wild About Harry&quot;.


==Early life==
Sissle was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, around the time his father Rev. George A. Sissle was pastor of the city&#x27;s Simpson M. E. Chapel. His mother, Martha Angeline (née Scott) Sissle, was a school teacher and juvenile probation officer.

As a youth, Sissle sang in church choirs and as a soloist with his high school&#x27;s glee club in Cleveland, Ohio. Sissle attended De Pauw University in Greencastle, Indiana on scholarship and later transferred to Butler University in Indianapolis before turning to music full-time.

==Career==

In early 1916, Sissle joined one of the society orchestras organized by James Reese Europe in New York. He persuaded Europe to also hire his friend, pianist and composer Eubie Blake, and later in the year helped Europe organize a regimental band for the 15th Infantry Regiment (Colored) of the New York National Guard. This would later become the &quot;New York 369th Infantry &quot;Hell Fighters&quot; Regiment&quot; that served nobly in France in World War I, with Europe as a lieutenant and Sissle as his sergeant and lead vocalist. Unlike most military bands it played syncopated music and was credited with introducing jazz to France. Sissle left the army after the war as a second lieutenant with the 370th Infantry Regiment and joined Europe&#x27;s civilian version of the 369th band.

Sissle began recording for the Pathé label in early 1917, and sang several vocals on Pathé discs recorded by Europe&#x27;s 369th Infantry Band in early 1919, after it had become a civilian band.

Not long afterwards, on May 9, 1919, James Europe was murdered by a disgruntled band member in Boston, Massachusetts, leaving Sissle, with the help of his friend, Eubie Blake, to take temporary charge of Europe&#x27;s band. Years earlier Sissle had struck up a partnership with Blake after they first met in Baltimore in 1915.

Shortly after World War I, Sissle joined forces with Blake to form a vaudeville music duo, &quot;The Dixie Duo&quot;. After vaudeville, the pair began work on the jazz musical revue &quot;Shuffle Along&quot;, which incorporated many songs they had written, and had a book written by F. E. Miller and Aubrey Lyles. When it premiered in 1921, &quot;Shuffle Along&quot; became the first hit musical on Broadway written by and about African Americans. It was the first all-black show to reach the Broadway stage in over a decade and included a teenage Josephine Baker among the performers. The musical introduced songs such as &quot;I&#x27;m Just Wild About Harry&quot; and &quot;Love Will Find a Way&quot;.

Sissle and his band appear in a 1931 British &quot;Pathétone Weekly&quot; filmed at Ciro&#x27;s nightclub in London, performing Walter Donaldson&#x27;s &quot;Little White Lies&quot; and &quot;Happy Feet&quot;, written by Jack Yellen and Milton Ager. In 1932, Sissle appeared with Nina Mae McKinney, the Nicholas Brothers, and Eubie Blake in &quot;Pie, Pie Blackbird&quot;, a Vitaphone short released by Warner Bros. In February 1931, Sissle accompanied Adelaide Hall on piano at the prestigious Palace Theatre (Broadway) in New York during her 1931-32 world tour. In 1932, Noble Sissle and Band appeared in the Vitaphone film &quot;That&#x27;s the Spirit,&quot; also featuring Cora La Redd and Miller and Moreland. Sissle collaborated with other artists such as Lena Horne and Duke Ellington, and was friends with Ethel Waters, Cab Calloway, and Nat King Cole.
In 1954, the New York radio station WMGM, which was then owned by Loew&#x27;s Theatre Organization, signed Sissle as a disc jockey. His show featured the music of African-American recording artists. Sissle was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

==Legacy==
In 2018, Sissle was the subject of the award-winning documentary &quot;Noble Sissle&#x27;s Syncopated Ragtime&quot;, directed by Daniel L. Bernardi and David de Rozas.

<doc id="892329" wikidata="Q156968" url="?curid=892329" title="Panzerhaubitze 2000">
<text>The Panzerhaubitze 2000 (), meaning &quot;armoured howitzer 2000&quot; and abbreviated PzH 2000, is a German 155 mm self-propelled howitzer developed by KNDS Deutschland (formerly Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW)) and Rheinmetall in the 1980s and 1990s for the German Army. The PzH 2000 has automatic support for up to five rounds of multiple round simultaneous impact. Replenishment of shells is automated. Two operators can load 60 shells and propelling charges in less than 12 minutes. The PzH 2000 equips the armies of Germany, Italy, Ukraine, Netherlands, Greece, Lithuania, Hungary, Qatar, and Croatia, mostly replacing older systems such as the M109 howitzer.

In November 2019, a PzH 2000 L52 gun fired a shell a distance of almost . Rheinmetall started testing a prototype L52 gun barrel with a new charge for a range of at least since 2020. In May 2024, Rheinmetall announced that it would supply &quot;a three-digit number&quot; of L52 gun barrel systems for the Panzerhaubitze 2000 for &quot;a European customer country&quot;.

== Development ==
In 1986, Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany agreed to terminate their existing development of the PzH 155-1 (SP70) programme, which had run into reliability problems and had design defects, notably being mounted on a modified tank chassis. German industry was asked for proposals to build a new design with a gun conforming to the JBMOU. Of the proposed designs, Wegmann&#x27;s was selected. 

== Design ==
Rheinmetall designed the 155 mm 52-calibre JBMOU compliant rifled gun (60-rifles, right-hand spiral), which is chromium-lined over its entire 8 m length and includes a muzzle brake on the end. The gun uses a new modular charge system with six charges (five identical), which can be combined to provide the optimal total charge for the range to the target, as well as the conventional bagged charge systems. Primer is loaded separately via a conveyor belt, and the entire loading, laying and clearing are completely automated.

The maximum range of the gun with standard issue DM92 propellant charges is 30 km with the standard DM121 boattail round, 40 km with base bleed rounds, and 54 km with M2005 V-LAP rocket-assisted projectile. With Rheinmetall&#x27;s ERC (Extender Range Charge, previously known as the Top Charge) high pressure unitary charge, the range is 36 km with DM121 BT round, 47 km with M0121 BB round and 67 km with the M2005 V-LAP RAP. The gun can also fire the SMArt 155 artillery round used by Germany and Greece.

Wegmann supplied both the chassis, sharing some components with the Leopard 2, and the turret for the gun. The system has superb cross-country performance because of its use of continuous tracks and considerable protection in the case of counter-fire. The turret includes a phased array radar on the front glacis for measuring the muzzle velocity of each round fired. Laying data can be automatically provided via encrypted radio from the battery fire direction centre.

A lighter, more air-portable version developed by KMW and called the Artillery Gun Module uses the gun in a module fitted to a lighter chassis.

In December 2013, Raytheon and the German Army completed compatibility testing for the M982 Excalibur extended range guided artillery shell with the PzH 2000. Ten Excaliburs were fired at ranges from 9 to 48 km. Shells hit within 3 m of their targets, with an average miss distance of 1 m at 48 km. The Excalibur was accepted by the German Army in 2014.

A PzH 2000 L52 gun fired a shell 67 km at the Alkantpan test range in South Africa on 6 November 2019.

In 2021, Germany and the Netherlands agreed to jointly define &amp; execute a Mid-Life Update to the operational Pzh2000 in their inventories and ensure standardisation and availability.

==Combat record and alterations==

The PzH 2000 was used for the first time in combat by the Fire Support Command of the Royal Netherlands Army in August 2006 against Taliban targets in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Medusa. It was then used regularly in support of coalition troops in Uruzgan province. The PzH 2000 was also used extensively during the Battle of Chora. It was known as &quot;the long arm of ISAF&quot; and proved to be accurate and effective. However, the gun was criticised by the Dutch in Uruzgan province as the NBC system, designed for use in Europe, could not cope with the high level of dust in Afghanistan.

The guns have been modified with additional armor being fitted to the roof to protect against mortar rounds. There have been reports of other problems, including the need to keep it in the shade unless actually firing, the damage done when traveling on poorly built roads, and a significant &#x27;cold gun&#x27; effect necessitating the use of &#x27;warmers&#x27;.

Starting in June 2010 as a result of the Good Friday Battle, German ISAF troops at PRT Kunduz had three PzH 2000s at their disposal. They were first used on 10 July 2010 to provide support for the recovery of a damaged vehicle. This was the first time in its history that the Bundeswehr has used heavy artillery in combat. The PzH 2000 also played a key role during Operation Halmazag in November 2010, when the villages of Isa Khel and Quatliam were retaken from the Taliban by German paratroopers.

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
On 21 June 2022, twelve PzH 2000s were deployed to Ukraine; seven came from Germany and five from the Netherlands. After a couple of weeks of intensive use, the guns required repairs, and error messages were being displayed as they are designed and built to fire no more than 100 shots a day. Germany considers 100 shots per day &quot;a high-intensity mission&quot;. Ukraine has consistently exceeded this number, placing stress on the loading mechanism. Ukraine also fired &quot;special ammunition at too great a distance.&quot; The Bundeswehr sent spare parts and a repair facility in Lithuania was chosen to repair the weapons. This came as Ukraine and KMW entered into a 1.7 billion euro deal to purchase 100 PzH 2000s.

Russian state news agency TASS reported that a PzH 2000 was destroyed by Russian forces in Kherson Oblast on 30 October 2022. The open-source intelligence site Oryx reported one visually confirmed damaged PzH 2000.

Due to the intensity of artillery fire on the battlefield, Lithuania undertook to repair twelve of the howitzers, finishing repair work on six by December 2022. By this time, the number of PzH 2000s sent to Ukraine rose to twenty-two; fourteen from Germany and eight from the Netherlands. As of February 2023, fifteen of the howitzers were waiting to be repaired in Slovakia, but were being held up at the border for several weeks due to legal issues.

According to the Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger the barrels of the PzH 2000 had an expected lifetime of around 4,500 shots, but to the surprise of the manufacturer they have achieved up to 20,000 in Ukraine.

== Production status ==
As of June 2024, 41 remain to be manufactured, it includes 1 for Hungary, 22 for Germany and 18 for Ukraine.

: 57 ordered in 2002. Prior to the war in Ukraine, 33 were in storage, 18 in active service, and 6 used for training. Now, 46 to be modernised by 2024. In 2022, 5+3 were sent to Ukraine.

; (12)
: 24 ordered in 2013, first three delivered in 2015. In September 2024 12 were returned to Germany to be provided to Ukraine in a &quot;Ringtausch&quot; arrangement in exchange for replacement with 12 RCH-155.

; (38)
: 28 delivered. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was announced on 20 April 2022 that five Dutch PzH 2000s would be transferred to Ukraine, with ammunition and training to be provided by Germany. On 6 May, it was announced that Ukraine would receive seven units from German army stocks which were undergoing maintenance. On 7 May, Chancellor Olaf Scholz agreed to supply the ammunition required, straight from industry to Ukrainian forces, without having to go through the German government for approval in the future. Training of Ukrainian artillery crews started on 11 May 2022 at the Bundeswehr&#x27;s artillery school in Idar-Oberstein. On 21 June, Ukrainian Minister of Defence Oleksii Reznikov announced that the first PzH 2000s had entered Ukrainian service. &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; reported on 27 July that Germany had agreed to sell 100 more PzH 2000s to Ukraine. By this time, many PzH 2000 ammo loading mechanisms had broken down due to considerable strain: while the PzH 2000 is designed to fire 100 shells per day, the Ukrainians likely fired the gun much more often. In addition to shipping necessary spare parts to Ukraine, the German government was negotiating the creation of a repair center for its equipment in Poland. In October 2022, the howitzers were sent to Lithuania because Poland denied the German request for exclusive access to the Huta Stalowa Wola facilities, as it would halt all production in the factory (HSW manufactures and services Krab SPGs for Poland and Ukraine, among other weapon systems). Eventually, a planned repair center in Slovakia will shorten the route to and from the war zone in Ukraine. In late 2023, it emerged that Ukraine did not sign the purchase agreement for the delivery of 100 PzH 2000.
: In February 2024, Germany announced supporting Ukraine with 18 additional PzH 2000 and 18 more RCH-155. 

=== Potential sales ===

; (54)
: 54 additional systems are in discussion as of June 2024, to be supplied to Germany and to Ukraine.

=== Failed bids ===
: The PzH 2000 was a contender for Phase 1C of Australia&#x27;s Land 17 Artillery Replacement Programme, until that phase of the project was cancelled in May 2012.
: Finland tested a PzH 2000 alongside the 155mm SpGH ZUZANA and AS-90 &quot;Braveheart&quot;. Tests ended in 1998; more of the cheaper 155 K 98 field guns were bought instead of self-propelled systems.

; - Navy
: The German Navy evaluated a modified system known as MONARC for installation onboard frigates; while the system performed well, components were difficult to protect against corrosion. Sweden evaluated a slightly modified version, but selected the Archer Artillery System instead.

; (54)
: The PzH 2000 participated in the Romanian tracked self-propelled artillery system competition against the Korean K9 Thunder and the Turkish T-155 Fırtına II which included 54 howitzers in total. The Korean offer was the only one to progress in the contract bid, and negotiations between South Korea and Romania were finished in April 2024, although the contract was not signed yet.
: The PzH 2000 was considered for the US Army&#x27;s Crusader concept system, but several requirements of the Crusader made it unsuitable. The Crusader specifications placed the crew and gun in separate compartments, allowing a single highly armoured crew compartment to control the firing of an entire battery of guns through intervehicle links. In addition, the Crusader included an automated ammunition tender, and an active cooled barrel.

<text>Cecil Yekuthial Linder (March 10, 1921 – April 10, 1992) was a Polish-born Canadian film and television actor. He was Jewish and managed to escape Poland before the Holocaust. In the 1950s and 1960s, he worked extensively in the United Kingdom, often playing Canadian and American characters in various films and television programmes.

In television, he is best remembered for playing Dr. Matthew Roney in the BBC serial &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1958–59). In film, he is best remembered for his role as James Bond&#x27;s friend, CIA agent Felix Leiter, in &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964). Another well-known film in which he appeared was &quot;Lolita&quot; (1962), as Doctor Keegee.

==Career==
He was raised in Timmins, Ontario where his father was a rabbi to the Jewish community. During his early years of his professional career, Linder worked as an announcer at CKGB in Timmins.

Linder enjoyed an extensive and successful television career on both sides of the Atlantic. In the UK, probably his most prominent role was as the palaeontologist Roney in the original BBC version of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1958–59).

In the United States, he was a regular in the CBS soap operas &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; and &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; and in the 1980s appeared in several of the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; revival TV films as District Attorney Jack Welles.

Linder was also a regular on the popular 1980s Canadian crime series &quot;Seeing Things&quot;, playing Crown Attorney Spenser.

During his career, he also had guest roles in episodes of a variety of other popular British, American and Canadian television programmes, including: &quot;The Forest Rangers&quot;, &quot;Doomwatch&quot;, &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;The Saint&quot;, &quot;Danger Bay&quot;, &quot;The New Avengers&quot;, &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; (as Peter Ames), and &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; as Senator Ben Travis #2.

Linder appeared as Inspector Cramer in the CBC 1982 radio dramatizations of Nero Wolfe short stories.

Linder&#x27;s last work was as Syd Grady in two episodes of the television series &quot;Sweating Bullets&quot; (1991).

He died the following year at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto of complications from emphysema.

He accumulated over 225 credits in film and television productions in a long performing career.

<text>A Zuckertüte (, &quot;sugar cone&quot;), also known as a Schultüte (, &quot;school cone&quot;) in some parts of Germany, is a large cone-shaped, cornucopia-styled container made of paper, cardboard, or plastic.

When children in Germany, Austria, German-speaking parts of Switzerland and Belgium, parts of the Czech Republic close to the German border, and parts of Poland (Greater Poland, Upper Silesia, Warmia), set off for their first day of school upon entering first grade, their parents and/or grandparents present them with this large cone, attractively decorated and filled with toys, chocolate, candies/sweets, school supplies, and various other special treats. The Zuckertüte is given to children to make this anxiously awaited first day of school a little sweeter.

==History==
The name translates as cone, even though the German word &quot;Tüte&quot; is translated into English in most other contexts as &quot;bag&quot;.

The tradition of the Zuckertüte has its origins in approximately the year 1810 in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia in Germany. The first documented report of cone-shaped Zuckertüten comes from the city of Jena in 1817, closely followed by reports from Dresden (1820) and Leipzig (1836). It started in the larger cities but spread quickly to small towns and villages, soon becoming an institution all over Germany.

In the early days of the concept of the Zuckertüte, before it spread to other parts of Germany, the usual routine was not to hand over the &quot;Tüte&quot; to the children personally. Marked with the students&#x27; names, the &quot;Zuckertüten&quot; were taken to the school by grandparents or godparents and in a ritual reminiscent of the Mexican piñata, they were hung on a metal &quot;Zuckertüten-Baum&quot; from which each child had to pick his or her cone, without breaking it. The story told to the children claimed that there was a &quot;Zuckertüten-Baum&quot; growing at the school, and if that tree&#x27;s fruits (i.e. the &quot;Zuckertüten&quot;) were ripe and large enough to pick, it was then time to go to school for the first time.

The only custom that changed in the latter half of the 20th century is that fewer sweets seem to appear in the Zuckertüte, with more practical gifts such as crayons and pencils, small toys, CDs, books, and even articles of clothing replacing the traditional chocolates and candies/sweets. These are traditionally given by grandparents who also take the child out to dinner the evening before school begins.

If they are not made by the parents, the &quot;Zuckertüten&quot; can be bought from shops ready-made or they are made by the children themselves in the kindergarten.

Christiane Cantauw, a German folklore expert at the Volkskundliche Kommission für Westfalen (Folkloristic Commission of Westphalia, based in the city of Münster), has researched the Zuckertüte tradition. In a 2016 interview with the broadcaster Deutsche Welle she explained how important the symbolism of the Zuckertüte tradition is for school beginners and their families, regardless of their financial means:


==Shapes==
After the division of Germany, hexagonal school cones with a length of 85 cm were established in East Germany, while the traditional round cones (usually 70 cm long) were preferred in the West.

==Commercial production==
The largest manufacturer of Zuckertüten in Germany is Nestler Feinkartonagen GmbH in Ehrenfriedersdorf. It produces more than two million Zuckertüten per year.

<doc id="892341" wikidata="Q152986" url="?curid=892341" title="Jatropha">
<text>Jatropha is a genus of flowering plants in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. The name is derived from the Greek words ἰατρός (&quot;iatros&quot;), meaning &quot;physician&quot;, and τροφή (&quot;trophe&quot;), meaning &quot;nutrition&quot;, hence the common name physic nut. Another common name is nettlespurge. It contains approximately 170 species of succulent plants, shrubs and trees (some are deciduous, like &quot;Jatropha curcas&quot;). Most of these are native to the Americas, with 66 species found in the Old World. Plants produce separate male and female flowers. As with many members of the family Euphorbiaceae, &quot;Jatropha&quot; contains compounds that are highly toxic. &quot;Jatropha&quot; species have traditionally been used in basketmaking, tanning and dye production. In the 2000s, one species, &quot;Jatropha curcas&quot;, generated interest as an oil crop for biodiesel production and also medicinal importance when used as lamp oil; native Mexicans in the Veracruz area developed by selective breeding a &quot;Jatropha curcas&quot; variant lacking the toxic compounds, yielding a better income when used as source for biodiesel, because of its edible byproduct. Toxicity may return if edible &quot;Jatropha&quot; is pollinated by toxic types.

==Uses==

The stems of haat (&quot;Jatropha cuneata&quot;) are used for basketmaking by the Seri people in Sonora, Mexico. The stems are roasted, split and soaked through an elaborate process. The reddish dye that is often used is made from the root of another plant species, &quot;Krameria grayi&quot;. Spicy jatropha (&quot;J. integerrima&quot;) is cultivated as an ornamental in the tropics for its continuously blooming crimson flowers. Buddha belly plant (&quot;J. podagrica&quot;) was used to tan leather and produce a red dye in Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is also used as a house plant.

The oil from &quot;Jatropha curcas&quot; is mainly converted into biodiesel for use in diesel engines. It is also used for thermal energy storage or as heat transfer fluid at medium and high temperature. The cake resulting from oil extraction, a protein-rich product, can be used for fish or animal feed (if detoxified). It is also a biomass feedstock to power electricity plants or to produce biogas, and a high-quality organic fertilizer.

In 2007, Goldman Sachs cited &quot;Jatropha curcas&quot; as one of the best candidates for future biodiesel production. It is resistant to drought and pests, and produces seeds containing 27-40% oil, averaging 34.4%. The remaining press cake of jatropha seeds after oil extraction could also be considered for energy production. However, despite their abundance and use as oil and reclamation plants, none of the &quot;Jatropha&quot; species have been properly domesticated and, as a result, their productivity is variable, and the long-term impact of their large-scale use on soil quality and the environment is unknown. 2009 research found that Jatropha biodiesel production requires significantly more water than other common biofuel crops, and that initial yield estimates were high. Earlier, higher estimates from Worldwatch Institute had suggested that 1 acre of cultivation could yield 202 gallons (4.8 barrels) of biodiesel.

&quot;Jatropha curcas&quot; is also being studied for use as a carbon sequestration plant in arid regions.

==Toxicity==
Much like other members of the family Euphorbiaceae, members of the genus &quot;Jatropha&quot; contain several toxic compounds. The seeds of &quot;Jatropha curcas&quot; contain toxic lectin dimers and carcinogenic phorbol esters. Despite this, the seeds are occasionally eaten after roasting, which reduces some of the toxicity. Its sap is a skin irritant, and ingesting as few as three untreated seeds can be fatal to humans. In 2005, Western Australia banned &quot;Jatropha gossypiifolia&quot; as invasive and highly toxic to people and animals. It continues to be used as a medicine in certain geographic regions; however one study found the dried leaf to have no anti-fungal activity.

<text>Orchha is a town, near the city of Niwari in the Niwari district of Madhya Pradesh state, India. The town was established by a Bundela Rajput ruler Rudra Pratap Singh some time after 1501, as the seat of an eponymous former princely state of covering parts of central &amp; north India, in the Bundelkhand region. Orchha lies on the Betwa River, 80 km from Tikamgarh and 15 km from Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh.

==History==

Orchha was founded in 1531 (the 16th century AD) by the Bundela chief, Rudra Pratap Singh, who became the first King of Orchha, (r. 1501–1531) and also built the Fort of Orchha. The Chaturbhuj Temple was built by the queen of Orchha, Ganesh Kunwar (गणेश कुँवर), while &quot;Raj Mandir&quot; was built by &#x27;Raja Madhukar Shah&#x27; during his reign, 1554 to 1591. Orchha was captured by imperial forces of the Mughal Army led by Prince Aurangzeb in October 1635.
==Story about king Rama (Ram Raja) temple==
Lord Rama is regarded as the King of Orchha. Orchha is the only place in India other than Ayodhya, where lord Rama is also the King of the town. The story behind this goes like this: In 16th century, king Madhukar shah of Orchha was a devotee of Lord Krishna whereas his wife queen Kunwar Ganesh was a devotee of Lord Rama. There were always disputes due to this difference. Once king challenged the queen that if Rama really exists then bring him to Orchha. Queen went to ayodhya and prayed for 21 days with rigorous penance to lord Rama. At last Rama appeared before her in his child form and agreed to go with her with three conditions: first that he will be the only king of Orchha, there will be no other king. Second that wherever he is placed once he will remain there only and third that he will go at a particular time and with some monks. Queen accepted the conditions and thus Rama (statue representing Rama himself) was brought to Orchha. Since then Rama is the only king in Orchha. Even in the present times Rama is regarded as the only king and the guard of honour is given to him by the police every day at the Ram Raja Temple. No other VIP or minister or official behaves like a ruler when they visit Orchha. This aspect makes Orchha a unique place for devotees of lord Rama.

==Places of tourist interest==

On a seasonal island on the bank of the Betwa River, which has been surrounded by a battlement wall, stands a huge palace-fort. The fort consists of several connected buildings erected at different times, the most noteworthy of which is the &quot;Raja Mahal&quot;.
The Ram Raja Temple is built on a square base and has an almost entirely plain exterior, relieved by projecting windows and a line of delicate domes along the summit. The Jahangir Mahal is built on a rectangular base and is relieved by a circular tower at each corner surmounted by a dome, while two lines of graceful balconies supported on brackets mark the central storeys. The roof is crowned by eight large fluted domes, with smaller domes between them, connected by an ornamental balustrade. The Jahangir Mahal is considered to be a singularly beautiful specimen of Mughal architecture. A point worth mentioning here is that the mother of Jahangir, Mariam-uz-Zamani. It is with this in mind that the Rajput king of Orchha had built the Jahangir Mahal. There is a spectacular light and sound show in the evening hours in the Jahangir Mahal. The show displays the history of the city of Orchha and the Jahangir Mahal. Chaturbhuj Temple is an old temple from the 9th century, and is noted for having one of the tallest Vimana among Hindu temples standing at 344 feet.

The Uth Khana (Camel Shelter) where the King&#x27;s camels were stationed is right next to the fort and is a must-see. Tourists can also climb on the roof of the Uth Khana and get a fantastic view of Orchha town. The ruins behind the fort complex are an even greater sight. It makes a tourist travel back in time and is an integral part of a visit to Orchha. It houses the residences of various military officers, ministers (housing, roads), gunpowder factory, etc.

Numerous cenotaphs or chhatris dot the vicinity of the fort and the Betwa river. Elsewhere about the town there is an unusual variety of temples and tombs, including the Chaturbhuj temple, which is built on a vast platform of stone. The more unguarded and neglected of these buildings are popular hangouts for tropical bees, wasps, and other such excitable stinging creatures.

In 2006, Orchha&#x27;s buildings were being documented by the LIK Team of IIT Roorkee, India.

A community radio station, Radio Bundelkhand was launched in Orchha on 23 October 2008. It is an initiative of the Development Alternatives Group. The radio station broadcasts daily programs in the Bundeli dialect and devotes significant amount of its broadcast time to local issues, culture, education and the rich tradition of Bundeli folk music. The station is available on 90.4 MHz.
==Demographics==
 India census, Orchha had a population of 8501. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Orchha has an average literacy rate of 54%, lower than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 64%, and female literacy is 42%, 18% of the population is under 6 years of age.
==Literary Center==

Orchha was the home of famous poet Keshavdas (1555–1617) who wrote the classic Rasikapriya. He was patronized by Vir Singh Deo of Orchha.

==Popular in Media==
In 2024, Anees Bazmee&#x27;s film Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 has been shot at Orchha Fort, temples and ghats of Betwa. The film stars Kartik Aryan and Madhuri Dixit in the lead roles.

==Accessibility==
The nearest Airport to Orchha is Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia Airport in Gwalior which is 119 kms. Orchha is 170 kms and 3 hours drive from Khajuraho Airport which is well connected with other metropolitan cities in India.

Orchha Railway station is on the Jhansi-Manikpur section of the North Central Railways. 15 km from Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, Orchha also lies close to other popular tourist destinations like, Gwalior and Khajuraho.

Tourists who wish to visit Orchha from Khajuraho can catch the morning express which leaves at around 8 or 9 AM. Alternatively, they could also avail themselves of the afternoon express which leaves at around 12 or 1 PM.

<text>The Festival Internacional de Benicàssim (), commonly abbreviated as FIB, is an annual music festival that takes place in the town of Benicàssim, in the Valencian Community, Spain. It focuses mainly on pop, rock, and electronica artists, as well as short films, fashion shows and art.
The festival begins on the second Tuesday of July, which is when the camping grounds open - although music officially commences Thursday afternoon. FIB is notable for having bands play through the night (5 pm8 am) and has three main stages, Las Palmas, Visa, and South Beach Dance, with capacities of approximately 30,000, 15,000 and 8,000, respectively. In 2009, the festival capacity exceeded 50,000; in 2020, more than 150,000 visited the festival over the four days the festival lasted.

==History==
The first FIB took place in 1995. Since then, Benicàssim has been dedicated to rock, pop, and electronic music as well as featuring artists who are a reference on the world stage.

==Location==
FIB is held in the seaside resort of Benicassim (Castellón province) on Costa del Azahar, Valencia, Spain, 92.2 km away from Valencia Airport. Festival goers who have purchased multi-day passes can camp for up to nine days starting the Monday before and ending Tuesday after the festival has ended.

==2009 Festival==
On December 23, 2008, two of the four headliners for the 2009 festival were announced as Kings of Leon and Franz Ferdinand. Kings of Leon had previously played the festival in 2007, while Franz Ferdinand headlined in 2006. Tickets were made available at a discounted launch price between December 15, 2008 and January 15, 2009, with a four-day weekend pass available for €160 (£140). This includes full festival entry between July 16–19, as well as camping between July 13–21. On 27 January 2009, it was reported that Oasis would also be joining the line-up. On 2 February 2009, &quot;NME&quot; confirmed that The Killers would be headlining the final night of the festival, with Franz Ferdinand playing Saturday 18 July and Kings of Leon playing Friday 17 July. The article also stated that Oasis would headlining the &quot;FIBstart&quot; event on 16 July 2009. BBC News Online confirmed that Paul Weller would be playing on Friday 17 July. On 26 February 2009, it was announced that The Psychedelic Furs, Friendly Fires, White Lies, The Bishops and Boys Noize had been added to the line-up, with Benicàssim&#x27;s official website confirming which days the bands would be playing. Further line-up additions were made on 17 March 2009, and again on 2 April 2009. The line-up was as follows:

===2009 festival disruption===

On the night of Friday 17 July a large fire broke out in scrubland within a few hundred metres of the festival site. High winds contributed to the difficulty of fighting the fire and caused conditions on many of the stages to become unsafe. As a result, a number of acts including the Kings of Leon, Maxïmo Park, Boys Noize and Yuksek were unable to perform. Tom Tom Club did perform but had to be taken off for their own safety. Maxïmo Park performed the following night following a cancellation by Lily Allen.

Several hundred festival goers had to be evacuated from the campsite to a nearby sports hall. The festival resumed the following day with limited disruption. Glamour model Bianca Gascoigne and Ringtone artist Ross Kent were reported in tabloid newspapers as having &quot;gone missing&quot; but reappeared several days later.

==Controversy==

FIB has received criticism from nationalist sectors in Spain, aimed at the fact that it does not support Valencian culture, even though it takes place in the Valencian Community and receives a high amount of public money to finance itself.
FIB&#x27;s director Jose Luis Morán stated in an interview that he did not intend to include any band in the festival that had lyrics in Catalan, Euskera or Galego. Among the people and associations that have criticized this is Marina Albiol, an Esquerra Unida politician.

<text>Norman Alastair Duncan Macrae (1923 – 11 June 2010) was a British economist, journalist and author, considered by some to have been one of the world&#x27;s best forecasters when it came to economics and society.

==Career==
Macrae joined &quot;The Economist&quot; in 1949 and retired as its deputy chief editor in 1988. He foresaw the Pacific century, the reversal of nationalization of enterprises, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the spread of the internet, which were all published in the newspaper during his time there. He contributed to the books &quot;The Third World War: August 1985&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Third World War: The Untold Story&quot; (1982), both attributed to General Sir John Hackett but mostly written by several collaborators.
Not to get bored, Macrae&#x27;s first ten years in retirement produced the biography of John von Neumann (the mathematical father of computers and networks), a column for the UK &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, and a &#x27;Heresy Column&#x27; for &quot;Fortune&quot;. 
He was the father of mathematician, marketing commentator, and author Chris Macrae. 2025 REPORT, their joint future history on death of distance first published in 1984, forecast that 2005–2025 would be humanity&#x27;s most critical decades, irreversibly impacting sustainability. The last update of 2025 Report was published in Swedish in 1993 as Den Nye Vikingen

<doc id="892351" wikidata="Q1515469" url="?curid=892351" title="Duke of Beaufort (France)">
<text>Duke of Beaufort (French: &quot;duc de Beaufort&quot;) was a title in the French nobility.

==History==
The dukedom was first created in 1597 as a peerage for Gabrielle d&#x27;Estrées, Marchioness of Monceaux, the mistress of King Henry IV, with a remainder to their illegitimate son César, who later also became Duke of Vendôme. 

The duchy (i.e. the lands associated with the dukedom) was sold by the 5th Duke of Beaufort in 1688 to Charles François Frédéric de Montmorency-Luxembourg, who was created Duke of Beaufort without a peerage that same year. The dukedom of Beaufort was renamed dukedom of Montmorency in 1689. He later succeeded as Duke of Piney-Luxembourg.

==Dukes of Beaufort – first creation (1597)==
* 1597–1599 : Gabrielle, 1st Duchess of Beaufort (1571–1599)
* 1599–1665 : César, 2nd Duke of Beaufort (1594–1665)

<text>Aboriginal whaling or indigenous whaling is the hunting of whales by indigenous peoples recognised by either IWC (International Whaling Commission) or the hunting is considered as part of indigenous activity by the country. It is permitted under international regulation, but in some countries remains a contentious issue. (The hunting of smaller cetaceans is covered at Dolphin drive hunting.) It is usually considered part of the subsistence economy. In some places, whaling has been superseded by whale watching instead. This article deals with communities that continue to hunt; details about communities that have ended the practice may be found in History of whaling.

==International regulation==
Under the terms of the 1986 moratorium, the International Whaling Commission allows the activity to be carried out by aboriginal groups if it occurs on a subsistence basis, similar to subsistence fishing. This Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling is restricted to native peoples and others working on their behalf, as defined by the IWC.

The IWC says that:
:&quot;Since its inception, the IWC has recognised that indigenous or &#x27;aboriginal subsistence&#x27; whaling is of a different nature to commercial whaling. It is thus not subject to the moratorium. This is reflected in the different objectives for the two types of whaling. For aboriginal subsistence whaling the objectives are to:&quot; 

:*ensure that risks of extinction are not seriously increased by whaling;
:*enable native people recognised as &quot;Aborigines&quot; to hunt whales at level appropriate to satisfy their cultural, subsistence and nutritional requirements (also called &#x27;need&#x27;); and
:*move populations towards and then maintain them at healthy levels.

In order for a country to carry out a hunt under the aboriginal group clause, the nation must provide the IWC with evidence of &quot;the cultural and subsistence needs of their people.&quot; In particular, the hunt is not intended for commercial purposes and the caught meat cannot be exported.

In 2018, the Commission endorsed proposals made by a working group established six-years earlier to consider some long-standing and complex questions, and improve the way that the Commission considered ASW.  A number of new initiatives were endorsed in order to facilitate a more straight-forward process when catch limits are next considered at the 2024 meeting of the Commission.  The new initiatives include:

* a new timetable for sharing information from the hunts, and receiving feedback, maximising discussion time and transparency
* agreement that status quo catch limits would be renewed automatically, assuming  a series of agreed steps continue to  be completed
* a commitment to establish closer ties with international and inter-governmental organisations focusing on indigenous rights

==United States whaling==

In the United States whaling is carried out by Alaska Natives and by the Makah of Washington State. It no longer occurs on the Atlantic coast, although the Pilgrim Fathers found the original inhabitants of New England had a well-developed understanding of drift whales.

===Alaska===
The Arctic whaling program is managed by the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission, which reports to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The commission includes eleven whaling communities which inhabit the Arctic Alaska coast: the Gambell, Savoonga, Wales, Little Diomede, Kivalina, Point Hope, Point Lay, Wainwright, Barrow, Nuiqsut, and Kaktovik.

In 2015 Alaska Natives caught 326 beluga whales and 49 bowhead whales. In 2016 they caught 59 bowhead whales, two minke and one humpback whale; The latter two species were not authorized, though no one was prosecuted. Annual catches vary between 300 and 500 belugas and 40 to 70 bowheads.

The hunt takes the bowhead whales from a population of about 10,000 in Alaskan waters. Anti-whaling groups claim this hunt is not sustainable, though the IWC Scientific Committee, the same group that provided the above population estimate, projects a population growth of 3.2% per year. The hunt also took an average of one or two gray whales each year until 1996. The quota was reduced to zero in that year due to concerns about sustainability.

===Washington State===

According to federal law, the Makah people of Washington State are entitled to hunt and kill one baleen whale, typically a gray whale, each year, though archeological records and oral history indicate a significant number of humpback whales were hunted as well. The Makah ended their whaling practices in the 1920s, but notified the U.S. Government of their wish to reassert their whaling rights in 1995. The first permitted Makah whale hunt in 70 years occurred on 17 May 1999, when they caught a north Pacific gray whale, an unpermitted hunt killed another in 2007, and in 2018 they took meat from a humpback killed by a ship strike. An environmental impact statement for further hunts was issued in 2015.

On 5 April 2019 NOAA Fisheries proposed issuing a waiver under the MMPA to the Makah tribe to allow hunting, as well as a what stakeholders can do to engage in the public rule making process before an Administrative Law Judge. One of the main stipulations that NOAA proposed was allowing the Makah people to hunt as many as 20 gray whales every five years, however prior to any hunt the tribe would have to obtain a permit from NOAA. On 2 August 2019 the Administrative Law Judge announced that the final agenda for the hearing on NOAA&#x27;s proposed waiver and regulations was set for November 2019, which was postponed from the previous 26 June 2019 announcement.

==Canadian whaling==
Canada left the IWC in 1982 and as such is not bound by the moratorium. Whaling is carried out by various Inuit groups in the Canadian Arctic in small numbers and is managed by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.

==Russian whaling==
Chukchi people of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in the Russian Far East are permitted to take up to 140 gray whales from the North-East Pacific population each year.

==Caribbean whaling==

Some whaling is conducted from Grenada, Dominica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Saint Lucia. Species hunted are the short-finned pilot whale, killer whale, pygmy killer whale and spinner dolphins. Throughout the Caribbean, around 400 pilot whales are killed annually with the meat being sold locally. This hunting of small cetaceans is not regulated by the IWC.

Whales are hunted in Bequia, the second largest of the Grenadines. Natives of Bequia are allowed to catch up to four humpback whales per year using only traditional hunting methods of hand-thrown harpoons in small, open sailboats. The limit is rarely met, with no catch some years. Its classification as aboriginal, and therefore permissible, is highly contested. In the 2012 meeting of the IWC, delegates from several anti-whaling countries, and environmental groups, spoke out against it, with Peter Sanchez of the Dominican Republic calling it &quot;artisanal whaling out of control&quot;.

==Faroese whaling==

Whalers in the Faroe Islands take approximately 800 long-finned pilot whales per year. These hunts are called &quot;grindadráp&quot; in Faroese.

==Indonesian whaling==

Lamalera, on the south coast of the island of Lembata, and Lamakera on neighbouring Solor are the last two remaining Indonesian whaling communities. The hunters have religious taboos that ensure that they use every part of the animal. About half of the catch is kept in the village; the rest is traded in local markets, using barter. The whale hunts are carried out in a traditional manner, with bamboo spears and small wooden outriggers, 10–12 m long and 2m wide, constructed without nails and with sails woven from palm fronds. The animals are killed by the harpooner leaping onto the back of the animal, from the boat, to drive in the harpoon.

The people of Lamalera hunt several species of whales, primarily sperm whales (the baleen whale is taboo), and in the peak year of 1969 caught 56 sperm whales. In addition to whales, dolphins, manta rays, turtles and several species of sharks are also hunted. In 1973, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization sent a whaling ship and a Norwegian master whaler, to modernize the hunt. This effort lasted three years, and was not successful. According to the FAO report, the Lamalerans &quot;have evolved a method of whaling which suits their natural resources, cultural tenets and style.&quot;

The World Wildlife Fund has carried out surveys in the village to determine that the limited hunting does not endanger world whale stocks or other endangered species.

== Issues that threaten aboriginal whaling rights ==
Commercial whaling and poachers hunt whales in large quantities and sell them illegally. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) does not allow the hunting of any whales except for aboriginal subsistence whaling and scientific whaling, which have catch limits to maintain the conservation of whales. These groups must report their hunts and the number of whales killed in order to track the population of whale species and conservation. Hunting illegally means the kills are not reported, which makes it difficult to maintain population numbers and conservation.

He used to listen to radioshows like the Ferry Maat &quot;Soulshow&quot; and &quot;In The Mix&quot; from Ben Liebrand. At age fourteen, he intensified his commitment to the art, and began DJing professionally at school parties. Between 1985 and 1994, Tiësto began a residency at several clubs in the Netherlands at the behest of his manager. At the Spock, a small club in Breda, he fine-tuned his own live style by performing from 10 p.m. until 4 a.m. on weekends. In the beginning of his career as a DJ he mostly played new beat and acid house.

== Career ==

=== 1994–2000: Early projects and success ===
In 1994, he began releasing material on Noculan Records&#x27; sub-labels Chemo and Coolman. During these years, he produced hardcore and gabber tracks under such aliases as Da Joker and DJ Limited. Tiësto was later discovered by the general manager of Rotterdam-based Basic Beat Recordings.
In late 1994, Tiësto signed to Basic Beat where he met Arny Bink, Tiësto released records on the sub-label Trashcan, founded by Arny, and later created the Guardian Angel sub-label with Arny in which they introduced the popular &quot;Forbidden Paradise&quot; series. From 1995 to 1996 he released four extended plays on Bonzai Jumps and XTC, sub-labels of Lightning Records. In 1997, he joined his friend Yves Vandichel on his sub-label, DJ Yves, a division of the now defunct Human Resource label XSV Music. In the fall of 1997, Bink and Tiësto decided to leave Basic Beat and create their own parent label, Black Hole Recordings, Trashcan was discontinued and Guardian Angel continued releasing music until 2002. Through Black Hole, Tiësto released the &quot;Magik&quot; series and also created two major sub-labels; SongBird and In Trance We Trust. From 1998 to 1999, he released music on Planetary Consciousness where he met A&amp;R Hardy Heller and invited him to release some records on Black Hole.

In 1998, Tiësto joined forces with fellow Dutch deejay Ferry Corsten to create the trance-based duo of Gouryella. The first Gouryella track, also called &quot;Gouryella&quot;, was released in May 1999 and became a huge hit, scoring various chart positions around the world, including a top-15 position in the UK Singles Chart. Tiësto showcased this track in &quot;Magik Three: Far from Earth&quot; as well as in his set at the first ID&amp;T Innercity party (&quot;Live at Innercity: Amsterdam RAI&quot;), his first major breakthrough. The next single, entitled &quot;Walhalla&quot;, also made it on the charts worldwide, peaking at No. 27 in the UK Singles Chart. Released via Ferry&#x27;s Tsunami label, both singles went on to be certified Gold on record sales. During these years, Tiësto also collaborated with Benno de Goeij of Rank 1 under the name Kamaya Painters. In November 1999, he released the first installment of the &quot;In Search of Sunrise&quot; series. Since then, he performed monthly as a resident at Gatecrasher in Sheffield, and played a 12-hour set, his longest, in Amsterdam. On 31 December 1999, he performed at Trance Energy 2000, a special party held by ID&amp;T for the turn of the millennium.

Together with Armin van Buuren, Tiësto created two projects in 2000; Alibi – &quot;Eternity&quot;, which was released on Armind, and Major League – &quot;Wonder Where You Are?&quot;, on Black Hole. After the release of &quot;Tenshi&quot; in September 2000, Tiësto decided to concentrate on his solo work and left Ferry Corsten to take on the Gouryella project solely as his own. Through his first compilations and the &quot;In Trance We Trust&quot; series, he ended up introducing Armin van Buuren and Johan Gielen to the mainstream. &quot;Summerbreeze&quot; marked Tiësto&#x27;s U.S. debut, a mix album that showcased his remix of Delerium&#x27;s &quot;Silence&quot;, which spent four weeks in the UK&#x27;s Top Ten chart and reached number three in the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance chart. &quot;In Search of Sunrise 2&quot; was released in November 2000.

=== 2001–2003: &quot;In My Memory&quot; ===

In 2001, Tiësto created a new sub-label, Magik Muzik, and released his first solo album, &quot;In My Memory&quot;, which contained 5 major hits; &quot;Lethal Industry&quot;, which was actually produced in 1999 and had only 3 copies released at that time, the track was officially released in 2001 which was remixed by Richard Durand in 2006 along with &quot;Flight 643&quot; which was another leading single that was later adapted with vocals by Suzanne Palmer and released as &quot;643 (Love&#x27;s on Fire)&quot;. Other tracks were &quot;Obsession&quot; in which Tiësto worked alongside Junkie XL, the instrumental tracks &quot;Dallas 4PM&quot; and &quot;Suburban Train&quot; with &quot;Urban Train&quot; as its vocal version. The last singles to be released were &quot;In My Memory&quot; which is the title track for the album as it only received high ratings in the United States and the opening track &quot;Magik Journey&quot; which opened Tiësto in Concert (2003). On 2 February 2002, Tiësto played nine consecutive hours during the second edition of the Dutch Dimension festival.
On 27 February, Tiësto was awarded a Zilveren (&#x27;Silver&#x27;) Harp music award. The same year he also received a Lucky Strike Dance Award in the category Best DJ Trance/Progressive. In August he became part of Moby&#x27;s Area2 Tour. For eighteen days he travelled through the United States with artists such as Moby himself, but also David Bowie and Busta Rhymes. In January 2003, Tiësto received the annual Dutch Popprijs (&#x27;Pop Award&#x27;) during the Noorderslag festival. After touring with Moby, Tiësto remixed two songs from him, &quot;We Are All Made of Stars&quot; and &quot;Extreme Ways&quot; in the same year, having &quot;We Are All Made of Stars&quot; reach No. 13 in the Hot Dance Club Play. In 2002 he released his first &quot;In Search of Sunrise&quot; mix to feature a place on its name, &quot;In Search of Sunrise 3: Panama&quot;. On 28 March 2003; Tiësto, Dieselboy, Bad Boy Bill, and Noel Sanger joined the PlayStation 2 Dual Play tour. Tiësto and Noel&#x27;s appearance began on 13 April and ended on 6 June.

His fame continued to increase for then known he has in the early 2000s, following his six-hour &quot;Tiësto Solo&quot; sets which he performed without other DJs or opening acts. This idea, of one DJ playing alone to a large crowd was new. Tiësto was the first DJ to hold a solo concert in a stadium; on 10 May 2003, he performed for 25,000 people in Arnhem&#x27;s GelreDome, later called &quot;Tiësto in Concert&quot;. He repeated the same type of concert the following year during two consecutive nights in late October. In addition to holding these two concerts for 35,000 of his fans, he held another concert for a crowd of 20,000 in Hasselt, Belgium the following week. DVDs of both his 10 May 2003 and 30 October 2004 concerts have been released, having the other DVD titled &quot;Tiësto in Concert 2&quot;. The DVDs show the journey from the first idea to the main event, featuring live performances by Andain, Dinand Woesthoff, and Jan Johnston. The event includes live music and dancers performing at different times throughout the set.

=== 2004–2006: &quot;Just Be&quot; and appointment to the Order of Orange-Nassau ===
In 2004, he released his second artist album &quot;Just Be&quot;, which featured his first single &quot;Traffic&quot; which is the first non-vocal track to reach number one spot in the Dutch national charts for 23 years.

The track &quot;Sweet Misery&quot; was originally written for Evanescence but it did not meet the deadline for the release of their album. In support to his &quot;Just Be&quot; album, he played at Breda, Eindhoven, Utrecht, and Amsterdam; these stops were later named Just Be: Train Tour. On 20 May 2004, he was appointed Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau by Her Majesty Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. The Athens Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (ATHOC) asked Tiësto to perform at the Olympic Games, making him the first DJ to play live on stage at an Olympic Games at the 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Athens, where he played for 90 minutes.
Tiësto flew to Athens in January 2004 to have a meeting with the ATHOC. His &quot;Tiësto in Concert&quot; DVD caught their attention, after which he was asked to write more tracks based on his opening tune &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; which would fit in with the Olympic spirit and combine the classical with the modern age. The first rehearsal was on 7 August, for an empty stadium; the second rehearsal was on 8 August, with 35,000 volunteers. The last rehearsal included almost 60,000 people in the stadium which was on 10 August.

During the course of his performance at the Olympics, the Dutch athletes started dancing in front of the DJ booth and had to be moved on by officials. The performance included new tracks produced especially for the Opening Ceremony and songs that were created to complement the spirit and theme of the ceremony. A condensed studio-recorded album of the songs played on the Olympic set was later released, including new songs specially composed for the occasion, entitled &quot;Parade of the Athletes&quot; in October 2004. In the liner notes, he noted the IOC requested that the music not contain any lyrics as they could be inadvertently misinterpreted. In late 2004, he began his touring across Latin America, with his release of &quot;In Search of Sunrise 3: Panama&quot; in which he gained influence from the sun and sand in summer 2002. The tour continued in 2005, and Tiësto performed live in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Panama, Peru, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Paraguay, Ecuador, Venezuela and Colombia. Following the tours, &quot;In Search of Sunrise 4: Latin America&quot; was released in 2005, featuring a second CD for the first time in the &quot;In Search of Sunrise&quot; series.

On 20 August 2005, Verwest took &quot;Tiësto in Concert&quot; to the US when he played to 16,000 at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena with Cirque du Soleil dancers.

For the second year in a row he performed live at a New Year&#x27;s Eve/New Year&#x27;s concert in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Orleans Arena to a sell-out crowd. His four-city U.S. tour was postponed due to the hurricane damage in New Orleans and Miami. BPM magazine has an annual poll in the US which is unveiled in the WMC, in 2005 Tiësto took the No. 1 spot. The influences of Los Angeles remained with him and would later influence his &quot;In Search of Sunrise&quot; compilation.

A wax sculpture of Tiësto was placed behind a turntable at Madame Tussauds in Amsterdam where visitors can mix Tiësto&#x27;s music together. Stops were made in Ukraine, Slovakia, Serbia, Macedonia, Romania, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Turkey, Croatia, Poland and South Africa. The United States tour that was part of &quot;Tiësto in Concert&quot; was dwarfed by his appearance at Sensation White in 2006 where he performed to over 45,000 people in Amsterdam. The compilation was launched in the Winter Music Conference in Miami Beach to support his release, Tiësto went on his In Search of Sunrise 5 Asia Tour for more than three weeks. In September 2006, Tiësto was admitted to hospital after experiencing pain in his chest. He was diagnosed with pericarditis and subsequently had to cancel a number of shows.

In the case of Christian Burns from BBMak, Tiësto met him through MySpace and contacted him and the production of the single &quot;In the Dark&quot;. The album consists of rock, trance and experimental music, which shows the style Tiësto has grown throughout the years since his previous albums which contained lyrics, &quot;In My Memory&quot; and &quot;Just Be&quot;. Producer Brian Transeau collaborated with Tiësto in three tracks, he composed &quot;Bright Morningstar&quot; and &quot;Sweet Things&quot;, and performed the vocals in the single &quot;Break My Fall&quot;.

On 6 October 2009, he released his fourth studio album &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;, which featured artists such as Priscilla Ahn, Calvin Harris, Tegan &amp; Sara and Nelly Furtado. Unlike his earlier albums, which were all mostly trance, Kaleidoscope explores other electronic genres, and is considered Tiesto&#x27;s most experimental album.

To release the album he set up a new record label called Musical Freedom after parting ways with Black Hole Recordings.

In a 2014 interview with &quot;DJ Magazine&quot;, Tiësto revealed why he left trance music. When asked whether his decision to leave the genre was influential to his popularity in the United States, the Dutch producer said: &quot;Maybe, it&#x27;s hard to say. I think I&#x27;d still be the &#x27;Tiesto trance guy&#x27; but the difference is you&#x27;re not really being relevant. Some of the old trance guys still have their following but it doesn&#x27;t feel like anybody really cares – and that&#x27;s the biggest difference. It&#x27;s nice to be in touch with the new kids who are coming up – the 16 and 18-year olds who are producing house music see me as kind of a godfather, and it&#x27;s really cool to be in touch with them. I think if I&#x27;d still been a trance DJ, they&#x27;d have been so disconnected with that sound that I wouldn&#x27;t be much inspiration for them, and vice versa.&quot;

In 2015, at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, he won the Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical for his remixed version of John Legend&#x27;s hit &quot;All of Me&quot;.

<text>Joseph-Étienne Desmarteau (4 February 1873 – 29 October 1905) was a Canadian athlete, winner of the weight throwing event at the 1904 Summer Olympics.

==Biography==
Born in Boucherville, Quebec, Desmarteau was member of the Montréal Athletic Club was one of the top competitors in the 56 lb (25.4 kg) weight throwing event, which is no longer an Olympic event. In 1902 he had won the American AAU championships, beating John Flanagan. Flanagan broke the world record in the event prior to the 1904 Olympics, making him one of the favourites for the event along with Desmarteau.

To compete in the Olympics, Desmarteau, a fire officer in Montréal, had to ask for a leave of absence to go to St. Louis, but he was denied by his employer. He decided to go anyway, which cost him his job. In St. Louis, his first throw was 34 ft 4 in (10.46 m), enough for victory over Flanagan, who did not manage better than a 33 ft 4 in (10.16 m) throw. At the 1904 Olympics, Desmarteau was the only non-American to win in the field events. 

Desmarteau received a hero&#x27;s welcome back in Montréal and was rehired as a police officer. The following year, he died, possibly of typhoid fever.

A district, a park and a sports arena in Montréal have been named after him; the Étienne Desmarteau Centre was used as a venue for basketball during the 1976 Summer Olympics. The District d&#x27;Étienne Desmarteau is part of the borough of Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie.

It is contended that Desmarteau was the first Olympic Games champion from Canada, although 1900 Summer Olympics champion George Orton, who ran for an American university, was also Canadian.

<text>The Type 96 () or ZTZ96 is a Chinese second generation main battle tank (MBT). The final evolution of the Type 88 design, the Type 96 entered service with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) in 1997. The later variants of the Type 96 are currently in PLA service together with China&#x27;s third generation MBT, the Type 99.

==History==
China&#x27;s tank development can be divided into three generations. The first generation was the Type 59, a locally manufactured copy of the Soviet T-54 and its derivative tanks. The second generation of MBTs started with the Type 80 and reached its end state as the Type 96. The third generation began with the Type 99 tank.

China&#x27;s first generation tank development program failed to meet the PLA&#x27;s performance requirements. These technical shortcomings coincided with the appearance of the T-72 and T-80 tanks in Russia, which influenced Chinese defense officials and contributed to their decision to begin development of a new generation indigenous MBT in the early 1980s. This new program was to lead to the development of the Type 80/85 family by 1988.

The Type 80 prototypes were accepted into PLA service as the Type 88A/B. Most distinctively, the Type 88 family had six road wheels instead of the five that the previous Chinese MBTs possessed. However, after the 1991 Gulf War the PLA soon realized that the Type 88 design was insufficient, due to Iraqi Type 59/69 tanks&#x27; poor performance against contemporary NATO tanks (as the Type 88 itself is a further development of the Type 59). A better domestic MBT was required. However, continued delays in China&#x27;s third gen MBT development meant the PLA had no choice but to continue development of the Type 85 family. In 1995, Norinco produced the Type 85-III prototype with an upgraded engine and explosive reactive armor.

In 1997, the upgraded Type 85-IIM prototypes were accepted into PLA service as the Type 88C/Type 96. The most visible difference between the Type 96 and earlier Type 88 series tanks was the additional spaced armor on the turret front. This spaced armor gave the Type 96 a rectangular front profile, visually distinguishing it from the round turret of the Type 88. Other visible differences included their armament: the Type 96 possessed a locally designed 125mm smoothbore gun while the earlier Type 88 variants used a 105mm rifled gun instead. This made the Type 96 the first PLA tank in service armed with a 125mm caliber gun.

By mid-2016, the Chinese military had over 7,000 tanks in active service, including about 2,077 Type 96/Type 96As and about 814 Type 99/Type 99As. Compared to the Type 99—with its high capability and similarly high cost—the cheaper Type 96B is seen by domestic experts as the main tank in the modernization of the PLA.

=== Deployment ===
In the early 2000s, the Type 96 was the PLA&#x27;s main armored firepower for maneuver warfare units. 31 tanks are deployed in an armored battalion and 10 tanks are deployed in a company.

After the PLA&#x27;s reforms in 2017, the Type 96 is deployed in the combined arms battalion of the new heavy combined arms brigade. Each battalion features two tank companies and two mechanized infantry companies, with each company having 14 vehicles.

=== International Tank Biathlon ===

In 2014, China participated with the Type 96A in the Russian-hosted tank biathlon, where it competed against the Russian T-72B3, clinching third place. China participated again in 2015, coming in second place. In 2016, it won one gold medal (out of a total of 23 awarded gold medals). China once again reached the finals of the Tank Biathlon in 2021.

== Design ==
=== Armaments ===
The main armament is a 2-plane stabilized 125 mm ZPT-98 smoothbore gun with an autoloader using a carousel-style magazine. The main gun has a fume extractor located midway along its length. Secondary armaments include a QJC-88 12.7 mm heavy machine gun and a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun. The Type 96 is equipped with the ISFCS-212 computerized fire-control system with a ballistic computer, laser rangefinder, and automatic target tracking capability. When the Type 96 entered service, its fire-control system was reportedly superior to that of the T-72 tanks fielded by other nations at the time. The Type 96 is capable of day/night all-weather operations as the driver, gunner and commander have access to night vision devices and image intensifiers.

Type 96A is fitted with ISFCS-212B fire-control system, which replaced the gunner night vision sight with thermal imaging system sporting 3x and 8x optical magnifications. The new GUMS-2 digital ballistic computer provides more detailed calibration in sophisticated environments. The gunner thermal sight is connected to the commander terminal, which allows the commander to take over in an emergency. Type 96B&#x27;s fire-control system is further upgraded from Type 96A, which includes new computer, communication, command and control systems. Despite the lack of commander-independent thermal sight, the fire-control computer of Type 96A and Type 96B allows the commander to acquire and engage enemy targets through the optical periscope mounted on the commander’s hatch.

=== Protection ===
The vehicle features six double-tired road wheels with tracks. The upper portions of the tracks are protected by armor skirts in saw-toothed shape. The glacis plate is sloped to the point of being near-horizontal for better protection. The turret has a low-profile design, which makes the vehicle less likely to be seen on the battlefield. Six smoke grenade dischargers are fitted to the side of the turret, providing total of 12 smokes. Due to the usage of autoloader, the tank only has a crew of three, which consists of the driver, tank commander, and gunner. The tank series is also fitted with NBC protection and automatic fire suppression system. Type 96 features steel and composite armor on the front hull and turret. On Type 96A, the tank turret is fully welded with improved steel armor layer and composite mix. The arrow-shaped FY-4 explosive reactive armor (ERA) blocks are mounted on the turret, hull, and storage bucket for increased protection. Type 96B&#x27;s armor layout is similar to that of Type 96A.

An electro-optical activated defense system, TCS-2, developed by 303 Institute of Norinco, is installed on the Type 96A prototype. TCS-2 was not installed on the mass-produced version due to limited protection against modern anti-tank missiles.

=== Mobility ===
The tank driver sits at the front-left of the hull. The tank commander and gunner sit in the turret. The engine compartment is located in the rear. The Type 96 tank was powered by a 730 hp (582 kW) engine which was subsequently upgraded to a 800 hp engine on the Type 96A. 

On the Type 96B, the engine was upgraded again to 1200 hp (895 kW). It also features a new hydropneumatic suspension system and automatic transmission system, providing greater mobility and responsiveness. The increase in horsepower also allows the Type 96B to have a very high power-to-weight ratio, improving its acceleration and hill climbing abilities.

==Variants==


=== Type 96 ===
Domestic version of Type 85-IIM. Sometimes mistakenly referred to as the Type 88C. Renamed Type 96 when put into PLA service.
In comparison to the Type 85 and Type 88, the Type 96 features a more powerful engine, improved electronics and a welded turret. 
Type 96 was accepted by the PLA in 1997.

===Type 96A===
Additional &quot;arrow-shaped&quot; modular armor similar to the Type 99 is installed on the turret front. The back of the hull is now completely flat compared to the baseline Type 96. The Type 96A was first revealed in 2006, but in-service tanks were first seen in a military parade in 2009.

The Type 96A is a third-generation upgrade of the Type 96. Its internal electronics may have been upgraded to Type 99 standards. The visual profile of the Type 96A is similar to the Type 99. However, the Type 96A can be distinguished from the Type 99 by the driver&#x27;s position of the left side of the hull. FY-4 ERA was added on front upper glacis. The vehicle is equipped with a thermal imager. Features an upgraded engine.

TCS-2 electro-optical active defense system, similar to the Shtora, has been installed. Electro-optical jammers which are able to jam enemy guided missiles, rangefinders, and designators are found on the tank.

===Type 96B===
Variant first seen in July 2016 loaded on a Russia-bound train to participate in the 2016 tank biathlon. It is equipped with an improved engine, improved high-performance gun with an upgraded fire-control system, new transmission, chassis, ventilation, communications and computer systems, exhaust and suspension. However it still doesn&#x27;t feature a commander-independent sight. Compared to the previous variants, the two exhausts that were originally located on the right side of the hull are now located on the rear hull with air vents. The Type 96B has a stated maximum speed of 74 km/h.

=== VT-2 ===

Export variant of Type-96A. Debuted at the 2012 Defence Services Asia Exhibition. Can be equipped with Remote Weapons Station and has a maximum speed of 70 km/h (on road). Capable of turning on its own axis. On December 9, 2021, the Tanzania People&#x27;s Defence Force displayed a single unit of the VT-2 main battle tank during a parade in Dar es Salaam to mark the 60th anniversary of Tanzanian independence.

== Operators ==

* People&#x27;s Liberation Army – 36+ battalions of Type-96A (around 1,500 units), 31+ battalions of Type 96 (around 1,000 units) as of December 2015.
* Tanzania People&#x27;s Defence Force – 5+ VT-2 delivered to Tanzania in 2021, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. One VT-2 was displayed at a military parade in October 2021.

<doc id="892390" wikidata="Q7011034" url="?curid=892390" title="New Politics Initiative">
<text>The New Politics Initiative (NPI) was a faction of Canada&#x27;s New Democratic Party. It was generally viewed to be further left than Alexa McDonough&#x27;s leadership, but not as far left as the Socialist Caucus.

The NPI believed that the NDP was moving too close to the right, and was dangerously close to becoming another Liberal Party. It believed in uniting Canada&#x27;s left to combat that. The NPI viewed Canada&#x27;s left as being more than just the labour unions, but rather as appealing to a staunch left wing who believe in anti-globalization, feminism, gay rights, and environmentalism. The NPI attributed the poor showing of the NDP in recent years to having alienated its left-wing base by moving towards the centre, and wished to bring these activists into the NDP by adopting their views.

The NPI was founded in June 2001, and was soon joined by British Columbian Members of Parliament Libby Davies and Svend Robinson. Other prominent members included Judy Rebick and Jim Stanford. The NPI originally called for the NDP to disband and form another, more left wing, party under a different name with the participation of social movements. It was said that this would have followed the path set by the NDP when it was created in 1961 by its predecessor party, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, and labour unions, but the NPI did not propose a formal merger, but a disbanding.

The NPI never articulated a specific plan for how social movements could be integrated into the NDP. At the NDP convention held in Winnipeg in November 2001, opponents of the initiative used that lack of detail to defeat the proposal. The NPI&#x27;s resolution on the support of almost 40 per cent of convention delegates.

When Jack Layton won the NDP leadership in January 2003, it was taken as a victory by the NPI, with whom Layton had sympathized, but never joined. Key NPI leaders such as Robinson, Davies and Rebick supported Layton&#x27;s campaign for leader. With Layton&#x27;s election the NPI became less vocal and formally dissolved in early 2004, with a concluding public meeting being held on February 22.

<doc id="892399" wikidata="Q5588216" url="?curid=892399" title="Goulais River">
<text>The Goulais River (Pronounced: goo-lee) is a river in northern Ontario, Canada, which rises in the Algoma highlands and empties into Goulais Bay on eastern Lake Superior near Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. It is one of the largest tributaries on the eastern lake, draining an area of approximately .

The river and its tributaries were used to transport logs to local sawmills during the second half of the 19th century. The Algoma Central Railway travels up the river valley on its way to the Agawa canyon.
At one time, the river was an important spawning area for lake sturgeon. However, logging operations, fishing and the installation of an electric barrier to prevent sea lampreys from travelling upstream (removed in 1960) have reduced sturgeon activity in the river.

The river is used for recreational canoeing, kayaking, and swimming, and the headwaters and parts of the river have been protected by the Goulais River Provincial Park.

The river&#x27;s name is thought to come from the French word &quot;goulet&quot; or &quot;narrow passage&quot;, which is also the source of the English words &quot;gully&quot; and &quot;gullet&quot;. The French called the area at the river&#x27;s mouth &quot;Anse de la pêche&quot; or &quot;Fish Inlet&quot;.

The Goulais River is a popular yellow pickerel fishing area. The river is also home to bass, brook trout, and other species.

==Goulais River Provincial Park==
Since 2003, a section of the river is protected in the Goulais River Provincial Park. It is a waterway park consisting of a strip of land along both shores of the river. Some of its features includes shoreline wetlands, falls, a lake section, and stretches through talus slopes and bedrock resembling rock gardens. It is home to a self-sustaining brook trout population.

As a non-operating park, there are no visitor facilities and services.

The park is part of the Algoma Headwaters Signature Site, that also includes the Algoma Headwaters Provincial Park, Aubinadong-Nushatogaini Rivers Provincial Park, and the Ranger North Conservation Reserve.

<doc id="892410" wikidata="Q1004277" url="?curid=892410" title="Fukiya">
<text>The is the Japanese blowgun, as well as the term for the associated sport. It consists of a tube, with darts approximately in length. Unlike modern Western blowguns, the fukiya has no mouthpiece: instead, a shooter must maintain a seal with the lips while forcefully exhaling. The darts used in the fukiya are called &quot;fukibari&quot;. Traditionally, fukibari were in length.

In Japan, fukiya is considered to be an archery sport, maintained by the Japan Sports Fukiya Association. In order to promote fukiya, the International Fukiya Association (IFA) was formed, based in Japan. The main organizations under the IFA are the American Association (ASBA), and the French Federation (FSBA).

==History==
The &quot;fukiya&quot; is often considered to have been a weapon of the ninja. It is known that in the past, there were numerous schools of martial arts and ninjutsu (such as Togakure-ryū) which used the fukiya and fukibari alone (as &quot;senbon&quot;).

A typical ninjutsu fukiya is around , which is shorter than the sport fukiya, and does shorten the effective range. Thus, even in theory, ninja would have had to use special darts with poisoned tips in order for it to work, and fired from a concealed location. Most likely, it was used similar to &quot;shuriken&quot;, as a distraction.

The blowgun can also double as a breathing pipe and straw to enable the ninja practitioner to better survive in the wilderness.

There will always be doubts whether it was truly effective compared to bow and arrows, since it has a shorter range. In the hands of experts (&quot;Master&quot; level), it can be very accurate, as testified by sport fukiya players today.

== Science of fukiya ==
The range of a fukiya is determined by size (diameter), weight, length and material of its basic component, the tube. Pressure built up in the tube from the player&#x27;s breath and the technique that the player uses to channel the breath into the tube affects the speed that the dart will exit the muzzle.

Weight will affect a player&#x27;s ability to hold the tube steady, and arm fatigue level over a period of time.

==Sport fukiya==
Like any sport, fukiya has certain guidelines for its equipment. In general, international guidelines set by IFA are less strict than JSFA. Currently, the specifications for international competitions are as follows: 
*Equipment: Can be self-made (Japanese competitions require properly made equipment)
**Pipe
***length: ; For practice at home, students can employ a pipe, with the target placed at away
***diameter: if possible; anywhere between to , so is acceptable for International competition
***Weight: for beginners; for advanced
**Darts: wedge shape if possible; conical shape is acceptable; guidelines can vary
***length: Approximately in length
***weight: 
*Competition
**Distance from target: ; for handicap competitors; for novice; ( for practice, using a shorter blowgun)
**Number of darts in use: 30
**Target: 3 rings
***bulls-eye: diameter, 7 points
***inner ring: in diameter, 5 points
***outer ring: in diameter, 3 points
***Bulleye&#x27;s height from the ground: ( for handicap)
**Point calculation: 6 rounds of 5 shots are taken, with a maximum score of 210 points
**Time allotted: not exceeding 25 minutes, for all 30 darts, including shooting, scoring, retrieval, and cleaning the barrel
*Level advancement (minimum score required)
**3 kyu: 60 points
**2 kyu: 75 points
**1 kyu: 90-105 points (depends on association)
**shodan: 105-119 points (depends on association)
**2 dan: 120 points
**3 dan: 150 points
**4 dan: 162 points
**5 dan: 175 points
**Master level I: three 186 points scores

==Associations==
*International Fukiya Association
**United States Blowgun Association (USA)
*Japan Sport Fukiya Association (Japan)

==Popular culture==
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; features fukiyas being used by the Ultimate Ninja and Foot Ninjas.
* In &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;, Jigo&#x27;s men use fukiyas which they keep disguised as parasols when not in use.
* A fukiya was used by a ninja in &quot;Deadliest Warrior&quot;.

<doc id="892413" wikidata="Q2452196" url="?curid=892413" title="Interstate 590">
<text>Interstate 590 (I-590) is a north–south auxiliary Interstate Highway that serves the immediate southeastern suburbs of the city of Rochester, New York, in the United States. It extends for from an interchange with I-390 in Brighton to the Can of Worms, a complex interchange connecting I-590 to I-490 (Eastern Expressway) just inside the Rochester city line. I-590 makes up the southeast quadrant of the Rochester Outer Loop, which continues west on I-390 and north past the Can of Worms on New York State Route 590 (NY 590). The highway is a spur route of I-90; the connection between the two is made via both I-390 and I-490.

The portion of I-590 between Winton Road and the Can of Worms was originally constructed in the 1960s and designated as part of NY 47 from Elmwood Avenue northward. In the late 1970s, I-590 was proposed as a designation for the entire southern half of the Outer Loop. Ultimately, it was cut back to its current western terminus at the then-proposed I-390. I-590 was officially assigned in 1980 following the elimination of NY 47, and the last segment of the freeway between Winton Road and I-390 was completed by the following year.

==Route description==

I-590 begins at a semi-directional T interchange with I-390 in the town of Brighton, a southern suburb of the city of Rochester. The route heads east from the junction, passing under South Clinton Avenue (which passes through the east half of the interchange but does not connect to either freeway) and traveling east through open fields to its first interchange (a diverging diamond interchange [DDI]) at South Winton Road. Here, the surroundings rapidly change from fields to densely populated residential areas as it passes through a more developed section of Brighton. As it approaches NY 31 (Monroe Avenue) at exit 2, I-590 turns a full 90 degrees to the north. Past NY 31, I-590 runs through the former Erie Canal and Rochester subway bed.

The freeway travels due north along this stretch, flanked on both sides by residential neighborhoods separated from I-590 only by sound barriers. Not far to the north of the intersection with NY 31 is exit 3, a partial diamond interchange for Elmwood Avenue permitting access from I-590 south and to I-590 north. Prior to 1980, NY 47 entered the freeway at this point and followed both I-590 and NY 590 north to Sea Breeze. Another partial interchange with Highland Avenue follows at exit 4—making the two connections that exit 3 omits—before I-590 enters the Can of Worms, a complex interchange connecting I-590 to I-490. North of the ramps leading to I-490, I-590 descends northeastward into a cut and passes below both I-490 and NY 96 as it becomes NY 590, which continues onward toward Sea Breeze.

==History==

I-590 appeared on maps of the Rochester area as early as 1977 as a designation for the portion of the Outer Loop south of I-490. At the time, only two portions of the loop—from I-490 in Gates southeast to NY 383 in Chili and from Winton Road in Brighton to I-490 in Rochester—were complete and open to traffic. The western portion was constructed and designated as part of NY 47. The eastern section, which opened from Monroe Avenue (NY 31) to the Can of Worms and from NY 31 west to Winton Road by 1968, was part of NY 47 between Elmwood Avenue and I-490. South of Elmwood Avenue, the expressway had no signed number as the Federal Highway Administration had yet to assign the I-590 designation. Construction on the missing section of the Outer Loop&#x27;s southern half began in the late 1970s.

Around the same time, the state of New York began to look into the possibility of changing the designations that were assigned to the Outer Loop. In one proposal submitted to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials in the late 1970s, I-590 would be truncated to begin at the then-proposed junction with I-390 in Brighton but also extended northward along the Sea Breeze Expressway to NY 104 in Irondequoit. The rest of the loop south of I-490, meanwhile, would become part of an extended I-390. NY 47, the then-current designation for much of the Outer Loop, would be eliminated entirely. Most of the plans went into effect when the NY 47 designation was eliminated on March 18, 1980. The southern half of the Outer Loop was signed as planned; however, I-390 and I-590 were modified to end at their junctions with I-490. The section of I-590 from Winton Road to I-390—as well as the interchange connecting the two—was completed .

In 2012, a DDI was added at the intersection of I-590 and Winton Road in the Brighton suburb of Rochester.

<text>The Northern &amp; Eastern Railway (N&amp;ER) was an early British railway company, that planned to build a line from London to York. Its ambition was cut successively back, and it was only constructed from Stratford, east of London, to the towns of Bishop&#x27;s Stortford and Hertford. It was always short of money, and it got access to London over the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR). It was built at the track gauge of , but it converted to standard gauge in 1844.

Its main line opened progressively between 1840 and 1842. It was worked by the neighbouring ECR, and it leased its network to that company in from the beginning of 1844 for 999 years. From that time it was a financial company only, it amalgamated with the ECR&#x27;s successor, the Great Eastern Railway, in 1902.

The entire network is still in use and is now electrified, and part of the original main line now forms a section of the West Anglia Main Line between London Liverpool Street and Cambridge.

==Proposals==

When the Stockton and Darlington Railway was opened in 1825, great enthusiasm for railway transport was generated. A number of schemes were put forward for connecting London and York, and some of these were planned to pass through Cambridge. A canal engineer, Nicholas Wilcox Cundy, surveyed such a line, to be known as the Grand Northern &amp; Eastern Railway, in 1834, and the following year another survey was made, by Joseph Gibbs, for another line from London through Cambridge to York. This scheme went to Parliament in the 1836 session as a proposed &quot;Great Northern Railway&quot; (nothing to do with the subsequent Great Northern Railway a decade later). The 1836 proposal was rejected by Parliament.
Meanwhile, a public meeting was held at Cambridge Town Hall on 23 January 1836, at which it was decided to support a route surveyed by James Walker. A bill for a &quot;Northern &amp; Eastern Railway&quot; was prepared; it was to run from London to Cambridge, with a branch from a little south of Cambridge to Newmarket, Norwich and Great Yarmouth. The extension from Cambridge to Lincoln was not included, as the surveys had not been completed. The bill was passed as the (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4. c. ciii), but the route was cut back to run from London to Cambridge only; it received royal assent on 4 July 1836. Authorised share capital was £1,200,000. Although the construction cost was large, the company was confident of a 16% return.

==The London terminus, and track gauge==
The N&amp;ER was to have its London terminus at Islington. The topography was such that this would have required tunnelling to reach it, and it was realised that this was an expensive proposition. An approach was made to the Commercial Railway (later the London and Blackwall Railway) with a view to using its final approach to London and Minories terminus. This was unsuccessful, so the ECR was contacted, with a view to using its Shoreditch terminus. This was agreed to, and Parliament ratified the arrangement, so the N&amp;ER&#x27;s planned line was rerouted south of Tottenham to join the ECR at . The rental for this arrangement was to be £7,000 a year, with an additional charge per passenger. The ECR agreed to build a separate terminus at Shoreditch for the N&amp;ER.

When the ECR determined its track gauge of , the N&amp;ER had to adopt the same gauge in order to use the approach tracks. The first section of the ECR was opened on 18 June 1839, from a temporary terminus at Mile End to another temporary terminus at Romford.

==Contract award, and a retrenchment of scope==
At the end of 1837 a contract for construction of the line was awarded to David Macintosh. In March 1838 construction began, with Michael Borthwick as resident engineer. From the beginning, the N&amp;ER was unable to raise the capital it needed for building its line. By May 1837 the contractor was in difficulties, and Robert Stephenson was appointed as engineer-in-chief, with Borthwick continuing as resident engineer. George Parker Bidder was appointed as the new contractor. Engineering contractors Grissell and Peto were approached late in 1837 about building the line as far as Bishop&#x27;s Stortford. In March 1840 they started work between Stratford and Tottenham, and finally took over the work between Tottenham and Broxbourne from David McIntosh.
The N&amp;ER company obtained a further act of Parliament, the (3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. lii), which received royal assent on 4 June 1840; the line beyond Bishop&#x27;s Stortford to Cambridge was abandoned, and the share capital was reduced to £720,000.

==Opening==
On 15 September 1840 the N&amp;ER started operation between the ECR&#x27;s Stratford station and , a distance of about . At first this was a single track; it was doubled in 1841. Trains ran through from , but the ECR insisted that Shoreditch to Stratford journeys were exclusive to them.

The line was extended as far as on 9 August 1841; to (a temporary terminus) on 19 November 1841; and as far as on 16 May 1842.

A criticism of the route of the N&amp;ER was that the line followed the valley of the River Lea, while nearly all of the settlements were on higher ground, and were some distance from their respective stations. was used as the railhead for cattle being brought in to London; they were driven on foot from there to the city markets. In the second half of 1842 a dividend of 2% was paid.

==Hertford branch==
In June 1841 royal assent was given to an act of Parliament, the (4 &amp; 5 Vict. c. xlii) for a branch from Broxbourne to Hertford; it became the present-day Hertford East Branch Line. Work on the Hertford branch line began early in 1843, and it opened as a single track on 31 October 1843. It was doubled in October 1846 (after the lease by the ECR).

==Hockerill==
The northernmost extent of the line was at Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, opened before the end of 1843, when the N&amp;ER ceased to control its own network. However a special arrangement was made to receive excursion trains at Hockerill, or so north of Bishop&#x27;s Stortford station. The overbridge at that point today carries Hockerill Street, and Stortford was then a much smaller community; Hockerill was a distinct village. (The later station on the Dunmow branch was opened in 1910.) An advertisement in &quot;The Times&quot; in October 1843 read:

Newmarket Houghton Meeting—A special train, consisting of first-class carriages only, of the Northern and Eastern Railway, stopping only at Tottenham and Broxbourne, will leave the London Terminus, Shoreditch, for Hockerill, Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, on Monday, 23d inst., at half-past-seven a.m., and return from Hockerill at half-past nine o&#x27;clock at night, thereby enabling persons attending Newmarket to see the whole of the races and return to London the same evening. Ample accommodation may be had at Hockerill should parties prefer to send their private horses and carriages the day before to wait the arrival of the trains. Horse and carriages can be taken on at the Tottenham station, thereby avoiding passing through the city. Previous notice should be given by parties taking their own horses and carriages, to prevent the possibility of disappointment. Extra post horses and carriages will be in attendance to convey persons forward, and may be ordered to be in readiness by sending a letter to Messrs. Edwards and Stokes of Hockerill. Places may be secured [to travel] by coaches meeting the train to Newmarket and back, at the Golden Cross, Charing-cross. Fares—Hockerill to Newmarket and back, inside £1 10s, outside £1 1s.

These excursions were advertised to be run on 9 and 11 October 1843, and (after the lease of the N&amp;ER to the ECR) on 15 and 28 October 1844.

==Leased to the Eastern Counties Railway==

On 25 October 1843 an agreement facilitated by G. P. Bidder was reached by the ECR and N&amp;ER, and from 1 January 1844 the entire N&amp;ER system was leased to the ECR for 999 years; the arrangement was formally ratified by the (7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. xx) in May 1844. The ECR was to pay the N&amp;ER 5% annually on the £970,000 capital cost of building the line, and profits would be apportioned. The N&amp;ER continued as a nominally independent company, receiving the lease charges but not operating any railway; eventually it merged into the Great Eastern Railway in 1902.

==Gauge change==
At the same time as the discussion about the lease took place, the two companies agreed that their uncommon track gauge of was a hindrance, and they decided to alter it to the British standard gauge of . The physical conversion was undertaken between 5 September and 7 October 1844; it was achieved without interruption to the running of trains, except on the Hertford branch.

==Engineering details==
Whishaw reported that the rails are &quot;of the double parallel form&quot; (that is, not fish-bellied and broadly similar to modern bullhead rail) in lengths of . &quot;The upper and lower webs are not of similar section&quot;: Whishaw meant that the head and foot are not identical. The sleepers were of larch, in length, and in cross section. The ballasting was of gravel, of at least in thickness throughout. 
==From 1844==

From the first day of 1844, the N&amp;ER was simply a financial shell company, receiving lease charges from the ECR but not having any rail operations of its own. The N&amp;ER network extended from Stratford to Bishop&#x27;s Stortford and from Broxbourne to Hertford, and it became the stem of the important main line to Cambridge, which was built and owned north of Stortford by the ECR. The approach to London was later altered to run through , but the Stratford to Copper Mill Junction () section was retained, and became a key link for goods traffic approaching Temple Mills Yard.

In 1849 the ECR opened a branch line from to Enfield.

The ECR and certain other companies in the east of England amalgamated to form the Great Eastern Railway (GER) in 1862. The GER adopted a policy of running frequent passenger services on the London suburban lines: in 1864 there were 29 departures per day for the N&amp;ER line. Shoreditch station had been renamed Bishopsgate, but it was obviously inadequate for both main line traffic and N&amp;ER line traffic, and the decision was taken to extend westwards: Liverpool Street station was opened in 1871, with a connection to the underground Metropolitan Railway opening in 1875.

In 1872 a new shorter route towards Broxbourne was opened, from , near Liverpool Street, via to Copper Mill Junction, south of station. In time this became the dominant route from London. In 1891 the Churchbury loop was opened, from Bury Street Junction via to . The area was undeveloped and the sparse train service failed to encourage residential travel. It closed to ordinary passenger trains in 1909.

The N&amp;ER line never became the primary route from London to York (which was the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s route via Peterborough and Newark), but from 1882 the GER participated with the GNR in a joint railway, the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway, which gave it access to Doncaster, and by means of running powers to York. A significant flow of coal ran south from Yorkshire to London over the N&amp;ER&#x27;s line, and for a while an express passenger train, the &quot;Cathedrals Express&quot;, ran over the route. The cathedrals alluded to were Ely, Peterborough and Lincoln, and the service ran from 1892 to 1918.

==The twentieth century==
Passenger use of the line intensified in the 20th century, particularly for residential travel as people became accustomed to travelling longer distances in order to live in more rural surroundings. Cambridge too became increasingly significant as a regional centre, attracting express passenger trains over the route. Goods and mineral traffic too remained dominant, although declining steeply after 1955.

Organisationally the N&amp;ER company was absorbed into the GER in 1902; the GER was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway in 1923 (as part of the &quot;grouping&quot; of the railways) and in 1948 the LNER in turn was nationalised.

The Churchbury Loop from Bury Street Junction, near Enfield, and Cheshunt, had been dormant so far as passenger use was concerned, since 1909. In 1960 it was electrified and reopened as part of a new electrified suburban network; the line was retitled the Southbury loop. At first six trains an hour were run, although this was later reduced. The new suburban electric trains ran as far as Bishop&#x27;s Stortford and Hertford. For the time being the southern part of the N&amp;ER route remained unelectrified, but electrification was provided from May 1969.

The entire network remains in use at the present day. The dominant traffic is on the section between Copper Mill Junction and Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, part of the route from London Liverpool Street station to Cambridge and Stansted Airport.

Whishaw reported that &quot;At Shoreditch this Company is accommodated with part of the Eastern Counties station. The intermediate stations already opened to the public are at the Lea Bridge Road, Tottenham, Edmonton, Enfield-Highway and Ponder’s End, Waltham Cross, and Broxbourne.&quot; In fact the two parts of Stratford station were to the east of the point of junction; the present day platforms 1 and 2 are on the site of the original N&amp;ER station. The station was approached by Station Road, connecting to Angel Lane. The present-day main entrance in Gibbins Road came much later.

==Locomotives==
The company purchased 14 2-2-2 locomotives from four builders:
* Robert Stephenson and Company
* Bury, Curtis, and Kennedy
* R. B. Longridge and Company (of Bedlington, Northumberland)
* Charles Tayleur and Co (later Vulcan Foundry)
The locomotives were regauged to standard gauge in September and October 1844.

Whishaw said that &quot;The principal engine-station [depot] is near the Stratford junction.&quot;

==Carriages==
Carriages were long and wide. They had six wheels and were first, second or third class with capacity for 24, 32 and 60 to 70 passengers respectively. They had footboards to allow passengers to board at locations with no or low platforms. The third class carriages were open to the elements.

Whishaw had a comment about the carriages: &quot;The carriages on this line present a novelty in being mounted on six instead of four wheels, except those of the Great Western and Blackwall lines. One of the advantages of this mode of construction is, that the carriages are less likely to run off the line, or to give way by reason of an axle breaking on the journey.&quot;

<text>Wckr Spgt is an American musical band, that formed in 1981 in Claremont, California. With influences that include dadaism and punk rock, they were part of an early movement focused primarily on experimental home recording and cassette culture in the Pomona Valley at that time. The band consists of Joel Huschle, Mark Givens, and Dave Carpenter and, over the years, several guest musicians and artists, notably John Darnielle of The Mountain Goats, Ian Carlson of The Desperation Squad, and the members of Nothing Painted Blue (Franklin Bruno, Kyle Brodie, and Peter Hughes).

Early audio cassettes were distributed throughout the Pomona Valley at local music stores. In the 1990s the record label Shrimper distributed Wckr Spgt recordings including 1997&#x27;s &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Dead (Oh, No)&quot;. Their solitary 7-inch EP &#x27;Cream&#x27; (1993) came in a limited edition of 450 in a hand-drawn sleeve sprinkled with glitter.

The Wckr Spgt film &quot;Bug-Free America&quot; was expected in 2006, but has yet to debut.

<text>Gregory Andrew Germann ( ; born February 26, 1958) is an American actor who is known for playing Richard Fish on the television series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, which earned him a Screen Actors Guild award. He also is known for his roles as Eric &quot;Rico&quot; Morrow on the sitcom &quot;Ned &amp; Stacey&quot;, Tom Koracick in &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; and as Hades in Season Five of &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;.

==Career==
===Early work===
He started in several Broadway plays while in New York, including a role in 1982 alongside Matthew Broderick in the play &quot;Fancy This&quot;, which Germann also co-wrote. He received praise for roles in the 1982 musical &quot;Chicago&quot;, and the 1983 musical &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. He continued to have roles in plays before seeing a poster for wanted actors for a film in 1985. He moved to Hollywood to find film success, and got his first role in the teen comedy film, &quot;The Whoopee Boys&quot; in 1986. The supporting role in that film helped Greg&#x27;s career, so he could star in bigger and mainstream films. His next film was 1990&#x27;s &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 2&quot;, in which he played the character Mattson, in the well-received sequel to one of the most popular horror films of all time. &quot; Child&#x27;s Play 2&quot;, and the 1991 romantic comedy &quot;Once Around&quot;, helped the actor gain mainstream success. In 1990, Germann originated the role of John Hinckley Jr. in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Assassins&quot;.

===1990s success and &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;===
After &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 2&quot; and &quot;Once Around&quot; were released, he gained fame as a character named Petey in the 1994 critical and commercial success &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;, and landed a supporting role as Rico on the sitcom &quot;Ned &amp; Stacey&quot;, which lasted from 1995 to 1997.

In 1997, after &quot;Ned &amp; Stacey&quot;, Germann was offered the role as Richard Fish on the legal-comedy series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; which he played for five seasons, from 1997 to 2002. During this time, he received three nominations for the Screen Actors Guild awards, winning one. Germann directed a few &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; episodes, including &quot;Fear of Flirting&quot; (season 5, episode 4). He appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;In Case of Emergency&quot; as Sherman Yablonsky until it was canceled after one season, and was also in the pilot episode of &quot;Eureka&quot;. He did not reprise the role, and his character&#x27;s disappearance was explained in the official comic book as having been reassigned to Alaska.

===2000s work===
After &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; ended Germann starred in several films, including &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, &quot;Sweet November&quot;, and &quot;Joe Somebody&quot;, all being released in 2001. He guest-appeared twice on &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot;.

He got lead roles in 2005 in the family comedies &quot;Family Plan&quot; and &quot;Down and Derby&quot;.

In 2006, he guest-starred in the series, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;

In 2009, he starred in the Nickelodeon made-for-television musical film &quot;Spectacular!&quot;. He portrayed the role of Mr. Virgil Romano.

===2010s work===
In 2010, he played Jerry Erickson in the holiday film &quot;The Santa Incident&quot;.

Germann has appeared in &quot;NCIS&quot; since the season 10 episode &quot;Shiva&quot;, playing NCIS Assistant Director Jerome Craig. Later, in the episode &quot;Canary&quot;, he briefly took over the agency while the director at the time (Leon Vance) was on temporary leave following a family tragedy.

Germann has appeared infrequently in &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; playing ADA Derek Strauss.

In 2016, Germann appeared in the ABC fantasy series drama &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; portraying Hades, the God of the Underworld, for ten episodes. He was in the film &quot;Foster Boy&quot;.

He also appeared as neurosurgeon Tom Koracick in &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;.

==Personal life==
His son with the actress Christine Mourad, Asa Germann, is also an actor.

<text>Ungnadia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapindaceae, containing one species, Ungnadia speciosa, commonly known as the Mexican buckeye. It is native to northern Mexico, as well as Texas and southern New Mexico in the United States. The name honors Austrian ambassador Baron David Ungnad von Sonnegg, son of Andreas Ungnad von Sonnegg, who brought the horse chestnut (&quot;Aesculus hippocastanum&quot;) to Vienna in 1576, introducing the plant into western Europe.

It differs from the buckeyes in the related genus &quot;Aesculus&quot; but the seeds and nuts are similar. Another similar related genus is the soapberry (genus &quot;Sapindus&quot;). &quot;Ungnadia&quot; seeds are poisonous despite their sweetness, and sometimes used as marbles. The foliage is toxic and rarely browsed by livestock, but bees produce honey from the floral nectar.

==Description==
&quot;Ungnadia speciosa&quot; is a deciduous shrub or small tree (&lt; 25 ft) that is often multi-trunked. The leaves () are alternate and pinnately compound with 5 to 9 leaflets. The leaflets are long (), narrow, and pointed with slight serrations.

<text>London Buses is the subsidiary of Transport for London (TfL) that manages most bus services in London, England. It was formed following the Greater London Authority Act 1999 that transferred control of London Regional Transport (LRT) bus services to TfL, controlled by the Mayor of London.

==Overview==
Transport for London&#x27;s key areas of direct responsibility through London Buses are the following:
* planning new bus routes, and revising existing ones
* specifying service levels
* monitoring service quality
* management of bus stations and bus stops
* assistance in &#x27;on ground&#x27; set up of diversions, bus driver assistance in situations over and above job requirements, for example Road Accidents
* providing information for passengers in the form of timetables and maps at bus stops and online, and an online route planning service
* producing leaflet maps, available from Travel Information Centres, libraries etc., and as online downloads.
* operating NMCC, London Buses&#x27; 24‑hour command-and-control centre based in Southwark

===Bus operations===
All bus operations are undertaken under a tendering system in which operators bid for routes in return for a set price per route operated. Until April 2022, contracts were normally for five years, with two-year extensions available if performance criteria were met. From April 2022, contracts will be for seven years with a performance based two year optional extension.

Routes are set up, controlled and tendered out by Transport for London (TfL) and they provide day to day assistance via CentreComm which coordinates a large scale network of Network Traffic Controllers to help with any traffic issues that may occur.
Operators provide staff to drive the buses, provide the buses to operate and also adhere to set TfL guidelines. Operators are then in return paid per mile that each bus runs, the pricing is announced on new tenders.

===Publications===
London Buses publishes a variety of bus maps. In 2002, TfL introduced the first spider maps. Rather than attempting to cover the entire city, these maps are centred on a particular locality or bus station, and convey the route information in the schematic style of Harry Beck&#x27;s influential Tube map, capitalising on TfL&#x27;s iconic style of information design. The arachnoid form of bus routes radiating from a centre earned them the nickname spider maps, although TfL refer to them on their website as route maps. The maps are displayed at most major bus stops, and can be downloaded in PDF format via the Internet from the TfL website.

==Legal status==
The legal identity of London Buses is London Bus Services Limited (LBSL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London. East Thames Buses was the trading name of another wholly owned subsidiary of TfL called, rather confusingly, London Buses Limited (LBL).

LBL was formed on 1 April 1985 as part of the privatisation of London bus services, and acted as an arm&#x27;s-length subsidiary of TfL&#x27;s precursor organisation, London Regional Transport (LRT), holding twelve bus operating units (from late 1988) and other assets. The operating units were sold off in 1994/95, and their purchasers make up the majority of companies awarded bus operating tenders from the current London Buses (LBSL).

After 1994/95, the LBL company lay dormant, passing from LRT to TfL. It was resurrected when East Thames Buses was formed, separated by a Chinese wall from LBSL, and acted as a London bus operator by proxy.

==Scope==
The local bus network in London is one of the largest and most comprehensive in the world. , 8,776 buses operate on over 670 different routes. In 2019/20, 2.09 billion passenger journeys were made.

==Fares and concessions==
Buses in the London Buses network accept Travelcards, Oyster card products (including bus passes and Oyster pay as you go) and contactless debit and credit cards. Cash fares have not been available since 6 July 2014, but Day Bus passes (issued either as a single use Oyster card, or on paper from station ticket machines) were re-introduced on 2 January 2015. Single journey fares used to be charged in relation to length of journey (fare stages), but are now charged as single flat fares for any length of journey. From 2000, the flat fare was higher for journeys in Zone 1 than in outer zones, although from 2004 this difference was eliminated, the change coinciding with the introduction of Oyster card flat fares. , the single fare is £1.75.

With Oyster pay as you go, users are charged a set amount for single journeys, although there is a &quot;daily cap&quot;, which limits the maximum amount of money that will be deducted from the balance, regardless of how many buses are taken that day (from 04.30 to 04.29 the next day). Alternatively, weekly and monthly passes may also be purchased and loaded onto an Oyster card.

Passengers using contactless payment cards are charged the same fares as on Oyster pay as you go. Unlike Oyster cards, contactless cards also have a 7-day fare cap though it currently only operates on a Monday-Sunday basis.

Under 11s can travel free on London buses and trams at any time unaccompanied by an adult; they do not need an Oyster card or a ticket. Children aged 11 to 15 travel free on buses with an 11–15 Oyster photocard; without an Oyster card or Travelcard, they have to pay the full adult fare. Visitors can have a special discount added to an ordinary Oyster card at TfL&#x27;s Travel Information Centres. There are also concessions for London residents aged 16 to 18.

The Freedom Pass scheme allows Greater London residents over state pension age, and those with a disability, to travel free at any time on buses and TfL&#x27;s rail services. People who have concessionary bus passes issued by English local authorities travel free on TfL bus services at any time.

==Operators==

===Current===

Bus services in London are operated by
*Arriva London
*Go-Ahead London
*Metroline
*RATP Dev Transit London
*Stagecoach London
*Transport UK London Bus
*Uno 

===Historic===

*First London
*HCT Group
*Sullivan Buses
*Tower Transit 

Each company has its own operating code, and every bus garage in London has its own garage code.

== Vehicles ==


, the London Buses fleet total of 8,776 buses includes 3,826 hybrid buses, 1,397 battery electric buses, and 20 hydrogen fuel cell buses. The zero emission fleet is the second largest in Europe, behind Moscow. All buses have been accessible and low floor since 2006, one of the first major cities in the world to achieve this.

The various bus operators providing services under contract to London Buses operate a wide variety of vehicles, about the only immediately obvious common feature being their use of a largely red livery, mandatory since 1997, as well as white-painted roofs featuring aerial roof markings to help cool down the bus during the summer, first introduced during 2006. For each bus route, London Buses sets a specification for buses to be used, with the choice of particular vehicle that meets the specification left up to the operator. Particular examples of London Buses specification include the use of separate exit doors (increasingly unusual on buses in the United Kingdom outside London) and, on double-deckers, the use of a straight staircase. Additionally, London Buses has previously specified that vehicles operating in London use traditional printed roller destination blinds, whereas in most other parts of the country, electronic dot matrix or LED displays are the norm on new buses.

===Air conditioning===
As of 2024, no London Buses had passenger air conditioning. Air conditioning is provided for the driver cab, and air cooling for the top deck of double-decker buses, able to reduce the temperature from 35C to 30C. From 2024, the future specification will require air cooling to reduce the temperature from 35C to 26C. This will be available on single-deck buses and on both decks of double-decker buses. New electric single-decker buses use air conditioning with humidity extraction.

==iBus==
All of London&#x27;s buses use the London iBus system, an Automatic Vehicle Location system that provides passengers with audio visual announcements and is able to trigger priority at traffic junctions. The system was on trial in 2006, and was extended to all bus routes by 2009.

<doc id="892446" wikidata="Q1426494" url="?curid=892446" title="Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm">
<text>In mathematics and computing, the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (LMA or just LM), also known as the damped least-squares (DLS) method, is used to solve non-linear least squares problems. These minimization problems arise especially in least squares curve fitting. The LMA interpolates between the Gauss–Newton algorithm (GNA) and the method of gradient descent. The LMA is more robust than the GNA, which means that in many cases it finds a solution even if it starts very far off the final minimum. For well-behaved functions and reasonable starting parameters, the LMA tends to be slower than the GNA. LMA can also be viewed as Gauss–Newton using a trust region approach.

The algorithm was first published in 1944 by Kenneth Levenberg, while working at the Frankford Army Arsenal. It was rediscovered in 1963 by Donald Marquardt, who worked as a statistician at DuPont, and independently by Girard, Wynne and Morrison.

The LMA is used in many software applications for solving generic curve-fitting problems. By using the Gauss–Newton algorithm it often converges faster than first-order methods. However, like other iterative optimization algorithms, the LMA finds only a local minimum, which is not necessarily the global minimum.

== The problem ==
The primary application of the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm is in the least-squares curve fitting problem: given a set of formula_1 empirical pairs formula_2 of independent and dependent variables, find the parameters of the model curve formula_3 so that the sum of the squares of the deviations formula_4 is minimized:

:formula_5 which is assumed to be non-empty.

== The solution ==
Like other numeric minimization algorithms, the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm is an iterative procedure. To start a minimization, the user has to provide an initial guess for the parameter vector . In cases with only one minimum, an uninformed standard guess like formula_6 will work fine; in cases with multiple minima, the algorithm converges to the global minimum only if the initial guess is already somewhat close to the final solution.

In each iteration step, the parameter vector is replaced by a new estimate . To determine , the function formula_7 is approximated by its linearization:

: formula_8

where 
: formula_9 
is the gradient (row-vector in this case) of with respect to .

The sum formula_4 of square deviations has its minimum at a zero gradient with respect to . The above first-order approximation of formula_7 gives
: formula_12
or in vector notation,
: formula_13
Taking the derivative of this approximation of formula_14 with respect to and setting the result to zero gives

:formula_15

where formula_16 is the Jacobian matrix, whose -th row equals formula_17, and where formula_18 and formula_19 are vectors with -th component 
formula_20 and formula_21 respectively. The above expression obtained for comes under the Gauss–Newton method. The Jacobian matrix as defined above is not (in general) a square matrix, but a rectangular matrix of size formula_22, where formula_23 is the number of parameters (size of the vector formula_24). The matrix multiplication formula_25 yields the required formula_26 square matrix and the matrix-vector product on the right hand side yields a vector of size formula_23. The result is a set of formula_23 linear equations, which can be solved for .

Levenberg&#x27;s contribution is to replace this equation by a &quot;damped version&quot;:

:formula_29

where is the identity matrix, giving as the increment to the estimated parameter vector .

The (non-negative) damping factor is adjusted at each iteration. If reduction of is rapid, a smaller value can be used, bringing the algorithm closer to the Gauss–Newton algorithm, whereas if an iteration gives insufficient reduction in the residual, can be increased, giving a step closer to the gradient-descent direction. Note that the gradient of with respect to equals formula_30. Therefore, for large values of , the step will be taken approximately in the direction opposite to the gradient. If either the length of the calculated step or the reduction of sum of squares from the latest parameter vector fall below predefined limits, iteration stops, and the last parameter vector is considered to be the solution.

When the damping factor is large relative to formula_31, inverting formula_32 is not necessary, as the update is well-approximated by the small gradient step formula_33.

To make the solution scale invariant Marquardt&#x27;s algorithm solved a modified problem with each component of the gradient scaled according to the curvature. This provides larger movement along the directions where the gradient is smaller, which avoids slow convergence in the direction of small gradient. Fletcher in his 1971 paper &quot;A modified Marquardt subroutine for non-linear least squares&quot; simplified the form, replacing the identity matrix with the diagonal matrix consisting of the diagonal elements of :

:formula_34

A similar damping factor appears in Tikhonov regularization, which is used to solve linear ill-posed problems, as well as in ridge regression, an estimation technique in statistics.

=== Choice of damping parameter ===
Various more or less heuristic arguments have been put forward for the best choice for the damping parameter . Theoretical arguments exist showing why some of these choices guarantee local convergence of the algorithm; however, these choices can make the global convergence of the algorithm suffer from the undesirable properties of steepest descent, in particular, very slow convergence close to the optimum.

The absolute values of any choice depend on how well-scaled the initial problem is. Marquardt recommended starting with a value and a factor . Initially setting formula_35 and computing the residual sum of squares formula_4 after one step from the starting point with the damping factor of formula_35 and secondly with . If both of these are worse than the initial point, then the damping is increased by successive multiplication by until a better point is found with a new damping factor of for some .

If use of the damping factor results in a reduction in squared residual, then this is taken as the new value of (and the new optimum location is taken as that obtained with this damping factor) and the process continues; if using resulted in a worse residual, but using resulted in a better residual, then is left unchanged and the new optimum is taken as the value obtained with as damping factor.

An effective strategy for the control of the damping parameter, called &quot;delayed gratification&quot;, consists of increasing the parameter by a small amount for each uphill step, and decreasing by a large amount for each downhill step. The idea behind this strategy is to avoid moving downhill too fast in the beginning of optimization, therefore restricting the steps available in future iterations and therefore slowing down convergence. An increase by a factor of 2 and a decrease by a factor of 3 has been shown to be effective in most cases, while for large problems more extreme values can work better, with an increase by a factor of 1.5 and a decrease by a factor of 5.

=== Geodesic acceleration ===

When interpreting the Levenberg–Marquardt step as the velocity formula_38 along a geodesic path in the parameter space, it is possible to improve the method by adding a second order term that accounts for the acceleration formula_39 along the geodesic

:formula_40

where formula_39 is the solution of

:formula_42

Since this geodesic acceleration term depends only on the directional derivative formula_43 along the direction of the velocity formula_44, it does not require computing the full second order derivative matrix, requiring only a small overhead in terms of computing cost. Since the second order derivative can be a fairly complex expression, it can be convenient to replace it with a finite difference approximation

:formula_45

where formula_46 and formula_47 have already been computed by the algorithm, therefore requiring only one additional function evaluation to compute formula_48. The choice of the finite difference step formula_49 can affect the stability of the algorithm, and a value of around 0.1 is usually reasonable in general.

Since the acceleration may point in opposite direction to the velocity, to prevent it to stall the method in case the damping is too small, an additional criterion on the acceleration is added in order to accept a step, requiring that

:formula_50

where formula_51 is usually fixed to a value lesser than 1, with smaller values for harder problems.

The addition of a geodesic acceleration term can allow significant increase in convergence speed and it is especially useful when the algorithm is moving through narrow canyons in the landscape of the objective function, where the allowed steps are smaller and the higher accuracy due to the second order term gives significant improvements.

==Example==

In this example we try to fit the function formula_52 using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm implemented in GNU Octave as the &quot;leasqr&quot; function. The graphs show progressively better fitting for the parameters formula_53, formula_54 used
in the initial curve. Only when the parameters in the last graph are chosen closest to the original, are the curves fitting exactly. This equation
is an example of very sensitive initial conditions for the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. One reason for this sensitivity is the existence of multiple minima — the function formula_55 has minima at parameter value formula_56 and formula_57.

<text>Philip Simmons (June 9, 1912 – June 22, 2009) was an American artisan and blacksmith specializing in the craft of ironwork. Simmons spent 78 years as a blacksmith, focusing on decorative iron work. When he began his career, blacksmiths in Charleston made practical, everyday household objects, such as horseshoes. By the time he retired 77 years later, the craft was considered an art form rather than a practical profession.

Examples of Simmons&#x27; work, including iron gates, can be seen throughout the city of Charleston, South Carolina, as well as the rest of South Carolina Lowcountry. His pieces are displayed at the Smithsonian Museum, South Carolina State Museum, Paris, France, and China.

==Biography==
Philip Simmons was born on June 9, 1912, in Daniel Island, South Carolina. He was raised by his grandparents, before being sent to Charleston in 1920 to live with his mother when he was 8 years old.
 Simmons resided on Vernon Street and enrolled in school at the Buist Elementary School, which is now known as the Buist Academy. Later in his life, Simmons would design and create the iron arch which now stands over the school&#x27;s entry gate.

Simmons became interested in the craftspeople who lived in his neighborhood, and soon began visiting various workshops near his home. In particular, Simmons became interested in a smithy on Charlotte Street run by Peter Simmons, who was not related to Philip. Philip Simmons soon quit school and began an apprenticeship with Peter Simmons, a former slave, when he was 13 years old. He became a full blacksmith when he was 18 years old, after a five-year apprenticeship.

Simmons began working with ornamental and decorative ironwork in 1938 at his own blacksmith shop.

In the early 1940s, Simmons began working with a Charleston businessman named Jack Krawcheck. Krawcheck commissioned a wrought iron gate for the rear of his store, which was located on King Street. However, Simmons had to create the gate out of scrap iron because the demand for iron during World War II made it impossible to acquire new iron. This was the first iron gate that Simmons ever crafted and delivered to a customer. The Krawcheck family would ultimately acquire more than 30 iron pieces from Simmons during his career.

Though he had begun working on ornamental ironwork in 1938, the Krawcheck gate marked a turning point in Simmons&#x27; career as an iron artisan. Over the course of his seven decades long career, Simmons created over 500 separate pieces, including iron balconies, window grilles, fences and gates. For example, Simmons forged and designed five iron gates along Stolls Alley in Charleston alone. In 1976, he created a &quot;star and fish gate&quot; for the Smithsonian Institution, which was designed to look like the fish was swimming.

Simmons also created smaller, metal objects to supplement his income, including tools, shutter dog and fireplace pokers. In 1970, Simmons created a cup holder for a Volvo, which was crafted from a coat hanger.

Most of his work was created at his workshop at his home on Blake Street.

===Recognition===
John Michael Vlach, an author and professor of American studies at George Washington University, penned a biography of Simmons and his work in a 1981 book entitled &quot;Charleston Blacksmith: The Work of Philips Simmons&quot;. The book was re-released as a second, updated edition eleven years later. In a separate essay called, &quot;The Buildings of Charleston,&quot; Vlach later wrote of Simmons&#x27; career, &quot;At the outset of his career he took orders; now he gives them...In the midst of his time-bound trade and even while preserving the historic appearance of Charleston, he remains his own man. He has found self-expression in the communal tradition.&quot;

The National Endowment for the Arts bestowed Simmons with a National Heritage Fellowship in 1982. During his acceptance speech at the ceremony, which Simmons gave following a performance by a blues group, Simmons remarked, &quot;My instrument is an anvil. I guess some of you have heard me play ... a tune on the anvil, the old blacksmith tune. ... I&#x27;m proud of that anvil, really proud. ... That anvil fed me when I was hungry and that anvil clothed me when I was naked. That anvil put shoes on my feet.&quot;

Although he officially retired at age 75, Simmons continued to teach his craft to younger artisans late into his life. In 1991, the Vestry of his church, St. John&#x27;s Reformed Episcopal Church, formed the Philip Simmons Foundation, a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization to develop and maintain a commemorative garden on the grounds of the church as a tribute to the man and his work. The church and garden is located at 91 Anson Street in downtown Charleston, South Carolina. In 2004, a gate designed by Simmons and executed by artisans he taught received a commemorative plaque from the General Services Administration&#x27;s Art in Architecture Program.

A documentary on Simmon&#x27;s life titled &quot;Keeper of The Gate&quot; won the 1995 Southeastern Regional Emmy Award in the category of Cultural Documentary. It was written and directed by David Flander. Simmons and Flander struck a friendship during filming and remained friends. They would go to local Charleston sporting events together.

In 2006, Simmons received an honorary doctorate from South Carolina State University for his contributions to the field of metalworking.

==Later life==
Simmons moved from his home to the Bishop Gadsden Retirement Community in Charleston in the spring of 2008. He died there on June 22, 2009, at 9 P.M. at the age of 97.

==Awards and honors==
Simmons was a recipient of a 1982 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government&#x27;s highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. That year&#x27;s fellowships were the first bestowed by the NEA. On January 31, 1994, he was inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame.

South Carolina Governor David Beasley bestowed the Order of the Palmetto, the state&#x27;s highest honor, on Simmons in 1998. He was later awarded the Elizabeth O&#x27;Neill Verner Governor&#x27;s Award for &quot;Lifetime Achievement in the Arts&quot; in May 2001. He was also honored by the South Carolina Legislature for his work.

Berkeley County School District honored Simmons by naming three public schools located on Daniel Island, his birthplace, after the artist and educator. These include Philip Simmons Elementary, Philip Simmons Middle and Philip Simmons High. All three schools incorporate design elements reminiscent of his work, and murals of his likeness. The sports teams of all three schools are named the Iron Horses in his honor.

<doc id="892454" wikidata="Q3996004" url="?curid=892454" title="Tottenham Hale">
<text>Tottenham Hale is a district of north London and part of the London Borough of Haringey, bounded by the River Lea and located to the south/south-east of Tottenham proper. From 1850 to 1965, it was part of the Municipal Borough of Tottenham, in Middlesex.

The area is currently undergoing major regeneration.

==Etymology==
Tottenham Hale takes its name from the old English word Hale (to hoist or pull), as goods (particularly timber) were unloaded from the River Lea for onward transport by road at this point.

==Character of the area==

Centred around Tottenham Hale station the area was formerly largely industrial in character with an emphasis on timber related products. The industrial sites have become large residential areas and a retail park. The retail park was looted and set alight in the 2011 England riots. Since then there have been a large-scale housing project constructed, and Haringey Council has formulated plans to redevelop the area.

The east of Tottenham Hale borders the London Borough of Waltham Forest and the Walthamstow Reservoirs including the Walthamstow Wetlands. The River Lea runs through the east of Tottenham Hale. This includes the Tottenham Lock and the Pymmes Brook merging with the river. Surrounding these are a series of residential areas: Hale Village, the Ferry Lane Estate, Heron Wharf and the under construction Hale Wharf development.

Hale Village&#x27;s design is based on Hammarby Sjöstad in Stockholm, Sweden.

Tottenham Hale is currently part of a major regeneration programme, which includes £1 billion of development investment, backed by Haringey Council and the GLA.

==Demography==
The district is represented by the Tottenham Hale ward in the London Borough of Haringey. In the 2011 census the ward counted a population of 17,300. The largest ethnic group (making up 22% of the population) was Whites not of British ancestry, followed by White British (18%), Black African (16%) and Black Caribbean (13%). The median age as of 2013 was 29 years. The life expectancy was 78.1 years for males and 84.0 years for females. The median house price as of 2014 was £251,500, compared to £326,500 in the Tottenham Green ward. A majority (54.4%) of homes in the ward were flats/apartments/maisonettes.

==Wildlife==
The nearby Walthamstow Reservoirs and River Lea support a variety of waterfowl including herons, geese, swans, moorhens and coots.

The Walthamstow Reservoirs was awarded a Heritage Lottery grant, funding their development into Europe&#x27;s largest Urban Wetland Park.

The Paddocks Nature Park provides a nesting site for birds such as song thrush, blackbird and various warblers. Weasels and hedgehogs as well as bats reside in the park.

==Economy==
===Tottenham Hale Retail Park===
Tottenham Hale Retail Park is a major retail park located adjacent to the local tube station on Ferry Lane. The site has a total retail space of 200,000 square feet, and is occupied by retailers including Adidas, TK Maxx, Curry&#x27;s, Lidl, Iceland and Costa.

===Industry===
The following companies are or have been located in the Tottenham Hale area:

==Education==
==Transport==
Tottenham Hale station is on the Victoria line and also has National Rail Abellio Greater Anglia services. This includes the Stansted Express, the West Anglia Main Line and the Lea Valley Lines. The station is also part of the proposed Crossrail 2 project.

The redevelopment of Tottenham Hale bus station was completed in December 2014. The railway and Underground station was redeveloped and completed in April 2022. Work has begun on installing an extra National Rail track to increase the frequency of services.

The following bus routes serve the bus station: 41, 76,
123, 192, 230, W4, N41 and N73.

<doc id="892457" wikidata="Q11710251" url="?curid=892457" title="Hugh Bigod (Justiciar)">
<text>Hugh Bigod (c. 1211 – 1266) was Justiciar of England from 1258 to 1260. He was a younger son of Hugh Bigod, 3rd Earl of Norfolk.

In 1258 the Provisions of Oxford established a baronial government of which Hugh&#x27;s elder brother Roger Bigod, 4th Earl of Norfolk was a leading member, and Hugh was appointed Chief Justiciar. He also had wardship of the Tower of London, and, briefly, of Dover Castle. But at the end of 1260 or in early 1261 he resigned these offices, apparently due to dissatisfaction with the new government. Thus in 1263 he joined the royalists, and was present on that side at the Battle of Lewes. That battle took place by a village called Fletching, north of Lewes. Hugh escaped but the King and his son, Prince Edward, were taken prisoner.

==Marriage and issue==
Bigod married, before 5 February 1244, Joan de Stuteville (d. before 6 April 1276), widow of Hugh Wake of Bourne, Lincolnshire, and daughter and heiress of Nicholas de Stuteville by Dervorguille, daughter of Roland Fitz Uchtred, Lord of Galloway, by whom he had four sons and four daughters:

*Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk, who married firstly Aline Basset, and secondly Alice of Hainault, but had no issue by either marriage.
*Ralph Bigod.
*John Bigod, a cleric, who was heir to his elder brother, Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk.
*Richard Bigod.
*Elizabeth Bigod.
*Rohese Bigod.
*Maud Bigod.
*Joan Bigod, who married Sir Philip de Kyme.

There is no contemporary evidence for the assertion, first recorded in the seventeenth century, that Bigod had an earlier wife called Joanna Burnard (or Burnet or Burnell); if indeed a Hugh Bigod married Joanna, it probably was his father that did so.

<text>Tottenham Hale is an interchange station located in Tottenham Hale, North London for London Underground and National Rail services.

On the National Rail network it is on the West Anglia Main Line, from London Liverpool Street, and is served by Greater Anglia and Stansted Express. On the Underground it is on the Victoria line between and . The station is in Travelcard Zone 3.

The station was opened in 1840, with Underground services added in 1968. A new station building and an additional platform has been added as part of a regeneration scheme.

==History==
===19th century===
Locations served by Tottenham Hale trains in previous years included London St Pancras (via the Tottenham and Hampstead Joint Railway), North Woolwich via the low level platforms at (after the Palace Gates Line service was cut back) and York (via Cambridge and the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway). Until recently, the next station served to the south on the line to was , but only a small number of trains to and from Tottenham Hale served Clapton. Clapton is now exclusively served by trains on the branch instead.

The station opened on 15 September 1840 as Tottenham, on the Northern &amp; Eastern Railway (N&amp;ER) line from Stratford in east London to in Hertfordshire. The Northern and Eastern Railway was leased by the Eastern Counties Railway in 1844 who took over operation of the line. The line was initially laid to a gauge of ; however, this had already been identified as non-standard, and between 5 September and 7 October 1844 the whole network was re-laid to .

On 12 September 1858 a passenger train collided with some goods wagons that had been shunted onto the main line. Nobody was seriously injured. Eighteen months later on 20 February 1860 the station was the site of a serious railway accident when a locomotive derailed, killing the driver, fireman and seven passengers.

The Eastern Counties Railway was taken over by the Great Eastern Railway in 1862.

Until 1868 Tottenham Hale was a railhead for cattle traffic from East Anglia. Trains were unloaded there, and the cattle driven miles down what is now the A10 road towards London. In 1868 the link (since removed) to the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway was opened and the cattle traffic transferred to Tufnell Park, which was closer to the site of the cattle market off Caledonian Road.

Four years later in 1872 the route via Clapton was opened, offering a slightly more direct route to Liverpool Street.

In 1875, the suffix &#x27;Hale&#x27; was added to the station&#x27;s name; this was removed in November 1938, before being restored in 1968.

In 1882 the line through Tottenham Hale became part of a major rail freight artery, with the opening of the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway. This provided a link for the Great Eastern from the coalfields in the north to London. This led to a second pair of running lines known as the Slow Lines being added in 1913. The slow lines that exist today were previously known as the fast lines.

===20th century===
On 29 August 1913 a northbound mail train (carrying passengers) ran into the back of a freight train just south of the station at Tottenham South Junction. The cause was a signal passed at danger in foggy conditions. Two passengers were badly injured, 16 less so.

The area was always susceptible to flooding, one of the worst instances being between 18 and 22 February 1919 when the River Lea overflowed its banks and rail traffic was suspended.

In 1919 there were, as well as the two sets of main lines, some private sidings serving local industries. Other sidings in the area were used to clean passenger rolling stock when not in service.

In 1923 operation passed to the London &amp; North Eastern Railway, and following nationalisation in 1948 the station became part of British Railways Eastern Region.

On 12 February 1927 an express passenger train, hauled by LNER Class D15 4-4-0 No. 8808, was in collision with a lorry on a level crossing. Owing to foggy conditions, the train was not travelling at high speed.

On 4 October 1929, another accident occurred at Tottenham North Junction (just south of the station) when a goods train, hauled by LNER Class J15 0-6-0 No. 7938, passed a signal at danger and was hit by a passenger train, which was hauled by LNER Class B17 4-6-0 No. 2808 &quot;Gunton&quot;. There were no fatalities.

On 21 March 1944 (during World War Two) a number of incendiary bombs fell close to the station, destroying a lineside hut.

In 1961 the link from Tottenham South Junction to the Tottenham and Hampstead Line was closed.

On 14 July 1967 planning permission was granted for the addition of the London Underground Victoria line station. The station was renamed Tottenham Hale on 1 September 1968, when it became an interchange station with London Underground on the opening of the first stage of the Victoria line.

The Lea Valley line between Copper Mill Junction and Cheshunt was electrified at 25 kV in 1969. Many of the private goods sidings were removed at this time. Prior to electrification, between 1958 and 1969 passenger services between Cheshunt and London Liverpool Street through Tottenham Hale were normally operated by Class 125 diesel multiple units (which had been purpose-built for the line).

When sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Network SouthEast until the privatisation of British Railways.

In the late 1990s, at the same time as the Stansted Express service to Stansted Airport was started, the British Rail station at Tottenham Hale was totally rebuilt; the Underground station was revamped at the same time. None of the original Victorian station now exists.

With the privatisation of the UK&#x27;s railways in 1994 operation of the station was initially allocated to a business unit which succeeded the old British Railways structure before being taken over by West Anglia Great Northern (WAGN) in January 1997.

===21st century===
Initially owned by Prism Rail, National Express took over operation in July 2000. In 1994 responsibility for the operational infrastructure passed to Railtrack.

In August 2002 signalling control was transferred to the Liverpool Street Integrated Electronic Control Centre (IECC).

The WAGN franchise was replaced in 2004 by One, this was renamed National Express East Anglia.

The following year, following financial difficulties, Railtrack was superseded by Network Rail.

From 11 December 2005, a new service to and from Stratford reintroduced a direct passenger connection between Tottenham Hale and Stratford via the mainly freight line across Walthamstow Marshes. For many years the only service on this route had been a parliamentary &quot;ghost train&quot; to Enfield Town via Stratford operated to save lengthy closure (to passenger) procedures.

In February 2012 operation of the station changed once again, with Greater Anglia taking over the franchise.

== Tottenham Hale Bus Station ==
Tottenham Hale bus station is located beside the railway station.

Following the 2011 England riots which began in Tottenham, a redevelopment of the tube, bus and rail stations was used to encourage investment in the area. The £110 million bus and rail interchange project for Tottenham Hale was completed in 2014. As part of the project the bus station was roofed with ETFE, which is also used in the Eden Project.

The bus station roof was a finalist for Best Urban Design in the 2018 Haringey Design Awards 2018, and in the 2015 British Constructional Steelwork Association Structural Steel Design Awards.

=== Buses ===
The following bus routes serve the bus station London Buses route 41, 76, 123, 192, 230, W4, N41 and N73.

==Services==
Tottenham Hale is served by trains operated by Greater Anglia and on London Underground&#x27;s Victoria line. Services at the station are:

===National Rail===

==Future==
Transport for London has active plans for the station to be expanded.

Specifically, the proposed Tottenham Hale Station Upgrade development comprises the following
elements:

Stages already completed are:

* creating a new landmark entrance to the Station;
* increasing the capacity of the Station concourse, by doubling the size of the current ticket hall;
* improving interchange by relocating the Greater Anglia and London Underground gatelines;
* providing new access to platforms via the new Access for All (AfA) bridge being delivered separately by Network Rail;
* removing the existing subway which links the south side of Ferry Lane with the Station;
Those that have yet to be completed are:

*extending the existing bridge to form a new Station entrance from Hale Village, providing improved access from the east to Tottenham Hale transport interchange;
* re-routing the London Underground escape route and relocating the vent shaft;
* providing a new, upgraded Station control facility; and
* retail units.

The full plans can be seen on Haringey Council&#x27;s website.

Funding is being sought to increase the number of lines from Coppermill Junction (between Lea Bridge and Tottenham Hale) and Meridian Water to provide a turn-up-and-go four trains per hour service for the Lea Valley.

In February 2013, the Crossrail task force of business group London First, chaired by former Secretary of State for Transport Andrew Adonis, published its recommendations on Crossrail 2, favouring a route almost identical to the regional option proposed by TfL in 2011. The report was endorsed by Network Rail.

This proposal will see four tracks restored through Tottenham Hale and direct links to South-West London.

==Movements seeking independence from Canada==

===Newfoundland and Labrador===

There is a secessionist movement in Newfoundland and Labrador based on its unique history, and as a result of its grievances and broken promises with both the federal government and the government of Quebec. Prior to 1949, the area was a self-governing Dominion (Dominion of Newfoundland). &quot;The root of our trouble is centred in the relationship between the two countries, between Newfoundland as a country and Canada&quot; according to James Halley, a former lawyer involved in negotiating a deal to get Newfoundland into Canada in 1949. According to a July 2003 report, secessionism was on the rise. In 2004, a &quot;flag flap&quot; occurred when the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Danny Williams, removed all Canadian flags from government buildings and raised provincial flags instead. Tensions have since eased; however, a non-organized movement has emerged amongst citizens and the ability of potential premiers to appeal to a strong sense of Newfoundland nationalism is imperative to forming a government.

The secessionist movement is most commonly associated with a flag under several names, including the &quot;Pink, White and Green&quot;, &quot;Flag of the Republic of Newfoundland and Labrador&quot;, or officially as the Newfoundland Tricolour.

===Nova Scotia===
Shortly after the Confederation of three British colonies (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and the Province of Canada) to form the Dominion of Canada in 1867, opponents of Confederation in Nova Scotia began promoting the withdrawal of that province from the new confederation. The Anti-Confederation Party won 18 of the 19 Nova Scotia seats in the new House of Commons of Canada in the 1867 general election, and 36 of the 38 seats in the Nova Scotia legislature; however, the party was unsuccessful in achieving independence for Nova Scotia.

In 1990, just before the failure of the Meech Lake Accord, then-premier John Buchanan predicted Nova Scotia and the rest of Atlantic Canada would have to join the United States if the accord failed.

===Quebec===

The Quebec sovereignty movement seeks independence from Canada for the province of Quebec. This movement often seeks what has been termed &quot;sovereignty-association&quot;, which is sovereignty for Quebec within an economic association or union with the rest of Canada. Since the Quiet Revolution, the many available options have garnered support from Quebecers.

The sovereignty movement has spawned a variety of political parties, such as the Parti Québécois, a social democratic political party at the provincial level in Quebec that has governed the province for various periods since 1976, and the Bloc Québécois, which sometimes wins the majority of seats in Quebec. This party aims to promote Quebec&#x27;s sovereignty and purports to defend the interests of Quebec at the federal level of government.

The Front de libération du Québec (FLQ), was a terrorist organization in the 1960s and early 1970s that used violence to promote independence for Quebec. Although they both advocated a sovereigntist agenda, the FLQ and its violent tactics were denounced by the Parti Québécois.

Since the Quiet Revolution, sovereigntist sentiments have been stoked by the patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982 which was introduced without the consent of the National Assembly of Quebec and by numerous failed attempts at constitutional reform, which have sought to address Quebec&#x27;s distinct society. Two provincial referendums, in 1980 and 1995, rejected proposals for sovereignty, with majorities of 60% in 1980 and only 50.6% in 1995, respectively. Given the narrow federalist victory in 1995, a reference was made by the Chrétien government to the Supreme Court of Canada in 1996 regarding the legality of a unilateral secession of Quebec. This resulted in the passage of the Clarity Act in 2000.

===Western Canada===


Numerous political parties in the western provinces, believing there to be no other solution for stemming apparent &quot;Western alienation&quot; by Central Canada, have sought independence. These movements are strongest in Alberta and British Columbia, but lesser ones exist in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. These movements have also assumed that Canada&#x27;s northern territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut) would also be a part of a new Western Canadian union. Parties advocating Western separation include the Western Canada Concept, the Western Independence Party, and the Western Block Party. These parties have not achieved much success, however.

In the early 1980s, in Saskatchewan, the Unionest Party advocated the western provinces join the United States.

In 1995, Premier of Saskatchewan Roy Romanow secretly formed a committee on consequences if Quebec seceded. The most seriously studied option was strengthening Saskatchewan&#x27;s relationships with other western provinces because Romanow said in 2014, Ontario would become closer to the US economically and Atlantic Canada would become &quot;an island&quot;. Other possibilities included also seceding from Canada, and joining the US. Romanow said that predecessor Allan Blakeney had similarly studied options for Saskatchewan during the 1980 Quebec referendum.

On July 12, 2003, the Western Independence Party of Saskatchewan (WIPS) was created and registered as a Provincial Party, running candidates in 17 ridings in the 2003 Saskatchewan general election. It was de-registered in May 2019.

A poll by the &quot;Western Standard&quot; conducted from June 29, 2005, to July 5, 2005, finds 35.6% of residents of the four provinces think &quot;Western Canadians should begin to explore the idea of forming their own country.&quot;

On January 12, 2020, the Wexit party, a party advocating for separation, was formed federally.

====Alberta====

The Alberta Independence Party promoted independence for the province of Alberta, either on its own or in union with the other western provinces, in the 1990s, but it is now defunct. The Separation Party of Alberta nominated candidates in the 2004 Alberta provincial election.

====Manitoba====
In January–February 1868, a small group of settlers declared a Republic of Caledonia, later the Republic of Manitobah, at Portage-la-Prairie in Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company land that was to be incorporated into Canada. These settlers aimed to use this declaration to obtain favourable terms (for themselves) for the entry of the area into Confederation. The declaration was not recognized by Canadian or British authorities, and the republic soon collapsed.

In the 19th century, the Manitoban secessionist movement has support from the Fenians and secessionist Liberals.

====British Columbia and Yukon====

The Vancouver Island Party is the first secessionist movement that aims to secede from British Columbia and become a separate province by 2021, instead of leaving Canada like other secession movements.

=== Cascadia ===
The Cascadian Independence movement seeks separation from Canada and the United States.

==Other movements==

===Republic of Madawaska===
The Republic of Madawaska occupied what is now the northwest corner of New Brunswick, and lies partially in Quebec and the American state of Maine. The origins of the so-called republic lie in the 1783 Treaty of Versailles, which established the border between the United States of America and the British North American colonies. The Madawaska region remained in dispute between Britain and the US until 1842. In Canada, Madawaska was considered part of Quebec until the 1850s, when the border with New Brunswick was modified. The &quot;Republic&quot; is now a purely ceremonial entity.

==In popular culture==
Occasionally regions of Canada have declared themselves to be &quot;independent&quot; in a non-serious, satirical or promotional way. These &quot;movements&quot; are taken for what they are and not considered secessionist.

===Republic of Rathnelly===
The Rathnelly neighbourhood in Toronto made headlines in 1967, while celebrating Canada&#x27;s 100th birthday. During the celebrations, Rathnelly residents playfully declared themselves as a republic independent of Canada. To mark their independence, the &quot;Republic of Rathnelly&quot; elected a queen, organized a parade, and issued Republic of Rathnelly passports to everyone in the neighbourhood. The new nation conscripted all 8- to 14-year-old citizens to form a militia, known as the Rathnelly Irregulars, and armed them with 1,000 helium balloons (the Rathnelly &quot;air force&quot;). The &quot;Republic of Rathnelly&quot; continues to hold annual street parties.
