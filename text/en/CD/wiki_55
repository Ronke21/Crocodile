<text>&quot;Something&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1969 studio album &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. It was written by George Harrison, the band&#x27;s lead guitarist. Together with his second contribution to &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;, it is widely viewed by music historians as having marked Harrison&#x27;s ascendancy as a composer to the level of the Beatles&#x27; principal songwriters, John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Two weeks after the album&#x27;s release, the song was issued on a double A-side single, coupled with &quot;Come Together&quot;, making it the first Harrison composition to become a Beatles A-side. The pairing was also the first time in the United Kingdom that the Beatles issued a single containing tracks already available on an album. While the single&#x27;s commercial performance was lessened by this, it topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States as well as charts in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and West Germany, and peaked at number 4 in the UK.

The track is generally considered a love song to Pattie Boyd, Harrison&#x27;s first wife, although Harrison offered alternative sources of inspiration in later interviews. Owing to the difficulty he faced in getting more than two of his compositions onto each Beatles album, Harrison first offered the song to Joe Cocker. As recorded by the Beatles, the track features a guitar solo that several music critics identify among Harrison&#x27;s finest playing. The song also drew praise from the other Beatles and their producer, George Martin, with Lennon stating that it was the best song on &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. The promotional film for the single combined footage of each of the Beatles with his respective wife, reflecting the estrangement in the band during the months preceding their break-up in April 1970. Harrison subsequently performed the song at his Concert for Bangladesh shows in 1971 and throughout the two tours he made as a solo artist.

&quot;Something&quot; received the Ivor Novello Award for the &quot;Best Song Musically and Lyrically&quot; of 1969. By the late 1970s, it had been covered by over 150 artists, making it the second-most covered Beatles composition after &quot;Yesterday&quot;. Shirley Bassey had a top-five UK hit with her 1970 recording, and Frank Sinatra regularly performed the song, calling it &quot;the greatest love song of the past 50 years.&quot; Other artists who have covered it include Elvis Presley, Ray Charles, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, James Brown, Smokey Robinson and Johnny Rodriguez. In 1999, Broadcast Music Incorporated named &quot;Something&quot; as the 17th-most performed song of the twentieth century, with 5 million performances. In 2000, &quot;Mojo&quot; ranked &quot;Something&quot; at number 14 in the magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;; it was ranked 110th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2021 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. In 2002, a year after Harrison&#x27;s death, McCartney and Eric Clapton performed it at the Concert for George tribute at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall.

==Background and inspiration==

George Harrison began writing &quot;Something&quot; in September 1968, during a session for the Beatles&#x27; self-titled double album, also known as &quot;the White Album&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewisohn/Mojo Beatles Final Years&quot;&gt;Mark Lewisohn, &quot;Something Else&quot;, in &quot;Mojo Special Limited Edition&quot;, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot;, he recalls working on the melody on a piano, at the same time as Paul McCartney recorded overdubs in a neighbouring studio at London&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios. Harrison suspended work on the song, believing that with the tune having come to him so easily, it might have been a melody from another song. In &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot;, he wrote that the middle eight &quot;took some time to sort out&quot;.

The opening lyric was taken from the title of &quot;Something in the Way She Moves&quot;, a track by James Taylor, another Apple Records artist. While Harrison imagined the composition in the style of Ray Charles, his inspiration for &quot;Something&quot; was his wife, Pattie Boyd. In her 2007 autobiography, &quot;Wonderful Today&quot;, Boyd recalls: &quot;He told me, in a matter-of-fact way, that he had written it for me. I thought it was beautiful ...&quot; Boyd discusses the song&#x27;s popularity among other recording artists and concludes: &quot;My favourite [version] was the one by George Harrison, which he played to me in the kitchen at Kinfauns.&quot;

Having begun to write love songs that were directed at both God and a woman, with his White Album track &quot;Long, Long, Long&quot;, Harrison later cited alternative sources for his inspiration for &quot;Something&quot;. In early 1969, according to author Joshua Greene, Harrison told his friends from the Hare Krishna Movement that the song was about the Hindu deity Krishna; in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1976, he said of his approach to writing love songs: &quot;all love is part of a universal love. When you love a woman, it&#x27;s the God in her that you see.&quot; By 1996, Harrison had denied writing &quot;Something&quot; for Boyd. That year, he told a music journalist that &quot;everybody presumed I wrote it about Pattie&quot; because of the promotional film accompanying the release of the Beatles&#x27; recording, which showed the couple together.
==Composition==
In the version issued on the Beatles&#x27; 1969 album &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, which was the first release for the song, &quot;Something&quot; runs at a speed of around 66 beats per minute and is in common time throughout. It begins with a five-note guitar figure, which functions as the song&#x27;s chorus, since it is repeated before each of the verses and also closes the track. The melody is in the key of C major until the eight-measure-long bridge, or middle eight, which is in the key of A major. Harrison biographer Simon Leng identifies &quot;harmonic interest ... [in] almost every line&quot; of the song, as the melody follows a series of descending half-steps from the tonic over the verses, a structure that is then mirrored in the new key, through the middle eight. The melody returns to C major for the guitar solo, the third verse, and the outro.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack/Something&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Leng considers that, lyrically and musically, &quot;Something&quot; reflects &quot;doubt and striving to attain an uncertain goal&quot;. Author Ian Inglis writes of the confident statements that Harrison makes throughout regarding his feelings for Boyd. Referring to lines in the song&#x27;s verses, Inglis writes: &quot;there is a clear and mutual confidence in the reciprocal nature of their love; he muses that [Boyd] &#x27;attracts me like no other lover&#x27; and &#x27;all I have to do is think of her,&#x27; but he is equally aware that she feels the same, that &#x27;somewhere in her smile, she knows. Similarly, when Harrison sings in the middle eight that &quot;You&#x27;re asking me will my love grow / I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t know&quot;, Inglis interprets the words as &quot;not an indication of uncertainty, but a wry reflection that his love is already so complete that it may simply be impossible for it to become any greater&quot;. Richie Unterberger of AllMusic describes &quot;Something&quot; as &quot;an unabashedly straightforward and sentimental love song&quot; written at a time &quot;when most of the Beatles&#x27; songs were dealing with non-romantic topics or presenting cryptic and allusive lyrics even when they were writing about love&quot;.

==Pre-&quot;Abbey Road&quot; recording history==
===The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Get Back/Let It Be&quot; rehearsals===
Harrison introduced &quot;Something&quot; at a Beatles session on 19 September 1968, when he played it to George Martin&#x27;s stand-in as producer of &quot;The Beatles&quot;, Chris Thomas, while the latter was working out the harpsichord part for Harrison&#x27;s track &quot;Piggies&quot;. Despite Thomas&#x27;s enthusiasm for the new composition, Harrison chose to focus on &quot;Piggies&quot;. He told Thomas that he intended to offer &quot;Something&quot; to singer Jackie Lomax, whose debut album Harrison was producing for Apple Records. &quot;Something&quot; was not among the tracks released on Lomax&#x27;s album, much of which was recorded in Los Angeles after &quot;The Beatles&quot; was completed.

After Harrison rejoined the Beatles in January 1969 for their &quot;Get Back&quot; film project (later released as &quot;Let It Be&quot;), &quot;Something&quot; was one of many recent compositions that he offered to the group. Leng describes this period as a prolific one for Harrison as a songwriter, comparing it with John Lennon&#x27;s peak of creativity over 1963–64, yet Harrison&#x27;s songs received little interest from Lennon and McCartney amid the tense, uncooperative atmosphere within the band. Martin was also unimpressed by &quot;Something&quot; at first, considering it &quot;too weak and derivative&quot;, according to music journalist Mikal Gilmore.

The Beatles rehearsed the song at Apple Studio on 28 January. With the proceedings being recorded by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg for the planned documentary film, tapes reveal Harrison discussing his unfinished lyrics for &quot;Something&quot; with Lennon and McCartney, since he had been unable to complete the song&#x27;s second line, which begins &quot;Attracts me ...&quot; To serve as a temporary filler, Lennon suggested &quot;like a cauliflower&quot;, which Harrison then altered to &quot;like a pomegranate&quot;. In their study of the available tapes, Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt write that the Beatles gave the song two run-throughs that day, which was the only occasion that they attempted it during the &quot;Get Back&quot;/&quot;Let It Be&quot; project.

===Harrison solo demo===
Following the Beatles&#x27; brief efforts with &quot;Something&quot; on 28 January, Harrison talked with Lennon and Yoko Ono about recording a solo album of his unused songs, since he had already stockpiled enough compositions &quot;for the next ten years&quot;, given his usual allocation of two tracks per album, and to &quot;preserve this, the Beatle bit, more&quot;. Lennon offered his support for the idea, similarly keen that his and Ono&#x27;s recording projects outside the Beatles could continue without jeopardising the band&#x27;s future. On 25 February 1969 – his 26th birthday – Harrison entered Abbey Road Studios and taped solo demos of &quot;Something&quot;, &quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot; and &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, the last two of which had also been rejected recently by Lennon and McCartney.

With Ken Scott serving as his engineer, he recorded a live take of &quot;Something&quot;, featuring electric guitar and vocal. By this point, Harrison had completed the lyrics, although he included an extra verse, sung to a counter-melody, over the section that would comprise his guitar solo on the Beatles&#x27; subsequent official recording. This demo version of &quot;Something&quot; remained unreleased until its inclusion on the Beatles&#x27; outtake collection &quot;Anthology 3&quot; in 1996.

===Joe Cocker demo===
In March 1969, Harrison gave &quot;Something&quot; to Joe Cocker to record, having decided that it was more likely to become a hit with Cocker than with Lomax. Referring to this and similar examples where Harrison placed his overlooked songs with other recording artists, Ken Scott has rebutted the idea that he lacked confidence as a songwriter in the Beatles, saying:

I think he was totally confident about the songs. The insecurity may have been, if the Beatles kept going, &quot;How many songs am I going to be able to get on each album?&quot;, and with the backlog sort of mounting up ... [to] get it out there, and get something from it.

Assisted by Harrison, Cocker recorded a demo of the song at Apple. While musicologist Walter Everett suggests that this was the same recording of &quot;Something&quot; that appeared on the &quot;Joe Cocker!&quot; album in November 1969, Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn writes that Cocker subsequently remade the track.

==Recording and production==
The Beatles undertook the recording of &quot;Abbey Road&quot; with a sense of discipline and cooperation that had largely been absent while making the White Album and &quot;Let It Be&quot;. Having temporarily left the group in January 1969, partly as a result of McCartney&#x27;s criticism of his musicianship, Harrison exhibited a greater level of assertiveness regarding his place in the band, particularly while they worked on his compositions &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;. In addition, like Lennon and McCartney, Martin had come to fully appreciate Harrison as a songwriter, later saying: &quot;I first recognised that he really had a great talent when we did &#x27;Here Comes the Sun.&#x27; But when he brought in &#x27;Something,&#x27; it was something else ... It was a tremendous work – and so simple.&quot;

The group recorded &quot;Something&quot; on 16 April before Harrison decided to redo the song, a new basic track for which was then completed at Abbey Road on 2 May. The line-up was Harrison on Leslie-effected rhythm guitar, Lennon on piano, McCartney on bass, Ringo Starr on drums, and guest musician Billy Preston playing Hammond organ. On 5 May, at Olympic Sound Studios, McCartney re-recorded his bass part and Harrison added lead guitar. According to EMI engineer Geoff Emerick, Harrison asked McCartney to simplify his playing, but McCartney refused. At this point, the song ran to eight minutes, due to the inclusion of an extended, jam-like coda led by Lennon&#x27;s piano.

After taking a break from recording, the band returned to &quot;Something&quot; on 11 July, when Harrison overdubbed what would turn out to be a temporary vocal. With the resulting reduction mix, much of the coda, along with almost all of Lennon&#x27;s playing on the main part of the song, was cut from the recording. The piano can be heard only in the middle eight, specifically during the descending run that follows each pair of &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; vocal lines. On 16 July, Harrison recorded a new vocal, with McCartney overdubbing his harmony vocal over the middle eight and Starr adding both a second hi-hat part and a cymbal.

Following another reduction mix, at which point the remainder of the coda was excised from the track, Martin-arranged string orchestration was overdubbed on 15 August, as Harrison, working in the adjacent studio at Abbey Road, re-recorded his lead guitar part live. Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2002, David Fricke described the Beatles&#x27; version of &quot;Something&quot; as &quot;actually two moods in one: the pillowy yearning of the verses ... and the golden thunder of the bridge, the latter driven by Ringo Starr&#x27;s military flourish on a high-hat cymbal&quot;. Leng highlights Harrison&#x27;s guitar solo on the recording as &quot;a performance that is widely regarded as one of the great guitar solos&quot;, and one in which Harrison incorporates the gamaks associated with Indian classical music, following his study of the sitar in 1965–68, while also foreshadowing the expressive style he would adopt on slide guitar as a solo artist.

==Release==
===Selection for single release===

Apple Records issued &quot;Abbey Road&quot; on 26 September 1969, with &quot;Something&quot; sequenced as the second track, following Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Come Together&quot;. Lennon considered &quot;Something&quot; to be the best song on the album. Having ensured that &quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot; was chosen as the B-side for the Beatles&#x27; single &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot;, according to his later recollection, Lennon now pushed Allen Klein to release &quot;Something&quot; as a single from &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. Coupled with &quot;Come Together&quot;, the single was issued on 6 October in America (as Apple 2654) and 31 October in Britain (as Apple R5814).

The release marked the first time that a Harrison composition had been afforded A-side treatment on a Beatles single, as well as the only time during their career that a single was issued in the UK featuring tracks already available on an album. In a 1990 letter to Mark Lewisohn, Klein rebutted a claim made by Lewisohn in his book &quot;The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions&quot;, that the single was intended as a money-making exercise: Klein said it was purely a mark of Lennon&#x27;s regard for &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;to point out George as a writer, and give him courage to go in and do his own LP. Which he did.&quot; Following the Beatles&#x27; break-up in April 1970, Harrison&#x27;s ascendancy as a songwriter would continue with his triple album &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, building on the promise of White Album tracks such as &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; and his two contributions to &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.

===Promotional film===

The promotional film for &quot;Something&quot; was shot in late October 1969, not long after Lennon privately announced that he was leaving the band. By this time, the band members had grown apart. As a result, the film consisted of separate clips, edited together, featuring the Beatles walking around the grounds of their homes with their respective wives. Harrison&#x27;s segment shows him and Boyd together in the garden at Kinfauns; in author John Winn&#x27;s description, Harrison appears &quot;solemn&quot; while Boyd is seen &quot;smiling sweetly&quot; and &quot;sporting leather and fur coats&quot;. Winn also comments on the attractiveness of all the wives in contrast to the unkempt appearance of McCartney, especially, who had sunk into depression at the realisation that the Beatles were over. The four segments were edited and compiled into a single film clip by Neil Aspinall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kozinn/NYT&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; following Aspinall&#x27;s death in 2008, Allan Kozinn said: &quot;What Mr. Aspinall&#x27;s idyllic film avoided showing was that the Beatles were at that point barely on speaking terms. In the film, no two Beatles are seen together.&quot;

In 2015, following restoration overseen by Apple&#x27;s Jonathan Clyde, the &quot;Something&quot; promo film was included in the Beatles&#x27; video compilation &quot;1&quot; and its expanded edition, &quot;1+&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist Rob Sheffield comments on the significance of the clip, with regard to the band&#x27;s history:

[E]ach couple projects a totally different vibe – George and Patti peacocking in their hippie-royalty finery, Paul and Linda on the farm in Scotland with Martha the sheepdog, Ringo and Maureen goofing around on motorbikes, John and Yoko serene in their matching black robes. Each Beatle looks like he&#x27;s found what he was looking for – but they&#x27;re heading for four separate futures.
In her review of &quot;1+&quot;, for &quot;Paste&quot;, Gillian Gaar says that with the Beatles&#x27; promotional films of their singles, from &quot;Love Me Do&quot; to &quot;Something&quot; (the last one they made during their career), &quot;you can see the development of the promo clip, progressing from a short film that simply served up a straight performance to a piece of work that was striving to be something more artistic.&quot;

==Critical reception==
===Contemporary reviews===
&quot;Time&quot; magazine declared &quot;Something&quot; to be the best track on &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, while John Mendelsohn wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;George&#x27;s vocal, containing less adenoids and more grainy Paul tunefulness than ever before, is one of many highlights on his &#x27;Something,&#x27; some of the others being more excellent drum work, a dead catchy guitar line, perfectly subdued strings, and an unusually nice melody. Both his and Joe Cocker&#x27;s version will suffice nicely until Ray Charles gets around to it.&quot; Writing in &quot;Saturday Review&quot; magazine, Ellen Sander described &quot;Something&quot; as &quot;certainly one of the most beautiful songs George Harrison has ever written&quot; and added: &quot;He feels his way through the song, instinctively cutting through its body and into the core, emoting so clearly and so gracefully that at the moment he peals &#x27;I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t know,&#x27; it is shown that even what is not known can be understood.&quot;

According to Beatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner, &quot;Something&quot; showed Harrison following McCartney&#x27;s populist approach and some &quot;long-haired music critics&quot; were repelled by the song&#x27;s use of lush MOR-style orchestration. An outspoken critic of &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Nik Cohn derided it and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; as &quot;mediocrity incarnate&quot;. By contrast, Lon Goddard of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; described the song as &quot;another beautiful Harrison composition&quot; in the style of &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, saying that &quot;It leaps scales in its heavy orchestral arrangement, then drifts down to George&#x27;s simple but effective guitar style.&quot;

In his review of the single, Derek Johnson of the &quot;NME&quot; lauded the track as &quot;a real quality hunk of pop&quot; with a &quot;strident lead guitar which exudes a mean and moody quality&quot;. Johnson stated his regret that Harrison &quot;isn&#x27;t featured more regularly as a singer&quot;, and concluded of &quot;Something&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s a song that grows on you, and mark my words, it will – in a big way!&quot; As guest singles reviewer for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Keef Hartley said it was &quot;probably the best track&quot; on &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, adding: &quot;What I was waiting for was that guitar solo because George Harrison is just about the only guitar player I know of who can plan a solo so it doesn&#x27;t sound as though it is planned.&quot;

===Commercial performance===
Although its commercial impact was lessened by the ongoing success of the parent album, &quot;Something&quot; / &quot;Come Together&quot; was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 27 October. During the single&#x27;s chart run on &quot;Billboard&quot; in the US, &quot;Something&quot; peaked at number 3 until the magazine changed its practice of counting sales and airplay separately for each song; following this change on 29 November, the single topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mapes/BB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for one week. &quot;Come Together&quot; / &quot;Something&quot; became the Beatles&#x27; eighteenth number 1 single in &quot;Billboard&quot;, surpassing Elvis Presley&#x27;s record of seventeen. In the other US national charts, &quot;Record World&quot; listed &quot;Something&quot; / &quot;Come Together&quot; at number 1 for two weeks and &quot;Come Together&quot; / &quot;Something&quot; for the remaining three weeks at number 1, while in &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine, which continued to rank each song separately, &quot;Something&quot; peaked at number 2 and &quot;Come Together&quot; spent three weeks at number 1.

As the preferred side, &quot;Something&quot; was number 1 in Canada (for five weeks), Australia (five weeks), West Germany (two weeks), New Zealand and Singapore. The combined sides reached number 4 in Britain. There, the release was highly unusual, given the traditional preference for non-album singles. In addition, according to former &quot;Mojo&quot; editor Paul Du Noyer, &quot;so enormous were sales of &quot;Abbey Road&quot; that demand for the single was inevitably dampened.&quot;

Along with &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;, &quot;Something&quot; was included on the Beatles&#x27; 1973 compilation album &quot;1967–1970&quot;, thereby giving Harrison two of the four tracks representing &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. In 1976, Capitol sequenced it as the opening track of &quot;The Best of George Harrison&quot;, a compilation that, against Harrison&#x27;s wishes, combined his best-known compositions from the Beatles era with his hits as a solo artist. The song was subsequently included on the band&#x27;s themed compilations &quot;Love Songs&quot; and &quot;The Beatles Ballads&quot;.

On 17 February 1999, &quot;Something&quot; was certified double Platinum by the RIAA. In its 2014 list titled &quot;The Beatles&#x27; 50 Biggest Billboard Hits&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot; places the double A-side single in sixth place, immediately after &quot;Let It Be&quot; and ahead of &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;.

==Retrospective assessments and legacy==

Along with &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;, the song established Harrison as a composer to match Lennon and McCartney. Writing in his book &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot;, author and critic Ian MacDonald described &quot;Something&quot; as &quot;the acme of Harrison&#x27;s achievement as a writer&quot;. MacDonald highlighted the song&#x27;s &quot;key-structure of classical grace and panoramic effect&quot;, and cited the lyrics to verse two as &quot;its author&#x27;s finest lines – at once deeper and more elegant than almost anything his colleagues ever wrote&quot;.

Like Lennon, both McCartney and Starr held the song in high regard. In the 2000 book &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;, Starr paired &quot;Something&quot; with &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; as &quot;Two of the finest love songs ever written&quot;, adding, &quot;they&#x27;re really on a par with what John and Paul or anyone else of that time wrote&quot;; McCartney said it was &quot;George&#x27;s greatest track – with &#x27;Here Comes the Sun&#x27; and &#x27;While My Guitar Gently Weeps. Among Harrison&#x27;s other peers, Paul Simon described &quot;Something&quot; as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and Elton John said: Something&#x27; is probably one of the best love songs ever, ever, written ... It&#x27;s better than &#x27;Yesterday,&#x27; much better ... It&#x27;s like the song I&#x27;ve been chasing for the last thirty-five years.&quot;

In a 2002 article for &quot;The Morning News&quot;, Kenneth Womack included Harrison&#x27;s guitar solo on the track among his &quot;Ten Great Beatles Moments&quot;. Describing the instrumental break as &quot;the song&#x27;s greatest lyrical feature – even more lyrical, interestingly enough, than the lyrics themselves&quot;, Womack concluded: &quot;A masterpiece in simplicity, Harrison&#x27;s solo reaches toward the sublime, wrestles with it in a bouquet of downward syncopation, and hoists it yet again in a moment of supreme grace.&quot; &quot;Guitar World&quot; included the performance as the magazine&#x27;s featured solo in June 2011. Later that year, &quot;Something&quot; was one of the two &quot;key tracks&quot; highlighted by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; when the magazine placed Harrison at number 11 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists&quot;.

In July 1970, &quot;Something&quot; received the Ivor Novello Award for &quot;Best Song Musically and Lyrically&quot; of 1969. In 2005, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) named it as the 64th-greatest song ever. According to the BBC, the song &quot;shows more clearly than any other song in The Beatles&#x27; canon that there were three great songwriters in the band rather than just two&quot;. The Beatles&#x27; official website states that &quot;Something&quot; &quot;underlined the ascendance of George Harrison as a major songwriting force&quot;.

&quot;Something&quot; became the second most covered Beatles song after &quot;Yesterday&quot;. In 1999, Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) named it as the 17th-most performed song of the twentieth century, with 5 million performances. In 2000, &quot;Mojo&quot; ranked &quot;Something&quot; at number 14 in the magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. It was ranked 273rd on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2004 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, 278th on the magazine&#x27;s revised list in 2010, and 110th in 2021. In 2006, &quot;Mojo&quot; placed it 7th in the list of &quot;The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mojo/101 Greatest&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while four years later, the track appeared at number 6 on a similar list compiled by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In 2019, the staff of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;Something&quot; at number 5 in their list of the Beatles&#x27; best songs.

==Cover versions==
===Shirley Bassey===

Among the song&#x27;s many cover versions, Welsh singer Shirley Bassey recorded a successful version of &quot;Something&quot;. It was released in 1970 as the title track to her album of the same name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bassey/AM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Also issued as a single, it became Bassey&#x27;s first top-ten hit in the UK since &quot;I (Who Have Nothing)&quot; in 1963, peaking at number 4 and spending 22 weeks on the chart. The single also reached the top twenty in other European countries and peaked at number 6 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Easy Listening (later Adult Contemporary) chart.

Bassey said she had been unaware of the song&#x27;s origins when recording &quot;Something&quot;. She later suggested that she and Harrison could become a singer-and-songwriter pairing on the scale of Dionne Warwick and Burt Bacharach. After reading these comments in 1970, Harrison wrote &quot;When Every Song Is Sung&quot; with Bassey in mind, although she never recorded the composition.

===Frank Sinatra===
Frank Sinatra was particularly impressed with &quot;Something&quot;, calling it &quot;the greatest love song of the past 50 years&quot;, despite having long disapproved of the Beatles. According to Du Noyer, he &quot;especially admired the way the lyric evokes a girl who isn&#x27;t even present&quot;. Aside from performing &quot;Something&quot; numerous times in concert, Sinatra recorded the song for a single in October 1970 and then for his 1980 triple album &quot;&quot;.

During his live performances, Sinatra was known to mistakenly introduce &quot;Something&quot; as a Lennon–McCartney composition. By 1978, he had begun correctly crediting Harrison as its author. Harrison went on to adopt Sinatra&#x27;s minor lyrical change (in the song&#x27;s middle eight, singing &quot;You stick around, Jack ...&quot;) in his live performances over 1991–92. In &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;, Harrison says he viewed Sinatra as being part of &quot;the generation before me&quot; and so only later came to appreciate the American singer&#x27;s adoption of the song.

Harrison&#x27;s composition began accumulating cover versions almost immediately after the release of &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, starting with Joe Cocker&#x27;s recording. The song became a standard and was readily adapted by artists in a wide range of styles, including easy-listening and instrumental jazz. In Nicholas Schaffner&#x27;s description, the many interpretations made the song ubiquitous &quot;from the Borscht Belt to the dentist&#x27;s waiting room&quot;.

Lena Horne recorded &quot;Something&quot; in the jazz style for her 1970 album with guitarist Gabor Szabo, titled &quot;Lena &amp; Gabor&quot;. An instrumental version by Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, from their &quot;Abbey Road&quot; tribute album &quot;McLemore Avenue&quot;, peaked at number 76 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in August 1970. The R&amp;B groups the O&#x27;Jays and Smokey Robinson and the Miracles also covered it, as did easy-listening stars such as Bert Kaempfert and Liberace. Fulfilling Harrison&#x27;s hopes, Ray Charles issued a version on his 1971 album &quot;Volcanic Action of My Soul&quot;.

Referring to the song&#x27;s adoption by easy-listening artists, Harrison later said: &quot;When even Liberace covered it [in 1970], you know that it&#x27;s one of them that ends up in an elevator ...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellen/Q&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison attributed its popularity among other artists to the easily mastered, five-note melody. Du Noyer partly refutes this explanation, saying that it was equally a vehicle for &quot;the most advanced vocalists&quot; such as Peggy Lee, along with Sinatra and Bassey.
&quot;Something&quot; was one of the very few Beatles songs that Elvis Presley chose to play; Lewisohn highlights his interpretation among the &quot;dozens of high-profile covers&quot;. Presley performed it on his 1973 &quot;Aloha from Hawaii&quot; TV special, the recording from which appeared on the accompanying bestselling album. A version from Presley&#x27;s August 1970 Las Vegas concert season subsequently appeared on the box sets &quot;Walk a Mile in My Shoes: The Essential &#x27;70s Masters&quot; (1995) and &quot;Live in Las Vegas&quot; (2001). In 1974, a recording by Johnny Rodriguez reached number 6 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Country Singles chart and number 85 on the Hot 100. In Canada, Rodriguez&#x27;s single peaked at number 11 on the &quot;RPM&quot; country chart.

By 1972, over 150 artists had recorded &quot;Something&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hennessey/RM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1996 Harrison biography &quot;The Quiet One&quot;, Alan Clayson said the song had attracted &quot;nearly 200 cover versions&quot;. In 1972, Harrison told music journalist Mike Hennessey that the Robinson and Cocker versions were among his favourites. In later interviews, he said that the best cover version was a recording by James Brown, in which the singer declares &quot;I got to believe in something!&quot; over the main riff. Harrison commented that the recording was relatively obscure in Brown&#x27;s catalogue: &quot;It was one of his B-sides. I have it on my jukebox at home. It&#x27;s absolutely brilliant.&quot;

===Harrison tributes===
Bruce Springsteen opened his first show after Harrison&#x27;s death on 29 November 2001 by playing &quot;Something&quot;, followed by a rendition of Harrison&#x27;s solo hit &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;. Elton John gave a solo performance of the song at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall in April 2002, as part of a one-hour Harrison tribute during the eleventh annual Rainforest Foundation concert.

In honour of Harrison&#x27;s fondness for the instrument, Paul McCartney played a ukulele rendition of &quot;Something&quot; throughout his 2002–03 world tour and included the track on his &quot;Back in the U.S.&quot; live album. At the Concert for George, held at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall on 29 November 2002, he and Eric Clapton performed a version that began with McCartney alone on ukulele, then reverted to the familiar rock arrangement with Clapton taking over as lead singer and backing from Starr, Preston and others. Following its appearance in David Leland&#x27;s film &quot;Concert for George&quot; (2003) and on the accompanying live album, this performance of &quot;Something&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.

Bob Dylan also played the song live during his November 2002 concerts, as a tribute to Harrison. McCartney continued to perform &quot;Something&quot;, adopting the Concert for George mix of ukulele and rock backing. A version with this musical arrangement was included on his 2009 album &quot;Good Evening New York City&quot;.

==Live performances by Harrison==
Harrison played &quot;Something&quot; at the two Concert for Bangladesh shows, held at Madison Square Garden in New York on 1 August 1971. His first live performance as a solo artist, he was backed by a large band that included Starr, Preston, Clapton and Leon Russell. The version used on the live album and in the 1972 concert film was taken from the evening show that day, when Harrison played it as the final song before returning to perform &quot;Bangla Desh&quot; as an encore.

Harrison included &quot;Something&quot; in all of his subsequent, and rare, full-length concert appearances. For his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar, he had been reluctant to feature any material from the Beatles&#x27; catalogue, but at the urging of Shankar and Preston during rehearsals, he added &quot;Something&quot; to the setlist. To the disappointment of many fans, he chose to alter some of the song&#x27;s lyrics (such as changing the first line to &quot;If there&#x27;s something in the way, remove it&quot;). Further distancing himself from the Beatles&#x27; legacy, Harrison told journalists at the start of the tour that he would join a group with Lennon &quot;any day&quot; but rejected the idea of working again with McCartney, since he preferred Willie Weeks as a bassist. MacDonald comments that this statement was likely in reference to McCartney&#x27;s &quot;too fussily extemporised&quot; bass part on the Beatles&#x27; 1969 recording. With Boyd having left Harrison for Clapton earlier in 1974, Larry Sloman of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the reworked &quot;Something&quot; as &quot;a moving diary of his love life&quot;.

A version from Harrison&#x27;s December 1991 tour of Japan with Clapton – Harrison&#x27;s only other tour as a solo artist – appears on the &quot;Live in Japan&quot; double album (1992). Inglis writes of the track having &quot;extra poignancy&quot; by this time, &quot;in that the woman for whom it was written had been married to, and divorced from, Harrison and Clapton in turn&quot;. Inglis adds: &quot;It is not a new interpretation of the song, but it does suggest a new perspective, in which words and music are used by two close friends to reflect on the lives they have led.&quot;

<text>Conrad I of Brno (; died 6 September 1092) was the duke of Bohemia for eight months in 1092.

== Life ==
He was the brother and successor of Vratislaus II (died 14 January 1092) as the third son of Bretislaus I and Judith of Schweinfurt. He did not succeed as king, because his brother had only been elevated to the royal dignity for life by the Emperor Henry IV without the establishment of a hereditary monarchy.

Before he became duke of Bohemia, he had long ruled over southern parts of Moravia, as junior sons typically did in this period of Bohemia, as duke of Brno and Znojmo from 1054.

==Marriage ==
By his marriage to Wirpirk of Tengling, he had two children:

*Ulrich, prince of Brno from 1092 to 1097 and from 1100 to his death on 11 November 1113
*Luitpold, prince of Znojmo from 1092 to 1097 and from 1100 to his death on 15 March 1112

He was succeeded as duke by his nephew Bretislaus.

<text>The Alpine ibex (Capra ibex), also known as the steinbock, is a European species of goat that lives in the Alps. It is one of ten species in the genus &quot;Capra&quot; and its closest living relative is the Iberian ibex. The Alpine ibex is a sexually dimorphic species; males are larger and carry longer horns than females. Its coat is brownish-grey. Alpine ibexes tend to live in steep, rough terrain and open alpine meadows. They can be found at elevations as high as and their sharp hooves allow them to scale the steep slopes and cliffs of their mountainous habitat.

Alpine ibexes primarily feed on grass and are active throughout the year. Although they are social animals, adult males and females segregate for most of the year, coming together only to mate. During the breeding season, males use their long horns to fight for access to females. Ibexes have few predators but may succumb to parasites and diseases.

By the 19th century, the Alpine ibex had been extirpated from most of its range and it went through a population bottleneck of fewer than 100 individuals during its near-extinction event, leading to very low genetic diversity across populations. The species has been successfully reintroduced to parts of its historical range. All individuals living today descend from the stock in Gran Paradiso National Park, Italy. , the IUCN lists the species as being of least concern.

==Taxonomy==
Carl Linnaeus first described the Alpine ibex in 1758. It is classified in the genus &quot;Capra&quot; with nine other species of goat. is Latin for while the species name is translated from Latin as and is possibly derived from an earlier Alpine language.

Fossils of the genus &quot;Tossunnoria&quot; are found in late Miocene deposits in China; these fossils appear to have been transitional between goats and their ancestors. The genus &quot;Capra&quot; may have originated in Central Asia and spread to Europe, the Caucasus, and East Africa from the Pliocene and into the Pleistocene. Mitochondrial and Y chromosome evidence show hybridisation of species in this lineage. Fossils of the Alpine ibex dating from the last glacial period during the late Pleistocene have been found in France and Italy. The Alpine Ibex and the Iberian ibex (&quot;C. pyrenaica&quot;) probably evolved from the extinct Pleistocene species &quot;Capra camburgensis&quot;, whose fossils have been found in Germany. The Alpine ibex appears to have been larger during the Pleistocene than in the modern day.

In the 20th century, the Nubian (&quot;C. nubiana&quot;), walia (&quot;C. walie&quot;), and Siberian ibex (&quot;C. sibirica&quot;) were considered to be subspecies of the Alpine ibex; populations in the Alps were given the trinomial of &quot;C. i. ibex&quot;. Genetic evidence from 2006 has supported the status of these Ibexes as separate species.

The following cladogram of seven &quot;Capra&quot; species is based on 2022 mitochondrial evidence and makes the domestic goat a closer relative than both the Nubian and the Siberian Ibex:

==Appearance==
Alpine ibexes are sexually dimorphic. Males grow to a height of at the withers with a body length of and weigh . Females are much smaller and have a shoulder height of , a body length of , and weigh .

The Alpine ibex is a stocky animal with a tough neck and robust legs with short metapodials. Compared with most other wild goats, the species has a wide, shortened snout. Adaptations for climbing include sharp, highly separated hooves and a rubbery callus under the front feet. Both male and female Alpine ibexes have large, backwards-curving horns with an elliptical cross-section and a trilateral-shaped core. Transverse ridges on the front surface of the horns mark an otherwise flat surface. At , the horns of males are substantially longer than those of females, which reach only in length.

The species has brownish-grey hair over most of its body but lighter in colour on the belly with dark markings on the chin and throat. The hair on the chest region is nearly black and there are stripes along the dorsal (back) surface. The Alpine ibex is duller-coloured than other members of its genus. As with other goats, only males have a beard. Ibexes moult in spring, when their thick winter coat consisting of woolly underfur is replaced with a short, thin summer coat. Their winter coat grows back in the autumn. As in other members of &quot;Capra&quot;, the Alpine ibex has glands near the eyes, groin, and feet but none on the face.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Alpine ibex is native to the Alps of central Europe; its range includes France, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy, Germany, and Austria. Fossils of the species have been found as far south as Greece, where it became locally extinct about 7,500 years ago due to human predation. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, the species disappeared from much of its range due to hunting, leaving by the 19th century one surviving population in and around Gran Paradiso, Italy. The species has since been reintroduced into parts of its former range, as well as new areas such as Slovenia and Bulgaria.

The Alpine Ibex is an excellent climber; it occupies steep, rough terrain at elevations of . It prefers to live in open areas, but when there is little snow and depending on population density, adult males may gather in larch and mixed larch-spruce woodland. Outside the breeding season, the sexes live in separate habitats. Females are more likely to be found on steep slopes while males prefer more level ground. Males inhabit lowland meadows during the spring, when fresh grass appears, and climb to alpine meadows during the summer. In early winter, both males and females move to steep, rocky slopes to avoid dense buildups of snow. Alpine ibexes prefer slopes of 30–45°, and take refuge in small caves and overhangs.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The Alpine ibex is strictly herbivorous; its diet consists mostly of grass, which is preferred all year; during the summer, ibexes supplement their diet with herbs, while during autumn and winter they also eat dwarf shrubs and conifer shoots. The most-commonly eaten grass genera are &quot;Agrostis&quot;, &quot;Avena&quot;, &quot;Calamagrostis&quot;, &quot;Festuca&quot;, &quot;Phleum&quot;, &quot;Poa&quot;, &quot;Sesleria&quot;, and &quot;Trisetum&quot;. In the spring, animals of both sexes spend about the same amount of time feeding during the day, while in summer, females, particularly those that are lactating, eat more than males. High temperatures cause heat stress in large adult males, reducing their feeding time, but they may avoid this problem by feeding at night.

In Gran Paradiso, home ranges of the Alpine Ibex can exceed and in reintroduced populations, home ranges may approach . Home-range size depends on the availability of resources and the time of year. Home ranges tend to be largest during summer and autumn, smallest in winter, and intermediate in spring. Females&#x27; home ranges are usually smaller than those of males. Ibexes do not hibernate during the winter; they take shelter on cold winter nights and bask in the mornings. They also reduce their heart rate and metabolism. 

The Alpine ibex may compete for resources with chamois and red deer; the presence of these species may force the ibex to occupy higher elevations. The Alpine ibex&#x27;s climbing ability is such that it has been observed scaling the 57-degree slopes of the Cingino Dam in Piedmont, Italy, where it licks salts. Only females and kids, which are lighter and have shorter legs than adult males, will climb the steep dam. Kids have been observed at , ascending in a zig-zag path while descending in straight paths.

===Social behaviour===
The Alpine ibex is a social species but it tends to live in groups that are based on sex and age. For most of the year, adult males group separately from females, and older males live separately from young males. Female groups consist of 5–10 members and male groups usually have 2–16 members but sometimes have more than 50. Dependent kids live with their mothers in female groups. Segregation between the sexes is a gradual process; males younger than nine years may still associate with female groups. Adult males, particularly older males, are more likely to be found alone than females. Social spacing tends to be looser in the summer, when there is more room to feed. Ibexes have stable social connections; they consistently regroup with the same individuals when ecological conditions force them together. Female groups tend to be more stable than male groups.

Adult males and females gather together in December and January, the breeding season, then separate again in April and May. Among males, a dominance hierarchy based on size, age, and horn length exists. Hierarchies are established outside the breeding season, allowing males to focus more on mating and less on fighting. Males use their horns for combat; they bash rivals&#x27; sides or clash head-to-head often by rearing then clashing downwards.

Alpine ibexes communicate mainly through short, sharp whistles that serve mostly as alarm calls and may occur singularly or in succession with short gaps. Females and their young communicate by bleating.

===Reproduction and growth===
The mating season begins in December and typically lasts for around six weeks. During this time, male herds break up into smaller groups and search for females. The rut takes place in two phases; in the first phase, males interact with females as a group and in the second phase, one male separates from his group to follow a female in oestrus. Dominant males between nine and twelve years old follow a female and guard her from rivals while subordinate, younger males between two and six years old try to sneak past the tending male when he is distracted. If the female flees, both dominant and subordinate males will try to follow her. During courtship, the male stretches the neck, flicks the tongue, curls the upper lip, urinates, and sniffs the female. After copulation, the male rejoins his group and restarts the first phase of the rut. Environmental conditions can affect courtship in the species; for example, snow can limit the males&#x27; ability to follow females and mate with them.

The female is in oestrus for around 20 days and gestation averages around five months, and typically results in the birth of one or sometimes two kids. Females give birth away from their social groups on rocky slopes that are relatively safe from predators. After a few days, the kids can move on their own. Mothers and kids gather into nursery groups, where young are nursed for up to five months. Nursery groups can also include non-lactating females. Alpine ibexes reach sexual maturity in 18 months but continue to grow until females are five to six and males are nine to eleven years old.

The horns grow throughout life. Young are born without horns, which become visible as tiny tips at one month and reach in the second month. In males, the horns grow at about per year for the first five-and-a-half years, slowing to half that rate once the animal reaches 10 years of age. The slowing of horn growth in males coincides with aging. The age of an ibex can be determined by annual growth rings in the horns, which stop growing in winter.

===Mortality and health===
Male Alpine Ibexes live for around 16 years while females live for around 20 years. The species has a high adult survival rate compared with other herbivores around its size. In one study, all kids reached two years of age and the majority of adults lived for 13 years, although most 13-year-old males did not reach the age of 15. Alpine ibexes have a low rate of predation; their mountain habitat keeps them safe from predators like wolves, though golden eagles may prey on young. In Gran Paradiso, causes of death are old age, lack of food, and disease. They are also killed by avalanches.

Alpine ibexes may suffer necrosis and fibrosis caused by the bacteria &quot;Brucella melitensis&quot;, and foot rot caused by &quot;Dichelobacter nodosus&quot;. Infections from &quot;Mycoplasma conjunctivae&quot; damage the eye via keratoconjunctivitis and can lead to death rates of up to 30%. Ibexes can host gastrointestinal parasites such as coccidia, strongyles, &quot;Teladorsagia circumcincta&quot;, and &quot;Marshallagi amarshalli&quot; as well as lungworms, mainly &quot;Muellerius capillaris&quot;. Several individuals have died from heart diseases, including arteriosclerosis, cardiac fibrosis, sarcosporidiosis, and valvular heart disease.

==Conservation==
During the Middle Ages, the Alpine ibex ranged throughout the Alpine region of Europe. Starting in the early 16th century, the overall population declined due almost entirely to hunting by humans, especially with the introduction of firearms. By the 19th century, only around 100 individuals remained in and around Gran Paradiso in north-west Italy and on the Italian-French border. In 1821, the Government of Piedmont banned hunting of the Alpine ibex and in 1854, Victor Emmanuel II declared Gran Paradiso a royal hunting reserve. In 1920, his grandson Victor Emmanuel III of Italy donated the land to the state of Italy and it was established as a national park. By 1933, the Alpine ibex population reached 4,000 but subsequent mismanagement by the Fascist government caused it to drop to around 400 by 1945. Their protection improved again after the war and by 2005, there were 4,000 in the national park. In the late 20th century, the Gran Paradiso population was used for reintroductions into other parts of Italy.

Starting in 1902, several Alpine ibexes from Gran Paradiso were taken into captive facilities in Switzerland for selective breeding and reintroduction into the wild. Until 1948, translocated founder animals were captive-bred. Afterwards, there were reintroductions of wild-born specimens from established populations in Piz Albris, Le Pleureur, and Augstmatthorn. These gave rise to the populations in France and Austria. Alpine ibexes also recolonised areas on their own. The Alpine ibex population reached 3,020 in 1914, 20,000 in 1991, and 55,297 in 2015, and by 1975, the species occupied much of its medieval range. In the 1890s, ibexes were introduced to Slovenia despite the lack of evidence of their presence there following the last glacial period. In 1980, ibexes were translocated to Bulgaria.

Between 2015 and 2017, there were around 9,000 ibexes in 30 colonies in France, over 17,800 individuals and 30 colonies in Switzerland, over 16,400 ibexes in 67 colonies in Italy, around 9,000 in 27 colonies in Austria, around 500 in five colonies in Germany, and almost 280 ibexes and four colonies in Slovenia. As of 2020, the IUCN considers the Alpine ibex to be of Least Concern with a stable population trend. It was given a recovery score of 79%, making it &quot;moderately depleted&quot;. While the species would likely have gone extinct without conservation efforts in the 19th and 20th centuries, as of 2021, it has a low conservation dependence. According to the IUCN, without current protections, the population decline of the species would be minimal. Some countries allow limited hunting.

Having gone through a genetic bottleneck, the Alpine ibex population has low genetic diversity and is at risk of inbreeding depression. A 2020 analysis found highly deleterious mutations were lost in these new populations but they had also gained mildly deleterious ones. The genetic purity of the species may be threatened by hybridisation with domestic goats, which have been allowed to roam in the Alpine Ibex&#x27;s habitat. The genetic bottleneck of populations may increase vulnerability to infectious diseases because their immune system has low major histocompatibility complex diversity. In the Bornes Massif region of the French Alps, management actions, including a test-and-cull program to control outbreaks, effectively reduced &quot;Brucella&quot; infection prevalence in adult females from 51% in 2013 to 21% in 2018, and active infections also significantly declined.

==Cultural significance==
The Alpine ibex is called the &quot;steinbock&quot;, which originated from the Old High German word &quot;steinboc&quot;, literally &quot;stone buck&quot;. Several European names for the animal developed from this, including the French &quot;bouquetin&quot; and the Italian &quot;stambecco&quot;. The Alpine ibex is one of many animals depicted in the art of the Late Pleistocene-era Magdalenian culture in Western Europe. Local people used Ibexes for traditional medicine; the horn material was used to counter cramps, poisoning, and hysteria, while the blood was thought to prevent stones from developing in the bladder. The species&#x27; value as a source of medicine led to its near extinction. Since its recovery, the Alpine ibex has been seen as a resilient symbol of the mountain range. The species is depicted on the coat of arms of the Swiss canton of Grisons.

<text>The National Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) is a fraternal organization consisting of sworn law enforcement officers in the United States. It reports a membership of over 355,000 members organized in 2,100 local chapters (lodges), state lodges, and the national Grand Lodge. The organization attempts to improve the working conditions of law enforcement officers and the safety of those they serve through education, legislation, information, community involvement, and employee representation.

FOP subordinate lodges may be police unions and/or fraternal organizations, as the FOP has both Labor Lodges and Fraternal Lodges, and describes itself as a &quot;full service member representation organization.&quot; It lobbies Congress and regulatory agencies on behalf of law enforcement officers, provides labor representation, promotes legal defense for officers, and offers resources such as &quot;legal research.&quot;

==History==

The Fraternal Order of Police was founded in 1915 by two Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, patrol officers, Martin Toole and Delbert Nagle. They and 21 other members of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police met on May 14, 1915, establishing the first local of the Fraternal Order of Police, Fort Pitt Lodge #1. The FOP official history states that the founders decided to not use the term &quot;union&quot; because of &quot;the anti-union sentiment of the time,&quot; but nevertheless acted as a union, telling Pittsburgh mayor Joseph G. Armstrong that the FOP would &quot;bring our grievances before the Mayor or Council and have many things adjusted that we are unable to present in any other way...we could get many things through our legislature that our Council will not, or cannot give us.&quot;

In 1918, it was decided that the Order should become a national organization. The Order&#x27;s constitution stated that &quot;Race, Creed or Color shall be no bar&quot;. The constitution also had a no strike pledge, but this has not been enforced since 1967 when FOP police in Youngstown, Ohio refused to work during a salary dispute. In 1974 and 1975 the FOP stated that it would take no action against members who violated the anti-strike clause until all efforts were exhausted on the local and state level.

During the 1960s the FOP opposed the creation of police review boards, spearheaded by Robert F. Kennedy, at one point describing them as a &quot;sinister movement against law enforcement&quot;. The FOP also clashed with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on the issue of police brutality, seeing it as a &quot;liberal attempt to discredit law enforcement&quot;. The Order was &quot;heartened by Richard Nixon&#x27;s emphasis on law and order&quot;, though it claimed to remain strictly apolitical.

==Emblem and motto==
The Fraternal Order of Police emblem is a five-pointed star. According to the FOP:

When adopted, the motto was believed to be Latin and assumed to mean &quot;Fairness, Justice, Equality&quot; or &quot;Justice, Friendship, Equality&quot;. Actually, the motto is a grammatically impossible and hardly translatable sequence of Latin words; the current interpretation is the best that could be made of it.

In the center of the star is the coat of arms of Pittsburgh, itself based on William Pitt&#x27;s own coat of arms.

== Organization and membership==
The FOP constitution and bylaws provide that active membership is open to &quot;any regularly appointed or elected and full-time employed law enforcement officer of the United States, any state or political subdivision thereof, or any agency may be eligible for membership&quot; and that &quot;each state and subordinate lodge shall be the judge of its membership.&quot; Local lodges often have provisions for retired law enforcement officers. The subordinate lodges are supported by state lodges which are subordinate to the Grand Lodge. The Grand Lodge is the national structure of the order.

In 1978, the Order had 138,472 members, 1,250 lodges and 34 state structures.

In the late 1970s, the Order&#x27;s headquarters were located in Indianapolis, Indiana.
The national organization has three offices: the Labor Services Division in Columbus, Ohio, the Steve Young Law Enforcement Legislative Advocacy Center in Washington, D.C., and the Grand Lodge &quot;Atnip-Orms Center&quot; National Headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee.

===Fraternal Order of Police Auxiliary===
The Fraternal Order of Police Auxiliary (FOPA) is the auxiliary organization of FOP for family members of FOP members. It was formed by a group of wives of Pittsburgh police officers in 1920, and Kathryn M. Milton became its first national president, in 1941 as the Fraternal Order of Police Ladies Auxiliary. It reports over 2,000 members in 140 Auxiliaries in 25 states. In 1985, males older than 18 were admitted for the first time; in 1987, the current name was adopted, dropping the term &quot;Ladies.&quot;

===Fraternal Order of Police Associates===
The Fraternal Order of Police Associates (FOPA) is a civilian affiliate organization that is made up of FOP supporters not eligible for membership. Its members include friends and family of members, businesspeople, professionals, and other citizens. It is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization.

==Political advocacy==
Passed legislation supported by FOP includes the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, Law Enforcement Officers Equity Act, and HELPS Retirees Act. Pending legislation that FOP lobbies for includes the Social Security Fairness Act, the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act of 2007, and the State and Local Law Enforcement Officers&#x27; Discipline, Accountability and Due Process Act.

The FOP distributes questionnaires for candidates for U.S. president and Congress asking them about their views on issues relating to police officers.

FOP has the following issue positions:
*Supports the Social Security Fairness Act, which would repeal the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) in current law.
*Supports the recommendations of the President&#x27;s Commission To Strengthen Social Security to privatize Social Security, and opposes &quot;mandating participation in the Social Security system for either current or newly hired state and local government employees that do not currently participate in Social Security.
*Supports &quot;minimal collective bargaining rights for public safety employees,&quot; including law enforcement officers and firefighters, and supports the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act of 2007.
*Supports due process rights of law enforcement officers in non-criminal administrative proceedings and supports the State and Local Law Enforcement Discipline, Accountability and Due Process Act.
*Supports the Law Enforcement Officers Equity Act, which would expand the definition of &quot;law enforcement officer&quot; under the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees Retirement System to include all U.S. federal police officers, as well as Customs and Immigration Inspectors.
*Supports the REAL ID Act.
*In response to the 2014 killings of NYPD officers, then President Chuck Canterbury asked Congress to consider making crimes against police officers fall under the category of hate crimes.

In 2008, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 53, Eddison Ricketts, wrote Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel that the union supported him.

On September 16, 2016, the FOP endorsed Republican Party candidate Donald Trump for U.S. president. This endorsement was opposed by Blacks in Law Enforcement of America for not reflecting the will of the membership. It endorsed Trump again on September 4, 2020.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FOP vehemently opposed vaccine requirements for police. COVID-19 was the top killer of police officers in 2020 and 2021.

On September 6, 2024, The FOP officially endorsed Donald Trump&#x27;s 2024 presidential campaign. This marks the third time the police union has backed Trump. One of President Trump&#x27;s first decisions when he returned to office was to grant blanket clemency to more than 1,500 people convicted for their role in the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The FOP criticized the move, saying it &quot;sends a dangerous message.&quot;

===Boycotts===
The National Fraternal Order of Police has called for boycotts of various individuals and organizations throughout its history. In August 1999, the Fraternal Order of Police called for a boycott against all individuals and organizations that support Mumia Abu-Jamal, a journalist who was convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer in 1981. FOP also called for a boycott of the Beastie Boys and Rage Against the Machine for their support of Abu-Jamal. In August 2007, FOP called for a boycott of eBay for selling police equipment. In 2015, the Fraternal Order of Police called for a boycott of Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s films following his comments against police brutality at a protest in New York. The boycott of Tarantino was joined by the Border Patrol, as well as police unions in California, Philadelphia, New York, and New Jersey. After athletic company Nike aired an ad featuring former NFL player Colin Kaepernick in 2018, FOP condemned it and called it an insult. Fraternal Order of Police president Chuck Canterbury said Kaepernick&#x27;s views were &quot;uninformed and inflammatory&quot; but declined to call for a boycott, saying that &quot;in our experience, boycotts and similar exercises do not succeed and often serve only to enrich the company.&quot; Aside from the national organization, many local police unions have separately called for boycotts.

== Data breach ==
In January 2016, the site was hacked and files released to a dark web activist known as Cthulhu.

==Controversies==
In 1991, the FOP was under scrutiny from the public in part because of the Rodney King incident. Dewey Stokes, the FOP president at the time, contextualized the incident by saying, &quot;You have to put things in proper perspective. [...] These are not common occurrences. They are the result of stress on the job, emphasis of the system on the criminal and not the victim, and the media&#x27;s exploitation of the negatives of law enforcement.&quot;

The human rights group Amnesty International has criticized the Fraternal Order of Police in Philadelphia for their vocal support of the death penalty in the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal.

Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has called the FOP a &quot;fringe organization&quot; for opposing his efforts to repeal the Tiahrt Amendment.

On September 18, 2009, &quot;The Providence Journal&quot; reported the Fraternal Order of Police representing several Rhode Island police departments had solicited donations from city massage parlors or &quot;spas&quot;. Watchdog groups have claimed that these massage parlors are fronts for prostitution.

On August 27, 2017, as the FOP was holding its annual conference at the Gaylord Opryland Resort &amp; Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee, protesters compared the FOP to the Ku Klux Klan by putting up banners on interstate overpasses, one of which read, &quot;Grand Wizards to Grand Lodges. White Supremacy By Another Name&quot;.

In June 2018, Fraternal Order of Police Tri-County Lodge #3 in South Carolina objected to the inclusion of award-winning novel &quot;The Hate U Give&quot; by Angie Thomas, and &quot;All American Boys&quot; by Jason Reynolds and Brendan Kiely in a high school summer reading list, because of their depictions of violence by police officers. The National Coalition Against Censorship offered the high school support, while prominent authors such as Hari Kunzru and Neil Gaiman pointed out the alarming nature of police officers trying to police what children read.

After the May 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis Police custody, the FOP said, in part: &quot;...police officers should at all times render aid to those who need it... need to treat all of our citizens with respect and understanding and should be held to the very highest standards for their conduct...&quot; In June 2020, the Fraternal Order of Police&#x27;s Brevard County, Florida chapter offered on Facebook to recruit police officers from forces involved in police brutality controversies from Buffalo, Atlanta, and Minneapolis. The Brevard County sheriff denounced the remarks.

In October 2020, the FOP posted a photo to Twitter and Facebook of a policewoman holding a toddler, claiming he had been found wandering the streets of Philadelphia amid the protests over the killing of Walter Wallace. The toddler had in fact been pulled from the back of a vehicle unrelated to the protests after the police had surrounded it and violently arrested his mother and another passenger without probable cause. The posts were later deleted.

On April 15, 2021, the same day Chicago Police Department body camera footage of the Adam Toledo shooting was released, John Catanzara, president of Lodge 7 Chicago of the Fraternal Order of Police, said the officer was justified in his actions. &quot;He was 100% right,&quot; Catanzara said. &quot;The offender still turned with a gun in his hand.&quot; This claim is heavily disputed as the video appears to show Toledo turning toward the officer and raising both hands with nothing in them when he was shot and killed.

On August 13, 2023, HBO released &quot;Telemarketers&quot;, a 3-part limited documentary series exploring the controversial telemarketing and fundraising practices of various state and local lodges of The Fraternal Order of Police nationwide. The series and investigation stars former heroin addict and legendary telemarketer Patrick J Pespas, and graffiti artist turned filmmaker Sam Lipman-Stern.

On September 6, 2024, FOP officially endorsed Donald Trump for the 2024 US Presidential Election. This endorsement was criticized as some people felt Trump was responsible for the January 6 United States Capitol attack and was also found guilty of falsifying business records. More than 60 other police officials endorsed Harris. On January 21, 2025, FOP made an official statement denouncing Trump for the Pardon of January 6 United States Capitol attack defendants.

<doc id="890152" wikidata="Q454827" url="?curid=890152" title="Vladislaus I, Duke of Bohemia">
<text>Vladislaus I (; – 12 April 1125) was Duke of Bohemia from 1109 to 1117 and from 1120 until his death.

==Life==
Vladislav I was a son of Vratislaus II of Bohemia by his second wife Svatava, a daughter of Casimir I of Poland. Together with his cousin Svatopluk, Vladislav expelled his brother Bořivoj II from Bohemia in 1107. In 1109, Svatopluk was killed during a campaign in Poland, and Vladislav I succeeded him as Duke of Bohemia. Bořivoj II returned from exile with the support of Prince Bolesław III Wrymouth of Poland, but was defeated and imprisoned by Vladislav in 1110. 

In spite of his victory, Vladislav I remained under Polish pressure and was forced to recognize a younger brother, Soběslav, as subordinate ruler of Moravia in Znojmo. In 1117, Vladislav I formally abdicated in favor of Bořivoj II, but retained much of the actual power. In 1120, Bořivoj was deposed again and endowed with Znojmo, while Vladislav resumed the throne, which he held until his death in 1125. 

Vladislav I ruled in a difficult time with considerable success. Although he continued to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Empire, he weathered the interventions of Poland into Bohemian affairs, conflicts with his kinsmen in Moravia, and undertook offensive campaigns against both Poland and Austria. In 1110–11, Vladislav accompanied Emperor Henry V on his Italian expedition, and he encouraged continued German settlement into Bohemia&#x27;s border regions. 

==Kladruby Monastery==
In 1115, the Benedictine monastery of Kladruby was established, with Vladislav endowing the abbey with 25 manors and the lordship of Zbraslav. Although by 1117, he had enlarged the abbey with six monks and six lay brethren. 

==Family== 
By his wife Richeza of Berg (died 27 September 1125), daughter of Count Henry I of Berg. They had: 
* Svatava
* Vladislav II of Bohemia (c. 1110 – 18 January 1174), King of Bohemia
* Děpold I of Jamnitz (died August 1167) 
* Jindřich (Henry) (d. after 1169), married to Margaret. His son Bretislav became bishop of Prague and later duke of Bohemia as Bretislav III.

<text>Yehuda Meir Shapiro (; 3 March 1887 – 27 October 1933) was a prominent Polish Hasidic rabbi and rosh yeshiva, also known as the Lubliner Rav. He is noted for his promotion of the Daf Yomi study program in 1923, and establishing the Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva in 1930.

During the years 1922 to 1927 Shapiro was the first Orthodox Jew to become a member in the Sejm (Parliament) of the Second Polish Republic representing the Jewish minority of the country.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Rabbi Yehuda Meir Shapiro was born on the 7th day of Adar (in Jewish tradition, also the birth date of Moses) in the city of Shatz, Bucovina, then in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, now in Romania, in 1887. He was a descendant of Rabbi Pinchas Shapiro of Korets, one of the students of the Baal Shem Tov, and from his maternal side, of Rabbi Joseph ben Isaac Bekhor Shor, a French tosafist. After cheder, Shapiro began to study with his grandfather, the Baal Minchas Shai (Rabbi . Another of his early teachers was Rabbi Shulem Moshkovitz (popularly known as the Shotzer Rebbe. He was also a well known kabbalist).

In 1906 he &quot;married the daughter of Reb Ya&#x27;akov Breitman, a wealthy landowner of Tarnopol, Galicia.&quot; Shapiro began to get a reputation, and became known as the Illui of Shatz. From an early age, he was known as an outstanding leader and gifted speaker. He was soon ordained by many great scholars, including the Maharsham. His grandfather introduced him to the Chortkover Rebbe, and thus began his passion for Hasidism, and the beginning of his relationship with the Chortkover Rebbe.

===Galina===
His first rabbinical posting came in 1911 when he was appointed Rav of Galina. He spent ten years in the city, during which time he established a yeshiva called Bnei Torah. Construction commenced in 1920. The yeshiva held a Talmud Torah, a place to train rabbis, and a kitchen to feed orphaned children. It ran at a budget of over half a million marks. This yeshiva served as a prototype for what was later to become Chachmei Lublin.

===Sanok===
After leaving Galina, Shapiro began serving as Rav of Sanok in 1920.

===Petrakov===
In 1924, Shapiro accepted his third rabbinical position in Petrakov/Piotrkow.

===Lublin===
On 14 June 1931, he was appointed rabbi of Lublin in the old synagogue of the Maharshal.

Shapiro introduced the revolutionary idea of Daf Yomi (, &quot;page [of the] day&quot; or &quot;daily &quot;), a daily regimen undertaken to study the Babylonian Talmud one folio (a daf consists of both sides of the page) each day. Under this regimen, the entire Talmud is completed, one day at a time, in a cycle of seven and a half years. Rabbi Shapiro introduced his idea at the First World Congress of the World Agudath Israel in Vienna on 16 August 1923. The first cycle of Daf Yomi commenced on the first day of Rosh Hashanah 5684 (11 September 1923). Now in its 14th cycle, Daf Yomi has been taken up by tens of thousands of Jews worldwide.

==Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin==
Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin was, along with Daf Yomi, Shapiro&#x27;s greatest achievement. He conceived of a yeshiva for Hasidic Poland, modeled on Lithuanian yeshivas such as Volozhin, Slabodka and Novardok, but which would train Hasidic rabbis as the next generation to lead Polish Jewry. The Yeshiva was housed in a massive building, housed hundreds of students, and had a vast library of over 100,000 books.

On 22–28 May 1924, the cornerstone laying ceremony took place for the construction of the yeshiva building. Approximately 20,000 people participated in the event. The opening ceremony took place on 24–25 June 1930. Apart from thousands of local Jews, around 10,000 people arrived from all over Poland and abroad.
Shapiro served as rosh yeshiva until his death.

==Łódź==
In 1932 Shapiro was approached by leaders of the Jewish Community of Łódź, who wanted to offer him the position of Chief Rabbi of Łódź. Many people wanted to appoint Rabbi Mendel Alter of Kalish, (b. 1877, Ger) the brother to the Gerrer Rebbe (and youngest son of the Sfas Emes) to this position. Rabbi Shapiro negotiated that a large part of his wage would go to pay off the debts that Chachmei Lublin was still struggling to pay off. Eventually it was decided to give it to Rabbi Shapiro. After all the protracted negotiation that went on to get Rabbi Shapiro into this position, he died three days after being appointed Chief Rabbi.

==Political activities==
===Agudat Yisrael===
Whilst serving in Galina, Rabbi Shapiro began his involvement with Agudat Israel. He was present at its founding conference in 1912. In 1914 he was appointed head of the Education Department of Agudas Yisrael in East Galicia, becoming president in 1922 of Agudas Yisrael in Poland. He played a role in the conference in the city of Lvov, which had the purpose of launching the Aguda in Galicia, some two years after its founding in Katovitz in 5672 (c. 1911).

At the time, he was also added as a member to the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. Rabbi Shapiro was initially very doubtful as to whether he should become an MP for the party, but was encouraged to do so by his rebbe, the Chortkover.

Rabbi Shapiro, together with Aron Levine and Zalman Sorotzkin, chaired the committee which as a part of the Polish Ministry for Religious Affairs, held responsibility for delegating Rabbinical positions throughout Poland. He was also part of the Vaad HaChinuch.

Beginning in 1922, Rabbi Shapiro served as a parliamentarian to the Polish Sejm. In 1928 he stepped down as a politician so that he could devote all his energies to Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva.

==Death==
Shapiro became ill with typhus in 1933 and died within the month, on 27 October 1933 (7 Cheshvan 5694) at the age of 46. His death was mourned in both Jewish and non-Jewish Poland. Countless newspapers across the entire political spectrum, from Orthodox to Yiddishist to socialist, featured front-page biographies of Rabbi Shapiro.

Shapiro&#x27;s remains were reinterred in Israel in 1958, under the auspices of his brother. He was reburied in Har HaMenuchot with a full ceremony. Rabbi Yitzchok Meir Levin delivered a eulogy, as did those students of his who had survived the Holocaust.

==Legacy==
Shapiro is widely revered throughout the Jewish world as the founder of Daf Yomi. The neighborhood of Zikhron Meir in Bnei Brak was established in his memory by Yaakov Halperin; this is the neighborhood that hosts many of the major yeshivas in Bnei Brak.&lt;br&gt;

Shlomo Artzi, a famous Israeli musical artist, is Shapiro&#x27;s grand-nephew.
Famous students of Rav Shapiro who continued his legacy, include Rabbi Pinchas Hirschprung and Rabbi Shmuel &quot;haLevi&quot; Wosner.

==Works==
Shapiro was considered a gaon (Torah genius) in his lifetime. He studied Torah extensively and was a great scholar even by the high standards of the era he lived in. His two major works are &quot;Ohr HaMeir&quot; and &quot;Imrei Da&#x27;as&quot;.

*Ohr HaMeir - It was in Petrakov that he printed his book of responsa entitled &quot;Ohr HaMeir&quot; in 1926. As a work it operates on many different subjects, from philosophy to halacha.
*Imrei Daas - a compilation of Torah thoughts on Halacha and Aggada, which was lost during World War II. The book contained an approbation from Rabbi Meir Arik of Meturnah.
*Vortelach - Shapiro was a quick and brilliant thinker, and his numerous &quot;vortelach&quot; (short responsa) have been collected in numerous volumes, and quoted in many books.

<doc id="890193" wikidata="Q1708746" url="?curid=890193" title="4.48 Psychosis">
<text>4.48 Psychosis is the final play by British playwright Sarah Kane. It was her last work, first staged at the Royal Court&#x27;s Jerwood Theatre Upstairs on 23 June 2000, directed by James Macdonald, nearly one and a half years after Kane&#x27;s death on 20 February 1999. The play has no explicit characters or stage directions. Stage productions of the play vary greatly, therefore, with between one and several actors in performance; the original production featured three actors. According to Kane&#x27;s friend and fellow playwright David Greig, the title of the play derives from the time, 4:48 a.m., when Kane, in her depressed state, often woke.

==Subject==
The play is usually interpreted as an expression of the experience of clinical depression, a disorder from which Kane suffered. She died by suicide after writing the play, before its initial performance. Contemplation and discussion of suicide are prominent and while there is no strict narrative or timeline, certain issues and events are clearly dealt with: deciding whether to take medication to treat depression, the desires of the depressed mind, the effects and effectiveness of medication, self-harm, suicide and the possible causes of depression. Other themes that run throughout the script, in addition to depression, are those of isolation, dependency, relationships, and love.

==Form==
&quot;4.48 Psychosis&quot; is composed of twenty-four sections which have no specified setting, characters or stage directions. Its language varies between dialogues, confessions and contemplative poetic monologues reminiscent of schizophasia. Certain images are repeated within the script, particularly that of &quot;hatch opens, stark light&quot;; a repeated motif in the play is &quot;serial sevens&quot; which involves counting down from one hundred by sevens, a bedside test often used by psychiatrists to test for loss of concentration or memory.

==Productions==
Owing to its form, productions of the play differ vastly in their staging, casting and design. The initial production of &quot;4.48 Psychosis&quot; at the Royal Court in 2000 had a cast of three: Daniel Evans, Jo McInnes and Madeleine Potter. There have been performances of &quot;4.48 Psychosis&quot; at The Theatre Les Bouffes Du Nord in Paris (2005), [[Belarus Free Theatre] in Minsk (2005), KUFER theatre in [[Croatia]] (2005.), [[Old Red Lion Theatre]] (Tangram Theatre, 2006), [[Arcola Theatre]] (2006), the [[Young Vic Theatre]] (2009), the [[Barbican Theatre]] (TR Warszawa, Easter 2010), Access Theatre (Raw Theatre Group, Easter 2010), The Theatre Project (Off Off-Broadway - The Red Room, Summer 2010), ADC Theatre (October 2010), [[York Theatre Royal]] (March 2011), Sittingbourne Community College Theatre Company (July 2011), The Hamilton Fringe Festival at [[Theatre Aquarius]] [Black Box Fire Theatre Company, July 2011] and the [[George Ignatieff Theatre]] at [[University of Toronto]] (27–29 October 2011), [[Academy of performing arts in Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]] directed by Sandra Polovková, Fourth Monkey Theatre Company (March 2012), [[Rangi Ruru Girls&#x27; School]] performed it in the [[Theatre New Zealand|New Zealand Theatre Federation Festival]] (September 2012), Crooked Pieces (Drayton Theatre London, September 2012), [[The Questors Theatre]] (January 2015), director Roza Sarkisian and Theatre Actor, Kyiv, Ukraine (2018), Anton&#x27;s Well Theater Company, Oakland, California (July—August 2018), Theatre Populus, [[Žilina]], [[Slovakia]] (October 2018) directed by Matej Trnovec and Chico State Theater Company at [[California State University, Chico]] (December 2022) directed by Susana Correa.

A critically acclaimed adaptation of the play, as translated into Polish with English language [[surtitles]], was performed at the 2008 [[Edinburgh International Festival]] by the Polish theatre company [[TR Warszawa]]. The production starred Polish film actress [[Magdalena Cielecka]] and featured a number of other performers from TR Warszawa in supporting roles. This was a revival of TR Warszawa&#x27;s earlier production of the play, as performed in [[Warsaw]]. In 2003, there was a successful staging in [[Brazil]], which played to a full house for six consecutive months in [[São Paulo]], and also gained media attention for its defying gender aspect, as the role was performed by male actor [[Luiz Päetow]]. Indian director [[Arvind Gaur]] performed this play as a one-woman show with British actress Ruth Sheard in 2005.

25 years after the original production, the play will be revived at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] and [[The Other Place (theatre)|The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon]] ([[Royal Shakespeare Company]]) featuring the original cast ([[Daniel Evans (actor)|Daniel Evans]], Jo McInnes and Madeleine Potter) and creative team (directed by [[James Macdonald (director)|James Macdonald]]) in June and July 2025.

==Reception==

&quot;4.48 Psychosis&quot; has divided critical opinions. [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] of &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper asked, &quot;How on earth do you award aesthetic points to a 75-minute suicide note?&quot; Charles Spencer of the &quot;Telegraph&quot; said &quot;it is impossible not to view it as a deeply personal howl of pain.” [[David Greig (dramatist)|David Greig]] considered the play to be &quot;perhaps uniquely painful in that it appears to have been written in the almost certain knowledge that it would be performed posthumously.&quot;

==Opera==
An operatic adaptation of &quot;4.48 Psychosis&quot;, commissioned by [[The Royal Opera|Royal Opera]] and written by British composer [[Philip Venables]], was staged at the [[Lyric Hammersmith]] in 2016. The first such adaptation of Kane&#x27;s works, the production was approved by Sarah Kane&#x27;s brother, and received critical acclaim.

==References to the play==
The British indie-rock band [[Tindersticks]] released a song called &quot;4.48 Psychosis&quot; on their album &quot;[[Waiting for the Moon (album)|Waiting for the Moon]]&quot;. The song&#x27;s spoken-word lyrics are excerpted from the play.

<text>Johann Friedrich Overbeck (3 July 1789 – 12 November 1869) was a German painter and a founder of the Nazarene art movement.

==Early life and education==
Overbeck was born in Lübeck in 1789. His family had been Protestant pastors for three generations; his father Christian Adolph Overbeck (1755-1821) was doctor of law, poet, mystic pietist and burgomaster of Lübeck. Near the family mansion in the Konigstrasse stood the &quot;Gymnasium&quot;, where his uncle, a doctor of theology and a voluminous writer, was the master; there Johann became a classic scholar and received instruction in art.

==Artistry==
===Art studies===
Overbeck left Lübeck in March 1806, and studied at the academy of Vienna, then under the direction of Heinrich Friedrich Füger. While he gained some of the polished technical aspects of the neoclassic painters, he was alienated by lack of religious spirituality in the themes chosen by his masters. He wrote to a friend that he had fallen among a vulgar set, that every noble thought was suppressed within the academy and that losing all faith in humanity, he had turned inward to his faith for inspiration.

In Overbeck&#x27;s view, the nature of earlier European art had been corrupted throughout contemporary Europe, starting centuries before the French Revolution, and the process of discarding its Christian orientation was proceeding further now. He sought to express Christian art before the corrupting influence of the late Renaissance, casting aside his contemporary influences, and taking as a guide early Italian Renaissance painters, up to and including Raphael. The training methods at the academy of Vienna were at an international level; however Overbeck wrote to his father around 1808, was it lacked &quot;heart, soul, sensation!&quot; Instead of technical skills and slavish studies (&quot;sklavisches Studium&quot;) exercising and working &quot;with a pure heart&quot; (&quot;in einem reinen Herzen&quot;) would aim to a renewal of art. Together with other disaffected young artists at the academy, he started a group named the &quot;Lukasbund&quot;, dedicated to exploring his alternative vision for art. After four years, the differences between his group and others in the academy had grown so irreconcilable, that Overbeck and his followers were expelled.

===Career===

He left for Rome, where he arrived in 1810, carrying his half-finished canvas of &quot;Christ&#x27;s Entry into Jerusalem&quot;. Rome became the centre of his labor for 59 years. He was joined by a company of like-minded artists, including Peter von Cornelius, Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow and Philipp Veit, who jointly housed in the old Franciscan convent of Sant&#x27;Isidoro, and became known among friends and enemies by the descriptive epithet of Nazarenes. Their precept was hard and honest work and holy living; they eschewed the antique as pagan, the Renaissance as false, and built up a severe revival on simple nature and on the serious art of Perugino, Pinturicchio, Francesco Francia and the young Raphael. The characteristics of the style thus educed were nobility of idea, precision and even hardness of outline, scholastic composition, with the addition of light, shade and colour, not for allurement, but chiefly for perspicuity and completion of motive. Overbeck in 1813 joined the Roman Catholic Church, and thereby he believed that his art received Christian baptism. It has been suggested that the Nazarenes should be considered a special branch of German Romanticism.

Commissions followed regularly. The Prussian consul, Jakob Salomon Bartholdy, had a house on the brow of the Pincian Hill, called Palazzo Zuccari or Casa Bartholdy, and he engaged the quartet of Overbeck, Cornelius, Veit and Schadow to fresco a room 7 metres square (now in the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin) with episodes from the story of Joseph and his Brethren. The subjects which fell to the lot of Overbeck were the &quot;Seven Years of Famine&quot; and &quot;Joseph sold by his Brethren&quot;, finished in 1818. In the same year, Prince Massimo commissioned Overbeck, Cornelius, Veit and Schnorr to cover the walls and ceilings of his garden pavilion, near St. John Lateran, with frescoes illustrative of Tasso, Dante and Ariosto. To Overbeck was assigned, in a room 5 metres square, the illustration of Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;; and of eleven compositions occupying one entire wall, is the Meeting of Godfrey de Bouillon and Peter the Hermit. After ten years delay, the overtaxed and enfeebled painter delegated the completion of the frescoes to his friend Joseph von Führich. The leisure thus gained was devoted to a thoroughly congenial theme, the &quot;Vision of St Francis&quot;, a wall painting 6.5 metres long, finished in 1830, for the Porziuncola in the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli near Assisi.

==Death==
He died in Rome in 1869. He was interred in the Chapel of St Francis in the Church of San Bernardo alle Terme, where he had worshipped.

==Honours==
Overbeck was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1864.

==Family==
His nephew Johannes Overbeck, a professor of archaeology at the University of Leipzig, was noted for his work in art history.

==Followers==
In 1843 the Church of St. John the Baptist, Penymynydd, North Wales was built by the Glynne Family of Hawarden, Flintshire. The first vicar, Rev. John Ellis Troughton spent the first 20 years of the life of the church painting the interior with Overbeck murals, including the Palm Sunday one - of which the original was destroyed in an Allied Bombing raid in 1942, overnight into Palm Sunday.

<doc id="890203" wikidata="Q6619147" url="?curid=890203" title="List of extinct animals of the British Isles">
<text>This is a list of extinct animals of the [[British Isles]], including extirpated species. Only a small number of the listed species are globally extinct (most famously the Irish elk, great auk and woolly mammoth). Most of the remainder survive to some extent outside the islands. The list includes introduced species only in cases where they were able to form self-sustaining colonies for a time. Only Pleistocene species, and specifically those extinct since the Ipswichian/Eemian interglacial (c. 130,000 – c. 115,000 before present (BP)), Devensian glaciation (c. 115,000 – c. 11,700 BP) or into the Holocene (c. 11,700 BP – present), are included (that is, the assemblage that can be approximately considered the &#x27;modern&#x27; fauna which displays insular differences from the mainland European fauna). The date beside each species is the last date when a specimen was observed in the wild or, where this is not known, the approximate date of extinction.
==Overview==
For most of its history, the British Isles were part of the main continent of Eurasia, linked by the region now known as Doggerland. Throughout the Pleistocene (Ice age) the climate alternated between cold glacial periods, including times when the climate was too cold to support much fauna, and temperate interglacials when a much larger fauna was present. Insularity first occurred around 125,000 BP, during the Ipswichian interglacial, when a warming climate raised sea levels and flooded Doggerland. This temperate climate supported an assemblage of species characterised by straight-tusked elephant (&quot;Palaeodoxodon antiquus&quot;). Around 115,000 BP the climate began to cool again as the Devensian glaciation began. The temperate species began to go extinct locally (many survived in southern refugia elsewhere in Europe). With the cooling climate, the sea level fell and by 60,000 BP a land bridge reformed so new or returning species could repopulate Britain. The colder climate supported a biome favoured by woolly mammoths (&quot;Mammuthus primigenius&quot;). By around 20,000 BP the climate was so cold, with much of Britain under ice and the rest a polar desert, that little life could survive, and the glacial fauna also went extinct. The climate began to warm again around 11,700 BP, entering the present climatic period known as the Holocene. Animals repopulated Britain and Ireland. Many of the former species had gone extinct during the interval, but the majority of the surviving European temperate fauna, and some new immigrants, including modern humans (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;), were able to reach Britain until the rising sea level once again isolated the islands. Great Britain was cut off from mainland Europe in around 8,200 BP by the Storegga Slide tsunami flooding Doggerland.

Extinctions in Britain over the period have thus had three main causes:
* Climate change as the ecosystem swung from temperate woodland and pasture, through open mammoth steppe to uninhabitable polar desert, and back.
* Habitat loss brought about by human activities, such as the clearing of woodland or draining of marshland.
* Hunting by humans.

It is important to remember that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence; the fossil record is always incomplete; and many of the early dates are very approximate, since caves in Britain were often excavated before modern archaeological stratifications and dating techniques.

===Key===
† – A species that is globally extinct
* – A species that is known to have been introduced by humans and was never present by natural immigration.

Some animals have gone extinct several times and then recolonized. The date given is of the most recent extinction. Species that have been introduced or reintroduced by humans are noted.

==Mammals==

==Birds==

*Common crane – late medieval period (re-established)
*Dalmatian pelican – c. 5000 BP
*Gadfly petrel (unknown &quot;Pterodroma&quot; species, presumed Fea&#x27;s petrel) – Iron Age
*Eurasian spoonbill – 17th century (as a breeding bird) (re-established)

==Reintroduction and re-establishment==
The white-tailed eagle has been successfully re-established on the western coast of Scotland. Having clung on in parts of Wales, red kites have been successfully re-established in parts of England and Scotland. Ongoing projects involve both these species: the corn crake into parts of England and Scotland, and the great bustard on Salisbury Plain.

European beavers have been reintroduced to parts of Scotland, and there are plans to bring them back to other parts of Britain. A five-year trial reintroduction at Knapdale in Argyll started in 2009 and concluded in 2014. A few hundred beavers live wild in the Tay river basin, as a result of escapes from a wildlife park. A similar reintroduction trial is being undertaken on the river otter in Devon, England. Also, around the country, beavers have been introduced into fenced reserves for many reasons including flood prevention. In 2016, beavers were recognised as a British native species, and will be protected under law.

In 2008, Eurasian elk were released into a fenced reserve on the Alladale Estate in the Highlands of Scotland. Reindeer were re-established in 1952; approximately 150–170 reindeer live around the Cairngorms region in Scotland.

Set up by the Wildwood Trust, Konik horses have been established across many reserves as a proxy for the extinct tarpan.

In 1998, MAFF, now known as DEFRA released a report concerning the presence of two populations of wild boar living freely in the UK. These boar are thought to have escaped from wildlife parks, zoos and from farms where they are farmed for their meat, and gone on to establish breeding populations.

Around 20 white storks pass through the UK each year. A colony at the Knepp Wildland in West Sussex, aided by zoologist Roisin Campbell-Palmer, hopes to reinforce these off-path migrants by introducing adults into a fenced reserve, where the juveniles born will be able to establish other colonies further afield.

The northern clade of the pool frog was reintroduced from Swedish stock in 2005, to a single site in Norfolk, England, following detailed research to prove that it had been native before its extinction around 1993.

Smaller species, mainly reptiles, such as the green lizard and Aesculapian snake, have formed colonies probably due to a result of release from captivity. There have also been calls for the return of the European tree frog to the wild.

Established in 2020, Celtic Reptile &amp; Amphibian, aims to reintroduce the lost species of reptile and amphibian that once inhabited Britain, back to rewilding projects. These include the moor frog, European tree frog, agile frog and European pond turtle. They have already had significant success breeding the moor frog in captivity. The organisation also wants to see European pond turtles re-established within wetland restoration projects.

The large blue butterfly has been successfully re-established from Swedish stock at several sites, but very few of these are open-access. There are also several successful cases of the establishment of new populations of heath fritillary.

There have been calls for the reintroduction of the Eurasian lynx, brown bear and grey wolf to the UK, because no large predators are living in viable populations in Great Britain. It is theorized that a large predators presence could create a trophic cascade, thus improving the ecosystem.

Three female bison were introduced to the West Blean and Thornden Woods in Kent, England on 18 July 2022. A calf, also female, was unexpectedly born in September 2022 and in December 2022 a bull was introduced. These five bison are first &quot;complete&quot; wild herd in the UK in thousands of years. As of October 2024, the herd consists of three females, a bull and four calves.

<text>Harpeth Hall School is a private, college-preparatory school for girls in the Green Hills neighborhood of Nashville, Tennessee, United States. Its beginning dates back to 1865 as a seminary for young ladies. After various mergers and name changes, the antecedent school closed in 1951, leading to the founding of the present school. The campus consists of a middle school and high school on a site.

== History ==

With the scheduled closing of Nashville&#x27;s Ward-Belmont College&#x27;s high school pending about 1950, a group of concerned citizens organized to ensure that a college-preparatory school for girls would continue in the city. This group purchased a 26-acre tract of land known as the P.M. Estes estate in southwest Nashville at the corner of Estes Road and Hobbs Road. One of the building committee members, Mary Elizabeth Cayce, suggested the name of the new school be &quot;Harpeth Hall&quot;, because of the proximity to the Harpeth River and that the words sounded &quot;euphonius&quot;

In the fall of 1951, the Ward-Belmont college-preparatory division reopened on a new campus and with a new name—the Harpeth Hall School. Harpeth Hall began the new school term with 161 students in grades 9 through 12, almost all of whom had transferred from Ward-Belmont. A Nashville historical marker at the 3801 Hobbs Road site commemorates the event. The first head of school, Mrs. Susan S. Souby, had previously headed the high school department at Ward-Belmont. The first administrators of Harpeth Hall and all but two members of the faculty were former members of the Ward-Belmont staff. The existing house on the newly acquired property served as Harpeth Hall&#x27;s first school building, later named Souby Hall. Within the next year, the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools accredited the school. It rapidly gained membership in the National Association of Independent Schools, the Southern Association of Independent Schools, and the Mid-South Association of Independent Schools.

During Harpeth Hall&#x27;s first decade, the facilities were expanded to include additional classroom space, an auditorium, gymnasium and cafeteria. In 1968, under the leadership of school head Idanelle McMurry, the Daugh W. Smith Middle School opened.

In 1998, a strategic plan was developed to address future faculty, program and facility needs. In 2000, a five-year, $42 million capital campaign entitled the &quot;Campaign for Harpeth Hall&quot; was launched to address these needs. By 2005, significant improvements to facilities were completed including a new library, a track and soccer complex, a visual arts center, and a middle school. In addition, the following facilities were renovated: the Jack C. Massey Center for Mathematics and Science, George N. Bullard Gymnasium, Frances Bond Davis Theatre, Marnie Sheridan Gallery, and Souby Hall. In 2007, the Hortense Bigelow Ingram Upper School completed major renovations on multiple buildings. A new Athletic and Wellness Center was completed in 2014.

== Diversity ==
When Nashville public schools were desegregated in September 1970, it was a time of turbulence in public education, for fear of the uncertain effects of court-ordered busing of students to achieve racial balance. Thirteen of Nashville&#x27;s established private schools, including Harpeth Hall, saw an increase in enrollment after the court decision. The IRS was ordered to deny tax-exempt status of any private school with a racially discriminatory admissions policy, but found no such discrimination even though many private schools had no black students. MBA headmaster Francis E. Carter told The &quot;Tennessean&quot; that black students were welcome, but that none had ever applied, which was typical of private schools in Nashville. Harpeth Hall developed an active program to increase diversity in its student body. In 1979, Harpeth Hall&#x27;s first black student was Cezanne Gray, who stated, &quot;I like breaking barriers and being the first&quot;. In 2015, ethnic and racial minority students comprised 13% of the student body; as of 2018, 16% of the student body received need-based financial grants. According to the school&#x27;s website, for the school year of 2020–2021 the average per aid grant is $18,568.

== Campus facilities ==
Harpeth Hall School is located in the residential Green Hills neighborhood of Nashville. The nucleus of the campus is Souby Hall, which is the administration building and is the original structure present when the land was purchased. Souby Hall has been extensively remodeled, but retains its original classic facade. As of 2016, there are 11 additional buildings including the upper school complex, a middle school, a library, a gymnasium, a theater, a gallery, a mathematics and science center, a visual arts center, a center for arts and athletics, a track and soccer complex, and an athletic and wellness center. The school has a field house, an eight lane track and two softball fields. In 2007, the school installed AstroTurf, a synthetic playing surface which is used for soccer and lacrosse, a first for a girls school in Tennessee.

In 2000, Harpeth Hall introduced a &quot;laptop initiative&quot; into the curriculum, creating a 1:1 student-to-computer ratio. Each student is given a laptop computer which is provided on a lease and maintained by the school&#x27;s technology department. A campus network links students and teachers for projects, homework and assignments.

Harpeth Hall collaborates with Montgomery Bell Academy, a school for boys located nearby. Both schools have a strong tradition of single-gender education, but have agreed to participate in joint drama and music programs, community service projects, sharing of athletic field space, and transportation to athletic competitions.

== Academics ==

In 2009, Harpeth Hall became one of the founding members of the Online School for Girls, a program that allows students to take advanced placement classes not offered by their own school. Harpeth Hall students participated in the inaugural year of the Online School, taking classes in Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, Computer Programming and Genetics. Eventually the program will allow any girl to enroll in courses, whether she is in public school or home schooled.

In 2011, the school opened a &quot;Center for STEM Education for Girls&quot;. The letters stand for &quot;Science, Technology, Engineering and Math&quot;, subjects that have stereotypically belonged to boys. The purpose of this program is to increase the number of young women pursuing college degrees and careers in the STEM fields. The program is funded through an Edward E. Ford Foundation Leadership Grant and other donors.

Harpeth Hall has received the National Service-Learning School award. In 2011, the school created a strategic partnership with a rural village in Western Kenya&#x27;s Lwala Province to support girls&#x27; education there and to provide service opportunities for Harpeth Hall students. An example is providing uniforms for sixth-grade African girls.

<doc id="890208" wikidata="Q4756992" url="?curid=890208" title="Andrew Fountaine">
<text>Andrew Douglas Algernon Maclean Fountaine (7 December 1918 – 14 September 1997) was a British far right activist. After military service in a number of conflicts, Fountaine joined the Conservative Party and was selected as a parliamentary candidate until his outspoken views resulted in his being disowned by the party.

Fountaine was subsequently involved with a number of fringe rightist movements before becoming a founding member of the National Front in 1967. He had several roles within the party and was involved in a number of internal feuds until he left in 1979. He briefly led his own splinter party before retiring from politics.

==Early years==
Born into a land-owning Norfolk family who had resided in ancestral Narford Hall, The son of Vice Admiral Charles Fountaine, who had been Naval ADC to King George V, Fountaine was educated at the Army College in Aldershot. One of his ancestors was an art collector. Fountaine drove an ambulance for the Abyssinians during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. He also attended Cambridge University studying natural sciences. He then fought for Francisco Franco&#x27;s forces during the Spanish Civil War, before enlisting in the Royal Navy as an ordinary seaman during the Second World War. During the war he was appointed a temporary sub-lieutenant. He served in the Pacific as gunnery officer on the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, attaining the rank of lieutenant-commander, before being invalided out after a &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack in April 1945.

==Conservative Party==
During the 1940s, Fountaine became involved with the Conservative Party, with his speeches becoming one of the highlights of the annual party conference, such as during the 1948 conference when he denounced the Labour Party as consisting of &quot;semi-alien mongrels and hermaphrodite communists&quot;. In 1949, he was chosen by the Tories as their candidate for Chorley in Lancashire at the next general election. A speech to the Tory Party conference that same year was considered to be antisemitic. As a result, the party chairman, Lord Woolton, disavowed his nomination. Nonetheless, no official Conservative candidate was nominated to take his place, and, as a result, Fountaine finished only 361 votes behind the winning candidate, the Labour incumbent Clifford Kenyon.

==John Bean==
Having left the Conservative Party, Fountaine launched his own group, known as the National Front Movement. This came to nothing, and so he became a member of the League of Empire Loyalists. He followed John Bean out of this group and was a founder member of the National Labour Party. Officially the leader of the NLP, Fountaine fulfilled this role because, being a landowner in Norfolk, he presented a more respectable image than Bean, although actual control lay with Bean. Fountaine remained a strong supporter of Bean and supported him in his later struggles with Colin Jordan in the earlier British National Party (BNP) in the 1960s, with Fountaine acting as party president. It was during this time that Fountaine&#x27;s land was used for &#x27;Spearhead&#x27; drilling exercises under the supervision of Jordan and John Tyndall.

Fountaine later claimed that during this time he regularly telephoned the home number of Harold Macmillan in order to tell the prime minister to do more to stop immigration, although he also added that Macmillan would hang up as soon as he heard Fountaine&#x27;s voice.

==National Front==
Along with the rest of the BNP, Fountaine became a founder member of the National Front (NF), although problems developed from the outset owing to his fractious relationship with A. K. Chesterton. Nonetheless, he was the party&#x27;s first parliamentary election candidate in Acton in a by-election in 1968, where he gained 1400 votes (over 5% of the total) and came fourth.

Alarmed by the protests of 1968, Fountaine believed that revolution was sure to follow in continental Europe and, fearing similar protests in the UK, told NF members to report to the police in order to offer their services in the event of revolution or civil war. Chesterton, who had no desire to hand details of the nascent movement to the police, promptly expelled Fountaine although the latter obtained a court order overturning the expulsion and at the 1968 party conference challenged Chesterton for the leadership. In the interim, Fountaine&#x27;s credibility had been attacked by John Tyndall in the pages of &quot;Spearhead&quot; magazine and with his reputation damaged he was easily routed by Chesterton&#x27;s 316 votes to 20. After a confrontation with Chesterton in which he told Fountaine to submit to his leadership or leave, Fountaine walked out with two of his closest supporters, Gerald Kemp and Rodney Legg, who joined him in resigning from the National Directorate of the NF.

Fountaine largely disappeared from view for some years after this, although during the internal struggles of 1974, which saw Tyndall as leader pitted against a newly emerged group of populists, pro-Tyndall elements claimed that Fountaine had secretly been conspiring with Roy Painter, at the time recognised as the leader of the populist faction. Despite this, Tyndall subsequently courted the support of Fountaine following the election of John Kingsley Read, who had emerged ahead of Painter as populist leader, as NF Chairman. Fountaine agreed to work with Tyndall, and at the 1975 conference proposed one of Tyndall&#x27;s favoured ideas, changing leadership elections from the existing system of National Directorate members only to a party-wide vote, a motion that was narrowly defeated. In November 1975, Tyndall was expelled from the party while Fountaine and Martin Webster were suspended for their part in recent machinations, although all three were reinstated by court order the following month. Kingsley Read and his supporters broke away to form the National Party soon afterwards.

Fountaine returned to public notice under Tyndall and was adopted as the party&#x27;s candidate for the 1976 Coventry North West by-election. His campaign secured only 3% of the vote in a city where the local branch had been divided by the National Party split, although Fountaine did at least beat Kingsley Read.

Fountaine&#x27;s alliance with Tyndall did not last, however, and he became openly critical of what he saw as the neo-Nazism of Tyndall and Webster, as well as their attempts to recruit elements he saw as undesirable, such as racist skinheads and football hooligans. As a result, by 1978 Fountaine had become a focus for dissident activity within the NF. In the 1979 election, Fountaine stood as National Front candidate in the Norwich South constituency, polling 264 votes (0.7%).

==Later years==
Following the NF&#x27;s failure at the 1979 general election, Fountaine split with Tyndall in 1979, and challenged him for the leadership, but was defeated and split from the NF to form his own NF Constitutional Movement, later called the Nationalist Party. The new party claimed 2,000 members by January 1980 and published a newspaper, &quot;Excalibur&quot;. The new movement was short-lived as Fountaine became disillusioned with the far right&#x27;s in-fighting. He retired from politics in 1981 to concentrate on growing trees on his estate Narford Hall, northwest of Swaffham, and remained there until his death in 1997.

Fountaine&#x27;s book &quot;Meaning of an Enemy&quot; was serialised in John Bean&#x27;s magazine &quot;Combat&quot; from 1960 to 1965. It was published by Ostara Publications in November 2012 .

==Personal life and death==
Fountaine had a son and a daughter from his first marriage, which lasted from 1949 to 1960, and another son from his second marriage, which lasted from September 1960 to his death.

Tony Martin (1944–2025), a Norfolk farmer who received extensive media coverage after shooting and killing a burglar at his Norfolk home, Bleak House near Wisbech in 1999, was a nephew by marriage of Fountaine.

Andrew Fountaine died in King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk on 14 September 1997, at the age of 78.

==Elections contested==
&quot;Note:&quot; Although Fountaine was the candidate of the local Conservative Party in 1950 his candidacy had been disavowed by the party at national level.

<text>Olympia Events, formerly known as Olympia London and sometimes referred to as the Olympia Exhibition Centre, is an exhibition centre, event space and conference centre in West Kensington, in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, London, England. A range of international trade and consumer exhibitions, conferences and sporting events are staged at the venue.

There is an adjacent railway station at Kensington (Olympia) which is both a London Overground station, and a London Underground station. The direct District Line spur to the station only runs at weekends.

== Background ==
The complex first opened in 1886.

The Grand Hall and Pillar Hall were completed in 1885. The National Hall annexe was completed in 1923, and in 1930 the Empire Hall was added.

After World War II, the West London exhibition hall was in single ownership with the larger nearby Earls Court Exhibition Centre. The latter was built in the 1930s as a rival to Olympia.

In 2008, ownership of the two venues passed from P&amp;O to Capco Plc which sold it off as a going concern, while Earls Court was being demolished in 2014 as part of an ambitious regeneration scheme to create more luxury housing.
In 2012, Olympia celebrated 125 years of events by commissioning British artists Peter Blake, Rob Ryan, Sanna Annukka and Paul Hicks to create their interpretations of the venues.

In January 2013, a £40 million investment was completed and the company re-launched with a new brand; subsequently the business was awarded the Best Marketing Campaign at the Exhibition News Awards 2014.

In May 2021, demolition work started at the site as part of a significant overhaul of the complex, which includes new construction and refurbishment of listed historic aspects.

== History ==

Olympia was originally conceived in the early 1880s as the National Agricultural Hall, a larger version of the Royal Agricultural Hall (1861–62, Grade II) in Islington. The project of building a National Agricultural Hall was conceived by Edwyn Sherard Burnaby (1830-1883), MP for Leicestershire North, who primarily wanted to see shows such as the military Royal Tournament, held at the Royal Agricultural Hall in Islington since 1880, staged on a much larger scale and made more easily accessible by railway from across London and the rest of the country.

The site chosen was a former market garden in West Kensington, immediately adjacent to Addison Road station, already a major passenger station on the West London Railway, which became an important method of transport for visitors to Olympia. The building was branded as Olympia even before it opened as its commercial rationale quickly evolved beyond the staging of agricultural or military shows into an open-ended exploitation of what was the largest such venue in England at the time. Intended as a large indoor space for exhibitions, tournaments, sporting competitions and entertainments of various kinds, the building followed in the tradition of large-scale exhibition halls popularised by the Great Exhibition in 1851, the inspiration for various imitators in London, elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and around the world.

== Buildings ==

The Olympia Exhibition Centre consists of:

*The Grand Hall, the former National Agricultural Hall.

*The Pillar Hall, the former Minor Hall, both of 1885 in Italianate style by Henry Edward Coe with James Edmeston and engineers Arthur T Walmisley and Max Am Ende. The ironwork of the roof is by Handyside of Derby.

*Olympia National (the former National Hall), an annexe of 1923 by architects Holman and Goodrham.

*Olympia Central (built as the Empire Hall) of 1929, by architect Joseph Emberton. Olympia Central, with its large Olympia signage integral to the building&#x27;s exterior, is very well known as it fronts onto a public road, Hammersmith Road. The others buildings are primarily accessed via a small access road which also serves Olympia Tube Station.

In 2003, The Grand Hall and the Pillar Hall of 1885, designed by Coe and Edmeston, were given historic status, listed at Grade II* for their historic interest and their architectural value. Olympia Central, a large concrete building in the Moderne architectural style was not fully listed due to the number of changes made through the 20th Century, however its distinctive façade was listed.

In May 2021, demolition started on the non-listed parts of Olympia Events as part of a comprehensive mix-used redevelopment of the complex by its current owners, while still retaining significant exhibition space. In May 2021, the Olympia Theatre was announced with 1,575 seats, making it the largest new theatre in London since the completion of the National Theatre in 1976. This is in addition to previously announced and consented hotels, rehearsal spaces, cinemas, 4,000 seat music venue, retail, dining and public spaces. The major 21st Century redevelopment of Olympia is within the same site boundaries as the historic event spaces.

<text>Henry Hugh Pierson (12 April 1815 – 28 January 1873) was an English composer resident from 1845 in Germany. He was born Henry Hugh Pearson and his middle name is sometimes given as Hugo. His original name was Henry Hugh Pearson, in Germany he used Heinrich Hugo Pierson. He had success in his adopted country with his operas and songs but little in his own, and his music is now rarely performed.

==Life==
Pierson was the son of a clergyman, Rev. Dr. Hugh Nicholas Pearson. He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied counterpoint with Thomas Attwood Walmisley. From 1839 to 1844 he studied music in Germany under C. H. Rink, Tomaschek and Reissiger. He also studied in Prague with Václav Tomášek. His amorous adventures included an apparent liaison with Mary Shelley, before he married in 1844. Although elected Reid Professor of Music at Edinburgh University in 1844 he was made to resign when he did not take up his duties and subsequently based himself in Germany. Hubert Parry took lessons with him in 1867.

==Compositions (selective list)==
Many of Pierson&#x27;s manuscript full and vocal scores, including those of his oratorios and operas, appear not to have survived. The funeral march &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;The Maid of Orleans&quot; were his only orchestral compositions to be published in full score (copies of which are held by the Library of Congress amongst other locations), whilst &quot;Jerusalem&quot; and &quot;Faust&quot; were only published in vocal score, with no orchestral material seeming to be extant. His operas remained unpublished, excepting the libretti. Manuscript material for several works does, however, survive including the &quot;Romantische Ouverture&quot; (orchestral parts, University Of Pennsylvania Library Ms Coll 217), (full score, Royal College of Music, London, RCM MS 502), the funeral march &quot;Hamlet&quot; (full score, Landesbibliothek Coburg, Ms Mus 364), the first version of the overture to the opera &quot;Leila&quot; (full score, Landesbibliothek, Coburg, Ms Mus 369) and the opera &quot;Leila&quot; (57 orchestral and choral parts, University Library [Carl von Ossietzky Music Department], Hamburg, D-Hs/ ND VII 310).

<text>Wood Lane (A219; formerly A40) is a street in London. It runs north from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, under the Westway (A40) past Wormwood Scrubs where it meets Scrubs Lane. The road is wholly in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham (W12 postal district). It is probably best known as the home of the BBC Television Centre, also BBC White City and formerly BBC Woodlands the offices of BBC Worldwide.

==History==

In the 1780s, the road was known as Turvens Lane after Turvens House located a short distance north of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green. By the 1830s it had received its current name. In the 1860s the railway arrived with a line running parallel with Wood Lane but the area was still rural in character with the buildings of Wood Lane Farm, Eynam Farm and Hoof&#x27;s Farm to the east of the road and a plant nursery to the west covering the land east of present-day Frithville Gardens and south of the BBC Television centre. Even into the 20th century the land either side of Wood Lane remained undeveloped until the area was chosen for the site of the 1908 Franco-British exhibition and 1908 Summer Olympics.

The area to the west of Wood Lane, north of Loftus Road stadium, south of Du Cane Road and east of Bloemfontein Road was laid out as the exhibition site. The numerous pavilions faced with white stone earned the exhibition the nickname &quot;the White City&quot; which subsequently remained with the area, even after the exhibition closed and its pavilions were demolished.

White City Stadium built to host the Olympics was located on the site of BBC White City.

===Wood Lane Underground stations===

The Central London Railway (CLR, now the Central line) opened Wood Lane station in 1908 on the north side of its Wood Lane depot to serve the exhibition. Originally intended to be a temporary service it survived until 1947 when it was replaced by White City station a short distance to the north.

The Metropolitan Railway also opened a station on its line between Paddington and Hammersmith (now the Hammersmith &amp; City line). The station, also called Wood Lane although separate from the CLR&#x27;s station, was adjacent to the railway bridge over Wood Lane. This station survived until it was destroyed by fire in 1959.

To serve the new White City shopping centre development, a new station on the Hammersmith &amp; City line, also called Wood Lane opened on 12 October 2008 to the east of Wood Lane.

<doc id="890232" wikidata="Q1566641" url="?curid=890232" title="Hair cell">
<text>Hair cells are the sensory receptors of both the auditory system and the vestibular system in the ears of all vertebrates, and in the lateral line organ of fishes. Through mechanotransduction, hair cells detect movement in their environment. 

In mammals, the auditory hair cells are located within the spiral organ of Corti on the thin basilar membrane in the cochlea of the inner ear. They derive their name from the tufts of stereocilia called &quot;hair bundles&quot; that protrude from the apical surface of the cell into the fluid-filled cochlear duct. The stereocilia number from fifty to a hundred in each cell while being tightly packed together and decrease in size the further away they are located from the kinocilium.

Mammalian cochlear hair cells are of two anatomically and functionally distinct types, known as outer, and inner hair cells. Damage to these hair cells results in decreased hearing sensitivity, and because the inner ear hair cells cannot regenerate, this damage is permanent. Damage to hair cells can cause damage to the vestibular system and therefore cause difficulties in balancing. However, other vertebrates, such as the frequently studied zebrafish, and birds have hair cells that can regenerate.
The human cochlea contains on the order of 3,500 inner hair cells and 12,000 outer hair cells at birth.

The outer hair cells mechanically amplify low-level sound that enters the cochlea. The amplification may be powered by the movement of their hair bundles, or by an electrically driven motility of their cell bodies. This so-called somatic electromotility amplifies sound in all tetrapods. It is affected by the closing mechanism of the mechanical sensory ion channels at the tips of the hair bundles.

The inner hair cells transform the sound vibrations in the fluids of the cochlea into electrical signals that are then relayed via the auditory nerve to the auditory brainstem and to the auditory cortex.

== Inner hair cells – from sound to nerve signal ==

The deflection of the hair-cell stereocilia opens mechanically gated ion channels that allow any small, positively charged ions (primarily potassium and calcium) to enter the cell. Unlike many other electrically active cells, the hair cell itself does not fire an action potential. Instead, the influx of positive ions from the endolymph in the scala media depolarizes the cell, resulting in a receptor potential. This receptor potential opens voltage gated calcium channels; calcium ions then enter the cell and trigger the release of neurotransmitters at the basal end of the cell. The neurotransmitters diffuse across the narrow space between the hair cell and a nerve terminal, where they then bind to receptors and thus trigger action potentials in the nerve. In this way, the mechanical sound signal is converted into an electrical nerve signal. Repolarization of hair cells is done in a special manner. The perilymph in the scala tympani has a very low concentration of positive ions. The electrochemical gradient makes the positive ions flow through channels to the perilymph.

Hair cells chronically leak Ca2+. This leakage causes a tonic release of neurotransmitter to the synapses. It is thought that this tonic release is what allows the hair cells to respond so quickly in response to mechanical stimuli. The quickness of the hair cell response may also be due to the fact that it can increase the amount of neurotransmitter release in response to a change of as little as 100 μV in membrane potential.

Hair cells are also able to distinguish tone frequencies through one of two methods. The first method, found only in non-mammals, uses electrical resonance in the basolateral membrane of the hair cell. The electrical resonance for this method appears as a damped oscillation of membrane potential responding to an applied current pulse. The second method uses tonotopic differences of the basilar membrane. This difference comes from the different locations of the hair cells. Hair cells that have high-frequency resonance are located at the basal end while hair cells that have significantly lower frequency resonance are found at the apical end of the epithelium.

== Outer hair cells – acoustical pre-amplifiers ==

In mammalian outer hair cells, the varying receptor potential is converted to active vibrations of the cell body. This mechanical response to electrical signals is termed somatic electromotility;
it drives variations in the cell&#x27;s length, synchronized to the incoming sound signal, and provides mechanical amplification by feedback to the traveling wave.

Outer hair cells are found only in mammals. While hearing sensitivity of mammals is similar to that of other classes of vertebrates, without functioning outer hair cells, the sensitivity decreases by approximately 50 dB. Outer hair cells extend the hearing range to about 200 kHz in some marine mammals. They have also improved frequency selectivity (frequency discrimination), which is of particular benefit for humans, because it enabled sophisticated speech and music. Outer hair cells are functional even after cellular stores of ATP are depleted.

The effect of this system is to nonlinearly amplify quiet sounds more than large ones so that a wide range of sound pressures can be reduced to a much smaller range of hair displacements. This property of amplification is called the cochlear amplifier.

The molecular biology of hair cells has seen considerable progress in recent years, with the identification of the motor protein (prestin) that underlies somatic electromotility in the outer hair cells. Prestin&#x27;s function has been shown to be dependent on chloride channel signaling and that it is compromised by the common marine pesticide tributyltin. Because this class of pollutant bioconcentrates up the food chain, the effect is pronounced in top marine predators such as orcas and toothed whales.

== Hair cell signal adaptation ==

Calcium ion influx plays an important role for the hair cells to adapt to the amplification of the signal. This allows humans to ignore constant sounds that are no longer new and allow us to be acute to other changes in our surrounding. The key adaptation mechanism comes from a motor protein myosin-1c that allows slow adaptation, provides tension to sensitize transduction channels, and also participate in signal transduction apparatus. More recent research now shows that the calcium-sensitive binding of calmodulin to myosin-1c could actually modulate the interaction of the adaptation motor with other components of the transduction apparatus as well.

Fast Adaptation: During fast adaptation, Ca2+ ions that enter a stereocilium through an open MET channel bind rapidly to a site on or near the channel and induce channel closure. When channels close, tension increases in the tip link, pulling the bundle in the opposite direction. Fast adaptation is more prominent in sound and auditory detecting hair cells, rather in vestibular cells.

Slow Adaption: The dominating model suggests that slow adaptation occurs when myosin-1c slides down the stereocilium in response to elevated tension during bundle displacement. The resultant decreased tension in the tip link permits the bundle to move farther in the opposite direction. As tension decreases, channels close, producing the decline in transduction current. Slow adaptation is most prominent in vestibular hair cells that sense spatial movement and less in cochlear hair cells that detect auditory signals.

==Neural connection== 

Neurons of the auditory or vestibulocochlear nerve (the eighth cranial nerve) innervate cochlear and vestibular hair cells. The neurotransmitter released by hair cells that stimulates the terminal neurites of peripheral axons of the afferent (towards the brain) neurons is thought to be glutamate. At the presynaptic juncture, there is a distinct &quot;presynaptic dense body&quot; or ribbon. This dense body is surrounded by synaptic vesicles and is thought to aid in the fast release of neurotransmitter.

Nerve fiber innervation is much denser for inner hair cells than for outer hair cells. A single inner hair cell is innervated by numerous nerve fibers, whereas a single nerve fiber innervates many outer hair cells. Inner hair cell nerve fibers are also very heavily myelinated, which is in contrast to the unmyelinated outer hair cell nerve fibers. The region of the basilar membrane supplying the inputs to a particular afferent nerve fibre can be considered to be its receptive field.

Efferent projections from the brain to the cochlea also play a role in the perception of sound. Efferent synapses occur on outer hair cells and on afferent axons under inner hair cells. The presynaptic terminal bouton is filled with vesicles containing acetylcholine and a neuropeptide called calcitonin gene-related peptide. The effects of these compounds vary; in some hair cells the acetylcholine hyperpolarizes the cell, which reduces the sensitivity of the cochlea locally.

== Regrowth ==
Research on the regrowth of cochlear cells may lead to medical treatments that restore hearing. Unlike birds and fish, humans and other mammals are generally incapable of regrowing the cells of the inner ear that convert sound into neural signals when those cells are damaged by age or disease. Researchers are making progress in gene therapy and stem-cell therapy that may allow the damaged cells to be regenerated. Because hair cells of auditory and vestibular systems in birds and fish have been found to regenerate, their ability has been studied at length. In addition, lateral line hair cells, which have a mechanotransduction function and are found in anamniotes, have been shown to regrow in species such as the zebrafish.

Researchers have identified a mammalian gene that normally acts as a molecular switch to block the regrowth of cochlear hair cells in adults. The Rb1 gene encodes the retinoblastoma protein, which is a tumor suppressor. Rb stops cells from dividing by encouraging their exit from the cell cycle. Not only do hair cells in a culture dish regenerate when the Rb1 gene is deleted, but mice bred to be missing the gene grow more hair cells than control mice that have the gene. Additionally, the sonic hedgehog protein has been shown to block activity of the retinoblastoma protein, thereby inducing cell cycle re-entry and the regrowth of new cells.

Several Notch signaling pathway inhibitors, including the gamma secretase inhibitor LY3056480, are being studied for their potential ability to regenerate hair cells in the cochlea.

TBX2 (T-box transcription factor 2) has been shown to be a master regulator in the differentiation of inner and outer hair cells. This discovery has allowed researchers to direct hair cells to develop into either inner or outer hair cells, which could help in replacing hair cells that have died and prevent or reverse hearing loss.

The cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1 (CDKN1B) has also been found to encourage regrowth of cochlear hair cells in mice following genetic deletion or knock down with siRNA targeting p27. Research on hair cell regeneration may bring us closer to clinical treatment for human hearing loss caused by hair cell damage or death.

<text>Commercial Road is a street in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in the East End of London. It is long, running from Gardiner&#x27;s Corner (previously the site of Gardiners department store, and now Aldgate East Underground station), through Stepney to the junction with Burdett Road in Limehouse at which point the route splits into the East India Dock Road and the West India Dock Road. It is an artery connecting the historic City of London with the more recently developed financial district at Canary Wharf, and part of the A13.

The road contains several listed buildings. These include the George Tavern, the Troxy cinema, the Limehouse Town Hall, the former Caird and Rayner Ltd works and the Albert Gardens estate.

==Route==
Commercial Road starts at a junction with Whitechapel High Street (the A11 close to Aldgate East tube station. It heads east, crossing the Limehouse Basin, the Regents Canal and the Limehouse Cut. At Burdett Road, the road forks in two, with East India Dock Road continuing to the left and West India Dock Road to the right.

London Buses routes 15, 115 and 135 run along Commercial Road.

==History==

Commercial Road was constructed in 1802–1806 as a direct route to link dock traffic between the West India Docks and East India Docks to the City of London. An act of Parliament awarded construction to the Commercial Road Company, whose trustees were allowed to raise money and levy tolls. The road originally began at Back Church Lane and cut a straight line across fields north of the busy Ratcliffe Highway, taking advantage of land cleared by a major fire in 1794 that had destroyed a large part of the neighbourhood. By the 1830s it was almost entirely lined with houses all the way to Limehouse.

In 1828, the Commercial Road Company built a tramway from Aberdeen granite along the road, to alleviate traffic concerns. The London and Blackwall Railway was built parallel to Commercial Road; along with the numerous factories, this caused the street to become overcrowded and polluted.

In the 1860s Commercial Road became a public road, with ownership transferring to the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW), and road tolls were abolished. In 1870, the MBW extended the street westwards to Gardiner&#x27;s Corner, where it met Whitechapel High Street and Commercial Street. This junction remained in place until Gardner&#x27;s was destroyed in a fire in the early 1970s.

In 1943, Commercial Road was marked for improvement in the County of London Plan, after much of the surrounding area had been destroyed by bombing. Numerous side streets south of the road towards Ratcliffe Highway were cleared of slums and replaced with modern housing. The Commercial Road Conservation Area was established by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in 1989. It is focused on numerous listed buildings around Nos. 300–334 about halfway along the road.

==Buildings==

The George Tavern is at No. 373. It was built around 1820–25 on the site of an earlier pub, the Halfway House, which had been established since at least 1654. It became Grade II listed in 1973.

Albert Gardens lies to the south of Commercial Road. It was laid out in the early 19th century, originally named Albert Square Garden, and has largely survived intact into the 21st century. The square consists of three sides of three-storey residential buildings constructed in the 1840s, overlooking a railed garden. The other side faces onto Commercial Road. The land was brought by the London County Council in 1899 to prevent development on the fourth side, and opened the land to the public in 1906. It was given its current name in 1937.

Nos. 440–450 are all Grade II listed. They were built in the early 19th century as a terrace, and all span four storeys with parapets roofs, round arched entrances and panelled doors.

The Troxy Cinema at No. 490 was opened by George Coles and Arthur Roberts in 1933 on a former brewery site. It cost £250,000 to develop and could house over 3,000 people. The main theatre housed a revolving stage Wurlitzer organ which could be raised from the orchestra pit to provide interval music; these have survived intact. It closed in 1960, reopening in 1963 as a training school for the Covent Garden Opera. It subsequently became a bingo hall. It was grade II listed in 1991.

Limehouse Town Hall is at No. 646, constructed in 1879 by A. and C. Harston. It was badly damaged in World War II and rebuilt as council offices. It has subsequently served as the National Museum of Labour History, a homeless shelter, and an arts centre. The Passmore Edwards Sailors Palace at No. 680 was built in 1901 in a Neo Tudor style. It has been Grade II listed since 1983.
The Grade II listed former premises of Caird and Rayner Ltd at No. 777–783 was constructed in 1869. It contained a timber frame enclosed by a brick exterior. In 2010, it caught fire which destroyed most of the roof. Urgent repairs took place in 2010 in light of its listed status.

The Star of the East, at No. 805 was built in the early 19th century, and Grade II listed in 1973. It was constructed from red brick with a slate roof. In 2019, urgent repairs were made to the premises in order for it to retain its listed status.

The Church of St Mary and St Michael is at No. 340. It was designed by William Wardell and constructed between 1852 and 1856. A sloping roof was built over the entrance in the 1920s. It became Grade II listed in June 2001. The Congregation of Jacob Synagogue is at Nos. 351–353. It was founded in 1903 as Britain&#x27;s first Mizrachi synagogues, and moved into the present building in 1920. The premises had been originally constructed by Lewis Solomon and Son. London&#x27;s first mosque, the East London Mosque, opened on Commercial Road in 1941 and remained there until it was relocated to Whitechapel in 1975.

A K2 phone box outside No. 48 Commercial Road was Grade II listed in 1987. It was designed by Giles Gilbert Scott and installed in 1927.

==Traffic==
As the main route between the City and the traditional East End, Commercial Road is the busiest road in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. There is continuous heavy traffic along the road, with limited opportunities for pedestrians crossing.

<doc id="890238" wikidata="Q181191" url="?curid=890238" title="Eurasian beaver">
<text>The Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) or European beaver is a species of beaver widespread across Eurasia, with a rapidly increasing population of at least 1.5 million in 2020. The Eurasian beaver was hunted to near-extinction for both its fur and castoreum, with only about 1,200 beavers in eight relict populations from France to Mongolia in the early 20th century. It has since been reintroduced into much of its former range and now lives from Western, Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, Russia through China and Mongolia, with about half the population in Russia. It is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Castor fiber&quot; was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who described the beaver in his work &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Between 1792 and 1997, several Eurasian beaver zoological specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, including:
*&quot;C. f. albus&quot; and &quot;C. f. solitarius&quot; by Robert Kerr in 1792
*&quot;C. f. fulvus&quot; and &quot;C. f. variegatus&quot; by Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1801
*&quot;C. f. galliae&quot; by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1803
*&quot;C. f. flavus&quot;, &quot;C. f. varius&quot; and &quot;C. f. niger&quot; by Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest in 1822
*&quot;C. f. gallicus&quot; Johann Baptist Fischer in 1829
*&quot;C. f. proprius&quot; by Gustaf Johan Billberg in 1833
*&quot;C. f. albicus&quot;, &quot;C. f. balticus&quot; and &quot;C. f. vistulanus&quot; by Paul Matschie in 1907
*&quot;C. f. birulai&quot; and &quot;C. f. pohlei&quot; by Serebrennikov in 1929
*&quot;C. f. tuvinicus&quot; by Lavrov in 1969
*&quot;C. f. belarusicus&quot; and &quot;C. f. osteuropaeus&quot; by Lavrov in 1974
*&quot;C. f. belorussicus&quot; and &quot;C. f. orientoeuropaeus&quot; by Lavrov in 1981
*&quot;C. f. bielorussieus&quot; by Lavrov in 1983
*&quot;C. f. introductus&quot; by Saveljev in 1997
These descriptions were largely based on very small differences in fur colour and cranial morphology, none of which warrant a subspecific distinction.
In 2005, analysis of mitochondrial DNA of Eurasian beaver samples showed that only two evolutionarily significant units exist: a western phylogroup in Western and Central Europe, and an eastern phylogroup in the region east of the Oder and Vistula rivers. The eastern phylogroup is genetically more diverse, but still at a degree below thresholds considered sufficient for subspecific differentiation.

==Description==
The Eurasian beaver&#x27;s fur colour varies between regions. Light, chestnut-rust is the dominant colour in Belarus. In Russia&#x27;s Sozh River basin, it is predominantly blackish brown, while in the Voronezh Nature Reserve beavers are both brown and blackish-brown.

The Eurasian beaver is one of the largest living rodent species and the largest rodent native to Eurasia. Its head-to-body length is with a long tail length. It weighs around . By the average weights known, it appears to be the world&#x27;s second heaviest rodent after the capybara, and is slightly larger and heavier than the North American beaver. One exceptionally large recorded specimen weighed , but it is reportedly possible for the species to exceptionally exceed .

===Differences from North American beaver===

Although the Eurasian beaver appears superficially similar to the North American beaver, there are several important differences, chief among these being that the North American beaver has 40 chromosomes, while the Eurasian beaver has 48. The two species are not genetically compatible: the result of over 27 attempts in Russia to hybridise the two species was just one stillborn kit, bred from the pairing of a male North American beaver and a female Eurasian beaver. The difference in chromosome count makes interspecific breeding unlikely in areas where the two species&#x27; ranges overlap.

==== Fur ====
The guard hairs of the Eurasian beaver have longer hollow medullae at their tips. There is also a difference in the frequency of fur colours: 66% of Eurasian beavers overall have beige or pale brown fur, 20% have reddish brown, nearly 8% are brown, and only 4% have blackish coats; among North American beavers, 50% have pale brown fur, 25% are reddish brown, 20% are brown, and 6% are blackish.

==== Head ====
The Eurasian beaver has a larger, less rounded head; a longer, narrower muzzle. The Eurasian beaver also has longer nasal bones, with the widest point being at the end of the snout; in the case of the North American beaver, the widest point is at the middle of the snout. The Eurasian beaver has a triangular nasal opening, unlike those of the North American beavers, which are square. Furthermore, the foramen magnum is rounded in the Eurasian beaver, but triangular in the North American beaver.

==== Body ====
The Eurasian beaver has shorter shin bones than the North American species and a narrower, less oval-shaped tail, making it less capable of bipedal locomotion. The anal glands of the Eurasian beaver are larger, and thin-walled, with a large internal volume, relative to that of the North American beaver.

==Behaviour and ecology==


The Eurasian beaver is a keystone species, as it helps to support the ecosystem which it inhabits. It creates wetlands, which provide habitat for European water vole, Eurasian otter and Eurasian water shrew. By coppicing waterside trees and shrubs it facilitates their regrowth as dense shrubs, thus providing cover for birds and other animals. Beavers build dams that trap sediment, improve water quality, recharge groundwater tables and increase cover and forage for trout and salmon. Also, abundance and diversity of vespertilionid bats increase, apparently because of gaps created in forests, making it easier for bats to navigate.

===Reproduction===
Eurasian beavers have one litter per year, coming into oestrus for only 12 to 24 hours, between late December and May, but peaking in January. Unlike most other rodents, beaver pairs are monogamous, staying together for multiple breeding seasons. Gestation averages 107 days and they average three kits per litter with a range of two to six kits. Most beavers do not reproduce until they are three years of age, but about 20% of two-year-old females reproduce.

===Diet===
European beavers are herbivorous, eating &quot;water and river bank plants&quot;, including tubers, &quot;rootstocks of myrtles, cattails, water lilies&quot;, and also trees, including softwood tree bark. Their long appendices and the microorganisms within make possible the digestion of bark cellulose. Their daily food intake is approximately 20% of their body weight.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Eurasian beaver is recovering from near extinction, after depredation by humans for its fur and for castoreum, a secretion of its scent gland believed to have medicinal properties. The estimated population was only 1,200 by the early 20th century. In many European nations, the Eurasian beaver became extinct, but reintroduction and protection programmes led to gradual recovery so that by 2020, the population was at least 1.5 million. It likely survived east of the Ural Mountains from a 19th-century population as low as 300 animals. Factors contributing to their survival include their ability to maintain sufficient genetic diversity to recover from a population as low as three individuals, and that beavers are monogamous and select mates that are genetically different from themselves. About 83% of Eurasian beavers live in the former Soviet Union due to reintroductions.

===Continental Europe===

The Eurasian beaver lives in almost all countries in Continental Europe, from Spain and France in the West, to Russia and Moldova in the East, and Montenegro, Serbia and Bulgaria in the Southeast. In 2022, beaver signs were found in Portugal, near the border with Spain. The only significant areas where it has no known population are the Southern Balkans: Albania, Kosovo, Northern Macedonia, Greece and European Turkey. It is also not known to be present in the microstates of Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City.

In Spain, the beaver was extirpated in the 17th century. In 2003, 18 beavers were unofficially released. Current range includes the Ebro river in La Rioja, Navarre, and province of Zaragoza; the Zadorra river up to Vitoria-Gasteiz, the Arga river up to Pamplona, the Huerva river up to Mezalocha, and the Jalón river into the province of Soria. In November 2021, a young beaver was photographed for the first time outside the Ebro basin, in the upper Douro river in Soria. In 2020, the population was estimated to be more than 1,000. In June 2024, a beaver was sighted at the Tagus river basin near Zorita de los Canes.

In Portugal, the beaver was distributed mostly in the main river basins north of the Tagus River, until it was extirpated around 1450. In 2023, signs of beaver activity were found on the Douro river about 5 km from the Spanish border.

In France, the Eurasian beaver was almost extirpated by the late 19th century, with only a small population of about 100 individuals surviving in the lower Rhône valley. Following protection measures in 1968 and 26 reintroduction projects, it re-colonised the Rhône river and its tributaries, including the Saône, and other river systems such as Loire, Moselle, Tarn and Seine. In 2011, the French beaver population was estimated at 14,000 individuals living along of watercourses. In 2022, its range was estimated to have increased to of watercourses.

In Germany, around 200 Eurasian beavers survived at the end of the 19th century in the Elbe river system in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg. Official reintroduction programs, in particular in Bavaria, resulted in major population growth and beavers are now found throughout most of eastern and southern Germany, with strongly established disjunct populations in the west. By 2019, beavers numbered above 40,000, and appear in many urban areas.

In the Netherlands, beavers were completely extirpated by 1826. Due to official reintroductions since 1988, beavers are now found in most parts of the country, in particular the south, centre and north-west. The population was around 3500 in 2019.

In Belgium the beaver was extirpated in 1848. Current populations are descendants of animals released in the Ardennes in 1998–2000 and in Flanders in 2003. Some beavers also arrived in Flanders from the Netherlands in 2003. In 2018, the population was 2,200–2,400, with Flanders having around 400 beavers and Wallonia 1,800–2,000 beavers.

In Switzerland, the Eurasian beaver was hunted to extirpation in the early 19th century. Between 1956 and 1977, 141 individuals from France, Russia and Norway were reintroduced to 30 sites in the Rhône and Rhine catchment areas. As of 2019, Switzerland had an estimated 3,500 beavers (a sharp increase from 1,600 beavers in 2008), with permanent beaver presence along most larger rivers of the Swiss plateau and the Swiss Alps (with the exception of Ticino).

In Poland, as of 2014, the beaver population had grown to 100,000 individuals.

In Romania, beavers became extinct in 1824, but were reintroduced in 1998 along the Olt River, spreading to other rivers in Covasna County. In 2014, the animals were confirmed to have reached the Danube Delta.

In Russia, by 1917, beaver populations remained in four isolated territories: in the Dnieper basin; in the Don basin; in the northern Urals and in the upper reaches of the Yenisei along the Azas river. The total number of beavers did not exceed 900 heads. Beaver hunting was banned in 1922. In 1923, a hunting reserve was organised in the Voronezh region along the Usman river, which in 1927 was transformed into the Voronezh State Reserve. At the same time, two more such reserves were created: Berezinsky and Kondo-Sosvinsky. 1927 also included the first attempts to reintroduce beavers in other areas. As a result, by the end of the 1960s, the beaver&#x27;s range in the Soviet Union was almost as large as in the 17th century. The beavers’ growing numbers made commercial capture possible again. In 2016, there were an estimated 661,000 beavers in Russia; in 2019, the estimate was 774,600.

In the lands that made up the Soviet Union, almost 17,000 beavers were translocated from 1927 to 2004. Some 5,000 of these went to Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic States and Kazakhstan.

In Greece, the Eurasian beaver was present in the Last Glacial Period; remains have been found in Epirus. Beaver remains from the Neolithic have been found in coastal Evros and Argura; from the Neolithic to Bronze Age transition period in the Ptolemaida basin and in Sitagroi; and beaver remains from the Early Helladic II have been found in northeastern Peloponnese. In the 4th century BC, Aristotle described this species under the name λάταξ/ (latax). He wrote that it is wider than the otter, with strong teeth, and at night it often uses these teeth to cut down trees on riverbanks. Ιt&#x27;s not clear when beavers vanished from Kastoria (which may have been named after the beaver – κάστορας in Greek), but as late as the 18th century they were still hunted for fur. Buffon wrote that they were very rare in Greece at that time. In the 19th century, beavers could still be found in the Alfeios river and in Mesolongi.

In Bulgaria, fossil, subfossil and subrecent remains have been found in 43 localities along 28 lowland rivers, from Struma and Maritsa in the south till the Danube in the north, while the last finds from Nicopolis ad Istrum date to the 1750–1850 period. In 2021, the Eurasian beaver was confirmed to have returned to Bulgaria.

In Serbia, beavers were mostly extinct by the 1870s, with the last specimens being seen around 1900–1902. In 2004, 31 beavers were reintroduced in the Zasavica reserve by the Biology Faculty of the Belgrade University in collaboration with the Bavarian Science Society, and 45 beavers were released in the Obedska bara reserve. They spread quickly. By 2020, they had spread north, west and east, inhabiting rivers in the Sava-Danube system (Drina, Jadar, Great Morava, Tamnava, Tisza, Bega, Timiș, the canal system in Vojvodina), they were found in the capital Belgrade, and had spread to neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In Italy, beavers returned in 2018 after an absence of almost 500 years, when they were spotted in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region.

The beaver resurgence in Eurasia has brought an increase in human-beaver encounters. In May 2013, a Belarusian fisherman who &quot;tried to grab&quot; a beaver died after it bit him several times, severing an artery in his leg, which caused him to bleed to death.

===The Nordics===
In Denmark, the beaver appears to have gone extinct 2,000–2,500 years ago, though a small population might have survived into the 1st millennium AD. In 1999, 18 beavers were reintroduced to the river Flynder in Klosterhede Plantage state forest in west-central Jutland, brought from the Elbe river in Germany. At Arresø in northern Zealand, 23 beavers were reintroduced between 2009 and 2011. By 2019, it was estimated that the Jutland population had increased to 240–270 individuals, and had spread far, from Hanstholm in the north to Varde and Kolding in the south. The population in northern Zealand, which had yet to significantly expand its geographic range, had increased to 50–60 individuals in 2019.

In Norway, there was still a beaver population in the early 1900s, one of the few surviving in Europe at that time. Following protection, the Norwegian range of the species has expanded. The surviving population was in southern Norway; beavers were reintroduced to central Norway&#x27;s Ingdalselva River watershed on the Agdenes peninsula in Sør-Trøndelag in 1968–1969. The area is hilly to mountainous, with many small watersheds. Rivers are often too steep for beavers, so their habitat is scattered, and there&#x27;s often only room for one territory in a habitat patch. The beavers spread slowly from watershed to watershed in the hilly terrain. Some spread could only be plausibly explained by assuming travel through sheltered sea water in fjords.

In Sweden, the Eurasian beaver had been hunted to extinction around 1870. Between 1922 and 1939, some 80 individuals were imported from Norway and introduced to 19 sites in Sweden. In 1995, the Swedish beaver population was estimated at 100,000.

In Finland, there are some Eurasian beavers that have been re-introduced or spread from Sweden, but most of the Finnish population is a released North American beaver population. This population is controlled to prevent it from spreading into areas inhabited by the Eurasian beaver.

===British Isles===

The Eurasian beaver was well-established in Great Britain, but was driven extinct there by humans in the 16th century, with the last known historical reference in England in 1526. It is unclear whether beavers ever existed in Ireland. In the early 21st century, the beaver became the first mammal to be successfully reintroduced in the United Kingdom, after unofficial and official reintroductions to Scotland and England.

In Scotland, free-living beaver populations occur around the River Tay and Knapdale areas. The Knapdale population, sourced from Norway, was released by the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, while the other populations are of unknown origin. Sixteen beavers were released between 2009 and 2014 in Knapdale forest, Argyll. A 2009 release of three beaver families of 11 individuals was the start of the Scottish Beaver Trial, a five-year research project to assess the effects of beaver reintroduction. Over the course of the trial, 16 individual beavers were released in total, with the goal of establishing four breeding pairs. 14 beaver kits were born; by the end of the trial in 2014, eight of the reintroduced beavers had survived and one or two of the wild-born beavers were estimated to be alive in the Knapdale area. In 2016, the Scottish government declared that the beaver populations in Knapdale and Tayside could remain and naturally expand. Beaver translocations now occur throughout many catchments in Scotland.

In England, wild beavers are now present in all nine regions, with a population exceeding 1,000 (2024 estimate). Most sites are recent authorised introductions in large enclosures, but there are established completely free-living populations in the South West. A population of unknown origin has been present on the River Otter, Devon since 2008. An additional pair was released to increase genetic diversity in 2016. As part of a scientific study, a pair of Eurasian beaver was released in 2011 into a three-hectare fenced enclosure near Dartmoor in southern Devon. The 13 beaver ponds now in place impacted flooding to the extent of releasing precipitation over days to weeks instead of hours. In 2019, a beaver pair was reintroduced in East Anglia for the first time. A four-hectare beaver enclosure on a farm in North Essex is part of a flood risk reduction project designed to reduce property flooding. The impact on flooding, wildlife and rural tourism is monitored by a private landowner.

The places in England where beavers now live include the following (date first present):
* South West England: Cornwall (2023); Devon (2008); Dorset (2021); Gloucestershire (2019);Somerset (2023); Wiltshire (2023);
* South East England: Hampshire (2023); Kent (2003); Surrey (2021); West Sussex (2020);
* Greater London: (2022);
* East Midlands: Derbyshire (2021); Nottinghamshire (2021);
* West Midlands: Staffordshire (2023); West Midlands (2024); Worcestershire (2023);
* East of England: Essex (2019); Norfolk (2021); Suffolk (2024);
* North West England: Cheshire (2020); Cumbria (2020);
* Yorkshire and the Humber: North Lincolnshire (2023); North Yorkshire (2019);
* North-East England: Northumberland (2023).

In 2022, beavers became legally protected in England, &quot;making it illegal to capture, kill, injure or disturb them.&quot;

In Wales a family of beavers has lived since 2021 in the Cors Dyfi nature reserve in Powys.

=== Asia ===
Fossils of &quot;C. fiber&quot; have been discovered in the famous Denisova Cave. In Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey, subfossil evidence of beavers extends down to the floodplains of the Tigris-Euphrates basin, and a carved stone stela dating between 1,000 and 800 BC in the Tell Halaf archaeological site along the Khabur River in northeastern Syria depicts a beaver. Although accounts of 19th-century European visitors to the Middle East appear to confuse beavers with otters, a 20th-century report of beavers by Hans Kummerlöwe in the Ceyhan River drainage of southern Turkey includes the diagnostic red incisor teeth, flat, scaly tail, and presence of gnawed willow stems.

According to the &quot;Encyclopaedia Iranica&quot;, early Iranian Avestan and Pahlavi, and later Islamic literature, all had different words for otter and beaver, and castoreum was highly valued in the region. Johannes Ludwijk Schlimmer, a noted Dutch physician in 19th-century Iran, reported small numbers of beavers below the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates, along the bank of the Shatt al-Arab in the provinces of Shushtar and Dezful. Austen Layard reported finding beavers during his visit to the Kabur River in Syria in the 1850s, but noted they were being rapidly hunted for said castoreum to extirpation. Beavers were specifically sacred to Zoroastrianism (which also revered otters), and there were laws against killing these animals.

In China, a few hundred beavers live in the basin of the Ulungur River near the international border with Mongolia. The Bulgan Beaver Nature Reserve (; ) was established in 1980 to protect the creatures.

== Fossil record ==
Fossils found in the Spanish region around Atapuerca show that the Eurasian beaver was present in the Early Pleistocene but not in the Middle Pleistocene despite apparently favourable environmental conditions. It reappeared in the region during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene.

== Conservation ==

The Eurasian beaver &quot;Castor fiber&quot; was once widespread in Europe and Asia but by the beginning of the 20th century both the numbers and range of the species had been drastically diminished, mainly due to hunting. At this time, the global population was estimated to be around 1,200 individuals, living in eight separate sub-populations. Conservation of the Eurasian beaver began in 1923 in the Soviet Union, with the establishment of the Voronezh Nature Reserve. From 1934 to 1977, approximately 3,000 Eurasian beavers from Voronezh were reintroduced to 52 regions from Poland to Mongolia. In 2008, the Eurasian beaver was categorized as least concern on the IUCN Red List, as the global population had recovered sufficiently with the help of global conservation programmes. Currently, the largest population resides in Europe, where it was reintroduced in 25 countries and conservation efforts are ongoing. However, populations in Asia remain small and fragmented, and are under considerable threat.

<text>Edward George Dannreuther (4 November 1844, in Strasbourg – 12 February 1905, in Hastings) was a pianist and writer on music, resident from 1863 in England. His father had crossed the Atlantic, moving to Cincinnati, and there established a piano manufacturing business. Young Edward, under pressure from his father to enter banking as a career, a prospect he found uncongenial, escaped to Leipzig in 1859.

He trained as a musician at the Leipzig Conservatoire, where he was a pupil of Ignaz Moscheles. A youthful champion of composer Richard Wagner, he founded the London Wagner Society in 1872. In 1863 he had been recruited by Henry Chorley to play the piano in London at the Crystal Palace Concerts. His performances of Chopin and Beethoven were well received; after his marriage in 1871 he decided to settle permanently in England. His two-volume work &quot;Musical Ornamentation&quot; was for many years the standard text, and an important influence on the evolving trend of performance practice.

Dannreuther became a professor of piano at the Royal College of Music in 1895, a position he held until his death. An enthusiast for new music, he was an important influence on the composer Hubert Parry, who was his pupil. A memorial plaque on his former home at 12 Orme Square, Westminster, London was unveiled on 26 July 2005.

His son Hubert Edward Dannreuther (1880–1977) was a British admiral and one of six survivors of the sinking of HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;. Another son Tristan Dannreuther (1872–1963) also served as an officer in the Royal Navy, and was an Assistant Director of Naval Intelligence after World War I.

<text>John Allen &quot;Jack&quot; Eddy (March 25, 1931 – June 10, 2009) was an American astronomer. He studied historical sunspot records, and popularised the name &quot;Maunder Minimum&quot; for the sunspot minimum which occurred in the late 17th century.

==Childhood and education==

John Eddy was born and raised in Pawnee City, Nebraska. His brother Robert was two years his senior and his sister Lucille was two years his younger. His father managed a cooperative farm store where John worked until he started high school. John&#x27;s mother had attained college for one year and was a county schoolteacher until she married his father. The Eddy family were of limited economic means and were concerned that they could not afford a college education for John. As it turned out, he was the only member of the family to graduate from college. In 1948, he attended Doane College in Crete, Nebraska for one year, a distance of some from his home. In 1949 he was appointed by Senator Kenneth Wherry of Nebraska, who also resided in Pawnee City, to the U.S. Naval Academy. At Annapolis, there were few science courses but Eddy attended a course in celestial navigation, which gave him a love of the sky. So great was his interest in the night sky that once after Taps, he crawled out on the roof of Bancroft Hall to look for the Constellation Draco and was caught by an officer who gave him five hours of extra duty for not being in bed.

Upon graduation in 1953 from the United States Naval Academy, Eddy served for four years at sea as a line officer on aircraft carriers during the Korean War and later in the Persian Gulf as navigator and operations officer on a destroyer in the Atlantic Fleet. In 1957 he left active service in the Navy to continue his education. He was discharged and accepted into the graduate school at the University of Colorado&#x27;s mathematics program, but switched departments before the start of the Fall 1957 semester, upon discovering the University&#x27;s observatory and a program in astro-geophysics that had just been started, becoming the program&#x27;s first student. Later he joined the High Altitude Observatory at the University of Colorado.

==Academic career==
As a protege of Gordon Newkirk, Eddy worked with Princeton Professor Martin Schwarzschild in studying the solar corona with coronagraphs mounted on stratospheric balloons at altitudes of . Eddy completed his PhD Thesis at the University of Colorado at Boulder in December 1961 titled &quot;The Stratospheric Solar Aureole&quot;. After obtaining his PhD, Eddy went into teaching, while maintaining an active research schedule to maintain his credentials. He studied spectral lines and worked on infrared spectroscopy.

==Interdisciplinary work==
Eddy received much criticism from within the astronomy community for his interdisciplinary work on Native American medicine wheels, which showed how they were used as calendars and observatories. It also earned him criticism from archaeologists at first, although his work was eventually accepted, and later documented in National Geographic and as a guest on TV and radio programs.

As a teacher, he frequently used historical examples to show his students that not so long ago nobody knew more than they did about solar physics. This led him to do a lot of research in the history of his own field, particularly covering records of past eclipses and sunspot counts, whereupon he discovered the records of Edward Maunder and others demonstrating that there was indeed long term variability in solar activity. Eugene Parker of the University of Chicago, when promoting his theory of the existence of a solar wind, exposed Eddy to Maunder&#x27;s work on sunspot records.

==Solar minimum paper==
In 1976 Eddy published a paper in Science titled &quot;The Maunder Minimum&quot; where, using the nineteenth century works of Edward W. Maunder and Gustav Spörer, he identified a 70-year period from 1645 to 1715 in which solar activity was extremely low. In making the case for the anomaly, he gathered and interpreted data from a wide variety of sources, including first-hand accounts from extant historical observations of the Sun going back to the telescopic observations of Galileo and other contemporary scientists of the 17th and early 18th centuries; from historical reports of the aurora borealis observed in past centuries in Europe and the New World; from visual observations of sunspots seen with the unaided eye at sunrise and sunset in dynastic records from the Orient; from existing descriptions of the eclipsed Sun; and from measurements of carbon-14 in dated tree-rings. In the last of these, which can be used as a proxy indicator of solar activity, he found evidence of other similar periods of solar quiescence in the distant past, the most recent an even longer 90-year span, from about 1460 until 1550, which he named the Spörer Minimum.

Both the Maunder and Spörer minima fell during the coldest parts of the Little Ice Age, which suggested a connection between the longer term behavior of the Sun and of the Earth&#x27;s mean surface temperature. In advancing the theory that the Sun is a variable star, Eddy wrote that &quot;It has long been thought that the Sun is a constant star of regular and repeatable behavior. Measurements of the radiative output, or solar constant, seem to justify the first assumption, and the record of periodicity in sunspot numbers is taken as evidence of the second. Both records, however, sample only the most recent history of the Sun.&quot;

==Post-academia==
Eddy was laid off from the High Altitude Observatory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in 1973 due to budget cutbacks and the poor performance reviews he earned due to his interdisciplinary forays, which were frowned upon at the time. He then was hired by NASA to write a book, which enabled him to travel east to do research in the great astronomy libraries, particularly at Harvard and the Naval Observatory, which he used to also do research on the Maunder Minimum. His work on this was published in the journal &quot;Science&quot; as a cover story. After publication, his former employers at the HAO tried to hire him back. The interest resulting from &quot;The Maunder Minimum&quot; paper saw him giving over 50 talks a year around the world about his work and history.

In 1987 Eddy was awarded the Arctowski Medal by the National Academy of Sciences for studies in solar physics and solar-terrestrial relationships and specifically for &quot;his demonstration of the existence and nature of solar variations of long term and the consequences of these changes for climate and for mankind.&quot;

==Death==
Eddy died of cancer at his home in Tucson, Arizona on June 10, 2009.

<doc id="890249" wikidata="Q4060048" url="?curid=890249" title="Statistics Act">
<text>The Statistics Act () is an Act of the Parliament of Canada passed in 1918 which created the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, now called Statistics Canada since 1971.

The &quot;Statistics Act&quot; gives Statistics Canada the authority to &quot;collect, compile, analyze, abstract, and publish information on the economic, social and general conditions of the country and its citizens.&quot;

To balance Statistics Canada&#x27;s extensive powers to collect information, the &quot;Act&quot; establishes the legal requirement for the agency to protect the confidentiality of respondents to Statistics Canada surveys. The legislation makes a formal commitment to respondents that the information they provide will never be released to anyone in a form that will identify them without their authorization.

==Legal requirement==

Citizens who refuse to participate in providing information, or who provide false information, have committed an offence under the &quot;Act&quot; under c. S-19:

&quot;...information collected under the authority of the Statistics Act, R.S.C. 1985...and must be provided by law.&quot;

Refusal to provide information: &quot;...are liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars or/and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months.&quot;

In the event of a voluntary survey, &quot;the Minister may, by order, authorize the obtaining, for a particular purpose, of information, other than information for a census of population or agriculture, on a voluntary basis, but where such information is requested section 31 does not apply in respect of a refusal or neglect to furnish the information.&quot; 1980-81-82-83, c. 47, s. 41.

Other legislation relating to this act include:

* &quot;Access to Information Act&quot; 1983
* &quot;Privacy Act&quot; 1983

==Consent to release future census records==

After years of study by expert panels, discussion, debate (privacy vs the interests of genealogists and historians), and two earlier legislative attempts, Bill S-18 &quot;An Act to Amend the Statistics Act&quot; received Royal Assent on June 18, 2005. The 2005 Act creates section 18.1 of the &quot;Statistics Act&quot; which releases personal census records for censuses taken between 1911 and 2001, inclusive, 92 years after each census. In addition, starting with the 2006 Census, Canadians can consent to the public release of their personal census information after 92 years. (See Question 53 of Canada 2006 Census.) Census returns are in the custody of Statistics Canada and the records are closed until 92 years after the taking of a census, when those records may be opened for public use and transferred to Library and Archives Canada subject to individual consent where applicable.

==2016 Amendments==

In 2010, the Conservative government of Stephen Harper passed an Order in Council determining that only the short-form Census would be mandatory during the 2011 round of the Census. The mandatory long-form Census was transformed into an optional National Household Survey . This change to the Census was the subject of much controversy.

Following the election of the liberal government of Justin Trudeau, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development introduced in the House of Commons Bill C-36, An Act to amend the Statistics Act on 7 December 2016. The amendments were passed by Royal Assent on December 13, 2017. The Government of Canada press release stated that the amendments were made to the Statistics Act to &quot;ensure that decisions on statistical matters are transparent and are based on professional considerations.&quot;

The amendments to the Act were intended to:&lt;br&gt;
* strengthen the independence and powers of the Chief Statistician
* ensure greater transparency regarding the directives issued to the Chief Statistician
* establish the Canadian Statistics Advisory Council
* protect personal information provided in response to Statistics Canada&#x27;s requests
* remove imprisonment as a penalty for individuals who refuse or neglect to respond to Statistics Canada&#x27;s requests or who provide false information&quot;
The changes to the Act included empowering the Chief Statistician to &quot;decide, based strictly on professional statistical standards that he or she considers appropriate, the methods and procedures for carrying out statistical programs regarding (i) the collection, compilation, analysis, abstraction and publication of statistical information that is produced or is to be produced by Statistics Canada&quot;.

<text>Myra Melford (born January 5, 1957) is an American avant-garde jazz pianist and composer. A 2013 Guggenheim Fellow, Melford was described by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; as an &quot;explosive player, a virtuoso who shocks and soothes, and who can make the piano stand up and do things it doesn&#x27;t seem to have been designed for.&quot;

== Early life and education ==
Melford was born in Evanston, Illinois and was raised in a house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. At 3, she started playing the piano on her own, climbing onto the piano bench and improvising. She began taking lessons when she was in kindergarten. She developed a strong relationship with her teacher, Erwin Helfer, a classically trained boogie-woogie player. Helfer introduced her to classical composers such as Bach before moving on to contemporary composers, such as Bartók, and later taught her to play the blues. Melford attended blues festivals, and because of her relationship with Helfer, she was often invited backstage, where she encountered many of Chicago&#x27;s most acclaimed performers. Independently, Melford also began to explore improvisation.

Pushed towards performing classical repertoire, Melford attended a Northwestern University extension program in junior high school. She described her experience as a classical piano student as &quot;not right,&quot; and while she continued to play informally, she stopped her formal studies in high school.&lt;ref name=&quot;dance/thhreadgill&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Melford enrolled at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, where she intended to study environmental science. Although she was not then listening to jazz, and had not grown up listening to it, she knew that it involved improvisation, and when she saw an advertisement for jazz piano lessons in a local restaurant, she began studying again. She recalled that, during the next few years, &quot;There were two records... which were on constant repeat: Cecil Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Air Above Mountains&quot; and Ornette Coleman&#x27;s &quot;The Shape of Jazz to Come&quot;.&quot; Shortly thereafter, she switched her major to music, and in 1980 attended Cornish College of the Arts and studied with Art Lande and Gary Peacock.

While living in Olympia, Melford met prominent avant-garde musicians including Oliver Lake, Anthony Braxton, Marty Ehrlich and Leroy Jenkins, whose performance with Amina Claudine Myers and Pheeroan akLaff inspired an &quot;ecstatic feeling&quot; which intensified her commitment to improvisation.

== Career ==
Melford moved to New York City in 1984, where she studied composition with saxophonist Henry Threadgill, whom she would later cite as a major influence on her perception of organic composition. She also studied privately with pianists Jaki Byard and Don Pullen, whose percussive mannerisms she adapted.

After arriving in New York, Melford performed in the bands of Threadgill, Leroy Jenkins, and Butch Morris, among others. In the late 1980s she played and recorded with flutist Marion Brandis, and formed a trio with bassist Lindsey Horner and drummer Reggie Nicholson. Her career accelerated in the early 1990s, as she participated in the first Knitting Factory tour of Europe, and recorded three albums with Horner and Nicholson: &quot;Jump&quot; (1990), &quot;Now &amp; Now&quot; (1991), and &quot;Alive in the House of Saints&quot;, a live album, in 1993.

Later in the 1990s, Melford moved toward larger groupings with diverse instrumentation, and added trumpeter Dave Douglas and reed player Marty Ehrlich to her trio lineup to create a quintet, the Myra Melford Extended Ensemble. She also formed a second five-piece, the Same River, Twice, featuring Douglas, cellist Erik Friedlander, reed player Chris Speed, and drummer Michael Sarin. Their self-titled debut album was released on Gramavision in 1996, followed by 1999&#x27;s &quot;Above Blue&quot; on Arabesque. Melford also appeared as an improvisational collaborator on the 1996 Hatology release &quot;Eleven Ghosts&quot;, featuring duets performed with Dutch drummer Han Bennink; and &quot;Equal Interest&quot;, a 1999 Omnitone release by the trio of the same name, featuring Melford with Jenkins and Joseph Jarman of the Art Ensemble of Chicago. With Equal Interest, Melford performed on harmonium as well as piano. By the close of the decade, Melford had become one of the downtown jazz scene&#x27;s most celebrated performers and composers, with the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; describing her in 1999 as an &quot;explosive pianist who alternately caresses and pounds the keyboard and weaves brilliant swatches of composed material into free-form improvisation.&quot;

In 2000, Melford formed Crush, a trio in which she played piano and harmonium with Kenny Wollesen on drums and Stomu Takeishi on electric bass. Arabesque released the trio&#x27;s &quot;Dance Beyond the Color&quot; later that year. In September, she traveled to Calcutta to study harmonium with Sohanlal Sharma as a Fulbright scholar. She spent several months with Sharma, focusing on raga and Hindustani classical music, and continued her studies with other musicians in Delhi and Rajistan. She additionally studied with Sudhir Nayak in Mumbai.

After returning to the United States, Melford lived at an upstate New York ashram. She subsequently formed an ensemble expressly to play music based on her studies in India, Myra Melford&#x27;s Be Bread. Although it remained unreleased until 2006, Be Bread&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Image of Your Body&quot; (whose title was derived from a Rumi poem), was recorded in 2003, as was &quot;Where the Two Worlds Touch&quot; by Myra Melford&#x27;s The Tent, released by Arabesque.

Melford relocated to Berkeley, California in 2004 to accept a position as Professor of contemporary improvisational music, University of California Berkeley. In 2006, along with bassist Mark Dresser and drummer Matt Wilson, Melford formed Trio M, who released their debut album, &quot;The Big Picture&quot;, on Cryptogramophone in 2007. It was followed by &quot;The Guest House&quot; on Enja/Yellowbird in 2012.

Melford performs with clarinetist/composer Ben Goldberg, who she met just after she moved to Berkeley, in the duo Dialogue. Melford formed a new quintet, Snowy Egret, featuring bassist Takeishi, guitarist Liberty Ellman, trumpeter Ron Miles, and drummer Tyshawn Sorey in 2012. In October, Melford won the 2012 Alpert Award for &quot;her ascending and expansive trajectory, great, generous musical mind and her ability to take multiple musical traditions into another sphere.&quot;

Melford released her first solo album in October 2013. Titled &quot;Life Carries Me This Way&quot;, the album is a collection of work inspired by the paintings of the late visual artist Don Reich. That same year, she was named a Guggenheim Fellow and received both the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation&#x27;s Performing Artist Award and a Doris Duke Residency to Build Demand for the Arts for her efforts to re-imagine the jazz program at San Francisco&#x27;s Yerba Buena Center for the Arts; in November, Snowy Egret performed the music for Melford&#x27;s multimedia project &quot;Language of Dreams&quot;, at the center.

At Berkeley, Melford has developed and taught a series of courses in contemporary jazz and improvisation-based music for performers and composers in addition to lecturing on innovations in jazz since the 1960s and other topics in contemporary improvised music.

<text>Arthur Murray Blythe (July 5, 1940 – March 27, 2017) was an American jazz alto saxophonist and composer. He was described by critic Chris Kelsey as displaying &quot;one of the most easily recognizable alto sax sounds in jazz, big and round, with a fast, wide vibrato and an aggressive, precise manner of phrasing&quot; and furthermore as straddling the avant garde and traditionalist jazz, often with bands featuring unusual instrumentation.

== Biography ==

Born in Los Angeles, Blythe lived in San Diego, returning to Los Angeles when he was 19 years old. He took up the alto saxophone at the age of nine, playing R&amp;B until his mid-teens when he discovered jazz. In the mid-1960s, Blythe was part of the Underground Musicians and Artists Association (UGMAA), founded by Horace Tapscott, on whose 1969 &quot;The Giant Is Awakened&quot; he made his recording debut.

After moving to New York in the mid-1970s, Blythe worked as a security guard before being offered a place as sideman for Chico Hamilton (1975–77). He subsequently played with Gil Evans&#x27; Orchestra (1976–78), Lester Bowie (1978), Jack DeJohnette (1979) and McCoy Tyner (also 1979). Blythe&#x27;s group – John Hicks, Fred Hopkins and Steve McCall – played Carnegie Hall and the Village Vanguard in 1979.

In 1977, Blythe appeared on the LP &quot;Rhythmatism&quot;, a recording led by drummer Steve Reid. Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau highlighted Blythe&#x27;s &quot;forceful&quot; alto-saxophone playing and said, &quot;like so many of the new players Blythe isn&#x27;t limited to modern methods by his modernism—he favors fluent, straight-ahead Coltrane modalities, but also demonstrates why he belongs on a tune for Cannonball.&quot;

Blythe began to record as a leader in 1977 for the India Navigation label and then for Columbia Records from 1978 to 1987. Bob Stewart&#x27;s tuba was a regular feature of these albums, often taking the place of the more traditional string bass. Albums such as &quot;The Grip&quot; and &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; (both on the label) demonstrated Blythe&#x27;s maturity as well as his ability to play in both free and traditional contexts with a fully-developed personal style. Blythe played on many pivotal albums of the 1980s, among them Jack DeJohnette&#x27;s &quot;Special Edition&quot; on ECM. Blythe was a member of the all-star jazz group The Leaders and joined the World Saxophone Quartet after the departure of Julius Hemphill. Beginning in 2000 he made recordings on Savant Records which included &quot;Exhale&quot; (2003) with John Hicks (piano), Bob Stewart (tuba), and Cecil Brooks III (drums).

Blythe died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease in Lancaster, California, at the age of 76.

<text>The European mink (Mustela lutreola), also known as the Russian mink and Eurasian mink, is a semiaquatic species of mustelid native to Europe.

It is similar in colour to the American mink, but is slightly smaller and has a less specialized skull. Despite having a similar name, build and behaviour, the European mink is not closely related to the American mink, being much closer to the European polecat and Siberian weasel (&quot;kolonok&quot;). The European mink occurs primarily by forest streams unlikely to freeze in winter. It primarily feeds on voles, frogs, fish, crustaceans and insects.

The European mink is listed by the IUCN as Critically Endangered due to an ongoing reduction in numbers, having been calculated as declining more than 50% over the past three generations and expected to decline at a rate exceeding 80% over the next three generations. European mink numbers began to shrink during the 19th century, with the species rapidly becoming extinct in some parts of Central Europe. During the 20th century, mink numbers declined all throughout their range, the reasons for which having been hypothesised to be due to a combination of factors, including climate change, competition with (as well as diseases spread by) the introduced American mink, habitat destruction, declines in crayfish numbers and hybridisation with the European polecat. In Central Europe and Finland, the decline preceded the introduction of the American mink, having likely been due to the destruction of river ecosystems, while in Estonia, the decline seems to coincide with the spread of the American mink.

==Evolution and taxonomy==
Fossil finds of the European mink are very rare, thus indicating the species is either a relative newcomer to Europe, probably having originated in North America, or a recent speciation caused by hybridization. It likely first arose in the Middle Pleistocene, with several fossils in Europe dated to the Late Pleistocene being found in caves and some suggesting early exploitation by humans. Genetic analyses indicate, rather than being closely related to the American mink, the European mink&#x27;s closest relative is the European polecat (perhaps due to past hybridization) and the Siberian weasel, being intermediate in form between true polecats and other members of the genus. The closeness between the mink and polecat is emphasized by the fact the species can hybridize.

===Subspecies===
, seven subspecies are recognised.

==Description==

===Build===
The European mink is a typical representative of the genus &quot;Mustela&quot;, having a greatly elongated body with short limbs. However, compared to its close relative, the Siberian weasel, the mink is more compact and less thinly built, thus approaching ferrets and European polecats in build. The European mink has a large, broad head with short ears. The limbs are short, with relatively well-developed membranes between the digits, particularly on the hind feet. The mink&#x27;s tail is short, and does not exceed half the animal&#x27;s body length (constituting about 40% of its length). The European mink&#x27;s skull is less elongated than the kolonok&#x27;s, with more widely spaced zygomatic arches and has a less massive facial region. In general characteristics, the skull is intermediate in shape between that of the Siberian weasel and the European polecat. Overall, the skull is less specialized for carnivory than that of polecats and the American mink. Males measure in body length, while females measure . Tail length is in males and . Overall weight is . It is a fast and agile animal, which swims and dives skilfully. It is able to run along stream beds, and stay underwater for one to two minutes. When swimming, it paddles with both its front and back limbs simultaneously.

===Fur===

The winter fur of the European mink is very thick and dense, but not long, and quite loosely fitting. The underfur is particularly dense compared with that of more land-based members of the genus &quot;Mustela&quot;. The guard hairs are quite coarse and lustrous, with very wide contour hairs which are flat in the middle, as is typical in aquatic mammals. The length of the hairs on the back and belly differ little, a further adaptation to the European mink&#x27;s semiaquatic way of life. The summer fur is somewhat shorter, coarser and less dense than the winter fur, though the differences are much less than in purely terrestrial mustelids.

In dark coloured individuals, the fur is dark brown or almost blackish-brown, while light individuals are reddish brown. Fur colour is evenly distributed over the whole body, though in a few cases, the belly is a bit lighter than the upper parts. In particularly dark individuals, a dark, broad dorsal belt is present. The limbs and tail are slightly darker than the trunk. The face has no colour pattern, though its upper and lower lips and chin are pure white. White markings may also occur on the lower surface of the neck and chest. Occasionally, colour mutations such as albinos and white spots throughout the pelage occur. The summer fur is somewhat lighter, and dirty in tone, with more reddish highlights.

===Differences from American mink===
The European mink is similar to the American mink, but with several important differences. The tail is longer in the American species, almost reaching half its body length. The winter fur of the American mink is denser, longer and more closely fitting than that of the European mink. Unlike the European mink, which has white patches on both upper and lower lips, the American mink almost never has white marks on the upper lip. The European mink&#x27;s skull is much less specialised than the American species&#x27; in the direction of carnivory, bearing more infantile features, such as a weaker dentition and less strongly developed projections. The European mink is reportedly less efficient than the American species underwater.

==Behaviour==

===Territorial and denning behaviours===

The European mink does not form large territories, possibly due to the abundance of food on the banks of small water bodies. The size of each territory varies according to the availability of food; in areas with water meadows with little food, the home range is , though it is more usual for territories to be . Summer territories are smaller than winter territories. Along shorelines, the length of a home range varies from , with a width of .

The European mink has both a permanent burrow and temporary shelters. The former is used all year except during floods, and is located no more than from the water&#x27;s edge. The construction of the burrow is not complex, often consisting of one or two passages in diameter and in length, leading to a nest chamber measuring . Nesting chambers are lined with straw, moss, mouse wool and bird feathers. It is more sedentary than the American mink, and will confine itself for long periods in its burrow in very cold weather.

===Reproduction and development===
During the mating season, the sexual organs of the female enlarge greatly and become pinkish-lilac in colour, which is in contrast with the female American mink, whose organs do not change. In the Moscow Zoo, estrus was observed on 22–26 April, with copulation lasting from 15 minutes to an hour. The average litter consists of three to seven kits. At birth, kits weigh about , and grow rapidly, trebling their weight 10 days after birth. They are born blind; the eyes open after 30–31 days. The lactation period lasts 2.0 to 2.5 months, though the kits eat solid food after 20–25 days. They accompany the mother on hunting expeditions at the age of 56–70 days, and become independent at the age 70–84 days.

===Diet===
The European mink has a diverse diet consisting largely of aquatic and riparian fauna. Differences between its diet and that of the American mink are small. Voles are the most important food source, closely followed by crustaceans, frogs and water insects. Fish are an important food source in floodlands, with cases being known of European minks catching fish weighing . The European mink&#x27;s daily food requirement is . In times of food abundance, it caches its food.

==Range and status==
The European mink is mostly restricted to Europe. Its range was widespread in the 19th century, with a distribution extending from northern Spain in the west to the river Ob (just east of the Urals) in the east, and from the Archangelsk region in the north to the northern Caucasus in the south. Over the last 150 years, though, it has severely declined by more than 90% and been extirpated or greatly reduced over most of its former range. The current range includes an isolated population in northern Spain and western France, which is widely disjunct from the main range in Eastern Europe (Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, central regions of European Russia, the Danube Delta in Romania and northwestern Bulgaria). It occurs from sea level to . In Estonia, the European mink population has been successfully re-established on the island of Hiiumaa, and there are plans for repeating the process on the nearby island of Saaremaa.

==Decline==

The earliest actual records of decreases in European mink numbers occurred in Germany, having already become extinct in several areas by the middle of the 18th century. A similar pattern occurred in Switzerland, with no records of minks being published in the 20th century. Records of minks in Austria stopped by the late 18th century. By the 1930s–1950s, the European mink became extinct in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and possibly Bulgaria. In Finland, the main decline occurred in the 1920s-1950s and the species was thought to be extinct in the 1970s, though a few specimens were reported in the 1990s. In Latvia, the European mink was thought to be extinct for years, until a specimen was captured in 1992. In Lithuania, the last specimens were caught in 1978–79. The decline of the European mink in Estonia and Belarus was rapid during the 1980s, with only a few small, fragmented populations in the northeastern regions of both countries being reported in the 1990s. The decline of European mink numbers in Ukraine began in the late 1950s, with now only a few small and isolated populations being reported in the upper courses of the Ukrainian Carpathian rivers. Their numbers in Moldova began to drop very quickly in the 1930s, with the last known population having been confined to the lower course of the River Prut on the Romanian border by the late 1980s. In Romania, the European mink was very common and widely distributed, with 8000–10,000 being captured in 1960. Currently, Romanian mink populations are confined to the Danube Delta. In European Russia, the European mink was common and widespread in the early 20th century, but began to decline during the 1950s–1970s. The core of their range was in the Tver Region, though they began to decline there by the 1990s, which was worsened by a colonisation of the area by the American mink. Between 1981 and 1989, 388 European minks were introduced to two of the Kurile Islands, though by the 1990s, the population there was found to be lower than that originally released. In France and Spain, an isolated range occurs, extending from Brittany to northern Spain. Data from the 1990s indicate the European mink has disappeared from the northern half of this previous range.

===Possible reasons for decline===

====Habitat loss====
Habitat-related declines of European mink numbers may have started during the Little Ice Age, which was further aggravated by human activity. As the European mink is more dependent on wetland habitats than the American species, its decline in Central Europe, Estonia, Finland, Russia, Moldova and Ukraine has been linked to the drainage of small rivers. In mid-19th-century Germany, for example, European mink populations declined in a decade due to expanded land drainage. Although land improvement and river dredging certainly resulted in population decreases and fragmentation, in areas which still maintain suitable river ecosystems, such as Poland, Hungary, the former Czechoslovakia, Finland and Russia, the decline preceded the change in wetland habitats, and may have been caused by extensive agricultural development.

====Overhunting====
The European mink was historically hunted extensively, particularly in Russia, where in some districts, the decline prompted a temporary ban on mink hunting to let the population recover. In the early 20th century, 40–60,000 European minks were caught annually in the Soviet Union, with a record of 75,000 individuals (an estimate which exceeds the modern global European mink population). In Finland, annual mink catches reached 3000 specimens in the 1920s. In Romania, 10,000 minks were caught annually around 1960. However, this reason alone cannot account for the decline in areas where hunting was less intense, such as in Germany.

====Decline of crayfish====
The decline of European crayfish has been proposed as a factor in the drop in mink numbers, as minks are notably absent in the eastern side of the Urals, where crayfish are also absent. The decline in mink numbers has also been linked to the destruction of crayfish in Finland during the 1920s-1940s, when the crustaceans were infected with crayfish plague. The failure of the European mink to expand west to Scandinavia coincides with the gap in crayfish distribution.

====Competition with the American mink and disease====
The American mink was introduced and released in Europe during the 1920s–1930s. The American mink is less dependent on wetland habitats than the European mink and is 20-40% larger. The impact of feral American minks on European mink populations has been explained through the competitive exclusion principle and because the American mink reproduces a month earlier than the European species, and matings between male American minks and female European minks result in the embryos being reabsorbed. Thus, female European minks impregnated by male American minks are unable to reproduce with their conspecifics. Though the presence of the American mink has coincided with the decline of European mink numbers in Belarus and Estonia, the decline of the European mink in some areas preceded the introduction of the American mink by many years, and there are areas in Russia where the American species is absent, though European mink populations in these regions are still declining.

Diseases spread by the American mink can also account for the decline. Twenty-seven helminth species are recorded to infest the European mink, consisting of 14 trematodes, two cestodes and 11 nematodes. The mink is also vulnerable to pulmonary filariasis, krenzomatiasis and skrjabingylosis. In the Leningrad and Pskov Oblasts, 77.1% of European minks were found to be infected with skrjabingylosis.

====Hybridisation and competition with the European polecat====

In the early 20th century, northern Europe underwent a warm climatic period which coincided with an expansion of the range of the European polecat. The European mink possibly was gradually absorbed by the polecat due to hybridisation. Also, competition with the polecat has greatly increased, due to landscape change favouring the polecat. There is one record of a polecat attacking a mink and dragging it to its burrow.

Polecat-mink hybrids are termed &quot;khor&#x27;-tumak&quot; by furriers and &quot;khonorik&quot; by fanciers. Such hybridisation is very rare in the wild, and typically only occurs where European minks are declining. A polecat-mink hybrid has a poorly defined facial mask, yellow fur on the ears, grey-yellow underfur and long, dark brown guard hairs. Fairly large, the males attain the peak sizes known for European polecats (weighing and measuring in length), and females are much larger than female European minks (weighing and measuring in length). The majority of polecat-mink hybrids have skulls bearing greater similarities to those of polecats than to minks. Hybrids can swim well like minks and burrow for food like polecats. They are very difficult to tame and breed, as males are sterile, though females are fertile. The first captive polecat-mink hybrid was created in 1978 by Soviet zoologist Dr. Dmitry Ternovsky of Novosibirsk. Originally bred for their fur (which was more valuable than that of either parent species), the breeding of these hybrids declined as European mink populations decreased. Studies on the behavioural ecology of free-ranging polecat-mink hybrids in the upper reaches of the Lovat River indicate the hybrids will stray from aquatic habitats more readily than pure minks, and will tolerate both parent species entering their territories, though the hybrid&#x27;s larger size (especially the male&#x27;s) may deter intrusion. During the summer period, the diet of wild polecat-mink hybrids is more similar to that of the mink than to the polecat, as they feed predominantly on frogs. During the winter, their diets overlap more with those of polecats, and will eat a larger proportion of rodents than in the summer, though they still rely heavily on frogs and rarely scavenge ungulate carcasses as the polecat does.

====Predation====
Predators of the European mink include the European polecat, the American mink, the golden eagle, large owls and the red fox. Red fox numbers have increased greatly in areas where the wolf and Eurasian lynx have been extirpated, as well as areas where modern forestry is practised. As red foxes are known to prey on mustelids, excessive fox predation on the European mink is a possible factor, though it is improbable to have been a factor in Finland, where fox numbers were low during the early 20th century.

<doc id="890261" wikidata="Q1977484" url="?curid=890261" title="Neocron">
<text>Neocron is a 2002 post-apocalyptic cyberpunk massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG) developed by Reakktor Media GmbH (based in Hannover, Germany) and published by cdv Software Entertainment. It is considered to be the first cyberpunk-genre MMORPG, and is designed to integrate elements of first-person shooter games. It has been called a MMO first-person shooter (MMOFPS), but most consider it a hybrid of MMORPG and first-person shooter. Although &quot;Neocron&quot; is often said to be the first MMOFPS, &quot;WWII Online&quot;, released in 2001, holds the Guinness World Record as the first MMOFPS.

Its 2004 sequel, &quot;Neocron 2: Beyond Dome of York&quot;, was originally slated to be an expansion pack and released separately under a new publisher, 10tacle Studios AG. Following a brief transitional period where &quot;Neocron&quot; players were encouraged to transfer their characters to &quot;Neocron 2&quot;, the &quot;Neocron&quot; servers were closed while the &quot;Neocron 2&quot; servers continue to run to this day.

== Character development ==
The player character may be chosen from four distinct classes. Available are genetically engineered super soldiers, (&quot;GenTank&quot;), the slight, yet dexterous and intelligent &quot;Spy&quot;, the psionically focused and physically underpowered &quot;Psi Monk&quot; as well as the &quot;Private Eye&quot; (PE), commonly referred to as a Jack of All Trades for its ability to use aspects of all the other classes.

Later the player may assign &quot;skill points&quot; (gained from experience) into specific abilities, e.g. Construction, Research, Droning and Rifles. Any character or class can use the most basic forms of these, but to master any one of them requires a large commitment in skill points. Jobs range from the notorious hacker, who dives into the alternate reality of Hacknet, technicians who research or construct items and (especially) weapons, to the common grunt, who fights alongside his clan for the outposts, spread around the wastelands. Jobs are not physically imposed: they are a generalization taken from how skill points are distributed to attributes.

== Storyline ==
The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic 28th century. In the mid-22nd century, tensions rose between an expanded Chinese Empire and a joint European/North American &quot;Federation of the Free World&quot;. The unexplained apparent destruction of the first Chinese interstellar colony ship resulted in China launching devastating nuclear strikes with stealth missiles. In retaliation, the American president gave the command to counter strike with cold fusion long-range missiles. World War III started on February 17, 2143; it lasted less than 6 hours.

It took over three centuries for even the most rudimentary civilization to return. By the mid-26th century two great cities had risen from the ashes, thanks in large part to the &quot;Ceres Project&quot;. Originally an MIT project in the early 21st century aimed at storing every aspect of human knowledge on holodisk, it had been taken over by the American military in response to the murder of the project leader.

500 years later, both cities are now but shadows of their former selves: Neocron is diminished thanks to a succession of coups d&#x27;état as well as a mass exodus to Irata III, a colony 80 light years away formed by the missing Chinese colony ship, and Dome of York suffers from losing a devastating war with Neocron.

== Reception ==
&quot;Neocron&quot; received generally mixed reviews. While some reviewers praised the first-person shooter style interface as &quot;intuitive&quot; or &quot;innovative&quot;, others describe combat in &quot;Neocron&quot; as being &quot;dull&quot; or not at all revolutionary.

<text>Konstantin Konstantinovich Rokossovsky (Russian: Константин Константинович (Ксаверьевич) Рокоссовский; ; 21 December 1896 – 3 August 1968) was a Soviet and Polish general who served as a top commander in the Red Army during World War II and achieved the ranks of Marshal of the Soviet Union and Marshal of Poland. He also served as Defence Minister of Poland from 1949 to 1956.

Rokossovsky was born to a Polish noble family in Warsaw in present-day Poland, then part of the Russian Empire, or according to other sources in Velikiye Luki in present-day Russia. He served in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I, and in 1918, joined the Red Army and fought with distinction during the Russian Civil War. Rokossovsky rose to hold senior Red Army commands by 1937, when he fell victim to Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge and was branded a traitor, imprisoned and tortured. After Soviet failures in the Winter War, Rokossovsky was released from prison in 1940 and returned to command of an army corps.

Following Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Rokossovsky played key roles in the Battle of Smolensk and defense of Moscow, where he led the 16th Army to victory. He was commander of the front that defeated the Axis at the Battle of Stalingrad in early 1943, and that summer played a vital role in the Battle of Kursk. In 1944, Rokossovsky was instrumental in planning and executing parts of Operation Bagration, and was promoted to Marshal of the Soviet Union that June. His 1st Belorussian Front reached the outskirts of Warsaw by July 1944, when its command was transferred to Georgy Zhukov. Rokossovsky commanded the 2nd Belorussian Front during the Vistula–Oder Offensive into Germany and final victory.

After the war, Rokossovsky was the commander of the Soviet forces in Poland from 1945 to 1949, when he was given the title of Marshal of Poland and became the Defence Minister of the newly-established Polish People&#x27;s Republic. He also served as deputy chairman of its Council of Ministers from 1952 to 1954. After being forced out of his post in 1956 when Władysław Gomułka became leader during the Polish October, Rokossovsky returned to the Soviet Union, where he lived out the rest of his life until his death in 1968.

==Early life==

Konstanty Ksaweriewicz Rokossowski (Konstantin Ksaveryevich Rokossovsky) was born in Velikiye Luki; or in Warsaw, then part of Congress Poland under Russian rule; or in the village of Telekhany, Brest Region in modern Belarus (then the Russian Empire). His family had moved to Warsaw following the appointment of his father as the inspector of the Warsaw Railways. The Rokossovsky family were members of the Polish nobility (of the Oksza coat of arms), and over generations had produced many cavalry officers. But Konstantin&#x27;s father, Ksawery Wojciech Rokossowski, worked as a civil railway official in the Russian Empire. His mother, Antonina Ovsyannikova, was Russian and a teacher. 

Orphaned at 14, Rokossovsky started working in a stocking factory. In 1911, at age 15, he became an apprentice stonemason. Much later in his life, the government of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic used this fact for propaganda, claiming that Rokossovsky had helped to build Warsaw&#x27;s Poniatowski Bridge. 

When Rokossovsky enlisted in the Imperial Russian Army at the start of the First World War, his patronymic &quot;Ksaveryevich&quot; was Russified to &quot; Konstantinovich&quot;. This was easier for his fellow troops to pronounce who were in the 5th Kargopol Dragoon Regiment.

== Early military career ==

On joining the Kargopolsky 5th Dragoon Regiment, Rokossovsky soon showed himself a talented soldier and leader. He served in the cavalry throughout the war, ending with the rank of a junior non-commissioned officer. He was wounded twice during the war and awarded the Cross of St George. In 1917, he joined the Bolshevik Party. Soon thereafter, he entered the ranks of the Red Army.

During the Russian Civil War he commanded a cavalry squadron of the Kargopolsky Red Guards Cavalry Detachment in the campaigns against the White Guard armies of Aleksandr Kolchak in the Urals. In November 1919, he was wounded in the shoulder there by an opposing officer whom he later killed when his cavalry overran an enemy headquarters. Rokossovsky received Soviet Russia&#x27;s highest military decoration at the time, the Order of the Red Banner.

In 1921, he commanded the 35th Independent Cavalry Regiment stationed in Irkutsk and played an important role in bringing Damdin Sükhbaatar, the founder of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic, to power. 

Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, a legendary &quot;White Russian&quot; general, adventurer and mystic, allegedly believed he was the reincarnation of Genghis Khan and had driven Chinese occupying forces out of Mongolia in 1920. He set himself up as dictator in Outer Mongolia. The next summer, when Ungern-Sternberg moved to capture the border town of Troitskosavsk, he appeared headed north and threatened to cut off the Soviet far east from the rest of the Soviet Union. Rokossovsky quickly moved south from Irkutsk and met up with allied Sükhbaatar Mongol forces; together the units defeated Urgern-Sternberg&#x27;s army, which retreated in disarray after a two-day engagement. Rokossovsky was again wounded, this time in the leg. The combined Mongol and Soviet forces soon thereafter captured Ulaanbaatar.
Rokossovsky met his future wife in Mongolia: Julia Barminan was a high school teacher who was fluent in four languages and who had studied Greek mythology. They married in 1923. Their daughter Ariadna was born in 1925. 

In 1924 and 1925 Rokossovsky attended the Leningrad Higher Cavalry School, where he first met Georgy Zhukov. He was reassigned to Mongolia, where he was a trainer for the Mongolian People&#x27;s Army. Soon after, while serving in the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army under Vasily Blyukher, he took part in the Russo-Chinese Eastern Railroad War of 1929–1930. The Soviet Union intervened to return the Chinese Eastern Railway to joint Chinese and Soviet administration, after Chinese warlord Zhang Xueliang of the Republic of China attempted to seize complete control of the railway.

It was in the early 1930s that Rokossovsky&#x27;s military career first became closely intertwined those of Semyon Timoshenko and Georgy Zhukov: when Rokossovsky was the commander of the 7th Samara Cavalry Division, Timoshenko served as his superior Corps commander and Zhukov was a brigade commander under Rokossovsky in his division. Both became principal actors in his life during World War II, where he served directly under each at different times. Rokossovsky was noted for having a rivalry with Zhukov throughout World War II. He commented on Zhukov&#x27;s character in an official report :

Has a strong will. Decisive and firm. Often demonstrates initiative and skillfully applies it. Disciplined. Demanding and persistent in his demands. A somewhat ungracious and not sufficiently sympathetic person. Rather stubborn. Painfully proud. In professional terms well trained. Broadly experienced as a military leader... Absolutely cannot be used in staff or teaching jobs because constitutionally he hates them.

Rokossovsky was among the first to realize the potential of armoured assault. He was an early supporter of the creation of a strong armoured corps for the Red Army, as championed by Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky in his theory of &quot;deep operations&quot;.

===Purge and rehabilitation===

Rokossovsky held senior commands until August 1937 when he became caught up in Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge and was accused of being a spy. His association with the cutting-edge methods of Marshal Tukhachevsky may have been the cause of his conflict with more traditional officers such as Semyon Budenny, who still favoured cavalry tactics over Tukhachevsky&#x27;s mass armour theories, but few historians believe that the purge of the Red Army was solely a dispute over policy. Most attribute the purges to political and military rivalries as well.

Some officers were swept up on suspicion due to past associations; in Rokossovky&#x27;s case his Polish ancestry, association with the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army, and the intrigues surrounding Marshal Vasily Blyukher may have been enough to cause his arrest. Blyukher was arrested shortly after Rokossovsky and died in prison without &#x27;confessing&#x27;. 

Rokossovsky, however, survived. He was variously accused of having links to Polish and Japanese intelligence and having committed acts of sabotage under Article 58, section 14; &quot;conscious non-execution or deliberately careless execution of defined duties&quot;, a section added to the penal code in June 1937.

The charges against Rokossovsky stemmed from the case of the &quot;Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Military Organization of the 11th Mechanized Corps&quot;. Rokossovsky was implicated after the arrest of Corps Commander Kasyan Chaykovsky who, like Rokossovsky, served in the Far East in the early 1930s. The Intelligence Chief of the Transbaikal Military District accused Rokossovsky of meeting with Colonel Komatsubara, the head of the Japanese military mission in Harbin in 1932, when he was commander of the 15th Cavalry Division in Trans-Baikal. Rokossovsky did not dispute the fact of the meeting but said that it was to resolve issues regarding Chinese prisoners. Material charges against him claimed various acts of negligence of command that were interpreted as deliberate acts of sabotage (known as &quot;wrecking&quot;), such as allowing the quarters of his division to become slovenly, failing to conduct training, and leading his division out into bad weather causing losses of horses and encouraging sickness among his troops.

When Rokossovsky was arrested by the NKVD, his wife and daughter were sent into internal exile. His wife Julia took odd jobs to support her and their daughter, but she was repeatedly fired when it was discovered that her husband had been arrested as a &quot;traitor&quot;.

V. V. Rachesky, a cell mate of Rokossovsky, wrote in his memoirs that Rokossovsky blamed the persecution of innocent people on the NKVD. He thought the officer to be &quot;naive&quot;, refusing to acknowledge Stalin&#x27;s role in creating the treacherous environment. He described Rokossovsky&#x27;s refusal to sign a false confession:

Those who refused to sign a false statement were beaten up, as long as the false statement was not signed. There were steadfast people who stubbornly did not sign. But there were relatively few. K. K. Rokossovsky, as he sat with me in the same cell, did not sign a false statement. But he was a brave and strong man, tall and broad-shouldered. He too was beaten.

His grandson, Colonel Konstantin Rokossovsky Vilevich, later said that his grandfather escaped execution because he refused to sign a false statement and proved to the court that the officer who his NKVD accusers claimed had denounced him had in fact been killed in 1920 during the civil war:

The evidence was based on the testimony of Adolph Yushkevich, a colleague of my grandfather in the Civil War. But my grandfather knew very well that Yushkevich died in Perekop. He said that he would sign [a confession] if Adolph was brought for a confrontation. They looked for Yushkevich and found that he had died long before. 
Alexander Solzhenitsyn reports that Rokossovsky endured two mock shooting events, where he was taken out at night by a firing squad as if to be executed, but then returned to prison. Living relatives say that Svetlana Pavlovna, wife of Marshal Kazakov, confirmed that Rokossovsky sustained severe injuries, including broken and denailed fingers and cracked ribs, in addition to the psychological torture of mock shooting ceremonies. Rokossovsky never discussed his trial and imprisonment with his family. He told his daughter Ariadne that since then, he always kept a gun, because he would not surrender alive if they came to arrest him again. He was reinstated in the Communist Party in 1940. 

In his famous &quot;secret speech&quot; of 1956, Nikita Khrushchev, spoke about the purges and was likely referring implicitly to Rokossovsky when he stated, &quot;suffice to say that those of them who managed to survive, despite severe tortures to which they were subjected in the prisons, have from the first war days shown themselves real patriots and heroically fought for the glory of the Fatherland&quot;.

== World War II ==
After his trial Rokossovsky was sent to the Kresty Prison in Leningrad, where he remained until he was released without explanation on 22 March 1940. His release coincided with a relaxation of the Great Purge ushered in by the execution of NKVD chief Nikolay Yezhov on 4 February 1940, who was replaced by Lavrentiy Beria.

Semyon Timoshenko, who had been named People&#x27;s Commissar for Defence of the Soviet Union after the debacle of the Winter War and was in urgent need of experienced officers to fill command posts for the rapidly expanding Soviet army, returned Rokossovsky to the command of the 5th Cavalry Corps at the rank of colonel. Subsequently, the 5th Cavalry Corps participated in the occupation of Bessarabia and he was soon promoted to the rank of a major general and given the command of the 9th Mechanized Corps, as part of M.I. Potapov&#x27;s 5th Army under Mikhail Kirponos, commander of the Kiev Military District, which would later be renamed the Southwestern Front at the outbreak of hostilities with Germany.

===1941: Operation Barbarossa; Dubno, Smolensk and Moscow===

====Battle of Dubno====

When Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941 Rokossovsky was serving as the commander of the 9th Mechanized Corps with the 35th and 20th Tank Divisions, and the 131st Motorized Division under his command.

He was immediately engaged in the early tank battles that raged around the Lutsk–Dubno–Brody triangle, also known as the Battle of Brody — an early Soviet counter-attack that was the most significant Soviet tank operation of the early stages of Operation Barbarossa.

The battle involved a large scale attack involving five mechanized corps aimed at penetrating the German line in the direction of Lublin based on a plan developed before hostilities commenced. Orders for the attack from Zhukov were met with little enthusiasm from the Southwestern Front staff that wanted to maintain a defensive posture. Nonetheless, the attack proceeded. The operation met with numerous difficulties in mobilization, coordination, communication, transportation and execution but scored some initial successes, which were parried by the quick action of Von Rundstedt&#x27;s Army Group South in Ukraine and ended in the destruction of most of the participating Soviet forces.

Upon receiving his orders Rokossovsky, whose divisions were stationed far to the rear of the frontier, had to commandeer trucks from the local reserve to carry munitions, and mount some of his infantry on tanks while the rest were forced to walk, splitting his forces. As a consequence, his forces were behind schedule and only an advanced guard were able to meet the 26 June &quot;jump off&quot;, and entered the fray piecemeal. His orders were to move forward and take up positions around Lutsk north of the town of Dubno in co-ordination with the 19th Mechanized Corps under N. V. Feklenko, and attack south-west, while the Mechanized Corps of the 6th Army attacked northward from Brody to meet them, with the intent of cutting off the advance of the 11th Panzer Division east.

On 25 June, Rokossovsky&#x27;s 131st Motorized were quickly driven out of their position at Lutsk by the 14th Panzer Division, but the 35th and 20th Tank divisions were able to cobble together advance forces to cut the Lutsk–Dubno road, even though their full force had not yet arrived on the battlefield. On the same day elements of the 19th Mechanized Corps, operating to his east out of Rovno, had succeeded in temporarily driving the rearguard of the 11th Panzer Division from Dubno, cutting off its advance units. In response the 13th Panzer Division attacked south from Lutsk the next day clearing Rokossovsky&#x27;s forces from the road and allowing German infantry to recapture Dubno, while it drove off the 19th Mechanized and captured Rovno in Rokossovsky&#x27;s rear.

As German resistance stiffened, Mikhail Kirponos, the commander of the Southwestern Front, issued instructions to cease offensive operations that were immediately countermanded by his superior, Chief of General Staff G.K. Zhukov, who was visiting the headquarters. Zhukov insisted that the counter-attack continue against any counterarguments. As a result, Rokossovsky&#x27;s command was bombarded with conflicting orders. According to Lieutenant-General Dmitry Ryabyshev, Rokossovsky &quot;expressed no ambivalence about the proposed counteroffensive&quot; and refused a direct order, effectively ending the dispute between Zhukov and Kirponos:

Because of this, Ryabyshev&#x27;s 8th Mechanized, which had also scored some early successes operating out of Brody, was in effect continuing to attack from the south with the expectation of support from Rokossovsky, who had stood down his forces, and did not arrive from the north. Neither were aware of this fact, because there was no available direct communication between the individual corps, an example of how the endemic communication problems helped foil the Soviet efforts.

Throughout the next days, Rokossovsky&#x27;s forces put considerable pressure on the Germans at Lutsk and tried to recapture Rovno in their rear, while stopping the advance of the 14th Panzer by ambushing them with 85mm anti-tank guns at close range and with good effect. He observed in his memoirs that &quot;the terrain off-road was wooded and swampy, keeping the German advance to the road. The artillery Regiment of the 20th Tank division deployed its newly issued 85mm guns to cover the road and with direct fire repulsed the advancing Panzers.

The battles around Lutsk, Dubno and Brody fought by the 8th, 9th and 19th Mechanized Corps were most notable among Soviet operations in the early days of Barbarossa because the Southwestern Front was able to organize active operations, unlike most sectors of the front where the German assault was met with operational paralysis, and bought time to reorganize defense along the line of the old Polish border.

Sporadic attempts were made to close the widening gap between the Soviet 5th and 6th Armies, as the Germans advanced on Kiev, but the Soviet tank forces were but a fraction of their former strength. By 7 July, Rokossovsky&#x27;s 9th Mechanized Corps had been reduced to 64 tanks, out of its original complement of 316.

====Battle of Smolensk====
While Rokossovsky and his fellow Mechanized Corps commanders of the 5th and 6th Army had been interdicting Army Group South&#x27;s advance in Ukraine, complete disorder and panic gripped the Soviet forces in Byelorussia, where the disabling impact of poor organization, logistics and communications were exponentially greater. The Red Army collapsed under the well coordinated attack of Field Marshal von Bock&#x27;s Army Group Center. Within seventeen days, during the Battle of Białystok–Minsk three quarters of D.G. Pavlov&#x27;s Western Front was put out of action; dispersed, captured or killed. Of its initial complement of 625,000 soldiers, 290,000 were taken prisoner and 1,500 guns and 2,500 tanks were captured or destroyed. By 30 June the Germans had reached the approaches of the Dnepr river bend where the river departs from its east–west flow, and heads south. The way was open to the strategically important city of Smolensk, where Marshal Simon Timoshenko was reassembling the shattered Western Front on a new defense line.
The Battle of Smolensk commenced on 10 July when Army Group Center began advancing on a broad front to the north and south banks of the Dnepr river, just beyond the bend where it begins its southward flow.

The 9th Army attacked north-east toward Veliki Luki. The 3rd Panzer Group under General Hermann Hoth struck east at Vitebsk and then attacked along the land bridge that separates the West Dvina and Dnepr rivers with the aim of enveloping Smolensk from the north. Heinz Guderian&#x27;s 2nd Panzer Group pushed toward Smolensk directly through Orsha and bypassed Mogilev with the ultimate objective of making a deep penetration far to the rear of the Soviet front line beyond Yelnya and toward Moscow.

Despite his insubordination during the Battle of Dubno, Rokossovsky was ordered to Moscow on 13 July to take command of the remnants of the 4th Army where he was to serve under Marshal Timoshenko who had replaced the disgraced Pavlov as the Western Front commander on 2 July, shortly after he and the majority of his staff had been tried and shot in the wake of the disaster at the frontier.

On 15 July, the same day that Rokossovsky was restored to the rank of lieutenant general, the rank he had held previous to his arrest, Major General Funck&#x27;s 7th Panzer Division from the 3rd Panzer Group arrived at Yartsevo behind Smolensk. The next day motorized infantry from the 2nd Panzer Group forced most of the Soviet defenders from Smolensk, reducing the gap between 2nd and 3rd Panzer Groups to less than 20 kilometers. The 16th, 19th and 20th Soviet armies were threatened with impending encirclement and now strung out along the north bank of the river contained in a triangle between Vitebsk to the north-west, Yartsevo to the north-east, and Smolensk to the South.

With his front rapidly deteriorating Timoshenko released Rokossovsky from 4th Army (a command he had assumed in name only) and gave him the task of assembling a stopgap formation to be called &quot;Group Yartsevo&quot; that would deal with the emergency presented by the sudden appearance of the 7th Panzer at Yartsevo. This ad hoc operational group was to defend the bridgeheads of the Vop river, a tributary of the Dnepr, and prevent the southern and northern wings of the Panzer envelopment from converging at the Dnepr.

Collapse seemed imminent. Stalin, unmoved, reiterated his demand to Timoshenko that Smolensk should not be surrendered and called the &quot;evacuation attitude&quot; of the front-line commanders of the besieged armies criminally &quot;treasonous&quot;. Rather than retreat, Timoshenko&#x27;s armies would stand their ground and attempt to recapture Smolensk.

&quot;Group Yartsevo&quot; was in theory a large army-sized formation, but when Rokossovsky arrived at Timoshenko&#x27;s headquarters on the evening of the 17th, he was in fact in charge of his own small staff, two quad anti-aircraft machine guns mounted on trucks and a radio van. At first, Rokossovsky had to resort to pulling together a fighting group from reserve units and retreating stragglers, but over the coming days it became a more substantial force. Retreating regiments and divisions from the 44th Rifle Corps filtered out of the Smolensk pocket and were transferred to his command and fresh forces arrived from the reserve—the 107th Tank Division (formerly the 69th Motorized Division from the Trans-Baikal Military District) and the 101st Tank Division equipped with 220 outdated but functional tanks.

What commenced was a confusing seesaw battle for control of Smolensk that saw portions of the city change hands several times over the next week, while Rokossovsky&#x27;s group held the back door open and harassed the advanced German panzer formations.

Day by day, Rokossovsky&#x27;s forces became stronger. As the Smolensk pocket deflated under German pressure Rokossovsky was able to press into service retreating soldiers and formations that slipped out of the pocket and employed them reinforcing the perimeter of the Yartsevo corridor. Eventually, the 38th Rifle Division was handed over to Rokossovsky when Timoshenko rationalized the command of the shrinking formations in the Smolensk pocket by disbanding Ivan Konev&#x27;s 19th Army.

The Germans were faced with the dilemma of both containing the encircled armies, and dealing with Rokossovsky&#x27;s burgeoning forces to their east. The 7th Panzer was soon joined by the 12th Panzer at Yartsevo, while the 20th held down their northern flank. With so many Panzer divisions tied down in defensive position containing Soviet activity both inside and outside of the pocket, much of the offensive punch of the Panzer Groups was blunted.

Even though &quot;Group Yartsevo&quot; had managed to halt the advance of Hoth&#x27;s 3rd Panzer Group at Yartsevo, Guderian&#x27;s 2nd Panzer Group continued to advance south of the Dnepr on Rokossovsky&#x27;s left flank, becoming a more tangible threat with each passing day. On 18 July, Guderian&#x27;s 10th Panzer Division entered the town of Yelnya 70 km south of Yartsevo and captured it on the 20th.

But on 19 July, German operational objectives for Smolensk changed when Hitler issued Führer Directive 33, ordering the Wehrmacht to temporarily cease its drive on Moscow, so that it could wheel south and finish off the Soviet defenders holding onto Kiev in Ukraine. As a result, Guderian&#x27;s intended deep penetration was operationally obsolete, and Field Marshal von Bock became intent on mopping up the Soviet defenders at Smolensk so that the Panzer Groups could be released to Army Group South. Impatient with Guderian&#x27;s slow going, Von Bock urged Guderian to drive north and close the Yartsevo corridor. In anticipation of this development, Rokossovsky had deployed the 107th Tank division to hold the area immediately south of Dnepr, and when the 10th Panzer undertook an unsupported attack northward toward Dorogobuzh from Yelnya, it was repulsed after three days of heavy fighting. The situation temporarily stabilized.

On 20 July, Zhukov ordered a general counterattack with the aim of relieving the encircled armies, and beginning on 21 July attacks began along the entire front, and continued for a number of days in an uncoordinated fashion. Meanwhile, the defenders in the pocket increased their efforts to recapture Smolensk. Attacks were made from the south against the flank of Guderian&#x27;s advanced forces at Yelnya and Roslavl, and north of Yartsevo against Hoth&#x27;s 2nd Panzer Group. Deep cavalry penetrations were made behind the German front behind Mogilev, disrupting logistics. Uncoordinated as the attacks were they had the effect of distracting the German advance for several days as intense battles took place increasing casualties on both sides. On the 24th Rokossovky&#x27;s temporarily drove Funk&#x27;s 7th Panzer from Yartsevo.

Unsupported by infantry the Wehrmacht advanced Panzer formations were taking inordinate casualties. To make further headway, both Hoth and Guderian needed to bring infantry forward to disentangle their mobile forces from their containment operations, and free them for attack, slowing the pace of advance.

By 25 July, Guderian had been able to free his considerable tank forces from defensive duties, and mobilized the 17th Panzer Division for a concerted effort to advance north and clear Rokossovsky from his tenuous position, but the 17th Panzer was still unable to reach the Dnepr and finally close the pocket. Nonetheless, under attack from north and south Rokossovsky was unable to prevent Hoth&#x27;s 20th Motorized Infantry from capturing bridgeheads over the Dnepr on the 27th, sealing the pocket. The encircled armies fought intense breakout battles, and on the 28th Timoshenko ordered Rokossovsky to reopen the corridor by recapturing the bridgeheads. While he was unable to regain control of the river crossings, the 101st Tank Division recaptured Yartsevo on the 29th and held it for a few critical days.

Despite strenuous efforts over the next week, Rokossovsky was not able to secure a link to the armies in the pocket, but the intense Soviet activity kept the Germans from consolidating their front, allowing elements of the encircled 16th army to effect a breakout. By 4 August the front had stabilized and the defending armies within the pocket ceased resistance or had ceased to exist.

Rokossovsky is credited with slowing the German attack, and holding the Yartsevo corridor open for long enough to prevent the capture and destruction of a considerable numbers of Soviet troops. The broader consequences of Soviet resistance at Smolensk are evident in the Führer Directive No. 34, issued on 30 July 1941:

====Battle of Moscow====

In September 1941 Stalin personally appointed Rokossovsky to the command of 16th Army. He was ordered to defend the approaches to Moscow, and was now under the direct command of General Georgy Zhukov, his former subordinate. The 16th Army (later renamed the 11th Guards Army) played a key role in the Battle of Moscow when it was deployed along the main axis of the German advance along the Volokolamsk Highway that was a central junction of the bitter fighting during the German winter offensive of 1941 (Operation Typhoon), as well as the subsequent Soviet counter-attack of 1941–42.

On 18 November, during the last-ditch efforts of the Wehrmacht to encircle Moscow in 1941, General Rokossovsky, his soldiers under heavy pressure from Erich Hoepner&#x27;s 4th Panzer Group, asked his immediate superior, Zhukov, if he could withdraw the 16th Army to more advantageous positions. Zhukov categorically refused. Rokossovsky went over Zhukov&#x27;s head, and spoke directly to Marshal Boris Shaposhnikov, now Chief of the General Staff in Zhukov&#x27;s place; reviewing the situation Shaposhnikov immediately ordered a withdrawal. Zhukov reacted at once. He revoked the order of the superior officer, and ordered Rokossovsky to hold the position. In the immediate aftermath, Rokossovsky&#x27;s army was pushed aside and the 3rd and 4th Panzer Groups were able to gain strategically important positions north of Moscow, but this marked the high point of the German advance upon Moscow. Throughout Operation Typhoon, Rokossovsky&#x27;s 16th army had taken the brunt of the German effort to capture Moscow.

====1942: Operation Fall Blau====

In March 1942 Rokossovsky was badly injured by a piece of shrapnel. It was widely rumored that Valentina Serova was a mistress of Rokossovsky during this time. While it is true that Serova, working as a hospital volunteer, met Rokossovsky several times while he was recovering from his wound, it is not acknowledged they were lovers. Evidence for their close relationship was found in the accounts of frontline soldiers.

Rokossovsky also had another mistress at this time, Dr. Lt. Galina Talanova, with whom he had a daughter in 1945. After two months in a Moscow hospital Rokossovsky was reunited briefly with the 16th Army.

=====Retreat to the Don=====

During 1942 the Wehrmacht commenced &quot;Operation Fall Blau&quot; and switched the axis of their offensive from Moscow and attacked southward into the eastern Ukraine towards the Don–Volga river line, Rostov, Voronezh, Stalingrad and the Caucasus beyond. There the Germans hoped to secure fresh supplies of oil to fuel their armies. Unlike the early days of 1941 the stiffening Soviet army maintained relatively good order in retreat, backing up along a defensive line along the Don river.

On 13 July 1942 Rokossovsky was given his first operational level command, a sign of his growing stature. The battles of Smolensk and Moscow had by no measure resulted in Red Army victory, but the front-line formations under his command were central to frustrating the Wehrmacht efforts to achieve the same and this was most likely reflected in Stalin&#x27;s decision to make him commander of the Bryansk Front, where Stavka expected the main line of German attack to be renewed against Moscow in 1942—Rokossovsky was a trusted officer who could be counted on in a tight squeeze.

As the German offensive turned south, and toward Voronezh, the Bryansk sector turned out to be so quiet that Stavka shuffled the 38th Army to General Vatutin&#x27;s Voronezh Front, during the heated Battle of Voronezh, where the Germans attempted to ford the Don River, and compromise the entire Soviet Don River defense. Rokossovsky recounts in his memoirs that during that summer Stalin phoned him personally to ask &quot;whether I did not find the situation too dull for my liking&quot; and was then recalled to Moscow to undertake command of a new operation:

The plan was to concentrate a strong force (no less than three combined armies and several armoured corps) on the flank of the enemy occupying the country between the Don and the Volga with the purpose of counter-attacking south and south-east from the vicinity of Serafimovich.

Subsequent events delayed the attack and it was shelved, only later to be resurrected as &quot;Operation Uranus&quot; with Vatutin playing the lead role, however Walsh asserts that Rokossovsky being originally selected to lead the attack &quot;was symptomatic of his standing and the importance of his location as an indicator of significant, impending Soviet operations.&quot;

=====Operation Uranus=====

By the fall of 1942 the German army had pulled up along the new Soviet defense at the Don and Volga rivers, centered at Stalingrad, and had broken through south of Rostov toward the strategic oil centers of Tbilisi and Baku. Stalin was determined that Stalingrad should not fall, and the Red Army was given strict orders to hold the city at any cost. The Battle of Stalingrad became a struggle for control of the city that drew in combatants from both sides in brutal house-to-house fighting.
On 28 September 1942, at Zhukov&#x27;s urging, Rokossovsky was given overall command of the 65th Army (4th Tank Army), 24th Army and 66th Army, that were brought together as the Don Front as part of Stalin&#x27;s much criticized reorganization of the Southern Front in preparation for the planned Soviet counterattack at Stalingrad: &quot;Operation Uranus&quot;. This put Rokossovky&#x27;s armies directly opposite the XI, VIII and XIV Corps of the 6th Army, including the 16th Panzer and 14th Panzer divisions, all of which were destroyed in the ensuing battle.

With German forces heavily engaged at Stalingrad and spread thinly due to their deep penetrations into the Caucasus, the Wehrmacht was increasingly reliant on their Romanian and Italian allies to cover the flanks of their extended line, on the north along the Don, and to the south along the Volga. &quot;Operation Uranus&quot; kicked off on 17 November with the intention of making a double envelopment of Paulus&#x27;s men at Stalingrad by breaking through the flanks. The Southwestern Front commanded by General Vatutin quickly overwhelmed the 3rd Romanian Army just to the north of Rokossovsky&#x27;s Don Front, while Yeryomenko&#x27;s Stalingrad Front began their own attack just south of Stalingrad. Rokossovsky&#x27;s Don Front played a largely subordinate role in the main attack, but the 65th Army supported Vatutin&#x27;s attack from the north by outflanking the left extreme of the German line where it met the Romanian 3rd Army, while the 24th and 66th squeezed the German defenders—pinning them in place as the pincers of the main attacks rapidly enveloped them.

In less than a week, in the face of deteriorating weather and blizzard conditions, the Soviet forces had sealed the gap behind Stalingrad, and had begun to reinforce their investment around the city in order to prevent an attempted escape. No organized effort was made by the 6th Army to break out, and &quot;Operation Winter Storm&quot;, a mid December German effort to relieve the encircled army, failed to break the Soviet defenses. Soon after, the Soviets launched &quot;Operation Little Saturn&quot; and completely consolidated their position.

=====Stalingrad=====
On 28 December Stalin gave Rokossovsky the task of mopping up the Stalingrad pocket. He had at his disposal roughly 212,000 men, 6,500 guns, 2,500 tanks, and 300 aircraft, to be used against an assortment of 200,000 defenders short on food, fuel, and ammunition, including Soviet &quot;Hiwis&quot;, Romanians and Germans; in one example, nearly half the 6th Army&#x27;s 297th Infantry Division fighting force were Soviets, however its artillery detachment was rationed to one and a half shells a day. On 8 January 1943, Rokossovsky ordered a cease-fire and sent a delegation to offer terms of surrender but Paulus did not respond, and resistance continued for the better part of the month.

On 10 January, the Don Front launched &quot;Operation Ring&quot; to reduce the Stalingrad pocket beginning with a 55-minute barrage from 7000 rocket launchers, artillery and mortars. The defenders fought tenaciously, even as their lines slowly collapsed, causing the Don Front 26,000 casualties, and destroying half its tanks in the first three days of the operation.

On 15 January Rokossovsky was promoted to the rank of colonel general.

On 16 January the main airfield used to supply the beleaguered 6th Army fell, and then after a pause of a few days, the offensive was renewed capturing the last operational airfield and finally driving the German back into the city proper on 22 January.

On that same day General Paulus asked Hitler for permission to surrender but was refused. On 26 January the Soviets had broken the surrounded Germans into two pockets, and on 31 January, the southern pocket collapsed and Paulus surrendered. Within four days the last significant group of defenders surrendered to Rokossovky&#x27;s command, finally ending the battle that marked the high-water mark of the German advance during the Soviet–German war.

====1943: Kursk====

After the victory at Stalingrad the Russian forces advanced to a position that created a bulge 150 km deep and 250 km wide into the German line, around the city of Kursk. This subsequently became known as the Kursk Salient. Rokossovsky&#x27;s command was moved to the north of the salient and was re-designated as a new front, which was twinned with the Voronezh Front, holding the south approaches.

In February 1943 Rokossovsky wrote in his diary: &quot;I&#x27;m appointed commander of the Central Front. It means that Stalin has entrusted me to play the key part in the summer Kursk campaign.&quot;

Both the Red Army and the Wehrmacht prepared to make a decisive offensive in the summer of 1943 at Kursk. The Germans planned to drive two thrusts, one through each flank of the salient, and unite them at Kursk in order to cut off substantial Soviet forces, recover from the strategic loss at Stalingrad, and curtail further Russian advance. The Russians, alert to the coming attack, put their offensive plans aside and prepared for defense in depth with mass antitank units in prepared positions.

In late June one German bomb load in a night raid hit Rokossovsky&#x27;s HQ, and he escaped only because on a whim he had decided to set up his signals group in the officers&#x27; mess. After that, Central Front HQ went underground in a bunker in the garden of a former monastery.
The German offensive, code named &quot;Operation Citadel&quot;, was originally scheduled to begin in May but the attack was delayed several times in order to bring up fresh Panzer formations equipped with Tiger I&#x27;s and Panther tanks and their latest assault guns. These delays allowed for even greater Soviet preparation. It was not until early July that the Wehrmacht operations in the Kursk salient got underway.

The resulting battle was one of the largest tank battles in World War II, with massive losses of men and equipment on both sides. As the commander of the Central Front, Rokossovsky&#x27;s force was faced with a determined attack by the Army Group Center&#x27;s 9th Army under Walter Model, including several tank formations augmented with the newest Tiger I tanks in battalion strength. Rokossovsky for his part had organized his defenses into three defensive belts. After the initial German assault, Rokossovsky ordered counter-attacks but the Soviet armor suffered badly in the face of the new German heavy Tiger tanks, and he went back on the defensive. Despite this, the Germans were soon bogged down in the heavily mined terrain and antitank defenses, and Rokossovsky was able to reinforce.

The Central Front was then renamed 1st Belorussian Front, which Rokossovsky commanded during the Soviet advance through Byelorussia (Belarus) and into Poland.

====1944: Operation Bagration and the Warsaw Uprising====

During the planning of the major Soviet offensive, Operation Bagration, in 1944, a famous incident occurred that various sources consistently report in slightly different versions. Rokossovsky disagreed with Stalin, who demanded in accordance with Soviet war practice a single break-through of the German frontline. Rokossovsky held firm in his argument for two points of break-through. Stalin ordered Rokossovsky to &quot;go and think it over&quot; three times, but every time he returned and gave the same answer &quot;two break-throughs, comrade Stalin, two break-throughs&quot;. After the third time Stalin remained silent, but walked over to Rokossovsky and put a hand on his shoulder. A tense moment followed as the whole room waited for Stalin to rip the epaulette from Rokossovsky&#x27;s shoulder; instead, Stalin said &quot;Your confidence speaks for your sound judgement&quot;, and ordered the attack to go forward according to Rokossovsky&#x27;s plan.

The battle was successful and Rokossovsky&#x27;s reputation was assured. After crushing German Army Group Centre in Belarus, Rokossovsky&#x27;s armies reached the east bank of the Vistula opposite Warsaw by mid-1944. For these victories he was advanced to the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union. Stalin once said: &quot;I have no Suvorov, but Rokossovsky is my Bagration&quot;.
As Rokossovsky&#x27;s approached the Vistula, the Warsaw Uprising (August–October 1944) broke out in the city, led by the Polish Home Army (AK) on the orders of the Polish government in exile in London. Rokossovsky did not order reinforcement to the insurgents. There has been much speculation about Rokossovsky&#x27;s personal views on this decision. He would always maintain that, with his communications badly stretched and enemy pressure against his northern flank mounting, committing forces to Warsaw would have been disastrous.

In November 1944, Rokossovsky was transferred to the 2nd Belorussian Front, which advanced into East Prussia and then across northern Poland to the mouth of the Oder at Stettin (now Szczecin). On 3 May 1945 he linked up with British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s 2nd Army in Wismar, Germany while the forces of Zhukov and Ivan Konev captured Berlin, ending the war.

In July 1945, he, Zhukov and several other Soviet officers were awarded the Order of the Bath in a ceremony at the Brandenburg Gate, in Berlin.

==Post-war life==

As one of the most prominent Soviet military commanders of the Second World War, Rokossovsky was present at the Victory Parade in Red Square in Moscow in 1945 as a Commanding Officer of the Parade, riding a seal brown stallion named Pole next to Marshal Georgy Zhukov, Inspector of the Parade, on his famous Idol.

After the end of the war Rokossovsky remained in command of Soviet forces in Poland (Northern Group of Forces). Fully four years later, in October 1949 with the establishment of the government under Bolesław Bierut in Poland, Rokossovsky, on Stalin&#x27;s orders, became the Polish Minister of National Defense, with the additional title of Marshal of Poland. Rokossovsky is one of two foreign Marshals to receive the rank of Marshal of Poland, with other being Marshal of France Ferdinand Foch. Together with Rokossovsky, several thousand Soviet officers were placed in charge of almost all Polish military units, either as commanding officers or as advisors.
In 1952 he became deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. Although Rokossovsky was a Pole, he had not lived in Poland for 35 years and most Poles regarded him as a Russian and Soviet emissary in the country. As Rokossovsky himself bitterly put it: &quot;In Russia, they say I&#x27;m a Pole, in Poland they call me Russian&quot;.

Rokossovsky played a key role in the regime&#x27;s suppression of an independent Poland through Stalinization and Sovietization in general, and in the Polish Army in particular. As the &quot;de facto&quot; supreme commander of the Polish Army, he introduced various methods for the suppression of anti-Soviet activity, real or imagined. Among the most notorious were the &quot;labour battalions&quot; of the army, to which all able-bodied men found &quot;socially or politically insecure&quot; or guilty of having their families abroad were drafted. It is estimated that roughly 200,000 men were forced to work in these labour camps in hazardous conditions, often in quarries, coal mines, and uranium mines, and 1,000 died in their first days of &quot;labour&quot;, while tens of thousands became crippled. Other groups targeted by these repressive measures were former soldiers of the pre-war Polish Army as well as the wartime underground Home Army.

In the June 1956 Poznań protests against local working conditions and living standards, as well as the Soviet influence over Poland, Rokossovsky approved an order to send in military units. As a result of this over 10,000 soldiers and 360 tanks crushed the protesters, and at least 74 civilians were killed.

In the wake of the Poznan riots and the &quot;rehabilitation&quot; of the formerly imprisoned communist reformer Władysław Gomułka in 1956, Rokossovsky went to Moscow in a failed attempt to persuade Nikita Khrushchev to use force against the Polish state. However, Gomułka managed to negotiate with the Soviets, and on the new Polish First Secretary&#x27;s insistence Rokossovsky was forced to leave Poland. He returned to the Soviet Union, which restored his Soviet ranks and honours; and in July 1957, following the removal from office of Defence Minister Zhukov, Nikita Khrushchev appointed him Deputy Minister of Defence and commander of the Transcaucasian Military District. In 1958 he became chief inspector of the Ministry of Defence, a post he held until his retirement in April 1962.

Throughout his life, he was fond of hunting – he had a double-barreled IZh-49 12 gauge shotgun and a 20 gauge double-barreled TOZ shotgun made in 1905.

Rokossovsky died on 3 August 1968, of prostate cancer in Moscow, aged 71. His ashes were buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis on Red Square.

<text>J. A. Deane was an American musician, performing sometimes on trombone, but more often on synthesizers and live, real-time sampler.

Deane appeared on the pioneering 1985 live recording of Cobra by John Zorn. He has recorded with Jon Hassell, and has performed extensively with Butch Morris. From 1997 to 2013 he led the Out of Context ensemble, which further explored the language of conduction developed by Butch Morris. Out of Context has released CDs on the Zerx and High Mayhem record labels based out of Albuquerque and Santa Fe, New Mexico, respectively.

&quot;The following list highlights some of his many music-related activities, is taken predominantly from his Web site, and is neither complete nor detailed:&quot;

* Played trombone, alto-flute, clavinet and string synthesizer for Ike and Tina Turner on and around Nutbush City Limits, and for Tina Turner after she and Ike split up.
* Rigged up his trombone with electronics to control analog synths - pre-MIDI – and used tape echo to create a live-looping system.
* Played in the art-punk band Indoor Life, which took him from San Francisco to NYC, which led to him playing samplers and electronics for Jon Hassell.
* With Hassell, started doing something he called &quot;live sampling&quot;, possibly coining the term. Appeared on Hassell&#x27;s landmark album Power Spot.
* Back in San Francisco, played trombone and electronics on three John Zorn albums, with COBRA gaining the most attention.
* Started playing with Butch Morris in the 1980s – trombone, electronics and sampler – including Morris&#x27;s touring trio with Wayne Horvitz in 1986 and throughout the European festival circuit 1988–90.
* Moved to Ribera, NM in 1995 and engaged in a new musical community. Releases include NOMAD (Victo), works for dance for his partner, Colleen Mulvihill (Olympic gymnast, choreographer, dancer). Their partnership lasted 38 years, ending with her death in 2019.
* Coproduced a 10-CD boxed set for Morris called Testament (New World). Performed with Morris and Le Quan Ninh (percussionist) at Berlin&#x27;s 1993 FMP festival, released as Burning Cloud.
* Played lap steel, piano and bass flute in The Bubbadinos, &quot;the world’s worst country band&quot;.
* Recorded the definitive version of Steve Peters&#x27; Webster Cycles
* Developed sound designs for Sam Shepard (Fool for Love), Theatre Grottesco and many more
* Expanding on a vocabulary of hand signals originated by Butch Morris, led the Out of Context ensemble for 15 years, with members spanning Santa Fe and Albuquerque, NM.
* Worked tirelessly to preserve Morris&#x27;s legacy and contributions.

Deane died Friday, July 23, 2021 (Mountain time).

<doc id="890269" wikidata="Q2437291" url="?curid=890269" title="Kinnim">
<text>Kinnim (Hebrew: ) is a tractate in the order of Kodshim in the Mishna. The name, meaning &quot;nests&quot;, refers to the tractate&#x27;s subject matter of errors in bird-offerings. It is the last tractate in the order, because of its shortness (3 chapters) and because it deals with a very rare and unusual area of Jewish law.

The premise of the tractate is the obligatory bird-offering that has to be brought by certain people (for instance Nazirites at the completion of their vow and women after childbirth). The offering consists of a pair of birds, one for a sin-offering and the other for a peace-offering. A common practice was to purchase a cage with two birds, without designating which one was for which type of sacrifice. The Kohen would then allocate a sacrifice to a bird. However, the complication is that a cage (consisting of a pair of birds) cannot have both birds offered as one type of sacrifice. The result is that if birds become mixed up (whether completely or a number of birds flies from one group to another), certain birds are disqualified from being offered. It is the laws of these complications that form the subject of tractate Kinnim.

The tractate consists of three chapters:
*Chapter 1 deals largely with cases where birds flew into a designated group or where different groups of birds became totally mixed up.
*Chapter 2 considers the group from which a bird flew away, as well as multiple mixups
*Chapter 3 considers which sacrifices are counted if the Kohen did offer certain birds, without consulting the laws of chapters 1 and 2.

There is no Gemara on Kinnim in either the Talmud Bavli or the Talmud Yerushalmi. However, the Mishnayot of the tractate are included in the Daf Yomi cycle, and are printed in the standard editions of the Talmud. A traditional explanation for this has been that the addition of the tractate enabled all the tractates of Kodshim to be studied in the Daf Yomi cycle. In the standard edition, Kinnim is located in a volume which contains Meilah, Kinnim, Tamid and Midot. It occupies folios 22a-25a.

Kinnim is considered to be one of the most difficult tractates in the whole Talmud, largely because the mishnayot involve rather elaborate counting methods and practices. These resemble certain forms of counting found in discrete mathematics and, appropriately, make use of the pigeonhole principle. Furthermore, the form of expression in Kinnim is particularly terse, even for the Mishna. This has resulted in a number of commentaries, many of them having very different explanations of the whole tractate. However, it is only the last few mishnayot of the last chapter that have caused the most difficulties.

<doc id="890273" wikidata="Q2553789" url="?curid=890273" title="Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon">
<text>Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon (4 March 1526 – 23 July 1596) was an English peer and courtier. He was the patron of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, William Shakespeare&#x27;s playing company. The son of Mary Boleyn, he was a cousin of Elizabeth I.

==Early life==
Henry Carey was the second child of William Carey and Mary Boleyn, who was the sister of Anne Boleyn, the second wife and Queen of Henry VIII. Carey and his elder sister Catherine came under the wardship of their maternal aunt Anne Boleyn, who was engaged to Henry VIII at the time. The children still had active contact with their mother, who remained on good terms with her sister, until Mary&#x27;s secret elopement with a soldier, William Stafford (later Lord of Chebsey) in 1535.

Anne Boleyn acted as her nephew&#x27;s patron and provided him with an excellent education in a prestigious Cistercian monastery. He was also tutored at some point by the French poet Nicholas Bourbon, whose life had been saved from the French Inquisition after Queen Anne Boleyn’s intervention.

Carey&#x27;s royal aunt was beheaded in May 1536, when he was ten years old. His mother died seven years later in 1543 on her estate in Essex. On 21 May 1545 he married Anne Morgan, daughter of Sir Thomas Morgan, of Arkestone, Herefordshire, and Anne Elizabeth Whitney.

==Royal appointments==
Carey served twice as Member of Parliament, representing Buckingham during 1547–1550—entering when he was 21—and 1554–1555. He was knighted in November 1558 and created Baron by his first cousin Elizabeth I of England on 13 January 1559. His sister, Catherine, was one of Elizabeth&#x27;s favourite ladies-in-waiting and the Queen was very generous to her Boleyn relatives. 

Carey&#x27;s Baronial estate consisted of the manors of Hunsdon and Eastwick, Hertfordshire and possessions in Kent. Hunsdon had previously belonged to Elizabeth&#x27;s predecessor Mary I. Carey was also granted an annual pension of £400. On 31 October 1560 he was appointed master of the queen&#x27;s hawks with a salary of £40 a year. On 20 April 1561, Carey also became a Knight of the Garter.

In 1564, Elizabeth appointed Carey Captain of the Gentlemen Pensioners, a position making him effectively her personal bodyguard for four years. He accompanied her to Cambridge University in 1564, for which he was awarded an MA. On 25 August 1568, Carey was appointed Governor of Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland.

== Trouble on the border ==
Carey and William Drury heard that trouble on the Scottish borders was caused by Dan Carr or Ker of Shilstoke-Bray, who was said to have visited Mary, Queen of Scots, at Carlisle Castle. She was supposed to have encouraged Carr to make trouble in Teviotdale, Liddesdale, and the West borders, and to spread seditious literature to make difficulties for Regent Moray, who now ruled Scotland. Carey set men to watch for him, and Carr was eventually captured by Walter Ker of Cessford. Mary told Carey&#x27;s son, George Carey, that the unrest was caused by her enemies, who hoped for English reprisals against her supporters.

==Northern Rebellion==
The year 1569 was the beginning of the Rising of the North (November 1569 – February 1570), a major uprising instigated by Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland and Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland. The rebellion expected the support of the Roman Catholic Pope Pius V.

Carey was appointed Lieutenant General of the forces loyal to the Queen. His February victory over Sir Leonard Dacre near Gelt Bridge between Naworth and Carlisle was instrumental in crushing the rebellion. Nearly three thousand rebels ambushed Carey&#x27;s party of half that size, but Carey was nonetheless victorious in fending off the assault. 

A number of the rebels crossed the border to Scotland but were there targeted by the forces of the Scottish leader, Regent Lennox. Carey could still appreciate the courage of Dacre&#x27;s soldiers. In his letter to the Queen detailing the victory, he made mention of the rebel charge &quot;the bravest charge that ever I saw!&quot;. He was rewarded with a personal note of thanks from Queen Elizabeth I that read in part:

The victorious Carey was appointed Warden of the Eastern March and represented the Queen in signing a treaty with Regent Mar on 23 October 1571. On 31 July 1574, Carey became Keeper of Somerset House, the property of the Queen before ascending the throne. He was then named a Privy Counsellor in 1577. On 16 January 1581, Carey was appointed Captain-General of the forces responsible for the safety of English borders. He was appointed Lord Chamberlain of the Household in July 1585 and would hold this position until his death. This did not prevent Elizabeth from appointing him Lord Chamberlain Lieutenant, Principal Captain and Governor of the army &quot;for the defence and surety of our own Royal Person&quot;. The appointment occurred on 20 July 1588 in Tilbury.

Carey also served as Chief Justice in Eyre, south of the River Trent between 1589 and his death. He was Joined Commissioner of the Office Earl Marshal and High Steward of Ipswich and Doncaster. He served as Chief Justice of the Royal Forces between 20 December 1591 and his death. On 2 March 1592 Carey was appointed High Steward of Oxford for life.

==Affair with Emilia Lanier==
In 1587, Carey began an affair with Emilia Lanier (1569–1645), who was the daughter of a Venetian-born court musician, and may have been covertly Jewish. Carey, 45 years older than Lanier, was Elizabeth&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain at the time of their affair and a patron of the arts and theatre (he was the patron of Shakespeare&#x27;s theatre company, known as the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, but not until two years after their affair was over).

Records indicate that Carey gave Lanier a pension of £40 a year. Lanier apparently enjoyed her time as Carey&#x27;s mistress. An entry from Simon Forman&#x27;s diary reads &quot;[Lanier] hath bin married 4 years/ The old Lord Chamberlain kept her longue She was maintained in great pomp... she hath 40£ a yere &amp; was welthy to him that married her in monie &amp; Jewells&quot;. In 1592, when she was 23, Lanier became pregnant with Carey&#x27;s child. Carey paid her off with a sum of money and then married her off to her first cousin once removed, Alfonso Lanier, a Queen&#x27;s musician. Church records show the two were married in St. Botolph&#x27;s church, Aldgate, on 18 October 1592. In 1593, Lanier gave birth to Carey&#x27;s son, Henry, presumably named after his father.

==Death==
Carey died at Somerset House, Strand on 23 July 1596 and was buried on 12 August 1596 at Westminster Abbey. On his deathbed his cousin Elizabeth I offered to create him Earl of Wiltshire; however, he refused, saying: 
Two of his sons, George, and John, successively followed him as Baron Hunsdon.

==Relation to Henry VIII==
Carey&#x27;s mother, Mary Boleyn, was mistress to King Henry VIII from 1520. The exact dates when the affair started and ended are unknown, although it is believed to have ended by the time Carey was born on 4 March 1526.

Contemporary rumours stated that Carey was an illegitimate child of Henry VIII. Some ten years after the Carey was born, John Hales, vicar of Isleworth, remarked that he had met a &quot;young Master Carey,&quot; whom some monks believed to be the king&#x27;s son. However, as Eric Ives has pointed out, the vicar was hostile towards the Boleyn family and may just have been causing trouble. The idea that Carey was Henry VIII&#x27;s secret son has inspired modern historical fiction, such as the novel &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot;. Alison Weir in her biography of Mary Boleyn concluded that the preponderance of evidence points to Henry Carey&#x27;s sister, Catherine Carey, as being the only offspring of Mary&#x27;s relations with Henry VIII.

==Issue==
Carey and Anne Morgan&#x27;s marriage resulted in the birth of thirteen children:
*Sir George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon (1547 – 8 September 1603). He was married on 29 December 1574 to Elizabeth Spencer, daughter of Sir John Spencer, Member of Parliament representing Northamptonshire, and Katherine Kitson.
*Michael Carey (1550–1581)
*Catherine Carey ( – 25 February 1603). She was wife of Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham.
*Sir John Carey, 3rd Baron Hunsdon ( – April 1617). He was married on 20 December 1576 to Mary Hyde, daughter of Leonard Hyde of Throcking, Hertfordshire. They were parents of Henry Carey, 1st Earl of Dover.
*William Carey (1552–1552)
*William Carey (1 July 1553 – 1593)
*Thomas Carey. (1555–1556), died in infancy.
*Thomas Carey. (11 October 1556) Presumably named after deceased brother. Still active in 1587.
*Sir Edmund Carey ( – 1637). He was married three times: first to Mary Crocker, second to Elizabeth Neville and third to Judith Humphrey. He was father of a younger Sir Robert Carey but it is not certain which wife gave birth to him.
*Robert Carey, 1st Earl of Monmouth (1560 – 12 April 1639). He was married on 20 August 1593 to Elizabeth Trevannion, daughter of Sir Hugh Trevannion and Sybilla Morgan. They were parents of Henry Carey, 2nd Earl of Monmouth.
*Henry Carey (? – 1599). MP for Berwick and Buckingham.
*Philadelphia Carey (December 1563 – 1629), who married Thomas Scrope, 10th Baron Scrope and was mother of Emanuel Scrope, 1st Earl of Sunderland.
*Margaret Carey (30 November 1564 – 30 November 1605). She was married to Sir Edward Hoby, son of Thomas Hoby and Elizabeth Cooke.

In addition, Carey had several illegitimate children, including Valentine Cary (c.1570–1626), who became a clergyman, and ultimately Bishop of Exeter.

<doc id="890282" wikidata="Q78931" url="?curid=890282" title="Franz Stangl">
<text>Franz Paul Stangl (; 26 March 1908 – 28 June 1971) was an Austrian police officer and commandant of the Nazi extermination camps Sobibor and Treblinka in World War II.

Stangl, an employee of the T-4 Euthanasia Program and an SS commander in Nazi Germany, became commandant of the camps during the Operation Reinhard phase of the Holocaust. After the war he fled to Brazil for 16 years. In those 16 years he worked for Volkswagen do Brasil before he was arrested in 1967, extradited to West Germany, and tried there for the mass murder of one million people. In 1970, he was found guilty and sentenced to the maximum penalty, life imprisonment. He died of heart failure six months later.

==Early life and Nazi affiliations==
Stangl was born in 1908 in Altmünster, located in the Salzkammergut region of Austria. He was the son of a night watchman and had such an emotionally distressing relationship with his father that he was deeply frightened by and hated the sight of the elder Stangl&#x27;s Habsburg Dragoons uniform. Stangl claimed his father had died of malnutrition in 1916. To help support his family, Franz learned to play the zither and earned money giving zither lessons. Stangl completed his public schooling in 1923.

In his teens, he secured an apprenticeship as a weaver, qualifying as a master weaver in 1927. Concerned that this trade offered few opportunities for advancement – and having observed the poor health of his co-workers – Stangl sought a new career. He moved to Innsbruck in 1930 and applied for an appointment in the Austrian federal police. Stangl later suggested that he liked the security and cleanliness that the police uniforms represented to him. He was accepted in early 1931 and trained for two years at the federal police academy in Linz.

Stangl became a member of the Austrian Nazi Party in 1931 when it was an illegal association for an Austrian police officer at that time. After the war he denied having been a Nazi since 1931 and claimed that he had enrolled as member of the party only to avoid arrest following the Anschluss of Austria into Nazi Germany in May 1938. Records suggest that Stangl contributed to a Nazi aid fund but he disavowed knowing about the intended party purpose of the fund. Stangl had Nazi Party number 6,370,447 and SS number 296,569.

In 1935, Stangl was accepted into the &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; as a detective in the Austrian town of Wels. After Austria&#x27;s &quot;Anschluss,&quot; Stangl was assigned to the &quot;Schutzpolizei&quot; (which was taken over by the Gestapo) in Linz, where he was posted to the Jewish Bureau (). Stangl joined the SS in May 1938. He ultimately reached the rank of &quot;SS-Hauptsturmführer&quot; (Captain).

==T-4 Euthanasia program, 1940 – March 1943==
After the onset of World War II, in early 1940, Stangl was instructed to report for work at the Public Service Foundation for Institutional Care (&quot;Gemeinnützige Stiftung für Anstaltspflege&quot;), a front organization of the T-4 Euthanasia Program. Stangl purposely solicited for a job in the newly created T-4 program in order to escape difficulties with his boss in the Linz Gestapo. He travelled to the RSHA in Berlin, where he was received by Paul Werner, who offered Stangl a job as supervisor in charge of security at a T-4 facility, and in the language commonly used during recruitment, described Action T4 as a &quot;humanitarian&quot; effort that was &quot;essential, legal, and secret&quot;. Next Stangl met with Viktor Brack, who offered him a choice of work between Hartheim and Sonnenstein killing centres; Stangl picked Hartheim, which was near Linz.

Through a direct order from &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler issued in November 1940, Stangl became the deputy office manager (Police Superintendent) of the T-4 Euthanasia Program at Hartheim Euthanasia Centre, and in late summer 1941 at Bernburg Euthanasia Centre, where people with mental and physical disabilities, as well as political prisoners, were sent to be killed.

At Hartheim, Stangl served under Christian Wirth as an assistant supervisor in charge of security. When Wirth was succeeded by Franz Reichleitner, Stangl stayed on as Reichleitner&#x27;s deputy. During his brief posting to Bernburg Euthanasia Centre Stangl reorganized the office at that T-4 facility. In March 1942, Stangl was given a choice to either return to the Linz Gestapo or be transferred to Lublin for work in Operation Reinhard. Stangl accepted the posting to Lublin in the General Government, where he would manage Operation Reinhard under Odilo Globočnik.

==Extermination camps==

===Sobibor, April – August 1942===
Stangl was appointed by &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler to be the first commandant of Sobibor extermination camp. Stangl was Sobibor&#x27;s commandant from 28 April until the end of August 1942, at the rank of &quot;SS-Obersturmführer&quot;. He claimed that Odilo Globočnik had initially suggested that Sobibor was merely a supply camp for the army and that the true nature of the camp became known to him only when he himself discovered a gas chamber hidden in the woods. Globočnik told him that if the Jews &quot;were not working hard enough&quot; he was fully permitted to kill them and that Globočnik would send &quot;new ones&quot;.

Stangl studied the camp operations and management of Bełżec, which had commenced extermination activity. He then accelerated the completion of Sobibor. Around that time Stangl also had further dealings with Wirth, who was running extermination camps at Bełżec and Chelmno. Between 16 and 18 May 1942, Sobibor became fully operational. However, Stangl quickly realized that the extermination process was being encumbered by constant turnover among its prisoner labor force. He ended arbitrary culling of &quot;work Jews&quot; and established semi-permanent work teams, each overseen by a kapo. In the three months before Stangl was transferred to Treblinka, Yitzak Arad estimates that approximately 90,000 Jews were killed at Sobibor.

Stangl avoided interacting with his victims, and he was rarely seen except when he greeted arriving prisoner transports. On these occasions he stood out because of the all-white linen riding coat he would wear, an affectation which earned him the nickname &quot;White Death&quot;. Prisoners who did interact with him regarded him as one of the &quot;moderates&quot; among the camp staff. He was only ever accused of a single act of hands-on violence, and on one occasion, he convened a meeting to address what he regarded as Kurt Bolender&#x27;s &quot;bullying&quot; of the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; prisoners working in the extermination area. Stangl took an interest in one prisoner, Shlomo Szmajzner, who was forced to make gold jewelry for the SS officers. After the war, Szmajzner recalled Stangl as an arrogant man who stood out for &quot;his obvious pleasure in his work and his situation. None of the others – although they were, in different ways, so much worse than he – showed this to such an extent. He had this perpetual smile on his face.&quot;

Around 100,000 Jews are believed to have been killed there while Stangl was the administrator until the furnaces broke down in October, by which time Stangl had left. Stangl was succeeded as Sobibor commandant by his Hartheim Euthanasia Center colleague, Franz Reichleitner. Erich Bauer later remarked:

Also according to Bauer, Stangl participated in gang rapes of female prisoners prior to killing them:
===Treblinka, September 1942 – August 1943===

On 28 August 1942, Odilo Globočnik ordered Stangl to become &quot;Kommandant&quot; at the newly opened but disorganized death camp, Treblinka, then under the incompetent command of Irmfried Eberl. Globočnik trusted that Stangl could restore order at Treblinka, since Stangl had a reputation as a highly competent administrator and people manager with an excellent grasp of detail.

Stangl assumed command of Treblinka on 1 September 1942. Stangl wanted his camp to look attractive, so he ordered the paths paved and flowers planted along the sides of Seidel Street, near camp headquarters and SS living quarters. Despite being directly responsible for the camp&#x27;s operations, Stangl said he limited his contact with Jewish prisoners as much as possible. Stangl rarely intervened with unusually cruel acts (other than gassing) perpetrated by his subordinate officers at the camp. He usually wore a white uniform and carried a whip, which caused prisoners to nickname him the &quot;White Death&quot;.

Stangl claimed while in prison that his dedication had nothing to do with ideology or hatred of Jews. He said he matter-of-factly viewed the prisoners as material objects rather than people, including their extermination: &quot;That was my profession. I enjoyed it. It fulfilled me. And yes, I was ambitious about that, I won&#x27;t deny it.&quot; Stangl accepted and grew accustomed to the killings, perceiving prisoners not as humans but merely as &quot;cargo&quot; that must be destroyed. Stangl accepted the extermination of the Jews as a fact. At about this time, Stangl began drinking heavily. He is quoted as saying:

In September 1942, Stangl supervised the building of new, larger gas chambers to augment the existing gas chambers. The new gas chambers became operational in early autumn 1942. It is believed that these death chambers were capable of killing 3,000 people in two hours, and 12,000 to 15,000 victims easily every day, with a maximum capacity of 22,000 deaths in 24 hours. According to Jankiel Wiernik: &quot;When the new gas chambers were completed, the &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; [Stangl] came and remarked to the SS men who were with him: &#x27;Finally the Jewish city is ready&#x27; ()&quot;.

===Trieste, August 1943–1945 ===
In August 1943, along with Globočnik, Stangl was transferred to Trieste, where he helped organize the campaign against Yugoslav partisans and local Jews. Due to illness, he returned to Vienna in early 1945.

==Post-war escape, 1945–1961==
At the end of the war, Stangl fled without concealing his name. He was detained by the United States Army in 1945 and was briefly imprisoned in Linz, Austria, in 1947, pending investigation. He was suspected of complicity in the T-4 euthanasia programme. On 30 May 1948, he escaped to Italy with his colleague from Sobibor, SS sergeant Gustav Wagner. Austrian Roman Catholic Bishop Alois Hudal, a Nazi sympathizer, who would be forced to resign by the Vatican in 1952, helped Stangl to escape through a &quot;ratline&quot;, and he reached Syria using a Red Cross passport. Stangl was joined by his wife and family, and lived in Syria for three years. In 1951, they moved to Brazil. After years in other jobs, he found work with the help of friends, at the Volkswagen do Brasil plant in São Bernardo do Campo, still using his own name.

==Arrest, trial, and death==
Although Stangl&#x27;s role in the mass murder of men, women and children was known to the Austrian authorities, a warrant for his arrest was not issued until 1961. Despite being registered under his real name at the Austrian consulate in São Paulo, it took another six years before he was tracked by Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal and arrested by Brazilian federal police on 28 February 1967. He never used an assumed name during his escape, and it is not clear why it took so long to apprehend him. After his extradition to West Germany by Brazilian authorities, he was tried for the deaths of around 1,000,000 people. He admitted to these killings but argued: &quot;My conscience is clear. I was simply doing my duty...&quot; Stangl&#x27;s attempt to justify his actions as non-criminal in the face of German law was quoted by Arad:

Philosopher John Kekes discussed Stangl and the degree of his responsibility for war crimes in chapter 4 of his book &quot;The Roots of Evil&quot;. The Schwurgericht Düsseldorf court found Stangl guilty on 22 December 1970 and sentenced him to the maximum penalty, life imprisonment. While in prison, Stangl was interviewed extensively by Gitta Sereny for a study of him, published under the title &quot;Into That Darkness&quot;. Sereny wrote, quoting him:

During his prison interview, Sereny later wrote:

Stangl had pronounced the words &quot;my guilt&quot;: but more than the words, the finality of it was in the sagging of his body, and on his face. After more than a minute he started again, a half-hearted attempt, in a dull voice. &quot;My guilt,&quot; he said, &quot;is that I am still here. That is my guilt.&quot;

On 28 June 1971, 19 hours after the conclusion of that interview, Stangl died of heart failure in a Düsseldorf prison.

<text>Colin Joseph Bibby (20 November 1948 – 7 August 2004) was a British ornithologist and conservationist.

Bibby was born in the Wirral, Cheshire, the son of a North Wales farmer. He was educated at Oundle School, Northamptonshire, and at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating in natural sciences. He gained his PhD for a classic study on the ecology and conservation of Dartford warblers.

Bibby was a research staff member for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds from 1971 to 1986, and the head of Conservation Science from 1986 to 1991. In 1991, he moved to BirdLife International, where he led their research team and a major research program, with projects in over 70 countries. In 2001 he became a self-employed environmental consultant. He was also a member of the Rare Breeding Birds Panel, and the founding editor of the British Trust for Ornithology journal &quot;Ringing and Migration&quot;.

His major contributions were in the development of quantitative approaches to the study of birds for research leading to conservation. He was also a frequent contributor to &quot;British Birds&quot; magazine.

In 1994, he was awarded the Dr A.H. Heineken Prize for Environmental Sciences for his work with BirdLife International, and in June 2004, he received the RSPB Medal in recognition of his contribution to ornithology.

He learned that he had an incurable cancer in March 2004 and, on 7 August 2004 at the age of 55, died in his sleep. He was survived by his wife, Ruth, and three sons.

== Memorials ==

A special supplement published with &quot;Bird Conservation International&quot; (Vol 18 No 3, September 2008) was dedicated to Bibby. In it, Mike Rands, BirdLife&#x27;s Chief Executive, wrote:

In 2017 a stained-glass painting of a Dartford Warbler, in the style of Bibby&#x27;s favourite artist, Eric Ennion, was added to a window at St Michael and All Angels Church, Caldecote, Cambridgeshire in Bibby&#x27;s honour. Bibby had spent the months after his fatal diagnosis fundraising for the church windows&#x27; restoration. A service of dedication for the memorial painting, on 16 July 2017, led by the Archdeacon of Cambridge, Alex Hughes, was attended by over 100 people.

<text>George Napoleon &quot;Nap&quot; Rucker (September 30, 1884 – December 19, 1970) was an American professional baseball pitcher and politician from Georgia. Rucker was a left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Brooklyn Superbas/Dodgers/Robins. Over his 10 seasons, Rucker led the league in shutouts, complete games, and innings pitched throughout his career. On September 5, 1908, Rucker became the first left-handed pitcher to throw a no-hitter in Dodger history.

==Early years==

Rucker was born in Crabapple, Georgia, to parents Sarah Hembree and John Rucker, a Confederate veteran. He dropped out of school and became an apprentice printer. Inspired by a headline he worked on entitled &quot;$10,000 For Pitching a Baseball&quot;, Rucker pursued a minor league career.
==Professional baseball==

In 1904. Rucker played with the Atlanta Crackers in the Southern Association. He then spent the following two years playing for the Augusta Tourists in the South Atlantic League and compiled a 40–20 win–loss record during that span. Rucker also roomed with Ty Cobb during his time with the Tourists.

===Major league (1907–1916)===

Rucker played for the Brooklyn Superbas for his entire major league career. Rucker threw a no-hitter against the Boston Doves on September 5, 1908. He led the National League in complete games (27), innings pitched (320.1), and shutouts (6) in 1910. His best year was 1911, when he won 22 games for the Dodgers. He holds the Brooklyn Dodgers record for the most shutouts in the National League (38); most strikeouts (16) in a regulation nine-inning game, and the most 1-0 shutouts (3) in a 154-game season. He became strictly a knuckleball pitcher when his speed declined.

As a player who received more than 5.0% of votes cast, Rucker remained eligible for induction by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America until 1946, when his time on the ballot expired after 10 unsuccessful appearances. His highest percentage of votes earned came in his final year on the ballot, receiving 6.4% of the vote in 1946.

Following his unsuccessful nominations, Yankees Hall of Fame manager, Casey Stengel, said about Rucker, &quot;If it hadn&#x27;t been for Nap, I reckon I wouldn&#x27;t be manager of the Yankees now. I wouldn&#x27;t have even stayed in baseball.&quot;

Rucker was born in Crabapple, Georgia. After his baseball career, Rucker went on to a successful business career including investing in a local bank and ownership of a plantation, several cotton farms, a wheat mill.

Smith had been a long-time friend of &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; director Mike Clattenburg, and starred in &quot;Cart Boy&quot; with Robb Wells (who plays Ricky) and John Paul Tremblay (who plays Julian) in 1995.

Smith was &quot;messing&quot; around on the set one day and slipped into his Cart Boy character from the short &quot;The Cart Boy&quot;. Clattenburg apparently realized the depth this character held, and the Cart Boy, now known as Bubbles, was written into the show. Bubbles was never intended to be a main character, but the more outrageously he behaved, the more audiences loved him, developing him to become a breakout character. Bubbles then became one of the three main protagonists, having established that he knew Julian and Ricky from school back in the late 1970s to high school in the late &#x27;80s.

Smith made an appearance as Bubbles in Snow&#x27;s 2002 music video &quot;Legal&quot;, but his swearing remained censored. He was also featured in Country Star George Canyon&#x27;s video for &quot;Drinkin Thinkin&quot;, which showed Bubbles going after his girlfriend. Mike and the rest of the Trailer park boys appeared in The Tragically Hip video, &quot;The Darkest One&quot;. He has appeared in character as Bubbles at several Guns N&#x27; Roses 2006 Canadian tour dates and dates in Australia and Japan in 2007. Bubbles, along with Ricky and Julian, hosted the 2006 and the 2007 East Coast Music Awards, in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island and Halifax, Nova Scotia respectively.
In March 2008, Smith, along with three others, opened a sports bar in Halifax called &quot;Bubba Ray&#x27;s&quot;.

Smith also was involved in another bar, &quot;Bubbles&#x27; Mansion&quot;, located in Downtown Halifax. The bar, partly owned by Smith, closed in March 2010 after four years of operation, a decision the management attributed to government hikes in the minimum wage and minimum drink prices.

In 2010, Smith reunited with many of his former &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; castmates in the new series &quot;The Drunk and On Drugs Happy Fun Time Hour&quot;. The 6-episode series centers on the idea that a powerful narcotic derived from local berries transforms the cast, leading them to believe they are the characters they&#x27;re playing, including pirates, superheroes, a mafia family and drug dealers. Tremblay, Wells and Smith, who created and scripted the show, performed in many scenes opposite themselves. It was directed by sitcom veteran Ron Murphy.

He also performed a live version of &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; with progressive rock band Rush.

On October 22, 2012, it was confirmed that Smith was to return to his role as Bubbles for a third feature length &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; film entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Legalize It&quot; which concluded filming in late April 2013. The film was released on April 18, 2014.

In the spring of 2013, Smith along with his Trailer Park Boys cohorts Wells and Tremblay started Swearnet, an internet-based television network that is entirely uncensored. The trio have also produced a film that is a fictional take on their website.

==Personal life==
For a short time in 2006, Smith was engaged to actress Nichole Hiltz after meeting on the set of &quot;Trailer Park Boys: The Movie&quot;. Smith has two children; his son, Vox is an actor who has appeared as one of the hockey kids on &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; and provided the voice for Mo in &quot;Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series&quot;.

In 2016, Smith was arrested in Los Angeles on suspicion of misdemeanor domestic battery. The alleged victim (who was not the person who called the police) released a statement in support of Smith, and the charges were dropped.

<doc id="890295" wikidata="Q27016" url="?curid=890295" title="European water vole">
<text>The European water vole (Arvicola amphibius) or northern water vole is a semi-aquatic rodent. It is often informally called the water rat, though it only superficially resembles a true rat. Water voles have rounder noses than rats, deep brown fur, chubby faces and short fuzzy ears; unlike rats their tails, paws and ears are covered with hair.

In the wild, on average, water voles only live about five months. Maximum longevity in captivity is two and a half years.

== Appearance ==
Water voles reach in length, plus a tail which is about half the length of the body. Weights reported for adults are variable. It is possible for large, optimal adults to weigh as much as However, these are peak weights. Elsewhere, the mean body mass has been reported as , although this figure includes immature water voles. The minimum weight to successfully breed as well as to survive winter is reportedly in females and in males. As a species the mean body mass is claimed as .

Overall, European water voles are a uniform dark brown colour, with slightly paler coloration on the underside. Their pelage is quite thick and they are furred over their entire body, including their tail, unlike rats. Their dark colour allows them to blend in well in the densely vegetated areas they inhabit.

== Taxonomy ==
The binomial applied to the European water vole is &quot;Arvicola amphibius&quot;; it was formerly known by the junior synonym &quot;A. terrestris&quot;. The confusion stems from the fact that Linnaeus described two species of water vole on the same page of the same work. Those two forms are now universally considered the same species. It has been recognized as &quot;A. amphibius&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) because the first source to unite the two forms, which Linnaeus had treated separately, into a single species chose &quot;A. amphibius&quot; as the valid name. The species is widely known by the synonym &quot;A. terrestris&quot;, which for many decades was treated as the valid name.

Some authorities consider the southwestern water vole (&quot;Arvicola sapidus&quot;) to be the same species, but it is now generally considered distinct.

== Range ==
The European water vole (&quot;Arvicola amphibius&quot;) is found in most of Europe, Russia, West Asia and Kazakhstan.

== Habitat ==

In Britain, water voles live in burrows excavated within the banks of rivers, ditches, ponds, and streams. Burrows are normally located adjacent to slow moving, calm water which they seem to prefer. They also live in reed beds where they will weave ball-shaped nests above ground if no suitable banks exist in which to burrow.

Water voles prefer lush vegetation which provides important cover to conceal animals when they are above ground adjacent to the water body. Areas of heavily grazed and trampled riparian habitats are generally avoided. Water voles may be displaced by the introduction of riparian woodland and scrub as they prefer more open wetland habitats away from tree cover.

As well as frequenting typical lowland wetland habitats dominated by rank marginal aquatic vegetation, water voles are also just as at home in areas upland &#x27;peatland&#x27; vegetation where they utilize suitable small ditches, rivers, and lochs surrounded by moorland up to 1,000 m asl (e.g., northern Scotland).

In Europe and Russia, they may venture into woods, fields, and gardens. They live under the snow during the winter.

Water voles are currently being reintroduced as a threatened species in Yorkshire, England. In the Massif Central area of France, however, farmers are campaigning for action to be taken against water voles, where plagues of these rodents are causing major damage to crops.

== Diet ==

Water voles mainly eat grass and other vegetation near the water, but will also consume fruits, bulbs, twigs, buds, and roots when given the opportunity. In Europe, rich harvest periods can cause water vole &quot;plagues&quot; to take place, during which the voles eat ravenously, destroying entire fields of grass and leaving the fields full of burrows. Water voles in some parts of England have been shown to occasionally prey on frogs and tadpoles; it has been speculated that this is to make up for a protein deficiency in the voles&#x27; diet.

Food remains alone are not a reliable indicator of the presence of this species, as other smaller voles can also leave remains of large grasses and rushes.

== Breeding ==
The mating period lasts from March into late autumn. The female vole&#x27;s pregnancy lasts for approximately 21 days. Up to 8 baby voles can be born, each weighing around . The young voles open their eyes three days after their birth. They are half the size of a full grown water vole by the time they are weaned.

== Behaviour ==
Water voles are expert swimmers and divers. They do not usually live in large groups. Adult water voles each have their own territory, which they mark with fecal latrines located either near the nest or burrow, or at favoured water&#x27;s edge platforms where voles leave or enter the water. Latrines are known to be a good survey indicator of this species, and can be used to gauge abundance of animals. They also scent-mark by using a secretion from their bodies (a flank gland), although this is not normally detectable during a field survey. They may attack if their territory is invaded by another water vole.

== Predation ==
As a large and common microtine rodent, the range of predators faced by the European water vole is extensive. However, many species of predator prefer other rodents, such as &quot;Microtus&quot; voles and wood mice, due to their greater numerical abundance. Wildcats, red foxes, most species of hawk (especially common buzzards), owl (especially the barn owl, genus &quot;Strix&quot;, and Eurasian eagle-owl) and falcon (in large numbers by the common kestrel) in their range are among their reported predators. A very large number are also taken by mustelids. Reportedly small &quot;Mustela&quot; weasels as well as European and introduced American mink may take the largest number of water voles of any predator due in part to aligning habitat preferences. The rarely checked invasive population of American mink has reportedly caused a decline of water voles in Britain.

== Conservation ==
=== United Kingdom ===

On 26 February 2008, the U.K. Government announced full legal protection for water voles would be introduced from 6 April 2008.

Water voles have recently returned to Lindow Common nature reserve in Cheshire, after many years of absence.

In 2015, People&#x27;s Trust for Endangered Species launched a new project to try to coordinate conservation efforts for the water-vole in the U.K. The National Water-Vole Monitoring Programme (NWVMP) is the first ongoing monitoring scheme for this species in the U.K. and aims to bring together data from several hundred sites to allow the status of this animal to be assessed year-on-year.
In September 2019, the Box Moor Trust re-introduced 177 water voles in to the River Bulbourne in Hemel Hempstead as part of a three-year plan.

==Literary appearances==
A water vole named &quot;Ratty&quot; is a leading character in the 1908 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; by Kenneth Grahame: the locality used in the book is believed to be Moor Copse in Berkshire, England, and the character&#x27;s name &quot;Ratty&quot; has become widely associated with the species and their riverbank habitat, as well as the misconception that they are a species of rat. There are also watervoles in the works of Redwall by Brian Jacques.

In the comic novel and film &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; by Stella Gibbons, one of the characters, Urk, refers to the subject of his unrequited love, Elfine Starkadder, as his little water vole. Throughout the story, Urk spends a lot of time talking to the water voles on the farm.

C. S. Calverley, a 19th-century writer of (among other things) light verse, in his poem &quot;Shelter&quot;, beginning:
&lt;poem&gt;By the wide lake&#x27;s margin I mark&#x27;d her lie—
The wide, weird lake where the alders sigh—&lt;/poem&gt;

Tells of an apparently shy, easily frightened young female by a lakeside, who in the last line of the poem, it is revealed that:
For she was a water-rat.

The Rolling Stones song &quot;Live with Me&quot; includes the line &quot;My best friend he shoots water rats and feeds them to his geese&quot;, referring to Keith Richards&#x27;s habit of shooting water voles in the moat of his Redlands, West Wittering home.

<doc id="890299" wikidata="Q706880" url="?curid=890299" title="Sergiusz Piasecki">
<text>Sergiusz Piasecki (; 1901 in Lachowicze near Baranowicze – 1964 in Penley, London) was one of the best known Polish writers of the mid 20th century. He was mainly portraying life of criminals and lowlifes of Minsk, which he knew very well, as well as work of Polish spies in Soviet Union and later the anti-Nazi conspiracy in Wilno; he had personal experience in both matters.

His novel written in prison, &quot;Lover of the Great Bear&quot;, published in 1937, was the third most popular novel in the Second Polish Republic. Following World War II, Piasecki&#x27;s books were banned by communist censorship in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, in early 1990s, &quot;Lover of the Great Bear&quot; became again one of the best selling books in the country according to &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot; daily newspaper. His other novel, an Anti-Soviet satire &quot;The Memoirs of a Red Army Officer&quot;, had already been reprinted several times.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Sergiusz Piasecki was born on 1 April 1901 (or 1 June 1899) in Lachowicze, 130 km from Minsk, then in Northwestern Krai of the Russian Empire (now Brest Province, Belarus). The latter date was presented by Piasecki on several occasions, in order to mislead the authorities. He was an illegitimate son of an postmaster Michał Piasecki and servant Klaudia Kukałowicz. He was looked after by his stepmother Filomena Gruszewska, who bullied him physically and mentally. His family spoke exclusively in Russian at home and he didn&#x27;t learn Polish language until his later imprisonment.

His childhood was very difficult because children at school mocked his Polish roots, calling him &quot;Lach&quot;. Piasecki hated the Russian school – as he later explained – and in the seventh grade, armed with a pistol attacked the teacher. Sentenced to jail, he escaped from prison, and thus his formal education ended.

After he run away from jain, he headed to Moscow, where he experienced October Revolution and watched his close friends&#x27; deaths. It was then that his disgust with communist ideology started.

In 1919 he traveled to Minsk, as a member of the Belarusian &quot;White&quot; organisation. He cooperated with Polish army that was entering Minsk at that time, getting himself wounded.

From 7 April 1920 to 10 January 1921 he studied in army officers school Infantry Officer Cadet School in Warsaw. Later he took part in Polish–Soviet War of 1920. He was demobilised on 12 May 1921. Afterwards, he was asked to join Polish intelligence, as his language skills (he spoke Russian and Belarusian fluently) were highly regarded.

=== Ambiguities ===
In the monograph about his life, work and legend, researcher Krzysztof Polechoński noted that most available data about Piasecki&#x27;s whereabouts often do not correspond to reality, not to mention the claims made by the writer himself. Perhaps the discrepancies came from his work as intelligence agent, but there is no way to confirm many of his personal stories. Piasecki&#x27;s addresses in Vilnius are not available and neither are the registers of houses in which he lived. His personal documents in possession of Piasecki&#x27;s son: such as the copy of a marriage certificate with Jadwiga Waszkiewicz or the birth certificate of his son Władysław Tomaszewicz are falsifications, as revealed by Polechoński himself after a search performed in Vilnius archives. It is not possible to say whether his evacuation card is authentic. There is no photo of him in the prisoners&#x27; photo archives of Łukiszki penitentiary. There is no proof of his residency amongst the Vilnius city dwellers. He might have stayed in a hotel.
===Work for the Polish intelligence service===
In early 1920s, Piasecki organized a whole web of Polish agents, covering the area of Soviet Belarus. Piasecki was also a smuggler, in order to both earn the money to finance his activities but also to have a cover up for them. Foreign spies as a rule were all executed by the Soviets, while smugglers were only incarcerated for a few years. As he wrote – he smuggled cocaine to the USSR, taking furs back to Poland. 

During this period, he served 21 months in Novogrudok prison for his involvement in a clash between two smuggling gangs. This situation repeated again in 1926, Piasecki was again imprisoned and expelled from service. After his release from prison, he tried to interest French intelligence in his services and to leave for the Foreign Legion. After these plans failed, he took up robbery. He was arrested again and sentenced to death by a verdict of the Vilnius Field Court on January 9, 1930. His former supervisors from the intelligence have sought a reduced fine, and so instead of being executed, Piasecki ended up with 15 years imprisonment. His stay in the Lida prison was short. As a leader of a rebellion, he was moved to Rawicz. There, he incited another riot, and was moved to Koronowo and later to Wronki. Finally, Piasecki was transferred to the hardest prison in Poland, located in Łysa Góra near Kielce. As he was regarded a troublesome
prisoner, he was often kept in isolation ward, where he got sick with tuberculosis.

===Writing in prison===

Piasecki became a writer by chance. Later, he confessed that many prisoners in Wronki would write, so he decided to emulate them. As his knowledge of standard Polish was poor, he would learn from a school book of Polish grammar. Some time in either 1935 or 1936, his prison prose came to the attention of a famous novelist and journalist, Melchior Wańkowicz, who toured Polish prisons as a reporter. After reading a manuscript of &quot;&quot;, Wańkowicz encouraged Piasecki to continue his writing efforts and helped him to publish the book. The publication and resulting popularity of the book became the catalyst for getting Piasecki out of prison. The book was published while Piasecki was still in prison, and its copy was delivered to his cell. The book sold out within a month, it was the third most popular publication of interwar Poland.

Due to popularity of the book, Wańkowicz&#x27;s efforts to release Piasecki were supported by other writers and lawyers. Finally, in 1937 president Ignacy Mościcki pardoned him. The day of his release was sensational, crowds of journalists were waiting at a gate, and Piasecki himself was shocked at technical novelties, such as radio, which had become common since 1926. In late 1937 and early 1938, Piasecki went to Otwock and Zakopane, to recuperate. Among others, he met Witkacy, who painted his portrait. Being a celebrity, he avoided meeting with numerous readers, neither did he like signing of books.
=== World War II activities ===
In the summer of 1939 Piasecki went to Wilno where he stayed during the invasion of Poland in World War II. In September 1939, he volunteered to the Border Defence Corps, to fight the Soviets. During the occupation of Poland, he was offered a chance to move to France, but refused and decided to stay in his occupied homeland. Even though he had never been a member of the Home Army (he said he worked for its executive branch No 2, which – like many of his stories – was never confirmed), he had cooperated with the Polish resistance, and in 1943 became an executioner, carrying out capital punishment sentences handed down by underground Polish courts. His wartime noms de guerre were &quot;Sucz&quot;, &quot;Kira&quot; and &quot;Konrad&quot;. Later, he wrote two books about his war activities. These are &#x27; (&quot;The Tower of Babel&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;Adam and Eve&quot;). Among those who he was ordered to execute, was Józef Mackiewicz, falsely accused of cooperating with the Germans. However, Piasecki refused to kill him, and later it was revealed that Mackiewicz&#x27;s accusations had been made up by the Soviets.

=== Living in exile ===
After the war, Piasecki hid from the secret police for a year inside Poland. In April 1946, he escaped to Italy, where he spotted the Italian translation of his own &quot;&quot;. Soon, he got in touch with Polish writers living in exile, including Jerzy Giedroyc. In 1947, Piasecki moved to England, his name can be found on a resolution of Union of Polish Writers in Exile, which urged all concerned to stop publishing in the Communist-occupied country. He once publicly declared that he would gladly take any job that would result in erasing Communism.

Living abroad, Piasecki did not stop writing. In late 1940s he came to the conclusion that humor was the best weapon to fight the Communists. So, he wrote a satire &quot;The memoirs of a Red Army officer&quot;, which presents a made-up diary of Mishka Zubov - an officer of the Red Army, who, together with his unit enters Poland on 17 September 1939. Zubov claims in his &quot;diary&quot; that his only purpose is to kill all the bourgeoisie who possess watches and bicycles. Piasecki became fluent in English as an adult. Sergiusz Piasecki died in 1964 in London at the age of 65. On his tomb, located in Hastings Cemetery, England, it is said that he was born on 1 June 1899.

<doc id="890313" wikidata="Q640596" url="?curid=890313" title="BASIC Stamp">
<text>The BASIC Stamp is a microcontroller with a small, specialized BASIC interpreter (PBASIC) built into ROM. It is made by Parallax, Inc. and has been popular with electronics hobbyists since the early 1990s. 

==Technical specifications==
Although the BASIC Stamp 2 has the form of a 24 pin DIP chip, it is in fact a small printed circuit board (PCB) that contains the essential elements of a microprocessor system:
* A Microcontroller containing the CPU, a built in ROM containing the BASIC interpreter, and various peripherals
* 2kB of i²C EEPROM memory.
* A clock, in the form of a ceramic resonator
* Voltage regulator
* External input/output

The end result is that a hobbyist can connect a 9 V battery to a BASIC Stamp and have a complete system. A serial connection to a personal computer allows the programmer to download software to the BASIC Stamp, which is stored in the onboard non-volatile memory device: it remains programmed until it is erased or reprogrammed, even when the power of the stamp is removed. If the power is reconnected the stamp immediately starts executing the program in slot 0 (of 8, numbered 0..7).

==Programming==
The BASIC Stamp is programmed in a variant of the BASIC language, called PBASIC. PBASIC incorporates common microcontroller functions, including PWM, serial communications, I²C and 1-Wire communications, communications with common LCD driver circuits, hobby servo pulse trains, pseudo-sine wave frequencies, and the ability to time an RC circuit which may be used to detect an analog value.

Once a program has been written in the &#x27;Stamp Editor&#x27;, an integrated development environment (IDE) in Windows, the syntax can be checked, tokenized and sent to the chip through a serial/USB Mini-B cable, where it will run.

==Versions==

There are currently four variants of the interpreter:
# (1992) BASIC Stamp 1 (BS1)
# (1995) BASIC Stamp 2 (BS2), with six sub-variants:
## BS2e
## BS2sx
## BS2p24
## BS2p40
## BS2pe
## BS2px
# (2002) Javelin Stamp
# (2006) Propeller\Spin Stamp

The BS2 sub-variants feature more memory, higher execution speed, additional specialized PBASIC commands, extra I/O pins, etc., in comparison to the original BS2 model. While the BS1 and BS2 use a PIC, the remaining BASIC Stamp 2 variants use a Parallax SX processor. 

The third variant is the Javelin Stamp. This module uses a subset of Sun Microsystems&#x27; Java programming language instead of Parallax&#x27;s PBASIC. It does not include any networking facilities.

The fourth variant is the Spin Stamp. The module is based on the Parallax Propeller and therefore uses the SPIN programming language instead of PBASIC.

A number of companies now make &quot;clones&quot; of the BASIC Stamp with additional features, such as faster execution, analog-to-digital converters and hardware-based PWM which can run in the background. 

The Parallax Propeller is gradually accumulating software libraries which give it functionality similar to the BASIC Stamp; however, there is no uniform list of which PBASIC facilities now have Spin equivalents.

<text>Brittle stars, serpent stars, or ophiuroids (; ; referring to the serpent-like arms of the brittle star) are echinoderms in the class Ophiuroidea, closely related to starfish. They crawl across the sea floor using their flexible arms for locomotion. The ophiuroids generally have five long, slender, whip-like arms which may reach up to in length on the largest specimens.

The Ophiuroidea contain two large clades, Ophiurida (brittle stars) and Euryalida (basket stars). Over 2,000 species of brittle stars live today. More than 1,200 of these species are found in deep waters, greater than 200 m deep.

==Range==
The ophiuroids diverged in the Early Ordovician. Ophiuroids can be found today in all of the major marine provinces, from the poles to the tropics. Basket stars are usually confined to the deeper parts of this range; Ophiuroids are known even from abyssal (&gt;6,000 m) depths. However, brittle stars are also common members of reef communities, where they hide under rocks and even within other living organisms. A few ophiuroid species can even tolerate brackish water, an ability otherwise almost unknown among echinoderms. A brittle star&#x27;s skeleton is made up of embedded ossicles.

==Anatomy==
Of all echinoderms, the Ophiuroidea may have the strongest tendency toward five-segment radial (pentaradial) symmetry. The body outline is similar to that of starfish, in that ophiuroids have five arms joined to a central body disk. However, in ophiuroids, the central body disk is sharply marked off from the arms.

The disk contains all of the viscera. That is, the internal organs of digestion and reproduction never enter the arms, as they do in the Asteroidea. The underside of the disk contains the mouth, which has five toothed jaws formed from skeletal plates. The madreporite is usually located within one of the jaw plates, and not on the upper side of the animal as it is in starfish.

The ophiuroid coelom is strongly reduced, particularly in comparison to other echinoderms.

===Water-vascular system===
The vessels of the water vascular system end in tube feet. The water vascular system generally has one madreporite. Others, such as certain Euryalina, have one per arm on the aboral surface. Still other forms have no madreporite at all. Suckers and ampullae are absent from the tube feet.

===Nervous system===
The nervous system consists of a main nerve ring which runs around the central disk. At the base of each arm, the ring attaches to a radial nerve which runs to the end of the limb. The nerves in each limb run through a canal at the base of the vertebral ossicles.

Most ophiuroids have no eyes, or other specialised sense organs. However, they have several types of sensitive nerve endings in their epidermis, and are able to sense chemicals in the water, touch, and even the presence or absence of light. Moreover, tube feet may sense light as well as odors. These are especially found at the ends of their arms, detecting light and retreating into crevices.

===Digestion===
The mouth is rimmed with five jaws, and serves as an anus (egestion) as well as a mouth (ingestion). Behind the jaws is a short esophagus and a stomach cavity which occupies much of the dorsal half of the disk. Digestion occurs within 10 pouches or infolds of the stomach, which are essentially ceca, but unlike in sea stars, almost never extend into the arms. The stomach wall contains glandular hepatic cells.

Ophiuroids are generally scavengers or detritivores. Small organic particles are moved into the mouth by the tube feet. Ophiuroids may also prey on small crustaceans or worms. Basket stars in particular may be capable of suspension feeding, using the mucus coating on their arms to trap plankton and bacteria. They extend one arm out and use the other four as anchors. Brittle stars will eat small suspended organisms if available. In large, crowded areas, brittle stars eat suspended matter from prevailing seafloor currents.

Many species in the family Ophiuridae are carnivorous. &quot;Ophiura Linnaeus&quot; hunts epibenthic animals and the Antarctic Ophiosparte gigas is an active predator. &quot;Ophiura albida Forbes&quot; and &quot;Ophiura sarsii Lütken&quot; eat both infaunal prey, carrion and seafloor organic matter, and &quot;Ophionereis reticulata&quot; is omnivorous and feeds on algae, polychaetes and detritus.

In basket stars, the arms are used to sweep food rhythmically to the mouth. &quot;Ophiopsammus maculata&quot; consumes &quot;Nothofagus&quot; pollen in the New Zealand fjords (since those trees hang over the water). &quot;Eurylina&quot; clings to coral branches to browse on the polyps.

===Respiration===
Gas exchange and excretion occur through cilia-lined sacs called bursae; each opens between the arm bases on the underside of the disk. Typically ten bursae are found, and each fits between two stomach digestive pouches. Water flows through the bursae by means of cilia or muscular contraction. Oxygen is transported through the body by the hemal system, a series of sinuses and vessels distinct from the water vascular system.

The bursae are probably also the main organs of excretion, with phagocytic &quot;coelomocytes&quot; collecting waste products in the body cavity and then migrating to the bursae for expulsion from the body.

===Musculoskeletal system===
Like all echinoderms, the Ophiuroidea possess a skeleton of calcium carbonate in the form of calcite. In ophiuroids, the calcite ossicles are fused to form armor plates which are known collectively as the &quot;test&quot;. The plates are covered by the epidermis, which consists of a smooth syncytium. In most species, the joints between the ossicles and superficial plates allow the arm to bend to the side, but cannot bend upwards. However, in the basket stars, the arms are flexible in all directions.

Both the &quot;Ophiurida&quot; and &quot;Euryalida&quot; (the basket stars) have five long, slender, flexible, whip-like arms, up to 60 cm in length. They are supported by an internal skeleton of calcium carbonate plates referred to as vertebral ossicles. These &quot;vertebrae&quot; articulate by means of ball-and-socket joints, and are controlled by muscles. They are essentially fused plates which correspond to the parallel ambulacral plates in sea stars and five Paleozoic families of ophiuroids. In modern forms, the vertebrae occur along the median of the arm.

The ossicles are surrounded by a relatively thin ring of soft tissue, and then by four series of jointed plates, one each on the upper, lower, and lateral surfaces of the arm. The two lateral plates often have a number of elongated spines projecting outwards; these help to provide traction against the substrate while the animal is moving. The spines, in ophiuroids, compose a rigid border to the arm edges, whereas in euryalids they are transformed into downward-facing clubs or hooklets. Euryalids are similar to ophiurids, if larger, but their arms are forked and branched. &quot;Ophiuroid podia&quot; generally function as sensory organs. They are not usually used for feeding, as in &quot;Asteroidea&quot;. In the Paleozoic era, brittle stars had open ambulacral grooves, but in modern forms, these are turned inward.

In living ophiuroids, the vertebrae are linked by well-structured longitudinal muscles. Ophiuroida moves horizontally, and &quot;Euryalina&quot; species moves vertically. The latter have bigger vertebrae and smaller muscles. They are less spasmodic, but can coil their arms around objects, holding on even after death. These movement patterns are distinct to the taxa, separating them. Ophiuroida moves quickly when disturbed. One arm presses ahead, whereas the other four act as two pairs of opposite levers, thrusting the body in a series of rapid jerks. Although adults do not use their tube feet for locomotion, very young stages use them as stilts and even serve as an adhesive structure.

==Reproduction==
The sexes are separate in most species, though a few are hermaphroditic or protandric. The gonads are located in the disk, and open into pouches between the arms, called genital bursae. Fertilization is external in most species, with the gametes being shed into the surrounding water through the bursal sacs. An exception is the Ophiocanopidae, in which the gonads do not open into bursae and are instead paired in a chain along the basal arm joints.

Many species brood developing larvae in the bursae, effectively giving birth to live young. A few, such as &quot;Amphipholus squamata&quot;, are truly viviparous, with the embryo receiving nourishment from the mother through the wall of the bursa. However, some species do not brood their young, and instead have a free-swimming larval stage. Referred to as an ophiopluteus, these larvae have four pairs of rigid arms lined with cilia. They develop directly into an adult, without the attachment stage found in most starfish larvae. The number of species exhibiting ophiopluteus larvae are fewer than those that directly develop.

In a few species, the female carries a dwarf male, clinging to it with the mouth.

===Fission===
Some brittle stars, such as the six-armed members of the family Ophiactidae, exhibit fissiparity (division through fission), with the disk splitting in half. Regrowth of both the lost part of the disk and the arms occur which yields an animal with three large arms and three small arms during the period of growth.

The West Indian brittle star, &quot;Ophiocomella ophiactoides&quot;, frequently undergoes asexual reproduction by fission of the disk with subsequent regeneration of the arms. In both summer and winter, large numbers of individuals with three long arms and three short arms can be found. Other individuals have half a disk and only three arms. A study of the age range of the population indicates little recruitment and fission is the primary means of reproduction in this species.

In this species, fission appears to start with the softening of one side of the disk and the initiation of a furrow. This deepens and widens until it extends across the disk and the animal splits in two. New arms begin to grow before the fission is complete, thus minimizing the time between possible successive divisions. The plane of fission varies so that some newly formed individuals have existing arms of different lengths. The time period between successive divisions is 89 days, so theoretically, each brittle star can produce 15 new individuals during the course of a year.

===Life span===
Brittle stars generally sexually mature in two to three years, become full grown in three to four years, and live up to five years. Members of Euryalina, such as &quot;Gorgonocephalus&quot;, may live much longer.

===Regeneration===

Ophiuroids can readily regenerate lost arms or arm segments unless all arms are lost. Ophiuroids use this ability to escape predators, in a way similar to lizards which deliberately shed the distal part of their tails to confuse pursuers. Moreover, the Amphiuridae can regenerate gut and gonad fragments lost along with the arms. Discarded arms have not been shown to have the ability to regenerate.

==Locomotion==
Brittle stars use their arms for locomotion. Brittle stars move fairly rapidly by wriggling their arms which are highly flexible and enable the animals to make either snake-like or rowing movements. However, they tend to attach themselves to the sea floor or to sponges or cnidarians, such as coral. 
They move as if they were bilaterally symmetrical, with an arbitrary leg selected as the symmetry axis and the other four used in propulsion. The axial leg may be facing or trailing the direction of motion, and due to the radially symmetrical nervous system, can be changed whenever a change in direction is necessary.
==Bioluminescence==
Over 60 species of brittle stars are known to be bioluminescent. Most of these produce light in the green wavelengths, although a few blue-emitting species have also been discovered. Both shallow-water and deep-sea species of brittle stars are known to produce light. Presumably, this light is used to deter predators.

==Ecology==
Brittle stars live in areas from the low-tide level downwards. Six families live at least 2 m deep; the genera &quot;Ophiura&quot;, &quot;Amphiophiura&quot;, and &quot;Ophiacantha&quot; range below 4 m. Shallow species live among sponges, stones, or coral, or under the sand or mud, with only their arms protruding. Two of the best-known shallow species are the green brittle star (&quot;Ophioderma brevispina&quot;), found from Massachusetts to Brazil, and the common European brittle star (&quot;Ophiothrix fragilis&quot;). Deep-water species tend to live in or on the sea floor or adhere to coral, urchins, or xenophyophores. The most widespread species is the long-armed brittle star (&quot;Amphipholis squamata&quot;), a grayish or bluish, strongly luminescent species.

===Parasites===
The main parasite to enter the digestive tract or genitals are protozoans. Crustaceans, nematodes, trematodes, and polychaete annelids also serve as parasites. Algal parasites such as &quot;Coccomyxa ophiurae&quot; cause spinal malformation. Unlike in sea stars and sea urchins, annelids are not typical parasites.

== Diversity and taxonomy ==

Between and species of brittle stars are currently known, but the total number of modern species may be over . This makes brittle stars the most abundant group of current echinoderms (before sea stars). Around 270 genera are known, these are distributed in 16 families, which makes them at the same time a relatively poorly diversified group structurally, compared with the other echinoderms. For example, 467 species belong to the sole family of Amphiuridae (frail brittle stars which live buried in the sediment leaving only their arms in the stream to capture the plankton). There are also 344 species in the family of Ophiuridae.

===Fossil record===
The first known brittle stars date from Early Ordovician. Study of past distribution and evolution of brittle stars has been hampered by the tendency of dead brittle stars to disarticulate and scatter, providing poor brittle star fossils. Until discoveries in the Agrio Formation of Neuquén Basin in the 2010s no fossil brittle star was known in the Southern Hemisphere, nor was any brittle star of Cretaceous age known.

Silurian fossils from a minor mass extinction called the Mulde event shows the ancestors of modern brittle stars went though a bottleneck, where a miniaturization caused by paedomorphosis led to structural simplification of their skeletal anatomy. These traits affected their further evolution. As they began to increase in size again, so did their complexity. The first large-sized modern brittle star originated in the Early Carboniferous.

==Human relations==
Brittle stars are not used as food, though they are not toxic, because of their strong skeleton.

Even if some species have blunt spines, no brittlestar is known to be dangerous, nor venomous. There is no harm evidence towards humans, and even with their predators, brittlestars&#x27; only means of defense is escaping or discarding an arm.

===Aquaria===
Brittle stars are a moderately popular invertebrate in fishkeeping. They can easily thrive in marine tanks; in fact, the micro brittle star is a common &quot;hitchhiker&quot; that will propagate and become common in almost any saltwater tank, if one happens to come along on some live rock.

Larger brittle stars are popular because, unlike Asteroidea, they are not generally seen as a threat to coral, and are also faster-moving and more active than their more archetypical cousins.

<doc id="890331" wikidata="Q4913347" url="?curid=890331" title="Billy Sullivan (1900s catcher)">
<text>William Joseph Sullivan, Sr. (February 1, 1875 – January 28, 1965) was an American professional baseball player and manager. He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball, most notably as a member of the Chicago White Sox with whom he won a World Series championship in 1906. Although he was a relatively weak hitter, he sustained a sixteen-year playing career by being one of the best defensive catchers of his era.

Sullivan&#x27;s reputation as a defensive standout is enhanced because of the era in which he played. In the Deadball Era, catchers played a huge defensive role, given the large number of bunts and stolen base attempts, as well as the difficulty of handling the spitball pitchers who dominated pitching staffs. He had to catch every type of pitch imaginable, such as shine balls, spitballs, knuckleballs, and emery balls.

==Early life==
William Joseph Sullivan was born on February 1, 1875, in the town of Oakland, Wisconsin, to Irish immigrant farmers. He attended Fort Atkinson High School, where he played mainly as an infielder until their regular catcher could not play due to an injury. Sullivan substituted and excelled; so much so that he began being scouted by a local amateur team.

After his graduation from high school, Sullivan played for an independent team located in Edgewater, Wisconsin. He played on his first professional team in 1896 for the Cedar Rapids Bunnies of the Western Association, a Class-B minor league. He stayed in the Western Association for the 1897 season, playing for the Dubuque, Iowa, representative. In 124 games played that season, he batted just .216, but did hit seven home runs and stole 27 bases.

Sullivan then transferred to the Class-A Western League in 1898 to play for the Columbus Buckeyes, also referred to as the Senators, and had a .276 batting average in 68 games played. He stayed with the Buckeyes to begin the 1899 season, though he later moved with the team to Grand Rapids, Michigan; they then became known as the Furniture Makers. He was hitting .306 after 83 games when he was sold to the Boston Beaneaters of the National League for $1000.

==Major-league career==
Sullivan made his major league debut with the Beaneaters on September 13, 1899, at the age of 24, and became their regular catcher, appearing in 22 games the rest of season. On September 27, against the Washington Senators, he hit his first major league home run; a three-run home run in the bottom of the fifth inning off of Bill Magee. In 1900, Sullivan hit 8 home runs, the fifth highest total in the National League.

Sullivan then joined the Chicago White Sox of the American League in 1901. He played as catcher in the American League&#x27;s first game as a major league, an 8-2 Chicago victory over Cleveland on April 24, 1901. He helped guide the White Sox pitching staff to the lowest team earned run average in the league as they went on to win the American League championship. Sullivan&#x27;s pitch-calling skills were evident in 1904 as the White Sox led the league with 26 shutouts. He caught for two twenty-game winning pitchers in 1905, with Nick Altrock winning 23 games and Frank Owen winning 21 games. Frank Smith added 19 wins and Doc White provided another 17 victories as the White Sox once again led the league in earned run average. The team battled the Philadelphia Athletics in a tight pennant race and were tied for first place with 11 games left in the season before faltering to finish the season in second place.
Sullivan was a member of the 1906 White Sox team that became known as the &quot;Hitless Wonders&quot; when they won the American League pennant despite posting the lowest team batting average in the league. The team had been in fourth place by the end of July, games behind the defending champion Athletics, when they went on a 19-game winning streak that drove them into first place. No American League team would surpass the 19-game winning streak for almost 100 years until the 2002 Oakland Athletics won 20 consecutive games. The team made up for their lack of hitting prowess by leading the league in walks, hit batsmen and sacrifice hits. Sullivan tied for the team lead in home runs with two. He led American League catchers in baserunners caught stealing, finished second in putouts and assists and guided the White Sox pitching staff to a league-leading 32 shutouts and the second lowest earned run average in the league. The White Sox then defeated their cross-town rivals, the heavily favored Chicago Cubs in the 1906 World Series. Sullivan was literally hitless for the &quot;Hitless Wonders,&quot; going 0-for-21 at the plate in the Series.

In 1907, Sullivan caught for three twenty-game winning pitchers, as Doc White won 27 games, Ed Walsh won 24 games and Frank Smith won 23 games. The White Sox once again led the league in earned run average, however, they fell to third in the season standings. Sullivan&#x27;s catching credentials were embellished by his association with future Baseball Hall of Fame member, Walsh, who would win 40 games in 1908, as the White Sox once again led the league in shutouts. The White Sox were in contention until losing the final game of the season to the eventual American League champions, the Detroit Tigers. He served as a player-manager for the White Sox in 1909, guiding the team to a fourth-place finish. The following season, Hugh Duffy took over as manager and Sullivan returned to catching.

Sullivan was the White Sox catcher on July 1, 1910, when the team inaugurated their new stadium, Comiskey Park, named after the team owner, Charles Comiskey. On August 24, 1910, Sullivan caught three baseballs thrown by Ed Walsh from a window at the top of the Washington Monument as a publicity stunt, matching the feat by Washington catcher Gabby Street two years earlier. By 1912, the 37-year-old Sullivan&#x27;s performance began to decline as future Hall of Fame member, Ray Schalk, emerged as his successor. He spent the 1913 and 1914 seasons as a coach, tutoring Schalk before being given his unconditional release on February 15, 1915.

Sullivan returned to the minor leagues in 1915, playing one season for the Minneapolis Millers, helping them win the American Association pennant. He rejoined the major leagues in 1916, appearing in one game with the Detroit Tigers, before retiring as a player at the age of 41.

While Sullivan was not a very good hitter, it was his performance as a fielder that garnered him high praise from his peers. Ty Cobb, Hall of Fame outfielder of the Detroit Tigers and former all-time major league leader in stolen bases, once described him as the hardest catcher on which to attempt a steal.

==Managerial record==
==Career statistics==
In a sixteen-year major league career, Sullivan played in 1,147 games, accumulating 777 hits in 3,647 at bats for a .213 career batting average along with 21 home runs, 378 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .254. He led American League catchers three times in fielding percentage and ended his career with a .976 average, which was 12 points above the league average during his playing career. Sullivan also led American League catchers twice in baserunners caught stealing and caught stealing percentage, and once in assists. His 952 baserunners caught stealing ranks him 11th on the all-time list for major league catchers. Sullivan also ranks 11th overall among major league catchers in shutouts caught during his career. He was also durable, leading league catchers in games played three times, while consistently within the top three most of his career.

==Later life==
After his retirement from baseball, the Jefferson County, Wisconsin, native retired in Newberg, Oregon, where he farmed twenty acres of land and became the president of a local fruit growers&#x27; association. Upon the occasion of his induction into the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1956, Sullivan was honored with a plaque at the Milwaukee County Stadium. He died of a heart ailment on January 28, 1965, at the age of 89. Although news reports at the time of Sullivan&#x27;s death credited him as the inventor of the catcher&#x27;s chest protector, this was disputed by author Peter Morris in his book, &quot;Catcher&quot;, in which he states that catchers first began using chest protectors during the 1880s. Sullivan did however, receive a United States patent in 1908 for an inflatable, contoured chest protector, which protected his body better and, thanks to hinging, allowed more freedom of movement than the normal model.

His son, Billy Sullivan, Jr., also became a major league catcher. When Billy Sullivan Jr. caught for the Detroit Tigers in the 1940 World Series, the Sullivans became the first father and son to have played in the World Series.

<text>Arnold Spencer Leese (16 November 1878 – 18 January 1956) was a British fascist politician. Leese was initially prominent as a veterinary expert on camels. A virulent anti-Semite, he led his own fascist movement, the Imperial Fascist League, and was a prolific author and publisher of polemics both before and after the Second World War.

==Early life and education==
Leese was born on 16 November 1878 in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, England, the son of Spencer Leese, a manufacturer and artist. He was a nephew of Sir Joseph Francis Leese, 1st Baronet (1845–1914), and a second cousin of Sir Oliver Leese, 3rd Baronet (1894–1978).

Leese was educated at Giggleswick School. An only child, his childhood was characterised by loneliness. The death of his father in 1894 left the family in financial difficulties, forcing Leese to leave boarding school. He nonetheless attended the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons thanks to the financial help of his grandfather.

== Veterinary career ==
After graduating in 1903, Leese first worked as an equine clinician in London, then accepted a post at the Civil Veterinary Department in India in 1907, where he became an expert on the camel. He worked in India for six years, largely along the North-West Frontier, then was transferred to Italian Somaliland to work for the East Africa Government&#x27;s veterinary department, where he was posted at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.

Leese was recognised as a leading authority on the camel and published several articles on this animal and its maladies, the first appearing in &quot;The Journal of Tropical Veterinary Science&quot; in 1909. A camel parasite, &quot;Thelazia leesei&quot; was named after him by Louis-Joseph Alcide Railliet in 1910. In 1927, he published &quot;A Treatise on the One-Humped Camel in Health and in Disease&quot;, which would remain a standard work in India for fifty years.

During the First World War, Leese was commissioned in the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, then served as a Camel Purchase Officer to the Somaliland Remount Commission with the Camel Corps, and in France on the Western Front as a Veterinary Officer for the Advanced Horse Transport Depot. During the war, he married May Winifred King, the daughter of his former landlord. Leese returned to England and settled in Stamford, Lincolnshire, practising as a vet until retirement in June 1928.

==Fascist activist==
In the early 1920s, Leese became interested in Italian Fascism and he developed a fascination with the Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. In April 1923, he wrote a short pamphlet, &quot;Fascism for Old England&quot;, praising the Duce and highlighting the &quot;significance of fascism for Britain&quot;. He joined the British Fascists (BF) soon after its creation in May 1923, establishing his own branch in Stamford in March 1924, which soon gained 80 members. Leese despised however the BF policy of allowing former socialists and Jews in the party, contending that it was &quot;honeycombed&quot; with communist infiltrators. He further wrote that the BF &quot;did not understand Fascism at all&quot;, the true nature of which was to Leese a &quot;revolt against democracy and a return to statesmanship&quot;. An animal lover, he also claimed that the style of slaughter practised in Judaism influenced his anti-semitism.

Leese joined the &quot;Centre International d&#x27;Études sur le Fascisme&quot; (CINEF), an international &#x27;think tank&#x27; based in Switzerland whose aim was the promotion of fascism, and served as its British correspondent. He also became close to one of his neighbours, the economist Arthur Kitson, a member of The Britons. Their friendship lasted until Kitson&#x27;s death in 1937. The latter persuaded Leese that control of money was the key to power and that money was ultimately controlled by the Jews. Kitson supplied him with a copy of the &quot;Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot;, on which Leese wrote, &quot;Everything in this little book rang true, I simply could not put it down until I had finished it.&quot; Leese also revered The Britons&#x27; founder Henry Hamilton Beamish as an anti-Jewish &quot;pioneer&quot;. In 1924, he was elected a councillor to Stamford Borough Council along with fellow fascist Harry Simpson, becoming the first elected fascist councillors in Britain. The British Fascists had generally chosen not to intervene in &quot;the despised democratic system&quot;, and Leese&#x27;s own contempt for democracy seems to have been paradoxically reinforced by the election. He wrote, &quot;Many people I knew voted for me because I had cured their pigs or pets and without the slightest idea what I stood for&quot;.

Leese was generally unsatisfied with the policies of the British Fascists, dismissing them as &quot;conservatism with knobs on&quot;. In 1925, he and Simpson joined a splinter group of the BF, the National Fascisti (NF), renamed in July 1926 the British National Fascists (BNF). Leese took the Stamford BF branch over to the BNF and, following the collapse of the BNF in May 1927, founded the &#x27;Fascist League&#x27; from the remnants of the Stamford BNF. In October 1927, he stepped down as a councillor after having served a single term, and retired in June 1928, at 50, before moving to Guildford, Surrey.

==Imperial Fascist League==

In 1929, Leese established his own organization, the Imperial Fascist League (IFL). The movement was initially modelled more along the lines of Italian fascism but, under the influence of Henry Hamilton Beamish, it began to focus on anti-semitism. The IFL and its extensive publishing interests were funded out of Leese&#x27;s own pocket. In 1932, Oswald Mosley approached Leese with the aim of absorbing the IFL into his own British Union of Fascists. Although relations between the two men were initially cordial (Leese had addressed a New Party meeting on 27 April 1932 on the theme of &quot;The Blindness of British Politics under the Jew Money-Power&quot; that was chaired by Mosley), Leese soon attacked Mosley for his failure to deal with the &quot;Jewish question&quot;, and he eventually labelled Mosley&#x27;s group &quot;kosher fascists&quot;.

Leese&#x27;s anti-semitism had become his defining political characteristic by that point and it came to take on an increasingly conspiratorial and hysterical tone. This increased after Leese visited Germany and met Julius Streicher, and he subsequently remodelled the IFL newspaper &quot;The Fascist&quot; along the lines of &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;. His antisemitism took on the theme of the Aryan race as the creator of civilisation and culture and he claimed that the Aryan was in a permanent struggle with the Jew, the outcome of which would determine the future completely. Leese&#x27;s views, which extended to proposing the mass murder of Jews by the use of gas chambers as early as 1935, earned him a prison sentence in 1936. In 1936, Leese and fellow IFL member and printer Walter Whitehead were tried on six counts related to two articles published in the July issue of &quot;The Fascist&quot; entitled &quot;Jewish Ritual Murder&quot;, which later appeared as a pamphlet. They were found guilty on two counts. Leese was sentenced to six months in prison for seditious libel &quot;with intent to create ill will between his Majesty&#x27;s subjects of the Jewish faith and those not of the Jewish faith so as to create a public mischief.&quot; Whitehead was fined £20. The judge berated Leese at sentencing.&quot;I am satisfied that nothing can be more mischievous to the public weal than the circulation of statements of this kind. I can appreciate that behind what you have done there is possibly a belief amounting in its intensity almost to fanaticism with regard to the truth or otherwise of these statements.  That the public well-being can be served by the publication of stuff of this kind -- and I call it &quot;stuff&quot; advisably -- I cannot imagine.  Nothing can be more harmful to the public weal than that.&quot;Upon his release, he edited another pamphlet entitled &quot;My Irrelevant Defence&quot;, a lengthy work in defence of his earlier claim that Jewish Passover celebrations included the sacrifice of Christian children. He also used materials distributed by the &quot;Welt-Dienst&quot; news service headed by Ulrich Fleischhauer and wrote for it.

==Second World War==

Leese was one of the last leaders of the fascist movement to be interned in the United Kingdom at the beginning of the Second World War under the Defence Regulation 18B. Leese, who claimed that his primary loyalty was to Britain, had been somewhat critical of Adolf Hitler since the start of the war and he reacted with bitter anger when an internment order was issued for him in June 1940. Having set up a series of hideouts from which he published several pamphlets that were critical of the war, he evaded capture until 9 November 1940. Still enraged by what he saw as a slur on his patriotism, Leese violently resisted arrest and smashed up his holding cell. Leese saw the war as a &quot;Jew&#x27;s War&quot; but he strongly repudiated the Hitler-Stalin Pact and castigated the Nazis for their invasion of Norway. (Leese labelled his political creed &quot;Racial Fascism&quot; because he disliked the term &quot;National Socialism&quot; which was used by the Nazis, although he and other members of the IFL supported Nazi anti-semitism). He was released from detention in 1944 on health grounds following a major operation.

At the close of the War, he offered to testify at William Joyce&#x27;s trial. Along with Beamish he was prepared to give evidence on the &quot;Jewish issue&quot; at Nuremberg in defence of the Nazis. Leese described the Nuremberg Trials as a &quot;Jewish and Masonic affair, like the procedure in this country under &#x27;18.B&#x27;; it is an act of Revenge&quot;.

==Post-war activity==
Soon after the end of the Second World War, Leese set up his own &quot;Jewish Information Bureau&quot; and began publishing his own journal, &quot;Gothic Ripples&quot;, which was largely concerned with attacking the Jews. He believed that there were 2.5m Jews in Britain at the time, seven times the actual number. The magazine also contained a strongly anti-black racist bent, with a regular column entitled &quot;Nigger Notes&quot; appearing. &quot;Gothic Ripples&quot; was an early proponent of what would come to be known as Holocaust denial, noting in 1953 that &quot;The fable of the slaughter of six million Jews by Hitler has never been tackled by &quot;Gothic Ripples&quot; because we take the view that we would have liked Hitler even better if the figure had been larger; we are so &#x27;obsessed with anti-semitism&#x27; that we believe that as long as the destruction was done in a humane manner, it was to the advantage of everyone ... if it had been true. However, it wasn&#x27;t.&quot;

In 1946, Leese and six others, Emanuel John William Alford, Leslie Raymond Alford, Alfred McCarthy, Alfred John Robert McCarthy, Frederick Tom Edmunds, and Anthony William Gittens, were arrested for aiding two escaped Dutch prisoners of war who had been members of the Waffen-SS and were planning to flee to Argentina. At his trial, Edmunds openly admitted that he was a fascist. Gittens had joined the Britons in 1924, and served as its secretary from 1950 until his death in 1973. He joined the Imperial Fascist League in the 1930s and founded their branch in Kentish Town. In the late 1960s, he joined the National Front and worked closed with its founder, A. K. Chesterton.

Leese and his six accomplices were each found guilty sentenced to one year in prison for their roles in the attempted escape. Leese was released from prison in November 1947. In 1948, Leese formed the National Workers Movement in London. In December 1950 he stood trial for criminal libel on Harold Scott, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, but was acquitted. In 1951, he published his autobiography &quot;Out of Step: Events in the Two Lives of an Anti-Jewish Camel Doctor&quot;.

Leese acted as mentor to Colin Jordan and John Tyndall, the &quot;most significant figures on the extreme right since the 1960s&quot;. After his death, his widow, May Winifred Leese (died 1974), helped fund far-right groups. His London house, 74 Princedale Road, Holland Park, was left to Jordan, and became known as &#x27;Arnold Leese House&#x27;. The property became Jordan&#x27;s base of operations, housing the White Defence League, the National Socialist Movement and other far-right operations.

Leese died 18 January 1956, aged 77.

<text>Discount stores offer a retail format in which products are sold at prices that are in principle lower than an actual or supposed &quot;full retail price&quot;. Discounters rely on bulk purchasing and efficient distribution to keep down costs.
==Types (United States)==
Discount stores in the United States may be classified into different types:

===Hypermarkets (superstores)===
Discount superstores such as Walmart or Target sell general merchandise in a big-box store; many have a full grocery selection and are thus hypermarkets, though that term is not generally used in North America. In the 1960s and 1970s the term &quot;discount department store&quot; was used, and chains such as Kmart, Zodys and TG&amp;Y billed themselves as such. The term &quot;discount department store&quot; or &quot;off-price department store&quot; is sometimes applied to big-box discount retailers of apparel and home goods, such as Ross Dress for Less, Marshalls, TJ Maxx, and Burlington.

===Category killers===
So-called category killer stores, specialize in one type of merchandise and sell it in big-box stores. Examples include:
*Apparel: Ross Dress for Less, Marshalls, Burlington, etc.
*Pet supplies: Petco, PetSmart
*Home furnishings and accessories: Big Lots, HomeGoods
*Office supplies: Staples, Office Depot, OfficeMax

===Warehouse clubs===
When membership is required, discount superstores are known as warehouse clubs, and often require purchases of larger sizes or quantities of goods than a regular superstore. The main national chains, both of which have operations outside the U.S., are Costco and Sam&#x27;s Club.

===Discount grocery store===
Major discount grocery store retail chains in the U.S. include Aldi, Lidl, Save-A-Lot and Grocery Outlet. Currently Aldi and Lidl are the largest discount retailers in the world operating more than 25,000 discount stores worldwide between them.

===Variety stores, dollar stores, five and dimes===
Variety stores in the U.S. today, are most commonly known as dollar stores such as Dollar General, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree, which sell goods usually only at a single price-point or multiples thereof (£1, $2, etc.). During the early and mid-twentieth century they were commonly known as &quot;five and dimes&quot; or &quot;dime stores&quot;. Stores of the main chains, Woolworth&#x27;s, J. J. Newberry and S. S. Kresge, lined the shopping streets of U.S. downtowns and suburbs, and starting in the 1950s they also opened branches in shopping malls. These chains originally sold items for 5, 10 or 25 cents, but many later moved to a model with flexible price points, with a variety of general merchandise at discounted prices, in formats smaller than today&#x27;s discount superstores.

==History==
===United States===
During the period from the 1950s to the late 1980s, discount stores were more popular than the average supermarket or department store in the United States. There were hundreds of discount stores in operation, with their most successful period occurring during the mid-1960s in the U.S. with discount store chains such as Kmart, Ames, Two Guys, Gibson&#x27;s Discount Center, E. J. Korvette, Mammoth Mart, Fisher&#x27;s Big Wheel, Zayre, Bradlees, Caldor, Jamesway, Howard Brothers Discount Stores, Kuhn&#x27;s-Big K (sold to Walmart in 1981), TG&amp;Y and Woolco (closed in 1983, part sold to Wal-Mart) among others.

Walmart, Kmart, and Target all opened their first locations in 1962. Kmart was a venture of S. S. Kresge Company that was a major operator of dime stores. Other retail companies branched out into the discount store business around that time as adjuncts to their older store concepts. As examples, Woolworth opened a Woolco chain (also in 1962); Montgomery Ward opened Jefferson Ward; Chicago-based Jewel-Osco launched Turn Style; and Central Indiana-based L. S. Ayres created Ayr-Way. J. C. Penney opened discount stores called Treasure Island or The Treasury; Sheboygan, Wisconsin based H. C. Prange Co. opened a chain of discount stores called Prange Way, and Atlanta-based Rich&#x27;s owned discount stores called Richway.

During the late 1970s and the 1980s, these chains typically were either shut down or sold to a larger competitor. Kmart and Target themselves are examples of adjuncts, although their growth prompted their respective parent companies to abandon their older concepts (the S. S. Kresge five and dime store disappeared, while the Dayton-Hudson Corporation eventually divested itself of its department store holdings and renamed itself Target Corporation). 

In the United States, discount stores had 42% of the overall retail market share in 1987; in 2010, they had 87%.

Many of the major discounters now operate &quot;supercenters&quot;, which adds a full-service grocery store to the traditional format. The Meijer chain in the Midwest consists entirely of supercenters, while Wal-Mart and Target have focused on the format as of the 1990s as a key to their continued growth. Although discount stores and department stores have different retailing goals and different markets, a recent development in retailing is the &quot;discount department store&quot;, such as Sears Essentials, which is a combination of the Kmart and Sears formats, after the companies&#x27; merger as Sears Holdings Corporation.

===Canada===
Woolworths entered Canada in the 1920s, the stores were converted to the Foot Locker, Champs Sports and other stores in 1994. Kresge&#x27;s, a competitor to Woolworth&#x27;s entered the Canadian market in 1929.

Zellers was founded in 1931, and was acquired by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1978. Giant Tiger opened its first store in Ottawa in 1961, modeled on Woolworths. Winners was founded in 1982 in Toronto, and sells off-price brand clothing. Costco entered Canada in 1986. In 1990, the American chain Walmart purchased the Woolco chain in Canada and converted the stores into Walmarts. Dollarama was founded in Quebec in 1992. In 1998, Zellers bought out Kmart Canada, taking over its stores.

In 2011, Marshalls, owned by the American TJX Companies, entered Canada, and Zellers sold most of its stores to Target. Target Canada filed for bankruptcy in 2015, selling its stores to Walmart, Lowe&#x27;s and Canadian Tire.

In 2016, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company started opening Saks Off 5th locations to sell off-price brands. American off-price chain Nordstrom Rack opened its first Canadian location in Vaughan Mills in 2018.

It was officially named in 1935 after the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle by the International Astronomical Union, using the classical form of his name.

To the immediate south of Aristoteles lies the slightly smaller crater Eudoxus, and these two form a distinctive pair for a telescope observer. An arc of mountains between these craters bends to the west before joining the walls. The smaller crater Mitchell is directly attached to the eastern rim of Aristoteles. To the west is the low, flooded feature Egede.

Observers have noted the crater wall of Aristoteles is slightly distorted into a rounded hexagon shape. The inner walls are wide and finely . The outer s display a generally radial structure of hillocks through the extensive blanket of &quot;ejecta&quot;. The crater floor is uneven and covered in hilly ripples. Aristoteles does possess small central peaks but they are somewhat offset to the south. The interior floor appears to have been filled with a layer of material partially burying these projections.

It is characterised by an extremely high rockfall density by lunar standards.

Aristoteles is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Aristoteles.

<doc id="890353" wikidata="Q1514769" url="?curid=890353" title="PyGTK">
<text>PyGTK is a set of Python wrappers for the GTK graphical user interface library. PyGTK is free software and licensed under the LGPL. It is analogous to PyQt/PySide and wxPython, the Python wrappers for Qt and wxWidgets, respectively. Its original author is GNOME developer James Henstridge. There are six people in the core development team, with various other people who have submitted patches and bug reports. PyGTK has been selected as the environment of choice for applications running on One Laptop Per Child systems.

PyGTK will be phased out with the transition to GTK version 3 and be replaced with PyGObject, which uses GObject Introspection to generate bindings for Python and other languages on the fly. This is expected to eliminate the delay between GTK updates and corresponding language binding updates, as well as reduce maintenance burden on the developers.

==Syntax==
The Python code below will produce a 200x200 pixel window with the words &quot;Hello World&quot; inside.
import gtk

def create_window():
 window = gtk.Window()
 window.set_default_size(200, 200)
 window.connect(&quot;destroy&quot;, gtk.main_quit)

 label = gtk.Label(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
 window.add(label)

 label.show()
 window.show()

create_window()
gtk.main()
===Notable applications that have used PyGTK===
PyGTK has been used in a number of notable applications, some examples:
* Anaconda installer
* BitTorrent
* Deluge
* Emesene
* Exaile
* Flumotion
* Gajim
* gDesklets
* Gedit (for optional Python subsystem and plugins)
* GIMP (for optional Python scripts)
* GNOME Sudoku
* Gramps
* Gwibber (microblogging client)
* Jokosher
* puddletag
* PyMusique
* Pybliographer
* Tryton
* ROX Desktop (includes ROX-Filer)
* SoundConverter
* Ubiquity (Ubuntu installer)
* Ubuntu Software Center
* Wing IDE
* Comix
==PyGObject==
PyGObject provides a wrapper for use in Python programs when accessing GObject libraries. GObject is an object system used by GTK, GLib, GIO, GStreamer and other libraries.

Like the GObject library itself, PyGObject is licensed under the GNU LGPL, so it is suitable for use in both free software and proprietary applications. It is already in use in many applications ranging from small single-purpose scripts to large full-featured applications.

PyGObject can dynamically access any GObject libraries that use GObject Introspection. It replaces the need for separate modules such as PyGTK, GIO and python-gnome to build a full GNOME 3.0 application. Once new functionality is added to GObject library it is instantly available as a Python API without the need for intermediate Python glue.

===Notable applications that use PyGObject===
PyGObject has replaced PyGTK, but it has taken a considerable amount of time for many programs to be ported. Most of the software listed here has an older version which used PyGTK.
* Gramps
* Meld
* Pitivi
* PyChess
* Quod Libet

<doc id="890358" wikidata="Q5739990" url="?curid=890358" title="Herman Long (baseball)">
<text>Herman C. Long (April 13, 1866 – September 16, 1909) was an American shortstop in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for the Kansas City Cowboys, Boston Beaneaters, New York Highlanders, Detroit Tigers, and Philadelphia Phillies. Long was known for his great fielding range as a shortstop, but he also holds the MLB career record for errors.

==Early life==
Born in 1866, Long was a native of Chicago. His parents are thought to have been German immigrants, as Long spoke fluent German. Little else is known about Long&#x27;s life up until he began playing minor league baseball in 1887 for a team in Arkansas City, Kansas. He played in Kansas City in 1888. After that season, the Kansas City team merged with the major league team in the same city.

==Major League Baseball career==
Long played for the Kansas City Cowboys (1889), Boston Beaneaters (1890–1902), New York Highlanders (1903), Detroit Tigers (1903), and Philadelphia Phillies (1904). From 1889 to 1902, he played over 100 games every year, had a batting average over .300 four times, and had an OPS+ over 100 seven times. He led the NL in runs scored in 1893 with 149, and he led the NL in home runs in 1900 with 12. Long helped the Beaneaters win National League championships in 1891, 1892, 1893, 1897, and 1898. During his time with the Beaneaters, he played in the infield along with first baseman Fred Tenney, second baseman Bobby Lowe, and third baseman Jimmy Collins; some considered that to be the greatest infield in baseball history. Between 1904 and 1906, Long was a player and player-manager in minor league baseball.

Long twice hit for the cycle, in 1896 and 1900, the first player in the Braves franchise to accomplish the feat. It was not matched for 121 years, until first baseman Freddie Freeman hit his second cycle during the 2021 season.

Tim Murnane, a former player-turned-baseball writer, wrote in 1894, &quot;Long is the most brilliant ball player on the field at the present time.&quot; In 1903, future Hall of Fame pitcher Kid Nichols said of Long, &quot;Herman Long is the greatest shortstop of them all. You can speak of your [Hughie] Jennings, and write of your [Jack] Glasscocks all you want, but this man Long at his best had them beat by a city block. Jennings was a brilliant ball player, and without doubt one of the leading players of the age, but this talk of his being better than Herman Long is all rot.&quot;

In the 2001 book &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, writer Bill James ranked Long as the 34th greatest shortstop of all-time. Long is the Braves&#x27; all-time leader with 434 stolen bases.

===Fielding===
Long holds the major league record for most errors in a career with 1,096. Only three other players have made more than 1,000 errors in their careers: Bill Dahlen, Deacon White, and Germany Smith. Of these four, White is in the Baseball Hall of Fame and Dahlen has been nominated for induction several times. Long&#x27;s total includes a record 1,070 errors committed while playing shortstop, making him the only player to commit more than 1,000 errors at one position. Despite the errors, Long fielded slightly better than the league average for a shortstop during his career, and he was considered an excellent fielder by his contemporaries. He led National League shortstops in fielding percentage in 1901 and 1902.

The seeming contradiction between a high number of errors and exceptional fielding skill is attributable to the fact that Long had a greater fielding range than most shortstops. He could get to balls batted to his left and right that other fielders would not have reached; a certain percentage of these difficult plays were mishandled, resulting in Long being charged with errors on grounders and flies that less mobile shortstops would not have touched (and on which they would not be charged with errors).

Another key factor contributing to Long&#x27;s relatively large total of career errors was the relative abundance of errors in 19th century professional baseball. In a typical game played in the 1800s, each team committed about ten errors (for a one-game combined total of about 20). The number of errors in MLB games declined throughout the 20th century, with less than one error per game in 2023.

==Death==
In August 1909, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Long was very sick. Several months earlier, he had moved to Denver, Colorado, because he was suffering from a lung condition. He died of tuberculosis the next month in Denver.

<text>The Monongahela National Forest is a national forest located in the Allegheny Mountains of eastern West Virginia, US. It protects over of federally managed land within a proclamation boundary that includes much of the Potomac Highlands Region and portions of 10 counties.

The Monongahela National Forest includes some major landform features such as the Allegheny Front and the western portion of the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. Within the forest boundaries lie some of the highest mountain peaks in the state, including the highest, Spruce Knob (4,863 ft). Spruce Knob is also the highest point in the Allegheny Mountains. Approximately 75 tree species are found in the forest. Almost all of the trees are a second growth forest, grown back after the land was heavily cut over around the start of the 20th century. Species for which the forest is important include red spruce (&quot;Picea rubens&quot;), balsam fir (&quot;Abies balsamea&quot;), and mountain ash (&quot;Sorbus americana&quot;).

The Monongahela National Forest includes eight U.S. Wilderness Areas and several special-use areas, notably the Spruce Knob–Seneca Rocks National Recreation Area.

The Monongahela National Forest encompasses most of the southern third of the Allegheny Mountains range (a section of the vast Appalachian Mountains range) and is entirely within the state of West Virginia. Elevations within the Monongahela National Forest range from about at Petersburg to at Spruce Knob. A rain shadow effect caused by slopes of the Allegheny Front results in of annual precipitation on the west side and about half that on the east side.

Headwaters of six major river systems are located within the forest: Monongahela, Potomac, Greenbrier, Elk, Tygart, and Gauley. Twelve rivers are currently under study for possible inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.

==Administration==
The main administrative headquarters is located in Elkins, West Virginia. The Monongahela also includes four ranger districts. The forest includes 105 permanent employees, seasonal employees, and volunteers.

Monongahela National Forest is currently divided into four ranger districts. The Cheat-Potomac and Marlinton-White Sulphur Springs were formed by combining their namesake districts; in the merged districts, the offices for both original districts were retained.
* Cheat-Potomac Ranger District, Headquarters: Parsons, West Virginia
** Office (former HQ, Potomac Ranger District) at Petersburg, West Virginia
* Gauley Ranger District, Headquarters: Richwood, West Virginia
* Greenbrier Ranger District, Headquarters: Bartow, West Virginia
* Marlinton-White Sulphur Springs Ranger District, Headquarters: Marlinton, West Virginia
** Office (former HQ, White Sulphur Springs Ranger District) at White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia

==History==
The Monongahela National Forest was established following the Weeks Act passage in 1911. This act authorized the purchase of land for long-term watershed protection and natural resource management following the massive cutting of the eastern forests in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1915, were acquired to begin the forest, called the &quot;Monongahela Purchase&quot;, and on April 28, 1920, it became the &quot;Monongahela National Forest&quot;. By the end of 1924, the Monongahela National Forest had total ownership of some .

Although white-tail deer never vanished from the Monongahela National Forest, from the 1890s to the 1920s their numbers dropped substantially. In January 1930, eight deer procured from Michigan were released into the forest near Parsons. From 1937 to 1939, a total of 17 more deer were released in the Flatrock-Roaring Plains area of the Forest. These releases served as the nucleus for reestablishing the healthy breeding populations of eastern West Virginia. (By the mid-1940s, deer were so numerous in the area that crop farmers had to patrol their fields by night.)

In 1943 and 1944, as part of the West Virginia Maneuver Area, the U.S. Army used parts of the Monongahela National Forest as a practice artillery and mortar range and maneuver area before troops were sent to Europe to fight in World War II. Artillery and mortar shells shot into the area for practice are still occasionally found there today. Seneca Rocks and other area cliffs were also used for assault climbing instruction. This was the Army&#x27;s only low-altitude climbing school.

The fisher (&quot;Pekania pennanti&quot;), believed to have been exterminated in the state by 1912, was reintroduced during the winter of 1969. At that time 23 fishers were translocated from New Hampshire to two sites within the boundaries of the Monongahela National Forest (at Canaan Mountain in Tucker County and Cranberry Glades in Pocahontas County).

In 1980, and again in 2005, the Monongahela National Forest was the venue for the annual counterculture Rainbow Gathering.

In 1993, the Craig Run East Fork Rockshelter and Laurel Run Rockshelter in the Gauley Ranger District were listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2011 West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin requested the National Park Service study the feasibility of transferring the northern portions of Monongahela National Forest to the NPS, including the Spruce Knob–Seneca Rocks National Recreation Area, the Dolly Sods Wilderness, and the Otter Creek Wilderness. Advocates had proposed the area be designated as High Allegheny National Park and Preserve. Interconnecting public lands would become Preserve Areas, where hunting would be allowed; and adjacent private working farms and forests would be eligible for voluntary Heritage Area conservation easements. In October 2011, the National Park Service announced a Reconnaissance Survey, to be conducted from January to September 2012, to &quot;determine whether the historic, natural, and recreational resources in the project area are &#x27;likely&#x27; or &#x27;unlikely&#x27; to meet congressionally required criteria for the designation of potential units of the National Park System&quot;.

Historic Civil War sites within the proposed park and preserve include the Rich Mountain Battlefield, Beverly Historic District, Cheat Summit Fort, Camp Bartow, and Camp Allegheny. The historic Blackwater Industrial Complex in Tucker County—preserving artifacts of the coal, coke and timber empire of early West Virginia entrepreneur and Senator Henry Gassaway Davis—would also be included.

In early 2012 Senator Manchin dropped his request for the study. Commentators on Manchin&#x27;s approach to the proposal had noted that &quot;the senator seemed to be in favor of a possible NPS label in the area only if there were no changes in existing land use or management practices&quot;. In February 2012, the NPS Director observed that some of Manchin&#x27;s requests were incompatible with longstanding NPS policy, saying in part that &quot;the continuation of extractive activities such as timber harvesting and oil and gas development would make the establishment of a national park infeasible&quot;.

==Ecology==
The forest is noted for its rugged landscape, views, blueberry thickets, highland bogs and &quot;sods&quot;, and open areas with exposed rocks. In addition to the second-growth forest trees, the wide range of botanical species found includes rhododendron, laurel on the moist west side of the Allegheny Front, and cactus and endemic shale barren species on the drier eastern slopes.

There are 230 known species of birds inhabiting the Monongahela National Forest: 159 are known to breed there, 89 are Neotropical migrants; 71 transit the forest during migration, but do not breed there, and 17 non-breeding species are Neotropical. The Brooks Bird Club (BBC) conducts an annual bird banding and survey project in the vicinity of Dolly Sods Scenic Area during migration (August – September). The forest provides habitat for 9 federally listed endangered or threatened species: 2 bird species, 2 bat species, 1 subspecies of flying squirrel, 1 salamander species, and 3 plant species. Fifty other species of rare/sensitive plants and animals also occur in the forest.

Larger animals and game species found in the forest include black bear, wild turkey, white-tailed deer, gray and fox squirrels, rabbits, snowshoe hare, woodcock, and grouse. Limited waterfowl habitat exists in certain places. Furbearers include beaver, red and gray fox, bobcat, fisher, river otter, raccoon and mink. Other hunted species include coyotes, skunks, opossums, woodchucks, crows, and weasels. There are 12 species of game (pan) fish and 60 species of nongame or forage fish. Some 90% of the trout waters of West Virginia are within the forest.

==Recreation==
The Monongahela National Forest is a recreation destination and tourist attraction, hosting approximately 3 million visitors annually. The backwoods road and trail system is used for hiking, mountain biking, horse riding. Many miles of railroad grades are a link in the recreation use of the forest. (The longest is the Glady to Durbin West Fork Railroad Trail which is long.) Recreation ranges from self-reliant treks in the wildernesses and backcountry areas, to rock climbing challenges, to traditional developed-site camping. Canoeing, hunting, trapping, fishing, and wildlife viewing are also common uses.

==Commercial resources==
The forest administration maintains wildlife and timber programs aimed at the responsible management of a mixed-age forest. About 81 percent of the total forest area is closed canopy forest over 60 years of age. The tree species most valuable for timber and wildlife food in the Monongahela National Forest are black cherry and oaks. The forest&#x27;s commercial timber sale program averages 30 mbf (thousand board feet) of timber sold per year with a yearly average value of $7.5 million. Various cutting techniques are used, from cutting single trees to clearcutting blocks up to in size. Regeneration cuts (clear-cuts or other treatments designed to start a new timber stand) occur on approximately yearly out of the more than forest total.

Mineral resources located in the Monongahela National Forest include coal, gas, limestone, and gravel. Sheep and cattle grazing occurs on about .

Receipts for timber, grazing, land uses, minerals, and recreation use averaged $4,840,466 annually between FY92 and FY96, and 25% of that (an average of $1,210,116 per year) was returned to counties that include Monongahela National Forest lands. This money is intended for use by local schools and roads. The remaining 75% each year is returned to the U.S. Treasury.

<text>Sutton-in-Ashfield is a market town in Nottinghamshire, England, with a population of 36,404 in 2021. It is the largest town in the district of Ashfield, four miles west of Mansfield, from the Derbyshire border and north of Nottingham.

==Geography==
For demographic purposes Sutton-in-Ashfield is included in the Mansfield Urban Area, although it administratively forms part of the separate council district of Ashfield, which is based in Kirkby-in-Ashfield. To the north is Teversal, Skegby and Stanton Hill.

==History==
The area was first settled in the Saxon times and the Saxon suffix &quot;ton&quot; means &quot;an enclosure or fenced in clearing&quot;. The town appears in the Domesday Book in 1086 as &quot;Sutone&quot;. There are also documents from 1189 showing that Gerard, son of Walter de Sutton, gave two bovates of land and the church at Sutton to Thurgarton Priory.

==Landmarks==

Sutton-in-Ashfield was home to what was the largest sundial in Europe. It was located in the middle of Portland Square, adjacent to the Idlewells Shopping Centre and Sutton Community Academy. The sundial was unveiled on 29 April 1995 and was removed in late 2024

Sutton-in-Ashfield Town Hall was opened in 1889, and later served as a cinema, before becoming the Regency Dance Centre.

The former site of Silverhill Colliery, close to the village of Teversal on the north-west edge of Ashfield, has been transformed from the colliery to a woodland. At the highest point is the &quot;Testing for Gas&quot; monument, by Antony Dufort, erected in 2024.

King&#x27;s Mill Hospital is between Sutton-in-Ashfield and Mansfield, next to the A38.
The town has a supermarket that, in April 1999, held the first blessing ceremony and reception to take place in a UK supermarket. It had been unable to get a wedding ceremony licence.

The Sherwood Observatory is located on the B6139 and is run by the Mansfield and Sutton Astronomical Society.

==Churches==
The Sutton-in-Ashfield area was first settled in Saxon times and the first records of a place of worship in the area date from Norman times (1170). As the population of the settlement grew so the variety of religious denominations represented increased. This was particularly true during the industrial expansion of the nineteenth century. The following is a list of the churches that still have a presence in Sutton, together with brief historical details.

===Church of St Mary Magdalene===
This Anglican church, situated off Lammas Road and built in local stone, contains a few parts that date back to 1170. The tower and spire date from 1395. However, much of the rest of the church was subject to re-building in the second half of the nineteenth century. The church is a Grade II* listed building.

By American searches, on 5 July 1607, Edward Fitzrandolph was baptised at St. Mary&#x27;s Church Sutton, marrying Elizabeth Blossom in Scituate, Massachusetts - they are Barack Obama&#x27;s 10x great-grandparents.

===Church of St Michael and All Angels===
This was another Anglican church in Sutton, situated at the junction of Outram Street with St Michael&#x27;s Street. The church was built in two stages. The first stage was designed by John Folwler of Louth and opened in 1887. The second stage was designed by Louis Ambler and completed in 1909. The church building is still standing but is no longer in use for worship.
===Church of St Joseph the Worker===
In the early part of the twentieth century, Catholics worshipped in one another&#x27;s homes or in a room above a garage off of Outram Street. In 1961, a full-size church was opened in Forest Street. This was designed in a Romanesque style with a 70 feet tall bell tower.

===Church of St John===
In 2015, Methodism in Sutton-in-Ashfield is represented by St John&#x27;s Methodist Church in Titchfield Avenue. This church was built (and later extended) in the twentieth century. Over the years, there have been Methodist churches in several locations around the town:
* There were Primitive Methodist churches on Mansfield Road (built 1866, now a Zion Baptist Church) and at New Cross (built 1895, now the Ecumenical Partnership Community Church).
* There was a Wesleyan Methodist Chapel on the south side of Outram Street. This was erected in 1882. An adjoining Sunday School in Welbeck Street was opened in 1904 and was demolished around 2011.

===United Reformed Church===
This church on High Pavement was opened in 1906. The architects of the building were G. Baines &amp; Son of London and the builders were J. Greenwood&#x27;s of Mansfield. Mainly because of the unusual nature of the pews inside, it is a Grade II Listed Building.

===New Cross Community Church===
This was built in 1895 as a Primitive Methodist Church. It is now run by the New Cross Community Church Anglican/Methodist Local Ecumenical Partnership.

===Zion Baptist Church===
This was built in 1866 as a Primitive Methodist Chapel. It is now a Zion Baptist Church and is closely associated with the adjoining Eastside Community Centre.

==Industry==

===Coal mining===
Sutton Colliery was actually outside of the town in Stanton Hill. It closed in 1989.

===Hosiery===
The Pretty Polly brand of hosiery originated in the town in around 1927, and was manufactured there on &quot;Unwin Road&quot; until April 2005. Samuel Eden Socks closed in July 2005.

===Distribution centre===
A major new employer arrived in the area when Amazon created in 2020 a new warehouse and distribution facility, known as a &quot;fulfilment centre&quot;, with the promise of 1,000 new vacancies. It is situated at Summit Park, just off the MARR road, on the outskirts of Sutton in Ashfield, close to the boundary with Mansfield. Mansfield&#x27;s MP Ben Bradley stated it was fortunate that the development would help to mitigate slightly the harmful financial effects of COVID-19 restrictions on the community.

==Transport==
===Road===
The town is located about two miles from Junction 28 of the M1 motorway and accessed via the A38. The A38 Bypass, which opened in 2005, is a wide single-carriageway that passes through much of the eastern part of the town, meeting the A619 Mansfield Bypass at Kings Mill. The former main road through the town centre is now identified as the B6023 and includes Alfreton Road, Lammas Road, Priestsic Road and Mansfield Road. Other main roads include Kirkby Road, Station Road, Huthwaite Road and Outram Street.

===Buses===
Sutton-in-Ashfield is served by Trentbarton which provides regular bus services from Nottingham, Mansfield and Derby and Stagecoach East Midlands with its Mansfield Miller 1 route between Mansfield and Alfreton, with service to the East Midlands Designer Outlet. The bus station is located next to the Idlewells Shopping Centre.

===Rail===
The town was served by five stations. Only one is now open:

*Sutton Junction on the Robin Hood Line which closed in the 1960s.
*Sutton Parkway which now serves the town on the Robin Hood Line which has since the 1990s provided the town with regular rail service between Nottingham and Worksop. The station is two miles south of the town centre at the junction of Low Moor Road (B6021) towards Kirkby-in-Ashfield and Penny Emma Way. The railway was formerly mostly used by the area&#x27;s pits, which closed in the early 1990s.
*Sutton-in-Ashfield Central was on the now-defunct Mansfield Railway and the station was located south of the town centre. The site is now occupied by a steel merchant.
*Sutton General which was on a very short branch from Sutton Junction. The station was closed to passengers in the 1920s and the site is now occupied by a retail store.
*Sutton-in-Ashfield Town which was on the branch line from Nottingham Victoria to Shirebrook North. The station closed in 1931 and the line in 1968. The site has been razed but the old abandoned station master&#x27;s house can be seen, in a state of decay. The line is now part of the Skegby Trail.

==Media==
===Television===
The town receives its television signals from various regional transmitters: Belmont (BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire/ITV Yorkshire East), Emley Moor (BBC Yorkshire/ITV Yorkshire West), and Waltham (BBC East Midlands/ITV Central). 
===Radio===
Local radio stations are BBC Radio Nottingham on 95.5 FM, Capital Midlands on 96.5 FM and community based station, Mansfield 103.2 FM which broadcast from nearby Mansfield. 
===Newspapers===
The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Mansfield and Ashfield Chad&quot;. 

==Recreation==

===Sport===

====Recreation facilities====

Sutton-in-Ashfield has had a public swimming pool since 1926. The first one was built on Brook Street and was paid for by the local Miners Welfare fund. Initially, the pool was only open during the summer months, with the pool being covered and used as a dancehall in the winter. In 1969, a new 25m-long pool (with high diving board and 4m deep end) was opened next door to the original pool (which was from then on used as a teaching pool). In the 1970s, as part of the construction of the Sutton Centre School, a public ice rink was provided. In 2008, the Brook Street swimming pools and the Sutton Centre ice rink were closed and the Lammas Leisure Centre on Lammas Road opened. The formal opening was performed by Dame Kelly Holmes. The Lammas Leisure Centre has 2 swimming pools (main and teaching), an ice rink (home to Sutton Sting Ice Hockey Academy), a gym, a multi-purpose sports hall and an indoor bowling green.

====Sports clubs====
There is a local athletics club, the Sutton-in-Ashfield Harriers &amp; Athletics Club, and swimming club associated with both local schools and the Lammas Leisure Centre itself. There is also the Coxmoor Golf Club on Coxmoor Road (B6139), next to the A611. As a result of local council grant applications for sport development, Sebastian Coe opened a new athletics track for the town at the nearby Ashfield School in February 2007.

====Sutton Town AFC====
Sutton Town was a football club founded in 1923. Known as the Snipes, the team was a member of the Midland League from 1923 to 1927. The club was reborn in 1958 and was a member of the Midland League until 1982 when the club became a founding member of the Northern Counties East League. In 1992, the team name was changed to Ashfield United, but the team folded after the 1996–97 season. North Notts Football Club began operations in 2000 as a member of the Central Midlands League, changing its name to Sutton Town AFC for the 2001–03 season. The team finished runner up in 2002–03, winning promotion to the Northern Counties East League. In 2004-05 the club won promotion to the NCEL Premier Division. However, in 2007–08, the club resigned from the NCEL and moved down the football pyramid to the Central Midlands League. The club was promoted to the East Midlands Counties League in 2013 but in June 2014 the club resigned from the league after they were unable to come to a suitable agreement over a lease at home ground &quot;The Fieldings&quot; that would enable them to get promoted in the future, which was a league requirement.

====Greyhound racing====
A greyhound racing track was opened around the Avenue Ground situated on the Mansfield Road behind the Pot Makers Arms, a venue used by Sutton Town AFC. The first meeting took place on 14 May 1932. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. Racing came to an end there on 13 May 1972.

===Kings Mill reservoir===
The reservoir, which lies within Sutton in Ashfield itself and not in the neighbouring town of Mansfield, is home to the Mill Adventure Base with sailing activities. This is one of three Nottinghamshire adventure bases, with the other two at Holme Pierrepont (Lakeside) and Worksop (Sandhill), all of which are available for people aged 11–19. The sailing club has used the reservoir since 1959. Kings Mill received its name from a mill on the north-east of the reservoir, once owned by John Cockle and his wife, who gave Henry II of England a night&#x27;s lodgings and breakfast during his reign.

===Nature===
To the west is the Brierley Forest Park, built on the site of Sutton Colliery, also known as Brierley Colliery, which was named due to many of the miners coming from Brierley Hill. It is a nature reserve and opened in 1999, it holds the Green Flag Award. Kings Mill Reservoir is also a nature reserve.

<text>Odd John: A Story Between Jest and Earnest is a 1935 science fiction novel by the British author Olaf Stapledon. The novel explores the theme of the &quot;Übermensch&quot; (superman) in the character of John Wainwright, whose supernormal human mentality inevitably leads to conflict with normal human society and to the destruction of the utopian colony founded by John and other superhumans.

The novel resonates with the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche and the work of English writer J. D. Beresford, with an allusion to Beresford&#x27;s superhuman child character of Victor Stott in &quot;The Hampdenshire Wonder&quot; (1911). As the devoted narrator remarks, John does not feel obliged to observe the restricted morality of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Stapledon&#x27;s recurrent vision of cosmic angst – that the universe may be indifferent to intelligence, no matter how spiritually refined – also gives the story added depth. Later explorations of the theme of the superhuman and of the incompatibility of the normal with the supernormal occur in the works of Stanisław Lem, Frank Herbert, Wilmar Shiras, Robert Heinlein and Vernor Vinge, among others.

The book is mentioned by Julian May in &quot;Intervention&quot;, part of the Galactic Milieu Series. It is also responsible for coining the term &quot;homo superior&quot;.

==Protagonist==
John is extremely intelligent even if he is stunted in his physical development. Like Stapledon himself, he believes in communist ideas but is critical of mainstream Marxism. He is also quite vain and highly skillful in the arts of seduction. From a human viewpoint, he can be considered amoral or perhaps to be following a morality beyond human understanding.

<text>Henry Nicholas Ridley CMG (1911), MA (Oxon), FRS, FLS, F.R.H.S. (10 December 1855 – 24 October 1956) was an English botanist, geologist and naturalist who lived much of his life in Singapore. He was instrumental in promoting rubber trees in the Malay Peninsula that led to a level of rapid deforestation, instrumental in the 1926 Great Flood. For the fervour with which he pursued this work he came to be known as &quot;Mad Ridley&quot;. 

==Life==

Henry Ridley was the second son and third child born to Louisa Pole Stuart and Oliver Matthew Ridley in West Harling in Norfolk, where his father was the Rector. At the age of three his mother died and his father moved to Cobham in Kent. He studied at Tonbridge School and then went to Haileybury where his brother Stuart also studied. At Cobham, he had taken to the idea of collecting insects and he continued this at Haileybury where the school encouraged him to publish a &quot;List of the Mammals and Coleoptera of Haileybury&quot;. The two brothers left Haileybury and Henry went to a private tutor at Medmenham near Henley who encouraged him in Zoology and then went to Exeter College, Oxford where he studied under Edwin Ray Lankester and George Rolleston while also taking an interest in botany and geology under the influence of Marmaduke Lawson and Joseph Prestwich. He graduated in 1878 and received a Burdett-Coutts scholarship that let him conduct research on fossils from quarries near Oxford. He then joined the British Museum in the botany department to replace Henry Trimen who had moved to Ceylon. He specialised in the monocotyledons and also began to travel around Europe. In 1887 he joined the Royal Society expedition with George Ramage to the island of Fernando de Noronha off Brazil, and published on the collections on returning. In 1888 he applied and was selected for the post of director of Gardens and Forests in the Straits Settlements. He was to meet Odoardo Beccari at Florence for information and to meet Trimen at Peradeniya to learn about rubber cultivation along the route.

Reaching Singapore, he was the first scientific director in charge of the botanical gardens and in charge of introducing new plants of economical value. Ridley established the methods for harvesting latex from Pará rubber plants which had been introduced ten years earlier by Sir Hugh Low apart from starting a zoological section in the gardens in 1870. Ridley explored the regions around including Penang and Malacca. In 1894 his post was abolished as the expenditure was found to exceed the revenues obtained. Ridley returned briefly to England but the removal of the post was however objected to by William Turner Thiselton-Dyer and Ridley went back to Selangor to advise on forest reservation.

Ridley spent many years promoting rubber as a commercial product, which he was known for being passionate; therefore, he was nicknamed &quot;Mad Ridley&quot;. In 1895, he discovered a means of tapping which did not seriously damage the rubber trees. Ridley was also largely responsible for establishing the rubber industry on the Malay Peninsula, where he resided for twenty years. The area under Pará rubber slowly increased after 1898 when a Chinese landowner, Tan Chay Yan, grew 40 acres successfully, leading to more people taking to rubber cultivation.

Ridley was also working on the botany of the region, collecting widely. He then returned to England in 1911 and stayed at Kew to work on a botanical treatise of the region. This five-volume Flora was published from 1922 to 1925. In 1930, he published a seminal and comprehensive work on plant dispersal. This work was the culmination of his own observations over several years, and a review of widely scattered literature on the subject. On his 100th birthday in 1955 he received a visit from the High Commissioner of the soon-to-be independent Malaya.

He married Lily Eliza Doran when he was 83 years old. Ridley died in Kew, short of his 101st birthday on 24 October 1956.

==Publications==
A near-complete list of publications can be found in the 80th birthday dedication issue of the &quot;Gardens&#x27; Bulletin&quot; (1935). The following are a few selected publications.

==Eponymous species==
Several species are named after Henry Ridley, including &quot;Diospyros ridleyi&quot;, &quot;Stenolepis ridleyi&quot;, and &quot;Amphisbaena ridleyi&quot;. It has been claimed that the olive ridley sea turtle is named after him, but this has been questioned as there is insufficient evidence. It is more likely that the turtle&#x27;s common name comes from the word &quot;riddle&quot;.

In 1913, botanist Rudolf Schlechter published &quot;Ridleyella&quot;, a monotypic genus of flowering plants from the orchid family, Orchidaceae. The sole species is &quot;Ridleyella paniculata&quot;, which is endemic to New Guinea.

Then in 1998, botanists A.Weber &amp; B.L.Burtt published &quot;Ridleyandra&quot;, a genus of about 30 species of flowering plants from Borneo, Malay and Thailand, belonging to the family Gesneriaceae and it also was named in Ridley&#x27;s honour.

<doc id="890382" wikidata="Q735905" url="?curid=890382" title="Falster">
<text>Falster () is an island in south-eastern Denmark with an area of and 43,398 inhabitants as of 1 January 2010. Located in the Kattegat, Belts and Sound area, it is part of Region Zealand and is administered by Guldborgsund Municipality. Falster includes Denmark&#x27;s southernmost point, Gedser Odde, near Gedser.

The largest town is Nykøbing Falster with over 40% of the island&#x27;s inhabitants. Other towns include Stubbekøbing, Nørre Alslev and Gedser.

Falster has motor and railway links both to the larger island of Zealand to the north and to the island of Lolland to the south-west. These links also lead to the smaller islands of Masnedø and Farø. European route E47 links Copenhagen to Hamburg (Germany) via Falster.

==History==

From medieval times until 1766, most of Falster belonged to the crown. King Valdemar&#x27;s Census Book from c. 1231 lists all the parishes and most of the villages. Falster&#x27;s two main towns, Nykøbing and Stubbekøbing, were both founded towards the end of the 12th century.

In medieval times, the island was marked by wars with the Wends in 1158 and with Lübeck in 1253. The census of 1509 includes only 90 of the 110 villages mentioned earlier. By contrast, it mentions 29 new settlements mainly along the coast.

In the 16th century, Falster had a number of farms which were owned by the local nobility but, from 1560 to 1630, they were slowly returned to the crown which once again owned the entire island. Therefore, Falster could therefore be used as the dowry for Frederick III&#x27;s wife, Sophie Amalie but as a result of the high taxes which resulted, many of the farms were deserted.

Falster was managed as a crown estate from 1718 until 1766 when it was sold by auction and divided up into ten large farms, five of which were given large new fields. But as the fields had to be prepared through the serfdom of local peasants, this led to many disputes.

The villages were replaced by the community from 1778 to 1814, and gradually moved to freehold tenants, a process which was only completed in about 1860.

Falster experienced significant economic expansion after 1880 when, with the establishment of cooperative dairies and slaughterhouses, farming was concentrated on livestock production and forage crops. There was also an increase in the cultivation of sugar beet which was processed in factories at Nykøbing and Stubbekøbing between 1890 and 1914. Many seasonal workers, especially women, from Sweden and Poland came to help with harvesting the sugar beet and some of them stayed.

With the new railway from Orehoved to Nykøbing in 1872 and railway ferries to Masnedø (1884) and Warnemünde (1903), Falster slowly became a traffic hub. Its position was reinforced by the construction of the Storstrøm Bridge (1937) and Farø Bridges (1985).

Since 1975, Falster has been marked by high unemployment as a result of harder times for both farming and industry.

==Tourism==

With its marinas, sandy beaches and cycle tracks, Falster attracts tourists who wish to have relaxing holidays in unspoilt surroundings. One of the most popular resorts is Marielyst on the east coast.

Nykøbing offers a number of attractions including its old-town atmosphere with narrow streets. Of particular interest are the Middle Ages Centre, which is an open-air museum build as a part of a medieval town around year 1400 and the biggest attraction of the town. Among other attractions in Nykøbing are the Abbey Church (&quot;Klosterkirke&quot;) which was built in the 15th century, a City Museum and a zoo.

Scattered around the island are several minor museum such as Danish Tractor Museum and Crocodile Zoo in Eskilstrup, a motorbike and radio Museum in Stubbekøbing and a geological museum in Gedser, which holds the world&#x27;s largest polished garnet by the name of &quot;Nordstjernen&quot; (the Northern Star).

==Transport==

Falster has a motorway and trunk roads linking its towns and villages.

Falster is connected to the larger island of Zealand to the north by the Farø Bridges (Farøbroerne) on European route E47 linking Copenhagen to Hamburg and the south. The Farø bridges join on the small island of Farø, and from there a further bridge gives access to the eastern neighbouring island of Møn. Falster is also connected to Zealand via the Storstrøm and Masnedsund bridges, via the island of Masnedø.

To the south-west, the E47 connects Falster to the island of Lolland via a tunnel under the Guldborgsund strait. There are two other bridges connecting to Lolland: the Guldborgsund Bridge at the northern end of the strait and the Frederick IX Bridge at Nykøbing Falster.

Nykøbing Falster&#x27;s railway station is operated by Danish State Railways. There are regular passenger train services to Copenhagen via Ringsted. International trains operating between Copenhagen and Hamburg (via the train ferry between Rødby and Puttgarden) also call at the station. The company Lokaltog operates a rail service to Nakskov. The railway takes the Frederick IX bridge to Lolland and the Storstrøm and Masnedsund bridges to Zealand.

There are also frequent bus services linking Nykøbing with other towns and villages on the island as well as with destinations on Lolland, Møn and Zealand.

<doc id="890385" wikidata="Q12957712" url="?curid=890385" title="Jerry Denny">
<text>Jeremiah Dennis Denny (born &quot;Jeremiah Dennis Eldridge&quot;; March 16, 1859 – August 16, 1927) was an American third baseman in Major League Baseball. He played for the Providence Grays (1881–1885), St. Louis Maroons (1886), Indianapolis Hoosiers (1888–1889), New York Giants (1890–1891), Cleveland Spiders (1891), Philadelphia Phillies (1891), and Louisville Colonels (1893–1894). He also played 86 games at shortstop in six seasons.

After leaving the major leagues, Denny continued playing minor league baseball until 1902. He was the last major league position player (non-pitcher) to play his entire career on the diamond without wearing a fielding glove.

==Name==
Eldridge attended St. Mary&#x27;s College, Phoenix, Arizona, in the late 1870s, and wanted to play semi-professional baseball during the summer months, when he wasn&#x27;t playing for the college as an amateur. He used the pseudonym &quot;Jerry Denny&quot; to hide his professional play from the college.

==Professional achievements==
Denny holds the major league record for most chances by a third baseman in a single game, handling 16 chances during an 18-inning match on August 17, 1882.

In 1884, Denny helped the National League champion Grays defeat the New York Metropolitans of the American Association in the major leagues&#x27; first post-season championship match-up. That season, he was the Grays&#x27; leader in home runs (six, and one in the championship series) and runs batted in (59), and second in extra-base hits (37).

Denny&#x27;s career totals are 1,237 games, 4,946 at bats, 714 runs, 1,286 hits, 238 doubles, 76 triples, 74 home runs, 667 RBI, 130 stolen bases, 173 walks, and a batting average of .260.

&quot;Denny was a rarity among power-hitters in that he drew very few walks, a factor that led to his offensive value being overrated throughout his career,&quot; wrote baseball historian Craig Wright, who explained: &quot;[Denny&#x27;s] batting averages were very normal for a position player of his era, but he walked so little that when he retired he had the second worst on-base percentage (.287) among major leaguers with 5000 plate appearances.&quot;

==Unconventional fielding technique==
At the time Denny began his professional career, fielding gloves had not yet become standard equipment, other than padded mitts for catchers and first basemen. Fielding gloves gradually gained acceptance between 1885 and the mid-1890s, but Denny refused to adapt. He was one of the few ambidextrous major league players; although he threw primarily with his right arm, he could also toss with his left. This gave him a defensive advantage at his customary field position—in ranging to his left on a ground ball, if he saw a play at second base, instead of having to transfer the ball to his right hand while pivoting and repositioning his body (as third basemen would customarily do), Denny could dispatch the ball to second with his left hand. This skill contributed to his refusal to wear a glove in the field, long after most players considered gloves essential.

<text>[[Baron]] Sir Ferdinand Jacob Heinrich von Mueller, (; 30 June 1825 – 10 October 1896) was a German-Australian physician, geographer, and most notably, a botanist. He was appointed government botanist for the then colony of Victoria, Australia by Governor Charles La Trobe in 1853, and later director of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Melbourne. He also founded the National Herbarium of Victoria. He named many Australian plants.

==Early life==
Mueller was born at Rostock, in the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. After the early death of his parents, Frederick and Louisa, his grandparents gave him a good education in Tönning, Schleswig. Apprenticed to a chemist at the age of 15, he passed his pharmaceutical examinations and studied botany under Professor Ernst Ferdinand Nolte (1791–1875) at Kiel University. In 1847, he received his degree of Doctor of Philosophy from Kiel for a thesis on the plants of the southern regions of Schleswig.

Mueller&#x27;s sister Bertha had been advised to seek a warmer climate for her health, and the great botanist Ludwig Preiss, who had recently returned from Perth, recommended Australia, so in 1847, Mueller, Bertha, and their other surviving sister, Clara, sailed from Bremen. While still on the ship, he reportedly fished his first plants out of the water to analyse them.

==Australia==
Ferdinand von Mueller was one of a number of influential German-speaking residents such as Ludwig Becker, Hermann Beckler, William Blandowski, Amalie Dietrich, Wilhelm Haacke, Diedrich Henne, Gerard Krefft, Johann Luehmann, Johann Menge, Carl Mücke (a.k.a. Muecke), Ludwig Preiss, Carl Ludwig Christian Rümker (a.k.a. Ruemker), Moritz Richard Schomburgk, Richard Wolfgang Semon, Karl Theodor Staiger, George Ulrich, Eugene von Guérard, Robert von Lendenfeld, Georg von Neumayer, and Carl Wilhelmi who brought their &quot;epistemic traditions&quot; to Australia, and not only became &quot;deeply entangled with the Australian colonial project&quot;, but also were &quot;intricately involved in imagining, knowing and shaping colonial Australia&quot; (Barrett, et al., 2018, p.2).

He arrived at Adelaide on 18 December 1847 and found employment as a chemist with Moritz J. Heuzenroeder, in Rundle Street. He was an inveterate explorer, walking alone to Mount Arden and Mount Brown during his first year. Shortly afterwards, he obtained of land not far from Adelaide in the Bugle Ranges, and had a cottage built there. He moved there with his sister Clara, intending to start a farm, but after a few months, he returned to his former employment.

Mueller thought to open a chemist&#x27;s shop in the gold diggings, so in 1851, he moved to Melbourne, capital of the new colony of Victoria. He had contributed a few papers on botanical subjects to German periodicals, and in 1852, sent a paper to the Linnean Society of London on &quot;The Flora of South Australia&quot;, thus beginning to be well known in botanical circles.

==Victorian Government Botanist==

===1853===
Mueller was appointed government botanist for Victoria by Governor Charles La Trobe in 1853, a post that was newly created for him. He examined its flora, especially the Alpine vegetation of Australia, which was previously unknown. He explored the Buffalo Ranges, then went to the upper reaches of the Goulburn River and across Gippsland to the coast. The neighbourhoods of Port Albert and Wilsons Promontory were explored, and the journey of some was completed along the coast to Melbourne.

In the same year, he established the National Herbarium of Victoria, which can still be visited today. It has many plants from Australia and abroad, many of which were collected by Mueller. Also, his large private library was transferred to the government of Victoria in 1865 and is incorporated into the library of the herbarium in Melbourne.

===1855–1856===
Mueller was then nominated as the botanist to accompany the North Australian Exploring Expedition (1855–1856) led by Augustus Gregory, and decided to join despite initial hesitations. He explored the Victoria River and other portions of North Australia, was one of the four who reached Termination Lake in 1856, and accompanied Gregory&#x27;s expedition overland to Moreton Bay. Mueller, for his part, found nearly 800 species in Australia new to science, such as &quot;Macadamia ternifolia&quot; (named after his friend and colleague, John Macadam). He published in this year his &quot;Definitions of Rare or Hitherto Undescribed Australian Plants&quot;.
===1854–1872===
From 1854 to 1872, Mueller was a member of the Victorian Institute for the Advancement of Science, which later became the Philosophical Institute of Victoria. He was president of the Philosophical Institute in 1859 when it received a royal charter and became the Royal Society of Victoria. He was an active member of the society&#x27;s &quot;Exploration Committee&quot; which established the Burke and Wills expedition of 1860. Mueller promoted the exploration of Australia, and as one of only two members of the Exploration Committee with any experience of exploration, he made several speeches to the society on the topic. He did not favour the selection of Burke as leader, but due to factionalism in the committee, he had little say in the establishment, provisioning, or composition of the exploration party.

===1857–1873===
From 1857 to 1873, he was director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, and not only introduced many plants into Victoria, but also made the excellent qualities of the blue gum (&quot;Eucalyptus globulus&quot;) known all over the world, and succeeded in introducing it into the south of Europe, North and South Africa, California, and the extratropical portions of South America.

===1873===
By 1873, influential Melburnians were critical of Mueller&#x27;s scientific and educational approach with the Royal Botanic Gardens. Development of the gardens with an eye to aesthetics was sought. Mueller was dismissed from his position as director of the Botanic Gardens on 31 May 1873. He had done much to develop the gardens with the scarce resources at hand. Though his pay was not affected and he still continued as the government botanist, he never lost his sense of grievance over losing the position.

In April 1873, Mueller had created the genus &quot;Guilfoylia&quot; and described William Guilfoyle as &quot;distinguished as a collector [who] evidenced great ardour&quot; and held high hopes for his collecting ability. Mueller&#x27;s opinion changed when Guilfoyle was appointed to take his place as director of the Botanic Gardens in July 1873. He accused Guilfoyle of being a &quot;nurseryman [with] no claims to scientific knowledge whatever&quot; and of getting the job due to being related to the wife of the responsible minister. Mueller subsequently abolished &quot;Guilfoylia&quot; as part of the genus of &quot;Cadellia&quot; in his botanical census of 1882 (today the genus &quot;Guilfoylia&quot; is again accepted). Guilfoyle went on to landscape the gardens in an aesthetic and pleasing style welcomed by most Melburnians.

==Recognition==
In 1857, Mueller applied for and was granted the degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of Rostock; in 1883, he was awarded the Clarke Medal by the Royal Society of New South Wales.

Mueller was decorated by many foreign countries, including Germany, France, Spain, Denmark, and Portugal. He was appointed a fellow of the Royal Society in 1861, and knighted as Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1879. A list of his &#x27;Orders, offices, affiliations and sundry honours&#x27; has been assembled. Many of his decorations were received in return for supplying zoological specimens to royal museums.

He was the benefactor of explorer Ernest Giles, who visited Lake Amadeus and Kata Tjuta. Giles had originally wanted to name these Lake Mueller and Mt Ferdinand, but Mueller prevailed upon Giles to name them Lake Amadeus, after King Amadeus of Spain, and Mt Olga, after Queen Olga of Württemberg; both kings had granted him honours. In 1871, King Karl of Württemberg gave him the hereditary title of &quot;Freiherr&quot;, to mark his distinction in &#x27;natural sciences generally and in particular for the natural history collections and institutions of Our Kingdom&#x27; He was then known as &quot;Baron&quot; Sir Ferdinand &quot;von&quot; Mueller.

==Publications==
He published 11 volumes of &quot;Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae&quot; (1862–1881), two volumes of the &quot;Plants of Victoria&quot; (1860–1865), and other books on the &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, Myoporaceae, &quot;Acacia&quot;, and Salsolaceae, all profusely illustrated. He also co-operated in the production of George Bentham&#x27;s &quot;Flora Australiensis&quot;. He described many novel plant species sent by botanists from other parts of Australia, notably Maurice William Holtze from the Northern Territory, and encouraged settlers to send plants to him.

Mueller published an educational exsiccata with the title &quot;Educational collections of Australian plants&quot; (1873–1876) and was able to distribute three fascicles in about 50 institutions.

Women were key contributors to his collections. Two hundred and twenty-five women and girls, the youngest of which was six years of age, collected plant specimens and mailed them to Mueller for cataloging. These women included Louisa Atkinson, Sarah Brooks, and Flora Mary Campbell.

He took a leading part in promoting Australian exploration, especially the Burke and Wills expedition, which was the first to cross the continent, and in the various attempts to unravel the mystery which attended the fate of his fellow countryman Ludwig Leichhardt (1813–1848).

==Death==

Mueller died in Melbourne and is buried in the St Kilda Cemetery. He was survived by his sister, Mrs. Clara Wehl, of Millicent, South Australia. His other sister, Mrs. Bertha Doughty of near Penola predeceased him. He never married.

==Darwinism==
Mueller was a theist who rejected Darwinism, but is said by historians to have misunderstood key aspects of Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory. Despite his differences he remained on friendly terms with Darwin.

==Standard author abbreviation==
==Legacy==
The Mueller Medal has been awarded since 1904 by the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science to &quot;a scientist who is the author of important contributions to anthropological, botanical, geological or zoological science, preferably with special reference to Australia&quot;.

A Victorian Railways S Class diesel-electric locomotive, S311, is named after Mueller.

<doc id="890394" wikidata="Q7530360" url="?curid=890394" title="Sirius (novel)">
<text>Sirius is a 1944 science fiction novel by the British philosopher and author Olaf Stapledon, whose title character is a dog named Sirius with humanlike intelligence. A sense of existential questioning suffuses the book, as the author delves into aspects of Sirius&#x27;s psyche. The novel deals with many human issues through Sirius and his experiences, his unusual nature, his ideas and his relationships with humans. The characters go to great lengths to prevent Sirius from becoming a circus-type wonderdog, and instead, they seek to develop Sirius&#x27;s character much like a family would create and foster that of a human child.

==Plot summary==
In early 20th century North Wales, scientist Thomas Trelone embarks to hormonally enhance the cognition and lifespan of sheep-dogs, eventually succeeding in creating a viable puppy, Sirius, just as his daughter Plaxy is born. Sirius soon exceeds Thomas&#x27;s expectations by achieving human intelligence and learning to talk, albeit with not easily recognizable speech. As such, Thomas and his wife Elizabeth raise Plaxy and Sirius as if they were siblings. Despite their love for each other, Plaxy and Sirius begin to grow apart when she joins a boarding school while he becomes the sheep-dog of Mr. Pugh, an acknowledgement of Thomas. Invested in Sirius&#x27;s well-being, Thomas keeps his intelligence hidden from Mr. Pugh as well as the public. After a year, Sirius eagerly returns home to meet Plaxy again and discuss with Thomas about finding his place in the world by pursuing personal growth.

Partly to comply with his desires, Thomas decides to take Sirius to the University of Cambridge and reveal him for the first time to his most trusted colleagues, who react with amazement. Sirius&#x27;s time at Cambridge partly satisfies his mental pursuits, but his well-being, self-control, and fitness decline due to homesickness, pampering, and inactivity. He manages to arrange a meeting with Plaxy, now a university student, but she fails to console him.

Embittered by the encounter, Sirius begins to assess humanity and nature more harshly, flipping between love and hate towards Plaxy and sporadically rejecting his human side by going savage. Yearning for something more wholesome than science, Sirius experiences a spiritual epiphany and becomes interested in religion. However, when Elizabeth arranges a meeting with Reverend Geoffrey Adams, he is disappointed to learn that human religion centers more on doctrine and mythology than love or spiritual truth. Nevertheless, after great persuasion to express himself, Geoffrey, with caution, allows Sirius to sing in his church in front of an astounded audience, becoming a local phenomenon.

Sirius returns home and resumes his occupation as a sheep-dog, just as World War II hits Britain. Geoffrey is killed and Sirius witnesses Thomas being crushed to death during a bombing, with Elizabeth succumbing shortly after to shock from believing to have lost his son in battle. With his masters and parental figures dead, Sirius begins working with Plaxy at a farm, aided by the Pughs. Though the Pughs are now aware of Sirius&#x27;s true nature and welcome it, the townspeople largely see him as an abomination and fabricate rumors of bestiality with Plaxy. The story&#x27;s narrator, who is also Plaxy&#x27;s lover, visits them. He confirms that Plaxy and Sirius are indeed very close, and although she accepts him as a lover, her main priority is Sirius. The rumors compel authorities to conscript Plaxy to public service, leaving Sirius alone managing the farm.

Depressed and enraged by the townspeople&#x27;s hostility, Sirius leaves the farm to live in the wild. After he attacks livestock and kills a couple of farmers in self-defense, the authorities set out to hunt him down. News of the incidents compel Plaxy to return to the farm, planning to rescue Sirius and escape to Scotland. She eventually finds him and manages to reawaken his human mind by consoling him. Despite her efforts, Sirius laments his existence as an irreconcilable fight between his human and canine sides after all. Sirius is shot by a farmer and dies professing his love for Plaxy, stating their time together, despite all the hardship, was worthwhile.

<doc id="890397" wikidata="Q2130456" url="?curid=890397" title="The Storr">
<text>The Storr () is a mountain on the Trotternish peninsula of the Isle of Skye in Scotland. The hill presents a steep rocky eastern face overlooking the Sound of Raasay, contrasting with gentler grassy slopes to the west.

==Geology==
The Storr is a prime example of the Trotternish landslip, the longest such feature in Great Britain. It is the type locality for the mineral gyrolite.

The area in front of the cliffs of the Storr is known as the Sanctuary. This has a number of weirdly shaped rock pinnacles, the remnants of ancient landslips.

==Ascent routes==
A well-constructed path, used by many sightseers, leaves the A855 just north of Loch Leathan. It heads up through a clearfell area that was formerly a conifer plantation. Most day-trippers are content simply to wander around the Sanctuary, admiring the pinnacles and gazing up at the Storr&#x27;s eastern cliffs. Walkers can easily ascend to the summit, however, by skirting below the cliffs whilst heading north from the north end of the Sanctuary. After passing over a fence at a makeshift stile and climbing a brief steep section of loose rock, the recommended route for walkers heads north-west as far as Coire Scamadal, 1 km north of the summit, then doubles back and heads southwards along the north side, climbing towards the summit. From this route, visible breaks in the cliffs offer tempting short cuts, but these are steep, may not save time and may not be safe. An alternative route, involving some mild scrambling, follows the rim of the south-east-facing cliffs from the top of the aforementioned steep section.

Another route to or from the summit starts south-west of the car park and heads north-west to Bealach Beag, about south-west of the summit, following the course of a stream which breaches the cliffs. A steep section of this course is slippery and requires care.

The Storr is often climbed as part of a much longer expedition, following the full length of the Trotternish landslip.

==Media and the arts==
From 1 August to 17 September 2005 one of Britain&#x27;s single largest environmental artworks was staged on the walk up to Coire Faoin at the base of the Old Man of Storr and the Storr cliffs. Created by NVA, a Scottish environmental arts company, directed by Angus Farquhar (formerly of Test Dept) and designed by a team including &quot;&lt;slight&gt;&quot; and David Bryant from Midnight Design, the work contained music by Geir Jenssen, Paul Mounsey, live performance by Gaelic singer Anne Martin and recordings of the works of Gaelic poet Somhairle MacGill-Eain (Sorley MacLean). This was David Bryant&#x27;s last major environmental creative work as he died from cancer in 2007. He won a Plasa Lighting Design award in 2006 for his work lighting the Storr.

In October 2009, a photograph taken of the pinnacles looking towards Raasay and South Rona won the &quot;Take a view: Landscape photo of the year 2009&quot;.

In January 2012, production of the science-fiction film &quot;Prometheus&quot; moved to the Isle of Skye, with filming taking place at the Old Man of Storr.

British composer Matthew Taylor composed the orchestral piece &quot;Storr&quot;, which takes its name and inspiration from the rock formation, which the composer found awe-inspiring on a visit there. &quot;Storr&quot; was commissioned and premièred by the Essex Symphony Orchestra conducted by Tom Hammond, and given its London première by the Kensington Symphony Orchestra and Russell Keable on 24 June 2013.

<text>The Liechtensteinisches Gymnasium () is a secondary school located in Vaduz, Liechtenstein. It was founded in 1937 as the Collegium Marianum by the Maristen-Schulbrüder as an independent school. Since 1981, the Liechtensteinisches Gymnasium has been a public school run by the state of Liechtenstein.

The number of pupils has been increasing steadily since the mid-1980s, especially since girls were admitted in the mid-1960s; today, the school educates over 700 students. 

==Unterstufe==
The Unterstufe (or lower grades) of the Liechtensteinisches Gymnasium comprises three grades (US1, US2 and US3). There are three ways to enter the Liechensteinisches Gymnasium from the Realschule (a type of secondary school offering a less theoretical education). One can enter the second grade (US2) of the Liechtensteinisches Gymnasium from the first grade of the Realschule, the fourth grade (OS1) of the Gymnasium from the third grade of the Realschule, or the fourth grade (OS1) of the Gymnasium from the fourth grade of the Realschule. 

All students study the same subjects in each grade. In US1, students study Religious Education, Geography, History, German, Science, Informatics, Technics, Needlework, Art, Music, Physical Education, and Mathematics. In US2, students start studying English, Latin and French. In addition, there is one &quot;class lesson&quot; (or &quot;Lebenskunde&quot;) per week.

Students may not be exempt from studying the subjects mentioned above in the Unterstufe. They may, however, choose to study additional subjects if they please. 

==Oberstufe==
The Oberstufe (or upper grades) of the Liechtensteinisches Gymnasium comprises four grades (OS1, OS2, OS3 and OS4). In the Oberstufe, the pupils must choose one out of five education tracks:

* Lingua (Latin and Italian)
* Modern languages (Spanish, Italian or Latin)
* Art, Music, and Pedagogy (art, music and pedagogy)
* Economics and Law (business administration, law, and accounting (in OS1 and OS2), and economics (in OS3 and OS4))
* Mathematics and Science (computer science; mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry and geography all have higher numbers of lessons than is usual)

During school, students study a number of base subjects in addition to several classes that form the educational track they choose. Basic subjects include English, German, French, mathematics, physics, and physical education. In OS3 and OS4, students choose elective courses in addition that enhance their specialisation.

Courses in several subjects are only taught in certain grades:
* OS1: Biology, Economics and Law, history, Art, Music, Religious Education and Ethics
* OS2: Biology, Chemistry, Geography, History, Art or Music, Religious Education and Ethics
* OS3: Biology, Chemistry, Geography, Art or Music, Philosophy
* OS4: Geography, Economics and Law, History, Religious Education and Ethics, Philosophy

==Matura==
In order to meet the requirements to graduate with a Matura (school-leaving diploma), a student must successfully complete OS4, and must receive the mark of “sufficient&quot; in at least two dissertations. Written examinations are held in German, English or French, Mathematics, and a subject related to the student&#x27;s specialisation. Oral examinations are held in German, Philosophy, Religious Education, Ethics or History, Mathematics, Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Geography or Economics and Law, English, French, Italian, Spanish or Latin, and a subject chosen by the student.

<text>Husbands and Wives is a 1992 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Woody Allen. The film stars Allen, Mia Farrow, Sydney Pollack, Judy Davis, Lysette Anthony, Juliette Lewis, Liam Neeson and Blythe Danner. The film debuted shortly after the end of Allen and Farrow&#x27;s romantic and professional partnership, and was the last of their 13 films together. The movie is filmed by Carlo Di Palma with a handheld camera style and features documentary-like interviews with the characters interspersed with the story.

&quot;Husbands and Wives&quot;, released by TriStar Pictures, was Allen&#x27;s first film as sole director for a studio other than United Artists or Orion Pictures (both now part of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) since &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot; (1969). It received critical acclaim despite being a box-office failure, and was nominated for two Academy Awards, Best Supporting Actress (Judy Davis) and Best Original Screenplay (Woody Allen).

==Plot==
The film follows two couples: Jack and Sally, and Gabe and Judy. It starts with Jack and Sally visiting Gabe and Judy&#x27;s apartment to announce their separation. Gabe is shocked, but Judy takes it personally and is deeply hurt. The four of them go out to dinner at a Chinese restaurant, still confused about the situation.

A few weeks later, Sally visits a colleague&#x27;s apartment to begin an evening at the opera and dinner. She calls Jack from the colleague&#x27;s phone and accuses him of having an affair during their marriage after learning that he has met someone new.

Judy and Gabe meet Jack&#x27;s new girlfriend, Sam, an aerobics trainer. While Judy and Sam go shopping, Gabe calls Sam a &quot;cocktail waitress&quot; and tells Jack that he&#x27;s crazy for leaving Sally for her. Later, Judy introduces Michael, her colleague from the magazine, to Sally. They begin dating, but Sally is unsatisfied with the relationship.

Meanwhile, Gabe has developed a friendship with Rain, a young student of his, who reads and criticizes his novel manuscript. They share a romantic moment at her 21st birthday party, but Gabe decides they should not pursue it any further.

At a party, Jack learns that Sally is seeing someone else and becomes jealous. He and Sam argue intensely, and Jack drives home to find Sally in bed with Michael. He asks Sally to give their marriage another chance, but she refuses.

Less than two weeks later, Jack and Sally are back together and meet Gabe and Judy for dinner. Afterward, Judy and Gabe argue about her not sharing her poetry, and Gabe makes a failed pass at her. Judy tells him she thinks the relationship is over, and a week later Gabe moves out. Judy begins seeing Michael.

In the end, Jack and Sally are still struggling with marital problems, but accept them as the price of remaining together. Gabe is living alone and not dating to avoid hurting anyone, including himself. The film ends with Gabe asking the unseen documentary crew whether he can leave.

==Cast==
The cast includes (in credits order):

* Woody Allen as Gabe Roth

==Philosophical interpretation==
The scene in which Sally, while having sex with Michael, begins to mentally compare (through voiceover narration) him and her husband Jack, as well as numerous friends and acquaintances, to hedgehogs and foxes, is an allusion to British philosopher Isaiah Berlin&#x27;s 1953 essay The Hedgehog and the Fox. In that book, Berlin contrasts two distinct types of thinker in the Western literary and philosophical tradition: those he calls &quot;hedgehogs&quot;—&quot;who relate everything to a single central vision, one system&quot;—and those he calls &quot;foxes&quot;—&quot;who pursue many ends, often unrelated and even contradictory... related to no moral or aesthetic principle&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; opened on September 18, 1992 in 865 theatres, where it earned $3,520,550 ($4,070 per screen) in its opening weekend. It went on to gross $10.5 million in North America during its theatrical run. The film was also screened at the 1992 Toronto Festival of Festivals.

===Critical response===
&quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; opened to acclaim from film critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 93% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 43 reviews, with an average score of 7.9/10.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;a defining film for these emotionally embattled times; it&#x27;s classic Woody Allen.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; similarly praised the film as &quot;a full meal, as it deals with the things of life with intelligence, truthful drama and rueful humor.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a very fine, sometimes brutal comedy about a small group of contemporary New Yorkers, each an edgy, self-analyzing achiever who goes through life without much joy, but who finds a certain number of cracked satisfactions along the way.&quot; He added, &quot;&#x27;Husbands and Wives&#x27; -- the entire Allen canon, for that matter -- represents a kind of personal cinema for which there is no precedent in modern American movies. Even our best directors are herd animals. Mr. Allen is a rogue: he travels alone.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; opined, &quot;... what &#x27;Husbands and Wives&#x27; argues is that many &#x27;rational&#x27; relationships are actually not as durable as they seem, because somewhere inside every person is a child crying me! me! me! We say we want the other person to be happy. What we mean is, we want them to be happy with us, just as we are, on our terms.&quot;

In 2016, &quot;Time Out&quot; contributors ranked &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; fifth among Allen&#x27;s efforts, with Keith Uhlich praising the work&#x27;s &quot;trenchant examination of long-term relationships on the downswing&quot;. The same year, Robbie Collin and Tim Robey of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; listed &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; as his seventh greatest film, calling it &quot;a rapid marvel of four-way characterization&quot; and praising the opening scene as &quot;one of Allen’s most vividly written, shot and acted scenes ever&quot;.

<text>Trotternish () is the northernmost peninsula of the Isle of Skye in Scotland, spanning in length from Portree to Rubha Hunish. The Trotternish escarpment runs almost the full length of the peninsula, some , and contains landmarks such as the Old Man of Storr and the Quiraing. The summit of The Storr, overlooking the Old Man, is the highest point of the peninsula at 719 m above sea level. The north-eastern part of the peninsula around Quiraing is designated as a National Scenic Area and the entire escarpment is a Special Area of Conservation.

Dinosaur footprints have been found at &quot;An Corran&quot;, which is also a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer site dating to the 7th millennium BC. The ruins of the 14th–15th-century Duntulm Castle stand at the northern end of the peninsula.

The three major settlements on Trotternish are Portree, generally regarded as the capital of Skye, Uig, a ferry terminus, and the township of Staffin. Trotternish is the strongest Gaelic-speaking area of Skye.

==Geography and natural history==

Trotternish is underlain by basalt, which provides relatively rich soils and a variety of unusual rock features. The Kilt Rock is named after the tartan-like patterns in the cliffs. The Quiraing is a spectacular series of rock pinnacles on the eastern side of the main spine of the peninsula and further south is the rock pillar of the Old Man of Storr.

Trotternish is also known for its Middle Jurassic aged rocks (c. 174–164 million years old), which yield a variety of fossils including dinosaurs. These are strictly protected by law by the Skye Nature Conservation Order 2019. Dinosaurs known from Trotternish include theropods, sauropods, thyreophorans, and possible ornithopods. Many of Skye&#x27;s dinosaur body fossils and footprints can be viewed at the Staffin Museum in Ellishadder, Staffin. The most accessible shoreline localities to view dinosaur footprints include Duntulm, Brother&#x27;s Point, and An Corran.

===Conservation designations===
The north-eastern part of the peninsula around Quiraing is designated as the Trotternish National Scenic Area, one of the forty such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The designated area covers 7,919 ha in total, of which 6,128 ha is on land, with a further 1789 ha being marine (i.e. below low tide level, and covering the seas to the east of the peninsula).

The entire length of the Trotternish escarpment is protected as a Special Area of Conservation under the Natura 2000 programme, and classified as a Category IV protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

==History==

A Mesolithic hunter-gatherer site dating to the 7th millennium BC at in Staffin is one of the oldest archaeological sites in Scotland. The site continued to be used over many millennia with human bones radiocarbon-dated to the Neolithic (dated to around 3500 BC) and Bronze Age (dated to between 2560 and 2150 BC) periods and a copper-alloy pin from the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age being found, as well as more modern 19th-20th century materials.

Its Mesolithic occupation is probably linked to that of the rock shelter at Sand, Applecross, on the mainland coast of Wester Ross where tools made of a mudstone from have been found. Surveys of the area between the two shores of the Inner Sound and Sound of Raasay have revealed 33 sites with potentially Mesolithic deposits.

The ruined Duntulm Castle stands on a promontory at the northern end of the peninsula, near the hamlet of Duntulm. During the 17th century it was the seat of the chiefs of Clan MacDonald of Sleat, and is a scheduled monument. The castle is believed to stand on the site of a prehistoric broch or dun known as &quot;Dun David&quot;, or &quot;Dun Dhaibhidh&quot;, although no archaeological evidence has been found for this predecessor. The castle was built in the 14th and 15th centuries, when the area was subject to feuds between the rival MacLeod and Macdonald clans, and was abandoned around 1732, when Sir Alexander MacDonald built a new residence, Monkstadt House, to the south.

Between 1750 and 1772, Flodigarry, north of Staffin, was the home of Flora MacDonald, the Jacobite made famous by her part in Prince Charles Edward Stuart&#x27;s escape after his defeat at Culloden. She later moved to Kingsburgh on the southwestern coast of Trotternish, and it was here that Boswell and Johnson met her during their tour of the Western Isles in 1773. Johnson, who held Jacobite views when younger, commented that she was a woman of &quot;soft features, gentle manners, and elegant presence&quot;.

==Gaelic==
In terms of number of speakers, Trotternish is the strongest Gaelic-speaking area of Skye. In the 2001 census, 61% of the population returned as Gaelic speakers, there are Gaelic-medium units in the Staffin and Kilmuir primary schools, and the area is the focus of one of Comunn na Gàidhlig&#x27;s Gaelic development initiatives, &quot;Lasair&quot;. In 2010, Comunn na Gàidhlig named Staffin as their Gaelic Community of the Year.

==Transport==
The main road in Trotternish is the A87, which runs between Portree at the southern end of the peninsula and Uig on the northwest coast. Uig marks the northwestern terminus of the A87, with its southeastern terminus being the junction with the A82 at Invergarry, to the north of Fort William. The A855 road also links Portree and Uig, taking a route along the eastern coast and around the northern end of the peninsula: the two roads thus combine to encircle Trotternish. A minor road also crosses the peninsula, passing between Uig and Staffin via the Quiraing.

Portree is the terminus for Scottish Citylink buses from Glasgow Buchanan bus station and Inverness, with some services continuing on to Uig. Uig serves as the ferry terminal for Caledonian MacBrayne services to Tarbert on Harris and Lochmaddy on North Uist, providing links with the Outer Hebrides.

<text>Fougères (; ; Gallo: &quot;Foujerr&quot;) is a commune and a sub-prefecture of the Ille-et-Vilaine department, located in Brittany, northwestern France. As of 2017, Fougères had 20,418 inhabitants. The Fougères area comprises approximately 88,000 inhabitants and is currently growing, unlike the town centre.

==History==

=== Toponymy ===
Fougères is a town on the edge of Brittany, Maine and Normandy and is named after a fern (see also &quot;fougère&quot;), or from &quot;fous&quot; which means &quot;fossé&quot; (&quot;gap&quot;).

The town of Fougères is mentioned in the chorus of the song La Blanche Hermine by Gilles Servat. The author uses it as a symbol of the Breton resistance where it is adjacent to the town of Clisson in the Loire-Atlantique.

Fougères is historically, since the arrival of Latin in Armorica, a region where Gallo is spoken. In Gallo, Fougères translates to &quot;Foujerr&quot; while its Breton name is &quot;Felger&quot;. Entry signs to the agglomeration have carried the Breton name for several years. One of the two bagad of the city takes this name: and the Diwan school, opened in 2013, is also called &quot;Skol Diwan bro Felger&quot;.

===Prehistory===
The presence of many megalithic monuments, particularly in the , suggests that the area was already inhabited in the Neolithic era (5000 to 2000 years BC).

===Middle Ages===
The creation of Fougères dates back to the Middle Ages. The Château de Fougères was first mentioned around the end of the 10th century. At the time, it was a simple wooden fortification located on a rocky ridge, whose position favourably dominated the Valley and the surrounding marshes. Fougères was at the crossing of two Roman roads, one from Chartres to Carhaix and the other from Avranches to Nantes. From the 12th century, the population moved away from the shore of the Nançon and the city grew in size, divided into two parishes: Saint-Sulpice for the lower town and Saint-Léonard for the upper town. Since the Middle Ages, crafts developed around tannery, weavers and drapers in the lower town.

Built in the 11th century by the lords of Fougères, the first fortification, defended by Raoul II (1130–1194), was taken by Henry II of England in 1166 and destroyed. Raoul II stubbornly rebuilt a more imposing structure and it became a stronghold defending the borders of Brittany from Mont Saint-Michel to Nantes. However, the geographical position and the interests of the lords of Fougères often tipped in favour of the Kingdom of France. When Raoul III offered its possession to Louis IX of France, the Breton prince Pierre Mauclerc captured the city in 1231, which was re-captured by the king. The daughter of Raoul III, Jeanne de Fougères, who married Hugh XII of Lusignan, undertook new fortification work and beautified the city. The end of the 13th century was a period of peace and prosperity for Fougères.

In 1307, Philip IV of France bought the domain but the Kingdom of France was not interested and did not maintain it. After various fights and reversals of alliances, Bertrand du Guesclin entered in 1373, but the situation did not improve. Abandoned and ravaged by pillaging, the population of Fougères requested assistance from the Duchy of Brittany and the town joined the duchy in 1428, sold by John II of Alençon. However, in 1449, a man named François de Surienne, an Aragonese mercenary at the service of the English, captured and sacked the town in an attempt to force Brittany to ally with England. There were many massacres, which caused a reaction from Francis I, Duke of Brittany, determined to get rid of the English. The Duke of Brittany allied with Charles VII of France and attacked the south of Normandy, laying siege to Fougères. Surienne and his men were, however, able to resist and surrendered on the condition of being able to walk free. This episode announced the Battle of Formigny. Finally, the French general La Trémoille seized Fougères in 1488, during the Mad War.

===Early modern===
In the 16th century, the town lost its defensive role. Crafts continued to develop, including the craft of tin (&quot;in Rue de la Pinterie&quot;). During the Wars of Religion, the town remained Catholic while Vitré was affected by clashes with the Huguenots.

Until 1775, Fougères was barely mentioned. The Marquis de La Rouërie, a young man of high standing, then moved to the United States to fight with American insurgents. Back in France, after having been imprisoned for a month for leading the , he was greeted as a hero in his homeland.

===French Revolution===

During the French Revolution, the province of Brittany disappeared along with its privileges. The first changes were originally welcomed by the population. However, over time the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of the priests and the Levée en masse triggered a rebellion, the Chouannerie. In 1793, during the Virée de Galerne, the Vendéens and Chouans seized the town which was taken a few weeks later by the Republicans. For eight years, the town and its region passed from hand to hand, with many massacres and looting occurring. The leader of the Chouans of the Fougères area was the young general Aimé du Boisguy.
The Organization of the reflected a favourable feeling from the population to the new regime:

* The victories of the Republican armies were celebrated, including the Siege of Toulon against the Anglo-royalists
* The feast of 26 messidor (14 July), established in 1794, was celebrated in Fougères
* The anniversary of the execution of Louis XVI, accompanied by an and anarchy, was celebrated (from 1795)
*Other Republican festivals followed, such as the anniversary of the Republic up to the year VIII (22 September, 1 Vendémiaire), the celebration of youth (10 Germinal, on 30 March), and the Festival of Recognition (the 10 prairial) or the Festival of Agriculture (the 10 messidor).

===20th century===

==== Early 20th century industry ====

Little by little, industry replaced crafts and Fougères saw the establishment of shoe manufacturers. In the winter of 1906–07, workers went on strike in the shoe factories and in response, managers organised a lockout. Solidarity was very strong in the city (&quot;Communist&quot; soups to feed the strikers without family income) but also beyond: Children were welcomed by Rennes and Parisian families during conflicts. Jean Jaurès came to Fougères to support the movement.
Glassware production had also existed in the Fougères area since the arrival of Italian glass masters in the 16th and 17th centuries. The installation of this industry is explained by the presence of a sandy soil (since sand is the main component of glass), a forest (since sand needs to be melted) and ferns (soda-rich plants). A glass factory existed on the outskirts of the town (Laignelet), which flourished in the 19th century. However, following social demands in 1921, religious unionism was mobilized and a new Fougères glass factory: &quot;La Cristallerie Fougeraise&quot;, was founded by , as well as a working town later in 1922, designed by the architect , to accommodate staff.

The 20th century was marked by the British and American bombings on 8 June 1944, during Operation Overlord, which killed 300 people, injured twice as many, and destroyed most of the public and industrial facilities. This bombing was in preparation to liberate France after surrendering to Nazi Germany on June 22 1940. Since then, the town has largely been open to tourism, thanks to its medieval castle and its historic districts. From the 1970s, industry has been diverse: food processing, furniture, mechanical, glass, electronics, computing, and robotics.

Fougères also organizes an important cattle market.

==== World War I ====
640 names are engraved in a monument to commemorate the death of soldiers from Fougères that fought for France during World War I. Fougères also welcomed many war wounded soldiers in its hospital and the monument mention 148 additional names of soldiers that died in Fougères but were not originating from the city.

===Recent sports events===
On 11 July 2013, Fougères hosted the Tour de France as a departure town. When the Tour de France returned on 10 July 2015, Fougères was the finish town for stage 7 (Livarot-Fougères). It was a stage victory for the British cyclist Mark Cavendish. Cyclism came back to the town on 4 July 2016, where Fougères was a race-through town in the stage Granville-Angers.

Fougères is also one of the control points for the Paris–Brest–Paris (PBP) bicycle event. PBP is an ultra-marathon event where cyclists are expected to complete the course in under 90 hours, and occurs the year before a Summer Olympic year. Fougères is a control point both out bound to Brest as well as back to Paris.

==Heritage==
Fougères is classified as a town of art and history since 1985. It houses 24 historical monuments and 87 buildings surveyed.

Fougères has the label &quot;tourisme et handicap&quot;, since July 2011.

===Castle===

Fougères&#x27; most visited attraction is the Château de Fougères, a medieval stronghold built atop a granite ledge, which was part of the Duchy of Brittany&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful defence against French aggression, and part of a tripartite with Vitré.

The castle is one of the most impressive French castles, occupying an area of , or even for some &quot;the largest medieval fortress of Europe.&quot; It consists of three enclosures whose walls have been preserved. Although the seigniorial is ruined, the thirteen towers still rise with majesty. Some of these towers can be visited (the Hallay Tower and Tower of the Hague (12th century), Raoul Tower (15th century) and the Mélusine Tower, erected in 1242 by Hugues of Lusignan). At the entrance, is a triple watermill. Access to the west curtain wall allows observation of the upper town ().

The castle and its surroundings has been classified as a historic monument by list of 1862, by order of 4 July 1928 and by order of 26 February 1953.

A representing the castle was issued on 18 January 1960.

===The belfry===
This was the first to be built in Brittany, in 1397, and also one of only three belfries in Brittany. The location serves as the centre of the weekend market. It symbolised the dynamism of a small-scale civil society seeking independence. Funded by local merchants, it allowed ordinary people access to timekeeping, previously the preserve of the church and nobility. Its architecture was inspired by the Flemish models which the drapers of Fougères discovered during their travels in Flanders. Engraved on the Bell is the inscription: &quot;In 1397 the market town of Fougères made me and my name is Roland Chapelle&quot;.

The belfry was classified as a historical monument by Decree of 1 September 1922.

===The Notre-Dame Gate===
A sizable section of the town wall survives, stretching from the château in the lower town, up the hill to surround the upper town. Medieval citizens in the lower town were outside the fortifications and had to retreat into the fortress in times of trouble. The gate of the 15th century with a double drawbridge presents many defenses including moats, embrasures, machicolations, etc., and a protective Virgin turned outwards. It is the only fortified town gate which is left.

The was listed a historical monument by Decree of 9 December 1946, with the south and west of the city walls.

===The Saint-Sulpice Church===

The dates in part from the 15th century. It was classified as a historical monument by Decree of 26 September 1910. There are two remarkable medieval altarpieces of monumental granite with carved decoration: The altarpiece of the Tanners and the altarpiece of Notre-Dame-des-Marais.

===The Church of Saint-Léonard===

The Church of Saint-Léonard also dates from the 15th century. It was listed a historical monument by Decree of 15 March 1949. Located at the top of the upper town, it offers a panoramic view of the city.

==Geography==

===Geology===
Fougères is situated in the Cadomian chain. The oldest buildings use readily available stone: &quot;la cornéenne&quot;. A metamorphic rock, difficult to cut and of very different appearance, it is very solid. Later came the use of Louvigné granite, which is more homogeneous. Most of the buildings of the town are built with these local materials. It took the arrival of the railway to import other stones (late 19th century). In military strategy, note that the castle is not on high, but on a deposit of &quot;la cornéenne&quot;, which prevents the risk of attacks by mining and from underground.

==Demography==
Fougères is an industrial town and its typical demographic trends show very well. In the 1850s, the Brittany town was &quot;moving in the manufacture of leather shoes to solve a crisis in the shoe industry.&quot; Success followed (the Cordier factory, for example) and Fougères saw its population increase by 124% from 9,344 inhabitants in 1856 to 20,952 in 1901, an increase of 11,608 people in less than 50 years (or more than the population of Vitré). At the beginning of the 20th century, Fougères became the capital of female footwear: &quot;...more than 12,000 workers are distributed in 40 factories. In 1946, they manufacture 10.7% of French production for town and fancy use and 7% of work shoes&quot; (Jérôme Cucarull). The crisis of the 1930s put what must be called an industrial district into difficulty, (Florent Le Bot). The mass-closure of SMEs and the concentration of employment into fewer companies (mainly Réhault, JB Martin and Morel et Gâté) provided a second wind to the Fougères industry (4,500 employees in 1966). The slowdown in growth during the second half of the 1960s, then the oil shock in 1973, caused a massacre in the footwear sector, particularly in February–March 1976, with the closure of three companies (Réhault, Morel et Gâté and Maunoir) and the dismissal of 1,140 employees. Since 2008 and the closure of Hasley, only the JB Martin company maintains the tradition of footwear production in Fougères (F. Le Bot, Laurence Héry).

In 2017, the commune had 20,418 inhabitants.

Since the end of World War II, the Trente Glorieuses boosted Fougères and the town increased its population until the 1975 census, arriving at almost 27,000 inhabitants.

By 1975, the town had suffered deeply from the oil crisis of 1973 and had been hit. The town was devastated by successive closures of factories from a crisis in the shoe sector, and refused the implantation of the Citroën company on its territory. The city struggled to recover and saw its population fall. The town went from a population of 26,610 in 1975 to 19,820 in 2008, a 26% decline in population in 34 years, although suburbanisation offset this decline. Today the shoe sector has a few hundred jobs in the town: For example, the JB Martin company remains in Fougères, even though it has completely relocated its production to Asia. The town is growing in relation to Rennes since the inauguration of the &quot;Autoroute des Estuaires&quot; in 2000, which provides access to Rennes in 30 minutes, and has achieved a satisfactory development based on the growth of more diversified economic activities. More than of business parks, between the motorway and the city centre, give an economic attractiveness to the area.

The has 20 communes gathering 42,818 inhabitants (2009) including 46% of this population which is in the town centre. This makes the Fougères urban area the 164th of 241 large urban areas of France.

Inhabitants of Fougères are called &quot;Fougerais&quot; (male) and &quot;Fougeraise&quot; (female) in French.

==Economy==
There used to be an important shoemaking industry which is now almost extinct. There was also an important glass making industry.

During the Middle Ages, salt was heavily taxed and was imported from the Breton regions to the rest of France. Fougères was made a stronghold for &quot;salt smugglers&quot;, who would creep along the wall of the city with confiscated salt, to sell in other regions. There is a communal garden in modern Fougères that commemorates this interesting and little-known fact.

Fougères was the seat of the until 2011, replaced since by a delegation from the after the merger of these.

In 2008, the major employers in Fougères were the Centre hospitalier de Fougères, -Safran Group, , the town of Fougères, the Transports Gélin, Carrefour (Sofodis), the Association Jean-Baptiste Le Taillandier (AREP and the Notre-Dame-des-Marais, Edmond Michelet, Saint-Joseph, and Beau-site schools), the Jean Guéhenno city school, the , and Groom, as well as Otima.

==Health==
The central hospital of Pays de Fougères has just completed its renovation in 2013: It offers access to 13 care services, emergency, maternity, 16 specialties and 440 beds.

The elderly have two suitable facilities: The Henri Rebuffé sheltered housing, opened in 1987 in the former premises of the &quot;Morel et Gaté&quot; firm in the Bonabry quarter, and the Cotterêts sheltered housing.

==Teaching==
Higher education is present at Fougères, notably in the field of health:

* Institute of nursing training (hospital)
* Bertin school of hearing aids (CCI Fougères training hub)
* Fizeau graduate school of Optics (CCI Fougères training hub)
* Charles-Edouard-Guillaume School of Fine Watchmaking (CCI Fougères training hub)
* The Fougères CCI Training Institute

==Planning and living environment==
The town has 38 . Several of them (chestnut, tulip trees, sequoia, araucaria) are visible in a private park on boulevard Saint-Germain.

===Quarters===
In Fougères, five councils of quarters have been implemented:

* Centre-ville - Urbanistes
* Forairie - Cotterêts
* Paron-Orieres - Écartelée - Bonabry
* Montaubert - Rillé - Saint-Sulpice
* Madeleine - Sermandiere - Chattiere

===Parks and green spaces===

<text>The 1971 Turkish military memorandum (), issued on 12 March that year, was the second military intervention to take place in the Republic of Turkey, coming 11 years after its 1960 predecessor. It is known as the &quot;coup by memorandum&quot;, which the military delivered in lieu of sending out tanks, as it had done previously. The event came amid worsening domestic strife, but ultimately did little to halt this phenomenon.

==Background==

As the 1960s wore on, violence and instability plagued Turkey. An economic recession late in that decade sparked a wave of social unrest marked by street demonstrations, labour strikes and political assassinations. Left-wing workers&#x27; and students&#x27; movements were formed, countered on the right by Islamist and militant Turkish nationalist groups. The left carried out bombing attacks, robberies and kidnappings; from the end of 1968, and increasingly during 1969 and 1970, left-wing violence was matched and surpassed by far-right violence, notably from the Grey Wolves. On the political front, Prime Minister Süleyman Demirel&#x27;s centre-right Justice Party government, re-elected in 1969, also experienced trouble. Various factions within his party defected to form splinter groups of their own, gradually reducing his parliamentary majority and bringing the legislative process to a halt.

By January 1971, Turkey appeared to be in a state of chaos. The universities had ceased to function. Students, emulating Latin American urban guerrillas, robbed banks and kidnapped US servicemen, also attacking American targets. The homes of university professors critical of the government were bombed by neo-fascist militants. Factories were on strike and more workdays were lost between 1 January and 12 March 1971 than during any prior year. The Islamist movement had become more aggressive and its party, the National Order Party, openly rejected Atatürk and Kemalism, infuriating the Turkish Armed Forces. Demirel&#x27;s government, weakened by defections, seemed paralyzed in the face of the campus and street violence, and unable to pass any serious legislation on social and financial reform. The immediate spur for the coup appears to have been the discovery of another scheduled for 9 March. It involved retired general and 1960 plotter Cemal Madanoğlu, &quot;Devrim&quot; editor Doğan Avcıoğlu and a group of left-wing junior officers. The high command responded by retiring all officers below four-star general connected with the plot.

==Memorandum==
It was in this atmosphere that on 12 March, the Chief of the General Staff, Memduh Tağmaç, handed prime minister Demirel a memorandum, really amounting to an ultimatum by the armed forces. It demanded &quot;the formation, within the context of democratic principles, of a strong and credible government, which will neutralise the current anarchical situation and which, inspired by Atatürk&#x27;s views, will implement the reformist laws envisaged by the constitution&quot;, putting an end to the &quot;anarchy, fratricidal strife, and social and economic unrest&quot;. If the demands were not met, the army would &quot;exercise its constitutional duty&quot; and take over power itself. Demirel resigned after a three-hour meeting with his cabinet; veteran politician and opposition leader İsmet İnönü sharply denounced any military meddling in politics. While the precise reasons for the intervention remain disputed, there were three broad motivations behind the memorandum. First, senior commanders believed Demirel had lost his grip on power and was unable to deal with rising public disorder and political terrorism, so they wished to return order to Turkey. Second, many officers seem to have been unwilling to bear responsibility for the government&#x27;s violent measures, such as the suppression of Istanbul workers&#x27; demonstrations the previous June; more radical members believed coercion alone could not stop popular unrest and Marxist revolutionary movements, and that the social and economic reformism behind the 1960 coup needed to be put into practice. Finally, a minority of senior officers concluded that progress within a liberal democratic system was impossible, and that authoritarianism would result in a more egalitarian, independent and &quot;modern&quot; Turkey; other officers felt they had to intervene, if only to forestall these radical elements.

The coup did not come as a surprise to most Turks, but the direction it would take was uncertain, as its collective nature made it difficult to discern which faction in the armed forces had seized the initiative. The liberal intelligentsia hoped it was the radical-reformist wing led by Air Force commander Muhsin Batur, who favoured implementing reforms envisaged by the 1961 constitution; they were thus encouraged by the memorandum. Their hopes were dashed when it turned out that the high command had taken power, animated by the spectre of a communist threat, and not a radical group of officers as in 1960. (There were rumours the high command had acted to pre-empt a similar move by junior officers; the notion was seemingly confirmed when a number of officers were retired soon afterwards.) The &quot;restoration of law and order&quot; was given priority; in practice this meant repressing any group viewed as leftist. On the day of the coup, the public prosecutor opened a case against the Workers&#x27; Party of Turkey for carrying out communist propaganda and supporting Kurdish separatism. He also sought to close all youth organisations affiliated with Dev-Genç, the Federation of the Revolutionary Youth of Turkey, blamed for the left-wing youth violence and university and urban agitation. Police searches in offices of the teachers&#x27; union and university clubs were carried out. Such actions encouraged vigilante action by the &quot;Idealist Hearths&quot;, the youth branch of the Nationalist Action Party; provincial teachers and Workers&#x27; Party supporters became prime targets. The principal motive for the suppression of the left seems to have been to curb trade union militancy and the demands for higher wages and better working conditions.

The commanders who seized power were reluctant to exercise it directly, deterred by the problems that faced the Greek junta. They had little choice but to rule through an Assembly dominated by conservative, anti-reformist parties and an &quot;above-party&quot; government which was expected to carry out the reforms. The military chiefs would give directives from behind the scenes. To lead this government, on 19 March they chose Nihat Erim, acceptable to the Justice Party and the more conservative faction of the Republican People&#x27;s Party. (This included İnönü, who embraced the generals once they picked his close associate, but the party&#x27;s general secretary Bülent Ecevit was infuriated and resigned from his post. For his part, Demirel cautioned his party to remain calm.) Erim appointed a technocratic cabinet from outside the political establishment to carry out the commanders&#x27; socio-economic reform programme. The regime rested on an unstable balance of power between civilian politicians and the military; it was neither a normal elected government, nor an outright military dictatorship which could entirely ignore parliamentary opposition.

==Aftermath==

In April, politics was eclipsed (and the envisaged reform put off until after 1973) when a new wave of terror began, carried out by the Turkish People&#x27;s Liberation Army, in the form of kidnappings with ransom demands and bank robberies. Intelligence sources confirmed rumours that dissident junior officers and military cadets were directing this force. On 27 April, martial law was declared in 11 of 67 provinces, including major urban areas and Kurdish regions. Soon, youth organisations were banned, union meetings prohibited, leftist (but not militant neo-fascist) publications proscribed and strikes declared illegal. After the Israeli consul was abducted on 17 May, hundreds of students, young academics, writers, trade unionists and Workers&#x27; Party activists—not just leftists but also people with liberal-progressive sympathies—were detained and tortured. The consul was shot four days later after a daytime curfew had been announced.

For the next two years, repression continued, with martial law renewed every two months. Constitutional reforms repealed some of the essential liberal fragments of the 1961 Constitution and allowed the government to withdraw fundamental rights in case of &quot;abuse&quot;. The National Intelligence Organization (MİT) used the Ziverbey Villa as a torture center, employing physical and psychological coercion. The Counter-Guerrillas were active in the same building, with interrogations directed by their mainly Central Intelligence Agency-trained specialists, and resulting in hundreds of deaths or permanent injuries. Among their victims was journalist Uğur Mumcu, arrested shortly after the coup, who later wrote that his torturers informed him even the president could not touch them.

Ferit Melen, who made little impression, took over the premiership in April 1972, followed a year later by Naim Talu, whose main task was to lead the country to elections. (An important reassertion of civilian influence took place in March–April 1973, when Demirel and Ecevit, normally at odds, both rejected the generals&#x27; choice for president, instead having Fahri Korutürk elected to the post by the Assembly.) By summer 1973, the military-backed regime had achieved most of its political tasks. The constitution was amended so as to strengthen the state against civil society; special courts were in place to deal with all forms of dissent quickly and ruthlessly (these tried over 3,000 people before their abolition in 1976); the universities, their autonomy ended, had been made to curb the radicalism of students and faculty; radio, television, newspapers and the constitutional court were curtailed; the National Security Council was made more powerful; and, once the Workers&#x27; Party was dissolved in July 1971, the trade unions were pacified and left in an ideological vacuum. That May, Necmettin Erbakan&#x27;s National Order Party had been shut down, which the government claimed showed its even-handedness in the anti-terror campaign, but he was not tried and allowed to resume his activities in October 1972; the Nationalist Movement Party and the right-wing terrorists who worked under its aegis were left conspicuously alone.

In October 1973, Ecevit, who had won control of the Republican People&#x27;s Party from İnönü, won an upset victory. Nevertheless, the very same problems highlighted in the memorandum re-emerged. A fragmented party system and unstable governments held hostage by small right-wing parties contributed to political polarization. The economy deteriorated, the Grey Wolves escalated and intensified political terrorism as the 1970s progressed, and left-wing groups too carried out acts aimed at causing chaos and demoralization (&quot;see Political violence in Turkey (1976–1980)&quot;). In 1980, seeking once again to restore order, the military carried out yet another coup.

In 2013, a monument was unveiled near the site of the Ziverbey Villa in Kadıköy. It commemorates the victims who were tortured inside the building following the coup.

<text>Blackheath Football Club is a rugby union club based in Well Hall, Eltham, in south-east London.
The club was founded in Blackheath in 1858 and is the oldest open rugby club in continuous existence in the world. The Blackheath club also assisted in organising the world&#x27;s first rugby international (between England and Scotland in Edinburgh on 27 March 1871) and hosted the first international between England and Wales ten years later – the players meeting and getting changed at the Princess of Wales public house. Blackheath, along with Civil Service F.C., is one of the two clubs that can claim to be a founder member of both The Football Association and the Rugby Football Union.

The club currently plays in National League 1, the third tier of the English rugby union system, with matches played at Well Hall after a move from Rectory Field in Blackheath at the end of the 2015–16 season.

==History==
===Early history===
The institution was founded as &quot;Blackheath Football Club&quot; in 1858 by old boys of Blackheath Proprietary School who played a &quot;carrying&quot; game of football made popular by Rugby School. When the old boys played against the current pupils, supporters would shout for either &quot;Club&quot; or &quot;School&quot; accordingly. This is why, to this day, supporters of BFC shout for &quot;Club&quot;, not for &quot;Blackheath&quot;. In 1863, the club developed the tactic of passing the ball from player to player as an alternative to the solo break and the &quot;kick and follow-up&quot;.
Blackheath is the fourth-oldest rugby club in continuous existence in the world, after Dublin University Football Club (1854), Liverpool St Helens F.C. (1857) and Edinburgh Academical Football Club (1857), but asserts it is the &quot;oldest independent Rugby club, meaning that it was not attached to any institution such as a military establishment, hospital, school or college.&quot;

In 1863 Blackheath was a founder member of The Football Association which was formed at the Freemasons&#x27; Tavern, Great Queen Street, on Lincoln Inn Fields, London 26 October 1863 with the intention to frame a code of laws that would embrace the best and most acceptable points of all the various methods of play under the one heading of &quot;football&quot;. Francis Maule Campbell, a member of Blackheath, was elected treasurer. At the fifth meeting Campbell argued that hacking was an essential element of &#x27;football&#x27; and that eliminating hacking would &quot;do away with all the courage and pluck from the game, and I will be bound over to bring over a lot of Frenchmen who would beat you with a week’s practice.&quot; At the sixth meeting on 8 December Campbell withdrew Blackheath, explaining that the rules that the FA intended to adopt would destroy the game and all interest in it. Other rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the Football Association. In this way the great divide between association football and rugby took place.

In December 1870, Edwin Ash, secretary of Richmond Football Club published a letter in the papers which said, &quot;Those who play the rugby-type game should meet to form a code of practice as various clubs play to rules which differ from others, which makes the game difficult to play.&quot; On 26 January 1871 a meeting attended by representatives from 22 clubs was held in London at the Pall Mall Restaurant. As a result of this meeting the Rugby Football Union (RFU) was founded. Three lawyers who had been pupils at Rugby School drew up the first laws of the game which were approved in June 1871. The Club is one of seven of the original twenty-one clubs to have survived to this day.

===Later history===

Blackheath initially played its matches on the Heath (meeting and changing at the Princess of Wales public house) but occasional interruptions from spectators led the club to move, initially to a private field (Richardson&#x27;s Field) in Blackheath before moving to the Rectory Field in 1883.

On 27 March 1871, England (captained by Blackheath&#x27;s captain and with three other Club players in the 20-strong side) played Scotland at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh, losing by one point. This was the first international rugby union game in history. Richardson&#x27;s Field hosted the first England v. Wales fixture on 19 February 1881, which England won, again with four Club players in the side. In 1982 Blackheath joined the list of winning teams at the Glengarth Sevens at Stockport R.U.F.C.

Blackheath were one of the opponents for The Original All Blacks on their 1905–06 northern hemisphere tour, the first-ever New Zealand rugby union tour outside of Australasia. The touring side ran out 32–0 victors. 

After 158 years it was announced that the 2015–16 season would be the last playing at the historic Rectory Field as the club had made the difficult decision to move to their training ground, Well Hall in Eltham, for the 2016–17 season to maximise matchday revenue and to continue developing for the future. Blackheath played their last game at the Rectory Field on 30 April 2016, beating Blaydon 45–17.
