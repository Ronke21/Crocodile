<text>In public policy, a sunset provision or sunset clause is a measure within a statute, regulation, or other law that provides for the law to cease to be effective after a specified date, unless further legislative action is taken to extend it. Unlike most laws that remain in force indefinitely unless they are amended or repealed, sunset provisions have a specified expiration date. Desuetude renders a law invalid after long non-use.

==Origin==
The roots of sunset provisions are laid in Roman law of the mandate but the first philosophical reference is traced in the laws of Plato. At the time of the Roman Republic, the empowerment of the Roman Senate to collect special taxes and to activate troops was limited in time and extent. Those empowerments ended before the expiration of an electoral office, such as the Proconsul. The rule &quot;Ad tempus concessa post tempus censetur denegata&quot; is translated as &quot;what is admitted for a period will be refused after the period&quot;. The same rules were applied in the Roman emergency legislation. The fundamental principle appeared in several areas of legislation and was later codified in the &quot;Codex Iustinianus&quot; (10, 61, 1). The principle was broken when Julius Caesar became dictator for life.

==Arguments==
Sunset provisions have been used extensively throughout legal history. The idea of general sunset provisions was discussed extensively in the late 1970s.
Sunset clauses with an effective extension review process have been argued as a safeguard of democracy to ensure emergency provisions, such as state of emergency, remain temporary. 
An increase in electoral accountability can be achieved with brief reviews resulting in a majority of provisions extended with no or cosmetic modifications and a record who advocates for extending the provisions. Sunset clauses with automatic expiration can reduce legal certainty and circumvent long-term budget constraints and regulatory impact analysis. Experimental regulations can test temporarily new legislative approaches. 

== By country==

===United States===
====Colonial and early state legislatures====
Sunset provisions were a frequent legislative tool used by the colonial and early state legislatures but would decrease in popularity as the legislatures were institutionalized.

====Federal level====
In American federal law parlance, legislation that renews an expired mandate is a &quot;reauthorization act&quot; or &quot;extension act&quot;. Extensive political wrangling often precedes reauthorizations of controversial laws or agencies. High-profile examples in American law include:

=====U.S. Constitution=====
Article I, Section 8, which enumerates the powers of Congress, includes a sunset provision for expenditures on “Armies,” but not the Navy:The Congress shall have Power&lt;br&gt;[…]&lt;br&gt;To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years;&lt;br&gt;To provide and maintain a Navy;&lt;br&gt;[…]
Article V contains a provision “that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article,” which, by its words, had sunsetted by 1808.

=====Sedition Act of 1798=====
Part of the Alien and Sedition Acts, the Sedition Act was a political tool used by John Adams and the Federalist Party to suppress opposition. The authors ensured the act would terminate at the end of Adams&#x27; term so that it could not be used by Democratic-Republicans against the President&#x27;s own party.

=====USA PATRIOT Act=====
Under §224 of the USA PATRIOT Act, several of the surveillance portions originally expired on December 31, 2005. These were later renewed, but expired again on March 10, 2006, and were renewed once more in 2010.

Section 102(b)(1), which states, &quot;the civil rights and civil liberties of all Americans, including Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, and Americans from South Asia, must be protected, and that every effort must be taken to preserve their safety&quot; was set to sunset on March 15, 2020. On March 15, 2020, the House of Representatives left the chamber without voting on an extension for the remaining provisions of the act, which sunset the following provisions:
* §201 Wiretapping for terrorism cases
* §202 Wiretapping for computer fraud and abuse
* §203(b) and (d) Sharing of wiretap and foreign intelligence information
* §§204, 206, 207, 214, 215, 218, and 225 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act related sections including roving wiretaps
* §209 Warranted seizure of voicemail messages
* §217 Computer trespasser communications
* §220 Nationwide service or warrants for electronic evidence
* §223 Privacy violation civil liability

=====Assault Weapons Ban=====
In 2004, the sunset provision of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban terminated the law.

=====Budget Act and the Byrd Rule=====
The Congressional Budget Act governs the role of Congress in the budget process. Among other provisions, it affects Senate rules of debate during the budget reconciliation, not least by preventing the use of the filibuster against the budget resolutions. The Byrd rule, named after its principal sponsor, Senator Robert C. Byrd, was adopted in 1985 and amended in 1990 to modify the Budget Act and is contained in section 313. The rule allows Senators to raise a point of order against any provision that is extraneous, where extraneous is defined according to one of several criteria. The definition of extraneous includes provisions that are outside the jurisdiction of the committee or that do not affect revenues nor outlays.

Importantly for sunset provisions, the Byrd rule also defines as extraneous provisions that &quot;...would increase the deficit for a fiscal year beyond those covered by the reconciliation measure.&quot; Since the Budget Act says the budget resolution covers at least the four years following the &quot;budget year,&quot; which is typically the year following the year it was adopted, that is the usual period of time. However, budget resolutions have covered periods as long as ten years, so a reconciliation measure may cover the ten years. This rule has the effect of allowing congress members to raise a point of order against any spending increase or tax cut that does not contain a sunset provision that ends it after five or ten years (conceivably longer). (Otherwise, the provision increases the deficit in a fiscal year after the period covered by the budget resolution.) Appealing or waiving a ruling based on the Byrd rule requires a three-fifths majority of 60 in the Senate. In short, a net effect of the Byrd Rule is to require that any spending increase or tax cut be approved by a majority of 60 if it does not contain a sunset provision. This is intended to assure there is no increase in the deficit after the budget resolution period (though there is an exception that, if the total effect on the deficit in a particular title is to not increase the deficit, the point of order is not triggered). With the sunset provision, only a simple majority is necessary in the budget reconciliation process.

=====Estate tax and other tax cuts of 2001=====
In the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 the US Congress enacted a phaseout of the federal estate tax over the following 10 years, so that the tax would be completely repealed in 2010. However, while a majority of the Senate favored the repeal, there was not a three-fifths supermajority in favor. Therefore, a sunset provision in the Act reinstates the tax to its original levels (and indeed, all tax cuts contained in the Act) on January 1, 2011, in order to comply with the Byrd Rule. Congress enacted new estate tax levels before the sunset provision was triggered.
====State level====
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, &quot;Colorado, Florida and Alabama passed the first sunset laws in 1976. Texas and 21 other states followed suit in 1977. Eventually, a total of 36 states passed broad sunset statutes&quot;; however, dissatisfaction with the sunset process left only 22 states still using it by 1992.

=====Texas=====
The Texas Sunset provision was established in 1977. Under Texas law, all agencies – except universities, courts, and agencies established by the Texas Constitution – will be abolished on a specific date, generally 12 years after creation or renewal, unless the Texas Legislature passes specific legislation to continue its functions.

A 12-member Sunset Advisory Commission oversees the provisions of the Texas Sunset Act. The commission consisting of five members of the Texas Senate and one member from the general public appointed by the Lieutenant Governor of Texas, and five members of the House and one member from the general public appointed by the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives. Legislative members are appointed for four-year terms, with half of the commission reappointed on or before September 1 of odd-numbered years, while public members serve two-year terms. The chairman and vice-chairman are appointed by the lieutenant governor and speaker, and the chairmanship alternates between the Senate and House every two years. The commission is assisted by an executive director and staff, who review each agency subject to sunset provisions.

Under the process, each agency must perform for the commission a self-review of its roles and responsibilities, including areas where its duties may overlap those of other agencies and the effect of the agency&#x27;s abolition on loss of federal funding. The self-review must be completed by September 1 of the odd-numbered year before the year when the agency would be otherwise abolished. The commission must then complete its own review by the following January 1 and hold public hearings by the following February 1.

About 20 to 30 agencies go through the sunset process each legislative session. Constitutionally established agencies are subject to review, but they cannot be abolished under the sunset provisions.

The commission may recommend that an agency be continued in its present form (nearly always with recommendations to the legislature for improvement), consolidated with another agency, or abolished, with its duties either eliminated or transferred to other agencies.

=====Other states=====
Alabama has a similar review process with a more limited number of agencies and a review cycle of every four years.

===United Kingdom===
A sunset clause was introduced by the House of Lords to some parts of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005; the act was eventually passed without it. Part 5 of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013, &quot;Reduction of legislative burdens&quot;, made provision for sunset and review provisions&quot; in secondary legislation, i.e.
*a power to review the effectiveness of the legislation within a specified period or at the end of a specified period
*provision for the legislation to cease to have effect at the end of a specified day or a specified period
*a power to consider whether the objectives which it was the purpose of the legislation to achieve remain appropriate and, if so, whether they could be achieved in another way.
The Coronavirus Act 2020 had a sunset clause provision of two years.

=== Canada ===
In Canada all legislation enacted under Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (subsection three of the &quot;notwithstanding clause&quot;) has an implied sunset clause of five years, this being the maximum length legislation enacted under the section may be operative for (unless an earlier date is specified).

The Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act contains a sunset clause that went into effect in February 2007.

Special laws enacted to deal with emergency situations often contain sunset clauses; Quebec&#x27;s Bill 78, had a sunset clause.

=== Australia ===
In 2005, the Australian Government decided to legislate new Anti-Terrorism laws. These laws have a sunset clause of ten years.

In 2007, the Liberal Democratic Party proposed a constitutional amendment to make sunset clauses compulsory in all legislation that lacks the support of a 75% parliamentary supermajority.

The Legislative Instruments Act 2003 legislates the automatic expiry of most legislative instruments (delegated legislation). Starting in 2015 these legislative instruments must be renewed or they expire automatically.

=== Germany ===
In the German legislation sunset provisions are applied on several federal levels.
The German constitution rules a general sunset provision of six months for emergency legislation. Some federal states, e.g., Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia sporadically add sunset provisions to bills.

=== South Korea ===
A sunset provision can be found in the Corporate Restructuring Promotion Act, which is to facilitate out-of-court workout of insolvent companies. This Act was effective during the period: 
:i) from January 2001 to December 2005 for the first time; and again
:ii) from January 2007 to December 2010.
The Act came into force for the third time on May 19, 2011, and was effective till December 2013. 
The main content of the Act has been kept intact for the purpose of constant corporate debt restructuring through market functions and promotion of speedy and smooth corporate restructuring, while some minor provisions were modified from time to time.

===Republic of China on Taiwan===
The Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China are a set of temporary articles of the original constitution that apply to the Free area of the Republic of China with a semi-presidential system. These articles that have a sunset provision that will terminate them in the event the ROC regains control of Mainland China.

=== New Zealand ===
The Electoral Integrity Act was passed in 1999 to discourage &quot;waka-jumping&quot; in a mixed-member proportional parliamentary system. The amendment expired as scheduled in 2005.

<doc id="880052" wikidata="Q215001" url="?curid=880052" title="Ellef Ringnes Island">
<text>Ellef Ringnes Island is an uninhabited island and one of the Sverdrup Islands in the Qikiqtaaluk Region, Nunavut, Canada. A member of the Queen Elizabeth Islands and Arctic Archipelago, it is located in the Arctic Ocean, east of Borden Island, and west of Amund Ringnes Island. It has an area of , making it the 69th largest island in the world (slightly larger than Jamaica) and Canada&#x27;s 16th largest island. Its highest mount is .

The island was named by Otto Sverdrup for Oslo brewer Ellef Ringnes, one of the sponsors of his expedition. It was first sighted by Europeans in 1901 by one of Sverdrup&#x27;s men. The island was then claimed by Norway from 1902 until the claim was relinquished in favour of Canada in 1930.

== History ==
The first known European sighting of Ellef Ringnes Island was in 1901 by a sledging party consisting of Gunerius Isachsen and Sverre Hassel, members of the Second Norwegian Arctic Expedition of 1898–1902, which was under the command of Otto Sverdrup. The island was named to honour Ellef Ringnes, one of the principal patrons of the expedition. At the time of the discovery of Ellef Ringnes Island, the expedition was based at Goose Fiord on the south coast of Ellesmere Island.

Isachsen and Hassel made their initial sighting of Ellef Ringnes Island on April 23 that year, as they rounded the southwest corner of Amund Ringnes Island, an island they had sighted and partly explored the previous year. The following day, Isachsen and Hassel travelled across Hassel Sound making a landfall at the southern extremity of the island. In the course of the following 20 days, they succeeded in circumnavigating Ellef Ringnes. The resulting map and notes on geological specimens are published in Otto Sverdrup&#x27;s narrative &quot;New Land&quot; (1904).

In 1948. the Canadian Department of Transport and the United States Weather Bureau jointly established a meteorological station at Isachsen. The station was in operation for thirty years. Drilling took place on the island in the seventies by Panarctic Oils.

A High Arctic Weather Station (HAWS) called Isachsen lies on the west coast of the island. It was opened April 3, 1948 as part of a joint Canada-United States military effort to support a weather station network. When it closed on September 19, 1978, it was replaced with an automatic weather station. The station represented the only known permanent human settlement of the island. In 1959-1961 it was the base of operation for The Polar Continental Shelf Project administered by the then Department of Mines and Technical Surveys now Natural Resources Canada; Polar Shelf as it was known supports research throughout the Arctic, it is now based in Resolute. In the late 1970s there was also a fair amount of oil exploration with a new runway built in the vicinity of the Isachsen Dome; no significant amount of gas or oil was reportedly found.

Ellef Ringnes Island was the last landmass to be visited by the Earth&#x27;s wandering north magnetic pole. In April and May 1994, Larry Newitt, of the Geological Survey of Canada, and Charles Barton, of the Geoscience Australia, conducted a survey to determine the average position of the north magnetic pole at that time. They established a temporary magnetic observatory on Lougheed Island, close to the predicted position of the pole. They determined that the average position of the north magnetic pole in 1994 was located on the Noice Peninsula, southwest Ellef Ringnes Island, at .

== Geology ==

The island is characterized by broad lowlands and locally by dissected uplands which reflect the diversity of structures and lithological characters of the bedrock formations. The island is rimmed by low shelving coastal areas, domal structures (salt dome) with cores of diapiric anhydrite and secondary gypsum constitute striking features of the landscape. Two major structural provinces of the Arctic Archipelago are represented: the Sverdrup basin which includes the greater part of the island and preponderant thickness of sediments: and the Arctic Coastal Plain, an area at the north-eastern extremity of the island. These salt domes create the highest topographic features. While most of the island is flat lying, the salt domes stand out clearly on satellite. There are seven domes, Dumbbells, Contour, Hoodoo, Malloch, Haakon, Helicopter and Isachsen Dome () which is the highest point on the island. On the north part of the island, there is a concentration of gabbro and diabase dikes and sills. Most of the rock is Jurassic to Cretaceous with the northern part (Isachsen Peninsula) being Tertiary. The Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks are varying formations of sandstone and shale. The sediment was deposited in the Sverdrup Basin. The salt diapirs are Carboniferous.

== Flora and fauna ==

Ellef Ringnes Island is interesting to biologists because of its extremely rigorous Arctic environment and its resulting meagre flora and fauna. Together with Amund Ringnes, Borden, Brock, King Christian, Lougheed, Mackenzie King and Meighen islands (the so-called northwestern Queen Elizabeth Islands) it constitutes the most barren part of the high Arctic region. Some idea of its bleakness is conveyed by the remarks of others who worked there. Vilhjalmur Stefansson (1921), on visiting Ellef Ringnes in June 1916, wrote &quot;I did not see a blade of grass and the district struck me as the most barren I had even seen&quot;; S. D. MacDonald (1961) who spent the field season of 1954 at Isachsen, stated, &quot;My immediate impression of Isachsen was of a region of utter desolation&quot;. Summers at Isachsen, the richest locality on the island, are colder than at any other Arctic weather station. Accordingly, Ellef Ringnes probably supports fewer forms of life than any other ice-free Arctic land mass of comparable size (). The total confirmed flora comprises 49 species of vascular plants and about 85 of fungi; only 10 species of mammals and 15 of birds have been recorded on the island. Mammals include muskox, Peary caribou, polar bears and Arctic foxes

<doc id="880053" wikidata="Q5460450" url="?curid=880053" title="Flora the Red Menace">
<text>Flora the Red Menace is a musical with a book by George Abbott and Robert Russell, music by John Kander, and lyrics by Fred Ebb. The original 1965 production starred Liza Minnelli in the title role in her Broadway debut, for which she won a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. This was the first collaboration between Kander and Ebb, who later wrote Broadway and Hollywood hits such as &quot;Cabaret&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;.

Although not full of well-known numbers (&quot;A Quiet Thing&quot; and &quot;Sing Happy&quot; aside), the score does present a valuable insight into the later work of Kander and Ebb. Like &quot;Cabaret&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;, it features a headstrong heroine and has a strong dose of political content.

==Productions==
&quot;Flora the Red Menace&quot; opened on Broadway at the Alvin Theatre on May 11, 1965, and closed on July 24, 1965, after 87 performances. The cast featured Liza Minnelli as Flora, Bob Dishy as Harry Toukarian and Cathryn Damon as Comrade Charlotte. Direction was by George Abbott, choreography by Lee Theodore, with scenic design by William and Jean Eckart, costume design by Donald Brooks and lighting design by Tharon Musser.

Liza Minnelli won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical, the youngest person to have done so at age 19.

&quot;Flora&quot; was not written for Minnelli, as is sometimes said; Robert Russell was rumored to have written the show as a vehicle for Barbra Streisand. George Abbott became involved, thinking it would be a vehicle for Eydie Gormé. Receiving promising out-of-town reviews in New Haven and Boston, the show was recorded two days before its Broadway opening. However, the New York critics were not enthusiastic, and when it closed it had lost almost all of its $400,000 investment.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer wrote: &quot;The voice [of Minnelli] is not yet distinctive ... She is going to be a popular singer, all right. It [Flora the Red Menace] has the appearance of being pasted together with bits and pieces. A promising idea has not been enlivened by a creative spark.&quot;

The musical was revived at the off-Broadway Vineyard Theatre in December 1987 with a new book by David Thompson. Directed by Scott Ellis with choreography by Susan Stroman, Flora was played by Veanne Cox with Peter Frechette as Harry. In the Vineyard Theatre revival, the story was told as though in a presentation by the Federal Theatre Project, part of the WPA established by President Roosevelt (voiced by Art Carney). A company of actors played all the roles, with obvious props and scenery, not trying to hide the &quot;amateur&quot; look and feel of the show.

Other notable productions include:

* Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, London RADA, GBS Theatre, UK, 1992
* Brighton Little Theatre, UK, 1998, directed by Simon Cross and musically directed by Gary Nock.
* Dundee Repertory Theatre, Scotland, autumn 2003.
* 42nd Street Moon (San Francisco, California) presented the musical in concert in November – December 2006.
* &quot;Reprise! Broadway&#x27;s Best&quot; production, Freud Theatre (Los Angeles, California); May 6 through May 18, 2008, with Eden Espinosa as Flora.
* Oberlin College, 2011, notable for John Kander returning to his alma mater to consult on the production.
* Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama Production, March 2023 in the Richard Burton Theatre directed by Georgie Rankcom.

==Plot synopsis==
In the winter of 1935, many people are unemployed due to the Great Depression, yet they seem to have hope (&quot;Prologue&quot;). Valedictorian and future fashion designer Flora Meszaros inspires and leads her graduating class in taking charge of the future before them (&quot;Unafraid&quot;). She applies at Gimbel&#x27;s, Saks Fifth Avenue, Macy&#x27;s and Altman&#x27;s before finally applying at Garret and Mellick&#x27;s where she meets Harry Toukarian, a fellow artist who stutters when he&#x27;s nervous. When she learns that the boss, Mr. Stanley, isn&#x27;t hiring, Flora tries impressing the secretary by saying that she is &quot;the most amazing miss in all of New York City.&quot; (&quot;The Kid Herself&quot;). During the song, Flora, Harry and the other artists sneak their designs into a box of Mr. Stanley&#x27;s merchandise, and after the secretary kicks them out, Flora asks Harry to coffee. The coffee date conversation starts about Flora&#x27;s previous employer, who paid her through the barter system and she ended up having to dig cemetery plots. Harry asks why she didn&#x27;t strike, and explains the concept to her after she shows incomprehension. This ends up with Flora punching Harry in the face and, after initial refusal, taking him to her studio. Flora rents out her studio to other artists, like a dancer named Maggie and her ex-boyfriend Kenny (&quot;All I Need is One Good Break&quot;).

Headstrong wannabe fashion designer Flora Meszaros is a member of an artists&#x27; co-operative of bohemian types – dancers, musicians, designers – struggling to find work during the Great Depression. Hoping to find a job which pays at least $15 a week, she is hired by the head of a large department store at $30. She falls in love with Harry Toukarian, another struggling designer, who attempts to convert Flora to his communist ideals.

Although it compromises her job in an organization that does not recognize the new unions, she seeks to hold down both job and relationship. Complicating matters is a predatory communist matriarch, Comrade Charlotte, who wants Harry for herself, a secretary with designs on her boss, and Kenny and Maggie, a jazz dancing duo with their sights on greater things. In the end, however, Flora finds herself torn between two vastly different ideals, and has to sacrifice one or the other for true happiness.

<doc id="880056" wikidata="Q635937" url="?curid=880056" title="Scary Movie 3">
<text>Scary Movie 3 is a 2003 American parody film directed by David Zucker. It is the sequel to &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot; and is the third film in the &quot;Scary Movie&quot; film series. The film parodies the horror, sci-fi, and mystery genres.

The film stars Anna Faris and Regina Hall reprising their roles as Cindy Campbell and Brenda Meeks, respectively. New cast members include Charlie Sheen, Simon Rex, Anthony Anderson, Kevin Hart, and Leslie Nielsen. It is the first film in the series to feature no involvement from the Wayans family. The characters of Ray Wilkins and Shorty Meeks, previously played by Shawn and Marlon Wayans respectively, do not appear, nor are they referenced.

The film&#x27;s plot significantly parodies the films &quot;The Ring&quot;, &quot;Signs&quot;, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;8 Mile&quot;. The film grossed $220.7 million worldwide, becoming the second highest-grossing film in the series. It is the last film in the series to be released by Miramax Films (under their then-subsidiary Dimension Films).

It was named the 2004 Teen Choice Awards in the category of &quot;Choice Movie: Your Parents Didn&#x27;t Want You to See&quot;. A sequel, &quot;Scary Movie 4&quot;, was released in 2006.

== Plot ==
Two women discuss a cursed videotape that kills anyone who watches it in seven days. Having both watched it, an unseen entity kills them. Meanwhile, on a farm outside Washington, D.C., widowed pastor Tom Logan and his brother George discover Tom&#x27;s daughter Sue screaming in the middle of a crop circle.

Reporter Cindy Campbell discusses the crop circles on the news, but it is largely ignored. She cares for her nephew Cody, who has precognition powers. While picking him up from school, Cindy meets George who invites her and Brenda Meeks to a rap-battle. With support from his friends Mahalik and CJ, George beats Fat Joe, but is thrown out after unintentionally wearing a pointy white hood and waves to the largely African American crowd.

Brenda tells Cindy about the cursed videotape she watched and asks her to keep her company. After playing several pranks on Cindy, the girl from the tape, Tabitha, kills Brenda. George receives a phone call about Brenda&#x27;s death, and Tom meets with Sayaman, who apologizes for killing Tom&#x27;s wife in a car accident.

During Brenda&#x27;s wake, George and Mahalik wreak havoc in an unsuccessful attempt to revive her. Cindy finds the tape in Brenda&#x27;s room, watches it, and receives a phone call warning her of her death in seven days. She calls George, CJ and Mahalik for help. CJ says his Aunt Shaneequa can help. Shaneequa discovers the hidden image of a lighthouse, which can break the curse if Cindy finds it. When Cindy returns home, she finds Cody has watched the tape.

Desperate to save Cody, Cindy types a warning into the news anchor&#x27;s teleprompter but her boss interrupts her and the anchor recites the wrong message. Meanwhile, the Logans encounter an alien disguised as Michael Jackson, and U.S. president Baxter Harris personally visits the farm to investigate the crop circles.

Cindy visits the lighthouse, where she encounters The Architect. The loquacious old man explains Tabitha was his evil adopted daughter whom his wife drowned in the farm&#x27;s well, but not before she imprinted her evil onto the VHS tape. He mistakenly returned it to Blockbuster, mistaking it for &quot;Pootie Tang&quot;, unleashing the curse. When Cindy asks about how this relates to the aliens, the Architect speculates that Tabitha is summoning them to aid her in destroying humanity.

Returning home, Cindy discovers Cody is missing, the news has been broadcasting the cursed tape for hours, and there have been various sightings of aliens around the world. She tracks Cody to the Logan farm, where he has taken refuge with George. Tom sends Cindy, Sue, and Cody into the basement for safety, as he, George and Mahalik go outside to fight the aliens with help from President Harris and the Secret Service. The aliens reveal they are friendly and have come to stop Tabitha after accidentally watching the tape on a broadcast they intercepted, also mistaking it for &quot;Pootie Tang&quot;.

In the basement, Cindy recognizes the farm&#x27;s cellar from the tape and she finds the well where Tabitha drowned. Tabitha appears and takes Cody hostage. Cindy and George appeal to her, offering her a place in their family. Tabitha falsely claims her curse is broken but as she attacks, President Harris opens the door and unintentionally knocks her into the well.

The aliens depart and Cindy and George get married. Leaving for their honeymoon, they realize they accidentally left Cody behind. After Cindy narrowly avoids hitting Cody at an intersection, another car strikes him.

== Production ==
On November 22, 2002, Dimension Films announced a third &quot;Scary Movie&quot; without the Wayans brothers (namely director Keenan Ivory Wayans and co-stars/co-writers Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans) returning, with David Zucker taking over as director. The movie was given the title &quot;Scary Movie 3: Episode I – Lord of the Brooms&quot;, and the movie was supposed to spoof the &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter&quot; franchises. In December 2002, it was announced that Kevin Smith had signed on to executive produce and co-write the film. Smith later dropped out from the film. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, who previously wrote an early draft for &quot;Scary Movie&quot; (2000), were set to write the movie. Zucker was going to shoot that script but eventually decided to not use it, instead using a new script written by Craig Mazin and Pat Proft that was more similar to the first two installments.

Filming started on March 12, 2003 and wrapped on July 16, 2003. The movie was shot in British Columbia and in Washington, D.C.

== Music ==
The score for the film was composed by James L. Venable. The original soundtrack was released on October 24, 2003, and features hip hop artists such as Buku Wise, Delinquent Habits, Dame Lee, Kebyar, and others. Frank Fitzpatrick served as music supervisor for the film and soundtrack. Jorge Corante produced and co-wrote the majority of original songs used for the feature.

== Release ==
=== Home media ===
==== Alternate scenes ====
The DVD edition includes a director&#x27;s audio commentary, several deleted scenes and alternate endings (with optional commentary). A &quot;3.5&quot; special DVD was also released, and contained several more deleted scenes than the original DVD, with an unrated version of the film.

In the alternate ending, Cindy is told Cody does not exist by her psychiatrist (played by William Forsythe). After hitting a few people in the face with a shovel, Cindy asks everybody who is not real to stand over at a different spot. Cody goes over there and is followed by Santa Claus. The aliens then begin to invade but George stops them by transforming into The Hulk. President Harris tries to hulk out but ends up soiling his pants. Cindy enters the Logan House, where she is attacked by Tabitha. She is teleported away to Aunt Shaneequa, who teaches her how to defeat Tabitha. Cindy must then confront hundreds of Tabitha&#x27;s. She wins the battle by performing moves from &quot;The Matrix&quot; and teleports back to the Logan House. The cast then gets into a car with the President, but are horrified to learn that the driver happens to be M. Night Shyamalan.

One of the scenes that appeared on the Extended DVD named &quot;Scary Movie 3.5&quot; was part of the unrated feature. After Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy shut off the TV, the two compliment each other on their good looks. Anderson then asks if McCarthy wants her &quot;shaved pussy&quot;, but this turns out to be a furless kitten.

In an extended scene, the person who runs Cody down at the end is shown to be Michael Jackson.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Scary Movie 3&quot; opened at the number one spot in the US, grossing $48.1 million in its opening weekend and $57.5 million for that week. In its second week, it grossed $24.7 million. At the end of its box office run, &quot;Scary Movie 3&quot; grossed $110 million in the US and $110.7 million internationally, making $220.7 million in total.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Scary Movie 3&quot; received a 35% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 129 critics, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Though an improvement over the second &quot;Scary Movie&quot;, the laughs are still inconsistent.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 49 out of 100 based on reviews from 27 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

<doc id="880062" wikidata="Q2438206" url="?curid=880062" title="David Teniers III">
<text>David Teniers III, also referred to as David Teniers junior (baptized 10 July 1638 – 2 October 1685) was a Flemish painter and tapestry designer who was mainly active in Antwerp, Madrid and Brussels. He is known for his portraits, religious compositions and genre scenes.

==Life==
David Teniers III was born in Antwerp where he was baptized on 10 July in the St. James&#x27; Church. He was a scion of two very prominent artist families from Antwerp: his father was the painter David Teniers the Younger and his mother was Anna Brueghel, the daughter of Jan Brueghel the Elder and granddaughter of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. His grandfather was the painter David Teniers the Elder. His father had close links with Peter Paul Rubens as is demonstrated by the fact that Rubens&#x27; second wife Helena Fourment was David III&#x27;s god-mother.

When his father was called to the court in Brussels around 1650 to become court painter to Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, the family Teniers moved from Antwerp to Brussels. Originally destined for an ecclesiastical career, David III showed such an aptitude for drawing and painting as a collaborator of his father that he chose to become a painter. David III&#x27;s mother died on 11 May 1656 and his father remarried on 21 October of the same year to Isabella de Fren, the 32-year-old daughter of Andries de Fren, secretary of the Council of Brabant.

His father sent him to Madrid in 1661 with a letter of recommendation from Luis de Benavides Carrillo, Marquis of Caracena, then governor of the Southern Netherlands. He left on 26 April 1661. He was active in Spain as a designer of cartoons for tapestries and as a portrait painter. He remained at the court of Philip IV of Spain until 1663. The Spanish king bestowed upon him the honorary title of gentleman of the artillery of His Majesty.
Upon his return to Flanders he married Ana María Bonnaerens on 4 August 1671 in Dendermonde. His wife was from a wealthy bourgeois family from Dendermonde. The couple had six children of whom the eldest, David Teniers IV (1672–1731), appears to have been yet another painter in the dynasty. David Teniers III kept a record of his household&#x27;s incomings and outgoings, which has been preserved and carries the title &quot;Handtboeck daer in staedt gespecificeert alle goederen ende gronden van erven, renten ende obligatiën, competerende aen d&#x27; Heer david teniers ende myne Huysvrouw, J. Anna Maria Bonnarens, die getrouwt zyn den 4. Augustus, 1671&quot; (Manual in which are specified all assets and funds inheritances, annuities and obligations belonging to Mr. David Teniers and his housewife Anne-Marie Bonnarens, who married
on 4 August 1671). It contains information about the household of the artist, which has been helpful in establishing some of the facts of his life.

He initially stayed at his father&#x27;s country estate and collaborated with his father on various projects. He seems to have been unhappy with his share in the payments received for some of their collaborative works. After settling in Brussels in 1675, he entered the local Guild of Saint Luke. He received Flemish as well as Spanish pupils including Frans Jochin, Lodewyk van der Vinne, Cascarillo and Jan van Diest.

He died in Brussels on 2 October 1685.

==Work==
David Teniers III painted portraits, genre scenes and religious compositions. He is stylistically close to the elegance of Anthony van Dyck or Gonzales Coques but remained thematically closer to the genre scenes painted by his father and grandfather.

David Teniers III was also sought after as a designer of tapestries. His main contribution here is the cartoons for genre scenes executed in the family tradition for tapestries, which were woven in the workshops of Brussels and Lille.

The Museo del Prado holds a series of works that have been attributed to him as well as several signed copies realized in 1673 after sketches of Rubens for a series of tapestries destined for the Monastery of the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales in Madrid.

<text>Dan Martin Nataniel Dahlin (; born 16 April 1968) is a Swedish former professional footballer who played as a striker. In his prime, he was considered one of the world&#x27;s best strikers.

Starting off his career with Malmö FF in 1987, he was the 1988 Allsvenskan top scorer and played for clubs in the Bundesliga, Serie A, and the Premier League before retiring in 1999.

A full international between 1991 and 1997, he won 60 caps for the Sweden national team and was in the Sweden national team that placed third in the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He also represented Sweden at the 1988 Summer Olympics and UEFA Euro 1992. In 1993, he was bestowed the Guldbollen as Sweden&#x27;s best footballer of the year.

==Early life==
Dahlin was born in Uddevalla, Sweden to a Nigerian father, who was a musician (Nat Atkins), and a Swedish mother. Named after Martin Luther King Jr., Dahlin spent his upbringing in Lund.

==Club career==
In 1993, he was selected as best Swedish player of the year, winning Guldbollen.

He played for Malmö FF, Borussia Mönchengladbach, A.S. Roma, Hamburger SV and Blackburn Rovers. The most successful time of his career he spent with Borussia Mönchengladbach with whom he won the German Cup in 1995 along with Stefan Effenberg.

Dahlin transferred from Roma to Blackburn Rovers in mid-1997 and made 21 appearances in the 1997–98 season, scoring four goals.

In the 1998–99 season, he only played five games when an injury in a training game ruled him out for the rest of the season and contributed to his retirement from the game after a short spell at Hamburger SV in 1999.

Blackburn Rovers later sued their insurance company who had refused to pay out over the injury claiming that normal wear and tear could have been a contributing factor. Although the initial verdict was given in favour of the club, in 2005 the Court of Appeal overturned the verdict and sent it back to the lower court. On 12 April 2006, the High Court ruled in favour of the insurance company, decreeing that the player probably had a pre-existing condition. This decision left Blackburn about £4 million out-of-pocket.

==International career==
Dahlin earned 66 caps for the Sweden men&#x27;s national team. He was in the Sweden men&#x27;s national team that finished third in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, scoring four goals in the tournament. He also was in the team that reached the semifinals of UEFA Euro 1992.

==Retirement==
Dahlin legally lives in Monaco. He lends his name to a clothing line. He speaks three languages – Swedish, English and German.

Dahlin became a sports agent working for former teammate Roger Ljung&#x27;s sport agency Roger Ljung Promotion AB. He has since formed his own agency called MD Management. He represents Ola Toivonen, Guillermo Molins, Markus Rosenberg, Jonas Olsson, Behrang Safari and Pontus Jansson.

<doc id="880065" wikidata="Q2538679" url="?curid=880065" title="Grand Mufti">
<text>The Grand Mufti (also called Chief Mufti, State Mufti and Supreme Mufti) is the head of regional muftis, Islamic , of a state. The office originated in the early modern era in the Ottoman Empire and has been later adopted in a number of modern countries.

Muftis are Islamic jurists qualified to issue a nonbinding opinion (fatwa) on a point of Islamic law (sharia). In the 15th century, muftis of the Ottoman Empire, who had acted as independent scholars in earlier times, began to be integrated into a hierarchical bureaucracy of religious institutions and scholars. By the end of the 16th century, the government-appointed mufti of Istanbul came to be recognized under the title &quot;Shaykh al-Islam&quot; (Turkish: &quot;şeyhülislam&quot;) as the Grand Mufti in charge of this hierarchy. The Ottoman Grand Mufti performed a number of functions, including advising the sultan on religious matters, legitimizing government policies, and appointing judges. After the dissolution the Ottoman Empire the office of the Grand Mufti has been adopted in a number of countries across the Muslim world, often serving the role of providing religious support for government policies. The Grand Mufti is generally an individual appointed by the state, although the office has collective or elective character in some modern countries.

==History==

Muftis are Muslim religious scholars who issue legal opinions (fatwas) interpreting sharia (Islamic law). The Ottoman Empire began the practice of giving official recognition and status to a single mufti, above all others, as the Grand Mufti. The Sheikh ul-Islam (or &quot;grand mufti&quot;) of Istanbul had, since the late 16th century, come to be regarded as the head of the religious establishment. He was thus not only pre-eminent but bureaucratically responsible for the body of religious-legal scholars and gave legal rulings on important state policies such as the dethronement of rulers. This practice was subsequently borrowed and adapted by Egypt for the head of its Dar al-Ifta (House of Fatwas) from the mid-19th century. From there, the concept spread to other Muslim states, so that today there are approximately 16 countries with sizable Muslim populations which have a Grand Mufti. The relationship between the Grand Mufti of any given state and the state&#x27;s rulers can vary considerably, both by region and by historical era.

== Election ==
===India===
The Grand Mufti of India is elected by the Sunni Barelvi Muslims and appointed by the Barelvi Sunni Muslims.

===Brunei===
The State Mufti of Brunei is nominated by the Sultan

===Jerusalem===
Throughout the era of British colonialism, the British retained the institution of Grand Mufti in some Muslim areas under their control and accorded the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem the highest political stature in Palestine. During World War I (1914–1918), there were two competing Grand Muftis of Jerusalem, one endorsed by the British and one by the Ottoman Empire. When Palestine was under British rule, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem was a position appointed by the British Mandate authorities. In the Palestinian National Authority, the administrative organization established to govern parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Grand Mufti is appointed by the president.

===Malaysia===
Malaysia has a unique system of collective mufti. Nine of the fourteen Malaysian states have their own constitutional monarchy; nine are ruled by their own constitutional monarch while the country is led by a monarch elected from the nine. These nine monarchs have authority over religious matters within their own states: therefore, each of these nine states have their own mufti who usually controls the Islamic Council or Islamic Department of the state. At the national level, a (Majlis Fatwa Kebangsaan) has been formed under the Department of Islamic Advancement of Malaysia (Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia or JAKIM). JAKIM appoints five Muftis for the five states which do not have monarchs. The muftis of the nine monarchical states, together with the five officials appointed by JAKIM in the National Council of Fatwā, collectively issue fatāwā at the national level.

===Mughal Empire===
In the Mughal Empire, the Grand Mufti of India was a state official.

===Ottoman Empire===
In the Ottoman Empire, the Grand Mufti was a state official, and the Grand Mufti of Constantinople was the highest of these.

===Saudi Arabia===
The Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, with office created in 1953, is appointed by the King.

===Tunisia===
According to Article 78 of the 2014 Constitution, the Grand Mufti of Tunisia is appointed and can be dismissed by the President of the Republic.

<text>Gerontius (; died 1489) was Metropolitan of Moscow and all Rus&#x27;, the primate of the Russian Orthodox Church, from 1473 until 1489. He was the fourth metropolitan in Moscow to be appointed without the approval of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople as had been the norm.

==Biography==
Gerontius was the Bishop of Kolomna. In 1473, he was appointed Metropolitan of Moscow. In the late 1470s, he was in conflict with Ivan III over, among other things, the consecration procedures of the new churches. During the Great standing on the Ugra river in 1480, Gerontius spoke for resisting the Golden Horde to the very end. He adhered to a moderate position in dealing with heresies, which had already plagued Moscow and Novgorod. In 1482, Gerontius left his post, though he would later return at the request of the Grand Prince. Gerontius died in 1489, and was buried in Dormition Cathedral, Moscow.

<text>The Sverdrup Islands is an archipelago of the northern Queen Elizabeth Islands, in Nunavut, Canada. The islands, part of the Arctic Archipelago, are situated in the Arctic Ocean, west of Ellesmere Island from 77° to 81° North and 85° to 106° West.

== History ==
The islands are named after Norwegian explorer Otto Sverdrup, who explored and mapped them from 1898 to 1902 with the vessel &quot;Fram&quot;, although Inuit previously inhabited some of them. Sverdrup claimed the islands for Norway, but the Norwegian government showed no interest in pursuing the claim until 1928. At that point, the Norwegian government raised the claim, primarily to use the islands as bargaining chips in negotiations with the United Kingdom over the status of two other islands: the Jan Mayen in the Arctic and Bouvet Island in the Antarctic. On 11 November 1930, Norway recognized Canadian sovereignty over the Sverdrup Islands. On 19 November 1930, the United Kingdom recognized Norwegian sovereignty over Jan Mayen.

== Geography ==
The main islands of the group are Axel Heiberg Island, Ellef Ringnes Island, Amund Ringnes Island, Cornwall Island, Graham Island, Meighen Island, King Christian Island, Stor Island, and the archipelago also includes a number of smaller islands in the surrounding waters. The only inhabited place was Isachsen, a formerly staffed weather station, 1948 through 1978, on Ellef Ringnes Island and McGill Arctic Research Station on Axel Heiberg Island (a research station occupied during the summer).

<text>Ellef Ringnes (25 October 184215 March 1929) was a Norwegian brewer and patron.

He was born at the Ringnes farm in Krødsherad, Buskerud to farmer Anders Knudsen Ringnes (1813–75) and his wife Maren Amundsdatter (1815–76). His father left the farm in 1855, and Ellef was employed as travelling salesman for Christiania Bryggeri at the age of 18. In 1876, he founded Ringnes &amp; Compani brewery with his brother Amund Ringnes and the businessman Axel Heiberg. It was the eighth brewery in Christiania (now Oslo), and later had its name changed to Ringnes Bryggeri.

The Ringnes brewery became successful, and Ellef Ringnes and his brother became patrons in Christiania. They invested in the construction of the Holmenkollen Line and sanatoriums in the Holmenkollen area. From 1896 to 1906, Ellef Ringnes was a member of the board of the Holmenkolbanen light rail company, which built and operated the Holmenkollen Line. Ellef and Amund Ringnes sponsored Fridtjof Nansen&#x27;s &quot;Fram&quot; expedition, which they in a short period of time led together with businessman Axel Heiberg and shipowner Thomas Fearnley. They also sponsored explorer Otto Sverdrup&#x27;s 1898–1902 &quot;Fram&quot; expedition; as a compensation Sverdrup named two discovered islands after them: Ellef Ringnes Island and Amund Ringnes Island.

On 30 June 1869, Ringnes married Karen Tonette (&quot;Kaja&quot;) Maartmann (1851–1933) with whom he had 14 children. His father-in-law was Knud Geelmuyden Fleischer Maartmann. In 1896, Ringnes became a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. In the same year, he bought Ringnes farm from his brother Amund, who earlier had inherited it from his father. Many parties were arranged at the farm house, to which both royal personages and prominent society members were invited. His residence at St. Hanshaugen Park, dubbed &quot;Cairo&quot; and &quot;Ringnes Castle&quot;, was likewise the scene of many parties in his lifetime. In 1901, Ringnes was succeeded by his brother-in-law Harald Sigvart Maartmann as managing director of Ringnes brewery. Maartman was in turn succeeded by his son Knud Maartmann Ringnes (1875–1945) in 1920.

Ringnes was decorated as Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1896, and upgraded to Commander of the First Class in 1908. He was also a Commander of the Legion of Honour. Ringnes was an honorary member of the Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish brewery associations. In 1930, a bust of him was erected at Holmenkollen. Ringnes died in Oslo on 15 March 1929, aged 86.

The Ringnes brewery became successful, and Amund Ringnes and his brother became benefactors in Christiania. They invested in the construction of the Holmenkollen Line and sanatoriums in the Holmenkollen area. They also sponsored Fridtjof Nansen&#x27;s &quot;Fram&quot; expedition, which they at one point led together with businessman Axel Heiberg and shipowner Thomas Fearnley. The explorer Otto Sverdrup&#x27;s 1898–1902 &quot;Fram&quot; expedition also received financial support from the two brothers; he named two discovered islands after them: Amund Ringnes Island and Ellef Ringnes Island.

On 19 September 1870, Ringnes married Laura Jensen (1850–1902). In 1896, his brother Ellef bought the Ringnes farm from him, which he earlier had inherited from his father. He said to his brother: &quot;Ellef, you have 14 children, and I have only six, so it is most correct that you own the farm&quot;. Amund Ringnes was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1898. He was upgraded to Commander, Second Class in 1902. In 1899, he built the country house Ringartun in Buskerud, where he maintained a hospitable home. He died on 13 January 1907 in Kristiania, aged 66. His grandson, Amund Ringnes (1905–80), became also a brewery owner at Ringnes brewery.

It is located in the Arctic Ocean, between 78 and 79 degrees of latitude. It lies east of Ellef Ringnes Island, west of Axel Heiberg Island. Hassel Sound separates Amund Ringnes Island from Ellef Ringnes Island. Hendriksen Strait is to the south, as is Cornwall Island. Norwegian Bay is to the east, as is Haig-Thomas Island. To the north lies Peary Channel.

The island has an area of in size, making it the 111th largest island in the world, and Canada&#x27;s 25th largest island.

The island was named by Otto Sverdrup for Oslo brewer Amund Ringnes, one of the sponsors of his expedition. He first sighted it in 1900. The island was claimed by Norway from 1902 until the claim was relinquished in 1930.

<text>Naval Reserve Merchant Marine Insignia was a breast insignia of officers in the United States Merchant Marine who also served in the United States Navy or United States Navy Reserve. The insignia was replaced by the Strategic Sealift Officer Warfare Insignia (SSOWI) in June 2011, per OPNAVINST 1534.1D.

The Merchant Marine Reserve had its beginnings in 1913 when it was called the Naval Auxiliary Reserve. The original merchant marine insignia was prescribed in &quot;Changes in Uniform Regulations, United States Navy, 1913 No. 10.&quot; Uniforms for the entire Naval Reserve were authorized by Congress on 31 March 1915 as the possibility of U.S. involvement in World War I increased.

The Naval Auxiliary Reserve, comprising officers and unlicensed seamen, was the beginning of the present Merchant Marine Reserve Program. Merchant marine officers at that time wore their steamship line or company uniform with the Naval Auxiliary Reserve device on the collar of the military coat, or on the lapels of the box coat. The Naval Auxiliary Reserve device was a miniature of the commissioned officers cap device.

==History==
In 1925, the Naval Auxiliary Reserve was renamed the Merchant Marine Naval Reserve. The name was changed to the Merchant Marine Reserve in 1938 and later the Strategic Sealift Officer Program. The breast insignia of the present Merchant Marine Reserve, U. S. Naval Reserve (Eagle and Scroll) was approved for wear on merchant marine uniforms on 7 April 1938, by Secretary of the Navy, Claude A. Swanson. It replaced the miniature cap device. The authorization for the insignia was the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, which states:

&quot;Licensed officers who are members of the United States Naval Reserve shall wear on their uniforms such special distinguishing insignia as may be approved by the Secretary of the Navy.&quot;

In April 1938, at a conference chaired by Captain Chester W. Nimitz, U.S. Navy, Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, the new insignia was presented to the four heads of the state maritime school ships. The insignia was accepted at this meeting along with the inclusion of naval subjects in the regular course of instruction at the schools. This was the beginning of the Naval Science Departments at the maritime academies.

Regulations require the insignia to be a &quot;gold embroidered or bronze gold plated metal pin consisting of a spread eagle surcharged with crossed anchors and shield.&quot; It is underset with a scroll bearing the letters &quot;U.S.&quot; on one side of the shield and &quot;N.R.&quot; on the other side. Originally, this insignia was to be worn on the merchant marine uniform.

The eagle design is based on the original eagle carved into the stern of the , which reflected the country&#x27;s determination to remain free. The scroll pattern was often found on the sterns of ships and contained the ships&#x27; names. The shield has 13 stars and stripes with crossed anchors and was taken from the U.S. Navy officer&#x27;s cap device which was first authorized in 1869. Following the design of the cap device, the original merchant marine insignia had the eagle looking to its own left. In 1941, Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox decreed that all Navy insignia bearing eagles were to have the heads facing to their own right.

Beginning in 1942, Merchant Marine Academy midshipman were authorized wear of the Navy Reserve Merchant Marine Insignia and could automatically display this badge on U.S. Navy uniforms upon acceptance of a commission as a reserve naval officer. By the 1990s, especially in light of the somewhat rigorous training requirements for the Surface Warfare Badge, the badge had drawn a negative connotation and was often referred to as the &quot;Sea Chicken&quot;. The Surface Warfare Officers School (SWOS) prohibited display of the badge by its students in 1998 and in 2011 the Navy discontinued the badge all together.

Afterwards, the new Strategic Sealift Officer Warfare Insignia was issued for merchant marine naval reserve officers, with this badge having qualification standards more identical with the standard surface warfare training pipeline.

==Current usage==
Beginning in 1942 the Secretary of the Navy authorized all US naval reserve midshipmen who were enrolled at the United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) to wear the USNR/MMR warfare pin. However, this rule was rescinded in 2011 when the final qualification for designation as a Navy Strategic Sealift Officer was changed. Presently, all US Navy Reserve Midshipmen at the United States Merchant Marine Academy wear the modified device of the former USNR/MMR insignia that no longer has the &quot;USNR&quot; letters on it. The new SSOP rules do not allow Strategic Sealift midshipmen to wear the SSOP insignia until after final qualification following graduation. 

According to U.S. Navy Instructions, in order to qualify for the new SSOWI, candidates shall:
* Obtain a commission as an officer in the U.S. Navy or Navy Reserve at a minimum rank of ensign through one of the following sources:
** Graduation from the USMMA at Kings Point, NY or one of the state maritime academies in Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Texas, California, or at the Great Lakes Maritime Academy.
** Successfully complete the Naval Science curriculum while serving under a training and service agreement.
* Direct appointment of officers, under standards established by the Commander, Navy Recruiting Command, who possess an active U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) unlimited officer credential at the minimum level of a chief mate or first assistant engineer with current standards of training, certificate and watchkeeping (STCW) endorsement and are employed in a position deemed mission useful by the Strategic Sealift Officer Program Manager (SSOPM).
* Via a change of designator by Navy Reserve officers originally commissioned through other programs, or inter-service transfer of officers from other reserve components who possess at a minimum that of an active USCG second mate or second assistant engineer unlimited tonnage and horsepower officer credential with current STCW endorsement, and are employed in a position deemed mission useful by the SSOPM.
* Obtain and maintain an unlimited tonnage and/or horsepower USCG Merchant Mariner credential.
* Complete formal Navy training as required by Commander, Military Sealift Command and the Strategic Sealift Officer Program sponsor, as prescribed by the SSOPM.
** An example of this training is completing the Naval Science curriculum at the USMMA.

<text>Zürich Altstetten railway station () is a railway station in the Altstetten quarter of the Swiss city of Zürich. The station is located on the Zürich to Olten main line and is the junction for the Zürich to Zug via Affoltern am Albis line.

The station is served by lines , , , , , and of the Zürich S-Bahn. It is also a calling point for the hourly InterRegio services that link Basel to Zurich Airport via Zürich Hauptbahnhof, and Bern to Zürich via Olten.

The station is well connected to the ZVV network, with bus and tram stops on both sides of the station. Since 2022 the station also serves as the eastern terminus of the Limmattal light rail line.

== History ==
The first station on the site was built by the Swiss Northern Railway in 1847, as part of their pioneering line from Zürich to Baden, and hence was one of the first railway stations in Switzerland. Over time, this line became today&#x27;s Zürich to Olten main line and the principal rail route between Zürich and northern and western Switzerland. The Zürich to Zug via Affoltern am Albis line opened in 1864, making Altstetten into a junction station. In 1907, the Swiss Federal Railways, who had taken over both lines, opened a workshop near the station.

== Layout ==
The station has one side platform and two island platforms, served by five tracks, and has station buildings and entrances on both the north and south sides of the station. The platforms and entrances are connected by a pair of pedestrian subways. The tracks are numbered 2–4 and 6–7.

There are two stations with tram and bus services. &quot;Bhf. Altstetten Nord&quot; is located north to the railway station, while &quot;Bahnhof Altstetten&quot; is situated south of the station. Route 4 of the Zürich tram system serves the &quot;Bhf. Altstetten Nord&quot; station, whilst route 31 of the Zürich trolleybus system passes the south side of the station (&quot;Bahnhof Altstetten&quot;). Zürich bus routes 35, 78, 80, 83, 89 and 485 also serve the south side of the station, whilst routes 304 and 307 both terminate at &quot;Bhf. Altstetten Nord&quot;.

Since December 2022, the Limmattal light rail line (route 20) terminates at &quot;Bahnhof Altstetten&quot; station. The light rail line has its own platforms, across the station plaza from platform two of the S-Bahn services. This service, operated by AVA, runs through the Limmat Valley region and connects to the Zürich tram network at Farbhof, just to the west of Altstetten station.

<text>Zosimus the Bearded (; died 1494) was Metropolitan of Moscow and all Rus&#x27;, the primate of the Russian Orthodox Church, from 1490 to 1494. He was the fifth metropolitan in Moscow to be appointed without the approval of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople as had been the norm.

For the first time in Russian history, Zosimus was appointed metropolitan by the decision of the council of the Russian bishops by order of the Grand Prince Ivan III. 

==Biography==
He was the author of the work conceptualizing Moscow as the third Rome. He had been archimandrite of the Simonovskii Monastery in Moscow when he was picked to replace Metropolitan Gerontii some six months after Gerontii&#x27;s death.

Archbishop Gennady of Novgorod had uncovered the Heresy of the Judaizers in 1487 and Zosimus&#x27;s entire metropolitanate was overshadowed by this crisis. Gennady wrote a letter in 1490 to Zosimus and other bishops in the Russian church demanding a council be convened and the heresy be dealt with. The council convened less than a month after Zosimus&#x27; elevation to the metropolitan throne and condemned the heresy. Gennady demanded that the heretics be severely punished - hanged and burned - and not merely incarcerated, but Zosimus and Grand Prince Ivan III opposed these harsher methods. Zosimus was eventually accused of being a secret heretic and, on 17 May 1494, he was removed from the metropolitan throne on charges of heresy and sodomy. He died before any trial was held.

Zosimus is known for having compiled a list of banned books and written an epistle against heretics.

<text>Lars Edvin &quot;Lasse&quot; Lagerbäck (; born 16 July 1948) is a Swedish football manager and former player.

Lagerbäck has managed a number of national teams prior to his current position. He managed the Sweden national team from 1998 until 2009, leading Sweden to five consecutive tournaments. He resigned as manager in 2009, after Sweden failed to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. After a short stint as manager of Nigeria, he led Iceland to unprecedented success as they qualified for their first finals competition, UEFA Euro 2016, and reached the quarter-finals, beating England in the last 16. Apart from his coaching duties, Lagerbäck has in recent years been a pundit for Premier League and UEFA Champions League broadcasting on Swedish television. He currently holds the record for managing a team in the finals of the European Championships with four appearances.

==Playing career==
Born in Katrineholm and raised in Ovansjö, Medelpad, in his youth, Lagerbäck played for Alby FF. When he was 13 years old, he began playing for their P16 team.

After completing his upper secondary school studies at the end of the 1960s, Lagerbäck studied political science and economics at Umeå University in northern Sweden. On the side of his studies, he also played football for Gimonäs CK under the guidance of Calle Lindelöf. He continued to play there until 1974 and worked as a club clerk from 1970. Over the course of the following years, he played twice for the club in the qualifying rounds to division two in the Swedish League without success. Lagerbäck himself played midfielder, but was often an unused substitute.

In 1974, he attended the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences, where he was a classmate of current assistant coach Roland Andersson.

==Managing career==
===Club-level===
In 1977, he was called up to the senior team. It was former teammate Kjell Pettersson that recommended him to Kilafors. He coached the Division IV team until 1982. In 1983, he moved to Arbrå IK until 1985. In 1987, he took over Hudiksvall ABK but left in 1989.

===Sweden===
In 1990, Lagerbäck took a job with the Swedish Football Association. He began as a coach for the junior levels which included Freddie Ljungberg. He helped Tommy Svensson and Tord Grip with the Sweden national team.

In 1996, Lagerbäck took over the Sweden B national team, until 1997. In 1998, Tommy Söderberg chose him to be the assistant coach for the Sweden national team. In 2000, he was promoted to dual-coach, a responsibility he shared with Söderberg until 2004. Under their guidance, the Sweden national team qualified for UEFA Euro 2000 but was eliminated in the group stages.

In 2002, they led Sweden to the 2002 FIFA World Cup, where Sweden were drawn in the &#x27;group of death&#x27;, together with England, Argentina and Nigeria. Sweden won the group but subsequently lost against Senegal in the first knockout round. In 2004, Sweden qualified for their third straight championship. At UEFA Euro 2004, Sweden made it to the quarter-finals where they lost to the Netherlands. That same year, Tommy Söderberg left the Sweden national team to coach the Sweden U21 team.

After the departure of Söderberg, Lagerbäck appointed Roland Andersson as assistant coach. In 2006, Lagerbäck took Sweden to their fourth consecutive championship, the first time in Swedish history. He led Sweden to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, losing against Germany 2–0 in the knockout stage. Under Lagerbäck, Sweden also qualified for UEFA Euro 2008, however they were eliminated in the group stage after losing 2–0 against Russia. The team&#x27;s early dismissal from the tournament led sport columnists to ask Lagerbäck to be sacked. Despite this, he signed an extension, which kept him until the end of the 2010 FIFA World Cup campaign. After Sweden&#x27;s unsuccessful qualification campaign, Lagerbäck resigned and was replaced by Erik Hamrén.

===Iceland===
On 4 October 2011, KSÍ&#x27;s chief executive Geir Þorsteinsson reported that talks had begun over the appointment of Lagerbäck as the new manager of the Icelandic national team. The appointment was then confirmed ten days later. Under Lagerbäck, Iceland qualified for the play-off stage of the qualification tournament for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, but Croatia were the victors over two legs. Shortly thereafter Lagerbäck signed a new contract, this time as joint manager with his former Iceland assistant Heimir Hallgrímsson, who took over as sole manager with Lagerbäck&#x27;s retirement following UEFA Euro 2016, where Iceland famously reached the quarter-finals, beating England in the last 16. They went out to France in the quarter-finals. Lagerbäck won 30 votes as a write-in candidate in the 2016 Icelandic presidential election.

He was later (2020-2021) the technical advisor of the Iceland national football team.

===Norway===
On 1 February 2017, Lagerbäck was announced as the new manager for Norway, signing a contract lasting until the end of 2019. On 26 March, Lagerbäck took charge of his first game as manager of Norway, which resulted in a 2–0 defeat to Northern Ireland in Belfast. His tenure as manager was considered somewhat mixed in terms of success. In December 2020, Lagerbäck was fired from his role as national team manager, being replaced by Ståle Solbakken.

<text>Saxicola (Latin: &quot;saxum&quot;, rock + &quot;incola&quot;, dwelling in), the stonechats or chats, is a genus of 15 species of small passerine birds restricted to the Old World. They are insectivores occurring in open scrubland and grassland with scattered small shrubs.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1802. The type species was subsequently designated as the European stonechat. The name &quot;Saxicola&quot; is from Latin &quot;saxum&quot;, &quot;saxi&quot; &quot;stone&quot; and &quot;-cola&quot; &quot;dweller&quot;.

The genus was formerly included in the thrush family Turdidae, but as with several other related genera, has now been shown to be correctly classified in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae, in which it is most closely related to the genera &quot;Oenanthe&quot; (wheatears) and &quot;Campicoloides&quot;.

Genetic and behavioural evidence has also resulted in several new species being accepted in the genus in recent years, most notably the splitting of the former broad &quot;species&quot; common stonechat &quot;Saxicola torquatus&quot; into five species, a change now widely though not yet universally accepted. With addition of mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence and nDNA fingerprinting data, it was confirmed that not only the Fuerteventura and Réunion stonechats are distinct species, but that in addition, the African, Madagascar, European, Siberian and Amur stonechats are also all separate species. Due to confusion of subspecies allocation, the name &quot;S. torquatus&quot; was briefly used for the European species, with the African stonechat being incorrectly listed as &quot;S. axillaris&quot;.

Owing to misunderstandings of Latin syntax, several species have in the past been widely but incorrectly cited with feminine name endings (&quot;S. torquata, S. maura, S. leucura, S. ferrea&quot;, etc.).

===Species===
The following 15 species are currently accepted in &quot;Saxicola&quot;:

Formerly included in the genus &quot;Saxicola&quot;, but now treated in a separate genus:
* Splendid fairywren, as &quot;Saxicola splendens&quot;
* Buff-streaked chat, as &quot;Saxicola bifasciatus&quot;

===Fossil record===
* &quot;Saxicola lambrechti&quot; (Late Miocene of Polgardi, Hungary) 
*&quot;Saxicola baranensis&quot; (Pliocene of Beremend, Hungary)
*&quot;Saxicola parva&quot; (Pliocene of Csarnota, Hungary)
*&quot;Saxicola magna&quot; (Pliocene of Beremend, Hungary)

<text>Identity is the set of qualities, beliefs, personality traits, appearance, or expressions that characterize a person or a group.

Identity emerges during childhood as children start to comprehend their self-concept, and it remains a consistent aspect throughout different stages of life. Identity is shaped by social and cultural factors and how others perceive and acknowledge one&#x27;s characteristics. The etymology of the term &quot;identity&quot; from the Latin noun &quot;identitas&quot; emphasizes an individual&#x27;s &quot;sameness with others&quot;. Identity encompasses various aspects such as occupational, religious, national, ethnic or racial, gender, educational, generational, and political identities, among others.

Identity serves multiple functions, acting as a &quot;self-regulatory structure&quot; that provides meaning, direction, and a sense of self-control. It fosters internal harmony and serves as a behavioral compass, enabling individuals to orient themselves towards the future and establish long-term goals. As an active process, it profoundly influences an individual&#x27;s capacity to adapt to life events and achieve a state of well-being. However, identity originates from traits or attributes that individuals may have little or no control over, such as their family background or ethnicity.

In sociology, emphasis is placed by sociologists on collective identity, in which an individual&#x27;s identity is strongly associated with role-behavior or the collection of group memberships that define them. According to Peter Burke, &quot;Identities tell us who we are and they announce to others who we are.&quot; Identities subsequently guide behavior, leading &quot;fathers&quot; to behave like &quot;fathers&quot; and &quot;nurses&quot; to act like &quot;nurses&quot;.

In psychology, the term &quot;identity&quot; is most commonly used to describe personal identity, or the distinctive qualities or traits that make an individual unique. Identities are strongly associated with self-concept, self-image (one&#x27;s mental model of oneself), self-esteem, and individuality. Individuals&#x27; identities are situated, but also contextual, situationally adaptive and changing. Despite their fluid character, identities often feel as if they are stable ubiquitous categories defining an individual, because of their grounding in the sense of personal identity (the sense of being a continuous and persistent self).

== Usage ==
Mark Mazower noted in 1998: &quot;At some point in the 1970s this term [&quot;identity&quot;] was borrowed from social psychology and applied with abandon to societies, nations and groups.&quot;

==In psychology==
Erik Erikson (1902–94) became one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in identity. An essential feature of Erikson&#x27;s theory of psychosocial development was the idea of the ego identity (often referred to as the &quot;self&quot;), which is described as an individual&#x27;s personal sense of continuity. He suggested that people can attain this feeling throughout their lives as they develop and is meant to be an ongoing process. The ego-identity consists of two main features: one&#x27;s personal characteristics and development, and the culmination of social and cultural factors and roles that impact one&#x27;s identity. In Erikson&#x27;s theory, he describes eight distinct stages across the lifespan that are each characterized by a conflict between the inner, personal world and the outer, social world of an individual. Erikson identified the conflict of identity as occurring primarily during adolescence and described potential outcomes that depend on how one deals with this conflict. Those who do not manage a resynthesis of childhood identifications are seen as being in a state of &#x27;identity diffusion&#x27; whereas those who retain their given identities unquestioned have &#x27;foreclosed&#x27; identities. On some readings of Erikson, the development of a strong ego identity, along with the proper integration into a stable society and culture, lead to a stronger sense of identity in general. Accordingly, a deficiency in either of these factors may increase the chance of an identity crisis or confusion.

The &quot;Neo-Eriksonian&quot; &quot;identity status&quot; paradigm emerged in 1966, driven largely by the work of James Marcia. This model focuses on the concepts of &quot;exploration&quot; and &quot;commitment&quot;. The central idea is that an individual&#x27;s sense of identity is determined in large part by the degrees to which a person has made certain explorations and the extent to which they have commitments to those explorations or a particular identity. A person may display either relative weakness or strength in terms of both exploration and commitments. When assigned categories, there were four possible results: identity diffusion, identity foreclosure, identity moratorium, and identity achievement. Diffusion is when a person avoids or refuses both exploration and making a commitment. Foreclosure occurs when a person does make a commitment to a particular identity but neglected to explore other options. Identity moratorium is when a person avoids or postpones making a commitment but is still actively exploring their options and different identities. Lastly, identity achievement is when a person has both explored many possibilities and has committed to their identity.

Although the self is distinct from identity, the literature of self-psychology can offer some insight into how identity is maintained. From the vantage point of self-psychology, there are two areas of interest: the processes by which a self is formed (the &quot;I&quot;), and the actual content of the schemata which compose the self-concept (the &quot;Me&quot;). In the latter field, theorists have shown interest in relating the self-concept to self-esteem, the differences between complex and simple ways of organizing self-knowledge, and the links between those organizing principles and the processing of information.

Weinreich&#x27;s identity variant similarly includes the categories of identity diffusion, foreclosure and crisis, but with a somewhat different emphasis. Here, with respect to identity diffusion for example, an optimal level is interpreted as the norm, as it is unrealistic to expect an individual to resolve all their conflicted identifications with others; therefore we should be alert to individuals with levels which are much higher or lower than the norm – highly diffused individuals are classified as diffused, and those with low levels as foreclosed or defensive. Weinreich applies the identity variant in a framework which also allows for the transition from one to another by way of biographical experiences and resolution of conflicted identifications situated in various contexts – for example, an adolescent going through family break-up may be in one state, whereas later in a stable marriage with a secure professional role may be in another. Hence, though there is continuity, there is also development and change.

Laing&#x27;s definition of identity closely follows Erikson&#x27;s, in emphasising the past, present and future components of the experienced self. He also develops the concept of the &quot;metaperspective of self&quot;, i.e. the self&#x27;s perception of the other&#x27;s view of self, which has been found to be extremely important in clinical contexts such as anorexia nervosa. Harré also conceptualises components of self/identity – the &quot;person&quot; (the unique being I am to myself and others) along with aspects of self (including a totality of attributes including beliefs about one&#x27;s characteristics including life history), and the personal characteristics displayed to others.

==In social psychology==
At a general level, self-psychology explores the question of how the personal self relates to the social environment. Theories in &quot;psychological&quot; social psychology explain an individual&#x27;s actions in a group in terms of mental events and states. However, some &quot;sociological&quot; social psychology theories go further by dealing with the issue of identity at the level of both individual cognition and collective behavior. George C. Homans, former President of the American Sociological Association, in a study of group outcomes, found that social isolation would lead to increasingly random and unpredictable behavior. Such a notion was explored in depth during the 1970s period of transition, among others by cultural historian Christopher Lasch, in his bestselling book The Culture of Narcissism. 

===Collective identity===

Many people gain a sense of positive self-esteem from their identity groups, which furthers a sense of community and belonging. Another issue that researchers have attempted to address is the question of why people engage in discrimination, i.e., why they tend to favour those they consider a part of their &quot;in-group&quot; over those considered to be outsiders. Both questions have been given extensive attention by researchers working in the social identity tradition. For example, in work relating to social identity theory, it has been shown that merely crafting cognitive distinction between in- and out-groups can lead to subtle effects on people&#x27;s evaluations of others.

Different social situations also compel people to attach themselves to different self-identities which may cause some to feel marginalized, switch between different groups and self-identifications, or reinterpret certain identity components. These different selves lead to constructed images dichotomized between what people want to be (the ideal self) and how others see them (the limited self). Educational background and occupational status and roles significantly influence identity formation in this regard.

===Identity formation strategies===
Another issue of interest in social psychology is related to the notion that there are certain &quot;identity formation strategies&quot; which a person may use to adapt to the social world. Cote and Levine developed a typology which investigated the different manners of behavior that individuals may have. Their typology includes:

Kenneth Gergen formulated additional classifications, which include the &quot;strategic manipulator&quot;, the &quot;pastiche personality&quot;, and the &quot;relational self&quot;. The strategic manipulator is a person who begins to regard all senses of identity merely as role-playing exercises, and who gradually becomes alienated from their social self. The pastiche personality abandons all aspirations toward a true or &quot;essential&quot; identity, instead viewing social interactions as opportunities to play out, and hence become, the roles they play. Finally, the relational self is a perspective by which persons abandon all sense of exclusive self, and view all sense of identity in terms of social engagement with others. For Gergen, these strategies follow one another in phases, and they are linked to the increase in popularity of postmodern culture and the rise of telecommunications technology.

==In social anthropology==

Anthropologists have most frequently employed the term &quot;identity&quot; to refer to this idea of selfhood in a loosely Eriksonian way properties based on the uniqueness and individuality which makes a person distinct from others. Identity became of more interest to anthropologists with the emergence of modern concerns with ethnicity and social movements in the 1970s. This was reinforced by an appreciation, following the trend in sociological thought, of the manner in which the individual is affected by and contributes to the overall social context. At the same time, the Eriksonian approach to identity remained in force, with the result that identity has continued until recently to be used in a largely socio-historical way to refer to qualities of sameness in relation to a person&#x27;s connection to others and to a particular group of people.

The first favours a primordialist approach which takes the sense of self and belonging to a collective group as a fixed thing, defined by objective criteria such as common ancestry and common biological characteristics. The second, rooted in social constructionist theory, takes the view that identity is formed by a predominantly political choice of certain characteristics. In so doing, it questions the idea that identity is a natural given, characterised by fixed, supposedly objective criteria. Both approaches need to be understood in their respective political and historical contexts, characterised by debate on issues of class, race and ethnicity. While they have been criticized, they continue to exert an influence on approaches to the conceptualisation of identity today.

These different explorations of &#x27;identity&#x27; demonstrate how difficult a concept it is to pin down. Since identity is a virtual thing, it is impossible to define it empirically. Discussions of identity use the term with different meanings, from fundamental and abiding sameness, to fluidity, contingency, negotiated and so on. Brubaker and Cooper note a tendency in many scholars to confuse identity as a category of practice and as a category of analysis. Indeed, many scholars demonstrate a tendency to follow their own preconceptions of identity, following more or less the frameworks listed above, rather than taking into account the mechanisms by which the concept is crystallised as reality. In this environment, some analysts, such as Brubaker and Cooper, have suggested doing away with the concept completely. Others, by contrast, have sought to introduce alternative concepts in an attempt to capture the dynamic and fluid qualities of human social self-expression. Stuart Hall for example, suggests treating identity as a process, to take into account the reality of diverse and ever-changing social experience. Some scholars have introduced the idea of identification, whereby identity is perceived as made up of different components that are &#x27;identified&#x27; and interpreted by individuals. The construction of an individual sense of self is achieved by personal choices regarding who and what to associate with. Such approaches are liberating in their recognition of the role of the individual in social interaction and the construction of identity.

Anthropologists have contributed to the debate by shifting the focus of research: One of the first challenges for the researcher wishing to carry out empirical research in this area is to identify an appropriate analytical tool. The concept of boundaries is useful here for demonstrating how identity works. In the same way as Barth, in his approach to ethnicity, advocated the critical focus for investigation as being &quot;the ethnic boundary that defines the group rather than the cultural stuff that it encloses&quot;, social anthropologists such as Cohen and Bray have shifted the focus of analytical study from identity to the boundaries that are used for purposes of identification. If identity is a kind of virtual site in which the dynamic processes and markers used for identification are made apparent, boundaries provide the framework on which this virtual site is built. They concentrated on how the idea of community belonging is differently constructed by individual members and how individuals within the group conceive ethnic boundaries.

As a non-directive and flexible analytical tool, the concept of boundaries helps both to map and to define the changeability and mutability that are characteristic of people&#x27;s experiences of the self in society. While identity is a volatile, flexible and abstract &#x27;thing&#x27;, its manifestations and the ways in which it is exercised are often open to view. Identity is made evident through the use of markers such as language, dress, behaviour and choice of space, whose effect depends on their recognition by other social beings. Markers help to create the boundaries that define similarities or differences between the marker wearer and the marker perceivers, their effectiveness depends on a shared understanding of their meaning. In a social context, misunderstandings can arise due to a misinterpretation of the significance of specific markers. Equally, an individual can use markers of identity to exert influence on other people without necessarily fulfilling all the criteria that an external observer might typically associate with such an abstract identity.

Boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive depending on how they are perceived by other people. An exclusive boundary arises, for example, when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others. An inclusive boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages. Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not. Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer&#x27;s use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity. But they might also perceive it as imposing an exclusive boundary that is meant to mark them off from the person. On the other hand, those who do understand the newcomer&#x27;s language could take it as an inclusive boundary, through which the newcomer associates themself with them to the exclusion of the other people present. Equally, however, it is possible that people who do understand the newcomer but who also speak another language may not want to speak the newcomer&#x27;s language and so see their marker as an imposition and a negative boundary. It is possible that the newcomer is either aware or unaware of this, depending on whether they themself knows other languages or is conscious of the plurilingual quality of the people there and is respectful of it or not.

== In religion ==
A religious identity is the set of beliefs and practices generally held by an individual, involving adherence to codified beliefs and rituals and study of ancestral or cultural traditions, writings, history, mythology, and faith and mystical experience. Religious identity refers to the personal practices related to communal faith along with rituals and communication stemming from such conviction. This identity formation begins with an association in the parents&#x27; religious contacts, and individuation requires that the person chooses the same or different religious identity than that of their parents.

The Parable of the Lost Sheep is one of the parables of Jesus. it is about a shepherd who leaves his flock of ninety-nine sheep in order to find the one which is lost. The parable of the lost sheep is an example of the rediscovery of identity. Its aim is to lay bare the nature of the divine response to the recovery of the lost, with the lost sheep representing a lost human being.

Christian meditation is a specific form of personality formation, though often used only by certain practitioners to describe various forms of prayer and the process of knowing the contemplation of God.

In Western culture, personal and secular identity are deeply influenced by the formation of Christianity, throughout history, various Western thinkers who contributed to the development of European identity were influenced by classical cultures and incorporated elements of Greek culture as well as Jewish culture, leading to some movements such as Philhellenism and Philosemitism.

==Implications==

Due to the multiple functions of identity which include self regulation, self-concept, personal control, meaning and direction, its implications are woven into many aspects of life.

===Identity changes===

==== Contexts Influencing Identity Changes ====
Identity transformations can occur in various contexts, some of which include:

# Career Change: When individuals undergo significant shifts in their career paths or occupational identities, they face the challenge of redefining themselves within a new professional context.
# Gender Identity Transition: Individuals experiencing gender dysphoria may embark on a journey to align their lives with their true gender identity. This process involves profound personal and social changes to establish an authentic sense of self.
# National Immigration: Relocating to a new country necessitates adaptation to unfamiliar societal norms, leading to adjustments in cultural, social, and occupational identities.
# Identity Change due to Climate Migration: In the face of environmental challenges and forced displacement, individuals may experience shifts in their identity as they adapt to new geographical locations and cultural contexts.
# Adoption entails exploring alternative familial features and reconciling with the experience of being adopted, which can significantly impact an individual&#x27;s self-identity.
# Illness Diagnosis: The diagnosis of an illness can provoke an identity shift, altering an individual&#x27;s self-perception and influencing how they navigate life. Additionally, illnesses may result in changes in abilities, which can affect occupational identity and require adaptations.

==== Immigration and identity ====
Immigration and acculturation often lead to shifts in social identity. The extent of this change depends on the disparities between the individual&#x27;s heritage culture and the culture of the host country, as well as the level of adoption of the new culture versus the retention of the heritage culture. However, the effects of immigration and acculturation on identity can be moderated if the person possesses a strong personal identity. This established personal identity can serve as an &quot;anchor&quot; and play a &quot;protective role&quot; during the process of social and cultural identity transformations that occur.

==== Occupational identity ====
Identity is an ongoing and dynamic process that impacts an individual&#x27;s ability to navigate life&#x27;s challenges and cultivate a fulfilling existence. Within this process, occupation emerges as a significant factor that allows individuals to express and maintain their identity. Occupation encompasses not only careers or jobs but also activities such as travel, volunteering, sports, or caregiving. However, when individuals face limitations in their ability to participate or engage in meaningful activities, such as due to illness, it poses a threat to the active process and continued development of identity. Feeling socially unproductive can have detrimental effects on one&#x27;s social identity. Importantly, the relationship between occupation and identity is bidirectional; occupation contributes to the formation of identity, while identity shapes decisions regarding occupational choices. Furthermore, individuals inherently seek a sense of control over their chosen occupation and strive to avoid stigmatizing labels that may undermine their occupational identity.

===== Navigating stigma and occupational identity =====
In the realm of occupational identity, individuals make choices regarding employment based on the stigma associated with certain jobs. Likewise, those already working in stigmatized occupations may employ personal rationalization to justify their career path. Factors such as workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life play significant roles in these decisions. Individuals in such jobs face the challenge of forging an identity that aligns with their values and beliefs. Crafting a positive self-concept becomes more arduous when societal standards label their work as &quot;dirty&quot; or undesirable. Consequently, some individuals opt not to define themselves solely by their occupation but strive for a holistic identity that encompasses all aspects of their lives, beyond their job or work. On the other hand, individuals whose identity strongly hinges on their occupation may experience a crisis if they become unable to perform their chosen work. Therefore, occupational identity necessitates an active and adaptable process that ensures both adaptation and continuity amid shifting circumstances.

== Factors shaping the concept of identity ==
The modern notion of personal identity as a distinct and unique characteristic of individuals has evolved relatively recently in history beginning with the first passports in the early 1900s and later becoming more popular as a social science term in the 1950s. Several factors have influenced its evolution, including:

# Protestant Influence: In Western societies, the Protestant tradition has underscored individuals&#x27; responsibility for their own soul or spiritual well-being, contributing to a heightened focus on personal identity.
# Development of Psychology: The emergence of psychology as a separate field of knowledge and study starting in the 19th century has played a significant role in shaping our understanding of identity.
# Rise of Privacy: The Renaissance era witnessed a growing sense of privacy, leading to increased attention and importance placed on individual identities. 
# Specialization in Work: The industrial period brought about a shift from undifferentiated roles in feudal systems to specialized worker roles. This change impacted how individuals identified themselves in relation to their occupations.
# Occupation and Identity: The concept of occupation as a crucial aspect of identity was introduced by Christiansen in 1999, highlighting the influence of employment and work roles on an individual&#x27;s sense of self.
# Focus on Gender Identity: There has been an increased emphasis on gender identity, including issues related to gender dysphoria and transgender experiences. These discussions have contributed to a broader understanding of diverse identities.
# Relevance of Identity in Personality Pathology: Understanding and assessing personality pathology has highlighted the significance of identity problems in comprehending individuals&#x27; psychological well-being.

<text>In post-tonal music theory, identity is similar to identity in universal algebra. An identity function is a permutation or transformation which transforms a pitch or pitch class set into itself. Generally this requires symmetry. For instance, inverting an augmented triad or C4 interval cycle, 048, produces itself. Performing a retrograde operation upon the tone row 01210 produces 01210. Doubling the length of a rhythm while doubling the tempo produces a rhythm of the same durations as the original.

In addition to being a property of a specific set, identity is, by extension, the &quot;family&quot; of sets or set forms which satisfy a possible identity. These families are defined by symmetry, which means that an object is invariant to any of various transformations; including reflection and rotation.

George Perle provides the following example:
:&quot;C-E, D-F, E-G, are different instances of the same interval [interval-4]...[an] other kind of identity...has to do with axes of symmetry . C-E belongs to a family [sum-4] of symmetrically related dyads as follows:&quot;

C=0, so in mod12, the interval-4 family:

Thus, in addition to being part of the sum-4 family, C-E is also a part of the interval-4 family (in contrast to sum families, interval families are based on difference).

<text>Bülach () is a historic town and a municipality in Switzerland in the canton of Zürich. It is the administrative capital of Bülach district. It is situated in the Glatt Valley (German: &quot;Glattal&quot;) to the east of the small river Glatt and about south of the High Rhine and about north of the Zurich Airport.

The official language of Bülach is Swiss Standard German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.

==History==

Bülach is first mentioned in 811 as &quot;Pulacha&quot;. From early times it fell within the province of the Alamanni. Joachim Werner&#x27;s description of the early cemetery excavated there was published in 1953.

==Geography==
Bülach has an area of . Of this area, 33.2% is used for agricultural purposes, 39.5% is forested, 26.9% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (0.4%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains).

The municipality is located around the lower Glatt Valley. The town of Bülach and the village of Niederflachs are in the valley. Around the town are the hamlets of Heimgarten am Rinsberg, Eschenmosen (since 1919, earlier part of Winkel) and Nussbaumen am Dettenberg. The municipality of Bachenbülach was part of Bülach until 1849 when it became an independent municipality. Bülach is located on the old road from Zürich through Kloten to Eglisau.

The historical population of Bülach is listed in the following table:
==Demographics==
Bülach has a population (as of ) of . , 22.6% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years the population has grown at a rate of 17.8%. Most of the population () speaks German (83.9%), with Italian being second most common ( 4.7%) and Serbo-Croatian being third ( 2.5%).

In the 2007 election the most popular party was the SVP which received 38.3% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the SPS (17%), the CSP (12.5%) and the FDP (11.2%).

The age distribution of the population () is as follows: children and teenagers (0–19 years old) make up 23.1% of the population, while adults (20–64 years old) make up 64.8% and seniors (over 64 years old) make up 12.2%. In Bülach about 73.2% of the population (between age 25–64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a &quot;Fachhochschule&quot;).

==Attractions==
The Reformed Church and the popular Sigristenkeller gallery stand on a small hill, and are surrounded by pretty old buildings, including the Pfarrhaus and the old Tithe Barn. The church is named after Saint Laurentius, to whom the town&#x27;s coat of arms is dedicated. Saint Laurentius was deacon to Pope Sixtus II, and became a martyr when he was condemned to death by fire in 258 AD. The church forms a well-matched unit with the Town Hall, and has a tower rising above it to a height of 74 meters. Also on the first Saturday of every month at 6pm, trumpeters play for half an hour from the top of the tower.

Duke Leopold III of Austria (Habsburg) granted Bülach a town charter in 1384, including its own jurisdiction and the right to hold its own market.

==Economy and transport==
One of the most important institutions in the town and its biggest employer (over 700 employees) is the regional hospital Spital Bülach with 200 beds. Other important employers include the traditional glass producer Vetropack, civil engineering firm Mageba, and the Zürcher Unterländer newspaper.

Bülach has an unemployment rate of 3.07%. , there were 130 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 36 businesses involved in this sector. 1893 people are employed in the secondary sector and there are 133 businesses in this sector. 5596 people are employed in the tertiary sector, with 607 businesses in this sector.

Bülach railway station is a node of the Zürich S-Bahn on the lines S41 and S9. Its train station is a 24-minute (S9) ride from Zürich Hauptbahnhof.

It also has a direct bus link from Zurich Airport which takes 25 minutes on 530 service.

==Education==
The primary schools include &quot;Schuleinheit Böswisli&quot;, &quot;Schuleinheit Schwerzgrueb&quot;, &quot;Schuleinheit Lindenhof&quot;, and &quot;Schuleinheit Hohfuri&quot;.

Lower secondary schools include &quot;Schule Hinterbirch&quot; and &quot;Schule Mettmenriet&quot;.

<text>Saturn Girl (Imra Ardeen) is a superheroine appearing in comics published by DC Comics. A talented telepath from the 30th century, Saturn Girl is a founding member of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Imra&#x27;s &quot;Saturn Girl&quot; title refers to her homeworld of Titan, Saturn&#x27;s largest moon. There have been three versions of Imra since her original debut, separated by the events of the limited series &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot; and &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;.

Saturn Girl has appeared in various media outside comics, primarily those featuring the Legion of Super-Heroes. Kari Wahlgren voiced her in the animated series &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot; (2006), and reprised the role in &quot;Young Justice&quot;. In live-action, Saturn Girl has been portrayed by Alexz Johnson and Amy Jackson in &quot;Smallville&quot; and &quot;Supergirl&quot; respectively.

==Publication history==
Saturn Girl first appeared in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #247 (April 1958), and was created by Otto Binder and Al Plastino.

==Fictional character biography==
===Silver Age===

During the Silver Age of comics, 30th-century Earth is a member of the United Planets and home to its military branch, the Science Police. Imra Ardeen leaves her homeworld of Titan to join the Police as a teenager, during which she, Rokk Krinn, and Garth Ranzz foil an assassination attempt on fellow passenger and billionaire R. J. Brande. At Brande&#x27;s urging, the three form the Legion of Super-Heroes, inspired by the legacy of Superboy, who they later recruit from the 20th century.

As a Legionnaire, Imra gains a reputation for self-sacrifice; just prior to the leadership elections of 2975, she learns that a Legionnaire will die during an attack on Earth and decides to take on the responsibility herself. However, Lightning Lad defies her orders and dies instead. Saturn Girl later attempts to sacrifice herself to resurrect Lightning Lad, but Proty does so instead. Despite this series of events, Imra&#x27;s leadership is highly valued in the Legion, and her position as leader, despite its means of acquisition, is allowed to stand. She earned a second term the following year. As leader of the Legion, Saturn Girl is the first female comic book character to head a group of superheroes.

Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad later marry and have two children, Graym and Garridan. The latter is kidnapped by Darkseid shortly after birth and transformed into Validus. Validus becomes an enemy of the Legion as a member of the Fatal Five before Darkseid returns him to normal.

Saturn Girl rejoins the Legion after helping stop Universo from conquering Earth. During the &quot;Five Year Gap&quot;, Earth&#x27;s government becomes hostile to the Legion, and Garth is incapacitated by a Winathian plague. Disillusioned by the government and feeling needed more at home, Imra resigns from the Legion and returns to Winath to become a farmer. She and Garth have two additional children, daughters Dacey and Dorritt.

===Post-Zero Hour===


After the reboot of the Legion in &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot;, Imra remains known as Saturn Girl, and a founder of the Legion along with Cosmic Boy and Live Wire. Her design was changed from previous versions, combining some elements from past uniforms. The top and pants of her uniform are similar in design to her red and white uniform, but now colored pink instead of red, and has the familiar Saturn logo.

Following Invisible Kid&#x27;s resignation, Saturn Girl becomes the leader of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Later, following Lightning Lad&#x27;s death, she resigns and returns to Titan to undergo therapy before Lightning Lad is resurrected in a crystal clone of Element Lad&#x27;s body.

===&quot;Threeboot&quot;===

In the 2005 revamp of the Legion, Saturn Girl and other Titanians solely using telepathy to communicate and lack vocal cords. Her mother holds a high position in the United Planets and helped create the current alliance between them and the Legion.

===Post-Infinite Crisis===
The events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; restore an analogue of the pre-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; Legion to continuity. Writer Geoff Johns commented on the character:

===DC Rebirth===
In &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Saturn Girl travels to the present day and is imprisoned in Arkham Asylum after being deemed insane. During the &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot; storyline, she and Rorschach escape Arkham before Doctor Manhattan alters the timeline, erasing the former from existence. However, Superman convinces Manhattan to undo his alterations to the timeline, restoring Saturn Girl and the Legion.

===The New Golden Age===
In &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, Saturn Girl is among the Legion of Super-Heroes members who arrive in the present and confront the Justice Society over their decision to recruit Legionnaire, a young, heroic incarnation of Mordru.

== Powers and abilities ==
Saturn Girl is a Titanian who possesses innate telepathic abilities, enabling her to sense and manipulate minds and generate illusions and blasts of psychic energy. As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, she is provided a Legion Flight Ring, which allows her to fly and protects her from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments.

<doc id="880130" wikidata="Q4831145" url="?curid=880130" title="Ayelet Waldman">
<text>Ayelet Waldman (, born December 11, 1964) is an Israeli-American novelist and essayist. She has written seven mystery novels in the series &quot;The Mommy-Track Mysteries&quot; and four other novels. She has also written autobiographical essays about motherhood. Waldman spent three years working as a federal public defender and her fiction draws on her experience as a lawyer.

==Biography==
Ayelet Waldman was born in Jerusalem. Her grandparents on both sides were Jewish immigrants to North America from Ukraine early in the 20th century. Her father, Leonard, was from Montreal, Canada, but was living in Israel when he met her mother, Ricki. After they married, they moved to Jerusalem. After the Six-Day War in 1967, the family moved back to Montreal, then Rhode Island, finally settling in Ridgewood, New Jersey, when Waldman was in sixth grade.

She was raised in a Jewish family, attended Hebrew school and Jewish summer camps, and lived on a kibbutz in Israel for a year while in the tenth grade. She has said that her parents were atheists, but very Jewish, and that her &quot;whole life was immersed in Judaism, but in a very specific kind of Labor–Zionist Judaism.&quot; Despite this, she did not celebrate becoming a bat mitzvah.

Waldman attended Wesleyan University, where she studied psychology and government, and studied in Israel in her junior year, graduating in 1986. She returned to Israel after college to again live on a kibbutz, but found it too sexist for her taste. She then entered Harvard Law School and graduated with a J.D. in 1991.

Waldman has been married to fellow author Michael Chabon since 1993. They live in a 1907 Craftsman house in the Elmwood district of Berkeley, California.
The couple work from the same office in the backyard of their home. They edit each other&#x27;s work, and offer each other advice on writing, sometimes going on &quot;plot walks&quot; to discuss issues.

Many characters in her fiction are Jewish. Her novel &quot; Love and Treasure &quot; is about the Holocaust.

Waldman has written several times about her 2002 diagnosis of bipolar disorder, an illness that runs in her family, and has spoken publicly about parenting while having a mental illness.

==Legal and academic career==
After graduating from law school, Waldman clerked for a federal judge, worked in a large corporate law firm in New York for a year, and then moved to California with Michael Chabon, where she became a criminal defense lawyer. Waldman was a federal public defender for three years in the Central District of California. Chabon mentioned on their first date that it was his intention to care for his children so his wife could pursue her career, which he did after the birth of their first and second children. After the birth of her first child, she tried juggling legal work with mothering, then left her job to be with her husband and child. This was short-lived.

Waldman was an adjunct professor at the Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley from 1997 to 2003. She also worked as a consultant to the Drug Policy Alliance, a resource center advocating a drug policy based on harm reduction. While working as an adjunct professor, she found writing scholarly articles uninteresting and intimidating, so she began writing fiction instead. According to Waldman, her fiction is &quot;all about being a bad mother.&quot; Waldman said she would not return to the legal profession. In her fiction Waldman has drawn extensively on her legal experience.

==Literary career==
Waldman has written various online and print articles about mothering while at home on maternity leave after the birth of her first child and again after she left her job as a public defender. She has at various times said that she chose to write because it was not as time-consuming a career as the law, because it gave her something to do during naptimes, it kept her entertained, because she was starved of someone to laugh at her jokes and because it gave her a way of putting off going back to work.

===&quot;Mommy-Track Mysteries&quot;===
In 1997, Waldman started writing mystery novels, thinking they would be &quot;easy … light and fluffy.&quot; At first she wrote in secret, then with her husband&#x27;s encouragement. She has said that she chose mysteries because they are primarily about plot. Waldman has said that her first mystery work, eventually published as &quot;Nursery Crimes&quot;, was her first attempt at creative writing, describing it as her first piece of fiction &quot;aside from my legal briefs.&quot;

Waldman wrote seven novels about the &quot;part-time sleuth and full-time mother&quot; Juliet Applebaum. Waldman has said of Juliet, &quot;She is me, well, she was me,&quot; and &quot;They say to write what you know … so I wrote exactly what I knew.&quot; Like Waldman, Juliet is a , red-headed former public defender with a nocturnal writer for a husband, who has become a stay-at-home mother but finds it boring. To relieve her boredom, Juliet works as a part-time detective. The collective title of the series is &quot;The Mommy-Track Mysteries&quot;. The novels are humorous and Waldman has said of her criminals, &quot;My villains aren&#x27;t villains. They&#x27;re people whose crime you understand.&quot; Waldman has previously said that &quot;Bye-Bye, Black Sheep&quot; is likely to be the last, but her agent&#x27;s website notes that she is working on more mysteries.

===Novels===
In addition to the mystery genre, Waldman has published three other novels. &quot;Daughter&#x27;s Keeper&quot;, published in 2003, drew on Waldman&#x27;s experience as a criminal defense lawyer and representation of drug offenders. The first manuscript was rejected thirty-one times. It features a young woman, Olivia, who inadvertently becomes involved in the trafficking of drugs and her relationship with her emotionally reserved mother. The book is also about the impact of federal drug policy, particularly mandatory minimum sentencing, on the criminal justice system. The novel was inspired by a case Waldman handled. The book was generally well received and was a finalist for the 2003 Northern California Book Award.

&quot;Love and Other Impossible Pursuits&quot;, published in 2006, is about a Harvard-educated lawyer with a precocious stepson who loses a newborn child to SIDS. The impetus was the loss of her own unborn child diagnosed with a genetic abnormality. The book also deals with how mothers criticize each other&#x27;s mothering, a theme in Waldman&#x27;s nonfiction too. It explores negative feelings towards one&#x27;s own children. The novel was also reviewed well in places, although some reviews were negative.

Don Roos wrote and directed a film based on the novel, starring Natalie Portman, Lisa Kudrow and Scott Cohen. The film premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in August 2009.

Waldman&#x27;s &quot;Red Hook Road&quot;, published in 2010, is about two bereaved families in a small village in Maine and the effect of a family tragedy and class differences on marriage, styles of motherhood (including the domineering), and family life. It is also about boxing and boat building.

===Short stories===
Waldman has contributed short stories to the anthologies &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s Stories of Love and Neuroses &quot; (2003) and &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories &quot; (2004), the latter of which was edited by Michael Chabon.
The short story &quot;Minnow,&quot; which appeared in &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories&quot;, is about a woman who is haunted by her dead baby. Again, she regards this as related to the loss of her own child. A horror film is being developed, based on the short story.

===Nonfiction===
Waldman has written many personal essays for online and print publications aspects of motherhood, such as how women criticize each other&#x27;s mothering (that is, the &quot;mommy wars&quot;), combining paid work with motherhood, and how the upbringing of those raised in a postfeminist era clashed with the reality of having to make professional sacrifices. Her essays have also explored the sexuality of mothers and of young people, homework, extended family life, body image, aging, literary hoaxes, and Jewish life. Although most of her nonfiction is personal, she has also written on aspects of the criminal justice system.

In 2016, Waldman and her husband Michael Chabon, in collaboration with the &quot;Breaking the Silence&quot; organization, initiated the production of an anthology that includes articles written by writers from around the world about the Israeli occupation, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Six-Day War. As part of the project, about 50 writers visited Israel, including Dave Eggers, Colm Tóibín and Mario Vargas Llosa. The book was published under the title &quot;Kingdom of Olives and Ash: Writers Confront the Occupation&quot;, in June 2017.

===&quot;Motherlove&quot;===
Her 2005 essay &quot;Motherlove&quot; was first published in the anthology &quot;Because I Said So: 33 Mothers Write About Children, Sex, Men, Aging, Faith, Race and Themselves&quot;, where she thought it would have only a small readership. However, it was reprinted in the Modern Love section of the &quot;New York Times&quot; in March 2005 under the headline &quot;Truly, Madly, Guiltily.&quot; It can be read online here. Waldman&#x27;s essay led to extensive and vitriolic debate, on television shows like &quot;The View&quot;, on internet blogs, in coffee shops, and elsewhere. Some people even threatened to report Waldman to the Department of Social Services in relation to the perceived mistreatment of her family. Oprah Winfrey, who said she was &quot;very brave&quot; for speaking out, invited Waldman onto her television show to discuss her views on love, marriage, and motherhood.

===&quot;Bad Mother&quot; ===
After Waldman complained about the response to her essay, a friend suggested she write a book about it. In 2009, Waldman published a collection of her personal essays, &quot;Bad Mother: A Chronicle of Maternal Crimes, Minor Calamities, and Occasional Moments of Grace&quot;. The book argues that no woman can be a perfect mother, that, in fact, competitive, neurotic parenting and having unrealistic expectations may be damaging to children. Waldman contends that society (particularly women, in what she calls the &quot;Bad Mother police&quot;) are too hard on other women&#x27;s parenting skills. The book includes chapters on women&#x27;s criticism of the mothering by other women, feminism, motherhood, and associated anxieties, including anxieties about breastfeeding, marriage, sexuality of mothers and teenagers, homework, mental illness, the loss of her unborn child, and her relationship with her mother-in-law. The book was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, and generally it received favorable reviews.

===&quot;A Really Good Day&quot;===
&quot;A Really Good Day&quot; was published in January 2017 and documents Waldman&#x27;s taking microdoses of LSD to help cope with her debilitating mood and anxiety disorders. She learned about this practice from a 2011 book by psychedelic researcher James Fadiman. &quot;A Really Good Day&quot; was called &quot;an engaging and deeply researched primer on a taboo subject and a strong case for more research on it&quot; by Nora Krug for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;. Jennifer Senior of the &quot;New York Times&quot; noted that Waldman &quot;is wielding her powers of provocation to goad us into an uncomfortable but necessary conversation. Quibble with her style, her methods, her desire to attract attention. In normalizing the conversation about LSD, she may one day help others feel normal.&quot;

===Blogs===
For a short time in 2004 and 2005, Waldman wrote a blog under the title &quot;Bad Mother.&quot; Her topics included sexuality, gay rights, motherhood, and her bipolar disorder. She said &quot;A blog like this is narcissism in its most obscene flowering. But it&#x27;s necessary. As a parent your days are consumed by other people&#x27;s needs. This is payback for driving back and forth to gymnastics all week long.&quot; On her reaction to the criticism that her blogging engendered, she has said &quot;It&#x27;s ridiculous to be so willing to expose myself and at the same time be so hypersensitive. Those are two contradictory impulses no one person should have.&quot; After an incident where she hinted at suicidal thoughts, she decided to discontinue the blog. Although she found it a therapeutic way to channel frustrations – likening the experience to &quot;slashing my wrists and haemorrhaging all over the computer screen&quot; – she found it was having a deleterious effect on her writing. Waldman blogged on the 2008 Democratic National Convention and had a blog on her own website from 2008 to 2009 on a variety of subjects.

== Television ==
Between 2015 and 2019, Waldman worked on the development of the acclaimed Netflix television show &quot;Unbelievable&quot;. She created it with her spouse Michael Chabon and veteran writer Susannah Grant. She had the original idea for the show after reading the Pulitzer-winning article it is based on: &quot;An Unbelievable Story of Rape&quot;.

She co-wrote with Chabon an episode of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, and is credited as a co-executive producer on five episodes. Her husband was the showrunner on the first season.

==Activism==
During the 2008 Presidential primaries and general election campaign, Waldman campaigned and raised funds in support of Barack Obama, acting as a full-time volunteer, speaking at fundraisers; she was appointed as a delegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention. 

On 26 April 2024, Waldman was arrested by Israeli police (along with six others, including three rabbis) as she tried to take food to Palestinians inside Gaza. Her husband Michael Chabon said at the time, “She was there in the company of a group of American rabbis, #rabbis4ceasefire, to show the world, the people of Gaza, and their fellow Jews in Israel, and around the world what Judaism teaches: justice, lovingkindness, peace, mercy, liberation.”

<text>Sidney Morgenbesser (September 22, 1921 – August 1, 2004) was an American philosopher and professor at Columbia University. He wrote little but is remembered by many for his philosophical witticisms.

==Life and career==
Sidney Morgenbesser was born on September 22, 1921, in New York City and raised in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side.

Morgenbesser undertook philosophical studies at the City College of New York (B.S.S., 1942) and rabbinic studies at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (B.J.P., 1941). Following World War II, he pursued graduate study in philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania. There he obtained his M.A. in 1950 and, with a thesis titled &quot;Theories And Schemata In The Social Sciences,&quot; his Ph.D. in 1956. It was also at Pennsylvania that, Morgenbesser reports, he held his first teaching job in philosophy and met Hilary Putnam as a student.

Morgenbesser taught at Swarthmore College and then The New School for Social Research. He then took a position at Columbia University in 1954. He was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1963, and by 1966 he was made a full professor at Columbia. He was visiting professor at the Rockefeller University in 1967—1968 and in 1975 was named the John Dewey Professor of Philosophy at Columbia. This position he held until retirement in 1991.

Morgenbesser&#x27;s areas of expertise included the philosophy of social science, political philosophy, epistemology, and the history of American Pragmatism. He founded the Society for Philosophy and Public Affairs along with G.A. Cohen, Thomas Nagel and others.

Morgenbesser appeared on in an interview by Bryan Magee on the topic of American Pragmatism in 1987.

He died on 1 August 2004 at St. Luke&#x27;s-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan at the age of 82, from complications due to ALS.

==Influence==

Morgenbesser was known particularly for his sharp witticisms and humor which often penetrated to the heart of the philosophical issue at hand, on which account &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; dubbed him the &quot;Sidewalk Socrates.&quot; According to one anecdote, when J. L. Austin claimed that, although a double negative often implies a positive meaning (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;he is not unlike his sister&quot;), there is no language in which a double positive implies a negative, Morgenbesser retorted: &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; In another commonly reported story, Morgenbesser was asked by a student whether he agreed with Chairman Mao&#x27;s view that a statement can be both true and false at the same time, to which Morgenbesser replied &quot;Well, I do and I don&#x27;t.&quot;

Another anecdote is given as follows by the &quot;Independent&quot;:
Morgenbesser published little and established no school, but was revered for his extraordinary intelligence and moral seriousness. He was a famously influential teacher; his former students included Jerry Fodor, Raymond Geuss, Alvin Goldman, Daniel M. Hausman, Robert Nozick, Hilary Putnam, Gideon Rosen, Mark Steiner, and Michael Stocker. In 1967, Morgenbesser signed a letter declaring his intention to in protest against the U.S. war in Vietnam, and urging other people to also take this stand.

<text>Gunde Anders Svan (born 12 January 1962) is a Swedish former cross-country skier and auto racing driver. During his cross-country skiing career he won a total of four gold, one silver and one bronze medals at the Winter Olympics. Svan won a total of seven golds, three silvers, and one bronze at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships. Svan also won the 15 km once (1983) and the 50 km twice (1986, 1990) at the Holmenkollen ski festival. In 1984, he earned the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal, and in 1985, he earned the Holmenkollen medal (shared with Anette Bøe and Per Bergerud). In both 1984 and 1985 did Svan win the Jerring Award. He is a board member of the International Ski Federation.

==Biography==
During his skiing career he became known for his dedication and attention to detail. For instance, he used a lighter alloy on the tips of his ski poles, saving . He won two golds (15 km and relay), one bronze (30 km) and one silver (50 km) at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. At the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, he won two golds for 50 km and relay. He also won the World championship gold six times and won the World cup five times.

As a competitor in rallycross he got one gold medal in the Swedish Championship and a bronze medal in the FIA European Championship for Rallycross Drivers (1995: Division 1 – Group N category; with a Toyota Celica GT-Four). One of the reasons for getting into another sport was that some people called him a natural skier while he himself maintained that it&#x27;s just a matter of will and dedication, according to his famous tagline &quot;nothing is impossible&quot;. He applied the same methods to his driving as his skiing and even built his own reaction-tester to practice for the rallycross eminently important starts. When his compatriot and teamboss, the late Christer Bohlin, was not able to fulfill his promise to upgrade his Toyota team for 1996 into the top ERC category (Division 2 by then), Svan quit and gave up rallycross.

After retiring from his athletic career he has worked as the host for some game shows such as the Swedish versions of &quot;American Gladiators&quot; and &quot;Fort Boyard&quot; along the swedish national lotery &quot;Bingolotto&quot;. He has played a seductive lady in the short movie &quot;En handelsresandes nöd&quot;, directed by rock group Svenne Rubins and starring Claes Månsson, Björn Skifs and Gert Klötzke. He has also appeared in numerous commercials including a famous commercial where he impersonated fellow skier Thomas Wassberg.

Svan resigned from his position as Chief of Cross-Country for Sweden on the week of 4 May 2009 after he was involved in its reorganization.

He participated in &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance 2018&quot; broadcast on TV4 where he finished third together with Jeanette Carlsson.

He retired to his forest farm, where he worked with his son, Ferry Svan, and now supports his children&#x27;s careers.

<doc id="880134" wikidata="Q2998274" url="?curid=880134" title="Cosmic Boy">
<text>Cosmic Boy (Rokk Krinn) is a superhero appearing in comics published by DC Comics. He is from the 31st century, and is a founding member and original leader of the Legion of Super-Heroes.

Cosmic Boy has appeared in various media outside comics, primarily those featuring the Legion of Super-Heroes. He is voiced by Wil Wheaton in &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot; (2006) and portrayed by Ryan Kennedy in &quot;Smallville&quot;.

==Publication history==

Cosmic Boy first appeared in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #247 (April 1958) and was created by Otto Binder and Al Plastino.

==Fictional character biography==
===Original===

Rokk Krinn, best known as Cosmic Boy, is a founding member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, along with Lightning Lad and Saturn Girl who possesses the innate ability to generate magnetic fields. Cosmic Boy&#x27;s brother Pol joins the Legion as Magnetic Kid before being killed during the &quot;Magic Wars&quot;.

In the pre-&quot;Zero Hour&quot; Legion, Cosmic Boy is romantically involved with Night Girl (Lydda Jath), whom he eventually marries. During the &quot;Five Year Gap&quot; following the Magic Wars, he loses his powers during a war between Braal and Imsk and leaves the Legion.

Rokk later returns to the Legion as Polestar, using special gauntlets to recreate his old abilities.

===Post-Zero Hour===

In the post-Zero Hour Legion, Rokk Krinn came from a poor family but became a superstar in the Braallian sport of Magnoball, earning the nickname &quot;Cosmic Boy&quot; after winning the Magnoball Cosmic Games. After cutting ties with his corrupt manager, Alex Cuspin, Rokk joins the Legion of Super-Heroes as Cosmic Boy.

Cosmic Boy later becomes the leader of the Legion before stepping down. He is among the Legionnaires sent to the 21st century by the Emerald Eye of Ekron.

===&quot;Threeboot&quot; continuity===
In &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; vol. 5, #1, Cosmic Boy is the leader of the Legion of Super-Heroes. After seemingly destroying the Dominators&#x27; homeworld (he actually sends it to the Phantom Zone), Cosmic Boy is voted out of office, being replaced by Supergirl. He then joins a superhero team from the 41st century, who come back in time to offer him membership.

===Post-Infinite Crisis===
Cosmic Boy is re-introduced following &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, which restores an analogue of the pre-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; Legion to continuity.

Comics writer Geoff Johns said about the characters:
===Post-&quot;Rebirth&quot;===
In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Cosmic Boy is among the Legionnaires who appear in the present after Doctor Manhattan undoes his alterations to the timeline, restoring the Legion and the Justice Society of America.

In &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, Cosmic Boy is among the Legion of Super-Heroes members who arrive in the present and confront the Justice Society over their decision to recruit Legionnaire, a young, heroic incarnation of Mordru.

==Limited series==

Cosmic Boy was featured in a four-part limited series, cover dated December 1986 through March 1987. A tie-in to the &quot;Legends&quot; limited series, it was written by Paul Levitz, with art by Keith Giffen, Ernie Colón, and Bob Smith.

In the series, Cosmic Boy and Night Girl have traveled from the 30th century to enjoy a vacation in the 20th century. They find themselves threatened by many citizens and residents of the United States, who have been manipulated by Glorious Godfrey as part of Darkseid&#x27;s scheme to discredit Earth&#x27;s superhero community. Soon after arriving, Cosmic Boy encounters Superman, who does not recognize him—even though Superboy was a member of the Legion for years. He and Night Girl review videotapes of recent history, including references to the bombing of Hiroshima, the explosion of the American space shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;, and the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, but no mention of Superman&#x27;s early career as Superboy. Cosmic Boy, a 20th-century Earth history buff, insists that none of these events are correct. As theirs is one of the first journeys through time since the Crisis, the couple fears that something is terribly wrong with history. The future could be in serious danger, since many of the worlds in the United Planets were colonized by settlers from Earth. A space shuttle mission carrying a satellite crucial to Earth&#x27;s future development of space travel goes awry, with the shuttle exploding. Cosmic Boy magnetically catches the payload and sends the debris harmlessly toward the ocean, but American soldiers assume that he is a foreign spy. They attack him, implementing Ronald Reagan&#x27;s directive outlawing all superhero activity.

Seeking to protect the satellite, Cosmic Boy and Night Girl travel to NASA facilities in Houston where they meet Jason, one of the astronauts who designed the shuttle. They help to quell a riot that breaks out when demonstrators break down the gates at NASA, and Cosmic Boy becomes convinced that some unseen enemy is deliberately trying to prevent the mission. As they depart, the couple notes that both of their families are from worlds settled during the Great Emigration from Earth. They are unaware that the last name of Jason — the astronaut they just met — is Krinnski, which implies that he may be a distant ancestor of Cosmic Boy, whose real name is Rokk Krinn.

Cosmic Boy and Night Girl return to the 30th century, where time travel experts Brainiac 5 and Circadia Senius may be able to determine the problem. Upon entering the timestream, their Time Bubble encounters a storm and shakes violently. They are forced to return to the 20th century. They turn to Jason Krinnski for assistance, who does his best to help them repair the Time Bubble. However, their second attempt to leave fails, as if there was a barrier blocking them. Realizing that they need a massive power source to propel the Bubble to the 30th century, Cosmic Boy harnesses energy from Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. They breach the barrier, but are propelled to the end of time, where they confront the Time Trapper.

The Trapper toys with the couple, giving them an hour to return to the 30th century. They eventually make their way through the Trapper&#x27;s Citadel to their Time Bubble, just as the last grains in the hourglass are about to fall. Cosmic Boy uses his power to warp the hourglass, closing it so that the last grain will never fall. Amused, the Trapper allows them to leave. He directs the Time Bubble to the 30th century, placing it right in front of Legion Headquarters. He warns the couple that this will be their final journey through time, and that &quot;the next occasion when a Legionnaire dares break the time barrier will be the last&quot;. As the two of them race to warn the Legion about what has occurred, the Trapper realizes that the Legionnaires will be returning for him. He finds this satisfying, as he looks at statues of Superboy and Krypto.

The events of this series are continued in the story arc &quot;The Greatest Hero of Them All&quot;, published in &quot;Superman&quot; vol. 2, #8; &quot;Action Comics&quot; #591; and &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; vol. 3, #37-38 (August–September 1987).

==Powers and abilities==
Cosmic Boy&#x27;s superpower is super-magnetism. He can manipulate, repel or attract metal objects of varying sizes. Naturally, the more metal is in an object the easier it is for him to affect magnetically. Cosmic Boy has been known to pull large iron meteors and satellites down from space with minimal effort. He can use his magnetic power on rocks that contain iron ore to pull or use them as projectiles. He can also magnetize metal objects so that they become magnets themselves and make them stick to other metal objects. His power cannot affect non-metals, such as organic substances like wood or flesh. His control is such that he can manipulate electronic records or the iron in blood. He has been known to use a uniform with ferrous fibres so he can fly with his own powers, but usually relies on a Legion flight ring.

As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Cosmic Boy is provided a Legion Flight Ring. It allows him to fly and protects him from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments.

<doc id="880135" wikidata="Q2146780" url="?curid=880135" title="Revenue Act of 1861">
<text>The Revenue Act of 1861, formally cited as &quot;Act of August 5, 1861, Chap. XLV, 12 Stat. 292&quot;, included the first U.S. Federal income tax statute (see Sec. 49). The Act, motivated by the need to fund the Civil War, imposed an income tax to be &quot;levied, collected, and paid, upon the annual income of every person residing in the United States, whether such income is derived from any kind of property, or from any profession, trade, employment, or vocation carried on in the United States or elsewhere, or from any other source whatever&quot;.
The tax imposed was a flat tax, with a rate of 3% on incomes above $800 . The Revenue Act of 1861 was signed into law by Abraham Lincoln.

The income tax provision (Sections 49, 50 and 51) was repealed by the Revenue Act of 1862. (See Sec.89, which replaced the flat rate with a progressive scale of 3% on annual incomes beyond $600 (which was 3.4 times the 1862 nominal gross domestic product per capita of $177.69; the corresponding income in 2021 is $234K) and 5% on incomes above $10,000 (which is 56 times the 1862 nominal gross domestic product per capita; corresponding to $3.9M of income in 2021) or those living outside the U.S., and perhaps more significantly it was explicitly temporary, specifying termination of income tax in &quot;the year eighteen hundred and sixty-six&quot;).

==History==
Prior to the Civil War, the United States faced a financial depression subsequent to the Panic of 1857, an event facilitated by over-expansion of the domestic economy and a European financial meltdown. In the three years preceding the Civil War, the Federal Government incurred a budget deficit exceeding $40 million. Coupled with the threat of secession, the Federal deficit placed the US government under considerable financial strain. In 1860, the US Treasury paid between 8 and 12 percent interest on government bonds in order to raise additional funds and meet public expenditures. In December 1861, the US Treasury attempted to sell five million dollars of interest-bearing notes at 12 percent but found itself able to dispose of only four million dollars worth. The Treasury&#x27;s struggles illustrate the precarious nature of the US government&#x27;s financial state. As the nation edged closer to war, the need to mobilize a volunteer force placed an additional financial burden upon the Federal government. While treasury notes with enticing interest rates allowed the US government to raise revenue quickly, they also established a need for additional revenue streams with which to pay off interest.

In March 1861, President Lincoln began to explore the federal government&#x27;s ability to wage war against the South from a logistical standpoint. He sent letters to cabinet members including Edward Bates, Salmon Chase, and Gideon Welles inquiring whether the president had constitutional authority to collect duties ranging from an import tariff to a property tax. Documents housed at the Library of Congress indicate that Lincoln was concerned with the Federal government&#x27;s ability to collect tariffs from ports along the Southeastern seaboard, noting the imminent threat of secession.

On July 4, 1861, President Lincoln opened a special session of Congress with the explicit purpose of addressing the Civil War from a legislative standpoint. One of the primary concerns facing Congress was the question of funding: given a surfeit of volunteers, the Union Army military incurred extraordinary expenditures as they trained and armed a martial force. President Lincoln noted that, &quot;One of the greatest perplexities of the government, is to avoid receiving troops faster than it can provide for them. In a word, the people will save their government, if the government itself, will do its part&quot; To raise revenue by approximately $50 million, legislators adopted a three-pronged approach consisting of an increase in certain import tariffs, a newly instituted property tax, and the first personal income tax.

Under the leadership of Senator William Pitt Fessenden of Maine, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, Congress drafted the Revenue Act of 1861 in a relatively short time-frame. While the legislation effectively introduced import tariffs, property taxes, and a flat rate income tax of 3% on those making above $800, it lacked a comprehensive enforcement mechanism. In Congress, the bill provoked considerable debate: Thaddeus Stevens, chairman of the House Committee of Ways and Means, declared that, &quot;This bill is a most unpleasant one. But we perceive no way in which we can avoid it and sustain the government. The rebels, who are now destroying or attempting to destroy this Government, have thrust upon the country many disagreeable things.&quot; His sentiment reflected the view that the income and property taxes levied by the bill were necessary evils. The bill was eventually passed by Congress and signed into law by President Lincoln. Despite its sweeping reform, the ineffective enforcement mechanism coupled with a 3% flat tax rate failed to yield the desired revenue.

==Tax structure==
*Import Tariff: The Revenue Act of 1861 levied various tariffs on imports including sugar, tea, nuts, brimstone, coffee, liquor, and various fruits and herbs. The majority of imports were taxed on a per unit basis while certain imports, often those with more volatile pricing such as hides, citrus fruit, silk, and gunpowder were taxed ad valorem, with rates ranging from 10% on hides and rubber to 50% on wines. The act imposed an additional tax of 10% ad valorem on articles imported in foreign vessels from beyond the Cape of Good Hope. The provisions included in the act expanded upon the protectionist precedent set by the Morrill Tariff of 1861.
*Property Tax: The Revenue Act of 1861 instituted a tax on real estate, levied in proportion to each state&#x27;s population. While the act&#x27;s enforcement mechanism was limited, it formally established a system of tax districts, assessors, and collectors, laying the groundwork for the Internal Revenue Service&#x27;s formation on July 1, 1862. The property tax drew criticism from representatives of rural states: by taxing real estate and excluding other forms of personal property, the tax, they argued placed an undue burden upon large, sparsely populated states and territories in the West and Southwest. Though densely populated states such as New York were assessed at a higher rate due to a large population, a greater proportion of wealth in such states was invested in personal property other than real estate.
*Income Tax: The Revenue Act of 1861 levied a 3% flat rate income tax on those with an annual income at or exceeding $800 (which was 5.6 times the 1861 nominal gross domestic product per capita of $144.31; the corresponding income in 2021 is $384K). In 1861, only 3% of the population had an annual income of at least $800; as such, the tax enjoyed relatively widespread support among legislators. The act granted President Lincoln the power to appoint one principal assessor and one principal collector per state/territory; these officials were charged with enforcing income tax provisions. However, another portion of the bill stipulated that each state may collect and pay its own portion of the direct tax levied upon each state in its own way. Lacking an effective enforcement mechanism, the income tax provision was repealed in 1862 and replaced with a more expansive bill in the Revenue Act of 1862. The subsequent revenue act called for the establishment of the Internal Revenue Bureau (later renamed Internal Revenue Service) and a progressive tax scale.

<doc id="880145" wikidata="Q5454146" url="?curid=880145" title="First-class constraint">
<text>In physics, a first-class constraint is a dynamical quantity in a constrained Hamiltonian system whose Poisson bracket with all the other constraints vanishes on the constraint surface in phase space (the surface implicitly defined by the simultaneous vanishing of all the constraints). To calculate the first-class constraint, one assumes that there are no second-class constraints, or that they have been calculated previously, and their Dirac brackets generated.

First- and second-class constraints were introduced by as a way of quantizing mechanical systems such as gauge theories where the symplectic form is degenerate.

The terminology of first- and second-class constraints is confusingly similar to that of primary and secondary constraints, reflecting the manner in which these are generated. These divisions are independent: both first- and second-class constraints can be either primary or secondary, so this gives altogether four different classes of constraints.

==Poisson brackets==
Consider a Poisson manifold &quot;M&quot; with a smooth Hamiltonian over it (for field theories, &quot;M&quot; would be infinite-dimensional).

Suppose we have some constraints 
:formula_1
for &quot;n&quot; smooth functions
:formula_2

These will only be defined chartwise in general. Suppose that everywhere on the constrained set, the &quot;n&quot; derivatives of the &quot;n&quot; functions are all linearly independent and also that the Poisson brackets
:formula_3
and
:formula_4
all vanish on the constrained subspace.

This means we can write
:formula_5
for some smooth functions formula_6 — there is a theorem showing this; and
:formula_7
for some smooth functions formula_8.

This can be done globally, using a partition of unity. Then, we say we have an irreducible first-class constraint (&quot;irreducible&quot; here is in a different sense from that used in representation theory).

==Geometric theory==
For a more elegant way, suppose given a vector bundle over formula_9, with formula_10-dimensional fiber formula_11. Equip this vector bundle with a connection. Suppose too we have a smooth section of this bundle.

Then the covariant derivative of with respect to the connection is a smooth linear map formula_12 from the tangent bundle formula_13 to formula_11, which preserves the base point. Assume this linear map is right invertible (i.e. there exists a linear map formula_15 such that formula_16 is the identity map) for all the fibers at the zeros of . Then, according to the implicit function theorem, the subspace of zeros of is a submanifold.

The ordinary Poisson bracket is only defined over formula_17, the space of smooth functions over &quot;M&quot;. However, using the connection, we can extend it to the space of smooth sections of if we work with the algebra bundle with the graded algebra of &quot;V&quot;-tensors as fibers.

Assume also that under this Poisson bracket, formula_18 (note that it&#x27;s not true that formula_19 in general for this &quot;extended Poisson bracket&quot; anymore) and formula_20 on the submanifold of zeros of (If these brackets also happen to be zero everywhere, then we say the constraints close off shell). It turns out the right invertibility condition and the commutativity of flows conditions are &quot;independent&quot; of the choice of connection. So, we can drop the connection provided we are working solely with the restricted subspace.

==Intuitive meaning==
What does it all mean intuitively? It means the Hamiltonian and constraint flows all commute with each other on the constrained subspace; or alternatively, that if we start on a point on the constrained subspace, then the Hamiltonian and constraint flows all bring the point to another point on the constrained subspace.

Since we wish to restrict ourselves to the constrained subspace only, this suggests that the Hamiltonian, or any other physical observable, should only be defined on that subspace. Equivalently, we can look at the equivalence class of smooth functions over the symplectic manifold, which agree on the constrained subspace (the quotient algebra by the ideal generated by the &#x27;s, in other words).

The catch is, the Hamiltonian flows on the constrained subspace depend on the gradient of the Hamiltonian there, not its value. But there&#x27;s an easy way out of this.

Look at the orbits of the constrained subspace under the action of the symplectic flows generated by the &#x27;s. This gives a local foliation of the subspace because it satisfies integrability conditions (Frobenius theorem). It turns out if we start with two different points on a same orbit on the constrained subspace and evolve both of them under two different Hamiltonians, respectively, which agree on the constrained subspace, then the time evolution of both points under their respective Hamiltonian flows will always lie in the same orbit at equal times. It also turns out if we have two smooth functions &quot;A&quot;1 and &quot;B&quot;1, which are constant over orbits at least on the constrained subspace (i.e. physical observables) (i.e. {A1,f}={B1,f}=0 over the constrained subspace)and another two A2 and B2, which are also constant over orbits such that A1 and B1 agrees with A2 and B2 respectively over the restrained subspace, then their Poisson brackets {A1, B1} and {A2, B2} are also constant over orbits and agree over the constrained subspace.

In general, one cannot rule out &quot;ergodic&quot; flows (which basically means that an orbit is dense in some open set), or &quot;subergodic&quot; flows (which an orbit dense in some submanifold of dimension greater than the orbit&#x27;s dimension). We can&#x27;t have self-intersecting orbits.

For most &quot;practical&quot; applications of first-class constraints, we do not see such complications: the quotient space of the restricted subspace by the f-flows (in other words, the orbit space) is well behaved enough to act as a differentiable manifold, which can be turned into a symplectic manifold by projecting the symplectic form of M onto it (this can be shown to be well defined). In light of the observation about physical observables mentioned earlier, we can work with this more &quot;physical&quot; smaller symplectic manifold, but with 2n fewer dimensions.

In general, the quotient space is a bit difficult to work with when doing concrete calculations (not to mention nonlocal when working with diffeomorphism constraints), so what is usually done instead is something similar. Note that the restricted submanifold is a bundle (but not a fiber bundle in general) over the quotient manifold. So, instead of working with the quotient manifold, we can work with a section of the bundle instead. This is called gauge fixing.

The &quot;major&quot; problem is this bundle might not have a global section in general. This is where the &quot;problem&quot; of global anomalies comes in, for example. A global anomaly is different from the Gribov ambiguity, which is when a gauge fixing doesn&#x27;t work to fix a gauge uniquely, in a global anomaly, there is no consistent definition of the gauge field. A global anomaly is a barrier to defining a quantum gauge theory discovered by Witten in 1980.

What have been described are irreducible first-class constraints. Another complication is that Δf might not be right invertible on subspaces of the restricted submanifold of codimension 1 or greater (which violates the stronger assumption stated earlier in this article). This happens, for example in the cotetrad formulation of general relativity, at the subspace of configurations where the cotetrad field and the connection form happen to be zero over some open subset of space. Here, the constraints are the diffeomorphism constraints.

One way to get around this is this: For reducible constraints, we relax the condition on the right invertibility of Δ&quot;f&quot; into this one: Any smooth function that vanishes at the zeros of &quot;f&quot; is the fiberwise contraction of &quot;f&quot; with (a non-unique) smooth section of a formula_21-vector bundle where formula_21 is the dual vector space to the constraint vector space &quot;V&quot;. This is called the &quot;regularity condition&quot;.

==Constrained Hamiltonian dynamics from a Lagrangian gauge theory==
First of all, we will assume the action is the integral of a local Lagrangian that only depends up to the first derivative of the fields. The analysis of more general cases, while possible is more complicated. When going over to the Hamiltonian formalism, we find there are constraints. Recall that in the action formalism, there are on shell and off shell configurations. The constraints that hold off shell are called primary constraints while those that only hold on shell are called secondary constraints.

==Examples==
Consider the dynamics of a single point particle of mass with no internal degrees of freedom moving in a pseudo-Riemannian spacetime manifold with metric g. Assume also that the parameter describing the trajectory of the particle is arbitrary (i.e. we insist upon reparametrization invariance). Then, its symplectic space is the cotangent bundle &quot;T*S&quot; with the canonical symplectic form . 

If we coordinatize &quot;T&quot; * &quot;S&quot; by its position in the base manifold and its position within the cotangent space p, then we have a constraint
:&quot;f&quot; = &quot;m&quot;2 −g(&quot;x&quot;)−1(p,p) = 0.

The Hamiltonian is, surprisingly enough, = 0. In light of the observation that the Hamiltonian is only defined up to the equivalence class of smooth functions agreeing on the constrained subspace, we can use a new Hamiltonian &#x27;= instead. Then, we have the interesting case where the Hamiltonian is the same as a constraint! See Hamiltonian constraint for more details.

Consider now the case of a Yang–Mills theory for a real simple Lie algebra (with a negative definite Killing form ) minimally coupled to a real scalar field , which transforms as an orthogonal representation with the underlying vector space under in ( − 1) + 1 Minkowski spacetime. For in , we write
as
for simplicity. Let A be the -valued connection form of the theory. Note that the A here differs from the A used by physicists by a factor of and . This agrees with the mathematician&#x27;s convention. 

The action is given by
:formula_23
where g is the Minkowski metric, F is the curvature form 
:formula_24
(no s or s!) where the second term is a formal shorthand for pretending the Lie bracket is a commutator, is the covariant derivative
:Dσ = dσ − A[σ]
and is the orthogonal form for .
What is the Hamiltonian version of this model? Well, first, we have to split A noncovariantly into a time component and a spatial part . Then, the resulting symplectic space has the conjugate variables , (taking values in the underlying vector space of formula_25, the dual rep of ), , &quot;A&quot;, &quot;φ&quot; and &quot;πφ&quot;. For each spatial point, we have the constraints, &quot;πφ&quot;=0 and the Gaussian constraint
:formula_26
where since is an intertwiner
:formula_27,
 &#x27; is the dualized intertwiner
:formula_28
( is self-dual via ). The Hamiltonian,
:formula_29

The last two terms are a linear combination of the Gaussian constraints and we have a whole family of (gauge equivalent)Hamiltonians parametrized by . In fact, since the last three terms vanish for the constrained states, we may drop them.

==Second-class constraints==

In a constrained Hamiltonian system, a dynamical quantity is second-class if its Poisson bracket with at least one constraint is nonvanishing. A constraint that has a nonzero Poisson bracket with at least one other constraint, then, is a second-class constraint.

See Dirac brackets for diverse illustrations.

===An example: a particle confined to a sphere===

Before going on to the general theory, consider a specific example step by step to motivate the general analysis.

Start with the action describing a Newtonian particle of mass constrained to a spherical surface of radius within a uniform gravitational field . When one works in Lagrangian mechanics, there are several ways to implement a constraint: one can switch to generalized coordinates that manifestly solve the constraint, or one can use a Lagrange multiplier while retaining the redundant coordinates so constrained.

In this case, the particle is constrained to a sphere, therefore the natural solution would be to use angular coordinates to describe the position of the particle instead of Cartesian and solve (automatically eliminate) the constraint in that way (the first choice). For pedagogical reasons, instead, consider the problem in (redundant) Cartesian coordinates, with a Lagrange multiplier term enforcing the constraint.

The action is given by 
:formula_30
where the last term is the Lagrange multiplier term enforcing the constraint.

Of course, as indicated, we could have just used different, non-redundant, spherical coordinates and written it as
:formula_31
instead, without extra constraints; but we are considering the former coordinatization to illustrate constraints.

The conjugate momenta are given by
:formula_32, formula_33, formula_34, formula_35.
Note that we can&#x27;t determine from the momenta.

The Hamiltonian is given by 
:formula_36.

We cannot eliminate at this stage yet. We are here treating as a shorthand for a function of the symplectic space which we have yet to determine and &quot;not&quot; as an independent variable. For notational consistency, define from now on. The above Hamiltonian with the term is the &quot;naive Hamiltonian&quot;. Note that since, on-shell, the constraint must be satisfied, one cannot distinguish, on-shell, between the naive Hamiltonian and the above Hamiltonian with the undetermined coefficient, .

We have the primary constraint 

We require, on the grounds of consistency, that the Poisson bracket of all the constraints with the Hamiltonian vanish at the constrained subspace. In other words, the constraints must not evolve in time if they are going to be identically zero along the equations of motion.

From this consistency condition, we immediately get the secondary constraint

formula_37

This constraint should be added into the Hamiltonian with an undetermined (not necessarily constant) coefficient 2, enlarging the Hamiltonian to

:formula_38

Similarly, from this secondary constraint, we find the tertiary constraint

formula_39

Again, one should add this constraint into the Hamiltonian, since, on-shell, no one can tell the difference. Therefore, so far, the Hamiltonian looks like
:formula_40
where 1, 2, and 3 are still completely undetermined.

Note that, frequently, all constraints that are found from consistency conditions are referred to as &quot;secondary constraints&quot; and secondary, tertiary, quaternary, etc., constraints are not distinguished.

We keep turning the crank, demanding this new constraint have vanishing Poisson bracket

:formula_41

We might despair and think that there is no end to this, but because one of the new Lagrange multipliers has shown up, this is not a new constraint, but a condition that fixes the Lagrange multiplier: 

:formula_42

Plugging this into our Hamiltonian gives us (after a little algebra)

formula_43

Now that there are new terms in the Hamiltonian, one should go back and check the consistency conditions for the primary and secondary constraints. The secondary constraint&#x27;s consistency condition gives

:formula_44
Again, this is &quot;not&quot; a new constraint; it only determines that
:formula_45
At this point there are &quot;no more constraints or consistency conditions to check&quot;!

Putting it all together,
:formula_46.
When finding the equations of motion, one should use the above Hamiltonian, and as long as one is careful to never use constraints before taking derivatives in the Poisson bracket then one gets the correct equations of motion. That is, the equations of motion are given by
:formula_47

Before analyzing the Hamiltonian, consider the three constraints,
:formula_48
Note the nontrivial Poisson bracket structure of the constraints. In particular,
:formula_49
The above Poisson bracket does not just fail to vanish off-shell, which might be anticipated, but &quot;even on-shell it is nonzero&quot;. Therefore, and are second-class constraints, while is a first-class constraint. Note that these constraints satisfy the regularity condition.

Here, we have a symplectic space where the Poisson bracket does not have &quot;nice properties&quot; on the constrained subspace. However, Dirac noticed that we can turn the underlying differential manifold of the symplectic space into a Poisson manifold using his eponymous modified bracket, called the Dirac bracket, such that this &quot;Dirac bracket of any (smooth) function with any of the second-class constraints always vanishes&quot;. 

Effectively, these brackets (illustrated for this spherical surface in the Dirac bracket article) project the system back onto the constraints surface.
If one then wished to canonically quantize this system, then one need promote the canonical Dirac brackets, &quot;not&quot; the canonical Poisson brackets to commutation relations.

Examination of the above Hamiltonian shows a number of interesting things happening. One thing to note is that, on-shell when the constraints are satisfied, the extended Hamiltonian is identical to the naive Hamiltonian, as required. Also, note that dropped out of the extended Hamiltonian. Since is a first-class primary constraint, it should be interpreted as a generator of a gauge transformation. The gauge freedom is the freedom to choose , which has ceased to have any effect on the particle&#x27;s dynamics. Therefore, that dropped out of the Hamiltonian, that 1 is undetermined, and that = &quot;pλ&quot; is first-class, are all closely interrelated.

Note that it would be more natural not to start with a Lagrangian with a Lagrange multiplier, but instead take as a primary constraint and proceed through the formalism: The result would the elimination of the extraneous dynamical quantity. However, the example is more edifying in its current form.

===Example: Proca action===
Another example we will use is the Proca action. The fields are formula_50 and the action is
:formula_51
where
:formula_52

<text>David Lewis Payne (December 30, 1836 – November 28, 1884) was an American soldier and pioneer. Payne is considered by some to be the &quot;Father of Oklahoma&quot; for his work in opening the state to settlement.

He organized, trained, and led the &quot;Boomer Army&quot; on its forays into the Unassigned Lands. Payne&#x27;s excursions into the Unassigned Lands, trips led by others, and lobbying of Congress by railroad interests eventually convinced the government to open the Unassigned Lands for settlement in 1889, about four years after Payne&#x27;s death. The formation of Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory followed, and Oklahoma became a state in 1907.

==Early life and education==
Payne was born in 1836 in Grant County, Indiana, on a farm near Fairmount. He grew up working on his father&#x27;s farm. During winters he attended the local rural school.

In the spring of 1858, Payne and his brother left home intending to join in the Utah War. Their interest evidently waned by the time they crossed the Missouri River, as they stopped in Doniphan County, Kansas. There, in Burr Oak Township, Payne acquired some land and built a sawmill. It soon failed and Payne fell to hunting to support himself. Eventually private parties and then the Federal government hired him to scout for their various expeditions. These activities led to his exploration of what would later become Oklahoma.

==Career==

At the opening of the Civil War, Payne enlisted in the 4th Kansas Volunteer Infantry. In April 1862, his regiment and the 3rd Kansas Infantry and 5th Kansas Infantry were consolidated to form the 10th Kansas Infantry. He served from August 1861 to August 1864 as a private in Company F. During his service the unit saw action in Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, and the Cherokee Nation, including the Battle of Prairie Grove in 1862.

At the end of his three-year service Payne returned to Doniphan County and was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives, serving in the 1864, 1865, and 1872 sessions.

In March 1865, Payne enlisted for one year in the 15th Kansas Cavalry as a private assigned to Company H. The unit had been activated in response to a January state legislative resolution which called for the organization of a regiment of veteran volunteer cavalry to protect western Kansas from Indian activity.

In July 1867, Kansas Governor Samuel Johnson Crawford issued a proclamation calling for volunteers to protect Kansans from Indian attacks in the west. The 18th Kansas Cavalry was brought up for four months as a result. Payne enlisted and was mustered in as the captain of Company D. This battalion replaced the Seventh Cavalry which had been transferred to the Platte River for the summer. In October 1868, Payne mustered in as a lieutenant in Company H of the 19th Kansas Cavalry, which served in a winter campaign against Indians on the western Great Plains. During this campaign, Payne served as a scout for General Philip Sheridan.

In 1870 Payne moved to Sedgwick County, near Wichita, and the following year he was again elected to the Kansas House of Representatives. This led to appointments as Postmaster at Fort Leavenworth in 1867 and as Sergeant-at-arms for two terms of the Kansas Senate. In 1875 and 1879, Payne served as assistant to the Doorkeeper of the United States House of Representatives.

During the intervals between political engagements and military service, Payne supported himself by hunting, scouting, and guiding wagon trains.

===Boomer===
In 1866, shortly after the Civil War, the Federal government forced many tribes in the Indian Territory into making concessions. The government accused the various tribes of abrogating the standing treaties by joining the Confederacy. As a result, some two million acres (8,000 km2) of land in the center of Indian Territory were ceded to the United States and thought by many to be public domain land.

Elias Boudinot, a Cherokee citizen working as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C., published an article about the public land issue in the February 17, 1879, edition of the &quot;Chicago Times&quot;. Dr. Morrison Munford of the &quot;Kansas City Times&quot; began referring to this tract as the &quot;Unassigned Lands&quot; or &quot;Oklahoma&quot; and to the people agitating for its settlement as &quot;Boomers&quot;. Munford is the first person to use the terms &quot;boom&quot; and &quot;boomer&quot; to describe the movement of white settlers into these lands. To prevent settlement of the land, President Rutherford B. Hayes issued a proclamation in April 1879 forbidding unlawful entry into Indian Territory.

Inspired by Boudinot, Payne began his efforts to enter and settle the public domain lands as allowed by existing law. He returned from his job in Washington and returned to Wichita in 1879. On his first attempt to enter Indian Territory, in April 1880, Payne and his party laid out a town they named &quot;Ewing&quot; on the present-day site of Oklahoma City. The Fourth Cavalry arrested them, took them to Fort Reno, then escorted them back to Kansas. Payne was furious, as public law (specifically the Posse Comitatus Act) prohibited the military from interfering in civil matters. Payne and his party were freed, which effectively denied them access to federal and state courts.

Anxious to prove his case in court, Payne and a larger group returned to Ewing in July 1879. The Army again arrested the party, escorted them back to Kansas, and freed them. This time, however, Payne was charged under the Indian Intercourse Act and brought to trial in Fort Smith, Arkansas, in March 1881. Judge Isaac C. Parker ruled against Payne and fined him the maximum amount of US$1,000, but since Payne had no money and no property, the fine could not be collected. The ruling settled nothing about the public lands, however, and Payne continued his activities unabated. He organized and led several more expeditions into the territory, even forming a newspaper called the &quot;Oklahoma War Chief&quot;, the first in the Cherokee Outlet, which he published in several sites along the Kansas-Indian Territory border.

During one of his last ventures, Payne insisted on a public trial, so he and his group were hauled several hundred miles to Fort Smith. The trip began at Fort Reno and proceeded to Fort Sill, Henrietta, Texas, Texarkana, Arkansas, Little Rock, Arkansas, and then finally to Fort Smith. During another trip in July 1884, the army seized his &quot;Oklahoma War Chief&quot; press, burned his buildings, and took Payne and his group through the Cherokee Nation after their arrest. The party was paraded through the streets of Tahlequah, past the Indian people who hated him for his attempts to seize part of their lands.

Public sentiment grew so great over his mistreatment at the hands of the military that the government finally granted his trial. Payne was turned over to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas at Topeka. In the fall term, Judge Cassius G. Foster quashed the indictments and ruled that settling on the Unassigned Lands was not a criminal offense. Boomers celebrated, but the government refused to accept the decision.

Between expeditions, Payne often spoke to crowds of admirers and recruited more Boomers. The day after such an address in Wellington, Kansas, on November 27, 1884, Payne collapsed and died of heart failure. His funeral filled the Methodist Episcopal Church in Wellington and thousands filed past his grave.

Payne&#x27;s family moved his remains to Oklahoma in 1995. On April 22, 1996, a monument was dedicated at his final resting place in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Payne County, of which Stillwater is the county seat, is named in his honor.

William Couch succeeded Payne as leader of the Boomer movement.

<text>Interstate 195 (I-195) is a auxiliary Interstate Highway connecting I-95, its parent route, in the west with Miami Beach in the east. It crosses Biscayne Bay by traveling over the Julia Tuttle Causeway. The causeway is named after Miami founder Julia Tuttle.

It is part of the longer State Road 112 (SR 112), which continues to the west as the Airport Expressway and to the east as Arthur Godfrey Road (41st Street).

As part of a pilot program, the Florida Department of Transportation painted the shoulders as bike lanes east of US Highway 1 (US 1). Pedestrians are still prohibited.

==Route description==
I-195 begins at the eastern end of the I-95 and SR 112 interchange, also known as the 36th Street Interchange, heading east with interchanges with Miami Avenue and US 1 before heading onto the Julia Tuttle Causeway, where the Interstate crosses Biscayne Bay. At the eastern end of the causeway in Miami Beach, it has an interchange with SR 907 before terminating at the intersection of SR 907A and Arthur Godfrey Road, about west of SR A1A.

==History==
On December 23, 1961, three signed roads along the route of SR 112 were opened: the 36th Street Tollway, now the Airport Expressway, I-195, and the I-195 Spur along with a stretch of I-95 in Miami. The I-195 Spur was the surface portion of the west–east state road along Arthur Godfrey Road in Miami Beach, connecting I-195 and SR A1A east of the causeway. The I-195 Spur signs disappeared from the road shortly after the designation was decommissioned by the newly formed U.S. Department of Transportation in the late 1960s.

==In popular culture==
Famously, in early 1975, the rhythm of their car on this road was the inspiration for the Bee Gees&#x27;s song &quot;Jive Talkin&#x27;&quot;.

<text>Eumir Deodato de Almeida (; born 22 June 1943) is a Brazilian pianist, composer, arranger and record producer, primarily in jazz but who has been known for his eclectic melding of genres, such as pop, rock, disco, rhythm and blues, classical, Latin and bossa nova.

Deodato has arranged and produced more than 500 records for acts such as Frank Sinatra, Roberta Flack, Björk and Christophe, as well as produced Kool &amp; the Gang&#x27;s hits &quot;Celebration&quot;, &quot;Ladies&#x27; Night&quot; and &quot;Too Hot&quot;.

Deodato was nominated for three Grammy Awards and won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance in 1974 for &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra (2001).&quot; The song peaked at number 2 on the weekly Billboard Hot 100 in March 1973. It reached number 3 in Canada and number 7 on the British charts.

== Biography ==
Deodato, born in Rio De Janeiro on June 22, 1943, began his musical life on accordion when he was 12 years old, and then piano two years later. He studied orchestration, conducting and arranging. He played bossa nova in bands with Paulo Silvino and Orlandivo, then formed his own band, which featured João Palma, Sergio Barroso, Ugo Marotta, Henri Ackselrud and guitarist Celso Brando, who was later replaced by Roberto Menescal in 1962. Eumir’s paternal grandfather was a marble craftsman from Custonaci, Sicily.

== Career ==
=== Recording career ===
Deodato often plays the Fender Rhodes electric piano. He became successful as a keyboard player in the 1970s. Since then, he has produced and arranged music on more than 500 albums for artists such as Kool &amp; the Gang, Con Funk Shun, Björk, Christophe, Ithamara Koorax and k.d. lang. Guitarist John Tropea and flautist Hubert Laws appeared on his early albums.

&quot;Prelude&quot;, his first album in the U.S., was released in 1973. His track &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra (2001)&quot; scored a big hit on the Billboard pop chart. This album was crossover music style that attracted a large audience and was produced by Creed Taylor for his label CTI. The album sold 5 million copies worldwide and earned Deodato the 1974 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance for the track &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra (2001)&quot; as well as a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist.

His second album, &quot;Deodato 2&quot;, reached number 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart, and the single &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; reached No. 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1973. His interpretation of &quot;Pavane pour une infante défunte&quot; (&quot;Pavane for a Dead Princess&quot;) by Maurice Ravel was used in the 1970s by an Australian television station as background music.

In 1978, he had an orchestral hit with &quot;Whistle Bump&quot; from the LP titled &quot;Love Island&quot;. The track promoted the widespread use of whistles in nightclubs at the time. However, his popularity in the discos was solidified when he released the 1979 single &quot;Night Cruiser&quot; from the album of the same name, which earned him a third Grammy nomination for Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance. Deodato continued recording through the 1980s. In 1985, he had two hits, &quot;S.O.S., Fire in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Are You For Real&quot;, on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s top 20 Dance chart.

In 1998, Deodato invited his old friend and fellow Brazilian jazz impresario Arnaldo DeSouteiro to co-produce with him the first official CD reissues of all his albums from the 1960s, in a total of nine releases. Among them, &quot;Inútil Paisagem&quot; (reissued by JSR in co-production with Universal Music), &quot;Idéias&quot;, and all the albums from the Os Catedráticos series that were digitally remixed and remastered by audio engineer Rodrigo de Castro Lopes under the direct supervision of both Deodato and DeSouteiro. 

He recorded &quot;Live in Rio&quot; in 2007. In 2009, &quot;Prelude&quot; was reissued for the first time in Asia on SACD and SHM-CD formats under the supervision of Arnaldo DeSouteiro. In 2011, he released the album &quot;The Crossing&quot;, which he produced with Lino Nicolosi and Pino Nicolosi at Nicolosi Productions, with guest vocalist Al Jarreau. In 2010 he played the rhodes piano in the album &quot;Oasis&quot; produced and performed by Marita Pauli. In 2018 he arranged and conducted the strings orchestra in the album &quot;The First&quot; released by Riccardo Dalli Cardillo.

=== Arranging and producing ===
Since the 1960s, Deodato has been in demand as a producer and arranger. He has worked on more than 500 albums, and 15 have reached platinum status as defined by the RIAA.

In the early 1960s, he worked as a freelance arranger for Odeon Records. He wrote arrangements for Wilson Simonal, Marcos Valle, Leny Andrade, Pery Ribeiro, Tito Madi and for his own debut album, &quot;Inútil Paisagem&quot; (1964), which was dedicated to the work of Antônio Carlos Jobim and recorded in Rio when Deodato was 22. Jobim praised him in the album&#x27;s liner notes. Deodato played piano with guitarists Oscar Castro-Neves and Roberto Menescal, drummer Juquinha and an all-star cast including Copinha, J.T. Meirelles, Cipó, Paulo Moura. He has been credited for helping to start the career of Milton Nascimento; Deodato was part of a committee tasked with choosing songs for a festival and chose three by Nascimento.

He moved to New York City in 1967 to work with guitarist Luiz Bonfá, with whom he recorded seven albums and countless jingles. Bonfá also introduced him to vocalist Astrud Gilberto and record producer Creed Taylor, when they were reunited on the making of Astrud&#x27;s &quot;Beach Samba&quot; album for Verve Records. Later on, Creed Taylor hired him to write arrangements for musicians at CTI Records who included Wes Montgomery, Antônio Carlos Jobim, Milton Nascimento, Walter Wanderley, Stanley Turrentine, Paul Desmond and the CTI All Stars. 
Deodato also recorded with Frank Sinatra, (1969), João Donato (1970), Youg, Holt Unlimited (1973), Aretha Franklin (1973), and recorded three albums with Roberta Flack from 1971 to 1973. 

He had other collaborations, including producing four million-selling albums for Kool and the Gang from 1979 to 1982, the first solo album by Kevin Rowland of Dexys Midnight Runners in 1988, three albums four singer Ithamara Koorax, as well as records by Chuck Mangione, Larry Graham, Tania Maria, Eliane Elias, Pretty Poison, One Way, Con Funk Shun, Brenda K. Starr, Kleeer, and kd Lang.
Deodato also developed a close collaboration with Icelandic singer Bjork from 1996 to 1998, arranging her albums &quot;Post&quot;, &quot;Telegram&quot; and &quot;Homogenic&quot;. For Deodato&#x27;s &quot;Love Island&quot;, he and Maurice White co-wrote the instrumental &quot;Tahiti Hut&quot;, which (with lyrics added to it) was later recorded by the band Switch with guest vocals by Jermaine Jackson.

Deodato wrote orchestral arrangements for the films &quot;The Gentle Rain&quot; (with original soundtrack by Luiz Bonfá in 1965), and &quot;&quot;The Adventurers&quot; (with soundtrack by Antonio Carlos Jobim and additional score by Deodato in 1969), as well as the original soundtracks for &quot;&quot;Target Risk&quot;, &quot;The Reporter&quot;, &quot;The Black Pearl&quot; (1977), &quot;The Onion Field&quot; (1979), &quot;&quot;Beat Street (1980) and &quot;Bossa Nova&quot; (2000), among many others.
He also produced and arranged for the movies &quot;Body Rock&quot; and &quot;The Ghostbusters II&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Eumir Deodato was married to Ruth Deodato from 1963 to 1999. Their daughter Kennya Deodato (b. 1968) is married to actor Stephen Baldwin. Their granddaughter Hailey Bieber is married to Canadian singer Justin Bieber.

<text>Ringling Bros. World&#x27;s Greatest Shows is a circus founded in Baraboo, Wisconsin, United States in 1884 by five of the seven Ringling brothers: Albert, August, Otto, Alfred T., Charles, John, and Henry. The Ringling brothers were sons of a German immigrant, August Frederick Rüngeling, who changed his name to Ringling once he settled in America. Four brothers were born in McGregor, Iowa: Alf T., Charles, John and Henry. The Ringling family lived in McGregor, Iowa, for twelve years, from 1860 until 1872. The family then lived in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, and moved to Baraboo, Wisconsin, in 1875.

In 1907 Ringling Bros. acquired the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, merging them in 1919 to become Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, promoted as &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;. Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey closed on May 21, 2017, following weakening attendance and high operating costs.

After a six-year hiatus a newly designed production was launched in Bossier City, Louisiana September 28, 2023. The two-year tour was booked into 50 cities, but without any animals.
==History==


In 1882, before the Ringling brothers created their first circus, the five brothers performed skits and juggling routines in town halls around the state of Wisconsin. Their first show was on November 27, 1882, in Mazomanie, Wisconsin. They called this the &quot;Ringling Bros. Variety Performance&quot; when they took the show to the next town. With two wandering performers the next year, the brothers toured the Northwest. After the Northwest tour, they used the money earned for suits.

They expanded their acts into a one ring show in 1884. The show added a trick horse and a bear at the end of the season. The circus started traveling by trains in 1888 allowing the show to consistently expand.

The Ringlings acquired the Yankee Robinson Circus and opened a joint show on May 19, 1884. This brought them to the attention of James Anthony Bailey of Barnum &amp; Bailey. The brothers later met with Bailey and agreed to divide some territory. This was followed by the purchase of a half share of the Adam Forepaugh Sells Brothers Circus from Bailey. Bailey, under the area division, prohibited the Ringlings from playing at Madison Square Garden, a location it was the brothers&#x27; ambition to perform at. In 1887 Ringling Circus changed its official title to the &quot;Ringling Bros. United Monster Shows, Great Double Circus, Royal European Menagerie, Museum, Caravan, and Congress of Trained Animals.&quot;

In 1906, Bailey died, which led to the Ringlings taking over Forepaugh–Sells, which continued to operate separately. In October 1907, the stockholders of Barnum and Bailey Ltd. approved the sale of the circus to the Ringlings. Due to declining audiences, the Spanish flu pandemic and the World War I manpower shortage, the Barnum and Bailey and Ringling circuses were merged in 1919 as Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.

<text>Interstate 595 (I-595), also known as the Port Everglades Expressway and unsigned Florida State Road 862 (SR 862), is a auxiliary Interstate Highway that connects I-75 and Alligator Alley in the west with Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, I-95, Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport, U.S. Highway 1 (U.S. 1), and SR A1A before terminating at Port Everglades in the east. The Interstate route was conceived in 1969 and planned as an Interstate starting in 1974. Construction began in 1984, with the expressway opening in stages in the late 1980s, and it was completed in 1991. The reversible tolled express lanes opened in 2014.

==Route description==

Interstate 595 begins in Sunrise at the eastern part of the Sawgrass Interchange, with I-75 on the southern and western ends (I-75 &quot;north&quot; leads into Alligator Alley on the west side) and the Sawgrass Expressway (SR 869) on the northern end. From the western terminus, the highway heads east to Davie, acting as a commuter route between the western fringes of the populated part of Broward County and Fort Lauderdale. At University Drive (SR 817), I-595 goes below a partial stack interchange. Three miles east of that interchange, it meets with Florida&#x27;s Turnpike and U.S. 441. The highway then continues east into Fort Lauderdale. 

Continuing east into Fort Lauderdale, I-595 soon interchanges with I-95 at the Rainbow Interchange, located on the northwestern edge of Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport. From there, I-595 continues east along the northern edge of the airport. It then reaches the eastern end of the airport, where it has its final interchange with U.S. 1 (which runs concurrently with SR A1A at the interchange), providing access to both the airport and Port Everglades. The eastern terminus consists of two lanes for U.S. 1 southbound, two for U.S. 1 northbound and two lanes for Port Everglades via Eller Drive. The exit for southbound U.S. 1 has a ramp to the airport. SR A1A is not listed on the exit signs.

For most of its length, Florida State Road 84 – the former route number for Alligator Alley prior to its conversion to part of the extended Interstate 75 – runs parallel to the expressway, acting as a frontage road on either side of the Interstate.

==History==
I-595 grew out of an expressway plan for connecting Port Everglades with Alligator Alley, first conceived in 1969 as the Port Expressway. In 1974, once I-75 was rerouted to Broward County on Alligator Alley as a part of its eastern connection from Naples, it was proposed to be built as an Interstate. When the southern terminus of I-75 was moved from Broward to Dade County at the Palmetto Expressway (SR 826)/Gratigny Parkway (SR 924) in the late 1970s, the construction of the trans-Broward expressway was delayed. However, in September 1978, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) officially added the eastern of the route to the Interstate Highway System, with the official designation of I-595.

In the early 1980s, I-595 was planned to be partially a toll expressway to cover its cost of construction. By the time construction started on July 26, 1984, the tolls for the expressway vanished, and it was built with only minor changes in its route. The first section, between I-75 and Hiatus Road opened in May 1988, with the section between Florida&#x27;s Turnpike and US 1 opening on February 24, 1989, and the last section, connecting the disjointed sections opening on October 21, 1989. The expressway was designated as I-595 on June 11, 1990, and the Rainbow Interchange with I-95 was completed on March 22, 1991, the last unfinished interchange of the original plan.

The portion of the expressway between I-95 and US 1 follows the right-of-way of the Port Everglades railroad tracks that had previously run from the CSX Transportation railroad to Port Everglades.

In 2002, I-595, along with most of Florida&#x27;s Interstates, switched over from a sequential exit numbering system to a mileage-based exit numbering system. Numbers were changed again at about the time the express lanes were opened in early 2014.

On April 9, 2022, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Dwayne Haskins was killed after being struck by a dump truck near Davie when he was attempting to cross the westbound lanes of I-595 at 6:40 am near Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport and died at the scene.

==Express lanes==

The $1.8-billion (equivalent to $ in ) tolled SunPass express lanes project in the middle of the expressway to relieve the traffic congestion opened for test use on March 26, 2014, and started tolling on April 9, 2014. The express lanes will significantly improve the capacity and operations of the I-595 corridor by providing three additional at-grade lanes in the median of the corridor. The lanes will reverse direction in peak travel times (eastbound in the morning/westbound in the evening). To maximize the operational efficiency, the lanes will have tolls at varying rates throughout the day to optimize traffic flow, and access to and from the lanes will only be allowed west of 136th Avenue, east of US 441/SR 7, and through a direct connection to the median of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, removing long distance commuter traffic from the general purpose lanes. The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) will retain control of the toll revenue and toll rates.

<doc id="880179" wikidata="Q6092834" url="?curid=880179" title="Italian Market, Philadelphia">
<text>The Italian Market is the popular name for the South 9th Street Curb Market, an area of South Philadelphia featuring awning covered sidewalks, curb carts, grocery shops, cafes, restaurants, bakeries, cheese shops, butcher shops, etc., many with an Italian influence. The historical heart of the market is the area of 9th Street between Christian Street and Washington Avenue, the commercial district chartered in 1915, the South Ninth Street Business Men&#x27;s Association, covered the area between Catharine to Federal and Eighth to Tenth streets, and the market is now generally considered to extend from Fitzwater Street at the north to Federal Street at the south. The term Italian Market is also used to generally describe the surrounding neighborhood between South Street to the North and Wharton Street to the South running a few blocks to the east and west of 9th street.

Although it is considered the social and commercial heart of the Philadelphia Italian community, the Ninth Street Market also contained many Jewish businesses in its inception. In recent years, an influx of immigrants from Latin America, mainly from Mexico and to a lesser degree from Central American countries like Guatemala and El Salvador, has significantly contributed to the Italian Market area, and, in the southern Italian Market in particular, the Market is now also home to many stores and restaurants catering to South Philadelphia&#x27;s Hispanic population in addition to the Italian-American community.

==History==
9th Street, frequently referred to simply as The Italian Market, has its origins as a marketplace in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The area, outside the original boundaries of William Penn&#x27;s planned city, was an area for immigrants to settle. Italians began to move into the area around 1884, when Antonio Palumbo began receiving Italian immigrants into his boardinghouse. Shops along 9th Street opened up shortly after to cater to the new Italian community and have remained in the area to this day, with many of the present vendors tracing the founding of their businesses back to the first decade of the 20th century.

The area continues to attract new immigrants as a significant number of Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese and Mexican-run businesses have joined the traditional Italian shops in the market. Many new Mexican stores have opened up around the market. Many Latino immigrants also work in the market.

The market also plays host to the annual Italian Market Festival with music, activities, and food.
One of several curb markets established in the early 20th century offering fresh produce and a variety of ethnic specialty foods, it has evolved into a popular Philadelphia icon. On October 12, 2007, the Market was honored by the dedication of a Pennsylvania State Historical Marker as the &quot;South 9th Street Curb Market&quot; at the NE corner of 9th and Christian Streets.

An unofficial historical marker was erected just in front of the since-removed Frank Rizzo mural at 9th &amp; Montrose Sts in 2008. The marker, entitled &quot;The Italian Market,&quot; briefly explains about the Italian market area forming a business association in the early 1900s. The officers of the association were of central and southern Italian and eastern Sicilian heritages. The other members of the association were of northern and eastern European, Lebanese and Asian heritages.

==Today and Pop Culture References==
The outdoor market features bright colorful metal awnings covering the sidewalks where vendors of fruit, vegetables, fish, and housewares conduct business year-round. Ground floor shops in traditional Philadelphia rowhouses line the street. Many owners had originally lived above their shops, and many still do.

The market is open year-round, generally from 9 am to 5 pm, though outdoor stands and cafes often open earlier, and restaurants serve patrons late into the evening. Many businesses are open until lunchtime on Sunday, and closed Monday.

The market also plays a role in the culture of Philadelphia, often being included in cultural depictions of the city. One example, the Italian Market was featured in &quot;Rocky&quot; and &quot;Rocky II&quot;, most notably in the running/training montage where a vendor tosses the boxer an orange in the first film. The television series &quot;Hack&quot; also filmed several episodes that featured the Italian Market, and it was also featured on a season 5 episode of the television show &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;.

As Philadelphia has gentrified, so has the Italian Market. Outdoor seating at cozy cafes, upscale gift stores and gourmet shops are thriving among the market&#x27;s traditional produce vendors, specialty butchers, and cheese mongers.

During the height of the pandemic, in 2020, the market offered safer outdoor shopping, playing to its natural strength. At the same time, outdoor seating expanded—notably, with the addition of a parklet or streetery at Anthony&#x27;s Coffee House, conversion of parking to dining at DiBruno&#x27;s Piazza across the street, and the newly poured cement patio of just-opened Alma Del Mar, as well as several parklets further south at Mole Poblano and Casa Mexico. The market saw some of the greatest expansions of outdoor dining in 2020 in the city, and many of which have remained since, replacing blighted boarded-up properties or the more-weathered curb stands.

And while the attempt to form a business improvement district was shelved shortly before the pandemic —several new initiatives have breathed new life into the market, including an art project that aims to connect the market and tell the stories of its vendors. Artists such as Jon Rubin, Theresa Rose, and more recently, Michelle Angela Ortiz, have promoted the merchants while addressing some of their pain points such as barriers to resources, promotion, and aesthetic appeal. In addition to the COVID-prompted outdoor revitalization, the city&#x27;s Commerce Department received new funding (thanks to then-councilmember Parker), allowing S 9th Street to initiate its first-ever managed street sweeping program, running three mornings a week (the neighborhood association was already sweeping the surrounding streets via a crowd-funded effort). A newly-formed Business Association of Mexican Merchants is holding a first annual Day of the Dead festival in 2024. The market—once classified blighted by Planning in 2000—has made great strides to be a more diverse and vibrant destination where everyone feels welcomed.

<text>The black gang are the members of a ship&#x27;s crew who work in the fire room/engine room; they are also called stokers or firemen. They are called &quot;black&quot; because of the soot and coal dust that is thick in the air in the fire room/engine room. The term began being used in the days of coal-fired steamships. The term is commonly used in the United States Coast Guard and United States Navy to describe personnel in &quot;M&quot; and &quot;B&quot; divisions.

<text>The Chevrolet Monza is a subcompact automobile produced by Chevrolet for the 1975 through 1980 model years. The Monza is based on the Chevrolet Vega, sharing its wheelbase, width, and standard inline-four engine. The car was designed to accommodate the GM-Wankel rotary engine, but due to mediocre fuel economy and emissions-compliance issues the engine was cancelled, and a V8 engine option was substituted. The Monza name has also been used for several other cars.

Introduced for the 1975 model year, the Monza 2+2 and Monza Towne Coupe competed with the Ford Mustang II and other sporty coupes. General Motors&#x27; H-body variants, the Buick Skyhawk and Oldsmobile Starfire, were produced using the Monza 2+2&#x27;s body with grille and trim variations and Buick&#x27;s 3.8 liter V6 engine. The Pontiac Sunbird variant was introduced for the 1976 model year, initially offered only in the Monza Towne Coupe body with the 2+2 hatchback added for the 1977 model year. The Monza nameplate originated in mid-1960 for the sport version of the Chevrolet Corvair.

==History==
===Origin===

The Monza 2+2 debuted as a single-model 2+2 hatchback. The Monza is longer and weighs more than the Vega from which it is derived. General Motors&#x27; John DeLorean nicknamed it the &quot;Italian Vega&quot;, citing styling with a strong resemblance to the Ferrari 365 GTC/4.

GM had planned to introduce the GM Wankel rotary engine (licensed from NSU Motorenwerke AG) in the Monza&#x27;s 1975 model. Rotary issues included mediocre fuel economy compounded at a time of comparatively high fuel prices following the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973, and GM canceled the engine (this was the same rotary engine that AMC had planned to source from GM for the 1975 Pacer). Thus, the 1975 Chevrolet Monza was launched carrying a conventional piston engine instead.

===Overview===
The 1975 Monza 2+2 houses then-newly approved rectangular headlights and a slot-style grille in a slanted nose made of resilient polyurethane. The side window louvers are functional, part of the flow-through ventilation system. The Monza 2+2&#x27;s two-door hatchback body style is shared with the Pontiac Sunbird, Oldsmobile Starfire and Buick Skyhawk. The standard engine was the Vega&#x27;s aluminum-block  inline-four engine with a single barrel carburetor generating at 4,200 rpm. Optional was the two-barrel carburetor version that generated at 4,400 rpm. Chevrolet&#x27;s new V8 engine was optional. The smallest V8 ever offered by Chevrolet, it featured a Rochester two-barrel carburetor and generated at 3,600 rpm. For 1975 only, Monzas sold in California and high altitude areas met the stricter emissions requirement by substituting a version of the V8 engine with a two-barrel carburetor tuned to just . The Monza 2+2 and its Buick and Oldsmobile variants feature GM&#x27;s first use of a torque arm rear suspension, also adopted for the 1975 Cosworth Vega introduced mid-1975, and later, all 1976–1977 Vegas and Pontiac Astres. The basic design was also incorporated into GM&#x27;s third and fourth generation F-bodies, the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird.

In April 1975, the Monza Towne Coupe was introduced — a notchback body-style with a conventional trunk featuring different sheetmetal than the 2+2 hatchback, but sharing its windshield and front fenders. It features single round headlamps, instead of the dual rectangular headlamps on the 2+2. The Towne Coupe was offered in response to the sales success of the Ford Mustang II notchback coupe and its luxury version, the Mustang II Ghia. The Towne Coupe is shorter and lighter than the 2+2 and has slightly more rear head room.

A lower priced &quot;S&quot; version of the 2+2 hatchback was introduced mid-year. It featured as standard the Vega one-barrel engine with a three-speed manual transmission. The sport suspension, full console, sport steering wheel, day/night rear-view mirror and wheel opening moldings were deleted on the &quot;S&quot;. The Chevrolet Monza 2+2 won &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year award for 1975.

===Model year changes===
The 1976 four-cylinder engine, as used in the Vega, got some refinements. Named &quot;Dura-built 140&quot;, it features quieter hydraulic lifters eliminating valve adjustments. The basic four developed 70 horsepower, but two-barrel carburetion increased the rating to 84. The 1976 model was the introduction of Chevrolet&#x27;s new 5.0 liter (305 CID) V8 engine with a two-barrel carburetor generating at 3,800 rpm, but only for California and high-altitude Monza customers, and replaced the 350 V8. The 262 was again the optional engine in 49 states. A redesigned dashboard replaced the Vega-derived one. A mid-year option for 1976 was a &quot;Sport&quot; front end available for the Towne Coupe, which featured the 2+2&#x27;s polyurethane front end and quad headlamps. The Monza Spyder equipment package was introduced in 1976 for both the 2+2 hatchback and Towne Coupe. It featured a two-barrel carburetor version of the four-cylinder engine as standard, a floor console, sport steering wheel, F41 suspension with larger front and rear stabilizer bars, and special shock absorbers. This equipment had been standard on the original 1975 2+2 (excluding the mid-year &quot;S&quot; model).

The 1977 Monza was highlighted by two new Spyder option packages available only for the 2+2 hatchback, one being a $274 Z01 performance equipment package and the other an additional $199 Z02 appearance package. An four-cylinder engine was standard, but Monzas could be ordered with a V8 instead. The Monza dashboard contained round gauges in a brushed-aluminum instrument panel. The Towne Coupe Cabriolet was deleted, but a half-vinyl roof and opera windows could still be ordered.

The Monza “Mirage” was a one-year only (1977) sporty body modification package produced by Michigan Auto Techniques (MAT), an aftermarket company contracted by GM; the Mirage was painted white, with red and blue racing stripes along the length of the car. It also featured flared body panels and a special airdam and spoiler. The vehicles were built in GM&#x27;s St. Therese plant, and sent to MAT for modification, after which MAT would ship completed cars to the dealer. There were approximately 4,097 1977 Mirages made by MAT, but there were also Mirages created by Chevrolet dealerships, as the body add-ons and stripes were available through the dealer parts department. The 5.0 liter (305 CID) engine was the only V8 option for the 1977 model year. The standard Vega 2.3 aluminum-block engine was discontinued at the end of the model year, replaced with the Pontiac 2.5 &quot;Iron Duke&quot;.

The 1978 Monza line expanded to include rebadged holdovers from the Vega line, which ended production after the 1977 model year. Chevy grafted a new Monza front end onto the previous Vega hatchback and wagon body-styles. The Monza &quot;S&quot;, marketed as the Monza price leader, used the Vega hatchback body. With production of only 2,000 units, it was speculated that this was simply an effort to use up a stock of leftover 1977 Vega hatchback bodies. The Monza wagon was also offered in an estate wood-trimmed version, using the Vega wagon body. The 1978 Monza line gained a new base coupe and 2+2 hatchback with round headlights in an upright front end with a crossbar grille and new tri-colored taillamps. The base 2+2 hatchback also used a new blunt rear taillamp panel incorporating the license plate mount and a conventional rear bumper; its enlarged taillights with square amber turn signals were also used on notchback coupes. The new Monza Sport series was offered in both 2+2 hatchback and notchback body styles, using a modified version of the previous quad rectangular headlamps, now above a full-width open-slot grill. The 2.5 liter (151 CID) inline-four &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was standard for 1978, replacing the Vega&#x27;s inline-four engine. Engine options were a Buick-designed 3.2 liter (196 CID) V6 engine with a two-barrel carburetor that produced at 3,600 rpm. Replacing the 3.2 liter V6 in California and high-altitude areas was Buick&#x27;s 3.8 liter (231 CID) V6 engine. Four-cylinder engines and the 3.2 liter V6 were not available in high-altitude areas. The 305 cubic-inch V8 remained optional in all but the &quot;S&quot; hatchback and wagon models. Discontinued at the end of the 1978 model year were the S hatchback, Towne Coupe sport option and the estate version of the wagon.

The 1979 Chevrolet Monza lineup was trimmed to four models. Added standard equipment for 1979 included an AM radio, tinted glass, bodyside moldings, and sport steering wheel. Only the 2+2 sport hatchback kept the sloped Euro-look front end; others had a freshened grille. A more-potent standard four-cylinder with a redesigned cross-flow cylinder head and two-barrel carburetor developed 90-horsepower — five more than in 1978. Three optional engines were available: the V6, 231 V6, and 305 V8. The Spyder performance package cost $164 and the Spyder appearance package added $231. All Monzas had a color-keyed instrument panel, and all except the base coupe had a center console, and corrosion protection was improved. Discontinued at the end of the 1979 model year were the Monza wagon, the V6 and the V8.

The 1980 model year lineup consisted of a base 2+2 hatchback, notchback, and 2+2 sport hatchback; the 151-cubic-inch (2.5-liter) four-cylinder engine remained standard and the only engine option was the 3.8 liter (231 CID) Buick V6. The wagon was discontinued as the Citation hatchbacks offered equal cubic cargo capacity with the rear seats down along with better rear-passenger accommodation. Chevrolet decided to discontinue the Monza at the end of the 1980 model year although production of 1980 models continued to the end of calendar 1980 with its &quot;1982&quot; Cavalier replacement debuting in early calendar 1981.

===Monza Spyder===
The &quot;Spyder&quot; nameplate had been used to designate the 1962–1964 Corvair turbocharged model. The &quot;Spyder&quot; name was introduced for the Chevrolet Monza in 1976. This package included performance equipment and some small appearance items. The Monza Spyder equipment package was available on all 2+2 hatchbacks and Monza Towne Coupes (with the &quot;sport equipment&quot; package) with five-speed manual and Turbo Hydra-matic automatic transmissions. The Spyder equipment package included a two-barrel, Dura-Built 2.3 litre engine, floor console unit, large front and rear stabilizer bars, special shock absorbers, steel-belted radial ply blackwall tires, wheel opening mouldings (chrome), day-night inside mirror, a sport steering wheel (two-spoke), a special instrumentation and &quot;stitched&quot; instrument panel pad with added wood-grain vinyl accents (standard on 2+2), distinctive &quot;Spyder&quot; identification (script fender emblems, steering wheel horn button insert) and Spyder front facia and rear-lock cover.

Chevrolet made extensive changes to the Spyder package including separate equipment and appearance packages with separate RPO codes found on the build sheet. The Spyder equipment package was a regular production option (RPO) Z01, while the Spyder appearance package was RPO Z02. The Spyder packages were available on Monza 2+2 sport hatchbacks. Spyder decal colors were determined by the body color of the Monza ordered. There were four color combinations for 1977. For 1979, there were six combinations, which included a green and a blue color scheme.

;Z01 – Spyder equipment : BR70-13C Steel-belted radial ply blackwall tires, sport suspension, sport steering wheel (two-spoke), center console, inside day-night rearview mirror, Spyder identification, wheel opening moldings (available if the Z02 – Spyder appearance package was not ordered), dual tailpipe system and white lettered tires were available in 1979.

;Z02 – Spyder appearance : Black highlights on front, side and rear of body headlight openings, parking light openings, windshield, rear window and side window moldings, body sill, door and center pillar louvers, rear end panel – (bright window moldings with black exterior), black or gold rear accents (taillight blackouts and rear end panel decals), body color front air dam and rear spoiler, Spyder emblems (front facia, rear lock cover and sport steering wheel horn button insert), body side stripes with Spyder lettering in red, white or gold depending on body color, black painted styled-steel wheels with trim rings and center caps, black sport mirrors, special hood decal and rear spoiler decal. For the 1980 model year, Chevrolet combined the Spyder equipment and appearance packages into one Spyder equipment package with an RPO code of Z29 and included newly re-designed bold Spyder side decals and a new front air dam that blends into the front fender wheel openings. Spyder decal color choices (five) were based primarily upon the interior color specified rather than the body color as in previous years.

;Z29 – Spyder equipment package : BR70-13C steel-belted radial ply blackwall tires (with option for raised white lettering), sport suspension, black front and rear bumper rub strips, black headlights frames, black windshield, belt, side and rear window moldings (not available with black exterior), black painted body sill (also not available with black exterior), black door and center pillar louvers, black painted taillight frames, body color front air dam and rear spoiler, Spyder emblems on front facia, rear lock cover and sport steering wheel (horn button insert), black sport mirrors (LH remote, RH manual), rear spoiler and body stripes with Spyder lettering outlined in accent body colour, Spyder hood decal, black painted Rally II wheels with bright trim rings and center caps.
===Wankel engine===

In November 1970, GM paid $50 million for initial licenses to produce the Wankel rotary engine, and GM president Ed Cole projected its release in three years. The GM Wankel was initially targeted for an October 1973 introduction as a 1974 Vega option. The General Motors Rotary Combustion Engine (GMRCE) had two rotors displacing , twin distributors and coils, and aluminum housing,

Unwilling to face the gas mileage criticism that Mazda withstood, GM felt it could meet 1975 emissions standards with the engine tuned to provide better mileage. Other refinements improved mileage to a remarkable 20 mpg, but with the fuel breakthrough came related side-effect problems — apex seal failures, as well as a rotor tip-seal problem. By December 1973, it was clear the Wankel, now planned for the Monza 2+2, would not be ready for either production or emissions certification in time for the start of the 1975 model year. and after paying another $10 million against its rotary licence fees, the company announced the first postponement. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; in April 1974 predicted the outcome — On September 24, 1974, Cole postponed the Wankel engine ostensibly due to emissions difficulties and retired the same month. General Motors admitted fuel economy for the rotary was sub-standard and postponed production in favor of further development. Pete Estes succeeded Cole as GM&#x27;s president and never showed any special interest in the Wankel or in the perpetuation of Cole&#x27;s ideas. Estes had previously decided to let the Corvair, another Cole project, expire, well before the celebrated attacks of Ralph Nader.

=== End of the H-body ===

A total of 731,504 Monzas were produced in six model years. General Motors replaced the rear-wheel drive (RWD) H-body Monza, Sunbird, Skyhawk, and Starfire in the spring of 1981 with a new, front-wheel drive (FWD), line-up, the J-car models: Chevrolet Cavalier, Oldsmobile Firenza, Buick Skyhawk, Pontiac J2000 and Cadillac Cimarron, introduced as 1982 models. Because the forthcoming J-body cars were to be sold as 1982 models, there was a long production run of 1980 H-body models in order to provide sufficient inventory to carry dealers until the spring of 1981.
==Motorsports==
===United States===

Chevrolet Monzas participated in the IMSA GT Series powered by Chevrolet Corvette engines. Chevrolet Monzas were the challengers in the new AAGT class. The class was designed to allow such cars to compete with the best GT cars in the world. The 1975 season was launched with the new cars that would compete with the dominating Porsche Carreras. A very liberal set of rules allowed some body panels to be retained – the windshield, the rear window and the roof. Everything else was built from scratch.

The IMSA racer and future triple Le Mans and dual Daytona 24 Hours winner Al Holbert saw the Monza&#x27;s potential. By the end of the 1975 season, he had ordered a brand new car, built and prepared by Lee Dykstra and American-based Australian Trans-Am driver Horst Kwech at DeKon Engineering. Chassis No. 1008 was used starting the 1976 season. In 1976 and 1977, he was the IMSA Camel GT champion, beating Hans Stuck, Brian Redman and Peter Gregg. In Holbert&#x27;s successful 1977 campaign he captured another Camel GT crown. However, it would be the last title for an American car. The Porsche 935s were becoming unbeatable right from the beginning of the 1978 season. However, the DeKon built Chevrolet Monza left its footprint on the IMSA Camel GT. They were quite unbeatable in 1976–1977. Chevrolet Monzas were seen in IMSA until 1986. Chris Cord&#x27;s original DeKon Monza is owned and vintage raced today by Ken Epsman, while Holbert&#x27;s Monza has been found and is now undergoing restoration in northern California.

===Australia===
The Monza also saw success in Australia in the late 1970s and through the 1980s in the Australian Sports Sedan Championship (ASSC) (renamed the Australian GT Championship in 1982). GM&#x27;s presence in Australia was represented by Holden which was Australia&#x27;s own manufacturer of GM vehicles. Neither the Nova or the Monza were ever offered to the Australian public. Allan Moffat otherwise imported a DeKon Monza to Australia and won the inaugural ASCC in 1976 (also driving a &#x27;Cologne&#x27; Ford Capri RS3100). In 1978, driver and prominent businessman Bob Jane imported a DeKon Monza, which was rebuilt and engineered by his chief mechanic Pat Purcell and driver-engineer Ron Harrop. Jane had some success with the car but it was at times plagued by poor reliability, and when he retired at the end of 1981 due to a back injury, he recruited touring car star driver Peter Brock to drive the car. Brock drove the 6.0L Monza in the 1982 and 1983 GT championships for Jane. A second Monza was built by Jane&#x27;s team which was to have been raced in an IMSA street race in Miami in the early 1980s by Brock and Australia&#x27;s Formula One champion Alan Jones, though it was never raced in the USA.

In the 1982 championship, Brock came up against Jones in a well sorted, and slightly more powerful Porsche 935 turbo. Brock and the Monza consistently matched the speed of Jones and the two put on some of the best racing ever seen in Australia, but reliability was still a problem with the car and results were not forthcoming. Brock was involved in a spectacular start line crash in round three of the 1983 championship at the Adelaide International Raceway and the Monza was not seen again until the end of the year when Brock finished third in a GT/sports car invitation race as a support to the 1983 Australian Grand Prix. After being rebuilt again by Purcell, Jane sold the car to former race driver Alan Browne, who put his 1982 Bathurst 1000 pole winning co-driver Allan Grice in it for the 1984 GT championship. Grice and the Monza easily won the championship, winning all but one round. Grice, who had never gotten along with Purcell, was so impressed with the car after he first drove it that he phoned Purcell to compliment him on what he felt was the best race car he had driven in his more than 20-year career.

The Monza was then prepared for the 1984 Sandown 1000, the final round of the 1984 World Endurance Championship. Driving alongside renowned Ron Harrop and fellow touring car ace Dick Johnson, Grice qualified the Monza a credible 18th (second in the invitation AC Class for Australian GT and Group A Sports Cars), and claimed the car lost nothing on the straights to the race winning Porsche 956B&#x27;s, but lost time in the turns to the ground effects Porsches. Johnson later claimed that the car had more grunt from its 6.0L V8 than its handling deserved. They were eventually disqualified for receiving outside assistance from track marshals after completing 114 of the races 206 laps.

After 1984, Browne sold the Monza to veteran racer Bryan Thompson, who used it (along with his usual Chevrolet powered, twin turbo Mercedes-Benz 450 SLC) to win the 1985 Australian GT Championship. Thomson competed in the car over the next few years before rebuilding it over the 1988–89 off-season which also saw the Monza body shell replaced with that of a Toyota Supra. He then sold the car in 1990 to an unknown owner who then sold it to longtime Sydney-based sports car racer Des Wall. Wall was also successful with the Supra-bodied car and retained ownership of the car until his death in 2012. The car is owned by his son, racing driver and race team owner David Wall.

Others to drive a Chevrolet Monza in Australian Sports Sedan / GT racing included: John Briggs who raced a Monza built by K&amp;A Engineering in Adelaide, Graeme Whincup (the uncle of multiple V8 Supercar and Bathurst 1000 champion Jamie Whincup), who drove a Monza he built for racing in 1979, and Jeff Barnes.

The Monza was also a favourite of drivers in dirt track racing in Australia in both super sedan and grand national racing during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Successful Monza drivers in speedway include Sydney Grand National driver Barry Graham.

==Brazil==
In Brazil, the Opel Ascona C was sold from May 1982 until 1996 as the Chevrolet Monza.

==China==
The Chevrolet Monza was revived for the Chinese market and was launched in March 2019 in Wuhan. Available as a four-door sedan, it is available in two trim levels known as 320T and 330T and five models. The 320T is available with a 1-litre turbocharged three cylinder engine while the 330T gets a 1.3 litre turbocharged three cylinder engine as standard. 1 litre models gain access to a 6 speed manual and 6 speed dual clutch gearbox while 1.3 litre models are only available with a 6 speed automatic gearbox. Pricing ranges between 89,900 yuan and 119,900 yuan (US$13,350 to 17,800).

<text>Alison Hammond (born 5 February 1975) is a British television presenter and actress. She competed in the third series of the reality show &quot;Big Brother&quot; in 2002, in which she was the second housemate to be evicted. She has since become a presenter and reporter on ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; (2002–present) and a co-presenter on the Channel 4 reality baking competition &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot; (2023–present). In January 2024, it was announced that Hammond would take over &quot;For the Love of Dogs&quot; from Paul O&#x27;Grady, following his death in March 2023.

Hammond has also appeared on reality shows such as &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; (2010), &quot;Celebrity Coach Trip&quot; (2012), &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; (2014), &quot;Celebrity Masterchef&quot; (2014), and &quot;I Can See Your Voice&quot; (2021–2022). As an actress, Hammond has appeared in &quot;Palace Hill&quot; (1988–1990), &quot;Doctors&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Dumping Ground&quot; (2016).

==Early and personal life==
Hammond was born on 5 February 1975 to Jamaican parents and was raised in the north Birmingham district of Kingstanding alongside her two siblings. She attended Cardinal Wiseman School. Her mother had several jobs concurrently, including one as a manager for Tupperware. From the age of 11, Hammond participated in drama workshops run by Central Television, but lack of funds meant she was unable to attend drama school. She later moved to Hall Green in south Birmingham. She was previously engaged to Noureddine Boufaied from 2005 to 2014, and together the couple have one son, born in 2005.

==Career==
In 2002, Hammond competed on the third series of the Channel 4 reality series &quot;Big Brother&quot;. That same year, she appeared in an episode of the BBC soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot; in an acting role and also began presenting and reporting for ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot;. Hammond then appeared on many television programmes, including &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;, &quot;Celebrities Under Pressure,&quot; and &quot;Big Star&#x27;s Little Star&quot;. She has also appeared on &quot;Celebrity Stars in Their Eyes&quot;, performing as Nina Simone, &quot;Celebrity Ready Steady Cook&quot;, &quot;Daily Cooks Challenge&quot;, as a panellist on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Loose Women&quot;, and as a presenter on the short-lived &quot;ITV Play&quot; channel. In 2004, Hammond played herself as a TV reporter in &quot;Christmas Lights&quot; opposite Robson Green. In 2008, Hammond was named as the face of online bingo site Crown Bingo and took part in live chats, voiced characters and can be heard as the bingo caller in the bingo room. In November 2010, Hammond became a contestant on the tenth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; and, on 28 November 2010, became the fourth contestant to leave the show.

In 2014, Hammond participated in the ninth series of &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot; on BBC One. She also participated in the twelfth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in 2014 on BBC One. She partnered with 11th series&#x27; champion Aljaž Škorjanec. They were voted off in the seventh week of competition and finished 10th. On 19 November 2015, it was announced she would compete in the annual &quot;Strictly&quot; Christmas Special. Hammond made her Hollywood debut in the animated film &quot;Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation&quot; (2018). In 2020, ITV announced a shake-up of &quot;This Morning&quot; presenters, with Hammond replacing Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on a Friday, presenting alongside Dermot O&#x27;Leary. Hammond and O&#x27;Leary have since taken on the other days after the respective resignations of Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby in the summer and autumn of 2023 as part of a rotation of hosts.

In December 2020, Alison appeared as a celebrity guest on game show &quot;The Wheel&quot; on BBC One. She also played the Countess in the Sainsbury&#x27;s 2022 Christmas advert. Hammond then hosted the 76th British Academy Film Awards with Richard E. Grant. It was announced in March 2023 that Hammond would be the new co-host of &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot;, replacing Matt Lucas.

From April 2024 she has presented &quot;For the Love of Dogs&quot;, following the death of original presenter Paul O&#x27;Grady.

<doc id="880186" wikidata="Q1471140" url="?curid=880186" title="Oldsmobile Firenza">
<text>The Oldsmobile Firenza was a compact car which was produced by Oldsmobile from 1982 to 1988. It was based on the front-wheel drive GM J platform, which was shared with the Buick Skyhawk, Cadillac Cimarron, Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunbird. It was not based on the European market Vauxhall Firenza, but on the same platform as the Vauxhall Cavalier Mk 2 / Opel Ascona C. The Firenza name was previously used as a performance package on the previous generation Oldsmobile Starfire hatchback.

==Overview==
The all-new Firenza was introduced in March 1982, as a replacement for the departed rear-wheel drive Starfire. Initially available as a two-door hatchback and four-door sedan, the lineup was expanded to include a 4-door &quot;Cruiser&quot; wagon in 1983, and a two-door notchback coupe in 1986. The name &quot;Cruiser&quot; was applied to all Oldsmobile station wagons at the time; this included the mid-sized Cutlass Cruiser and full-size Custom Cruiser. The Firenza was positioned as Oldsmobile&#x27;s entry-level compact car, priced below the slightly larger Omega and later Calais/Cutlass Calais. Despite this, the Firenza could be equipped with premium options such as power windows, power locks, and 14-inch alloy wheels. The 1982 Firenza LX sedan was listed for $8,080 ($ in dollars ). It is named for the Italian translation of the city of Florence. 

As a badge engineered, variant of the GM J-car platform, the Firenza received its own front and rear-end styling. The upper portion of the Firenza front end featured quad rectangular headlights separated by signal lights in recessed housings, with a sloped body-color panel between the headlights. The dashboard unit was shared with the Buick Skyhawk.

A horizontal-barred grille was mounted in the lower portion of the front fascia. The rear featured nearly square taillights with a slight wraparound at the outboard ends of the upper rear panel. The suspension was shared with the front-wheel-drive Omega and Cutlass Ciera, which consisted of MacPherson struts, lower control arms, coil springs and a stabilizer bar for the front, and a torsion-beam rear axle, along with coil springs and rear stabilizer bars.

The Firenza was launched with a 2.0-liter OHV inline four-cylinder engine as the sole powerplant, but an overhead-cam 1.8-liter engine was added during the model year. Oldsmobile did not utilize turbo on these engines, while Buick and Pontiac offered a turbo.
Wraparound amber turn signal lights were added immediately outboard of the headlights for 1984. In 1985, the 2.8 L LB6 V6 was added as an option with the GT package.

For the Firenza&#x27;s last model year in 1988, it received a conventional horizontal bar grille between new aerodynamic composite headlamps and new tail lights, styled similar to the Cutlass Ciera. Also for the Firenza&#x27;s final year, the hatchback was dropped along with the V6, leaving just the four-cylinder notchback coupe, sedan, and wagon models. Also for 1988, all previous trim-level designations were dropped. All Firenza body styles came in a single unnamed base model that could be equipped with six various option packages.

Sales of the Cavalier and Sunbird annually dwarfed the Firenza. Due to this, the Firenza was not replaced in Oldsmobile&#x27;s lineup, leaving the Cutlass Calais as the division&#x27;s smallest car. The Cimarron was discontinued that year as well. Leeds Assembly, which built the Firenza, was closed. The Skyhawk lasted another year, while GM kept the first-generation Sunbird and Cavalier in production until 1994.

==GT==
The Firenza GT was only available on the S Coupe hatchback, unlike the Chevy Cavalier Z24, Buick Skyhawk T-Type, and Pontiac Sunbird GT, which could be had as either two-door hatchbacks, two-door and four-door sedans. Four door hatchbacks of the J-platform were offered in Europe.
GTs first were introduced in 1983, 65 were built; red with silver lower panel accent color, sold as &quot;Brass Hat&quot; promotional cars for dealerships, most were equipped with the &quot;new&quot; 1.8-liter overhead cam motor, with either a three-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission. FE3 suspension was included in the package with a rear-stabilizer bar, heavier struts all the way around, and a wider 205/60 tire offering on the 14&quot; polycast wheels as standard for the GT package. 1984; red/silver carried over plus white with silver lower body color was added. 2312 GTs were produced, less than 20% were white. Engines either were the 2.0-liter (four-speed manual or three-speed auto) or the 1.8-liter (five-speed manual or three-speed auto). 

For 1985, 498 GTs were built, body colors were changed to either black or gray with silver trim (not as pronounced as with the 1983-84s.) A fiberglass hood with a pronounced center bulge was included, the 2.8-liter V6 was offered with only the four-speed manual or the three-speed auto, the wheels were changed to aluminum from the previous polycast wheel, this was to be the same for 1986 GT. 1986 was the only year the GT as its own separate trim level (with 1032 built), and the body color red became available again with silver accent. For 1987, the GT model (of 783 built), went back to an option on the hatchback and was the last year offered, essentially same as 1986, but added the availability of the heavier five-speed manual transmission that was on the 1.8-liter offering three years previous, along with the three-speed auto. The LB6 2.8-liter V6, 5-speed Getrag manual equipped 1987 Firenza GT performed 0-60mph in 8.6 seconds (0-100 km/h 9.1 seconds), with a top speed of 124mph (200km/h), doing the 1/4 mile (402m) drag in 16.6 seconds. The 3-speed automatic equipped GT did 0-60mph in 9.6 seconds (0-100 km/h 10.2 seconds), with a top speed of 109mph (175 km/h), doing the 1/4 mile (402m) in 17.3 seconds. Interesting note; The &quot;GT&quot; was used on the Calais and Ciera in 1987, replacing the &quot;ES&quot; (EuroSport) designation the previous two years, 1984-1985. 

The Firenza ES (EuroSport) sedan was introduced in Canada for 1984, and the U.S. in 1985. Not much is known of this offering, it had blacked out headlight bezels and blacked out trim on the tail lights, the interior upholstery used the same two color gray combo and red piping as with all the GTs. This was offered as a four-door GT trim, with the same polycast wheels, heavier suspension, used on the 1983 and 1984 GT hatchbacks. They were only offered in a dark-silver body color.

<text>The African stonechat or common stonechat (Saxicola torquatus) is a species of the Old World flycatcher family (Muscicapidae), inhabiting sub-Saharan Africa and adjacent regions. Like the other chats, it was long assigned to the thrush family (Turdidae), to which the chats are convergent. Its scientific name refer to its appearance and habitat and means &quot;collared rock-dweller&quot;: &quot;Saxicola&quot; from Latin (&quot;rock&quot;) + &#x27; (&quot;one who dwells in a place&quot;),&#x27;, Latin for &quot;collared&quot;.

In the past &quot;S. torquatus&quot; usually referred to the entire &quot;common stonechat&quot; superspecies and some sources still keep it that way, but all available evidence strongly supports full species status for the European (&quot;S. rubicola&quot;) and the Siberian stonechat (&quot;S. maurus&quot;) of temperate Eurasia, in addition to the island-endemics Fuerteventura chat (&quot;S. dacotiae&quot;) and Réunion stonechat (&quot;S. tectes&quot;) which were never unequivocally accepted into &quot;S. torquatus&quot;. The Madagascar stonechat is also considered distinct. In addition, the well-marked populations of the Horn of Africa uplands may well qualify for an additional species.

==Systematics and taxonomy==
In 1760, the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the African Stonechat in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected from the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. He used the French name and the Latin &quot;Muscicapa Torquata Capitis Bonae Spei&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the African Stonechat. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Muscicapa torquata&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The specific name is from Latin &quot;&quot; &quot;collared&quot;. This species is now placed in the genus &quot;Saxicola&quot; that was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1802.

The closest relative of this species are apparently not the Eurasian populations but the Réunion stonechat (&quot;S. tectes&quot;), but still the &quot;white-collared&quot; &quot;Saxicola&quot; form a distinct group in the genus. &quot;S. torquatus&quot; and &quot;S. tectes&quot; form a sub-Saharan African lineage that diverged from the Eurasian one in the Late Pliocene, roughly 2.5 million years ago. Réunion was colonized shortly thereafter, indicating a rapid expansion along the Indian Ocean coast of Africa. With the Sahara drying out in the subsequent Quaternary glaciation, the African and Eurasian populations became isolated for good.

The recent separation as species was proposed after mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence and nDNA microsatellite fingerprinting analysis of specimens of the subspecies &quot;Saxicola torquatus axillaris&quot; but not &quot;S. t. torquatus&quot;, and hence this species was briefly known as &quot;S. axillaris&quot;.

===Subspecies===
There are 13 recognised subspecies. They differ slightly in size, and more in the extent of the orange-red on the upper breast of the males, and whether the lower breast is white with a distinct boundary from the upper breast, or pale orange with an indistinct boundary from the darker upper breast. The extent of the orange-red also varies with time of year, often extending on to the belly outside the breeding season.

==Description==

The males have a black head, a white half-collar, a black back, a white rump, and a black tail; the wings are black with a large white patch on the top side of the inner wing. The upper breast is usually dark orange-red, with a sharp or gradual transition to white or pale orange on the lower breast and belly depending on subspecies. In a few, black replaces the orange breast feathers in part or entirely.

Females have brown rather than black above and on the head with an indistinct paler eyebrow line, chestnut-buff rather than orange below, and less white on the wings. Both sexes&#x27; plumage is somewhat duller and streakier outside the breeding season.

==Distribution and habitat==
It has a scattered distribution across much of sub-Saharan Africa, occurring locally as far north as Senegal and Ethiopia. Outlying populations are found the mountains of southwest Arabia and on Madagascar and Grande Comore. It is non-migratory, moving only locally if at all. As a result, it has developed much regional variation, being divided into 13 subspecies.

<text>Marvin Andrews CM (born 22 December 1975) is a Trinidadian former professional footballer who played as a centre back.

Andrews&#x27;s career includes spells at Livingston, with whom he won the Scottish League Cup in 2004, and Rangers, where he won the double of the League Cup and the Scottish Premier League title in 2005. Most recently he played for Scottish League Two club Clyde.

Between 1996 and 2006 Andrews was a regular for the Trinidad and Tobago national football team, winning 99 caps up to that point. He had stated that he wished for another callup in future, and earned his 100th cap in a 3–2 defeat to Costa Rica in a FIFA World Cup qualifying match on 6 June 2009.

== Club career ==
Andrews is tall, strong and very good in the air, as he has proven with a few goals over the years. Before moving to Scotland, he played with Carib F.C. of Trinidad.

Raith Rovers sold Andrews for around £50,000 in a multi-player deal, and he signed for Livingston on 28 September 2000. He was voted Raith Rovers&#x27; &quot;Player of the Day&quot; in the 1999–00 season, and also Livingston&#x27;s &quot;Player of the Year&quot; for the 2003–04 season. On 14 March 2004, Andrews picked up his first major medal when Livingston won the 2003-04 Scottish League Cup by beating Hibernian 2–0 with goals by Derek Lilley and Jamie McAllister.

Andrews signed a two-year deal with Rangers in May 2004 and at the end of his first season with Rangers he scooped the Rangers Players&#x27; Player of the Year award, the club also won the Scottish Premier League title on the last day of the season. He was released by Rangers at the end of the 2005–06 season and was a free agent for a short while, before being re-signed by his former club Raith Rovers on 4 October 2006.

In May 2008, Andrews left Raith by mutual consent. He appeared for them as a trialist a little less than a year later, playing for the full 90 minutes in a 1–0 win over East Fife. Andrews stated that he wished to remain with Rovers for the rest of the season and signed up yet again with Raith Rovers on 11 March 2009. In July 2009, Andrews signed for SPL club Hamilton Academical.

On 7 December 2009, Dumfries club Queen of the South announced Andrews had signed on a one-month loan as cover for the suspended David Lilley and Stephen McKenna. Manager Gordon Chisholm gave Andrews his Queens debut on 12 December in the 2–1 win away to Morton. With bad weather causing a series of fixture postponements at Palmerston Park, Andrews played only one other game for Queens during the loan period, in the 2–2 draw away at Partick Thistle. However Andrews returned to QoS by signing a six-month deal on 29 January 2010. Andrews was released by Queens at the end of the 2009–10 season.

He joined Wrexham in August 2010 on a short term contract for the 2010–11 season in the Conference Premier. At the end of 2011, he left Wrexham and joined Scottish Junior Football Association, West Region club Kirkintilloch Rob Roy.

At the start of 2013, he joined Albion Rovers in the Second Division. In July 2013, it was confirmed that he had signed for Forfar Athletic.

On 10 August 2014, Andrews made his debut for League Two side Elgin City. Andrews set up Craig Gunn to score the only goal of the game, as Elgin beat East Fife 1–0. After three games as a trialist, including two man of the match performances and one goal against Annan Athletic, Andrews signed a one-year deal with Elgin. He is quoted as saying &quot;It’s a very, very nice club with great supporters, and the team plays very attractive football.&quot; He scored his second goal for Elgin in a 5-4 defeat to Bo&#x27;ness United F.C. in the Scottish Cup.

In January 2015, Andrews joined Montrose, and scored his first goal for the club in a 3-3 draw with Berwick Rangers. On 16 May 2015, he scored as Montrose came from behind to defeat Highland Football League champions Brora Rangers in a play-off to maintain their status in the SPFL. In September 2015, at the age of 39, Andrews signed for Clyde, playing in Scottish League Two. He scored on his debut against former club Elgin City. After playing in just 13 League matches, Marvin was released by the club at the end of the 2015–16 season.

== International career ==
Andrews was a key player for the Trinidad and Tobago national team. Having made his international début in 1996, Andrews has joined Angus Eve and Stern John in earning 100 caps for his country. He was a regular member of the national team during their qualification process for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, but a knee injury sustained prior to the opening match against Sweden virtually ruled him out of the tournament. Brent Sancho took his place in the team alongside Dennis Lawrence.

== Personal life ==
A devout Christian, Andrews also practices faith healing at the &quot;Zion Praise Centre International&quot;, a church based in Kirkcaldy which is described as being Pentecostal. Andrews claims his faith was largely inspired by former Livingston teammate Javier Sánchez Broto.

In the 2004–05 season (his first season with Rangers) he injured the cruciate ligament in his knee while playing. The injury was supposed to keep him off the field for months but Marvin Andrews was only off for one Scottish League Cup match and was back the next week as he believed God would keep him fit, a move which worried medical staff and supporters alike. Andrews&#x27; leg and form held up for the rest of the season, which saw his first SPL medal but the same injury eventually caught up with him, ruling him out of Trinidad And Tobago&#x27;s World Cup 2006 campaign. When Andrews scored for Rangers, or won the Man of the Match at Ibrox Stadium, the song &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot; by The Monkees was played.

In February 2006, Andrews controversially labelled gay people as &quot;an abomination&quot; and said, &quot;There is a demon in their spirits, their spirits are ill. But God can help them through his church and anyone who doubts this can check the Bible&quot;. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in October 2007, he sought to clarify his beliefs, claiming that what was written in the 2006 article was &quot;a misquote and it was taken out of context&quot; and saying that he did not have anything against gay people themselves, rather that it was gay sexual practises that he believed were against God&#x27;s will.

==Awards==
As a member of the Trinidad and Tobago squad that competed at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, Andrews was awarded the Chaconia Medal (Gold Class), the second highest state decoration of Trinidad and Tobago.

==History==

===Establishment===
On July 15, 1961, to meet the burgeoning educational demands of South Florida, the state legislature passed an act authorizing the establishment of a new university in the city of Boca Raton. Florida Atlantic University was built on Boca Raton Army Airfield, a 1940s-era army airbase. During World War II, the airfield served as the Army Air Corps&#x27; sole radar training facility. The base was built on the existing Boca Raton Airport and on 5,860 acres (23.7 km2) of adjacent land. A majority of the land was acquired from Japanese-American farmers from the failing Yamato Colony. The land was seized through eminent domain, leaving many Japanese-Americans little recourse in the early days of World War II.
The airbase was used for radar training, anti-submarine patrols along the coast, and as a stop-over point for planes being ferried to Africa and Europe via South America. The airfield was composed of four runways, still visible on the Boca Campus today and mainly used for parking.

By early 1947, the military decided to transfer future radar training operations to Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi. The departure of the air force in 1947 would leave Boca Raton Army Airfield essentially abandoned.

===Expansion and growth===
Florida Atlantic University opened on September 14, 1964, with an initial student body of 867 students in five colleges. The first degree awarded was an honorary doctorate given to President Lyndon B. Johnson on October 25, 1964, at the dedication and opening of the university. At the time of its opening, there were 350 employees, of which 120 were faculty. On-campus housing for students was first added in September 1965, when Algonquin Hall opened.

Florida Atlantic&#x27;s history is one of continuing expansion as the university&#x27;s service population has grown. The university originally served only upper-division and graduate level students, because the state intended the institution &quot;to complement the state&#x27;s community college system, accepting students who had earned their associate degrees from those institutions.&quot;

Florida Atlantic began its expansion beyond a one-campus university in 1971, when it opened its Commercial Boulevard campus in Fort Lauderdale. Due to a rapidly expanding population in South Florida, in 1984 Florida Atlantic opened its doors to lower-division undergraduate students. The following year, the university added its third campus in downtown Fort Lauderdale on Las Olas Boulevard.

===Recent history===

In 1989, the Florida Legislature recognized demands for higher education in South Florida by designating Florida Atlantic as the lead state university serving Broward County. To fill this role, the university would establish a campus in Dania Beach in 1997 and another campus in the City of Davie in western Broward County in 1990. Florida Atlantic later purchased 50 acres (20 ha) of land in Port St. Lucie in 1994 to establish a campus on the Treasure Coast. This would be the institution&#x27;s fifth campus. The university continued its expansion in 1999 when it opened its Jupiter Campus, named for the late John D. MacArthur. This campus houses the university&#x27;s honors college.

Florida Atlantic University and the University of Miami&#x27;s Miller School of Medicine established a medical training program within the Charles E. Schmidt College of Biomedical Science in 2004. Plans originally called for the construction of a new teaching hospital in coordination with Boca Raton Community Hospital on the main campus. Following successive budgets deficits in 2007, the hospital delayed its participation indefinitely. However, Florida Atlantic later established its own College of Medicine in 2010. The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution (HBOI) also joined the university in 2007, creating Florida Atlantic&#x27;s seventh campus. To bring HBOI into the university family the Florida Legislature allocated $44 million to Florida Atlantic to acquire the institution.

Florida Atlantic has changed dramatically since its opening in 1964. There are now more than 30,000 students attending classes on seven campuses spread across 120 miles (193 km). The university consists of ten colleges and employs more than 3,200 faculty and staff. As of 2020, the university&#x27;s endowment has increased to over $240 million.

Since its founding, the university has been led by seven presidents. The university&#x27;s immediate past president is Mary Jane Saunders. She was named president on March 3, 2010, then resigned on May 15, 2013. Her appointment followed the resignation of Frank Brogan. Brogan, a former Lieutenant Governor of Florida, left the university in late 2009 to become Chancellor of the State University System of Florida. Past university presidents also included Anthony J. Catanese, Helen Popovich, Glenwood Creech, and Kenneth Rast Williams. On January 17, 2014, the Board of Trustees announced the selection of John W. Kelly, formerly a vice president of Clemson University, to be the seventh president of the university with a starting date of March 1, 2014.

==Academics==

As of 2021, the university&#x27;s student body consists of 24,663 undergraduates, 3,380 graduate students, 440 doctoral students, and 254 medical students. In 2021, the undergraduate student body consisted 61% ethnic minorities and includes students from more than 180 countries. Florida Atlantic has long ranked as the most racially, ethnically and culturally diverse institution in Florida&#x27;s State University System. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; has ranked FAU the 27th most diverse university in the nation. For the incoming freshman class of fall 2021, the acceptance rate was 60%.

The university has ten colleges which altogether offer over 180 different bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral degree programs: the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science, Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, College of Social Work and Criminal Justice, College of Business, College of Education, College of Engineering and Computer Science, Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters, Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College, and the Graduate College.

The university offers two honors options: the Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College and a University Scholars Program. The Wilkes Honors College is located on the John D. MacArthur campus in Jupiter, Florida. It offers a liberal arts education in the platform of a public university, yet is comparable to a private liberal arts college. The Boca Raton campus houses the University Scholars Program, which offers special honors seminars, forums, courses, and advanced course substitution for freshmen.

The fall 2021 incoming freshmen profile for the middle 50% was a 3.73–4.33 high school GPA, a 23–29 ACT composite score, and a 1100–1270 SAT total score. Additional admission requirements are needed for the Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College, the School of Architecture, the College of Engineering and Computer Science, and the College of Science.

The average class size at FAU for undergraduates is 33 students, and for graduate classes, 12 students. The student-to-faculty ratio is 20:1. The top three undergraduate majors by enrollment are elementary education, accounting, and management, respectively. The top three graduate majors by enrollment are business administration, educational leadership, and accounting, respectively. The average age for first-year students is 18; however, the average age for all undergraduates is 24 and the average age for graduate students is 33. The average 4-year graduation rate in 2021 was 47.5%.

Enrichment opportunities include internships, hands-on research, study abroad experiences, and 310 clubs and campus organizations. The Lifelong Learning Society operates programs that serve the educational interests of more than 19,000 senior citizens by providing classes focusing on subjects of specific interest, and audit options for regular university classes. Under the university&#x27;s Commercial Music Program, Hoot/Wisdom Recordings was created in 2002, enabling students to work in all creative and business aspects of the music industry. This program generated music that landed a Top 10 spot on the Billboard&#x27;s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles Sales Chart during its first week of release. The university provides financial education using its computer lab. A second lab provides full audio/visual connectivity and additional workstations. Florida Atlantic allows local financial businesses to use its computer labs and facilities for training.

===Research===
FAU is classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as a research university with very high research activity. The university has established notable partnerships with major research institutions such as the Scripps Research Institute, the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies, and the Max Planck Society.

The university is the home of two centers of excellence: the Center of Excellence in Biomedical and Marine Biotechnology and the Center for Ocean Energy Technology. These centers have been selected by Florida&#x27;s Emerging Technology Commission to receive grants to continue and increase their operations. FAU beat out some of Florida&#x27;s top research universities, including the University of Florida and Florida State University, for the initial funding from the state.

Since receiving its startup funding, Florida Atlantic has secured additional funds from other sources, including federal and private research grants. As a result, both centers have engaged in academic and industry partnerships, combining expertise in ocean engineering, marine biotechnology, functional genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics. Researchers, scientists, and students at the centers are designing technologies to explore the sea, harvest renewable energy, discover new medicines, and develop new therapeutics to combat agents of bioterrorism. As a result of this research, in 2007 the university and Lockheed Martin announced an exclusive licensing agreement to develop and produce a rapidly deployable and autonomous mooring buoy system for military and scientific uses.

In 2010, the United States Department of Energy designated FAU as one of three national centers for ocean energy research and development. The Southeast National Marine Renewable Energy Center joins centers in the Pacific Northwest (University of Washington and Oregon State University) and in Hawaii (University of Hawaii). The Southeast National Marine Renewable Energy Center is undertaking research and development of technologies capable of generating renewable power from ocean currents and ocean thermal energy.

The university houses both an Imaging Technology Center and a NASA Imaging Technology Space Center. Located in the College of Engineering and Computer Science, the centers specialize in digital imaging research and development for use in both government and commercial applications in the areas of medical technology, surveillance, communications, education, inspection, scientific observation, manufacturing, visual recognition and identification, and motion picture and digital video. The Florida Atlantic Imaging Technology Center is developing a curriculum for digital imaging and processing, thereby establishing Florida Atlantic as the only university in the nation to offer this technical concentration. The NASA Imaging Technology Center is one of 12 NASA Research Partnership Centers throughout the nation which develop dual-use research and development with the participation of NASA and other related industries in the US. The center occupies two sets of laboratories and administrative offices, one on Florida Atlantic&#x27;s main campus in Boca Raton, the other at the Fort Lauderdale campus.

FAU is affiliated to the Research Park at Florida Atlantic University, with properties in Deerfield Beach and Boca Raton. The Research Park provides outside research facilities for companies which enable them to interact with the university community and its facilities, resources, and expertise. The Research Park operates the Technology Business Incubator; which fosters the start-up and growth of technology-based businesses, seeking to scale them and build relationships for them with the university. The Boca Raton campus is also home to the Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences.

===Palm Beach County campuses===

====Boca Raton====
FAU&#x27;s main campus in Boca Raton was established on the remnants of a World War II American Army airbase in 1964. Spanning 850 acres (3.5 km2), the site is located between the cities of Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale. The campus was designated a burrowing owl sanctuary in 1971 by the Audubon Society. The owls find the campus appealing because there are few predators, due to the university&#x27;s proximity to the Boca Raton Airport, and because the campus was originally cleared of vegetation when operating as an airbase during World War II. &quot;The feisty bird, traditionally associated with wisdom and determination, serves as the university&#x27;s mascot.&quot;

The Boca Raton campus is home to a wide variety of university programs and facilities. These facilities are labs and classrooms, housing for students, a 6,000-gallon shark tank for aquatic research, a movie theater, athletic and recreational facilities, and the student-run record label Hoot/Wisdom Recordings. In addition to academic and cultural programs, the campus also houses Florida Atlantic&#x27;s Division I athletics program. The main campus serves approximately 19,077 students, or 70% of the university&#x27;s student body, offering a number of academic programs, activities, and services.

The Boca Raton campus also houses a number of other institutions, including the A. D. Henderson University School, FAU High School, one of Florida Atlantic University&#x27;s Research Parks, and the Lifelong Learning Society.

The campus serves approximately 3,488 students, or 13% of the FAU student body, making it the university&#x27;s second largest campus by enrollment. The campus features a multi-story student union with offices for student government and student organizations, a multipurpose area and student lounge, a bookstore, and cafeteria. The union also contains a student health center that provides medical services and health counseling. Davie is also the home of &quot;environmental research initiatives focused on Everglades restoration.&quot; FAU colleges offering courses at the FAU Davie campus include Social Work and Criminal Justice, Arts and Letters, Business, Education, Nursing, and Science. The campus is located on Broward College&#x27;s Central Campus. Students may enter BC as freshmen and graduate from FAU with undergraduate degrees in over 14 disciplines. More than 315,000 square feet of carefully designed classrooms, laboratories and faculty, staff and student offices are located on this campus along with a shared-use, 112,000 square-foot FAU/BC library designed for the 21st century.

Other support facilities include a shared Childcare Center, a student Wellness Center and a multi-service Student Union. The campus also offers a rich and varied program of student activities provided by the Division of Student Affairs. Students have all of the services they require for career counseling, wellness, testing and evaluation, tutoring, health services, student government and financial aid, among others. Like a small college within a large university, the Davie Campus is seen as a &quot;model&quot; branch campus for the state of Florida and the nation.

====Fort Lauderdale====
The university has two buildings in downtown Fort Lauderdale, both of which are considered part of one Fort Lauderdale campus. The Askew Tower (AT) and the Higher Education Complex (HEC) on Las Olas Boulevard. The campus offers courses in communication, graphic design, architecture, and urban and regional planning. The campus is home to approximately 900 students or 3.2% of the university&#x27;s student body.

===St. Lucie County campuses===

====Fort Pierce–Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution====
In addition to the Treasure Coast Campus, FAU operates a campus in Fort Pierce at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution. Harbor Branch merged with the university in 2007 to become the HBOI at FAU. The Florida Legislature allocated $44 million for the university to acquire the institution and its 600-acre (2.4 km2) campus.

===Former campuses===

====Port St. Lucie–Treasure Coast Campus====
Treasure Coast Campus of Florida Atlantic University operated through a partnership with Indian River State College (IRSC). Florida Atlantic purchased 50 acres (0.2 km2) of land in Port St. Lucie in 1994. At the end of spring 2012 class term, Florida Atlantic University ended offering classes at the Port St. Lucie campus.

==Athletics==

Florida Atlantic&#x27;s 19 varsity sports teams, the Owls, compete in NCAA&#x27;s Division I. The Owls joined Conference USA for the 2013–14 season. The university&#x27;s athletics program began in 1979, when Florida Atlantic first started sponsoring intercollegiate teams. Since then, the university has worked to expand the quality of its intercollegiate program by attracting coaches such as Howard Schnellenberger, Carl Pelini, Matt Doherty, Rex Walters, Lane Kiffin, Mike Jarvis, Dusty May, Willie Taggart, Tom Herman and women&#x27;s softball and golf coach Joan Joyce. The university&#x27;s colors are FAU Blue, FAU Red, and FAU Silver.

On October 21, 2021, Florida Atlantic accepted the invitation to join the American Athletic Conference (AAC) and became a full-member on July 1, 2023.

===Traditions===

FAU is home to a number of sports-related traditions and school spirit organizations.

Every fall before the first football game of the season, FAU&#x27;s Student Government Association sponsors the annual football &quot;Bonfire&quot; where the opposing team&#x27;s mascot is burned in effigy. This event typically includes a concert and a speech by the university&#x27;s head football coach.

Also in football, Florida Atlantic challenges its rival Florida International (FIU) in the annual Shula Bowl. This intercollegiate football game is named after legendary coach Don Shula; so named because at the time of its inception, both head coaches, Florida Atlantic&#x27;s Howard Schnellenberger and Florida International coach Don Strock, had worked under Shula at some point during their careers. Even though both universities have since moved on to new head coaches, the Shula Bowl is still played. As a home game, the competition takes place at university&#x27;s own stadium; as an away game, the bowl is played at FIU Stadium.

For basketball, Florida Atlantic celebrates the &quot;Red Hot Madness and Stroll Off&quot; pep rally that introduces fans to the team and coaches, host a number of basketball-related contests such as 3-point shoot-outs and slam dunk competitions, and features step performances by the school&#x27;s National Pan-Hellenic Council fraternities and sororities. During the regular season, the &quot;Bury the Burrow in Red&quot; event calls for Florida Atlantic students to wear as much red as possible and fill the Burrow, the university&#x27;s multi-purpose arena, during the annual basketball rivalry game between Florida Atlantic and Florida International University.

The official spirit group supporting Florida Atlantic athletics is the &quot;prOWLers&quot;. The group began in February 2002 to support the men&#x27;s basketball program during the team&#x27;s run for the Atlantic Sun Conference Championship. The group is funded by the Student Alumni Association, and can now be found at most sporting events cheering for Florida Atlantic. The prOWLers are joined by the Owl Rangers, a fan group that paints their bodies in the Florida Atlantic school colors. The hOWLetts are a student club that attend gameday events and assist in recruiting athletes.

Since 2002, Florida Atlantic students have been using Owl Fingers (the &quot;OK&quot; hand sign) to show school pride and wish the athletic teams luck during football point after attempts (PATs) and basketball free throws.

==Student life==

===Residential life===

Residential housing at FAU is available on the Boca Raton and John D. MacArthur campuses. &quot;All full-time freshmen are required to reside in university housing,&quot; however, &quot;exemptions from this policy are made for students who: are 21 or older by the first day of class, reside with parent(s) or legal guardian(s) within a radius of the Boca Raton campus, or are married.&quot; As of 2021, over 4,000 students live on-campus in Boca Raton. The Wilkes Honors College on the MacArthur Campus requires all students live on-campus within its three residence halls, however, exceptions are made for students who are 26 years of age, married, or have dependent children.
Boca Raton&#x27;s on-campus housing facilities are: Indian River Towers (opened 2001), Heritage Park Towers (opened 2004), Glades Park Towers (opened 2007), Parliament Hall (opened 2013), University Village Apartments (UVA), and Innovation Village Apartments (IVA) (opened 2011). Heritage Park and Glades Park Towers each offer 602 beds with 96 single rooms. UVA and IVA exclusively serve upperclassmen while the other residence halls exclusively serve freshmen students. The university also offers upper-division undergraduate and graduate student housing in the Business and Professional Women&#x27;s Scholarship House for women with a strong academic background.

One of the newest residences on the Boca Raton campus is the Innovation Village Apartments (IVA), consisting of two buildings: IVA North and IVA South. It is a 1,200-bed apartment-style housing facility for upperclassmen, graduate, and medical students. It offers amenities that one would find in a high-rise apartment complex: lounges, retail dining, fitness centers, a pool/cabana, a volleyball court, common areas, and more. The facility opened in fall 2011. FAU&#x27;s newest residence hall is Parliament Hall, a lakeside freshmen housing facility offering 614 beds, a fitness center, lounges, retail dining, and views of the nearby Atlantic Ocean from top floors.

Within its existing residential life programs, FAU offers a number of Learning Communities for freshmen and students with similar interests and concentrations. Participants meet people with similar interests, live on the same floor and take courses with others in their community, while receiving additional guidance related to those interests. The university&#x27;s Learning Community programs are divided into two categories, Freshman Learning Communities and Living Learning Communities. The freshman program offers 16 different concentrations, including business, nursing, and education. The Living program offers six concentrations for students residing in the Glades Park Towers dormitory, including engineering, computer science, and a Women&#x27;s Leadership program.

The university&#x27;s Department of Housing and Residential Life and the university&#x27;s fraternities and sororities sponsor a program for freshmen and other students returning to Florida Atlantic in the fall semester. This program, called the &quot;Weeks of Welcome&quot;, spans 11 days and all campuses, and works to acclimate students with university life and to build a good on-campus community. On each day, a number of different events are scheduled, including Hall Wars, which are athletic competitions between dormitories, Luaus, and a number of other events. The Weeks of Welcome is the second largest campus-wide event held by Florida Atlantic.

===Student housing===

===Campus organizations and activities===
FAU has approximately 300 registered student organizations. Among the groups are academic organizations, honor societies, spiritual/religious organizations, diversity-appreciation organizations, service organizations, personal interest organizations, sports clubs, and student government agencies. These clubs and organizations run the gamut from sailing to Ultimate Frisbee, from varsity and club sports and a jazz group to a pottery guild, from political organizations to chess and video game clubs. These organizations are funded by student tuition, from which $12.32 per credit hour goes toward an activities and service fee fund. This generates approximately $10 million per year that is then given to student government for allocation to student clubs and organizations. The student government also finances other student life programs, including career fairs, the &quot;University Press&quot;, OWL TV and Owl Radio, and Homecoming.
Florida Atlantic&#x27;s homecoming, also known as the &quot;Owl Prowl,&quot; is celebrated annually in the fall semester. Events occur mainly on the Boca Raton Campus, but a number of other campuses host their own events as well. In the past, homecoming has had kickoff parties, costumed dances, bonfires, comedy shows, alumni events and dinners, a golf cart parade, and tailgating. Florida Atlantic students have an organized football tailgating area known as the Rat&#x27;s Mouth. The name references the Spanish translation of Boca Raton.

FAU completed an $18.6 million Recreation and Wellness Center in spring 2010. The facility houses an outdoor leisure and lap pool, a cardio equipment and free weight room, two multipurpose rooms, three indoor courts and health club-style locker rooms. In 2011, the facility won the NIRSA Outstanding Sports Facilities Award. Other recreation facilities include a $4.2 million track and field complex, with synthetic turf (opened January 2007), a ropes challenge course and the 6.5 acre Henderson Fields, utilized most often by the FAU Intramural Sports and Club Sports programs.

===Greek life===
FAU is home to approximately 28 chapters of national fraternities and sororities, encompassing approximately 1,077 members or 5% of the undergraduate population. The highpoint of Greek life at Florida Atlantic is &quot;Greek Week&quot;. This event is held annually during the spring semester and showcases a number of themed competitions between the university&#x27;s Greek organizations. There are currently no on-campus Greek houses. However, a Greek Life Housing task force has been formed to explore various housing models, including the cost of construction, &quot;and make recommendations on how to improve the overall quality of the Greek housing...&quot;

==Alumni==

<text>Andrew Russell Paulley (November 3, 1909 – May 19, 1984) was a Canadian politician. He served as leader of the Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation from 1959 to 1961, and its successor, the New Democratic Party of Manitoba, from 1961 to 1969.

The son of Frederick Henry Paulley and Elizabeth Mary Partington, originally from Cerne Abbas, Dorset. Paulley was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba and was educated in the city. In 1938, he married Mary Alice Sinclair. He moved to the suburb of Transcona and worked as a foreman upholsterer for the Canadian National Railway. Paulley served as mayor of Transcona from 1946 to 1949 and from 1952 to 1953. He also became a Freemason, and was involved in the province&#x27;s socialist politics.

Paulley was a CCF candidate for St. Boniface in the federal election of 1949, finishing a distant second to Liberal Fernand Viau. He turned to provincial politics for the 1953 provincial election, and was elected for the riding of Kildonan—Transcona. After redistribution, he was re-elected for Radisson in 1958 and 1959.

CCF leader Lloyd Stinson lost his seat in the 1959 election, and Paulley was selected as interim leader in his place. In 1960, he was confirmed at a party convention as Stinson&#x27;s permanent replacement. Like all previous CCF and ILP leaders in Manitoba, he was elected without opposition.

The late 1950s was a period of transformation for the Manitoba CCF, as the federal party was in the process of merging with the Canadian Labour Congress to create the New Democratic Party. There was no strong opposition to the change in Manitoba, and the provincial CCF formally dissolved itself in 1961 to be succeeded by the New Democratic Party of Manitoba. On November 4, 1961, Paulley defeated Cliff Matthews and Hans Fries at a delegated convention to become the new party&#x27;s leader.

The elections of 1962 and 1966 were disappointments for the Manitoba NDP. In the late 1950s, the CCF under Lloyd Stinson had made modest increases from its previous standing, and some party members believed that the NDP was well-positioned to replace the Liberals as the main opposition to Dufferin Roblin&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government.

This did not occur. Roblin&#x27;s government was fairly progressive, and won the support of many centre-left voters. Roblin was also a more popular figure than Paulley on a personal level. The Liberals, for their part, still had a support base in the province&#x27;s rural and francophone communities, and were also able to win a few Winnipeg-area seats. The NDP fell from ten seats to seven in 1962. It recovered to eleven seats in 1966, but was still relegated to third-party status.

Paulley, who was re-elected on both occasions, faced increased opposition from a &quot;modernizing&quot; wing within the party. There was a growing belief among NDP Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) that Paulley, while a good representative of labour interests, could not lead the party to victory at the polls. In 1968, he faced a leadership challenge from MLA Sidney Green, a labour lawyer from the riding of Inkster in north-end Winnipeg.

The contest between Paulley and Green exposed a number of divisions within the Manitoba NDP. Green claimed (probably correctly) that he was not challenging Paulley on ideological grounds, but his campaign was nevertheless depicted by some as &quot;radical left&quot;. Paulley, in turn, was depicted as representing an &quot;old labourite&quot; demographic, unable to reach out to a younger voters or communities which had not previously supported the CCF and NDP.

Paulley fended off Green&#x27;s challenge by unusual means. During the campaign, eight NDP MLAs signed a letter calling for Paulley to be re-elected such that he could stand aside for Edward Schreyer the following year. Paulley responded to this endorsement by claiming that he had long regarded Schreyer as the best choice to be his successor, though he was somewhat ambiguous as to whether he would actually resign if re-elected.

At the 1968 leadership convention, Paulley received 213 votes to Green&#x27;s 168. Despite making a half-hearted attempt to retain power, he resigned as leader the following year and Ed Schreyer ran to replace him. Schreyer defeated Green by 506 votes to 177 in the leadership race held shortly thereafter.

Under Schreyer&#x27;s leadership, the NDP won an upset victory in the election of 1969. Paulley was re-elected in Transcona, and was sworn in as Minister of Labour and Railway Commissioner on July 15, 1969. He also became Minister of Government Services on December 18, holding his position until September 3, 1970. He stepped down as Railway Commissioner on February 16, 1973, though continuing to hold the Labour portfolio. He was the Deputy Premier of Manitoba from c1973 to 1977.

Paulley was one of several MLAs in the Winnipeg area to be targeted by a conservative &quot;citizen&#x27;s group&quot; in the election of 1973. The group in question convinced the Progressive Conservative and Liberal parties to avoid competing against each other in certain ridings, such that a single &quot;anti-socialist&quot; candidate could be offered. Facing Tory Phil Rizzuto as his only opponent, Paulley nevertheless won re-election by 6275 votes to 4151.

Paulley continued to serve as Minister of Labour throughout the second Schreyer government, also taking responsibility for the Civil Service Superannuation Act and Public Servants Insurance Act, and (after September 22, 1976) the Pension Benefits Act. He did not seek re-election in 1977, and did not play a significant role in public life following his retirement.

Paulley died on May 19, 1984.

<text>Country Harbour (formerly named Mocodome) is a rural community in Guysborough County, Nova Scotia, Canada. The community is situated on a large deep natural harbour of the same name and is located along the province&#x27;s Eastern Shore close to Canso, Nova Scotia.

Country Harbour has several districts along Route 316:

* Country Harbour Lake
* Cross Roads Country Harbour
* Middle Country Harbour
* Country Harbour Mines

The entire population of the area is less than 1,000 permanent residents.

==History==

Country Harbour was reportedly considered by British colonial authorities for the provincial capital and military base that was ultimately sited at Halifax. There are several sites dedicated to preserving the heritage of the early European settlers, including a restoration of a small village (probably home to less than 20 families) and Mount Misery.

Mount Misery was an early agricultural community which was renowned for its harsh winter conditions, resulting in the death of almost all original settlers within their first year of emigration. Mount Misery is connected to Country Harbour Mines via a cable ferry operated by the provincial Department of Transportation and Public Works, providing convenient access to the neighbouring community of Port Bickerton.

===Attack at Country Harbour===

During Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War, on February 21, 1753, nine Mi&#x27;kmaq from present-day Antigonish (Nartigouneche) in canoes attacked an English vessel from Canso, Nova Scotia which had a crew of four at Country Harbour, Nova Scotia. The Mi&#x27;kmaq fired on them and drove them toward the shore. Other natives joined in and boarded the schooner, forcing them to run their vessel into an inlet. The two English men witnessed the Mi&#x27;kmaq kill and scalp two of their crew. The Mi&#x27;kmaq killed two English men and took two others captive for seven weeks. After seven weeks in captivity, on April 8, the two English men killed six Mi&#x27;kmaq and managed to escape.

In response, on the night of April 21, Jean-Baptiste Cope and the Mi&#x27;kmaq attacked another 10 crew English schooner in a naval battle between Outique Island and Isle Madame in which the Mi&#x27;kmaq attacked an English schooner. There were nine English men and one Acadian who was the British interpreter. The Mi&#x27;kmaq killed the English and let the Acadian named Anthony Casteel off at Port Toulouse, where the Mi&#x27;kmaq sank the schooner after looting it. Despite the collapse of peace on the eastern shore, the British did not formally renounce the Treaty of 1752 until 1756.

==Economy==
Traditional industries have included mining, forestry and fishing. Many residents have established their fishing businesses in Port Bickerton due to the geographic advantages provided by that port, however several deep-sea fishing vessels use Country Harbour for transferring their cargo to land-based transport.

Country Harbour once had an extensive gold mining industry. However, the last serious attempt at mining this resource took place in the early 1980s with the opening of the Forest Hills Gold Mine. Nothing of significant value was recovered from this operation, and it closed after several years.

In neighbouring Goldboro, the Sable Offshore Energy Project pipeline comes ashore from natural gas fields 200 km offshore at Sable Island. There, a gas liquids separation plant operates which sends gas liquids on a pipeline to a plant at Point Tupper and the Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline carries the pure natural gas westward to markets in the Maritimes and New England.

Country Harbour has few significant employment opportunities aside from the traditional primary resource industries. Many residents tend to commute to Antigonish or even as far as New Glasgow, Port Hawkesbury and Halifax for employment, however the majority of the community is retirees.

The area is within the district of Guysborough but is served by St. Mary&#x27;s Education Centre and St. Mary&#x27;s Academy in nearby Sherbrooke.

<doc id="880215" wikidata="Q632920" url="?curid=880215" title="Alex Rae (footballer, born 1969)">
<text>Alexander Scott Rae (born 30 September 1969) is a Scottish professional football manager and former player who played as a midfielder. He is a first-team coach at Rangers.

Rae began his youth career at Rangers and started his senior career at Falkirk. Rae played for Millwall, Sunderland, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Rangers, Dundee, Milton Keynes Dons. Back from rehab clinic for alcoholism in 1998, he was with Sunderland and played regularly in the top flight until September 2001. He then joined Wolverhampton Wanderers, and quickly became the key player in the team, winning the fans&#x27;s player of the season award. In 2003, he helped the team back into the Premier League, and had his best seasonal tally with 8 goals. He then went back to Scotland, joining Rangers where he had started his youth career, in May 2004, and won the league title in his first season.

Rae was appointed player-manager of Dundee in May 2006. He led the club to third place in the First Division in his first season and took them a place higher in his second. He stopped his career as a footballer during the 2008–2009 season and went to Sweden as part of his work towards a UEFA Pro Licence.

==Playing career==
Rae was born in Glasgow. He started his career as a youngster at boyhood heroes Rangers but was rejected by boss Graeme Souness. He dropped down to junior leagues with Bishopbriggs before he joined Falkirk and enjoyed a successful two years before heading south to sign for Millwall in 1990 for £100,000. He made his Millwall debut on 25 August 1990 and played for the club for six years. While at the club he would go on to become one of Millwall&#x27;s highest goalscorers, with 71 goals in all competitions. His form for Millwall earned him a big money move to Premier League Sunderland for £1 million in 1996, where he established himself as a crowd-pleasing, combative midfielder. His career took a downturn though, as he descended into alcoholism, leading to him attending a rehab clinic during 1998. He stayed sober after this treatment and further rehabilitation, and later became a patron for the Sporting Chance clinic.

Back on the field, he won promotion as champions back to the Premier League with Sunderland in 1998–99 and played regularly in the top flight. By 2001, he had dropped out of manager Peter Reid&#x27;s plans and was sold to Wolverhampton Wanderers in September 2001, for £1.2 million. He quickly became an important player for Wolves, winning the fans&#x27; player of the season award in his first campaign. The following year, he helped them back into the Premier League when they won the play-offs in 2003. He had a strong year in the top flight, finishing as the club&#x27;s leading scorer with eight goals – his best-ever seasonal tally – but could not prevent the club&#x27;s relegation. Rae re-signed for Rangers in May 2004, and won the league title in his first season, scoring once in the process against Dunfermline. He only featured 12 times in his second season, however, and was later released by the club.

==Coaching and managerial career==
Rae was appointed player-manager of Dundee on 24 May 2006. He led the club to third place in the First Division in his first season and took them a place higher in his second. He gave up playing for the 2008–09 season but was sacked on 20 October 2008 with the team in eighth place in the league. Following this, Rae travelled to Sweden as part of his work towards a UEFA Pro Licence.

In July 2009 he joined MK Dons, on a temporary basis with a view to a permanent deal, as first team coach working under his former Wolves teammate Paul Ince.

In 2010, Rae made a return to competitive football to cover for injuries. On 29 October 2010, Rae joined Notts County as assistant manager, but he left the club following the departure of manager Paul Ince on 3 April 2011.

In February 2013, Rae joined Blackpool, once again with Paul Ince. The season finished with Blackpool in 15th place.

On 21 January 2014, along with Paul Ince, Rae&#x27;s Blackpool contract was terminated and he left the club. In August 2014 he became assistant manager at Belgian club KRC Genk, working with Alex McLeish.

Rae was appointed manager of Scottish Championship side St Mirren in December 2015, after former manager Ian Murray resigned. After an unsuccessful start to the 2016–17 season, Rae and his assistant David Farrell were sacked by the club.

Rae became assistant to Paul Ince at Reading in February 2022. On 11 April 2023, Rae and Ince were sacked by Reading. On 1 October 2023, Rae joined Scottish Premiership side Rangers as a first-team coach after the sacking of manager Michael Beale.

<text>John Raymond Christy is a climate scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) whose chief interests are satellite remote sensing of global climate and global climate change. He is best known, jointly with Roy Spencer, for the first successful development of a satellite temperature record.

==Early life and education==
A native of Fresno, California, Christy became interested in the weather when he was a child. He became curious why the weather in the San Joaquin Valley was so different from that of the Sierra Mountains. He has recalled that &quot;I built my first climate datasets when I was 12, using a mechanical pencil, graph paper, and long-division (no calculators back then.) I&#x27;ve been a climate nerd ever since.&quot; He received a BA in mathematics from California State University, Fresno in 1973, and an MS and PhD in atmospheric sciences from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1984 and 1987. His doctoral thesis was titled, &quot;An investigation of the general circulation associated with extreme anomalies in hemispheric mean atmospheric mass&quot;.

Prior to his scientific career, Christy taught physics and chemistry as a missionary teacher in Nyeri, Kenya from 1973 to 1975. After earning a Master of Divinity degree from Golden Gate Baptist Seminary in 1978 he served four years as a bivocational mission-pastor in Vermillion, South Dakota, where he also taught college math.

==Career==
He is the distinguished professor of atmospheric science and director of the Earth System Science Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). He was appointed Alabama&#x27;s state climatologist in 2000. For his development of a global temperature data set from satellites, he was awarded NASA&#x27;s Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement and the American Meteorological Society&#x27;s &quot;Special Award.&quot; In 2002, Christy was elected Fellow of the American Meteorological Society.

===Satellite temperature record===

Since 1989 Christy, along with Roy Spencer, has maintained an atmospheric temperature record derived from satellite microwave sounding unit measurements (see: satellite temperature record). This was once quite controversial: From the beginning of the satellite record in late 1978 into 1998 it showed a net global cooling trend, although ground measurements and instruments carried aloft by balloons showed warming in many areas. Part of the cooling trend seen by the satellites can be attributed to several years of cooler than normal temperatures and cooling caused by the eruption of the Mount Pinatubo volcano. Part of the discrepancy between the surface and atmospheric trends was resolved over a period of several years as Christy, Spencer and others identified several factors, including orbital drift and decay, that caused a net cooling bias in the data collected by the satellite instruments. Since the data correction of August 1998 (and the major La Niña Pacific Ocean warming event of the same year), data collected by satellite instruments have shown an average global warming trend in the atmosphere. From November 1978 through March 2011, Earth&#x27;s atmosphere has warmed at an average rate of about 0.14 C per decade, according to the UAH satellite record.

Christy was a lead author of a section of the 2001 report by the IPCC and the U.S. CCSP report &quot;Temperature Trends in the Lower Atmosphere – Understanding and Reconciling Differences&quot;. Christy also signed the 2003 American Geophysical Union statement on climate change.

Christy has also performed detailed reconstruction of surface temperature for Central California. He found that recorded temperature changes there were consistent with an altered surface environment caused by increased irrigation for agriculture, which changed &quot;a high-albedo desert into a darker, moister, vegetated plain.&quot;

==Views==
In a 2003 interview with National Public Radio about the 2003 American Geophysical Union (AGU) statement, he said he is &quot;a strong critic of scientists who make catastrophic predictions of huge increases in global temperatures and tremendous rises in sea levels&quot;. He added, though, that &quot;it is scientifically inconceivable that after changing forests into cities, turning millions of acres into irrigated farmland, putting massive quantities of soot and dust into the air, and putting extra greenhouse gases into the air, that the natural course of climate has not changed in some way.&quot;

In a 2009 interview with &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine about signing the 2003 American Geophysical Union (AGU) statement, he said: &quot;As far as the AGU, I thought that was a fine statement because it did not put forth a magnitude of the warming. We just said that human effects have a warming influence, and that&#x27;s certainly true. There was nothing about disaster or catastrophe. In fact, I was very upset about the latest AGU statement [in 2007]. It was about alarmist as you can get.&quot;

In a 2007 editorial in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, he wrote: &quot;I&#x27;m sure the majority (but not all) of my IPCC colleagues cringe when I say this, but I see neither the developing catastrophe nor the smoking gun proving that human activity is to blame for most of the warming we see.&quot;

In a 2009 written testimony to the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, he wrote: &quot;From my analysis, the actions being considered to &#x27;stop global warming&#x27; will have an imperceptible impact on whatever the climate will do, while making energy more expensive, and thus have a negative impact on the economy as a whole. We have found that climate models and popular surface temperature data sets overstate the changes in the real atmosphere and that actual changes are not alarming.&quot;

In 2014, Christy and his UAH colleague Richard McNider wrote an op-ed in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, arguing that climate models projected temperatures consistently higher than real-world satellite and balloon data. The authors also pointed to past instances where scientific consensus turned out to be incorrect.

<doc id="880234" wikidata="Q2425705" url="?curid=880234" title="Galway Kinnell">
<text>Galway Mills Kinnell (February 1, 1927 – October 28, 2014) was an American poet. His dark poetry emphasized scenes and experiences in threatening, ego-less natural environments. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for his 1982 collection, &quot;Selected Poems&quot; and split the National Book Award for Poetry with Charles Wright. From 1989 to 1993, he was poet laureate for the state of Vermont.

Although exploring arguably darker themes, Kinnell has been regarded as being in line with Walt Whitman in his rejection of the idea of seeking personal fulfillment by escaping into the imaginary world. His most celebrated and commonly anthologized poems include the poem cycle &quot;The Book of Nightmares&quot;, as well as &quot;St. Francis and the Sow&quot;, &quot;After Making Love We Hear Footsteps&quot;, and &quot;Wait&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Kinnell said that as a youth he became interested in the poetry of American dark Romantics such as Edgar Allan Poe and Emily Dickinson, drawn to both the musical appeal of their poetry and the allure of their use of language which spoke to what he later described as the homogeneous feel of his hometown, Pawtucket, Rhode Island. He also described himself as being an introvert in his adolescence, which scholars have compared to the aforementioned authors&#x27; histories of leading solitary lives.

Kinnell attended Wilbraham &amp; Monson Academy in Wilbraham, Massachusetts and graduated in 1944. After graduating from the academy, he studied at Princeton University, graduating in 1948 alongside friend and fellow poet W.S. Merwin. He received his master of arts degree from the University of Rochester. He traveled extensively in Europe and the Middle East, and went to Paris on a Fulbright Fellowship. During the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement in the United States caught his attention. Upon returning to the US, he joined CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) and worked on voter registration and workplace integration in Hammond, Louisiana. This effort got him arrested. In 1968, he signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. Alongside other personal themes and anxieties, Kinnell drew upon both his involvement with the civil rights movement and his experiences protesting against the Vietnam War in his 1971 poem cycle &quot;The Book of Nightmares&quot;.

Kinnell has been published in Beloit Poetry Journal. From 1989 to 1993 he was poet laureate for the state of Vermont.

Kinnell was the Erich Maria Remarque Professor of Creative Writing at New York University and a Chancellor of the American Academy of Poets. As of 2011 he was retired and resided at his home in Vermont until his death in October 2014 from leukemia.

==Work==
While much of Kinnell&#x27;s work has been regarded as dealing with social issues, it is by no means confined to one subject. Some critics have pointed to the spiritual dimensions of his poetry, as well as the natural imagery present throughout his work. For instance, &quot;The Fundamental Project of Technology&quot; deals with all three of those elements, creating an eerie, chant-like and surreal exploration of the horrors atomic weapons inflict on humanity and nature. Kinnell occasionally utilized simple and brutal images (&quot;Lieutenant! / This corpse will not stop burning!&quot; from &quot;The Dead Shall be Raised Incorruptible&quot; in &quot;The Book of Nightmares&quot;) to convey his anger at the destructiveness of humanity, informed by his activism and love of nature. Scholars have also identified, on the contrary, themes of optimism and beauty in his use of language, especially in the large role animals and children have in his later work, evident in poems such as &quot;Daybreak&quot; and &quot;After Making Love We Hear Footsteps&quot;.

In addition to his works of poetry and his translations, Kinnell published one novel (&quot;Black Light&quot;, 1966) and one children&#x27;s book (&quot;How the Alligator Missed Breakfast&quot;, 1982).

Kinnell wrote two elegies for his close friend, the poet James Wright, upon the latter&#x27;s death in 1980. They appear in &quot;From the Other World: Poems in Memory of James Wright&quot;.

Kinnell&#x27;s poem &quot;The Correspondence-School Instructor Says Goodbye to His Poetry Students&quot; was excerpted in Delia Owens’ novel &quot;Where the Crawdads Sing&quot;, as a goodbye note left by the protagonist’s mother who left her at a young age.

== Personal ==
Kinnell married Inés Delgado de Torres, a Spanish translator, in 1965 — naming their two children, Fergus and Maud, after figures in Yeats. They divorced after 20 years of marriage. He married Barbara Kammer Bristol in 1997. He had two grandchildren.

== Death ==
Kinnell died October 28, 2014, at his home in Sheffield, Vermont, at the age of 87. The cause was leukemia according to his wife, Barbara K. Bristol.

<text>In geometry, an envelope of a planar family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point, and these points of tangency together form the whole envelope. Classically, a point on the envelope can be thought of as the intersection of two &quot;infinitesimally adjacent&quot; curves, meaning the limit of intersections of nearby curves. This idea can be generalized to an envelope of surfaces in space, and so on to higher dimensions.

To have an envelope, it is necessary that the individual members of the family of curves are differentiable curves as the concept of tangency does not apply otherwise, and there has to be a smooth transition proceeding through the members. But these conditions are not sufficient – a given family may fail to have an envelope. A simple example of this is given by a family of concentric circles of expanding radius.

==Envelope of a family of curves==
Let each curve &quot;C&quot;&quot;t&quot; in the family be given as the solution of an equation &quot;f&quot;&quot;t&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;)=0 (see implicit curve), where &quot;t&quot; is a parameter. Write &quot;F&quot;(&quot;t&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;)=&quot;f&quot;&quot;t&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) and assume &quot;F&quot; is differentiable.

The envelope of the family &quot;C&quot;&quot;t&quot; is then defined as the set formula_1 of points (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) for which, simultaneously, 
:formula_2
for some value of &quot;t&quot;,
where formula_3 is the partial derivative of &quot;F&quot; with respect to &quot;t&quot;.

If &quot;t&quot; and &quot;u&quot;, &quot;t&quot;≠&quot;u&quot; are two values of the parameter then the intersection of the curves &quot;C&quot;&quot;t&quot; and &quot;C&quot;&quot;u&quot; is given by 
:formula_4
or, equivalently,
:formula_5
Letting &quot;u&quot; → &quot;t&quot; gives the definition above.

An important special case is when &quot;F&quot;(&quot;t&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is a polynomial in &quot;t&quot;. This includes, by clearing denominators, the case where &quot;F&quot;(&quot;t&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is a rational function in &quot;t&quot;. In this case, the definition amounts to &quot;t&quot; being a double root of &quot;F&quot;(&quot;t&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), so the equation of the envelope can be found by setting the discriminant of &quot;F&quot; to 0 (because the definition demands F=0 at some t and first derivative =0 i.e. its value 0 and it is min/max at that t).

For example, let &quot;C&quot;&quot;t&quot; be the line whose &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; intercepts are &quot;t&quot; and 11−&quot;t&quot;, this is shown in the animation above. The equation of &quot;C&quot;&quot;t&quot; is
:formula_6
or, clearing fractions,
:formula_7
The equation of the envelope is then
:formula_8

Often when &quot;F&quot; is not a rational function of the parameter it may be reduced to this case by an appropriate substitution. For example, if the family is given by &quot;C&quot;θ with an equation of the form &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;)cos θ+&quot;v&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;)sin θ=&quot;w&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), then putting &quot;t&quot;=&quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot;θ, cos θ=(&quot;t&quot;+1/&quot;t&quot;)/2, sin θ=(&quot;t&quot;-1/&quot;t&quot;)/2&quot;i&quot; changes the equation of the curve to
:formula_9
or
:formula_10
The equation of the envelope is then given by setting the discriminant to 0:
:formula_11
or 
:formula_12

===Alternative definitions===

# The envelope &quot;E&quot;1 is the limit of intersections of nearby curves &quot;C&quot;&quot;t&quot;.
# The envelope &quot;E&quot;2 is a curve tangent to all of the &quot;C&quot;&quot;t&quot;.
# The envelope &quot;E&quot;3 is the boundary of the region filled by the curves &quot;C&quot;&quot;t&quot;.

Then formula_13, formula_14 and formula_15, where formula_1 is the set of points defined at the beginning of this subsection&#x27;s parent section.

==Examples==

===Example 1===
These definitions &quot;E&quot;1, &quot;E&quot;2, and &quot;E&quot;3 of the envelope may be different sets. Consider for instance the curve parametrised by where . The one-parameter family of curves will be given by the tangent lines to γ.

First we calculate the discriminant formula_17. The generating function is
:formula_18
Calculating the partial derivative . It follows that either or . First assume that . Substituting into F: formula_19
and so, assuming that &quot;t&quot; ≠ 0, it follows that if and only if . Next, assuming that and substituting into &quot;F&quot; gives . So, assuming , it follows that if and only if . Thus the discriminant is the original curve and its tangent line at γ(0):
:formula_20

Next we calculate &quot;E&quot;1. One curve is given by and a nearby curve is given by where ε is some very small number. The intersection point comes from looking at the limit of as ε tends to zero. Notice that if and only if
:formula_21
If then &quot;L&quot; has only a single factor of ε. Assuming that then the intersection is given by
:formula_22
Since it follows that . The &quot;y&quot; value is calculated by knowing that this point must lie on a tangent line to the original curve γ: that . Substituting and solving gives &quot;y&quot; = &quot;t&quot;3. When , &quot;L&quot; is divisible by ε2. Assuming that then the intersection is given by
:formula_23
It follows that , and knowing that gives . It follows that
:formula_24

Next we calculate &quot;E&quot;2. The curve itself is the curve that is tangent to all of its own tangent lines. It follows that
:formula_25

Finally we calculate &quot;E&quot;3. Every point in the plane has at least one tangent line to γ passing through it, and so region filled by the tangent lines is the whole plane. The boundary &quot;E&quot;3 is therefore the empty set. Indeed, consider a point in the plane, say (&quot;x&quot;0,&quot;y&quot;0). This point lies on a tangent line if and only if there exists a &quot;t&quot; such that
:formula_26
This is a cubic in &quot;t&quot; and as such has at least one real solution. It follows that at least one tangent line to γ must pass through any given point in the plane. If and then each point (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) has exactly one tangent line to γ passing through it. The same is true if . If and then each point (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) has exactly three distinct tangent lines to γ passing through it. The same is true if and . If and then each point (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) has exactly two tangent lines to γ passing through it (this corresponds to the cubic having one ordinary root and one repeated root). The same is true if and . If and , i.e., , then this point has a single tangent line to γ passing through it (this corresponds to the cubic having one real root of multiplicity 3). It follows that
:formula_27

===Example 2===

In string art it is common to cross-connect two lines of equally spaced pins. What curve is formed?

For simplicity, set the pins on the &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-axes; a non-orthogonal layout is a rotation and scaling away. A general straight-line thread connects the two points (0, &quot;k&quot;−&quot;t&quot;) and (&quot;t&quot;, 0), where &quot;k&quot; is an arbitrary scaling constant, and the family of lines is generated by varying the parameter &quot;t&quot;. From simple geometry, the equation of this straight line is &quot;y&quot; = −(&quot;k&quot; − &quot;t&quot;)&quot;x&quot;/&quot;t&quot; + &quot;k&quot; − &quot;t&quot;. Rearranging and casting in the form &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;t&quot;) = 0 gives:

Now differentiate &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;t&quot;) with respect to &quot;t&quot; and set the result equal to zero, to get

These two equations jointly define the equation of the envelope. From (2) we have:
: formula_28
Substituting this value of &quot;t&quot; into (1) and simplifying gives an equation for the envelope:

Or, rearranging into a more elegant form that shows the symmetry between x and y:

We can take a rotation of the axes where the &quot;b&quot; axis is the line &quot;y=x&quot; oriented northeast and the &quot;a&quot; axis is the line &quot;y&quot;=−&quot;x&quot; oriented southeast. These new axes are related to the original &quot;x-y&quot; axes by and . We obtain, after substitution into (4) and expansion and simplification,

 a^2 + \frac{k}{2\sqrt{2}},&lt;/math&gt;|}}

which is apparently the equation for a parabola with axis along &quot;a&quot;=0, or &quot;y&quot;=&quot;x&quot;.

=== Example 3 ===

Let &quot;I&quot; ⊂ R be an open interval and let γ : &quot;I&quot; → R2 be a smooth plane curve parametrised by arc length. Consider the one-parameter family of normal lines to γ(&quot;I&quot;). A line is normal to γ at γ(&quot;t&quot;) if it passes through γ(&quot;t&quot;) and is perpendicular to the tangent vector to γ at γ(&quot;t&quot;). Let T denote the unit tangent vector to γ and let N denote the unit normal vector. Using a dot to denote the dot product, the generating family for the one-parameter family of normal lines is given by where
:formula_29
Clearly (x − γ)·T = 0 if and only if x − γ is perpendicular to T, or equivalently, if and only if x − γ is parallel to N, or equivalently, if and only if x = γ + λN for some λ ∈ R. It follows that
:formula_30
is exactly the normal line to γ at γ(&quot;t&quot;0). To find the discriminant of &quot;F&quot; we need to compute its partial derivative with respect to &quot;t&quot;:
:formula_31
where κ is the plane curve curvature of γ. It has been seen that &quot;F&quot; = 0 if and only if x - γ = λN for some λ ∈ R. Assuming that &quot;F&quot; = 0 gives
:formula_32
Assuming that κ ≠ 0 it follows that λ = 1/κ and so
:formula_33
This is exactly the evolute of the curve γ.

=== Example 4 ===

The following example shows that in some cases the envelope of a family of curves may be seen as the topologic boundary of a union of sets, whose boundaries are the curves of the envelope. For formula_34 and formula_35 consider the (open) right triangle in a Cartesian plane with vertices formula_36, formula_37 and formula_38
:formula_39
Fix an exponent formula_40, and consider the union of all the triangles formula_41 subjected to the constraint formula_42, that is the open set
:formula_43
To write a Cartesian representation for formula_44, start with any formula_45, formula_46 satisfying formula_42 and any formula_48. The Hölder inequality in formula_49 with respect to the conjugated exponents formula_50 and formula_51 gives:
:formula_52,
with equality if and only if formula_53.
In terms of a union of sets the latter inequality reads: the point formula_54 belongs to the set formula_44, that is, it belongs to some formula_56 with formula_57, if and only if it satisfies
:formula_58
Moreover, the boundary in formula_59 of the set formula_60 is the envelope of the corresponding family of line segments
:formula_61
(that is, the hypotenuses of the triangles), and has Cartesian equation
:formula_62
Notice that, in particular, the value formula_63 gives the arc of parabola of the Example 2, and the value formula_64 (meaning that all hypotenuses are unit length segments) gives the astroid.

===Example 5===

We consider the following example of envelope in motion. Suppose at initial height 0, one casts a projectile into the air with constant initial velocity &quot;v&quot; but different elevation angles θ. Let &quot;x&quot; be the horizontal axis in the motion surface, and let &quot;y&quot; denote the vertical axis. Then the motion gives the following differential dynamical system:
:formula_65
which satisfies four initial conditions:
:formula_66
Here &quot;t&quot; denotes motion time, θ is elevation angle, &quot;g&quot; denotes gravitational acceleration, and &quot;v&quot; is the constant initial speed (not velocity). The solution of the above system can take an implicit form:
:formula_67
To find its envelope equation, one may compute the desired derivative:
:formula_68
By eliminating θ, one may reach the following envelope equation:
:formula_69
Clearly the resulted envelope is also a concave parabola.

==Envelope of a family of surfaces==
A one-parameter family of surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space is given by a set of equations

:formula_70

depending on a real parameter &quot;a&quot;. For example, the tangent planes to a surface along a curve in the surface form such a family.

Two surfaces corresponding to different values &quot;a&quot; and &quot;a&#x27; &quot; intersect in a common curve defined by

:formula_71

In the limit as &quot;a&#x27; &quot; approaches &quot;a&quot;, this curve tends to a curve contained in the surface at &quot;a&quot;

:formula_72

This curve is called the characteristic of the family at &quot;a&quot;. As &quot;a&quot; varies the locus of these characteristic curves defines a surface called the envelope of the family of surfaces.

==Generalisations==

The idea of an envelope of a family of smooth submanifolds follows naturally. In general, if we have a family of submanifolds with codimension &quot;c&quot; then we need to have at least a &quot;c&quot;-parameter family of such submanifolds. For example: a one-parameter family of curves in three-space (&quot;c&quot; = 2) does not, generically, have an envelope.

==Applications==

=== Ordinary differential equations ===
Envelopes are connected to the study of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and in particular singular solutions of ODEs. Consider, for example, the one-parameter family of tangent lines to the parabola &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;2. These are given by the generating family . The zero level set gives the equation of the tangent line to the parabola at the point (&quot;t&quot;0,&quot;t&quot;02). The equation can always be solved for &quot;y&quot; as a function of &quot;x&quot; and so, consider
:formula_73
Substituting
:formula_74
gives the ODE
:formula_75
Not surprisingly &quot;y&quot; = 2&quot;tx&quot; − &quot;t&quot;2 are all solutions to this ODE. However, the envelope of this one-parameter family of lines, which is the parabola &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;2, is also a solution to this ODE. Another famous example is Clairaut&#x27;s equation.

=== Partial differential equations ===
Envelopes can be used to construct more complicated solutions of first order partial differential equations (PDEs) from simpler ones. Let &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;u&quot;,D&quot;u&quot;) = 0 be a first order PDE, where &quot;x&quot; is a variable with values in an open set Ω ⊂ R&quot;n&quot;, &quot;u&quot; is an unknown real-valued function, D&quot;u&quot; is the gradient of &quot;u&quot;, and &quot;F&quot; is a continuously differentiable function that is regular in D&quot;u&quot;. Suppose that &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;;&quot;a&quot;) is an &quot;m&quot;-parameter family of solutions: that is, for each fixed &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;A&quot; ⊂ R&quot;m&quot;, &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;;&quot;a&quot;) is a solution of the differential equation. A new solution of the differential equation can be constructed by first solving (if possible)
:formula_76
for &quot;a&quot; = φ(&quot;x&quot;) as a function of &quot;x&quot;. The envelope of the family of functions {&quot;u&quot;(·,&quot;a&quot;)}&quot;a&quot;∈&quot;A&quot; is defined by
:formula_77
and also solves the differential equation (provided that it exists as a continuously differentiable function).

Geometrically, the graph of &quot;v&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is everywhere tangent to the graph of some member of the family &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;;&quot;a&quot;). Since the differential equation is first order, it only puts a condition on the tangent plane to the graph, so that any function everywhere tangent to a solution must also be a solution. The same idea underlies the solution of a first order equation as an integral of the Monge cone. The Monge cone is a cone field in the R&quot;n&quot;+1 of the (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;u&quot;) variables cut out by the envelope of the tangent spaces to the first order PDE at each point. A solution of the PDE is then an envelope of the cone field.

In Riemannian geometry, if a smooth family of geodesics through a point &quot;P&quot; in a Riemannian manifold has an envelope, then &quot;P&quot; has a conjugate point where any geodesic of the family intersects the envelope. The same is true more generally in the calculus of variations: if a family of extremals to a functional through a given point &quot;P&quot; has an envelope, then a point where an extremal intersects the envelope is a conjugate point to &quot;P&quot;.

=== Caustics ===

In geometrical optics, a caustic is the envelope of a family of light rays. In this picture there is an arc of a circle. The light rays (shown in blue) are coming from a source &quot;at infinity&quot;, and so arrive parallel. When they hit the circular arc the light rays are scattered in different directions according to the law of reflection. When a light ray hits the arc at a point the light will be reflected as though it had been reflected by the arc&#x27;s tangent line at that point. The reflected light rays give a one-parameter family of lines in the plane. The envelope of these lines is the reflective caustic. A reflective caustic will generically consist of smooth points and ordinary cusp points.

From the point of view of the calculus of variations, Fermat&#x27;s principle (in its modern form) implies that light rays are the extremals for the length functional
:formula_78
among smooth curves γ on [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] with fixed endpoints γ(&quot;a&quot;) and γ(&quot;b&quot;). The caustic determined by a given point &quot;P&quot; (in the image the point is at infinity) is the set of conjugate points to &quot;P&quot;.

===Huygens&#x27;s principle===
Light may pass through anisotropic inhomogeneous media at different rates depending on the direction and starting position of a light ray. The boundary of the set of points to which light can travel from a given point q after a time &quot;t&quot; is known as the wave front after time &quot;t&quot;, denoted here by Φq(&quot;t&quot;). It consists of precisely the points that can be reached from q in time &quot;t&quot; by travelling at the speed of light. Huygens&#x27;s principle asserts that the wave front set is the envelope of the family of wave fronts for q ∈ Φq0(&quot;t&quot;). More generally, the point q0 could be replaced by any curve, surface or closed set in space.

<text>The Chevrolet Stovebolt engine is a straight-six engine made in two versions between 1929 and 1962 by the Chevrolet Division of General Motors. It replaced the company&#x27;s inline-four as their sole engine offering from 1929 through 1954, and was the company&#x27;s base engine starting in 1955 when it added the small block V8 to the lineup. It was completely phased out in North America by 1962, but GM continued to build it in Brazil until 1979. It was replaced by the Chevrolet Turbo-Thrift engine.

==First generation: 1929–1936==
===&quot;A six for the price of a four&quot; ===
The new six-cylinder engine was introduced in 1929 Chevrolet cars and trucks, replacing the company&#x27;s first inline-four. The 1927 Chevrolet Series AA Capitol had sold very well—over a million units sold as compared to about 400,000 of Ford&#x27;s Model T—but Ford had introduced a new model in the autumn of 1927: the Model A. The Model A, with its improved four-cylinder, compared favourably to the Series AA Capitol, and sales of the Model A surpassed Chevrolet by 1929. Chevrolet had been considering switching to a six-cylinder engine since 1925, and the ascendency of the Model A precipitated the switch. Chevrolet had long been known for its &quot;valve-in-head&quot; design in the previous four-cylinder engine, so General Manager William S. Knudsen and marketing executive Richard Grant insisted that the new six-cylinder design also use overhead valves. The new engine was mockingly called the &quot;Cast-Iron Wonder&quot; and &quot;Stovebolt Six&quot; for its seemingly old-fashioned design, but it was famously advertised as &quot;a six for the price of a four&quot; to great success: the Chevrolet was priced only $100 more than the Model A, and the brand regained the sales lead from Ford in 1931.

===194===
When introduced in 1929 the six-cylinder was in size and produced . This engine used a forged steel crankshaft with three main bearings and cast-iron pistons. Bore and stroke were .

A balanced crankshaft was introduced for 1932, while a higher (5.2:1) compression ratio increased output to .

This engine was used in all Chevrolet passenger cars from 1929 through 1932.

Applications:
* 1929 Chevrolet Series AC International - @ 2600 rpm, @ 1000 rpm
* 1930 Chevrolet Series AD Universal - @ 2600 rpm, @ 900 rpm
* 1931 Chevrolet Series AE Independence - @ 2600 rpm, @ 800 rpm
* 1932 Chevrolet Series BA Confederate - @ 3000 rpm, @ 800-2000 rpm

===207===

The original 194 CID engine was replaced with an improved variant (the stroke was increased to ) in 1933, introduced in the Series CA Eagle. This newly revised engine put out , and was produced until 1936, with compression rates between 5.2:1 to 6:1.

Toyota&#x27;s first engine, the Type A, produced from 1935 to 1947, was a reverse engineered copy of the 207 Chevrolet engine, with 62 hp (46 kW) power output and 94 percent of the compression ratio of the Chevrolet original.

Applications:
* 1933 Chevrolet Series CA Eagle / Master - @ 2800 rpm, @ 1000-1800 rpm
* 1933 Chevrolet Series CB/OA/OB/OC/OD Commercial Utility - @ 2750 rpm, @ 1000 rpm
* 1934 Chevrolet Series DA Master - @ 3300 rpm, @ 800-2200 rpm
* 1934 Chevrolet Series DB/PA/PB/PC/PD Commercial Utility - @ 3000 rpm, @ 1000 rpm
* 1935 Chevrolet Series EA/ED Master - @ 3200 rpm, @ 1000-2000 rpm
* 1935 Chevrolet Series EB/QA/QB/QC/QD Commercial Utility - @ 3200 rpm, @ 1000-1400 rpm
* 1935 Chevrolet Series EC Standard - @ 3200 rpm, @ 1000-2000 rpm
* 1936 Chevrolet passenger cars - @ 3200 rpm, @ 900-2000 rpm
* 1936 Chevrolet trucks - @ 3200 rpm, @ 900-1500 rpm

===181===
A version with a bore and stroke was also introduced in 1933, in the lower priced Series CC Standard, and used again in the 1934 Series DC Standard. It made a peak at 2300 rpm, and peak torque of at 1200-2000 rpm. The compression ratio in the 1933 model was 5.2:1, and was increased to 5.35:1 in 1934. Production of this version ended after 1934, and the Standard used the 206.8 cubic inch engine thereafter.

==Second generation: 1937–1962==

The Stovebolt engine was significantly re-engineered for the 1937 model year, distinguished from the earlier 1929-1936 engines by having a redesigned crankcase with four main bearings in lieu of the older engine&#x27;s three bearings. It is often known as the &quot;Blue Flame&quot; engine, although that name was only officially applied beginning in 1953, and then only for the 235ci version coupled to the &quot;Powerglide&quot; automatic transmission (including in the Corvette).

===216===
This engine had a displacement with a bore and stroke of . A four-bearing crankshaft was added, along with 6.5:1 compression pistons, for . A new cylinder head in 1941 increased output to , and 6.6:1 compression gave the 1949 model . This generation did not use a fully pressurized oiling system. The connecting rods were oiled using an &quot;oil trough&quot; built into the oil pan that had spray nozzles that squirted a stream of oil at the connecting rods (which were equipped with &quot;dippers&quot;), thus supplying oil to the rod bearings.

Rod bearings were made of babbitt cast integral with the rod. The bearing was adjustable for wear by removing copper shims placed between the rod cap and connecting rod. In this way specified oil clearance could be maintained. If the crankshaft were to be turned undersized, or if the bearing was damaged or worn out, rod and bearing were replaced as a unit, typically at the dealership.

This engine was also used in GM&#x27;s British Bedford truck. In the late 1930s rival Austin decided to get into the 2-3 ton truck (&quot;lorry&quot;) market and in a crash program based the design on the basic architecture of this &quot;Stove Bolt&quot; engine, except that they added detachable shell main and con-rod bearings and pressurized lubrication. That Austin engine, in six-cylinder form, post war known as the Austin D-Series, went on to power cars such as the Austin Sheerline and Princess, and the Jensen Interceptor and 541. Austin also lopped off two cylinders to create the BS1 engine and in that form various versions, with various capacities, powered cars such as the Austin 16, A70 Hampshire and Hereford, A90 Atlantic, the Austin-Healey 100-4 and the Austin Gipsy, a generation of commercial vans, as well as some models of the iconic London black taxi (FX3 and FX4).

===235===

In 1941 a version of the 216 engine was introduced for use in large trucks. Both the bore and stroke of were increased over the 216. This engine had the same oil &quot;dipper system&quot; as the 216.

The 235 was introduced to the Chevy passenger car line in 1950, coupled to the new Powerglide automatic transmission, and 3.55:1 rear differential. The new version used with the Powerglide transmission featured hydraulic lifters, a higher 7.5:1 compression ratio, and larger intake valves to produce more power. The pushrod cover on the side of the engine also no longer extended across the cylinder head, to eliminate oil leaks. In 1953 the 235 engine became standard equipment in all Chevrolet passenger cars except the sedan delivery body (which continued to use the older 216 until 1954), but when coupled to the standard three-speed manual transmission (called &quot;Thrift-King&quot; in that guise) it featured solid lifters, a 7.1:1 compression ratio, and correspondingly lower power output: versus with the Powerglide.

A fully pressurized lubrication system with shell type main bearings in lieu of poured babbitt and aluminum pistons were also introduced in 1953, but only in the higher-output &quot;Blue Flame&quot; version in cars ordered with the Powerglide transmission. The alleged benefits of a &quot;blue flame&quot; rather than yellow had been touted in Chevrolet advertising since 1934. The 1953 Corvette used a unique version of the high-pressure 235 engine with mechanical lifters, the same slightly higher-lift camshaft as used in the 261 truck engine and three single-barrel, side-draft Carter Model YH carburetors to produce .

From 1954 to 1962, the high-pressure 235 engine with solid lifters was used in some trucks. From 1956 to 1962, all 235 engines used in cars had hydraulic lifters.

The 235 is known as one of the great Chevrolet engines, noted for its power and durability. It was replaced by the third generation 230 from 1962.

Canadian-production GMC trucks also used the 216 and 235 Chevrolet straight-six engines as their base light-duty truck powerplant in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The 216 was used from 1947 to 1953, and the 235 was used in 1954 light-duty trucks only. Medium-duty GMC trucks used US-built GMC engines in the 248, 270, and higher sizes prior to 1954.

===261===
In 1954, a truck engine was introduced as an optional Jobmaster engine for heavy-duty trucks. This engine was very similar to the 235 engine, except for a different block casting with a larger piston bore of , two extra coolant holes (in the block and head) between three paired (siamesed) cylinders, and a slightly higher lift camshaft. This engine was offered as a step up from the 235 starting in 1954. It was offered in parallel with the GMC V6 engine in 1960 until 1963, when it was discontinued. The 261 US truck engine had mechanical lifters and was available from 1954 to 1962.

The 235 and 261 truck engines were also used by GMC Truck of Canada (GMC truck 6-cylinder engines were also used in Canada). The 1955–1962 full-size Canadian Pontiac car had a standard 261-cubic-inch engine that had hydraulic lifters. This engine was not sold in the US, but was very similar to the US truck 261.

The 261 engines were also used in light trucks and the Chevrolet Veraneio from 1958 to 1979 in Brazil. Produced 148 hp.

<text>Ignacio Javier Gómez Novo (; born 26 March 1979) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a forward. Novo was an assistant coach and served as the interim head coach for the final 5 matches of the 2023 season for USL League One side Lexington SC, as well as the head coach for the club&#x27;s U23 team.

He transferred from Huesca to Scottish club Raith Rovers in 2001 and Dundee a year later. In July 2004, he moved to Rangers for £450,000. During his first season at the club he scored 25 goals and won a league and League Cup double. He had to wait four years before lifting the league championship again in the 2008–09 season, where he also scored the winning goal in the 2009 Scottish Cup Final which won him his second double with the Ibrox club.

Following his time at Rangers, he had several short spells at clubs in Spain, Poland, Scotland, England, the United States and Northern Ireland.

==Early life==
Novo was born in Ferrol, Galicia. His father, Ricardo Gómez Varela, was a centre half known as Richard who spent one year at Real Betis.

==Club career==
===Raith Rovers===
Novo joined Raith Rovers from Huesca in July 2001. He made a scoring debut against Airdrieonians on 4 August, and netted the winner during a Challenge Cup match against Alloa Athletic three days later. Novo saw himself sent off in only his third match for Raith, whilst playing against Partick Thistle.

Despite this setback he went on to score consistently in the Scottish First Division, netting doubles against St Mirren and twice against Falkirk. Novo accumulated a total of 22 goals in 38 appearances during his first season in Scotland.

===Dundee===
His goal scoring record attracted the attention of Scottish Premier League club Dundee who signed him for £100,000 in July 2002. He made his Scottish Premier League debut on 3 August 2002 in a 1–1 draw with Hearts. Novo scored his first and second goals for the club against Dunfermline Athletic on 17 August but was sent-off in the dying moments of the match for raising his foot at Pars defender Scott Wilson. He went on to score a further seven goals to end the season with a tally of nine.

His second season saw Novo return to form, scoring four goals in the UEFA Cup, including one against then Serie A outfit Perugia, helped him to an end of season tally of 25. This form attracted the interest of several clubs including Celtic and Rangers. Celtic had a £500,000 bid accepted but failed to agree terms the player, stating Novo didn&#x27;t have the &quot;necessary level of commitment&quot; during signing talks.

===Rangers===

Novo signed for Rangers on 6 July 2004 for a reported fee of £450,000. He was allocated the number 10 shirt that had been vacated by Michael Mols. In his first season at the club he scored 25 goals, including the goal against Hibernian that won Rangers the league title. He made his debut for Rangers in a Scottish Premier League match away to Aberdeen on 7 August 2004. His first goal came in his second appearance, netting in Rangers&#x27; 2–1 loss to Russian side CSKA Moscow on 10 August.

Following his first goal, Novo failed to score in his next eight appearances and he was dropped from the starting eleven. He came on as a 66th-minute substitute in a league match against his former employers Dundee. Novo netted two goals in as many minutes which helped Rangers to a 2–0 victory, after which he was a regular in the side.

At the start of the 2005–06 season, Novo broke his fifth metatarsal, which ruled him out for several months. Upon his return from injury he failed to score in the twenty matches he played the rest of that season, being deployed more as a winger than a striker due to the form of Kris Boyd. His three goals had come against Celtic, Falkirk and Cypriot club Anorthosis Famagusta.

With the departure of Alex McLeish and the arrival of Frenchman Paul Le Guen, Novo looked set to leave Rangers. However, a proposed transfer to English First Division club Coventry City fell through on transfer deadline day. Novo initially found his appearances sporadic, featuring in the first game of the season then waiting seven weeks for his second but after a mixture of poor results, injuries and his good performances for the reserves Novo returned to the first team. His first goal of that season, and in over a year, was during a 3–2 UEFA Cup win over Livorno on 19 October 2006. The following match, Novo came off the bench to score a late winner against St Mirren in a 3–2 win. He then started the next game, Motherwell held Rangers to a 1–1 draw with Novo named Man of the Match. His rejuvenated form continued with goals against Heart of Midlothian, Maccabi Haifa and AJ Auxerre. Novo continued to be a regular when Le Guen was replaced with Walter Smith.

The signings of strikers in the summer of 2007 led to increased competition for attacking positions and most of Novo&#x27;s appearances in the early months of the season were as a substitute. On 20 October, he started the first Old Firm derby match of the season and scored twice in a 3–0 victory for Rangers over Celtic. On 2 December 2007, it was reported that Rangers were willing to offer Novo a one-year extension to his current contract, which was to expire in July 2008. However, Novo said that he would leave the club if he was not offered a longer contract. He was later offered a two-year contract extension until the summer of 2010, and signed the deal on 21 December 2007.

On 1 May 2008, he scored the winning penalty in the semi-final shoot-out against Fiorentina which put Rangers through to the 2008 UEFA Cup Final. During the 2007–08 season Novo was sent off twice, both in league games before cup finals, meaning that he missed both the 2008 League Cup final and the 2008 Scottish Cup final through suspension.

The 2008–09 season saw Novo used almost exclusively as a substitute. He came off the bench in the 2009 Scottish Cup Final to score the winning goal after only being on the field for 28 seconds.

During what turned out to be his final season with Rangers, he won both the league and Scottish League Cup, scoring nine times, but was mainly used as a substitute, starting just 14 league games. Novo decided not to sign a new contract as he was not getting enough starting opportunities.

On 30 March 2014, Novo was inducted into the Rangers Hall of Fame along with Fernando Ricksen and Lee McCulloch

===Sporting de Gijón===
In May 2010, Novo moved to La Liga side Sporting de Gijón, on a two-year deal. After a difficult first season in Spain, Novo was offered to clubs in the summer of 2011 with a return to Scotland being mooted. Aberdeen boss Craig Brown said that he had turned down the chance to sign Novo, but this was later denied by the player&#x27;s agent.

Sporting boss Javier Clemente, branded Novo &quot;a coward&quot;, and of &quot;showing no commitment to the club in their time of need&quot;, and tore up Novo&#x27;s contract. Clemente then states he “Went into the dressing room and told the rest of the players that if we had any other cowards they could also leave.”

===Legia Warsaw and Huesca===
On 16 February 2012, Novo signed a 6-month contract with Legia Warsaw. He made his debut on 26 February against Śląsk Wrocław and was substituted in the 59th minute with his side leading 3–0, Legia eventually winning 4–0. Novo made 11 League and 3 Cup appearances for Legia, scoring once in a 2–1 win over Arka Gdynia in the semi-final of the Polish Cup.

In July 2012 Novo returned to Spain to rejoin Second division side Huesca with whom he spent a successful 2-year spell between 1999 and 2001. Novo&#x27;s second spell at the club was less successful than his first, scoring only 6 league goals. In November 2012, Novo was sent off after scoring in a 2–1 win over Guadalajara for gestures made towards the crowd. Novo protested his innocence, stating that the &#x27;gestures&#x27; were in fact a &quot;dedication&quot; towards his late mother. Huesca ended being relegated at the end of the season, and Novo became a free agent.

===Later career===
Novo signed a short-term contract with Scottish Championship club Greenock Morton in October 2013, in a deal that was scheduled to run until 12 January 2014. However, after a disappointing return of only one goal, and with Morton at the bottom of the Championship, Novo was released from his contract ahead of schedule on 24 December.

On 11 February 2014, Novo signed a short-term deal until the end of the 2013–14 season with Football League One side Carlisle United. He was released in May following their relegation, after appearing in only six matches.

On 11 September 2014, Novo signed for Carolina RailHawks of USL Pro.

On 26 July 2016, it was announced Novo would join Northern Ireland Football League team Glentoran. A few weeks after his arrival in Belfast, Novo was warned by police that he was under a death threat from dissident republicans. The latter part of his season was marred by a six-game ban for a headbutt against Crusaders in January. After scoring a total of 4 goals in 28 games, he was released in May 2017.

After leaving Glentoran, it was reported that Novo hoped to move into a coaching role, however by the end of 2017 Novo had instead announced plans to open a Rangers-themed bar in Glasgow.

==International career==
Novo was never selected for the Spain national team but has played for Galicia – his debut was in a 2008 friendly against Iran, arriving in his homeland just an hour before the match started after playing for Rangers against Celtic earlier in the day. He scored two goals and left to the acclaim of the Galician fans.

On 24 October 2008, it was reported that Novo could be selected by the Scotland national team as he was eligible to acquire a British passport, having lived in Scotland for eight years. This led to much debate amongst the Scottish media as to whether Novo, who was born in Spain and has no Scottish parents or grandparents, should be selected by Scotland. It eventually became clear, however, that the Home Nations would continue to honour a deal whereby that any player selected by England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales would be required to have a blood tie to that country, or have had five years compulsory education within it. This deal would rule out the prospect of Novo playing for Scotland.

==Coaching==
On 15 November 2022, Novo was named as an assistant coach for USL League One club Lexington SC, where he will also serve as the head coach of the club&#x27;s U-23 team. The move reunites Novo with Sam Stockley, who was Novo&#x27;s teammate at Carolina Railhawks.

Novo joined the coaching team at Drumchapel United in June 2024.

==Personal life==
Novo met Donna Clark in 2004 when playing in Scotland, and the couple were engaged a year later. During a lengthy engagement, they had a son together, Javier, before finally marrying in February 2015 where Novo&#x27;s ex-Rangers team-mate, Marvin Andrews, acted as pastor. He resides in Scotland.

In January 2018, 38-year-old Novo suffered a heart attack while playing for a team of Rangers legends at the &quot;AOK Masters&quot; in Berlin. He was immediately rushed to hospital and underwent emergency surgery.

<text>Neuenrade is a town in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, located in the hills of the Sauerland in the &quot;Märkischer Kreis&quot;.

==Geography==
The highest elevation in the town area is the &quot;Kohlberg&quot; with an altitude of 514 m above sea level. The lowest elevation is at &quot;Hölmecke&quot; with 190 m. The town covers an area of 54.12 km², most of which is forests (29.41 km²) and farm land (18.18 km²).

The municipal territory includes the villages of Affeln, Berentrop, Blintrop and Küntrop.

==History==
Around 1220 the place was first mentioned in a document, then named Rode. The village consisted of about 12 farms. In 1353 the city was fortified. In 1355 it received the cityrights from count Engelbert III.

By 1890/91 the municipalities Werdohl and Ohle had grown so much that they left the &quot;Amt Neuenrade&quot;, the local administrative unit. The &quot;Amt&quot; thereafter was composed of only Neuenrade and Dahle.

The &quot;Amt Neuenrade&quot; was dissolved, effective on January 1, 1969. The municipality Dahle was incorporated into Altena, while the municipality Küntrop from the &quot;Amt Balve&quot; was incorporated into the city Neuenrade. In 1975 the city was further enlarged with the municipalities Affeln, Altenaffeln and Blintrop from the &quot;Amt Balve&quot;.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms is based on the coat of arms of the counts of the Mark, showing a chequered red-white bar on a yellow shield. The oldest version of the coat of arms is known from a wood carving in the city church dated from the 16th century; it showed Saint Mary on top of the coat of arms of the Mark. Later the Mary picture was moved inside the shield. It was officially granted on November 25, 1912.

After the communal reform of 1975 the city changed their coat of arms. In the bottom of the shield the black cross of the bishops of Cologne was added, representing the municipalities of the former &quot;Amt Balve&quot; which historically belonged to Kurköln. The new coat of arms was granted on March 23, 1979, based on a design by Professor Hußmann.

The &quot;Amt Neuenrade&quot; also had a coat of arms. It was granted on January 13, 1938, and was designed by Waldemar Mallek based on an idea of Dr. Fritz Thomée. It resembled the coat of arms of the city Neuenrade, the bottom part showed a mill wheel. As a municipality Dahle had no traditional heraldic symbol. The mill wheel was chosen symbolizing the traditional industries at the Nette River.

==Population development==
The numbers from 1800, 1900 and 1955 are estimates. From 1975 the data come from the Statistical Office in North Rhine-Westphalia.

==Mayors==
*1964-1999: Hans Schmerbeck
*1999-2014: Klaus-Peter Sasse
Since the 2014 elections, Antonius Wiesemann (CDU) is the mayor of Neuenrade.

==International relations==
Since 1978 Neuenrade has a city friendship with the Dutch municipality Dinxperlo. In 1984 it was converted into a town twinning. The partnership was reaffirmed in 2005 by the municipality Aalten, of which Dinxperlo had become part that year. Since 1990 it is also twinned with Klingenthal in Saxony.

<text>The naval Battle of Dungeness took place on 30 November 1652 (10 December in the Gregorian calendar) during the First Anglo-Dutch War near the cape of Dungeness in Kent.

== Background ==
In September 1652 the government of the Commonwealth of England, the Council of State, mistakenly believing that the United Provinces after their defeat at the Battle of the Kentish Knock would desist from bringing out a fleet so late in the season, sent away ships to the Mediterranean and the Baltic. At the same time the largest English vessels remained in repair and active ships were undermanned as sailors deserted or rioted because their wages were in arrears. This left the English weakened and badly outnumbered in home waters. Meanwhile, the Dutch were making every effort to reinforce their fleet. Dutch trade interests demanded that their navy would make a final effort to convoy merchantmen to the south.

== Battle ==
On 21 November 1652 Old Style, 1 December New Style, Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp, again (unofficial) supreme commander after his successor Vice-Admiral Witte de With had suffered a breakdown because of his defeat at the Battle of the Kentish Knock, set sail from the naval port of Hellevoetsluis with 88 men of war and five fireships, escorting a vast convoy of 270 merchantmen bound for France, the Mediterranean and the Indies. At first, unfavourable southwestern gales forced him to return but on 23 November he again sailed south. With the convoy, accompanied by sixteen warships, safely delivered through the Straits of Dover, Tromp turned to the west in search of the English, and on 29 November 1652 he discovered the English fleet of 42 capital ships and ten smaller vessels anchored in the Downs, between the landheads of North Foreland and South Foreland, commanded by General at Sea Robert Blake. After a council of war in which it was decided to avoid battle, the English promptly left their anchorage, sailing south. Blake may not have realised how large the Dutch fleet was, or he may have feared to become trapped like the Spanish had been some years earlier in the Battle of the Downs. The wind was now strong from the northwest, so the English could not return to the Downs in any case, having to settle for Dover. The English fleet swiftly rounded South Foreland while the Dutch were unable to reach them, both fleets anchoring in the evening at about five miles distance. During the night a storm dispersed some Dutch vessels. Next morning, at noon the two fleets began to move southwest, with the English hugging the coast and the Dutch keeping some distance. The forces were separated by the Rip-Raps and the Varne Shoal and therefore unable to engage. Ultimately the curve of the shoreline, the cape of Dungeness or the &quot;Hook of the Shingles&quot; jutting out, forced the English to turn on a southerly course. Between the Varne Shoal and Dungeness a narrow exit exists. Blake had hoped to escape through it but when he arrived about seventeen Dutch ships were already waiting for him. Nevertheless, he continued his manoeuvre. At about 15:00, the leading ships of both fleets met in what a contemporary account called a &quot;bounteous rhetoric of powder and bullet&quot;.

Blake&#x27;s &quot;Triumph&quot; was the first larger ship to sail through the exit. At that moment Tromp&#x27;s &quot;Brederode&quot; arrived and the Dutch commander immediately hoisted the red &quot;bloodflag&quot; as a sign to attack. Blake, noticing this, tacked to cross the bow of the &quot;Brederode&quot;, giving his opponent a broadside. In response, Tromp also tacked and fired a salvo. The next English ship, the &quot;Garland&quot;, then moved between the &quot;Triumph&quot; and the &quot;Brederode&quot; in an attempt to cross the latter&#x27;s bow also. This failed however, the &quot;Garland&quot; ramming the bow of the &quot;Brederode&quot; at starboard with such force that both ships remained entangled. The snout and bowsprit of the &quot;Brederode&quot; broke off. The larger crew of the &quot;Brederode&quot; swiftly boarded the &quot;Garland&quot;. Tromp encouraged his men by promising a reward of five hundred guilders to the first who would strike the English flag. One sailor climbed into the main mast of the &quot;Garland&quot; and replaced the St George&#x27;s Cross with the Prince&#x27;s Flag. In despair, captain Richard Batten blew up his own upper deck to drive away the Dutch. Meanwhile, the third English ship to arrive, the &quot;Anthony Bonaventure&quot;, grappled the port of the &quot;Brederode&quot;. Covering the deck of the Dutch ship with canister shot, it soon forced its crew below deck. Noticing the plight of his commander, Vice-Admiral Johan Evertsen in turn boarded the port of the &quot;Anthony Bonaventure&quot; with his &quot;Hollandia&quot;, so that four ships were now attached. In ferocious fighting his men, losing sixty, killed the entire crew of the &quot;Anthony Bonaventure&quot;, including Captain Walter Hoxton. When Tromp&#x27;s secretary, standing next to him, was killed by a musket ball, he exhorted the combined crews of the &quot;Brederode&quot; and the &quot;Hollandia&quot; to assault the &quot;Garland&quot;, exclaiming &quot;Children, things cannot go on this way. It&#x27;s them or us!&quot;. The &quot;Garland&quot; was taken, with sixty killed out of a crew of one-hundred fifty, including Captain Batten. At this point the &quot;Garland&quot; was in a bad condition, her rudder largely having been shot away.

Blake tried to assist the &quot;Garland&quot; and the &quot;Anthony Bonaventure&quot; but was constantly attacked by Dutch flagships such as the &quot;Princes Louise&quot; of Johan de Liefde and the &quot;Monnickendam&quot; of Pieter Florisse. The &quot;Triumph&quot; nearly avoided being grappled at both sides, by the &quot;Princes Louise&quot; and the &quot;Gulden Beer&quot; of Captain Jan de Haes. Blake received little support from the remainder of the English fleet. When the &quot;Happy Entrance&quot; entered the channel, she was at once assaulted and only with difficulty managed to extract herself. The other English ships began to understand the tactical situation: the exit functioned as a bottleneck and trying to force it would only allow the Dutch to overpower the English ships one by one. On the other hand, most Dutch ships did not engage either. Annoyed, Commodore Michiel de Ruyter on the &quot;Witte Lam&quot; entered the exit in the opposite direction to attack the mass of the English ships but no one followed him and he was forced to withdraw. He complained in his journal: &quot;If we had had any help, yea of but ten or twelve ships, we would have beaten the entire fleet&quot;. Despite the tactical difficulties, it was unacceptable to leave Blake to his fate. The two most heavily armed English vessels apart from the &quot;Triumph&quot;, the &quot;Vanguard&quot; and the &quot;Victory&quot;, used their superior firepower to break the Dutch opposition and allowed Blake to retreat and join the English main force. The &quot;Triumph&quot; had lost her fore-topmast and Blake had been wounded.

Around 17:00, the onset of darkness ended the battle. A large part of the Dutch fleet had not even arrived yet. The English fleet by nightfall had lost five ships. These included the captured &quot;Garland&quot; and &quot;Anthony Bonaventure&quot; that would be taken into Dutch service as the &quot;Rozenkrans&quot; and the &quot;Bonaventura&quot;. Two smaller vessels were burnt, one of them perhaps the light frigate &quot;Acorn&quot;, and one sunk. In the evening, the Dutch lost the &quot;Schiedam&quot;, also known as the &quot;Gelderland&quot; because the States of Gueldres had paid for her, through fire and subsequent explosion. Captain Dirk Juinbol died from his wounds the next day. Blake that night retreated under cover of darkness to his anchorage in the Downs. The Dutch did not follow but used this time to repair the ships, especially the &quot;Brederode&quot;. The next morning the Dutch intercepted a group of three merchantmen sailing from the west. Their guard ship, the &quot;Merlin&quot;, managed to escape, but they themselves were taken and their cargo of figs and lemons were distributed among the Dutch crews. Tromp could not be satisfied with the result however as the Dutch had missed an opportunity to annihilate the English. On 1 December, he pursued Blake who, however, had already rounded South Foreland again. The wind turned east, which allowed Blake to quickly reach the Thames but slowed the Dutch. A group of English ships was encountered, that had been sent to reinforce Blake but had sailed past him in the darkness. Two new frigates, the &quot;Ruby&quot; and the &quot;Sapphire&quot;, managed to escape, but the &quot;Hercules&quot;, an armed merchantman, was run ashore by her captain, Zachary Browne. Most of the crew fled inland and the &quot;Hercules&quot;, and Browne, were captured by the &quot;Haes in &#x27;t Veld&quot; of Bastiaan Centsen, who managed to refloat the vessel.

Returning to the Strait of Dover, Tromp allowed his merchant convoy to split up, each group of merchantmen continuing its way towards their individual destination together with their protecting warships. Tromp considered attacking Blake in the Medway, but despite offering a reward of fifty Flemish pounds, in the entire Dutch fleet not a single pilot could be found who dared to navigate these dangerous waters. Not until 1667 did De Ruyter manage to execute such an attack, in the Raid on the Medway.

==Aftermath==
The battle resulted in several reforms in the English Fleet. Part of Blake&#x27;s force consisted of impressed merchant vessels that retained their civilian captains/owners. Many of them refused to participate in the battle. Some naval captains insisted on their traditional right to enter and leave the battle at times of their choosing, and to leave formation in order to secure any prize. Blake threatened to resign if something was not done. The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty responded by requiring all impressed vessels to be under the command of naval captains, and issuing Sailing and Fighting Instructions which significantly enhanced an admiral&#x27;s authority over his fleet.

The victory gave the Dutch temporary control of the English Channel and so control of merchant shipping. A legend says that Tromp attached a broom to his mast as a sign that he had swept the sea clean of his enemies, but in his book &quot;The Command of the Ocean&quot;, N.A.M. Roger doubts the legend as such a boasting action would have been out of character for Tromp. Additionally, at the time, a broom attached to a mast was the way of showing that a ship was for sale. Also, Dutch contemporaneous sources make no mention of it.

<text>James Joseph Couzens (August 26, 1872October 22, 1936) was an American businessman, politician and philanthropist. He served as mayor of Detroit (1919–1922) and U.S. Senator from Michigan (1922–1936). Prior to entering politics he served as vice president and general manager of the Ford Motor Company.

==Early life and career==
Couzens was born in Chatham, Ontario, Canada in 1872, the son of soapmaker James and Emma Clift Couzens. He attended the public schools of Chatham and spent time at a business college. He moved to Detroit, Michigan in 1890 and worked as a railroad car checker for the New York Central Railroad from 1890 to 1897. Couzens&#x27; diligence at the railroad was noticed by Alexander Y. Malcomson, who hired the young man as a clerk in his coal business. Couzens worked for Malcomson from 1897 to 1903.

In 1898, Couzens married Margaret Manning. The couple had six children: a son born in 1899 who died in infancy; Homer Couzens, born in 1900; Frank Couzens (later mayor of Detroit), born in 1902; Madeline, born in 1904; Margo, born in 1910, and Edith, born in 1911.

==Association with Henry Ford==
In 1902, Henry Ford was organizing the Ford Motor Company; Alexander Malcomson was a major stakeholder in the company. The two were seeking additional stockholders; Couzens borrowed heavily and invested $2,500 in the new firm. Ford Motor Company was founded in 1903 with John S. Gray as president, Ford as vice-president, Malcomson as treasurer, and Couzens as secretary. Couzens took over the business management of the new firm for an annual salary of $2,400. In 1906, Gray died and Malcomson was eased out of the business, and Couzens became vice president and general manager of the company. The company made both Ford and Couzens wealthy, due in no small part to Couzens&#x27;s business acumen. However, the two men gradually grew apart, and in 1915 Couzens resigned his position as general manager, although he retained a seat on the board. In 1919, Ford purchased Couzens&#x27;s shares in the company for $30,000,000.

He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Detroit work and political career==
James Couzens was president of the Bank of Detroit and director of the Detroit Trust Company. He was commissioner of street railways 1913-1915 and commissioner of the metropolitan police department 1916–1918. He was mayor of Detroit 1919–1922. As mayor, Couzens installed municipal street railways.

==Senatorial career==
Couzens was appointed November 29, 1922, as a Republican to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Truman H. Newberry. This appointment was confirmed by his special election on November 4, 1924 to serve the remainder of Newberry&#x27;s term, at which time he was also elected to a full term commencing March 4, 1925. He was reelected in 1930, serving in total from November 29, 1922, until his death on October 22, 1936. He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1936, the loss generally attributed to Couzens&#x27;s support for Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal programs. He was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Civil Service in the Sixty-ninth Congress, the U.S. Senate Committee on Education and Labor in the Sixty-ninth and Seventieth Congresses, the U.S. Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce in the Seventy-first and Seventy-second Congresses. Couzens&#x27; actions in Congress generally followed those of the Progressive Republicans, advocating acts such as high graduated income tax and public ownership of utilities.

Couzens died in Detroit and is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery there.

==Philanthropy==
Couzens established the Children&#x27;s Fund of Michigan with a $10,000,000 grant. He also gave $1,000,000 for relief in Detroit and began a fund to make loans to the physically handicapped. Under Dr Frank Norton, Dr Kenneth Richard Gibson and their secretary, Kathryn Hutchison, the Children&#x27;s Fund, among other things, provided free health and dental work for indigent Detroit children. The Fund was set up with a 25-year life span, and the project ended in the mid-1950s. 

In response to the Bath School Disaster, in which Andrew Kehoe, an embittered school board member and treasurer, killed 38 children by blowing up explosives he had planted in the basement of the Bath Consolidated School in Bath Township, Michigan, Couzens gave $75,000 to fund rebuilding. The new school was dedicated as the &quot;James Couzens Agricultural School&quot;. He donated $600,000 to the University of Michigan for the building of a residence hall for female nursing students. It was to be named Couzens Hall in his honor, but at his request, the Board of Trustees named the new home McLaughlin Hall in honor of Emily A. McLaughlin, Principal of the Farrand Training School.

In the 1930s, Couzens donated $1 million to Children&#x27;s Hospital of Michigan, in response to a birthday request from his wife for &quot;a simple box in which to keep my pearls&quot;. Couzens complied, including a note within the box describing the $1 million gift, stating &quot;My dear, your new pearls will be all the children who are eventually treated there&quot;. Today, Children&#x27;s Hospital of Michigan is part of the Detroit Medical Center.

Disturbed by the failures of low-income housing projects that came out of the depression, he funded an alternative. He contributed $550,000 of his own personal money, combined with $300,000 from Oakland Housing, to create a managed low-income housing project called Westacres, in West Bloomfield, Michigan. The project gave the low-income factory working man a chance to own a home. The homes were located on 1 acre of land and the owners were required to farm the land to provide food for their families when seasonal layoffs took place.

==Miscellaneous==
Asked how to say his name, he told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot;: &quot;Pronounced exactly as &quot;cousins&quot;.&quot;

On November 9, 1937, just over a year after his death, the Detroit City Council led by Mayor Frank Couzens—James Couzens&#x27; son—voted to rename the portion of Northwestern Highway in Detroit, which then began at Wyoming Avenue and continued into Oakland County, after James Couzens. (The segment of Northwestern Highway in Oakland County was not renamed, however.) When the John C. Lodge Freeway was extended from its terminus at Wyoming Avenue northwesterly along the route of James Couzens Highway–Northwestern Highway in the 1960s, the Lodge name was extended along the new freeway segment, while the freeway&#x27;s service drives between Wyoming Avenue and Eight Mile Road (M-102) retained the James Couzens name.

<text>Rodolphe Lemieux (; November 1, 1866 – September 28, 1937) was a Canadian parliamentarian and long time Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada (1922–1930).

== Biography ==
He was born in Montreal as the son of a Customs officer. After a career as a journalist, lawyer and law professor he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1896 election as a Liberal. He was a loyal follower of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and, in 1904 became Solicitor General of Canada in Laurier&#x27;s Cabinet. He subsequently served as Postmaster General of Canada, Minister of Labour and Minister of Marine and Fisheries. His Deputy Minister in the Department of Labour was future Prime Minister of Canada, William Lyon Mackenzie King.

As Minister of Labour he started a system in which no strike or lockout in a public utility or mine could be legal until the differences had been referred to a three-man board of conciliation representing the employer, the employees and the public.

In 1907, Laurier sent Lemieux to Japan to defend Canadian immigration policies which were discriminatory against the Japanese. He succeeded in obtaining an agreement from Japan to curtail emigration of its citizens to Canada.

He also continued in his academic pursuits, becoming a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1908 and President of the Society in 1918.

In the 1911 election, Lemieux engaged in a series of public debates before audiences of several thousands with nationalist leader Henri Bourassa who was threatening the Liberal&#x27;s base in Quebec. The Liberals retained a majority of seats in the province but lost government because of its loss of seats in Ontario.

Lemieux was a sharp critic of the Conservative government of Robert Borden accusing it of putting the interests of the British Empire ahead of those of Canada.

During World War I, Lemieux opposed conscription and supported Laurier during the Conscription Crisis of 1917.

When Mackenzie King led the Liberals back to power in the 1921 election, he chose Ernest Lapointe as his Quebec lieutenant rather than Lemieux. Instead, he nominated Lemieux as Speaker of the House of Commons. Lemieux presided over the House during several minority governments.

He was Speaker during the King-Byng Affair of 1926. He remained Speaker when Governor General Byng appointed Arthur Meighen as Prime Minister rather than call an election.

He attempted to rule in a neutral manner despite the highly charged atmosphere, and all but one of his rulings were sustained by the House. Instead Lord Byng invited the Conservatives to form a government. In spite of assurances of support from the Progressive Party, the Conservatives were unable to maintain control of the House. Lemieux had to make several crucial rulings. Five were appealed and one was overturned.

Lemieux presided over three successive Parliaments and was the longest serving Speaker until Lucien Lamoureux broke the record in 1974.

On June 30, 1930, King appointed Lemieux to the Senate of Canada, where he served until his death in 1937. He was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

<doc id="880253" wikidata="Q645180" url="?curid=880253" title="Bylot Island">
<text>Bylot Island lies off the northern end of Baffin Island in Nunavut Territory, Canada. Eclipse Sound to the southeast and Navy Board Inlet to the southwest separate it from Baffin Island. Parry Channel lies to its northwest. At it is ranked 71st largest island in the world and Canada&#x27;s 17th largest island. The island measures east to west and north to south and is one of the largest uninhabited islands in the world. While there are no permanent settlements on this Canadian Arctic island, Inuit from Pond Inlet and elsewhere regularly travel to Bylot Island. An Inuit seasonal hunting camp is located southwest of Cape Graham Moore.

The island&#x27;s mountains are part of the Byam Martin Mountains, which is part of the Baffin Mountains of the Arctic Cordillera. In addition to Angilaaq Mountain, Malik Mountain, Mount St. Hans, and Mount Thule are notable. Tay Bay is on the west coast. Vertical cliffs along the coastline are made up of Precambrian dolomite. There are numerous glaciers. The western shore faces Navy Board Inlet. The island&#x27;s north shore, facing Lancaster Sound, is a polar bear maternity den area. Beluga, bowhead whale, harp seal, narwhal, and ringed seal frequent the area.

The island is named for the Arctic explorer Robert Bylot, who was the first European to sight it in 1616. The whaling captain William Adams was the first to prove the island&#x27;s insular nature in 1872.

In the 2000s, Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation, began to develop a &quot;tote road&quot; from its Mary River Mine, and harbour infrastructure in Milne Bay—a small, shallow arm of at the confluence of Eclipse Sound and Navy Board Inlet which separates Bylot Island from Baffin Island. Milne Inlet flows in a southerly direction from Navy Board Inlet at the confluence of Eclipse Sound.

==Protected areas==
Almost all of the island is located within Sirmilik National Park, harbouring large populations of thick-billed murres, black-legged kittiwakes and greater snow geese. The eastern area of the island is federally designated as the Bylot Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary.

<text>Alexander George Karras (July 15, 1935October 10, 2012) was an American professional football player, professional wrestler, sportscaster, and actor. He was a four-time Pro Bowl selection playing defensive tackle for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL), where he played from 1958 to 1970. He is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in the Centennial class.

As an actor, Karras played Mongo in the 1974 comedy film &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;. He starred as George Papadopolis, the adoptive father of Webster Long (Emmanuel Lewis), in the ABC sitcom &quot;Webster&quot; (1983–1989) alongside his wife Susan Clark. Karras also had a prominent role in &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot;, starring Julie Andrews and James Garner.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Gary, Indiana, Karras was the son of Dr. George Karras, a Greek immigrant (from Chios) who graduated from the University of Chicago and pursued his medical degree in Canada. There, George Karras met and married a Canadian woman, Alex&#x27;s mother, Emmeline (née Wilson), a registered nurse. George Karras opened a medical practice in Gary, but he died when Alex was thirteen years old. By that time, Alex Karras had learned to play football in a parking lot near his home, with and against his athletically inclined brothers, and he blossomed into a four-time Indiana all-state selection at Gary&#x27;s Emerson High School. Karras also excelled in numerous other sports in high school, including baseball, track, wrestling, and basketball. He graduated in 1954.

==College career==

His older brothers, Lou (a future member of the Redskins) and Ted (who later played with the Bears and Lions), had played at Purdue but later Ted transferred to Indiana. Because of it, Alex said, &quot;Indiana had the inside track&quot; on recruiting him. Shortly after he graduated from high school, three coaches from the Iowa Hawkeyes met Karras at his brother Louie&#x27;s house with an airplane and flew him to Spencer, Iowa, where he remained incommunicado through the summer. Writing in the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; in 1971 (as reprinted in the &quot;Iowa City Press-Citizen&quot;), Karras said that &quot;nobody knew where I was, not even my mom, although Louie told her not to worry. Obviously, Iowa came up with something, I have no intention of stirring up any mess. I&#x27;ll only say that, as Louie explained it, some accommodations were made by the people at Iowa that would make things easier for the family, and so away I went. It was the beginning of some awful years.&quot;

Karras struggled in the beginning at Iowa, with classwork, homesickness, and with his coach, Forest Evashevski. He was a pledge at Sigma Nu fraternity during his first year in school. Karras probably would have left Iowa had he not befriended a Greek theater owner, Ernie Pannos, as well as fellow players Cal Jones and Bob Commings. Karras&#x27;s sophomore year with Iowa in 1955 got off to a rocky start when he showed up for practice overweight.

Karras had been (dubiously) advised that year that he would need to gain substantial weight to have a chance at success in pro football, prompting him to report to camp at 260-270 pounds, in contrast to the 225-230 the Iowa coaching staff expected.

Karras was also hampered that season by a cracked anklebone. After being disappointed at not getting to play in the season finale, Karras threw a shoe at Evashevski and quit the team. Karras did not earn a football letter for the 1955 season.

Karras went to summer classes, lost the excess weight, and rejoined the football team, but a strained relationship resurfaced. Evashevski promised to start Karras in the 1956 season opener against Indiana, when he would square off against his brother, Ted.

But Evashevski played Karras off the bench instead, and Karras quit the team again. This time, Karras agreed to return only after making Evashevski promise he would not talk to him other than in a coaching capacity. (Evashevski always denied any special agreement with Karras.) Iowa took the lead in the 1956 Big Ten title race with a victory over Minnesota. The Hawkeyes then clinched the Big Ten title and Iowa&#x27;s first-ever Rose Bowl berth by defeating Ohio State Karras sealed the game with a sack on the game&#x27;s final play.

Iowa&#x27;s final regular-season game in 1956 was at home over a struggling Notre Dame team. Karras called it his biggest college win, saying, &quot;The Karrases have always had a rivalry with Notre Dame. The school was just down the road from our home and we wanted to beat &#x27;em at anything.&quot; However, after the game, Karras got into a physical battle with Evashevski. Karras did not enjoy his trip to the Rose Bowl, either. &quot;Pasadena was the most boring town I&#x27;ve ever been in,&quot; said Karras. Karras helped the Hawkeyes win the Rose Bowl over Oregon State, He was a first-team All-American in 1956.

Karras spent the summer of 1957 with an American track team of Greek descent. He participated in the shot put, throwing a respectable . In his senior season in 1957, Karras was the most dominant lineman in the nation, won the Outland Trophy, and was the runner-up in the voting for the Heisman Trophy. Karras, Ohio State tackle John Hicks (in 1973), and Aidan Hutchinson, a Michigan edge rusher (2021), are three of only four linemen to finish so high in the Heisman Trophy voting. (Leon Hart, a Notre Dame end, was the only lineman ever to win the Heisman Trophy in 1949.) In addition, Karras was a consensus first-team All-American in 1957. Hawkeye teammate Randy Duncan said,

==Professional football==
Before his NFL career got underway, Karras signed a contract as a professional wrestler on December 13, 1957, earning $25,000 during the six-month off-season. Karras was the tenth selection of the 1958 NFL draft, taken by the Detroit Lions. He signed with the Lions, spurning an offer from the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Winnipeg Blue Bombers. He quickly became one of the dominant defensive tackles in the NFL, playing for 12 seasons (1958–1962, 1964–1970) all with the Lions.

As a rookie in 1958, joining the championship-contending Lions, Karras was adopted in training camp as an off-field flunky, chauffeur, and wingman by superstar quarterback Bobby Layne for his legendary late-night party activities.

By many accounts Karras would marvel at Layne&#x27;s ability to recover from heavy drinking sessions at night and being able to function effectively at practices or games the next day. Karras himself admitted he was frequently heavily hung over as a result of late night bar-hopping.

Layne was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers early in the 1958 season and Karras eventually assumed a veteran leadership position himself.

On January 7, 1963, Karras&#x27;s ownership share in Detroit&#x27;s Lindell AC Bar became a source of controversy when league officials urged him to sell his financial interests in the place because of reports of gambling and organized crime influence.

After first threatening to retire rather than give up the bar ownership, Karras admitted placing bets on NFL games and was suspended by the league, along with Green Bay Packers running back Paul Hornung, for one season (1963). During his exile, Karras returned to pro wrestling, taking on such memorable characters as Dick the Bruiser. He was reinstated, along with Hornung, on March 16, 1964, by NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle. Upon returning to action in 1964, Karras once refused when an official asked him to call the pregame coin toss. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, sir,&quot; Karras replied. &quot;I&#x27;m not permitted to gamble.&quot; During his first year back, player discontent with head coach George Wilson resulted in Karras asking to be traded. However, the Lions settled the issue when they fired Wilson after the season.

From 1960 to 1966, except for his suspension in 1963, he played next to Roger Brown, forming a formidable pair of defensive tackles, until Brown was traded to the Los Angeles Rams. After another season of controversy under new head coach Harry Gilmer, Karras was rumored to be ready to play out his option and sign with the expansion Miami Dolphins of the American Football League under his former coach Wilson. Instead, Karras signed a seven-year contract with the Lions on May 20, 1966, with Wilson stating that Karras had used the threat of signing with Miami to garner a large deal with Detroit. Despite the new contract, controversy remained, as Karras and Gilmer sparred in midseason, with the coach reportedly ready to release the veteran defensive tackle. As before, it would be the coach who would depart, with Karras&#x27;s former teammate Joe Schmidt taking over for Gilmer. On June 4, 1967, Karras once again hinted he would retire to work at a new business venture; once training camp began, though, Karras was back with the Lions. During that preseason, he jokingly commented that he would walk back from Denver if the AFL Broncos defeated the Lions. When it actually happened, Karras backtracked and flew home on the team plane. He was still an All-Pro selection from 1967 to 1969. Despite not allowing a touchdown in the divisional round of the 1970 NFL playoffs, the Lions lost to the Dallas Cowboys his first playoff game and his final game. After the 1971 preseason, while rehabilitating a knee injury suffered the previous year, Karras was released in mid-September, ending his playing career at age 36.

From 1958 to 1970, the Lions were over .500 in six of the 13 years, making the playoffs only once, in 1970, with a record in Karras&#x27;s final year. Aside from 1970, their best years were 1962 and 1969 In 1962, the Lion defense allowed 177 points (12.6 points/game), 188 (13.4 ppg) in 1969, and 202 (14.4 ppg) in 1970; for all three years they were second-least in the NFL, thanks in large part to a tough and rugged defensive line led by Karras. He was called an &quot;iron man&quot; and also nicknamed &quot;Twinkletoes&quot; by his fans, and missed only one game due to injury in his 12 NFL seasons and his 161 games played are the fifteenth-most in Lions history. He made the Pro Bowl four times, and the Hall of Fame named him a member of the 1960s All-Decade team. The Professional Football Researchers Association named Karras to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2006.

On January 15, 2020, Karras was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, as a Centennial Member.

==Film and television==
Karras&#x27;s sense of humor came to the attention of writer George Plimpton, who heard many stories about Karras while training with the Lions for his book &quot;Paper Lion&quot; during the summer of 1963.

Karras himself was under suspension and thus absent during Plimpton&#x27;s training camp tenure with the Lions, making him a constant topic of tall-tale discussion among his past (and future) teammates.

When the film version of the book was made in 1968, Karras made his film debut playing himself.

Following his release by the Lions in 1971, he made several appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and also played a bit part in &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, appearing in the farewell party scene where Rhoda moves back to New York. Karras soon began acting on a full-time basis, playing a Tennessee boy turned Olympic weightlifter named Hugh Ray Feather in 1973&#x27;s &quot;The 500 Pound Jerk&quot;. He played a hulking villain who menaced Clint Walker in the ABC TV film &quot;Hardcase&quot;. A minor but memorable role came one year later in the western parody &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974): the very strong and slow-witted thug Mongo, who rode into town on a huge brahman (marked with &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; passing signals), and knocked out a horse with one punch. (Mongo was also surprisingly philosophical, stating that he was &quot;only pawn in game of life.&quot; This line was much-quoted upon Karras&#x27;s death.) In 1974, he also played the part of Lyle, a Marine saved by Hawkeye Pierce in &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. That same year, he was quickly brought in by ABC in September to replace fellow Gary, Indiana native Fred Williamson (who had replaced Don Meredith) as a commentator for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. He served three years in that role until leaving after the season, with his most memorable comment coming in his first game, when he joked that bald Oakland Raiders lineman Otis Sistrunk, who never attended college, was from &quot;the University of Mars&quot;, after seeing steam coming off his head.

In 1972, Karras hosted a local weekly football program for Windsor, Ontario CBC affiliate CKLW-TV, &quot;The Alex Karras Football Show&quot;; his program generally preceded the CBC&#x27;s Wednesday night CFL telecasts. In 1973, Karras made several cameo appearances on the January 8 broadcast of &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;.

Karras returned to acting with roles that included playing Sheriff Wallace in &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; (in which his wife, Susan Clark, also starred), and as western settler Hans Brumbaugh in &quot;Centennial&quot;. He played James Garner&#x27;s closeted gay bodyguard in the 1982 Blake Edwards film &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot;. Karras played a darker role as Hank Sully, the right-hand man of villain Jake Wise (played by James Woods) in the 1984 film &quot;Against All Odds&quot;.

In 1975, Karras appeared on &quot;MNF&quot; colleague Howard Cosell&#x27;s ill-fated variety show &quot;Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell&quot; wearing a wig (a la Mongo) and performing &quot;Already Gone&quot; on the beach with The Eagles who were dubbed the &quot;Alex Karras Blues Band&quot; due to t-shirts the band members wore bearing that moniker. Karras would later host NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night Live in 1985.

Karras&#x27;s television appearances included guest roles on &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; in the episode &quot;The Cache&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; in the episode &quot;Springtime&quot;, &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, and a brief run on &quot;Match Game &#x27;75&quot;. He also signed on to play the character &quot;Super Jock&quot; in commercials for a line of sports action toys named Super Jock, produced by Schaper (1975). In 1977, he was cast in the lead of the TV movie &quot;Mad Bull&quot;.

In 1979, he had the role of Hans &quot;Potato&quot; Brumbaugh, a potato farmer, on the TV miniseries &quot;Centennial&quot;. He was known for his humorous endorsement of La-Z-Boy recliners, in an ad campaign which also featured NFL greats such as Miami Dolphins Coach Don Shula, and New York Jets legend Joe Namath. In the 1980s, Karras had memorable success in the TV sitcom &quot;Webster&quot;, playing George Papadapolis, the title character&#x27;s (Emmanuel Lewis) adoptive father, in a role that showcased his softer side. His real-life wife, Susan Clark, played his fictional wife in the series; Karras and Clark produced the series through their Georgian Bay Entertainment production company. The two met in 1975 while filming the made-for-television biopic &quot;Babe&quot; for CBS.

==Writing==
Besides being one of the subjects of George Plimpton&#x27;s nonfiction book &quot;Paper Lion&quot; (published in 1966), he was one of the two principal subjects of Plimpton&#x27;s follow-up book, &quot;Mad Ducks and Bears&quot; (1973), in which fellow Detroit Lion John Gordy was the &quot;bear&quot; to Karras&#x27;s &quot;mad duck&quot;. Karras named one of his sons after Plimpton. During his last years as a Detroit Lion, Karras wrote a journal of his experiences that was published in the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;. He subsequently wrote a memoir, &quot;Even Big Guys Cry&quot; (1978), and a novel, &quot;Tuesday Night Football&quot; (1991).

==Honors==
In conjunction with the 100 Years of Hawkeye Football celebration in 1989, Iowa Hawkeye fans selected an all-time team. The squad featured 11 players on offense and defense, two kickers, and 15 special-mention players who received strong fan support. Karras was voted to the team as a defensive lineman. He was elected to the Iowa Sports Hall of Fame in 1977 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1991.

On December 12, 2014, the Big Ten Network included Karras on &quot;The Mount Rushmore of Iowa Football&quot;, as chosen by online fan voting. Karras was joined in the honor by Nile Kinnick, Chuck Long, and Tim Dwight.

On October 28, 2018, the Detroit Lions enshrined Karras in the franchise ring of honor along with former Detroit Lions Herman Moore and Roger Brown.

On January 15, 2020, the NFL announced that Karras had been selected for enshrinement in Canton.

==Later activities==
Karras also worked briefly as a football coach in 2007 and 2008. He worked for the SIL as an assistant coach to Bob Lombardi. He owned an ice cream parlor in Surfside Beach, South Carolina, called The Cow.

==Personal life==

Karras was married twice. In 1958, he married Joan Jurgensen, with whom he had five children. The marriage ended in divorce in 1975. He married actress Susan Clark on March 21, 1980, and they had a daughter together.

==Illness and death==
In his later years, Karras suffered from dementia, heart disease, and cancer.

Karras was among 3,500 former NFL players who filed lawsuits against the NFL in early 2012, over the long-term damage caused by concussions and repeated hits to the head.

On October 8, 2012, it was revealed by friend Tom McInerney that Karras had been diagnosed with kidney failure. He was treated at the Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California, before being released into hospice care. After returning to his Los Angeles home with family, Karras died in the morning hours of October 10.

<doc id="880258" wikidata="Q7228246" url="?curid=880258" title="Pontiac V8 engine">
<text>The Pontiac V8 engine is a family of overhead valve 90° V8 engines manufactured by the Pontiac Division of General Motors Corporation between 1955 and 1981. The engines feature a cast-iron block and head and two valves per cylinder. Engine block and cylinder heads were cast at Saginaw Metal Casting Operations then assembled at Tonawanda Engine before delivery to Pontiac Assembly for installation.

Initially marketed as a , it went on to be manufactured in displacements between and in carbureted, fuel injected, and turbocharged versions. In the 1960s the popular version, which had helped establish the Pontiac GTO as a premier muscle car, was cut in half to produce an unusual, high-torque inline four economy engine, the Trophy 4.

Unusual for a major automaker, Pontiac did not have the customary &quot;small-block&quot; and &quot;big-block&quot; engine families common to other GM divisions, Ford, and Chrysler. Effectively, production Pontiac V8 blocks were externally the same size (326-455) sharing the same connecting rod length 6.625 in (168.3 mm) and journal size of 2.249&quot; (except for the later short deck 301 and 265 produced in the late 1970s and early 1980s before Pontiac adopted universal GM engines). The crankshaft stroke and main journal size changed among the years with the more popular 389CI and 400CI having a 3.00&quot; diameter main journal and the 421/428/455 sharing a larger 3.25&quot; diameter main journal.

The V8 was phased out in 1981, replaced by GM &quot;corporate engines&quot; such as the Chevrolet 305 cu in small block V8.

==History==
===Pre-development===
Pontiac began as a &quot;companion make&quot; to the Oakland division of the General Motors line of automobiles in 1926. Pontiac successfully competed against more-expensive inline four-cylinder models with their inline flathead six-cylinder engines. After outselling Oakland, Pontiac became the sole survivor of the two by 1932. In addition to the inline 6, Pontiac used the Oakland V8 for one year, 1932, debuting the Pontiac straight-8 engine in 1933. The two inline engines were used through 1954, when Pontiac unveiled its OHV Strato Streak V8 in 1955. The development of this V8 dates back to 1946, when engineers began considering new engine designs for postwar cars. They came up with a L-head design. Pontiac engineers tested their V8 in 1949 or 1950 against an OHV Oldsmobile Rocket V8 downsized to . The results showed Pontiac that an L-head simply couldn&#x27;t compete with an overhead valve engine.

Despite their work, the division&#x27;s conservative management saw no immediate need to replace the Pontiac Straight-8 until later in the 1950s. The concept car Pontiac Strato-Streak was used to introduce the V8 and in later years the engine was installed in Pontiac products.

In 1955, Pontiac engineers had noted the new engine&#x27;s long development period, and that styling trends’ constraints upon engine size had been a primary consideration: “The new Pontiac engine is the culmination of nine years of design and development work. In 1946, it became evident that future styling requirements, coupled with prospects for improved fuels, necessitated the eventual introduction of a more compact, more rigid engine, and an engineering program was initiated with those goals in mind.”

===Development===
By 1949 work on a OHV V8 had begun, but moved along slowly. When Robert Critchfield took over as general manager in 1952, he launched an ambitious plan to move Pontiac into the upscale, mid-range market occupied by Oldsmobile, and that demanded V8 power. A new engine was fast-tracked, its relatively late start allowing it to take advantage of developments proven in the Oldsmobile V8 and Cadillac V8. As a result, it was remarkably free of teething problems. During 1951–1952, Pontiac had 23 V8-equipped 1953 model production prototypes running tests on the GM proving grounds. Pontiac planned to produce the 1953 models with the V8, but Buick and Chevrolet appealed to GM management and earned a 2-year delay. Buick desiring to have the only GM division to introduce it&#x27;s V8 engine in 1953, and Chevrolet desiring to not be the only GM division without a V8 engine for 1954.

The main innovation of the Pontiac engine was reverse-flow cooling and the stamped rocker-arm system, which had been devised by Pontiac engineer Clayton Leach in 1948. At the request of Ed Cole, general manager of Chevrolet, the layout was also used by the Chevrolet V8 released in 1955, an exception to the customary GM policy of allowing a division one year of exclusive use of an internally developed advance.

Displacement began at and grew as large as by 1970. Pontiac continued to manufacture its own engines, distinct from Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, or Oldsmobile, until 1981. Pontiac engines were used in its U.S.-market cars; Canadian-built Pontiac automobiles generally used Chevrolet engines. From 1955 through 1959, the Pontiac V8 was also used in some GMC pick-up trucks including the 1958/59 336 cubic-inch versions of the 370CI and 389CI engines. Federal emissions standards and the drive towards &quot;corporate&quot; engines shared among all GM divisions led to the progressive demise of the Pontiac V8 through the late 1970s. The last &quot;true&quot; Pontiac V8s, a , ended production in early 1981.

==Design==
The 1955-up Pontiac V8 that finally reached the public was an overhead valve engine with cast iron cylinder heads and block and wedge-shaped combustion chambers. An innovative design feature was mounting the rocker arms on ball pivots on studs set into the cylinder head, rather than using a separate rocker shaft. Along with being cheaper to build, this allowed with less weight than a conventional shaft.

All Pontiac V8s from 1955 to 1959 were reverse cooled, known as the &quot;gusher&quot; cooling system. It was removed from the design for the 1960 model year because designers moved the generator and the power steering pump from atop the front of the engine down to the front of the heads to accommodate a lower hoodline. However, the 1959 389 engines had the generator in front of the heads with reverse flow cooling still in use.

Pontiac differed from other GM Divisions and most other manufacturers in producing only a single sized V8 casting, rather than adding a larger big block to its line-up. The external dimensions of all their V8s, from were the same. Engine displacement is a function of bore and stroke. Pontiac&#x27;s V8s share the same connecting rod length, with the exceptions of the later short deck 301, 265, and 303 Ram Air V.

Most Pontiac V8s had an overall length (to the edge of the water pump pulley) of , an overall width of , and a height (not including air cleaner) of . Dry weight ranged from , depending on displacement and year. Most Pontiac engines were painted light blue. The 1958 370&quot; engine and the 1959–60 389 version was named the &quot;Tempest&quot; V-8 and changed in 61 to the &quot;Trophy&quot; V8. Pontiac in the 1950s was one of a few US manufacturers that did not regularly identify their engine names and sizes with air-cleaner or valve-cover decals.

==Small-journal engines:1955-1981==
===287===
The V8 engine was introduced for the 1955 model year as the &quot;Strato Streak&quot;. Not long before the model year introduction, Pontiac management decided that the entire line would be V8-powered. This was based on results of over 1 million test miles, which was unheard of at the time. The 287 was an &quot;oversquare&quot; engine with a bore and stroke of , for a total displacement of and a main bearing diameter of 2.5 inches. Compression ratio was a modest 8.00:1, with valve diameters of (intake) and (exhaust). It was rated at 4600 rpm and at 2400 rpm with a two-barrel carburetor, at 4600 rpm and at 2800 rpm with the four-barrel carburetor.

===317===
For 1956 the V8 was bored out to , increasing displacement to . A factory 285HP version was built specifically for NASCAR competition, and soon offered as an optional engine in the following forms:

(with manual transmission)
* Two-barrel carburetor, 7.9:1 compression, at 4400 rpm, at 2800 rpm
* Four-barrel carburetor, 8.9:1 compression, at 4800 rpm, at 2800 rpm
* Dual Four-Barrel carburetor, 10.0:1 compression, 285 hp at 5100 rpm, 330 lbft at 3600 rpm.

(with Hydramatic automatic )
* Two-barrel carburetor, 8.9:1 compression, at 4600 rpm, at 2600 rpm
* Four-barrel carburetor, 8.9:1 compression, at 4800 rpm, at 3000 rpm
* Two four-barrel carburetors, 10.0:1 compression, at 5100 rpm, at 3600 rpm.

===347===
For 1957 the V8&#x27;s stroke was increased to , for a displacement of and the main bearing size was increased to 2.625. For the first time, Pontiac offered Tri-Power, three two-barrel carburetors with a sequential linkage (replacing the previous dual-quad set-up). Power ratings increased with the increase in displacement and compression ratio:

(with manual transmission)
* Two-barrel carburetor, 8.5:1 compression, at 4600 rpm, at 2300 rpm
* Four-barrel carburetor, 10:1 compression, at 4800 rpm, at 2600 rpm

(with Hydramatic)
* Two-barrel carburetor, 10.0:1 compression, at 4800 rpm, at 2600 rpm
* Four-barrel carburetor, 10.25:1 compression, at 4800 rpm, at 2900 rpm
* Three two-barrel carburetors, 10.75:1 compression, at 5000 rpm, at 2800 rpm.

Several dealer-installed camshafts were optional to increase power further to . which was seen on the hood of the 1957 Daytona Grand National winning car driven by Cotton Owens.

Standard only for the Pontiac Bonneville was Pontiac&#x27;s first-ever fuel injection system. A mechanical system built by Rochester, it was similar in principle, but not identical, to a contemporary system offered as an option on the Chevrolet Corvette. Pontiac did not release official power ratings for this engine, saying only that it had more than . Contemporary road tests suggest that it was actually somewhat inferior to the Tri-Power engines, although it did have better fuel economy. Only 630 Bonnevilles were produced for 1957, all of them fuel-injected.

===370===
For 1958 the V8&#x27;s bore was increased again to , increasing displacement to . The engine was dubbed the TEMPEST V-8, a nickname it retained until the end of 1960.

The fuel-injected engine became an option on any Pontiac model, carrying a staggering price tag of $500 (almost 15% of the car&#x27;s base price). It was rated at at 4800 rpm and at 3,000 rpm on 10.5:1 compression. Only about 400 were produced before the fuel injection system was quietly dropped.

===389===
For 1959 the V8&#x27;s stroke was increased to , raising displacement to and the main bearing size was increased to 3.00 inches. The large increase in the main bearing size was due to replacing the forged crankshafts for all engines except the SD racing versions with the introduction of an &quot;Armasteel&quot; cast steel crankshaft; and the engineers being very conservative in how strong the cast crankshaft would prove to be. The &quot;Armasteel&quot; cast crankshaft was the first cast crankshaft introduced by any of the Detroit automakers and the standard hardened cast-iron crankshaft used throughout the entire Pontiac V-8 line until 1967. &quot;Armasteel&quot; was a trademark of pearlitic malleable iron developed by GM&#x27;s Saginaw Metal Casting Operations around 1936, which was referred to as &quot;locking ball&quot; cast-iron, as opposed to the &quot;flaking&quot; type found in other engines. In 1967, Pontiac moved on to a technologically simpler nodular cast iron (invented in late 1940s) crankshaft, which they continued to use until the Pontiac V8 engine was discontinued in 1982.The SD racing program was the source of factory supplied performance items such as 4 bolt main bearing caps and windage trays to reduce friction from crankcase oil. The 389 would remain the standard Pontiac V8 engine through 1966, offered in a bewildering variety of outputs ranging from . The 389 was the standard engine for the Pontiac Grand Prix and Pontiac Bonneville and installed in the Pontiac GTO through 1966. Beginning in 1961 the Pontiac V-8 (389 and 421) was dubbed the Trophy V-8, due to its many victories in racing.

====Trophy 4====
Perhaps the most unusual variation of the Pontiac V8 was the 1961-63 &quot;Trophy 4&quot;, which was a 45-degree inclined inline-4 created from the right bank of the 389 for the debut of the Tempest. With an identical bore and stroke of and it was precisely half the displacement of the 389 and shared numerous parts with the V8, yet weighed considerably more than half as the engine lower half and block casting were not simply divided down the middle.

=== 326/336===

In 1963 Pontiac dropped the Buick division built 215 cu. in. aluminum V8 it had offered in the Tempest and replaced it with a small-bore version of the standard Pontiac V8. It shared the 389&#x27;s stroke, but its bore was for a displacement of . It was rated at with 8.6:1 compression and at 10.25:1 compression. Both used a single two-barrel carburetor. In 1964 when the new &quot;A&quot; body intermediates came out there was a new corporate (GM) engine size limitation to anything less than . and so the 326 bore size was reduced to , giving a true . The 326 subsequently became the optional V8 engine for Tempests, and later the Pontiac Firebird, through 1967 and maintained the 17 degree cylinder head valve angle for its entire production run.

A higher-output four-barrel carburetor version was offered, called the 326 HO (High Output). With higher compression and dual exhaust it produced for 1963–1964, and for 1965 through 1967, its final year.

===400===

For 1967, Pontiac retired the and replaced it with the 400 cu in (), a 389 bored-out by + to and retaining its stroke of . The 400 remained in production through the 1978 model year, with 1979 cars receiving engines produced the previous year.

In basic 2-barrel form it produced 290 horsepower and 428 ft. pounds of torque in 1968. This was the engine installed in the Pontiac Executive line of large cars and its largest station wagon, the Pontiac Safari.

In 1967, the cylinder head design was improved for the 400 4-barrel engine. The valve angle was reduced from 20 degrees to 14 degrees for better breathing. 1967 was the last year for closed-chambered heads. The &quot;670&quot; head was a 1967-only casting, and the only PMD head to have a closed chamber with the new 14 degree valve angle. The 400 2-barrel and big car AFB 4 bbl kept the 20 degree valve angles for &#x27;67; starting in &#x27;68 all Pontiac V8s went to the 14 degree valve angle. Pontiac went to open-chambered heads in some 1967 models and all 68 and up to improve power, engine breathing and reduce emissions. The valve size increased as well, to intake and exhaust valves on high-performance heads. Low-performance and two-barrel applications, the standard engine in full-sized Pontiacs, got intake and exhaust valves and pressed in rocker arm studs.

In 1975, to assist in meeting CAFE emissions standards, Pontiac drastically modified the structure and metallurgy of the 400 blocks being produced. The 2bbl option was no longer available, and the sole 400 available for all model lines became the L78 400 with a 4bbl Rochester Quadrajet. This 400 engine was relegated to only produce 185 hp (or less depending on application) for the remainder of its production. These blocks were cast from 1975 through 1977, and were last used in 1978 model year vehicles. The block had metal shaved from the inner journals, and was made with a reduced nickel content to reduce weight from the completed engine with the goal of making the engine lighter, which would in turn reduce the overall weight of the vehicle, alleviating the emissions it produced. These blocks were denoted with casting numbers starting with 500, such as the &quot;500557&quot; blocks found in 1975-78 Firebirds. Pontiac did re-introduce the older, more durable block but the 400 no longer could meet the tightening emissions requirements, and block casting ceased in 1977. These stronger cast blocks were assembled and stockpiled for the 1978 and 1979 Firebirds equipped with the W72 Performance Package.

The four-barrel 400 was a popular performance option for many of Pontiac&#x27;s cars. When fitted with other high-airflow components, it produced a good balance of low-end torque and higher-RPM power. In the 1968 Pontiac GTO it was given a 10.75:1 compression ratio and tuned to deliver 360 horsepower and 445 foot-pounds of torque.

===350===
In 1968 the 326 was replaced by the similarly 389-derived 350, which used a bore and stroke for a total displacement of . Like the 326, it was offered in both 2-barrel and 4-barrel versions. In 1968, a HO option was offered in the Tempest and Firebird. The 1969 HO 350 HO was equipped with the &#x27;s large valve heads (# 48&#x27;s) and the 400 HO camshaft and rated at . In 1974 it was used in the GTO and was rated at (net).

Applications:
* 1968-1977 Pontiac Firebird
* 1968-1977 Pontiac LeMans
* 1968-1981 Pontiac Parisienne
* 1968-1970 Pontiac Tempest
* 1969 Pontiac Custom S
* 1971-1977 Pontiac Catalina
* 1972-1975 Pontiac Ventura
* 1973-1977 Pontiac Grand Prix
* 1974 Pontiac GTO
* 1978 Pontiac Grand Safari

===303===
In 1969, Pontiac unveiled its Trans Am model Firebird, and since racing rules required engines of less than , Pontiac unveiled the 303 for racing models only, never available to the public. Bore and stroke were . It was rated at .

===301===
The 301 was offered from 1977 to 1981 and also installed in other GM cars during those years. The 301 had a bore and stroke of . Based in part on designs for the &quot;short deck&quot; engine designed for the 1970 racing season, it had a shorter deck than the big V8, and used thin-wall castings to reduce weight. The crankshafts were also unique in the fact that they featured only two counter weights instead of the usual five and also featured lightened connecting rod journals. This resulted in a lightweight design weighing less than the Chevrolet small-block V-8. Power output ranged from to . The heads were a new design featuring siamesed intake ports. The short-deck block and different intake ports also required the design of a new intake manifold. The Pontiac 301 EC (Electronic Controls) version offered in 1981 produced and , although it is rumoured that the actual output was closer to . Although it is much different from the original 1955-vintage Pontiac V-8 powerplant, the 301 has the distinction of being the last true Pontiac V-8 engine, as Pontiac ceased production of these engines effective April 1, 1981.

From 1977 to 1981 there were 4 distinct 301 versions:
* 301 2-barrel (), (5th character of the VIN is a &quot;Y&quot; for 1977–1979).
* 301 4-barrel (), (5th character of the VIN is a &quot;W&quot; for 1978–1980, and the 8th for 1981).
* 301 4-barrel &#x27;W72&#x27; or &#x27;ESC&#x27; () (with the 5th character of the VIN being a &quot;W&quot; for 1979-1980 and the 8th for 1981).
* 301 Turbo (), (with the 5th VIN character being a &quot;T&quot;. for 1980, and the 8th being a &quot;T&quot; for 1981).

For 1981 model year vehicles, the engine codes are the 8th digit of the VIN. The 2-barrel version was last offered in 1979. The 4-barrel version was available from 1978 to 1981 and the Turbo version was limited to the 1980 and 1981 model year, however, it was originally intended to be available for the 3rd generation Firebird before its cancellation by GM.

====301 Turbo====

The 301 Turbo was unique since it had a beefier block than the 1977–79 versions (which carried on in the non-turbo versions in 1980 and 1981), a very mild camshaft with lift and 250 degrees gross duration, a oil pump to ensure adequate oil to the oil-cooled Garrett TBO-305 Turbocharger, a rolled fillet crankshaft, a fully baffled oil pan, and a specific Quadrajet carburetor. This had extra-rich &quot;DX&quot; secondary metering rods and a remote vacuum source for the primary metering rod enrichment circuit to allow the Power Enrichment Vacuum Regulator (PEVR) to release the primary metering rods to move to the up position (enrichment) anytime during boosted conditions. This was to ensure there was enough fuel to cool the cast offset dished pistons. Boost was wastegate limited to .

The 301 Turbo package mandated air conditioning, the THM350 (sometimes referred to as the CBC350 in various literature) non-lockup automatic transmission (THM350C lockup in 1981 Trans Ams), and 3.08 rear axle gearing. The 1980 301 Turbo was rated at at 4400 rpm and at 2800 rpm. The 1981 301 Turbo gained the electronic controls with an O2 sensor, feedback ECM and E4ME Quadrajet providing a slight reduction in output to and .The 301 Turbo was limited to Trans Am and Formula Firebird production only.

===265===
Based on the same short-deck as the 301, the &quot;LS5&quot; was offered only in 1980 and 1981. It could only be ordered with a TH200 automatic transmission and a 2bbl configuration. It was implemented as further development of a cost-effective, more fuel efficient V8 derivative of the 301 V8 for the CAFE requirements. It featured a smaller bore of coupled with the same stroke of the 301 (same bore and stroke used by Chevrolet when the first small block motor was introduced in 1955). It produced After 1981, the Pontiac V8 was replaced entirely by the GM &quot;corporate&quot; V8&#x27;s from Chevrolet and Oldsmobile.

==Large-journal engines:1961-1976==
===421===
The was introduced in 1961 as a dealer-installed Super Duty option for racing. Unlike previous enlargements of Pontiac V8s, it did not replace the 389. The first of the &quot;big journal&quot; Pontiac V8s, it had a bore and stroke of and came with dual four-barrel carburetors. It featured main journals (which the legendary Smokey Yunick reputedly left Pontiac&#x27;s engineering department over). The 421 SD became factory installed in 1962 and in 1963 a street version became available from the factory with a dual four-barrel or three two-barrel Tri-Power carburetion. Modified versions of this engine were extensively used in NASCAR stock car racing and drag racing competition. The premier SD 421 cylinder head was the late 1962-early 1963 casting #9771980 aka &quot;980&quot;, featuring a larger intake port volume, flowing at . The 421 HO (High Output) was introduced in 1964 as Pontiac&#x27;s most powerful engine, replacing the 421SD as Pontiac had to discontinue their racing program after the GM board decided that all it&#x27;s divisions had to drop out of racing.

===428===

In 1967 the 421 was enlarged to by increasing its bore to . Both Chevy and Ford had 427 cu in performance engines, so Pontiac simply referred to its 427 as a 428 to one-up them. It retained the 421&#x27;s stroke and main journal.

Offered from 1967 to 1969, it produced in 1967, in 1968 and in 1969. The crankshaft in the 428 had a &quot;N&quot; cast on them (designating nodular steel) as opposed to the 421&#x27;s Armasteel. In 1969, Pontiac also used a revised crankshaft out of a Pearlitic malleable-iron, although it still used the &quot;N&quot; casting letter. This new material had stronger alloys in the iron. All 428 cylinder heads received the 14-degree valve angle; closed chamber only in 1967 and open chamber the next two years.

The 428 was factory installed in large cars only. However, a few dealers would offer them in the GTO or Firebird and do their own installations, such as Royal Pontiac who offered the &quot;Bobcat&quot; conversion. It was replaced by the 455 for the 1970 model year.

===455===
The 428 was increased to in 1970. Again, its bore was expanded, this time to . The stroke increased to . It was rated at , but the Grand Prix with the same specifications was rated at .

The gross horsepower ratings of this era were dubious, with engines rated higher or lower in output for advertising, political, or insurance purposes. Though listed as slightly less powerful than some high-performance iterations of the 400 (such as the Ram-Air), the 455 had of torque, .

The engine was available in all full-size Pontiacs. An HO version could be ordered in the GTO, as GM had lifted its restrictions on offering engines larger than in mid-sized cars (resulting in the Chevrolet Chevelle, Buick Gran Sport, and Oldsmobile 442).

For 1971, Pontiac introduced another High Output (HO) version with standard internal parts, a reinforced block with four-bolt main bearing caps, and improved cylinder head design with intake ports and special round exhaust ports for better breathing, yet still making just gross (or in the more accurate SAE Net system). Standard in the Firebird Trans Am, it was still a rare engine.

In 1973 a further refined and even stronger version, the Super Duty (SD) engine, was planned for Firebird, Grand Am, Le Mans (GTO), and Grand Prix models. The SD-455 used round-port cylinder heads similar to those used on the 1971 and 1972 455 HO, with specific &quot;LS-2&quot; intake and cast-iron exhaust header manifolds. Still, it was the strongest American engine offered that year. Pontiac&#x27;s initial plans were to use a camshaft with specs identical to the 041 Ram Air IV camshaft, but testing showed emissions, while technically compliant, did not have &quot;cushion&quot; to satisfy Pontiac&#x27;s emissions engineers, to avoid production variation leading to any non-compliant engines being produced and sold. Though a change of camshaft would delay production, Pontiac decided to change camshaft, employing one with identical timing to the 744 camshaft, which had been used in the 400 Ram Air(aka Ram Air III) engine with manual transmissions. As a result, peak horsepower dropped from 310 to 290, though torque increased from 390 to 395 lb. ft. After the SD-455 was certified with the new cam, it was production-ready but was then further delayed by the EPA mandating Pontiac recertify all of its engines when the EPA discovered that part-throttle emissions exceeded the limits. Thus in March 1973 Pontiac eliminated a timing solenoid that gave full vacuum advance and disabled the EGR valve in high gear after a period of time that happened to exceed the running time of the EPA testing cycle. Once corrected the SD-455 was recertified and was released for production in late April 1973. Given how late in the model year it was, Pontiac decided not to incur the costs of recertifying the SD-455 for other models other than the Firebird. Ultimately Pontiac produced only 295 1973 SD-455 Firebirds (252 Trans Am, 43 Formula). For 1974 another 1,001 (943 Trans Am, 58 Formula) were built, after which the SD-455 was discontinued.

An evolution of the RA IV and H.O. designs, the SD-455 was a much improved engine. In addition to the more refined cylinder heads, block casting reinforcements in the lifter galley and main bearing oil pan rail area, it had forged connecting rods with larger bolts. Made with a provision for dry sump oiling, it truly was a racing engine, detuned for use in passenger cars.

The 455 was used through 1976 when it, as with many other large displacement engines, was discontinued as manufacturers moved to smaller, more efficient models, even in their full size car lines.

==HO engines==
===326 HO===
A higher-output version was offered, called the 326 HO (High Output). It had a four-barrel carburetor, dual exhaust, and higher compression, and was good for for 1963–1964, and for 1965 - 1966 and the final year, 1967.

===350 HO===
In 1968, there was also a 350 &quot;HO&quot; which had increased power with the addition of higher compression #18 heads (#17 and #46 were the most common 2-barrel heads), a four-barrel carburetor and matching intake that was also used on the 400 and 428 engines. There was also the addition of dual exhaust, and for vehicles equipped with a manual transmission, a slightly more aggressive camshaft.

In 1969 the 350 HO was upgraded again with the addition of the 400 HO cam, commonly referred to by enthusiasts as the 068 cam. Also added was the #48 casting number heads with a chamber for higher compression, along with larger valves. Free-flowing exhaust manifolds from the 400 Ram Air were used late in the model year. This was underrated at .

===400 HO===
Officially named the Quadra-Power 400 for 1967 and renamed 400 HO for 1968, the 400 HO was first offered for 1967 as the third engine in the GTO line after the automatic-only 400 2-barrel and the standard 400 4-barrel (the 400 HO would not be offered in the Firebird until the 1968 model year). For the 1967 GTO the engine was rated at and had the cast-iron headers. The camshaft was the HO cam with 288/301 duration. It was the top-of-the-line engine unless one opted for the &quot;Ram Air&quot; V-8 derived from it. As Pontiac&#x27;s 1967 performance brochure said, &quot;You can add the Ram Air induction hood scoop and new high output cam and valve springs to the Quadra-Power 400 for better top end breathing.&quot; But the &quot;Ram Air&quot; 400 also mandated steep 4.33:1 gears(or 3.90:1 in Firebird), making the Quadra-Power 400 (400 HO) the top practical street engine option for most drivers. Standard ratio with the 400 was 3.55:1(except 3.36:1 in Firebird for 1969) regardless of transmission(3.23:1 for cars with air conditioning). The 400 HO was offered as an option for 1967-1970 for GTO and 1968-1970 for Firebird. For 1969-1970 GTO the 400 HO included driver operable Ram Air induction and was renamed &quot;400 Ram Air&quot; for 1969 and just &quot;Ram Air&quot; for 1970. In the Firebird Ram Air induction for the 400 HO was a separate option for 1969 (included with Trans Am) and included with the engine(optional in Formula; included with Trans Am) in 1970.

===400 W72 &quot;T/A 6.6&quot;===
At the end of 1976, Pontiac was no longer able to continue production of the 455 (7.5 L) V8 motor due to the tightening emissions requirements. As Pontiac still wanted to offer a performance motor to compete in the performance market, they looked back to the 400 Pontiac and how it could be improved to offer greater performance while meeting CAFE standards.

In 1977 the T/A 6.6, (RPO code W72) was created to fulfil the performance engine gap in the Pontiac line-up. The W72 offered many improvements over the standard L78 400 Pontiac. One of the key upgrades were the 6x4 heads. The standard head seen on an L78 400 Pontiac was the low compression 6x8 head, while the 6x4 head seen on the W72 had hardened valve seats for a higher RPM operating range, improved air flow, and higher compression. These heads can be distinguished from 6x8 heads through a small stamped &quot;4&quot; on the top of the front boss. The head design was incorporated from the earlier 1970s 350 Pontiac heads, and could satisfy emissions in all states except for high-altitude emissions states and California. The W72 also featured a camshaft with a higher duration, finer tuned 800cfm Rochester Quadrajet, insulated fuel line, larger 60PSI oil pump, chrome valve covers, a larger harmonic balancer, and the &quot;T/A 6.6&quot; Shaker decal. All of these improvements provided the W72 with a power rating of at 3600 rpm and of torque at 2400 rpm, while the standard L78 400 only produced at 3600 rpm and of torque at 1600 rpm.

The W72 engine was standard in all 1977 Pontiac Can Ams (bar the 1977 Can Ams sold in California/High Altitude states which received the L80 Oldsmobile 403) and was optional in all 1977-79 Pontiac Firebird Formula and Trans Am models. The W72 package was a standalone option, and although was discounted when ordered in conjunction with the Y82/Y84/Y88 Special Appearance package, did not come included with Special Edition Trans Ams, it remained an extra cost option. With some WS6 &quot;Trans Am Special Performance Package&quot; bundles in 1978, the W72 engine was incorporated with the WS6 option group and not listed on the dealer order invoice. However, it can easily be determined by examining the cost price of the option, where the package excluding the W72 engine cost $251, and with the engine, cost extra at $324.

All 1977-1978 Trans Ams ordered with the 4-speed Borg Warner Super T-10 manual transmission received the W72 T/A 6.6 engine. There are no manual transmission equipped Trans Ams that came factory with the standard L78 400 motor in 1977–79. The W72 Performance Package also included an upgrade to the rear differential ratio, setting the rear gear ratio to 3.23 for all 1977 and 1979 W72 Firebirds, with the exception being 3.42 for 4-speed equipped W72 Firebirds in 1978 only.

All W72 equipped Trans Ams featured the &quot;T/A 6.6&quot; shaker decal. A common misconception made by enthusiasts was the notion that all Pontiac engine equipped Trans Ams featured the &quot;T/A 6.6&quot; decal on the shaker, however, it was exclusive to the W72 engine that was featured on less than half of all Trans Ams made during this period. All L78 Pontiac 400 equipped cars received the same shaker decal as the L80 Oldsmobile 403, being &quot;6.6 LITRE&quot;. This may have been propagated by the only authorized company that is licensed to reproduce these decals not including the &quot;6.6 LITRE&quot; in the Trans Am decal kits, and only including &quot;T/A 6.6&quot; with no extra cost.

For the 1978 model year, Pontiac re-incorporated the earlier thicker cast cast engine block denoted by the cast number 418988 and a &quot;XX&quot; cast into the side of the block. The earlier 1975-78 blocks had metal shaved from the journals and bottom end as well as a decrease in the nickel content of the block in an attempt to decrease the overall weight of the vehicle to help alleviate emissions and cost. The camshaft was also revised to have a slightly higher duration, the carburetor jets tuned and a dual exhaust was implemented allowing the power to increase to at 4000 rpm and of torque at 2800 rpm. By mid-1978, the W72 could no longer be ordered in conjunction with the MX1 3-speed Turbo-Hydramatic 350 automatic transmission, and could only be ordered with the 4-speed manual transmission.

By 1979, Pontiac was no longer allowed to produce the 400 engine as emissions further tightened. Pontiac had prepared for the forthcoming cancellation of the venerable 400 by producing large volumes of the stronger cast &quot;XX&quot; 400 blocks in 1977 that were assembled in 1978, and stockpiled at a warehouse by the assembly plant for later use. The 1979 Firebird model line was the last year for the Pontiac 400, and by this point not only was it required with the 4-speed manual transmission, it also required the WS6 Special Handling Package as mandatory equipment. The W72 was only available for a very short time, with the majority of 1979 model year W72 Firebirds ordered in late 1978. By early 1979, orders for the W72 package were being rejected by dealers as they supply had run dry. Instead, they were substituted with the L80 Oldsmobile 403, or the L37 Pontiac 301 if they still requested a 4-speed transmission. On the invoicing for the 1979 model year Firebirds, they had the option listed as L78, however, every 1979 400 equipped car received a W72 engine.

According to the June 2019 issue of &quot;Muscle car Review&quot; magazine, during dyno testing performed during that era, the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) rated this Pontiac W72 400 T/A 6.6 engine at 260 to 280 net horsepower instead of the 220-hp rating published by Pontiac. The 1979 W72/WS6 equipped Trans Am was considered to be one of the overall best performing cars of the decade due to having a powerplant that produced more power than any other competitor on the market at the time with handling equipment to supplement the performance.

===421 HO===
First offered as an option in 1963, the 421 HO came in a 4-barrel engine of and one Tri-Power HO version with a hotter cam and efficient iron exhaust manifolds and rated at . Pontiac offered this to the public as a streetable version of the 421 SD. The engine came with 543797 (4-barrel) and 9770716 heads for the tri-power and special exhaust manifolds and a 7H cam with 292deg. intake duration and later 1964 L with 288deg intake essentially the same as the 068 cam. #9770716 aka &quot;716&quot; heads featured a 170cc intake port volume, and were considered a milder &quot;street&quot; version of the vaunted SD421 Super Duty heads. These same heads were also used on the 1964 GTO 389 tri-power engines. By 1965 and 1966 the same combinations would be rated at for the 4bbl and the two Tri-Power versions would be rated at and the HO version at .

=== 428 HO ===
This engine was first offered in 1967 as the top engine option in full-size Pontiacs. It was rated at 376 bhp in 1967 and 390 bhp in 1968 and 1969. For 1967 only Pontiac called this engine the Quadra-Power 428. It was renamed 428 HO for 1968.

===455 HO===
;1970
The 455 HO designation made its debut in 1970; Rated at (depending on which vehicle it was installed into) and of torque, it differed from the regular full sized car 455 by large valve heads with smaller combustion chambers, and a larger camshaft.

The 1970 &#x27;455 HO&#x27; was a conventional &quot;D&quot; port engine. It was rated at 360 hp at 4300 rpm in the GTO and 370 at 4600 rpm in the Grand Prix and other full-size Pontiacs. Ram Air induction was optional in the GTO, though power ratings were unchanged. Late in the model year the Ram Air 455 HO was made an available option for those GTOs with the optional &quot;The Judge&quot; package.

;1971
The &quot;455 HO&quot; moniker took on a whole new meaning with the introduction of the 1971 model year;

Intended as a low compression progression from the previous years Ram Air IV engine, all 1971 455 HO engines used a heavy duty 4 bolt main block, round port cylinder heads (casting #197; with 8.4: compression), &quot;Ram Air&quot; style exhaust manifolds, and a two-part aluminum intake manifold.

The 1971 Pontiac 455 HO was Pontiac&#x27;s first engine to receive a special Rochester Quadra-jet carburetor with specific jetting.

The 1971 455 HO was rated at at 4,800 rpm and of torque at 3,200 rpm (gross).

The 1971 455 HO was available in the Firebird (optional in Formula; standard in Trans Am), the GTO (standard with &quot;The Judge&quot; package), and the 2-door LeMans, LeMans T-37 (including GT-37), and LeMans Sport. Ram Air induction was optionally available with the 455 HO in the Firebird Formula(standard on Trans Am), GTO (standard with &quot;The Judge&quot; package), and 2-door LeMans Sport when the T41 Endura Styling Option was also ordered.

;1972
The 455 HO moniker was again carried over, this time as a near-exact repeat of the 1971 offering, the only changes were the carburetors (they used a conventional unit this year), and the head castings (casting #7F6).

According to GM mandates horsepower was now rated in net figures as opposed to gross, so on paper the 1972 455 HO appeared to have a significant drop in power, but in fact it was very much the same engine, and performance figures reveal this to be true.

The 1972 455 HO was rated at at 4,000 rpm and at 3,200 rpm.

The 1972 455 HO was available in the Firebird (optional in Formula; standard in Trans Am) and 2-door LeMans (including those with the GTO option) and LeMans Sport convertible. Ram Air induction was optionally available with the 455 HO in the Firebird Formula (standard on Trans Am), and the 2-door LeMans (including GTO).

;1975
After the 1974 SD455 was dropped the 1975 Firebird&#x27;s top performance engine was an &#x27;L78&#x27; Pontiac .

Pontiac still offered the regular 455 (RPO L75) in its full sized cars, and after a negative public reaction for dropping the 455 engine, it was re-introduced mid-year as an available option for the 1975 Pontiac Trans Am. However, the engine used in these Trans Ams was the same regular production 455 taken from the big body cars Pontiac was producing, and output 200 HP with a torque rating of 330 lb⋅ft at 2,000 rpm.

The 455 HO package was only available to late model year Pontiac Firebird Trans Am&#x27;s, and was mandatory with a 4-speed transmission. The shaker wore the decals &quot;455 H.O.&quot; like the earlier 1971-1972 motor, but it was not the same motor, and featured standard d-port heads with a very conservative camshaft.

The 1975 455 HO package received some negative press/reviews as some buyers expected to see a return of the 1971-1972 engine, and were disappointed when they received the lower output motor. Upon reflection, many did not consider that it was the only large displacement engine still on offer for any performance car on the market, and reconsidered Pontiac&#x27;s position between the rising CAFE emissions restrictions.

;1976
The L75 455 engine continued as an option into the 1976 model year for the Trans Am, however, Pontiac opted to drop the &quot;H.O.&quot; moniker from the shaker due to the disappointing public approval as the motor was not deemed to be &quot;High Output&quot;.

The 455 was fundamentally the same for the 1976 model year, albeit the shaker decal now just read &quot;455&quot;. This was the last run for the 455 (7.5 L) motor from Pontiac, and production ceased on the 455 this year as it could no longer meet the emissions requirements any longer.

===301 W72 &quot;T/A 4.9&quot;===
While not related to the 400 W72, the concept was the same. The W72 301 was a tuned L37 301 Pontiac V8 with some minor upgrades. All 1980 Trans Ams received this engine as standard with the option to delete this engine choice as a credit option for the standard L37 301. The main upgrade for the engine was the ESC, (Electronic Spark Control) which provided slightly more power at for the 1980–1981 model years. The 1981 rendition of this engine was officially called the 301-EC [EC standing for Electronic Controls] in the 1981 GM factory service manual, removing the need for a W72 option separately as it was now the standard motor, similar to how all W72 engines in 1979 were coded L78.

One of the key modifications over the standard 301 4-barrel was the 301 Turbo block. The 301T block was significantly more durable than the standard 301 block and received a thicker bottom end. This included the ESC (Electronic Spark Control) distributor and controller borrowed from the 301 Turbo, which allowed for higher timing without the penalty of engine damaging pinging or preignition. A larger ram air flex duct to the air cleaner from the left-hand fender, specific carburettor calibration for the Rochester Quadrajet, a &quot;T/A 4.9&quot; callout on the shaker, 60 psi oil pump, and cam similar in grind to the 400 from the 1978–1979 model year were also included. Unfortunately, there were no improvements in the casting number &quot;01&quot; small-valve high-velocity heads, which would have yielded greater improvements in power. Additionally, the 301 W72 never received the option to come equipped with a manual transmission like the standard 301 received in 1979, and disappointingly, production for all Pontiac V8&#x27;s ended soon after as GM sought to &quot;corporatize&quot; engine production.

==Ram Air==
The beginnings of Pontiac&#x27;s iconic Ram Air dynasty began during the 1965 model year. The GTO&#x27;s new hood scoop design, with the inlets centrally located and mounted above the carburetor, provided the opportunity for experimentation. Royal Pontiac developed the prototype of the package on their 1965 GTO drag car and Pontiac picked up the idea and in August 1965 Pontiac offered the new Fresh Air package to dealers consisting of the parts and instructions needed to make the hood scoop functional, including the metal tub to mount to the carburetors and rubber gasket to seal it to the underside of the hood. The Fresh Air package continued into the 1966 model year.

Around January 1966 Pontiac took the next step and began offering as a factory option the XS-code engine. It included a new camshaft with duration increased from 288/302 (No. 068) to 301/313 (No. 744) and a new valve spring package with dampers to positively control valve action. Valve lift stayed at just over 0.400-inch with 1.5:1-ratio rocker arms. The tri-power equipped XS-code 389 was shipped with the Ram Air pan in the trunk, and the dealer had to fit it and cut out the underside of the hood scoop to make it functional. The XS-code 389 was still rated at 360 bhp at 5,200 rpm, same as the more common WS-coded Tri-Power 389, but performance was noticeably improved on acceleration runs. Pontiac engine production records report that 190 XS-code 389 engines were built during the 1966 model year. Whether all were installed in GTOs is unknown.

None of Pontiac&#x27;s Ram Air engines actually enjoyed any true ram air effect. The inlets were all well within the boundary layer that exists close to the surface, so all of these systems would more accurately be described as &quot;outside air induction&quot; systems, benefiting from the intake of cooler, and thus denser, outside air versus the comparatively hotter and less dense air under the car&#x27;s hood.

===Ram Air (1967- mid year 1968)===
Simply called &quot;Ram Air&quot; by Pontiac it was the first in a series of engines available from Pontiac as regular production line options and officially called Ram Air. Hewing to GM&#x27;s standing edict limiting engine size to 400 cu in for its midsize and smaller cars, the (underrated), the 400 cubic inch Ram Air V-8 was the most powerful and advanced option available in the 1967 GTO and Firebird. Its cast &quot;670&quot; heads had taller valve spring heights than the standard D-port heads, and the only 14-degree valve angle closed combustion chamber making these heads unique. It featured the &quot;744&quot; 301/313 camshaft, which offered more duration and overlap than the &quot;HO&quot;. Along with the HO it also had Pontiac&#x27;s famous cast-iron &quot;headers&quot;, which were much better at reducing backpressure than the regular manifolds. The 670 heads were used until May 1967 when they were upgraded to become the &quot;97&quot; heads, which were then replaced late in the model year by the &quot;997&quot; heads which incorporated the upgrades of the &quot;97&quot; heads.

===Ram Air II (1968 1/2)===
The 1968 Ram Air II remained at 400 cu. in., again available only in the GTO and Firebird. It was factory rated at 366 hp at 5,400 rpm and 445 lbs.ft. of torque at 3,800 rpm in the GTO, and 340 HORSEPOWER at 5,300 rpm and 430-lb.ft. of torque at 3,600 rpm in the Firebird, with only a small throttle restrictor tab on the Firebird being different. It was the first engine that incorporated Pontiac&#x27;s round-port head design in a production vehicle, however the intake port was the same as other D-port heads, leaving a head which exhaust port could nearly match the intake at high valve lifts. The Ram Air II also incorporated the first computer-designed camshaft. This camshaft sported a 308-/320-degree duration with lift. This same camshaft was also used in Pontiac&#x27;s 1969–1970 RA IV production cars. However, the RA II was limited to a 1.50:1 rocker ratio, while the RA IV used a 1.65:1 ratio, which yielded significantly greater total lift and, therefore, superior flow and power.

=== 400 Ram Air (1969) / Ram Air (1970), aka Ram Air III ===
Often called the &quot;Ram Air III&quot;, this engine was officially called the &quot;400 Ram Air&quot; for 1969 and then simply &quot;Ram Air&quot; for the 1970 model year. It would later become known colloquially as the &quot;Ram Air III&quot;, though Pontiac never called it by that name. A 400 cubic inch ram air equipped V8, it was an option on the 1969-70 GTO and Firebird Formula. For the 1969 and 1970 model years it was the standard engine in both the Firebird Trans Am and the GTO Judge. It was the same engine as the &#x27;67-&#x27;68 400 HO but for 1969 and 1970 it included a driver-selectable outside air induction system on the GTO(it was a separate option on Firebird), with the hood vents opened and closed using a knob located under the dash, below and to the right of the steering wheel, its bracket labeled &quot;RAM AIR&quot;. It used the &quot;744&quot; camshaft (301-313) in the earlier manual trans versions, later downgraded to the &quot;068&quot; version, and the 288/302 duration cam with automatic transmission. It was rated at (gross) in the GTO version. Like previous generations of Ram Airs, it used Pontiac&#x27;s special cast-iron &quot;headers&quot;. It had 2-bolt main bearing caps in 1969, but went to a block similar to the Ram Air IV&#x27;s in 1969 that was drilled for 4-bolt main bearing caps (but used a cast crank and cast rods). In 1970 the casting number #9799914 Ram Air 400 4-bolt main block also used the 4-bolt main caps on Ram Air applications.

===Ram Air IV (1969-1970)===
The Ram Air IV replaced the Ram Air II in 1969. It was called the Ram Air IV due to the planned use of four air inlets. Though production cars only got the two hood air inlets the name was retained. All 1968–69 #9792506 Ram Air 400 blocks have 4-bolt caps. The Ram Air IV used the Ram Air II&#x27;s camshaft but lift in the Ram Air IV was increased to thanks to the use of 1.65 ratio rocker arms (vs 1.50). The Ram Air IV heads had 1/8&quot; taller intake ports, larger intake port volume with more airflow, yet shared the Ram Air II round exhaust ports. In addition, a shallower spherical-wedge combustion chamber moved the tuliped valve heads .040&quot; closer to the piston at TDC, improving mixture draw considerably during the intake stroke. The Ram Air IV also used a lightweight aluminum intake-manifold that produced a weight savings of . From 1969 though 1970, the Ram Air IV was available in both A-Body (GTO, including Judge) and F-body (Firebird, including Trans Am) form. While production of 1969–70 A-body Ram Air IV cars was low at just 1563 units(759 1969 GTOs including 302 Judges, and 804 1970 GTOs including 397 Judges) 1969 and 1970 model year F-body Ram Air IV cars were even rarer at just 245 total units produced. Only 157 Ram Air IV Firebirds, including 55 Trans Ams, were built for 1969. For 1970 the Trans Am was the only Firebird available with the Ram Air IV, and 88 were produced during the abbreviated 1970 F-body production run. A total of 1,808 Ram Air IV production cars were built over its 2-year production. Pontiac continued using its round-port cylinder-head design for 1971-&#x27;72 on the 455 HO. However, compression ratios were cut dramatically, marking the beginning of the end of the muscle car era.

===Ram Air V===
Though never factory-installed in any car, the ultimate engine of the Ram Air line of engines was the tunnel-port Ram Air V. In 1969 Pontiac created four versions of the Ram Air V engine: a short deck version for SCCA Trans-Am racing, a variant for NASCAR, a version for street use in GTOs and Firebirds, as well as a adaptation for drag racing. The cylinder head design is similar to the Ford FE tunnel-port head used in the GT40 and Can-Am series racing. So large are the intake ports that the pushrods run through the center of each port via pressed-in tubes, in addition to streamlined airfoils over the tubes themselves to improve port shape, and increase flow velocity. The 303 had shorter connecting rods, smaller journals and a solid lifter version of the Ram Air IV camshaft. It adopted a bore with a stroke, shared with the standard deck 303, for a displacement of . The short deck engine weighed about less than the other variants and had an 8000 rpm redline. Pontiac&#x27;s SCCA Trans-Am program was promising, with race-ready engines producing to , however the series’ General Competition Rules required the manufacturer to produce no less than 250 vehicles with the 303. Plans were made to produce Firebirds and GTOs with advertised ratings of and respectively but concerns about emissions, the response of the automobile safety lobby, and the warranty implications of a high-revving street engine led to cancellation of the program. T

While the exact total number of Ram Air V engines produced is not positively known, only about 25 engines were produced and about a dozen 428s and 366s. More engines were produced by Pontiac than the other versions - estimates range from 80 to 200 units. Some 400s were dealer installed.

Parts for Ram Air V engines are not readily available. The cylinder heads on the 400 CID version had an intake port volume of , nearly twice the size of a typical standard D-port Pontiac head - and flowed in the area of at valve lift; in the realm of the NASCAR-dominating Chrysler 426 Hemi.

==Super Duty==
===SD 421===
The 421SD was available in 1961 as a dealer option or over the counter then in 62 and 63 from the factory, and was fitted with a list of internal modifications designed solely to withstand the abuse of drag racing. Cam was a #541596 McKellar No. 10 with 308/320 degrees of duration and with 1.65:1-ratio rocker arms and solid lifters, special #529238 forged-steel connecting rods, forged aluminum bore Mickey Thompson pistons, #542990 forged-steel crankshaft with a stroke and diameter main journals. Dual Carter Carburetor #3433S (front) and #3435S (rear) carburetors with manual chokes and mechanical linkage. Factory heavy-duty high-pressure oil pump and eight-quart sump, four-bolt main bearing caps with Moraine aluminum bearings, and #1110976 dual-point distributor without vacuum advance. Two different cylinder-head castings were used for the 1962 model year, both with a combustion chamber volume of to produce an 11.0:1 compression ratio. Casting No. 540306 featured valves and was carried over from the previous model year, production stopped in March 1962 and then casting No. 544127 with larger valves entered production. Neither casting was equipped with an exhaust crossover.

===SD-455===
Available only in the 1973 and 1974 Firebird Formula and Trans Am, the SD-455 consisted of a strengthened cylinder block that included 4-bolt main bearings and additional material in various locations for improved strength. Original plans called for a forged crankshaft, although actual production SD455s received nodular-iron crankshafts with minor enhancements. Forged rods and forged-aluminum pistons were specified, as were unique high-flow cylinder-heads. A camshaft with 301/313 degrees of advertised duration, net valve lift, and 76 degrees of valve overlap was specified for actual production engines in lieu of the significantly more aggressive Ram Air IV-spec camshaft that had originally been planned for the engine (initially rated at with that cam), but ultimately proved incapable of meeting the tightening emissions standards of the era with sufficient margin to satisfy Pontiac emission engineers given expected volume production variations. The very modest cam, combined with a low-compression ratio of 8.4 (advertised) and 7.9:1 actual resulted in SAE NET. The initial press cars that were given to the various enthusiast magazines (e.g. HOT ROD and CAR AND DRIVER) were fitted with the Ram Air IV-spec camshaft and functional hood scoops - a fact that has been confirmed by several Pontiac sources. Some production test cars ran considerably slower and yielded  times in the 14.5 second/ range in showroom tune (uncited sources)- results that are quite consistent for a car with a curb weight of and the rated SAE NET figure that some sources suggest was &quot;under-rated.&quot; However, in the June 1974 issue of SUPER STOCK AND DRAG ILLUSTRATED, a new 1974 Trans Am with the SD-455 motor ran 14.25 at . This was a completely stock car on loan from a private owner for the test. Furthermore, this car had an automatic, air conditioning, a 3.08 axle and weighed . This test would tend to lend credence to the CAR AND DRIVER and HOT ROD tests of 1973 Super Duty cars with 3.42 gears, no air, and less weight as being representative of production specimens capable of mid to high 13-second passes at . Pontiac listed the rating at 4000 rpm for a motor that had a 5700 rpm redline on the factory tachometer. Various Pontiac sources have emphatically stated that NO versions of the SD-455 were installed in regular production cars. The SD-455 motor was listed as an option in dealer brochures for the 1973 Grand Am and LeMans GTO(and planned for the Grand Prix as well) although none were produced for sale. Nevertheless, there appears in the October 72 issue of MOTOR TREND, a road test of a 1973 SD-455 Grand Am. 1975 Factory Service Manual lists the SD-455, but the SD-455 did not meet emissions for the 1975 model year and was canceled.

==Experimental V8s==
===427 Hemi SOHC===
This was a project started with the end goal of building a 427 Hemi. Pontiac asked Mopar (Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth) for help in designing it and making it work. Surprisingly, Mopar actually agreed and sent over several of the engineers that designed both the 392 and 426 Hemi. The goal of making a Pontiac Hemi succeeded but the engine was never produced.

Features:
* Thin-wall, cast aluminum block
* bore x stroke, 8 cylinders, each having a bore of 4.342 inch and a stroke of 3.75 inch, results in a displacement of 444.21 cubic inches (7,279.34 cc); for the Pontiac OHC 427 Hemi refers to it as a &quot;TOHC&quot; and lists the bore at 4.257 inch—which, with a stroke of 3.75 inch, results in a displacement of very slightly more than 426.99 cubic inches (very slightly more than 6997.124 cc).
* main bearings
* Forged steel rods (Ram Air V style)
* 12:1 compression
* Mechanical Port Fuel Injection
* Large-valve heads (valve diameter): intake, exhaust
* Small-valve high-RPM head (valve diameter) intake, exhaust
* Splayed main caps, head bolts tie into main caps. Head bolts do not pull on the cylinder wall causing distortion.
* Cam drive: fiberglass belt
* Maximum RPM (high-RPM engine): over 8000 rpm 
* Engine weight: estimated complete
* Dimensions:
** width ,
** length 
** height 
* Power: estimated at 7500 rpm

===Pontiac SOHC 421CID V8===
Most likely prompted by its development of the Pontiac OHC six, the GM division built three different experimental SOHC 421 CID V8 engines in the early 1960s. According to the engineers who worked on the project, the SOHC 421 engines produced around 625 hp and were capable of turning 7,000 rpm.

One version of the engine featured camshafts driven off the front of the engine, another design had the cams driven by gears off the back of the engine. Apparently at least one of these engines survives under the hood of an engineer&#x27;s personal Pontiac.

<doc id="880263" wikidata="Q740940" url="?curid=880263" title="Live in New York City (John Lennon album)">
<text>Live in New York City is a posthumous live album by English rock musician John Lennon with the Plastic Ono Elephant&#x27;s Memory Band. It was prepared under the supervision of his widow, Yoko Ono, and released in 1986 as his second official live album, the first being &quot;Live Peace in Toronto 1969&quot;.

&quot;Live in New York City&quot; reached No. 55 in the UK, and No. 41 in the US, eventually attaining a gold certification by RIAA.

==Performances==
Recorded on 30 August 1972 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Lennon performed two shows, one in the afternoon and one in the evening, a benefit concert for the Willowbrook State School for Retarded Children in New York, at friend Geraldo Rivera&#x27;s request. Rivera introduces Lennon and Ono at the beginning of the album, and he is referenced in Lennon&#x27;s impromptu revised lyrics in the opening song, &quot;New York City&quot;.

The benefit concerts, billed as One to One, also featured other performers in addition to Lennon, including Stevie Wonder, Roberta Flack, Melanie Safka and Sha Na Na, although their performances are not included on this album, nor on the simultaneous video release.

&quot;Live in New York City&quot; captures Lennon&#x27;s last full-length concert performance, coming right after the release of &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;. Backing Lennon and Ono were Elephant&#x27;s Memory, who had served as Lennon and Ono&#x27;s backing band on &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;. Although the material Lennon performed was largely drawn from his three most recent albums of the period (&quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot;, &quot;Imagine&quot; and &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;), he also included in the setlist his solo hit &quot;Instant Karma!&quot;, his Beatles hit &quot;Come Together&quot; and paid tribute to Elvis Presley with &quot;Hound Dog&quot; before leading the audience in a singalong of &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;. &quot;Come Together&quot;, originally in the key of D minor, was performed in E minor.

==Criticism and editing==
Upon its early 1986 release, Ono was criticised by former members of Elephant&#x27;s Memory for using the first – and weaker – performance instead of the stronger evening show. They also took issue with the simultaneous video release of the concert, which it was alleged had been edited to show Ono as prominently as Lennon.

However, on the album release, Ono&#x27;s vocal performances on such numbers as &quot;Hound Dog&quot; had been mixed out completely. Additionally, all of her solo performances, which included &quot;Sisters, O Sisters&quot;, &quot;Born in a Prison&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re All Water&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Kyoko (Mummy&#x27;s Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)&quot;, &quot;Move on Fast&quot; and &quot;Open Your Box&quot;, were deleted from the audio edition of the concert, to create a pure Lennon album.

The video release retained the Lennon complete set-list and also included Ono&#x27;s &quot;Sisters, O Sisters&quot; and &quot;Born in a Prison&quot;. Portions of the evening performance later saw release on the &quot;John Lennon Anthology&quot;.

==Historical significance==
The concerts documented on &quot;Live in New York City&quot; were Lennon&#x27;s only rehearsed and full-length live performances in his solo career, and his first – and last – formal, full-fledged live concerts since the Beatles retired from the road in 1966. Lennon never mounted a tour during his post-Beatles career. The concerts also marked the last time he performed live with Ono or with Elephant&#x27;s Memory.

In a contemporary review, &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;This performance, five years before the debut of The Sex Pistols, presaged, among other modern trends, the whole punk movement.&quot; and that &quot;Yoko Ono, the album’s producer, and Capitol are to be commended for bringing these important recordings to the public.&quot;

<text>Isabella Lucy Bishop (; 15 October 1831 – 7 October 1904) was an English explorer, writer, photographer and naturalist. Alongside fellow Englishwoman Fanny Jane Butler, she founded the John Bishop Memorial Hospital in Srinagar in modern-day Kashmir. She was also the first woman to be elected as a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.

==Early life==
Bird was born on 15 October 1831 in Boroughbridge Hall, Yorkshire, the home of her maternal grandmother and her father&#x27;s first curacy after taking orders in 1821. Her parents were Rev Edward Bird (1793-1858; younger brother of the civil servant Robert Merttins Bird) and his second wife, Dora Lawson (1803–1866). Her paternal grandparents were cousins: Robert Bird, of Taplow, Buckinghamshire, married Lucy Wilberforce Bird, daughter of silk merchant John Bird, of Coventry; Lucy&#x27;s brother, the politician William Wilberforce Bird, married Robert Bird&#x27;s sister, Elizabeth. Lucy&#x27;s mother was the aunt of the philanthropist and slavery abolitionist William Wilberforce. The Bird family had established the silk trade at Coventry in the late 1600s, and were themselves silk masters.

Bird lived in several places during her childhood. In 1832, Reverend Bird was appointed curate in Maidenhead. Because of her father&#x27;s ill health, Bird&#x27;s family moved again in 1834 to Tattenhall in Cheshire, a living presented to him by his cousin Dr John Bird Sumner, Bishop of Chester, where in the same year Bird&#x27;s sister, Henrietta, was born.
Bird was outspoken from an early age. When six years old, she confronted the local MP for South Cheshire, Sir Malpas de Grey Tatton Egerton, while he was campaigning, asking him &quot;did you tell my father my sister was so pretty because you wanted his vote?&quot;

Edward Bird&#x27;s controversial views against Sunday labour caused his congregation to dwindle, and in 1842 he requested a transfer to St. Thomas&#x27;s in Birmingham. Here again, objections were raised, which culminated in the minister being pelted &quot;with stones, mud, and insults&quot;.

In 1848, the family moved again and, after spending some time in Eastbourne, took up residence in Wyton in Huntingdonshire (now Cambridgeshire.)

From early childhood, Bird was frail, suffering from a spinal complaint, nervous headaches, and insomnia. The doctor recommended an open-air life, and consequently, Bird learned to ride in infancy, and later to row. Her only education came from her parents: her father was a keen botanist who instructed Bird in flora, and her mother taught her daughters an eclectic mix of subjects. Bird became an avid reader. However, her &quot;bright intelligence, [and] an extreme curiosity as to the world outside, made it impossible for her brain and her nature generally to be narrowed and stiffened by the strictly evangelical atmosphere of her childhood&quot;.

Isabella&#x27;s first publication at the age of 16 was a pamphlet addressing free trade versus protectionism, after which she continued writing articles for various periodicals.

In 1850, a &quot;fibrous tumour was removed from the neighbourhood of the spine&quot;. Bird continued to suffer from unspecified ailments resulting in lassitude and insomnia. The family spent six summers in Scotland in an effort to improve her health.

Doctors urged a sea voyage and in 1854, Bird&#x27;s life of travelling began when the opportunity arose for her to sail to the United States, accompanying her second cousins to their family home. Her father &quot;gave her [£]100 and leave to stay away as long as it lasted&quot;. Bird&#x27;s &quot;bright descriptive letters&quot; written home to her relations formed the basis for her first book, &quot;An Englishwoman in America&quot; (1856), published by Murray. John Murray, &quot;as well as being Isabella&#x27;s lifelong publisher, ... [became] one of her closest friends&quot;.

==Travels in middle life==
 Bird left Britain again in 1872, going initially to Australia, which she disliked, and then to Hawaii (known in Europe as the Sandwich Islands), her love for which prompted her second book (published three years later). While there she climbed Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa. She then moved on to Colorado, where she had heard the air was excellent for the infirm. Dressed practically and riding not sidesaddle but frontwards like a man (though she threatened to sue the &quot;Times&quot; for saying she dressed like one), she covered over 800 miles in the Rocky Mountains in 1873. Her letters to her sister, first printed in the magazine &quot;The Leisure Hour&quot;, comprised Bird&#x27;s fourth and perhaps most famous book, &quot;A Lady&#x27;s Life in the Rocky Mountains&quot;.

Bird&#x27;s time in the Rockies was enlivened especially by her acquaintance with Jim Nugent, &quot;Rocky Mountain Jim&quot;, a textbook outlaw with one eye and an affinity for violence and poetry. &quot;A man any woman might love but no sane woman would marry&quot;, Bird declared in a section excised from her letters before their publication. Nugent also seemed captivated by the independent-minded Bird, but she ultimately left the Rockies and her &quot;dear desperado&quot;. Nugent was shot dead less than a year later. Bird and Jim is a restaurant in Estes Park, Colorado named in their honor.
At home, Bird again found herself pursued, this time by Dr John Bishop, an Edinburgh surgeon in his thirties. She got interested in Japan through John Francis Campbell&#x27;s &quot;My Circular Notes, 1876&quot;, and asked the advice of Colin Alexander McVean, former chief surveyor of Japan&#x27;s Survey Office, in February 1878, then went travelling again, this time to Asia: Japan, China, Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, and Malaya. When her sister Henrietta Amelia Bird died of typhoid in 1880, Bird accepted John Bishop&#x27;s marriage proposal. They were married in February 1881, and later that year she was awarded the Royal Order of Kapiolani by King Kalākaua of Hawaii. Bird&#x27;s health took a severe turn for the worse but, other than a spell of scarlet fever in 1888, it recovered following John Bishop&#x27;s death in 1886, at which point she inherited a large amount of disposable income. Feeling that her earlier travels had been hopelessly dilettante, Bird studied medicine and resolved to travel as a missionary. Despite being nearly 60 years of age, she set off for India.

==Later life==

Arriving on the subcontinent in February 1889, Bird visited missions in India, visited Ladakh on the borders of Tibet, and then travelled in Iran, Kurdistan, and Turkey. In India, the Maharajah of Kashmir gave her a piece of land on which to build a hospital with sixty beds and a dispensary for women; there she worked with Fanny Jane Butler to found the John Bishop Memorial Hospital in memory of her recently deceased husband who had left funds for this purpose in his will. The following year, she joined a group of British soldiers travelling between Baghdad and Tehran. She remained with the unit&#x27;s commanding officer during his survey work in the region, armed with her revolver and a medicine chest supplied – in possibly an early example of corporate sponsorship – by Henry Wellcome&#x27;s company in London. In 1891, she travelled through Baluchistan to Iran and Armenia, exploring the source of the Karun River and later that year, she gave a speech in a committee room of the House of Commons on the persecution of Christians in Kurdistan, on which she had made representations to the Grand Vizier of the Turkish Empire.

Like most other European explorers of her generation, Bird employed large labour forces that did much of the work of transporting her. For instance, in China, she was carried 1,200 miles across the country by a changing group of Chinese men.

Featured in journals and magazines for decades, Bird had, by then, become a household name. In 1890, she became the first woman to be awarded Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. Two years later, she became the first woman allowed to join the Royal Geographical Society. She was elected to membership of the Royal Photographic Society on 12 January 1897. Her final great journey took place in 1897, when she travelled up the Yangtze and Han rivers in China and Korea, respectively. Later still, she went to Morocco, where she travelled among the Berbers and had to use a ladder to mount her black stallion, a gift from the Sultan.

==Death==
A few months after returning from a trip to Morocco, Bird fell ill and died at her home on 16 Melville Street, Edinburgh on 7 October 1904. She was buried with her family in Dean Cemetery in the west of the city. The grave lies in the small curved southern section, near the small path which divides it in two. She was planning another trip to China at the time of her death.

==Legacy==

The first biography of Bird was written by Anne M Stoddart and published in 1907.

Caryl Churchill used Bird as a character in her play &quot;Top Girls&quot; (1982). Much of the dialogue written by Churchill comes from Bird&#x27;s own writings.

Bird was inducted into the Colorado Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1985.

Bird was featured in &quot;Bedrock: Writers on the Wonders of Geology&quot; (2006), edited by Lauret E. Savoy, Eldridge M. Moores, and Judith E. Moores (Trinity University Press) which looks at writing over the years and how it pays tribute to the Earth and its geological features.

Bird is also the main character of the manga &quot;Isabella Bird in Wonderland&quot; (&quot;Fushigi no Kuni no Bird&quot;), a novelization of her travels to Japan; it received a bilingual Japanese-English edition beginning in 2018.

The building of the clock tower on Tobermory, Mull harbour wall was funded by Bird in memory of her beloved sister Henrietta. It was designed by mountaineer and explorer Edward Whymper.

In December 2022, BBC Two broadcast a television programme dedicated to Isabella called &quot;Trailblazers: A Rocky Mountain Road Trip&quot; presented by Ruby Wax who undertook a road trip to retrace her steps in Colorado with Mel B and Emily Atack.

A promotional tourism event held in Kaneyama in July 2023 celebrated Bird&#x27;s travels through Japan by &quot;retracing Bird&#x27;s actual route along the Ushu Kaido road near the Uwadai mountain pass.&quot;

<text>Frankie Ford (born Vincent Francis Guzzo, Jr.; August 4, 1939 – September 28, 2015) was an American rock and roll and rhythm and blues singer, best known for his 1959 hit &quot;Sea Cruise&quot;.

==Biography==
He was born in Gretna, Louisiana, across the Mississippi River from New Orleans, and was the adopted son of Vincent and Anna Guzzo, who named him Vincent Francis Guzzo, Jr. He learned to sing and dance at an early age, and when at high school joined a group, the Syncopators, as singer and pianist. He was spotted by manager Joe Caronna, who took him to Johnny Vincent of Ace Records. Taking the stage name Frankie Ford, he made his first recordings for Ace in 1958. He toured locally in Louisiana, before recording a vocal overdub on the song &quot;Sea Cruise&quot;, a song written and originally recorded by Huey &quot;Piano&quot; Smith with his group, the Clowns, and featuring overdubbed bells and ships&#x27; horns. As Smith already had a record in the charts, and was away touring, the record label decided to release Ford&#x27;s version, and it rose to #14 on the US pop chart and #11 on the R&amp;B chart, selling over one million copies, and gaining gold disc status.

Ford toured widely around the US, but his later records were less successful, with his versions of &quot;Alimony&quot; and &quot;Time After Time&quot; only reaching the lower reaches of the national charts. He also recorded a novelty record in praise of a local TV presenter, &quot;Morgus the Magnificent&quot;, with musicians including Mac Rebennack and Jerry Byrne, but it failed to sell. Ace released an LP by Ford, &quot;Let&#x27;s Take A Sea Cruise With Frankie Ford&quot;, before the singer moved to Imperial Records in late 1960. He recorded with producer Dave Bartholomew, and released a version of &quot;You Talk Too Much&quot;, but Ford&#x27;s recording missed out in competition with one by Joe Jones which was issued almost simultaneously. In 1961, his version of Boyd Bennett&#x27;s 1955 hit &quot;Seventeen&quot; was Ford&#x27;s last chart entry.

Ford was drafted in 1962, and performed for troops in Japan, Vietnam and Korea. He later recorded occasionally for small labels, but mainly performed in clubs in and around New Orleans. He appeared in the 1978 movie &quot;American Hot Wax&quot;, and toured in Britain and Europe, recording the album &quot;New Orleans Dynamo&quot; in London in 1984. He continued to record and perform through the 1990s. Ford co-owned the Briarmeade record label, which issued several singles and albums by him from the 1970s to the 2000s. On May 16, 2010, at the Louisiana Music Homecoming in Erwinville, Ford was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.

Ford died in Gretna at the age of 76 on September 28, 2015, following a long illness.

<doc id="880268" wikidata="Q183174" url="?curid=880268" title="King–Byng affair">
<text>The King–Byng affair was a Canadian constitutional crisis that occurred in 1926, when the governor general of Canada, Lord Byng of Vimy, refused a request by the prime minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, to dissolve parliament and call a general election.

The prime minister (leader of the Liberal Party) and the governor general agreed in October 1925 that, prior to a new election being called, the Conservative Party should be given the chance to form a government because it had a plurality in the House of Commons. But meanwhile King&#x27;s Liberals were given chance to govern, as they had conditional support from the many Farmer/Progressive MPs together at first that gave them majority support in the House of Commons. When the King government was about to lose a vote in the House of Commons in June 1926, King asked Governor General Byng to dissolve parliament anyway, without giving Conservative the promised opportunity. 

Byng refused King&#x27;s request. Prime Minister King resigned, and the governor general invited the Conservative Party to form a government. The Meighen government lost a motion of no confidence on 2 July 1926, and the governor general then agreed to dissolve parliament. Following the election on 14 September, King again assumed the office as prime minister, with a minority government.

The crisis came to redefine the role of governor general throughout the Dominions of the British Empire, becoming a major impetus in negotiations at Imperial Conferences held in the late 1920s that led to the adoption of the Statute of Westminster 1931. According to constitutional convention until then, the governor general represented the sovereign both in his imperial council and in his Canadian council, but the convention evolved afterwards into a tradition of non-interference in Canadian political affairs on the part of the British government. After 1931, the governor general remained an important figure in Canadian governance as a constitutional watchdog, but the role was shorn of its previous imperial duties.

==Background==

In September 1925, William Lyon Mackenzie King, the Prime Minister of Canada, advised the Governor General, the Lord Byng of Vimy, to dissolve parliament and drop the writ for a general election, to which Lord Byng agreed. In the subsequent election, held on 29 October, Arthur Meighen&#x27;s Conservative Party won 116 seats in the House of Commons to 101 for King&#x27;s Liberals. The Progressive Party, an agrarian centre-left party, won 22 seats.

Meighen declared victory, but King did not resign. The previous parliament, formed after the 1921 general election, had seen King frequently cooperate with members of the Progressive Party to maintain a majority. Although the Progressives&#x27; numbers had also been substantially reduced (from 58), they continued to hold the balance of power in the chamber, and King was confident this informal arrangement could continue even though the Liberals were no longer the largest party.

On 30 October, King visited Byng after consulting with the rest of Cabinet and informed the Governor General that his government would continue until parliament decided otherwise. Byng, who had suggested to King that he ought to resign with such a tenuous mandate, later stated he told the Prime Minister: &quot;Well, in any event you must not at any time ask for a dissolution unless Mr Meighen is first given a chance to show whether or not he is able to govern&quot;, to which Byng believed King acquiesced, but King denied took place.

While Meighen and other Conservatives expressed public outrage at what they viewed as a desperate attempt on the part of King to cling to power, some Conservatives were privately relieved by King&#x27;s decision; they seriously doubted whether the Tories could convince the Progressives to support a Conservative minority government, were confident that King&#x27;s attempt to remain in power would eventually fail, and thought the expected debacle would be so damaging to the Liberals&#x27; reputation that the Conservatives would then be swept into office with a majority.

===Customs scandal===
A few months later, one of King&#x27;s appointees in the Department of Customs and Excise was revealed to have taken bribes, after which the Conservatives alleged that the corruption extended to the highest levels of government, including the prime minister. King had already replaced the Minister of Customs and Excise, Jacques Bureau, with Georges Henri Boivin, but recommended that Byng appoint Bureau to the Senate. This alienated Progressive members who were already distancing themselves from the government because of its failure to transfer control of Alberta&#x27;s natural resources from the federal government to the province.

The Progressive Party&#x27;s support was temporarily retained by the formation of a special committee to investigate the corruption in the customs department. Its report, which was presented to the House of Commons, acknowledged that there was widespread fraud in the department but did not specifically criticize the government. A Conservative Member of Parliament, H. H. Stevens, proposed an amendment to the report which would effectively censure the government and compel it to resign. However, Labour MP J. S. Woodsworth proposed amending Stevens&#x27; amendment to remove the censure of the government and set up a Royal Commission to investigate the customs department further. The motion was defeated, despite the full support of the government. A Progressive MP, W. R. Fansher, then proposed that a Royal Commission be combined with the original motion of censure. The Speaker of the House ruled the motion out of order, but, on division, the members over-ruled the speaker and the Cabinet was defeated again. After a motion that the House adjourn, put forward by a Progressive member at King&#x27;s behest, was subsequently also voted down, King announced that he would accept Fansher&#x27;s amendment and secured an adjournment.

===Request for dissolution===
To avoid the inevitable vote on the Fansher amendment, which would either force his government&#x27;s resignation or bring his administration into disrepute, King went to Byng on 26 June 1926 seeking a dissolution of parliament. Byng, citing his reserve powers, stated he was inclined to refuse the request, reminding King of their agreement made the previous October and arguing that the Conservatives, as the largest party in parliament, should have a chance to form a government before an election was called. For the next two days, the Prime Minister and the Governor General discussed the matter, with Byng asking King not to request a dissolution which he could not give and King twice requesting that Byng consult the British government prior to making any decision. Byng again refused, saying the matter should be settled in Canada, without resort to London. With Byng remaining steadfast, King formally presented the Governor General with an Order in Council for the dissolution of parliament on June 28, which Byng declined to sign, on the grounds that the House of Commons should first be given the opportunity to decide if it could support a different government.

Having been refused his formal request, King resigned. Byng then invited Conservative leader Arthur Meighen to form a government. Although many Conservatives privately preferred an election, Meighen believed he was bound by honour and convention to accept Byng&#x27;s invitation and formed a Cabinet.

At that time, convention dictated that the ministers of the Crown drawn from the House of Commons were obliged upon appointment to resign their seats in parliament and run for re-election in by-elections. This posed a problem for Meighen: his and the other ministers&#x27; temporary absence from the House would make the government extremely vulnerable in the event of a vote of non-confidence. Meighen circumvented this by advising the appointment to Cabinet of ministers without portfolio, who were not required to run for re-election. Progressives and Liberals saw the use of &quot;acting ministers&quot; as against the spirit of the convention, and moved for no-confidence in Meighen&#x27;s government, which lost confidence by only one vote at 2 am on 2 July 1926.


Meighen subsequently requested a dissolution of parliament, which was granted by Byng on 2 July, and an election was called for 14 September. King&#x27;s Liberals won a plurality of seats in the House of Commons, while Meighen lost his seat.

==Legacy==
Upon returning to power, King&#x27;s government sought at an imperial conference to redefine the role of the governor general as a personal representative of the sovereign in his Canadian council and not of the British government (the king in his British council). The change was agreed to at the Imperial Conference of 1926 and came to be official as a result of the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and Statute of Westminster 1931.

In a letter to King George V, whom he represented in Canada as governor general, Byng expressed surprise that Mackenzie King, a staunch nationalist, had requested that Byng consult the Colonial Office in London over the matter. Byng said: &quot;I have to await the verdict of history to prove my having adopted a wrong course, and this I do with an easy conscience that, right or wrong, I have acted in the interests of Canada and implicated no one else in my decision.&quot; The Colonial Secretary, Leo Amery, privately informed Byng that had he appealed to the British government for an answer, &quot;I could only have replied ... that in my view it would not be proper for the Secretary of State to issue instructions to the Governor with regard to the exercise of his constitutional duties.&quot;

Byng returned to the United Kingdom, leaving Canada on 30 September 1926 a much respected man in both countries, despite the political crisis. Some authorities have held that Byng was constitutionally obligated to refuse King&#x27;s request; for example, Eugene Forsey argued that King&#x27;s advice to Byng was &quot;utterly unprecedented&quot; and said further: &quot;It was tantamount to allowing a prisoner to discharge the jury by which he was being tried ... If the Governor-General had granted the request, he would have become an accomplice in a flagrant act of contempt for Parliament.&quot; The relatively brief time that King had served in office prior to seeking a dissolution has also been cited as a reason for denying his request. In the United Kingdom in 1950, the Lascelles Principles expressed the relevant constitutional conventions in the matter, citing the King–Byng controversy as one of the underlying precedents.

Other authorities agreed with King, since, by custom, the Lord Byng of Vimy was obligated to heed the Prime Minister&#x27;s request to call the election. In 1997, the governor-general of New Zealand, Sir Michael Hardie Boys, expressed the opinion that Byng had been in error in not re-appointing King as prime minister and then granting the dissolution of parliament to King instead of Meighen.

The King–Byng Affair was the most controversial use of a governor general&#x27;s reserve powers until the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975, in which the Governor-General of Australia, Sir John Kerr, dismissed Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.

<doc id="880278" wikidata="Q7462802" url="?curid=880278" title="Shakespeare Institute">
<text>The Shakespeare Institute is a centre for postgraduate study dedicated to the study of William Shakespeare and the literature of the English Renaissance. It is part of the University of Birmingham, and is located in Stratford-upon-Avon.

The Institute was set up in 1951 at Mason Croft, the former home of novelist Marie Corelli. Budgetary problems forced it to be relocated to the main campus at Birmingham during the 1970s, but under the guidance of Professor Stanley Wells, the Institute was returned to Mason Croft in the 1980s and its position was consolidated in 1996 with the opening of the purpose-built Shakespeare Institute Library.

It has been described by the current director, Michael Dobson, as &quot;the best place on earth in which to explore the impact Shakespeare’s work has had across four centuries of world culture&quot;.

==Directors of the Institute==

The directors of the Institute have been:
* Allardyce Nicoll 1951 to 1961
* Terence Spencer
* Philip Brockbank
* Stanley Wells
* Peter Holland
* Russell Jackson
* Kathleen McLuskie
* Michael Dobson

==Shakespeare Institute Library==

The Shakespeare Institute Library contains about 60,000 volumes (including 3,000 early printed and rare books), archives and manuscripts, and audio-visual collections. The library aims to collect every significant publication for the study of Shakespeare and Renaissance drama and the supporting collections cover literary, cultural, political, religious, and social history of the period. Significant research collections include:
* Renaissance Theatre Company archive
* Renaissance Films PLC archive
* Unpublished Shakespeare Film Script collection
* New Shakespeare Company archive
* E. K. Chambers Papers
* Newscuttings collection 1902–present
* English Short Title Catalogue 1475-1640 on microfilm
* Francis Longe Play Collection on microfilm.

==Shakespeare Institute Players==
The Shakespeare Institute Players is the dramatic society for the postgraduate students of the University of Birmingham&#x27;s Shakespeare Institute, located in Stratford-upon-Avon. The Shakespeare Institute Players have been around under many different names since the University of Birmingham&#x27;s Shakespeare Institute has existed. The first recorded production was &quot;A Yorkshire Tragedy&quot; (Unknown Author) as The Shakespeare Institute Dramatic Society. It was performed in February 1953. Since then, the group has had many different names, but the most commonly used name (and the one by which it is currently known) is The Shakespeare Institute Players.

<doc id="880284" wikidata="Q2529568" url="?curid=880284" title="McMartin preschool trial">
<text>The McMartin preschool trial was a day care sexual abuse case in the 1980s, prosecuted by the Los Angeles District Attorney, Ira Reiner. Members of the McMartin family, who operated a preschool in Manhattan Beach, California, were charged with hundreds of acts of sexual abuse of children in their care. Accusations were made in 1983, with arrests and the pretrial investigation taking place from 1984 to 1987 and trials running from 1987 to 1990. The case lasted seven years but resulted in no convictions, and all charges were dropped in 1990. By the case&#x27;s end, it had become the longest and most expensive series of criminal trials in American history.

== Initial allegations ==
In 1983, Judy Johnson, mother of one of the preschool&#x27;s young students, reported to the police that her son had been sodomized by her estranged husband and also by McMartin teacher Ray Buckey. Buckey was the grandson of school founder Virginia McMartin and son of administrator Peggy McMartin Buckey. Johnson&#x27;s belief that her son had been abused began when her son had painful bowel movements. What happened next is still disputed. Some sources state that at that time, Johnson&#x27;s son denied her suggestion that his preschool teachers had molested him, whereas others say he confirmed the abuse.

In addition, Johnson also made several more accusations, including that people at the daycare had sexual encounters with animals, that &quot;Peggy drilled a child under the arms&quot; and &quot;Ray flew in the air.&quot; Buckey was questioned, but was not prosecuted due to lack of evidence. The police then sent a form letter to about 200 parents of students at the McMartin school, stating that their children might have been abused, and asking the parents to question their children. The text of the letter read:

September 8, 1983
Dear Parent:
This Department is conducting a criminal investigation involving child molestation (288 P.C.) Ray Buckey, an employee of Virginia McMartin&#x27;s Pre-School, was arrested September 7, 1983 by this Department.

The following procedure is obviously an unpleasant one, but to protect the rights of your children as well as the rights of the accused, this inquiry is necessary for a complete investigation.

Records indicate that your child has been or is currently a student at the pre-school. We are asking your assistance in this continuing investigation. Please question your child to see if he or she has been a witness to any crime or if he or she has been a victim. Our investigation indicates that possible criminal acts include: oral sex, fondling of genitals, buttock or chest area, and sodomy, possibly committed under the pretense of &quot;taking the child&#x27;s temperature.&quot; Also photos may have been taken of children without their clothing. Any information from your child regarding having ever observed Ray Buckey to leave a classroom alone with a child during any nap period, or if they have ever observed Ray Buckey tie up a child, is important.

Please complete the enclosed information form and return it to this Department in the enclosed stamped return envelope as soon as possible. We will contact you if circumstances dictate same.

We ask you to please keep this investigation strictly confidential because of the nature of the charges and the highly emotional effect it could have on our community. Please do not discuss this investigation with anyone outside your immediate family. Do not contact or discuss the investigation with Raymond Buckey, any member of the accused defendant&#x27;s family, or employees connected with the McMartin Pre-School.

THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO INDICATED THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF VIRGINIA MCMARTIN&#x27;S PRE-SCHOOL HAD ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THIS SITUATION AND NO DETRIMENTAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE OPERATION OF THE SCHOOL HAS BEEN DISCOVERED DURING THIS INVESTIGATION. ALSO, NO OTHER EMPLOYEE IN THE SCHOOL IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR ANY CRIMINAL ACT.
Johnson was diagnosed with and hospitalized for acute paranoid schizophrenia and, in 1986, was found dead in her home from complications of chronic alcoholism before the preliminary hearing concluded.

== Interviewing and examining the children ==
Several hundred children were then interviewed by the Children&#x27;s Institute International (CII), a Los Angeles-based abuse therapy clinic run by Kee MacFarlane. The defense alleged that the interviewing techniques used during investigations of the allegations were highly suggestive and invited children to pretend or speculate about supposed events. By spring of 1984, it was claimed that 360 children had been abused. Astrid Heppenstall Heger performed medical examinations and took photos of what she believed to be minute scarring, which she stated was caused by anal penetration. Journalist John Earl believed that her findings were based on unsubstantiated medical histories. Later research demonstrated that the methods of questioning used on the children were extremely suggestive, leading to false accusations. Others believe that the questioning itself may have led to false memory syndrome among the children questioned. Only 41 of the original 360 children ultimately testified in the grand jury and pretrial hearings, and fewer than a dozen testified at the actual trials.

Michael P. Maloney, a clinical psychologist and professor of psychiatry, reviewed videotapes of the children&#x27;s interviews. Maloney, testifying as an expert witness on interviewing children, was highly critical of the techniques used, referring to them as improper, coercive, directive, problematic and adult-directed in a way that forced the children to follow a rigid script. He concluded that &quot;many of the kids&#x27; statements in the interviews were generated by the examiner.&quot; Transcripts and recordings of the interviews contained far more speech from adults than children and demonstrated that, despite the highly coercive interviewing techniques used, initially the children were resistant to interviewers&#x27; attempts to elicit disclosures. The recordings of the interviews were instrumental in the jury&#x27;s refusal to convict, by demonstrating how children could be coerced to giving vivid and dramatic testimonies without having experienced actual abuse. The techniques used were shown to be contrary to the existing guidelines in California for the investigation of cases involving children and child witnesses.

== Allegations ==
Some of the accusations were described as &quot;bizarre&quot;, overlapping with accusations that mirrored the emerging satanic ritual abuse panic. It was alleged that, in addition to having been sexually abused, they saw witches fly, traveled in a hot-air balloon, and were taken through underground tunnels. When shown a series of photographs by Danny Davis (the McMartins&#x27; lawyer), one child identified actor Chuck Norris as one of the abusers.

Some of the abuse was alleged to have occurred in secret tunnels beneath the school. Several excavations turned up evidence of old buildings on the site and other debris from before the school was built, but no evidence of any secret chambers or tunnels was found. There were claims of orgies at car washes and airports, and of children being flushed down toilets to secret rooms where they would be abused, then cleaned up and presented back to their parents. Some child interviewees talked of a game called &quot;naked movie star&quot; and suggested they were forcibly photographed nude. During trial testimony, some children stated that the &quot;naked movie star&quot; game was actually a rhyming taunt used to tease other children—&quot;What you say is what you are, you&#x27;re a naked movie star&quot;—and had nothing to do with having naked pictures taken.

Judy Johnson, who made the initial allegations, made bizarre and impossible statements about Raymond Buckey, including that he could fly. Though the prosecution asserted Johnson&#x27;s mental illness was caused by the events of the trial, Johnson had admitted to them that she was mentally ill beforehand. Evidence of Johnson&#x27;s mental illness was withheld from the defense for three years and, when provided, was in the form of sanitized reports that excluded Johnson&#x27;s statements, at the order of the prosecution. One of the original prosecutors, Glenn Stevens, left the case in protest and stated that other prosecutors had withheld evidence from the defense, including the information that Johnson&#x27;s son did not actually identify Ray Buckey in a series of photographs. Stevens also accused Robert Philibosian, the deputy district attorney on the case, of lying and withholding evidence from the court and defense lawyers in order to keep the Buckeys in jail and prevent access to exonerating evidence.

== Trials ==
Two trials were conducted for the McMartin preschool case. The first lasted from July 13, 1987, to January 18, 1990, while the second lasted from May 7, 1990, to July 27, 1990.

=== Arrests and preliminary hearing ===
On March 22, 1984, Virginia McMartin, her daughter Peggy McMartin Buckey, her grandchildren Ray and Peggy Ann Buckey, and teachers Mary Ann Jackson, Betty Raidor, and Babette Spitler were charged with 115 counts of child abuse, later expanded to 321 counts of child abuse involving 48 children.

In the 20 months of preliminary hearings, the prosecution, led by attorney Lael Rubin, presented their theory of sexual abuse. The children&#x27;s testimony during the preliminary hearings was inconsistent. Michelle Smith and Lawrence Pazder, co-authors of the now-discredited Satanic ritual abuse autobiography &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot;, met with the parents and children involved in the case, and were believed by the initial prosecutor Glenn Stevens to have influenced the children&#x27;s testimony.

In 1986, a new district attorney, Ira Reiner, called the evidence &quot;incredibly weak&quot; and dropped all charges against Virginia McMartin, Peggy Ann Buckey, Mary Ann Jackson, Betty Raidor and Babette Spitler. Peggy McMartin Buckey and Ray Buckey remained in custody awaiting trial; Peggy McMartin&#x27;s bail had been set at $1 million and Ray Buckey had been denied bail.

=== First trial ===
The first trial opened on July 13, 1987. During the trial, the prosecution presented seven medical witnesses. The defense attempted to rebut them with several witnesses, but the judge limited them to one in order to save time. In their summation, the prosecution argued that they had seven experts on this issue, when the defense only had one.

Ray Buckey was initially held without bail. In 1987, the trial judge granted bail of $3 million, which Buckey was unable to raise. In December 1988, the judge cut that amount to 1.5 million. Finally, in February 1989, Buckey was released on bail after spending almost 5 years in jail.

In 1989, Peggy Ann Buckey&#x27;s appeal to have her teaching credentials re-instated after their suspension was granted. The judge ruled that there was no credible evidence or corroboration to lead to the license being suspended, and that a review of the videotaped interviews with McMartin children &quot;reveal[ed] a pronounced absence of any evidence implicating [Peggy Ann] in any wrongdoing and ... raises additional doubts of credibility with respect to the children interviewed or with respect to the value of CII interviewing techniques themselves.&quot; The following day the state credentialing board in Sacramento endorsed the ruling and restored Buckey&#x27;s right to teach.

==== Perjury by confession witness ====
In October 1987, jailhouse informant George Freeman was called as a witness and testified that Ray Buckey had confessed to him while sharing a cell. Freeman later attempted to flee the country and confessed to perjury in a series of other criminal cases in which he manufactured testimony in exchange for favorable treatment by the prosecution, in several instances fabricating jailhouse confessions of other inmates. In order to guarantee his testimony during the McMartin case, Freeman was given immunity to previous charges of perjury.

==== Acquittals ====
On January 18, 1990, after three years of testimony and nine weeks of deliberation by the jury, Peggy McMartin Buckey was acquitted on all counts. Ray Buckey was cleared on 52 of 65 counts. Nine of 11 jurors at a press conference following the trial stated that they believed the children had been molested but the evidence did not allow them to state who had committed the abuse beyond a reasonable doubt. Eleven out of the thirteen jurors who remained by the end of the trial voted to acquit Buckey of the charges; the refusal of the remaining two to vote for a not guilty verdict resulted in the deadlock.

=== Second trial and dismissal ===
Ray Buckey was retried later on 6 of the 13 counts of which he was not acquitted in the first trial. The second trial opened on May 7, 1990, and resulted in another hung jury on July 27, 1990. The prosecution then gave up trying to obtain a conviction, and the case was closed with all charges against Ray Buckey dismissed. He had been jailed for five years without ever being convicted of committing any crime.

== Media coverage ==
In 1988, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the case &quot;attracted national attention when the authorities speculated that hundreds of children might have been molested and subjected to satanic rituals&quot; and &quot;has teetered on the brink of mistrial&quot;.

The media coverage was generally skewed towards an uncritical acceptance of the prosecution&#x27;s viewpoint. David Shaw of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote a series of articles, which later won the Pulitzer Prize, discussing the flawed and skewed coverage presented by his own paper on the trial. It was only after the case that coverage of the flaws in the evidence and events presented by witnesses and the prosecution were discussed.

Wayne Satz, at the time a reporter for the Los Angeles ABC affiliate television station KABC, reported on the case and the children&#x27;s allegations. He presented an unchallenged view of the children&#x27;s and parents&#x27; claims. Satz later entered into a romantic relationship with Kee MacFarlane, the social worker at the Children&#x27;s Institute International, who was interviewing the children. Another instance of media conflict of interest occurred when David Rosenzweig, the editor at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; overseeing the coverage, became engaged to marry Lael Rubin, the prosecutor.

== Legacy ==
The case lasted seven years and cost $15 million, the longest and most expensive criminal case in the history of the United States legal system, and ultimately resulted in no convictions. The McMartin preschool was closed and the building was demolished. In 2005, one of the children (as an adult) retracted the allegations of abuse.
Never did anyone do anything to me, and I never saw them doing anything. I said a lot of things that didn&#x27;t happen. I lied. ... Anytime I would give them an answer that they didn&#x27;t like, they would ask again and encourage me to give them the answer they were looking for. ... I felt uncomfortable and a little ashamed that I was being dishonest. But at the same time, being the type of person I was, whatever my parents wanted me to do, I would do.

In an article in &quot;Los Angeles&quot; magazine, Mary A. Fischer said the case was &quot;simply invented&quot;, and transmogrified into a national &quot;cause celebre&quot; by the misplaced zeal of six people: Judy Johnson, a mother of one of the children, Jane Hoag, the detective who investigated the complaints; Kee MacFarlane, the social worker who interviewed the children; Robert Philibosian, the district attorney who was in a losing battle for re-election; Wayne Satz, the television reporter who first reported the case; and Lael Rubin, the prosecutor.

In 1990, Peggy, Ray, and Peggy Ann Buckey spoke to the National Association of State Vocal Organizations about their experiences. Peggy Ann and Ray Buckey attended the 1997 &quot;Day of Contrition&quot; conference in Salem, Massachusetts. They were joined by other victims and experts of the day-care sex-abuse hysteria.

=== Legal ===
In many states, laws were passed allowing children to testify on closed-circuit TV so the children would not be traumatized by facing the accused. The arrangement was supported in &quot;Maryland v. Craig&quot;, in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that closed circuit testimony was permissible where it was limited to circumstances with a likelihood that a minor may be harmed by testifying in open court. The case also influenced how very young children were questioned for evidence in court cases with concerns over their capacity for suggestibility and false memories. The case and others like it also affected the investigation of allegations by young children. Normal police procedure is to record using video, tape or notes in interviews with alleged victims. The initial interviews with children by the CII were recorded, and demonstrated to the jury members in the trial the coercive and suggestive techniques used by CII staff to produce allegations.

These interviews were instrumental in the jury members failing to produce a guilty verdict against Buckey, and several similar trials with similar interviewing techniques produced similar not guilty verdicts when juries were allowed to view the recordings. In response, prosecutors and investigators began &quot;abandoning their tape recorders and notepads&quot; and a manual was produced for investigating child abuse cases that urged prosecutors and investigators not to record their interviews.

=== Continued allegations of secret tunnels ===

In 1990, parents who believed their children had been abused at the preschool hired archaeologist E. Gary Stickel to investigate the site. In May 1990, Stickel claimed he found evidence of tunnels, consistent with the children&#x27;s accounts, under the McMartin Preschool using ground-penetrating radar.

Others have disagreed with Stickel&#x27;s conclusions. John Earl wrote in 1995 that the concrete slab floor was undisturbed except for a small patch where the sewer line was tapped into. Once the slab was removed, there was no sign of any materials to line or hold up any tunnels, and the concrete floor would have made it impossible for the defendants to fill in any tunnels once the abuse investigation began. The article concluded that disturbed soil under the slab was from the sewer line and construction fill buried under the slab before it was poured. Further, Earl noted that some fill from beneath the concrete slab was dated to the year 1940.

W. Joseph Wyatt&#x27;s 2002 report concluded that the so-called tunnels under the preschool were more plausibly explained as a series of adjacent rubbish pits used by the owners of the site before the preschool&#x27;s construction in 1966. Materials found during the excavation included bottles predominantly dated to the 1930s and &#x27;40s, as well as tin-can fragments, plywood, inner tubes, professionally-butchered livestock bones, four small containers of trash, and a former owner&#x27;s old mail box.

Only three small items found near the edge of the concrete slab were dated after 1966. Wyatt suggested one of these – a fragment of a plastic snack bag – was most likely dragged into the pit by rats or other scavengers, just as Stickel himself had suggested likely happened for other debris that did not fit his tunnel theory. The remaining items, per Wyatt, had likely been left by a plumber digging from adjacent to the building to avoid damaging the concrete pad. Moreover, Wyatt speculated that Stickel&#x27;s conclusions were colored by his collaboration with the parents of the McMartin children.

=== Effects on child abuse research ===

Shortly after investigation into the McMartin charges began, the funds to research child sexual abuse greatly increased, notably through the budget allocated for the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN). The agency&#x27;s budget increased from $1.8 million to $7.2 million between 1983 and 1984, increasing to $15 million in 1985, making it the greatest source of funding for child abuse and neglect prevention in the United States. The majority of this budget went toward studies on sexual abuse with only $5 million going towards physical abuse and neglect.

Federal funding was also used to arrange conferences on ritual abuse, providing an aura of respectability as well as allowing prosecutors to exchange tips on the best means of obtaining convictions. A portion of the funds were used to publish the book &quot;Behind the Playground Walls&quot;, which used a sample of children drawn from the McMartin families. The book claimed to study the effects of &quot;reported&quot; rather than actual abuse but portrayed all of the McMartin children as actual victims of abuse despite a lack of convictions during the trials and without mentioning questions about the reality of the accusations. Another grant of $173,000 went to David Finkelhor, who used the funds to investigate allegations of day care sexual abuse throughout the country, combining the study of verified crimes by admitted pedophiles and unverified accusations of satanic ritual abuse.

=== Media ===

In 1995, HBO produced &quot;&quot;, a movie based on the trials.

In 2019, Oxygen produced &quot;Uncovered: The McMartin Family Trials&quot;, a documentary about the events.

<text>Gildas Laurent Molgat, CD (January 25, 1927 – February 28, 2001) was a Canadian politician. He served as leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party from 1961 to 1969, and was subsequently appointed to the Senate of Canada, where he served as Speaker from 1994 until 2001. He died shortly thereafter.

The son of Louis F. Molgat and Adele Abraham, Molgat was born in Ste. Rose du Lac, Manitoba. He was educated at Ste. Rose School and the University of Manitoba. He worked as a manager for Bethel-Rennie Ltd. United Stores and Advance Credit Corporation, and served as an army captain in the Royal Winnipeg Rifles. He was married to Allison Malcolm.

Molgat was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in 1953, in the francophone riding of Ste. Rose. He was a Liberal-Progressive, and a supporter of Premier Douglas Lloyd Campbell.

The Liberal-Progressives lost the election of 1958, though Molgat was easily re-elected over his Progressive Conservative opponent. This was partly the result of historical francophone voting patterns in the province—most Franco-Manitobans supported the Progressive Party of John Bracken in the 1920s, and continued to support the party after it merged with the Liberals in 1932. Although Dufferin Roblin&#x27;s Tories made several gains in 1958, the province&#x27;s francophone ridings continued to elect Liberal-Progressive MLAs.

Molgat was re-elected in 1959, again by a significant margin. When Campbell resigned as Liberal leader in 1961 (the &quot;Progressive&quot; name having been dropped), Molgat was selected to replace him. A protégé of Campbell, he was aligned with the more traditionalist wing of the party. His primary opponent for the party&#x27;s leadership was Stan Roberts, who represented its modernizing wing. He was the first francophone party leader in Manitoba since 1919, and the first ever in the province&#x27;s Liberal Party.

As party leader, Molgat prevented the Liberals from falling behind the New Democratic Party for third-party status, but he was never able to pose a serious threat to Roblin&#x27;s government. The Progressive Conservatives had greater urban support, and were generally regarded as the more &quot;modernizing&quot; party. The Liberals won 13 seats in 1962, and 14 in 1966 (out of 57). Molgat never faced any serious competition in his own riding.

Roblin resigned as Progressive Conservative leader in 1967 and was replaced by the more conservative Walter Weir. After the election of Pierre Trudeau as Prime Minister of Canada in 1968, Weir&#x27;s government took a number of steps to prevent the establishment of official bilingualism in the province. These measures seemed to be supported by many in Manitoba&#x27;s anglophone community, and the provincial Liberals were shut out in four crucial by-elections in early 1969. Molgat resigned as party leader soon thereafter, and was replaced by Robert Bend.

This proved to be a poor strategic decision for the Liberals. Bend represented the rural, traditional wing of the party, and had been out of politics for a decade. His campaign fared poorly, and the party was reduced to five members in the general election of 1969 (three of whom were francophone). Molgat was again elected in Ste. Rose without serious difficulty.

The election itself resulted in a temporary stalemale, with Edward Schreyer&#x27;s New Democrats winning 28 seats out of 57, one shy of a majority. There were negotiations among the Liberal and Conservative parties to form a coalition; one scenario would have seen Molgat serving as Premier. The impasse was ended when a francophone Liberal MLA named Laurent Desjardins announced that he would support the NDP.

Molgat resigned his seat on October 7, 1970, having been appointed on the recommendation of Pierre Trudeau to the Canadian Senate. Now allowed to use the title &quot;The Honourable&quot;, he soon became one the Senate&#x27;s leading figures in the field of constitutional reform, co-chairing a Special Joint Committee on the Constitution of Canada in 1971, and another on Senate Reform in 1983. He also served as president of the Liberal Party of Canada from 1973 until 1976. Later in the 1980s, he would serve as chair of the Senate Committee of the Whole on the Meech Lake Constitutional Accord.

Molgat was elected deputy speaker in 1983 and was re-elected to the position in 1988. From September 30, 1991, to November 11, 1993, he served as deputy opposition leader in the Senate. When the federal Liberals under Jean Chrétien formed government, Molgat became deputy government leader. One year later, when Roméo LeBlanc was appointed Governor General of Canada, Molgat replaced him as Speaker of the Senate of Canada.

Molgat also served as president of the Liberal Party of Canada. He died in hospital on February 28, 2001, following a stroke.

<text>Music for People is the second album by the band VAST, released in September 12, 2000 by Elektra Records. It would be VAST&#x27;s last album on Elektra Records. After the success of VAST&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Music for People&quot; could only produce one successful single, &quot;Free&quot;, which gained major MTV exposure. However, after the mixed success of the album, VAST and Elektra Records parted ways over disappointing sales and differing views on the future of the band.

<text>Bernard Watson (born David Weinstein, 1967) is an American singer and guitarist, who was the opening act at the American leg of the Live Aid concert in JFK Stadium, Philadelphia on July 13, 1985. 

An 18-year-old from Miami Beach, he had just graduated from high school and had no professional musical experience. After sleeping outside the stadium for a week, he persuaded the concert&#x27;s producer Bill Graham, in the spirit of charity, to let him perform. Graham relented, and Watson (who took his stage name from Bernard Marx and Helmholz Watson, two characters from Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;) took the stage at 8:51am (EDT).

Watson sang two songs: Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;All I Really Want To Do&quot; and an original composition called &quot;Interview&quot;, accompanying himself on guitar and harmonica.

:&quot;One of the strings on my guitar broke, then I dropped the pick and that wasn&#x27;t very professional. But I felt happy that I got a chance. I&#x27;d like to make it in this business. It was the dream of a lifetime. That&#x27;s what it was.&quot; — Bernard Watson
Watson&#x27;s contribution is not on the official DVD set; supposedly the only known copy of the footage is in the possession of Watson himself, although footage of his performance taken from a WPLG news report is available on YouTube. , Watson was continuing to write music, but was using his birth name rather than his stage name.

<doc id="880310" wikidata="Q1496240" url="?curid=880310" title="General officer commanding">
<text>General officer commanding (GOC) is the usual title given in the armies of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth (and some other nations, such as Ireland) to a general officer who holds a command appointment.

Thus, a general might be the GOC British II Corps (a three-star appointment) or GOC British 7th Armoured Division (a two-star appointment).

==GOC-in-C==
A general officer heading a particularly large or important command, such as Middle East Command or the Allied Armies in Italy, may be called a general officer commanding-in-chief (GOC-in-C). The governor of the Imperial Fortress colony of Bermuda was also appointed commander-in-chief of the disproportionately-large Bermuda Garrison. From 1912, when Lieutenant-General Sir George Mackworth Bullock replaced the late Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Walter Kitchener, through the Second World War, the military office was titled &quot;General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Bermuda&quot;. GOC-in-Cs are usually one rank higher than a GOC with GOCs of corps-level formations reporting to them.

==Usage in the Indian Army==
===General Officer Commanding-in-Chief===

The army commanders who head the training and operational commands of the Indian Army hold the title of General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, abbreviated as GOC-in-C. There are seven appointments currently:

* General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Central Command
* General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Eastern Command
* General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Northern Command
* General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Southern Command
* General Officer Commanding-in-Chief South Western Command
* General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Western Command
* General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Army Training Command
===General Officer Commanding===

Higher military commanders of the Indian Army who are in command of operational formations, such as a division or corps, or of static formations, such as subarea or Area, are also freferred to as General Officers Commanding or GOC; examples being GOC 12 Corps, GOC 3 Infantry Division, GOC Dakshin Maharashtra and Goa Subarea, GOC Uttar Bharat Area, etc.

==Equivalent term in other services==

<doc id="880314" wikidata="Q18616" url="?curid=880314" title="Blackwater Park">
<text>Blackwater Park is the fifth studio album by Swedish progressive metal band Opeth. It was released on March 12, 2001, in Europe and a day later in North America through Music for Nations and Koch Records. The album marks the first collaboration between Porcupine Tree frontman Steven Wilson and the band, as Wilson had been brought in to produce the album. This contributed to a shift in Opeth&#x27;s musical style. The songs &quot;The Drapery Falls&quot; and &quot;Still Day Beneath the Sun&quot; were released as singles.

Although &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; did not chart in North America or the United Kingdom, it was a commercial breakthrough for the band. Often considered their magnum opus, the album was highly acclaimed among critics, with Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic stating that the album is &quot;surely the band&#x27;s coming-of-age album, and therefore, an ideal introduction to its remarkable body of work.” In 2020, &quot;Loudwire&quot; listed &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; as the number one progressive metal album of all time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album as 55th on their list of &#x27;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.&#x27;

==Production==
Following a few live dates in Europe, Opeth&#x27;s guitarist and vocalist Mikael Åkerfeldt went to an old friend&#x27;s house in Stockholm, Sweden, to record some demos and develop ideas for the new album. The album is named after the German progressive rock band of the same name and was the first album for which the group had a title before they started recording.

This album featured heavy input from Porcupine Tree frontman Steven Wilson, whose relationship with Opeth had begun in the past when an interviewer, who was a friend of Åkerfeldt&#x27;s and knew the latter was a fan of Wilson&#x27;s work, gave Wilson a copy of Opeth&#x27;s then-latest release &quot;Still Life&quot;, which Wilson ended up liking so much that he contacted Åkerfeldt about it. A few months after the making of the demos, Åkerfeldt was having dinner with Wilson in which the two discussed the idea of Wilson producing the next Opeth album. After Åkerfeldt sent Wilson the demos he had recorded, Wilson agreed to produce the album.

Opeth entered Studio Fredman to begin work on &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; on August 10, 2000. The band had no previous lyrics written and had only rehearsed three times before entering the studio. The band&#x27;s engineer Fredrik Nordström had arranged for the group to stay in a small room in the studio that had four beds. Opeth stayed there for around two weeks and then later rented out Dark Tranquillity member Mikael Stanne&#x27;s flat. After recording the basic drums, rhythms, bass and acoustic guitars, Wilson arrived to produce the clean vocals and add some guitar leads. Åkerfeldt wrote that Wilson had an &quot;immense impact on the recording&quot; and after working with him the group entered &quot;a new phase&quot;.

Åkerfeldt described the recording of the album as &quot;rather smooth&quot;. Soilwork was recording in the studio at the same time as Opeth. Åkerfeldt wrote that Opeth felt like &quot;a bunch of amateurs in comparison. They were working all the time. When they came into the kitchen for a break, we&#x27;re still there, on the same break we took 3 hours ago. We don&#x27;t want this to become a &#x27;job&#x27;, or something you do because you have to. We wanna have a good time, and thus we only work when it feels right.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Blackwater Park&quot; was originally released on March 12, 2001, in Europe and a day later in North America. This was the first Opeth album to be released in North America at the same time as it was in the rest of the world. It has been released on compact disc and vinyl record formats. A special edition of &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; was issued in 2002 with a bonus second disc that included &quot;Still Day Beneath the Sun&quot; and &quot;Patterns in the Ivy II&quot;. Those two bonus tracks were released together as a vinyl-only 7-inch EP by Robotic Empire Records in February 2003. The limited edition EP sold out in less than 24 hours and continues to be one of Opeth&#x27;s most sought-after releases to date. Two singles were also released to promote &quot;Blackwater Park&quot;. A shortened radio edit version of &quot;The Drapery Falls&quot; was released as a promo single. The bonus track &quot;Still Day Beneath the Sun&quot; was later released as a vinyl only single.

&quot;Blackwater Park&quot; did not chart in the United States or United Kingdom. As of May 2008, &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; has sold over 93,000 copies in the United States.

On March 29, 2010, Opeth re-released a Legacy Edition of &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; which included a live version of &quot;The Leper Affinity&quot; and then a second DVD which is the entire album in 5.0 Surround Sound and a making of documentary. This version was released in North America in April 2012 by The End Records.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Blackwater Park&quot; received critical acclaim upon release. Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic wrote that the album was &quot;a work of breathtaking creative breadth&quot; and noted the album&#x27;s critical praise stating that &quot;not since the release of Tiamat&#x27;s groundbreaking masterpiece &quot;Wildhoney&quot; in 1994 had the extreme metal scene witnessed such an overwhelming show of fan enthusiasm and uniform critical praise as that bestowed upon Blackwater Park.” He also said that the album is &quot;surely the band&#x27;s coming-of-age album, and therefore, an ideal introduction to its remarkable body of work.” &quot;Pitchfork&quot; praised the album, writing that &quot;Blackwater Park has the reputation it does in large part because none of the songs follow the same songwriting formula, instead looking toward variations within general themes that all build to a dramatic conclusion in the title track.&quot; Opeth was compared to critically acclaimed groups from previous eras. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote in their review of the album, that &quot;Opeth paint on an epic canvas, sounding at times like... metal&#x27;s answer to &#x27;70s King Crimson&quot;. &quot;CMJ&quot; also wrote a very positive review calling the album &quot;Godlike ... a metal fusion of Pink Floyd and the Beatles&quot;. The Canadian music magazine &quot;Exclaim!&quot; wrote that the album &quot;might be the best metal record this year, and it is worth every bit of energy the band has put into the creating of it.”

&quot;Decibel&quot; wrote that &quot;Blackwater Park’s brilliance is the production. Co-produced by Opeth and Wilson and engineered by Fredrik Nordström, it’s one of the first death metal albums to feel, well, different. Crystal clear, yet resolutely heavy, Blackwater Park is also full of nuance.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; noted that Wilson&#x27;s &quot;production help and encouragement teased out the band&#x27;s explorations of acoustic-led arrangements as much as electric ones while further showcasing Åkerfeldt&#x27;s sweet, clear singing as much as the roars on songs like &quot;The Leper Affinity&quot; and the title track.&quot; British magazine &quot;Record Collector&quot; called &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; Opeth&#x27;s finest hour and added that much of the credit &quot;can be attributed to the advanced vision of Steven Wilson.&quot;

&quot;Loudwire&quot; ranked &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; as the 15th best metal album of all time, claiming the album reflected the group&#x27;s &quot;70s art-rock influences, supported by consistently intricate, wildly imaginative nine-to-ten-minute epics, each one more awe-inspiring than the last.&quot;

Sputnikmusic placed &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; at No. 39 on its list of the Top 100 Albums of the Decade.

== Accolades ==
In 2020, &quot;Loudwire&quot; listed &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; as the number one progressive metal album of all time. It was Metal Storm&#x27;s number 1 album of 2001 and number 4 on the Top 200 albums of all time. &quot;LA Weekly&quot; named it the 5th best metal album in history. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; as 55th on their list of &#x27;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.

In 2009, MetalSucks compiled a list of the &quot;21 Best Metal Albums of the 21st Century So Far&quot; based on the opinions of various musicians, managers, publicists, label representatives and writers, where &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; ranked at No. 3 on the list. &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine similarly named &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; the 3rd best metal album of the decade. The album was listed at No. 5 on &quot;Terrorizer&quot;&#x27;s best albums of the 2000s.

In June 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; at 28th place for their list of &quot;Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time&quot;. TeamRock placed the album at #36 on their &quot;Top 100 Prog Albums of All Time&quot; list.

In 2012, &quot;Loudwire&quot; listed the title track as the second best metal song of the 21st century. &quot;Q&quot; magazine included &quot;Bleak&quot; in its 2004 list of &quot;1010 Songs You Must Own!&quot;

<doc id="880321" wikidata="Q7248704" url="?curid=880321" title="1985 Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leadership elections">
<text>In 1985, the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party held two leadership elections: one in January, and one in November.

==January Convention==
===Background===
The January convention was held at the CNE Coliseum at Exhibition Place in Toronto to choose a replacement for William Davis, who had served as Ontario PC leader and Premier of Ontario since 1971. Davis had been expected to call an election to seek a further mandate from the voters, but surprised pundits by retiring from political life instead.

Four of Davis&#x27;s cabinet ministers announced their intentions to seek the leadership: Frank Miller, Dennis Timbrell, Larry Grossman, and Roy McMurtry. Grossman and McMurtry were considered to be Red Tories who would continue in the tradition of moderate government maintained by Davis and his predecessor as leader and premier, John Robarts. Miller was supported by the right wing of the party, who believed that he would take a more aggressive approach to reducing the size of the provincial government. Timbrell was viewed as being a centrist.

In initial candidate debates, few differences in policy emerged. Instead the differences manifested in political outlook. Miller, supported by 27 members of caucus, was viewed as the candidate of small town conservatism. Grossman, with 10 supporting members was the candidate of high-powered urbanity. Timbrell with 18 supporting members was seen more along the lines of the previous leader, aping Davis&#x27;s pragmatic blandness. McMurtry coming in last with 8 supporting members tried to portray a populist image with links to ethnic communities.

===Procedure===
The voters at the convention consisted of delegates elected from PC riding associations, delegates elected from other PC associations such as those for women, campuses, youth and business groups, as well as ex-officio delegates such as party members who held elected office, and members of the party&#x27;s executive bodies.

===Convention===
During the convention an &#x27;Anybody But Miller&#x27; pact was a significant influence. Miller&#x27;s convention speech was solid, yet unspectacular. If anything it reassured delegates who were concerned over policy gaffes made by Miller before the convention. Miller emerged with a significant lead on the first ballot which he kept through to the final ballot. As each candidate with the fewest votes was dropped after each ballot, he threw his support behind Grossman, which seemed to confirm the &#x27;Anybody But Miller&#x27; pact theory. Grossman edged out Timbrell for second place on the second ballot and, facing elimination, demanded a recount which produced the same result. After the second ballot when Timbrell threw his support to Grossman, his supporters were more divided and enough of them voted for Miller to enable him to win the convention.

===Ballot results===
==November Convention==

Following the party&#x27;s poor showing in the 1985 election, the party retained power with only a slim plurality of four seats and lost their government majority status. The opposition Liberals gained the support of the third party, the New Democratic Party. The Liberals and the NDP negotiated an accord whereby the NDP agreed to support the Liberals in a new government provided that they support NDP policy initiatives. On June 26, 1985, the Liberals passed a motion of no confidence and the PCs fell from power for the first time in 44 years. Miller resigned as leader, and a new convention was called, to be held again in Toronto.

Timbrell and Grossman announced their intentions to run, along with Alan Pope, who had been Minister of Natural Resources in the Davis government. This time, Grossman had a clear lead going into the convention. Pope was dropped after the first ballot, and Grossman a narrow victory on the second ballot.

===Ballot results===

(Held at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, Toronto on November 16, 1985.)

First ballot:

*GROSSMAN, Larry 752
*TIMBRELL, Dennis 661
*POPE, Alan 271

Second ballot:

*GROSSMAN, Larry 848
*TIMBRELL, Dennis 829

<text>The College of Emporia was a private college in Emporia, Kansas, from 1882 to 1974, and was associated with the Presbyterian church.

When founded, it was one of two higher education institutions in the city of Emporia; the other at that time was the &quot;Kansas State Normal School&quot; established for teacher training and was later renamed Kansas State Teachers College (KSTC) and reorganized in the mid-to-late 1970s as a state liberal arts college, at which time the name was changed to Emporia State University. Since Emporia had two colleges before 1900, the city was sometimes called the &quot;Athens of Kansas.&quot;

== History ==

The College of Emporia was founded in 1882. In March 1909, the &quot;Lewis Academy&quot;, a Presbyterian school in Wichita, consolidated with the College of Emporia.

Colonel John Byers Anderson of Manhattan, Kansas, donated his personal library to the college in 1888, and he served as president of the board of trustees of the college. Twelve years later, a Carnegie grant provided the funds for the college to build the Anderson Memorial Library, in memory of John B. Anderson, whom Carnegie had known when younger and who later served on the board of trustees of the College of Emporia. The library was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 25, 1987.

The Registrar&#x27;s office at Emporia State University is the official custodian of the transcripts for the former College of Emporia.

The college campus was purchased by The Way International for $694,000 and was operated as The Way College of Emporia from 1975 until 1989.

==Athletics==
The College of Emporia (CoE) athletic teams were called the Fighting Presbies. The college was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Heart of America Athletic Conference (HAAC) from 1971–1972 to 1973–1974. The Fighting Presbies previously competed in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference (KCAC) from 1933–1934 to 1970–1971, which they were a member on a previous stint from 1902–1903 to 1922–1923; as well as in the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (CIC) from 1923–1924 to 1932–1933.

===Football===
Football was established in the late 1890s and existed until the college closed its doors in 1974. The team known as the red and white &quot;Fighting Presbies&quot; had a proud tradition—over 70 years of football the college won 14 conference football championships, including an undefeated, untied, and unscored on season in 1928.

In 1955, alumnus Lem Harkey was drafted in the sixth round by the Pittsburgh Steelers. The college&#x27;s most famous player and honored coach was Homer Woodson Hargiss.
