<text>Flying Buffalo Inc. (FBI) is a game company with a line of role playing games, card games, and other gaming materials. The company&#x27;s founder, Rick Loomis, began game publishing with &quot;Nuclear Destruction&quot;, a play-by-mail game which started the professional PBM industry in the United States. Loomis added games and players while introducing computer moderation and soon incorporated into the company Flying Buffalo Inc. The company published games in other genres, including card games such as &quot;Nuclear War&quot; and a role playing game called &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot;, a game similar to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Flying Buffalo acquired its 10,000th customer account number in 1980 and reached its largest size of 21 employees in 1983.

In July 2021, Webbed Sphere bought Flying Buffalo with plans to incorporate Flying Buffalo&#x27;s products. The PBM games were not included in the sale and were continued by a separate company called Rick Loomis PBM Games.

==History==
Flying Buffalo Inc. was founded in January 1970. That year, Rick Loomis invented a game called &quot;Nuclear Destruction&quot;, a play-by-mail game, for which he moderated multiplayer games. &quot;Nuclear Destruction&quot; started the professional PBM industry. He soon had more than 200 players involved across multiple games, and asked fellow soldier Steve MacGregor to write a computer program to help moderate the games; they started renting time on a computer near Fort Shafter, using the name Flying Buffalo devised by Loomis. 
 Loomis published the first issue of his bi-monthly magazine in September 1971—one two-sided page. Initially called &quot;The Flying Buffalo&#x27;s Favorite Magazine&quot;, Loomis eventually renamed it to &quot;Flying Buffalo Quarterly&quot;. 

After leaving the military in 1972, Rick Loomis incorporated his PBM company as Flying Buffalo, Inc., or FBI. Loomis used his savings to purchase a Raytheon 704 minicomputer to run turns for the PBM games. According to Loomis in 1971, the computer cost $15,000 and had &quot;4000 words of memory ... a teletypewriter, and a paper [tape] reader/punch&quot;. 

Also in 1972, Loomis acquired and published &quot;Nuclear War&quot;; it soon became one of Flying Buffalo&#x27;s best sellers. In 1975 they published &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot;, a fantasy role playing game generally similar to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and &quot;Viva!: Revolution in Mexico&quot;, a board wargame. Later products included background materials for fantasy role playing games, which became the &quot;Catalyst&quot; series. In 1976 the company started running a space exploration/conquest PBM game titled &quot;Starweb&quot;. In 1978 they purchased a board wargame titled &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; from game designer Jim Bumpas. Also in 1978 the company began publishing &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;. The company&#x27;s gross sales in 1978 was $125,000 with expenses at $130,000. 1979 brought some additional changes. Flying Buffalo&#x27;s Vice President, Dave Slight, died, slowing PBM operations. The company purchased another Raytheon computer from a local doctor&#x27;s office, which promised to speed printing by an order of magnitude (although it initially was missing some key required equipment).

In 1980, the company stated that it had more than 3,000 players worldwide. The staff reached its largest size of over 21 employees in 1983. The company also ran a gaming store at various locations in Tempe, Arizona until 1985. In 1985, Flying Buffalo reached a milestone, assigning its 10,000th account number. The company noted that, although account No. 1 went to its founder, Rick Loomis, account No. 10,000 went to a customer from Athens, Alabama. 

In 1992, the fiction book &quot;Mage&#x27;s Blood and Old Bones: A Tunnels &amp; Trolls Shared World Anthology&quot; was published by Flying Buffalo. Following the dissolution of TSR in 1997, Flying Buffalo remains the oldest pen-and-paper role-playing game publisher in the world. 

In July 2021, Webbed Sphere purchased Flying Buffalo Inc. with plans for Flying Buffalo to join its existing product lines. The PBM games were not included in the sale and a separate company, Rick Loomis PBM Games, continues to run nine PBM games originally published by Flying Buffalo, including &quot;Heroic Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Nuclear Destruction&quot;, &quot;Starweb&quot;, and others.

In 2023, Rhenn Taguiam of Game Rant ranked this season as the eleventh-best season. In 2024, Taguiam&#x27;s ranking was updated with this season becoming the fifth-best season.

John Crook of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Flo &quot;spoiled&quot; and &quot;petulant&quot;.

<doc id="897906" wikidata="Q418962" url="?curid=897906" title="Tungsten hexafluoride">
<text>Tungsten(VI) fluoride, also known as tungsten hexafluoride, is an inorganic compound with the formula . It is a toxic, corrosive, colorless gas, with a density of about (roughly 11 times heavier than air). It is the densest known gas under standard ambient temperature and pressure (298 K, 1 atm). is commonly used by the semiconductor industry to form tungsten films, through the process of chemical vapor deposition. This layer is used in a low-resistivity metallic &quot;interconnect&quot;. It is one of seventeen known binary hexafluorides.

==Properties==
The molecule is octahedral with the symmetry point group of Oh. The W–F bond distances are . Between , tungsten hexafluoride condenses into a colorless liquid having the density of at . At it freezes into a white solid having a cubic crystalline structure, the lattice constant of 628 pm and calculated density . At this structure transforms into an orthorhombic solid with the lattice constants of &quot;a&quot; = 960.3 pm, &quot;b&quot; = 871.3 pm, and &quot;c&quot; = 504.4 pm, and the density of . In this phase, the W–F distance is 181 pm, and the mean closest molecular contacts are . Whereas gas is one of the densest gases, with the density exceeding that of the heaviest elemental gas radon (9.73 g/L), the density of in the liquid and solid state is rather moderate.
The vapor pressure of between can be described by the equation
where the &quot;P&quot; = vapor pressure (bar), &quot;T&quot; = temperature (°C).

==History and synthesis==
Tungsten hexafluoride was first obtained by conversion of tungsten hexachloride with hydrogen fluoride by Otto Ruff and Fritz Eisner in 1905.

The compound is now commonly produced by the exothermic reaction of fluorine gas with tungsten powder at a temperature between :
The gaseous product is separated from , a common impurity, by distillation. In a variation on the direct fluorination, the metal is placed in a heated reactor, slightly pressurized to , with a constant flow of infused with a small amount of fluorine gas.

The fluorine gas in the above method can be substituted by ClF,  or . An alternative procedure for producing tungsten fluoride is to treat tungsten trioxide () with HF, or . And besides HF, other fluorinating agents can also be used to convert tungsten hexachloride in a way similar to Ruff and Eisner original method:
: or

==Reactions==
On contact with water, tungsten hexafluoride gives hydrogen fluoride (HF) and tungsten oxyfluorides, eventually forming tungsten trioxide:

Unlike some other metal fluorides, is not a useful fluorinating agent nor is it a powerful oxidant. It can be reduced to the yellow .

 forms a variety of 1:1 and 1:2 adducts with Lewis bases, examples being .

==Applications in semiconductor industry==
The dominant application of tungsten fluoride is in semiconductor industry, where it is widely used for depositing tungsten metal in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. The expansion of the industry in the 1980s and 1990s resulted in the increase of consumption, which remains at around 200 tonnes per year worldwide. Tungsten metal is attractive because of its relatively high thermal and chemical stability, as well as low resistivity (5.6 μΩ·cm) and very low electromigration. is favored over related compounds, such as or , because of its higher vapor pressure resulting in higher deposition rates. Since 1967, two deposition routes have been developed and employed, thermal decomposition and hydrogen reduction. The required gas purity is rather high and varies between 99.98% and 99.9995% depending on the application.

 molecules have to be split up in the CVD process. The decomposition is usually facilitated by mixing with hydrogen, silane, germane, diborane, phosphine, and related hydrogen-containing gases.

===Silicon===
 reacts upon contact with a silicon substrate. The decomposition on silicon is temperature-dependent:
: below 400 °C and
: above 400 °C.

This dependence is crucial, as twice as much silicon is being consumed at higher temperatures. The deposition occurs selectively on pure silicon only, but not on silicon oxide or silicon nitride, thus the reaction is highly sensitive to contamination or substrate pre-treatment. The decomposition reaction is fast, but saturates when the tungsten layer thickness reaches 10–15 micrometers. The saturation occurs because the tungsten layer stops diffusion of molecules to the Si substrate which is the only catalyst of molecular decomposition in this process.

If the deposition occurs not in an inert atmosphere but in an oxygen-containing atmosphere (air), then instead of tungsten, a tungsten oxide layer is produced.

===Hydrogen===
The deposition process occurs at temperatures between 300 and 800 °C and results in formation of hydrogen fluoride vapors:

The crystallinity of the produced tungsten layers can be controlled by altering the / ratio and the substrate temperature: low ratios and temperatures result in (100) oriented tungsten crystallites whereas higher values favor the (111) orientation. Formation of HF is a drawback, as the HF vapor is very aggressive and etches away most materials. Also, the deposited tungsten shows poor adhesion to the silicon dioxide which is the main passivation material in semiconductor electronics. Therefore, has to be covered with an extra buffer layer prior to the tungsten deposition. On the other hand, etching by HF may be beneficial to remove unwanted impurity layers.

===Silane and germane===
The characteristic features of tungsten deposition from the / are high speed, good adhesion and layer smoothness. The drawbacks are explosion hazard and high sensitivity of the deposition rate and morphology to the process parameters, such as mixing ratio, substrate temperature, etc. Therefore, silane is commonly used to create a thin tungsten nucleation layer. It is then switched to hydrogen, that slows down the deposition and cleans up the layer.

Deposition from / mixture is similar to that of /, but the tungsten layer becomes contaminated with relatively (compared to Si) heavy germanium up to concentrations of 10–15%. This increases tungsten resistance from about 5 to 200 μΩ·cm.

==Other applications==
 can be used for the production of tungsten carbide.

As a heavy gas, can be used as a buffer to control gas reactions. For example, it slows down the chemistry of the Ar// flame and reduces the flame temperature.

==Safety==
Tungsten hexafluoride is an extremely corrosive compound that attacks any tissue. Because of the formation of hydrofluoric acid upon reaction of with humidity, storage vessels have Teflon gaskets.

<text>Gudbrandsdalen (; ) is a valley and traditional district in the Norwegian county of Innlandet (formerly Oppland). The valley is oriented in a north-westerly direction from Lillehammer and the lake of Mjøsa, extending toward the Romsdalen valley. The river Gudbrandsdalslågen (Lågen) flows through the valley, starting from the lake Lesjaskogsvatnet and ending at the lake Mjøsa. The Otta river which flows through Otta valley is a major tributary to the main river Lågen. The valleys of the tributary rivers such as Otta and Gausa (Gausdal) are usually regarded as part of Gudbrandsdalen. The total area of the valley is calculated from the areas of the related municipalities. Gudbrandsdalen is the main valley in a web of smaller valleys. On the western (right hand) side there are long adjacent valleys: Ottadalen stretches from Otta village, Gausdal some from Lillehammer and Heidal some from Sjoa. Gudbrandsdalen runs between the major mountain ranges of Norway including Jotunheimen and Dovrefjell–Rondane.

Together with the Glomma river and the Østerdalen valley, the river Lågen and the Gudbrandsdalen valley form Norway&#x27;s largest drainage system covering major parts of Eastern Norway. Gudbrandsdalen is home to Dovre Line railway and the European route E6 highway. The valley is the main land transport corridor through Eastern Norway, from Oslo and central eastern lowlands to Trondheim and Møre og Romsdal.

The valley is divided into three parts: Norddalen (Northern valley; the municipalities of Lesja, Dovre, Skjåk, Lom, Vågå and Sel), Midtdalen (middle valley; the municipalities of Nord-Fron, Sør-Fron and Ringebu), and Sørdalen (Southern valley; the municipalities of Øyer, Gausdal and Lillehammer). The municipalities within the valley fall under the Vestre Innlandet District Court. Until 2016, the valley was also a police district. The Gudbrandsdalen district covers about 60% of the former Oppland county.

The invention of the modern, firm, fatty variant of Brunost cheese is commonly attributed to the milkmaid Anne Hov from the rural valley.

The main character in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s play Peer Gynt was inspired by a real or legendary person living in the valley in the 18th or 17th century. Ibsen travelled through the valley in 1862 and collected local stories, legends and poems. Ibsen also made drawings from his trip, including &quot;Elstad in Gudbrandsdalen&quot;.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Gudbrandsdalen&quot; means &#x27;the valley/dale of Gudbrand&#x27;. &quot;Gudbrand&quot; (Old Norse &quot;Guðbrandr&quot;) is an old male name compounded of &quot;guð&quot;, &#x27;god&#x27; and &quot;brandr&quot;, &#x27;sword&#x27;. The name may be derived from a chief (&quot;hersir&quot;) called Gudbrand. According Icelandic historian and poet Snorri Sturluson, the district was also referred to as &quot;i Dalom&quot; (&quot;in the valleys&quot;) because of the many valleys. Dale-Gudbrand settled in Hundorp, Sør-Fron. At the time of Halfdan the Black there was a &quot;chief Gudbrand north in Gubrandsdalen&quot; (&quot;Gudbrand herse nord i Dalom&quot;). Later Eric Bloodaxe had an opponent called Dale-Gudbrand. According to the sage Olaf II of Norway met one Dale-Gudbrand, supposedly the last Dale-Gudbrand, in 1021. Historians believe there was a regional centre at Hundorp during the Viking era and that the name Gudbrand was used for many generations by the ruling family. Burial mounds (tumulus) at Hundorp suggest that powerful men are buried there.

== Geography ==
The Gudbrandsdalen valley includes the most arid area in Norway. At Skjåk the average annual precipitation is only . The valley sits in the rain shadow of the mountains west (including Jotunheimen), north, and east of the valley. The valley is less incised than the valleys of western Norway. Farming is mostly confined to the relatively narrow areas along the rivers. Gudbrandsdalen and adjacent valleys are surrounded by wide uplands and mountain plateaus traditional used as &quot;seter&quot; or summer farms.

In July 1789 the Storofsen flood disaster occurred and Gudbrandsdalslågen overflooded. This is the largest flood recorded in Norway and the valley was particularly affected. 61 people perished. About 3000 houses were totally damaged and some thousand livestock drowned. All bridges disappeared. Lågen rose up to above its normal level and covered most of the valley floor. A number of farmers abandoned their damaged farms and settled in Målselv, Troms county. The second largest flood occurred in the summer of 1995 and again the valley floor was largely covered by water. After Storofsen the valley floor upstream from Sel Church changed into bogs and shallow lakes because stone and gravel changed the flow of Lågen. From around 1910 drainage efforts left some of dry farmland on what is still known as the Sel bogs. The toxic cicuta virosa thrived on those bogs before they were drained and are known in Norwegian as &quot;selsnepe&quot; (literally Sel turnip). The valley floor in Lesja (between Dombås and Lora) were originally covered by a shallow lake. Drainage efforts from 1860 abolished the lake and left some of farmland. The central part of the valley is covered by the Losna lake, some deep.

== Geology ==
The valley of Gudbrandsdalen is of considerable antiquity considering the overall development of the relief of Norway. The valley runs across the height axis of the southern Scandinavian Mountains —a characteristic that could be indicating that the valley formed before the tectonic uplift of Norway. The valley is one of several valleys of southern Norway that existed already as part of the ancient Paleic relief but had at the time gentler slopes. Gudbrandsdalen formed and developed originally as a valley of fluvial origin. Only millions of year later was the valley re-shaped by glaciers during the Quaternary period. As the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet melted and retreated during the end of the last ice age a large but an ephemeral ice-dammed lake formed in the valley.

== History ==
The valley was shaped by the recent ice age and rivers from the present glacial areas in Jotunheimen and Dovre. Bones and teeth from mammoths and musk oxen, living in the area at that time, are found in the valley. Several traces of hunters from the Stone Age are found in the valley (and in the mountain areas around). There is a rock carving of moose in the northern part of Lillehammer. Gudbrandsdalen has always hosted the main road between Trondheim and the central eastern lowlands. In Old Norse known as &quot;þjóðvegr&quot; (&quot;tjodvei&quot;), &quot;people&#x27;s road&quot; or &quot;everybody&#x27;s road&quot;.

=== Legendary history ===

Raum the Old was the father of Dale-Gudbrand, and he settled in Hundorp. The Gudbrand Valley is mentioned extensively in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; (Chronicle of the Kings of Norway) by Snorri Sturluson. The account of King Olaf&#x27;s (A.D. 1015–1021) conversion of Dale-Gudbrand to Christianity is popularly recognized. According to the saga Gudbrand built a church there &quot;in the valleys&quot;, possibly at Haave farm near Hundorp where archaeological evidence indicates what may have been the first church in the valley. In 1206, the heir to the Norwegian throne, Håkon Håkonsson, was saved by birkebeiners with a ski-run from Lillehammer to Rena.

Until the Black Plague settlement expanded and new farms were established at outskirts. Farms with names &quot;-gard&quot;, &quot;-rud&quot;, &quot;-hus&quot;, and &quot;-li&quot; are mostly from this expansion period. During the High Middle Ages about 40 churches existed, most built in wood except for instances masonry churches in Easter Gausdal and Follebu. Hamar episcopal see was established in 1152 and its jurisdiction included Gudbrandsdalen. Garmo Stave Church and Ringebu Stave Church are examples of ancient wooden churches. Fåvang Stave Church and Vågå Church include parts from older churches. The Black Plague reduced the population in Gudbrandsdal by 50 to 70% during 1349 to 1350. Saksum, Brekkom, Skåbo, Venabygd and other districts were left largely deserted for centuries. Inhabitants from marginal areas presumably relocated to the main valley and other areas with vacant land. A large number of clergy also perished during the plague and churches fell into disrepair. During the 1600s the population again reached the same level as in 1300. During the 1500s the area had about 6000 inhabitants. No census was taken before 1665 and population figures are based on estimates. This resulted in a temporary improvement for the lower classes as crofters became scarce and the poor were able to rent the better farms.

=== Older history ===
During the Reformation in 1537, the Church of Norway was subordinated to the &quot;lendmenn&quot; or sheriffs. Church property was appropriated by the Crown and the King became the biggest landowner in the valley. The Battle of Kringen took place in 1612, near Otta, Norway, and the local &quot;Gudbrandsdøls&quot; defeated a Scottish mercenary army. The legends of this battle live on to this day, including the story of how the peasant girl &quot;Prillar-Guri&quot; lured the Scots into an ambush by playing the traditional ram&#x27;s horn. The 1665 census indicates a population of 13,000.
In 1670 to 1725, most of the royal property was sold off to pay for war debts, first to established property holders, but increasingly to peasant proprietors. A freeholders&#x27; era began and a new &quot;upper class&quot; of landholders was formed. &quot;Storofsa&quot; happened in 1789, and is the greatest flood recorded in the Gudbrand Valley; several farms were devastated, and many people died.

=== Modern history ===
In 1827, the town of Lillehammer is established. The paddle steamer Skibladner on Mjøsa and Hovedbanen (the first railroad in Norway) connected the valley to the capital city, Christiania, in 1856. The Hamar-Selbanen railway was completed to Tretten in 1894. Hamar-Selbanen changed its name to the Dovre Line in 1921, and the new main railway between Oslo and Trondheim, was completed through the valley. The outdoor museum of Maihaugen, exhibiting historical architecture from all parts of the valley, opened at Lillehammer in 1904.

From around 1865 the population declined substantially because of emigration to North America. Until 1946 the majority of inhabitants worked in farming.

There was severe fighting in the valley at Tretten and Kvam, as well as in Dombås, during World War II. The Battle of Dombås was an attempt to stop the German advance. British troops engaged German troops in land battles for the first time in World War 2 after many months of Phoney War.

Lillehammer was the site of the Lillehammer affair in 1973, wherein operatives of the Israeli Mossad shot and killed a Moroccan waiter they mistakenly thought was Ali Hassan Salameh, who was involved in the Munich Massacre.

The 1994 Winter Olympics were celebrated at Lillehammer.

The 2016 Youth Olympics were celebrated at Lillehammer.

<text>Cianjur () is a town and district in the West Java province of Indonesia, and is the seat of Cianjur Regency. The district of Cianjur is located along one of the main roads between Jakarta (120 km to the northwest) and Bandung (60 km to the east). The population was 158,125 at the 2010 Census and 173,265 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2022 was 176,368. Because of its location, some of Cianjur&#x27;s residents commute to work in Bandung.

The road on which Cianjur is located used to be the main (extremely busy) road from Jakarta to Bandung but was in effect replaced as the main road link between these two main cities when the Jakarta-Bandung tollroad was fully completed in 2005. However, due to its low traffic, Cianjur returned as one of the alternative routes for travellers from Jakarta and Bandung.

==History==

Cianjur was founded in 1677, with the first head of the town being R. A. Wiratanudatar I, entitled Dalem Cikundul, as the descendant from the old Sundanese city of Pajajaran.

By 2007 the city government asked female municipal employees to wear &quot;jilbab&quot; (hijab). It also placed road signs encouraging women to wear &quot;jilbab&quot;.

A magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck offshore West Java on September 2, 2009, killing 21 people in Cianjur alone.

Another 5.6 magnitude earthquake occurred on November 21, 2022, killing 331 and injuring 7,729 others.

==Administrative divisions==
Cianjur district is divided into 11 administrative villages which are as follows:

*Babakankaret
*Bojongherang
*Limbangansari
*Mekarsari
*Muka
*Nagrak
*Pamoyanan
*Sawahgede
*Sayang
*Solokpandan
*Sukamaju
==Economy==
The district mainly produces home and micro Industrial products, especially leather, wood, precious metals, woven, pottery, fabrics, and foods.

==Transportation==
After being dormant for about 2 years, the train called &quot;Siliwangi&quot; between Sukabumi and Cianjur was reactivated on 8 February 2014. It is faster than the buses which are usually trapped in traffic jams, but the cost of a train ticket is double that of using buses.

==Climate==
Cianjur has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with moderate rainfall from June to September and heavy rainfall from October to May.
==Notable residents==
* Djumhana Wiriaatmadja (1904–1975) politician and diplomat
* Mohammad Enoch (1893–1965) engineer and politician
* Robi Darwis (b. 2003) footballer
* Rd Mochtar (b. 1918) actor
* Nyonya The Tiang Ek, 1920s–30s writer and translator
* Utuy Tatang Sontani (1920–1979) writer and university lecturer

<doc id="897924" wikidata="Q3338998" url="?curid=897924" title="New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival">
<text>The New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival (commonly called Jazz Fest or Jazzfest) is an annual celebration of local music and culture held at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans, Louisiana. Jazz Fest attracts thousands of visitors to New Orleans each year. The New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival and Foundation Inc., as it is officially named, was established in 1970 as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization (NPO). The Foundation is the original organizer of the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival presented by Shell Oil Company, a corporate financial sponsor. The Foundation was established primarily to redistribute the funds generated by Jazz Fest into the local community. As an NPO, their mission further states that the Foundation &quot;promotes, preserves, perpetuates and encourages the music, culture and heritage of communities in Louisiana through festivals, programs and other cultural, educational, civic and economic activities&quot;. The founders of the organization included pianist and promoter George Wein, producer Quint Davis and the late Allison Miner.

In addition to the Festival, the organization&#x27;s other assets include radio station WWOZ 90.7 FM, the Jazz &amp; Heritage Foundation Archive and The George &amp; Joyce Wein Jazz &amp; Heritage Center. The Foundation also raises funds by holding the Jazz &amp; Heritage Gala every year and provides several educational programs and a variety of more targeted festivals.

Because of concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 marked the first year in the fifty-year history of Jazz Fest that the two-week festival has been cancelled. It was originally rescheduled to take place October 8–17, 2021, but later cancelled completely. 2022 saw its resumption after a two-year hiatus.

==Background==
In 1962, Olaf Lambert, the manager of the Royal Orleans Hotel in the French Quarter contacted George Wein, a jazz mogul and founder of the Newport Jazz Festival and the Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island and asked him to bring his festival model to New Orleans. Wein met with Mayor Victor H. Schiro, Seymour Weiss a hotel executive and civic leader, and a few members of the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce to discuss the proposition. They decided that New Orleans and the South were not ready for a jazz festival. It was a time in the city&#x27;s history that was fraught with racism and segregationists reminiscent of the Jim Crow era. City ordinances were still in place that prohibited interaction between black and white musicians, tourists and locals and prevented revitalization of the economy in this manner.

Two years after their initial meeting, Lambert again contacted George Wein and asked him to plan what was to be called the New Orleans International Jazz Festival for the spring of 1965. Racial tensions were on the rise, and the non-profit community effort was postponed because of &quot;integration tensions&quot;. In the meantime, the proposed Annual New Orleans International Jazz Festival moved ahead under the auspices of attorney Dean A. Andrews Jr. Community organizations such as the New Orleans Jazz Club were not invited, and the event failed to attract big names, which Andrews claimed was by design. &quot;Our idea is not to bring in big-time musicians. We want to tell the story of the New Orleans sound, to show the evolution of New Orleans jazz.&quot;

In 1967, Durel Black, a local businessman and president of the New Orleans Jazz Club, convinced the local Chamber of Commerce that it was time to make another attempt at starting a jazz festival in New Orleans. The city would celebrate its 250th anniversary in 1968, and Black recognized it as an opportunity to promote the festival. Wein was asked again to develop the festival; however, when it was discovered that his wife Joyce was African-American, the offer was retracted, and events director Tommy Walker was hired instead. A jazz festival was planned, and evening concerts were held in 1968 under the billing The International Jazzfest with headliners that included Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and a variety of other artists.

In 1969, a second International Jazzfest took place, resulting in a negative return on investment, despite its big name lineup. Durel Black contacted Wein yet again, assured him that his interracial marriage was no longer an issue, and asked him to take charge of the festival. Wein agreed and was prepared and motivated to protect the culture and heritage in Louisiana. However, he also recognized the barriers that prevented the International JazzFest of &#x27;69 from flourishing. He concluded that the format of the festival had to be changed from the ground up, and that local collaboration was necessary for it to succeed. He contacted Allan Jaffe, director of Preservation Hall, who arranged the necessary connections with Allison Miner, Quint Davis and several other promoters.

==Foundation history and founding==
The New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival was established in 1970 under the guidance and vision of George Wein. The Festival achieved instant artistic success, despite its initial attendance of only 350 people. Wein&#x27;s vision was straightforward: he wanted a large daytime fair with multiple stages featuring a diverse range of locally produced music styles, Louisiana cuisine food booths, and arts and crafts booths, as well as an evening concert series that would appeal to everyone. Wein also sought to develop a new perspective that would add a level of excitement to the festival presentation, and appeal to both The Crescent City culture and those who simply wanted to learn more about the city&#x27;s unique way of life. In addition to local customs, he emphasized African, Caribbean, and French culture, and was able to present the music, cuisine and crafts of various cultures to the world through Jazz Fest in a way that was enjoyable and exciting.

The first Jazz Fest took place in 1970 outside the French Quarter in a park &quot;that was once the site of Congo Square – the space where, during the 18th century, enslaved people gathered to trade, dance, and play music from their countries of origin.&quot; In 1972, after relocating to the infield of the Fair Grounds Race Course, Jazz Fest expanded by utilizing the entire site. By 1975, the inaugural year of the Festival&#x27;s limited-edition, silkscreen poster series, attendance was expected to reach 80,000. From 1976 to 1978, Jazz Fest expanded to two full weekends in conjunction with the Heritage Fair, and in 1979, the Festival expanded to three weekends to celebrate its tenth anniversary.
By the early 1980s, the Festival continued growing in popularity, earning widespread recognition as one of the world&#x27;s cultural celebrations. From the 1970s to the 1980s, Jazz Fest contributed to an unprecedented boom in tourism that earned Crescent City the moniker &quot;Creole Disneyland&quot;. In 2017, total attendance for Jazz Fest was about 425,000 over seven days, exceeding the total population of Orleans Parish per prior census estimates. Pre-COVID-19, the attendance had grown to nearly 500,000.

Over the years, the Festival has had its share of financial difficulties, as well as an identity crisis on stage and in the tents. Local African-American activists accused the Festival of exploiting its performers and under-representing the communities that made Jazz Fest possible. Internal conflicts also arose which left the 1982 Festival temporarily without board member Quint Davis, who handled the Festival&#x27;s production. In 1983, Davis returned and has produced it ever since.

The year 2020 marks the first year in the Festival&#x27;s fifty-year history to be cancelled because of concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. The event was rescheduled to take place in the Fall 2021, October 8–17, which is within the Atlantic hurricane season.

== Yearly posters ==
For every Jazz Fest from 1984 to 2020 &amp; since 2022, there have been a series of posters released that are related to that year&#x27;s event. These posters have become some of the most widely recognized pieces of art in the New Orleans/Louisiana area. They are sold at the festival and after the festival online and in many art stores around the area. Posters gain significant value as time goes on.

==Festival features==

The Festival features a variety of local food and craft vendors. The official food policy of the Festival is &quot;no carnival food&quot;. There are more than seventy food booths that include local dishes like crawfish beignets, cochon de lait sandwiches, alligator sausage po&#x27; boy (sandwich), boiled crawfish, softshell crab po&#x27;boy, Cajun jambalaya, jalapeño bread, fried green tomatoes, Oyster patties, muffulettas, red beans and rice, and crawfish Monica. Vegan and vegetarian options are also available. All food vendors are small, locally owned businesses. Jazz Fest ranks second to Mardi Gras in terms of local economic impact.

Craft vendors are set up throughout the grounds, as are craft-making demonstrations. There are three main areas including the Congo Square African Marketplace, which features crafts from local, national, and international artisans; the Contemporary Crafts area, which features handmade clothing, leather goods, jewelry, paintings, sculptures, and musical instruments; and the Louisiana Marketplace, which displays baskets, hand-colored photographs, jewelry and landscape-themed art.

The Festival allocates large areas dedicated to cultural and historical practices unique to Louisiana. There are depictions of the many cultures that exist in the state, such as the Cajun culture, and the Los Isleños, who are descendants of native Canary Islanders. Some of the areas include the Louisiana Folklife Village, which focuses on state art and culture, the Native American Village and the Grandstand. The National Endowment of the Arts has recognized many the work of many of the folk demonstrators.

Parades are also held throughout the event. They include parades by the Mardi Gras Indians, marching bands, brass bands, and social aid and pleasure clubs.

== Stages and tents ==
Jazz Fest grew to become one of the best festivals to watch local artists and musicians, such as the Rebirth Brass Band, Juvenile, and Fats Domino, in addition to well-known musicians like Ray Charles, Tina Turner and James Brown in the Tremé backyard. After 1972, the festival moved to the Gentilly community. By 2010, Jazz Fest had become more commercialized with headliners such as the Foo Fighters and Christina Aguilera, shifting away from its jazz-dominated roots.

The festival has various performance stages including:

The Congo Square stage name pays homage to a gathering place where enslaved black people would meet to sell goods to buy their freedom, play instruments, and dance. Under the Code Noir, Catholic slavemasters allowed their slaves to have Sundays off. That day off helped to preserve the tradition and spirit of African dancing and drumming. The name of the gathering area was changed to Louis Armstrong Park, where drummers traditionally perform on Sundays in honor of their enslaved ancestors.

In 2015, Jazz Fest honored the 40th birthday of New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA). Displays included student artwork; live performances of spoken word and musical theater were featured at the Cultural Pavilion. NOCCA Alumni showcased their musical talents at the Zatarains/WWOZ Jazz Tent, where they paid homage to the legacy of Ellis Marsalis Jr. The festival has an ongoing partnership with local schools like NOCCA to give young artists an opportunity to showcase their talents to a larger audience.

== Performers ==

The festival has featured a variety of musicians and performers every year since its founding, ranging from Louisiana musicians to international pop stars. Many popular New Orleans musicians have played annually for long stretches over the history of the festival such as the Neville Brothers, Dr. John, Ellis Marsalis, and The Radiators.

Applications to perform (from the general public) are limited to bands from Louisiana to promote and preserve local culture.

== The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation ==
The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization that presents the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. The foundation was formed in 1970 as the festival&#x27;s nonprofit arm. Festival founders George Wein, Quint Davis and Allison Miner trusted that Jazz Fest would be a success, despite a slow start in ticket sales. Their foresight led to the decision to establish the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation as a nonprofit, allowing the opportunity to give the proceeds back to the local community by way of cultural programming when revenue increased.

Over the years, festival revenue increased, but the Foundation struggled to cover costs associated with its programs. In 2004, Don Marshall was brought on board as the Foundation&#x27;s executive director. Other sources of funding come from galas and special events, corporate donors, individual donations and public and private grants.

The Foundation operates with a full-time staff and a four-part board of directors that includes a voting board, advisory council, Past Presidents Senate and an Honor Council. Its mission statement says: &quot;The New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival and Foundation, Inc. promotes, preserves, perpetuates and encourages the music, culture and heritage of communities in Louisiana through festivals, programs and other cultural, educational, civic and economic activities.&quot;

The Foundation maintains active involvement with the local community through its assets, programming and educational enrichment. The local programs range from teaching Jazz to local teens, to preserving recordings, artifacts and interviews. The programs aid in economic growth by providing jobs for local artists and entertainers while offering entertainment to citizens.

=== Foundation assets ===
The following resources were created by the Foundation as sources of funding to provide year-round programming that focuses on cultural education, economic development and cultural enrichment.

* The New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival
* WWOZ 90.7 FM – a local radio station based in the French Quarter with programs by volunteers whose mission is &quot;to be the worldwide voice, archive, and flag-bearer of New Orleans culture and musical heritage&quot;. In 2020, the station celebrated its 40th anniversary and gained national news coverage after its efforts to provide a sense of &quot;normalcy&quot; in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. WWOZ 90.7 FM broadcasts live during Jazz Fest and provides local, cultural content year round.
* Jazz &amp; Heritage Foundation Archive – an educational resource that acts as a repository for items of historical and cultural importance in Louisiana. The Archive consists mainly of recordings from the Festival, but also features magazines, posters, film and photographs. The artifacts are available for scholarly research, and fellowships are granted to encourage use of the archive.
* The George &amp; Joyce Wein Jazz &amp; Heritage Center – a performance and education venue that also serves as the location for the Don &quot;Moose&quot; Jamison Heritage School of Music and the Foundations year-round programming. The center is named after Jazz Fest founder George Wein and his wife, Joyce.
* The Jazz &amp; Heritage Gala – a celebration that raises funds for free music education in New Orleans. The proceeds are donated to the Don &quot;Moose&quot; Jamison Heritage School of Music which provides music education to over 280 students in the city.

=== Educational programming ===
* Don &quot;Moose&quot; Jamison Heritage School of Music – The School of Music is the Foundation&#x27;s unique cultural education program which began in 1990 as an after-school program. Initially, the school was tuition-free and taught only a few students on the campus of Southern University at New Orleans. In 2014, the George and Joyce Wein Jazz &amp; Heritage Center opened in Tremé. The center is the permanent location of the School and instructs over 200 students each week. Classes now range from after-school to weekends and utilize instrumental techniques, ear training and composition to teach the art of music and performance.
* Tom Dent Congo Square Lecture Series – Tom Dent (1932–1998), born to Ernestine and Albert W. Dent. Dent was an African-American cultural activist and poet from New Orleans. He was influenced by cultural writers of African-American struggles. Dent served as the executive director of the Foundation from 1987 to 1990. While serving on the board, he founded the Congo Square Lecture Series. After his death, the name was changed to The Tom Dent Congo Square Lecture series in his honor. The series was created to engage local creatives in scholarly conversations surrounding culture and African-American history. Topics range from Jazz and Creole history, Carnival around the world and the evolution of jazz funerals in New Orleans.
* Class Got Brass Contest – a &#x27;Battle of the Brass Bands&#x27; for all middle and high schools in Louisiana that was created to encourage school band programs to participate in the musical culture of New Orleans. The winner receives music education funds for their school. Prizes range from $1,000 to $10,000 and non-winners receive a $1,000 stipend for participating. Each band is limited to 12 members, and each member must be currently enrolled in the competing school. Judges consider originality, adherence to tradition, improvisation, tightness and overall presentation when deciding winners.
* Songwriting Workshops for Kids with PJ Morton – a series of songwriting workshops that are open to middle and high school students in New Orleans. The workshops and applications are free but are limited to 30 students. Students learn songwriting techniques from PJ Morton.
* Mardi Gras Indian Beading and African Drumming Workshops – a series of free workshops that take place at the George and Joyce Wein Jazz &amp; Heritage Center. Beading workshops are led by Howard Miller, the chief of the Creole Wild West Mardi Gras Indian tribe. Miller teaches the workshops to students ages 10–17 in New Orleans. Drumming workshops are led by Luther Gray, head of the Congo Square Preservation Society. Gray provides drums to students who cannot provide their own.

=== Economic development programming ===
* Jazz &amp; Heritage Music Relief Fund – a statewide relief fund to support musicians who have lost income due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic caused venue closures all around the world and left many New Orleans&#x27; musicians without a source of income. The Fund has provided emergency grants to over 2500 musicians in the city and the campaign for fundraising is ongoing. Donations continue to be received from organizations like Spotify, Michael Murphy Productions, the Goldring Foundation and the Bentson Foundation.
* Community Partnership Grants – proceeds from the Festival are invested back into the community. Over $8 million has been redistributed through community partnership grants to fund cultural projects, all of which must align with the Foundation&#x27;s mission. Recent category additions include the Louisiana Cultural Equity Arts Grant which allows BIPOC creatives to focus on creating new works. Applications are accepted from all over Louisiana, and represent a wide range of diversity.
* Jazz &amp; Heritage Film Festival – the Foundation works with the New Orleans Video Access Center to put on a festival that showcases documentaries about south Louisiana or that are produced by New Orleans filmmakers. The festival lasts three days and includes screenings and networking for film industry professionals. A majority of the featured films have been awarded funding from the Foundation&#x27;s Community Partnership Grants. The festival takes place in February at the George and Joyce Wein Jazz &amp; Heritage Center.
* The Catapult Fund – the Foundation supports the local restaurant industry by providing small business owners with funding and business training by way of the Catapult Fund. Funding partners of the Catapult Fund have included Capital One Bank, the Louisiana Small Business Development Center (LSBDC,) the Louisiana Cultural Economy Foundation (LCEF,) and the Ashé Cultural Arts Center. The Fund is open to small business owners in the food and beverage and culinary arts industry. These businesses can include LLC&#x27;s, sole proprietorships, and incorporated businesses. Over a period of five months, accepted applicants attend 17 free instructional classes focused on business development. Those who participate in the course receive a food safety training certification and leave with new knowledge of key strategies for running a successful business by addressing solutions to the unique challenges the restaurant sector faces in New Orleans. Additionally, a grant pool of $50,000 is portioned and rewarded to participants who successfully complete the course.

=== Cultural enrichment programming ===
* Jazz &amp; Heritage Concerts – the Jazz &amp; Heritage Concert Series consists of concerts presented by the Foundation throughout the year, in the off-season of Jazz Fest. The concerts are admission free and held at the George and Joyce Wein Jazz &amp; Heritage Center. The Foundation also presents two free concerts during Jazz Fest each year. The concerts not only highlight local favorites but artists from different parts of the country. The concert series has followed themes that highlight underrepresented populations. The most recent series, titled &quot;Chanteuse: Celebrating New Orleans Women in Music&quot;, was scheduled for the weekend of March 13, 2020, but was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The series focuses on women and/or femme-identifying persons to bring attention to the lack of female representation in the music industry. Reports show that women accounted for 21.7% of all artists in 2019, and the ratio of male to female producers was 37 to 1. Cyrille Aimée, Germaine Bazzle and Maggie Koerner were among the artists initially scheduled to perform. A visual arts exhibit called &quot;Femme Fest&quot;, sponsored by the Women&#x27;s Caucus for Art of Louisiana (WCALA,) was set to be featured at the Jazz &amp; Heritage Art Gallery as a part of the series as well.
* Crescent City Blues &amp; BBQ Festival – the Crescent City Blues &amp; BBQ Festival is a free celebration of music, food and art presented by the Foundation. The festivities typically take place in Lafayette Square and showcase artists like Little Freddie King.
* Treme&#x27; Creole Gumbo Festival and Congo Square Rhythms Festival – the Treme’ Creole Gumbo Festival and the Congo Square Rhythms Festival are admission free festivals presented by the Foundation, and are typically held in Armstrong Park. In 2019 the Congo Square Rhythms Festival took place simultaneously; therefore, the two could work together to increase their impact on the city. African Drumming, Jazz, Funk and Gospel are among the performances that represent the African diaspora&#x27;s cultural impact on New Orleans.
* Louisiana Cajun-Zydeco Festival – an admission free festival presented by the Foundation that focuses on Cajun and Zydeco music and takes place in the Spring at Armstrong Park. Much like other Foundation festivals, local art, food and entertainment are showcased at this annual two-day event. Vendors sell seafood, especially crawfish, while art markets and youth activities are available.
* Johnny Jackson Jr. Gospel Is Alive Celebration – an outreach program for senior citizens in New Orleans. The concert is admission free and held at the Franklin Avenue Baptist Church. Foundation board member, Johnny Jackson Jr. supported this specific concert from its onset in 1990. It was eventually named after him in honor of his support. Past performers have included the Gospel Soul Children and Rance Allen. Each year Gospel Is Alive! recognizes those who have contributed to the gospel community in a significant way.

<text>Vasily Ivanovich Chapayev (; 5 September 1919) was a Russian soldier and Red Army commander during the Russian Civil War.
==Biography==
Chapayev was born into a poor peasant family in a village called , now part of Cheboksary. During World War I, he fought as a non-commissioned officer and was awarded the Cross of St. George three times. 

In September 1917, he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks). In December he was elected commander of the 138 Infantry Regiment by a vote of the regiment&#x27;s soldiers. He later commanded the 2nd Nikolaev Division and the 25th Rifle Division.

===Death===
On 5 September 1919, the divisional headquarters near Lbishchensk (renamed Chapayev in his honour) were ambushed by White Army forces (). The circumstances of Chapayev&#x27;s death are uncertain and his body was never recovered. The canonical version that the wounded Chapayev drowned when trying to cross the Ural River was particularly popularized by the 1934 &quot;Chapayev&quot; (which was approved by Stalin himself and quickly gained the cult status not only in the Soviet Union, but among Russian emigrants as well).

Several other versions have been in circulation. In 1926, the newspapers Pravda, Izvestia and &quot;Krasnaya Zvezda&quot; reported on the arrest of the former Cossack officer Trofimov-Mirsky, who allegedly shot Chapaev after capturing him during a raid on Lbishensk. Chapaev&#x27;s daughter Clavdiya and his great-granddaughter Yevgeniya wrote about the betrayal of the commander and the organization of his death by Leon Trotsky, as well as about the participation in the conspiracy of Pelageya Kameshkertseva. None of the &quot;non-canonical&quot; versions received documentary evidence.

==Private life==
In 1908 Chapayev became acquainted with Pelageya Metelina, who was 18. Although his father didn&#x27;t approve of their relations, Chapayev married her. They lived together for 6 years, and had three children, one of whom was Klavdiya Chapayeva. Though there was no official divorce, in 1917 Chapayev started living with the widow of his deceased fellow-soldier Pyotr Kishkertsev. Curiously enough, her name was also Pelageya. Chapayev adopted both of her children. Currently the only relative that remains is his great-great-granddaughter Vasilisa Chapayeva, with her parents Yevgenia Chapayeva and Viktor Pecherin.

==Legacy==

Memorial museums of Chapaev were opened in Cheboksary near the place of his birth; in the city of Pugachev (former Nikolaevsk), with a branch in the city of Balakovo, where he spent his childhood and youth. Museums have also been opened in the buildings where the headquarters of the 25th Infantry Division was located during the Civil War: in the village of Krasny Yar in the Ufimsky district of the Republic of Bashkortostan, in the town of Belebey of the Republic of Bashkortostan, in the city of Uralsk and in the village of Lbischenskaya (now the town of Chapaev) at the site of the last battle division chief. In the Soviet years, museums dedicated to Chapaev and the combat path of the 25th division existed in many schools.

Dozens of settlements in the Samara (Chapayevsk), Saratov, Orenburg regions and other regions of Russia are named after Chapaev, Lbishensk in modern Kazakhstan was also renamed in his honor during the Soviet era, Chapaev streets exist in hundreds of settlements on the territory of the former USSR, the Chapaevka River was named after him. In 1937, the Kiev cinema &quot;Lira&quot; on Bolshaya Zhitomirskaya Street, 40 was renamed the &quot;Chapaev cinema&quot;.
Monuments to Chapaev were erected in the cities of Samara (1932), in St. Petersburg (1933), in Pugachev (1957), in Cheboksary (1960) (earlier since the 1930s it was located on the territory of VDNKh in Moscow), in the village of Chapaev - a stele at the site of the alleged death and a monument on the central square (1979), in Uralsk (1982), as well as in dozens of other cities and towns of the former Soviet Union. In 1973, for the museum in Uralsk, Efim Deshalyt painted the diorama &quot;The Last Battle of Chapaev&quot;, in 1976 for the museum in Chapaev - the diorama &quot;Fight of the Chapaevs in the village of Lbischenskaya&quot; by artists Veniamin Sibirsky and Evgeny Danilevsky.

==In Russian culture==
After the Soviet Union had been established, Chapayev was immortalized by Soviet propaganda as a hero of the Russian Civil War. In 1923, a Russian writer, Dmitriy Furmanov, who served as a commissar in Chapayev&#x27;s division wrote a popular novel entitled &quot;Chapaev&quot;. Later, in 1934, it was made into a film &quot;Chapayev&quot; by the Vasilyev brothers. The movie became highly popular in the Soviet Union. The German actor and singer Ernst Busch also recorded the song &quot;Tschapajews Tod&quot;, which talks about his death in the Ural.

More recently, he became one of the central characters in the novel &quot;Chapayev and Void&quot; by modern Russian writer Viktor Pelevin.

In November 1998, Red Comrades Save the Galaxy, a point-and-click graphic adventure game was developed by S.K.I.F. and published by Buka Entertainment (now 1C Company). The game&#x27;s protagonist Vasily Ivanovich Chapaev, is inspired by Chapayev.

Chapayev, along with his aide Petka, commissar Furmanov, and Anka the Mashine-gunner, became a recurring character in popular Russian jokes.

==History==
For a long time, the idea of selling frozen ice cream cones had been impractical, as the ice cream would soak into the moist cone during the manufacturing process and make it soggy and unpalatable when served. In 1959, Spica, an Italian ice cream manufacturer based in Naples, overcame this problem by insulating the inside of the waffle cone from the ice cream with a coating of oil, sugar, and chocolate.

In 1976, the patent was acquired by Unilever, which began marketing the product in Italy through the Algida brand and abroad through other subsidiaries, including Wall&#x27;s in the UK and Pakistan, HB in Ireland, Frigo in Spain and Kwality Wall&#x27;s in India. They are sold in many different sizes throughout Europe in sizes ranging from 28-ml Miniatures to 260-ml King Cones, though the 90-ml and 125-ml sizes tend to be the most popular.

On March 19, 2024, Unilever announced it would divest its ice cream brands and cut 7,500 jobs in order to make &quot;a simpler, more focused and higher performing Unilever&quot;. Included in the spin-off are Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s, Cornetto, Magnum, Talenti, and Wall&#x27;s. The divestment is expected to be completed by the end of 2025.

==Varieties==
The product is available in a variety of flavours, including Strawberry, Mint Chocolate, Nut, Lemon, Whippy (yogurt flavour with a chewy chocolate), Valentine&#x27;s Day flavours, and Cornetto Soft (soft ice cream that comes in chocolate chip, cookie dough,royale strawberry, unicornetto, dragon cornetto, vanilla, chocolate, royale chocolate and double chocolate). Cornetto Soft is sold on the street by vendors and is made on the spot with an ice cream dispenser, but the other flavours are premade and factory packaged. Also, Cornetto Enigma is made, which consists of cookies and cream, raspberry and double chocolate flavours.

Unilever introduced a Cornetto chocolate confectionery into the UK market in 2013, following a licensing deal with Kinnerton Confectionery.

Hindustan Unilever manufacture Cornettos using vegetable fat rather than milk fat, and under Indian law it cannot be advertised as being ice cream.

==Advertising campaigns==

===&#x27;O sole mio campaign===
The brand was marketed in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Brazil by successful advertising campaigns which placed the Neapolitan song &quot;&#x27;O sole mio&quot; into a variety of stereotypical Italian locations and situations, with its lyrics changed to:

:Just one Cornetto,
:give it to me,
:delicious ice cream, of Italy,
:creamy vanilla and choco dream,
:Give me Cornetto,
:from Wall&#x27;s ice cream.
(in the UK)

:give it to me,
:a big ol&#x27; nut and chocolate dream,
:HB Cornetto
:spells the best ice cream.
(in Ireland)

:&quot;Dame un Cornetto&quot;
:&quot;Molto crocante&quot;
:&quot;E più cremoso&quot;
:&quot;É da Gelato.&quot;
:&quot;Cornetto é da própria Itália.&quot;
:&quot;Ti voglio tanto,&quot;
:&quot;Corneeeeetto mio!&quot;
(in Brazil)

In Britain and Ireland, the advertisements ran for 10 years during the 1980s and 1990s, with the song supposedly sung by former Italian waiter Renato Pagliari of one-hit wonders Renée and Renato. (However, this is claimed not to be the case by Pagliari&#x27;s son, Remo.) It was credited to &quot;Count Giovanni Di Regina&quot; and produced by Jonathan King, who released it as a single. In 2000, the Wall&#x27;s Cornetto commercial was ranked 23rd in Channel 4&#x27;s UK poll of &quot;The 100 Greatest TV Ads&quot;. The theme resurfaced in 2006, this time sung by pedestrians, drivers, office workers, and marathon runners in Central London.

===Philippines 20 pesos campaign===
In the Philippines, the &quot; () campaign was launched in 2009, relying on humour and focused on the product&#x27;s affordability, with skits that centre on things one cannot afford with 20 pesos and suggesting that the audience should buy a Cornetto instead. &quot; () and &quot;&quot; () were used as slogans for the campaign.
By May 2011, 30 story-lines had been produced. In 2019, the SRP price of Cornetto became 25 pesos. However, in 2023, this was reverted to 20 pesos again.

The television advertisement entitled &quot;Tugs&quot;, which is part of the campaign, was selected as the Adobo Ad of the Year for 2010 through online voting at the ad agency band night &quot;Lakihan Mo Logo 14&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* The ice cream is referenced in the films &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; (2005), &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; (2007) and &quot;The World’s End&quot; (2013); the three films are together known as the &quot;Three Flavours Cornetto&quot; Trilogy.

<text>Laura Betti ( Trombetti; 1 May 1927 – 31 July 2004) was an Italian actress known particularly for her work with directors Federico Fellini, Pier Paolo Pasolini and Bernardo Bertolucci. She had a long friendship with Pasolini and made a documentary about him in 2001.

Betti became famous for portraying bizarre, grotesque, eccentric, unstable or maniacal roles, like Regina in Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;1900&quot;, Anna the medium in &quot;Twitch of the Death Nerve&quot;, Giovanna la pazza in &quot;Woman Buried Alive&quot;, hysterical Rita Zigai in &quot;Sbatti il mostro in prima pagina&quot;, Therese in &quot;Private Vices, Public Virtues&quot;, Emilia the servant in Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s &quot;Teorema&quot; for which she won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress, and Mildred the protagonist&#x27;s wife in Mario Bava&#x27;s &quot;Hatchet for the Honeymoon&quot;.

==Early life==
Born Laura Trombetti in Casalecchio di Reno, near Bologna, she grew up to be interested in singing. She first worked professionally in the arts as a jazz singer and moved to Rome.

==Film career==
Betti made her film debut in Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960). In 1963, she became a close friend of the poet and movie director Pier Paolo Pasolini. Under his direction, she proved a wonderful talent and played in seven of his films, including &quot;La ricotta&quot; (1963), &quot;Teorema&quot; (&quot;Theorem&quot;, 1968), his 1972 version of &quot;The Canterbury Tales,&quot; in which she played the Wife of Bath, and his controversial &quot;Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom&quot; (1975).

In 1976, Betti portrayed Regina, a cruel and eroto-maniacal fascist in Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;Novecento&quot; (&quot;1900&quot;). She also played Miss Blandish in his &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; (1972), though her single scene was deleted.

In 1973, she dubbed the voice of the Devil for the Italian version of William Friedkin&#x27;s &quot;The Exorcist&quot;.

From the 1960s, Betti dedicated much of her time to literature and politics. She became the muse for a number of leading political and literary figures in Italy and came to personify the revolutionary and Marxist era of 1970s Italy.

In 2001, she made a documentary about Pasolini, &quot;Pier Paolo Pasolini e la ragione di un sogno.&quot; She also donated her papers related to their long friendship along with more than 1000 volumes and many documents connected to Pasolini to the archives of the &quot;Fondazione Cineteca di Bologna&quot;, thus creating the &quot;Centro Studi Archivio Pier Paolo Pasolini&quot;. This &quot;Centro&quot;, strongly wanted by Betti, owns also thousands of photograph and all the works of Pasolini: poetry, literature, cinema and journalism. After her death in 2004, her brother Sergio Trombetti has donated all the personal documents of her career to the &quot;Centro&quot; that has absorbed them under the name &quot;Fondo Laura Betti&quot;.

<doc id="897937" wikidata="Q2708549" url="?curid=897937" title="Great Jubilee">
<text>The Great Jubilee in 2000 was a major event in the Catholic Church, held from Christmas Eve (24 December) 1999 to Epiphany (6 January) 2001. Like previous Jubilee years, it was a celebration of the mercy of God and forgiveness of sins. The major innovation in this Jubilee was the addition of many &quot;particular Jubilees&quot; for various groups of persons, and that it was simultaneously celebrated in Rome, Israel, and elsewhere in the world.

==Preparations==
Preparation for the Great Jubilee began when Pope John Paul II issued his Apostolic Letter &quot;Tertio Millennio Adveniente&quot; (&quot;As the Third Millennium Approaches&quot;) on 10 November 1994. In the letter, he invited the Church to begin a three-year period of intensive preparation for the celebration of the third Christian millennium. The first year, 1997 would be marked by an exploration of the person of Jesus, the second, 1998, by meditation on the person of the Holy Spirit, and the third, 1999, by meditation on the person of God the Father. Each year was also to be marked by a special prayer of entrustment to the Blessed Virgin Mary.

The formal convocation of the holy year came through the papal bull of indiction, &quot;Incarnationis Mysterium&quot; (&quot;Mystery of the Incarnation&quot;), on 29 November 1998. In the bull, the Pope indicated that he had desired to lead the Church into the Great Jubilee since the beginning of his pontificate. He explained that this Jubilee would be a chance to open new horizons in preaching the Kingdom of God. However, it would also be a time of repentance, both for individuals and for the Church as a whole. Furthermore, he stressed the ecumenical character of this event, which he saw as not only for Catholics, but for all Christians and indeed for the whole world.

The various churches and cathedrals in Rome took advantage of the Jubilee to perform long-needed renovations. The facade of St. Peter&#x27;s was under scaffolding for months, as centuries of grime were painstakingly removed. The Holy See also arranged to build a massive parking garage under the Janiculum hill, in order to accommodate all the buses that were expected. Construction of the garage was halted for some time due to the discovery of mosaics dating from the imperial period in previously unknown chambers under the hill. These were removed &quot;en masse&quot; so as to be able to complete the garage in time for the Jubilee.

==Jubilee Indulgence==
With the Bull of Indiction came a document from the Apostolic Penitentiary, indicating the conditions for receiving the Jubilee indulgence. In many respects, they were greatly simplified with respect to previous years. The normal conditions of confession, communion, prayer for the Pope and renunciation of attachment to sin remained in place, but unlike previous Jubilees, it was only necessary to visit a single church on a single day.

The indulgence could be obtained in Rome by visiting one of the four patriarchal basilicas, St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, St. John Lateran, St. Paul Outside the Walls or St. Mary Major, as well as by a visit to the shrine of Our Lady of Divine Love, the basilica of St. Lawrence Outside the Walls or the Christian catacombs of Rome. In the visit, the pilgrim had to take part in a religious celebration or spend a half-hour in Eucharistic adoration.

The indulgence could also be obtained in the Holy Land by a visit to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, or the Church of the Annunciation in Nazareth.

Further, the Jubilee was extended to all dioceses of the world. A visit to the cathedral church or another shrine designated by the bishop would also suffice to gain the Jubilee indulgence. Cloistered nuns and monks could obtain the indulgence in their house chapels.

Finally, the indulgence could be gained by means of a personal sacrifice or works of charity. Specifically mentioned in the document were sacrifices such as giving up smoking or alcohol for at least one day or making a donation to help the poor.

==Highpoints==
The particular Jubilees punctuated each week of the year 2000. There were special Vespers services held every day at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, often with participation by the Pope. Nearly every Sunday was dedicated to a special celebration of some sector of society. (See list at the end of this article.)

Some events of the Jubilee year were seen to be particularly significant, however.

===Opening===

The pope opened the Jubilee by opening the holy door of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica shortly before the Midnight Mass on 24 December 1999. Most of the time, the holy doors of the patriarchal Basilicas are cemented shut. On the occasion of a Jubilee year, the pope opens the doors as a symbol of opening the doors of grace. Pilgrims visiting the basilicas to gain the Jubilee indulgence enter the basilicas through these special doors. Throughout most of the Jubilee year, long lines were queued up to enter the door.

Pope John Paul II simplified the rite of opening considerably, compared to previous Jubilees. (See Holy door.) After a series of prayers and hymns, punctuated by African elephant tusks being blown, the Pope, clad in a purple cope, pushed on the doors as they were drawn open from inside by assistants. He then fell to his knees on the threshold of the Basilica and prayed, holding his silver Papal &quot;ferula&quot;. Pope John Paul II commissioned Patsy Ford Simms to compose the music for this celebration.

The holy door in St. John Lateran was opened by the pope the following day, and that of St. Mary Major on 1 January 2000.

===Ecumenical Celebration at St. Paul&#x27;s===
The fourth holy door, that of St. Paul Outside the Walls, was not opened until 18 January 2000, to launch the week of prayer for Christian Unity. For that celebration, the Pope had planned an ecumenical service, inviting leaders of all Christian religions to take part. Twenty-two Christian leaders accepted the invitation, along with a representative of the World Council of Churches, which represents 337 denominations. The opening of the door was carried out simultaneously by the Pope, Metropolitan Athanasias, representing the Ecumenical Patriarch, and George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury. All three fell to their knees on the threshold of the Basilica, joined in prayer. The liturgy of the day included readings from the Bible, from the Lutheran martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer and from the Russian theologian Georges Florovsky.

===Prayer for Forgiveness for Sins of the Church===
One particularly rich ceremony of the Jubilee, dubbed the &quot;Day of Forgiveness&quot;, came on 12 March 2000, the first Sunday of Lent. There the Pope begged forgiveness from God for the sins committed by members of the Church, and particularly sins committed in the name of the Church.

Seven senior curial officials read special prayers asking for forgiveness in specific areas. The first, Benin&#x27;s Cardinal Bernardin Gantin, then dean of the College of Cardinals, made a general confession of Christians&#x27; sins in the course of history. Joseph Ratzinger, cardinal prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, called for confession of faults for the use of &quot;non-evangelical methods&quot; in the service of faith, as for example, in the Inquisition. Roger Etchegaray, cardinal president of the Central Committee for the Jubilee, exhorted the confession of sins that caused division among Christians; Cardinal Edward Idris Cassidy, president of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, acknowledged the faults committed &quot;against the people of the Covenant,&quot; the Jews; and Japanese Archbishop Stephen Fumio Hamao, president of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People, mentioned sins committed against love, peace, the rights of peoples, respect of cultures and religions. Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze, president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, requested confession of sins that have wounded the dignity of woman and the unity of mankind. Finally, Vietnamese Archbishop François Xavier Nguyên Van Thuân, president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, encouraged confession of sins in the area of fundamental rights of the human person: abuses against children, marginalisation of the poor, suppression of the unborn in the maternal womb or their use for experimentation.

This &quot;mea culpa&quot; of the Church was widely applauded, but some members of the Catholic Church felt that it had gone too far, and had damaged the doctrine that the Church is holy. For his part, at the prayer of the Angelus later in the day, the Pope indicated that such a ceremony was necessary. &quot;The Holy Year is a time of purification: the Church is Holy because Christ is her Head and Spouse, the Spirit is her vivifying soul, and the Blessed Virgin and the saints are her most authentic expression. However, the children of the Church know the reality of sin, whose shadows are reflected in her, darkening her beauty. Because of this, the Church does not cease to implore God&#x27;s forgiveness for the sins of her members.&quot;

===Pilgrimage to the Holy Land===
Only a few days later, from 21 March to 26 March, the Pope realized a long-held dream by completing a personal pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He visited Jordan, Israel and lands held by the Palestinian National Authority. Two particular high points of that visit were his prayer at the Western Wall, where he placed a copy of the prayer for forgiveness for sins against the Jews into a crack in the wall, and his celebration of the Mass in the Cenacle in Jerusalem.

The Cenacle had been closed to Pope Paul VI when he visited Jerusalem in 1964, because the same site is venerated in Judaism as the burial site of King David. Pope John Paul II was permitted to celebrate in this most holy location of Christianity, where he preached on the words spoken by the faithful after the consecration: &quot;Christ has died, Christ has risen, Christ will come again&quot;. After the visit, the Israeli government arranged for the possession of the cenacle to be transferred to the Catholic Church in exchange for Santa María Blanca, a synagogue in Toledo, Spain that had been converted into a church.

===World Youth Day===

World Youth Day 2000 was an extremely well-attended event. An estimated two million youths took place in the closing Mass. The Roman subways were filled with singing youths from all over the world. The area around the Circus Maximus was converted into a large area for the hearing of confession. There were always long lines at these confessionals, and most priests in Rome spent several hours here. The event culminated with the Mass on 20 August 2000 in a large field belonging to the Roman university Tor Vergata.

===Closing===
The Great Jubilee was closed on 6 January 2001 with the Mass of Epiphany. On the previous night, the Basilica of St. Peter was scheduled to close at 6:00 p.m. but the church remained open until the last pilgrim had passed through the Holy Doors at about 2:20 a.m. on 6 January. After solemnly closing the Holy Door, the Pope celebrated Mass in front of the basilica for a congregation of some 10,000 persons. On this occasion, the Pope signed his Apostolic Letter &quot;Novo Millennio Ineunte&quot; (&quot;At the beginning of the new millennium&quot;) which outlines the priorities of the Church for the 21st century and beyond.

== The Jubilee beyond the Catholic Church ==
The proposal to celebrate the year 2000 was received very well among Christians. Early on, the Vatican had a disappointment because the Waldenses, the only large Protestant religion in Italy, refused to participate because of their dispute against the Jubilee indulgence. Nonetheless, many Christians celebrated this year in a special way.

There were also various special efforts to bring light on social issues in this year. Noting that the Biblical Jubilees involved the forgiveness of debts, the rock singer Bono, Quincy Jones, Willie Colón, Muhammad Ali, Bob Geldof among others supported Jubilee 2000 to increase awareness of the developing nations struggling under a possibly unpayable foreign debt. With the blessing of the Pope, they sought to bring governments and international banks to cancel such debts during the Jubilee year.

The Italian group, Hands Off Cain (&quot;Nessuno tocchi Caino&quot;), took advantage of the Jubilee to call for an end to capital punishment around the world. Whenever a country chose to commute a sentence or abolish the death penalty entirely, the group illuminated the Roman Colosseum for various numbers of days. The Pope also called for a moratorium on executions and, if possible, the abolishment of the practice. On 9 July 2000, he visited the Regina Coeli prison in Rome.

<text>Shlomo Argov (; 14 December 1929 – 23 February 2003) was an Israeli diplomat. He was the Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom, whose attempted assassination led to the 1982 Lebanon War.

==Early life and education==
Argov was born in Jerusalem in 1929 to the Salomon family that had lived in Jerusalem for ten generations. As a teenager, he joined the Palmach, the elite force of the Haganah. During the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, he was wounded in the Battle of Safed. When Israel was established and the 1948 Arab–Israeli War broke out, Argov joined the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

In 1950, he completed his military service and went to the United States to study, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree from the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in 1952. While studying, he worked part-time at the Israeli Embassy, where he met his future wife Hava. Afterwards, he went to study in the United Kingdom, and received an MA in international relations from the London School of Economics in 1955.

==Career==
Argov then returned to Israel, where he spent several years working in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office under David Ben-Gurion.

In 1959, Argov joined the Israeli Foreign Ministry, and was appointed consul-general in Lagos, Nigeria; following that country&#x27;s independence in 1960, he became ambassador. He was later transferred to the Israeli Embassy in Ghana, before joining the Israeli consulate in New York City in 1962. In 1965, he became Deputy-Director of the American Desk at the Foreign Ministry, and was posted at the Israeli Embassy in Washington in 1968. From 1971 to 1974, he served as ambassador to Mexico, and was appointed Deputy Director-General for Information of the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem when he returned. In 1977, he was appointed ambassador to the Netherlands, and served until 1979.

In September 1979, he was appointed ambassador to the United Kingdom by Prime Minister Menachem Begin. During his three years as ambassador, he &quot;forcefully and articulately put forward Israel&#x27;s cause to a generally hostile Foreign Office and media&quot;. He was highly admired by British Jews, and often visited Jewish communities.

==Personal life==
Argov had three children with his wife Hava: a son, Gideon, and two daughters, Yehudit and Edna. Hava died in May 2002.

==Attempted assassination==
On 3 June 1982, three men, Hussein Ghassan Said, Marwan al-Banna, and Nawaf al-Rosan approached Argov as he got into his car after a banquet at the Dorchester Hotel, in Park Lane, London. There is another report stating the presence of a fourth man. Armed with a PM-63 machine pistol, Hussein Ghassan Said shot Argov in the head. Argov was not killed, but he was critically injured. He was rushed to the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, where he was transferred to a specialist unit and underwent emergency brain surgery. He remained in a coma for three months.

The attempted assassins were members of the Abu Nidal Organization, a Palestinian splinter group which was hostile to the PLO. The attack was ordered by the Iraqi Intelligence Service. Following the attack, the assassins drove to the Iraqi embassy in London, where they deposited the weapon.

Al-Banna was Abu Nidal&#x27;s cousin, Said was a Jordanian, and Al-Rosan was an Iraqi intelligence colonel. The gunman, Said, was shot by Argov&#x27;s bodyguard and also sustained serious head injuries and, like Argov, survived. The two uninjured assassins fled the scene but were arrested shortly afterwards in a London flat. It appeared that they were planning to kill Nabil Ramlawi, the PLO representative in London.

The attackers were convicted, and sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from 30 to 35 years. Subsequently two became mentally ill, and were transferred to high security hospitals in the UK. There was some speculation in Israel at the time that the British security services were aware of the plot. Lord Alton of Liverpool failed to draw the government into commenting on the speculation when he raised the issue in the House of Lords.

The attempt on Argov&#x27;s life triggered the Israeli decision to invade Lebanon two days later to rout Palestinian guerrilla bases. This was intended by the Iraqi authorities, who calculated that an Israeli war in Lebanon would be detrimental to the rival Ba&#x27;athist government in Syria—whether Syria intervened on behalf of the Palestinians or not. Israel invaded Lebanon on 6 June. The war saw the expulsion of the Palestine Liberation Organization from Lebanon, although the would-be assassins were not members of the PLO, and their leader, Abu Nidal, had even been sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; by a PLO court.

==Later life==
After being in a coma for three months, Argov regained consciousness, and was returned to Israel. There, he was placed in the rehabilitation ward at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem as a permanent patient. Though he could not move, he remained lucid, and had newspaper headlines read to him for fifteen minutes at a time. He became devastated when he realised the full extent of his condition. After about three years, he was never fully conscious, and he eventually went blind.

Argov was deeply distressed that the attack on him had provoked the 1982 Lebanon War. In 1983, he dictated to a friend the following statement from his bed in Hadassah Hospital. The statement was later passed on to the &quot;Haaretz&quot; newspaper: &quot;If those who planned the war had also foreseen the scope of the adventure, they would have spared the lives of hundreds of our best sons ... They brought no salvation ... Israel should go to war only when there is no alternative. Our soldiers should never go to war unless it is vital for survival. We are tired of wars. The nation wants peace.&quot;

==Death==
Argov died at Hadassah Hospital in 2003, aged 73, from the injuries inflicted in the attack. He had been paralysed and in permanent hospital care for 21 years.

<text>Ted Arnbjörn Gärdestad (; 18 February 195622 June 1997) was a Swedish singer, songwriter, musician and actor known internationally as Ted. Gärdestad began his acting career in 1966 and began playing music in 1971, signing with Polar Music. Assigned with in-house producers Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, Gärdestad released his first single, &quot;Hela världen runt,&quot; in late 1971 and worked closely with the four members of ABBA to create his debut album &quot;Undringar&quot; (1972). As Polar Music&#x27;s best-selling solo artist (aside from ABBA), he continued to work with the group members throughout the 1970s, releasing three more albums &quot;Ted&quot; (1973), &quot;Upptåg&quot; (1974) and &quot;Franska Kort&quot; (1976), which were moderately successful. In 1978, Gärdestad released his first English-language album, Blue Virgin Isles, which did not have success internationally, as his predecessor albums had in his home country.

In 1979, Ted and his brother Kenneth Gärdestad played at Melodifestivalen, the competition to select Sweden&#x27;s entry for the Eurovision Song Contest, with the song &quot;Satellit.&quot; They won the competition which allowed them to represent Sweden at Eurovision held in Jerusalem. Gärdestad attempted once more to enter a song at Melodifestivalen but was unsuccessful. He left the music industry shortly thereafter, to try acting. By the 1990s, he played with other musicians such as Harpo. Gärdestad toured extensively starting in 1994 until he died by suicide in 1997. A biographical film about Gärdestad was released in 2018, called &quot;.&quot;

== Early life ==

Ted Arnbjörn Gärdestad was born to Arne (1923–2016) and Margit Gärdestad (née Sjöholm; 1921–2008) on 18 February 1956 in Sollentuna, Stockholm County. He was the youngest of three siblings and had two older brothers; Kjell (1944–2000) and Kenneth (1948–2018). The family lived in Sollentuna during Ted&#x27;s childhood.

== Career ==

=== 1962–1974 ===
Ted Gärdestad began his career as a musician in 1962, playing accordion on Swedish television at the age of six years. His debuted as an actor in 1966 when he landed a part in the television advent calendar series &quot;En småstad vid seklets början&quot; (&quot;A Small Town at the Turn of the Century&quot;). In 1970, Gärdestad had a minor role in the American film &quot;Story of a Woman&quot; alongside Bibi Andersson, Robert Stack and James Farentino. Gärdestad was also a promising tennis player. At 14 he ranked second in his age group in Sweden after Björn Borg, and once considered a career as a professional tennis player but instead chose a career in music. In 1971, 15-year-old Ted and his eight-year-older brother Kenneth Gärdestad contacted the record company Polar Music and showed an audition tape to Stig &quot;Stikkan&quot; Anderson, who would later manage the pop group ABBA. Ted was composer and singer, while Kenneth wrote lyrics to Ted&#x27;s melodies, a collaboration that continued throughout Ted&#x27;s career. Anderson subsequently signed Ted to the label and assigned him to in-house producers Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus.

==== Debut single ====

In late 1971, Gärdestad released his first single, the gospel-influenced &quot;Hela världen runt&quot; (&quot;All Over the World&quot;). The follow-up single, an acoustic ballad &quot;Jag vill ha en egen måne&quot; (&quot;I Want a Moon of My Own&quot;), a song he wrote at age 12, brought him to the attention of the Swedish public. He quickly became the country&#x27;s first teen idol, and toured on the folkpark circuit. Andersson and Ulvaeus produced Ted&#x27;s debut album &quot;Undringar&quot; (&quot;Wonderings&quot;), which was released on Polar Music in early 1972 and spent 10 weeks at the top of the Kvällstoppen combined singles and albums chart. Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad providing backing vocals on the album, and all four members of ABBA continued to work with Gärdestad during the 1970s. His albums &quot;Undringar&quot; (1972), &quot;Ted&quot; (1973), &quot;Upptåg&quot; (1974) and &quot;Franska Kort&quot; (1976) were produced with the same recording and production techniques, engineers (including Michael B. Tretow) and musicians, as contemporaneous ABBA recordings.

In February 1973, Gärdestad entered Melodifestivalen 1973, the competition to select Sweden&#x27;s entry for the Eurovision Song Contest. The song &quot;Oh, vilken härlig dag&quot; (&quot;Oh What a Lovely Day&quot;) came joint fourth. A quartet known as Björn &amp; Benny, Agnetha &amp; Anni-Frid finished third with a song called &quot;Ring Ring (Bara du slog en signal).&quot; Gärdestad had another attempt in Melodifestivalen 1975 with the song &quot;Rockin&#x27; &#x27;n&#x27; Reelin&#x27;&quot;; Svenne and Lotta placed third with &quot;Bang-A-Boomerang&quot; and Gärdestad finished seventh but the song became a hit single on radio charts &quot;Svensktoppen&quot;, &quot;Heta Högen&quot; and &quot;Kvällstoppen&quot;. Gärdestad and his brother Kenneth returned to Melodifestivalen in 1977 and performed the song &quot;Det bästa som finns&quot; (&quot;The Best of All&quot;) with Polar Music labelmate Lena Andersson. They finished eighth out of ten entries, and Gärdestad did not record the track.

=== 1975–1979 ===
By 1975, Ted had become a noted star in Sweden. He was prominently featured in teen magazines &quot;Starlet&quot;, &quot;Mitt Livs Novell&quot; and &quot;Poster&quot;, his love life was covered by the national newspapers, he had a fan club, and all of his albums were certificated gold and sold well in the rest of Scandinavia. Aside from Bjorn, Benny, Agnetha &amp; Anni-Frid/ABBA and Anni-Frid Lyngstad he was Polar Music&#x27;s best-selling artist. Stikkan had plans to launch him internationally and Ted recorded both Swedish and English versions of &quot;Rockin&#x27; &#x27;n&#x27; Reelin&#x27;&quot; as well as an English version of an earlier hit, &quot;Jag ska fånga en ängel&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m Going to Catch An Angel&quot;), with the title &quot;Gonna Make You My Angel,&quot; the latter with lyrics by Gary Osborne; neither were a significant hit. Australian pop singer Mark Holden did, however, have a major success in Australia with &quot;Jag ska fånga en ängel&quot; under the title &quot;I Wanna Make You My Lady&quot; in 1976.

By 1977, Gärdestad was faced with a dilemma common to many child stars and teen idols; as he grew up so did his audiences. The time of teen mania and screaming crowds in the folkparks was declining and Polar in-house producers Björn and Benny, who had played an important part in his early success were now busy writing, producing and promoting ABBA and could no longer give Gärdestad or other Polar artists their full attention. 1975 resulted in the release of one single, the Melodifestivalen entry &quot;Rockin&#x27; &#x27;n&#x27; Reelin&#x27;.&quot; In 1976, the label released the album &quot;Franska Kort&quot; (&quot;French Cards&quot; – an expression for a fairly innocent type of late 19th-century pornography), only partly recorded with Björn and Benny and co-produced by Tretow and Janne Schaffer. The album produced hit singles &quot;Angela,&quot; &quot;Chapeau-Claque&quot; (French for top hat), &quot;När showen är slut&quot; (&quot;When the Show is Over&quot;) and &quot;Klöversnoa,&quot; a novelty folk dance parody with Benny and Gärdestad playing accordion. The album peaked at No. 3, making it his first album not to top the Swedish charts, and it left the chart after 22 weeks, a moderate success compared to his previous releases. In 1977, ABBA and most of the Polar Music crew including musicians and sound engineers went on their first world tour, making &quot;&quot; &quot;and&quot; recording &quot;&quot; – as an indirect result, Gärdestad did not release an album that year.

=== International career ===
Stig Anderson still thought Gärdestad had some international potential, and he and his brother Kenneth travelled to Hollywood in late 1977 to record Gärdestad&#x27;s first English-language album &quot;Blue Virgin Isles&quot;. The west coast rock orientated album featured contributions from American and English musicians including Jeff Porcaro, Steve Porcaro, Jim Keltner, David Hungate, Jay Graydon, Dr. John and John Mayall, many of whom were Gärdestad&#x27;s personal idols. &quot;Blue Virgin Isles&quot; was released worldwide in late 1978 on Epic Records, and produced the singles &quot;Take Me Back To Hollywood,&quot; an English version of &quot;Chapeau-Clacque,&quot; and &quot;Love, You&#x27;re Making All The Fools&quot;. Despite the expensive production and the big push to launch Gärdestad—including promotional appearances alongside ABBA—his Swedish success did not translate internationally. In Sweden, the album peaked at No. 29 and spent one week on the chart. Thirty years after its original release, &quot;Blue Virgin Isles&quot; remains Gärdestad &#x27;s only studio album that has not been re-released on CD by Polar Music/PolyGram/Universal Music Group.

=== 1980s ===
In early 1979, Ted and Kenneth Gärdestad had a fourth attempt at Melodifestivalen and won with the song &quot;Satellit,&quot; a mid-tempo rock track whose arrangement bore resemblances to Toto&#x27;s 1978 hit &quot;Hold the Line&quot;. The similarities caused speculation of plagiarism in the Swedish media and disqualification from the contest. The connection between the two songs was that the song&#x27;s producer Janne Schaffer had heard four of the future Toto members, Steve Porcaro, Jeff Porcaro, David Hungate and Steve Lukather, experimenting with a guitar and bass riff during the &quot;Blue Virgin Isles&quot; sessions in Los Angeles, which eventually evolved into &quot;Hold the Line.&quot; Schaffer was inspired by what he had heard when he wrote the arrangement for &quot;Satellit,&quot; but at that point neither &quot;Hold the Line&quot; nor Toto&#x27;s debut eponymous album had been released. Jeff Porcaro told Swedish newspaper &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; in February 1979: &quot;No, it&#x27;s not a rip-off, Ted did not steal our song. Those piano triplets and that bass and guitar line go back to the 1950s and the fact that we both have happened to use variations on the same theme in our songs right now is purely coincidental.&quot; Consequently, Ted represented Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest held in Jerusalem in March 1979. After having competed four times in the pre-selection before winning and with his personal connection to ABBA, hopes and expectations were high. The song scored eight points and finished seventeenth out of nineteen participating entries, making it Sweden&#x27;s then-second-lowest placing in the contest. The Swedish-language single became a Top 10 hit back home in Sweden and &quot;Satellit&quot; is regarded as one of Ted&#x27;s signature tunes. The English-language version of the track never charted and neither did the re-issue of &quot;Blue Virgin Isles&quot;, which included both versions, making it clear that Ted&#x27;s Scandinavian audiences favoured his Swedish-language material.

After an unsuccessful return to Melodifestivalen in 1980, with &quot;Låt solen värma dig&quot; (&quot;Let the Sun Warm You&quot;) with then girlfriend Annica Boller and disappointing sales of his 1981 album &quot;Stormvarning&quot; (#31, 2 weeks)—which was internationally released as &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Write a Symphony&quot; on the Polydor label in a few countries and equally overlooked—Gärdestad left the music scene at the age of 25.

=== Later work ===
Having left the music business, Gärdestad made a brief and unsuccessful attempt at acting and shortly thereafter began exploring meditation and Eastern religions. He became involved with the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (also known as Osho) movement and publicly renounced his earlier life. In an interview with Swedish newspaper &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; in mid-1983, he said he no longer wanted to be addressed as &quot;Ted Gärdestad,&quot; his name was now Swami Sangit Upasani. Like all Bhagwan disciples, he wore clothes in a specific shade of orange. Gärdestad distanced himself from his friends in the music business and his family as his involvement in the movement gradually took over his life, affecting his personality. In June 1983, one month before his second child with actress Ann Zacharias was born, he unexpectedly left his family and friends and moved to the movement&#x27;s headquarters in Oregon, United States. Three years later, after Rajneesh was convicted for immigration fraud, tax evasion, embezzlement of his disciples&#x27; funds and bioterror attacks on the citizens of The Dalles and subsequently deported from the US, Gärdestad&#x27;s family persuaded him to move back to Sweden. His severe mental health problems became increasingly apparent.

==== Palme assassination rumours ====
Shortly after Gärdestad&#x27;s return to Sweden in 1986, the Prime Minister of Sweden, Olof Palme, was murdered. Gärdestad was wrongly mentioned in the Swedish media as &quot;the 33-year-old,&quot; a suspect in the investigation of the assassination, which severely affected him although Gärdestad was on vacation in Greece at the time of the murder, and although he was never questioned by the Swedish police nor was under suspicion by the authorities, the speculations and rumours followed him and his family for the rest of the 1980s. A few years later, he was again the subject of rumours accusing him of being Lasermannen, a bank robber and serial killer. The rumours affected the sensitive and already unstable former star, and Gärdestad withdrew and fell into a deep depression.

=== 1990s ===
In the early 1990s, Gärdestad was briefly coaxed out of retirement by his friend and fellow Swedish pop singer Harpo. He joined Harpo on a concert tour and made guest appearances. In 1992, they released the duet &quot;Lycka&quot; (&quot;Happiness&quot;) as a single; it garnered little attention but marked Gärdestad&#x27;s return to music. Early that year he embarked on his first tour since 1978 and played a series of dates with Plura Jonsson, Tove Naess, Totta Näslund and Dan Hylander, and received overall positive reviews from the press.

In 1993, a compilation album titled &quot;Kalendarium 1972–93&quot; was promoted by a tour in the Swedish &quot;folkparks&quot;; the album and tour were successful, as was his first composition in twelve years, &quot;För kärlekens skull&quot; (&quot;For Love&#x27;s Sake&quot;), which topped the &quot;Svensktoppen&quot; chart. The &quot;Kalendarium&quot; collection included a Swedish-language re-recording of the title track from &quot;Blue Virgin Isles&quot;, &quot;Himlen är oskyldigt blå&quot; (&quot;The Sky is Innocently Blue&quot;), which fifteen years after its original release became another &quot;Svensktoppen&quot; hit, and became one of his best-known songs. In early 1994, &quot;Kalendarium 1972–93&quot; was awarded a platinum disc. All of Gärdestad&#x27;s albums from the 1970s and early 1980s, with the exception of &quot;Blue Virgin Isles&quot;, were re-released on CD by Polar, and a generation of Swedes who grew up listening to his music now re-discovered and re-evaluated his back catalogue as adults. His body of work has since come to be regarded as a national treasure as important as those of Evert Taube, Carl Michael Bellman and Cornelis Vreeswijk both by fans and Swedish music critics.

=== Last years and death ===
The following year, Gärdestad released a full-length album of new material titled &quot;Äntligen på väg&quot; (&quot;Finally on the Road&quot;) on Polar, which was produced by the longtime friend Janne Schaffer. The album included contributions from ABBA drummer Per Lindvall, Björn J:son Lindh, Gladys del Pilar and Marie Bergman, and other renowned Swedish musicians. It spawned a series of singles including &quot;Ge en sol&quot; (&quot;Give a Sun&quot;), &quot;Om du ville ha mig&quot; (&quot;If You Wanted Me&quot;), &quot;I min radio&quot; (&quot;On My Radio&quot;) and &quot;Hon är kvinnan&quot; (&quot;She&#x27;s the Woman&quot;), all of which entered the Svensktoppen chart. The lyrics were light, harmonious and hopeful, and Gärdestad&#x27;s future seemed more positive; his name was finally cleared, he remarried and he was back to making music. He made several television appearances promoting &quot;Äntligen på väg&quot; album and performed an acoustic concert on ZTV. He toured extensively all through 1994, 1995 and 1996. On 22 June 1997, at the age of 41, Gärdestad died after jumping in front of a train.
The only colleagues from his musical career to attend his funeral were Schaffer, J:son Lindh, Tretow, Barbro &#x27;Lill-Babs&#x27; Svensson and Agnetha Fältskog.

== Health problems ==
After Gärdestad&#x27;s death, his brother Kenneth spoke to the press and in a book about Gärdestad&#x27;s mental health problems during the last decade of his life. In the biography &quot;Jag vill ha en egen måne&quot;, published eight years after his brother&#x27;s death, Kenneth said Gärdestad had had anxiety since his late teens, and that Kenneth had become convinced that as an adult Gärdestad had paranoid schizophrenia, which he thought had been aggravated by his time with the Bhagwan movement, the press coverage and the subsequent public persecution following the murder of Olof Palme and the Lasermannen case. In the 2005 biography on Gärdestad, Schaffer said he attended a dinner party in the late 1990s with a large number of Swedish dignitaries, including leading politicians, statesmen, representatives of the diplomatic corps, and the chief editor of Sweden&#x27;s largest daily newspaper &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot;, who said in front of all the prominent guests: &quot;You know that it&#x27;s your pal Ted Gärdestad who murdered Olof Palme, don&#x27;t you?&quot; Schaffer immediately left the dinner party. In the biography, Kenneth Gärdestad also said Ted&#x27;s condition was never properly diagnosed during his lifetime and he did not receive the medical or psychotherapeutic treatment that could have saved his life.

== Musicianship ==

=== Songwriting ===
Musically Ted&#x27;s songs combined the heritage of the Scandinavian acoustic and narrative &quot;visa&quot; tradition with influences from the British-American singer-songwriter wave of the late 1960s and early 1970s, but his repertoire also included a wide variety of genre exercises including pastiches of swing, jazz, ragtime, boogie-woogie, reggae, country and western, French chanson, Swedish folk music as well as contemporary English and American pop, rock, soul and R&amp;B. Following musicians and songwriters of their generation, both brothers were fans of the Beatles and influenced by the fact that John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote their own material and played it themselves, which was revolutionary at that time. The early Swedish albums with Ted all also contain one or two English-language tracks, usually slightly rougher and rockier than the rest of the material and many of them featuring Schaffer on electric guitars.

Lyrically the songs reflected the world of an average young teenager, no longer a child but not yet an adult, and his personal development; the dreams, hopes and desires as well as the fears and frustrations, infatuation and rejection (&quot;När du kommer,&quot; &quot;Räcker jag till&quot;), existential ponderings (&quot;Universum,&quot; &quot;Snurra du min värld,&quot; &quot;Gitarren och jag&quot;) alongside typical adolescent fantasies and daydreams of historical figures such as the Vikings (&quot;Viking&quot;), &quot;Buffalo Bill,&quot; Goliath (&quot;Goliat från Gat&quot;) or becoming a superhero like &quot;The Phantom&quot; (&quot;Fantomen&quot;), and naturally, as with most teenagers, also playful hints at an increased interest in the opposite sex. His Melodifestivalen entry &quot;Oh vilken härlig dag&quot; for instance includes phrases such as &quot;I snuck down to the lake, to spy on you when you went skinny dipping&quot; and &quot;I ran naked in the blazing sun&quot;, and &quot;And I could see what you&#x27;re hiding under your skirt&quot;; a line that was considered risqué when sung by a seventeen-year-old boy in the pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest in 1973. Despite the fact that all lyrics were the work of Ted&#x27;s eight-year-older brother Kenneth and not Ted himself, they were specifically written to reflect Ted&#x27;s personality and his world, and the feelings of a teenager, not those of his older brother.

Similar to Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus during the ABBA era, Ted wrote faux-English demo lyrics when he composed his songs and it was subsequently Kenneth&#x27;s task to write proper Swedish lyrics while staying true to Ted&#x27;s original idea for a particular song. Kenneth spent a considerable amount of time getting the words exactly as Ted wanted them, with the right number of syllables to the bar, rhymes and alliterations emphasizing the rhythm of the music and choosing words suitable for a boy in his teens, occasionally including slang expressions. Like sound engineer Michael B. Tretow, Ted was also known for his prankish sense of humour; he was a big fan of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; and loved practical jokes, which also is reflected in the lyrics in the form of puns, word play, and double entendres. Kenneth&#x27;s skills as a lyricist paradoxically resulted in the fact that some of Ted&#x27;s audiences, in the 1970s and even to the present day, were under the impression that he wrote both the music and all lyrics, which Kenneth has since revealed that he only took as recognition that he had done Ted&#x27;s music justice and it was the best compliment that he could get.

== Legacy ==

A scholarship was set up in Gärdestad&#x27;s name in 1997 to promote unsigned singer-songwriters and is awarded annually along with a tribute concert.

In 2005, a musical based around Gärdestad&#x27;s songs called &quot;Sol, vind och vatten&quot; opened in Stockholm. Also in 2005, Gärdestad&#x27;s brother Kenneth wrote a biography about Ted&#x27;s life called &quot;Jag vill ha en egen måne&quot;, named after his breakthrough single. It includes extensive interviews with Gärdestad&#x27;s family and close friends, including tennis player Björn Borg, actor Per Ragnar, guitarist Staffan Astner, pianist Robert Wells, sound engineer Lennart Östlund, photographer Barry B. Levine, hockey player Mats Ulander, and his former girlfriend actress Ann Zacharias.

In 2006, British bassist Andy Bell, noted founding member of Ride and former Oasis member, at the time living in Sweden and a great admirer of Ted&#x27;s work, took part in the annual tribute concert held in Stockholm.

On 16 October 2006, Kenneth received a special award from SKAP, The Swedish Society of Popular Music Composers, for his &quot;outstanding contributions to Swedish performing arts as a lyricist,&quot; in memory of his brother Ted.

=== In popular culture ===
On 11 September 2012, Sweden&#x27;s central bank, the Riksbank, announced a new series of coins to replace the 1 and 5 kronor coins which came into circulation in October 2016. The design of the coins follow the theme of Gärdestad&#x27;s song, &quot;Sol, vind och vatten&quot; (English: &quot;Sun, wind and water&quot;), with the designs depicting the elements on the reverse side of the coins. This included the reintroduction of the 2 kronor coin. The coins also have a new portrait of King Carl XVI Gustaf.

On 3 January 2018, the feature film Ted – För kärlekens skull, a biopic about Gärdestad, premiered. Covering parts of his life from the breakthrough in the 1970s to his comeback in the 1990s, the film stars actor Adam Pålsson (a former singer who sings all the song parts himself) in the role as Ted, and was directed by Academy Award nominee Hannes Holm.

=== Re-releases, compilations and covers ===
Fifteen years after his death, Gärdestad&#x27;s music became increasingly popular in Sweden. Many of his songs were included on compilations and were covered by other artists and are now considered modern Swedish pop classics. His original studio albums and compilations still sold well; 2001s &quot;Droppar av solregn&quot; reached No. 2 and spent 47 weeks on the Swedish albums chart, and the 2004 2-CD set &quot;Sol vind och vatten – Det bästa&quot; peaked at No. 3 and charted for 60 consecutive weeks.

In 2000, &quot;Jag vill ha en egen måne,&quot; &quot;Så mycket bättre&quot; and &quot;Come Give Me Love&quot; were featured in Swedish film director Lukas Moodysson&#x27;s comedy drama &quot;Tillsammans&quot; (international title: &quot;Together&quot;). In 2001, Tretow and Kenneth Gärdestad took part in the production of a 4-CD box set titled &quot;Solregn&quot; (&quot;Sunshowers&quot;), a compilation of 71 tracks that includes two previously unreleased recordings.

In 2004, a line-up of Swedish artists headed by Schaffer and including Mats Ronander, J:son Lindh, Jennifer Brown and rapper Dogge Doggelito performed a ten-minute medley of Gärdestad&#x27;s best-known songs as the interval act of that year&#x27;s Melodifestivalen, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Ted winning the contest with &quot;Satellit.&quot; Also in 2004, an album of covers of some of Gärdestad&#x27;s songs called &quot;Fånga En Ängel – En hyllning till Ted Gärdestad&quot; (&quot;Catch An Angel – A tribute to Ted Gärdestad&quot;) was released, featuring contemporary Swedish artists including Håkan Hellström, Helen Sjöholm, Patrik Isaksson, Fredrik Kempe, Fame, Lisa Miskovsky, and Josefin Nilsson of Ainbusk. The album was released on the Anderson Records label run by Stig Anderson&#x27;s daughter Marie Ledin. Country singer and fellow Eurovision contestant Jill Johnson&#x27;s acoustic version of Gärdestad&#x27;s 1973 Melodifestivalen entry &quot;Oh vilken härlig dag&quot; and Helen Sjöholm&#x27;s recording of &quot;Come Give Me Love&quot; became radio hits and were also issued as singles.

In June 2009, Universal Music Group, the company that owns the rights to the Polar Music back catalogue, released an 8-CD, 91-track box set titled &quot;Helt Nära Dig – Samlade Album&quot; (&quot;Quite Close to You – Collected Albums&quot;). The set includes all six of Gärdestad&#x27;s Swedish-language albums and &quot;Blue Virgin Isles&quot;, and features selected tracks from his second English-language album &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Write a Symphony&quot; and some non-album singles. The box set reached No. 34 on the Swedish albums chart in July 2009 and re-entered the chart a year later in July 2010, reaching No. 12.

In 2010, the track &quot;Så mycket bättre&quot; from Gärdestad&#x27;s debut album &quot;Undringar&quot; was covered by the Swedish stars Lasse Berghagen, Thomas Di Leva, Plura Jonsson of Eldkvarn, Barbro &quot;Lill-Babs&quot; Svensson, Petter, Christer Sandelin and Petra Marklund, and was used as the theme tune to a television reality show of the same name. This resulted in renewed interest in Gärdestad&#x27;s back catalogue and his original recording of the song entering the digital singles chart in Sweden in October 2010 – almost four decades after its first release.

=== Caramba ===
In 1981, Gärdestad and ABBA&#x27;s sound engineer Michael B. Tretow had a surprise hit single with the novelty track &quot;Hubba Hubba Zoot Zoot&quot; in Sweden, released under the anonymous group moniker Caramba on the record label Trash Records (#1 June 1981, 26 weeks on the singles chart). The liner notes to Tretow&#x27;s 1999 CD compilation &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; carry the following dedication: &quot;This album is dedicated to Ted Gärdestad, who should be here now, rolling on the floor in paroxysms of laughter as usual.&quot;

<text>Bye Bye is a Quebecois sketch comedy special, broadcast annually by Ici Radio-Canada Télé on New Year&#x27;s Eve. The yearly program features sketches satirizing the past year&#x27;s events, followed by a countdown to the next year itself. Originally beginning in 1968, &quot;Bye Bye &#x27;98&quot; was the final edition of its first run, until the show was revived by the comedy troupe Rock et Belles Oreilles, who produced the 2006 and 2007 editions of the show.

In 2008, it was announced that Véronique Cloutier and Louis Morissette would take over the program for its 2008 edition. However, this edition provoked controversy over certain sketches that viewers found to be derogatory and racist; such as a sketch about the assassination of then-American president-elect Barack Obama, and a sketch making fun of anglophones. The network received 1,300 complaints from viewers about the content in the special, which led to Cloutier making a public apology stating that the sketches were supposed to criticize racism rather than promote it.

As a result of the controversy, a 2009 edition was not produced, but despite the controversy surrounding their edition, Cloutier and Morissette announced that they would return to produce a 2010 edition of &quot;Bye Bye&quot;.

In 2018, the special began to achieve record viewership, with that year&#x27;s edition overtaking an episode of &quot;La Petite Vie&quot; as the highest-rated Quebecois television program of all-time—with 4.471 million viewers. In 2020, due to restrictions on gatherings due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Quebec, &quot;Bye Bye 2020&quot; (which featured several sketches lampooning the provincial and federal government&#x27;s responses) achieved a record 3.8 million live viewers—a 93% market share. The 2021 special—which included a cameo appearance by recently fired Montreal Canadiens manager Marc Bergevin in a parody of Uber Eats&#x27; commercials—once again broke records due to strict COVID-19 restrictions. With 4.862 million viewers, it was reported to be the highest-rated Quebecois television program of all-time (and in turn, among the top television broadcasts nationwide of 2021). The only other program among the top five is the aforementioned &quot;La Petite Vie&quot;.

<text>The Metabarons () or The Saga of the Meta-Barons is a science fiction comics series relating the history of a dynasty of perfect warriors known as the Metabarons. &quot;The Metabarons&quot; series was written by creator Alejandro Jodorowsky and illustrated by Argentine artist Juan Giménez. The series, published by Humanoïdes Associés, is complete, the last volume having been released at the end of 2003.

The first appearance of a Metabaron (chronologically the last of the Metabarons) was May 1981 in the &quot;Incal&quot; comic book series. This was followed by a series of prequels that concerned this character&#x27;s origin, presented as the narration of the android Tonto to the android Lothar, of his masters&#x27; achievements. The series takes place over the course of several generations, and chronicles the life of each of the five Metabarons. The stories depict a space opera reminiscent of Greek tragedy, and heavily influenced by Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; novels. Jodorowsky had been in the early stages of making a &quot;Dune&quot; film in 1973.

==Mythology==
===Rites===
Every Metabaron is mutilated by his father in his youth so that his endurance to pain is tested, and receives a powerful mechanical body part as a replacement for the destroyed limb. In each generation, the son and heir must eventually face his father in a battle to the death. These battles have taken many forms, from hand-to-hand combat to space duels, and the succession is only achieved once the son succeeds in killing his father.

===Bushitaka===
The Bushitaka is the strict code of honor followed by the Metabarons, named after the Japanese bushido. It demands that the practitioners dedicate themselves to victory in all things at any cost, wherein the only alternative to victory is death, and even forsake their own family members in the pursuit of total victory.

===Metabaronic weaponry===
Each Metabaron draws upon an array of advanced weaponry. These include cybernetically implanted lasers, nanotech nuclear warheads implanted in the body, swords which can disintegrate in bursts of flame, and advanced spaceships. Many of the Metabarons also exhibit powerful psychic abilities.

==The dynasty==

===Castaka===
On the occasion of his son-in-law Othon&#x27;s succession to the title of Metabaron (intended to be resolved by mortal combat but forestalled by his use of guile to seal victory), Baron Berard of Castaka tells of his caste&#x27;s lineage leading up to the present. On the remote planet Ahour-The-Dwarf, a long-forgotten schism had drawn its inhabitants into an interminable civil war between two castes—the Amakuras and the Castakas—who adhere to respective versions of a once-shared warrior code, known by the Amakuras as Bushikara and by the Castakas as Bushitaka. One day, the Castakas&#x27; queen Oriela was abducted by the Amakura king Divadal, taunting her king Omezo by publicly raping her and taking her hostage. Omezo, employing guile over the established codes of combat, overwhelmed the Amakuras, but not before Divadal released a bioweapon that rendered every man on the planet sterile.

Oriela, having been shielded from the weapon, gave birth to Divadal&#x27;s son, Dayal—the last fertile male on the planet, spared in contravention of the bushitaka due to necessity—then committed ritual suicide eight days later, leaving him only a bite on his shoulder as a memento. Once of age, Dayal became a breeding-stud to all the Castaka women, but once his offspring came of age themselves, Omezo gave up concealing his disgust at his half-Amakura &quot;stepson&quot; and banished him. His mentor General Pakko matched him with his daughter Antigrea, whom he had conceived just before the assault on the Amakuras, and despite initial antipathy they fell in love. Antigrea bore Dayal twin daughters, Myrtha and Narda, but Dayal&#x27;s disappointment at lacking a male heir drove him to withdraw to the wilderness, hunting wild game, while Antigrea and Pakko raised the twins in the martial arts.

Some years later, the Technopriests elected to build their new space station in Ahour&#x27;s system. While they saw the planet as no inherent threat, their concern that an enemy might use it as a bridgehead led them to lobby the ageing Omezo to install planetary defences on-world. When he declined, they infected him with a virus in hopes his heir (Dayal) might be more accommodating. The dying Omezo abhorred having Dayal succeed him and ordered the murder of him and his family, but Pakko bought time for them to reunite at Dayal&#x27;s remote bunker. The Technos, witnessing the failure of their machinations, destroyed the whole planet, leaving the bunker adrift as an asteroid. There, Dayal finally acknowledged his warrior daughters and completed their training.

The family hijacked a Techno convoy and leveraged its booty and their lethal martial skills to claim leadership of the pirate asteroid of Thor-Thougah, from which they wage a bloody and profitable offensive against the Technos. Eventually, the Technos catch the pirates in an ambush and Antigrea is mortally wounded. Seeking a burial site, they land on the planet Marmola, but find its marble composition impossible to dig. They are ambushed by bandits who seek the planet&#x27;s hidden treasure, a secret guarded by the giant eagle-like Gangez, and use Antigrea&#x27;s remains as bait to capture him. Loosing their bonds they overwhelm the bandits, and pledge themselves to the now-dying Gangez who by eating her has become Antigrea&#x27;s sepulchre. Gangez leads them to the planet&#x27;s only fertile valley, where they bury him, and his spirit leads them to the planet&#x27;s treasure: a subterranean reservoir of epiphyte, a substance that defies gravity. Summoning the Techno robots he cast into space on their first raid, Dayal develops the valley into a city for his caste.

Dayal takes ship back to Thor-Thougah with his daughters, seeking sires for them. En route, it emerges that Narda&#x27;s brain and Myrtha&#x27;s ovaries have sustained tumours that will rapidly kill them both. With their consent, Dayal has the robots graft Narda&#x27;s lower body to Myrtha&#x27;s upper body. Upon arrival in Thor-Thougah, the resulting being confronts the sole survivor of the Technos&#x27; assault on the asteroid. He agrees to impregnate her followed by a fight to the death, but when bested he takes his own life, asking to be remembered by his unborn progeny.

Berard concludes his tale by revealing that he is the child of that union, and he welcomed Othon (a fugitive pirate) seeing in him a trace of his own father. Othon is now ready to receive the mark of the Metabarons (the absorbed spirit of Gangez, worn as a mark on the chest) from his father-in-law.

===Main saga===
The main saga of the Metabarons begins on Marmola, on which Berard&#x27;s tribe export huge blocks of marble. The existence of the epiphyte has been kept secret by the Castakas for many generations, until its revelation to save the life of Othon von Salza, the son-in-law of Baron Berard. Soon after the revelation of the epiphyte, the planet&#x27;s orbit becomes a battlefield, with the treacherous Imperial Black Endoguard as the victors. At the end of the war, Othon and his son Bari are the only survivors of the Castaka tribe. The Imperial couple, rulers of the known galaxy, are astonished by the achievement of Othon and reward him; and Othon shows them where the epiphyte was hidden in exchange for a percentage of the new market for anti-G Technology, a new planet to which their palace would be transferred, and a gift for his son intended to restore the joy lost with his crippled legs. The emperor gives him a horse, an extinct species revived by genetic manipulation, but pirates steal the horse. Othon kills them in retaliation, but accidentally kills his son, and is castrated by an attacker. Othon thereafter invests a large part of his fortune in the development of the first &#x27;metabaronic&#x27; weapons and begins the tradition of cybernetic implants and later becomes a mercenary of extraordinary skill and power. By the destruction of 100,000 pirate vessels, he and his descendants receive the title of Metabaron, and the Imperial couple promise a gift. Later, a woman named Honorata offers that she can bear Othon a child if he places a drop of his blood in her uterus. With this done, two of Othon&#x27;s servants try to commit suicide, taking the pregnant Honorata with them; but Othon injects a potion of epiphyte into Honorata. This deprives his son, Aghnar von Salza, of weight; wherefore Othon lets Honorata train Aghnar by herself. When Aghnar is seven years old, he defeats a machine set against him by his father; whereupon Othon continues his training. Honorata then confesses she was ordered to give birth to a hermaphrodite instead of a son, by the priestesses of Shabda-Oud. For her disobedience, the Shabda-Oud attempt her destruction. Othon, to assure his son&#x27;s ability to avenge her, orders Aghnar to fight him to the death, and Aghnar seizes the title of Metabaron for himself.

The sole human in a hostile world, Aghnar befriends a single primatoid, and becomes its tribe&#x27;s messiah. He then seizes a Shabda-Oud cetacyborg battleship with which to carry out his vengeance; but is distracted by the Cetacyborg&#x27;s crew&#x27;s original objective: to capture Princess Oda, to use her for the sisterhood&#x27;s breeding experiments. After a telepathic confrontation with the sisterhood, Oda suffers debilitating injuries; whereupon Honorata, kept alive by her own mental powers, transfers her own soul to Oda, who thereafter bears Aghnar a son. Disgusted by his incest, Aghnar attempts to kill his son, whom Oda/Honorata gives a cybernetic head to replace his own, for which he is called Steelhead. Steelhead later kills his parents. At his claim to the title of Metabaron, the Princess Doña Vicenta argues that his offspring must be unworthy of the title. Therefore, Steelhead assumes the disembodied head of Zaran Krleza, the last poet in the galaxy. United in body and head (but somehow maintaining individual personas), Steelhead and Zaran become Melmoth, which declares Doña Vicenta as the object of his affections, and resurrects her father, along with a rare, titanic tree (both destroyed by Steelhead himself). Doña Vicenta consents to the match; but the clone of her father attempts to take her by force, whereupon Vicenta gives him her eyes. Mollified, he permits Melmoth and Doña Vicenta to marry; but Melmoth discovers that Tonto, his robotic servant, has replaced her eyes by cybernetic sensors, and shuns her. Eventually, he reverts to the form and character of Steelhead, and takes care of his bride. When unable to preserve both of Vicenta&#x27;s twin children alive, Steelhead removes the male twin&#x27;s brain and implant it in the female child, and trains the androgynous Aghora would be trained as a warrior, who eventually faces his/her father in single combat to become Metabaron. To conceive an heir, he/she extracts the male cells from his/her own brain and implants them in his/her womb, thereby creating a male clone: the Nameless Metabaron who reigns in &quot;Incal&quot;.

In the last chapter of the saga (&quot;Sans-Nom, le dernier Méta-Baron&quot;), Lothar, the faithful android to whom Tonto is relating the Metabaronic lore in the frame narration, is identified as Steelhead himself, kept alive by his conversion to a robotic existence. Recovering his personality, but not his full memories, after a brief confrontation in which he gives Nameless the iconic scarring in his eyebrow, he allies himself with a vampiric creature to enact his vengeance upon his descendant. Ultimately, he repents; whereupon Nameless has himself sterilized, and remains in self-pity until the Spirit of the Castaka family, embodied by the mark on his chest, prompts Nameless to become a force for good, protecting life whenever he can. With this new mission, the Metabaron becomes the unstoppable mercenary featured in the Incal.

<doc id="897968" wikidata="Q819874" url="?curid=897968" title="Challenge coin">
<text>A challenge coin is a small coin or medallion, bearing an organization&#x27;s insignia or emblem and carried by the organization&#x27;s members. Traditionally, they might be given to prove membership when asked and to enhance morale. They are also collected by service members and law enforcement personnel. Historically, challenge coins were presented by unit commanders in recognition of special achievement by a member of the unit. They could also be exchanged in recognition of visits to an organization.

Modern day challenge coins may feature popular culture attributes or organizational values. Modern challenge coins are made in a variety of sizes and are often made using popular culture references, including superheroes and other well-known characters in a way that creates a parody.

==Origins==

There are several stories detailing the origins of the challenge coin. Many originate in popular culture based on current events.

The Roman Empire rewarded soldiers by presenting them with coins to recognize their achievements. In Rome, if soldiers excelled in battle one day, they would receive their typical day&#x27;s wages along with a separate bonus coin each. According to some accounts, these bonus coins were specially minted, featuring the marks of the legions from which they came. As a result, some soldiers apparently kept their coins as mementos, instead of spending them.

Challenge coins were also known as &quot;Portrait Medals&quot; during the Renaissance and were often used to commemorate specific events involving royalty, nobility, or other types of well-to-do individuals. The medals would be given as gifts or awards, and people also exchanged them with friends and associates. The most common format was for one side to depict the patron while the other showed something that represented that individual&#x27;s family, house, lineage, and/or seal.

The first instance of using a coin as a response to an actual challenge may come from the 17th century religious wars in France. Following King Louis XIV&#x27;s 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes, French Protestants began to suffer persecution by the state for their illegal religion. Many Protestants fled France to find religious freedom elsewhere. Among those who chose to remain in France were some from a Protestant group known as Huguenots who were forced to conduct their religious services in secret. In order to avoid infiltration by state spies the Huguenots began to carry their méreau communion coin. When challenged while trying to gain entry to Protestant church services the Huguenot would produce his méreau coin as a token to show allegiance with the Protestant Church and be admitted entry.

According to one story, challenge coins originated during World War I. Before the entry of the United States into the war in 1917 American volunteers from all parts of the country filled the newly formed flying squadrons of the Army and Naval Air Service. Some were wealthy scions attending colleges such as Yale and Harvard who quit in mid-term to join the war.

In one squadron, a wealthy lieutenant ordered medallions struck in solid bronze and presented them to his unit. One young pilot placed the medallion in a small leather pouch that he wore about his neck. Shortly after acquiring the medallion, the pilot&#x27;s aircraft was severely damaged by ground fire. He was forced to land behind enemy lines and was immediately captured by a German patrol. In order to discourage his escape, the Germans took all of his personal identification except for the small leather pouch around his neck. In the meantime, he was taken to a small French town near the front. Taking advantage of a bombardment that night, he escaped. However, he was without personal identification. He succeeded in avoiding German patrols by donning civilian attire and reached the front lines. With great difficulty, he crossed no-man&#x27;s land. Eventually, he stumbled onto a French outpost. Saboteurs had plagued the French in the sector. They sometimes masqueraded as civilians and wore civilian clothes. Not recognizing the young pilot&#x27;s American accent, the French thought him to be a saboteur and made ready to execute him. He had no identification to prove his allegiance, but he did have his leather pouch containing the medallion. He showed the medallion to his would-be executioners and one of his French captors recognized the squadron insignia on the medallion. They delayed his execution long enough for him to confirm his identity. Instead of shooting him they gave him a bottle of wine.

Back at his squadron, it became tradition to ensure that all members carried their medallion or coin at all times. This was accomplished through challenge in the following manner: a challenger would ask to see the medallion, if the challenged could not produce a medallion, they were required to buy a drink of choice for the member who challenged them. If the challenged member produced a medallion, then the challenging member was required to pay for the drink. This tradition continued throughout the war and for many years after the war while surviving members of the squadron were still alive.

According to another story, challenge coins date back to World War II and were first used by Office of Strategic Service personnel who were deployed in Nazi held France. Similarly, Jim Harrington proposed a Jolly sixpence club amongst the junior officers of the 107th Infantry. The coins were simply a local coin used as a &quot;bona fides&quot; during a personal meeting to help verify a person&#x27;s identity. There would be specific aspects such as type of coin, date of the coin, etc. that were examined by each party. This helped prevent infiltration into the meeting by a spy who would have to have advance knowledge of the meeting time and place as well as what coin was to be presented, amongst other signals, as bona fides.

Others argue the tradition started during the Vietnam War, when an Army infantry-run bar tried to keep non-infantrymen away by forcing &quot;outsiders&quot; to buy drinks for the whole bar if they couldn&#x27;t prove they had been in combat. The &quot;proof&quot; started with enemy bullets, then got a little out of control with grenades, rockets and unexploded ordnance. So, a coin-sized item emblazoned with the unit&#x27;s insignia became the accepted form of proof. This tradition, now known as a coin check, continues today, hence it being called a &quot;challenge&quot; coin.

While a number of legends place the advent of challenge coins in the post-Korean Conflict era (some as late as the Vietnam War), or even later, Colonel William &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Quinn had coins made for those who served in his 17th Infantry Regiment during 1950 to 1958. The 17th Infantry Regiment &quot;Buffalo&quot; coin is the oldest challenge coin known in existence. On one side of the coin is a picture of a buffalo with the date 1812, which signified the year the unit was formed. On the other side was the 17th Infantry patch with the dates 1950 – 1958 and the word Korea to signify the tour. The cross and fort icon represent the unit&#x27;s heritage which started in Cuba during the civil war. This coin is recognized as one of the oldest and most valuable challenge coins in circulation. Very few remain available, and most are thought to be in private collections.

Colonel Verne Green, commander of the 10th Special Forces Group-A, embraced the idea. He had a special coin struck with the unit&#x27;s badge and motto in 1969. Until the 1980s, his unit was the only unit with an active challenge coin tradition.

There is another story about an American soldier scheduled to rendezvous with Philippine guerrillas during WWII. As the story goes, he carried a Philippine solid silver coin that was stamped on one side with the unit insignia. The coin was used to verify, to the guerrillas, that the soldier was their valid contact for the mission against the Japanese.

The challenge coin tradition has spread to other military units, in all branches of service, and even to non-military organizations as well as the United States Congress, which produces challenge coins for members of Congress to give to constituents. Today, challenge coins are given to members upon joining an organization, as an award to improve morale, and sold to commemorate special occasions or as fundraisers. In the Air Force, military training instructors award an airman&#x27;s coin to new enlisted personnel upon completion of their United States Air Force Basic Military Training and to new officers upon completion of the Air Force Officer Training School.

==U.S. presidents==

Challenge coins issued by presidents date back to the late 1990s. Separately, the White House Communication Agency (WHCA) has issued challenge coins for foreign heads and military during presidential visits. In May 2018, controversy arose when WHCA released a coin featuring President Donald Trump and North Korean head Kim Jong-un ahead of peace talks scheduled for June 2018 in Singapore.

President Bill Clinton displayed several racks of challenge coins, which had been given to him by U.S. service members, on the credenza behind his Oval Office desks. These coins are currently on display at the Clinton Library. The challenge coins appear in the background of his official portrait, now hanging in the White House.

President George W. Bush received a challenge coin from a Marine combat patrol unit during his short but unexpected visit to Al Asad Airbase in Anbar province, Iraq, 3 September 2007.

President Barack Obama, in addition to handing challenge coins to U.S. service members, would leave coins on the memorial graves of dead soldiers.

President Donald Trump&#x27;s coin broke with tradition, omitting the presidential seal, the motto &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; and the thirteen arrows representing the thirteen original states. His campaign slogan &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; appears on both sides. It features a banner at the bottom, which also serves as a base allowing the coin to stand upright.

President Joe Biden&#x27;s coin depicts his home state of Delaware and &quot;261st&quot; for the 261st Theater Tactical Signal Brigade of the Delaware Army National Guard, his late son Beau Biden&#x27;s unit.

==Challenging==

The tradition of a challenge is the most common way to ensure that members are carrying their unit&#x27;s coin. The rules of a challenge are not always formalized for a unit, and may vary between organizations. The challenge only applies to those members that have been given a coin formally by their unit. This may lead to some controversy when challenges are initiated between members of different organizations and is not recommended. The tradition of the coin challenge is meant to be a source of morale in a unit, and forcing the challenge can cause a reverse effect. The act of challenging is called a &quot;coin check&quot; and is usually loudly announced.

The challenge, which can be made at any time, begins with the challenger drawing his/her coin, and slapping or placing the coin on the table or bar. In noisy environments, continuously rapping the challenge coin on a surface may initiate the challenge. (Accidentally dropping a challenge coin is considered to be a deliberate challenge to all present.) Everyone being challenged must immediately produce the coin for their organization and anyone failing to do so must buy a round of drinks for the challenger and everyone else who has their challenge coin. However, should everyone challenged be able to produce their coin, the challenger must buy a round of drinks for the group.

While most holders of challenge coins usually carry them in their pockets or in some other readily accessible place on their persons, most versions of the rules permit a challenged person &quot;a step and a reach&quot; or if an individual has an extra coin to pass it off to the person closest to them. Coins on belt buckles or key chains are not acceptable for meeting a challenge. However, a coin worn in a pouch around the neck is acceptable for meeting a coin challenge.

Variants of the rules include, but are not limited to, the following: If someone is able to steal a challenge coin, everyone in the group must buy a drink for that person. During a challenge, everyone in the group must buy a drink for the holder of the highest-ranking coin.

A coin&#x27;s rank is determined by the rank of the giver of the challenge coin. For example, a coin presented by an Admiral would outrank a coin presented by a Vice Admiral, while both would outrank a coin presented by a Captain. Traditionally, the presentation of a coin is passed during a handshake. Some units provide strict time limits to respond to a challenge. Also, coins are ranked in level of difficulty in attaining them. An Infantryman coin would outrank a logistical coin. A Ranger coin would outrank an Infantryman coin.

Traditionally, rules of a challenge include a prohibition against defacing the coin, especially if it makes it easier to carry at all times. If the challenge coin is attached to a belt buckle or key ring or has had a hole drilled in it to attach to a lanyard, it no longer qualifies as a challenge coin.

==Appearance==
There are many finishes available—from a simple pewter to 24K gold. While there are only a few base metals, the patina (finish) can range from gold, silver, or nickel to brass, copper, or bronze—plus the antiqued variations. Soft or hard enamel or a printed inset with an epoxy coating may add color (the epoxies are often more resilient and scratch resistant than the metal surfaces).

Challenge coins are often made from various types of metals and are typically plated to enhance their appearance and durability. The plating used in challenge coins can vary, and each type offers a unique look and feel. Challenge coins can be coated in a wide variety of coin plating finishes such as; antique gold, antique silver, antique brass, polished gold, polished brass, polished silver, black nickel, or other types of plating finishes. Here are some common types of plating used in challenge coins:

# Gold Plating: This gives the coin a high-quality, prestigious look. Gold plating can range from bright to more subdued antique finishes.
# Silver Plating: Silver plating provides a sleek, modern appearance. Like gold, it can also be finished in a bright or antique style.
# Nickel Plating: Nickel plating is a popular choice for a shiny, mirror-like finish. It&#x27;s less expensive than gold or silver but still offers a high-quality appearance. 
# Copper Plating: Copper plating gives a reddish-brown hue to the coin and is often used for a vintage or antique look.
# Brass Plating: Brass plating offers a golden-yellow color, similar to gold but with a different tone and is usually more cost-effective.
# Black Nickel or Black Metal Plating: This provides a dark, sleek, and modern look. It&#x27;s often used for special editions or more contemporary designs.
# Dual Plating: Some challenge coins use a combination of two different metals for a more dynamic and intricate appearance.

==Cost==
Challenge coins are moderately inexpensive to design and produce. There are two basic processes by which to manufacture: zinc-alloy castings or die struck bronze.

Zinc alloy castings offer the advantage of low cost. Zinc casting also allows more flexibility in design like cutouts found on spinner coins or bottle opener coins. While a die struck bronze or brass coin is more expensive, the result renders a far superior product (numismatic quality).

, coins manufactured in China and South Korea typically cost between US $2.50 to US $7.00 per coin, depending on production process and complexity of design, laser engraving, enamels, voids, etc. The dies must be sculpted by an artist and can range in cost from US$50 to US$300, depending on complexity. The cost of domestic manufacture can be many times this amount.

In order to be competitive, most North American companies offering challenge coins rely on having the product manufactured offshore. Many challenge coins are fabricated in South Korea, as the connection to the US military bases there is strong, and costs are cheaper than those made in the US.

==Uses==

Besides using coins for challenging, they are also used as rewards or awards for outstanding service or performance of duty. As such, they are used as a tool to build morale. Military officials occasionally give them to non-military personnel for outstanding service or rewards, like the case of student athletes at Northeastern University.

In the context as they are used by the modern U.S. military, the tradition probably began among special forces units during the Vietnam War. The tradition spread through the Airborne community, and by the early 1980s also into the 75th Ranger Regiment. As officers were reassigned as their careers progressed, they carried with them the tradition of awarding a unit coin for acts that were worthy of recognition but yet lacked enough merit to submit the soldiers act for an official medal.

One widely known challenge coin in the United States Air Force was the &quot;Bull Dog&quot; challenge coin that was exclusive to B-52 enlisted tail gunners. Since the B-52 gunner position was phased out in 1991, this famous challenge coin has become rarer.

This coin was presented to gunners upon graduation from their Air Force technical training and their entry into the &quot;Gunners Association&quot;. In the earlier days of bombers, a bean or a nugget was used. The coin represents the attributes of strength and courage as reflected in the Bulldog, the gunner&#x27;s official mascot. The coin was also given to certain &quot;honorary gunners&quot;, usually commanders and leaders who portrayed the spirit of the bulldog.

Some collectors buy them for their numismatic value.

Coins given as awards for accomplishments are normally given to the recipient during a handshake, passing from the right hand of the giver to the right hand of the awardee. It is also normal for the giver to offer a brief explanation of the reason for awarding the coin.

==Outside the military==

Challenge coins are also exchanged outside the military. NASCAR, the NFL, cadets of the Civil Air Patrol, Eagle Scouts, Canine Companions, and World Series of Poker all have their own challenge coins. They are also becoming popular with police departments, fire departments, labor unions, and fraternal organizations. In 2007, the Utah Symphony and Opera gave challenge coins to all of its staff and musicians, making it the first symphony organization in America to do so. Franklin Public School in Ontario has a coin that is given to graduates, featuring its mascot &#x27;Frankie&#x27;. Many non-profits, especially those with connections to the military, give challenge coins to donors to acknowledge their support of the organization.
The FBI&#x27;s Crisis Response unit was the first unit in the FBI to issue coins to unit members in late 1980s. Memorial coins can be used to commemorate fallen officers.

===New York City Police Department===

Coins have been created by the Police Benevolent Association for NYPD precincts. One of these coins, which was used as a fundraiser dedicated to an officer in the 67 Pct. who was injured in the line of duty, has been criticized for containing racist imagery despite the officer being of Afro American West Indian descent.

===Motorcycle clubs===

Another organization in which challenge coins have gained popularity is the &quot;National Association of Buffalo Soldiers and Troopers Motorcycle Club&quot; (NABSTMC), which has over 85 chapters totaling over 2,000 members. The coin must be earned by the members for a noteworthy accomplishment.

In 2009, the Harley Owners Group (HOG) created and made available its own challenge coin to Harley-Davidson motorcycle owners.

===Media, business, and education===

Numerous examples illustrate challenge coins handed out in the media industry:

In 2020, a challenge coin went viral when America&#x27;s largest challenge coin retailer released a coin about an incident that occurred with Connecticut state trooper Matthew Spina.

In 2020, the Secretary of the State of Virginia sent a cease and desist to Louis &quot;Uncle Louie&quot; Gregory regarding a challenge coin he created.

In 2022, the President of the United States announced that the U.S. Government would investigate the origins of a Border Patrol Challenge coin. The coin was later debated on the House Floor by the U.S. Congress.

In his audio commentary for the DVD release of &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;, film director Jon Favreau notes that he had &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; challenge coins made to distribute to United States Air Force personnel as a gesture of thanks for their cooperation while the production (and its predecessor, &quot;Iron Man&quot;) filmed on location at Edwards Air Force Base.

Bill Prady, executive producer of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, gave the &quot;Big Bang Theory&quot; &quot;executive producer&#x27;s challenge coin&quot; to the crew of the last space shuttle.

On the &quot;Rockets&quot; episode of &quot;Lock N&#x27; Load with R. Lee Ermey&quot;, R. Lee (Gunny) Ermey presents a challenge coin to Second Lieutenant Carr as a reward for being the &quot;top gun&quot; in his class with the Javelin Portable Rocket Launching System.

Members of the American Radio Relay League who are volunteer examiners may carry the VEC (volunteer examiner coordinator) challenge coin. These members are responsible for administering Federal Communications Commission sanctioned examinations that allow successful applicants to qualify as amateur radio operators in the three different license categories of: technician, general, and amateur extra.

The crew of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; were given challenge coins designed by show creator Vince Gilligan for each new season. Another challenge coin was also included in the Blu-ray set of the entire series of the show.

Video game companies like Treyarch gave these coins with certain packages for the release of &quot;Black Ops 2&quot;.

The crowdfunded movie &quot;Lazer Team&quot; gave challenge coins to its backers as an optional perk of funding the movie.

Meanwhile, examples can also be found in the realms of business and education. Many businesses are using corporate coins to recognize staff achievements, improve employee morale and reduce turnover,

=== Labor unions ===
Many labor unions, including the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the International Association of Firefighters, have adopted the practice of selling and/or disseminating challenge coins. 

==Canada==

One of the first appearance of a challenge coin within the Canadian Forces (CF) was that of the Canadian Airborne Regiment. Although conceptualized in the early 1970s, it was not officially adopted until the regiment returned from Cyprus in 1974.

Recognized as an &quot;Americanism&quot;, the widespread use of challenge coins is new to the Canadian Forces and was introduced by General Rick Hillier as the Canadian Army began to work more closely with the US military. While many regiments and military establishments purchase them as &#x27;challenge coins&#x27;, most branches and schools within the CF use them for presentation purposes.

The first RCAF coin belonged to 427 Squadron. Back in the Second World War, 427 and the film studios Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) shared the lion as their respective symbol. During a ceremony held on 27 May 1943, a bronze statuette of a lion was presented to the squadron as were MGM&#x27;s coins for the squadron members. These coins granted free access to the MGM&#x27;s theaters in Britain and were popular with aircrew and ground crew alike. In 1982, the custom was reintroduced by Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Cunnigham, then the squadron commanding officer; it has since expanded widely within the RCAF tactical aviation community.
Every new officer cadet at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, is issued a challenge coin upon completion of First-Year Orientation Period. The coin is engraved with the name of the college in French and English surrounding the college&#x27;s coat of arms on the obverse. The cadet&#x27;s college number and the Memorial Arch is on the reverse surrounded by the motto in both languages.

Members of the Corps of Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (RCEME) Fund are issued challenge coins with the current RCEME badge and the member&#x27;s branch fund membership number on the obverse side, and the original pre-unification RCEME badge and branch motto on the reverse side. Usually, these are issued to craftsmen at the Canadian Forces School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, in Borden, Ontario, where branch fund membership is first offered.

The coin from Commander Canadian Special Operations Forces Command is a dull colour, but distinct by its pierced sections.

Many of the CF training centres and staff colleges have a distinct coin—some available for the students to purchase, others available only by presentation by the establishment or the commandant for exemplary achievement while attending the facility. General (retired) Walter Natynczyk, when he was Chief of the Defence Staff, and the Canadian Forces Chief Warrant Officer often presented their personalized coins to deserving soldiers.

Police, corrections, security and fire departments have embraced the concept, and have found coins to be an excellent means of team building and creating a sense of brotherhood or belonging. Many feature a patron saint, badge or representative equipment.

==Switzerland==

The challenge coin tradition was introduced into the Swiss Armed Forces by American officers on training missions and other assignments for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, of which Switzerland is a member. Coins are not issued, but rather ordered and paid for by Swiss officers of various branches within the Army.

==Australia and New Zealand==
Coins have come into use by various Australian and New Zealand political leaders, senior officers and NCOs, under the influence of presentations from American personnel. Several hundred types of New Zealand challenge coins have been produced in recent decades.

==United Kingdom==
Exchange officers and British military visitors to US units and formations in recent decades have often been presented with challenge coins. The British Army has had challenge coins for recruiting purposes since the mid-2000s - for example the Special Air Service and Royal Engineer units have such challenge coins. British military medical units also discovered the tradition while working with American units in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Department of Military Anesthesia and Critical Care has been issuing a coin since 2006.

Tradition dictates that challenge coins are shown within social environments (see above) with the loser of the &quot;coin check&quot; purchasing drinks for those others involved. Following a turbulent period of change within the British Military, commanders have tightened restrictions on the consumption of alcohol and any activity that encourages drinking, leaving the traditional challenge coin as a collection item.

<doc id="897971" wikidata="Q3397053" url="?curid=897971" title="Malabadi Bridge">
<text>The Malabadi Bridge or Karaman Bridge (, ) is an arch bridge spanning the Batman River near Malabadi village in Silvan in southeastern Turkey. Construction began in the year AD 1146/47 during the Artuqid period, and appears to have been completed by about 1154 (AH 549). The bridge was commissioned by Husam al-Din Timurtash of Mardin, son of Ilghazi, and grandson of Artuk Bey which one of the important commander of the Oghuz Turks.

According to the local 12th-century historian Ibn al-Azraq al-Farīqī, the contemporary bridge replaced one built in 668/69 (AH 48) that had collapsed in 1144 (AH 539). Inconsistencies between the two surviving manuscript copies of Ibn al-Azraq&#x27;s account make it difficult to definitively identify the Malabadi bridge as the one he refers to as the Qaramān or Aqramān bridge. Nevertheless, many aspects of his geographical description and historical account support this identification.

Ibn al-Azraq says that construction of the current bridge was initiated by the Artuqid ruler of Mayafaraqin and Mardin al-Saʿīd Ḥusām al-Dīn Temür-Tash in 1146/47 (AH 541), under the supervision of al-Zāhid bin al-Ṭawīl. After al-Zāhid had built the bridge&#x27;s eastern footing it was destroyed by floods. Al-Zāhid was fined for &quot;defective craftsmanship&quot; and replaced by Amir Saif al-Dīn Shīrbārīk Maudūd bin ʿAlī (bin Alp-Yaruq) bin Artuq. Shīrbārīk restarted the work under the supervision of Abuʾl-Khair bin al-Ḥakīm al-Fāsūl, who used massive timbers in the construction. By 1153 the bridge was nearly finished. However, at the time of the death of Ḥusām al-Dīn Temür-Tash on 18 January 1154, the arch was not yet complete. His successor, Najm al-Dīn Alpī, set about completing the bridge, and, although work was again interrupted by flooding, &quot;[h]e built and repaired it and completed the joining of the arch.&quot;

The French architectural historian Albert Gabriel and epigraphist Jean Sauvaget visited the bridge in 1932 and Sauvaget discerned an inscription in the name of Temür-Tash with the year AH 542 (1147/48), which possibly corresponds to the start of the second construction under Shīrbārīk.

The bridge was restored in the late twelfth century, and recently in the beginning of the 20th century. It was once the only bridge across the river in this area, and was in continuous use until the 1950s, when a new road bridge was completed upstream.

The span of the bridge crosses perpendicular to the river, but the roadway is at an angle to the river, so there are angular breaks in the east and west approaches. The approaches rise from ground level to meet the central span, which is a pointed arch high over the deepest part of the river. Constructed from coloured solid masonry, the approaches have small arches built into them to let flood-waters through. Two of the piers of the bridge sit in the river; the western support is decorated with two carved figures, one standing and one sitting. The bridge is long and wide, in height and a main span of . The roadway has two toll-booths, one either side of the main span. The spandrels of the main arch incorporate small rooms for weary travelers. The Malabadi Bridge in Silvan, Diyarbakır takes its name from Bad, (Badh ibn Dustak), the founder of the Marwanids. Malabadi means &quot;house of Bad&quot; in Kurdish.

In 2016 it was inscribed in the Tentative list of World Heritage Sites in Turkey.

<text>Marian Drăgulescu (born 18 December 1980 in Bucharest) is a former Romanian artistic gymnast. During his senior gymnastics career he won 31 medals at Olympic Games at World and European Championships, of which eight are gold medals at the World Championships and ten are gold medals at European Championships. Drăgulescu&#x27;s strongest events were vault and floor, on which he was a multiple world champion and Olympic medalist. The handspring double front somersault with ½ turn is named after him in the Code of Points. In the all-around, Drăgulescu was the European champion (2004) and bronze medalist (2000) and placed 8th at the 2004 Olympic Games.

== Early life and career ==
As a young boy, Drăgulescu only attended gymnastics lessons because they were an excuse to get out of karate classes. However, as training became more intense he decided to switch to swimming because it was free. His father was not aware that he was not at gymnastics, but he soon went back to the gym as swimming was no longer free after three months.
Drăgulescu&#x27;s debut as a junior at a major international competition was in 1998 European Championships in St. Petersburg. There, he won gold on pommel horse, silver on vault, and bronze on floor and in the team event, and he placed eight in the individual all-around.

== Senior career ==

=== 1999–2003 ===
Drăgulescu&#x27;s first participation as a senior at a major event was at the 1999 World Championships, where he placed fourth on vault, eight on high bar and 26th all around. One year later he won an all-around bronze, a gold on floor and a silver with the team at the 2000 European championships in Bremen ahead of the Sydney Games. His debut at the Olympic Games in 2000 was rather modest, coming sixth on the floor and 13th in the all-around. He soon overcame the disappointment suffered in Sydney at the world championships at Ghent in Belgium the following year, where he was in top form, winning gold on the floor and on vault. In 2002 he added three more gold medals to his collection on two on vault and with the team and a bronze on floor at the 2002 Europeans and at the 2002 Worlds. For his achievements he was awarded the &quot;Gymnast of the Year Award&quot; (2002) by the International Press Association. He received this award during the 2003 World Championships in Anaheim. Here he won silver on vault, placed fourth on floor in a final in which silver was not awarded, sixth all around and fourth with the team.

=== 2004 and the Olympic Games ===
The 2004 European Championships in Ljubljana were an especially successful meet for Drăgulescu. He helped his team to defend their title previously won in 2002. Additionally, Marian won the all around title, and gold medals on floor and on vault. The only other gymnast to win four gold medals at a European Championships was Nadia Comăneci, who captured four gold medals at the 1975 European Championships.

At the 2004 Olympic Games Drăgulescu helped his team to a bronze medal and was a forerunner in the all around event until a mistake on the high bar, after which he still thrilled the crowd with a difficult routine. He won silver in the men&#x27;s floor only after a tiebreaker was needed with gold medalist Kyle Shewfelt. On the men&#x27;s vault he performed the exceptionally difficult vault that bears his name (a handspring double front with half turn) and received a 9.9, the highest score awarded in World or Olympic competition since 1995. It seemed he needed only to land his second vault to take gold, but he fell. However Drăgulescu was still awarded the bronze, a controversial decision because the disparity between the judges scores was greater than is permitted and therefore some or all of them should have been altered. They were not, and Shewfelt was pushed into fourth place. The Canadian federation filed a protest, but the result stood. In 2005 the judges involved were suspended for one year.

=== Post Athens and the 2008 Olympic Games ===
Drăgulescu announced his retirement mid-2005, but has since returned and in the world championships in Melbourne in 2005 he won the vault title. He had long been hampered by the lack of a strong second vault, but debuted a new one being a round-off with half twist entry on platform into forward two and a half twist off.

Since then Drăgulescu has dominated that event, retaining his title at the 2006 World Championships in Aarhus, Denmark and winning the floor title as well. Drăgulescu no longer competed in all six events, which had given him more time to focus on those he still trained.

In 2007, Drăgulescu participated in the European Championships which turned to be an unfortunate event for him. On floor exercise, he did not manage to complete his routine. After a hard landing to the back of his head on a layout Thomas salto, he twice attempted to run into his final tumbling pass. Instead of tumbling, he stopped and walked off the podium. That afternoon Drăgulescu competed in the vault final, but missed his second vault (round-off, half-on, 2-1/2 twisting front), landing improperly and injuring his back. Romanian doctors then advised Drăgulescu to immediately stop training and undergo a detailed investigation in the United States to assess the seriousness of his injury. Hence, he missed the 2007 world championships and resumed training only several months prior to the 2008 Olympic Games.

Although Drăgulescu made the vault finals at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, history repeated itself and, as in Athens 2004, he fell on his second vault after an almost faultless first vault (which scored a 16.800), losing his chance to win his first Olympic Gold Medal. However, unlike in Athens, Drăgulescu did not medal on any event, placing fourth on vault with seventh on team and floor.

=== Post Beijing ===
Drăgulescu was very disappointed when he failed to medal at the Beijing Olympics, saying &quot;my soul broke&quot; after he fell on the landing of his second vault attempt. He announced his retirement and his intention to become a gymnastic coach. However, he reconsidered retirement and went to compete in Germany for Fabian Hambüchen&#x27;s club, KTV Straubenhardt. In the club&#x27;s first three competitions, Drăgulescu competed on floor and vault, obtaining the league&#x27;s top scores on the latter event: 16.500 in the first two competitions, and 16.300 in the third one. The club won the second place in December 2008. After competing in the German league Dragulescu formally announced his retirement. He went to coach gymnastics alongside his former team colleagues Marius Urzică and Dan Potra at Dinamo Club Bucharest. He declared that his goal is to create a gymnast better than himself.

=== 2009 ===

In 2009, Drăgulescu once again reconsidered his retirement from gymnastics. He had a very successful comeback winning the floor and the vault titles at the 2009 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.

=== 2010–2011 ===
In 2010, Drăgulescu skipped the European Championships and Romanian Nationals but was a member of the Romanian team at the World Championships. There, he only competed on vault, floor and high bar, but did not qualify for the team or any individual final. After skipping 2011&#x27;s spring competition season, Drăgulescu made another comeback in the Romanian Nationals at the end of August. This competition marked his comeback as an all-around gymnast after a break of seven years. In October, he joined the team at the 2011 World Championships and competed in the preliminary rounds, helping them qualify for the 2012 Olympics. Individually, he made the all-around, floor and vault finals giving him a chance to regain his titles, but due to injury, he could not compete and withdrew from all three finals.

=== 2015 ===
Drăgulescu participated in the 2015 Israel Cup winning gold in vault. Meanwhile, he has been training a new skill, potentially the &quot;Drăgulescu 2&quot;, which is a Drăgulescu with a full twist instead of ½.

On 1 November 2015 Drăgulescu participated in the 2015 World Championships held in Glasgow, Scotland, and won the silver medal in the individual vault event final with an average combined score of 15.400. His two vaults were the &quot;Drăgulescu&quot; or front handspring double (tucked) somersault with ½ twist, his own skill, and &quot;Li Xiaopeng&quot; or a &quot;half on–2½ off&quot; with D-scores 6.0 and 6.2. Ri Se Gwang of North Korea won gold (15.450) with own D-score 6.4 vaults, the &quot;Ri Se Gwang 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;. It was noted that the 34-year-old Drăgulescu was the oldest individual vault finalist at these championships.

=== 2016 ===
Drăgulescu (age 36) participated in the 2016 European Championships held in Bern, Switzerland in May 2016, tying Armenian Artur Davtian for silver on vault with a score of 15.316 and also winning silver on floor with a score of 15.333.

At the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro that August, Drăgulescu participated in and qualified for the event final on vault. In the conclusion of the event, his average combined score was tied for the bronze medal with Japanese teenager Kenzo Shirai, but after applying the Olympic tiebreak rules to both scores, Drăgulescu was relegated to fourth place due to Shirai&#x27;s massive combined score on his first vault, which was brought on by the total of his scores in two parts, the final&#x27;s highest execution score of 9.466 and second highest difficulty score of 6.4, for the successful completion of the now officially named &quot;Shirai 2&quot; or 3½-twisting Yurchenko on vault, a new and an extremely difficult skill, in competition. In Drăgulescu&#x27;s best Olympic performance of the same two vaults he had been using for many years now, and they were once again the &quot;Drăgulescu&quot; (a handspring double front tucked with ½ twist to land; D-score – 6.0) and &quot;Li Xiaopeng&quot; (Yurchenko, ½ twist on with 2½ twists in layout off; D-score – 6.2). However, he still lost. This was also the second time that the tiebreak had not worked in favour of Drăgulescu at the Olympics. The first time happened at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens where he missed out on the gold medal and settled for silver when he tied for the highest score with 9.787 in the individual floor exercise apparatus finals. After applying the tiebreak, Kyle Shewfelt of Canada ranked ahead in first with Drăgulescu relegating to second place.

=== 2017 ===
In 2017, Drăgulescu was once again selected to represent the host Romanian team at the 2017 European Championships. He won gold in the floor exercise event final, his first victory at the European Championships in 11 years. He followed up his success at the championships in vault the next day, winning the silver medal.

At the 2017 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships, Drăgulescu finished the individual vault final in fourth place with an average combined score of 14.716. He had simplified his second vault to the &quot;½ on–double full off&quot; instead of his usual, the &quot;Li Xiao Peng&quot;. Kenzō Shirai of Japan, the man Drăgulescu tied for the third highest final score in the individual vault final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, won the gold medal with a score of 14.900. Drăgulescu was again the oldest individual vault finalist at 36 years, 9 months and 20 days old.

=== 2019 ===
At the 2019 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships, Drăgulescu repeated his 2017 performance by placing fourth again in the individual vault final with an average combined score of 14.624. He had also stayed with the same simplified second vault he competed at these championships in 2017. Once more, he was the oldest individual vault finalist, this time at 38 years, 9 months and 25 days old.

=== 2020/2021 ===
Drăgulescu had previously qualified for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo as a specialist in the opening rounds of two individual events—floor exercise and vault—but he ultimately chose to not compete the individual floor exercise apparatus and fully focus only on vault. His qualification scores on vault were 13.466 and 14.533 to average 13.999 and place 16, which did not qualify him for the finals. Competing in individual vault qualifications, Drăgulescu was 40 years, 7 months and 6 days old.

<text>Francis John Welsh Whipple ScD FInstP (17 March 1876 – 25 September 1943) was an English mathematician, meteorologist and seismologist. From 1925 to 1939, he was superintendent of the Kew Observatory.

==Biography==
Whipple was the son of Kew Observatory employees George Mathews Whipple and Elizabeth Beckley, an astronomical photographer.

Whipple attended Willington Preparatory School in Putney, where in 1888 he won a scholarship at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School. From here, he obtained a scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1895, where he was placed Second Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos of 1897. In 1899, he showed that bicycles could be self stable.

==Career==
From 1899–1912, he was an assistant master at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, and then worked at the Meteorological Office from 1912. From 1925, he was Assistant-Director of the Meteorological Office and Superintendent of Kew Observatory, where he succeeded Charles Chree. Whipple remained in this post until he retired in 1939. He also served as president of the Royal Meteorological Society from 1936 to 1937.

In his role as Superintendent of Kew Observatory, Whipple played an important part in the recording of earthquakes, since Kew had been the site of a seismological observatory since 1898. During his time as superintendent, Whipple devoted considerable time and energy to improve the quality of the seismological observations. He realised that the sensitivity of the seismometers was badly affected by wind, since wind would cause the whole observatory building to move. So he designed and commissioned a new, underground bunker to hold the Kew seismometers. Whipple was Chair of the Seismological Investigations Committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science from 1931-1939, and also served on the National Committee for Geodesy and Geophysics. These roles brought him into contact with prominent seismologists around the world. Whipple was a Fellow of the Institute of Physics, and was awarded the ScD degree from Cambridge in 1929.

==Family and connections==
Francis Whipple had an older brother, Robert, whose collection of scientific instruments and books was the basis of the Whipple Museum of the History of Science in Cambridge. Whipple&#x27;s father, George Whipple, was superintendent of Kew Observatory from 1876-1893; as was George&#x27;s godfather, John Welsh, from 1852-1859.

<text>Marius Daniel Urzică (born 30 September 1975 in Toplița, Romania) is a Romanian gymnast. Urzică is an Olympic champion, a three-time world champion and a three-time European champion on pommel horse. He competed at three Olympic Games, medaling each time on pommel horse (gold Sydney 2000, silver Atlanta 1996 and silver Athens 2004) and contributed to the team bronze in Athens 2004. His unique technique and style of performance have won him the recognition as one of the greatest masters on this piece of apparatus ever, together with Miroslav Cerar and Zoltán Magyar. Known as &quot;The King of the Pommels&quot; in 2001 he achieved the maximum score of 10.00 on this piece of apparatus at the Glasgow Grand Prix. Two elements in artistic gymnastics, one on pommel horse and one on parallel bars are named after him.

He was the founder of &quot;Romanian Golden Team&quot;.

==Skills==
Urzică had difficult routines, which he always tried to execute without fault. Among his skills on the pommel horse was a super E element called &quot;the four Russians on one handle&quot; and a move named after him rated C in the Code of points. On parallel bars he was known for his eponymous salto forward to 1/1 turn to upper arm hang rated E.

<text>Paul Elbert Hamm (born September 24, 1982) is a retired American artistic gymnast and member of the United States men&#x27;s national artistic gymnastics team. He is the 2004 Olympic all-around champion, a three-time Olympic medalist, and the 2003 World all-around champion. Hamm is the most successful American male gymnast in history, one of only two American gymnasts (along with Simone Biles) to win the all-around title at both the Olympics and the World Championships, and the only male American gymnast to do so.

==Early life==
Hamm was born September 24, 1982, in Washburn, Wisconsin, to Sandy and Cecily Hamm. His twin brother, Morgan Hamm, is also a gymnast and Olympic medalist. His older sister, Elizabeth (Betsy), is a former member of the USA Gymnastics Senior National Team. He was raised in Waukesha, Wisconsin and attended Waukesha South High School.

==Gymnastics career==
Hamm is a three-time, consecutive U.S. National all-around champion, winning the titles from 2002 to 2004. In 2003, he became the first American man to win the all-around title at a World Championships. At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Hamm competed alongside his twin brother Morgan Hamm and finished 5th in the team competition and 14th in the individual all-around competition.

===2004 Summer Olympics===
Hamm competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens once again with his twin brother Morgan Hamm. He won the silver medal in the team competition and won the gold medal in the all-around. He also nearly won the gold medal on the horizontal bar but was awarded the silver medal after a tiebreaker.

In the all-around competition, Hamm took a disastrous fall on the vault in the fourth rotation, nearly falling into the judges&#x27; bench, and had a judge and the bench not been able to break Hamm&#x27;s fall, he might have fallen from the podium and sustained injury. However, numerous faults by the other gymnasts, combined with Hamm&#x27;s performance on the parallel bars, returned him to fourth place after the fifth rotation. His horizontal bar routine in the final rotation earned a score of 9.837, winning him the gold medal by a margin of .012, the closest in Olympic gymnastics history. His scores on the six disciplines were:

* Floor: 9.725 (1st)
* Pommel Horse: 9.700 (4th)
* Rings: 9.587 (8th)
* Vault: 9.137 (12th)
* Parallel Bars: 9.837 (1st)
* Horizontal bar: 9.837 (1st)
* Overall: 57.823 (1st)

====Gold medal controversy====
Almost immediately after the competition, Hamm&#x27;s gold medal in the all-around was called into doubt due to a scoring issue.

The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) ruled that South Korean bronze medalist Yang Tae Young was incorrectly given a start value of 9.9 instead of 10.0 in the parallel bars event during the all-around final. The 0.100 point omitted from Yang&#x27;s start value in parallel bars, determined by the difficulty of the routine, was because the judges believed Yang had performed a move called a &quot;morisue&quot; instead of a &quot;belle&quot; during his routine. The difference in difficulty between those two moves—the 0.100 point—was the difference between third place and first, and, therefore, between the bronze medal and the gold medal. The FIG suspended three judges but said the results would not be changed.

Adding to the news headlines, when the FIG ruled Yang&#x27;s start value was incorrect, the crowd began booing the judges for about ten minutes.

The USOC also argued that changing scores after the fact was a violation of the rules of the competition (under which gymnastic scores must be disputed immediately—before the gymnasts move to the next piece of equipment, and certainly before the medals are awarded) and that second-guessing scores set a harmful precedent in that the judges at the event had to make the decisions and nothing would ever be finalized if second-guessing and video review of entire competitions after they ended were permitted. Hamm also pointed out that Yang&#x27;s routine included 4 &#x27;hangs&#x27; instead of the 3 allowed, an error that, if caught, would have resulted in a penalty of .2 points, removing Yang from medal contention.

Others argued that this deduction had not been taken when other gymnasts had exceeded the required number and therefore ought not to apply in this case. Hamm supporters also contended that Hamm had earned the right to be the last gymnast to compete based on his performance on the initial night of the competition and knowing what he needed to earn a gold, silver, or bronze medal, he had adjusted his horizontal bar routine accordingly. If Yang Tae Young had been awarded an additional 0.100 point, Hamm would have been able to adjust his routine to take account of that fact, and might have earned a higher score on the horizontal bar, the final piece of equipment.

Eventually, Bruno Grandi, President of the FIG, stated that the FIG would not change the results of the all-around. However, the FIG sent a letter to Hamm in care of the United States Olympic Committee, stating:

If, (according to you [sic] declarations to the press), you would return your medal to the Korean if the FIG requested it, then such an action would be recognised as the ultimate demonstration of Fair-play by the whole world. The FIG and the IOC would highly appreciate the magnitude of this gesture.

In the letter, Grandi stated that Yang Tae Young was the &quot;true winner&quot; of the competition.

For the complete text, see this link.

The USOC was outraged by the FIG&#x27;s request and refused to deliver the letter. In a response letter to the FIG, the USOC stated:

The USOC views this letter as a blatant and inappropriate attempt on the part of FIG to once again shift responsibility for its own mistakes and instead pressure Mr. Hamm into resolving what has become an embarrassing situation for the Federation. The USOC finds this request to be improper, outrageous and so far beyond the bounds of what is acceptable that it refuses to transmit the letter to Mr. Hamm.

In the letter, the USOC also noted that the International Olympic Committee (&quot;IOC&quot;) and its president, Jacques Rogge, opposed FIG&#x27;s efforts to pressure Hamm in this manner, in direct contradiction to an implication made in the FIG&#x27;s letter.

For the complete text of the USOC&#x27;s response, see this link.

Yang then filed an official appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), seeking to have his score changed and be awarded the gold medal. On September 27, 2004, Hamm and the USOC appeared before the court in Lausanne, Switzerland during a hearing that lasted eleven and one-half hours. Nearly one month later, on October 21, 2004, a three-judge CAS panel announced that the results from the Olympics would remain and that Paul Hamm would get to keep the gold medal. The verdict was final and could not be appealed. (See this link for the complete text of the decision.)

When asked whether or not he still deserved the gold medal by a news reporter, Hamm replied that he &quot;shouldn&#x27;t even be dealing with this.&quot; He later said, &quot;I do understand and feel the disappointment that Yang Tae Young has been subjected to and I hope he understands what I have been through as well.&quot;

===Effects of controversy===
Immediately following the Olympics, General Mills announced which U.S. Olympians would appear on individual boxes of Wheaties cereal: swimmer Michael Phelps, gymnast Carly Patterson, and sprinter Justin Gatlin. Hamm was in talks to appear on a box, but the talks were dropped after the controversy.

===Sullivan Award===
Hamm was the James E. Sullivan Award winner for 2004 as the outstanding amateur athlete in the United States. He was the second gymnast to receive this honor after Kurt Thomas.

===Comeback attempt for 2008 Olympics===
Paul and Morgan Hamm took some time off after the 2004 Olympics to focus on school at Ohio State University. They announced in February 2007 that they would return to competitive gymnastics, starting at the 2007 U.S. Championships, also known as the Visa Championships, after their title sponsor. In March 2008, Paul won the American Cup held in New York City. This was the first time he won this competition and performed with a strong showing.

On May 22, Paul competed on the first day of the 2008 U.S. Championships but was forced to withdraw after day one after injuring his hand. During his routine on the parallel bars, he fractured the fourth metacarpal of his right hand. Orthopedic surgery five days later placed a titanium plate and nine screws in his hand and Paul was not cleared to return to gymnastics until July 3. After sitting out the Olympic Trials, he was named to the 2008 Olympic Team on a provisional basis depending on his recovery. On July 19 he secured his spot on the 2008 team by participating in an intersquad meet and performed in all six events, only slightly modifying his routines to prevent aggravation of his injury.

On July 28, Paul announced his withdrawal from the United States Olympic gymnastics team due to persistent pain in his right hand and a new injury to his left shoulder from his accelerated recovery efforts. He was replaced on the team by Raj Bhavsar. He has indicated that he will permanently retire from the sport.

===Comeback attempt for 2012 Olympics===
Paul Hamm retired from gymnastics and ended his run to make the 2012 Olympic team. Paul stated, &quot;The years of training have taken a toll on my body and training at an Olympic level is no longer sustainable.&quot;

On December 15, 2015, it was announced that Hamm had been inducted into the 2016 class of the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Hamm also competed on the popular Japanese television show, &quot;Sasuke&quot; (in America/UK: &quot;Ninja Warrior&quot;). He and his brother Morgan took part in three tournaments (#14, 15, and 16). Paul made it to the second stage of the 14th competition but missed completing it by inches (he cleared the last obstacle, the &quot;Wall Lifting&quot;, but forgot to hit the red button before time ran out). In the 15th competition, he was unable to pass the First Stage obstacle, the &quot;Warped Wall&quot;. In the 16th competition, he made it to the second stage again but failed on the obstacle known as the &quot;Metal Spin&quot;.

On September 3, 2011, Hamm was accused of assaulting an Ohio taxi driver, damaging that taxi&#x27;s window and refusing to pay his fare. He was arrested, and while in custody threatened the arresting officers. Hamm was charged with assault and two other misdemeanors. On September 9, Hamm was fired from his coaching position at Ohio State.

On Thursday, February 23, 2012, Hamm pleaded no contest to a reduced set of two misdemeanor charges in an Upper Arlington court in suburban Columbus. A misdemeanor assault charge was dismissed.

A magistrate suspended a sentence of 90 days in custody on each count, provided that Hamm completes a year of probation, pay the cab fare, plus court fees, and must sit with a counselor for an alcohol assessment.

<text>Portofino (; ) is a &quot;comune&quot; located in the Metropolitan City of Genoa on the Italian Riviera. The town is clustered around its small harbour, and is known for the colourfully painted buildings that line the shore. Since the late 19th century, Portofino has attracted tourism of the European aristocracy and it is now a resort for the world&#x27;s jet set.

==History==
Pliny the Elder (AD 23 – AD 79) referred to (Port of the Dolphin) as on the Ligurian coast between Genoa and the Gulf of Tigullio.

The village is mentioned in a &quot;diploma&quot; from 986 by Adelaide of Italy, which assigned it to the nearby Abbey of San Fruttuoso di Capodimonte. In 1171, together with the neighbouring Santa Margherita Ligure, it was included in Rapallo&#x27;s commune jurisdiction. After 1229 it was part of the Republic of Genoa. The town&#x27;s natural harbour supported a fleet of fishing boats, but was somewhat too cramped to provide more than a temporary safe haven for the growing merchant marine of the Republic of Genoa.

In 1409, when Charles VI of France was Doge of Genoa, he sold Portofino to the Republic of Florence. When Charles was ousted from Genoa, the Florentines gave it back. In the 15th century it was a fief of families such as the Fieschi, Spinola, Adorno, and Doria.

In 1815, it became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia and, from 1861, of the unified Kingdom of Italy.

In the late 19th century, first British, then other Northern European aristocratic tourists began to visit Portofino, which they reached by horse and cart from Santa Margherita Ligure. Aubrey Herbert and Elizabeth von Arnim were among the more famous English people to make the area fashionable. Eventually, more expatriates built expensive holiday houses, and by 1950, tourism had replaced fishing as the town&#x27;s chief industry, and the waterfront was a continuous ring of restaurants and cafés. 

==Main sights==
* Statue of &quot;Christ of the Abyss&quot;, placed underwater on 29 August 1954 in the inlet at a depth of . This statue was placed to protect fishermen and scuba divers and in memory of Dario Gonzatti, the first Italian to use SCUBA gear, who died in 1947. Sculpted by Guido Galletti, it represents Christ in the act of blessing while looking towards the sky with open arms in a sign of peace.
* Castello Brown (16th century).
* Divo Martino, Portofino (12th century).
* San Giorgio, Portofino, housing some saints&#x27; relics.
* Oratory of &quot;Santa Maria Assunta&quot;, in Gothic style.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;The Enchanted April&quot;, a 1922 best-selling novel by Elizabeth von Arnim based on the author&#x27;s stay in Castello Brown, is credited with making Portofino fashionable. The novel was the basis of a 1991 feature filmed in the Castello, with a cast including Joan Plowright, Miranda Richardson and Alfred Molina. The film was nominated for three Oscars.
*Portofino was visited by Finland Swedish writer Göran Schildt and his ketch Daphne in 1948 on the start of his travels on the Mediterranean Sea.
*Portofino is often thought to be the inspiration for Sir Clough Williams-Ellis&#x27; Italianate village named Portmeirion, built between 1925 and 1975, in north Wales. However, this was repeatedly denied by the architect. He stated only that he wanted to pay tribute to the atmosphere of the Mediterranean. He did, however, draw on a love of the Italian village, stating &quot;How should I not have fallen for Portofino? Indeed its image remained with me as an almost perfect example of the man-made adornment and use of an exquisite site.&quot;
*In 1959, Dalida released the song &quot;Love in Portofino&quot;, written by Leo Chiosso and composed by Fred Buscaglione. With lyrics in French and Italian language, it became a hit and was later iconised alongside the village&#x27;s name. It also spawned several international covers, including Andrea Bocelli&#x27;s in 2013 which was followed by a concert recorded and issued on DVD.
*Portofino is the eponym of Frank Schaeffer&#x27;s &quot;Portofino: A Novel&quot; (1992). It was the first of Schaeffer&#x27;s &quot;Calvin Becker Trilogy&quot;.

*Portofino is one of the shooting locations of the 1995 Antonioni/Wenders film, &quot;Beyond the Clouds&quot;.
*There is a full-scale replica, in authentic detail, of Portofino Bay at Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, United States, which opened in September 1999.
*Portofino inspired in 2001 a recreation of the seaside town in the Mediterranean Harbor area at Tokyo DisneySea in Chiba, Japan. It also served as the namesake for the restaurant Cafe Portofino.
*Portofino was featured in 2008 in the BBC television series &quot;Top Gear&quot;. Richard Hammond, in a Ferrari Daytona raced James May in a carbon fibre powerboat from Portofino to St Tropez in France.
*Ferrari named one of their sports cars the Ferrari Portofino in 2017. In 2018, the Scuderia Ferrari Club Portofino was founded.
*IWC Schaffhausen named one of their watches the IWC Portofino.
*In the 2021 Disney-Pixar animated film &quot;Luca&quot;, the fictional town of Portorosso is based on Portofino, as well as other villages in the Italian Riviera.
*The 2022 six-episode period drama television series &quot;Hotel Portofino&quot;, set in the 1920s, was created by Matt Baker in 2020, filmed principally on location in Portofino in 2021, and is being shown on Britbox, PBS, and other television networks. The show was renewed for a second season.

<text>In differential geometry, a Hodge cycle or Hodge class is a particular kind of homology class defined on a complex algebraic variety &quot;V&quot;, or more generally on a Kähler manifold. A homology class &quot;x&quot; in a homology group

:formula_1

where &quot;V&quot; is a non-singular complex algebraic variety or Kähler manifold is a Hodge cycle, provided it satisfies two conditions. Firstly, &quot;k&quot; is an even integer formula_2, and in the direct sum decomposition of &quot;H&quot; shown to exist in Hodge theory, &quot;x&quot; is purely of type formula_3. Secondly, &quot;x&quot; is a rational class, in the sense that it lies in the image of the abelian group homomorphism

:formula_4

defined in algebraic topology (as a special case of the universal coefficient theorem). The conventional term Hodge &quot;cycle&quot; therefore is slightly inaccurate, in that &quot;x&quot; is considered as a &quot;class&quot; (modulo boundaries); but this is normal usage.

The importance of Hodge cycles lies primarily in the Hodge conjecture, to the effect that Hodge cycles should always be algebraic cycles, for &quot;V&quot; a complete algebraic variety. This is an unsolved problem, one of the Millennium Prize Problems. It is known that being a Hodge cycle is a necessary condition to be an algebraic cycle that is rational, and numerous particular cases of the conjecture are known.

<text>The northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) is an eared seal found along the north Pacific Ocean, the Bering Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk. It is the largest member of the fur seal subfamily (Arctocephalinae) and the only living species in the genus &quot;Callorhinus&quot;. A single fossil species, &quot;Callorhinus gilmorei&quot;, is known from the Pliocene of Japan and western North America.

==Description==
Northern fur seals have extreme sexual dimorphism, with males being 30–40% longer and more than 4.5 times heavier than adult females. The head is foreshortened in both sexes because of the very short, down-curved muzzle, and small nose, which extends slightly beyond the mouth in females and moderately in males. The pelage is thick and luxuriant, with a dense underfur in a creamy color. The underfur is obscured by the longer guard hairs, although it is partially visible when the animals are wet. Features of both fore and hind flippers are unique and diagnostic of the species. Fur is absent on the top of the fore flippers and an abrupt &quot;clean line&quot; is seen across the wrist where the fur ends. The hind flippers are proportionately the longest in any otariid because of extremely long, cartilaginous extensions on all of the toes. Small claws are on digits 2–4, well back from the flap-like end of each digit. The ear pinnae are long and conspicuous, and naked of dark fur at the tips in older animals. The mystacial vibrissae can be very long, and regularly extend beyond the ears. Adults have all white vibrissae, juveniles and subadults have a mixture of white and black vibrissae, including some that have dark bases and white ends, and pups and yearlings have all black vibrissae. The eyes are proportionately large and conspicuous, especially on females, subadults, and juveniles.
Adult males are stocky in build, and have enlarged (thick and wide) necks. A mane of coarse, longer guard hairs extends from the lower neck to the shoulders. and covers the nape, neck, chest, and upper back. While the skulls of adult males are large and robust for their overall size, their heads appear short because of the combination of a short muzzle, and the backs of the head behind the ear pinnae being obscured by the enlarged necks. Adult males have abrupt foreheads formed by the elevation of the crown from development of the sagittal crests, and thicker fur of the mane on the top of their heads.

Canine teeth are much longer and have a greater diameter in adult males than those found on adult females, and this relationship holds to a lesser extent at all ages.
Adult females, subadults, and juveniles are moderate in build. Distinguishing the sexes is difficult until about age five. The body is modest in size and the neck, chest, and shoulders are sized in proportion with the torso. Adult females and subadults have more complex and variable coloration than adult males. They are dark silver-gray to charcoal above. The flanks, chest, sides, and underside of the neck, often forming a chevron pattern in this area, are cream to tan with rusty tones. Variable cream to rust-colored areas are on the sides and top of the muzzle, chin, and as a &quot;brush stroke&quot; running backwards under the eye. In contrast, adult males are medium gray to black, or reddish to dark brown all over. Their manes can have variable amounts of silver-gray or yellowish tinting on the guard hairs. Pups are blackish at birth, with variable oval areas of buff on the sides, in the axillary area, and on the chin and sides of the muzzle. After three to four months, pups molt to the color of adult females and subadults.

Males can be as large as and . Females can be up to and weigh or more. Newborns weigh , and are long.
The teeth are haplodont, i.e. sharp, conical and mostly single-rooted, as is common with carnivorous marine mammals adapted to tearing fish flesh. As with most caniforms, the upper canines are prominent. The dental formula of the adult is 
Like other otariids, northern fur seals are built for efficient terrestrial locomotion. Their hind limbs are in a plantigrade stance and are able to rotate under the body for quadrupedal locomotion and support. When swimming, there are two different types of movement: locomotion and diving. These seals swim primarily with forelimb propulsion due to their physiology. They have flexible joints between vertebrae for better maneuverability in the water as well as &quot;greater muscular leverage&quot; for pectoral strokes. Stroke patterns are different for different dive types and locomotion, and stroke rates vary for individuals since there&#x27;s a relationship between maximum stroke rate and body size.

==Distribution and habitat==

The northern fur seal is found in the north Pacific – its southernmost reach is a line that runs roughly from the southern tip of Japan to the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Bering Sea. An estimated 1.1 million northern fur seals occur across the range, of which roughly half breed on the Pribilof Islands in the east Bering Sea. Another 200–250 thousand breed on the Commander Islands in the west Bering Sea, some 100,000 breed on Tyuleniy Island off the coast of Sakhalin in the southwest Sea of Okhotsk, and another 60–70 thousand in the central Kuril Islands in Russia. Smaller rookeries (around 5,000 animals) are found on Bogoslof Island in the Aleutian Chain, San Miguel Island in the Channel Island group and South Farallon Island off the coast of California. Recent evidence from stable isotope analysis of Holocene fur seal bone collagen (δ13C and δ15N) indicates that before the maritime fur trade, it was more common for these animals to breed at local rookeries in British Columbia, California, and likely along much of the northwest coast of North America.

During the winter, northern fur seals display a net movement southward, with animals from Russian rookeries regularly entering Japanese and Korean waters in the Sea of Japan and Alaskan animals moving along the central and eastern Pacific to British Columbia, Canada and as far south as Baja California.

The northern fur seal&#x27;s range overlaps almost exactly with that of Steller sea lions; occasional cohabitation occurs at reproductive rookeries, notably in the Kurils, the Commander Islands, and Tyulen&#x27;i Islands. The only other fur seal found in the Northern Hemisphere is the Guadalupe fur seal which overlaps slightly with the northern fur seal&#x27;s range in California.

==Ecology==
Fur seals are opportunistic feeders, primarily feeding on pelagic fish and squid depending on local availability. Identified fish prey include hake, herring, lantern fish, capelin, pollock, and mackerel. Their feeding behavior is primarily solitary.

Northern fur seals are preyed upon primarily by sharks and killer whales. Occasionally, very young animals are eaten by Steller sea lions. Occasional predation on live pups by Arctic foxes has also been observed.

Due to very high densities of pups on reproductive rookeries and the early age at which mothers begin their foraging trips, mortality can be relatively high. Consequently, pup carcasses are important in enriching the diet of many scavengers, in particular gulls and Arctic foxes.

In 2017, 14 samples of spiny lice were collected off of the nasal passage of fur seal pups. In 2021, these spiny lice were identified as having unique bristle arrangements, and were given the scientific name &quot;Antarctophthirus nevelskoyi&quot;. They were named after the famous Russian explorer, Admiral Gennady Ivanovich Nevelsky.

==Reproductive behavior==

Seals enter breeding rookeries in May. Generally, older males (10 years and older) return first and compete for prime breeding spots on the rookeries. They remain on the rookery, fasting throughout the duration of the breeding season. The females come somewhat later, and give birth shortly thereafter. Like all other otariids, northern fur seals are polygynous, with some males breeding with up to 50 females in a single breeding season. Unlike Steller sea lions, with which they share habitat and some breeding sites, northern fur seals are possessive of individual females in their harem, often aggressively competing with neighboring males for females. Deaths of females as a consequence of these conflicts have been recorded, though the males themselves are rarely seriously injured. Young males unable to acquire and maintain a territory of a harem typically aggregate in neighboring &quot;haulouts&quot;, occasionally making incursions into the reproductive sections of the rookery in an attempt to displace an older male.
After remaining with their pups for the first eight to ten days of their lives, females begin foraging trips lasting up to a week. These trips last for about four months before weaning, which happens abruptly, typically in October. Most of the animals on a rookery enter the water and disperse towards the end of November, typically migrating southward. Breeding site fidelity is generally high for fur seal females, though young males might disperse to other existing rookeries, or occasionally find new haulouts.

Peak mating occurs somewhat later than peak birthing from late June to late July. As with many other otariids, the fertilized egg undergoes delayed implantation: after the blastocyst stage occurs, development halts and implantation occurs four months after fertilization. In total, gestation lasts around a year, such that the pups born in a given summer are the product of the previous year&#x27;s breeding cycle.

==Status==

Recently, concern about the status of fur seal populations has increased, particularly in the Pribilof Islands, where pup production has decreased about 50% since the 1970s, with a continuing drop of about 6–7% per year. This has caused them to be listed as &quot;vulnerable&quot; on the IUCN Red List, and more specifically, the Pribilof Islands / eastern Pacific stock is listed as &quot;depleted&quot; under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act, though to date the species is not yet listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act). Increasing concern about the species&#x27; status, particularly in the eastern part of its range, has led to an intensified research program into their behavioral and foraging ecology. Possible causes for recent declines and lack of recovery are increased predation by killer whales, competition with fisheries, and climate change effects, but to date, no scientific consensus has been reached. 

===Fur trade===
Northern fur seals have been a staple food of native northeast Asian and Alaska Native peoples for thousands of years. The arrival of Europeans to Kamchatka and Alaska in the 17th and 18th centuries, first from Russia and later from North America, was followed by a highly extractive commercial fur trade. The commercial fur trade was accelerated in 1786, when Gavriil Pribylov discovered St. George Island, a key rookery of the seals. An estimated 2.5 million seals were killed from 1786 to 1867. This trade led to a decline in fur seal numbers. Restrictions were first placed on fur seal harvest on the Pribilof Islands by the Russians in 1834. Shortly after the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, the U.S. Treasury was authorized to lease sealing privileges on the Pribilofs, which were granted somewhat liberally to the Alaska Commercial Company. From 1870 to 1909, pelagic sealing proceeded to take a significant toll on the fur seal population, such that the Pribilof population, historically numbering on the order of millions of individuals, reached a low of 216,000 animals in 1912.

Significant harvest was more or less arrested with the signing of the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911 by Great Britain (on behalf of Canada), Japan, Russia, and the United States. The Convention of 1911 remained in force until the onset of hostilities among the signatories during World War II, and is also notable as the first international treaty to address the conservation of wildlife. A successive convention was signed in 1957 and amended by a protocol in 1963. &quot;The international convention was put into effect domestically by the Fur Seal Act of 1966 (Public Law 89-702)&quot;, said an Interior Department review of the history. Currently, a subsistence hunt by the residents of St. Paul Island and an insignificant harvest in Russia are allowed.

<text>Empire is a British film magazine published monthly by Bauer Media Group. The first issue was published in May 1989.

==History==
David Hepworth of Emap, the publisher of British music magazines &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, among other titles, came up with the idea to publish a magazine similar to &quot;Q&quot;, but for films. They recruited &quot;Smash Hits&quot; editor Barry McIlheney to edit the new magazine, with Hepworth as Editorial Director. Hepworth produced a one-page document of what he wanted to achieve. Among them, they planned to review and rate every film that was released in the cinema in the United Kingdom. It also said that &quot;&quot;Empire&quot; believes that movies can sometimes be art, but they should always be fun.&quot; The first edition (June/July 1989) was published in May 1989 with Dennis Quaid and Winona Ryder on the front cover from the film &quot;Great Balls of Fire!&quot;. The first issue reached its target of 50,000 copies sold.

Film reviews were given a star rating between 1 and 5, with no half-stars.

McIlheney edited the first 44 issues, with assistant editor Phil Thomas, who had been working on the magazine since it started, taking over from the March 1993 issue. Thomas became managing editor in 1995 with &quot;Q&quot; Features Editor Andrew Collins taking over as &quot;Empire&quot; editor from issue 73 (July 1995); however, after 3 issues, he became editor of &quot;Q&quot; after Danny Kelly left, with &quot;Empire&quot; Features Editor Mark Salisbury promoted to Editor.

A compilation of their film reviews was published in 2006 as the &quot;Empire Film Guide&quot;.

==Regular features==

&quot;Empire&quot; reviews both mainstream films and art films, but feature articles concentrate on the former. Ian Freer is a regular reviewer for the magazine.

As well as film news, previews, and reviews, &quot;Empire&quot; has some other regular features. Each issue (with the exception of issues 108–113) features a &quot;Classic Scene&quot;, a transcript from a notable film scene. The first such classic scene to be featured was the &quot;I coulda been a contender&quot; scene from &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;.

The &quot;Re.View&quot; section covers Blu-ray and DVD news and releases. &quot;Kim Newman&#x27;s Movie Dungeon&quot; is a regular feature in the &quot;Re.View&quot; section, in which critic Kim Newman reviews the most obscure releases, mostly low-budget horror movies. Newman has written for &quot;Empire&quot; since the first issue.

&quot;How Much Is A Pint of Milk?&quot; presents celebrities&#x27; answers to silly or unusual questions, including the question &quot;How much is a pint of milk?&quot; This is intended as a guide to the chosen celebrity&#x27;s contact with reality, and as such can be more informative than a direct interview by reporting some surprising responses. Willem Dafoe was the first interviewee in issue 59 (May 1994).

Each magazine includes a &quot;Spine Quote&quot;, in which a relatively challenging quote is printed on the spine of the magazine. There are usually some obvious and obscure links from the quote to the main features of that month&#x27;s edition. Readers are invited to identify the film source and the links to win a prize.

===The Empire Masterpiece===
A regular feature since &quot;Raging Bull&quot; featured in issue 167 (May 2003), the Empire Masterpiece is a two-page essay on a film selected by &quot;Empire&quot; in the &quot;Re.View&quot; section. Only a few issues since the first masterpiece feature have not featured one – 179, 196–198 and 246. Issue 241 (June 2009) had director Frank Darabont select 223 masterpieces. &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; and &quot;Magnolia&quot; have been featured twice.

===Former features===
&quot;Where Are They Now?&quot; featuring past film celebrities and updating on their current professional and personal status first appeared in issue 28 (October 1991) featuring Mark Hamill and John Savage.

&quot;My Movie Mastermind&quot; was another regular in which a celebrity was given questions about the films they were in or directed. Celebrities range from Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Lee (who were at the top of the scoreboard) to John Carpenter and Michael Keaton (who were at the bottom of the scoreboard). The feature first appeared in issue 212 (February 2007) with Terry Gilliam.

==Special editions==
===Genre guides===
In 2001, &quot;Empire&quot; published a series of guides to the best films by genre including science fiction, horror, crime, action, and comedy.

===Fifteenth anniversary===
&quot;Empire&quot; published a special 15th anniversary issue in June 2004 by which time the magazine had reviewed 4,240 theatrical films. Nicole Kidman was named &quot;actress of our lifetime&quot; and Kevin Spacey was named &quot;actor of our lifetime&quot;. A list of the 15 most influential films of the preceding 15 years was featured.

=== Eighteenth anniversary===
As part of its 18th birthday issue published in June 2007 &quot;Empire&quot; published a list of the top 18-rated moments in film. They also selected the 50 greatest films rated with an 18 certificate.

===Readers&#x27; top films===
&quot;Empire&quot; occasionally polls readers to find out what their favourite films are.

A poll of &quot;Empire&quot; readers was published in September 2001 and listed &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) as the greatest movie of all time.

In March 2006, a readers&#x27; poll of The 201 Greatest Movies of All Time had &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; (1994) as the number one choice.

==== The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time ====
The list was selected in September 2008 by over 10,000 &quot;Empire&quot; readers, 150 filmmakers, and 50 film critics. The list was accompanied by many different covers, each of which went on sale. The list was topped by &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972) and the list&#x27;s most represented director was Steven Spielberg, who had eleven films in the top 500.

In July 2014, during their 25th anniversary year, a readers&#x27; poll of The 301 Greatest Movies of All Time was topped by &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980).

==== The 100 Greatest Movies ====
In 2017, &quot;Empire&quot; surveyed five thousand readers to produce a list of the 100 greatest films ever made which was once again topped by &quot;The Godfather&quot;.

In 2021, they combined reader votes with Empire critics &quot;choices&quot; to create a top 100 list topped by &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;.

===Other polls===
====Readers&#x27; top directors====
In June 2005, a poll of 10,000 readers was asked to name the greatest film director of all time. In a list of forty directors, Steven Spielberg was granted the honour of greatest director.

====Readers&#x27; top characters====
A poll of &quot;Empire&quot; readers was conducted in 2008 to create a list of the 100 greatest movie characters, with Tyler Durden from &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999) listed first.

In June 2015, &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s readers named the greatest film characters of all time led by Indiana Jones.

== Podcasts ==
&quot;Empire&quot; launched their first podcast, &quot;The Empire Podcast&quot;, in March 2012. The podcast is released weekly and is hosted by Chris Hewitt, alongside Helen O&#x27;Hara and James Dyer, as well as regularly featuring other &quot;Empire&quot; journalists such as Amon Warmann, Ben Travis and Terri White. The podcasts feature film news, listener questions, interviews, and reviews, as well as regularly having &#x27;Spoiler Specials&#x27; which take an in-depth look at a single film, including plot spoilers. Many of these episodes are included on a separate subscription-only feed that costs £2.99 per month.

In September 2018, &quot;Empire&quot; launched a second podcast focused on television shows, called &quot;The Pilot TV Podcast&quot;. It is hosted by James Dyer, Terri White and Boyd Hilton.

In July 2022, the podcast won in the &quot;Best Live Podcast&quot; category at the British Podcast Awards following a live episode held in Kings Place, London to celebrate the podcast’s 500th episode that included returning favourites of lethal cunning, as well as guests such as Brett Goldstein, Tom Holland and Johnny Knoxville.

==Awards==

<text>Joaquín Blume (; 21 June 1933 – 29 April 1959) was a Spanish gymnast. The son of a German gymnastics instructor established in Barcelona, he belonged to the gymnastics section of FC Barcelona.

He became Spanish gymnastics champion at 15 and he competed in the 1952 Summer Olympics of Helsinki with only 19 years. He went to win eight medals in the 1955 Mediterranean Games and in 1957 he won the European Championship, defeating favourite Yuri Titov. He was a favourite for the 1956 Summer Olympics of Melbourne, until Spain boycotted the games in protest against the presence of the USSR, after their brutal suppression of the Hungarian Revolution.

He was also a favourite in the 1960 Summer Olympics, but he died in a plane crash at the Valdemeca mountains, in Cuenca, on 29 April 1959. The plane was headed for Canarias, where the Spanish gymnastics team were to do a gymnastics exhibition. His wife, also a gymnast and pregnant with their second child, was also a passenger. There were no survivors.

In his honour, the Catalan Gymnastics Federation started in 1969 the Memorial Joaquim Blume tournament, first only of male gymnastics with female competition introduced in 1972. A sculpture in his honour is displayed at the Gardens of Joan Brossa, in Barcelona.

<doc id="898023" wikidata="Q23541018" url="?curid=898023" title="Grivna">
<text>The grivna () was a currency as well as a measure of weight used in Kievan Rus&#x27; and other states in Eastern Europe from the 11th century.

== Name ==
The word &quot;grivna&quot; is derived from from . In Old East Slavic, it had the form , &quot;grivĭna&quot;. In modern East Slavic languages it has such forms: , &quot;grivna&quot;, , &quot;hryvnia&quot;, , &quot;hryŭnia&quot;.

The name of the contemporary currency of Ukraine, &quot;hryvnia&quot;, is derived from the grivna.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

As its etymology implies the word originally meant a necklace or a torque. The reason why it has taken the meaning of a unit of weight is unclear. The grivnas that have been found at various archaeological sites are not necklaces but bullions of precious metals, usually silver. The weight and the shape of grivnas were not uniform, but varied by region. The grivnas of Novgorod and Pskov were thin long round-edged or three-edged ingots, while Kievan grivnas have rather the shape of a prolonged rhombus. The material was either gold or silver, but silver was predominant. Originally the weight of a grivna was close to the Roman or Byzantine pound. The weight of the Kievan grivna was around . The Novgorod grivna had the weight and became the basis for monetary systems in northeastern Rus&#x27;, including the emerging Grand Duchy of Moscow.

Along the &quot;grivna of silver&quot; there were the account &quot;grivna of kuna&quot;. The latter originally signified a certain amount of marten furs (куна &quot;kuna&quot; was the word for &quot;marten&quot; in Church Slavonic). Since the 12th century, the &quot;grivna of kuna&quot; became another unit of weight, but smaller, and signified as well a certain amount of silver coins: 2.5-gram &quot;nogata&quot; (from &quot;naqd&quot; &#x27;money; a coin&#x27;) and &quot;rezan&quot; ( dirham).

:1 grivna of silver (204 g) = 4 grivnas of kuna (51 g) = 80 nogata coins = 100 kunas (marten furs) = 200 rezans = 400–600 vekshas (squirrel furs)

=== Later history ===
Since the 14th century, when coins started to be minted in northeastern Rus&#x27; (firstly in Moscow), the currency system of silver bullions and furs was becoming obsolete. The grivna became to mean not a weight but rather a particular number of silver coins called then &quot;denga&quot;. At the same time as early as the 13th century the word ruble (&quot;rubl″&quot;) started to be used alongside the word grivna to mean a certain amount of either silver or silver coins. Thus one account ruble was equal to 216 denga coins (each weighted about 0.8 gram). The &quot;grivna of kuna&quot; became simply grivna and was equal to 14 dengas. Thus one ruble was equal to 15 new grivnas and 6 denga coins.

The weight of a denga coin in Moscow and Novgorod was different. In the 15th century, the Moscow denga fell as low as 0.4 gram, while the Novgorod denga remained the same. When in Moscow one ruble had been revalued to 200 denga coins, the exchange rate between Moscow and Novgorod denga coins was set to 2 to 1. Thus since the later 15th – the early 16th centuries one account ruble was equal to 100 Novgorod dengas (later known as &quot;kopeks&quot;) or to 200 Moscow dengas. In this system one grivna was equal to 10 kopeks or 20 dengas.

This last meaning survived into the 18th to 20th centuries when one &quot;grivennik&quot; or &quot;grivenka&quot; meant a 10-kopek coin.

== Weight ==
The grivna as a silver bullion currency did not survive, but its meaning as a unit of weight became predominant. In 15th–17th centuries there were two weight grivnas (or &quot;grivenkas&quot;): the &quot;lesser grivna&quot; of and the &quot;greater grivna&quot; of . Since the middle of the 17th century the latter became known as the Russian pound (Фунт, &quot;funt&quot;). 40 Russian pounds or 80 lesser grivnas (grivenkas) are equal to one pood.

<text>António Manuel de Carvalho Ferreira Vitorino (born 12 January 1957) is a Portuguese lawyer and politician of the Socialist Party (PS).

==Career==
===Career in national politics===
Vitorino graduated in law from the University of Lisbon. A lawyer by training, he was first elected to the Assembly of the Republic (Portugal), the national parliament, in the 1980 elections. In 1983, he served as Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs, a junior minister role in the grand coalition government led by Prime Minister Mário Soares. After the government&#x27;s defeat in the 1985 elections, Vitorino became a deputy secretary for the Governor of Macau.

In 1989, Vitorino returned to Lisbon to become a judge of the Constitutional Court, ending his term in 1994.

In 1995, Vitorino became Minister for National Defence and Deputy Prime Minister in the first government of António Guterres. He resigned in 1997 for being suspected of tax evasion.

===Member of the European Commission, 1998–2004===

After being cleared of the charges, Vitorino was appointed European Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, during the commission led by President Romano Prodi. As a representative of the European Commission, he took part in the conversations that drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the Convention on the Future of Europe. At the convention, he chaired a reflection group on the European Court of Justice.

When Guterres ruled himself out of the contest for the role of President of the European Commission in June 2004, he instead threw his support behind Vitorino. The post eventually went to José Manuel Barroso. José Sócrates become the new leader of the party instead of Vitorino, going on to win a majority in the 2005 general election.

===Career in the private sector===
In 2005, Vitorino became a partner at Cuatrecasas, Gonçalves Pereira &amp; Associados, one of the most influential law firms in the Iberian Peninsula. Between 2006 and 2007, he served as member of the Amato Group, a group of high-level European politicians unofficially working on rewriting the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe into what became known as the Treaty of Lisbon following its rejection by French and Dutch voters.

From November 2008 until June 2009, Vitorino served as member of a six-member panel of EU experts advising the Bulgarian government. Set up by Bulgaria&#x27;s Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev, the advisory board was chaired by Dominique de Villepin and mandated to recommend ways to help the country adjust to EU membership.

Vitorino was the President of Notre Europe, the European think tank founded by Jacques Delors, from 2011 until 2016. From December 2011 until May 2012, he served as member of the institute&#x27;s Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa group, a high-level expert group to reflect on the reform of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union.

Vitorino also had an ongoing role as commentator for RTP 1&#x27;s programme &quot;Notas Soltas&quot; hosted by television journalist .

In 2017 Vitorino was part of the advisory boards of the &quot;International Migration Initiative&quot; (Open Society Foundations) and the &quot;Transatlantic Council on Migration&quot; (Migration Policy Institute).

===International Organization for Migration, 2018–2023===
In December 2017, the Portuguese government under the leadership of Prime Minister António Costa put forward Vitorino for the post of Director General of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), as successor of William Lacy Swing. On 29 June 2018, the member states of IOM elected Vitorino as Director General, effective October 2018. He was chosen over American Ken Isaacs, who was eliminated in early voting rounds, and by acclamation over the runner-up, Laura Thompson of Costa Rica. When seeking a second term, he opted to step down after the first round of voting. Amy Pope of the United States subsequently became the first woman to be elected as Director General.

The club was promoted to the Cymru Premier for the first time in 2004, and play at The Hollingsworth Group Stadium (previously known as The Airfield), Broughton (capacity 1,600, of which 500 are seated); however as their pitch could not be brought up to Cymru Premier standards in time following their promotion, for their first two games they shared Conwy United&#x27;s ground. The Airfield features three unusual retracting floodlights as it is adjacent to an operational runway. In 2014, the grass surface was replaced with a 3G synthetic pitch. At the end of the 2016–17 season the club were relegated to the Cymru Alliance having finished bottom of the league.

In the 2022–23 season, the club finished with -4 points after being deducted 6 points and losing all but two matches. As a result, they were relegated back to the Cymru North after having been promoted in the 2021–22 season.

==History==
Formed in 1946, the club has known several different names as the ownership of the factory has changed over the years. Originally called Vickers-Armstrong, it has variously been named de Havillands, Hawker Siddeley, British Aerospace, and BAE Systems.

The club&#x27;s early years were spent in the Chester &amp; District League and the Wrexham area leagues. The club won the Welsh National League (Wrexham Area) Division Two title during the 1991–92 season, when they won 28 of their 34 matches and scored 130 goals to finish 19 points ahead of their nearest rival. They then spent four years making steady improvements in their position in the Welsh National League (Wrexham Area) Division One before being promoted to the Welsh National League Premier Division at the end of the 1995–96 season when they were runners-up in Division One. They spent four years in the Premier Division before winning promotion to the Cymru Alliance at the end of the 1999–00 season, when they won 21 of their 30 matches. To coincide with this promotion the club changed its name to Airbus UK.

Once again they spent four seasons in their new league, successively finishing in 11th, 8th, and 5th positions before winning the league title by 19 points in 2003–04 to earn promotion to the top level of Welsh domestic football for the first time.

Airbus&#x27; first season in the Premier League was a torrid time, with the team acquiring only 21 points in the first 32 matches and being in next-to-last position with only a few matches remaining. Their manager, Rob Lythe, who had led them to promotion, resigned in February 2005, citing &quot;not having enough time&quot; to do the job. The Wingmakers eventually avoided relegation in their debut season after a victory over local rivals Connah&#x27;s Quay Nomads and a 1–0 defeat at Caersws on the last day.

Airbus made a promising start to their second season in the WPL, reaching the semi-final of the League Cup eventually losing out to TNS Llansantffraid over two legs.

For the start of the 2007–08 season, the club changed its name once more, adding the village name to become &quot;Airbus UK Broughton F.C.&quot;. Owing to UEFA&#x27;s rules over sponsorship, when competing in European competition the club is known as &quot;AUK Broughton&quot;.

During their time in the Cymru Premier, Airbus UK Broughton went from relegation strugglers to a club that challenged regularly for honours. They qualified for Europe for the first time in 2013 as Cymru Premier runners-up, repeating the feat the following season and appearing in the Europa League for a third consecutive time as third-place finishers in 2015.

In May 2016 the club reached the Welsh Cup final for the first time, losing 2–0 to The New Saints at Wrexham&#x27;s Racecourse Ground. They just failed to qualify for Europe again, losing 1–0 in the Play-off final to neighbours Gap Connah&#x27;s Quay. 
A difficult summer saw the majority of players recruited by other Welsh Premier clubs and director of football Andy Preece leaving the club by mutual consent three days before the start of the next campaign, to be replaced by former player Andrew Thomas.

The 2016–17 season produced only five wins and saw first round exits from both the League Cup and Welsh Cup, ending with the Wingmakers finishing in bottom place and being relegated back to the Cymru Alliance ending 13 seasons in the Welsh top flight. In the 2018-19 season, Airbus won the Cymru Alliance title for a second time after a 4-0 victory over Holywell Town and won promotion back to the Cymru Premier as well as completing a double by defeating Holyhead Hotspur 5-1 in the League Cup final.

<doc id="898044" wikidata="Q1163234" url="?curid=898044" title="Medieval Latin">
<text>Medieval Latin was the form of Literary Latin used in Roman Catholic Western Europe during the Middle Ages. It was also the administrative language in the former Roman Provinces of Mauretania, Numidia and Africa Proconsularis under the Vandals, the Byzantines and the Romano-Berber Kingdoms, until it declined after the Arab Conquest. Medieval Latin in Southern and Central Visigothic Hispania, conquered by the Arabs immediately after North Africa, experienced a similar fate, only recovering its importance after the Reconquista by the Northern Christian Kingdoms. In this region it served as the primary written language, though local languages were also written to varying degrees. Latin functioned as the main medium of scholarly exchange, as the liturgical language of the Church, and as the working language of science, literature, law, and administration.

Medieval Latin represented a continuation of Classical Latin and Late Latin, with enhancements for new concepts as well as for the increasing integration of Christianity. Despite some meaningful differences from Classical Latin, its writers did not regard it as a fundamentally different language. There is no real consensus on the exact boundary where Late Latin ends and Medieval Latin begins. Some scholarly surveys begin with the rise of early Ecclesiastical Latin in the middle of the 4th century, others around 500, and still others with the replacement of written Late Latin by written Romance languages starting around the year 900.

The terms &quot;Medieval Latin&quot; and &quot;Ecclesiastical Latin&quot; are sometimes used synonymously, though some scholars draw distinctions. &quot;Ecclesiastical Latin&quot; refers specifically to the form that has been used by the Roman Catholic Church (even before the Middle Ages in Antiquity), whereas &quot;Medieval Latin&quot; refers to all of the (written) forms of Latin used in the Middle Ages.
The Romance languages spoken in the Middle Ages were often referred to as &quot;Latin&quot;, since the Romance languages were all descended from Vulgar Latin itself. Medieval Latin would be replaced by educated humanist Renaissance Latin, otherwise known as Neo-Latin.

==Influences==

===Christian Latin===
Medieval Latin had an enlarged vocabulary, which freely borrowed from other sources. It was heavily influenced by the language of the Vulgate, which contained many peculiarities alien to Classical Latin that resulted from a more or less direct translation from Greek and Hebrew; the peculiarities mirrored the original not only in its vocabulary but also in its grammar and syntax. Greek provided much of the technical vocabulary of Christianity. The various Germanic languages spoken by the Germanic tribes, who invaded southern Europe, were also major sources of new words. Germanic leaders became the rulers of parts of the Roman Empire that they conquered, and words from their languages were freely imported into the vocabulary of law. Other more ordinary words were replaced by coinages from Vulgar Latin or Germanic sources because the classical words had fallen into disuse.

Latin was also spread to areas such as Ireland and Germany, where Romance languages were not spoken, and which had never known Roman rule. Works written in those lands where Latin was a learned language, having no relation to the local vernacular, also influenced the vocabulary and syntax of Medieval Latin.

Since subjects like science and philosophy, including Rhetoric and Ethics, were communicated in Latin, the Latin vocabulary that developed for them became the source of a great many technical words in modern languages. English words like &quot;abstract&quot;, &quot;subject&quot;, &quot;communicate&quot;, &quot;matter&quot;, &quot;probable&quot; and their cognates in other European languages generally have the meanings given to them in Medieval Latin, often terms for abstract concepts not available in English.

===Vulgar Latin===
The influence of Vulgar Latin was also apparent in the syntax of some Medieval Latin writers, although Classical Latin continued to be held in high esteem and studied as models for literary compositions. The high point of the development of Medieval Latin as a literary language came with the Carolingian Renaissance, a rebirth of learning kindled under the patronage of Charlemagne, king of the Franks. Alcuin was Charlemagne&#x27;s Latin secretary and an important writer in his own right; his influence led to a rebirth of Latin literature and learning after the depressed period following the final disintegration of the authority of the Western Roman Empire.

Although it was simultaneously developing into the Romance languages, Latin itself remained very conservative, as it was no longer a native language and there were many ancient and medieval grammar books to give one standard form. On the other hand, strictly speaking there was no single form of &quot;Medieval Latin&quot;. Every Latin author in the medieval period spoke Latin as a second language, with varying degrees of fluency and syntax. Grammar and vocabulary, however, were often influenced by an author&#x27;s native language. This was especially true beginning around the 12th century, after which the language became increasingly adulterated: late Medieval Latin documents written by French speakers tend to show similarities to medieval French grammar and vocabulary; those written by Germans tend to show similarities to German, etc. For instance, rather than following the classical Latin practice of generally placing the verb at the end, medieval writers would often follow the conventions of their own native language instead. Whereas Latin had no definite or indefinite articles, medieval writers sometimes used forms of &quot;unus&quot; as an indefinite article, and forms of &quot;ille&quot; (reflecting usage in the Romance languages) as a definite article or even &quot;quidam&quot; (meaning &quot;a certain one/thing&quot; in Classical Latin) as something like an article. Unlike classical Latin, where &quot;esse&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;) was the only auxiliary verb, Medieval Latin writers might use &quot;habere&quot; (&quot;to have&quot;) as an auxiliary, similar to constructions in Germanic and Romance languages. The accusative and infinitive construction in classical Latin was often replaced by a subordinate clause introduced by &quot;quod&quot; or &quot;quia&quot;. This is almost identical, for example, to the use of &quot;que&quot; in similar constructions in French. Many of these developments are similar to Standard Average European and the use of medieval Latin among the learned elites of Christendom may have played a role in the spread of those features.

In every age from the late 8th century onwards, there were learned writers (especially within the Church) who were familiar enough with classical syntax to be aware that these forms and usages were &quot;wrong&quot; and resisted their use. Thus the Latin of a theologian like St Thomas Aquinas or of an erudite clerical historian such as William of Tyre tends to avoid most of the characteristics described above, showing its period in vocabulary and spelling alone; the features listed are much more prominent in the language of lawyers (e.g. the 11th-century English Domesday Book), physicians, technical writers and secular chroniclers. However the use of &quot;quod&quot; to introduce subordinate clauses was especially pervasive and is found at all levels.

==Changes in vocabulary, syntax, and grammar==

Medieval Latin had ceased to be a living language and was instead a scholarly language of the minority of educated men (and a tiny number of women) in medieval Europe, used in official documents more than for everyday communication. This resulted in two major features of Medieval Latin compared with Classical Latin, though when it is compared to the other vernacular languages, Medieval Latin developed very few changes. There are many prose constructions written by authors of this period that can be considered &quot;showing off&quot; a knowledge of Classical or Old Latin by the use of rare or archaic forms and sequences. Though they had not existed together historically, it is common that an author would use grammatical ideas of the two periods Republican and archaic, placing them equally in the same sentence. Also, many undistinguished scholars had limited education in &quot;proper&quot; Latin, or had been influenced in their writings by Vulgar Latin.

*Word order usually tended towards that of the vernacular language of the author, not the word order of Classical Latin. Conversely, an erudite scholar might attempt to &quot;show off&quot; by intentionally constructing a very complicated sentence. Because Latin is an inflected language, it is technically possible to place related words at opposite ends of a paragraph-long sentence, and owing to the complexity of doing so, it was seen by some as a sign of great skill. The preferred word order in Latin is Subject-Object-Verb; most vernaculars of medieval Latin authors tend to or mandate Subject-Verb-Object which thus is more prevalent in medieval than in classical Latin.
*Typically, prepositions are used much more frequently (as in modern Romance languages) for greater clarity, instead of using the ablative case alone. Furthermore, in Classical Latin the subject of a verb was often left implied, unless it was being stressed: = &quot;he sees&quot;. For clarity, Medieval Latin more frequently includes an explicit subject: = &quot;he sees&quot; without necessarily stressing the subject. Classical Latin is a pro-drop language whereas most Germanic (including standard English) and some Romance languages are not.
*Various changes occurred in vocabulary, and certain words were mixed into different declensions or conjugations. Many new compound verbs were formed. Some words retained their original structure but drastically changed in meaning: specifically means &quot;wrath&quot; in Medieval Latin while in Classical Latin, it generally referred to &quot;high spirits, excited spirits&quot; of any kind.
*Owing to heavy use of biblical terms, there was a large influx of new words borrowed from Greek and Hebrew and even some grammatical influences. That obviously largely occurred among priests and scholars, not the laity. In general, it is difficult to express abstract concepts in Latin, as many scholars admitted. For example, Plato&#x27;s abstract concept of &quot;the Truth&quot; had to be expressed in Latin as &quot;what is always true&quot;. Medieval scholars and theologians, translating both the Bible and Greek philosophers into Latin out of the Koine and Classical Greek, cobbled together many new abstract concept words in Latin.

===Syntax===
*Indirect discourse, which in Classical Latin was achieved by using a subject accusative and infinitive, was now often simply replaced by new conjunctions serving the function of English &quot;that&quot; such as , , or . There was a high level of overlap between the old and new constructions, even within the same author&#x27;s work, and it was often a matter of preference. A particularly famous and often cited example is from the Venerable Bede, using both constructions within the same sentence: &quot;&quot; = &quot;I say that I know [accusative and infinitive] and that I am unknown [new construction]&quot;. The resulting subordinate clause often used the subjunctive mood instead of the indicative. This new syntax for indirect discourse is among the most prominent features of Medieval Latin, the largest syntactical change. However, such use of or also occurred in the Latin of the late Roman Empire, e.g. the Vulgate&#x27;s Matthew 2:22: &quot;Audiens autem quod Archelaus regnaret in Judaea pro Herode...&quot; = &quot;But hearing that Archelaus reigned in Judaea in Herod&#x27;s place...&quot;
*Several substitutions were often used instead of subjunctive clause constructions. They did not break the rules of Classical Latin but were an alternative way to express the same meaning, avoiding the use of a subjunctive clause.
**The present participle was frequently used adverbially in place of or clauses, such as clauses of time, cause, concession, and purpose. That was loosely similar to the use of the present participle in an ablative absolute phrase, but the participle did not need to be in the ablative case.
** (I have [to]) and (I must) would be used to express obligation more often than the gerundive.
***Given that obligation inherently carries a sense of futurity (&quot;Carthage must be destroyed&quot; at some point in the future), this parallels the Romance languages&#x27; use of as the basis of their future tenses (abandoning the Latin forms of the future tense). While in Latin is the indirect discourse &quot;I have to love&quot;, in the French equivalent, ( &gt; &gt; , ), it has become the future tense, &quot;I shall love&quot;, losing the sense of obligation. In Medieval Latin, however, it was only indirect discourse and not used as simply a future tense.
**Instead of a clause introduced by or , an infinitive was often used with a verb of hoping, fearing, promising, etc.
*Conversely, some authors might haphazardly switch between the subjunctive and indicative forms of verbs, with no intended difference in meaning.
*The usage of changed significantly: it was frequently omitted or implied. Further, many medieval authors did not feel that it made sense for the perfect passive construction &quot;&quot; to use the present tense of in a past tense construction so they began using , the past perfect of , interchangeably with .
*Chaos in the usage of demonstrative pronouns. , , , and even the intensive are often used virtually interchangeably. As in the Romance languages, and were also frequently used simply to express the definite article &quot;the&quot;, which Classical Latin did not possess. was also used for the indefinite article &quot;a, an&quot;.
*Use of reflexives became much looser. A reflexive pronoun in a subordinate clause might refer to the subject of the main clause. The reflexive possessive might be used in place of a possessive genitive such as .
*Comparison of adjectives changed somewhat. The comparative form was sometimes used with positive or superlative meaning. Also, the adverb was often used with a positive adjective to indicate a comparative meaning, and and could be used with a positive form of adjective to give a superlative meaning.
*Classical Latin used the ablative absolute, but as stated above, in Medieval Latin examples of nominative absolute or accusative absolute may be found. This was a point of difference between the ecclesiastical Latin of the clergy and the &quot;Vulgar Latin&quot; of the laity, which existed alongside it. The educated clergy mostly knew that traditional Latin did not use the nominative or accusative case in such constructions, but only the ablative case. These constructions are observed in the medieval era, but they are changes that developed among the uneducated commoners.
*Classical Latin does not distinguish progressive action in the present tense, thus can mean either &quot;I praise&quot; or &quot;I am praising&quot;. In imitation of Greek, Medieval Latin could use a present participle with to form a periphrastic tense equivalent to the English progressive. This &quot;Greek Periphrastic Tense&quot; formation could also be done in the past and future tenses: (&quot;I am praising&quot;), (&quot;I was praising&quot;), (&quot;I shall be praising&quot;).
*Classical Latin verbs had at most two voices, active and passive, but Greek (the original language of the New Testament) had an additional &quot;middle voice&quot; (or reflexive voice). One use was to express when the subject is acting upon itself: &quot;Achilles put the armor onto himself&quot; or &quot;Jesus clothed himself in the robe&quot; would use the middle voice. Because Latin had no middle voice, Medieval Latin expresses such sentences by putting the verb in the passive voice form, but the conceptual meaning is active (similar to Latin deponent verbs). For example, the Medieval Latin translation of Genesis states literally, &quot;the Spirit of God was moved over the waters&quot; (, Genesis 1:2), but it is just expressing a Greek middle-voice verb: &quot;God moved &quot;[himself]&quot; over the waters&quot;.
*Overlapping with orthography differences (see below), certain diphthongs were sometimes shortened: &quot;oe&quot; to &quot;e&quot;, and &quot;ae&quot; to &quot;e&quot;. Thus, becomes the more familiar (more familiar in this later form because religious terms such as &quot;ecumenical&quot; were more common in Medieval Latin). The &quot;oe&quot; diphthong is not particularly frequent in Latin, but the shift from &quot;ae&quot; to &quot;e&quot; affects many common words, such as (heaven) being shortened to ; even (girls) was shortened to .
*Often, a town would lose its name to that of the tribe which was either accusative or ablative plural; two forms that were then used for all cases, or in other words, considered &quot;indeclinable&quot;.
==Orthography==
Many striking differences between classical and Medieval Latin are found in orthography. Perhaps the most striking difference is that medieval manuscripts used a wide range of abbreviations by means of superscripts, special characters etc.: for instance the letters &quot;n&quot; and &quot;s&quot; were often omitted and replaced by a diacritical mark above the preceding or following letter. Apart from this, some of the most frequently occurring differences are as follows. Clearly many of these would have been influenced by the spelling, and indeed pronunciation, of the vernacular language, and thus varied between different European countries.

*Following the Carolingian reforms of the 9th century, Carolingian minuscule was widely adopted, leading to a clear differentiation between capital and lowercase letters.
*A partial or full differentiation between &quot;v&quot; and &quot;u&quot;, and between &quot;j&quot; and &quot;i&quot;.
*The diphthong &quot;ae&quot; is usually collapsed and simply written as &quot;e&quot; (or &quot;e caudata&quot;, &quot;ę&quot;); for example, &quot;puellae&quot; might be written &quot;puelle&quot; (or &quot;puellę&quot;). The same happens with the diphthong &quot;oe&quot;, for example in &quot;pena&quot;, &quot;Edipus&quot;, from &quot;poena&quot;, &quot;Oedipus&quot;. This feature is already found on coin inscriptions of the 4th century (e.g. &quot;&quot; for &quot;reipublicae&quot;). Conversely, an original &quot;e&quot; in Classical Latin was often represented by &quot;ae&quot; or &quot;oe&quot; (e.g. &quot;aecclesia&quot; and &quot;coena&quot;), also reflected in English spellings such as &quot;foetus&quot;.
*Because of a severe decline in the knowledge of Greek, in loanwords and foreign names from or transmitted through Greek, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;i&quot; might be used more or less interchangeably: &quot;Ysidorus&quot;, &quot;Egiptus&quot;, from &quot;Isidorus&quot;, &quot;Aegyptus&quot;. This is also found in pure Latin words: &quot;ocius&quot; (&quot;more swiftly&quot;) appears as &quot;&quot; and &quot;silva&quot; as &quot;sylva&quot;, this last being a form which survived into the 18th century and so became embedded in modern botanical Latin (also cf. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;).
*&quot;h&quot; might be lost, so that &quot;habere&quot; becomes &quot;abere&quot;, or &quot;mihi&quot; becomes &quot;mi&quot; (the latter also occurred in Classical Latin); or &quot;mihi&quot; may be written &quot;michi&quot;, indicating that the &quot;h&quot; had come to be pronounced as or perhaps . This pronunciation is not found in Classical Latin, but had existed very early in vulgar speech.
*The loss of &quot;h&quot; in pronunciation also led to the addition of &quot;h&quot; in writing where it did not previously belong, especially in the vicinity of &quot;r&quot;, such as &quot;chorona&quot; for &quot;corona&quot;, a tendency also sometimes seen in Classical Latin.
*&quot;-ti-&quot; before a vowel is often written as &quot;-ci-&quot; [tsi], so that &quot;divitiae&quot; becomes &#x27; (or &#x27;), &quot;tertius&quot; becomes &#x27;, &quot;vitium&quot; &#x27;.
*The combination &quot;mn&quot; might have another plosive inserted, so that &quot;alumnus&quot; becomes &#x27;, &quot;somnus&quot; &#x27;.
*Single consonants were often doubled, or vice versa, so that &quot;tranquillitas&quot; becomes &quot;&quot; and &quot;Africa&quot; becomes &quot;Affrica&quot;.
*Syncopation became more frequent: &quot;vi&quot;, especially in verbs in the perfect tense, might be lost, so that &quot;novisse&quot; becomes &quot;nosse&quot; (this occurred in Classical Latin as well but was much more frequent in Medieval Latin).

These orthographical differences were often due to changes in pronunciation or, as in the previous example, morphology, which authors reflected in their writing. By the 16th century, Erasmus complained that speakers from different countries were unable to understand each other&#x27;s form of Latin.

The gradual changes in Latin did not escape the notice of contemporaries. Petrarch, writing in the 14th century, complained about this linguistic &quot;decline&quot;, which helped fuel his general dissatisfaction with his own era.

==Medieval Latin literature==
The corpus of Medieval Latin literature encompasses a wide range of texts, including such diverse works as sermons, hymns, hagiographical texts, travel literature, histories, epics, and lyric poetry.

The first half of the 5th century saw the literary activities of the great Christian authors Jerome (–420) and Augustine of Hippo (354–430), whose texts had an enormous influence on theological thought of the Middle Ages, and of the latter&#x27;s disciple Prosper of Aquitaine (). Of the later 5th century and early 6th century, Sidonius Apollinaris ( – after 489) and Ennodius (474–521), both from Gaul, are well known for their poems, as is Venantius Fortunatus (). This was also a period of transmission: the Roman patrician Boethius (–524) translated part of Aristotle&#x27;s logical corpus, thus preserving it for the Latin West, and wrote the influential literary and philosophical treatise ; Cassiodorus () founded an important library at the monastery of Vivarium near Squillace where many texts from Antiquity were to be preserved. Isidore of Seville (–636) collected all scientific knowledge still available in his time into what might be called the first encyclopedia, the &quot;Etymologiae&quot;.

Gregory of Tours (–594) wrote a lengthy history of the Frankish kings. Gregory came from a Gallo-Roman aristocratic family, and his Latin, which shows many aberrations from the classical forms, testifies to the declining significance of classical education in Gaul. At the same time, good knowledge of Latin and even of Greek was being preserved in monastic culture in Ireland and was brought to England and the European mainland by missionaries in the course of the 6th and 7th centuries, such as Columbanus (543–615), who founded the monastery of Bobbio in Northern Italy. Ireland was also the birthplace of a strange poetic style known as Hisperic Latin. Other important Insular authors include the historian Gildas () and the poet Aldhelm (–709). Benedict Biscop (–690) founded the monastery of Wearmouth-Jarrow and furnished it with books which he had taken home from a journey to Rome and which were later used by Bede (–735) to write his &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;.

Many Medieval Latin works have been published in the series Patrologia Latina, Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum and Corpus Christianorum.

== Medieval Latin and everyday life ==
Medieval Latin was separated from Classical Latin around 800 and at this time was no longer considered part of the everyday language. The speaking of Latin became a practice used mostly by the educated high class population. Even then it was not frequently used in casual conversation. An example of these men includes the churchmen who could read Latin, but could not effectively speak it. Latin&#x27;s use in universities was structured in lectures and debates, however, it was highly recommended that students use it in conversation. This practice was kept up only due to rules. One of Latin&#x27;s purposes, writing, was still in practice; the main uses being charters for property transactions and to keep track of the pleadings given in court. Even then, those of the church still used Latin more than the rest of the population. At this time, Latin served little purpose to the regular population but was still used regularly in ecclesiastical culture. Latin also served as a lingua franca among the educated elites of Christendom — long distance written communication, while rarer than in Antiquity, took place mostly in Latin. Most literate people wrote Latin and most rich people had access to scribes who knew Latin for use when the need for long distance correspondence arose. Long-distance communication in the vernacular was rare, but Hebrew, Arabic and Greek served a similar purpose among Jews, Muslims and Eastern Orthodox respectively.

<text>Friedrichshain () is a quarter (&quot;Ortsteil&quot;) of the borough of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg in Berlin, Germany. From its creation in 1920 until 2001, it was a freestanding city borough. Formerly part of East Berlin, it is adjacent to Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg, Kreuzberg and Lichtenberg.

Friedrichshain is named after the &quot;Volkspark Friedrichshain&quot;, a vast green park at the northern border with Prenzlauer Berg. In the Nazi era, the borough was called &quot;Horst-Wessel-Stadt&quot;. Friedrichshain is one of the trendy districts of Berlin and has experienced gentrification.

==Geography==
Friedrichshain is defined by the following roads and places, starting clock-wise in the west: Lichtenberger Straße, Mollstraße, Otto-Braun-Straße, Am Friedrichshain, Virchowstraße, Margarete-Sommer-Straße, Danziger Straße, Landsberger Allee, Hausburgstraße, Thaerstraße, Eldenaer Straße, S-Bahn-Trasse, Kynaststraße, Stralauer Halbinsel, Spree.

==History==

The largely working-class district was created in 1920 when Greater Berlin was established by referendum, incorporating several surrounding settlements. Friedrichshain united the Frankfurter Vorstadt, already part of Berlin, and the villages of Boxhagen and Stralau. It took its name (meaning &#x27;Frederick&#x27;s Grove&#x27;) from the &quot;Volkspark&quot; (&#x27;People&#x27;s Park&#x27;), which was planned in 1840 to commemorate the centenary of Frederick the Great&#x27;s coronation. Much of the district was settled in the rapid industrialization of the 19th and early 20th centuries, led by growth in manufacturing and crafts. It owed much to the opening of the railway line between Berlin and Frankfurt (Oder) in 1846 (which terminated near the site of today&#x27;s Berlin Ostbahnhof), and the opening of the first waterworks in 1865 at Stralauer Tor. In 1874 the &quot;Krankenhaus im Friedrichshain&quot; was opened, Berlin&#x27;s first hospital beside the university clinic Charité. In the early 1900s, the district&#x27;s largest employer was the Knorr-Bremse brake factory; the Knorrpromenade, one of Friedrichshain&#x27;s most attractive streets, was built to house the management. The street network of Friedrichhain was originally specified in the Hobrecht-Plan and the area was part of what came to be known architecturally as the Wilhelmine Ring.

When the Nazis came to power in 1933, the district was renamed Horst-Wessel-Stadt after the Nazi activist and writer of the Nazi hymn whose slow death, after being shot by communists, in Friedrichshain hospital in 1930 was turned into a propaganda event by Joseph Goebbels.

During World War II Friedrichshain was one of the most badly damaged parts of Berlin, as Allied strategic bombers specifically targeted its industries. As late as the nineties, some buildings still displayed bullet holes from the intense house to house fighting during the Battle of Berlin. After the war ended, the boundary between the US and Soviet occupation sectors ran between Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg, with Friedrichshain in the east and Kreuzberg in the west. This became a sealed border between East and West Berlin when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961.

Stalinallee (previously Große Frankfurter Straße) was built in Friedrichshain in the late 1940s and early 1950s as a prestige project; the architecture of its &#x27;workers&#x27; palaces&#x27; is strongly reminiscent of the ostentatious Soviet-era Moscow boulevards and is sometimes mockingly described as &quot;Zuckerbäckerstil&quot; (&#x27;wedding cake style&#x27;). The 1953 uprising had its origins in these construction projects, as increased work quotas led to protests that soon spread throughout East Germany, and were only put down by armed Soviet intervention.

In the period of De-Stalinization following the Soviet leader&#x27;s death, the boulevard was renamed Karl-Marx-Allee at one end and Frankfurter Allee at the other. From this time onwards, Friedrichshain often featured on East Berlin&#x27;s cultural map: in 1962 the &quot;Kosmos&quot;, East Germany&#x27;s largest cinema, was opened, followed in 1981 by the country&#x27;s most ambitious swimming and sports complex, the &quot;Sport- und Erholungszentrum&quot;. Neither of these buildings serve their original function today.

== Lifestyle ==
In the course of the changes following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, the free elections in March 1990 and leading up to German reunification the following October, Friedrichshain began to develop a reputation as a young, dynamic district, thanks in part to low rents and the many empty apartments that also attracted the attention of squatters including many from former West Berlin. On 14 November that year, Friedrichshain experienced violent clashes when hundreds of squatters were forcefully evicted from houses in &quot;Mainzer Straße&quot; by police acting on the orders of the Senate of the recently united city, an act which would trigger the fall of the governing coalition when the Green Party withdrew in protest. In the following years further squatters were evicted under the hardline conservative Senator for the Interior, but others were able to buy the houses they lived in, and they remain a distinct counter-cultural influence in the district to this day. The fight against eviction remains a daily struggle for the last squats still standing: in October 2020, the anarco-queer-feminist squat Liebig34 on Liebigstrasse was evicted.

Alongside the neighbouring districts of Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg, and Kreuzberg, Friedrichshain is now considered one of Berlin&#x27;s most fashionable areas, and is home to numerous design and media companies. It is known for its many bars, clubs, pubs, and cafés, concentrated in the vicinity of Simon-Dach-Straße and Boxhagener Platz. There were numerous squats in Friedrichshain, with many in and around Rigaer Straße, Mainzer Straße and Scharnweberstraße. In contrast to the districts of Prenzlauer Berg and Mitte, which have experienced high levels of demographic change and rented accommodation is higher price, it is only since the late 1990s that Friedrichshain has undergone a similar trend. Following German reunification, the availability of comparatively cheap rented accommodation attracted students and artists. In the 2020s, numerous restoration works are under way and Friedrichshain is developing at a fast pace becoming more and more gentrified itself.

At the opposite end of the district, the &quot;Volkspark Friedrichshain&quot; is a large park serving the densely populated area of Prenzlauer Berg on the other side. Its distinctive features include the &quot;Märchenbrunnen&quot; (Fairytale Fountain) and two wooded &quot;mountains&quot; consisting purely of rubble and the ruins of two World War II Flak towers.

The urban park Volkspark Friedrichshain offers opportunities for sport and recreation. The neighborhood is also home to many restaurants, several exhibition spaces, cinemas and the Berlin Kriminal Theatre, which specialises in crime stories. Frankfurter Allee features various shopping facilities as well as the Ring-Center shopping mall.

<doc id="898066" wikidata="Q478272" url="?curid=898066" title="Shichigahama">
<text>is a town located in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 18,447, and a population density of 1,400 persons per km2 in 6,681 households. The total area of the town is .

==Geography==
The town is situated on a peninsula in the middle of Miyagi Prefecture between the cities of Tagajō in the west and Shiogama in the north and east, and about halfway between Sendai and Matsushima. Shichigahama is the smallest city, town or village by land area in the whole Tōhoku region. The climate is relatively mild compared to its surrounding area and temperatures do not greatly fluctuate.

The name Shichigahama literally means &quot;seven beaches&quot;. The name comes from the seven seaside villages that originally combined to form the town. The seven beaches of Shichigahama are: Minatohama (湊浜), Matsugahama (松ヶ浜), Shobutahama (菖蒲田浜), Hanabuchihama (花渕浜), Yoshidahama (吉田浜), Yokasakihama (代ヶ崎浜) and Toguhama (東宮浜). In addition to the seven beaches, a number of neighborhoods located inland on the peninsula house a large portion of the population. These split into older neighborhoods: Yogai (要害), and Toyama (遠山), which sit close to the border with Tagajo and Shiogama, and newer neighborhoods, Shiomidai (汐見台) and Shiomidai Minami (汐見台南), which were built in the late 20th century.

===Neighboring municipalities===

*Sendai
*Shiogama
*Tagajō

===Climate===
Shichigahama has a humid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by mild summers and cold winters. The average annual temperature in Shichigahama is 12.1 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1217 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 24.6 °C, and lowest in January, at around 0.9 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Shichigahama peaked around the year 2000 and has declined since.
==History==
The area of present-day Shichigahama was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the Jōmon period of Japanese pre-history. One of the largest shell mounds to be discovered in Japan is located at the Shichigahama Jōmon History Museum (Daigigakoikaizuka). With the establishment of Tagajō in the Nara period, Shichigahama was part of the central Yamato colonization area in the region. During this time, Shichigahama was recorded as sending a wealth of marine produce to the nearby capital. During the Sengoku period, the area was contested by various samurai clans before the area came under the control of the Date clan of Sendai Domain during the Edo period, under the Tokugawa shogunate.

Modern Shichigahama developed as the seven coastal settlements that now give the town its name and the village of Shichigahama was officially established in 1889 with the post-Meiji restoration establishment of the modern municipalities system.. The village was raised to town status on January 1, 1959. The population grew steadily, with the neighborhoods of Shiomidai and Shiomidai Minami being developed in the late 20th century, to a peak population of 21,131 people in 2000.

===2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami===
On 11 March 2011 at 2:46 p.m. local time, the town was badly damaged by the tsunami caused by the 2011 Tohoku-Pacific Great earthquake. The tsunami was as tall as 10 m as it hit the town, destroying the majority of homes in Shobutahama and Hanabuchihama, as well as washing away or severely damaging many houses and buildings in the other coastal neighborhoods. The town estimates that over 1,000 houses were destroyed or damaged beyond use. The wave reached over 2 km inland, flooding the fields in front of Koyo Junior High School and Shiomidai and scattering the debris of the homes from Shobutahama. Approximately 95% of the town&#x27;s rice fields were also flooded with seawater.

Ninety Shichigahama townspeople were confirmed to have died in the tsunami, 58 in Shichigahama and 32 in other locations, 6 townspeople were still missing and 7 non-townspeople were confirmed to have died in Shichigahama. Power, water and natural gas lines were damaged and many roads were impassable for days and weeks, except to rescue workers and self-defense forces. During this time, relief was delivered to the town by aid agencies. The conditions varied considerably between centres due to difficulties with logistics and post-disaster organization.

Over 4,000 people were initially evacuated to thirteen evacuation centres. People were slowly able to return to their homes, find alternative rental accommodation or relocate to the homes of family members, leaving 715 people in three shelters by April 27 and 229 people in two shelters (the Kokusaimura and Community Centre) by June 3. By Mid-June, everyone had been moved out of evacuation centres into alternative existing accommodation or town-provided temporary housing.

As the rescue activities were completed, relief and rebuilding efforts began. Temporary housing was built for 877 people at two sites: Shichigahama Sports Fields (151 homes, housing 569 people) and Shichigahama Junior High School Baseball Field (106 homes, housing 308 people). The temporary, pre-fabricated homes were initially intended for 2–3 years, however a large number remain in use in 2014 due to slow progress on rebuilding. The Japanese Self-Defence Force, who were instrumental in initial rescue and relief activities, continued to provide widespread support to the town. They cooked the food at the evacuation centres, provided temporary bathing facilities, and assisted in clearing debris. A volunteer centre was also established at the town community center, operated by volunteers and NGO&#x27;s. The center coordinates the volunteer activities for hundreds of daily volunteers performing a range of tasks such as collecting and cleaning photos recovered from the debris, delivering donated items to the temporary homes, and clearing rubble and debris from sites of former homes.

Shichigahama&#x27;s national and international relationships also provided support. The sister town of Plymouth, Massachusetts organized a number of fundraising events capped by a 3-hour telethon which raised over $85,000. Shichigahama&#x27;s ocean-to-mountain sister town of Asahi, Yamagata-ken sent dozens of volunteers by bus every day to join the volunteer centre activities.

Shichigahama Junior High School was also severely damaged by the earthquake and was forced to close due to the structural damage. The students and staff were temporarily re-located to Koyo Junior High School, where the two schools shared facilities until pre-fabricated buildings could be sourced and installed at the Shichigahama Junior High School site. The former Shichigahama Junior High School building has been demolished (with the exception of the gym) and construction of a new building began in 2013.

==Government==
Shichigahama has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 14 members. Shichigahama, as part of Miyagi District contributes one seat to the Miyagi Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Miyagi 5th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The economy of Shichigahama is largely based on commercial fishing, and seasonal tourism.

Traditionally, Shichigahama was an ocean-driven economy with a large number of the population working in fishing, seaweed production, and also rice farming. This pattern has changed significantly in recent years with younger residents increasingly commuting to manufacturing and service jobs outside Shichigahama. A survey in 2000 indicated that working residents worked in the following industry sectors:
:* Primary Industry (farming, fishing, resources) - 525 people
:* Secondary Industry (manufacturing, production) - 3,392 people
:* Tertiary Industry (Sales, Services) - 6,386 people

The town is well known in the region for its beaches, and Shobutahama is a popular summer day-trip location for people from across Miyagi. During the summer season, a handful of &quot;Umi no ie&quot; (海の家) or &quot;sea houses&quot; are temporarily constructed on the beach, selling drinks and beach toys. Azukihama (小豆浜) in Hanabuchihama (花渕浜), is frequented almost year-round by the surfing community in Miyagi and northern Japan.

===Farming and fishing===
The commercial fishing industry is largely located in Hanabuchihama with a harbour, boats and related services located there. The majority of farmland in Shichigahama is family-owned. Family members work other main jobs in addition to growing rice, this leads a lot of the farming work to be performed by retirees and grandparents. Rice is produced primarily for family consumption with surplus production sold to local agricultural cooperatives. There is significant concern that this farming tradition will be lost in subsequent generations as younger family members choose not to farm or have moved to neighbouring cities and are not available for the daily farming activities. The tsunami is reported to have flooded up to 93% of Shichigahama&#x27;s rice-fields with the salt-water rendering them unusable for a considerable period of time. The long-term implications of this for Shichigahama&#x27;s farming are unclear.

===Sendai Thermal Power Station===
The Sendai Thermal Power Station is located in Yogasakihama, Shichigahama. The plant was built as a coal-fired power plant with four generating turbines but has since been converted to run on cleaner natural gas. Three turbines were decommissioned and the fourth was redesigned as a natural gas-powered combined-cycle generator. The building was also redesigned with the coal smoke stacks removed to reduce the visual profile on the scenic Matsushima coastline. The redesigned plant began operation on July 29, 2010. The plant is owned and operated by Tohoku Electric Power Company. Employees are often transferred from other company plants and relocate to the town either temporarily or semi-permanently.

===Industry===
A handful of factories are located in Toguhama, employing townspeople as well as workers from neighbouring Shiogama and Tagajo. The most notable are the Sony Supply Chain Solutions Centre, Yochan Foods Factory.

==Education==
Shichigahama has two public middle schools and three public elementary schools operated by the town government. The town does not have a public high school.
* Middle Schools
:* Kōyō Middle School　(向洋中学校)
:* Shichigahama Middle School (七ヶ浜中学校)

* Elementary Schools
:* Ekiraku Elementary School (赤楽小学校)
:* Matsugahama Elementary School (松ヶ浜小学校)
:* Shiomi Elementary School (汐見小学校)

Shichigahama Middle School is nicknamed &quot;Nana-chu&quot; and Kōyō Middle School　is nicknamed &quot;Koyo-chu&quot;. Students are assigned to a school based on the location of their family home. Therefore, Shiomi Elementary feeds students into Koyo-chu and Ekiraku Elementary feeds into Nana-chu, Matsugahama Elementary students are split between the two middle schools.

==Transportation==
Shichigahama is not served by any railway stations or national highways. The nearest rail stations are Tagajō Station, Geba Station, and Hon-Shiogama Station on the JR East Senseki Line. A local town bus called the Guririnko (ぐりりんこ) also runs throughout Shichigahama and goes to and from both Tagajō and Hon-Shiogama Station. Several other bus lines have stops within the town, particularly around the Shiomidai and Shiomidai Minami neighborhoods, that also offer service to nearby railway stations.

==Local attractions==

===Sports and leisure===
*Aquarena – a modern leisure centre located in the middle of Shichigahama. The Aquarena contains a main gym hall with arena seating, an indoor running track around the gym, weight and cardio exercise equipment, a hydro-therapy centre (a pool for walking) and a restaurant. Below the Aquarena sits Shichigahama Soccer Stadium (七ヶ浜サッカースタジアム) with a well-maintained grass pitch and a stand for 2,300 spectators. The stadium hosts a small number of amateur club teams, such as Sony Sendai, and school tournaments. Next to the soccer stadium are the town playing fields (七ヶ浜スポーツ広場) which have a gravel soccer pitch, baseball field and hard-court tennis courts.
* – a public facility that holds both locally and internationally themed events and shows. This facility gets its name from the original name of the Takayama resort. Like many other towns in Japan, Shichigahama employs several international Assistant Language Teachers to work in the town&#x27;s three elementary schools and two junior high schools assisting in English lessons. More unusually for its size, the town also employs two Coordinators for International Relations (CIR) from the JET Programme to work at the International Village coordinating events and supporting the sister city relationship.
* Takayama colony – a summer resort for foreign missionaries that was established in 1889 when the town leased the land to the colony. The colony is located on a fenced hill overlooking Azukihama and Shobutahama beaches and has a foreigner’s cemetery.

<doc id="898068" wikidata="Q1131751" url="?curid=898068" title="Miyagi District">
<text>is a district located in former Mutsu Province and today&#x27;s Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. The name of the prefecture was from this district.

The original territory was east–west long from the Ōu Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, including current Sendai, Shiogama, and Tagajō cities. As of 2003, the district has an estimated population of 69,567 and a density of 620.80 persons per km2. The total area is 112.06 km2.

==History==

The Minami-Koizumi site had been a village or town site since the fifth century A.D. Miyagi District first appeared in historical documents occurred in 766, in the &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot;. Archaeologists presume that Miyagi District was established by eighth century, based on the presence of square field system remains between Hirose River and Nanakita River. The province capital of Mutsu was moved to Taga (modern Tagajō) from the Koriyam site of Natori District in 724. Its residential area extended beyond the wall of Taga. In 785, Taga District and Shinakami District were separated from Miyagi, but later annexed.

Taga continued to be the capital in the Kamakura period, but the city center moved to west Iwakiri. In 1190 Isawa Iekage was appointed as the Governor Acting in Absence of Mutsu Province, charged with restoring order after the Revolt of Ōkawa Kanetō. His descendants established a fiefdom around Taga and changed their name to Rusu, which means, literally, &quot;acting in absence&quot;.

In the Nanboku-chō period of 14th century, Taga was the object of military campaigns between the South and North Courts. The Rusu family occupied the northernmost part of the district, where Taga was located. The fate of the Rusu family had been easily swung by the battles between governors of Mutsu (Ōshū). The Mutsu were strong generals sent from central government, or shogunate. In addition to the Rusu, some samurai clans were known in southern and western parts of the district, including Ōkōchi, tenacious warriors for the Southern Court; Kokubun, the lord around the provincial temple (Kukubun-ji) of Mutsu; Hachiman clan, descendants of a past vice-governor of Mutsu.

A long war broke the unity of Mutsu and the function of its capital. After the governor Ōsaki left, the rule of the district was divided by Rusu and Kokubun, who struggled against each other. Eventually the Date clan&#x27;s influence reached to Miyagi and the clan sent to its children as child-in-law and successors of the heads of families. Then Rusu Masakage and Kokubun Morishige became commanders of Date Masamune, fought many battles for the Date&#x27;s dominance over Tohoku region. The two held only nominal independence from Date, solely to placate the retainers of the families.

When Masamune surrendered to the new shogun Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1590, Rusu was abandoned and Kokubun was formally regarded a subject of Date. Miyagi District became a part of the territory of Date clan. In 1600, just after the Battle of Sekigahara, Masamune decided to build and move to the Sendai Castle in Miyagi District. After that the district was developed as the suburb of new Sendai town. Sendai town has been ruled as a different area from the rest since then.

The Meiji government divided Mutsu Province into three parts in 1869. Miyagi District became part of Rikuzen Province. The population in 1889 (excluding Sendai) was 60,518.

In March 2011, exactly ten years ago, an earthquake and tsunami hit this region of Japan.

<text>* List of Provinces of Japan &gt; Tōsandō &gt; Rikuzen Province &gt; Kami District
* Japan &gt; Tōhoku region &gt; Miyagi Prefecture &gt; Kami District

 is a rural district in Miyagi Prefecture, in the Tōhoku region of northern Japan.

At present, the district consists only of the towns of Kami and Shikama with a combined population () of 30.197 people, a population density of 53 people per km2 and an area of .

==History==
Kami District is first recorded in the Nara Period as &quot;賀美郡&quot;. During the Edo period the &quot;kanji&quot; of its name was changed to &quot;加美郡&quot;. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, the district was within Mutsu Province and was under the control of the Date clan of Sendai Domain. In 1869, following the Meiji restoration, Mutsu Province was divided, with the area of Kami District becoming part of Rikuzen Province, and from 1872, part of Miyagi Prefecture. In the establishment of the modern municipalities system, the district was organized into one town (Nakaniida (中新田町)) and six villages (Hirohara (広原村), Naruse (鳴瀬村), Onoda (小野田村), Miyazaki (宮崎村), Kamiishi (賀美石村), and Shikama (色麻村)).

<doc id="898089" wikidata="Q2052558" url="?curid=898089" title="Rose (Doctor Who episode)">
<text>&quot;Rose&quot; is the first episode of the first series of the revived British science fiction television programme &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The episode was directed by Keith Boak and written by Russell T Davies, who was also one of three executive producers. It was first broadcast in the UK on BBC One on 26 March 2005. &quot;Rose&quot; was the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode to air since the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television film in 1996.

In the episode, the London department store worker Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) gets caught in the middle of the alien time traveller the Doctor&#x27;s (Christopher Eccleston) plot to prevent an invasion of the Earth by the Nestene Consciousness (voiced by Nicholas Briggs) and the Autons after the Doctor destroys Rose&#x27;s workplace.

The episode marked Eccleston&#x27;s first appearance as the Doctor, succeeding several other actors who played the role, and Piper&#x27;s debut as the Doctor&#x27;s travelling companion Rose. Two recurring characters connected to Rose were introduced: Camille Coduri as her mother, Jackie Tyler, and Noel Clarke as her boyfriend, Mickey Smith. In addition, an antagonist from the classic era of the show was reintroduced in the form of the Autons (whose last appearance was in the 1971 serial, &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot;). Viewers did not see the Doctor regenerate from a previous incarnation, a plot device allowing a new actor to portray the character. Russell T Davies felt it would be clearer for the viewer to begin the series with the new actor in place rather than show the previous actor regenerating.

Location filming principally took place in Cardiff, the headquarters of BBC Wales, in July and August 2004, with some location scenes shot in London in July. Studio work principally took place at the Unit Q2 warehouse in Newport in August and September. Model work was recorded at the BBC&#x27;s Model Unit in London in September, and some additional filming was recorded in Cardiff in October and November.

&quot;Rose&quot; was viewed by 10.81 million viewers in the UK, making it the most viewed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode since &quot;The Creature from the Pit&quot; in 1979, and received positive reviews from critics, though there were some criticisms of its use of humour.

==Plot==
Rose Tyler, a teenage shop assistant, is chased by living mannequins after getting trapped in the basement of Henrik&#x27;s, the department store where she works. She is rescued by the Ninth Doctor, who destroys the building&#x27;s roof with a bomb in order to destroy a relay device. The next day, the Doctor visits Rose at her home and is attacked by a plastic mannequin arm that he had pulled off earlier, which he and Rose subdue. Rose investigates the Doctor using a computer owned by her boyfriend, Mickey Smith, and meets Clive, who has been tracking the Doctor&#x27;s appearances throughout history. Clive tells Rose that the Doctor is dangerous and that if he&#x27;s there, something bad is about to happen. While Rose is talking to Clive, Mickey is eaten by a wheelie bin and replaced with a plastic doppelgänger.

The fake Mickey takes Rose to dinner and attempts to question her about the Doctor, but the Doctor shows up and beheads the doppelgänger. The Doctor reveals that he is a time-travelling alien, and that the fake Mickey was an Auton, controlled by a signal from the Nestene Consciousness. Using the doppelgänger&#x27;s severed head to locate the signal, the Doctor and Rose travel to the London Eye in the TARDIS. The Doctor explains to Rose that he has a vial of anti-plastic that can be used to destroy the Nestene Consciousness if necessary. Realising that the transmitter is the London Eye itself, Rose and the Doctor descend underneath it to stop the Nestene Consciousness. They find the real Mickey, tied up but alive, and the Doctor speaks to the Nestene Consciousness. He tries to negotiate with it, but the Consciousness blames the Doctor for the destruction of its planet. The Nestene Consciousness activates all the Autons at a shopping arcade, where several shoppers are shot and killed, including Clive. The Doctor is also held down by a pair of Autons, but Rose rescues him, and the anti-plastic drops into the vat where the Nestene Consciousness resides, killing it. With the Nestene Consciousness dead, the Autons all collapse. The Doctor uses the TARDIS to take Mickey and Rose home, then persuades Rose to join him as his new companion in the TARDIS.

===Continuity===
Both the Autons and the Nestene Consciousness first appeared in the serial &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; (1970), then reappeared on-screen in &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot; (1971).

==Production==
=== Background and casting ===

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; originally ran from 1963 to 1989, when it was cancelled after its twenty-sixth season. Television producer Russell T Davies had been lobbying the BBC in an attempt to revive the show from the late 1990s, and reached the discussion phase in 2002. It was announced in September 2003 that &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was returning and would be produced by BBC Wales. The format of the programme was changed to 45-minute episodes, lightening the pace. Davies was inspired by American series such as &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Smallville&quot;, in particular by using &quot;Buffy&quot; structure of season-long story arcs around a &quot;Big Bad&quot; villain.

It was announced in March 2004 that Christopher Eccleston would play the Doctor. Jane Tranter, BBC Controller of Drama Commissioning, stated that casting an actor of Eccleston&#x27;s reputation signaled &quot;our intention to take &quot;Doctor Who&quot; into the 21st century, as well as retaining its core traditional values — to be surprising, edgy and eccentric.&quot; Eccleston had previously worked with Davies on &quot;The Second Coming&quot; and requested that Davies consider him for the role. Eccleston was attracted to the role as a way of shedding the image of him as a serious actor only.

Eccleston was the tenth actor to play the Doctor in canon broadcasts since the programme started in 1963. New actors are able to take over the role through a plot device of regeneration, introduced in 1966, in which the character of the Doctor changes body and identity. Davies decided to begin the revived series with a new Doctor rather than show the regeneration, as he believed it was &quot;madness&quot; to start with someone and then change him before the audience could build a relationship with him. Davies wanted to initially approach the revival as a &quot;new programme&quot;. Eccleston&#x27;s character is more &quot;down-to-earth&quot; than previous Doctors; Davies referred to him as &quot;stripped down&quot;, while still having &quot;fun and humour&quot;. Eccleston&#x27;s costume of a battered leather jacket was in Davies&#x27; original pitch, but the clothing also went with Eccleston&#x27;s desire not to have clothes dominating his time on the show. The Ninth Doctor&#x27;s clothes do not dominate him, but rather create a simple silhouette and an &quot;action man&quot; vibe.

Billie Piper&#x27;s casting as Rose Tyler was announced in May 2004. According to executive producer Julie Gardner, Piper, a former pop star, &quot;fits the bill perfectly&quot; as a &quot;unique, dynamic partner for Christopher Eccleston&quot;. Davies described Rose as &quot;the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal.&quot; Camille Coduri and Noel Clarke were cast to play Rose&#x27;s mother and boyfriend, then named Judy and Muggsy respectively; Davies wanted to include these characters to &quot;make her real&quot; and to &quot;give her a life&quot;. Rose&#x27;s family is working-class, which had rarely been seen in companions on the show.

=== Writing and filming ===

During writing, Davies had trouble coming up with how Mickey would be captured by the Nestene Consciousness while waiting for Rose in the car, and finally realised he could be lured by a plastic wheelie bin. He commented that such instances of the ordinary being made scary made &quot;Doctor Who&quot; unique. Davies had to take out &quot;oblique&quot; references to the Autons being like terrorists, as the Eye was once a target of a terrorist attack. The entrance of the Doctor was much debated; Tranter and other members of the production team wanted it to be more dramatic, but the scene was never reshot. Davies remarked that it reflected Rose&#x27;s point of view, whereas a more dramatic entrance would have reflected the audience&#x27;s excitement at the Doctor coming back. The scene in which the Auton arm attacks in the Tylers&#x27; flat was originally much longer, but was revised. The episode originally underran by several minutes, and a scene with the Doctor and Rose walking was added a month or so later.
Davies wanted the Doctor to realise that Rose has something to offer to his cause. Their holding hands while running was meant to signify that they were a team, despite him not asking her yet, and they were not to question their relationship. The episode was intended to be presented from Rose&#x27;s point of view. For audience identification purposes, Davies wanted the alien menace to be easily mistaken as human, so that it was plausible for Rose to do so. Davies felt that there was no need to create a new monster, as the Autons met these criteria. The Auton sequences were difficult to film because the costumes were uncomfortable for the actors, which meant that frequent breaks from filming were needed. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used in post-production to cover up the zipper on the back of the necks of the Auton costumes. Davies wanted to recreate the scene of the Autons breaking out of shop windows from their first appearance in &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot;, although he had the budget to actually smash the glass instead of just cutting around it like in &quot;Spearhead&quot;.

The episode was storyboarded by artist Anthony Williams. Davies offered Edgar Wright the opportunity to direct the episode, but Wright was forced to decline, as he was still working on &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;. Instead, the episode was directed by Keith Boak. &quot;Rose&quot; began filming in Cardiff on 20 July 2004, as part of the first production block alongside episodes four and five. Howells doubled for the interior of Henrik&#x27;s during filming on 20 July. The Autons&#x27; attack during the climax was filmed on Working Street, Cardiff, from 20 to 22 July. In other scenes filmed in Cardiff on 21 July, a London bus and a van of the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; drove by to give the illusion of London.

Five days were spent filming in London. While the DVD commentary said the first five days of the shoot were in London, production notes in &quot;Doctor Who: The Complete History&quot; placed London filming from 26 to 30 July. On 26 July, the production team was given permission to add more lights to the London Eye. For the scene in which the Doctor and Rose are running through London, also on the night of 26 July, careful timing was undertaken by the production team because they wanted a London bus to travel behind them, but this had to be accomplished by waiting for a bus to come. The exterior of Rose&#x27;s council estate was filmed at the Brandon Estate in London from 28 to 30 July.

From 2 to 3 August, service tunnels in the basement of a hospital in Cardiff were used for the basement of Henrik&#x27;s where Rose is menaced by Autons.

The pizza restaurant is La Fosse. It took the production team a while to find a restaurant that would require minimal set dressing but would be willing to close for a day. The team filmed at La Fosse on 22 August. The area underneath the London Eye where the Doctor and Rose confront the Nestene Consciousness was filmed in an unused paper mill in Grangetown, Cardiff. It underwent steam cleaning because of health and safety concerns. They were only permitted to film for three days, which required that some of the sequence be cut; originally, there was to be another Auton Mickey involved. Filming took place at the paper mill from 23 to 25 August. The scene where Rose joins the Doctor was filmed at St David&#x27;s Market on 26 August.

The production team sought to film the Cardiff scenes in secrecy, but the day before they began, the Cardiff Council issued a press release naming the streets where they would be filming.

Studio filming principally took place in August and September in the Newport warehouse Unit Q2. The lift movement was recorded at Broadcasting House, Cardiff, on 11 September.

Special effects producer Mike Tucker was reminded of the James Bond film &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; when reading the scene in which the Nestene Consciousness&#x27;s lair is blown up, and sought to display it as a major effect. The production team built a one-sixth scale model of the paper mill where the explosions were filmed. Tucker did a model explosion for the destruction of Henrik&#x27;s as well, although that was only for the roof; the rest was done by CGI. The production team considered doing the explosion practically, but that would have been too expensive. Model work was filmed on 16mm film at the BBC Model Unit on Kendal Avenue in London from 15 to 16 September.

When the episode underran, Euros Lyn directed additional material set outside Rose&#x27;s estate during the second production block, this time recorded in Gabalfa, Cardiff, on 18 October. On 10 November, Lyn directed an insert shot of Jackie Tyler at HTV&#x27;s Culverhouse Cross Studio 1 in Cardiff.

In the original script, Rose&#x27;s first experience of seeing the TARDIS interior was shared with the audience. Director Keith Boak, however, wanted her to exit and run around the TARDIS before entering again, at which point the interior would be revealed to the audience. This change was eventually embraced by the executive producers. Davies remarked that he originally wanted to take Rose and the audience inside the TARDIS all in one shot, but this was not feasible with the budget. This effect would later be accomplished in the 2012 Christmas special, &quot;The Snowmen&quot;.

==Broadcast==

===Pre-broadcast leak===
On 8 March 2005, Reuters reported that a copy of the episode had been leaked onto the Internet, and was being widely traded via the BitTorrent file sharing protocol. The leaked episode did not contain the new arrangement of the theme tune by Murray Gold. The leak was ultimately traced to a third party company in Canada which had a legitimate preview copy. The employee responsible was fired by the company and the BBC considered further legal action.

===Broadcast and ratings===
&quot;Rose&quot; was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2005 on BBC One, and was the first Doctor Who episode to air since the Doctor Who television film in 1996. Unofficial overnight viewing figures from the Broadcasters&#x27; Audience Research Board showed that the episode attracted an average of 9.9 million viewers — 43.2% of the available television audience — over the course of the evening. At its peak, it had 10.5 million viewers, a 44.3% share. The final figure for the episode, including video recordings watched within a week of transmission, was 10.81 million, third for BBC One that week and seventh across all channels. In some regions, the first few minutes of the original BBC broadcast of this episode on 26 March were marred by the accidental mixing of a few seconds of sound from Graham Norton hosting &quot;Strictly Dance Fever&quot;.

Internationally, &quot;Rose&quot; was first transmitted on CBC Television in Canada on 5 April 2005, debuting to strong ratings of 986,000 viewers. In Australia, it was broadcast on 21 May 2005 on ABC to 1.11 million viewers. &quot;Rose&quot; was first broadcast in the United States on the Sci-Fi Channel on 17 March 2006. It was aired back-to-back with the following episode &quot;The End of the World&quot;; Davies had originally wanted the first two episodes to be aired together in the UK but the request was given to the BBC too soon before transmission for the schedule to be altered. The US premiere was watched by 1.58 million viewers.

On 30 March, four days after the episode was originally broadcast in the UK, the BBC announced that another full series had been commissioned. On the same day, the BBC released a statement, apparently from Eccleston, saying that he would be leaving the role at Christmas, for fear of being typecast. The BBC later revealed this was not an official statement from Eccleston, whom they had failed to contact before responding to press questions after the story broke. Eccleston later said, &quot;They handled it very badly, but they issued an apology and I dropped it&quot; in a 2010 interview. After it was announced that Eccleston was leaving the BBC said that they were in talks with David Tennant to take over the role and he became the bookmakers&#x27; favourite, with odds at 1/10 and William Hill refusing to take any more bets on who would be cast as the new Doctor. A BBC spokesman said that they had &quot;hoped, rather than expected&quot; that Eccleston would continue in the role.

===Reception===
&quot;Rose&quot; received positive reviews and was seen as a successful relaunch to the programme. Harry Venning of &quot;The Stage&quot; praised Davies&#x27; script, particularly for taking it seriously and making it scary. He was pleased with Piper&#x27;s acting and with the character of Rose, who proved to be more independent than her predecessors. However, he felt that Eccleston was &quot;the show&#x27;s biggest disappointment&quot; as he seemed unsuited to a fantasy role. Digital Spy&#x27;s Dek Hogan stated that production values had increased from the classic series, and praised the acting of Eccleston, Piper, and Clarke, and their respective characters. However, he felt that some of the humour — such as the wheelie bin burping after it consumes Mickey — was not as enjoyable as an adult. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reviewer Robin Oliver praised Davies for &quot;[taking] an adult approach to one of television&#x27;s most famous characters&quot; and &quot;[overriding] the cash-strapped production values of the past to make his new doctor competitive in a high-tech market&quot;. Kay McFadden of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; described the revival as &quot;superb&quot; and &quot;intelligent and well-done&quot;. However, Stephen Brook of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that it was &quot;pitched at its youngest ever audience&quot;, and also felt that the episode had an &quot;overdose on humour&quot;.

Retrospective reviews have also been positive. Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; gave &quot;Rose&quot; four out of five stars in 2013, particularly praising Rose&#x27;s fleshed-out life and how it welcomed in new viewers. While he noted &quot;minor gripes&quot; and felt the Autons&#x27; destruction was toned-down, he praised the direction and the performances and called it &quot;a blinding success&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; reviewer Alasdair Wilkins gave the episode a grade of a B, also noting how important it was that Rose&#x27;s world was shown first. He felt that some effects already seemed dated in 2013 and Jackie and Mickey were one-dimensional, but the episode succeeded above all else, especially in developing Rose and the Doctor&#x27;s relationship and pointing out that the Doctor is dangerous. In 2013, Ben Lawrence of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named &quot;Rose&quot; as one of the top ten &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories set in the contemporary time.

==Legacy==
On March 26, 2020, the fifteenth anniversary of the episode, a collective fan &quot;Watch-along&quot; was held on Twitter. Writer of the episode Russell T Davies participated and released a prequel and sequel to the episode. The prequel was entitled &quot;Doctor Who and the Time War&quot;, an unused story intended for Doctor Who magazine but declined for contradicting The Day of the Doctor. The story concerns The Eighth Doctor&#x27;s regeneration into The Ninth Doctor after the events of the Time War. The sequel, entitled &quot;Revenge of the Nestene&quot;, was released in audio form, akin to the Big Finish range, continues the story from the novelisation and concerns the survival of one Auton after the events of the episode. The infamous Graham Norton interruption was also recreated.

==In print==
A novelisation of this story written by Russell T Davies was released in paperback and digital formats on 5 April 2018 as part of the &quot;Target Collection&quot;. The book features deviations from the original episode such as bigger set pieces, new plot twists and more characters. For the scene in which Clive shows Rose pictures of the Ninth Doctor to prove his immortality, the novelisation has Clive also show her previous incarnations, as well as future ones such as the Eleventh and Twelfth incarnations and Doctors that have not appeared in the series.

== Critical analysis ==
A book length study of the serial, written by Jon Arnold, was published as part of The Black Archive series from Obverse Books in 2016.

The serial was covered in number 48 of the Doctor Who: The Complete History book series, which reprinted Andrew Pixley&#x27;s &quot;Archive&quot; features from &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; and the various &quot;Doctor Who Magazine Special Editions&quot;, as well as new articles created specifically for the book.

<text>Frank Bello (born July 9, 1965) is an American musician who plays bass for the thrash metal band Anthrax. Bello was also in Helmet from 2004 to 2005 and has been touring bassist of Norwegian black metal band Satyricon since 2024.

==Early life==
Bello is the nephew of Anthrax drummer Charlie Benante. He had a younger brother Anthony, who was murdered in the Bronx, New York City, in 1996. His murder was never solved. Bello has a tattoo on his right upper arm with a design of Anthony&#x27;s face, with the words &#x27;In Memory of Anthony&#x27; below it.

== Career ==

Bello was originally a roadie and guitar technician for Anthrax, but later replaced Dan Lilker soon after the release of the band&#x27;s 1984 debut album &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot;, and has held this position ever since, excluding a brief departure in 2004, during which he was a member of Helmet – another New York City-based metal band. His stint in Helmet was brief, as Bello reunited with Anthrax the following year, and has remained in the band since.

Bello has referred to Paul McCartney, Steve Harris, Gene Simmons, Geezer Butler, Geddy Lee, Chris Squire, Tom Petersson and Jaco Pastorius as influences and inspirations to his bass playing.
He mostly plays bass fingerstyle, but also uses a pick on certain songs. For example he can be seen using one in the videos for &quot;Room for One More&quot; and &quot;Fueled&quot;. He also used a pick most of the time during his stint with Helmet.

In May 2021, Bello announced the forthcoming publication of his autobiography, &quot;Fathers, Brothers, and Sons: Surviving Anguish, Abandonment, and Anthrax&quot;. The book&#x27;s co-writer is British author Joel McIver and it includes a foreword by Gene Simmons of Kiss.

In 2024, Bello joined Satyricon as a touring member.

=== Acting ===

Bello played Richard Hell in &quot;Greetings from Tim Buckley&quot;, a film on Tim and Jeff Buckley, which premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival.
He also played a small role as a stick-up man in &quot;Joe&#x27;s Apartment&quot;, and appeared in the intro scene in the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episode &quot;The Brotherhood&quot;, credited as &quot;Rocker&quot;. He also played himself in an episode of &quot;Married... with Children&quot; and Newsradio.

==Equipment==

In the early days on Anthrax, Bello used an ESP Precision-styled bass, possibly a 400 series, that had EMG P-bass and J-bass pickups. ESP released this bass as a signature model, available only in Japan, in the mid-to-late 1980s. Sometime during the late 1980s, he switched to an ESP Surveyor P-bass, which had nearly all the same specifications of his previous basses, but with a finished headstock. He began using Fender basses during the beginning of the 1990s, due to a falling out with ESP which, according to ESP Vice President Jeff Moore, was due to miscommunication. He began using Fender P-basses around the time of Persistence of Time until the release of his signature model. Bello had a signature model Fender Jazz bass. The model combines a Fender Aerodyne body with a Precision Bass-width neck, Alder body wood (as opposed to the Aerodyne&#x27;s Basswood) and a mix of Precision and Jazz bass pickups along with non-standard custom-chosen hardware. Pickups used on the bass are Seymour Duncan SPB-3 precision bass pickup in the neck position and a Samarium Cobalt Noiseless Jazz Bass pickup in the bridge position, although Bello&#x27;s personal bass now is equipped with EMG HZ Passive pickups which Bello prefers &quot;as the output is... a lot louder&quot; and he gets &quot;a lot more punch&quot;. Bello also had a signature Squier electric jazz bass. It features P/J style pick up combination and a skull inlay/body graphic.

The ESP Frank Bello and LTD FB-4 are both based on the ESP Vintage-4 model, customized to Belloʼs specifications with a Black Satin finish and black anodized aluminum pickguard, ebony fingerboard with black pearloid block inlays, EMG PJ-X active pickups and a Gotoh bridge. The basses feature bolt-on construction at 34&quot; scale, an alder body, and maple neck with 21 XJ frets. There is a writing of &quot;R.I.P. Dimebag&quot; on Bello&#x27;s bass guitar (Fender model) for tribute to deceased Pantera and Damageplan guitarist Dimebag Darrell, which he inscribed into his bass the night of his death. After constant touring with Megadeth&#x27;s bass player, David Ellefson, Bello switched to a Hartke LH1000 and HyDrive cabinets. On tour, he also use a SansAmp Bass driver for a &quot;grinding tone&quot; for the &quot;Got The Time&quot; song. Previously, he used Ampeg SVT amplifiers and cabinets during the early 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. During the late 1980s, he used a rack system that relied on a Yamaha PB1 Preamp and Crown Power Base-1 power amplifiers. While in Helmet, Bello used Fender 800-PRO amplifiers with a Sansamp Bass Driver DI distortion pedal.

In 2022 Charvel Guitars introduced a Frank Bello signature bass from their custom shop with a P Bass body, PJ EMG pickup configuration, Mirrored tele bass style pickguard and a maple neck and fretboard. Later in the year they released a Pro-Mod Mexican made version 
In 2023 Tech 21 release a Frank Bello signature SansAmp, the Street Driver 48 

==Philanthropy==
Bello has shown support for Little Kids Rock, a national nonprofit that works to restore and revitalize music education in disadvantaged U.S. public schools, by donating several bass guitars and amps to 15 New York City public schools. He also visited a Little Kids Rock classroom to show encouragement to young musicians, answer their questions, and jam with them on their favorite songs.

<text>Illuminations is an incomplete suite of prose poems by the French poet Arthur Rimbaud, first published partially in &quot;&quot;, a Paris literary review, in May–June 1886. The texts were reprinted in book form in October 1886 by Les publications de La Vogue under the title &quot;Les Illuminations&quot; proposed by the poet Paul Verlaine, Rimbaud&#x27;s former lover. In his preface, Verlaine explained that the title was based on the English word &quot;illuminations&quot;, in the sense of coloured plates, and a sub-title that Rimbaud had already given the work. Verlaine dated its composition between 1873 and 1875.

Rimbaud wrote the majority of poems comprising &quot;Illuminations&quot; during his stay in the United Kingdom with Verlaine at his side. The texts follow Rimbaud&#x27;s peregrinations in 1873 from Reading where he had hoped to find steady work, to Charleville and Stuttgart in 1875.

== Content, style, and themes ==

The text of &quot;Illuminations&quot; is generally agreed to consist of forty-two poems. In large part, due to the circumstances surrounding the publication of the poems of &quot;Illuminations&quot;, there is no consensus as to the order in which Rimbaud intended the poems to appear. Nevertheless, certain conventions stand among the many editions of the text. For example, the various publications of &quot;Illuminations&quot; almost invariably begin with &quot;Après Le Deluge&quot;. Despite this ostensible controversy, a large number of scholars have declared the order of &quot;Illuminations&quot; to be irrelevant. Perhaps translator Bertrand Mathieu best distilled the major reasons for this contention: &quot;No single poem really depends on the others or counts on them to achieve its own perfections. Each is intrinsic (we don&#x27;t know the exact sequence and we don&#x27;t need to know it).&quot;

The collection consists overwhelmingly of prose poems, which number forty of the forty-two poems. The two exceptions are &quot;Marine&quot; and &quot;Mouvement&quot;, which are vers libre. These two poems are remarkable not only as exceptions within &quot;Illuminations&quot; itself, but as two of the first free verse poems written in the French language. Within the genres of prose poetry and &quot;vers libre&quot;, the poems of &quot;Illuminations&quot; bear many stylistic distinctions. Though influenced by the earlier prose poems of Charles Baudelaire, the prose poems differ starkly from Baudelaire&#x27;s in that they lack prosaic elements such as linear storytelling and transitions. Because of these differences, Rimbaud&#x27;s prose poems are denser and more poetic than Baudelaire&#x27;s. These differences also contribute to the surrealist quality of &quot;Illuminations&quot;. Though Rimbaud predated surrealism, he is said to have written in a surrealistic style due to the hallucinatory, dreamlike aspect of many of the poems. Another aspect of Rimbaud&#x27;s style, which also contributes to the visionary quality of the poems, is his use of words for their evocative quality rather than their literal meaning. In addition to these stylistic qualities, &quot;Illuminations&quot; is rich with sensory imagery. A puzzling aspect of Rimbaud&#x27;s style is his use of foreign words within the French text of &quot;Illuminations&quot;. For example, the poem &quot;Being Beauteous&quot; has an English title, even in the original French. Rimbaud biographer Graham Robb suggests that the presence of words from languages like English and German are due in part to Rimbaud&#x27;s travels. Apparently, as he learned languages, Rimbaud kept lists of words he wished to use in poems.

Because the poems of &quot;Illuminations&quot; are so diverse and self-contained, they cover a wide range of themes. One theme evident throughout the text is protest. This theme permeates the first poem, &quot;Après Le Deluge&quot;, and continues throughout many of the poems in the work. In &quot;Illuminations&quot;, Rimbaud seems to protest almost everything the society in which he lives has to offer. Another major theme in &quot;Illuminations&quot; is the city, most evident in the poem &quot;Ville&quot;. This theme features prominently in at least six of the poems of &quot;Illuminations&quot;, and is mentioned in many others. In these poems, Rimbaud expresses a simultaneous attraction and horror towards the modern city. Other major themes include anguish, ecstasy, metamorphosis, nature, walking and travel, creation and destruction.

==Writing &quot;Les Illuminations&quot;==
No one knows exactly when Rimbaud&#x27;s &quot;Les Illuminations&quot; was written. It can be ascertained, from examination of the poems, that they were not all written at the same time. It is known that the poems were written in many different locations, such as Paris, London, and Belgium. Rimbaud was also involved in various relationships while he was composing these writings. He lived with Paul Verlaine and his small family in Paris from September 1871 to July 1872, with a short stint in Charleville in March, April, and May. The two travelled from Belgium to London in August 1872. It was this trip to London that provided Rimbaud with the backdrop of a British city for many of his poems. The two spent the following year together in London, with Rimbaud visiting Charleville twice. During these months with Verlaine, Rimbaud grew and matured. The majority of the poems included in &quot;Les Illuminations&quot; were written in 1873, the happiest year of Rimbaud&#x27;s and Verlaine&#x27;s relationship.

When his relationship with Verlaine ended, Rimbaud went to live with Germain Nouveau in London in 1874, revising old poems and writing new ones later included in &quot;Les Illuminations&quot;. Rimbaud&#x27;s relationship with Nouveau remains mysterious because of the lack of information about their life together. Although little is known about this year in his life, it is certain that in February 1875 Rimbaud had given the manuscript sub-titled &quot;Les Illuminations&quot; to Verlaine.

== Publication and critical response ==

Two versions of &quot;Illuminations&quot; were published in 1886, each version arranging texts in orders that differ from the other edition. Earning his living as a trader in the Horn of Africa at this time, Rimbaud was never personally involved in the publication of either edition. He did not leave Africa until 1891 when he was sick to the point of death.

===Publication history===

On Verlaine&#x27;s release from prison in February 1875, Rimbaud entrusted him with the manuscript known today as &quot;Illuminations&quot; with the mission to mail it to Germain Nouveau in Brussels. Intent on an extended tour of Europe, Rimbaud had asked Nouveau to secure a Belgian publisher in his absence. Soon after sending the manuscript to Nouveau, however, Verlaine was seized with remorse: Why had he not searched for a publisher himself? At Verlaine&#x27;s request, Nouveau returned the manuscript two years later at a meeting in London in 1877. With a view to publishing the complete works, Verlaine inserted into the original manuscript poems written in 1872 along with texts Rimbaud had given to Nouveau. Several months later, Verlaine loaned the manuscripts to the composer Charles de Sivry (the half-brother of Verlaine&#x27;s estranged wife, Mathilde Mauté) with the aim of their being set to music. Learning that her half-brother was in possession of Rimbaud&#x27;s texts, Mathilde expressly forbade de Sivry to return the manuscripts to Verlaine or to anyone else likely to publish them. It was not until nine years later, in 1886, after Mathilde had divorced Verlaine and remarried, that she rescinded her publication ban. Still seeking revenge over the destruction of her marriage by Rimbaud, Mathilde prohibited Verlaine from ever regaining possession of his former lover&#x27;s manuscripts.

De Sivry confided Rimbaud&#x27;s texts to Louis Cardonel with the proviso that Verlaine was not to be involved in their publication. Cardonel approached Gustave Kahn, editor of the literary magazine &quot;La Vogue&quot;, who agreed to publish the work along with a sonnet by Rimbaud in 1886. At Kahn&#x27;s request, art critic and journalist Félix Fénéon arranged the order of the texts by respecting pages that linked the end of a text and the start of another. Inserted at random were verse poems and a few isolated pages. Despite these preparations, only 35 out of a total of 42 texts were published in &quot;La Vogue&quot; between May 13 and June 21 due to an obscure dispute between those associated with the project. Later in the year, Kahn commissioned Verlaine to write a preface to the still untitled suite of poems for their publication in book form by Les publications de La Vogue in October 1886. Verlaine gave them their collective name &quot;Illuminations&quot; or &quot;coloured plates&quot;, a title that Rimbaud had earlier proposed as a sub-title. The publishers&#x27; dispute ultimately resulted in a dividing up of the manuscripts and their dispersal. Rimbaud died without the benefit of knowing that his manuscripts had not only been published but were lauded and studied, having finally gained the recognition he had strived for.

In 1895, an edition claiming to be the &quot;complete works&quot; of Rimbaud, with a new preface by Verlaine, was published by Vanier éditions, containing only five pieces from &quot;Illuminations&quot;. Since then, there have been many publications of Rimbaud&#x27;s &quot;Illuminations&quot;, both in the original French and in translation.

===Critical opinion===
Rimbaud was the subject of an entire chapter in Paul Verlaine&#x27;s &quot;Les Poètes maudits&quot;, showing the older poet&#x27;s devotion to and belief in his young lover. He also wrote an introduction to the &quot;Illuminations&quot; in the 1891 publication, arguing that despite the years past in which no one heard from Rimbaud his works were still relevant and valuable.

Albert Camus, in his 1951 essay &quot;L&#x27;homme révolté&quot;, hailed Rimbaud as &quot;the poet of revolt, and the greatest&quot;, mainly for his last two works, &quot;Une saison en enfer&quot; and &quot;Illuminations&quot; — although he vehemently criticized him for his later &quot;resignation&quot; from literature, hence revolt itself, when he became a &quot;bourgeois traficker&quot;.

== Translations ==

===Translation history===

Arthur Rimbaud&#x27;s &quot;Illuminations&quot;, initially written and published in the late 19th century, has been translated numerous times since its original composition. Translators (and often poets in their own right) have undertaken this task repeatedly throughout the last century, producing many distinct, original, and innovative versions of the French collection of prose poetry. Some of the most popular translations include those by Helen Rootham (1932), Louise Varèse (1946/revised 1957), Paul Schmidt (1976), Nick Osmond (1993), Dennis J. Carlile (2001), Martin Sorrell (2001), Wyatt Mason (2002), and the collaborative team composed of Jeremy Harding and John Sturrock (2004). All of these translators have worked to introduce &quot;Illuminations&quot; to a new generation, each having their own angle in their presentation of the work. Variations in cross-language (French to English) translation, differences in the ordering of texts, discrepancies in the inclusion/exclusion of certain &quot;proems&quot;, and incorporation of forwards/introductions written by the specific translators all account for the ability of these works to offer new meaning to &quot;Illuminations&quot;. In 2011, poet John Ashbery published a translation of &quot;Illuminations,&quot; which was favorably reviewed in the New York Times Book Review by Lydia Davis as &quot;meticulously faithful yet nimbly inventive.&quot;

===Analysis of translations===

In the Wyatt Mason translation (2002), much of the Introduction to his version of &quot;Illuminations&quot; focuses on the biographical details of Rimbaud&#x27;s life.

In the Nick Osmond translation (1993), a thorough reading of the Introduction again provides background information and proves useful in examining his purpose for translating.

In the Jeremy Harding and John Sturrock translation (2004), the reader is the focus of the work. Parallel text has been adopted to make the reading more manageable for the literary audience, and although this is known to &quot;cramp&quot; a translator&#x27;s style, Harding &amp; Sturrock chose to do so for the sake of their readers. In addition, this translation takes much liberty in the sounds established through cross-language barriers. Instead of focusing on keeping the syllable count consistent with the French when translated to English, the translators chose to use words sounding more pleasant to the &#x27;English ear&#x27;. Also interesting, this translation includes only half of the forty-two prose poems known to make up &quot;Illuminations,&quot; proving further liberties have been taken in its formation.

== Influence and legacy ==

&quot;Symbolism&quot;: The Paris literary review &quot;La Vogue&quot; was the first to publish &quot;Illuminations&quot;. Knowing little about Rimbaud, the editor Gustave Kahn mistakenly introduced him as &quot;the late Arthur Rimbaud&quot;, thereby facilitating his adoption by the Symbolists as a legendary poetic figure. Rimbaud&#x27;s style and syntactical choices pointed to Symbolist tendencies, including the use of abstract plural nouns.

&quot;Dadaism&quot;: In its rejection of the sensible and logical, Dadaism embraced Rimbaud&#x27;s ability to write in abstractions and impossibilities. This supports Rimbaud&#x27;s role in revolutions as the Dadaist movement was a protest movement against capitalist ideals believed to be at the root of all war.

&quot;Surrealists&quot;: Rimbaud&#x27;s poetry was &quot;Surrealist before the word was invented or became a movement&quot;. Although Surrealists often disowned all art before their time, Rimbaud is one of the few predecessors the group acknowledged. Like Dadaists, Surrealists do not accept rationality as they believe it to be the cause of unhappiness and injustice. Rimbaud&#x27;s passion to &quot;change life&quot; is echoed in the Surrealist&#x27;s call to change reality through (only currently) impossibilities. A main difference, however, is that Rimbaud did not &quot;abandon himself passively&quot; to automatic writing like many Surrealist writers.

The French painter Charles Picart Le Doux, drafted to serve in World War I in 1914, paid a last visit to his studio, where he slipped into his pocket his copy of &quot;Les Illuminations&quot;, the book he deemed &quot;the most apt to console me for the stupidity of men. It was to be my companion for the next four years.&quot;

Rimbaud&#x27;s life and works have inspired many musicians. Vocal works (operas and short songs), symphonies, trios, piano pieces, and rock songs exist, taking as their subjects &quot;Illuminations&quot; and Rimbaud&#x27;s earlier work, &quot;A Season in Hell&quot;.

The British composer Benjamin Britten set a selection of &quot;Illuminations&quot; to music. &quot;Les Illuminations for tenor or soprano and strings, Op. 18&quot; uses nine prose poems: &quot;Fanfare&quot;, &quot;Villes&quot;, &quot;Phrase&quot;, &quot;Antique&quot;, &quot;Royauté&quot;, &quot;Marine&quot;, &quot;Interlude&quot;, &quot;Being Beauteous&quot;, &quot;Parade&quot;, and &quot;Départ&quot;. The Decca Record Co. (London) released a historic recording featuring Britten conducting the work, with Britten&#x27;s lifelong companion Peter Pears singing the tenor part (Britten had dedicated his setting of the song &quot;Being Beauteous&quot; to Pears).

American composer Harold Blumenfeld devoted an entire decade immersing himself in Rimbaud, producing four compositions, namely: &quot;La Face Cendrée&quot;, &quot;Ange de Flamme et de la Glace&quot;, &quot;Illuminations&quot;, and &quot;Carnet de damné&quot;. Three of these works are based on prose poems from &quot;Illuminations&quot;. &quot;La Face Cendreé&quot; is a work for soprano, cello, and piano; it takes the &quot;Aube&quot; and &quot;Being Beauteous&quot; as subject. &quot;Ange de Flamme et de la Glace&quot;, a work for medium voice and chamber ensemble, is based on the &quot;Barbare&quot;. Blumenfeld&#x27;s two-part orchestral work, &quot;Illuminations&quot;, is based on five prose poems from Rimbaud&#x27;s work: &quot;Mystique&quot;, &quot;Diluvial&quot;, &quot;Après le déluge&quot;, &quot;À une raison&quot;, and &quot;Soir historique&quot;.

Other composers inspired by Rimbaud are Bulgarian composer Henri Lazarof and German composers Georg Katzer and Andreas Staffel (born 1965). Henri Lazarof&#x27;s &quot;Fifth Symphony&quot; uses two French texts, one by Lazarof himself and the other by Rimbaud. Georg Katzer&#x27;s &quot;Trio for Oboe, Cello, and Piano&quot; uses an essay by Rimbaud. Andreas Staffel&#x27;s work &quot;Illumination&quot; is for piano, based on Rimbaud&#x27;s &quot;Illuminations&quot;.

Hans Krása&#x27;s &quot;3 Lieder After Poems by Rimbaud&quot;, was composed in the confines of the Terezín ghetto (Theresienstadt) in Czechoslovakia. The Bohemian composer Hans Krása (1899–1944) was a pupil of celebrated composers Zemlinsky and Roussel. These &quot;Rimbaud Songs&quot; are set for baritone, clarinet, viola, and cello. On the last page of Krása&#x27;s original manuscript was a rehearsal schedule in the concentration camp: four were held in the Magdburg Barracks and one in the Dresden Barracks.

Rock musicians Bob Dylan, [[Jim Morrison], and [[Patti Smith]] have expressed their appreciation for Rimbaud (the latter calling Dylan the reincarnation of the French poet). The essay &quot;Rimbaud and Patti Smith: Style as Social Deviance&quot; by Carrie Jaurès Noland features a critical analysis of Rimbaud&#x27;s influence on Patti Smith&#x27;s work. [[Wallace Fowlie]]&#x27;s book, &quot;Rimbaud and Jim Morrison: The Rebel as Poet&quot;, attempts to draw parallels between the lives and personalities of Rimbaud and Jim Morrison, demonstrating how the latter found Rimbaud a constant source of inspiration. Fowlie argues that some of Morrison&#x27;s &quot;lost writings&quot; (a volume of poetry published posthumously, entitled &quot;Wilderness&quot;) bear strong resemblance to pieces from &quot;Illuminations.&quot;

<text>Servicio Aéreo de Honduras S.A. otherwise known as SAHSA Airlines was the national flag carrier airline of Honduras from October 22, 1945, to January 14, 1994. The airline was a subsidiary of Pan American Airways and merged with &quot;Transportes Aéreos Nacionales&quot; (TAN) to form TAN-SAHSA in November 1991.

==History==

SAHSA was founded on January 2, 1945, with help from Pan American Airways under the name &quot;Servicio Aéreo de Honduras S.A.&quot; (SAHSA). Pan American Airways owned 40%, the Honduran government owned 40% and 20% was owned by private investors.

The airline began operations on October 22, 1945, using a Douglas DC-2 (XH-SAA) to fly to destinations within Honduras. By October 1945, SAHSA had also acquired a Douglas DC-3 and a Beechcraft Model 18. In 1953, SAHSA acquired rival airline &quot;TACA de Honduras&quot;, by which time SAHSA was operating the Douglas DC-2, Douglas DC-3, and Curtis C-46 Commando.

Equipment with modern pressurised airliners began in the mid-1960s with the Convair 340, Convair 440 and Douglas DC-6B being added to the fleet. The turboprop Lockheed L-188 Electra joined the company in 1969.

In 1970, Pan Am gave up its stake in SAHSA and TAN took over, but SAHSA continued to operate independently. TAN acquired the first jet airliner in Honduras, a Boeing 737-200, in 1974, and started international operations between Miami and Honduras. SAHSA acquired a Boeing 737-200 in October 1974 and later acquired Boeing 727-200s. SAHSA began operations between Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Belize and New Orleans.

The owner of TAN-SAHSA, Oswaldo López Arellano, was a two-term president of Honduras. To keep business in Honduras, no U.S. airlines were given permission fly to or from Honduras. Once Arellano was thrown out of power, several U.S. based airlines, such as Eastern Airlines, Pan Am and Air Florida, were allowed to operate to and from Honduras.

SAHSA and TAN merged into TAN-SAHSA on 1 November 1991. It was based at Toncontín International Airport in Tegucigalpa and flew from Honduras to various destinations throughout Central and North and South America. The TAN-SAHSA name was used between 1990 and 1991 when the name TAN disappeared. The airline continued to operate as SAHSA until its demise in 1994. The collapse was partly due to corruption and partly to the airline&#x27;s poor safety record. The airline experienced several accidents during its operational life, including a major crash of a 727 in 1989 in Honduras, killing 131 of 146 passengers aboard, and a subsequent emergency landing incident on a Houston-bound 737 plane in 1993, after which the airline lost its FAA Air Operations Certificate and with it its operating privileges to the United States. No longer able to fly to the United States, financial pressures caused the airline to cease flight operations in late 1993 and it was disbanded in January 1994. Following the collapse of SAHSA, Honduras had no national airline until 2002, when Sol Air commenced operations.

==Destinations==
SAHSA was initially established as a national airline to operate domestic flights with aircraft such as the Douglas DC-2 and Douglas DC-3. Initial routes were limited to Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula, Puerto Cortés, La Ceiba, Marcala, Intibucá, Santa Rosa de Copán, Ocotepeque and Santa Bárbara.

The first U.S. route operated by SAHSA was to New Orleans in 1974 with Lockheed L-188 Electra propjet service being flown on a daily route of New Orleans-Belize-San Pedro Sula-Tegucigalpa with continuing service three days a week being operated to San Jose, Costa Rica by this Electra flight.

Following the acquisition of Boeing jet aircraft in the mid 1970s, the airline expanded its international routes. In addition to New Orleans, Belize, Guatemala City and San Jose, CR, new destinations included Houston, Miami, Grand Cayman, Managua, Guatemala City, San Salvador, Panama, Colombia and Peru.

==Accidents and incidents==
Sahsa Airlines was involved in several incidents and accidents, the most notable being:
* On 7 June 1962, a SAHSA Curtiss C-46 Commando (HR-SAL); a cargo flight, crash landed at Toncontin when the left side undercarriage strut collapsed on touchdown. Both crew members survived but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
* On 20 February 1967, SAHSA Flight 203, a Douglas DC-6 (HR-SAS) had an accident at Toncontin International Airport because of a reverse prop system failure, during forced braking two main gear tires caught fire, the plane overran the runway and caught fire killing 4 passengers.
* On 13 September 1969, a SAHSA Douglas DC-3 was hijacked at Comalapa International Airport. The hijacking lasted less than one day and there were no fatalities.
* On 25 November 1969, a SAHSA Douglas DC-3 (HR-ANA) crashed whilst attempting to land on runway 01 at Toncontin. Strong gusts of wind upset the aircraft attitude during its flare which pushed the aircraft towards the terminal buildings. The crew forced a turn away from the buildings and crashed. All 15 passengers and 3 crew survived.
* On 28 May 1980, a SAHSA Douglas DC-3 (HR-SAC) was damaged beyond repair when part of its landing gear struck a wall whilst on approach to Utila Airport in Honduras.
* On 8 January 1981, a Lockheed L-188 Electra (HR-SAW) crashed at Guatemala City whilst on a ferry flight to Tegucigalpa for repairs, the plane took off with only three engines and one of the electrical generators malfunctioning, shortly after take off the plane lost hydraulic pressure and tried return to La Aurora International Airport, but the plane lost altitude and crashed into some houses 1 mile west of the airport, killing the 6 crew members on board.
* On 27 March 1981, a SAHSA Boeing 737-200 was hijacked in Panama by terrorists demanding the release of prisoners. The hijackers surrendered after 2 days. There were no fatalities.
* On 21 October 1989, Tan-Sahsa Flight 414 a Boeing 727-200 (N88705) crashed at the &quot;Cerro de Hula&quot; mountain ridge after an unsuccessful approach, killing 127 people.
* On 18 March 1990, a SAHSA Douglas DC-3 (HR-SAZ) overran the runway on landing at Juan Manuel Gálvez International Airport, Roatán and ended up in the sea. The aircraft, performing a domestic scheduled passenger flight, was damaged beyond repair but all 32 people on board escaped.
* On 17 November 1991, a SAHSA Boeing 737-200 landed hard on the right main gear strut at Juan Santamaria International Airport casing the right landing gear strut to collapse. All 36 passengers and 6 crew escaped.
* On 18 July 1993, a SAHSA Boeing 737-200 was damaged beyond repair during a hard landing at Managua Airport in Nicaragua the aircraft skidded to the right, off the runway. The nosegear collapsed and both engines were torn off. The aircraft came to rest 200 feet right of the runway.

<doc id="898110" wikidata="Q358648" url="?curid=898110" title="Table of organization and equipment">
<text>A table of organization and equipment (TOE or TO&amp;E) is the specified organization, staffing, and equipment of military units. Also used in acronyms as &#x27;T/O&#x27; and &#x27;T/E&#x27;. It also provides information on the mission and capabilities of a unit as well as the unit&#x27;s current status.

A general TOE is applicable to a type of unit (for instance, an infantry battalion) rather than a specific unit (the 2nd Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment). Sometimes, all units of the same branch (such as Infantry) follow the same structural guidelines; much more often, there are a wide variety of TOEs to suit specific circumstances (Modified Tables of Organization and Equipment (MTOEs), in the United States Army, for example).

==Soviet Union and Russia==

In the Soviet and the Russian Armed Forces the term used for TO&amp;E since the 1930s is &quot;Shtatnoe raspisanie&quot; (&quot;Штатное расписание&quot;, literally translated as Shtat Prescription). It originates from the term &quot;Shtat&quot; (&quot;штат&quot;) which literally means &quot;assignment&quot; and in a secondary meaning as the synonym for TO&amp;E itself. Note that in the Soviet Union and modern day Russia the term &quot;Shtatnoe raspisanie&quot; applied not only to military unit, but also to state organisations such as ministries, agencies, universities, hospitals etc. and even to the corporate structure of private companies.

Many of the Red Army&#x27;s rifle divisions at the beginning of Operation Barbarossa were operating on Shtat 04/400 of 5 April 1941. This Shtat stipulated that an infantry division should consist of three infantry regiments, a light and a howitzer artillery regiment, other artillery units, a reconnaissance battalion, a combat engineer battalion, signals, chemical company (decontamination/flamethrower), transport, medical, and logistics train units, an aviation flight, and a division staff seemingly consisting of the division commander (1/0/0), division staff (70, including 12 horses and 13 vehicles), a quartermaster section of five officers (5/0/0), a military tribunal (military justice) of two officers, and a political section of 11 officers.

Soviet rifle divisions were often forced to operate at far below their authorised strengths. For example, in the middle of the fighting on the Eastern Front, on July 20, 1942, a report on the 284th Rifle Division lamented:
The commissar, Tkachenko, went on to urgently request vehicles (including ambulances, of which there were none), small arms and support weapons, draught horses, and a closer supply base. After the first day of fighting he further reported that the lack of high-explosive shells forced the artillery to fire armor-piercing rounds at enemy firing points and troops; there were no cartridges for the submachine guns; many of the men&#x27;s uniforms and footwear were worn out; and it was impossible to commit the replacements into the fighting because of the lack of weapons.

The actual personnel (field ration) strength of Red Army units and formations during the first 30 months of the Second World War seldom if ever met the specified &quot;shtat&quot; totals. Manpower shortages were routine if not endemic. When Operation Barbarossa began, the average strength of divisions facing the Germans was about 67%; with enormous variations, the average totals began to rise before offensives as Stavka refilled the divisions in advance of operations, and then formations were ground down in battle. Several instances of divisions continuing to operate with only hundreds of men are recorded. On main attack axes in mid-1943, average personnel strengths reached 75-80% of the required &quot;shtat.&quot;

After the Second World War, formations were held at a series of descending levels of strength, (&quot;A,&quot; &quot;Б,&quot; &quot;В,&quot; &quot;Г,&quot;) corresponding to the first four letters of the Russian Cyrillic alphabet. The reason for the creation of reduced-strength (cadre) units and formations in the USSR Armed Forces was the need to reduce the Armed Forces while simultaneously maintaining officer personnel, stocks of military equipment, weapons and materiel. 

For example, in the 191st Motor Rifle Regiment of the &quot;framed&quot; (reduced-strength) 201st Motor Rifle Division at the beginning of December 1979, there were 12 (twelve) people (the regiment was held at a state “G” strength). In connection with the deployment of the regiment to Afghanistan, in January 1980, the regiment&#x27;s personnel were quickly increased to 2,200 people.

==United States==
===Army===

In the U.S. Army, there are four basic types of TOEs:

*The Base Table of Organization and Equipment (BTOE)
**An organizational design document based on current doctrine and available equipment. It shows the basics of a unit&#x27;s structure and their wartime requirements (both for personnel and equipment).
*The Objective Table of Organization and Equipment (OTOE)
**An updated form of the BTOE, usually formed within the last year. It is a fully modern document and is up to date with current policies and initiatives.
*A Modified Table of Organization and Equipment (MTOE)
**A document that modifies a BTOE in regard to a specific unit. Used when a unit&#x27;s needs are substantially different from the BTOE.
*A Table of Distribution and Allowances (TDA)
**A type of temporary TOE that is applicable to a specific mission. Used in an instance when there is no applicable TOE.

Each TOE has a unique number that identifies it. When changes are needed, a table is not modified, instead, a new table is drafted from scratch.

An example of an overall T/O change can be seen when the &quot;Pentomic&quot; organization was superseded by the Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD). During the 1950s, the Pentomic reorganization shifted the basic tactical unit from the regiment to the five-company battle group. Instead of brigades, an armored division had three Combat Commands designated: CCA, CCB, and CCC. 

On 16 December 1960, the Army Chief of Staff directed a reappraisal of division organization. Resulting studies were carried out between January and April 1961, and fully implemented by 1965. The resulting Reorganization of Army Divisions (ROAD) changed all division types (Mechanized, Airborne, Armor, Infantry and Cavalry) to an identical structure of three brigades of three (sometimes four) battalions. The ROAD division consisted of a mix of nine to twelve armor and infantry battalions based on its Mission, the likely Enemy, the Terrain/weather, and other forces available or Troops (METT). Each brigade would be assigned or attached the mix of battalions and companies based on the division commanders estimate based on METT. As operations continued, the division commander could task organize subordinate units as needed by the flow of the battle.

===Marine Corps===

Marine T/O&amp;Es are based on a generic template for each specific type and size of unit, for example, a weapons company of an infantry battalion, or a heavy helicopter squadron. These templates are then modified as needed by the individual unit. The Marine Corps also relies on other documents to report what personnel and equipment a unit actually possesses.

The T/O section denotes every authorized billet within a unit by rank and Military Occupational Specialty required to fulfill the necessary duties. The T/E section denotes authorized equipment by Line Item Number and quantity.

<text>The Amazing Race 5 is the fifth season of the American reality competition show &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. Hosted by Phil Keoghan, it featured eleven teams of two, each with a pre-existing relationship, competing in a race around the world to win US$1,000,000. This season visited six continents and twelve countries and traveled over during thirteen legs. Starting in Santa Monica, racers traveled through Uruguay, Argentina, Russia, Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania, the United Arab Emirates, India, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Canada before returning to the United States and finishing in Dallas. New twists introduced in this season included the Yield, where one team could force another team to stop racing for a predetermined amount of time, and a new non-elimination leg penalty where teams that finished last where stripped of all of the money they had accumulated during previous legs and would not receive any money in the subsequent leg. The season premiered on CBS on July 6, 2004, and concluded on September 21, 2004.

Married parents Chip and Kim McAllister were the winners of the season, while dating couple Colin Guinn and Christie Woods finished in second place, and models Brandon Davidson and Nicole O&#x27;Brian finished in third place.

==Production==
===Development and filming===

After the anemic ratings for &quot;The Amazing Race 4&quot;, CBS chairman and CEO Les Moonves doubted whether the series would be renewed for another season. After much deliberation, CBS officially ordered a fifth installment of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; in September 2003. Some observers cited the series&#x27; recent Emmy win as the factor behind its renewal. While CBS flirted with the idea of a fall premiere, it ultimately gave season 5 a summer broadcast to create momentum for &quot;The Amazing Race 6&quot; on the fall schedule.

This season introduced two major twists to &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;: the Yield and the non-elimination penalty. The Yield allowed one team to force another team to stop racing for a predetermined amount of time. The Yield was available on each leg, except the last two, although it was not shown on each episode. The non-elimination penalty required teams finishing last on non-elimination legs to be stripped of any money they had accumulated and, in addition, they received no money at the start of the next leg. This was also the first season to see the number of Fast Forwards reduced; only two were available in the entire season.

Filming for &quot;The Amazing Race 5&quot; began on January 30, 2004, and finished on February 27. This season traveled , which was the show&#x27;s longest route yet, covering six continents and twelve countries. The teams visited nine countries not previously seen on the show: Uruguay, Argentina, Russia, Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania, the United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, and Canada.

During pre-production, the producers moved the Dubai leg from the originally planned location of Istanbul, Turkey. Istanbul was eventually visited on &quot;The Amazing Race 7&quot;. Production also moved the legs in the Philippines from Japan, but Japan was eventually visited on &quot;The Amazing Race 9&quot;.

The Zorb task in Leg 10 was filmed at a New Zealand farm owned by a friend of host Phil Keoghan. Prior to the season, Keoghan experienced rolling in the Zorb and insisted it be a task on the show.

Marshall &amp; Lance were the first team in &quot;Amazing Race&quot; history to quit. When they arrived at the Roadblock site in Luxor, Egypt, after all of the other teams had already left, they decided to give up rather than complete the task.

==Cast==


After two seasons that featured twelve teams, the contestant pool this season was reduced to eleven teams. They included a dating widowed couple, female twins, a former &quot;Big Brother&quot; contestant, and a team member with dwarfism. Alison Irwin of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Big Brother 4&quot; was the first contestant from a previously aired reality show to take part in &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;.

Following this season, Colin &amp; Christie became engaged on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Early Show&quot;.
;Future appearances
Charla &amp; Mirna returned to compete in &quot;The Amazing Race: All-Stars&quot;. Colin &amp; Christie were also invited to participate in &quot;The Amazing Race: All-Stars&quot;, but had to decline due to Christie&#x27;s pregnancy. They later competed on &quot;The Amazing Race: Reality Showdown&quot; in 2019.

Alison Irwin later appeared on &quot;Big Brother: All Stars&quot;. In 2005, Chip, Kim, Charla, and Mirna all competed on the Bravo reality series &quot;Battle of the Network Reality Stars&quot;, along with twenty-eight other individuals from various reality series.

==Results==
The following teams are listed with their placements in each leg. Placements are listed in finishing order. 
*A placement with a dagger () indicates that the team was eliminated.

<text>was a town located in Tamatsukuri District, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan.

On March 31, 2006, Naruko, along with the city of Furukawa, the town of Iwadeyama (also from Tamatsukuri District), the towns of Kashimadai, Matsuyama and Sanbongi (all from Shida District), and the town of Tajiri (from Tōda District), to create the new city of Ōsaki. Tamatsukuri District and Shida District were dissolved as a result of this merger.

==Geography==
Nestled in the mountainous backbone of Tōhoku region, Naruko is located entirely within the Kurikoma Quasi-National Park. Haiku poet Matsuo Bashō passed through the area on the trip that became his masterwork &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;.

==Tourism and Sightseeing==
The volcanically active area is famous for the Naruko Hot Spring Villages (鳴子温泉郷), a cluster of five villages -- Naruko, East Naruko, Nakayamadaira, Kawatabi and Onikōbe -- with abundant hot springs. The reputed curative properties of the springs make them especially popular with people in ill health. Several ski resorts also operate nearby in the winter.

Naruko is one among many places to claim to have originated the &quot;kokeshi&quot;, a cylindrical wooden doll emblematic of Tōhoku. The Japan Kokeshi Museum is located in Naruko, and some 80 craftsmen work full-time at the art today.

==Transport==
Naruko is accessible by train on the JR East Rikuu East Line, some 40 minutes from Furukawa Station, where connections to Tokyo can be made via the Tōhoku Shinkansen. National Highways 47 and 108 also pass through the area.

== Demographics ==
In 2003, the town had an estimated population of 8,764 and a population density of 26.76 persons per km². The total area was 327.55 km².

<text>The Amazing Race 4 is the fourth season of the American reality competition show &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. Hosted by Phil Keoghan, it featured twelve teams of two, each with a pre-existing relationship, competing in a race around the world to win US$1,000,000. This season visited four continents and nine countries and traveled over during thirteen legs. Starting in Los Angeles, racers traveled through Italy, Austria, France, the Netherlands, India, Malaysia, South Korea, and Australia before returning to the United States, traveling through Hawaii, and finishing in Phoenix. The season premiered on CBS on May 29, 2003, and concluded on August 21, 2003.

Married couple Reichen Lehmkuhl and Chip Arndt were the winners of the season, while engaged couple Jon Corso and Kelly Parks finished in second place, and best friends David Dean and Jeff Strand finished in third place.

==Production==
===Development and filming===

The fourth season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; spanned across four continents and featured first-time visits to two countries: the Netherlands and South Korea. Filming for the show began on January 18, 2003, and finished on February 14.

===Casting===
Casting for this season began in late August 2002.

==Cast==

This season&#x27;s cast included a gay married couple, NFL wives, a pair of circus clowns, and air traffic controllers. The &quot;NFL Wives&quot;, Monica &amp; Sheree, were respectively married to Ashley Ambrose and Ray Buchanan, both of whom played for the Atlanta Falcons the season before the television series was filmed. At the time this season was filmed and broadcast, same-sex marriage had not yet been made legal in the United States. Reichen &amp; Chip were never legally married, although they were married in a religious ceremony. CBS decided for the purpose of the show to respect the fact that they recognized themselves as a married couple. Not long after the season ended, Reichen revealed that he and Chip had separated.

;Future appearances
In 2005, Reichen Lehmkuhl appeared on a &quot;Reality All-Stars&quot; episode of &quot;Fear Factor&quot;. Reichen also appeared as part of the cast of &quot;The A-List: New York&quot; in 2011. Monica &amp; Sheree, now both divorced, appeared on &quot;Atlanta Exes&quot; in 2014.

==Results==
The following teams are listed with their placements in each episode. Placements are listed in finishing order. 
*A placement with a dagger () indicates that the team was eliminated. 
*An placement with a double-dagger () indicates that the team was the last to arrive at a Pit Stop in a non-elimination leg.

* This season&#x27;s first Detour was a choice between Search or Rescue. In Search, teams would have had to use a locator beacon to find a beeper hidden somewhere in the snow, and then they&#x27;d have searched for a set of keys for a snowmobile that they could have driven to their next clue. In Rescue, teams crossed a traditional alpine rescue bridge of four steel cables. They then had to use a zipline to travel across the ravine in order to receive their next clue. All teams chose Rescue.

* This leg&#x27;s Detour was a choice between Waterway or Pathway. In Waterway, teams had to travel by gondola, using only a map to guide their gondolier, to the Campo Querini Stampalia, where they found their next clue. In Pathway, teams had to travel by foot through the city&#x27;s streets and bridges to the same plaza, but without a map, although they could ask for directions.
* This leg&#x27;s Fast Forward required one team to go to Campo San Vio and join a troupe of actors performing street theater known as &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; until the Fast Forward award appeared in the skit. Steve &amp; Dave won the Fast Forward.
*After the Detour, teams had to travel to the Palazzo da Mosto and wait for a masquerade ball to begin before receiving their next clue.
* In this season&#x27;s first Roadblock, one team member had to choose a picture of a Venetian mask, enter the Palazzo da Mosto, and search the rooms filled with masked revelers to find the one wearing the same mask shown in their photo, who gave them their next clue. If they chose incorrectly, the reveler took the photo and walked away, and the racer had to go back outside to wait to receive another photo, since only four contestants could enter the palace at a time.
*After the Roadblock, teams had to check in at the Pit Stop: the &quot;Citta di Padova&quot;, moored at the Venetian Lagoon.

<doc id="898147" wikidata="Q7844248" url="?curid=898147" title="Trisyllabic laxing">
<text>Trisyllabic laxing, or trisyllabic shortening, is any of three processes in English in which tense vowels (long vowels or diphthongs) become lax (short monophthongs) if they are followed by two or more syllables, at least the first of which is unstressed, for example, &quot;grateful&quot; vs &quot;gratitude&quot;, &quot;profound&quot; vs &quot;profundity&quot;.

By a different process, laxing is also found in disyllabic and monosyllabic words, for example, &quot;shade&quot; vs &quot;shadow&quot;, &quot;lose&quot; vs &quot;lost&quot;.

==Trisyllabic laxing==
Trisyllabic laxing is a process which has occurred at various periods in the history of English:
#The earliest occurrence of trisyllabic laxing occurred in late Old English and caused stressed long vowels to become shortened before clusters of two consonants when two or more syllables followed.
#Later in Middle English, the process was expanded to all vowels when two or more syllables followed.
#The Middle English sound change remained in the language and is still a mostly-productive process in Modern English, detailed in Chomsky and Halle&#x27;s &quot;The Sound Pattern of English&quot;.

The Middle English sound change occurred before the Great Vowel Shift and other changes to the nature of vowels. As a result of the changes, the pairs of vowels related by trisyllabic laxing often bear little resemblance to one another in Modern English; however, originally they always bore a consistent relationship. For example, tense was , and lax was at the time of trisyllabic laxing.

In some cases, trisyllabic laxing appears to take place when it should not have done so: for example, in &quot;south&quot; vs. &quot;southern&quot; . In such cases, the apparent anomaly is caused by later sound changes: &quot;southern&quot; (formerly &quot;southerne&quot;) was pronounced when trisyllabic laxing applied.

In the modern English language, there are systematic exceptions to the process, such as in words ending in &quot;-ness&quot;: &quot;mindfulness, loneliness&quot;. There are also occasional, non-systematic exceptions such as &quot;obese, obesity&quot; (, not *), although in this case the former was back-formed from the latter in the 19th century.

==Disyllabic laxing==
Several now-defunct Middle English phonological processes have created an irregular system of &quot;disyllabic laxing&quot;; unlike trisyllabic laxing which was one phonological change, apparent disyllabic laxing in Modern English is caused by many different sound changes:

* &quot;please&quot; → &quot;pleasant&quot; 
* &quot;shade&quot; → &quot;shadow&quot; 
: &quot;pale&quot; → &quot;pallid&quot; 
* &quot;child&quot; → &quot;children&quot; 
: &quot;dine&quot; → &quot;dinner&quot; 
: &quot;divide&quot; → &quot;division&quot; 
* &quot;south&quot; → &quot;southern&quot; 
: out&quot; → utter&quot; 
* &quot;goose&quot; → &quot;gosling&quot; 
: &quot;fool&quot; → &quot;folly&quot; 
: &quot;food&quot; → &quot;fodder&quot; 
* &quot;cone&quot; → &quot;conic&quot; (and other words in &quot;-ic&quot;)
: &quot;depose&quot; → &quot;deposit&quot; 

Many cases of disyllabic laxing are due, as in &quot;southern&quot; and &quot;shadow&quot; above, to Middle English having had more unstressed sounds than Modern English: &quot;sutherne&quot; , &quot;schadowe&quot; . Cases such as &quot;please&quot;, &quot;pleasant&quot; and &quot;dine&quot;, &quot;dinner&quot; come from how French words were adapted into Middle English: a stressed French vowel was borrowed into English as an equivalent long vowel. However, if the stressed English vowel was originally an unstressed vowel in French, the vowel was not lengthened; examples of this which did not create an alteration are Old French &quot;pitee&quot; → Middle English &quot;pite&quot; and Old French &quot;plais-&quot; (stem of &quot;plaire&quot;) → Middle English &quot;plesen&quot; , &quot;plaisant&quot; → &quot;plesaunt&quot; .

Some Latinate words, such as &quot;Saturn&quot;, have short vowels where from syllable structure one would expect a long vowel. Other cases differentiate British and American English, with more frequent disyllabic laxing in American English – compare RP and GA pronunciations of &quot;era&quot;, &quot;lever&quot;, &quot;patent&quot;, &quot;primer&quot; (book) and &quot;progress&quot; (noun), though there are exceptions such as &quot;leisure&quot;, &quot;produce&quot; (noun), &quot;Tethys&quot;, &quot;yogurt&quot; and &quot;zebra&quot; that have a short vowel in RP. On the other hand, American English is &quot;less&quot; likely to have trisyllabic laxing, for example in words such as &quot;dynasty&quot;, &quot;patronize&quot;, &quot;privacy&quot; and &quot;vitamin&quot;. Much of this irregularity is due to morphological leveling.

==Monosyllabic laxing==
Laxing also occurs in basic monosyllabic vocabulary, which presumably helps keep it active across generations. For example, the → shift occurs in the past-tense forms of basic verbs such as &quot;feel&quot;, &quot;keep&quot;, &quot;kneel&quot;, &quot;mean&quot;, &quot;sleep&quot;, &quot;sweep&quot;, &quot;weep&quot; and – without a suffix &quot;-t&quot; – in &quot;feed&quot;, &quot;lead&quot;, &quot;read&quot;. Other shifts occur in &quot;bite&quot; → &quot;bit&quot;, &quot;do&quot; → &quot;done&quot;, &quot;go&quot; → &quot;gone&quot;, &quot;hide&quot; → &quot;hid&quot;, &quot;lose&quot; → &quot;lost&quot;, &quot;shoot&quot; → &quot;shot&quot;, etc.

<doc id="898154" wikidata="Q6446029" url="?curid=898154" title="Kurikoma, Miyagi">
<text>was a town in Kurihara District, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. Established in 1955 with the consolidation of six municipalities, it was abolished in a merger forming the larger Kurihara City in 2005. The municipal area was 244.36 km2 and the population was 13,736 in 2005.

==Geography==
Kurikoma was located on the northwest border of Miyagi Prefecture with Iwate Prefecture and Akita Prefecture.

Kurikoma covered a narrow east–west area. Mount Kurikoma sat at the northwest border with Iwate Prefecture. It was the origin of the name of the municipality. The largest town of the area was Iwagasaki, which was 23 kilometers east of the mountain. Later Iwagasaki was often called Kurikoma because the municipal office was built there.

The western half of the municipality covered a part of the Ōu Mountains. This area is less populated but a ski and spa resort is located southeast of Mount Kurikoma. Two rivers, Nihasama and Sanhasama, run toward the southeast from the mountain. Both make valleys of 1 - 3 kilometers width on reaching the eastern area, which are mainly cultivated as rice fields. Iwagasaki is located on the north bank of Sanhasama River. Nihasama (Second Hasama), Sanhasama (Third Hasama) and Ichihasama (First Hasama) merge to form the Hasama River east of the former Kurikoma Town.

The eastern area was more populated than the west, but flatlands are limited to the above-mentioned valleys. The rest of the eastern half, especially almost all of the northeast quarter, was occupied by low hills of less than 500 meters height.

==History==
*April 1, 1955 - Kurikoma Town was established through the consolidation of Iwagasaki Town (岩ヶ崎町) and the villages of Omatsu (尾松村), Toyasaki (鳥矢崎村), Monji (文字村), Kurikoma (栗駒村) and Himematsu (姫松村).
*April 1, 2005 - Kurikoma Town was merged with the towns of Ichihasama (一迫町), Uguisuzawa (鶯沢町), Kannari (金成町), Shiwahime (志波姫町), Semine (瀬峰町), Takashimizu (高清水町), Tsukidate (築館町), Wakayanagi (若柳町) and the village of Hanayama (花山村) to form the new Kurihara City (栗原市).

<text>Sir James Shand (28 January 1908 – 23 December 2000) was a Scottish musician who played traditional Scottish dance music on the accordion. His signature tune was &quot;The Bluebell Polka&quot;.

==Life and career==
James Shand was born in East Wemyss in Fife, Scotland, son of a farm ploughman turned coal miner and one of nine children. The family soon moved to the burgh of Auchtermuchty. The town now boasts a larger than life-sized sculpture of Shand. His father was a skilled melodeon player. Jimmy started with the mouth organ and soon played the fiddle. At the age of 14 he had to leave school and go down the mines. He played at social events and competitions. His enthusiasm for motor-bikes turned into an advantage when he played for events all round Fife. In 1926, he did benefit gigs for striking miners and was consequently prevented from returning to colliery work. One day Shand and a friend were admiring the instruments in the window of a music shop in Dundee. His friend said: &quot;It wouldn&#x27;t cost you to try one,&quot; so Shand walked in and strapped on an accordion. The owner, Charles Forbes, heard Shand play and immediately offered him a job as travelling salesman and debt-collector. He soon acquired a van and drove all over the north of Scotland. He switched to the British chromatic button accordion, an instrument he stuck with for the rest of his life.

Being a keen motorcyclist, Shand was also an enthusiastic supporter and spectator at the annual Isle of Man TT races. He also sponsored a motorcycle road racer from Errol, Perthshire called Jack Gow, a multiple Scottish Motorcycle Racing champion and later a motorcycle dealer in Dundee. Jack Gow was the son of Andy Gow who drove the bus which transported the Shand tour. Shand&#x27;s interest in motorcycles began when a boyfriend of his sister had problems with his bike, which had broken down. Shand repaired it and was allowed to use it.

He failed an audition for the BBC because he kept time with his foot. At a time when gramophones were very much luxury items he made two records for the Regal Zonophone label in 1933. His career took off when he switched to making 78s for the Beltona label (1935–1940). Most of the Beltona recordings were solo, but he experimented with small bands. This boosted sales. He appeared in a promo film shown in cinemas. While the image showed his fingers moving in a blur, Shand was disappointed to hear the sound track playing a slow air. He was prevented from joining the RAF by a digestive disorder, and spent the war years in the Fire Service. On New Year&#x27;s Day morning in 1945 he made his first broadcast with &quot;Jimmy Shand and his Band&quot;. This was the first of many such BBC radio and television appearances.

==Works==
Soon after the war he became a full-time musician, and adopted a punishing life-style later adopted by rock bands. He would play Inverness one night, London the next night and still drive the van back to bed in Dundee. He took his trademark bald head, Buddy Holly spectacles and full kilted regalia, Scottish reels, jigs and strathspeys to Australia, New Zealand and North America, including Carnegie Hall in New York. Now on the EMI/ Parlophone label, he released one single per month in the mid 1950s, including his only top 20 hit in the UK Singles Chart – &quot;The Bluebell Polka&quot; (1955). It was produced by George Martin. He was awarded an MBE in 1962. This period is remembered affectionately by Richard Thompson, who played Shand tunes on his &quot;Henry the Human Fly&quot; and &quot;Strict Tempo!&quot; albums. Thompson&#x27;s Scottish father had been a keen Shand collector. In 1991, Thompson paid tribute to Shand with an original song, &quot;Don&#x27;t Sit on My Jimmy Shands&quot;, from his 1991 album &quot;Rumor and Sigh&quot;.
In 1972, Shand went into semi-retirement. From then he played only small venues in out-of-the-way places for a reduced fee. He was made a freeman of Auchtermuchty in 1974, North East Fife in 1980 and Fife in 1998. He became Sir Jimmy Shand in 1999. His portrait is in the Scottish National Gallery, close to Niel Gow. In 1983, he released a retrospective album with the cheeky title &quot;The First 50 Years&quot;. At the age of 88, he recorded an album and video with his son, &quot;Dancing with the Shands&quot;.

More than 330 compositions are credited to Jimmy Shand. He recorded more tracks than the Beatles and Elvis Presley combined. In 1985, British Rail named a locomotive &quot;Jimmy Shand&quot;. He was dissatisfied with the chromatic button-key accordions available on the market in the 1940s so he designed his own one. The Hohner company manufactured the &quot;Shand Morino&quot; until the 1970s. He is the only artist worldwide to have his name used by the Hohner company as a model name for a musical instrument. There is a biography &quot;The Jimmy Shand Story: The King of Scottish Dance Music&quot; by Ian Cameron (2001). A number of his older recordings have been re-released by Beltona Records.

Since the 1950s the crowd at Dunfermline Athletic F.C. have left the ground after the game to the sound of Shand&#x27;s &quot;The Bluebell Polka&quot;.
