<doc id="878569" wikidata="Q784338" url="?curid=878569" title="Marvels">
<text>Marvels is a four-issue miniseries comic book written by Kurt Busiek, painted by Alex Ross and edited by Marcus McLaurin. It was published by Marvel Comics in 1994.

Set in the 1939 to 1974 time period, the series examines the Marvel Universe, the collective setting of most of Marvel&#x27;s superhero series, from the perspective of an Everyman character, news photographer Phil Sheldon. The street-level series portrayed ordinary life in a world full of costumed superhumans, with each issue featuring events well known to readers of Marvel comics, as well as a variety of minute details and a retelling of the most famous events in the Marvel universe.

&quot;Marvels&quot; won multiple awards and established the careers of Busiek and Ross, who would both return to the &quot;everyday life in a superhero universe&quot; theme in the Image Comics (later Homage Comics and currently DC Comics) series, &quot;Astro City&quot;.

Warren Ellis&#x27;s &quot;Ruins&quot; returned to this theme in 1995 with a twisted story of an alternate universe in which everything that can go wrong does go wrong, but an actual sequel was not developed until 2008 with the release of &quot;Marvels: Eye of the Camera&quot;, but only Busiek was involved. A single issue epilogue was released in late 2019 with both Busiek and Ross returning.

==Publication history==
&quot;Marvels&quot; was a four-issue miniseries (cover dated January–April 1994) by writer Kurt Busiek, with painted art by Alex Ross and editing by Marcus McLaurin. It was followed by issue #0 (August 1994) containing a 12-page story of the original 1940s Human Torch by Busiek and Ross, two text articles, and 18 pages of Ross superhero pinups. The series was later collected into a trade-paperback edition.

== Plot ==
=== &quot;A Time of Marvels&quot; ===
In 1939, Jim Hammond, the original Human Torch is created by scientist Phineas T. Horton, and the project is considered a success until the android catches on fire when air is projected into its glass chamber, only to go out when the air is gone. Horton shows his creation to the public, which is met with demands from the terrified civilians to destroy it. A dejected Horton begins to bury the android, but the chamber cracks, allowing in air and enabling the Human Torch to escape. The android describes his appearance as the beginning of a &quot;golden age&quot;.

Meanwhile, Phil Sheldon, an aspiring photographer, and a young J. Jonah Jameson are shocked by the sudden emergence of multiple super-powered individuals, whom Sheldon dubs &quot;Marvels&quot;. Sheldon is more confused than Jameson by the spectacle and, worried, seeks the support of his fiancée, Doris Jacquet. More unusual beings begin to appear, notably Namor the Sub-Mariner, and fights erupt between him and the Human Torch. Sheldon, feeling it would be irresponsible for him to raise children in a world where these Marvels run rampant, breaks off his engagement with Doris. It is only when Captain America is unveiled to the world that Sheldon becomes less apprehensive about the Marvels. When World War II begins, Sheldon, Doris, and many others see the Marvels in newsreels joining forces with the Allies, providing public reassurance. After rekindling his romance with Doris, Sheldon hears that the Human Torch and Namor are fighting again, and the battle this time damages several New York City landmarks. During the fight, the duo come near but do not directly encounter Sheldon; he is knocked out by a small chunk of masonry and permanently blinded in his left eye. Still, he has lost all fears of the Marvels and goes on to marry Doris. Sheldon becomes a war correspondent in Europe, reporting on the Allied Forces and the Marvels as they combat the Nazis.

=== &quot;Monsters&quot; ===
In the early 1960s, Sheldon is now the father of two girls, Beth and Jennie, and he is preparing to write a book called &quot;Marvels&quot;. New York now has two superhero teams, the Fantastic Four and the Avengers. Sheldon is excited by recent news of the return of Captain America, a hero from his youth, but the public has begun to fear mutants, especially the mutant team known as the X-Men. As he covers an anti-mutant mob that comes face-to-face with the X-Men, he hears X-Men leader Cyclops refuse to engage with the mob, saying &quot;they&#x27;re not worth it&quot; and leaving. Sheldon, unsure of their meaning, finds the words staying with him. Despite the public&#x27;s distrust of the X-Men, some Marvels are treated as celebrities, as seen by Sheldon at the gala opening of Alicia Masters&#x27; sculptures, where gossip spreads over the upcoming marriage of the Fantastic Four&#x27;s Reed Richards and Susan Storm. Sheldon leaves the gala and rushes home after hearing about an anti-mutant mob near there, and he finds his daughters hiding their friend, a mutant girl with a skull-like head. Sheldon sees the importance of hiding this girl, but is worried for his family. Following the wedding, mutant-hunting robots called Sentinels are unleashed by Bolivar Trask during a televised debate with Charles Xavier; they malfunction and begin rampaging throughout the city. A mob forms in the chaos, attacking and destroying everything in sight, with only Sheldon helping the injured. The newly repaired Sentinels stop the mob, but Sheldon returns home to find the mutant girl gone.
=== &quot;Judgement Day&quot; ===
As the 1960s progress, Sheldon is preoccupied with his work, to the detriment of his family. The news is filled with stories of the Avengers being declared a menace, the law going after Tony Stark, sightings of Spider-Man, and a possible Judgement Day. The Silver Surfer appears to the world and defeats the Fantastic Four, heralding the appearance of Galactus. With the city in panic, Sheldon believes the Earth will end, and he returns home to be with his family in the final moments. Suddenly, news comes that the Fantastic Four have managed to defeat Galactus, saving the planet. In the wake of the team&#x27;s victory, Sheldon promises he will spend more time with his family. However, he is later disgusted by the way the public has again turned on the heroes, with Jameson (now the publisher of the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; and Sheldon&#x27;s most frequent employer) claiming that the Galactus threat was a hoax. Sheldon rages at a crowd carrying on an anti-mutant conversation.
=== &quot;The Day She Died&quot; ===
In the early 1970s, Sheldon publishes &quot;Marvels&quot;, which becomes an instant bestseller. He remains dismayed at the public&#x27;s reaction to the Marvels and is disgusted by Jameson and his screeds against Spider-Man, who has been framed for the death of NYPD Captain George Stacy. Sheldon resolves to investigate the murder and clear Spider-Man&#x27;s name. While talking to a witness with Luke Cage, he learns that not only do the police believe Spider-Man is innocent, but that they suspect Otto Octavius to be the real killer. Sheldon interviews Octavius, but he refuses to confess to the murder. Sheldon then interviews Stacy&#x27;s daughter Gwen and develops a friendship with her. Gwen&#x27;s admiration and trust in the Marvels gives Sheldon a sudden insight: the purpose of the Marvels is to protect innocents like Gwen. On his way to meet her at the apartment of her boyfriend, Peter Parker, Sheldon witnesses Gwen&#x27;s kidnapping by the Green Goblin. He follows the Goblin to the Brooklyn Bridge and a confrontation with Spider-Man. Watching their battle through a telephoto lens, Sheldon is certain that Spider-Man will defeat the villain and rescue Gwen. Instead, Gwen is knocked off the bridge and killed, and Sheldon&#x27;s faith in the Marvels is shattered. He plans to retire, but before he can hang up his camera, he has his assistant take a final photo of himself, Doris, and a &quot;nice, normal boy&quot; — Danny Ketch, who, unbeknownst to Sheldon, will grow up to become the demonic hero Ghost Rider.

=== &quot;Epilogue&quot; ===
During Christmas time in the mid-1970&#x27;s, Sheldon is with his daughters in Rockefeller Center when the Sentinels begin attacking. The X-Men, who were walking among the crowd, spring into action with Sheldon and his daughters left in awe at both Banshee and Storm. After the Sentinels are defeated, the cops try to monitor the situation when Nova, who admits that he is new, appears to help with any civilian casualties. Beth and Jennie ask their father if what occurred was anything like his old job, to which he answers positively, adding: &quot;It&#x27;s scary. It&#x27;s exciting. It&#x27;s thrilling. All of it at once&quot;. Having relived the thrill and earning the gumption to write another article, he resists and takes his daughters back home for the night.

==Collected editions==
In 1995, &quot;Marvels&quot; was compiled into a trade paperback that featured the Human Torch short story (2003 re-release ). For the tenth anniversary in 2004 Marvel released a 400-page hardcover (). In 2008 the original was reprinted as a hardcover () and softcover volume (by Panini Comics, ) and in 2012 as issue 15 of &quot;The Official Marvel Graphic Novel Collection&quot; as number 13.

==Sequels==
Marvel later published similar limited series under the &quot;Marvels&quot; header, with other writers and painters, though none of these titles were as successful as the original. They were collected in the paperback &quot;Marvels Companion&quot;.

In 1995, Marvel released the darker &quot;Ruins&quot; by writer Warren Ellis and painters Cliff and Terese Nielsen, which was a two-issue parallel world series in which Sheldon explored a Marvel Universe that had gone terribly wrong.

The 1997 miniseries &quot;Code of Honor&quot;, written by Chuck Dixon and painted by Tristan Shane and Brad Parker, had a similar approach to &quot;Marvels&quot;, following a police officer whose job is affected by the superheroes and villains. Busiek declared he and Ross debated on doing a &quot;Marvels&quot; sequel, only for Ross to bail out not wanting to draw Wolverine and the Punisher, and once the writer himself left the project, Busiek refitted the intended plot on &quot;The Dark Age&quot; arc of his title &quot;Astro City&quot;.

In 2008, the long-planned direct sequel, the six-part limited series &quot;Marvels: Eye of the Camera&quot;, began. It returns to Sheldon&#x27;s perspective, after his retirement. While Ross did not return for this sequel, Busiek returned as writer, with Roger Stern as co-writer for issues #3–6, with artwork by Jay Anacleto.

A new series titled &quot;The Marvels&quot; by Busiek debuted in April 2021.

==Related works==
===&quot;Kingdom Come&quot;===
Ross also did the artwork for the DC Comics mini-series &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;. Phil Sheldon makes a cameo at the superhero press conference held at the headquarters of the United Nations in &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; #2. He also makes an appearance in the last page of the epilogue in the &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; trade paperback. He is seated next to the Spectre in his civilian guise of Jim Corrigan and Norman McCay.

===&quot;Spider-Man: Blue&quot;===
Phil Sheldon is mentioned in Peter&#x27;s first scene in the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; in &quot;Spider-Man: Blue&quot;. J. Jonah Jameson requests Sheldon to cover the photo op of Harry Osborn in the hospital. He is reminded that &quot;Phil is covering the Tony Stark trial&quot;.

===&quot;Marvels X&quot;===
In the third issue of &quot;Marvels X&quot;, the prequel to &quot;Earth X&quot;, Phil Sheldon is mentioned.

==In other media==

Phil Sheldon makes a cameo appearance on &quot;The Super Hero Squad Show&quot; episode &quot;This Al Dente Earth!&quot;, voiced by Charlie Adler. He takes a picture of Iron Man, Silver Surfer, and Galactus after Silver Surfer convinces Galactus not to devour the Earth.

===Podcast===
In fall 2019, a radio drama podcast adaptation of &quot;Marvels&quot; was released with the first season focusing on the aftermath of the Fantastic Four&#x27;s battle with Galactus in New York City, New York, starring Clifford &quot;Method Man&quot; Smith as Ben Urich, AnnaSophia Robb as Marcia Hardesty, Ethan Peck as Reed Richards / Mister Fantastic, Seth Barrish as Phil Sheldon, Louisa Krause as Susan Storm / Invisible Woman, Jake Hart as Ben Grimm / The Thing, Ehad Berisha as Johnny Storm / Human Torch, Teo Rapp-Olsson as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, and Gabriela Ortega as Charlie Martinez.

<text>A savings and loan association (S&amp;L), or thrift institution, is a financial institution that specializes in accepting savings deposits and making mortgage and other loans. While the terms &quot;S&amp;L&quot; and &quot;thrift&quot; are mainly used in the United States, similar institutions in the United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries include building societies and trustee savings banks. They are often mutually held (often called mutual savings banks), meaning that the depositors and borrowers are members with voting rights, and have the ability to direct the financial and managerial goals of the organization like the members of a credit union or the policyholders of a mutual insurance company. While it is possible for an S&amp;L to be a joint-stock company, and even publicly traded, in such instances it is no longer truly a mutual association, and depositors and borrowers no longer have membership rights and managerial control. By law, thrifts can have no more than 20percent of their lending in commercial loans—their focus on mortgage and consumer loans makes them particularly vulnerable to housing downturns such as the deep one the U.S. experienced in 2007.

==Early history==

At the beginning of the 19th century, banking was still something only done by those who had assets or wealth that needed safekeeping. The first savings bank in the United States, the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society, was established on December 20, 1816, and by the 1830s, such institutions had become widespread.

In the United Kingdom, the first savings bank was founded in 1810 by Henry Duncan, the minister of Ruthwell Church in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. It is home to the Savings Bank Museum, in which there are records relating to the history of the savings bank movement in the United Kingdom, as well as family memorabilia relating to Henry Duncan and other prominent people of the surrounding area. However, the main type of institution similar to U.S. savings and loan associations in the United Kingdom is not the savings bank, but the building society and had existed since the 1770s.

==U.S. savings and loan in the 20th century==
The savings and loan association became a strong force in the early 20th century through assisting people with home ownership, through mortgage lending, and further assisting their members with basic saving and investing outlets, typically through passbook savings accounts and term certificates of deposit.

The savings and loan associations of this era were famously portrayed in the 1946 film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;.

===Mortgage lending===
The earliest mortgages were not offered by banks, but by insurance companies, and they differed greatly from the mortgage or home loan that is familiar today. Most early mortgages were short with some kind of balloon payment at the end of the term, or they were interest-only loans which did not pay anything toward the principal of the loan with each payment. As such, many people were either perpetually in debt in a continuous cycle of refinancing their home purchase, or they lost their home through foreclosure when they were unable to make the balloon payment at the end of the term of that loan.

The US Congress passed the Federal Home Loan Bank Act in 1932, during the Great Depression. It established the Federal Home Loan Bank and associated Federal Home Loan Bank Board to assist other banks in providing funding to offer long term, amortized loans for home purchases. The idea was to get banks involved in lending, not insurance companies, and to provide realistic loans which people could repay and gain full ownership of their homes.

Savings and loan associations sprang up all across the United States because there was low-cost funding available through the Federal Home Loan Bank Act.

===Further advantages===

Savings and loans were given a certain amount of preferential treatment by the Federal Reserve inasmuch as they were given the ability to pay higher interest rates on savings deposits compared to a regular commercial bank. This was known as Regulation Q (&quot;The Interest Rate Adjustment Act of 1966&quot;) and gave the S&amp;Ls 50 basis points above what banks could offer. The idea was that with marginally higher savings rates, savings and loans would attract more deposits that would allow them to continue to write more mortgage loans, which would keep the mortgage market liquid, and funds would always be available to potential borrowers.

However, savings and loans were not allowed to offer checking accounts until the late 1970s. This reduced the attractiveness of savings and loans to consumers, since it required consumers to hold accounts across multiple institutions in order to have access to both checking privileges and competitive savings rates.

In the 1980s, the situation changed. The United States Congress granted all thrifts in 1980, including savings and loan associations, the power to make consumer and commercial loans and to issue transaction accounts. The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act (DIDMCA) of 1980 was designed to help the banking industry to combat disintermediation of funds to higher-yielding non-deposit products such as money market mutual funds. It also allowed thrifts to make consumer loans up to 20 percent of their assets, issue credit cards, and provide negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts to consumers and nonprofit organizations. Over the next several years, this was followed by provisions that allowed banks and thrifts to offer a wide variety of new market-rate deposit products. For S&amp;Ls, this deregulation of one side of the balance sheet essentially led to more inherent interest rate risk inasmuch as they were funding long-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans with volatile shorter-term deposits.

In 1982, the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act was passed and increased the proportion of assets that thrifts could hold in consumer and commercial real estate loans and allowed thrifts to invest 5 percent of their assets in commercial, corporate, business, or agricultural loans until January 1, 1984, when this percentage increased to 10 percent.

===Decline===

During the savings and loan crisis, from 1986 to 1995, the number of federally insured savings and loan institutions in the United States declined from 3,234 to 1,645. Analysts mostly attribute this to unsound real estate lending. The market share of S&amp;Ls for single family mortgage loans went from 53% in 1975 to 30% in 1990.

The following is a detailed summary of the major causes for losses that hurt the S&amp;L business in the 1980s according to the United States League of Savings Associations:

# Lack of net worth for many institutions as they entered the 1980s, and a wholly inadequate net worth regulation.
# Decline in the effectiveness of Regulation Q in preserving the spread between the cost of money and the rate of return on assets, basically stemming from inflation and the accompanying increase in market interest rates.
# Inability to vary the return on assets with increases in the rate of interest required to be paid for deposits.
# Increased competition on the deposit gathering and mortgage origination sides of the business, with a sudden burst of new technology making possible a whole new way of conducting financial institutions generally and the mortgage business specifically.
# A rapid increase in investment powers of associations with passage of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act (the Garn-St Germain Act), and, more important, through state legislative enactments in a number of important and rapidly growing states. These introduced new risks and speculative opportunities which were difficult to administer. In many instances management lacked the ability or experience to evaluate them, or to administer large volumes of nonresidential construction loans.
# Elimination of regulations initially designed to prevent lending excesses and minimize failures. Regulatory relaxation permitted lending, directly and through participations, in distant loan markets on the promise of high returns. Lenders, however, were not familiar with these distant markets. It also permitted associations to participate extensively in speculative construction activities with builders and developers who had little or no financial stake in the projects.
# Fraud and insider transaction abuses, especially in the case of state-chartered and regulated thrifts, where regulatory supervision at the state level was lax, thinly-spread, and/or insufficient (e.g.: Texas, Arizona).
# A new type and generation of opportunistic savings and loan executives and owners — some of whom operated in a fraudulent manner — whose takeover of many institutions was facilitated by a change in FSLIC rules reducing the minimum number of stockholders of an insured association from 400 to one.
# Dereliction of duty on the part of the board of directors of some savings associations. This permitted management to make uncontrolled use of some new operating authority, while directors failed to control expenses and prohibit obvious conflict of interest situations.
# A virtual end of inflation in the American economy, together with overbuilding in multifamily, condominium-type residences and in commercial real estate in many cities. In addition, real estate values collapsed in the energy states — Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma particularly due to falling oil prices — and weakness occurred in the mining and agricultural sectors of the economy.
# Pressures felt by the management of many associations to restore net worth ratios. Anxious to improve earnings, they departed from their traditional lending practices into credits and markets involving higher risks, but with which they had little experience.
# The lack of appropriate, accurate, and effective evaluations of the savings and loan business by public accounting firms, security analysts, and the financial community.
# Organizational structure and supervisory laws, adequate for policing and controlling the business in the protected environment of the 1960s and 1970s, resulted in fatal delays and indecision in the examination/supervision process in the 1980s.
# Federal and state examination and supervisory staffs insufficient in number, experience, or ability to deal with the new world of savings and loan operations.
# The inability or unwillingness of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and its legal and supervisory staff to deal with problem institutions in a timely manner. Many institutions, which ultimately closed with big losses, were known problem cases for a year or more. Often, it appeared, political considerations delayed necessary supervisory action.

While not specifically identified above, a related specific factor was that S&amp;Ls and their lending management were often inexperienced with the complexities and risks associated with commercial and more complex loans as distinguished from their roots with &quot;simple&quot; home mortgage loans.

===Consequences of U.S. government acts and reforms===
As a result, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) dramatically changed the savings and loan industry and its federal regulation. Here are the highlights of this legislation, signed into law on August 9, 1989:

# The Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) were abolished.
# The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), a bureau of the United States Treasury Department, was created to charter, regulate, examine, and supervise savings institutions.
# The Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) was created as an independent agency to oversee the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks (also called district banks), formerly overseen by the FHLBB.
# The Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) replaced the FSLIC as an ongoing insurance fund for thrift institutions. (Like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), FSLIC was a permanent corporation that insured savings and loan accounts up to $100,000.) SAIF was administered by the FDIC alongside its sister fund for banks, Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) until 2006 when the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (effective February 2006) provided, among other provisions, that the two funds merge to constitute the Depositor Insurance Fund (DIF), which would continue to be administered by the FDIC.
# The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) was established to dispose of failed thrift institutions taken over by regulators after January 1, 1989.
# FIRREA gave both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae additional responsibility to support mortgages for low- and moderate-income families.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 had also eliminated the ability for investors to reduce regular wage income by so-called &quot;passive&quot; losses incurred from real estate investments, e.g., depreciation and interest deductions. This caused real estate value to decline as investors pulled out of this sector.

==Characteristics==

The most important purpose of savings and loan associations is to make mortgage loans on residential property. These organizations, which also are known as savings associations, building and loan associations, cooperative banks (in New England), and homestead associations (in Louisiana), are the primary source of financial assistance to a large segment of American homeowners. As home-financing institutions, they give primary attention to single-family residences and are equipped to make loans in this area.

Some of the most important characteristics of a savings and loan association are that:

# It is generally a locally owned and privately managed home financing institution.
# It receives individuals&#x27; savings and uses these funds to make long-term amortized loans to home purchasers.
# It makes loans for the construction, purchase, repair, or refinancing of houses.
# It is state or federally chartered.

===Differences from savings banks===
Accounts at savings banks were insured by the FDIC. When the Western Savings Bank of Philadelphia failed in 1982, it was the FDIC that arranged its absorption into the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society (PSFS). Savings banks were limited by law to only offer savings accounts and to make their income from mortgages and student loans. Savings banks could pay one-third of 1% higher interest on savings than could a commercial bank. PSFS circumvented this by offering &quot;payment order&quot; accounts which functioned as checking accounts and were processed through the Fidelity Bank of Pennsylvania. The rules were loosened so that savings banks could offer automobile loans, credit cards, and actual checking accounts. In time PSFS became a full commercial bank.

Accounts at savings and loans were insured by the FSLIC. Some savings and loans did become savings banks, such as First Federal Savings Bank of Pontiac in Michigan. What gave away their heritage was that their accounts continued to be insured by the FSLIC.

Savings and loans accepted deposits and used those deposits, along with other capital that was in their possession, to make loans. What was revolutionary was that the management of the savings and loan was determined by those that held deposits and in some instances had loans. The amount of influence in the management of the organization was determined based on the amount on deposit with the institution.

The overriding goal of the savings and loan association was to encourage savings and investment by common people and to give them access to a financial intermediary that otherwise had not been open to them in the past. The savings and loan was also there to provide loans for the purchase of large ticket items, usually homes, for worthy and responsible borrowers. The early savings and loans were in the business of &quot;neighbors helping neighbors&quot;.

<text>Whiston is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham in South Yorkshire, England. It has a population of 5,115, reducing to 5,042 at the 2011 Census.

Originally a small rural village between Sheffield and Rotherham, within the Saxon &quot;Shire of Hallun&quot; (Hallamshire), Whiston is now a suburb of Rotherham, close to its border with Sheffield.

According to &quot;A Dictionary of British Place-Names&quot;, the name Whiston comes from two Old English words &quot;wite&quot; and &quot;stan&quot; – meaning &quot;The whitestone&quot; which is likely to be in reference to a nearby quarry where large amounts of white stone were once mined. It is referred to as &quot;Witestan&quot;, in the Domesday Book of 1086, at which time it was part of the same manor as Handsworth (Handswrde), now a suburb of Sheffield. Close to Whiston is &quot;Blue Man&#x27;s Bower&quot;, a moated site and scheduled monument.

Even in 1900 Whiston was still a small rural village, separated from Rotherham by open countryside. As the century progressed, and particularly after 1945, many fields were built upon and Rotherham expanded to incorporate Whiston although there is still something of a green belt separating Whiston from other local villages

On 25 June 2007 part of the village was evacuated because of fears that cracks in the dam at Ulley reservoir could lead to widespread flooding in the valley.

The village has two cricket clubs, Whiston Parish Church CC and Whiston Forge CC.

The village football team, Whiston Wildcats, play in the Sheffield and District league. They are in the A division due to a B division promotion in the 2013/14 season.

2016 saw the founding of the village&#x27;s only cycling club – Sitwell Cycling Club – a British Cycling affiliated club for all ages. The club was crowned Rotherham Advertiser&#x27;s Sports Club of the Year in 2018. 2019 saw the club&#x27;s membership increase to over 150 members, making them the largest club in Rotherham. The club also started under 12s coaching, gaining British Cycling Go-Ride status in October of the same year.

<doc id="878585" wikidata="Q3306292" url="?curid=878585" title="Boscobel House">
<text>Boscobel House () is a Grade II* listed building in the parish of Boscobel in Shropshire. It has been, at various times, a farmhouse, a hunting lodge, and a holiday home; but it is most famous for its role in the escape of Charles II after the Battle of Worcester in 1651. Today it is managed by English Heritage.

==Location==
The building is just inside Shropshire, as is clear from all Ordnance Survey maps of the area, although part of the property boundary is contiguous with the Shropshire – Staffordshire border, and it has a Stafford post code. Boscobel is on land which belonged to White Ladies Priory in the Middle Ages, and at that time it was extra-parochial. The priory was often described as being at Brewood, which is in Staffordshire, and this may have contributed to the widespread belief that the house and priory are in Staffordshire. Brewood is the neighbouring parish, and the house is just south of the small village of Bishops Wood, a constituent part of Brewood. Although technically still a separate civil parish, Boscobel&#x27;s small population means it shares a parish council with Donington, Shropshire. Local government reform in 1974 brought the parish, including Boscobel House and White Ladies, into Bridgnorth District, which in 2009 was superseded by the new unitary authority of Shropshire Council. The nearest city is Wolverhampton. The house is just north of the M54 Motorway.

==History==

===Origins===
Boscobel House was created around 1632, when landowner John Giffard of White Ladies Priory converted a timber-framed farmhouse, built some time in the 16th century on the lands of White Ladies Priory, into a hunting lodge.

The priory and its estate, including the farmhouse site, had been leased from the Crown by William Skeffington of Wolverhampton at the Dissolution of the Monasteries about a century earlier. It passed into the Giffard family because Skeffington left it to his widow, Joan, and she subsequently married Edward Giffard, son of Sir John Giffard (died 1556) of Chillington Hall. The reversion was sold to William Whorwood in 1540, which made him the effective owner, but one of the early lessees must have paid off Whorwood, because it was later passed on to Edward Giffard&#x27;s heir, John.

John Giffard decided to make the farmhouse more useful by building a substantial extension to the south, including a living room and bedrooms more fitted to use by a gentry family. Giffard called the new hunting lodge Boscobel House. Thomas Blount (writing 1660), the main source for the events, portrays the naming as an after-dinner activity, and attributes it to Sir Basil Brook(e), a prominent recusant from Madeley, Shropshire, who was one of Giffard&#x27;s guests at the housewarming party. Boscobel is believed to come from the Italian phrase &quot;bosco bello&quot; meaning &quot;in the midst of fair woods&quot;: in 1632, Boscobel House was surrounded by dense woodlands. Also, the many branches of the Giffard family all claim ancestry from the lords of Bolbec or Bolebec and Longueville in Upper Normandy: Osbern de Bolebec became lord of Longueville in the early 11th century and his sons, Osbern Giffard and Gautier or Walter Giffard of Bolbec, were companions of William the Conqueror.

===Recusancy and the escape of Charles II===


The Giffard family were recusants – Catholics who refused to participate in the worship of the established Church of England. For them, this brought fines, imprisonment and discrimination; for priests it could mean barbarous execution. The Giffards took care to surround themselves with reliable retainers; until the mid-19th century, after Catholic Emancipation, their servants and tenants were mainly Catholic. The house itself served as a secret place for the shelter of Catholic priests, with at least one priest-hole. This secret purpose of the house was to play a key part in the history of the country. By 1651, when Boscobel played host to Charles II, it was owned by John Giffard&#x27;s heir, his daughter, Frances Cotton. Frances had married John Cotton, a Huntingdonshire squire, in 1633, but was a widow by this time. She was not resident at the time of the events that made Boscobel House one of the most evocative sites in the English royalist imagination. It was here that Charles II hid in a tree to escape discovery by Parliamentary soldiers during his escape after the Battle of Worcester.

Initially, Charles was led to White Ladies Priory by Charles Giffard, a cousin of the owner, and his servant Francis Yates, the only man subsequently executed for his part in the escape. There, the Penderel family, tenants and servants of the Giffard family, began to play important roles in guiding and caring for him. From White Ladies, Richard Penderel led Charles in an unsuccessful attempt to cross the Severn near Madeley, Shropshire. They were forced to retrace their steps and Charles took refuge at Boscobel, where he was met by Colonel William Careless, whose brother rented land from the Giffards at Broom Hall, Brewood. Careless and the King spent all day hiding in a nearby oak tree (which became known as The Royal Oak), from where he could see the patrols searching for him. Later Charles spent the night hiding in one of Boscobel&#x27;s priest holes. He was moved from Boscobel to Moseley Old Hall, another Catholic redoubt near Wolverhampton, and ultimately escaped the region posing as the servant of Jane Lane of Bentley, whose family were also landowners at Broom Hall and at the Hyde in Brewood. The Lanes, although friends and business partners of the Giffards, were not recusants but of Puritan sympathies and Jane&#x27;s brother, Colonel John Lane, had taken Parliament&#x27;s side in fighting around Wolverhampton during the Civil War.

===Subsequent history===
Frances Cotton, née Giffard, died shortly after these events, and both White Ladies and Boscobel passed via her daughter, Jane Cotton, who had married Basil Fitzherbert in 1648, to the Fitzherbert family of Norbury Hall, Derbyshire. The Fitzherberts were major landowners and let Boscobel as a farm to a succession of tenants, including several members of the Penderel family. Boscobel featured prominently in the Popish Plot: the informer Stephen Dugdale accused the guests who witnessed the Jesuit John Gavan taking his final vows there in 1678 of plotting treason, and several of them, including Gavan himself, were executed or imprisoned. The estate and Boscobel were sold to Walter Evans, a Derbyshire industrialist, in 1812, although the Fitzherbert family retained the White Ladies Priory site. It was the Evans family who restored the house and gardens, often in fanciful ways, and nourished the legend of Charles II. A substantial farm building was appended to the northern side of the house in the 19th century, giving the present house three distinct wings. It was sold to Orlando Bridgeman, 5th Earl of Bradford in 1918, who placed both it and the tree in the hands of the Ministry of Works in 1954. It passed via the Department of the Environment to English Heritage in 1984.

==Boscobel House today==

===House===
The three stages of building are readily apparent to the modern visitor. The 16th-century farm is clearly central and is easily distinguished from the 19th-century farm which adjoins it at right angles. The latter is brick-built but painted black and white to simulate timber framing. The main house, built by John Giffard around 1632, is mainly hidden behind the earlier and later structures on first approach. It is timber-framed, part brick, but covered in stucco, which was applied in the 18th century to cover up faults in the structure and materials. Its east and west ends are marked respectively by the bowed structure, probably originally housing the staircase, and the chimney stack.
The 19th-century farm today houses an introductory display, covering the escape of Charles II and the history of Boscobel. The 16th-century farm, known as the north range, houses an exhibition of dairy equipment, focussing on the butter and cheese making that were important here in the Victorian period. In 2011, the upper floor was opened to the public for the first time, allowing a much better appreciation of the construction and clearly showing the differing woodwork, indicating that the building was much altered even before John Giffard&#x27;s additions.

The western end of the north range is now separated off to provide the entrance hall and stairs for the main house, a change apparently made by the Evans family in the 19th century. The ground floor of John Giffard&#x27;s development is occupied largely by the Parlour, much-altered but containing a good deal of Jacobean panelling. The Victorian fireplace is surmounted by three black marble panels, each engraved to illustrate aspects of Charles&#x27; escape – two of them designed by a daughter of Walter Evans. Through the Parlour is the so-called Oratory, presented by the Evans family as a small prayer room, but probably where the 17th-century stairs were housed. This contains a portrait of Jane Penderel, known as Dame Joan, the matriarch of the family to whom Charles owed so much, and a chest, dated 1642, which appears to be mainly 19th-century work.

On the first floor of the main house is a bedroom known as the Squire&#x27;s Room. Between a fireplace and the bed is a door into a closet, which has a trapdoor into a small &quot;secret place&quot;, alleged to be a priest&#x27;s hole. However, the space appears to be both too small and too obvious, as chimney areas were known to make good hiding places. This floor also contains another bedroom, known as the White Room. Originally, the entire first floor was probably a single large room; in the 17th century large bedrooms were used socially, while the Victorians developed the modern notion of the bedroom as a private space.

The second floor is a large attic, divided into two spaces today. In the first, at the very top of the stairs, is a trapdoor opening into a more convincing priest hole. This is where Charles II is thought to have spent an uncomfortable night, as it is only 4 feet (1.2m) in height while he was very tall for the time, around 6 ft 2in (1.85m). Beyond this attic space is the Bower Room, used as a bedroom in the 19th century.


===Grounds===
North of the house lies a large farmyard, mostly surrounded by Victorian farm buildings, although there is a large 17th-century barn. The yard provides picnic space, as well as housing a display of Victorian farm machinery and equipment.

To the south are the formal gardens. First is a parterre hedged with box, laid out in recent times but occupying approximately the area of a box garden shown in 17th-century views of Boscobel. On its south-west corner is the Mount, a mound topped by a modern shelter, where Charles spent the day reading.

Beyond the formal area is a kitchen garden with an orchard of fruit trees. Alongside runs a walk flanked on both sides by hazelnut trees.

===The Royal Oak===
The Royal Oak stands about 150 yards (137m) south-west of the house, in a farmer&#x27;s field, but with an access path. It is believed to be a direct descendant of the original tree used by Charles and Careless to hide from the Parliamentary soldiers, although it has sometimes been presented as the actual tree. It has been surrounded by iron railings for many decades, but an outer wooden fence was added to protect visitors from falling timber after major cracks appeared in Autumn 2010. It has suffered badly from tourist depredations in the past, but its main threat is bad weather.

Three third generation descendants of the Royal Oak have been ceremonially planted nearby:
# In 1897, a tree was planted on the western edge of the garden of Boscobel House by Augustus Legge, then bishop of Lichfield, to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. 
# A further tree was planted ceremonially in 1951 near the site of the original Royal Oak by the Orlando Bridgeman, 5th Earl of Bradford, who was the owner of Boscobel House at the time, to mark the tercentenary of Charles II&#x27;s escape. 
# Another oak sapling grown from one of the Son&#x27;s acorns was planted in 2001 by Prince Charles.

<text>James Charles Heard (August 10, 1917 – September 27, 1988) was an American swing, bop, and blues drummer.

== Biography ==
Heard was born in Dayton, Ohio and was raised in Detroit, Michigan. As a young child, he performed as a tap dancer in amateur contests and vaudeville shows. Around the age of 11, Heard began to switch his focus to the drums. He started out teaching himself to play, then took lessons as a student at Cass Technical High School. His parents supported his interest, and brought him to see major performers who toured to Detroit&#x27;s music venues. He would later describe seeing Chick Webb play in 1937 as a formative experience.

Heard became a protege of the drummer Jo Jones, and through him would meet and sit in with Count Basie. With Jones&#x27;s help, Heard gained his first professional job with Teddy Wilson&#x27;s band in 1939. They played the Golden Gate Ballroom in Harlem and the Roseland Ballroom, and recorded for Columbia. After the Wilson band&#x27;s breakup, he went on to perform in bands led by Benny Carter, Louis Jordan, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Woody Herman, and Dizzy Gillespie. He also performed at major jazz festivals, and played alongside Roy Eldridge and Charlie Parker.

Heard&#x27;s style was a hybrid of swing and bop. He was known for his innovative techniques and the hard swing he would bring to both large and small bands. He recorded with Charles Mingus, Ray Brown, Billie Holiday, Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, Dinah Washington, Lena Horne, and Sarah Vaughan. He also led his own bands, including a quintet that played at Café Society and a trio with Erroll Garner and Oscar Pettiford. Heard performed as a featured member of Cab Calloway&#x27;s band from 1942-1945. As a member of the Calloway band, he appeared in several Hollywood films, including &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; (1943).

Heard toured with Norman Granz&#x27;s Jazz at the Philharmonic in the 1950s. After a successful engagement in Japan in 1953, he remained in the country for several years to perform and teach. He became a mentor to young musicians like Izumi Yukimura, George Kawaguchi and Franky Sakai. He also met and married his wife Hiroko while living in Japan.

After returning to New York in 1957, Heard played with the Coleman Hawkins-Roy Eldridge Quintet and with Teddy Wilson&#x27;s trio. In 1966, he moved to Detroit where he was a bandleader and a mentor to younger musicians. In 1983, he again recorded an album as leader, accompanied by saxophonist George Benson, pianist Claude Black, and Dave Young on bass. In 1981, Heard started a 13 piece big band which played around the state and at festivals, often featuring Dizzy Gillespie and other colleagues. This group recorded in 1986 and continued performing regularly until his death.

Heard died of a heart attack at the age of 71 in Royal Oak, Michigan. His legacy is honored with the yearly J.C. Heard JazzWeek@Wayne, held on the campus of Wayne State University, as part of the Detroit Jazz Festival.

<text>A savings bank is a financial institution that is not run on a profit-maximizing basis, and whose original or primary purpose is collecting deposits on savings accounts that are invested on a low-risk basis and receive interest. Savings banks have mostly existed as a separate category in Europe.

Savings banks originated in late-18th century Europe as a development of the Enlightenment, and became a Europe-wide phenomenon in the first half of the 19th century. The trajectories of savings bank systems then diverged across European nations, variously leading to the formation of integrated banking groups, cohesive national networks, conversion into cooperative banking or commercial banking entities, and/or piecemeal consolidation with other credit institutions. In most countries, the surviving savings banks have private-sector status and no longer operate under a distinctive legislative framework; significant exceptions include Germany and Luxembourg, where savings banks are public-sector entities.

==Naming==
In many European languages, savings banks are referred to by a word that differentiates them from banks (, , , , ) and denotes their more restricted scope of activity, sometimes translated as &quot;fund&quot;. That word has no direct equivalent in English; its etymology is identical with that of cash and it originally referred to a cash box, then a cash register.

==Overview==
The origin of savings banks lies in liberal and philanthropic aspirations that motivated their promoters to create non-profit establishments aimed at promoting a culture of thrift and financial prudence among the lower classes, and using savings and the logic of compound interest as an incentive to think beyond short-term living horizons. In France, savings banks projects started to emerge in the 1750s and multiplied during the French Revolution but with no lasting success. Liberal luminaries including Adam Smith, Thomas Robert Malthus and Jean-Baptiste Say took interest in the economic and social role of savings.

The oldest lasting savings bank is widely recognized to have been the established in Hamburg in 1778, followed by other endeavors in Germany and Switzerland in the late 18th century. Savings banks mushroomed in the early 19th century, with landmark establishments in Göttingen (1801, first municipal savings bank), Ruthwell, Scotland (1810, first in the United Kingdom), Boston (1816, first in the United States), Paris (1818, first in France), and Vienna (1819, first in the Austrian Empire). Even so, origin stories of the savings bank concept were long disputed. In 1914, the &quot;New Student&#x27;s Reference Work&quot; said of the origins of savings banks:
The original function of savings banks to service consumers was limited to savings, not borrowing, a foundational difference with cooperative banking which started developing a bit later during the 19th century. Savings banks were typically heavily regulated and supervised by local or national governments, and restricted to invest only in government debt or other instruments deemed of low financial risk. Over time, however, these distinctions have tended to erode, and over the 20th century the regulatory framework and business model of savings banks has largely converged with those of commercial banks, albeit with significant variations across jurisdictions. 

Starting in 1861 with the establishment of the British Post Office Savings Bank, savings banks were increasingly subject to competition from postal savings systems which similarly collected retail savings and invested them in safe government securities, albeit with variations across countries; some of the postal banks have themselves been called &quot;savings banks&quot;, e.g. the Rijkspostspaarbank in the Netherlands (est. 1881), the Caisse Nationale d&#x27;Épargne in France (est. 1882), the Austrian Postsparkasse and Hungarian Postal Savings Bank in Austria-Hungary (est. 1882 and 1886 respectively), the People&#x27;s Own Savings Bank in Zimbabwe (est. 1904, renamed in 1999), the Government Savings Bank in Thailand (est. 1913), the Caisse d&#x27;Épargne de Madagascar (est. 1918), and the National Savings Bank in Sri Lanka (est. 1971), and the Postal Savings Bank of China (est. 2007). 

After a long period of relative stability, including through two world wars and the European banking crisis of 1931 during which they were comparatively less affected than commercial banks, the savings banks came under increasing competitive pressure during the interest rate turmoil of the 1970s and underwent significant transformation and restructuring in many jurisdictions during the last quarter of the 20th century. By the early 21st century, savings banks were most significant in Germany and Spain, and to a lesser extent in Austria.

In Communist banking systems during the 20th century, monopolistic national retail banking networks were often labeled as savings banks. The label survives in the names of several significant Central and Eastern European commercial banks such as DSK Bank in Bulgaria, Česká spořitelna in Czechia, OTP Bank in Hungary, PKO Bank Polski in Poland, Sberbank in Russia, Slovenská sporiteľňa in Slovakia, and Oschadbank in Ukraine. Other non-European banks (other than postal savings systems or their successors) similarly named include the Botswana Savings Bank and in Sudan.

==By country==
By chronological order of inception (not including postal savings systems): 
* Germany: while the , est. 1778 in Hamburg, was a philanthropic endeavor, the dominant model for German savings banks has been sponsorship by local government, starting in Göttingen in 1801. In the early 20th century, savings banks created regional clearing entities, later known as Landesbanks, soon followed by the national Deutsche Girozentrale (est. 1918). The German savings banks sector is currently operating as a group with some centralized functions but decentralized organization, the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe which relies on a group-wide institutional protection scheme.
* Switzerland: an early savings bank () was established in Bern in 1787. The oldest one still extant is Sparkasse Schwyz (est. 1812). As of 2022, there were 59 forming a decentralized network.
* United Kingdom: the Ruthwell Savings Bank (est. 1810) is often referred to as the first British savings bank, with competing claims about the Tottenham Female Benefit Club and Children&#x27;s Bank (est. 1798 by philanthropist Priscilla Wakefield) and the Edinburgh Bank for Savings (est. 1814). In the 1970s and 1980s, surviving British savings banks consolidated into the Trustee Savings Bank, which merged with Lloyds Bank in 1995, was again spun off as TSB Bank in 2013, and was acquired by Spain&#x27;s Banco Sabadell in 2015.
* Denmark: Holsteinsborg Saving Bank was established in 1810 in Skælskør. The Danish savings banks established a common national entity, the , in 1949. Their number declined from over 500 in the 1930s to a bit above 100 by the late 1980s. In 1986-1991, Fællesbanken was dismantled and its components acquired respectively by Hafnia Insurance, Sydbank and Sparekassen Bikuben, the latter a major savings bank that was eventually merged into Danske Bank in 2000. The other major savings bank, , merged in 1990 into what in 2000 became Nordea. The remaining savings banks in 1993 joined other smaller Danish commercial and cooperative banks to form a single association of Local Banks, Savings Banks and Cooperative Banks in Denmark, or .
* Ireland: the first Irish trustee savings bank was founded in Waterford in 1816. By 1992, the trustee savings banks of Waterford and others in Cork, Dublin, Monaghan and Limerick had consolidated into TSB Bank, which was acquired in 2001 by Irish Life and Permanent and rebranded Permanent TSB.
* United States: mutual savings banks started with the Provident Institution for Savings in the Town of Boston (est. 1816), and were heavily concentrated in the Northeastern United States. They were decimated at the start of the savings and loan crisis in the early 1980s, and more mutual savings banks failed later in the 1980s and 1990s while other converted to joint-stock status. As of 2024, the oldest surviving mutual savings bank is Liberty Bank, established 1825 as Middletown Savings Bank. Federal savings banks are savings banks chartered at the federal level.
* Netherlands: the first Dutch savings bank ()) was established in 1817 in Workum; 1848 saw the creation of the . In 1907, the savings banks started to operate as a national network (). In 1979-1983 the largest Dutch savings banks merged to form which in the 1990s became a founding component of Fortis Group, itself dismantled in 2008 with the Dutch operations absorbed into ABN AMRO. Other savings banks merged into SNS Bank (for , ), later nationalized and renamed De Volksbank in 2017.
* France: following the Caisse d&#x27;Épargne de Paris (est. 1818), non-profit private-sector savings banks were created in numerous French towns and cities, and started developing a national organization of their own in the 1980s and 1990s. By legislation of 1999, the Groupe Caisse d&#x27;Épargne was converted into a cooperative banking group, which in 2009 merged with another cooperative group, Groupe Banque Populaire, to form Groupe BPCE.
* Austria: following the 1819 establishment of Erste Bank in Vienna, Austrian savings banks have developed first as philanthropic associations and later as local government-sponsored entities. The 1980s and 1990s saw multiple rounds of reform and the departure from the network of the largest savings bank, Vienna&#x27;s Zentralsparkasse, which eventually became part of UniCredit. As a result of these changes, the Sparkassengruppe Österreich operates largely as a single commercial banking group (and is supervised as such under European Banking Supervision), with Erste Group Bank as its central entity.
* Slovenia: the (, ) was established in 1820 and remained for some time the only financial institution in what is now Slovenia. The was established in 1889.
* Sweden: the first Swedish savings bank was established in 1820 in Gothenburg. During the Sweden financial crisis 1990–1994, a number of them merged in 1992 to form a commercial banking group that has been branded Swedbank since 2006. Dozens of other savings banks survive, such as Westra Wermlands Sparbank in Värmland County (est. 1856).
* Italy: starting with Cassa di Risparmio di Venezia (est. 1822), a number of savings banks () were established in the Italian parts of the Austrian Empire, followed by establishments in other Italian polities and after the unification of Italy. Italian savings banks never coalesced in a national network or group. In 1990, the legislation known as led to their conversion into joint-stock companies, with independent banking foundations as shareholders. This triggered significant consolidation in the 1990s and 2000s into larger commercial banking groups. For example, the savings banks of Rimini (est. 1840), La Spezia (1842), Parma (1859), and Piacenza (1860) have become part of Crédit Agricole Italia; those of Venice and Padua (1822), Milan (1823), Florence (1829), Prato (1830), Gorizia and Pistoia (1831), Spoleto (1836), Bologna (1837), Forlì (1839), Ascoli Piceno (1842), Civitavecchia (1847), Cuneo and Viterbo (1855), Foligno (1857), Calabria (1861), and (1949) have become part of Intesa Sanpaolo; those of Pisa (1834), Lucca (1835), Livorno (1836), and Alessandria (1838), have become part of Banco BPM; those of Ferrara (1838), Genoa (1846), and L&#x27;Aquila (1859) have become part of BPER Banca; and those of Verona (1825), Turin (1827), Rome (1836), Trieste (1842), Modena (1846), Reggio Emilia (1852), Sicily (1861), Treviso (1907), and Perugia (1908) have become part of UniCredit. As of early 2024, a few savings banks still exist as independent entities in Asti, Bolzano, Cento, Fermo, Fossano, Ravenna, Savigliano, and Volterra.
* Norway: the savings banks in Norway started with the establishment of that of Christiania in 1822. Still run decentrally, they have coalesced into two national networks, SpareBank 1 (est. 1996) and Eika Gruppen (est. 1997). All savings banks are members of the Norwegian Savings Banks Association.
* Finland: () was established in 1822 in Turku. The number of Finnish savings banks reached more than four hundred in the mid-20th century, but has decreased since then to only 16. Of these, 15 participate in the decentralized Savings Bank Group (, est. 2014) while the (based in Seinäjoki) is run independently.
* Czech Republic: the Česká spořitelna () was established in 1825 under the savings bank framework of the Austrian Empire. The savings banks in Czechoslovakia were consolidated in 1967 into a single State Savings Bank, then split in 1969 into a Czech and a Slovak components. In the post-Communist transition, Česká spořitelna was privatized and purchased in 2000 by Erste Group.
* Spain: the &quot;cajas de ahorros&quot; developed from 1835 legislation that emulated the French template. The 2008–2014 Spanish financial crisis triggered massive restructuring and consolidation, by which many savings banks were liquidated, purchased by commercial banks, or consolidated into four savings banks groups: CaixaBank, IberCaja, Kutxabank, and Unicaja.
* Hungary: the First National Savings Bank of Pest established in 1839-1840, was converted in 1844 into a joint-stock company. From then, Hungarian entities named &quot;savings bank&quot; were essentially indistinguishable from commercial banks. In 1949, the Communist authorities established the National Savings Bank (), later known as OTP Bank.
* Russia: in 1842, the Imperial government established savings banks in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. Like all Russian banks, savings banks disappeared under war communism in the first few years of the Russian Revolution. They were re-established in 1922-1923 as the State Labor Savings Banks System of the USSR. In 1991, the Russian network of the Soviet Savings Banks System was reorganized as Sberbank.
* Slovakia: the was established in 1842 in today&#x27;s Bratislava, followed by other savings bank foundations in what is now Slovakia throughout the 1840s. Today&#x27;s Slovenská sporiteľňa, like its Czech equivalent, results from the 1969 division of the State Savings Bank of Czechoslovakia. It was also purchased by Erste Group in 2001.
* Croatia: as in Hungary (with which Croatia was tied politically until World War I), &quot;savings banks&quot; were largely undistinguishable from commercial banks until the general destruction of the Croatian banking sector following World War II. These included the First Croatian Savings Bank (est. 1846) and City Savings Bank of Zagreb (est. 1913).
* Belgium: the Caisse Générale d&#x27;Épargne et de Retraite was created in two stages in 1850 and 1865 as a national savings institution. In the 1990s it was privatized and became part of Fortis Group, since 2008 itself part of BNP Paribas.
* New Zealand: The first trustee savings bank was the New Plymouth Savings Bank (est. 1850), later branded TSB. Savings banks as a legal category disappeared in 1987, being replaced with so-called registered banks.
* Luxembourg: the Caisse d&#x27;Épargne de l&#x27;État, also known as &quot;Spuerkeess&quot;, was established in 1856.
* Chile: the was established in 1858 for the specific benefit of government employees.
* Brazil: the () was established in 1861, and merged with other public institutions in 1967 to form Caixa Econômica Federal.
* Japan: the was established in 1880. The first national savings banks legislation was enacted in 1893, and by 1906 there were 486 savings banks in the country. Despite their inspiration by foreign models, Japanese savings banks had a more commercial or even speculative orientation, which led to widespread financial fragility among them. In 1921-1922, a long-delayed regulatory tightening led to all savings banks closing or merging into ordinary banks between then and the late 1940s, after which savings banks ceased to exist in Japan as a separate category. Several of the last remaining savings banks merged in May 1945 to form Japan Savings Bank Inc. (), which in 1948 renamed itself and eventually became part of Resona Holdings as the result of successive mergers and restructurings from 1991 to 2003. 
* Portugal: the () was established as a nationwide entity in 1880, and merged in 1885 with Caixa Geral de Depósitos.
* Romania: the (est. 1864) was renamed () in 1880 and in 1881 established a subsidiary named the Savings Bank (). It has remained state-owned and been branded CEC Bank since 2008.
* San Marino: the Cassa di Risparmio della Repubblica di San Marino was established in 1882.
* Panama: the was established in 1934 as a national public bank.
* Poland: the General Savings Bank () was established in 1950 on the basis of the former postal saving system, since then known as PKO Bank Polski.
* Peru: the () are microfinance institutions that have developed as municipally-owned public enterprises since 1982.
* Bulgaria: the State Savings Bank ( / DSK, est. 1951) has become DSK Bank, eventually purchased by Hungary&#x27;s OTP Bank in 2003.
* Ukraine: the State Specialized Commercial Savings Bank of Ukraine was established in 1991 from the former Savings Bank of the USSR, and converted in 1999 into a state-owned joint-stock bank, the State Savings Bank of Ukraine (), also known as Oschadbank.
* Albania: the Savings Bank of Albania () was established in 1992 and purchased in 2004 by Raiffeisen Bank International.
* Botswana: the Botswana Savings Bank was established in 1992 as a national public development bank.
* Sudan: the , a microfinance institution, was established in 1995 in Khartoum.
* North Macedonia: savings banks, such as (est. 1996) and (est. 1999), are licensed microfinance institutions.

==Representation==
The World Savings Banks Institute (WSBI), was created in 1924 in Milan, relocated in 1949 in Amsterdam and again in 1969 in Geneva and in 1994 in Brussels. Since then, the WSBI and the European Savings Banks Group (est. 1963) have operated as a single entity, representing savings banks on a European and global basis and serves as a forum to compare savings banks practices. Most of its non-European members are cooperative banks, public banks, or postal savings systems rather than savings banks in the original European sense.

<text>Star Trek is a text-based strategy video game based on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series (1966–69) and originally released in 1971. In the game, the player commands the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; on a mission to hunt down and destroy an invading fleet of Klingon warships. The player travels through the 64 quadrants of the galaxy to attack enemy ships with phasers and photon torpedoes in turn-based battles and refuel at starbases. The goal is to eliminate all enemies within a random time limit.

Mike Mayfield wrote the game in the BASIC programming language for the SDS Sigma 7 mainframe computer with the goal of creating a game like &quot;Spacewar!&quot; (1962) that could be played with a teleprinter instead of a graphical display. He then rewrote it for the HP 2000C minicomputer in 1972, and it was included in Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s public domain software catalog the following year. It was picked up from there by David H. Ahl, who ported it with Mary Cole to BASIC-PLUS and published the source code in the Digital Equipment Corporation &quot;Edu&quot; newsletter. It was republished with other computer games in his best-selling &quot;101 BASIC Computer Games&quot; book. Bob Leedom then expanded the game in 1974 into &quot;Super Star Trek&quot;.

Ahl left DEC and started &quot;Creative Computing&quot; magazine in 1974. He began porting the games from &quot;101&quot; to Microsoft BASIC, with the exception of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, where he ported Leedom&#x27;s version rather than Mayfield&#x27;s original. The result was released in 1978 under the new name &quot;BASIC Computer Games&quot;, just as the first microcomputers able to run the game were coming to market. &quot;BASIC Computer Games&quot; went on to become the first million-selling computer book, and versions of the game were available for almost all personal computers of the era. Additionally, dozens of variants and expansions were made for a variety of other systems, based either on Leedom&#x27;s or the original Mayfield versions.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Star Trek&quot; is a text-based strategy video game based on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series in which the player, controlling the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; starship, flies through the galaxy and hunts down Klingon warships within a time limit. The game starts with a short text description of the mission before allowing the player to enter commands. Each game starts with a different number of Klingons, friendly starbases, and stars spread throughout the galaxy. The galaxy is depicted as an 8-by-8 grid of &quot;quadrants&quot;. Each quadrant is further divided into an 8-by-8 grid of &quot;sectors&quot;. The number of stars, Klingons, and starbases in any one quadrant is set at the start of the game, but their exact position changes each time the player enters that quadrant.

The player can view a text-based map of the current quadrant by issuing the short-range scan command. Stars, Klingon ships, starbases, and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; itself are shown as text-based figures in a square grid; the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, for example, is represented with codice_1. The player can also use the long-range scan to print out a map of the quadrants lying directly around the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, with a list of the number of stars, Klingons, and starbases in each quadrant. The player moves between and within quadrants with the warp drive.

Klingon ships can be attacked with either phasers or photon torpedoes. Phasers do not have to be aimed, but their power and therefore damage amount falls off with distance, and the player must select how much power to put into each shot. Torpedoes do not suffer this drop in power and will destroy a Klingon ship with a single hit, but have to be aimed using polar coordinates. Later versions of the game expanded on this combat system by adding features such as Klingon ships moving after each shot if not destroyed, enemy attacks damaging systems such as scanners or shields, stars absorbing torpedoes that hit them, and a calculator to help in determining the proper angle to fire the torpedoes. Combat is turn-based, and Klingon ships will fire back at the player in their turn.

Movement, combat, and shields all drain the energy supply of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which can be restored by flying to a starbase. In some versions of the game, there are additional options for emergency situations, such as calling for help from a starbase, using the experimental Death Ray, loading raw dilithium crystals into the warp drive, or abandoning ship. Movement commands take up time depending on how far the player is moving. The game ends when the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is destroyed, all Klingons are destroyed, or the time limit runs out. A score in the form of a ranking is presented at the end of the game based on energy usage, damage taken and inflicted, and any remaining time.

==Development==

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===

In 1971, Mike Mayfield, then in his final year of high school, frequented a computer lab at the University of California, Irvine, while teaching himself how to program. The lab operated both a SDS Sigma 7 and a DEC PDP-10 mainframe computer. The PDP-10 hosted a copy of &quot;Spacewar!&quot;, a multiplayer space combat video game developed in 1962 in the early history of video games. Mayfield had gained illicit access to the Sigma 7 at the lab and wanted to create his own version of the game for the system. &quot;Spacewar!&quot; required a vector graphics display, however, and the Sigma 7 only had access to a non-graphical Teletype Model 33 ASR teleprinter.

Mayfield decided to create a game in the vein of &quot;Spacewar!&quot; that could be played on a teleprinter and brainstormed several ideas with his friends. As none of the group had much experience with computers, most of the ideas were unfeasible, but one concept he liked and thought was possible was a game based on &quot;Star Trek&quot;, then in syndication on television. The concept included the game printing a map of the galaxy and a map of the local star system, and phaser weapons whose attack power declined over distance. Mayfield began to program the game, creating a punched tape of the game at the end of each programming session and loading it back into the computer the next day. He worked on the game through the rest of the school year and into the summer after graduating.

Later that summer, Mayfield purchased an HP-35 calculator and often visited the local Hewlett-Packard sales office. The staff there offered to let him use the HP 2000C minicomputer at the office if he would create a version of his &quot;Star Trek&quot; game for it; as the version of the BASIC programming language on the computer was different from the Sigma 7, he elected to abandon the Sigma 7 version and rewrite the program from scratch. He completed it on October 20, 1972, and the game was added to the HP public domain Contributed Program library of software as &quot;STTR1&quot; in February 1973, with Mayfield attributing the game to Centerline Engineering, a company he was considering starting. It was also published in the People&#x27;s Computer Company newsletter, and republished in their collection book, &quot;What to Do After You Hit Return&quot; (1975).

David H. Ahl was an employee in the education department of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). He had begun the &quot;Edu&quot; newsletter where user-submitted games became a major draw. He and fellow employee Mary Cole ported &quot;STTR1&quot; to DEC&#x27;s BASIC-PLUS in the summer of 1973, with some additions, and he published this version in the newsletter. Ahl attributed the game to &quot;Mike Mayfield of Centerline Engineering and/or Custom Data&quot;. In late 1973, Ahl collected many of the game submissions in the book &quot;101 BASIC Computer Games&quot;, containing descriptions and the source code for many early mainframe games. &quot;101 BASIC Computer Games&quot; was a landmark title in computer games programming, and was a best-selling title with more than 10,000 copies sold — more copies than there were computers in existence at the time. As such, the BASIC ports of mainframe computer games included in the book were often more long-lived than their original versions or other mainframe computer games. He included &quot;Star Trek&quot; in the book as &quot;SPACWR&quot;, i.e. &quot;Space War&quot;.

===&quot;Super Star Trek&quot;===
In early 1974, Bob Leedom saw Ahl&#x27;s version of the game in &quot;101 BASIC Computer Games&quot; while working with a Data General Nova 800 minicomputer at Westinghouse Electric Corporation and, having never seen a &quot;Star Trek&quot; game before, started porting it to the system. After he got the game running, he began to expand it with suggestions from his friends. He changed the user interface, replacing the original game&#x27;s numeric codes with three-letter commands and adding status reports from show characters and names for the galaxy quadrants, and overhauled the gameplay, adding moving Klingon ships, navigation and fire control options, and an expanded library computer. Once it was completed, he wrote a letter to the People&#x27;s Computer Company newsletter describing the game.

Ahl, who by then had left DEC to start &quot;Creative Computing&quot; magazine, saw Leedom&#x27;s description in the newsletter and contacted him to publish the game in his magazine. Ahl ported it to Microsoft BASIC and published the source code of the game as &quot;Super Star Trek&quot; to distinguish it from the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; game, calling it &quot;by far the best&quot; version. He later included it under that name in the 1976 anthology &quot;The Best of Creative Computing&quot; as well as the 1978 edition of &quot;101 BASIC Computer Games&quot;, retitled &quot;BASIC Computer Games&quot;. He added a note that he had permission from the rights holders to use the show&#x27;s name in the title alongside a longer note written by Leedom explaining why the galaxy had 64 quadrants even though the term suggested there should only be four. &quot;BASIC Computer Games&quot; was the first million-selling computer book, giving Leedom&#x27;s version a much wider audience than Mayfield and Ahl&#x27;s original versions.

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;Star Trek&quot;, especially the &quot;Super Star Trek&quot; version, was immensely popular for the era. By 1975 it had spread to mainframes across the United States, and Ahl stated in 1978 in &quot;BASIC Computer Games&quot; that it was difficult to find a computer installation that did not contain a version of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. By 1980, &quot;Star Trek&quot; was described by Mark Herro in &quot;The Dragon&quot; magazine as &quot;one of the most popular (if not the most popular) computer games around&quot;, with &quot;literally scores of different versions of this game floating around&quot;. At least one published work of fiction that year mentioned the game, the short story &quot;Another Game of Spacewar&quot;, published in an anthology by &quot;Creative Computing&quot;. A 2013 overview of the game and its myriad versions in &quot;The Register&quot; by Tony Smith concluded that &quot;like most games of the period it was fun to play once or twice, but it lacked staying power.&quot; Regardless, for the players of the time period when it was released, it was &quot;a shiny new gateway to &#x27;strange new worlds&#x27;&quot;.

The widespread popularity of the game, especially &quot;Super Star Trek&quot;, along with the availability of the source code, led to numerous ports of both versions of the game for mainframe and microcomputers. Alternate versions of the game were also produced, based on &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Super Star Trek&quot;, or both. David Matuszek and Paul Reynolds wrote an expanded Fortran version of the original game as &quot;UT Super Star Trek&quot;; Eric Allman ported this version to the C programming language to become &quot;BSD Trek&quot;, which is still included in the Debian classic Unix games package. &quot;BYTE&quot; published a BASIC version by David Price in March 1977 that used the original command system based on numbers. In 1983 &quot;BYTE&quot; columnist Jerry Pournelle claimed to have written &quot;the world&#x27;s most complex &quot;Star Trek&quot; game&quot; in CBASIC. A shareware version for MS-DOS, &quot;EGATrek&quot;, was released in the late 1980s that replaced the original text-based screens with basic graphics that implemented a multi-paned display. In 2017, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; ranked &quot;EGATrek&quot; among the best &quot;Star Trek&quot; games.

Multiple commercial versions of the game were released in addition to the free ports. Apple Inc. released a version for the Apple II+ called &quot;Apple Trek&quot; in 1979, and Atari, Inc. released a version for the Atari 2600 as &quot;Stellar Track&quot; in 1980. The TRS-80 had at least three separate commercially available Star Trek games, including &quot;Trek-80&quot; by Processor Technology (later retitled &quot;Invasion Force&quot;) which added more interactivity and a number of new options incorporated from the unrelated &quot;Trek73&quot;, a second &quot;Trek-80&quot; by Judges Guild, and &quot;Startrek 3.5&quot; from Adventure International. Acornsoft released a version titled &quot;Galaxy&quot; for their computer systems, and Tandy Computers released &quot;Space Trek&quot; for theirs. Yet another version was written in BASICA for the IBM Personal Computer in 1982, &quot;Video Trek 88&quot;; written by Windmill Software, it used numbers for most commands, like the earlier &quot;BYTE&quot; version. Apex Software released &quot;TI-Trek&quot; for the TI-99/4A in 1983, which incorporates speech if the speech synthesizer is present. 1984&#x27;s &quot;Star Fleet I: The War Begins&quot; by Interstel was a variant released commercially for several computer systems. This game was successful enough to spawn a series.

Numerous hobby projects have continued to port the original game versions and enhanced variants to other languages and systems through to today. Additionally, some commercial games have been inspired by &quot;Star Trek&quot;, such as &quot;Star Raiders&quot; (1980), which was initially designed as a real time, 3D version of the game. As late as 1994, the collective &quot;Star Trek&quot; variants were still popular enough that &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; claimed that the otherwise unrelated &quot;Stellar Explorer&quot;″s gameplay was directly based on it, and that &quot;anyone who remembers the old &quot;Trek&quot; games[...] will know exactly what this game is all about&quot;.

<doc id="878617" wikidata="Q7394384" url="?curid=878617" title="SS Sir Walter Scott">
<text>SS &quot;Sir Walter Scott&quot; is a small steamship that has provided pleasure cruises and a ferry service on Loch Katrine in the scenic Trossachs of Scotland for more than a century, and is the only surviving screw steamer in regular passenger service in Scotland. She is named after the writer Walter Scott, who set his 1810 poem &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot;, and his 1818 novel &quot;Rob Roy&quot; around Loch Katrine.

In 1859 Loch Katrine became Glasgow&#x27;s main water supply, connected by aqueducts and tunnels to the city more than away through a hilly landscape. The Trossachs became very popular in the Victorian era, and there were early steamship services on the loch. The Loch is surrounded by wooded mountains, and has romantic historical connections including the birthplace of the outlaw Rob Roy MacGregor. Queen Victoria had a holiday house built overlooking the loch.

William Denny and Brothers built &quot;Sir Walter Scott&quot; as a &quot;knock-down&quot; ship; that is, the steamer was assembled with bolts and nuts at Denny&#x27;s shipyard at Dumbarton on the River Leven in 1899, launched and undertook performance trials in the Firth of Clyde, including recording her speed on the measured mile. She was then dismantled and the numbered pieces were transported by barge up Loch Lomond and overland by horse-drawn cart to Stronachlachar pier on Loch Katrine where the steamer was reassembled with permanent rivets and, in 1900, relaunched. The original cost was £4,269, which included a delivery charge of £2,028.
&quot;Sir Walter Scott&quot; measures 115 gross register tons, is long and has a beam. She is powered by the original three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engine made by Matthew Paul &amp; Company, Dumbarton, and has two locomotive-type boilers which until the end of 2007 were fired by solid fuel fed into the firebox by a stoker. At a time when most steamers changed to oil-fired boilers, &quot;Sir Walter Scott&quot; kept using solid fuel to meet the requirement of ensuring that Glasgow&#x27;s water supply was not polluted, changing from coal to coke to reduce air pollution. In a refit at the end of the 2007 season the boilers were altered to run on biofuel. During this refit, the superstructure was rebuilt and a forward deck cabin was added. The vessel has a crew of five.

&quot;Sir Walter Scott&quot; sails from Trossachs pier at the east end of the loch, northwest of Callander and runs a ferry service west along the loch to Stronachlachar pier. She runs in the morning at 10:30, taking walkers and cyclists who return by land. She then takes those embarking at the pier and those doing the round trip back to Trossachs pier. In the afternoon she also does one or more shorter scenic cruises. Between January and March the ship is taken up on a slipway for maintenance work. A second boat, &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot;, runs return trips to Stonachlachar in the summer months and also runs between January and March on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays.

<doc id="878628" wikidata="Q27907144" url="?curid=878628" title="Alice Brock">
<text>Alice May Brock (February 28, 1941 – November 21, 2024) was an American artist, author and restaurateur. A resident of Massachusetts for her entire adult life, Brock owned and operated three restaurants in the Berkshires—The Back Room, Take-Out Alice, and Alice&#x27;s at Avaloch—in succession between 1965 and 1979. The first of these was the subject of Arlo Guthrie&#x27;s 1967 song &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot;, which in turn inspired the 1969 film.

==Early life==
Brock was born Alice May Pelkey in Brooklyn, New York City. Her mother, Mary Pelkey, was a Jewish native of Brooklyn; her father, an Irish Catholic man, was originally from Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The Pelkey family was relatively well-to-do and often spent summers in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where Mr. Pelkey sold artwork for Peter Hunt. Neither of her parents were religious, but her family had many connections to Jewish culture and she herself variously identified as a Jew and as half-Jewish. She gave mixed opinions about her early life and parents, crediting her mother for a love of cooking and her father with encouraging her love of art and taking her out to new restaurants regularly as a child, while suggesting that her parents were not &quot;good parents&quot; and that her father was &quot;a bully,&quot; reasoning that her attachment to them was born more out of a people pleasing desire than familial love. She admitted being a difficult child who had never in her life been able to submit to authority, and continued to acknowledge a &quot;mean and opinionated&quot; side to her well into adulthood. After a stint in reform school, she graduated from the public high school in White Plains, New York. She attended Sarah Lawrence College. By her teen years, she had taken an interest in left-wing politics, and was registered with the Socialist Workers Party along with membership in the Students for a Democratic Society (as a founding member of that organization) and Fair Play for Cuba Committee. She dropped out of college after her sophomore year.

After leaving college, she spent a short period of time in Greenwich Village, where in 1960 she met, then married in 1962, Ray Brock, a woodworker from Hartfield, Virginia who was over a decade older than Alice. Alarmed at the radicalized environment, both Ray Brock and Mary Pelkey urged Alice to leave the area, and the Brocks and Pelkeys moved to her father&#x27;s hometown of Pittsfield, where Ray and Alice initially lived on Mary&#x27;s property. By June 1963, Mary had arranged for both to get hired at the Stockbridge School, with Ray working as a shop teacher and Alice as a librarian. With a gift from her mother, they purchased a deconsecrated church in Great Barrington, which the couple converted into a residence for themselves and a gathering place for friends and like-minded bohemians. She would later describe the choice of a church for the group as a form of sacrilege, using a symbol of tradition and established religion to further her counterculture values. In 1991, the long-neglected building was restored and transformed into The Guthrie Center at Old Trinity Church, an interfaith worship center and performance venue. During the summer of 1963, the Brocks worked at a hostel for youth in West Tisbury, Massachusetts, on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, before returning to the church in the fall for the school year and preparing the church to be livable.

===Littering incident===
One of the Brocks&#x27; students at the Stockbridge School had been Arlo Guthrie, at the time an aspiring forester, a half-Jewish New York transplant like Brock, and the son of then-ailing folk icon Woody Guthrie. When Arlo Guthrie left Rocky Mountain College in Montana for Thanksgiving break in November 1965, he stayed at the Brocks&#x27; residence for their annual Thanksgiving dinner. The Brocks had largely only lived in a small corner of the bell tower, and thus large amounts of debris remained from the previous owners in the sanctuary that they had planned to use for the dinner; as a favor to the couple, Guthrie and his friend Richard Robbins agreed to dispose of the debris, not realizing that the local dump was closed for the holiday. Guthrie and Robbins dumped their load over a cliff on private property. When Stockbridge chief of police William &quot;Obie&quot; Obanhein was made aware of the illegal dumping, he arrested Guthrie and Robbins. Brock bailed them out, and her anger at the incident nearly prompted Obanhein to arrest her as well. Brock was otherwise friendly with Obanhein, considering him &quot;a very sweet man, and [...] a very good cop.&quot; The turning point in their relations came after they had made the film. In the end, Guthrie and Robbins were levied a small fine and picked up the garbage that weekend.

==First restaurant==
Brock was persuaded to open a restaurant by her mother, who saw the purchase as an opportunity for her daughter to become financially independent. She had already been doing a significant amount of cooking and housekeeping for her friends at the church, which frustrated her. Alice purchased an empty business space in the back of a row of stores on US 7 in Stockbridge and converted it into The Back Room in 1965, shortly before the Guthrie visit. There is some dispute over exactly when The Back Room opened; Brock would claim in 2008 that it was not until after the littering incident, but Guthrie&#x27;s song about it implies the restaurant was already open by that time. At a jam session Guthrie had with the Brocks during his visit, he, Ray and Alice began formulating the basis for what would become the first half of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot;. (The second half of the song would come later.) Alice said of the finished product: &quot;The song is great, and it&#x27;s very funny. Arlo is very clever. It&#x27;s a lot of fun and it has a message of all the right things: of hope and music.&quot;

Brock would reflect on this restaurant&#x27;s opening as the breaking point in her marriage. According to her, because she was now living her life as an independent woman and needed her own transportation to work the restaurant, Ray no longer had financial control over her—prior to this he had only allotted her a small allowance—which increased tension between the two. Alice also admitted to not knowing much about either cooking at a professional level or business. Contrary to an implication made in the film about The Back Room, Alice says that she was faithful to Ray throughout the marriage and was not promiscuous; she did not sleep with Guthrie, for example. Guthrie also asserts that Alice was faithful to Ray in the final chorus of the song, noting a customer could &quot;get anything you want...excepting Alice&quot; at the restaurant, and his co-defendant, Richard Robbins, described the notion of Alice having affairs as being &quot;complete bull.&quot;

Brock closed the restaurant in April 1966 and moved to the Boston area with friends, in addition to spending some time in Puerto Rico. She would return to Great Barrington and reconcile with Ray shortly thereafter, complete with a large hippie wedding that was written into the film, but the two would divorce permanently in 1968. According to her, Ray was &quot;a bully, like my father.&quot; Ray returned to his home state of Virginia and died of a heart attack in 1979. There are no known remarriages or children after her divorce from Ray Brock; she commented in 2020 that she had a dim view of the nuclear family because very few of those she knew had healthy, close-knit family lives, and a statement from her caretaker upon her death implied no surviving direct next of kin, instead emphasizing Brock&#x27;s &quot;chosen family and friends.&quot; She did become a godmother to Richard Robbins&#x27;s son Jesse.

==Film==
Brock agreed to participate in the production of the film &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot;, including taking part in promotions and making cameo appearances in the film itself; unlike Guthrie and many other figures in the story, she declined an offer to portray herself in the film, and actress Pat Quinn played the role of Alice. Brock earned almost nothing from her promotional work and was dismayed after learning that Arthur Penn, the film&#x27;s director and co-writer, inserted fictional material into the story that she felt &quot;misrepresented me, embarrassed me, and made me into an object.&quot; She objected that &quot;I wasn&#x27;t sleeping with everybody in the world, for example—and not Arlo Guthrie! And I didn&#x27;t know anybody who shot heroin.&quot; Additionally, the surprise success of the song and the film made Brock an unwilling celebrity. She specifically cited the film as the source of her unwanted fame and stated in hindsight shortly after it was released that she should have done everything in her power to prevent the film from being produced. Penn, who lived in Stockbridge, had heard of the story from Brock&#x27;s father, who was on the board of directors at The Berkshire Playhouse, when the song was already out. Penn and co-writer Venable Herndon finished the screenplay in 1967 and the film was released in 1969. As of June 1970, Brock was living alone in a rented house in Lenox, Massachusetts, with plans to stay there long-term.

As a way to compensate Brock, one of the film&#x27;s producers arranged for her to write a cookbook, &quot;The Alice&#x27;s Restaurant Cookbook&quot;, published in 1969. Brock later admitted that many of the featured recipes were created by her and her mother specifically for the book, rather than having originated at the restaurant, and had not been tested before being published; she has made it a life philosophy to frequently experiment with new recipes. The book proved to be a moderate success and went through four printings.

== Proposed restaurants ==
Brock attempted to start an Alice&#x27;s Restaurant franchise in the late 1960s, but closed the first location in New York almost immediately when it failed a taste test. Brock also attempted to open another restaurant in partnership with Joan Woodruff in Lenox, Massachusetts. By June 1970, officials in Lenox had rejected the proposal, fearing that the fame behind the name would draw excessive numbers of hippies and disturb the peace. Brock—who blamed the film&#x27;s portrayal of her for the town&#x27;s decision while empathizing with their stance—pulled out, giving her menus and share in the proposed restaurant to Woodruff. In the meantime, Brock continued working as a caterer.

==Second restaurant==
The proceeds from the film and book sales (which netted $12,000 for her), coupled with her decision to sell the church in 1971, freed up Brock&#x27;s financial situation enough that she bought a former convenience store on Route 183 in Housatonic, Massachusetts, and converted it into Take-Out Alice, a walk-up food stand that, according to her, operated on the principle of serving &quot;slow food, cooked fast,&quot; while maintaining some alcohol sales to maintain the site&#x27;s liquor license. Take-Out Alice was considered to be Brock&#x27;s best and most well-received food service operation. After battling with town officials, in 1973 she was able to install seats in the facility, which she then renamed Alice&#x27;s Restaurant in an effort to capitalize on her fame.

==Third restaurant==
As the popularity of the restaurant outgrew its location, and admittedly acting on an impulse she did not fully understand nor remember, Brock bought an estate in Lenox at a price in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, which she converted into her third and final restaurant, Alice&#x27;s at Avaloch, in 1976. In contrast to her smaller, more intimate operations at the previous two restaurants, Alice&#x27;s at Avaloch boasted a disco floor, swimming pool and a performance venue in addition to increased seating. By early 1978, Alice&#x27;s at Avaloch was a substantial success that had made her wealthy, prompting her to display her wealth ostentatiously; an interview in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; remarked on the previously socialist Brock having suddenly turned more conservative. The location proved to be a major headache for Brock, as its infrastructure was not well-suited to an operation as large as the one she was running, at one point a severe snowstorm hit in the middle of spring, she had an admittedly &quot;picky, petty&quot; way of micromanaging the restaurant (continuing to make all the food from scratch even as the restaurant served hundreds of customers a day) and she again ran afoul of local town officials. As was typical of her life philosophy, she often used the restaurant for charitable purposes, offering jobs to those in need; this often backfired upon Brock, who at the time lamented the lack of work ethic her employees would often show by calling out of work for unnecessary reasons. Alice&#x27;s at Avaloch went out of business a year later, she had gone into substantial debt and partnered with other investors on the venture and allowed her creditors to foreclose upon the property. The loss of the property took her by surprise and left her bankrupt. The only remaining items she kept from her time in the Berkshires were a collection of quarters from the restaurant&#x27;s vending machines (which she used to rent her next apartment) and the folding table on which Guthrie had written &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot;. As of 2024, the former Alice&#x27;s at Avaloch facility is the Apple Tree Inn.

==Retirement and death==
Brock never intended to pursue a career in the restaurant business and expressed more interest in art. She did a few printings for an exhibition shortly before leaving the Berkshires, and all of them sold, further encouraging her to pursue it more seriously. After the closure of Alice&#x27;s at Avaloch, she relocated to Provincetown, where she set up an art studio. She spent most of the 1980s as a part-time prep cook for various restaurants in Provincetown before leaving the labor force in part because of a diagnosis of emphysema in the 1990s. A chronic cigarette smoker of up to three packs a day, she visited hypnotist Yefim Shubentsov in 1991, after which she never smoked again. Smoking and alcohol dependency were Brock&#x27;s two substantial vices; she was often visibly drunk during her time operating Alice&#x27;s at Avaloch and would regularly down a pint of whiskey every evening during that era, commenting to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that she never took hard drugs because &quot;I can (dr)ink and (function normally) but I can&#x27;t be stoned(.)&quot;

In 2014, Brock made a one-time appearance at the Dream Away Lodge in Becket, Massachusetts, where she and other chefs inspired by her prepared some of her old recipes. Brock&#x27;s personal favorite medium is rock art, a medium that she practiced most of her adult life; she was an active and early participant in the movement of painting rocks and encouraging people to hide them in unusual places to be found and relocated, what came to be known as The Kindness Rocks Project after another Cape Cod resident came up with a similar idea. Her home art gallery was located on Commercial Street overlooking Cape Cod. She continued to host a Thanksgiving dinner with her friends, either on Cape Cod or, less commonly, the Berkshires. Her 2022 dinner was hosted at the home of Richard Robbins, who had helped Guthrie dispose of Brock&#x27;s garbage in 1965 and still lives in Housatonic; Guthrie visited the dinner, reuniting the three for their first Thanksgiving dinner together in 57 years. She and Guthrie had remained friends throughout the rest of her life, with the two regularly reuniting for the &quot;occasional meal&quot; when his schedule allowed.

In addition to the &quot;Cookbook&quot;, Brock authored two other books: her 1976 autobiography &quot;My Life as a Restaurant&quot; and a children&#x27;s book, &quot;How to Massage Your Cat&quot;. She also illustrated another children&#x27;s book, &quot;Mooses Come Walking&quot;, written by Arlo Guthrie.

Brock initially bristled at the fame that the song and (in particular) film had brought upon her—recalling that she had an &quot;inherent aversion&quot; to nostalgia and fearing that her fame had proverbially frozen her in time—but later came to appreciate her role as an icon of the 1960s. She resented how the film portrayed her yet stated that the joy people get when meeting her in person is an honor: &quot;How can you resent that?&quot; She recalled in 2022 feeling guilt at being upset at her association with the song after seeing how well she was respected by fans of the song: &quot;What [...] is wrong with me? How lucky can I be?&quot;

Brock&#x27;s financial and physical health declined in the late 2010s. Declining artwork sales forced her to sell her home in 2017, after which she moved in with a friend who died shortly thereafter. Worsening chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease forced her to enter a nursing home in 2018, while an essential tremor prevented her from drawing the artwork that had been her primary source of income. Viki Merrick, a public radio producer (The Moth) and former bartender at Alice&#x27;s at Avaloch, served as Brock&#x27;s caretaker. Dini Lamot and other friends in the music and arts communities organized fundraisers for her so that she could afford the approximately $60,000 per year she needed to remain in Provincetown. NPR reported on Brock&#x27;s medical and financial problems in a feature on Thanksgiving Day 2020, prompting $180,000 in donations. That same year, Brock recorded a custom series of introductions to &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; for stations that regularly play the song on Thanksgiving. For the remainder of her life, she resided in the West End of Provincetown. As she neared death in early November, Brock entered into discussions with Guthrie (who announced the news) and his daughter Annie to put together an exhibit on Brock&#x27;s life for the Guthrie Center.

Brock died at a hospice facility in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, on November 21, 2024, of &quot;heart-related problems&quot; at the age of 83.

== Other/imitator ==
The Alice&#x27;s Restaurant of Sky Londa, California, has no association with Alice Brock. It was founded by Alice Taylor at the same time Brock opened up The Back Room, then converted into a tourist trap by subsequent owners capitalizing on the similarity in name (eventually adding a &quot;Group W bench&quot; in homage to the Guthrie song).

<text>John Bradshaw (12 July 1602 – 31 October 1659) was an English jurist. He is most notable for his role as President of the High Court of Justice for the trial of King Charles I and as the first Lord President of the Council of State of the English Commonwealth.

==Early life==
John Bradshaw, the second son of Henry Bradshaw and Catherine Winnington, was born in 1602 probably at Wybersley (Wyberslegh) Hall in the village of High Lane near Stockport, Cheshire, or possibly at the nearby Peace Farm, Marple (his father farmed at both) and baptised on 10 December in Stockport Church. As a child he attended the free school at Stockport, as well as schools in Bunbury and Middleton. During his teenage years he also attended The King&#x27;s School, Macclesfield. According to local tradition he wrote the following inscription on a gravestone at either Macclesfield or Bunbury:
:&quot;My brother Henry must heir the land,
:My brother Frank must be at his command;
:Whilst I, poor Jack, will do that
:That all the world will wonder at!&quot;

He was articled as clerk to an attorney in Congleton. The White Lion public house bears a blue plaque, placed by the Congleton Civic Society, which reads: &quot;The White Lion, built 16–17th century. Said to have housed the attorney&#x27;s office where John Bradshaw, regicide, served his articles.&quot;

After studying English law in London, he was called to the bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn on 23 April 1627. He served on the provincial bar of Congleton until he became mayor in 1637. John Milton wrote highly of Bradshaw&#x27;s aptitude during his public service, saying that &quot;All his early life he was sedulously employed in making himself acquainted with the laws of the country; he then practised with singular success and reputation at the bar.&quot;

On 3 January 1638 he was married to Mary, a daughter of Thomas Marbury.

At some time between 1640 and 1643, Bradshaw moved from Congleton to Basinghall Street in London. In 1643, he was elected judge of the London sheriff&#x27;s court. He maintained the post until his death. Following the death of the Earl of Essex in 1646, Parliament voted Somerhill House to Bradshaw. He was appointed a serjeant-at-law by Parliament and in 1648 Chief Justice of Chester and North Wales.

==Trial of the King==
In 1649, he was made president of the parliamentary commission to try the king. Other lawyers of greater prominence had refused the position.

Bradshaw was a controversial choice as Lord President, and opinions of his efficiency as a judge varied. Bulstrode Whitelocke believed that he was &quot;learned in his profession,&quot; but Thomas Fuller dismissed him as a man &quot;of execrable memory, of whom nothing good is remembered.&quot; The King himself, as well as much of the court, professed to having never heard of him.

Bradshaw himself did not attend court until the third session after his appointment, apologising on the grounds that he had been out of London and disavowed his ability to perform &quot;so important a task.&quot; While he served as the Lord President, he was flanked by an impressive personal guard and carried a sword at his side. He wore scarlet robes and a &quot;broad-brimmed, bullet-proof beaver hat, which he had covered over with velvet and lined it with steel and he also wore armour underneath his robes.&quot; King Charles refused to recognise the authority of the court and would not plead. After declaring Charles I guilty as a &quot;Tyrant, Traitor, Murderer, and a public enemy,&quot; Bradshaw did not allow the king any final words. Under English law, a condemned prisoner was no longer alive and therefore did not have the right to speak, and Bradshaw followed this tradition strictly.

It is said that he dined at Odstone Hall in Leicestershire, then his property, after signing the warrant for the king&#x27;s execution in 1649.

==Commonwealth and Protectorate==

On 12 March 1649, Bradshaw was elected President of the Council of State, which was to act as the Executive of the country&#x27;s government in place of the King and the Privy Council. 
From 1 August 1649, Bradshaw also held the post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. As Lord President he conducted trials of leading Royalists and condemned to death by beheading the Duke of Hamilton, Lord Capell, the Earl of Holland and Eusebius Andrews, for which he was well rewarded.

After wars in Scotland and Ireland, the Long Parliament had still not dissolved itself or called for re-elections. On 30 April 1653, Oliver Cromwell declared Parliament and the Council dissolved and soon assumed rule as Lord Protector calling elections for a new Parliament himself. After that date Bradshaw served as commissioner of the Duchy, jointly with Thomas Fell, until mounting differences with Cromwell culminated in his resignation in 1654.

Bradshaw, an ardent Republican, became an opponent of the Protectorate. In 1654, he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Stafford and Cheshire, but because he refused to sign the recognition pledge put on Members to declare their recognition of the new army-backed government, he took no seat for either constituency. In 1655, the Major-General in charge of Cheshire, Tobias Bridge, persuaded leading gentry not to enter Bradshaw as the county&#x27;s parliamentary candidate at elections to the next parliament.

After Oliver Cromwell died in 1658, his son Richard succeeded him as Lord Protector and reinstated Bradshaw as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Bradshaw was elected MP for Cheshire in the Third Protectorate Parliament in 1659. During the same year, Bradshaw moved to Westminster after falling dangerously ill with a &#x27;quartan ague&#x27; or malaria.

In October 1659, various subordinate members of the army sabotaged General Lambert&#x27;s and General Ludlow&#x27;s support of the Long Parliament. Colonel Morley, Major Grimes, and Colonel Sydenham eventually gained their points, and placed guards both by land and water, to hinder the members of Parliament from approaching the House. During these disorders, the Council of State still assembled at the usual place and the:

He died on 31 October 1659, aged 57. He was buried with great honours at Westminster Abbey. The eulogy was given by John Rowe. On his deathbed Bradshaw said that if called upon to try the King again he would be &quot;the first man in England to do it&quot;.

==Posthumous execution==
Charles II returned to power in 1660. On 30 January 1661, the twelfth anniversary of the regicide, the bodies of Bradshaw, Cromwell and Henry Ireton were ordered to be exhumed and displayed in chains all day on the gallows at Tyburn. At sunset, the three bodies that had been displayed publicly as those of the three judges being executed posthumously were all beheaded. The bodies were thrown into a common pit and the heads displayed on pikes at Westminster Hall. Samuel Pepys wrote in his diary that he saw the heads there on 5 February. The body of Bradshaw&#x27;s wife was also exhumed from Westminster Abbey and, along with the remains of other Parliamentarians buried at Westminster, reburied in a common pit at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster.

==Jamaica connection==
Some sources claim that the body of Bradshaw had previously been removed by his son, James or John Bradshaw, who re-buried his father&#x27;s remains on a hill near Martha&#x27;s Brae on Jamaica and marked the spot with a cannon. A location now known as &quot;Gun Hill&quot; is 2.5 miles south-west of the northern port city of Falmouth, in Trelawny Parish. One of the three men had children who removed to Highland County, Virginia. James Bradshaw acquired the land in Jamaica where his father&#x27;s remains were buried. Several sources recorded an inscription with the cannon found on Gun Hill, Jamaica, and attribute the quote &quot;Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God&quot; to John Bradshaw.

==Legacy==

While some political philosophers have defended Bradshaw, most legal authorities have taken the view expressed in 1999 by Michael Kirby (then a Justice of the High Court of Australia) that the High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I, of which Bradshaw was president, was illegal. However, in his 2005 book &quot;The Tyrannicide Brief&quot; (a biography of John Cook, the prosecutor at the trial), Geoffrey Robertson Q.C. put forward the argument that while the court was illegal due to the political settlement reached at the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, the trial anticipated the developments in humanitarian law in the second half of the 20th century, and that the leading participants in the trial are to be admired rather than condemned.

==Bradshaw in popular culture==
* Bradshaw was played by Stratford Johns in the 1970 historical drama film &quot;Cromwell&quot;.
* Bradshaw appears in several short stories set in the alternative history &quot;1632 Series.&quot; In that series, King Charles discovers his future fate by reading books brought to the past in the time-displaced town of Grantville and orders the arrest and execution of almost everyone who would later have been involved in his trial and execution. In one story, John Milton is told by his father that Bradshaw has been executed, but several other stories say that Bradshaw escaped from England and journeyed to Grantville, becoming one of the town&#x27;s junior district attorneys, and becoming part of a government-in-exile that plots to overthrow Charles and his tyrannical ministers.

<doc id="878639" wikidata="Q4697619" url="?curid=878639" title="Air-Sea War – Battle">
<text>Air-Sea War and Battle are two games that were released together as the fourth cartridge in the official Philips line of games for the Philips Videopac. In North America, the same game was released as Armored Encounter! / Subchase! for the Magnavox Odyssey² console.

==&quot;Air-Sea War&quot;==
This was one of the more premium releases, along with Wall Street Fortune and Quest for the Rings, that was released with a Board, pawns, and a video cartridge in a video/board hybrid release. The board was not offered in the United States.

Air-Sea War is a two-player game with player one controlling an aeroplane which is constantly moving from the right to the left of the screen while trying to drop bombs onto a boat controlled by player two, which is moving from left to right, and trying to fire missiles up at the plane. Both the bombs and missiles can be controlled after firing. There are also two neutral craft in the water. A point is added for each hit on the enemy, and one is deducted for each hit on a neutral craft, although scores can never be in the negatives. The player with the most points at the end of three minutes is the winner.

Similar to &quot;Risk&quot;, a copyrighted board game, there was a board in the premium packaging which allowed tracking and movement as lands were conquered; countries were &#x27;occupied&#x27;, and conflicts &#x27;settled&#x27; with the video screen battle of tank to tank, tank to sea, tank to air, air to tank, air to sea, or air to air.

==&quot;Battle&quot;==

Battle is also a two-player game, where each player controls a tank around walls and mines, with the aim being to fire the most shots on opponent&#x27;s tank in three minutes while using a supply of 20 rounds. A point is deducted for hitting a mine, but scores never drop below zero. Multiple modes could be chosen with differing layouts of walls, the option of having mines or not and the option of being able to guide projectiles or not. The game is inspired by Atari&#x27;s &quot;Combat&quot;.

<text>The Sand Springs Range is a short mountain range located in western Nevada in the United States within the Great Basin. It is approximately long and is in Churchill County. It separates Salt Wells (to the west) from Fairview Valley (to the east). To the north, it is separated from the Stillwater Range by Sand Springs Pass. To the south is Gabbs Valley.

The Sand Springs Range was the site of Project Shoal, an underground nuclear test conducted as part of the Vela Uniform program. &quot;Shoal&quot; was a 12 kiloton device which was detonated below ground on October 26, 1963. As the area experienced a series of large earthquakes in 1954, seismic traces for the events could be compared to help differentiate future Soviet underground nuclear tests from earthquakes. The site is unrestricted and unmarked. No surface crater was formed, and the casual observer will find little evidence that the event ever took place.

The Sand Springs Range also has several large military radar installations. These are associated with the bombing range in Fairview Valley, the electronic warfare range in Dixie Valley, and Naval Air Station Fallon.

The most prominent peak in the Sand Springs Range is Big Kasock Mountain at an elevation of .

<doc id="878643" wikidata="Q129041" url="?curid=878643" title="Carmelo Anthony">
<text>Carmelo Kyam Anthony ( ; born May 29, 1984) is an American former professional basketball player. Anthony played 19 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as well as being an ten-time NBA All-Star and six-time All-NBA Team member. He played college basketball for the Syracuse Orange, winning a national championship as a freshman in 2003 while being named the NCAA Tournament&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player. In 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team, and is regarded as one of the greatest scorers in NBA history.

After one season at Syracuse, Anthony entered the 2003 NBA draft and was selected with the third overall pick by the Denver Nuggets. While playing for Denver, he led the Nuggets to the playoffs every year from 2004 to 2010; the team won two division titles in that span. In 2009, Anthony led the Nuggets to their first conference finals appearance since 1985. In 2011, he was traded from Denver to the New York Knicks days before the NBA trade deadline. In a January 24, 2014 game against the Charlotte Bobcats, Anthony scored a career-high 62 points, setting a Knicks&#x27; single-game scoring record and a Madison Square Garden single-game scoring record. Anthony was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder, where he played one season before a short stint with the Houston Rockets. He spent two seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers prior to joining the Los Angeles Lakers.

Anthony has played in the Olympics for the US national team a record four times, winning a bronze medal with the 2004 squad and gold medals on the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Olympic teams. As of April 2016, he was the US Olympic team&#x27;s all-time leader in points, rebounds, and games played. He currently ranks tenth among NBA career scoring leaders.

==Early life==
Anthony was born in the Red Hook Houses in Brooklyn, New York City. His father, Carmelo Iriarte, was born in Manhattan to Puerto Rican parents. Iriarte was of African, Spanish, and indigenous ancestry; some of his roots also traced to Venezuela. His mother, Mary Anthony, is African-American. Iriarte died of cancer when Anthony was two years old. When Anthony turned eight, his family moved to Baltimore.

Anthony commuted to Towson Catholic High School for his first three years of high school. During the summer of 1999, Anthony grew into the frame of a swingman. He became one of the area&#x27;s top players and made a name for himself in the area, being named &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;″s metro player of the year in 2001, as well as Baltimore Catholic League player of the year. During his sophomore year, he averaged 14 points, five rebounds, four assists and two steals. Towson Catholic surged to a record of 26–3 and finished third in the state tournament. Anthony enjoyed a successful high school basketball career as a junior, almost doubling his numbers in scoring and rebounds, averaging 23 points and 10.3 rebounds. Despite his successful year, Anthony was distracted by all of the attention and was suspended on several occasions for skipping classes. He barely registered a blip on the radars of pro scouts with his skinny frame and lack of strength; many scouts felt that he was not ready for the physical demands of the NBA. In the end, Towson Catholic fell short of the state title, although he was named Baltimore&#x27;s County Player of the Year, All-Metropolitan Player of the Year and Baltimore Catholic League Player of the Year.

After his junior year, Division I coaches were lined up to recruit Anthony to a school on the East Coast, which included North Carolina and Syracuse. In contrast to contemporary prep-to-pro players like Kevin Garnett, Jermaine O&#x27;Neal, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady or Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire, he decided to declare early and announce that he would attend Syracuse University before his senior year. As Anthony&#x27;s grades dropped under a C average and his scores on the ACT were below acceptable standards, he knew that he needed to improve in the classroom to qualify academically for Syracuse. For his senior year, his mother considered transferring him to a different school. Anthony first thought of Virginia&#x27;s Hargrave Military Academy but after talking to Steve Smith, the head coach at basketball powerhouse Oak Hill Academy, he eventually transferred to Oak Hill Academy in Virginia—winner of the &quot;USA Today&quot; 2000–01 high school championship—for his senior campaign. During the summer of 2001, Anthony led an AAU Baltimore Select team to the Final Four of the Adidas Big Time Tournament in Las Vegas, Nevada. Anthony attracted attention from the NBA by averaging 25.2 points a game in the tournament, which was also attended by Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire (who was already being touted as a future lottery pick). Anthony played at the USA Basketball Youth Development Festival where he helped the East Team win the silver medal. He tied LeBron James for the tournament scoring lead at 24 points per game and shot 66 percent from the field. It was there that Anthony and James struck up a friendship.

Oak Hill Academy entered the 2001–02 campaign boasting a 42-game winning streak. The team&#x27;s first tournament win came in The Les Schwab Invitational against Mater Dei High School from Santa Ana, California, with Anthony winning the tournament MVP. Oak Hill won two more big-time tournaments, including the Nike Academy National Invitational where they knocked off then-No. 1 Westchester High School 77–61 in the final, and an anticipated game against St. Vincent – St. Mary High School of Akron, Ohio, where he was matched up with high school phenom LeBron James. James scored 36 points, while Anthony scored 34 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to lead Oak Hill to a 72–66 win. The team ended the season ranked third in the country at 32–1, with their only loss coming in a rematch against Mater Dei, which ended their unbeaten streak at 67. He averaged 21.7 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.0 assists during his senior year at Oak Hill and named a &quot;USA Today&quot; All-USA First Team and a Parade First-Team All-American. He was selected to play in the Jordan Brand Classic, scoring a game-high 27 points, and the 2002 McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game, where he played on the same team with two future New York Knicks teammates, Raymond Felton and Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire. In that game, he scored 19 points and won the &quot;Sprite Slam Jam&quot; dunk contest. His performances at the high school All-Star games, helped lift his reputation with HoopScoop ranking him as the nation&#x27;s No. 1 high school senior in the class of 2002, ranked second by College Basketball News and third by All-Star Sports. Due to his struggles with the ACT, his family and friends wondered whether Anthony would forget about his college plans to attend Syracuse and move on to the NBA. He had yet to produce the minimum score of 18; however, in late April Anthony got a 19 and decided to stick with college and prepared for his freshman year at Syracuse. In April 2009, he was named to the ESPN RISE&#x27;s all-decade team and was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald&#x27;s All-Americans in January 2012.

==College career==

Anthony played one season at Syracuse University, during the 2002–03 season, where he averaged 22.2 points (16th in the NCAA, fourth in the Big East) and 10.0 rebounds (19th in the NCAA, third in the Big East, first among NCAA Division I freshmen). He helped guide the Orangemen to their first ever NCAA tournament title in 2003. He led the team in scoring, rebounding, minutes played (36.4 minutes per game), field goals made and free throws made and attempted. Anthony&#x27;s 33-point outburst against the University of Texas in the Final Four set an NCAA tournament record for most points by a freshman. In the championship game against the University of Kansas, Anthony had 20 points and 10 rebounds. For his efforts during the NCAA tournament, Anthony earned the tournament&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player Award. Afterwards, Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim described Anthony as &quot;[...] by far, the best player in college basketball. It wasn&#x27;t even close. Nobody was even close to him last year in college basketball. That&#x27;s the bottom line&quot;.

Anthony said that he originally planned to stay at Syracuse for two to three seasons, but having already accomplished everything he set out to do, he chose to abandon his collegiate career (with Boeheim&#x27;s blessing) and declared himself eligible for the 2003 NBA draft. Some of Anthony&#x27;s highlights in his time with Syracuse include being named Second-Team All-American by the Associated Press as a freshman, leading his team to a 30–5 record, capturing the school&#x27;s first ever NCAA title and being the consensus pick for NCAA Freshman of the Year. He was also named to the All-Big East First Team and was the consensus selection for the Big East Conference Freshman of the Year as so as unanimous selection for Big East All Rookie Team.

==Professional career==

===Denver Nuggets (2003–2011)===

====Rookie season====
Anthony&#x27;s NBA career began on June 26, 2003, when he was chosen third overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets. He was selected behind LeBron James (first overall, Cleveland Cavaliers) and Darko Miličić (second overall, Detroit Pistons). He made his NBA regular season debut on October 29, 2003, in an 80–72 home win against the San Antonio Spurs. Anthony finished the night with 12 points, seven rebounds, and three assists. In just his sixth career NBA game (November 7 versus the Los Angeles Clippers), Anthony scored 30 points, becoming the second youngest player in NBA history to score 30 points or more in a game (19 years, 151 days; Kobe Bryant was the youngest). It was the fewest games a Nuggets rookie took to score 30 points in a contest since the ABA–NBA merger. On February 9, 2004, against the Memphis Grizzlies, Anthony became the third-youngest player to reach the 1,000-point plateau in NBA history with a 20-point effort in an 86–83 win.

On February 13, 2004, Anthony participated in the Got Milk? Rookie Challenge at All-Star Weekend. On March 30, 2004, he scored 41 points against the Seattle SuperSonics to set a new Denver Nuggets franchise record for most points in a game by a rookie. He also became the second-youngest player (19 years, 305 days) to score at least 40 points in a game in NBA history. After winning the Rookie of the Month award for the Western Conference in the month of April, Anthony became the fourth player in NBA history to capture all six of the Rookie of the Month awards in a season. The others to do so were David Robinson, Tim Duncan and fellow rookie LeBron James. Anthony was also named NBA Player of the Week twice (March 10, 2004 – March 14, 2004, and April 6, 2004 – April 10, 2004) and was a unanimous NBA All-Rookie First Team selection. Anthony averaged 21.0 points per game during the season, which was more than any other rookie. Anthony was second in the NBA Rookie of the Year voting, finishing runner-up to the Cavaliers rookie standout, James.

Anthony played a major part in the turnaround of the Denver Nuggets from league laughingstock to playoff contender. In the season before Anthony was drafted by the team, the Nuggets finished with a 17–65 record, which tied them for worst in the NBA with the Cleveland Cavaliers. They finished the 2003–04 campaign with a 43–39 overall record, qualifying them as the eighth seed for the playoffs. Anthony became the first NBA rookie to lead a playoff team in scoring since David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs during the 1989–90 season. In the 2004 NBA Playoffs, the Nuggets faced the top-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves in the First Round. In Anthony&#x27;s first career playoff game, he had 19 points, six rebounds, and three assists, in a 106–92 loss at Minnesota. The Timberwolves eliminated the Nuggets in five games.

====2004–05 season====
In Anthony&#x27;s second season, he averaged 20.8 points per game, ranking him 19th in the NBA. Anthony placed 16th in the NBA for points per 48 minutes. On December 4, 2004, versus the Miami Heat, Anthony became the third-youngest player in NBA history to reach 2,000 career points. Only James and Bryant were younger when they reached that plateau. Anthony played again in the Got Milk? Rookie Challenge, this time suiting up for the sophomore squad. In front of his home fans of Denver (who were hosting the 2005 All-Star Game), Anthony scored a game-high 31 points to go along with five boards, two assists and two steals, en route to becoming the MVP of the game.

With Anthony&#x27;s help, the Nuggets improved their season record by six games from the previous season, ending with a mark of 49–33. The Nuggets finished seventh place in the Western Conference (one spot higher than they finished the previous season). Denver faced the second-seeded San Antonio Spurs in the First Round, winning the first game in San Antonio, 93–87. However, the eventual NBA champion Spurs won the next four games, eliminating the Nuggets from the playoffs.

====2005–06 season====
Anthony played and started in 80 games during the 2005–06 season. He averaged 26.5 points (eighth, NBA), 2.7 assists, 4.9 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game. His eighth-place finish in NBA scoring was the highest finish by a Denver player since the 1990–91 season, when Nuggets guard Michael Adams finished the season sixth in NBA scoring. On November 23, 2005, with the Nuggets facing the two-time defending Eastern Conference Champion Detroit Pistons, Anthony hauled down his 1,000th career rebound. A month later, Anthony recorded a then career-high 45 points in a losing effort against the Philadelphia 76ers. On March 17, 2006, versus the Memphis Grizzlies, he scored 33 points to push his career point total over the 5,000 mark. Also, in doing so, he became the second youngest player to accomplish that feat (behind LeBron James). As the month of March came to a close, the Nuggets finished 11–5, and Anthony was named as the NBA Player of the Month for March. He also took home Player of the Week honors for March 13, 2006 – March 19, 2006.

During the season, Anthony made five game-winning shots in the last five seconds: at Houston on January 8, 2006; at home versus Phoenix on January 10; at Minnesota on February 24; at Indiana on March 15; at home versus the Los Angeles Lakers on April 6. All five of those game-winners were made on jump shots, while the shot against Minnesota was a three-point field goal. Anthony also made a shot in the final seconds to force overtime vs. the Dallas Mavericks on January 6. He made shots in the final 22 seconds against the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 18, 2006, and the Philadelphia 76ers on March 9, which gave the Nuggets leads they would never lose. Anthony was named to the All-NBA Third Team.

The Nuggets finished the season in third place, winning the Northwest Division for the first time in Anthony&#x27;s career. Denver faced the sixth-seeded Los Angeles Clippers in the First Round of the playoffs. The Clippers held home court advantage in the series, due to ending the regular season with a better record (Denver finished 44–38; Los Angeles finished 47–35). The Clippers won the first two games of the series on their home floor. The Nuggets split their games at home in Denver (winning game three; losing game four). Denver then lost game five at Los Angeles, which eliminated the Nuggets from the playoffs. After the season, Anthony signed a 5-year, $80 million extension with the Nuggets.

====2006–07 season====

Coincidentally, Alex English witnessed Anthony tie his record as English was an Assistant Coach at the time with the Toronto Raptors. After the Chicago victory, Anthony again tied the club record of six-straight 30-point games, failing to break it the second time around, as he scored 24 points in his 16th game (a 98–96 home loss to the Atlanta Hawks) on December 6. During a game at Madison Square Garden on December 16, Anthony was one of many players involved in the infamous Knicks–Nuggets brawl. Footage showed Anthony laying a punch on the face of New York&#x27;s Mardy Collins and subsequently backing away. As a result of his actions, Anthony was suspended for 15 games by NBA commissioner David Stern. Shortly thereafter, the Nuggets traded for Allen Iverson. The duo did not get to play alongside one another until a home game against the Memphis Grizzlies on January 22, which was the day Anthony was allowed to return from his 15-game suspension. Anthony finished the game with 28 points, as he and Iverson combined for 51 points.

On February 2, 2007, Anthony and teammate J. R. Smith were involved in a minor car accident. Neither player was injured in the collision. The only information released by the team was that the car Smith was driving belonged to Anthony. Three days later, Anthony recorded his first career triple-double, with 31 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, in a 113–108 loss to the Phoenix Suns. When the reserves for the Western Conference All-Star team were announced, Anthony was not included on the roster. However, with Yao Ming and Carlos Boozer out with injuries, NBA commissioner David Stern chose Anthony as a replacement (along with Josh Howard). Anthony scored 20 points with nine rebounds in his All-Star debut. Anthony was the first Denver Nugget to be named an All-Star since Antonio McDyess in 2001.

Anthony won Player of the Week honors three times during the season (November 20–26; November 27 – December 3; and February 5–11), and received Player of the Month honors for April. Anthony finished the season as the league&#x27;s second leading scorer behind Bryant, with an average of 28.9 points, while adding 6.0 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.2 steals per game. He was named to All-NBA Third Team for the second straight year.

====2007–08 season====

On January 24, 2008, Anthony was named to his second consecutive NBA All-Star Game—his first as a starter. He finished as the leading vote-getter among Western Conference forwards (1,723,701 votes) and second in overall voting to Kobe Bryant (2,004,940 votes) among all Western Conference players. On February 8, Anthony scored a then career-high 49 points in a 111–100 home win over the Washington Wizards. He had a field goal percentage of .760 on a 19-of-25 shooting effort, and his shooting percentage was the second highest in the last 13 years for a player who took 25 or more shots in a game (Bryant was first with a .769 field goal percentage on a 20-of-26 shooting effort, in a 99–94 road victory over the Houston Rockets on December 21, 2000). On March 27, in a home win over the Dallas Mavericks, Anthony scored his 9,000th career point. He played in 77 games during the regular season, finishing as the NBA&#x27;s fourth-leading scorer with 25.7 points per game, and had career-highs in rebounds per game (7.4) and steals per game (1.3). He tied his career-high in blocks per game (0.5), and ended the season with 3.4 assists per game, which was the second-best mark of his career.

The Nuggets finished the 2007–08 season with exactly 50 wins (50–32 overall record, tied for the third-best all-time Nuggets record since the team officially joined the NBA in 1976), following a 120–111 home victory over the Memphis Grizzlies in the last game of the season. It was the first time since the 1987–88 NBA season that the Nuggets finished with at least 50 wins in a season. Denver ended up as the eighth seed in the Western Conference of the 2008 Playoffs, and their 50 wins marked the highest win total for an eighth seed in NBA history. It also meant that for the first time in NBA history, all eight playoff seeds in a conference had at least 50 wins. The Nuggets faced the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers (57–25 overall record) in the First Round of the Playoffs. The seven games separating the Nuggets overall record and the Lakers overall record is the closest margin between an eighth seed and a top seed since the NBA went to a 16-team playoff format in 1983–84. The Lakers swept the Nuggets in four games, marking the second time in NBA history that a 50-win team was swept in a best-of-seven playoff series in the First Round. For the series, Anthony averaged 22.5 points, 9.5 rebounds (playoff career-high), 2.0 assists and 0.5 steals per game.

====2008–09 season====
The 2008–09 campaign began with Allen Iverson being traded to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for guard Chauncey Billups. On December 10, 2008, in a 116–105 home win over the Timberwolves, Anthony tied George Gervin for the most points scored in one quarter in NBA history by scoring 33 points in the third quarter. Gervin had set the record when he was competing against David Thompson for the scoring title on the last day of the 1977–78 season. Anthony shot 12 of 15 (80%) in the third quarter and finished the game with 45 points, 11 rebounds, three assists, and four steals. The record was broken in January 2015 by Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors. On January 4, 2009, Anthony broke a bone in his hand in a game against the Indiana Pacers. He opted to have the hand splinted rather than have surgery; his recovery time was estimated at three to four weeks. He had already missed three games in late December with a sore elbow. Anthony returned from injury and to the Nuggets starting lineup on January 30, 2009, in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats in which he scored 19 points. Anthony was suspended for one game by the Nuggets for staying on the court and refusing to leave the game after coach George Karl benched him during a game against the Pacers.

The Nuggets won the Northwest Division and placed second in the Western Conference, finishing the season with a franchise record-tying 54 wins (54–28 overall). Anthony averaged 22.8 points per game and made a career-high 37.1% of his shots from three-point range. After losing in five straight playoff appearances (2004–2008), on April 29, 2009, Anthony won his first playoff series when the Nuggets beat the New Orleans Hornets at home 107–86 where Anthony finished with a playoff career-high 34 points and four steals. In a post-game conference, Anthony said &quot;Yeah, finally... Took me 5 years to get that gorilla off my back, it&#x27;s a great feeling.&quot; The Nuggets beat the Hornets in five games in the First Round of the playoffs and proceeded to beat the Dallas Mavericks 4–1 in the conference semifinals with Anthony scoring 30 points in a solid game five performance. In the third game of the semifinals, Anthony made a last second three-point shot to give the Nuggets the win after being down by two points (103–105). Denver advanced to the Conference finals for the first time since 1985 but was eliminated, 4–2, by the eventual NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers on his birthday.

Anthony was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the third time in his career.

====2009–10 season====

In the opening two games of the 2009–10 season, Anthony totaled 71 points, scoring 30 points in the home opener and 41 the next night, in wins against division rivals Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers respectively. Anthony became one of three players in the Nuggets&#x27; history to open with 70 or more points through two games—tied with Nick Van Exel with 71 points—surpassed only by Alex English who did it twice, in 1985 (79) and 1988 (74). It was also only the second time since 1987 that the Nuggets started the season 2–0. In their third game, Anthony scored 42 points. It was the first time they went 3–0 since 1985. In the month of November, Anthony was named the NBA player of the week and Western Conference Player of the Month, leading the Nuggets to a 12–5 start.

In the fifteenth regular season game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Anthony entered the game leading the league in points per game (30.2) and was the only player in the league to score at least 20 points in every game. He finished the game with 22 points which was his fifteenth consecutive game with at least 20 points breaking the previous franchise record of 14 straight set by English. The following game, Anthony scored a career-high 50 points in a home game against the New York Knicks while teammate Chauncey Billups added 32 points in the game, making them only the third duo in NBA history to score at least 50 and 30 points respectively. Two days later, Anthony scored a total of 32 points. On January 21, 2010, Anthony was named as a starter for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game leading the Western Conference ballots in votes for forwards. This was Anthony&#x27;s third All-Star appearance and second as a starter. He finished the game with a team-high 27 points and 10 rebounds.

In the team&#x27;s first game after the All-Star Game, the Nuggets visited the Cleveland Cavaliers in a highly anticipated game with the Cavaliers having a 13-game winning streak. While LeBron James posted a triple-double of 43 points, 13 rebounds and 15 assists, Anthony compiled 40 points, six rebounds and seven assists in an overtime win as Anthony nailed a jumper over the outstretched arms of James with just 1.9 seconds left in the game, ending the Cavaliers&#x27; win streak. On March 26, 2010, Anthony made a game-winning shot at the buzzer, after missing his first attempt, against the Toronto Raptors. The Nuggets concluded the 2009–10 regular season with a 53–29 record and the Northwest Division title for the second straight season facing the Utah Jazz in the First Round. In Game 1, Anthony scored a playoff-career-high 42 points. This also matched a franchise-playoff high for scoring in a single playoff game, tied with Alex English.

Anthony was named to the All-NBA Second Team for the first time in his career.

====2010–11 season====
The 2010–11 season began with speculation that Anthony had requested a trade. Anthony refused to sign a proposed contract extension. Sources reported that Anthony&#x27;s preferred destination was the New York Knicks, with other teams such as the New Jersey Nets, Houston Rockets and Atlanta Hawks said to be interested. Anthony&#x27;s trade request was not initially fulfilled, and he began the season on the Nuggets&#x27; roster. On November 15, 2010, Anthony had 20 points and a career-high 22 rebounds for the first 20–20 game of his career against the Phoenix Suns. He also a hit game-winning jumper at the buzzer against the Bulls on November 26, 2010.

===New York Knicks (2011–2017)===

====2010–11 season====
On February 22, 2011, Anthony, along with point guard Chauncey Billups, was traded to the New York Knicks in a multi-player deal also involving the Minnesota Timberwolves. Anthony chose to wear number 7 with the Knicks, as his former number 15 was retired by the Knicks in honor of Earl Monroe and Dick McGuire. Anthony&#x27;s first game with the Knicks was a 114–108 win against the Milwaukee Bucks in which he scored 27 points and had 10 rebounds and an assist. After Anthony&#x27;s acquisition, the Knicks qualified for the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference and were matched up against the Boston Celtics. During the series, the Knicks struggled with injuries as Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire and Billups went down. In game two of the NBA playoffs in Boston, Anthony tied a playoff career high with 42 points and also had 17 rebounds and six assists in a Knicks loss. The Knicks fell to the Boston Celtics in four games in the First Round of the playoffs.

====2011–12 season====

The 2011–12 season brought new expectations, as the season would be Anthony&#x27;s first full season as a Knick. The Knicks struggled throughout the season, as injuries derailed the team. Anthony himself missed 11 games; during this stretch, the Knicks inserted Jeremy Lin as the team&#x27;s starting point guard. This led to a historic stretch of games by Lin, and a period of basketball hysteria known as Linsanity. However, the team found themselves with an 18–24 record, leading to the resignation of coach Mike D&#x27;Antoni. Anthony was assumed to have a role in the coach&#x27;s departure, as he was not a good fit in D&#x27;Antoni&#x27;s high paced offense. Mike Woodson took over for D&#x27;Antoni; this led to an improvement in Anthony&#x27;s play, as he was more suited for Woodson&#x27;s halfcourt offense. On Easter Sunday, Anthony had arguably his best game in a Knicks uniform as he scored 43 points and hit two clutch three-pointers in a victory over Chicago. Under Woodson, the Knicks finished the season at 18–6, a vast improvement from the 18–24 record they had under D&#x27;Antoni.

The Knicks qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference, and faced off against the eventual champions, the Miami Heat. During the series, the Knicks were hampered by injuries as they were a season before. Tyson Chandler was diagnosed with the flu for game 1, Iman Shumpert tore his ACL, Baron Davis tore his patella tendon, and All-Star Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire sustained a laceration on his hand after punching a fire extinguisher out of anger after a loss. In addition, Jeremy Lin had torn his left meniscus before the playoffs started. Despite the injuries, Anthony was able to lead the Knicks to their first playoff win since 2001. In the game, Anthony scored 41 points. The Knicks were eventually eliminated in five games, 4–1. Anthony was voted to the All-NBA Third Team for the fourth time in his career alongside teammate Tyson Chandler.

====2012–13 season====
On December 3, 2012, Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the period November 26 to December 2, 2012. On January 7, 2013, Anthony received his second Player of the Week for games played from December 31, 2012, to January 6, 2013. During that time, he led the team to a 2–1 record, tallying a league-best 36.0 points per game. The week was highlighted by a pair of 40-point games, first in a loss to Portland (45 points, seven rebounds, four assists) on January 1, and then in a victory over Orlando (40 points, six rebounds and six assists) on January 5. On January 9, 2013, Anthony was suspended for one game without pay for confronting Kevin Garnett after a game on January 7. On January 30, 2013, in a game against the Orlando Magic, Anthony set the Knicks&#x27; team-record with 30 straight 20-point games, breaking the old record set by Richie Guerin (29 games). Anthony later extended the record to 31 games after he scored 25 points in a 96–86 victory against the Milwaukee Bucks.
On March 29, 2013, Anthony recorded 32 points and 11 rebounds in a 111–102 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats. His teammate J. R. Smith scored 37 points in the game. On March 31, 2013, Anthony scored 24 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in a win against the Boston Celtics as he recorded a double-double in consecutive games. With the victory, the Knicks won the season series against the Celtics (3–1) for the first time since the 2003–04 season. On April 2, 2013, Anthony tied his career high by scoring 50 points in a 102–90 win over the Miami Heat and became the first player in NBA history to record 50+ points with no baskets in the paint. He followed the next night with 40 points in a 95–82 victory over the Atlanta Hawks, and then 41 points against the Milwaukee Bucks two days later, becoming the first Knicks player since Bernard King to score 40+ points in three consecutive games. He also became only the third NBA player to score at least 40 points on at least 60% field-goal shooting in three consecutive games, joining King and Michael Jordan. On April 7, 2013, Anthony scored 36 points and 12 rebounds, nine offensive, as the Knicks tallied their 12th straight win in a 125–120 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder. By scoring 36 points to Kevin Durant&#x27;s 27 points, he overtook the latter in the scoring race, upping his season average to 28.44 to Durant&#x27;s 28.35 points per game.

On April 8, 2013, Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the period April 1–7, 2013. He led the Knicks to a 4–0 record as part of their 12-game winning streak, during which he averaged 41.8 points per game. No NBA player had scored at least 35 points in five straight games since Kobe Bryant in the 2006–07 season. In 2013, Anthony became the first Knicks player with the highest-selling jersey in the NBA, based on sales at the NBA Store and NBAstore.com, since the league started tracking jersey sales in 2001.

On April 11, 2013, the Knicks&#x27; 13-game winning streak ended with a loss to the Bulls, 118–111. Despite the loss, Anthony scored 36 points on top of a season-high 19 rebounds, and he set a franchise record with six straight games with at least 35 points. On April 15, 2013, Anthony won his second straight Eastern Conference Player of the Week award for games played from April 8 to 15, 2013, when he led the team to a 3–1 record. For the week, he averaged a conference-best 32.0 points and a seventh-best 11.5 rebounds per game. He became the 2013 NBA scoring champion with 28.7 points per game after second place scorer and three-time reigning scoring champion Kevin Durant decided to sit out his last regular season game against the Milwaukee Bucks, ending his season with an average of 28.1 points per game. At the close of the regular season, Anthony was named as the Eastern Conference Player of the Month for April. Anthony broke LeBron James&#x27; stranglehold on the monthly award after James had received such honors five times that season.

In the 2013 NBA Playoffs, Anthony scored 21 points to go with seven rebounds, five assists, two steals and one block against the Boston Celtics, in their First Round playoff series. It was the Knicks&#x27; first playoff series win since 2000. Anthony averaged a team-high 29.2 points per game in the series. This was the second highest playoff series average of a Knick player against the Celtics, behind Ewing&#x27;s 31.6 during their 1989–90 First Round series. In the next round, the Knicks were defeated by the Indiana Pacers in six games. On May 23, 2013, Anthony was named to the All-NBA Second Team. It was the second time in Anthony&#x27;s career that he made the Second Team.

====2013–14 season====
Early in the 2013–14 NBA season, the Knicks suffered a nine-game losing streak, as the team opened with a 3–13 record. Despite the losing record, Anthony continued to play well under the circumstances, averaging 26.3 points, 9.9 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game, nine double-doubles including four straight: against Indiana (30 points and 18 rebounds), Washington (23 and 12), Portland (34 and 15) and Los Angeles Clippers (27 and 10).

However, at the start of 2014, the Knicks went 4–1, including big wins against previous season finalists Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs. In the victory against the Heat, Anthony and James ended up in a virtual deadlock as the former registered 29 points (shooting 12-of-24), eight rebounds, five assists and two steals as against the latter&#x27;s 32 points (shooting 12-of-17), five rebounds, six assists, one steal and one block.

On January 24, he established his career high, the Knicks&#x27; franchise record, and the Madison Square Garden record for single-game scoring with a 62-point, 13-rebound, 0 turnover effort against the Charlotte Bobcats. On January 30, in a 117–86 victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Anthony became the 50th NBA player to score 19,000 career points. Anthony became the fifth-youngest NBA player to achieve the feat. Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for January after leading the conference in scoring with 28.7 points per game while also averaging nine rebounds per contest.

On February 16, 2014, Anthony played in his seventh All-Star Game as a starter for the East All-Stars.

On March 10, 2014, Anthony won his second Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played March 3–9, after he averaged 29.0 points per game, while the Knicks went 3–1.

For the 2013–14 season, Anthony averaged 27.4 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.1 assists in a league-leading 38.7 minutes per game, but would miss the NBA playoffs for the first time in his career.

On June 23, 2014, Anthony informed the Knicks that he would opt out of his contract and become a free agent. On July 13, 2014, Anthony re-signed with the Knicks to a five-year, $124 million contract.

====2014–15 season====

In just the team&#x27;s third game in the season, Anthony became the 40th member of the 20,000 points club, when he hit a three-pointer early in the first quarter of a 96–93 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. He eventually finished with 28 points, hiking his total to 20,025 career points. In the process, he became the 10th active player to achieve the milestone and the sixth youngest in NBA history to reach the milestone just behind LeBron James (28 years, 17 days), Kobe Bryant (29 years, 122 days), Wilt Chamberlain (29 years, 134 days), Michael Jordan (29 years, 326 days) and Oscar Robertson (30 years, 97 days).

On January 22, 2015, Anthony was named as a starter in the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, his seventh consecutive start and eight overall alongside LeBron James, Pau Gasol, Kyle Lowry and John Wall. After competing in the All-Star game and scoring 10 points, Anthony was ruled out for the rest of the season on February 18, after undergoing left knee surgery. Anthony only played 40 games for the season ending with season averages of 24.2 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 3.1 apg and 1.0 spg.

====2015–16 season====
On January 20, 2016, in the Knicks&#x27; 118–111 overtime win against the Jazz, Anthony recorded 30 points, seven rebounds and nine assists, while passing Larry Bird for 31st place in career points scored.

In the team&#x27;s 128–97 victory against the Phoenix Suns on March 9, 2016, Anthony scored 23 points with 7 rebounds as he passed another NBA legend, Clyde Drexler, in the career scoring list moving up to No. 29.

While Anthony ended the season with an average of 21.8 ppg (1,573 points in 72 games), below his 25.2 ppg average entering the season, he set a career-high 4.2 apg average (299 assists in 72 games), the first and only time that he averaged over 4.0 apg in his career.

====2016–17 season====
On December 9, 2016, in a game against the Sacramento Kings, Anthony became the fifth active player to eclipse the 23,000 point mark. He also became the 29th player in NBA history to hit the scoring milestone. On December 25, 2016, in a Christmas Day game against the Boston Celtics, Anthony moved past Elgin Baylor into 28th place on the NBA career scoring list when he scored 29 points upping his total to 23,156 compared to Baylor&#x27;s 23,149.

On January 29, 2017, Anthony scored a season-high 45 points, his first 40-point game of the season, in a quadruple-overtime 142–139 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. He added six rebounds, four assists and a block.

In the February 12, 2017, game against the San Antonio Spurs, where the team eked out a 94–90 victory that salvaged the finale of their five-game homestand, Anthony scored a game-high 25 points to move past Charles Barkley into 25th position in the NBA career scoring list. He also had the fifth-most points among active players after Nowitzki, James, Pierce, and Carter, who was No. 24 in the scoring list. It was the 12th time Anthony has scored at least 17 points in his last 13 games that included his season-high of 45 points in a quadruple-OT loss to the Atlanta Hawks. On February 15, 2017, he was announced as the replacement for Kevin Love on the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, thus gaining his tenth All-Star appearance. Anthony played 19 minutes, scored 10 points on a 4-of-8 shooting including 2–6 on three-pointers and grabbed three rebounds in the All-Star Game.

On March 12, 2017, in a 120–112 loss to Knicks cross-town rivals Brooklyn Nets, Anthony became only the third player to score 10,000 points for two franchises, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Milwaukee Bucks and L.A. Lakers) and Elvin Hayes (San Diego/Houston Rockets and Baltimore/Capital/Washington Bullets). He began his career with the Denver Nuggets, where he scored a total of 13,970 points in 564 games. Two days later, on March 14, in an 87–81 victory over the Indiana Pacers, ending a three-game losing streak, Anthony surpassed the 24,000 career point mark by scoring 22 points with 13 rebounds.

====2017 off-season====
During the 2017 off-season, after multiple conflicts with the then-team president Phil Jackson, Anthony demanded a trade. Originally, the only team for which Anthony was willing to waive his no-trade clause was the Houston Rockets. However, Anthony expanded his list of teams to include the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Oklahoma City Thunder.

On September 25, 2017, Anthony was traded to the Thunder in exchange for future teammate Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and a 2018 second-round pick. During Anthony&#x27;s seven seasons with the Knicks, the team won one playoff series.

===Oklahoma City Thunder (2017–2018)===
On November 9, 2017, with only 12 points needed to move up in the rankings, Anthony passed Allen Iverson on the NBA all-time scoring list and moved to the 24th spot. He finished the game with 28 points. On November 26, 2017, Anthony passed Ray Allen on the NBA all-time scoring list and moved to 23rd place. On December 11, 2017, Anthony passed Vince Carter for 22nd on the NBA all-time scoring list.

On January 27, 2018, Anthony became the 21st NBA player to score 25,000 career points. In addition, he has 1,693 playoff points.
On March 19, 2018, in a 132–125 victory over the Toronto Raptors, Anthony scored 15 points to up his career total to 25,289, thereby moving past Reggie Miller into 19th place in the NBA career scoring ladder.

On July 25, 2018, the Thunder traded Anthony to the Atlanta Hawks in a three-team trade in which they acquired Dennis Schröder from the Hawks and Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot from the Philadelphia 76ers. The trade was widely seen as a cost-cutting move, as it saved the Thunder tens of millions of dollars in luxury tax payments. On July 30, Anthony accepted a contract buyout from the Hawks, and was subsequently placed on waivers.

===Houston Rockets (2018–2019)===
On August 13, 2018, Anthony signed a one-year, $2.4 million veterans minimum contract with the Houston Rockets coached by his former Knicks coach, Mike D&#x27;Antoni. On November 15, Rockets general manager Daryl Morey announced that the team was &quot;parting ways&quot; with Anthony, but had not released him. He played ten games for Houston, starting twice, but he was held out of the last three for what the club called an unspecified &quot;illness.&quot; During that absence, much of his playing time went to rookie Gary Clark. Houston had started the season losing seven of their first 11 games. Morey said that Anthony &quot;accepted every role&quot; asked by D&#x27;Antoni, but that the &quot;fit we envisioned when Carmelo chose to sign with the Rockets has not materialized; therefore we thought it was best to move on as any other outcome would have been unfair to him.&quot; D&#x27;Antoni stated that he &quot;didn&#x27;t ever want to disrespect [Anthony] and his career. He&#x27;s going in the Hall of Fame.&quot;

On January 22, 2019, the Rockets traded Anthony, the draft rights to Jon Diebler, and undisclosed cash considerations to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for the draft rights to Tadija Dragićević. This trade allowed the Rockets to alleviate luxury-tax penalties up to $2.6 million. On February 1, he was waived by the Bulls.

===Portland Trail Blazers (2019–2021)===

====2019–20 season====
On November 19, 2019, Anthony was signed by the Portland Trail Blazers to a one-year, non-guaranteed deal. With his last NBA game having been on November 8, 2018, Anthony made his debut as a Blazer in a 115–104 road loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on November 19; he started and had 10 points to go along with 4 rebounds and 1 block in 24 minutes of play. On November 25, Anthony scored a season-high 25 points along with 8 rebounds in a 117–94 road victory over the Chicago Bulls. In the same game, Anthony moved past Alex English into 18th spot on the NBA&#x27;s all-time scoring list. A couple of days later Anthony was named Western Conference Player of the Week, in the process becoming the oldest player at 35 years old to win the weekly award since Tim Duncan at 38 won it in 2014–15. On December 6, Anthony&#x27;s contract became fully guaranteed.

On January 1, 2020, Anthony bested his season-high by scoring 26 points in a 117–93 loss to the New York Knicks. On January 7, Anthony recorded a new season-high 28 points and seven rebounds, and hit the game-winning shot in a 101–99 win over the Toronto Raptors. It was Anthony&#x27;s 26th game winner in the last 30 seconds of a game, better than Kobe Bryant with 22, LeBron James with 20, Dirk Nowitzki with 18 and Dwyane Wade with 16. It was also the 17th time that Anthony has hit a game winner in the last 5 seconds of a game.

On January 15, Anthony recorded his third double-double of the season with 18 points and a season-high 12 rebounds in Portland&#x27;s 117–107 victory over the Rockets. On January 17, Anthony scored 22 points in a 120–112 loss to the Dallas Mavericks, while becoming the 18th player in NBA history to reach the 26,000 points mark. Anthony scored six points in the Trail Blazers&#x27; 125–112 win against the Rockets on January 29, and passed Kevin Garnett for 17th place in the NBA&#x27;s all-time scoring list with a total of 26,073 points. On February 23, Anthony scored a season-high 32 points in a 107–104 victory against the Detroit Pistons. This was the first time that Anthony scored over 30 points since February 25, 2017, when he was playing for the New York Knicks.

On August 1, 2020, in the team&#x27;s 1st game in the NBA restart against the Memphis Grizzlies, Anthony scored 21 points. Anthony ultimately tied Chamberlain for No. 8 all-time with 771 career 20-point games when he scored 21, 20, and 26 points against the Los Angeles Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers and Dallas Mavericks in their 5th, 6th and 7th games in the NBA restart.

In the team&#x27;s sixth game in the NBA restart against the Philadelphia 76ers on August 10, 2020, Anthony scored 20 points with 7 rebounds, 2 steals and a block as he passed Boston Celtics legends John Havlicek for 16th place and ultimately Paul Pierce for 15th in the NBA career scoring ladder with a then-total of 26,411 points. On August 13, 2020, just before the team&#x27;s last game in the NBA restart against the Brooklyn Nets, Anthony was named the recipient of the 2019–20 Maurice Lucas Award. Anthony finished the first round playoff series with averages of 15.2 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.0 steals and 0.4 blocks in five games.

====2020–21 season====
In November 2020, Anthony re-signed with the Trail Blazers on a one-year contract. On January 1, 2021, in the first game of Portland&#x27;s back-to-back game with the Golden State Warriors, Anthony scored a then season-high 18 points to move past Tim Duncan into 14th place on the NBA career scoring list. On February 2, Anthony scored 21 points in a game against the Washington Wizards and moved past Dominique Wilkins into 13th place on the NBA all-time scoring list. On February 9, Anthony scored 23 points against the Orlando Magic and moved past Oscar Robertson into 12th place on the NBA all-time career scoring list. On February 11, Anthony scored a then season-high 24 points in the 118–114 win against the Philadelphia 76ers. On March 1, Anthony scored a season-high 29 points in a win against the Charlotte Hornets. On March 13, Anthony scored 26 points to move past Hakeem Olajuwon into 11th place on the NBA career scoring list in a win against the Minnesota Timberwolves. On March 19, Anthony scored 18 points off the bench in a victory over Dallas Mavericks and became 11th NBA player to score over 27,000 points. On May 3, Anthony scored 14 points in the 123–114 loss to the Atlanta Hawks and moved past Elvin Hayes into the 10th place on the NBA all-time career scoring list. After the 2020–21 season, Anthony received the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Social Justice Champion Award.

===Los Angeles Lakers (2021–2022)===

On August 6, 2021, Anthony signed with the Los Angeles Lakers. On October 19, he made his Lakers debut, putting up nine points, four rebounds, and two assists in a 121–114 loss to the Golden State Warriors. On October 24, Anthony put up 28 points in a 121–118 win over the Memphis Grizzlies and moved past Moses Malone into the 9th place on the NBA all-time career scoring list. On January 28, 2022, he scored 19 points in a 117–114 loss to the Charlotte Hornets to become the 9th player in NBA history to reach 28,000 points. Anthony played his final game on April 5, 2022, where he added ten points and six rebounds in a 121–114 loss to the Phoenix Suns. In a disappointing season due to injuries and inconsistency, the Lakers finished with a 33–49 record (11th), and Anthony averaged 13.3 points per game with 37.5 percent three-point shooting in 69 appearances.

===Retirement===
On May 22, 2023, Anthony announced his retirement from the NBA. On the same day of his retirement announcement, the team that drafted him, the Denver Nuggets, advanced to their first NBA Finals in franchise history after sweeping the Los Angeles Lakers, the same team Anthony would fall short to in the lone Conference finals appearance of his career. Anthony will be eligible for the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2026.

==National team career==

After his rookie season, Anthony, along with fellow 2003 draftees LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, were chosen as members of the 2004 USA Olympic basketball team alongside veterans Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury and Tim Duncan that won the bronze medal. He averaged 2.4 points, 1.6 rebounds and 6.8 minutes of playing time while playing in seven of the team&#x27;s eight games.

In 2006, Anthony was named co-captain (along with James and Wade) of Team USA at the 2006 FIBA World Championship. The team won the bronze medal. On August 23, 2006, Anthony set the U.S. scoring record in a game with 35 points against Italy in the said FIBA tournament. The record was previously held by Kenny Anderson with 34 points in 1990. Anthony was named to the FIBA World Championship All-Tournament Team, posting averages of 19.9 points (led team), 3.7 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game. On January 16, 2006, Anthony was chosen as the USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year after his performance at the FIBA World Championship.

Anthony was also a member of Team USA during the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship. The team went undefeated, going 10–0. He equaled the previous record of 28 points set by Allen Iverson in a qualifying tournament, which was later broken by James, who scored 31 points in the title-clinching win against Argentina.

Anthony was also named to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, again alongside James and Wade, with Kobe Bryant and Jason Kidd among others. The team won its games by an average winning margin of 32.2 points, eliminating Australia in the quarterfinals by 31 and beating Argentina by 20 points. Anthony scored 21 points against Argentina, making 3-of-14 field goals and 13-of-13 in free throws, setting USA Olympic game records for made free throws and free throw percentage. In the gold medal game, the United States defeated 2006 World Champion Spain, with Anthony scoring 13 points. Anthony posted averages of 11.5 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.0 steals per game in eight contests.

Anthony also played in the 2016 Olympic Games, his fourth straight stint in the Olympics, which was a record for a US male basketball player, breaking the old record of having played in three Olympiads he shared with James and Robinson. Team USA won the gold medal when they beat Serbia, 96–66, in the championship game with Anthony becoming the first player in US men&#x27;s basketball history to win three gold medals. In the gold medal game against Serbia, Anthony collared seven rebounds to finish with 125 total rebounds in US Olympic history, passing Robinson as Team USA&#x27;s all-time leader in most rebounds. In summary, Anthony caps his Olympic career as the first man to win three gold medals, career leader in scoring, rebounding and games played, with 31, thereby becoming USA basketball&#x27;s most decorated Olympian. In recognition of his performances and accomplishments in the tournament, Anthony was named co-USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year (along with Kevin Durant) for the third time in his career.

==Player profile==
Anthony played the small forward position, but he was also capable of playing power forward. His scoring prowess is considered to have been his best asset with his ability to take over any game on the offensive end; he shares the NBA record for second most points scored in one quarter with 33, and holds the New York Knicks single-game franchise scoring record with 62. On offense, Anthony is recognized for having been a prolific scorer with a variety of crafty offensive moves. Listed at and , he had strength and quickness to be an immediate and consistent scoring threat in the post. He also liked creating space from his defenders which allowed him to step into his jump shot or put the ball on the floor and drive to the basket and get to the free throw line. Anthony is often known for having been one of the premier clutch performers in the NBA; during the 2005–06 season, Anthony made five game-winning shots in the last five seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime. Dave McMenamin, a staff writer for ESPN, wrote, &quot;If you were going to choose one player to challenge Bryant for his title of Mr. Clutch, it would have to be Anthony.&quot; Despite having been a prolific scorer, he was criticized for his defense and was never named to the NBA All-Defensive Team.

Anthony was one of many NBA players who used Idan Ravin as a personal coach and trainer. His relationship with Ravin started when he was 18 years old and preparing for the NBA draft after spending his one year at Syracuse University.

==Personal life==

Anthony has two brothers, Robert and Wilford, and a half-sister, Daphne. He had another sister, Michelle, who died in 2010. His mother, Mary, is African American and his father, Carmelo Iriarte, was Puerto Rican.

Anthony, along with LeBron James, Chris Paul, and Dwyane Wade, are a quartet referred to as the &quot;banana boat crew&quot;. The four have been friends since they were teenagers, and have consistently gone on vacation together. During an excursion to the Bahamas, Anthony was rescued by James from the water when Anthony was carried away from the boat by the current. During an Instagram Live session, Anthony later recounted, &quot;He saved my life&quot;, when asked about the danger he was in prior to the rescue.

In 2004, Anthony became engaged to Alani &quot;La La&quot; Vazquez. Their son, Kiyan Carmelo Anthony, was born on March 7, 2007. Michael Eric Dyson married Anthony and La La on July 10, 2010, at Cipriani&#x27;s in New York City before 320 guests. VH1 filmed the ceremony for use in a reality series on the couple, titled &quot;La La&#x27;s Full Court Wedding&quot;. Anthony resides in Portland, Oregon. He sold his New York property in 2020.

Shortly after the end of the 2016–17 regular season, TMZ reported that La La had moved out of the couple&#x27;s apartment and the two were living separately. The two reconciled in December 2018. In June 2021, La La filed for divorce.

==Controversies==
In 2004, Anthony was cited for marijuana possession, after inspectors at Denver International Airport found marijuana in his backpack. Charges were later dropped after Anthony&#x27;s friend, James Cunningham, of St. Louis, signed an affidavit taking responsibility for the marijuana. That same year, Anthony appeared in a video entitled &quot;Stop Snitchin&#x27;&quot;, which warned that residents of Baltimore who collaborated with the police would face violence. Anthony later distanced himself from this video. In 2006, Anthony&#x27;s friend, Tyler Brandon Smith, was pulled over in Anthony&#x27;s vehicle and cited for marijuana possession and three traffic violations. Later that year on December 16, he was involved in the infamous Knicks–Nuggets brawl during a game at Madison Square Garden. He was suspended for 15 games as a result.

On April 14, 2008, Anthony was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, after being pulled over on Interstate 25 in Denver for weaving through lanes and not dimming his lights. Police spokesperson Detective Sharon Hahn said Anthony, who was alone in the car, failed a series of sobriety tests. He was ticketed and then released at police headquarters to a &quot;sober, responsible party.&quot; A court date was set for May 14. The Nuggets suspended Anthony for two games due to the arrest. On June 24, 2008, Anthony pleaded guilty to a charge of driving while ability-impaired. The original charge of driving while under the influence was dropped. He was sentenced to one year of probation, 24 hours of community service and US$1,000 in court costs and fines.

He has been criticized by South Bronx community activists for aligning himself with Mott Haven developer Keith Rubenstein&#x27;s efforts to build luxury apartment buildings in the neighborhood, which could lead to gentrification.

<doc id="878648" wikidata="Q1391936" url="?curid=878648" title="De Havilland Australia">
<text>de Havilland Aircraft Pty Ltd (DHA) was an Australian subsidiary of the British aircraft manufacturer de Havilland, founded in 1927. It acquired the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in 1985 and was purchased by Boeing in 2000 and merged with the Boeing owned AeroSpace Technologies of Australia (formerly Government Aircraft Factories) to become Hawker de Havilland Aerospace Pty Ltd. In 2009, the name was changed to Boeing Aerostructures Australia (BAA) and is a subsidiary of Boeing Australia Ltd.

==Early years and WWII==
In March 1927 the de Havilland Aircraft Company established DHA in Melbourne, its first overseas subsidiary. Its founder was Hereward de Havilland. DHA was set up to sell de Havilland products in Australia, to assemble aircraft that had been sold, and to provide repair and spare parts services. In 1930 DHA relocated to Mascot aerodrome in Sydney.

Prior to World War II DHA did not undertake any production of aircraft (although de Havilland designs were licence-built by other Australian organisations, most notably Qantas, the Larkin Aircraft Supply Company and the Cockatoo Island Naval Dockyard under Lawrence Wackett). In the late 1930s DHA began production of propellers both for the local market and for delivery to the parent company. In 1939 DHA delivered 20 DH.82 Tiger Moths assembled from imported fuselages and locally-built wings to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Another order for 50 DH.94 Moth Minors was also received - in October that year - from the Australian Department of Supply and Development, at least four of these having been built at Mascot using locally manufactured components. After the outbreak of war, the RAAF selected the Tiger Moth as its primary trainer and in 1940 DHA commenced licensed manufacture at a new facility at Bankstown; when production ended in February 1945 over one thousand had been built. DHA also licence-built 87 DH.84 Dragons from 1942 and 212 DH.98 Mosquitos from 1943 for the RAAF.

In 1942 DHA produced its first indigenous design. In March that year the RAAF issued a specification for a small transport glider. DHA responded with the DHA-G1 a high-wing design incorporating the nose section of the Dragon then being built. The first of two DHA-G1s was flown in June 1942. The RAAF ordered the improved seven-seat DHA-G2 in 1943: these differed from the DHA-G1 in having a larger fuselage and wing. By this time the threat of invasion of Australia by Japan and the rationale for the type had passed and only six were produced.

==Consolidation==
Mosquito production continued until 1948, by which time work had begun on DHA&#x27;s third indigenous design, the DHA-3 Drover. On 29 June 1949, following selection of the type by the RAAF in 1946, the first of 190 licence-built DH.100 and DH.115 Vampires had its first flight with DHA&#x27;s chief test pilot Brian &quot;Black Jack&quot; Walker at the controls. Production of the Vampire continued until 1960, the same year the parent company was purchased by Hawker Siddeley. At this time the company also entered the general aviation market when it became the Australian distributor for Beechcraft in 1959. Following the absorption of de Havilland by Hawker Siddeley, DHA was renamed Hawker de Havilland (HdH) in 1965. In 1959 the de havilland marine division was formed.

The end of the Vampire programme marked the beginning of an extended period when no complete aircraft were produced, although there was work for the company in various modification (see DHA-3 Drover) and repair and overhaul programmes, including repairing RAAF DHC-4 Caribous damaged on active service during the Vietnam War and major servicing of the RAAF Caribou fleet. The wings for the CAC CA-25 were built at Bankstown between 1956 and 1959. One design project pursued during this time was for a military jet trainer for the RAAF. HdH offered its P17 indigenous design derived from the Vampire and was also involved in the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) F2 project, which would have seen HdH undertaking production work on this aircraft with GAF and the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC). The CAC-built version of the Aermacchi MB-326 was selected for production in 1965 and neither project proceeded. However all was not lost as CAC subcontracted to HdH the manufacture of the wings and wingtip fuel tanks, tailplanes, ailerons, flaps, hydraulic system components and landing gear for the Macchi, as well as parts of the Macchi&#x27;s Viper engines built by CAC.

In 1970 HdH entered a new phase when it began to pursue subcontract work for civil airliner manufacturers. This work is now the main focus of the company and HdH has manufactured components for many of the major airliners of the later part of the 20th century and the 21st century, including work for Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas. In 1976 HdH undertook the refurbishment of 16 ex-US Navy Grumman S-2G Trackers for the Royal Australian Navy. In 1980 the thriving general aviation division was separated as Hawker Pacific but both companies remained part of Hawker Siddeley. In 1981 HdH formed the Australian Aircraft Consortium with CAC and GAF to design and manufacture the A10/A20 Wamira. The project suffered numerous delays and cost increases (due in part to the changing requirements of the RAAF and in part to the inexperience of the consortium members in designing to military requirements) and shortly after the prototype was completed at HdH&#x27;s Bankstown factory the programme was cancelled at the end of 1985.

Earlier in 1985 HdH purchased CAC, which was initially kept as a separate company but was then renamed Hawker de Havilland Victoria (HdHV) the following year. At the time of the purchase both companies were in the initial stages of producing components for the GAF-built version of the F/A-18 Hornet. HdH at Bankstown was responsible for the landing gear and major hydraulic system components including aileron, rudder and flap actuators and hydraulic fluid reservoirs; while CAC/HdHV was responsible for the wing pylons, engine access panels, aft nozzle fairings, aircraft-mounted accessory drive gearboxes and engines.

==Building aircraft again==
Following the cancellation of the Wamira, HdH resumed production of complete aircraft in 1987 after it was selected to build a version of the Pilatus PC-9 under licence for the RAAF. HdH was responsible for final assembly of 65 aircraft (known as the &#x27;PC-9/A&#x27;), initially from kits supplied by Pilatus (17 aircraft), but with the components for the final 48 examples produced by HdHV and GAF (which by this time had been privatised and renamed Aerospace Technologies of Australia) (ASTA). Two Swiss-built PC-9s were already delivered in 1987. The last Australian-made PC-9/A was delivered in May 1992.

In May 1988 HdH delivered the first Bankstown-assembled Sikorsky Black Hawk to the RAAF. After eight had been built the RAAF&#x27;s helicopters were transferred to the Australian Army; HdH deliveries continued to the Army until the last of 38 locally assembled aircraft was delivered in January 1991. In March the following year the last PC-9/A was delivered. Also in 1992 HdH was de-listed from the Australian Stock Exchange when it was sold to BTR Nylex.

The PC-9/A was the last complete aircraft type to be built by HdH, although RAAF Caribous could still be seen at Bankstown until 1994. During the same time period HdH was involved in the McDonnell Douglas Helicopters MDX project, HdH being responsible the design and development of the fuselage in Sydney with manufacture and final assembly at the Bankstown(Sydney) and Fishermen&#x27;s Bend ( Melbourne) plants. In 1998 the company was bought by Tenix and Hawker Pacific was sold to Swedish company Celsius. In 2000 Tenix sold HdH to Boeing which merged the company with ASTA to form Hawker de Havilland Aerospace within Boeing Australia. Today HdH is in the forefront of composite structures technology and manufactures composite and alloy components for the Airbus A320 family, Airbus A330, Airbus A340, Airbus A380, Bombardier Challenger 300, Boeing 737, Boeing 747 and Boeing 777 as well as for several military aerospace programmes.

<text>Petrie railway station is located on the North Coast line in Queensland, Australia. It serves the suburb of Petrie in the City of Moreton Bay. It opened as North Pine railway station in 1888 after the nearby North Pine River and was renamed Petrie railway station (after local pioneer Thomas Petrie) in 1911.

The station has five platforms. As part of the Redcliffe Peninsula line, the station was expanded with a new island platform built east of the existing platforms. It opened along with the rest of the line on 4 October 2016. As part of the project, a third track was added south of the station to Lawnton. North of the station, the Redcliffe Peninsula line branches off.

== Services ==
Petrie is served by all City network services from Gympie North, Nambour, Caboolture &amp; Kippa-Ring to Brisbane, many continuing to Ipswich, Rosewood and Springfield Central.
==Services by platform==


==Transport links==
Prior to the October 2016 opening of the Redcliffe Peninsula line, Petrie station was served by 10 bus routes connecting it to nearby suburbs, but after the opening only two remain.

<text>Boeing Australia is Boeing&#x27;s largest subdivision outside the United States. Established in 1997, the company oversees its seven wholly owned subsidiaries, consolidating and co-ordinating Boeing&#x27;s businesses and operations in Australia.

Boeing has played a role in Australia&#x27;s aerospace industry through its products and services and has more than 4,500 employees spread across 38 locations in every state and territory except Tasmania. With an investment of more than $800 million, Boeing generates approximately $400 million in export revenue for Australia through its commercial and defence products and services.

==History of Boeing in Australia==
Boeing began working in Australia through its subsidiary Boeing Aerostructures Australia, which was formerly known as de Havilland Australia Company and established in 1927. It became Hawker de Havilland Australia in 1961 and acquired the former Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC) in 1986. Boeing acquired de Havilland Australia including CAC and ASTA in 2000 which became Boeing Aerostructures Australia.

This was its second direct investment in the continent since purchasing Rockwell International in 1996. Rockwell Australia became Boeing Australia in 1996. In 1997, Boeing bought Aerospace Technologies of Australia, which until the 1980s was known as Government Aircraft Factories. The five remaining subsidiaries were acquired as follows: Jeppesen in 2000, Alteon in 2002, Aviall in 2006, and Insitu Pacific in 2009.

In 2012, Boeing Australia closed a Bankstown factory in Sydney with operations consolidated at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne.

=== Boeing Defence, Space &amp; Security ===
Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security (BDS) products and services placed in or destined for Australia include:
* C-17 Globemaster III military transports,
* CH-47 Chinook helicopters,
* Boeing 737 Wedgetail AEW&amp;C Wedgetail aircraft,
* F/A-18 Hornets,
* F/A-18F Super Hornets,
* aerospace support, such as F-111 Through Life Support and the F/A-18 Hornet Upgrade Program.
* delivery of 6th C-17 to Australia
* Army aviation training and training support,
* Harpoon missile,
* Joint Direct Attack Munitions,
* Network-enabled systems,
* Defence High Frequency Communication System (DHFCS),
* ScanEagle unmanned air vehicle (UAV), and
* Joint participation on the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) Satellite program with the U.S. Air Force.

In Australia, BDS is represented in by its business unit Boeing Defence Australia (BDA), which is a defence aerospace enterprise. BDA supports some of the largest and most complex programs for the Commonwealth of Australia, the Australian Defence Force, and commercial customers. BDA also conducts operations and maintenance for classified programs and Australian Government sites, and operates in line with the three divisions of BDS - Boeing Military Aircraft, Global Services &amp; Support, and Network &amp; Space Systems.

These types of innovations in technology and investments are due to Boeing&#x27;s long term view of its business in Australia; its investment in the training and development of its people, and its deep belief in research and development to create the next generation of manufacturing technology.

=== Boeing Commercial Airplanes ===
Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) is a manufacturer of commercial planes. In Australia, BCA is represented by BCA Sales, which operates out of Boeing Australia&#x27;s Sydney office and provides sales and marketing support of BCA products, customer engineering, and quality control/procurement functions.

BCA opened its first Australian office in Sydney in 1959 when Qantas became the first international customer for Boeing&#x27;s first passenger jet, the Boeing 707, which changed air travel for Australians by drastically reducing flight times to the rest of the world. The Boeing 737 has also played an important role in the growth of aviation in Australia.

BCA is also supported in Australia by Boeing Aerostructures Australia (BAA, formerly Hawker de Havilland, Government Aircraft Factories and Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation). BAA designs, tests, certifies and produces world class advanced structures. Despite predominantly commercial customers, BAA is also responsible for the design and manufacture of structures to the defence industry. Based at Melbourne&#x27;s Fishermans Bend, the company has a long heritage in Australian aviation that began with its legacy companies in 1927 and has included the manufacture of aircraft which served in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II.

BAA is Australia&#x27;s only designer and manufacturer of advanced composite aerostructure components for commercial aircraft. Boeing Aerostructures Australia manufactures the &#x27;moveable trailing edge&#x27; control surfaces of the Boeing 787 using a unique carbon fibre production technology developed in Victoria called resin infusion. This is Australia&#x27;s largest aerospace contract valued at $5 billion over 20 years, and Fishermans Bend is the only Boeing location in the world to apply the unique resin infusion system that enables the components to be cured without a traditional autoclave. Boeing Aerostructures Australia has invested $70 million in site improvements to support 787 production increases over the next decade.

In addition to work on the 787 moveable trailing edge, Boeing Aerostructures Australia&#x27;s over 1000 employees produce flight control products such as 737 rudders, winglets and sole source supply for ailerons, as well as Boeing 777 cove lip doors, elevators and rudders.

Another component of BCA is its Commercial Aviation Services (CAS) unit, which provides materials and engineering services to Boeing customers in-country. In Australia, Alteon Training Australia, Aviall, Jeppesen Australia, and Jeppesen Marine come under CAS&#x27; family of companies.

Boeing Field Service is also part of CAS. Field Service provides on-site technical advice to Boeing customers and can call resolve operator problems with access to BCA technical resources. Field Service representatives are located in Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne.

=== Boeing Research and Technology ===
In September 2003, Boeing Company initiated with the University of Queensland School of IT and Electrical Engineering (ITEE) a new Boeing Systems Engineering Teaching Laboratory to fill skills shortages in aviation and aerospace industry in Australia. Boeing also made a $1.55M grant for the founding of a Boeing Professorship in Systems Engineering for 5 years occupied by Professor Peter A Lindsay. Boeing provided funding with respect to the Wedgetail 737 Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) project with the Commonwealth of Australia.

This fostered Defence Industries Queensland in Queensland Department of State Development, Infrastructure and Planning with Boeing Defence Australia at RAAF Base Amberley.

In March 2008, Boeing established a branch of its advanced research and development (R&amp;D) unit – Boeing Research &amp; Technology (BR&amp;T) – in Australia to provide an R&amp;D organisation for its in-country businesses and to collaborate with Australian R&amp;D organisations, including universities and private sector R&amp;D providers, the CSIRO and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO).

<text>Dwyane Tyrone Wade Jr. ( or , born January 17, 1982) is an American former professional basketball player who is currently the host of the American adaptation of &quot;The Cube&quot;. Widely regarded as one of the greatest shooting guards in NBA history, he spent the majority of his 16-year career playing for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and won three NBA championships, was a 13-time NBA All-Star, an eight-time member of the All-NBA Team, and a three-time member of the All-Defensive Team. Wade is also Miami&#x27;s all-time leader in points, games played, assists, steals, shots made, and shots taken.

After a successful college basketball career with the Marquette Golden Eagles, including leading the team to the Final Four in 2003, Wade was drafted fifth overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Heat. In his third season, Wade led the Heat to their first NBA Championship and was named the 2006 NBA Finals MVP. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, he led the United States men&#x27;s basketball team, commonly known as the &quot;Redeem Team&quot;, in scoring and helped them capture the gold medal. In the 2008–09 season, Wade led the league in both total points (2,386) and points per game (30.2), the latter stat earning him his lone NBA scoring title. Wade was selected as the NBA All-Star Game MVP in 2010. With LeBron James and Chris Bosh, he helped guide Miami to four consecutive NBA Finals from 2011 to 2014, and won back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. In July 2016, Wade briefly left Miami to play for the Chicago Bulls and the Cleveland Cavaliers for a season and a half before being traded back to Miami in February 2018 where he finished his playing career and retired in 2019. The Heat retired Wade&#x27;s #3 jersey in 2020. He purchased a minority ownership stake in the Utah Jazz in 2021 and became a minority stakeholder of the WNBA&#x27;s Chicago Sky in 2023. In October 2021, Wade was honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. In 2023, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Wade was born the second of two children to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr. in Chicago, Illinois, on January 17, 1982. Wade attributes the uncommon spelling of his and his father&#x27;s first name to his grandmother. JoLinda already had two children when she married Wade&#x27;s father, and with him she had Dwyane and his older sister Tragil. The pair separated when Wade was four months old. He described his early childhood in the South Side of Chicago as trying.

When his parents got divorced, JoLinda was given custody of Wade and his sister. JoLinda struggled with drug addiction and often committed crimes that sent her to prison. At eight years old, Tragil tricked Dwyane into thinking they were going to the movies, only to take him to live with his father and stepmother. Wade visited his mother on occasion until his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois, after which Wade would not see her for two years.

Wade turned to basketball and football, avoiding the temptations of drugs and gangs. Wade credited Tragil as the person most responsible for pointing him in the right direction. Wade grew up idolizing Michael Jordan and modeled his game after him. On October 14, 2001, as Wade&#x27;s basketball career blossomed, JoLinda vowed to turn her life around. She says that she has not used drugs since 2003.

==High school career==
Wade played basketball and football for Harold L. Richards High School in Oak Lawn. He immediately excelled as a wide receiver and also played as a backup quarterback, but success in basketball took longer. Wade grew four inches by the start of his junior year and emerged as the team leader, averaging 20.7 points and 7.6 rebounds.

Wade&#x27;s improvement continued into his senior year, when he averaged 27 points and 11 rebounds. Wade led the Bulldogs to a 24–5 record and to a Class AA Eisenhower Sectional appearance. He set school records for points scored (676) and steals made (106). Wade credited coach Jack Fitzgerald as a seminal and positive influence. Wade was recruited to play basketball only by Marquette, Illinois State, and DePaul due to low ACT scores.

==College career==
Wade committed to Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to play under coach Tom Crean. In his freshman year, Wade was sidelined by NCAA Proposition 48, which set academic eligibility requirements for participation in Division I sports. Effort and tutoring sufficiently raised his academic standing so that Wade became eligible by the start of his sophomore year.

===2001–02 season===
Wade led the Marquette Golden Eagles in scoring with 17.8 points (ppg) and led Conference USA in both steals per game with 2.47 and two-point field goals made with 205; he averaged 6.6 rebounds and 3.4 assists. Marquette finished with a 26–7 record, their best since the 1993–94 season.

===2002–03 season===
Wade again led the school in scoring with 21.5 points and the Golden Eagles finished with a 27–6 record. Three days after JoLinda was released from prison, she saw Wade play basketball for the first time in five years as Marquette upset the Cincinnati Bearcats, 70–61, to capture the Conference USA title on March 8, 2003. He helped bring the Golden Eagles to the Final Four for the first time since their 1977 national championship season. Wade was subsequently named to the All-America First Team by the Associated Press (AP), making him the first basketball player from Marquette to receive the distinction since 1978.

Wade&#x27;s performance during the Midwest Regional final drew national attention. Against a top-seeded Kentucky team, he delivered 29 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists, including a memorable breakaway dunk, as Marquette upset the Wildcats, 83–69, and advanced to the Final Four for the first time since 1977. Wade&#x27;s triple double was the fourth ever recorded in NCAA tournament history. The Golden Eagles finished their season as No. 6 in the AP Poll, Marquette&#x27;s highest ranking since 1976–77. Wade was named the MVP of the Midwest Regional. His performance earned him a high NBA draft projection. As a result, Wade skipped his senior year to enter the 2003 NBA draft.

Marquette retired Wade&#x27;s 3 jersey on February 3, 2007. It ordinarily requires student-athletes to have graduated for jersey retirement, but made an exception for Wade.

==Professional career==

===Miami Heat (2003–2016)===

====Rookie year (2003–04)====

Selected fifth in the 2003 NBA draft by the Miami Heat, Wade became the highest ranked of only four Marquette first round draft picks. He quickly emerged as a productive player, averaging 16.2 points on 46.5% shooting as well as 4.0 rebounds and 4.5 assists. After a 5–15 start, the Heat gradually improved to finish 42–40 and qualify for the playoffs. Wade served up outstanding postseason performances, particularly against the Indiana Pacers during the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Wade earned a unanimous selection to the 2004 NBA All-Rookie Team and finished third in Rookie of the Year voting (after LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony). He placed among the top five rookies in several statistical categories, including second in field goal percentage, second in steals, third in scoring, fourth in assists, and fourth in minutes played.

In the first playoff game, Wade hit a running jumper with 1.3 seconds left in the final quarter to give the Heat an 81–79 victory over the New Orleans Hornets. Winning that series 4–3, the Heat faced the Pacers, who were the top-seeded team with the best record in the NBA. The Heat lost the series 4–2. Wade became only the fourth rookie in the shot clock era to lead his team in points and assists during the postseason.

====Breakthrough year (2004–05)====

The Heat traded with the Los Angeles Lakers for center Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. Improving on their previous season&#x27;s 42–40 record by 17 games, Miami went 59–23, leading the Eastern Conference. Wade earned a reserve slot in the season&#x27;s All-Star Game; adding 14 points in 24 minutes of play.

In the first round of the 2005 playoffs, Wade averaged 26.3 points, 8.8 assists, and 6 rebounds a night while maintaining a 50% field-goal percentage as the Heat swept the New Jersey Nets. In the second round, he averaged 31 points, seven rebounds, and eight assists per game as the Heat swept the Washington Wizards. The Heat lost the Eastern Conference Finals 4–3 to the Detroit Pistons, the previous season&#x27;s champions. Wade scored 42 points in Game 2 and 36 points in Game 3 despite playing with sinusitis, the flu, and a knee strain. He suffered a strained rib muscle in Game 5 that prevented him from playing in the sixth game and limited him in the seventh.

====NBA champion and Finals MVP (2005–06)====

In the 2005–06 season, Wade was elected to the All-Star Game as a starter. During 30 minutes of play, he put up 20 points on 9-of-11 field goals. Wade finished the regular season averaging 27.2 points, 6.7 assists, 5.7 rebounds, and 1.95 steals.

In the first round of the 2006 playoffs, Miami played the Chicago Bulls. Wade incurred several injuries, including a severely bruised hip during Game 5. He scored 15 of his 28 points while suffering intense pain, to give the Heat a 3–2 series lead. Wade led the Heat past the Detroit Pistons despite experiencing flu-like symptoms in Game 6. In the series-clinching contest, he landed 14 points and 10 assists.

During the 2006 NBA Finals, Miami faced the Dallas Mavericks. Wade&#x27;s 42, 36, and 43 points in Games 3, 4, and 5, respectively, helped the Heat go from a 0–2 deficit to a 3–2 series lead. In Game 3, Wade&#x27;s 42 points tied his playoff-high and his 13 rebounds were a career-high. The Heat took Game 6 behind Wade&#x27;s 36 points, taking the series 4–2, earning Wade the Finals MVP trophy. He became the fifth-youngest player in NBA history to capture the Finals MVP award, and his 34.7 points were the Finals&#x27; third-highest among players in their first NBA Finals. His 33.8 player efficiency rating (PER) over the NBA Finals was ranked by John Hollinger of ESPN as the best since the NBA-ABA merger.

====Injuries and missing playoffs (2006–2008)====
In the 2006–07 season, Wade missed 31 games due to injury; even so, he was elected to his third consecutive All-Star Game and received All-NBA honors. Wade became the first guard to earn All-NBA honors after missing 31 or more games since Pete Maravich. The Heat struggled with injuries in general and were 20–25 on February 1, 2007. Playing the Houston Rockets on February 21, 2007, Wade dislocated his left shoulder and left the court in a wheelchair. Wade chose to delay surgery and instead rehabilitate his shoulder in time for the postseason. After missing 23 games, Wade returned to the active roster. Sporting a black shoulder sleeve, Wade played 27 minutes and notched 12 points and 8 assists in the 111–103 overtime loss. For the season, Wade averaged 27.4 points, 7.5 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.1 steals, while shooting 50% from the field; further, he finished the season as the NBA PER leader.

During the 2007 playoffs, Wade averaged 23.5 points, 6.3 assists, and 4.8 rebounds per contest, but were swept in the first round by the Chicago Bulls. Post-playoffs, Wade underwent a pair of surgeries to repair his dislocated left shoulder and left knee, both of which proved successful. However, the knee ailment, commonly called &quot;jumper&#x27;s knee&quot;, prevented Wade from joining USA Basketball in the Olympic Qualifying Tournament over that summer.

After missing the Tournament of Americas&#x27; Olympic Qualifiers as well as the preseason and the first seven games, Wade began the 2007–08 season on November 14, 2007. Despite battling pain in his injured knee throughout the season, Wade was elected to his fourth consecutive All-Star Game appearance. However, the Heat held the worst record in the NBA. Wade&#x27;s knee problems led Riley sit Wade for the final 21 games to undergo long overdue OssaTron treatment. Wade averaged 24.6 points, 6.9 assists, 4.2 rebounds, and 1.7 steals.

====Scoring champion and playoff defeats (2008–2010)====

After months of rehab, he helped the U.S. National Team win gold at the 2008 Olympics, leading the team in scoring. Wade returned to the starting lineup to begin the 2008–09 campaign. Early that season, Wade became the second player in NBA history to post at least 40 points, 10 assists, and five blocks in a single game since Alvan Adams in 1976–77. Wade was elected to his fifth consecutive All-Star Game.

After the All-Star break, Wade recorded 50 points on 56.6% shooting along with 5 rebounds and 5 assists during a blow-out loss to the Orlando Magic; making him the fourth in NBA history to score at least 50 points in a game that his team lost by at least 20. In the next game, Wade recorded a career-high 16 assists and added 31 points and seven rebounds. Wade became the second player to record 15 or more assists after scoring 50-plus points since Wilt Chamberlain. Two games later, Wade tied a franchise record, scoring 24 points in the final quarter to secure a 120–115 win over the New York Knicks. For the game, Wade recorded 46 points on 55% field goal shooting, plus 10 assists, eight rebounds, four steals, and three blocked shots. In the next game, he scored 40 points against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Wade put up 41 points on 53% shooting along with 9 assists, seven steals, seven rebounds, and a block in the 107–100 loss. The following game, Wade tied his career-high with 16 assists and added 35 points on 62% shooting, six rebounds, plus a steal and a block, as the Heat beat the Phoenix Suns 135–129. Wade became the only player in Heat history to have multiple games with 30-plus points and 15 or more assists. Less than a week later, Wade hit the buzzer-beater and tied his earlier franchise record with his 78th straight double-digit scoring game in double-overtime against the Chicago Bulls. Wade finished the game with 48 points on 71.4% shooting, 12 assists, six rebounds, four steals, and three blocks in 50 minutes of play. Wade joined Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to record that many points and that many assists in a single game while having as high of a field goal percentage. Two games later, Wade surpassed Alonzo Mourning to become the Heat&#x27;s all-time leading scorer in triple overtime versus the Utah Jazz. Wade finished that 140–129 victory with 50 points to go along with his 10 rebounds, nine assists, four steals, and two blocks.

Wade became the only player to reach 2,000 points, 500 assists, 150 steals, and 100 blocks as well as the only player under to block upwards of 100 shots in a single season. He became the fifth player to accumulate 2,000 points, 500 assists, and 150 steals in a season. Wade helped the Heat clinch a playoff berth and become only the second team to make the postseason after winning 15 or fewer games the season before. In a 122–105 victory over the New York Knicks, Wade recorded a career-high 55 points on 63% field goal shooting and added nine rebounds and four assists. Wade recorded 50 points in only three quarters and was pulled out of the game, one point shy of eclipsing Glen Rice&#x27;s 56-point franchise record. Wade averaged a league-leading 30.2 points for his first NBA scoring title. He added 7.5 assists, 5 rebounds, 2.2 steals, and 1.3 blocks. Wade wrapped up the season with higher point, assist, steal, and block averages than James and Kobe Bryant, both of whom finished ahead of Wade in the MVP race.

On November 1, in what was only his third game of the 2009–10 season, Wade recorded his 10,000th career point during a 95–87 victory over the Chicago Bulls. On November 12 against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Wade made a spectacular dunk over Anderson Varejão. Although the Heat lost by a score of 111–104, LeBron James regarded the dunk as &quot;great, probably top 10 all-time.&quot; The next day against the New Jersey Nets, Wade hit another buzzer beater for a one-point win at 81–80. On January 6, Wade scored a season-high 44 points during a 112–106 overtime loss to the Boston Celtics, the most in a losing effort that season. Wade appeared in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game. Wade was named the game&#x27;s MVP with 28 points, 11 assists, six rebounds, and five steals.

On February 17, Wade strained his calf. He left the game, ending his personal and the Heat&#x27;s franchise-record streak of 148 consecutive games with at least 10 points. Wade was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for the fifth time and Player of the Week twice for his play in the month of March. He averaged 26.9 and 7.5 assists, both of which ranked third in the Eastern Conference, and 2.3 steals per game, which ranked first. Wade recorded six 30-point games and had six double-doubles in the month, including a season-high 14 assists.

For the season, Wade averaged 26.6 points on 47.6% field goal shooting to go with 6.5 assists, 4.8 rebounds, 1.8 steals and 1.1 blocks; doing so, he led his team to a 47–35 record and the fifth playoff seed. In the first round, down 0–3 against the Boston Celtics, Wade recorded a career playoff and franchise record with 46 points; he outscored the entire Celtics team in the fourth quarter. It was Wade&#x27;s sixth career playoff game with at least 40 points. Despite his averaging 33.2 points on 56.4% shooting, 6.8 assists, 5.6 rebounds, 1.6 steals, and 1.6 blocks per contest, the Heat fell to Boston in five games.

====Big Three era and back-to-back championships (2010–2014)====

During the off-season, the Miami-Dade County commission renamed the area &quot;Miami-Wade County&quot; from July 1 to 7, a week that coincided with the start of free agency, intended to help convince Wade to stay with the Heat. On July 7, it was announced that Wade would sign with Miami, along with Toronto Raptors star Chris Bosh. The following day, LeBron James announced he would join the Heat.

In the first year of the Big Three Era, the Heat finished with a 58–24 record and earned the second seed in the Eastern Conference. Wade averaged 25.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 1.5 steals while shooting 50%. After defeating the Philadelphia 76ers, Boston Celtics, and Chicago Bulls, the Heat reached the NBA Finals but ultimately fell to the Dallas Mavericks in six games. Wade averaged 26.5 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 5.2 assists for the Finals and 24.5 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 4.4 assists for the playoffs.

On February 26, 2012, Wade recorded the third triple-double in the history of the All-Star Game, posting 24 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, joining Jordan and James. On March 10, 2012, Wade made the game-winning shot against the Indiana Pacers, giving the Heat a 93–91 overtime victory. Wade finished the season averaging 22.1 points, 4.8 assists, 4.6 rebounds, and 1.7 steals. The Heat defeated the New York Knicks in 5 games and the Indiana Pacers in six games. In Game 6 of the second round, Wade recorded 41 points and 10 rebounds. The Heat prevailed in seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals, beating the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games. Wade averaged 22.6 points. The Heat became the first team in NBA history to win a championship after trailing in three playoff series.

Before the start of the 2012–13 season, Wade underwent left knee surgery, missing the 2012 Summer Olympics. On December 26, 2012, playing the Charlotte Bobcats, Wade kicked guard Ramon Sessions in the groin. The following day, Wade was suspended by the NBA for one game. Wade finished the 2012–13 season with averages of 21.2 points, 5.0 rebounds and 5.1 assists.

In the playoffs, injuries limited Wade to a career-low scoring average of 15.9 points per game, but he upped his average to 19.6 points during the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs. After the teams split the first two games in Miami, the Spurs took Game 3. In Game 4, Wade scored 32 points on 56 percent shooting to go along with six steals as the Heat won 109–93. The Spurs took Game 5 despite Wade&#x27;s 25 points and 10 assists. Wade scored 14 points in Miami&#x27;s overtime win in Game 6, followed by 23 points and 10 rebounds in Game 7 as the Heat clinched their second straight championship and Wade&#x27;s third title.

In the 2013–14 season, Wade missed 28 games from injuries and the team&#x27;s decision to rest him during &quot;back-to-back&quot; games. Wade averaged 19 points and posted a career-high 54% field goal percentage. In the playoffs, the team increased Wade&#x27;s minutes, highlighted by a 28-point performance in Miami&#x27;s second-round victory over the Brooklyn Nets and a 23-point outing in a road victory against Indiana in the Eastern Finals. The Heat won the series in six games, advancing to their fourth straight NBA Finals. Wade averaged 19.1 points on 52 percent shooting, his best playoff percentage since 2010. The Heat lost to the San Antonio Spurs in the 2014 NBA Finals in five games.

====Post-Big Three era (2014–2016)====

On June 28, 2014, Wade, James, and Bosh all opted out of their contracts in order to cut costs, but intended to re-sign. James then announced that he was returning to Cleveland. Wade and Bosh re-signed with the Heat, joined by Udonis Haslem, Chris Andersen, and Mario Chalmers as well as former rivals Danny Granger and Luol Deng.

In the 2014–15 season, Wade missed seven consecutive games due to a hamstring injury. On December 17 against the Utah Jazz, he scored a season-high 42 points, his highest total in almost four years, but Miami lost 105–87. Wade was again named an All-Star but pulled out due to another hamstring injury. The Heat finished the season with a 37–45 record, as Wade missed the postseason for just the second time in his career.

On June 29, 2015, Wade opted out of his contract, but then signed a one-year, $20 million contract. Wade hit just seven three-point shots during the 2015–16 regular season. However, in the 2016 postseason, Wade converted on his first seven three-point shot attempts. Wade had never made more than five three-pointers in a row.

===Chicago Bulls (2016–2017)===
In July 2016, Wade joined his hometown team, the Chicago Bulls, on a two-year deal worth approximately $47 million. Initially, the Heat offered him a two-year, $20 million contract, before increasing it to a two-year, $40 million offer, both of which Wade felt were unacceptable. On November 4, 2016, Wade scored a game-high 35 points and grabbed 10 rebounds during a 117–104 loss to the New York Knicks.

Wade teamed up with Jimmy Butler and Rajon Rondo in Chicago. In January 2017, the trio were all fined for criticizing their young teammates&#x27; effort. In March 2017, Wade sustained a fractured elbow but returned for the playoffs. However, the Bulls were defeated 4–2 by the Boston Celtics in the first round.

=== Cleveland Cavaliers (2017–2018) ===

On September 24, 2017, three months after trading Butler and waiving Rondo, the Bulls reached an agreement on a buyout with Wade. Three days later, he signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers and reunited with former Miami Heat teammate LeBron James.

During the season, Wade objected to coach Tyronn Lue&#x27;s plan to play him off the bench. Wade started for the Cavaliers in the first three games of the season, but shot only 7-for-25. After a 114–93 loss to the Orlando Magic during the third game, in which Wade scored only five points, he volunteered to take a bench role and became the leader of the second unit.

===Return to Miami (2018–2019)===
On February 8, 2018, at the NBA trade deadline, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster. Acquiring guards Jordan Clarkson, George Hill and Rodney Hood, the Cavaliers traded Wade back to the Miami Heat in exchange for a protected 2024 second-round draft pick. At the funeral of Wade&#x27;s long-time agent Henry Thomas in January, Wade mended relations with Riley.

On February 9, in his first game back with the Heat, Wade was garnered a standing ovation and recorded three points, two rebounds, two assists, and two blocks off the bench in a 91–85 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. On February 27, he scored a season-high 27 points and made the game-winning shot as the Heat rallied to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 102–101. On April 3, in a 101–98 victory over the Atlanta Hawks, Wade reached 5,000 assists in a Heat uniform, becoming the ninth player to score 20,000 points and collect 5,000 assists with one team, joining Karl Malone, Bryant, Jordan, James, Larry Bird, John Havlicek, Oscar Robertson and Jerry West. On April 16, Wade scored 28 points to end the 76ers&#x27; 17-game winning streak and lead the Heat to a 113–103 Game 2 win over Philadelphia and even the first-round playoff series. He passed Larry Bird for 10th on the NBA&#x27;s career postseason scoring list.

In the offseason, Wade announced his intentions to retire after the 2018–19 season, re-signing with the Heat on September 18. Wade missed seven games in mid-November due to the birth of his daughter. On November 25, Wade scored a season-high 35 points in a 125–115 loss to the Toronto Raptors, setting a record for the most points scored by a Miami bench player. On December 9, he scored 25 points in his 1,000th career game as the Heat defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 121–98.

On January 6, 2019, Wade became the third player in NBA history to record at least 20,000 points, 5,000 assists, 4,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals, 800 blocks and 500 three-pointers. He was named by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver as a special roster addition for the 2019 All-Star game, thus marking his 13th All-Star appearance. Wade had received the second-most fan votes for guards in the Eastern Conference. On February 27, he recorded 25 points and made the game-winning three-pointer in a 126–125 victory over the Golden State Warriors. On April 9, Wade played his last home game in Miami, scoring 30 points in a 122–99 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. In his final game against the Brooklyn Nets the following night, Wade recorded his fifth career triple-double with 25 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists as the Heat lost by a score of 113–94.

On January 7, 2020, the Heat announced that Wade&#x27;s 3 jersey would be retired on February 22.

== Basketball executive career ==
During his playing career with Miami, Wade had discussed the potential for a future ownership stake in the Heat franchise. However, Wade was unable to commit at the time, according to Heat owner Micky Arison.

On April 16, 2021, it was announced that Wade had purchased an undisclosed minority ownership stake in the Utah Jazz franchise of the NBA, joining an ownership group led by his personal friend and associate, Ryan Smith, the Jazz majority owner and team governor. Wade is a member of a small ownership group that includes Smith, his wife Ashley, investor and Accel partner Ryan Sweeney, Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes and the Miller family, which previously owned the team.

Wade said in the announcement of his purchase that he hoped to take a hands-on approach to his involvement, and highlighted his close brother-like relationship with Jazz star Donovan Mitchell, who he called the player most like him and &quot;2.0&quot;.

On July 14, 2023, it was announced that Wade joined the ownership group of the WNBA franchise Chicago Sky as a minority stakeholder.

==National team career==

Wade was a member of the 2004 Olympic team, which won a bronze medal in Athens. The team competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, in which Wade averaged 19.3 points per game. The U.S. national team won a bronze medal. Wade was named to the national team roster from 2006 to 2008; and, together with James and Anthony, Wade co-captained the 2006 team.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics, the United States went undefeated and captured gold medal honors after beating Spain, the 2006 World champions. Wade, who led the team in scoring, tallied a game-high 27 points in 27 minutes on 75% field goal shooting and added four steals, two assists, and two rebounds. Wade averaged a team-high 16 points in 18 minutes on 67% field goal shooting, four rebounds, two assists, and 2.3 steals, as the U.S. lived up to their Redeem Team moniker and claimed gold medal honors for the first time since 2000.

==Player profile==

Listed at tall and weighing , Wade was a shooting guard who could play point guard as he did during his rookie season and with smaller lineups. On offense, Wade was one of the quickest and most difficult players to guard, as well as one of the best slashers in NBA history. His signature one-two step allowed him to dash past bigger defenders and draw fouls. Wade ranked first in free-throw attempts per 48 minutes in 2004–05 and again in the 2006–07 season. He was an unselfish player, averaging 5.4 assists for his career. After winning the NBA Finals MVP Award in 2006, Wade developed a reputation as one of the league&#x27;s premier clutch players.

David Thorpe, an athletic trainer who runs a training center for NBA players, cited Wade&#x27;s post-up game as one of his strengths. Thorpe said that Wade&#x27;s best moves from the post were his turnaround jump shot, double pivot, and what Thorpe termed a &quot;freeze fake&quot;, a pump fake Wade used to get his opponent to jump, so that Wade could drive around him. Wade&#x27;s main weakness was three-point shooting as he averaged only 29% for his career.

Wade was best known for being able to convert difficult lay-ups, even after hard mid-air collisions with larger defenders. His style drew concerns over the dangers of playing in this manner, as Wade had hurt his knees and wrists after mid-air collisions with larger players. Wade established himself on defense for his ability to block shots and accumulate steals. Wade holds the NBA record for blocks by players listed and under, which he achieved in only 679 games; this is over 400 games less than the previous record-holder Dennis Johnson (1,100).

In 2022, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Wade as the 28th greatest player in NBA history.

===Statue===
In January 2024, the Heat announced that they were going to unveil a statue of Wade in front of Kaseya Center later that year. The statue was unveiled on October 27, 2024, and was universally panned by fans and critics, who negatively compared its appearance to Laurence Fishburne and the discourse around the unveiling to the bust of Cristiano Ronaldo created by Emanuel Santos in 2017. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; described Wade&#x27;s statue as &quot;the worst statue in the history of sports&quot;. Charles Barkley said that although the statue was &quot;a great honor&quot;, it was ugly and should be taken down.

==Personal life==

In 2002, Wade married his high school girlfriend Siohvaughn Funches. They split in 2007, and he divorced her in 2010 after an acrimonious court battle. In 2011, Wade was granted sole custody of his two children. He also raises a nephew, the son of Wade&#x27;s sister Deanna. Wade began dating actress Gabrielle Union in 2008. According to Wade, he and Union briefly split up at some point early in 2013 due to career demands. During that time, Wade and Aja Metoyer conceived a child. Wade and Union became engaged in December 2013 and got married in Miami on August 30, 2014. On November 7, 2018, Wade became a father for the fourth time, when he and Union welcomed their daughter, who was born via surrogate. In 2020, Wade&#x27;s 12-year-old child came out as a transgender girl and changed her name to Zaya. During an April 2023 interview, Wade said that he moved his family out of Florida partially due to the state&#x27;s anti-LGBTQ laws.

Wade&#x27;s nicknames include D-Wade, Father Prime, and Flash, the lattermost was given to him by former teammate Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, who would sing, &quot;He&#x27;s the greatest in the Universe&quot;, in reference to the Queen song of the same name from the 1980 film &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. The Heat&#x27;s 2005 NBA playoffs run and Wade&#x27;s performances while O&#x27;Neal was hampered by injury, led to media attention and rapid increase in Wade&#x27;s popularity. During those playoffs, Wade&#x27;s jersey became the league&#x27;s top-selling jersey and remained so for nearly two years. After the Heat&#x27;s success and Wade&#x27;s memorable performances during the 2006 NBA playoffs, Wade appeared on several talk shows, including &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;. He also made a guest star appearance on Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Austin &amp; Ally&quot; as himself, who is an obsessed fan of Austin Moon.

Wade has been featured in magazine articles and publications. In 2005, he was featured on &quot;People&quot;&#x27;s 50 Most Beautiful People. The following year, Wade was named the NBA&#x27;s best-dressed player by &quot;GQ&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Esquire&quot; named him to their fourth annual Best Dressed Men in the World list for the second straight year. Wade&#x27;s endorsement deals included Gatorade, Lincoln, Staples, Sean John, T-Mobile (his TV commercials paired him with Charles Barkley), and Topps. He had his own line of shoes with Converse named &quot;The Wade&quot; and a series of Sidekick phones known as the D-Wade Edition with T-Mobile. During the 2009–10 season, Wade switched from Converse to Nike&#x27;s Jordan Brand. He was chosen by Jordan and debuted the Air Jordan 2010 during the 2010 NBA All-Star break. During the 2011 NBA playoffs, Wade debuted his first signature shoe for the Jordan Brand, joining Anthony and Chris Paul, who had their own signature shoes. After his Jordan Brand contract expired in 2012, Wade signed with the Chinese athletic brand Li-Ning. Wade was included in &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 most influential people of 2020. In April 2021, Wade became a minority owner of the Utah Jazz. In October 2021, Wade&#x27;s oldest son, Zaire Wade got drafted by the Salt Lake City Stars, which is the NBA G League affiliate of the Jazz.

===Philanthropy===

Wade is well known for his philanthropic involvement. In 2003, Wade founded The Wade&#x27;s World Foundation, which provides support to community-based organizations that promote education, health, and social skills for children in at-risk situations. He hosts a variety of community outreach programs in Chicago and South Florida. In 2008, Wade announced his partnership with former teammate Alonzo Mourning&#x27;s charitable foundation and co-hosted ZO&#x27;s Summer Groove, an annual summer event. On December 24, 2008, Wade purchased a new home for a South Florida woman whose nephew accidentally burned down the family home. Wade also donated furnishings, clothing, and gifts to the family.
After breaking his own Miami Heat single-season scoring record, Wade gave the jersey he wore in that night&#x27;s victory to eight-year-old Michael Stolzenberg, an avid Heat fan who lost his hands and feet due to a bacterial infection. Wade stated that he knew Stolzenberg previously and wished to add to his collection of Heat memorabilia. Wade is known for visiting other sick children, usually in private to avoid the media spotlight.

In September 2009, Wade donated money from his foundation to keep the Robbins, Illinois public library from having to shut down. He handed library director Priscilla Coatney a $25,000 check in order to resurrect the building. In January 2010, Wade and Mourning co-founded The Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti&quot;, which raised money to help the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In the three days after the fund began soliciting donations from athletes, Wade announced that the &quot;Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti&quot; had already raised over $800,000. Wade stated, &quot;I expected nothing less from my friends and colleagues in the sports community, our commitment to this cause knows no bounds, and we will continue to accept any and all donations throughout the days ahead.&quot; Wade is also an avid supporter of St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital and served as an Ambassador for their Hoops for St. Jude basketball initiative.

===Religion===
Wade is a Christian and chose the number 3 throughout most of his career because it represents the Holy Trinity. His mother, Jolinda, strengthened her ties to Christianity in 2001 after years of drug problems. Jolinda served as a minister during her final prison sentence in 2002 and 2003. Jolinda was ordained as a Baptist minister in January 2007 and formed the non-denominational Temple of Praise Binding and Loosing Ministry in Chicago. In May 2008, Wade purchased a church building for his mother&#x27;s ministry. He tithes 10% of his salary to his mother&#x27;s church.

===Television===
In 2007, Wade appeared as a role model on Season 3, Episode 13, of &quot;Supernanny&quot; and gave advice to the family&#x27;s son. In 2019, he appeared as a guest judge on season 14 of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; alongside his wife, Gabrielle Union. Wade pressed the Golden Buzzer for dance group V.Unbeatable. In 2021, it was said that he would be the host of &quot;The Cube&quot;, which is currently aired on TBS.

===2020 tweet===
In July 2020, Wade tweeted in support of Nick Cannon, who was fired from ViacomCBS after making racist remarks and endorsing antisemitic conspiracy theories. Following some backlash, Wade later deleted his tweet and clarified that he had expressed his support of &quot;[Cannon&#x27;s ownership of] the content and [the] brand he helped create&quot;, and affirmed that he has &quot;zero tolerance for any hate speech.&quot;

==Health==
In December 2023, he underwent a partial (40%) nephrectomy to remove a cyst-tumor from his right kidney.

<text>First Men in the Moon (also known H.G. Wells&#x27; First Men in the Moon) is a 1964 British science fiction film, produced by Charles H. Schneer, directed by Nathan Juran, and starring Edward Judd, Martha Hyer and Lionel Jeffries. The film, distributed by Columbia Pictures, is an adaptation by screenwriter Nigel Kneale of H. G. Wells&#x27; 1901 novel &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot;. Ray Harryhausen provided the stop-motion animation effects, which include the Selenites, giant caterpillar-like &quot;Moon Cows&quot; and the large-brained Grand Lunar.

==Plot==
In 1964, the United Nations has launched a rocket flight to the Moon. A multi-national group of astronauts in the UN spacecraft land, believing themselves to be the first lunar explorers. However, upon embarking on their debut moonwalk, they discover a battered Union Jack flag on the surface and a handwritten note, dated some 65 years earlier, claiming the moon on behalf of Queen Victoria. Stranger still, the note is written on the back of a court summons for one Katherine Callender from the village of Dymchurch in England.

Attempting to trace Callender in the records office in Dymchurch in Kent, south-east England, the UN authorities discover that she has died, but that her widowed husband Arnold Bedford is still living in a nursing home known as &quot;The Limes&quot;. The home&#x27;s staff do not let him watch television reports of the Moon expedition because, according to the matron, it &quot;excites him&quot;. Bedford&#x27;s repeated lunar claims are dismissed as senile delusion. The UN representatives question him about the Moon, and he tells them his story, which is shown in flashback.

In 1899, Arnold Bedford lives in a romantic spot, Cherry Cottage, next to a canal lock in Dymchurch. His fiancée, Katherine Callender, known as Kate, arrives by car (driving herself), visiting the house for the first time. It is implied that Bedford is in financial difficulties by a letter about his rent being well past due. They meet a nearby neighbour, inventor Joseph Cavor, who wants to buy the cottage, just in case his experiments should damage it. Kate agrees to this on Bedfords behalf. Bedford begins spending time at Cavor&#x27;s house, where the inventor has a large laboratory. He has developed a substance, Cavorite, that will let anything it is applied to or made of nullify the force of gravity. He plans to use it to travel to the Moon. Bedford has deeds drawn up and signed in Kate&#x27;s name selling the cottage to Cavor for £5000...(in reality he is selling something that he does not own).

Cavor tempts Bedford by telling him there are gold nuggets on the Moon. He has already built a spherical spaceship in the greenhouse next to the cottage. The sphere is lined inside with green velvet, and it has electric lights. There is an explosion at Cavor&#x27;s house just as Kate arrives at the cottage. This is caused by Cavor&#x27;s assistant, Gibbs, leaving for the local pub instead of watching the boiler used for processing the Cavorite. He shows her deep sea diving suits intended to keep them both alive while on the lunar surface. The production of Cavorite is increased. Kate brings some things for the trip: gin and bitters, chickens, and an elephant gun. But she gives Bedford an ultimatum: &quot;Cavorite or me&quot;. Back at the cottage, Kate is served with a summons by a bailiff accompanied by a silent policeman. She has been charged with selling a property she does not own. Bedford and Cavor are just about to leave when Kate angrily hammers on the outside of the sphere wanting to know what he has done. They pull her inside just before the sphere launches.

On the long journey to the Moon they eat only sardines. The principle of steering is by rolling up blinds covering sections of the sphere to lessen the effect of the Cavorite in that one area and thus propelling it in that direction, but opening a blind causes the sphere to veer toward the Sun. They eventually crash land on the lunar surface, and both men don the diving suits. Kate is placed inside an air-tight compartment since she is unable to accompany them.

While exploring the lunar surface, Bedford and Cavor fall down a vertical shaft, where there is breathable air. They discover an insectoid population, the Selenites, living beneath the surface in large caverns. (Cavor coins this name for the creatures after the Greek goddess of the Moon, Selene). While being herded by them, Bedford attacks a group of Selenites out of fear, killing several, despite Cavor&#x27;s horrified protests. After escaping, the two men discover that the sphere, still containing Kate, has been dragged into the underground city.

They are attacked by a giant caterpillar-like &quot;Moon Bull&quot;, which pursues them until the Selenites are able to dispatch it with their ray weapons. Cavor and Bedford see the city&#x27;s power station, a perpetual motion machine powered by sunlight. The Selenites quickly learn English and interrogate Cavor, who believes they wish to exchange scientific knowledge. Cavor has a discussion with the &quot;Grand Lunar&quot;, the ruling entity of the Selenites. Bedford makes the assumption that Cavor, and presumably all humanity, is now on trial, he attempts to kill the Grand Lunar with the elephant gun, failing because of Cavor&#x27;s interference. Now running for their lives, Bedford manages to find the sphere, and he and Kate are able to make an escape. Cavor voluntarily stays behind on the Moon.

Bedford flies the sphere up a vertical shaft of light, shattering the massive window-like covering at the top, and he and Kate return to Earth. He concludes his story by mentioning that they came down in the sea off the coast of Zanzibar, their sphere sinking without trace. They managed to swim ashore, but Cavor&#x27;s ultimate fate remained unknown to them.

In the present, Bedford, the UN party, and newspaper reporters watch on television the latest events on the Moon. The UN astronauts have broken into the Selenite&#x27;s underground city and find it deserted and decaying. The ruined city begins to crumble and collapse, forcing the astronauts to hastily retreat to the surface. Seconds later the entire lunar city is completely destroyed. Bedford realizes that the Selenites must have succumbed to Cavor&#x27;s common cold virus to which they had no immunity.

==Production==
===Development===
Harryhausen was planning on following &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; (1963) with a version of H.G. Wells&#x27; 1904 novel &quot;The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth&quot; when he met with writer Nigel Kneale. Harryhausen had long wanted to film Wells&#x27; &quot;First Men in the Moon&quot; but producer Charles Schneer was not enthusiastic, in part due to worries about the film&#x27;s period setting. Ray remembered &quot;Charles would look at me and bring up the same logical arguments, namely that there was no variety in it, and that space exploration had advanced to such a degree that it would seem difficult to make the story seem believable to modern audiences&quot;. Kneale thought it was an excellent idea. Being also a fan of the novel, he came up with a brilliant concept: a prologue and epilogue structure that would frame the story. By using this argument, Nigel Kneale and Ray Harryhausen managed to persuade Schneer to make it as it solved the problem of Schneer&#x27;s misgivings by bringing the storyline up to date, while still preserving the essence of Wells&#x27; story.

Schneer said Kneale &quot;is a very dour, straightforward, serious classicist. He was recognized in England as being the contemporary science-fiction 
screenwriter. I hired him because we needed his technical expertise. Then, we superimposed on that what we thought audiences 
would appreciate&quot;.

Another writer was brought on to rework Kneale&#x27;s script. According to Kneale: &quot;They wanted to jazz it up, make it funnier than I had imagined&quot;. He says this inspired the casting of Lionel Jeffries.

Kneale said in the book, Judd&#x27;s character &quot;was a blundering creature and it seemed important to keep that&quot;. The writer says he knew that a country would get to the Moon relatively soon and discover there were no Selenites. This is why he added to the script that the Selenites were wiped out by a cold virus carried to the Moon by the professor, an idea Kneale says he took directly from &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;.

===Director===
This was the third collaboration between producer Charles Schneer and director Nathan Juran. Schneer said Juran &quot;was an excellent man for what he did, but he wasn&#x27;t an actor&#x27;s director. Many of our actors were used to more help from a director than he gave them. They felt a little adrift when they were expected to get on with their work without any great directorial assist. Jerry wasn&#x27;t very patient with actors. He couldn&#x27;t tolerate actors who wanted to know what their character&#x27;s motivation was. He wanted to get on with the job he was hired to do&quot;.

===Casting===
Schneer cast Judd from his performance in &quot;The Day the Earth Caught Fire&quot; (1961). Edward Judd was under contract to Columbia Pictures. &quot;I had never done anything like that at the time, so I thought it would be fun&quot;, Judd said. &quot;Since Lionel was already a great chum of mine, I knew we would have laughs on the set&quot;.

Martha Hyer&#x27;s character was not in the original drafts of the scripts but was introduced later.

Some of the Selenite characters were played by children.

===Designs===
Ray Harryhausen used NASA blueprints as inspiration for the UN&#x27;s lunar lander when he was designing the film&#x27;s sets.

Sculptor Bryan Kneale constructed the Selenites from Harryhausen&#x27;s designs.

===Spacesuits used===

The spacesuit type worn by the film&#x27;s UN Astronauts is actually the Windak high-altitude pressure suit, developed for the Royal Air Force. Each was fitted with a 1960s-type aqualung cylinder worn as a backpack. These pressure suits would also be used in two &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories: William Hartnell&#x27;s final story &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot; (1966) and the Patrick Troughton-era &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot; (1968). They also appear in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy as the costumes for Bossk and Bo Shek. 

==Shooting==
Filming began on 1 October 1963.

Schneer convinced Harryhausen the film&#x27;s commercial prospects would be improved if it was shot in Panavision. &quot;Ray was terrified of Panavision&quot;, said the producer. &quot;All I had to do was suggest something different to him, and he would get nervous&quot;.

&quot;After you got past the first couple of reels, it was a funny film&quot;, said Juran. &quot;Lionel was a swell actor. I liked him very much. His performance added immeasurably to the picture&#x27;s entertainment value. He played it tongue-in-cheek but being such a good comic actor he controlled himself and never went too far. He made a great team with Edward Judd. Their personalities, one against the other, were just perfect&quot;.

&quot;It was fun to do, but it was bloody hard work,&quot; said Judd. &quot;Lionel called it &#x27;acting with chalk marks&#x27; because we were pointing at things that weren&#x27;t there and dealing with blue backing and traveling mattes&quot;.

Harryhausen would explain to the actors what the creatures would eventually look like just before they shot the scenes involving them. He was effusive about Jeffries saying, &quot;Lionel is one of those rare breed of actors who is not only accomplished in his field but also enjoys what he is doing and has the added bonus of having an imagination. I would show him drawings of the effects scenes and he would know instantly what was required and how it would look, even offering suggestions&quot;.

&quot;Lionel and I didn&#x27;t like Jerry&#x27;s working methods too much,&quot; said Judd. &quot;He was more of a technician than an actor&#x27;s director. We always thought of him as an art director, which of course he had been&quot;.

In the scene where Kate is X-rayed by the Selenites, the stop-motion skeleton seen was one that previously appeared in the 1963 movie Jason and the Argonauts.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Among contemporary reviews, &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Ray Harryhausen and his special effects men have another high old time in this piece of science-fiction hokum filmed in Dynamation&quot;, adding that &quot;Wells&#x27; novel and has been neatly updated&quot;, and concluding that &quot;The three principals play second fiddle to the special effects and art work, which are impressive in color, construction and animation&quot;.

However, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Only the most indulgent youngsters should derive much stimulation - let alone fun - from the tedious, heavyhanded science-fiction vehicle that arrived yesterday from England&quot;.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;good of its type&quot;.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; called it &quot;An enjoyable science fiction film&quot;. and &quot;Blu-ray.com&quot; highly recommended the film as &quot;a fun and exciting viewing experience&quot;.

===Box-office===
&quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; called the film a &quot;money maker&quot; at the British box office for 1964.

Nonetheless the film was a box-office disappointment. Harryhausen felt this was due to the inclusion of too much comedy.

Schneer said he preferred the film to &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; because &quot;it was set in the Victorian era, whereas &quot;Jason&quot; took place in a much further removed period of history. Also, I thought the humor in it was delicious, whereas there wasn&#x27;t much humor in &quot;Jason&quot;.&quot; The producer says Harryhausen felt &quot;fantasy film fans are dead serious about these pictures and have no sense of humor. So, who am I to quarrel with him?&quot;

Kneale says the final film was &quot;...all right. It could have been better if it had been a bit less farcical; that would have been more imaginative.&quot;

==Legacy==
Schneer says that when the real Moon landing happened, NASA &quot;had no footage showing the space capsule separating from the &#x27;mother ship&#x27; and landing on the Moon&#x27;s surface. All they had were shots of Neil Armstrong walking around&quot;. NASA went to Columbia Pictures and used the opening sequence of &quot;First Men in the Moon&quot; for illustration purposes during the 1969 moon landing. &quot;They used those portions of it which were applicable to their needs,&quot; said the producer. This was a returned favor as five years before the real-life event, NASA had given Ray Harryhausen access to its blueprints for reference.

Following the film, Harryhausen and Schneer did not work together for five years.

<doc id="878672" wikidata="Q5325729" url="?curid=878672" title="Earl Battey">
<text>Earl Jesse Battey, Jr. (January 5, 1935 – November 15, 2003) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher from 1955 to 1967, most prominently for the Minnesota Twins where he was a five-time All-Star player and was an integral member of the American League pennant-winning team.

Battey began his career with the Chicago White Sox but blossomed during his tenure with the Twins when he was recognized as one of the top catchers in the American League by winning three consecutive Gold Glove Awards between and . He was posthumously inducted into the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame in 2004.
==Major League career==

===White Sox===

Born in Los Angeles, Battey attended Jordan High School in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles. He was signed as an amateur free agent by the Chicago White Sox prior to the 1953 season. Battey was assigned to the Colorado Springs Sky Sox in the Single-A Western League where he began his baseball career by hitting only a .158 batting average in 26 games. The White Sox demoted him to the Waterloo White Hawks in the B-level Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League and Battey responded with a .292 average and 11 home runs in 129 games. In , Battey was promoted to the Triple-A Charleston Senators in the American Association where, he hit for a .269 batting average along with 8 home runs and 71 runs batted in. His performance earned him a promotion to the major leagues where he made his debut with the White Sox on September 10, 1955 at the age of 20.

Battey returned to the minor leagues in 1956, playing in 36 games for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Despite hitting only .178, he played well defensively. The White Sox called him back to the major leagues to back up starting catcher Sherm Lollar, for the remainder of the season although, he spent the time on the bench and played in only four games. Battey continued to learn from the perennial All-Star Lollar during the 1957 season but struggled offensively. He was sent back to the minor leagues in August where he hit 9 home runs and 20 runs batted in for the Triple-A Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League. The White Sox recalled Battey to the major leagues in September – this time to stay.

Battey hit .226 along with 8 home runs in 1958, as the White Sox battled back from being in last place on June 14 to finish the season in second place behind the New York Yankees. In 1959 he was overtaken by rookie Johnny Romano as the second string catcher, ending the year hitting .219 in 26 games. Although the White Sox won the American League pennant, Battey did not appear in the post-season as the White Sox lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1959 World Series.

Realizing they had a logjam at catcher with the veteran, and still productive, Lollar, the impressive rookie Romano, and the still-valuable-as-a-defensive-backup Battey, White Sox owner and general manager Bill Veeck solved his problem in two deals that showed immediate dividends for the White Sox, but were long-term disasters. On December 6, 1959, Veeck traded Romano, rookie first baseman Norm Cash, and utility man Bubba Phillips to the Cleveland Indians for outfielder Minnie Miñoso, catcher Dick Brown, pitcher Don Ferrarese, and minor league pitcher Jake Striker. Then on April 4, 1960, Veeck shipped Battey, first baseman Don Mincher, and $150,000 to the Washington Senators for veteran first baseman Roy Sievers. Although both Sievers and Miñoso combined for three 20-home run seasons, two All-Star appearances, one Gold Glove award in 1960 and 1961 with the White Sox, the rest of the players the team received in trade were largely of the replacement level. Conversely the young players that the White Sox traded to get these veterans, namely Battey, Mincher, Romano, and Cash, all sparkled, and account for 17 20-home run seasons, four 30-home run seasons, one 40-home run season, 12 all-star team selections, three Gold Gloves (all by Battey), and garnered Most Valuable Player support in numerous seasons. Meanwhile, the catcher that the White Sox chose to keep, Lollar, went into decline after 1959, was relegated to a backup role in 1962, and retired after the 1963 season, leaving the White Sox with an underwhelming starting catcher, including a two-year return of an aging Romano in 1965, before regaining some form of stability behind the plate in 1969 with Ed Herrmann (who led the American League in passed balls in four of his six full seasons with the Sox).

===Senators/Twins===
Battey became the starting catcher for the Senators and immediately showed his defensive abilities, leading the American League in assists and putouts for four consecutive years ( to ). For the first time in the majors Battey shined offensively, hitting as he had in the minor leagues. In 1960 Battey played in a then-career-high 137 games and hit .270, with 15 home runs and 60 RBIs. He also earned his first Gold Glove Award and placed eighth in voting for the 1960 American League Most Valuable Player Award. In October, Battey was named to the United Press International&#x27;s American League All-Star team.

Prior to the 1961 season, the Senators relocated to the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area and were renamed the Minnesota Twins. Battey teamed with future Baseball Hall of Fame member Harmon Killebrew, future MVP Zoilo Versalles, and All-Stars Bob Allison, Camilo Pascual, and Jim Kaat to form the nucleus of what would become a pennant-winning team. Building on his breakout 1960 season, Battey ended 1961 with a .302 batting average, sixth best in the American League, and won his second Gold Glove Award.
Battey was recognized as one of the top catchers in the major leagues when he was selected to be the starting catcher for the American League in the 1962 All-Star Games. He was the Twins catcher on August 26, 1962, when pitcher Jack Kralick threw a no-hitter. Battey appeared in a career-high 148 games and ended the season with a .280 batting average, highest among major league catchers. He also set a record for major league catchers by picking off 15 base runners as he won his third consecutive Gold Glove Award. The Twins, long an American League doormat while in Washington, finished a surprising second in the standings with 91 wins, 5 games behind the World Series-winning New York Yankees.

Battey had his finest season at the plate in 1963, hitting .285 while setting career highs in home runs (26), RBIs (84), and slugging percentage (.476). He was voted to his second straight All-Star team and collected his only all-star game hit, a third-inning single that scored Boston Red Sox third baseman Frank Malzone from second base to tie the game at 3-3). He placed seventh in American League Most Valuable Player Award balloting (behind Killebrew and winner and fellow catcher Elston Howard). The Twins again finished with 91 wins, which this time was only good enough for third place, 15½ games behind the World Series runner-up Yankees. Both Battey and the Twins took a step backward in 1964; the team struggled to a 79-win, sixth-place finish in the American League, with Battey hitting .272 with 12 home runs and 51 RBIs in 131 games.

Battey rebounded in 1965 and was hitting nearly .300 at mid-season, when he received the most All-Star votes among American League players. The 1965 All-Star Game was played in his home ball park, Metropolitan Stadium. He was one of six Twins to appear in the 1965 mid-season classic (with Versalles, Killebrew, Jimmie Hall, Mudcat Grant, and Tony Oliva). Battey was an integral member of the Twins team that went on to clinch the American League pennant, hitting for a .297 batting average and placing tenth in voting for the American League Most Valuable Player Award (with teammate Versalles winning and six Twins finishing in the top 15). He started every game in the 1965 World Series but only hit for a .120 average, with 2 RBIs and one extra base hit, as the Twins lost the series to the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games.

In 1966, Battey hit .255 with 4 home runs and 31 RBIs while playing in 115 games, his lowest totals since his backup days in Chicago. He was nevertheless selected for his fourth and final All-Star team, and replaced the starting catcher, Tiger Bill Freehan, in the bottom of the game&#x27;s sixth inning.

The 1967 season was Battey&#x27;s last, as he battled a thyroid condition that caused him to gain weight. He appeared in only 48 games and hit for just a .165 average. The Twins&#x27; three catchers that season - Battey, Jerry Zimmerman, and Russ Nixon - combined to hit just .176, and the Twins went 2-5 in late September and lost the pennant to the Red Sox in the last game of the season.

==Career statistics==
In a 13-year major league career, Battey played in 1,141 games, accumulating 969 hits in 3,586 at bats for a .270 career batting average along with 104 home runs and 449 RBIs. He led the American League four times in assists and putouts, three times in baserunners caught stealing and twice in caught stealing percentage, with a career fielding percentage of .990. A four-time All-Star, Battey won three Gold Glove Awards. Over his career, he threw out 43.44% of the base runners who tried to steal a base on him, 15th on the all-time list. In , the reigning American League stolen base champion, Luis Aparicio, rated Battey as the toughest catcher on which to attempt a stolen base.

Richard Kendall of the Society for American Baseball Research devised a study that ranked Battey as the seventh most dominating fielding catcher in major league history. Battey played more games at catcher than any other player in Twins history (831). He was named to the Twins&#x27; 40th anniversary team in 2000. In 1961, Battey became one of the first Major League players to wear an earflap on his batting helmet, after twice suffering broken cheekbones when hit by pitches.

==Post-retirement==
After his playing career, Battey lived in Co-op City in the Bronx and spent 12 years working in New York City as a recreation specialist with disturbed young boys. Fulfilling a promise he had made to his mother, Battey enrolled at Bethune-Cookman University in 1980. Taking 34 credits a semester, he finished his undergraduate degree in Education in 2½ years, while coaching the men&#x27;s basketball team, and was accorded the distinction of Summa Cum Laude honors. After graduating from Bethune-Cookman, he became a high school teacher and baseball coach in Ocala, Florida.

Battey was also part of a charity program sponsored by Consolidated Edison whereby children were given free bleacher tickets to New York Yankee games. He talked baseball and was a &quot;big brother&quot; to all the kids who were lucky enough to benefit from the program. 

Battey died of cancer at the age of 68 in Ocala, Florida. In , he was posthumously elected to the Twins Hall of Fame. In , the Twins celebrated their 50th season in Minnesota and Battey was voted one of the 50 Greatest Twins Players.

Earl&#x27;s grandson Evan Battey played basketball for the University of Colorado, and as of 2024 was a member of Rilski Sportist in Bulgaria&#x27;s National Basketball League (NBL).

<doc id="878677" wikidata="Q7715325" url="?curid=878677" title="The Baffler">
<text>The Baffler is an American magazine of cultural, political, and business analysis. Established in 1988 by editors Thomas Frank and Keith White, it was headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, until 2010, when it moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 2016, it moved its headquarters to New York City. The first incarnation of &quot;The Baffler&quot; had up to 12,000 subscribers.

As of 2016, the magazine and its collections of essays were distributed through bookstores in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

==History==
The magazine was first published by Greg Lane. Its motto was &quot;the journal that blunts the cutting edge.&quot; 
It became known for critiquing &quot;business culture and the culture business&quot; and for having exposed the grunge speak hoax perpetrated on &quot;The New York Times&quot;. 
One famous and much-republished article, &quot;The Problem with Music&quot; by Steve Albini, exposed the inner workings of the music business during the indie rock heyday.

The magazine is credited with having helped launch the careers of several writers, including founding editor Thomas Frank, Ana Marie Cox, and Rick Perlstein.

===Issues===
The magazine published sporadically, first once a year then slightly more often, but that slowed down after the Chicago office of &quot;The Baffler&quot; was destroyed in a fire on April 25, 2001. Publishing became more regular and frequent after its relaunch and move to Cambridge in 2011. Timeline of publication:
&quot;The Baffler&quot; is sold through many different distribution channels, both as a book and as a magazine; in addition to the publication&#x27;s ISSN, all but the earliest issues have an individual ISBN.

===Relaunch and move===
In 2009, founding editor Thomas Frank decided to revive the magazine. It was relaunched with Volume 2, Issue 1 (#18) in 2010, with a new publisher, editors, and design.

In 2011, &quot;The Baffler&quot; moved its headquarters to Cambridge, and John Summers took over as editor. The magazine signed a publishing contract with the MIT Press, and after another redesign, began publishing three times a year. 
In 2014, it ended that contract and brought publishing operations in house. In 2016, the magazine changed to a quarterly schedule and moved its headquarters to New York City. Summers left in 2016 and Chris Lehmann took over the editorship of the journal. In 2019, Lehmann departed for &quot;The New Republic,&quot; and Jonathon Sturgeon became editor in chief.

&quot;The Baffler&quot; has also organized literary events and debates with its contributing editors. In 2014, Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal, and David Graeber, an anarchistic anthropologist and &quot;The Baffler&quot;&#x27;s contributing editor, publicly debated the future of technology.

In 2017, &quot;The Baffler&quot; and &quot;CTXT&quot;, a Spanish independent online publication, began a collaborative editorial agreement.

==Collections and books==
In addition to the magazine, &quot;The Baffler&quot; has published a few collections of its essays and other writings.

* &quot;Commodify Your Dissent: Salvos from The Baffler&quot;. Edited by Thomas Frank and Matt Weiland. Norton, 1997. 
* &quot;Boob Jubilee: The Cultural Politics of the New Economy (Salvos from The Baffler)&quot;. Edited by Thomas Frank and David Mulcahey. Norton, 2003. 
* &quot;Cotton Tenants: Three Families&quot;. Edited by John Summers. Melville House, 2012. Excerpts from a lost manuscript on Alabama tenant farmers by the writer James Agee. 
* &quot;No Future For You: Salvos from The Baffler&quot;. Edited by John Summers, Chris Lehmann and Thomas Frank. MIT Press, 2014. 

==Podcasts==
&quot;The Baffler&quot; has previously hosted the podcasts &quot;Whale Vomit&quot;, by Amber A&#x27;Lee Frost and Sam Kriss; &quot;News from Nowhere&quot;, by Corey Pein; and &quot;The Nostalgia Trap&quot;, by David Parsons.

<text>Carlos Austin Boozer Jr. (born November 20, 1981) is an American former professional basketball player. The two-time NBA All-Star played for the Cleveland Cavaliers, Utah Jazz, Chicago Bulls, and Los Angeles Lakers, and then spent his last season playing overseas with the Guangdong Southern Tigers. As a member of Team USA, Boozer won an Olympic bronze medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

==Early life==
Although born at a military base in Aschaffenburg, West Germany, Boozer grew up in Juneau, Alaska. He was one of five children of Carlos and Renee, both of whom worked two jobs as he grew up.

==High school and college career==
Boozer was a two-time member of the &quot;PARADE&quot; All-American high school basketball team, leading the Juneau-Douglas Crimson Bears to back-to-back state titles. He was recruited by many top-tier collegiate basketball programs, including St. John&#x27;s and UCLA, but Boozer elected to play for coach Mike Krzyzewski at Duke University, helping the team win the 2001 NCAA championship.

In 2001–02, Boozer, Jason Williams, and Mike Dunleavy Jr. each scored at least 600 points for the season, a feat only matched at Duke by Jon Scheyer, Kyle Singler and Nolan Smith in the 2009–10 season.

In April 2002, Boozer declared for the NBA draft, foregoing his final year of college eligibility.

On September 16, 2020, Boozer graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences of Duke University.

==Professional career==

===Cleveland Cavaliers (2002–2004)===
Boozer was selected with the 35th overall pick in the 2002 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Boozer averaged 10.0 points and 7.5 rebounds per game in his rookie campaign, and followed it up with 15.5 points and 11.4 rebounds per game his second year.

====Free agency controversy====

After the 2003–04 season, the Cavaliers had the option of allowing him to become a restricted free agent, or keeping him under contract for one more year at a $695,000 salary. The Cavaliers claimed to have reached an understanding with Boozer and his agent on a deal for approximately $39 million over six years, which he would have signed if they let him out of his current deal.

Cleveland then proceeded to release him from his contract making him a restricted free agent. During this period, the Utah Jazz offered Boozer a six-year, $70 million contract that Cleveland chose not to match due to salary cap considerations. On July 30, 2004, Boozer officially signed with the Jazz.

Then Cavaliers owner Gordon Gund said, &quot;In the final analysis, I decided to trust Carlos and show him the respect he asked for. He did not show that trust and respect in return.&quot; However, Boozer denied that he made any commitment to the Cavaliers: &quot;There was no commitment. It&#x27;s unfortunate how the turn of events went through the media&quot;, Boozer said shortly after signing the deal with Utah. &quot;I&#x27;m not a guy that gives my word and takes it away. I think I&#x27;ve made that clear.&quot; Boozer later claimed that he originally intended to re-sign with the Cavaliers, but he and his team subsequently found out that his negotiations with the Cavaliers may lead to a tampering violation investigation from the NBA and severe penalty for the Cavaliers if he signed, causing him to come to the conclusion he had to move on, against his original intentions.

===Utah Jazz (2004–2010)===

In his first season with the Jazz in 2004–05, Boozer averaged 17 points and 9 rebounds per game. However, he suffered an injury, missing the later part of the season, which contributed to the Jazz missing the playoffs for only the second time in 22 years, and he was publicly criticized for a lack of effort by team owner Larry Miller.

As the 2005–06 season began, Boozer was still recovering from injury, and then aggravated a hamstring, causing him to miss the first half of that season as well. He returned to action in late February, easing into action by coming off the bench for the Jazz. In the middle of March, he was placed back into the starting lineup. From that point, he finished the season in impressive fashion, averaging over 20 points and almost 10 rebounds per game and firmly establishing himself as the Jazz&#x27;s starting power forward once again.

Boozer got off to a strong start in the 2006–07 season, winning the Western Conference Player of the Week Award and helping the Jazz to win eleven of their first twelve games. Boozer was named part of the NBA All-Star roster as a reserve, but could not participate because of a hairline fracture in his left fibula.

In an April 23, 2007 game against the Houston Rockets (game two of the first round of the 2007 playoffs), Boozer scored 41 points, tying the career high he had set a month earlier on March 26 (vs. the Washington Wizards). He also led the Jazz past the Rockets in game 7 of the first round in the NBA Playoffs, scoring 35 points, grabbing 14 rebounds and two clutch free throws to secure the victory in Boozer&#x27;s first playoff series.

The Jazz would go on to win their second round series against the upstart Golden State Warriors, 4 games to 1, and advance to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 1998. Even though they lost 4 games to 1 to the more experienced San Antonio Spurs, Boozer proved valuable and durable. He ended the season averaging 20.9 points and 11.7 rebounds per game, and playing in 74 of 82 games. He was even better in the playoffs, increasing his output to 23.5 points and 12.2 rebounds per game, and appearing in all 17 Jazz playoff games.

In November 2007, Boozer was named Western Conference Player of the Month. By mid-December, he was among the league&#x27;s top five performers in scoring, rebounding and field goal percentage. Although he later slipped in all of these categories, he continued to produce solid numbers. Boozer was again chosen as a backup in the All-Star Game, finishing with 14 points and 10 rebounds in just 19 minutes of play. He registered his first career triple-double against the Seattle SuperSonics on February 13, 2008, with 22 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists.

In the 2008 playoffs, the Jazz faced the Houston Rockets in the first round for the second year in a row. Determined to not allow him to beat them, the Rockets geared their defense more to stopping Boozer and his production was somewhat limited (16.0 points and 11.7 rebounds per game), but the Jazz defeated the Rockets, 4–2. In the second round of the 2008 playoffs, the Jazz lost to the top seeded Los Angeles Lakers in six games.

During the 2008–09 season, Boozer&#x27;s ability to stay healthy was questioned by fans and media alike, as he missed 44 games following arthroscopic left knee surgery. He missed time from late November 2008 to late February 2009. When he played, his numbers were 16.2 points, 10.4 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game, in 37 games (all starts). With his possible pending free agency at the end of the season looming, it seemed likely Boozer would leave. However, when the deadline for choosing free agency or opting into the remaining year came, he surprised many by opting in for the 2009–10 season with the Jazz. The Jazz management stated publicly they were happy to have him return and play for them, and Boozer did the same.

In 2009–10, Boozer played well, averaging 19.5 points and 11.2 rebounds per game, and shot 56.2% from the field, a career high. He played in 78 of 82 games and avoided injury, which boded well heading into the 2010 summer.

===Chicago Bulls (2010–2014)===

On July 8, 2010, Boozer was acquired by the Chicago Bulls in a sign-and-trade deal with the Jazz, signing a 5-year, $75 million contract.

Despite missing 23 games due to injury in 2010–11, Boozer still managed to average 17.5 points and 9.6 rebounds per game while also helping the Bulls get the first seed in the Eastern Conference. His production saw a decline the following year, as he averaged just 15 points and 8.5 rebounds per game (while playing in all 66 games).

Boozer rebounded with a healthy, solid 2012–13 season, averaging 16.2 points and 9.8 rebounds per game while playing in 79 games. On January 16, 2013, Boozer scored a season-high 36 points and grabbed 12 rebounds during a 107–105 overtime victory against the Toronto Raptors.

On July 15, 2014
, Boozer was released by the Bulls via the amnesty clause.

===Los Angeles Lakers (2014–2015)===
On July 17, 2014, Boozer was claimed off amnesty waivers by the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers paid $3.25 million of his $16.8 million salary, while the Bulls paid the remaining $13.55 million. On February 4, 2015, he scored a season-high 28 points in a loss to the Milwaukee Bucks.

Boozer&#x27;s final NBA game was on April 15, 2015, a 122–99 loss to the Sacramento Kings where he recorded 10 points and six rebounds.

===Guangdong Southern Tigers (2016–2017)===
On July 30, 2016, Boozer signed with the Guangdong Southern Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association. On December 18, 2017, Boozer announced his retirement.

==BIG3 career==
On January 25, 2018, Boozer signed with the BIG3 league as a co-captain of the Ghost Ballers. He later was waived and was later picked up by 2018 Big3 champions Power.

==National team career==
Boozer was selected as a member of the U.S. Olympic basketball team, which won a bronze medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics. He was also part of the U.S. national team from 2006 to 2008, but did not compete in the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship due to his wife&#x27;s pregnancy. Boozer participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics as the U.S. national team went unbeaten en route to the gold medal, defeating the 2006 World Champion Spain for their first gold medal since the 2000 Summer Olympics.

==Personal life==
Boozer was married twice to his first wife, Cindy Nichole Blackwell, from 2003 to 2015. In 2017 he married Aneshka Dawn Smith until their divorce in 2021. He dated girlfriend Natalie Rodriguez during 2021 to 2024. Boozer and CeCe have three children together: Carmani (who had a bone marrow transplant in 2007 to treat sickle-cell disease), and fraternal twins, Cameron and Cayden. Cameron Boozer is the number three overall recruit in the 2025 recruiting class. He and his brother Cayden are both committed to play for Duke University. 

After leaving Duke his junior year to play in the NBA, Carlos Boozer was three classes shy of finishing his degree. In 2020, he officially graduated from 
Duke, and attended his graduation ceremony (two years later due to Covid) on May 8, 2022 alongside his parents, coach, and girlfriend.

<doc id="878700" wikidata="Q468017" url="?curid=878700" title="Betty Driver">
<text>Elizabeth Mary Driver (20 May 1920 – 15 October 2011) was a British actress and singer, best known for her role as Betty Williams in the long-running ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, a role she played for 42 years from 1969 to 2011, appearing in 2,732 episodes. She had previously appeared as Mrs Edgley in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; spin-off &quot;Pardon the Expression&quot; (1965–1966) opposite Arthur Lowe. In her early career she was a singer, appearing in musical films such as &quot;Boots! Boots!&quot; (1934), opposite George Formby, and in &quot;Penny Paradise&quot; (1938), directed by Carol Reed. She was made an MBE in the 2000 New Year Honours.

==Early life==
Betty Driver was born in 1920 at the Prebend Nursing Home, Leicester, the elder of two daughters of Frederick and Nellie Driver. She weighed 5.5 kg (12 lb). Her father had fought in the trenches during the First World War and later became a policeman. However, Driver described her mother as &quot;the driving force&quot; in her life. She commented: &quot;the only way I can explain her behaviour is that she wanted to live out her ambitions through me.&quot;

The family moved to West Didsbury, Manchester, shortly after the birth. They were recorded as living there in the June 1921 Census, where they lived in a semi-detached house with other police families as neighbours. Driver went to school at Wilbraham Road, and was later joined there by her younger sister Freda, who shared a class with a young Patricia Manfield, later known as Pat Phoenix, the actress who went on to play the role of Elsie Tanner in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, alongside Driver.

Driver described her parents as absent of affection, stating that they never celebrated birthdays and rarely gave her toys and gifts. Though she maintained her father never beat them, their mother &quot;more often lashed out&quot;. Driver&#x27;s mother had never wanted children, and developed an interest in her daughter only when she discovered she had a talent for singing. When she was aged seven, the Drivers went to see a production called the &quot;Quaintesques&quot;, a group of men dressed as women, when the star, Billy Manders, asked the audience to join in with a chorus. Driver&#x27;s singing stood out so much that Manders asked her to come forward and sing with him. From then on, Driver&#x27;s mother began taking her to talent contests in Manchester, and she won them all. She commented, &quot;I imitated hits by Gracie Fields such as &#x27;Sing As We Go&#x27;, and &#x27;The Biggest Aspidistra in the World&#x27;, corny little numbers that I detested but mother adored ... I think she was a frustrated performer herself and she was determined that my sister Freda and I were going to fulfil all her dreams.&quot;

==Career==
At the age of eight, Driver began performing professionally, forced by her mother to appear with Terence Byron Repertory Theatre Company. She was singing for the BBC by the age of 10, and began touring across the UK in her first revue at the age of 12. While performing in London at the age of 14, Driver was spotted by the agent Bert Aza, who was in partnership with his brother Archie Pitt, Gracie Fields&#x27; husband. Despite her young age, he booked her for the lead in a revival of &quot;Mr Tower of London&quot; (alongside comedian Norman Evans) which ran for about two years. The same show had brought Gracie Fields to prominence 19 years earlier. She was also approached by George Formby after he and his wife Beryl Formby saw her perform in Manchester. The Formbys wanted Driver to appear in their new film &quot;Boots! Boots!&quot; (1934); however, according to Driver, Beryl Formby saw her rehearsing and decided that she did not want to be outperformed by Driver, and sent her away. The producers felt so bad about the way Driver had been treated that they refused to take her name off the film credits, even though it was long thought she did not appear in the theatrical release. It is now known that she did perform in the film, and her scene was included in the original release. In 1938, an edited version of the film was released which did not include her scene. A restored version of the film (including Driver&#x27;s scene) has been released on DVD, which finally confirms her involvement in the film.

At 16, she was in a West End show called &quot;Home and Beauty&quot;. Film director Basil Dean, after seeing her in &quot;Jimmy Hunter&#x27;s Brighton Follies&quot;, cast her in the film &quot;Penny Paradise&quot; (1938), filmed at ATP studios in Ealing. After a few months of variety and radio work, she returned to the studio to make her second film, &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Famous&quot;. They had just completed the film when the Second World War was announced and the studios were closed. Nineteen at the time, Driver resumed touring the country in variety shows. It was at this time that her act and image altered. Against her mother&#x27;s wishes, Driver and her sister modernised her performance and Driver became a ballad singer. Shortly after, during a six-month run in a revue called &quot;Twice in a Blue Moon&quot;, Driver and her sister parted company with their mother following a cardiac asthma attack which restricted her mobility.

Driver continued in variety, opening in the Coventry Hippodrome and sharing the bill with the Andrews family - father Ted, mother Barbara and Julie. She made regular trips to Bristol to sing on a radio show called &quot;Ack Ack Beer Beer&quot; and made her final film in 1941, &quot;Facing the Music&quot;.

In the 1940s, she became a singer with British dance bands. During the Second World War, Driver travelled with ENSA (Entertainments National Service Association), entertaining the troops. She also appeared for seven years on the radio show &quot;Henry Hall&#x27;s Guest Night&quot; and on her own show, &quot;A Date with Betty&quot;, which was broadcast live from the People&#x27;s Palace in London&#x27;s East End on 14 July 1949. The show&#x27;s format was based around Driver singing, doing sketches and introducing guests. All her words were scripted by Bob Monkhouse, then barely out of his teens. She recorded many popular tunes in the 1940s and became an established singer during this time. Aged 14, she made her first record &quot;Jubilee Baby&quot;, had another major success with &quot;The Sailor with the Navy Blue Eyes&quot;, and made several more hit records.

Driver travelled to Australia, where she performed her own show, and her career also took her to Cyprus, Malta and the Middle East. On her return to England she appeared in the Ealing Comedies, on stage in &quot;The Lovebirds&quot;, &quot;Pillar to Post&quot; and &quot;What A Racket&quot;, and on television with James Bolam in &quot;Love on the Dole&quot;.

In 1964, she auditioned for the role of Hilda Ogden in the television series &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (the role went instead to Jean Alexander, for the casting directors wanted an actress of slighter build). Driver was cast later, alongside Arthur Lowe, in the series &quot;Pardon the Expression&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. She described Lowe as &quot;such a difficult man to work with&quot;; after a much-publicised injury (she damaged her back after the script called for her to throw Lowe), she retired and began running a pub, the Cock Hotel in Whaley Bridge, Derbyshire, with her sister Freda.

In 1969, she was persuaded to come out of retirement to play police officer&#x27;s wife Betty Turpin in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, a role she would play for over 40 years. She was the longest-serving barmaid in the history of the Rover&#x27;s Return, and Betty&#x27;s Hot Pot (served at lunchtime in the Rovers) is an iconic dish, which has also been offered as a ready meal in UK supermarkets.

She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1976, when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

In 1994, she was the subject of BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;The Betty Driver Story&quot;. It was researched and scripted by Stephen Bourne who interviewed Betty and her sister Freda for the programme. Other interviewees included William Roache and Julie Goodyear. It was presented by Cilla Black.

Driver wrote a memoir on her years in radio and television, titled &quot;Betty&quot;, which was published in 2000. In an interview on the &quot;Parkinson&quot; show on 11 November 2006, Sir Ian McKellen revealed that Driver still drove herself into work at 7:30 each morning, despite her age. She was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2000 New Year Honours.

In August 2008, it was announced that Driver was one of several &quot;Coronation Street&quot; stars who faced large salary cuts. She was reportedly admitted to hospital with a chest infection in April 2010. In May 2010, she was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the British Soap Awards. There were also rumours that she was to retire; however, these were confirmed as false. Driver vowed in September 2010 never to retire, stating that: &quot;If I retire, I&#x27;ll be dead in six months with boredom&quot; and stated she still &quot;loved&quot; being part of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

On 23 January 2011, she was the castaway on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;.

==Personal life==
Driver said she fell in love several times in her teenage years, but each relationship was ruined by her mother, who wanted to keep her daughter single so as not to lose her free &quot;meal ticket&quot;. All the earnings Driver made before she turned 21 and was in charge of her own finances were squandered by her parents.

Driver stated that she was bitter about the path chosen for herself and her sister: &quot;I never wanted to be in the theatre and we really resented missing out on our childhood. Birthdays and Christmases were ignored and we never saw a pay-cheque. My pushy mother stuck to us like a wart and we were rarely out of her sight.&quot; Her mother died of lung cancer in 1956 after a long illness.

In December 1952, at Burnt Oak Registry Office in London, she married South African singer Wally Petersen, something Driver claimed she did out of &quot;defiance&quot; of her domineering mother, who she has said &quot;always felt Wally was only interested in my bank account&quot;. Petersen had appeared as part of a double-act on &quot;The Betty Driver Show&quot; in 1949, where they met and fell in love. Driver reluctantly agreed to marry him. She commented, &quot;Before the wedding, he had started to change the way I looked and sang. Up to this point, I&#x27;d always worn glamorous gowns. Wally said that look was too dated. He wanted me in short knee-length wide skirts, which I loathed. I went along with it because I loved him. Wally said my act was corny and old-fashioned. I became very cowed and did as he said, as I had with Mother. We toured with this new look and singing style, but audiences were lukewarm&quot;.

Driver became pregnant with Petersen&#x27;s child, but suffered a miscarriage. Doctors then discovered she had fibroids in her womb and insisted on a hysterectomy. The couple considered adoption, but were turned down. They lived in Finchley, Middlesex, where Vera Lynn was a neighbour and acquaintance of Driver&#x27;s. The couple later moved to St Albans in Hertfordshire.

Lew Levisohn, the husband of Driver&#x27;s good friend Winifred Atwell, once told Driver that he had punched Petersen after discovering an affair Petersen was having. Driver responded by saying &quot;Good&quot;. Driver and her husband moved to South Africa, but she returned a few months later, penniless, ending the marriage after seven years because of her husband&#x27;s various infidelities. She was in such a bad financial state that her sister had to send her money to allow her to return home to the United Kingdom.

Although the couple separated after six years, in October 1959, they were legally married until 1970. On 11 March 1970, Driver was awarded a decree nisi in an undefended lawsuit at Salford Divorce Court. She alleged desertion against her husband, and he was ordered by the judge to pay the costs of the lawsuit.

Following the breakup of her marriage, Driver lived with and cared for her sister Freda until Freda&#x27;s death in December 2008. The sisters lived in Mellor, Cheshire, before moving to Hale Barns in Greater Manchester. They latterly lived in nearby Bowdon.

Betty was godmother to James Roache, the youngest son of William Roache, who plays Ken Barlow in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. Roache&#x27;s son James had a role as Ken&#x27;s long-lost grandson, James Cunningham.

Despite Driver&#x27;s character being well known for her Lancashire hotpot, Driver was a vegetarian who seldom cooked, claiming she &quot;couldn&#x27;t cook a hotpot to save [her] life&quot;.

Driver died on 15 October 2011, aged 91.

<doc id="878701" wikidata="Q6206700" url="?curid=878701" title="Job Training Partnership Act of 1982">
<text>The Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 (JTPA, , , et seq.) was a United States federal law passed October 13, 1982, by Congress with regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Labor during the Ronald Reagan administration. The law was the successor to the previous federal job training legislation, the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA). It was repealed by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 during the administration of President Bill Clinton.

==Purpose==
The law was enacted to establish federal assistance programs to prepare youth and unskilled adults for entry into the labor force and to provide job training to economically disadvantaged and other individuals facing serious barriers to employment.

In order to carry out its purpose, the law authorized appropriations for fiscal year 1983 and for each succeeding fiscal year to carry out adult and youth programs, federally administered programs, summer youth employment and training programs, and employment and training assistance for dislocated workers.

==Provisions==
The purpose of this act is delineated into four main programs requiring federal funding.

*Authorizes States to establish procedures to identify substantial groups of eligible individuals who: (1) have been terminated or laid-off or have received notice of termination or layoff, are eligible for or have exhausted entitlement to unemployment compensation, and are unlikely to return to their previous industry or occupation; (2) have been terminated, or have received termination notice, due to permanent closure of a plant or facility; or (3) are long-term unemployed and have limited opportunities for employment or reemployment in the same or similar occupation in their area of residence (including older individuals with substantial barriers to employment by reason of age).
*Requires full consultation with a labor organization before the establishment any assistance program funded under this title which will provide services to a substantial number of members of such labor organization.
*Requires States to submit to the Secretary a plan for use of assistance under this title, including provisions for coordination of programs, low-income weatherization and other energy conservation programs, and social services.

==Analysis and criticisms of JTPA==

The stated goal of the JTPA is to target an economically disadvantaged population for job training assistance. The funding allocation for the JTPA is determined using a formula that is outlined in Title II. One-third of the funding is allotted based on the relative number of unemployed individuals living in areas of substantial unemployment, one-third is based on the relative excess number of the unemployed, and one-third is based on the relative number of economically disadvantaged individuals. A final stipulation of JTPA is that no state is allowed to receive below a minimum of one quarter of one percent of the total allotment. The money is further divided within the state based on the same criteria. (8) Inconsistencies are likely due to political variables that influenced the formula at the time these policies were developed. These variables include the legislative power of a state&#x27;s own representatives, a state&#x27;s ability to influence voters of legislators in other states and executive branch interests. The results of the study conducted by Svorny clearly demonstrate the importance of a state&#x27;s political power in influencing the votes of representatives (8).

Research has shown that there is an inconsistency between the number of economically disadvantaged in the United States and the number of individuals who actually receive resources and that the number varies across the United States. Concerns were initially raised in 1985, which caused the United States Department of Labor to commission a research study in July 1985 to explore the problems with the current formula. The study further showed that the main issues existed with regards to distributional equity, funding stability, data quality and formula simplicity. When investigating the distribution of funding, researchers found that certain regions, such as the upper Midwest, were over funded while other regions, such as the South, were underfunded (7).

Studies have tried to estimate the impact of the JTPA over the years. The National JPTA study was designed to measure the impact of incremental services provided by the JTPA over time. The study commissioned by the National Department of Labor investigated 21,000 people within 16 centers around the country in 1986. This research found modest positive impacts on adult men as well as adult women, but did cite inconsistencies with regards to out-of-school youths. Welfare mothers appeared to receive the largest impact as a result of the program. In addition, JTPA increased the proportion of dropouts who eventually received a high school credential but only a fraction of the target group members were high school dropouts (1). The National JTPA Study has been criticized for its research design and techniques, however. The biggest issue is that the process through which the sites were selected was not a random one. The sites do resemble the national system in some ways, such as labor market conditions and JTPA project performance. In addition, the samples of individuals in the study were similar regarding age, work experience and ethnicity to those served nationally by the JTPA. The main flaw in the research is that there is no large, central city and that sites serving small numbers of people were not included; the sites which were included did not provide as much on-the-job training than most of the national sites (4).

One criticism of the JTPA is summarized in a 1991 meeting of the Employment and Housing Subcommittee of the Committee on Government Operations focused on race and sex discrimination. Congressman Lantos cited evidence of differential patterns of service and job placement by race. The 1988 Chicago Urban League report stated that African Americans were shown to consistently receive lower job placements and wages. In addition, as stated in the 1991 Employment and Housing Subcommittee meeting, a 1988 Women&#x27;s Action Alliance report states that the JTPA is ineffective with regards to moving women out of poverty and that occupational segregation is prevalent as evidenced by the fact that the majority of women received jobs in clerical and sales and service rather than other areas (6).

Further criticisms of the JTPA stem from the argument that individuals can take advantage of the system due to the way that it is set up. Cragg claims that measures in the Job Training Partnership Act lead to problems of &quot;moral hazard&quot; which stem from the use of performance incentives in government programs. The Job Training Partnership Act offers a &quot;pay-for-performance system&quot; that focuses on a participant&#x27;s earnings and a reduction on welfare dependency. Cragg claims that participants may enroll who are capable of high post-training earnings without any actual training. Therefore, some participants are reaping the benefits of the incentives program without an actual need for the government resources (3).

In 1993, the Labor Department released a study that showed that in a study of low-income male out-of-school youth, males in the JTPA program actually had 10 percent lower earnings than males from a similar demographic who never participated in the program. Prior to the study&#x27;s release, the Labor Department&#x27;s inspector general stated that young trainees were twice as likely to rely on food stamps after JTPA involvement due to the fact that the training showed the individuals how to apply for food stamps (2).

==Repeal==
This act was repealed by title I, Sec. 199(b)(2) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. Some of the provisions were adjusted for the new act and some were dropped.

See a list of United States federal legislation, 1901-2001, for a chronological list of passed legislation from 1901-2001.

<doc id="878711" wikidata="Q465292" url="?curid=878711" title="Wendy Beckett">
<text>Wendy Mary Beckett (25 February 1930 – 26 December 2018), better known as Sister Wendy, was a British Catholic religious sister and art historian who became known internationally during the 1990s when she presented a series of BBC television documentaries on the history of art. Her programmes, such as &quot;Sister Wendy&#x27;s Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Sister Wendy&#x27;s Grand Tour,&quot; often drew a 25 percent share of the British viewing audience. In 1997 she made her debut on US public television, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; describing her as &quot;a sometime hermit who is fast on her way to becoming the most unlikely and famous art critic in the history of television.&quot; 

Beckett was formerly a member of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Beckett was born in Johannesburg in the Union of South Africa, but was later raised in Edinburgh, Scotland, where her father was studying medicine. In 1946, she entered the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, a Roman Catholic congregation of religious sisters dedicated to education. She was sent to England where she completed her novitiate and then studied at St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford, where she was awarded a congratulatory first class honours degree in English literature. J. R. R. Tolkien was president of her final examinations board and asked her to stay on at the university, an invitation which she declined. From childhood Beckett suffered from a weak heart and later had to give up teaching, after having epileptic seizures brought on by stress.

Outside her academic work, she lived in a convent which maintained the strict code of silence typical in convents prior to the changes following the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965). After attending the Notre Dame College of Education in Liverpool and earning a teaching diploma in 1954, she returned to South Africa to teach at Notre Dame Convent, a school for girls in Constantia, Cape Town, where she taught English and Latin. Later she moved to Johannesburg where she was appointed the superior of the local convent, while she also lectured at the University of the Witwatersrand.

===Return to England===
In 1970, health problems forced Beckett to abandon teaching and to return to England. She obtained papal permission to leave her congregation and to become a consecrated virgin and hermit. She began living in a caravan on the grounds of a Carmelite monastery at Quidenham, Norfolk, and her caravan was later replaced by a mobile home. Besides having received the Carmelite prioress and a nun who brought her provisions, she dedicated her life to solitude and prayer, but allotted two hours of work per day to earn her living.

==Interest in art==
Beckett spent many years translating Medieval Latin scripts before deciding, in 1980, to pursue art. Her first book, &quot;Contemporary Women Artists,&quot; was published in 1988.&quot; Sister Wendy Contemplates Saint Paul in Art&quot; was published in 2008 to celebrate the Year of Saint Paul. In May 2009, &quot;Encounters with God: In Quest of the Ancient Icons of Mary&quot; was published, which follows Beckett&#x27;s pilgrimage to see the earliest icons of Mary which had survived the Byzantine Iconoclasm. Beckett continued writing about her interest in icons in the second volume of her &quot;Sister Wendy Contemplates&quot; series, published in July 2011. This book, entitled &quot;The Iconic Jesus&quot;, takes the reader through scenes from the New Testament, accompanied by Beckett&#x27;s reflections. Her next book, published in 2011, &quot;The Christ Journey&quot;, consists of her commentaries on the artwork of Greg Tricker.

Beckett required medical treatment as an outpatient at a local hospital. The television chef Delia Smith, a Roman Catholic convert, volunteered to drive her there each week. Smith also drove her around the country to meet the artists when Beckett was writing her book about contemporary women artists. Through this the two became good friends.

Having overheard her commentary while attending an art exhibit, a film crew asked to videotape her. This brought her to the attention of a BBC producer and led, in 1992, to the debut &quot;Sister Wendy&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;.

Beckett was often effusively verbal in her descriptions of the human body in paintings, both male and female. In view of her religious state, this came as a surprise to some viewers. She insisted, however, on describing the depiction of the human anatomy in art when it was called for, stating that &quot;God did not make a mistake when He created the human body, so I am not making a mistake by describing it.&quot; &quot;None of the Sisters has ever raised an eyebrow at anything I&#x27;ve said or written because they&#x27;re not cramped by this false idea that sexuality is something wrong ... God looked at His creation and thought it was good, thought it was beautiful, we&#x27;re made in the image of God, and there&#x27;s nothing amiss in any part of the human body.&quot;

A musical, &quot;Postcards from God: The Sister Wendy Musical&quot;, written by Marcus Reeves and Beccy Smith was performed at the Jermyn Street Theatre in the West End in 2007 and Hackney Empire Studio Theatre in 2008.

In December 2012 Sister Wendy was the guest for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. Her favourite choice was &quot;Serenade&quot; (D 957 No. 4) by Franz Schubert, her chosen book was &quot;an enormous book of logical puzzles&quot;, and her luxury item was a &quot;refrigerated tabernacle&quot;.

In 1993, Sister Wendy recorded an abridged audio version of &quot;Revelations of Divine Love&quot; by Julian of Norwich. This recording, from the translation by M. L. Del Mastro and adapted for Sister Wendy by Donna K. Triggs, was finally released as a CD in 2021, entitled &quot;Revelations of Divine Love by Julian of Norwich read by Sister Wendy Beckett&quot;.

<doc id="878712" wikidata="Q1433118" url="?curid=878712" title="Chevrolet small-block engine (first- and second-generation)">
<text>The Chevrolet small-block engine is a series of gasoline-powered V8 automobile engines, produced by the Chevrolet division of General Motors in two overlapping generations between 1954 and 2003, using the same basic engine block. Referred to as a &quot;small-block&quot; for its size relative to the physically much larger Chevrolet big-block engines, the small-block family spanned from to in displacement. Engineer Ed Cole is credited with leading the design for this engine. The engine block and cylinder heads were cast at Saginaw Metal Casting Operations in Saginaw, Michigan.

The Generation II small-block engine, introduced in 1992 as the LT1 and produced through 1997, is largely an improved version of the Generation I, having many interchangeable parts and dimensions. Later generation GM engines, which began with the Generation III LS1 in 1997, have only the rod bearings, transmission-to-block bolt pattern and bore spacing in common with the Generation I Chevrolet and Generation II GM engines.

Production of the original small-block began in late 1954 for the 1955 model year, with a displacement of , growing over time to by 1970. Among the intermediate displacements were the , , and numerous versions. Introduced as a performance engine in 1967, the 350 went on to be employed in both high- and low-output variants across the entire Chevrolet product line.

Although all of Chevrolet&#x27;s siblings of the period (Buick, Cadillac, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Holden) designed their own V8s, it was the Chevrolet small-block that became the GM corporate standard. Over the years, every GM division in America, except Saturn and Geo, used it and its descendants in their vehicles. Chevrolet also produced a big-block V8 starting in 1958 and still in production in 2024.

Finally superseded by the GM Generation III LS in 1997 and discontinued in 2003, the engine is still made by a General Motors subsidiary in Springfield, Missouri, as a crate engine for replacement and hot rodding purposes. In all, over 100,000,000 small-blocks had been built in carbureted and fuel injected forms since 1955 as of November 29, 2011. The small-block family line was honored as one of the 10 Best Engines of the 20th Century by automotive magazine Ward&#x27;s AutoWorld.

In February 2008, a Wisconsin businessman reported that his 1991 Chevrolet C1500 pickup had logged over one million miles without any major repairs to its small-block V8 engine.

All first- and second-generation Chevrolet small-block V8 engines share the same firing order of 1-8-4-3-6-5-7-2.

==Overview==
The first generation of Chevrolet small-blocks began with the 1955 Chevrolet 265 cu in (4.3 L) V8 offered in the Corvette and Bel Air. The engine quickly gained popularity among stock car racers, and was nicknamed the &quot;Mighty Mouse,&quot; after the then-popular cartoon character, later abbreviated to &quot;Mouse&quot;. By 1957 the engine had grown to . Fitted with the optional Rochester mechanical fuel injection (FI) and a Duntov high-lift camshaft, it was one of the first production engines to produce per . The 283 was adopted by other Chevrolet models, replacing the 265 V8s.

A high-performance variant followed, turning out as much as (SAE gross power, not SAE net power or the current SAE certified power values) and raising horsepower per cubic inch to . From 1954 to 1974, the small-block engine was known as the &quot;Turbo-Fire&quot; or &quot;High Torque&quot; V8. However, it was the series that became the best-known Chevrolet small-block.

Installed in everything from station wagons and sports cars to commercial vehicles, boats, industrial equipment, and even (in highly modified form) in aircraft, the 350 is the most widely-used small-block engine of all time. Though not offered in GM vehicles since 2003, the 350 series is still in production at a GM subsidiary in Springfield, Missouri, under the company&#x27;s &quot;GM Genuine Parts&quot; brand, and is also manufactured as an industrial and marine engine by GM Powertrain under the &quot;Vortec&quot; name.

==3.750 in. bore family (1955–1957)==
===265===

The &quot;Turbo-Fire&quot; V8 was the second Chevrolet small-block; the first Chevrolet V8 was produced in 1917. The 265 cu in Turbo Fire engine was designed by Ed Cole&#x27;s group at Chevrolet to provide a more powerful engine for the 1955 Corvette than the model&#x27;s original &quot; Blue Flame&quot; in-line six, the 2-barrel debut version went from drawings to production in just 15 weeks.

Cole&#x27;s design borrowed a stud-mounted independent ball rocker arm valvetrain design patented by Pontiac engineer Clayton Leach scheduled to be used in the 1955 Pontiac V8. Internal GM rules at the time held that an automotive division developing a technological innovation had the right to introduce it and enjoy a two-year hiatus before any other GM division could share it. GM overruled itself and both divisions debuted the new design. This provided a considerable advantage to Chevrolet, as the Pontiac V8&#x27;s introduction had been held back: it had been tracking for introduction in the 1953 model year, and all 1953 and 1954 Pontiac cars&#x27; chassis and suspensions had been designed for the new engine. But GM&#x27;s Buick division had successfully lobbied corporate management to postpone Pontiac&#x27;s engine until late 1954 in favor of Buick&#x27;s release of its new overhead valve (OHV) V8 engine in 1953.

A pushrod (OHV) engine with hydraulic lifters, the small-block was available with an optional four-barrel Rochester carburetor, increasing engine output to , or in the Corvette. The short-stroke bore × stroke engine&#x27;s bore spacing would continue in use for decades.

Also available in the Bel Air sedan, the basic passenger car version produced with a two-barrel carburetor. Upgraded to a four-barrel Rochester, dual exhaust &quot;Power Pack&quot; version, the engine was conservatively rated at , and with the &quot;Super Power Pack,&quot; it was boosted up to the power level of the Corvette.

A shortcoming of the 1955 265 was its lack of any provision for oil filtration built into the block, instead relying on an add-on filter mounted on the thermostat housing, and that was an &quot;option only.&quot; In spite of its novel green sand foundry construction, the lack of adequate oil filtration leaves it typically only desirable to period collectors.

The 1956 Corvette introduced three versions of this engine— with a single 4-barrel carburetor, with twin 4-barrels, and with two four-barrel carburetors and a high-lift camshaft.

==3.875 in. bore family (1957–1973)==
===283===

The V8 engine was bored out to in 1957, giving it a displacement. The first 283 motors used the stock 265 blocks. However, the overbore to these blocks resulted in thin cylinder walls. Future 283 blocks were cast to accept the 3.875 bore. Five different versions between and were available, depending on whether a single carb, twin carbs, or fuel injection was used.

Horsepower was up a bit each year for 1958, 1959, 1960 (290hp), 1961 (315hp). The 1957 Rochester Ramjet mechanical fuel injection version produced an even one hp per one cu in (, an impressive feat at the time. This was the third U.S.-built production V8 to produce one horsepower per cubic inch, after the 1956 Chrysler 300B and Desoto adventure .

Besides being available in the Chevrolet line, it was optional in Checker Taxis beginning in 1965.
A version of it that was built by GM Canada was also available in Studebaker vehicles produced in Canada for 1965 and 1966.

===307===
A version was produced from 1968 through 1973. Engine bore and stroke was . All 307s had large journals to accept the 327&#x27;s crankshaft. Pistons used with the 307 share the same pin height as the 327 but retain the 283&#x27;s bore size.

==4.000 in bore family (1962–2002)==
Originally intended as the performance block, this engine family through the became an all-purpose engine that saw use in many applications from Corvettes to commercial vehicles. All engines in this family share the same block dimensions and sometimes even the same casting number; the latter meaning engines were of the same block, but with different strokes (e.g., the casting number 3970010 was used by all three engines: 302, 327, and 350). This engine family was updated in 1968 for the use of medium-sized journals. The first engine in this family was the small journal 327 in 1962 and the last being 2000s medium journal 350 in pickup trucks and commercial vehicles. The medium journal 350 was further developed into the Generation II LT1/4 350 in the early 1990s.
===302===

In 1966, General Motors designed a special engine for the production Z/28 Camaro in order for it to meet the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Trans-Am Series road racing rules limiting engine displacement to from 1967 to 1969. It was the product of placing the stroke crankshaft into a bore cylinder-block. The 1967 302 used the same crankshaft stroke as the 283, but was forged steel for high-performance duty. This block is one of three displacements, 302/327/350, that underwent a crankshaft bearing diameter transformation for 1968 when the rod-journal size was increased from the diameter small-journal to a large-journal and a main-journal size that was increased from to .

The large-journal connecting rods were thicker (heavier) and used diameter cap-bolts to replace the small-journal&#x27;s 11/32. 1968 blocks were made in 2-bolt and 4-bolt versions with the 4-bolt center-three main caps each fastened by two additional bolts which were supported by the addition of thicker crankcase main-web bulkheads. When the journal size increased to the standard large-journal size, the crankshaft for the 302 was specially built of tufftride-hardened forged 1053-steel and fitted with a high-rpm diameter harmonic balancer. It had a 3/4-length semi-circular windage tray, heat-treated, magnafluxed, shot-peened forged 1038-steel &#x27;pink&#x27; connecting rods, floating-pin in 1969, forged-aluminum pistons with higher scuff-resistance and better sealing single-moly rings.

Its solid-lifter cam, known as the &quot;30-30 Duntov&quot; cam named after its /0.030 in hot intake/exhaust valve-lash and Zora Arkus-Duntov (the first Duntov cam was the / 1957 grind known as the &#x27;097, which referred to the last three digits of the casting number) the &quot;Father of the Corvette&quot;, was also used in the 1964-1965 carbureted 327/365 and fuel injected 327/375 engines. It used the &#x27;202&#x27; / valve diameter high-performance 327 double-hump &#x27;186 and 461 heads, pushrod guide plates, hardened &#x27;blue-stripe&#x27; pushrods, edge-orifice lifters to keep more valvetrain oil in the crankcase for high-rpm lubrication, and stiffer valvesprings. In 1967, a new design high-rise cast-aluminum dual-plane intake manifold with larger smoother turn runners was introduced for the Z/28 that the /370 hp 1970 LT1 also used.

Unlike the Corvette, the exhaust manifolds were the more restrictive rear outlet &#x27;log&#x27; design to clear the Camaro chassis&#x27;s front cross-member. It had a chrome oil filler tube in the front of the intake manifold next to the thermostat housing from 1967 to 1968. The first year had unique chrome valve covers with Chevrolet stamped into them without an engine displacement decal pad. In 1968, the engine had the chrome covers, but without the Chevrolet name, connected to a PCV valve and a chrome drop-base open-element air cleaner assembly fitted with a crankcase breather on a vacuum secondary Holley 4-Bbl carburetor. 1969 Corvette and 1970 Z/28 engines were also equipped with this Holley carburetor until the Q-jet carburetor returned in 1973. A &#x27;divorced&#x27; exhaust crossover port heated well-choke thermostat coil was used to provide cleaner and faster engine warm-up. Its cast-aluminum distributor came in two styles, single-point had an ignition point cam designed to reduce point bounce at high rpm (Camaro) and transistorized (Corvette). Both distributors had a vacuum diaphragm to advance ignition timing at part-throttle for economy and emissions.

Pulleys for the balancer, alternator, water-pump, as well as optional power steering, were deep-groove to retain the drive belt(s) at high rpm. In 1969, the 302 shared the finned cast aluminium valve covers with the LT1 350 Corvette engine. Conservatively rated at (SAE gross) at 5800 rpm and at 4800, actual output with its production 11.0:1 compression ratio was around with primary x collector Sanderson tubular headers that came in the trunk when ordered with a 1967 Z/28, and associated carburetor main jet and ignition timing tuning. In 1968, the last year for factory headers, they had primaries x collectors. A stock 1968 Z/28 with the close-ratio transmission, optional transistorized-ignition and 4.88 gear, fitted with little more than the factory cowl plenum cold-air hood induction and headers, was capable of running 12.9 second/  times on street tires.

After the 1967 Trans-Am campaign with the four-barrel induction system producing more horsepower than the competing automakers&#x27; eight-barrel systems, for 1968, Chevrolet developed a factory &#x27;cross-ram&#x27; aluminum intake-manifold package using two Holley mechanical secondary carburetors for Trans-Am racing. It was available only as off-road service parts purchased over the Chevrolet dealership parts counter. With the Chevrolet `140 1st-design off-road cam, the package increased a stock 302&#x27;s horsepower from to approximately . Chevrolet went so far as to carry the positive crankcase ventilation system (PCV) over to the cross-ram induction system to retain emissions compliance mandated for U.S.-produced cars beginning in 1967, that also provided full-throttle crankcase pressure venting to the intake air to burn its vapors.

Engines prepared for competition use were capable of producing with little more than the eight-barrel induction, ported heads with higher pressure valvesprings, roller rocker arms, and the `754 2nd-design road-race cam. 1967/1968 models&#x27; cowl-induction system had an enclosed air-cleaner assembly ducted from its passenger side into the firewall cowl above the heater core.

Another popular service-parts-only component used on the 302 was the Option K66 T.I. Specialties magnetic-pulse Delco transistor-ignition ball bearing distributor. Introduced in 1963 on Pontiac&#x27;s drag racing engines, General Motors fitted it to the 1967 Z/28 before they used it on the L88 Corvette. It eliminated the production breaker-point ignition allowing greater spark energy and more stable ignition timing at all engine speeds including idle. This was one of the least talked about yet most transformative and comprehensive performance and durability upgrades of its time. Many of the 302s off-road service parts were the development work of racers like Roger Penske. Every part in a SCCA Trans-Am engine had to be available through local Chevrolet parts departments to encourage their use by anyone who wanted them.

While the 302 became a strong Limited Sportsman oval track racing engine in the hands of racers like Bud Lunsford in his 1966 Chevy II, its bore/stroke and rod/stroke geometries made it a natural high-rpm road-racing engine and were responsible for its being among the more reliable production street engines homologated for full competition across all the American makes, winning back-to-back Trans-Am Championships at the hands of Mark Donohue in 1968 and 1969. However, with engines built by Al Bartz, Falconer &amp; Dunn and Traco Engineering, the pinnacle of the 302&#x27;s use in professional racing was its being the primary engine that powered the outstanding but overshadowed 1968-1976 Formula 5000 Championship Series, a SCCA Formula A open-wheel class designed for lower cost.

The engine was also popular in Formula 5000 racing around the world, especially in Australia and New Zealand where it proved more powerful than the Repco-Holden V8. Weighing , with a iron block and head engine positioned near the car&#x27;s polar moment of inertia for responsive turn pivoting, a Hewland 5-speed magnesium transaxle, and wide front/ wide rear magnesium wheels, it produced incredibly exciting racing. They ran in 2.8 seconds and over .

Reminiscing about the series, mid-70s Australian F5000 driver Bruce Allison said, &quot;We never used first gear at the start. We started in second, and even then there was so much torque, you&#x27;d get wheelspin through third and fourth gears.&quot; Prepared with a Lucas-McKay mechanically-timed individual-stack magnesium fuel-injection induction system that was paired with ported production car double-hump iron heads, a rev-kit fitted roller lifter camshaft, roller bearing rocker arms, and a virtually stock production crankshaft, it had a lasting impact on the series&#x27; ability to conduct high car-count finishes and close competition events by the degree of mechanical success it provided to a series filled with star international Grand Prix drivers like Mario Andretti, Mark Donohue, David Hobbs, Graham McRae, Brian Redman, Jody Scheckter, and Al and Bobby Unser.

===327===
The V8, introduced in 1962, had a bore of 4.00in and 3.25in stroke. The exact displacement is . Power ranged from depending on the choice of carburetor or fuel injection, camshaft, cylinder heads, pistons and intake manifold. In 1962, the Duntov solid lifter cam versions produced , with single Carter 4-barrel, and , with Rochester fuel-injection. In 1964, horsepower increased to for the newly named &quot;L-76&quot; version, and for the fuel injected &quot;L-84&quot;, making the L-84 the most powerful naturally aspirated, single-cam, production small-block V8 until the appearance of the , Generation III LS6 in 2001. This block is one of three displacements that underwent a major change in 1968 when the main journal size was increased from . In 1965, Chevrolet released the now-legendary &quot;L-79&quot;, which was nothing more than an L-76 (11.0:1 forged pop-up pistons, forged steel rods and crank, 2.02 Corvette heads), but with the 30-30 Duntov cam replaced by the No. &#x27;151 hydraulic cam.

In 1966, Checker began offering the 327 as an option. The Avanti II and its successors were powered by the 327 and later versions of the small-block V8.

The 327 was fitted in the English Gordon-Keeble. Ninety-nine cars were made between 1964 and 1967. It was also installed in many Isos, until 1972 when General Motors started demanding cash in advance and the Italian manufacturer switched to the Ford Cleveland V8.

In 1968, the 327 L73 developing was part of the CKD packages exported to Australia from Canada for use in the locally assembled (by General Motors Holdens) Chevrolet Impala and Pontiac Parisienne. GMH used the same specification engine in the Holden HK Monaro GTS327. The engine was used in the Monaro GTS327 to make it the new Holden Muscle Car, and so it could compete in the local improved production (Australian Group C). The car had modified suspension just before release to also be used in local Series Production racing (Australian Group E). A special build 327 was built for GMH for the final run of the HK GTS327 by the Canadian McKinnon Industries. It was a lower compression version of the 1968 engine first used on the HK GTS327, and was dressed as a 1969 engine sporting all 1969 parts. The 327 was replaced in the mid-1969 HT Monaro by the 350 L48 developing .

===350===

The , with a stroke, first appeared as a high-performance &quot;L-48&quot; option for the 1967 Camaro. The exact displacement is . One year later, it was made available in that form in the Chevrolet Nova, and in 1969 the lower-compression mainstream LM1 version became an option in the rest of the Chevrolet line. As had been the case with earlier versions of the small-block, the 350 was available in the Beaumont sold by Pontiac Canada, which unlike its U.S. counterparts, used Chevrolet chassis and drivelines. Many variants followed.

====L46====
Years: 1969–1970

The &quot;L46&quot; became an optional engine for the 1969 Chevrolet Corvette. It was a higher-performance version of the base V8 with casting number 186, valve heads and had an 11.0:1 compression ratio requiring high octane gas. This produced (SAE gross power) and 380 lb⋅ft (515 N⋅m) torque. It was also available in 1970 with a four-barrel Quadrajet carburetor and L46 hydraulic cam, dome piston (+), 186 heads, and a four-bolt block.

====L48====
Years: 1967–1980

The &quot;L48&quot; is the original engine. It was introduced for 1967 in the Super Sport (SS) version of the Camaro (which used it until 1969) and for 1968 in the Chevy II/Nova (which used it until 1979). In 1969, it was used in almost all car lines—Camaros, Caprices, Impalas, El Caminos, Chevelles, and Novas. The 1969 L48s use a hydraulic cam, 4bbl Quadrajet carburetor, cast pistons, 4-bolt main casting number 010 blocks and casting number 041 or 186 heads. Power output was SAE and torque. Compression ratio was 10.25:1. The compression ratio of the L48 was lowered to 8.5:1 in 1971.

In 1972, the L48 (four-barrel V8) option for the Nova was part of the SS package. This is indicated by the fifth digit in the VIN being a &quot;K&quot;. 1972 was the only year the SS package could be verified by the VIN.

The L48 engine was exported to Australia, where it appeared in the Holden Monaro from 1969 through 1974, and in the Statesman from 1971 through 1974. Towards the end of the HQ series in 1973–74, due to US emissions regulations, the performance of these engines had dropped to the same or lower than Holden&#x27;s locally manufactured V8, which was not yet subject to similar regulations, so Holden discontinued using the engine.

The L48 V8 was the standard engine in the 1975–1980 Chevrolet Corvette. The L48 V8 Corvette engine produced in 1975. Power increased to in 1976 and stayed the same in 1977. The 1978 saw for California or high altitude areas and everywhere else. Power increased to in 1979 but decreased to in 1980.

A modified version of the L48 was used in the Kodiak F1, however only 2 units were ever fit with this motor, one tuned to the full , the other had a standard EU specification motor, and the other 4 cars produced were never fit with an engine before they were destroyed. The modifications were, new forged pistons, Brodix cylinder heads, higher compression ratio, and a significantly lighter from stock Flywheel.

====L65====
The 1970 model year Camaro had a high-performance two-barrel Rochester carburetor. In 1971, it dropped to , and net performance further dropped to for 1972 and for 1973–1976. It was basically the two-barrel version of the L48 350. It was produced until the 1976 model year. It had of torque.

====LM1====
The &quot;LM1&quot; was introduced for 1969 model year as a 9.0:1 255 hp engine. It was essentially an L48 engine in all ways except for 75cc combustion chambers rather than the L48&#x27;s 64cc, and less spark advance to allow it to run on regular-grade fuel. Throughout its lifespan, it used a four-barrel carburetor (usually with a Rochester Quadrajet), mechanical ignition points, and an electronic or computer-controlled spark system. In a lower compression, unleaded gas, considerably more emissions control-hampered form it was rated at SAE net by 1971, and continued the base Chevrolet 350 cu in engine in passenger cars to 1988, optional in most models, standard in some. It was superseded by the L05 powerplant after 1988. This engine was fitted to automatic versions of the 1969 and 1970 Holden Monaro GTS350 in Australia where it was rated at 275 hp most likely due to the use of higher octane fuel and far more spark advance than was fitted to North American versions of the engine.

====ZQ3====
Years: 1969-1974

The &quot;ZQ3&quot; was the standard engine in the 1969–1974 Chevrolet Corvette.

In 1969 and 1970 it was a version of the small-block, with 10.25:1 compression and hydraulic lifters. It used a Rochester &quot;4MV&quot; Quadra-Jet 4-barrel carburetor and a L48 camshaft.

In 1971, power decreased to (gross) and (gross) of torque with a lower 8.5:1 compression. 1972 saw (net) and (net) of torque. In 1973 power decreased to , but increased slightly in 1974 to .

Post-1971 blocks possibly had a lower nickel content but thicker cylinder deck, and post 1974 heads of the small-block Chevrolet used less iron, and were lighter weight, crack-prone, and were less powerful because of the lower compression ratios used.

====LT-1====
Years: 1970–1972

The &quot;LT-1&quot; was one of the most well-known Chevrolet small-block V8s, becoming available in 1970. It used solid lifters, 11.0:1 compression, the &quot;178&quot; high-performance camshaft, and a vacuum secondary Holley four-barrel carburetor on a special high-rise aluminum intake, with special 2.5&quot; outlet rams&#x27; horn exhaust manifolds in the Corvette, Delco transistor ignition and a low-restriction exhaust factory rated at in the Corvette, and at 6000 rpm and at 4000 rpm in the Camaro Z28 (the NHRA rated it at for classification purposes). Redline was 6,500 rpm but power fell off significantly past 6,200 rpm. The LT-1 was available in the Corvette and Camaro Z28. Power was down in 1971 to dual-rated (gross)/ (net) and of torque with 9.0:1 compression, and again in 1972 (the last year of the LT-1, then rated using net only, rather than gross, measurement) to and .

====L82====
Years: 1973–1980

The 1973–1974 &quot;L82&quot; was a &quot;performance&quot; version of the 350 that still used the casting number 624 76cc chamber &quot;2.02&quot; heads but with a Rochester Quadra-jet 4bbl carburetor and dual-plane aluminum intake manifold, the earlier L46 350 hydraulic-lifter cam, and 9.0:1 compression forged-aluminum pistons producing (1971 was the first year for SAE net hp rating, as installed in the vehicle with accessories and mufflers) and of torque. Its cast-aluminum LT1 valvecovers were painted crinkle-black contrasting with the aluminum manifold and distributor housing. It was down to and of torque for 1975. It produced in the Corvette for 1976–1977. The 1978 L82 recovered somewhat, producing and in the Corvette and in 1979 it produced in the Corvette. In 1980, its final year, it produced a peak of . This engine was also available on the Chevrolet Camaro in 1973 and 1974.

====L81====
Years: 1981

The &quot;L81&quot; was the only Corvette engine for 1981. It produced and of torque from 8.2:1 compression, exactly the same as the 1980 L48, but added hotter cam and computer control spark advance, replacing the vacuum advance. The L81 was the first Corvette engine to employ a &quot;smart carburetor.&quot; The 1980 Rochester Quadrajet was modified to allow electronic mixture control, and an ECM (Engine Control Module) supplied with data from an exhaust oxygen sensor, modified the air–fuel mixture being fed to the engine.

====LS9====
Years: 1969–1986

The &quot;LS9&quot; was GM&#x27;s 350 cubic inch truck engine used in C/K and G-series models up to GVWR (gross vehicle weight rating). The LS9 used a Rochester four-barrel carburetor, and its power ratings for 1984 were at 3800 rpm, and torque at 1600 rpm. A version using a closed-loop carburetor was used with the California emissions package in its final years. The LS9 and LT9 engines were replaced for 1987 by the L05 TBI (throttle-body fuel injection) engines. Most of the small-block engines in this timeframe were built at either the Flint engine plant in south Flint, Michigan, or at St. Catharines, Ontario. The Flint plant was producing about 5,200 engines per day in the mid-1980s, and had a slower, separate line for the TPI engines used in the Camaro and Corvette.

====LT9====
Years: 1981–1986

The &quot;LT9&quot; served as GM&#x27;s heavy-duty (over GVWR) emissions variant of the . It was used in C/K 20/30 pickups, G30 passenger and cargo vans (built in Lordstown, OH, and later in Flint, MI), and P30 chassis used for motorhomes and step vans.

The LT9&#x27;s listed specifications are at 3,800 rpm and of torque at 2,800 rpm with 8.3:1 compression. LT9 engines were carbureted with Rochester Quadrajets from the factory and generally have four-bolt mains. The LT9 is often known as the &quot;M-code 350,&quot; from the eighth character of the VIN.

====L83====
Years: 1982 and 1984

The 1982 L83 was again the only Corvette engine, producing and of torque from 9.0:1 compression. Since GM did not assign a 1983 model year to production Corvettes, there was no L83 for 1983. This was also the only engine on the 1984 Corvette, at and of torque. The L83 added &quot;Cross-Fire&quot; fuel injection (twin throttle-body fuel injection).

====L98====
Years: 1985–1992

The new 1985 L98 350 added tuned-port fuel injection (TPI), which was standard on all 1985–1991 Corvettes. It was rated at for 1985–1986, for 1987-1989 ( with 3.08:1 rear axle ratio (1988-1989 only)), and in 1990–1991 ( with 3.08:1 rear axle). Aluminum cylinder heads (Corvette only) were released part way through the 1986 model run, modified for 1987 with D-ports, and continued through the end of L98 Corvette production in 1991 (still used on ZZx 350 crate engines until 2015 when the ZZ6 received the fast burn heads). The L98 V8 was optional in January 1987–1992 Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird models (rated at and )
The 1987 versions had and more and a change to hydraulic roller camshaft. Compression was up again in 1990 to 9.5:1 Camaro/Firebird and 10:1 Corvettes, but rated output stayed the same.

Vehicles using the L98:
*1985-1991 Chevrolet Corvette
*1987-1992 Chevrolet Camaro (optional)
*1987-1992 Pontiac Firebird (optional)

====L05====
The L05 was introduced in 1987 for use in Chevrolet/GMC trucks in the GMT400 (introduced in April 1987 as 1988 models) and the R/V series trucks such as the K5 Blazer, Suburban, and rounded-era pickups (including chassis cabs and four-door crew cabs). The L05 was also used in the G-van models and the P30 step vans, as well as in 9C1-optioned police package Caprices, and in the following other vehicles:

*1992–1993 Buick Roadmaster sedan and station wagon
*1990–1992 Cadillac Brougham (optional engine)
*1993 Cadillac Fleetwood
*1989–1993 Chevrolet Caprice 9C1 police package (roller cam); 1A2-optioned special service station wagon
*1992–1993 Chevrolet Caprice wagon (optional engine)
*1993 Chevrolet Caprice LTZ
*1992 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser wagon (optional engine)
*1991–1994 GMC W4500 Tiltmaster/Isuzu NPR
*1995–1996 AM General Hummer H1

L05s were used primarily with casting number 14102193 (64cc combustion chambers) cylinder heads with swirled intake ports—the intake ports were designed for fuel economy (the design was also shared with the 103 heads used on the 4.3L with TBI). The swirl ports (known to GM as a vortex chamber) along with the irregular shape of the combustion chambers limit the airflow and horsepower output where they did not provide a fast burn, later phased in with the 1996 Vortec heads. A majority of the L05s used with the trucks and vans had conventional flat tappet camshafts, while the Caprice 9C1 (1989–93) had a roller cam. L05 usage was replaced by the LT1 after 1993 in GM B-bodies and D-bodies until production ceased in 1996.

A single belt (serpentine belt) accessory drive was introduced on the L05, the 5.0L L03, and the 4.3L V6 LB4 engines used in the 1988 GMT400 models, but not on the older R/V models (R/V models received the serpentine belt drive in 1989 when the front grille was facelifted in appearance to the GMT400 lineup). In mid-1996, the L05 was equipped with heads used in the 1996 G30. In February 2008, a Wisconsin businessman reported that his 1991 Chevrolet C1500 pickup had logged over 1 million miles without any major repairs to its L05 engine. The article also mentioned that the Flint engine plant that built the engine, had produced 45 million engines in its 45-year history, before closing in 1999.

====L31====
The Vortec 5700 L31 (VIN code &quot;R&quot;) is a 5.7L V8 truck engine. It is Chevrolet&#x27;s last production first-generation small-block. The cylinder heads feature combustion chambers and intake ports very similar to those of the LT1 V8, but lacking the LT1&#x27;s reverse-flow cooling and higher compression. As such, the L31 head is compatible with all older small-blocks, and is a very popular upgrade. It offers the airflow of more expensive heads, at a much lower cost. It does, however, require a specific intake manifold (the L31 has four bolts per head attaching the intake manifold, as opposed to the &quot;traditional&quot; six bolts per head found on older Chevrolet small-blocks). Chevrolet&#x27;s L31 was replaced by GM&#x27;s LS-based 5.3L LM7 and 6.0L LQ4. Depending on components and computer module the Vortec 5700 produces to at 4600 rpm and to of torque at 2800 rpm. Known as the GEN 1+, the final incarnation of the 1950s-vintage small-block ended production in 2003. It is still in current production as a crate engine for marine applications and automotive hobbyists as the &#x27;RamJet 350&#x27; with minor modifications. Volvo Penta and Mercury Marine also still produce the L31. The &quot;Marine&quot; intake, despite its cast iron construction, is an L31 upgrade that allows use of common Bosch-style injectors with various flow rates while still maintaining emission compliance.

==4.125 in bore family (1970–1980)==

===400===
The 400 is the only engine in this family; it was introduced in 1970 and produced for ten years. It has a bore and a stroke. The 400 differed from other small-blocks in that the cylinders were siamesed and therefore required &#x27;steam&#x27; holes in the block, head gaskets, and heads to help alleviate &#x27;hot-spots&#x27; in the cooling system at the point above the siamesed cylinders. The 400 is the only engine that uses a main bearing journal and a rod bearing journal. The connecting rod was also 400 specific being as opposed to the rod used in all other small-block Chevrolet engines. The 400 was made in 4-bolt main journal from 1970 to 1972 and in 2-bolt main journal from 1973 to 1979. The 400 can have either 2 or 3 frost-plugs per side though all 400 blocks have the provisions for a 3rd frost-plug on each side.

The 400 was rated at gross ( SAE net) through its life. The 400 saw extensive use in full-size Chevrolet and GMC trucks; K5 Blazer/Jimmy, 1/2-ton, 3/4-ton, 1-ton, and even larger &#x27;medium duty&#x27; trucks had an option to be equipped with a 400. The engine was available in midsize A-Body and full-size B-Body passenger cars until the end of the 1976 model year. Early models produced with a two-barrel carburetor. All 400s came with a two-barrel carburetor until 1973. A four-barrel carburetor option became available in 1974.

The 400 was never intended as a high-performance engine and never saw large factory horsepower numbers; nevertheless, it developed a reputation for creating considerable torque for its horsepower (up to in 1970) and has since become popular for many types of racing, both on- and off-road. It was also used for the limited production Avanti for a few years in the 1970s.

==3.671 in bore family (1975–1976)==

===262===
The 1975–1976 262 (RPO LV1) was a 90° pushrod V8 with an iron block and heads. Bore and stroke were . Power output for 1975 was at 3600 rpm and at 2000 rpm. The 262 was replaced with the 305 for the 1977 model year.

This was Chevrolet&#x27;s second 4.3L power plant; four other Chevrolet engines displaced 4.3L: the Vortec 4300 (a V6 based on the Chevrolet , with two cylinders removed), the original V8 in 1954, a bored version of the stovebolt-era 235 inline six displacing , and a derivative of the Generation II LT engines known as the L99 (using the 305&#x27;s bore, -long connecting rods, and a stroke).

This engine was used in the following cars:
*1975–1976 Chevrolet Monza
*1975 Chevrolet Nova
*Early 1977 Pontiac Ventura

==3.736 in bore family (1976–1998)==

===305===
Designed and built during the era of the gas embargo, CAFE mandates, and tighter emissions, this engine family was designed to become Chevrolet&#x27;s cost-effective, all-purpose &quot;economy V8&quot; engine line. Introduced in 1976 models, it had a displacement of . It was intended to fill the gap left when the venerable 283 and 307 had been discontinued. Bore and stroke were , using the 350&#x27;s crankshaft throw. This new engine family would provide better gas economy than the 350, share its basic architecture and many parts with the 350 (thus reducing production costs), and provide customers with more horsepower and torque than Chevrolet&#x27;s 1970s-era inline 6 and V6 engines. During the early 1980s, when GM was streamlining their engine lineups, the Chevrolet 305 would rise to prominence as General Motors&#x27; &quot;corporate&quot; engine, signified by being the standard (and often only) V8 in many GM vehicles. Through much of the 1980s, the 305 became General Motors&#x27; most common V8, followed closely by Oldsmobile&#x27;s 307. The 305 also became the standard V8 in GM&#x27;s C/K truck series, and was even used in the Corvette for California in 1980.

Crankshafts used with the 305 had the same casting number as the 350 with one discernible difference—the 305 crank is lighter in weight to compensate for engine balancing. As a result, the counterweights are smaller, which makes it unsuitable for use in a 350 where metal would have to be welded back on. The medium journal 305, like its big-brother 350, would be further developed in the 1990s, although with a reduced stroke using connecting rods, into the Generation II LT engine L99 263.

From 1976 onward into the early 1980s, these engines were prone to wearing out their camshaft lobes prematurely due to a combination of improper manufacturing and poor quality controls (a result of GM&#x27;s cost-cutting measures). The 305 is sometimes dismissed in performance circles because of its lackluster performance, small bore size, and difficulty flowing large volumes of air at high rpm. However, two variants of the 1983 to 1992 305 were notable performers: the 1983–1988 L69 High Output 5.0L (only used in late 1983–early 1986 F-body and late 1983–1988 Monte Carlo SS) and the 1985–1992 LB9 Tuned Port Injection 5.0L (F-body only).

After 1993, its usage was limited to light trucks and SUVs until the 1999 model year while vans and commercial vehicles continued until 2002. The 305 was sold as a crate motor under the Mr. Goodwrench brand as a replacement motor and as a boat engine for Mercury Marine until late 2014 when it was discontinued. The cylinder block is still in production by GM (part number 10243869) for Sprint Car Spec Racing.

====LG3====

The first iteration of the 305, the LG3 was introduced in 1976. This variant used a Rochester 2GC carburetor from 1976 to 1978. In 1979, the more fuel-efficient Rochester Dual-Jet two-barrel carburetor replaced the older 2GC. This change also resulted in a drop in power to and for California emissions cars. All years had an 8.5:1 compression ratio. It was discontinued in 1982.

====LG4====
The LG4 produced and . Introduced in 1978, the LG4 was essentially an LG3 with the addition of a four-barrel carburetor and larger valves. The engine saw a series of gradual improvements, increasing reliability, fuel economy, and power output through its production run. In 1981 (1980 for California models), Chevrolet added GM&#x27;s new &quot;Computer Command Control&quot; (CCC) engine management system to the LG4 engines (except Canadian models). The CCC system included the electronic Rochester 4-bbl E4ME Quadra-Jet, with computer-adjusted fuel metering on the primary venturis and a throttle position sensor allowing the CCC to calculate engine load. In the ignition system, CCC was fully responsible for the timing curve; mechanical and vacuum advances were eliminated from the distributor. The more precise spark timing provided by the CCC made possible a series of increases in compression ratio from a pre-CCC 8.4:1, to 8.6:1, to a knock-sensor–assisted 9.5:1, all while still only requiring 87 AKI regular unleaded fuel.

In 1983, Chevrolet replaced the cast-iron intake with an aluminum version and used either 14014416 (&quot;416&quot;) or 14022601 (&quot;601&quot;) heads with 1.84 inch intake valves, 1.50 inch exhaust valves, 58 cc chambers, and 178 cc runners. For 1985, the 4-valve-relief, flat top pistons from the L69 were added to the LG4, which resulted in another increase in compression. Also added was a knock sensor to allow the &quot;CCC&quot; engine management system to compensate for the increase in compression and a more aggressive spark-timing map in the ECM. As a result, power increased for the 1985 models to from the rating in 1984. For 1986, Chevrolet changed over to a one-piece rear main seal engine block design to minimize leaks and warranty claims; however, some early 1986 blocks retained a two-piece rear main seal.

For 1987, Chevrolet once again made some revisions to increase overall reliability, many of them borrowed from the TBI L03, which was to replace the LG4. The coil-in-cap HEI distributor was retired, and an all-new electronic distributor design was used. The intake manifold to head bolt pattern was redesigned to improve gasket integrity—four of the center intake manifold bolts were drilled at 72° instead of 90° for the cast iron cylinder heads. Changes to the valve covers were also made. Ribbing was added to the top of the valve covers to increase surface area, acting as a heat sink. To improve intake gasket sealing, the mounting bolts were relocated to the valve cover centerline, placing all sealing pressure evenly upon the mounting flange perimeter. Thus, these became known as centerbolt valve covers, first introduced in 1985 on the LB4 4.3L V6 and the Corvette a year earlier (the aluminum cylinder heads used with the Corvette were the first to have the centerbolt valve covers). Another improvement was use of a hydraulic lifter/roller camshaft on most 1987 LG4s. Some early engines have lifter retainer provisions, but use the older, non-roller camshaft. 1987 would also be the last year for the LG4 production, however a run of LG4 engines was made to supplement the carry-over production for the 1988 Monte Carlo and the 1988 Chevrolet Caprice.

====LU5====
Years: 1982–1984

The LU5 &quot;Crossfire EFI 5.0L&quot; featured a dual Throttle Body Injection set-up, based upon the original &quot;Crossfire Intake&quot; supplied by Chevrolet for the 1969 Camaro Z28. Unlike, the original &#x27;69 version, Chevrolet did not place it in the trunk for owners to install. The system used a special version of GM&#x27;s still-new &quot;CCC&quot; engine management system. Fuel was supplied by the two TBI units, set diagonally apart from each other, atop the unique, aluminum intake manifold. Unfortunately, the system was placed atop the basic LG4 and lacked any significant performance capability. The engine was originally planned for the long-awaited &#x27;82 Camaro Z28, however due to a last-minute GM-mandated cancellation of Pontiac&#x27;s 301 V8 production &amp; Turbo 4.9L Project (T301), the Crossfire 305 was made available in the &#x27;82 Trans Am. A 350 cubic inch version was also used in the Corvette from 1982 to 1984. Since it was fairly early into GM&#x27;s electronic engine management development and electronic fuel injection programs, few dealerships had the technology, equipment, or properly trained mechanics capable of dealing with these engines. These problems were compounded by widely varying fuel quality standards, production issues, poor quality control by GM, &amp; owners who tinkered with a system they did not understand. In a very short time, these engines obtained the notorious nickname; &quot;Ceasefire Engine&quot;. Today, owners with these engines note that they are fairly reliable, and that a significant upgrade can be made by simply using the L69/LB9 TPI/L98 TPI exhaust manifolds/ exhaust systems. When combined with performance-built stock 305 heads w/larger valves or aftermarket heads, plus a camshaft upgrade, these engines can perform surprisingly well. Thanks mostly to a somewhat cult-like following, a number of aftermarket performance parts are also available through Crossfire-specialized manufacturers.

====L69====
Years: late 1983–1988

The L69 High Output 5.0L was released late into the 1983 model year. It was optional in the Firebird Trans Am, Camaro Z28, and IROC-Z, and was standard in the revived Monte Carlo Super Sport.

The L69 features a compression ratio of 9.5:1 and a relatively aggressive stock camshaft. It also uses a performance-tuned CCC ECM/PROM, a knock sensor, a performance-tuned E4ME Rochester Quadra-Jet 4 barrel carburetor, and a special, free-flowing exhaust system with large diameter exhaust manifolds, Y-pipe and catalytic converter.

The L69 F-body exhaust system components would be revised slightly and used again on the later LB9 305 and L98 350 TPI engines. Additionally, the engines came equipped with a functional cold air induction hood on the 1983-1984 Trans Am, a dual snorkel air cleaner assembly on the 1983-1986 Camaro Z28 and IROC-Z and 1985-1986 Trans Am, a large, single snorkel on the 1983-1988 Monte Carlo SS (also, rare optional dual snorkel in 1987-1988), an aluminum intake manifold, high stall torque converter on the Monte Carlo SS and 1984 F-bodies, or a lightweight flywheel on T-5 equipped F-bodies.

The L69 engine produced at 4800 and of torque at 3200 rpm in the F-Body and was rated at in the Monte SS.

====LE9====
Years: 1981–1986

The LE9 was a version of the 305 with a four-barrel carburetor and equipped with electronic spark control (ESC), a 9.2-9.5:1 compression ratio, the LM1 cam and 14010201 casting heads featuring 1.84/1.50&quot; valves, and chambers. The engine produced at 4,400 and at 2,000 rpm. The LE9 was available in C/K trucks and G vans.

====LB9====

Years: 1985–1992

The LB9 &quot;Tuned Port Injection 5.0L&quot; was introduced in 1985. At its core was the stout L69 shortblock and it used the same aggressive L69 camshaft profile. The induction system was unlike any system used previously by GM. It featured a large plenum made of cast aluminum, with individual runners made of tubular aluminum, feeding air to each cylinder. And each cylinder had its own fuel injector fed by a fuel rail mounted above each bank. In 1985, this engine was optional only in the Camaro Z28, IROC-Z and Trans Am equipped with the WS6 performance suspension. The LB9 was also available in the &#x27;87-92 GTA and Firebird Formula.
 and and varied between (with of torque) over the years offered.

====L03====
Years: 1987–95

The L03 produced at 4400 rpm and of torque at 2400 rpm in 1993–1995 GM trucks. This engine used the TBI throttle body fuel injection, which was a hybrid between EFI and carburetor technology. It used an EFI system with electronically controlled injectors, which were mated to a twin barrel &quot;carburetor&quot; body. It featured &quot;swirl port&quot; heads (helped emissions, but severely stunted power output) and served as the base V8 engine in all C/K 1500 Series and 2500 Series (under 8,500 lbs GVWR) GMC/Chevrolet trucks and vans. It was also very common in Firebirds and Camaros because it was the only engine that offered a five-speed manual combination. The 350 exceeded the Borg-Warner T5&#x27;s input power ratings, and as such, it was cut from the 350 cars to prevent lemon law and warranty losses.

The L03 used hydraulic roller lifters, which allowed it to recover some of the lost horsepower from its factory design, while further increasing efficiency (reduced rotational drag). Despite downfalls in its aspiration restrictions, the L03 was known for its reliability (1987–1990 F-bodies with the L03 did not use a rev limiter). The L03 used dished pistons with a 9.3:1 to 9.5:1 compression ratio. The L03 TBI featured a 3.736&quot; bore and 3.48&quot; stroke, the same as its TPI cousin, the LB9.

====L30====
Years: 1996–2002

The Vortec 5000 L30 is a V8 truck engine, displacing 5,020 cc (305.4 cubic inches). Bore is and stroke is . The compression ratio is 9.1:1. It was replaced by the 4.8 L Vortec 4800 LR4 for the 1999 Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra trucks and 2003 Express/Savana vans. In C/K trucks, the 5000 produces net flywheel at 4600 rpm and net flywheel torque at 2,800 rpm. In vans, it produces net flywheel at 4600 rpm and net flywheel torque at 2,800 rpm. The engine uses a hydraulic roller cam and high-flowing, fast burn–style Vortec heads. Differences include bore and stroke, intake valve size, and smaller combustion chambers.

L30 applications:
* 1996–2002 Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana 1500 and 2500 series vans under 8,500 pounds GVWR
* 1996–1999 Chevrolet C/K and GMC Sierra 1500 and 2500 full-size trucks under 8,500 pounds GVWR

==3.50 in bore family (1979–1982)==

===267===
The 267 was introduced in 1979 for the GM F-body (Camaro), G-body (Chevrolet Monte Carlo, El Camino), A-body (Malibu Classic, 1979–1981) and also used on GM B-body cars (Impala and Caprice models). The engine had the 350&#x27;s crankshaft stroke of and the smallest bore of any small-block, , shared with the 200 V6 introduced a year earlier.

It was only available with a M2ME Rochester Dualjet 210–effectively a Rochester Quadrajet with no rear barrels. After 1980, electronic feedback carburetion was used on the 267 with the exception of the following Canada-spec cars: the Buick Regal in place of the Buick 4.1 V6, the Oldsmobile Cutlass and Delta 88 in place of the Olds 260 V8, and the Pontiac Grand LeMans, Grand Prix, and Parisienne in place of the Buick 4.1 V6. The 267 also saw use in 1980 to 1982 Checker Marathons.

While similar in displacement to the other V8 engines produced by General Motors (including the Oldsmobile 260 and Pontiac 265), the small bore 267 shared no parts with the other engines and was phased out after the 1982 model year due to inability to conform to emission standards. Chevrolet vehicles eventually used the as their base V8 engine.

The 267, when introduced in the GM F-Body as the L39 4.4L, made at 3600 rpm and of torque at 2000 rpm (SAE net). Power output would drop in subsequent years of the engine. The had a low 8.3:1 compression ratio.

==Major changes==
The original design of the small-block remained remarkably unchanged for its production run, which began in 1954 and ended, in passenger vehicles, in 2003. The engine is still being built today for many aftermarket applications, both to replace worn-out older engines and also by many builders as high-performance applications. The principal changes to it over the years include:

*1956 – Full-flow oil filtration was introduced, using a paper element filter in a canister that was mounted to a boss that was added to the left rear cylinder block casting and machined for this purpose.
*1957 – The displacement of the base V8 continued at 265 cubic inches, but optional V8 engines were introduced with a displacement of 283 cubic inches.
*1958 – Bosses for side motor mounts were added to the block casting, used for production mounts for this and all future model years. However, the features for front motor mounts as used in 1955–1957 remained part of the block casting in this and future years. The 265-cubic-inch version of the engine was discontinued. Also, the cylinder head valve cover mounting bolt holes were changed from the top row staggered (relative to the bottom row of bolts) to the &quot;straight-across&quot; pattern that remained the way of identifying the early heads from the newer ones with a valve cover design which lasted until the 1987 center-bolt-style covers.
*1962 – The block&#x27;s cylinder wall casting was revised to allow four-inch bores, and the 327-cubic-inch version of the engine, using this bore diameter and increased stroke, was introduced.
*1967 - The oil filter mounting received an adapter and machining to allow the use of spin-on filters; canister mounting was possible by removing the adapter.
*1968 – The main-journal diameter was increased from 2.30&quot; (small) to 2.45&quot; (medium), and the connecting-rod journal diameter was increased from 2.00&quot; to 2.10&quot;. This allowed the use of cast-iron crankshafts; the previous crankshafts were made of forged steel, which was more expensive. The rod bolts were changed from 11/32&quot; diameter to 3/8&quot;. The oil-fill location was moved from a tube on the front of the intake manifold to a cap on the left- or right-side valve cover, depending upon the application.
*1980 – Weight reduction though thinner cylinder wall block and light weight head castings. Heads are prone to cracking and blocks typically cannot tolerate an overbore more than .040&quot;.
*1986 – The rear main seal was changed from a 2-piece rubber design to a 1-piece rubber design that used a mounting appliance to hold it in place. This necessitated a change in the flywheel/flex plate bolt pattern as well as requiring an externally balanced flex plate/flywheel.
*1987 – The valve cover surfaces were changed so that the mounting lip was raised and the bolt location was moved from 4 bolts on the perimeter to 4 bolts along the centerline of the valve covers (this design debuted on the Corvette in 1986, and the Chevrolet 4.3L 90 degree V6 the year before). Also changed were the mounting angles of the two center bolts on each side of the intake manifold (from 90 to 73 degrees), and the lifter bosses were increased in height to accept roller lifters; the aluminum-alloy heads for use on the Corvette engines retained the non-angled bolts. Also, all carburetors(except some 1987-89 F-body and B-body models, also the 30 and 3500 model 1-ton trucks through 1989 with either the M-code 350 or W-code 454 engines, in which all retained the 4bbl Rochester E4ME carbs) were replaced by TBI (throttle-body injection) fuel injection.
*1996 – The cylinder heads were redesigned, using improved ports and combustion chambers similar to those in the Generation II LT1, resulting in significant power increases. The intake manifold bolt pattern was also changed to four bolts per cylinder head instead of the &quot;traditional&quot; six bolts. The cylinder block timing cover lip was thickened for use with the plastic timing cover (redesigned for use with a crankshaft position sensor with integrated dowel pins - cylinder blocks for 1996+ do not have dowel pins in the timing cover flange) held with 8 bolts and the water pump bypass hole on the RH deck and below the water pump passage undrilled. Also the fuel pump boss is still present but undrilled (which dates back to the 1992 model year for production engines without a fuel pump block-off plate - some marine/industrial blocks and crate motors sold over the counter via GM dealerships e.g. Goodwrench, ZZ6, 350 H.O. retain the use of a mechanical fuel pump).

:This was the last change for the Generation I engine, which continued through the end of the production run in 2003; all 1997–2003 Generation I engines were &quot;Vortec&quot; truck engines.

;Chevrolet Generation I V8 Small-Block Engine Table
&quot;note 1: depending upon vehicle application; horsepower, torque, and fuel requirements will vary. &quot;

==Generation II GM small-block (1992–1997)==

General Motors&#x27; Generation II LT1 is a small-block V8 engine. Making its debut in the 1992 Chevrolet Corvette, the new LT1 sought to draw upon the heritage of the 1970 Chevrolet LT1.

A significant improvement over the original Generation I V8 is the Generation II LT1&#x27;s &quot;reverse cooling&quot; system, allowing coolant to start at the heads and flow down through the block. This keeps the heads cooler, affording greater power through a higher compression ratio and greater spark advance at the same time it maintains higher and more consistent cylinder temperatures.

Some parts from the Generation II are interchangeable with the Generation I one-piece rear main seal engine. The interchangeable parts include the rotating assembly (crank shaft, pistons, connecting rods, and flywheel/flex-plate) one piece rear main seal housing, oil pan and valve cover gaskets and valvetrain assembly (not including timing set, which includes a gear to drive the water pump). The LT1 uses a new engine block, cylinder head, timing cover, water pump, intake manifold and accessory brackets. The harmonic damper also does not interchange; it is a unique damper/pulley assembly. Engine mounts and bell housing bolt pattern remain the same, permitting a newer engine to be readily swapped into an older vehicle.

=====LT1=====

In 1991, GM created a new-generation small-block engine called the &quot;LT1 350&quot;, distinct from the high-output Generation I LT1 of the 1970s. It displaced , and was a 2-valve pushrod design. The LT1 used a reverse-flow cooling system which cooled the cylinder heads first, maintaining lower combustion chamber temperatures and allowing the engine to run at a higher compression than its immediate predecessors.

This engine was used in:

* Y-body:
** 1992–1996 Chevrolet Corvette C4
* F-body:
** 1993–1997 Chevrolet Camaro Z28, B4C and SS
** 1993–1997 Pontiac Firebird Formula, Trans Am, and Firehawk
* B-body:
** 1994-1996 Buick Roadmaster
** 1994–1996 Chevrolet Caprice
** 1994–1996 Chevrolet Caprice Police Package
** 1994–1996 Chevrolet Impala SS
** 1994–1996 Chevrolet Caprice Wagon
** 1994–1996 Buick Roadmaster Wagon
* D-body:
** 1994–1996 Cadillac Fleetwood

There were a few different versions of the LT1. All feature a cast iron block, with aluminum heads in the Y- and F-bodies, and cast iron heads in the B- and D-bodies. Corvette blocks had four-bolt main caps, while most other blocks were two-bolt main caps. Block castings remained the same between 2 and 4 bolt mains.

The 1992–93 LT1s used speed density fuel management, batch-fire fuel injection and a dedicated Engine Control Module (ECM). In 1994 the LT1 switched to a mass airflow sensor and sequential port injection. A new, more capable computer controlled the transmission as well as the engine and got a new name: Powertrain Control Module (PCM). Where the ECM held its calibration information in a replaceable PROM chip, the 1994-95 OBD1 PCMs are reprogrammable through the diagnostic port.

The early Optispark distributor had durability problems, and a revised version was introduced on the 1994 B- and D-bodies and on the 1995 Y- and F-bodies. Changes include a vacuum port to draw filtered air through the distributor to remove moisture and ozone and a revised drive system which uses an extended dowel pin on the camshaft rather than a separate splined shaft in the camshaft gear. 1996 saw major revisions for OBD-II: a second catalytic converter on the F-body cars, rear oxygen sensors to monitor catalyst efficiency, and a new engine front cover with a crankshaft position sensor. Some OBD-II features had been added to the Corvette starting in 1994 for testing purposes. The 1997 model year Camaro and Firebird were the last year for this engine in a GM production car before it was replaced by the LS1, which was already in the Corvette for 1997.

The 1992 LT1s in Y-body Corvettes were factory rated at and . 1996 LT1 Corvettes were rated at and .

The 1993–95 F-bodies were rated at and , while the 96–97 cars were rated at and . The 96–97 WS6 and SS F-bodies were rated at .

The 1994–96 B- and D-bodies were rated at and ( with V08 mechanical fan as part of V92 or V4P towing option groups).

=====LT4=====

The LT4 was the special high-performance version of the new-generation LT1. It featured a slightly more aggressive camshaft profile, 1.6:1 aluminum roller rocker arms, lighter hollow intake valves and liquid-sodium filled exhaust valves, larger fuel injectors, performance crankshaft, higher 10.8:1 compression ratio and high-flow intake manifold (painted red) with extra material above the port available to allow port matching to the raised port LT4 cylinder heads. The LT4 was conservatively underrated at and . It was introduced in the 1996 model year, for the last year of the C4 Corvette, and came standard on all manual transmission (ZF 6-speed equipped) C4 Corvettes. The engine was passed down to 1997 SLP Camaros SS and SLP Firehawks with 6-speed manual transmissions.

The LT4 was available on the following vehicles:
* 1996 Chevrolet Corvette only when equipped with 6-speed manual transmission (includes all Grand Sports) (Production: 6,359)
* 1997 Chevrolet Camaro SLP/LT4 SS 6-speed (Production: 100 for the U.S., 6 for Canada. There were 2 prototypes)
* 1997 Pontiac Firebird SLP/LT4 Firehawk 6-speed (Production: 29)

All 135 production engines for the Firehawks and SSs were completely disassembled, balanced, blueprinted and honed with stress plates. One in 5 engines was tested on a Superflow engine dyno. Every car was tested on a chassis dyno and then performed a road test.

===3.90 in bore blocks===

====5.7 L====
=====LT5=====

For model year 1990, Chevrolet released the Corvette ZR-1 with the radical Lotus Engineering-designed double overhead cam LT5 engine. Engineered in the UK but produced and assembled in Stillwater, Oklahoma by specialty engine builder Mercury Marine, the all-aluminum LT5 shared only the 4.4 inch bore spacing with any previous Chevy small-block engine. It does &quot;not&quot; have reverse cooling and is generally not considered a small-block Chevrolet.

Used only in Corvettes, the LT5 was the work of a team headed by Design manager David Whitehead, and was hand built by one headed by project engineer Terry D. Stinson. It displaced and had a bore x stroke instead of the usual and featured Lotus-designed DOHC 4 valves per cylinder rather than the usual Chevrolet 16-Valve OHV Heads. The preproduction LT5 initially produced , but was reduced to and for the 1990-1992 Corvette ZR-1. The power ratings jumped to at 5800 rpm and of torque at 5200 rpm from 1993 until its final year in 1995, thanks to cam timing changes and improvements to the engine porting. 1993 also added 4-bolt main bearing caps and an exhaust gas recirculation system.

A second generation of the LT5 was in the testing phase as early as 1993. What little information survived showed that it would have used a dual plenum system similar to the first generation Dodge Viper as well as variable valve timing. The next generation LT5 was set to produce between and . Unfortunately, the cost to produce the LT5 along with its weight, dimensions (it would not fit the C5 pilot cars without extensive modifications) and internal GM politics over using an engine that was not designed and built in house killed the LT5 after six years of production. GM canceled the ZR-1 option beginning model year 1993. Engines that were to be installed in the as yet unbuilt ZR-1&#x27;s were sealed and crated for long-term storage. After they were built at the Mercruiser plant in Stillwater, Oklahoma they were shipped to Bowling Green, Kentucky and stored in the Corvette assembly plant until the 1994 and 1995 ZR-1s went down the assembly line. A total of 6,939 cars were produced. The LT5 was not an evolutionary dead end: in spite of being discontinued without a direct successor, a new class of premium V8s for Cadillac and eventually Oldsmobile, the dual overhead cam V8 Northstar and its derivatives, drew heavily from the LT5&#x27;s design and lessons learned from its production. GM also took lessons learned from producing a completely aluminum engine and applied them to the new LS series of engines.

The LT5 was available on the following vehicles:
* 1990-1995 Chevrolet Corvette C4 ZR-1 equipped with 6-speed manual transmission (Production: 6,939). Although the LT5 was never used in another production GM vehicle, it did make its way into several Corvette concepts, race cars and even into a limited run of the Lotus Elise GT1.

====4.3 L====
=====L99=====
The L99 V8, produced from 1994–1996, shared a cylinder bore with the but had a stroke compared to of the . The pistons used in the 4.3 L V8 were the same as the Vortec 5000&#x27;s, but longer connecting rods were used to compensate for the shorter stroke. The L99 featured updated Generation II block architecture, and is externally identical to the larger 5.7 L LT1 Generation II V8. Like the LT1, it features sequential fuel injection, reverse-flow cooling with a cam-driven water pump, and an optical ignition pickup. Output is and .

The L99 4.3 L V8 was the base engine in 1994-1996 Chevrolet Caprice sedans, including 9C1 police package sedans, and was not available in any other vehicles. The L99&#x27;s smaller displacement provided slightly better EPA fuel economy than the 5.7 L LT1, but at significantly reduced horsepower and torque levels.

===LT6 and LT7===

The LT6 and LT7 are not actually part of the LT family. See Oldsmobile Diesel engine for more information.

<text>Spirits in Bondage: A Cycle of Lyrics (1919) was C. S. Lewis&#x27;s first published work (originally published under the pseudonym Clive Hamilton, which is Lewis&#x27; first name followed by his mother&#x27;s maiden name). Lewis was 20 years old and had just returned from military service in the First World War. His tutor, William T. Kirkpatrick, encouraged him in publishing the book, although it was unusual at Lewis&#x27;s age, as writers were expected to wait longer before sharing their work with the world. 

The book is composed of three different sections of poetry. The poems take on several styles and rhythms throughout the book, but share common themes. This work stands out among Lewis&#x27;s writings not only because of the focus on poetry rather than prose, but because the author had not yet made his conversion to Christianity; therefore the themes and worldviews offered in &quot;Spirits in Bondage&quot; differ greatly from those for which Lewis is most well known. The book received no reviews and its reception was a slight disappointment for Lewis. The title is derived from Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1.658).

==Contents==
&quot;Spirits in Bondage&quot; is composed of three sections of poetry: &quot;The Prison House&quot;, &quot;Hesitation&quot;, and &quot;The Escape&quot;. The complete contents of the book are as follows:

==Themes==
&quot;Spirits in Bondage&quot; differs from more widely read Lewis works in that he does not yet write from a Christian worldview. The poems are meant to be read in order (thus, &quot;A Cycle of Lyrics&quot;) so that the themes can develop and present themselves to the reader properly. Although not an atheist, Lewis takes the stance of an agnostic with a pessimistic outlook on religion and God. A central theme to his poetry, which led him to choose the title &quot;Spirits in Bondage&quot;, is his early belief that God had instilled deep desires in Man that could not be attained, and that Man would think he were reaching his goal only to be ultimately bitterly disappointed.

Lewis also takes an attitude toward nature not typical of his later works. In &quot;Spirits in Bondage&quot; nature is cruel and hard, deceptive and not to be trusted, although Lewis does admire her in several of the poems.

Also notable are Lewis&#x27;s references to both mythology and the war atmosphere in which he had lived. Kirkpatrick noted that Lewis, his most brilliant student, had read more classics than any other boy he knew. In a few scattered poems Lewis draws a picture of the war front for the audience; indeed, &quot;Death in Battle&quot; was published in the &quot;Reveille&quot; periodical.

<doc id="878733" wikidata="Q589454" url="?curid=878733" title="Douglas XB-19">
<text>The Douglas XB-19 was a four-engined, piston-driven heavy bomber produced by the Douglas Aircraft Company for the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) during the early 1940s. The design was originally given the designation XBLR-2 (&quot;XBLR&quot; denoting &quot;Experimental Bomber, Long Range&quot;). It was the largest bomber built for the USAAF until 1946, with the Convair B-36 surpassing it in size.

==Design and development==
The XB-19 project was intended to test flight characteristics and design techniques for giant bombers. Despite advances in technology that made the XB-19 obsolete before it was completed, the Army Air Corps believed the prototype would be useful for testing despite Douglas Aircraft wanting to cancel the expensive project. Its construction took so long that competition for the contracts to build the XB-35 and XB-36 occurred two months before its first flight.

The plane first flew on 27 June 1941, more than three years after the construction contract was awarded. It was based at Wright Field from January to November 1942. In 1943, the Wright R-3350 engines were replaced with liquid-cooled W24 Allison V-3420-11 by the aircraft division of Fisher Body in support of the XB-39 project. As part of the program, it was equipped with engine driven auxiliary powerplants. After completion of testing, the XB-19 was earmarked for conversion into a cargo aircraft, but modifications were not completed, and the aircraft flew for the last time on 17 August 1946. It was eventually scrapped at Tucson in June 1949.

==Surviving artifacts==
The new U.S. Air Force had plans to save the XB-19 for eventual display, but in 1949 the Air Force did not have a program to save historic aircraft and the Air Force Museum had not yet been built. The XB-19 was therefore scrapped, but two of its enormous main tires were saved.

:&quot;After leaving Shinjō this morning we crossed over a steep ridge into a singular basin of great beauty, with a semi-circle of pyramidal hills, rendered more striking by being covered to their summits with pyramidal cryptomeria, and apparently blocking all northward progress. At their feet lies Kanayama in a romantic situation, and, though I arrived as early as noon, I am staying for a day or two, for my room at the Transport Office is cheerful and pleasant, the agent is most polite, a very rough region lies before me, and Ito has secured a chicken for the first time since leaving Nikkō!&quot;

A monument commemorating Isabella Bird can be seen in the town centre.

<doc id="878752" wikidata="Q1572128" url="?curid=878752" title="Spanish language in the Philippines">
<text>Spanish was the sole official language of the Philippines throughout its more than three centuries of Spanish rule, from the late 16th century to 1898, then a co-official language (with English) under its American rule, a status it retained (now alongside Filipino and English) after independence in 1946. Its status was initially removed in 1973 by a constitutional change, but after a few months it was once again designated an official language by a presidential decree. However, with the adoption of the present Constitution, in 1987, Spanish became designated as an auxiliary or &quot;optional and voluntary language&quot;.

During the period of Spanish viceroyalty (1565–1898), it was the language of government, trade, education, and the arts. With the establishment of a free public education system set up by the viceroyalty government in the mid-19th century, a class of native Spanish-speaking intellectuals called the &quot;Ilustrados&quot; was formed, which included historical figures such as José Rizal, Antonio Luna and Marcelo del Pilar. By the end of Spanish rule, a significant number of urban and elite populations were conversant in Spanish, although only a minority of the total population had knowledge of the language.

It served as the country&#x27;s first official language as proclaimed in the Malolos Constitution of the First Philippine Republic in 1899 and continued to be widely used during the first few decades of U.S. rule (1898–1946). Gradually however, the American government began promoting the use of English at the expense of Spanish, characterizing it as a negative influence of the past. By the 1920s, English became the primary language of administration and education. While it continued to serve as an official language after independence in 1946, the state of Spanish continued to decline until its removal from official status in 1973. Today, the language is no longer present in daily life and despite interest in some circles to learn or revive it, it continues to see dwindling numbers of speakers and influence. Roughly 400,000 Filipinos (less than 0.5% of the population) were estimated to be proficient in Spanish in 2020.

The Spanish language is regulated by the Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española, the main Spanish-language regulating body in the Philippines, and a member of the Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española, the entity which regulates the Spanish language worldwide.

==Background==
===Overview===

Spanish was the language of government, education and trade throughout the three centuries of Spanish rule and continued as the country&#x27;s lingua franca until the first half of the 20th century. Spanish was the official language of the Malolos Republic, &quot;for the time being&quot;, according to the Malolos Constitution of 1899. Spanish was also the official language of the Cantonal Republic of Negros of 1898 and the Republic of Zamboanga of 1899.

While Spanish was introduced through the colonial public education system, it was never spoken on a wide scale in the Philippines. Only populations in urban areas or in places with a significant Spanish presence used the language on a daily basis or learned it as a second or third language.

During the early part of the U.S. administration of the Philippine Islands, Spanish was widely spoken and relatively well maintained throughout the American colonial period. Even so, Spanish was a language that bound leading men in the Philippines like Trinidad Hermenegildo Pardo de Tavera y Gorricho to President Sergio Osmeña and his successor, President Manuel Roxas. As a senator, Manuel L. Quezon (later President), delivered a speech in the 1920s entitled &quot;Message to My People&quot; in English and in Spanish.

===Official language===
Spanish remained an official language of government until a new constitution ratified on January 17, 1973, designated English and Pilipino, spelled in that draft of the constitution with a &quot;P&quot; instead of the more modern &quot;F&quot;, as official languages. Shortly thereafter, Presidential Proclamation No. 155 dated March 15, 1973 ordered that the Spanish language should continue to be recognized as an official language so long as government documents in that language remained untranslated. A later constitution ratified in 1987 designated Filipino and English as official languages. Also, under this Constitution, Spanish, together with Arabic, was designated an optional and voluntary language.

===Influence===
There are thousands of Spanish loanwords in 170 native Philippine languages, and Spanish orthography has influenced the spelling system used for writing most of these languages.

===Chavacano===

Chavacano (also called Zamboangueño) is a Spanish-based creole language spoken mainly in the southern province of Zamboanga and, to a much lesser extent, in the province of Cavite in the northern region of Luzon. An estimated 689,000 people speak Chavacano. In 2010, the Instituto Cervantes de Manila estimated the number of Spanish speakers in the Philippines in the area of three million, which included the native and the non-native Chavacano and Spanish speakers.

==History==
===Spanish colonial period===

Spanish was the language of government, education and trade throughout the three centuries (333 years) of the Philippines being part of the Spanish Empire and continued to serve as a lingua franca until the first half of the 20th century. It was first introduced to the Philippines in 1565, when the conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi founded the first Spanish settlement on the island of Cebú. The Philippines, ruled first from Mexico City and later from Madrid, was a Spanish territory for 333 years (1565–1898). Schooling was a priority, however. The Augustinians opened a school immediately upon arriving in Cebú in 1565. The Franciscans followed suit when they arrived in 1577, as did the Dominicans when they arrived in 1587. Besides religious instruction, these schools taught how to read and write and imparted industrial and agricultural techniques.

Initially, the stance of the Roman Catholic Church and its missionaries was to preach to the natives in local languages, not in Spanish. The priests learned the native languages and sometimes employed indigenous peoples as translators, creating a bilingual class known as Ladinos. Before the 19th century, few natives were taught Spanish. However, there were notable bilingual individuals such as poet-translator Gaspar Aquino de Belén. Gaspar produced Christian devotional poetry written in the Roman script in Tagalog. &quot;Pasyon&quot; is a narrative of the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ begun by Gaspar Aquino de Belén, which has circulated in many versions. Later, the Spanish-Mexican ballads of chivalry, the corrido, provided a model for secular literature. Verse narratives, or komedya, were performed in the regional languages for the illiterate majority.

In the early 17th century, a Tagalog printer, Tomás Pinpin, set out to write a book in romanized phonetic script to teach the Tagalogs how to learn Castilian. His book, published by the Dominican press in which he worked, appeared in 1610, the same year as Blancas&#x27;s &quot;Arte&quot;. Unlike the missionary&#x27;s grammar, which Pinpin had set in type, the Tagalog native&#x27;s book dealt with the language of the dominant, rather than the subordinate, other. Pinpin&#x27;s book was the first such work ever written and published by a Philippine native. As such, it is richly instructive for what it tells us about the interests that animated Tagalog translation and, by implication, conversion during the early colonial period.
By law, each town had to build two schools, one for boys and the other for girls, to teach the Spanish language and the Christian catechism. There were never enough trained teachers, however, and several provincial schools were mere sheds open to the rain. That discouraged the attendance at school, and illiteracy was high in the provinces until the 19th century, when public education was introduced. The conditions were better in larger towns. To qualify as an independent civil town, a barrio or group of barrios had to have a priest&#x27;s residence, a town hall, boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; schools; streets had to be straight and at right angles to one another so that the town could grow in size; and the town had to be near a good water source and land for farming and grazing.

Better school conditions in towns and cities led to more effective instruction in the Spanish language and in other subjects. Between 1600 and 1865, a number of colleges and universities were established, which graduated many important colonial officials and church prelates, bishops, and archbishops, several of whom served the churches in Hispanic America. The increased level of education eventually led to the rise of the Ilustrados. In 1846, French traveler Jean Baptiste Mallat was surprised at how advanced Philippine schools were. In 1865, the government inaugurated the Escuela Normal (&quot;Normal School&quot;), an institute to train future primary school teachers. At the same time, primary schooling was made compulsory for all children. In 1869, a new Spanish constitution brought to the Philippines universal suffrage and a free press. &quot;El Boletín de Cebú&quot;, the first Spanish newspaper in Cebu City, was published in 1886.

In Manila, the Spanish language had been more or less widespread to the point that it has been estimated at 50% of the population knew Spanish in the late 19th century. In his 1898 book &quot;Yesterdays in the Philippines&quot;, covering a period beginning in 1893, the American Joseph Earle Stevens, an American who resided in Manila from 1893 to 1894, wrote:
Long contact between Spanish and the local languages, Chinese dialects, and later Japanese produced a series of pidgins, known as &quot;Bamboo Spanish&quot;, and the Spanish-based creole Chavacano. At one point, they were the language of a substantial proportion of the Philippine population. Unsurprisingly, since the Philippines was administrated for centuries from New Spain in present-day Mexico, Philippine Spanish is broadly similar to Latin American Spanish not only in vocabulary but also in pronunciation and grammar.

The Spanish language was the official language used by the civil and judicial administration, and it was spoken by the majority of the population in the main cities and understood by many, especially after the passing of the Education Decree of 1863. By the end of the 19th century, Spanish was either a mother tongue or a strong second language among the educated elite of the Philippine society, having been learned in childhood either directly from parents and grandparents or in school, or through tutoring.

====Schools====
In the 16th and the 17th centuries, the oldest educational institutions in the country were set up by Spanish religious orders. The schools and universities played a crucial role in the development of the Spanish language in the islands. Colegio de Manila in Intramuros was founded in 1590. The Colegio formally opened in 1595, and was one of the first schools in the Philippines. In the same year, the University of San Carlos in Cebú, was established as the Colegio de San Ildefonso by the Jesuits. In 1611, the University of Santo Tomás, considered as the oldest existing university in Asia, was inaugurated in Manila by the Dominicans. In the 18th century, fluent male Spanish-speakers in the Philippines were generally the graduates of those schools or of the Colegio de San Juan de Letrán, established in 1620. In 1706, a convent school for Philippine women, Beaterios, was established. It admitted both Spanish and native girls, and taught religion, reading, writing and arithmetic with music and embroidery. Female graduates from Beaterios were fluent in Spanish as well. In 1859, Ateneo de Manila University was established by the Jesuits as the Escuela Municipal.

In 1863, Queen Isabel II of Spain decreed the establishment of a public school system, following the requests of the islands&#x27; Spanish authorities, who saw the need of teaching Spanish to the wider population. The primary instruction and the teaching of Spanish was compulsory. The Educational Decree provided for the establishment of at least one primary school for boys and girls in each town and governed by the municipal government. A Normal School for male teachers was established and was supervised by the Jesuits. In 1866, the total population of the Philippines was only 4,411,261. The total public schools was 841 for boys and 833 for girls and the total number of children attending the schools was 135,098 boys and 95,260 girls. In 1892, the number of schools had increased to 2,137, 1,087 of which were for boys and 1,050 for girls. The measure was at the vanguard of contemporary Asian countries and led to an important class of educated natives that sometimes continued their studies abroad, like the national hero José Rizal, who studied in Europe. That class of writers, poets and intellectuals is often referred to as &quot;Ilustrados&quot;. Ironically, it was during the initial years of American occupation in the early 20th century that Spanish literature and press flourished, partially due to the freedom of the press allowed following the transition to American rule.

====Filipino nationalism and 19th-century revolutionary governments====


Before the 19th century, Philippine revolts were small-scale. Since they did not extend beyond linguistic boundaries, they were easily neutralized by Spanish forces. With the small period of the spread of Spanish through a free public school system (1863) and the rise of an educated class, nationalists from different parts of the archipelago were able to communicate in a common language. José Rizal&#x27;s novels, Graciano López Jaena&#x27;s satirical articles, Marcelo H. del Pilar&#x27;s anti-clerical manifestos, the bi-weekly &quot;La Solidaridad&quot;, which was published in Spain, and other materials in awakening nationalism were written in Spanish. The Philippine Revolution fought for reforms and later for independence from Spain. However, it opposed neither Spain&#x27;s cultural legacy in the islands nor the Spanish language. Even Graciano López Jaena&#x27;s &quot;La Solidaridad&quot;, an 1889 article that praised the young women of Malolos who petitioned to Governor-General Valeriano Weyler to open a night school to teach the Spanish language. In fact, the Malolos Congress of 1899 chose Spanish as the official language. According to Horacio de la Costa, nationalism would not have been possible without the Spanish language. By then, the people were increasingly aware of nationalistic ideas and independence movements in other countries.

During the Philippine Revolution, many of the Filipino patriots were fluent in Spanish, though Emilio Aguinaldo, the eventual first president of the Philippines, was more comfortable speaking Tagalog. The 1897 Biak-na-Bato Constitution and the 1898 Malolos Constitution were both written in Spanish. Neither specified a national language, but both recognised the continuing use of Spanish in Philippine life and legislation. Spanish was used to write the Constitution of Biak-na-Bato, Malolos Constitution, the original national anthem, &quot;Himno Nacional Filipino&quot;, as well as nationalistic propaganda material and literature.

In 1863, the Spanish language was taught freely when a primary public school system was set up for the entire population. The Spanish-speaking Ilustrados (Enlightened Ones) were the educated elite who promoted and propagated nationalism and a modern Filipino consciousness. The Ilustrados and later writers formed the basis of Philippine Classical Literature, which developed in the 19th century.

José Rizal propagated Filipino consciousness and identity in Spanish. Highly instrumental in developing nationalism were his novels, &quot;Noli Me Tangere&quot; and &quot;El Filibusterismo&quot; which exposed the abuses of the colonial government and clergy, composed of &quot;Peninsulares.&quot; The novels&#x27; very own notoriety propelled its popularity even more among Filipinos. Reading them was forbidden because they exposed and parodied the Peninsulares.

===Philippine–American War===
The revolutionary Malolos Republic of 1899 designated the Spanish language for official use in its constitution, drawn up during the Constitutional Convention in Malolos, Bulacan. The nascent republic published a number of laws, acts, decrees, and other official issuances. They were published variously in the Spanish, English, and Tagalog, with Spanish predominating. Spanish was also designated the official language of the Cantonal Republic of Negros of 1898 and the Republic of Zamboanga of 1899.

Many Spanish-speaking Filipino families perished during the Philippine–American War. According to the historian James B. Goodno, author of the &quot;Philippines: Land of Broken Promises&quot; (New York, 1998), one-sixth of the total population of Filipinos, or about 1.5 million, died as a direct result of the war.

===American colonial period===


After the Philippine–American War and the subsequent incorporation of the Philippine archipelago to the dominion of the United States, one of the policies implemented by the new rulers was to institute the English language as the primary language of the country, designating it as the medium of instruction, with the goal of bolstering the annual increase of the number of English-speaking population in the Philippines. However, in spite of this, the Spanish language maintained its hold in the educational system, as many private educational institutions, particularly those administered by religious orders, persisted in using the Spanish language. Only after World War I did the American authorities started to press more and more for the private schools to teach in English, leading to important Catholic universities such as the Ateneo de Manila and the University of Santo Tomas to phase out Spanish in favor of English.

The census of 1903 did not inquire the respondents regarding the language they spoke and understood, but it was asked in the 1918 census, in which it was reported that from a total population of 10,314,310, the number of Filipinos capable of speaking Spanish was 757,463 (or 7.34% of the total population), with 511,721 belonging to the male population and 245,742 belonging to the female population. In contrast, the number of English-speaking Filipinos was 896,258 (or 8.69% of the total population). Greater percentage of Spanish-speaking males compared to their English-speaking counterparts were found in Zamboanga, Manila, Isabela, Cotabato, Marinduque, Cagayan, Iloilo, Cavite, Albay, Leyte, Batangas, and Sorsogon. The province with the greater percentage of Spanish-speaking females compared to their English-speaking counterparts were found in Zamboanga, Cotabato, Manila, Davao, Ambos Camarines, Iloilo, and Sorsogon. The rest of the provinces had greater percentages of English-speaking people, with the provinces of Ifugao, Bontoc, Benguet, and Kalinga registering the greatest percentage of English-speaking males. The census also affirmed that those who learned to speak Spanish or English also possessed the ability to read and write in those languages.

While the 1918 census confirmed the great boost in the position of the English language in the Philippines since the arrival of the first Thomasites, Spanish still retained its privileged position in society, as was made clear by Henry Jones Ford, a professor from Princeton who was sent to the Philippines by the then American President Woodrow Wilson for a &quot;fact-finding mission&quot;. In his 1916 report, Ford wrote that the &quot;Filipino gentry speak Spanish and the masses speak native dialects which are not low languages, but are refined and capable instruments of thought&quot;, adding later on the following observations:

He also made note of the increasing usage of the native vernacular languages through which the literature of Filipino politics reached the masses, with the native newspapers and magazines in the Philippines tending to be bilingual and with the regular form being a Spanish section and a section written in the local vernacular language, while none of them was published in English. Additionally, the most widely circulated American newspaper has a Spanish section.

Antonio Checa Godoy assessed that between the Philippine–American War and the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, more than 220 periodical publications were written in Spanish or, in case of bilingual and even trilingual publications, Spanish was one of the languages used. They are published and disseminated not only in Manila but also in different parts of the country, with more than 30 of them published daily. Checa Godoy also identified the first two decades of the American rule in the Philippines as the &quot;Silver Age&quot; of the Philippine press in Spanish, with number of copies of Spanish language periodical publications being sold daily reaching 30,000 towards the end of the 1920s, more so than the other publications written in other languages. &quot;El Renacimiento&quot;, a Spanish-Tagalog bilingual newspaper established in 1901, was one of the most influential and widely distributed newspapers of the first decade of American colonial period. It was forced to close in 1908 due to a libel suit brought against it by then Secretary of Interior Dean C. Worcester after the publication of an editorial titled &quot;Aves de Rapiña&quot; (&quot;Birds of Prey&quot;), which Worcester took to be an insult against his honor and goodwill. Worcester was awarded $30,000 in damages, while the editor and publisher (Teodoro Kalaw and Martín Ocampo) were given jail sentences. It was then re-established by Martín Ocampo in 1910 under the name of &quot;La Vanguardia&quot;, although it did not prosper until its purchase in 1916 by Alejandro Roces, after which it continued publishing until the days of World War II. Another important newspaper was &quot;El Ideal&quot;, which was established in 1910 and served as an official organ of the Nationalist Party created by Sergio Osmeña, although it was allowed to die in 1916 due to financial reasons.

After the Silver Age came the period of decadence of the Philippine press written in Spanish, which Checa Godoy identified in the years of the 1920s and the 1930s. During this period, the number of Spanish-language newspapers and their circulation declined, while the presence of newspapers written in English and indigenous languages, especially Tagalog, increased and even overtook Spanish from its dominant position. The decline continued until the events of World War II, which effectively ended the Spanish-language press in the Philippines.

The census of 1939 showed the decline of the Spanish-speaking population in the Philippines, with the numbers slashed almost in half compared to the previous 1918 census: in a total population of approximately 16 million Filipinos, only 417,375 of them (or 2.6% of the population) are literate in the Spanish language. The census also remarked regarding the declining use of Spanish in the Philippines:

The need for a national language other than Spanish or English began to emerge from the late 1920s onwards, as President Manuel Quezon complained that almost as soon as he left Manila his speeches would need to be translated, as neither Spanish nor English could be used as a medium of successful communication throughout the national territory. Inés Villa, the 1932 Premio Zobel awardee, wrote in her prize-winning work &quot;Filipinas en el camino de la cultura&quot; that the educational system during the American period succeeded in its objective of widely disseminating the English language and making it an official language of the government, legislature, courts, commerce and private life, adding that the United States managed to achieve with English for only three decades what Spain failed to achieve with the Spanish language during its approximately four centuries of rule in the Philippines, further noting that as of the writing of her work, for every Filipino that speaks Spanish, there are approximately ten others that can speak English. In 1934, the Tydings-McDuffie Act excluded Spanish entirely from the curriculum of public schools, while the 1934 Constitutional Convention set 1940 as the expiry date of the usage of Spanish as the official language of the legislature and of the courts.

The years of the American colonial period have been identified as the Golden Age of Philippine Literature in Spanish by numerous scholars such as Estanislao Alinea, Luis Mariñas and Lourdes Brillantes. One explanation given to such a designation was the rich volume of literary output produced during this era using the Spanish language. Among the great Filipino literary writers of the period were Fernando María Guerrero, Jesús Balmori, Manuel Bernabé, Claro M. Recto and Antonio Abad. There were three reasons provided for this development, namely the relative freedom of expression during the American period compared to the previous Spanish colonial era, the publication venues provided by the Spanish language periodicals and periodicals written in other languages but with Spanish language sections, and the presence of the Premio Zobel. However, Estanislao Alinea also referred to those years as the &quot;Period of Efflorescence&quot;, highlighting the fact the behind the apparent vitality and productivity of these Spanish language writers lied the period of slow decadence and gradual decline of the language itself in the Philippines. Additionally, despite the relevance given to many of these writers in their social and nationalistic roles, even earning them an entry in the 1996 &quot;Encyclopedia of the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)&quot;, most of their literary works received scarce public reception even during their lifetime. According to Rocío Ortuño, the failure of their literary endeavours can be seen in the fact that some of their works were either left unpublished or, in case of their works published in periodicals, never compiled in volumes.

===Decline of Spanish===

Spanish flourished in the first two decades of the 20th century because of the partial freedom of the press and as an act of defiance against the new rulers. However, it soon declined afterwards as the U.S. administration began a heavier imposition of English as the official language and medium of instruction in schools and universities. Editorials and newspapers were increasingly forced to switch to English, leaving Spanish in a marginal position.

One of the first U.S. provisions in the Philippines, following the recommendations of the Schurman Commission, was the prohibition of Spanish as the language of instruction in public schools. Despite the fact that in 1934 it was established that American sovereignty would cease in 1946, the new Philippine Constitution stated the obligation to maintain English as the sole language of instruction. It is significant that the American language policy had among its main objectives to turn the Filipinos into &quot;a people who can govern themselves&quot;, an end for which they would need a common language: English.

In order to preserve Spanish, Enrique Zóbel de Ayala founded the Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española and the Premio Zóbel in 1924 to help maintain and develop the use of Spanish by the Filipino people.

Filipino nationalists and nationalist historiographers during the American colonial period took their liberal ideas from the writings of the 19th-century Filipino propaganda, which portrayed Spain and all things Spanish as negative or evil. Therefore, Spanish as a language was demonized as a sad reminder of the past. Those ideas gradually inculcated into the minds of the young generation of Filipinos (during and after the U.S. administration), which used those history textbooks at school that tended to generalize all Spaniards as villains because of lack of emphasis on Filipino people of Spanish ancestry, who were also against the local Spanish government and clergy and also fought and died for the sake of freedom during the 19th-century revolts during the Philippine Revolution, the Philippine–American War, and the Second World War.

By the 1940s, as children educated in English became adults, the use of Spanish started to decline rapidly. Still, a very significant community of Spanish-speakers lived in the largest cities, with a total population of roughly 300,000. However, with the destruction of Manila during the Japanese occupation in the Second World War, the heart of Spanish in the Philippines had been dismantled. Many Spanish-speaking Filipino families perished during the massacre and the bombing of the cities and municipalities between 1942 and 1945. By the end of the war, an estimated 1 million Filipinos had died. Some of the Spanish-speakers who survived were forced to migrate in the later years.

After the war, Spanish became increasingly marginalized at an official level. As English- and American-influenced pop culture increased, the use of Spanish in all aspects gradually declined. In 1962, Philippine President Diosdado Macapagal decreed that the Philippines would mark independence day on June 12, instead of July 4, when the country gained complete independence from the United States. This reflected a tendency to paint Spain as the villain and the United States as a more benevolent colonial power. Spanish language and culture were demonized again. In 1973, Spanish briefly lost its status as an official language of the Philippines, was quickly redesignated as an official language, and finally lost its official status by the ratification of a subsequent constitution in 1987.

===21st-century developments===
The 21st century has seen a small revival of interest in the language among select circles, with the numbers of those studying it formally at college or taking private courses rising markedly in recent years. A great portion of Spanish learners in the Philippines are in the social sciences, as until recently, many land titles, contracts, newspapers, and literature were still written in Spanish. Some &quot;Hispanista&quot; groups have even proposed making Spanish a compulsory subject again in school or having it used in administration, although the idea has elicited controversy among non-Spanish-speaking Filipinos.

Under the administration of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, relations between Spain and the Philippines strengthened. Philippine–Spanish Friendship Day was established to commemorate the cultural and historical ties, friendship, and co-operation between the Philippines and Spain. Additionally, the Department of Education reintroduced Spanish as an elective course in secondary schools in 2008.

During her visit to the Philippines in July 2012, Queen Sofía of Spain expressed her support for the Spanish language to be revived in Philippine schools, with 24 high school across the country offering the language as a subject. In September 2012, an agreement was made between the Philippine and Chilean governments to train Filipino schoolteachers in Spanish while in exchange, the Philippines would help train Chilean schoolteachers in English.

In 2018, the Sangguniang Kabataan of Barangay Cagniog, Surigao City passed a resolution declaring Spanish as one of the official working languages of the SK Barangay Cagniog which lead to enactment of an ordinance introduced by ex - SK Chairperson Frankie Salar and approved by Sangguniang Barangay in 2021. Further, the Sangguniang Panglungsod Surigao returning the ordinance to barangay for amendments, the said ordinance aim to include the teaching the Spanish in the said Barangay.

==Current status==
After Spain handed over control of the Philippines to the United States in 1898, the local variety of Spanish has lost most of its speakers, and it might be now close to disappearing.

Since a December 2007 directive signed by former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in Spain for the teaching and learning of the Spanish language in the Philippine school system starting in 2008, the number of high schools offering Spanish as an elective course has grown to 80 schools spread across all regions of the country. Language assistance is provided from Spain to train and provide scholarships for Spanish language teachers.

, interest in learning Spanish has largely been for economic purposes due to some demand for Spanish speakers from business process outsourcing companies in the Philippines or job prospects abroad in the United States, which have made a number of Filipinos flock to language centers such as Instituto Cervantes to learn Spanish.

===Demographics===

According to the 1990 Philippine census, there were 2,660 native Spanish speakers in the Philippines. In 2013, there were also 3,325 Spanish citizens living in the country. Figures in 2020 showed about 400,000 Spanish speakers with at least proficient knowledge, which accounts for under 0.5% of the population. This is a steep decline from 1998, when there were 1.8 million Spanish speakers, including those who spoke Spanish as a secondary language.

===Media===
Spanish-language media were present in the 2000s with one Spanish newspaper, &quot;E-Dyario&quot;, becoming the first Spanish digital newspaper published in the Philippines. Also, &quot;Filipinas, Ahora Mismo&quot; was a nationally syndicated, 60-minute, cultural radio magazine program in the Philippines that was broadcast daily in Spanish for two years in the 2000s.

On September 15, 2020, a new online magazine &quot;La Jornada Filipina&quot; was launched by Arvyn Cerézo.

==Phonology==

The main difference between Philippine Spanish and Peninsular Spanish is that Filipinos speak with an accent inherited from local Austronesian languages. In the Philippines, the and sounds, as in &quot;olla&quot; (&quot;pot&quot;) and &quot;hoya&quot; (&quot;pit&quot;), are often distinguished. prototypically occurs as , though it is sometimes realized as , especially among the most recent generation of speakers. , on the other hand, is typically realized as an approximant in all positions, rarely ever occurring as a fricative or affricate like in other Spanish dialects.

Filipinos also often distinguish between the / sound and the sound. However, the non-learned population generally merges the sound, written /, with the sound, written . Others, especially more modern speakers, may inconsistently distinguish and , sometimes even in the same word. Moreover, – distinction does not occur in Chavacano; instead, Spanish words with or are all loaned into Chavacano with being used for both phonemes.

The velar fricative , known in Spanish as &quot;jota&quot;, is strongly fricated , resembling Peninsular Spanish. It is also occasionally pronounced as glottal due to most Philippine languages lacking a phoneme but having . Thus, names like &quot;José&quot; may be pronounced or, less commonly, . Realization of as is also found in Andalusia, the Canary Islands, and some parts of Latin America.

==Influence on the languages of the Philippines==

There are approximately 4,000 Spanish loan words in Tagalog (between 20% and 33% of Tagalog words), and around 6,000 Spanish words in Visayan and other Philippine languages. The Spanish counting system, calendar, time, etc. are still in use with slight modifications. Archaic Spanish words have been preserved in Tagalog and the other Philippine vernaculars, such as (from , meaning &quot;cash&quot;), (&quot;soap&quot;, modern Spanish ; at the beginning of Spanish rule, the &quot;j&quot; used to be pronounced , the voiceless postalveolar fricative or the &quot;sh&quot; sound), &quot;&quot; (&quot;watch&quot;, modern Spanish , with a or [h] sound), and (&quot;money&quot;, from ).

==List of Spanish words of Philippine origin==


Although the greatest linguistic impact and loanwords have been from Spanish to the languages of the Philippines, the Philippine languages have also loaned some words to Spanish.

The following are some of the words of Philippine origin that can be found in the &quot;Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española&quot;, the dictionary published by the Real Academia Española:

<doc id="878757" wikidata="Q7757621" url="?curid=878757" title="The Poisonwood Bible">
<text>The Poisonwood Bible (1998), by Barbara Kingsolver, is a best-selling novel about a missionary family, the Prices, who in 1959 move from the U.S. state of Georgia to the village of Kilanga in the Belgian Congo, close to the Kwilu River. 

The novel&#x27;s title refers to Bible errata. The father of the family creates his own &quot;misprint&quot; of the Bible. He concludes his sermons with the Kikongo expression &quot;Tata Jesus is bängala&quot; with the intent of saying &quot;Jesus is most precious&quot;. In his hurried mispronunciation, he actually says &quot;Jesus is poisonwood&quot;.

==Plot==
Orleanna Price, the mother of the family, narrates the introductory chapter in five of the novel&#x27;s seven sections. The narrative then alternates among the four daughters, The four girls increasingly mature and develop differently as each adapts to African village life and the political turmoil that overtakes the Belgian Congo in the 1960s.

The Price family packs up their belongings for their flight to the Congo, where they are going to spend a year as the family of a missionary. However, shortly before leaving, they are informed that they are limited to 44 pounds of luggage per person. The Southern Baptist Mission League suggests they solve this problem by leaving for the airport wearing many layers of clothing, hiding household items among the layers of clothes to lighten their luggage.

The Price daughters – Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May – and their mother, Orleanna, and father, Nathan, attend their first church service in the village of Kilanga, and they realize how different their culture is from that of the Congo. For example, 14-year-old Leah helps her father plant a &quot;demonstration garden&quot;; it immediately receives criticism from Mama Tataba, whom the family has engaged as a live-in maid, and the garden does poorly due to the inappropriate climate. Nathan tries to hold an impromptu Easter celebration in hopes of baptizing numerous people, but he is unable to carry this out, as the river along the village, where he plans to hold the baptism, is infested with crocodiles.

Leah and her twin Adah begin to spy on Eeben Axelroot, the pilot who conveyed the family to Kilanga, and Nathan tries to convince Congolese men, one by one, to convert to Christianity. Meanwhile, five-year-old Ruth May befriends the village children. She finds out about Axelroot&#x27;s business with the diamonds after breaking her arm.

After Mama Tataba departs, an orphan boy named Nelson becomes the family servant. Nathan and Leah go to Leopoldville (present day Kinshasa) to witness what is going on with the independence in the Congo. Methuselah (a parrot the Prices adopted from the previous missionary) dies, and Adah finds his feathers. Ruth May becomes very sick and lies in bed for the majority of the day. Leah begins to spend a lot of time with Anatole, Kilanga&#x27;s teacher, discussing topics such as justice and the Congo. Leah wants to participate in the hunt, which upsets the village elders, as it would go against their custom, but she eventually is allowed to participate and even hunts an antelope.

The girls all gather together in the morning to check out the chicken coop. Inside they find footprints and a green mamba snake. A scream and gasp is heard from Ruth May, who has been bitten by the snake. The girls watch her turn cold and blue before she dies. Orleanna becomes filled with guilt over Ruth May&#x27;s death, and takes the other children away, leaving her arrogant husband to fend for himself. With Anatole&#x27;s help, they eventually reach safety.

The remaining Price sisters go through many different life changes: Adah dedicates herself to getting a scientific education back home (she is hemiplegic and wants to learn more about the condition); Leah marries Anatole and they start a family together; Rachel remains perceptive but vain and distrustful of men, goes through a string of marriages, and starts a business; and Nathan dies in his unsuccessful mission: killed by a mob of Kilanga&#x27;s villagers when they blame him for a crocodile attack on a boat of children.

The story ends with a final chapter from Ruth May reflecting on her sisters and mother attempting to visit her grave, but not being able to find it, and a woman telling them a place named Kilanga never existed. She watches her sisters and her mother, and has seen how they have matured; she has matured as well. Through her death, she finally is able to understand the Congolese term &quot;muntu&quot;, which describes the concept of unity and how all life is connected in some way. She understands that she is &quot;muntu&quot;, and a part of all that is around her. Ruth May only wants her mother to understand the concept and for her to move on. She asks for her mother to forgive herself and not live with the guilt anymore.

<doc id="878761" wikidata="Q8037768" url="?curid=878761" title="WrestleCrap">
<text>WrestleCrap is a professional wrestling website created by R. D. Reynolds and Merle Vincent, serving as a &quot;hall of shame&quot; for some of the worst gimmicks and storylines in professional wrestling history. The site is currently run by Reynolds and Justin Henry.

==History==
R.D. Reynolds and Merle Vincent launched the site in April 2000 and it quickly developed a following among wrestling fans. After Vincent&#x27;s suicide in September 2000, Reynolds continued to run the site by himself. He shut the site down in 2001, claiming the high cost of running the site was responsible. It returned the following year, albeit without the backlog of past inductions.

In 2006, the site added several new writers and features.

&quot;WrestleCrap&quot; is also the title of a book written by the site&#x27;s creators, with an introduction by John Tenta (). In addition, Reynolds has co-authored &quot;The Death of WCW&quot;, with wrestling journalist Bryan Alvarez, and he co-wrote &quot;The WrestleCrap Book of Lists!&quot; with Blade Braxton, released in late 2007. Both Reynolds and Alvarez were previously featured columnists for British pro wrestling and MMA magazine &quot;Fighting Spirit&quot;.

In December 2012, Reynolds announced a relaunch of the site, complete with more daily content and interactive features. The relaunch took place in January 2013.

In December 2016, the entire site archive was made available for users who made a one-time donation to the site, or supported the site on Patreon.

Braxton died in March 2021.

==Site content==
*&quot;WrestleCrap Inductions&quot;, new induction weekly with rotating classic inductions weekly. These have been written primarily by Reynolds over the years, including currently, but a number of others have written them as well.
*&quot;Someone Bought This&quot;, a look at some of the more ridiculous wrestling merchandise on sale. This segment often looks at eBay items placed for auction by various users.
*&quot;Headlies&quot;, faux wrestling news stories in the style of The Onion.
*&quot;It Came From YouTube&quot;, a weekly celebration of the most obscure, insane and sometimes brilliant wrestling related clips found on YouTube.
*&quot;Squash of the Week&quot;, a weekly column that focuses on squash matches. It serves as the successor to Jobber of the Week.
*&quot;RD&#x27;s Mailbag&quot;, Reynolds answers the questions he receives via email.

==Gooker Award==
The Gooker Award is given each year to the worst gimmick, storyline, match or event in wrestling in that year. The award is named after The Gobbledy Gooker, widely thought of as one of the most disastrous wrestling gimmicks of all time.

The 2001 award was not revealed until 2003 due to &quot;WrestleCrap&quot;&#x27;s closing in 2001.

Each year&#x27;s Gooker Award, with the exceptions of 2001 and 2002, was determined by a poll of site visitors. The 2001 and 2002 awards were chosen by Reynolds, since he felt there was no competition those years. For the 2014 award, Reynolds declared that Vince McMahon&#x27;s comments about &quot;brass rings&quot; and the Bella Twins feud were co-winners due to irregularities in the voting.

==WrestleCrap Radio (2005–2012; 2015–2021)==
In August 2005, WrestleCrap introduced a podcast called &quot;WrestleCrap Radio&quot;. Typically Reynolds and columnist Blade Braxton discussed their personal lives, made jokes that may or may not relate to current wrestling (or wrestling at all), and &quot;rarely&quot; discussed news items from the wrestling industry. On occasion interviews with guests from within the wrestling industry were broadcast such as their interviews with Vince Russo and Lance Storm. Induction writer Triple Kelly was the unofficial reserve host, having won a co-host contest in 2007. The regular podcasts ended with &quot;WrestleCrap Radio&quot; episode 249, released on July 13, 2012.

On August 20, 2015, to coincide with the 10 year anniversary of &quot;WrestleCrap Radio&quot;, a new episode of Reynolds and Braxton&#x27;s occasional &quot;RD and Blade Show&quot; podcast was instead revealed to be the surprise 250th episode of &quot;WrestleCrap Radio&quot;. Episode 251 was released ten days later on August 30, followed by two more episodes each in September and October.

The show was retired following Braxton&#x27;s death in March 2021.

<text>Allen John Carr (2 September 1934 – 29 November 2006) was a British author of books about smoking cessation and other psychological dependencies including alcohol addiction.

==Biography==
Born in Putney, London, Carr started smoking cigarettes while doing National Service aged 18. He qualified as an accountant in 1958.
Carr finally stopped smoking on 15 July 1983, aged 48, after a visit to a hypnotherapist. However, it wasn&#x27;t the hypnotherapy itself that enabled him to stop – &quot;I succeeded in spite of and not because of that visit&quot; and &quot;I lit up the moment I left the clinic and made my way home...&quot;. There were two key pieces of information that enabled Carr to stop later that day. First, the hypnotherapist told him smoking was &quot;just nicotine addiction&quot;, which Carr had never perceived before that moment, i.e. that he was an addict. Second, his son John lent him a medical handbook which explained that the physical withdrawal from nicotine is just like an &quot;empty, insecure feeling&quot;. He claims that these two realisations crystallised in his mind just how easy it was to stop and so then enabled him to follow an overwhelming desire to explain his method to as many smokers as possible.

===Philosophy===
Carr teaches that smokers do not receive a boost from smoking a cigarette, and that smoking only relieves the withdrawal symptoms from the previous cigarette, which in turn creates more withdrawal symptoms once &quot;it&quot; is finished. In this way the drug addiction perpetuates itself. He asserted that the &quot;relief&quot; smokers feel on lighting a cigarette, the feeling of being &quot;back to normal&quot;, is the feeling experienced by non-smokers all the time. He further asserted that withdrawal symptoms are actually created by doubt and fear in the mind of the ex-smoker, and therefore that stopping smoking is not as traumatic as is commonly assumed, if that doubt and fear can be removed.

At Allen Carr Clinics during stop-smoking sessions, smokers are allowed to continue smoking while their doubts and fears are removed, with the aim of encouraging and developing the mindset of a non-smoker before the final cigarette is extinguished. A further reason for allowing smokers to smoke while undergoing counselling is Carr&#x27;s belief that it is more difficult to convince a smoker to stop until they understand the mechanism of &quot;the nicotine trap&quot;. This is because their attention is diminished while they continue to believe it is traumatic and extremely difficult to quit and continue to maintain the belief that they are dependent on nicotine.

Another assertion unique to Carr&#x27;s method is that willpower is not required to stop smoking.

His contention was that fear of &quot;giving up&quot; is what causes the majority of smokers to continue smoking, thereby necessitating the smoker&#x27;s perpetuation of the illusion of genuine enjoyment as a moral justification of the inherent absurdity of smoking in the face of overwhelming medical and scientific evidence of its dangers. Instead, he encourages smokers to think of the act of quitting, not as giving up, but as &quot;escaping&quot;.

===Easyway===

Carr left his accountancy job in 1983 and set up his first &quot;Easyway&quot; clinic. He wrote ten books which appeared as bestsellers on selected book ranking charts including his first book &quot;The Easy Way to Stop Smoking&quot; (1985). The success of the original London clinic, through word-of-mouth and direct recommendation, has led to a worldwide network of 100 Easyway clinics in 35 countries plus the production of audio CDs and DVDs.

Allen Carr&#x27;s Easyway is clinically tested through two randomised controlled trials. In 2018 an Irish trial found that Allen Carr&#x27;s Easyway was almost twice as effective as Quit.ie and in 2020 a UK randomised clinical trial found Allen Carr&#x27;s Easyway &quot;as good as if not better than, the Gold Standard NHS Programme which uses NRT &amp; 1-1 psychological support. The two randomised controlled trials formed part of the evidence which led to approval for Allen Carr&#x27;s Easyway to Stop Smoking in-person Live Group Seminars use on the National Health Service (NHS). Approval was granted by England&#x27;s internationally renowned National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) with the committee finding that Allen Carr&#x27;s Easyway was not only effective but also cost-effective. Allen Carr&#x27;s Easyway is now used by NHS/Local Council Stop Smoking Services. Further studies continue to confirm the effectiveness of the method. 

Based on their full money-back guarantee (which requires two follow-up sessions without reimbursement of travel), Carr&#x27;s clinics claim 90% success rate in aiding smokers to stop for three months, and 51% success rate in helping smokers stop for 12 months based on an independent study not connected with any health organisation. Celebrity endorsements include Richard Branson, Anthony Hopkins, Ashton Kutcher, Ellen DeGeneres, Nikki Glaser, Chrissie Hynde, Michael McIntyre, Pink, Jason Mraz, Charlotte Church and Hrithik Roshan which aids the organisation&#x27;s efforts to expand commercially.

Allen Carr&#x27;s Clinics are run by facilitators who were once smokers and have used Carr&#x27;s method to stop smoking. All therapists/facilitators are members of an association created by Allen Carr&#x27;s Easyway organisation, Members of the Association of Allen Carr Therapists International (MAACTI), and membership indicates that the therapist/facilitator has completed the rigorous recruitment, and the comprehensive training &amp; development process required before anyone can practise as an Allen Carr&#x27;s Easyway therapist/facilitator. They can only do so under license with Allen Carr&#x27;s Easyway (International) Ltd or Allen Carr&#x27;s Easyway (US) Ltd.

Carr also wrote a number of other how-to books on subjects such as losing weight, stopping alcohol consumption, and overcoming the fear of flying. Along with his close friends, protégés, &amp; co-authors Robin Hayley (chairman, Allen Carr&#x27;s Easyway) &amp; John C. Dicey (Global CEO &amp; Senior Allen Carr&#x27;s Easyway Therapist), he wrote books dealing with gambling, debt/junk-spending, sugar addiction, emotional eating, mindfulness, tech/smartphone addiction, caffeine addiction, vaping/JUUL with Online Video Programmes handling smoking, vaping/JUUL, alcohol, cocaine, cannabis, sugar &amp; carb addiction, emotional eating, gambling, caffeine addiction, fear of flying, and mindfulness. In 2020, it was estimated that Allen Carr&#x27;s Easyway method had helped more than 50 million people worldwide. 
In 2021, Allen Carr&#x27;s Easyway assisted the World Health Organisation&#x27;s year-long global campaign for World No Tobacco Day 2021.

==Illness and death==
In 2006, Carr was diagnosed with lung cancer at age 71. His spokesman stated that this may not have been linked to his historical smoking habit, as he had been around smokers, and therefore exposed to their second-hand smoke, while treating them for their addiction. He had stated in his book &quot;The easy way to control alcohol&quot; chapter 16 that he was a chain-smoker for most of his adult life. The following month, Carr revealed that his lung cancer was terminal and that his life expectancy was about nine months. Carr said: &quot;Since I smoked my final cigarette, 23 years ago, I have been the happiest man in the world. I still feel the same way today.” Carr wrote to the then British Prime Minister Tony Blair, urging the UK Government and NHS to accept his method, saying that the &quot;powerful influence&quot; of lobbyists working for nicotine replacement firms had turned them against him.
Carr died from lung cancer at his home in Benalmádena, west of Málaga, Spain, on 29 November 2006. He was 72 years old.

Carr worked closely with and passed responsibility for continuing his work, developing the method to cover as many addictions and issues as possible, to his close friends and long-time collaborators Robin Hayley &amp; John C. Dicey (Chairman &amp; Global CEO of Allen Carr&#x27;s Easyway respectively). On the insistence of international publishers, John C. Dicey reluctantly allows himself to be described as co-author of Allen Carr books but makes it very clear, &quot;I take great pleasure in deflecting any praise for the books (quite rightly so) to Allen Carr. I was extremely lucky to have worked so closely with him since 1998 and was honoured that he asked me to carry on his work&quot;.

<doc id="878769" wikidata="Q3795398" url="?curid=878769" title="The Nun's Priest's Tale">
<text>&quot;The Nun&#x27;s Priest&#x27;s Tale&quot; (Middle English: &quot;The Nonnes Preestes Tale of the Cok and Hen, Chauntecleer and Pertelote&quot;) is one of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; by the Middle English poet Geoffrey Chaucer. Composed in the 1390s, it is a beast fable and mock epic based on an incident in the Reynard cycle. The story of Chanticleer and the Fox became further popularised in Britain through this means.

==The tale and framing narrative==
The narrative of 695-lines includes a prologue and an epilogue. The prologue links the story with the previous Monk&#x27;s Tale, a series of short accounts of toppled despots, criminals and fallen heroes, which prompts an interruption from the knight. The host upholds the knight&#x27;s complaint and orders the monk to change his story. The monk refuses, saying he has &quot;no lust to pleye,&quot; and so the Host calls on the Nun&#x27;s Priest to give the next tale. There is no substantial depiction of this character in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;General Prologue&quot;, but in the tale&#x27;s epilogue the Host is moved to give a highly approving portrait which highlights his great physical strength and presence.

The fable concerns a world of talking animals who reflect both human perception and fallacy. Its protagonist is Chauntecleer, a proud cock (rooster) who dreams of his approaching doom in the form of a fox. Frightened, he awakens Pertelote, the chief favourite among his seven wives. She assures him that he only suffers from indigestion and chides him for paying heed to a simple dream. Chauntecleer recounts stories of prophets who foresaw their deaths, dreams that came true, and dreams that were more profound (for instance, Cicero&#x27;s account of the &quot;Dream of Scipio&quot;). Chauntecleer is comforted and proceeds to greet a new day. Unfortunately for Chauntecleer, his own dream was also correct. &quot;A col-fox, ful of sly iniquitee&quot; (line 3215), who had previously tricked Chauntecleer&#x27;s father and mother to their downfall, lies in wait for him in a bed of &quot;wortes.&quot;
When Chauntecleer spots this &quot;daun Russell (line 3334)&quot;, the fox plays to his prey&#x27;s inflated ego and overcomes the cock&#x27;s instinct to escape by insisting he would love to hear Chauntecleer crow just as his amazing father did, standing on tiptoe with neck outstretched and eyes closed. When the cock does so, he is promptly snatched from the yard in the fox&#x27;s jaws and slung over his back. As the fox flees through the forest, with the entire barnyard giving chase, the captured Chauntecleer suggests that he should pause to tell his pursuers to give up. The predator&#x27;s own pride is now his undoing: as the fox opens his mouth to taunt his pursuers, Chauntecleer escapes from his jaws and flies into the nearest tree. The fox tries in vain to convince the wary rooster of his repentance; it now prefers the safety of the tree and refuses to fall for the same trick a second time.

The Nun&#x27;s Priest is characterised by the way that he elaborates his slender tale with epic parallels drawn from ancient history and chivalry, giving a display of learning which, in the context of the story and its cast, can only be comic and ironic. But in contrast, the description of the poor widow and the chicken yard of her country cottage with which the tale opens is true to life and has been quoted as authentic in discussions of the living conditions of the mediaeval peasant. By way of conclusion, the Nun&#x27;s Priest goes on to reconcile the sophistication of his courtly performance with the simplicity of the tale within the framing narrative by admonishing the audience to be careful of reckless decisions and of &quot;truste on flaterye.&quot;

==Adaptations==
Robert Henryson used Chaucer&#x27;s tale as a source for his &quot;Taill of Schir Chanticleir and the Foxe&quot;, the third poem in his &quot;Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian&quot;, composed in or around the 1480s. Later, the poet John Dryden adapted the tale into more comprehensible modern language under the title of &quot;The Cock and the Fox&quot; (1700). In 2007, the playwright Dougie Blaxland wrote a comic verse play &quot;Chauntecleer and Pertelotte&quot;, roughly based on the &quot;Nun&#x27;s Priest&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

Barbara Cooney&#x27;s adaptation for children with her own illustrations, &quot;Chanticleer and the Fox&quot;, won the Caldecott Medal in 1959. Another illustrated edition of the tale won the 1992 Kerlan Award. This was &quot;Chanticleer and the Fox – A Chaucerian Tale&quot; (1991), written by Fulton Roberts with Marc Davis&#x27; drawings for a Disney cartoon that was never completed.

Among musical settings have been Gordon Jacob&#x27;s &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Priest&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1951) and the similarly titled choral setting by Ross Lee Finney. Another American adaptation was Seymour Barab&#x27;s comic opera &quot;Chanticleer&quot;. In the UK Michael Hurd set the tale as &quot;Rooster Rag&quot;, a pop cantata for children (1976).

A full-length musical stage adaptation of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, composed of the Prologue, Epilogue, &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Priest&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and four other tales, was presented at the Phoenix Theatre, London on 21 March 1968, with music by Richard Hill &amp; John Hawkins, lyrics by Nevill Coghill, and original concept, book, and direction by Martin Starkie. The &quot;Nun&#x27;s Priest&#x27;s Tale&quot; section was excluded from the original 1969 Broadway production, though reinstated in the 1970 US tour.

<doc id="878795" wikidata="Q6900412" url="?curid=878795" title="Kappiya">
<text>Kappiya is a Buddhist lay manciple (attendant or steward) who resides in a monastery (vihāra) and assists Buddhist monks (bhikkhu in Pali). 

== Names ==
The term kappiya, which literally means &quot;lawful&quot; or &quot;proper,&quot; is of Pali origin, and is also employed in the Burmese language (). The compound word kappiyakāraka () is also used in Pali. In Thailand, the terms luuk sit wat (ลูกศิษย์วัด) and dek wat (เด็กวัด), commonly rendered into English as &quot;temple boy&quot;, are typically used. In Cambodia, the term khmeng voat (ក្មេងវត្ត) is used.

== Roles ==
The &quot;kappiya&quot;&#x27;s primary role is to assist ordained Buddhist monks with various tasks, especially those which are forbidden by the Vinaya, the set of Buddhist monastic rules (e.g., handling of money). A &quot;kappiya&quot; is not ordained, unlike bhikkhu, bhikkhunī, sāmaṇera or sāmaṇerī. &quot;Kappiya&quot; may also assist in other capacities, including carrying alms bowls during morning alms collection, and preparing food for monks.

== Regional differences ==

=== Myanmar (Burma) ===
In Myanmar (Burma), &quot;kappiya&quot; are generally young men or boys who live in the monastery they support. Some female renunciants called &quot;kappiya thilashin&quot; also serve as lay attendants to monastic institutions (&quot;kyaung&quot;), providing support to ordained monks as managers and treasurers, entrusted with the ongoing upkeep of monasteries.

=== Thailand ===
In Thailand, &quot;kappiya&quot; are typically young boys (typically between the ages of 10 and 15) who are affiliated with temples (wat) and provide cleaning services, run errands and collect gifts in exchange for food, lodging, instruction, and other benefits. Some are sent to become temple boys to acquire merit; others, because they are given free room and board; and others to receive religious and moral instruction. Some temple boys go on to be ordained as monks themselves. Temple boys may undertake the formal step of sāmaṇera ordination as part of their role, depending on their age and local custom. Historically speaking, serving as a temple boy has provided a means for social mobility; notable figures including politicians (Chuan Leekpai and Watana Muangsook) and actors (e.g., Rangsiroj Panpeng) spent their formative years in this role.

<doc id="878801" wikidata="Q2414052" url="?curid=878801" title="San Francisco Bay Guardian">
<text>The San Francisco Bay Guardian was a free alternative newspaper published weekly in San Francisco, California. The paper was shut down on October 14, 2014. Parts of the paper were relaunched online in February 2016.

== History ==
The &quot;Bay Guardian&quot; was founded in 1966 by Bruce B. Brugmann and his wife, Jean Dibble. It was known for reporting, celebrating, and promoting left-wing and progressive issues within San Francisco and (albeit rarely) around the San Francisco Bay Area as a whole. This usually included muckraking, legislation to control and limit gentrification, and endorsement of political candidates and other laws and policies that fall within its political views. The &quot;Bay Guardian&quot; handed out &quot;Goldie Awards&quot; annually for excellence in the arts and similar areas.

It also printed movie and music reviews, an annual nude beaches issue, and an annual sex issue. The &quot;Bay Guardian&quot; was one of several alternative newspapers in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, including &quot;SF Weekly&quot; (formerly its major competitor, now under the same ownership), &quot;East Bay Express&quot;, &quot;Metro Silicon Valley&quot;, &quot;North Bay Bohemian&quot;, Marin&#x27;s &quot;Pacific Sun&quot;, and &quot;Berkeley Daily Planet&quot;.

In 1971, it published &quot;The Ultimate Highrise&quot;, on the costs of development to the city. In 1975, it published &quot;San Francisco Free &amp; Easy: The Native&#x27;s Guidebook&quot; with a revised edition in 1980, edited by William Ristow.

=== 1970s unionization attempt ===
The &quot;Bay Guardian&quot; put down an attempt by its employees to unionize in the 1970s. In 1975, &quot;Bay Guardian&quot; staffers, with the aid of Newspaper Guild Local 52 and International Typographical Union Local 21, signed union cards to seek higher wages and benefits. The paper had previously won a legal settlement and moved to a new building. Nevertheless, publisher Bruce Brugmann claimed there were not enough funds to increase pay or benefits. The day after Thanksgiving, he fired five senior staffers who had helped organize the union effort. Newspaper staffers voted to join the Newspaper Guild and, on June 15, 1976, they called a strike to force Brugmann to offer a labor contract. Brugmann retained a few management staff and hired strikebreaker replacements. In August, César Chávez offered to mediate the strike, but Brugmann refused. Finally, in 1977, another election was called, but this time votes by replacement workers carried the day and the new staff voted not to join a union.

=== Best of the Bay ===
Starting in 1974, the &quot;Bay Guardian&quot; published an annual &quot;Best of The Bay&quot; issue that listed the best restaurants, business, and activities in the Bay Area, based on a readers&#x27; poll and staff recommendations. The &quot;Bay Guardian&quot; claimed that its &quot;Best Of&quot; issue was the first annual guide of its kind and was copied by other publications.

=== Lawsuit against &quot;SF Weekly&quot; ===
In March 2008, the &quot;Bay Guardian&quot; won a predatory pricing lawsuit against its local rival, &quot;SF Weekly&quot;, based on allegations that &quot;SF Weekly&quot; undercut the &quot;Bay Guardian&quot; by selling display advertisements below cost while supporting itself on cash infusions from its parent, Village Voice Media, in an effort to force the &quot;Bay Guardian&quot; into bankruptcy. In May 2008 the judge in the case awarded punitive damages, raising the jury&#x27;s $6.3 million award to $15.9 million, and issuing an injunction prohibiting the &quot;SF Weekly&quot; from selling advertisements below cost.

=== Sale ===
On April 19, 2012, the &quot;East Bay Express&quot; reported that the Canadian owners of &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; were in negotiations with the &quot;Bay Guardian&quot; to buy the newspaper. These rumors were initially denied by its executive editor Tim Redmond, but the sale went through a week later.

On January 15, 2013, their longstanding rival &quot;SF Weekly&quot; was sold to the San Francisco Newspaper Group, which publishes the &quot;Bay Guardian&quot;.

=== Shutdown and aftermath ===
In mid-June 2013, &quot;San Francisco Business Times&quot; and other publications reported that Tim Redmond had &quot;been ousted&quot; as publisher and editor. The &quot;Bay Guardian&quot; issued a statement quoting new publisher Stephen Buel as saying, &quot;The &quot;Guardian&quot; has been losing money, and we were forced to contemplate some editorial layoffs. Tim decided to resign rather than follow through with what we were discussing.&quot; However, Redmond denied resigning.

On October 14, 2014, publisher Glenn Zuehls announced that the San Francisco Media Co., which also owns &quot;SF Weekly&quot;, had decided to close the publication. The 40th annual Best of the Bay issue, published on the same day, was the weekly publication&#x27;s final issue. 

Following the &quot;Bay Guardian&quot;″s closure, its laid-off staff launched the &quot;Bay Guardian&quot;-in-Exile Project, which included a fundraising campaign on Indiegogo that raised more than $25,000 to help preserve the paper&#x27;s archives and produce a final commemorative edition of the &quot;Bay Guardian&quot;, which was released on Jan. 22, 2015 and distributed in conjunction with the San Francisco Public Press and Gum Road.

In October 2015, the Bay Guardian&#x27;s print and digital archives were handed over to the San Francisco Center for Newspaper Preservation, a newly founded nonprofit organization led by Marke Bieschke (the paper&#x27;s former publisher) and Tim Redmond. In January 2016, they announced that a &quot;Bring Back the Bay Guardian&quot; crowdfunding campaign and other donations had yielded enough funds to secure the archives and relaunch several &quot;Bay Guardian&quot; features, included &quot;Best of the Bay&quot;. 

With Bieschke, Redmond now publishes &quot;48 Hills&quot;, a separate site focusing on San Francisco politics that Redmond founded in 2014 after leaving the &quot;Bay Guardian&quot;.
