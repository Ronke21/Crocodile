<text>Blackstone Inc. is an American alternative investment management company based in New York City. It was founded in 1985 as a mergers and acquisitions firm by Peter Peterson and Stephen Schwarzman, who had previously worked together at Lehman Brothers. Blackstone&#x27;s private equity business has been one of the largest investors in leveraged buyouts in the last three decades, while its real estate business has actively acquired commercial real estate across the globe. Blackstone is also active in credit, infrastructure, hedge funds, secondaries, growth equity, and insurance solutions. As of May 2024, Blackstone has more than US$1 trillion in total assets under management, making it the world&#x27;s largest alternative investment firm.

== History ==
=== Founding and early history ===
Blackstone was founded in 1985 by Peter G. Peterson and Stephen A. Schwarzman with (equivalent to $million in ) in seed capital. The founders derived their firm&#x27;s name from their names: &quot;Schwarz&quot; is German for &quot;black&quot;; &quot;Peter&quot;, &quot;petros&quot; (, masculine), or &quot;petra&quot; (, feminine) means &quot;stone&quot; or &quot;rock&quot; in Greek. The two founders had previously worked together at Lehman Brothers. There, Schwarzman served as head of global mergers and acquisitions business. Prominent investment banker Roger C. Altman, another Lehman veteran, left his position as a managing director of Lehman Brothers to join Peterson and Schwarzman at Blackstone in 1987, but left in 1992 to join the Clinton administration as Deputy Treasury Secretary and later founded advisory investment bank Evercore Partners in 1995.

Blackstone was originally formed as a mergers and acquisitions advisory boutique. It advised on the 1987 merger of investment banks E. F. Hutton &amp; Co. and Shearson Lehman Brothers, collecting a $3.5 million fee.
From the outset in 1985, Schwarzman and Peterson planned to enter the private equity business but had difficulty in raising their first fund because neither had ever led a leveraged buyout. Blackstone finalized fundraising for its first private equity fund in the aftermath of Black Monday, the October 1987 global stock market crash. After two years of providing strictly advisory services, Blackstone decided to pursue a merchant banking model after its founders determined that many situations required an investment partner rather than just an advisor. The largest investors in the first fund included Prudential Insurance Company, Nikko Securities and the General Motors pension fund.

Blackstone also ventured into other businesses, most notably investment management. In 1987 Blackstone entered into a 50–50 partnership with the founders of BlackRock, Larry Fink (current CEO of BlackRock), and Ralph Schlosstein (CEO of Evercore). The two founders, who had previously run the mortgage-backed securities divisions at First Boston and Lehman Brothers, respectively, initially joined Blackstone to manage an investment fund and provide advice to financial institutions. They also planned to use a Blackstone fund to invest in financial institutions and help build an asset management business specializing in fixed income investments.

As the business grew, Japanese bank Nikko Securities acquired a 20% interest in Blackstone for a $100 million investment in 1988 (valuing the firm at $500 million). Nikko&#x27;s investment allowed for a major expansion of the firm and its investment activities. The growth firm also recruited politician and investment banker David Stockman from Salomon Brothers in 1988. Stockman led many key deals in his time at the firm but had a mixed record with his investments. He left Blackstone in 1999 to start his own private equity firm, Heartland Industrial Partners, based in Greenwich, Connecticut.

The firm advised CBS Corporation on its 1988 sale of CBS Records to Sony to form what would become Sony Music Entertainment. In June 1989, Blackstone acquired freight railroad operator CNW Corporation. That same year, Blackstone partnered with Salomon Brothers to raise $600 million to acquire distressed thrifts in the midst of the savings and loan crisis.

=== 1990s ===
In 1990, Blackstone launched its hedge funds business, initially intended to manage investments for Blackstone senior management. That same year, Blackstone formed a partnership with J. O. Hambro Magan in the UK and Indosuez in France. Additionally, Blackstone and Silverman acquired a 65% interest in Prime Motor Inn&#x27;s Ramada and Howard Johnson franchises for $140 million, creating Hospitality Franchise Systems as a holding company.

In 1991, Blackstone created its Europe unit and launched its real estate investment business with the acquisition of a series of hotel businesses under the leadership of Henry Silverman. In October 1991, Blackstone and Silverman added Days Inns of America for $250 million. In 1993, Hospitality Franchise Systems acquired Super 8 Motels for $125 million. Silverman would ultimately leave Blackstone to serve as CEO of HFS, which later became Cendant Corporation.

Blackstone made a number of notable investments in the early and mid-1990s, including Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company (1991), Six Flags (1991), US Radio (1994), Centerplate (1995), MEGA Brands (1996). Also, in 1996, Blackstone partnered with the Loewen Group, the second-largest funeral home and cemetery operator in North America, to acquire funeral home and cemetery businesses. The partnership&#x27;s first acquisition was a $295 million buyout of Prime Succession from GTCR.

In 1995, Blackstone sold its stake in BlackRock to PNC Financial Services for $250 million. Between 1995 and 2014, PNC reported $12 billion in pretax revenues and capital gains from BlackRock. Schwarzman later described the selling of BlackRock as his worst business decision ever.

In 1997, Blackstone completed fundraising for its third private equity fund, with approximately $4 billion of investor commitments and a $1.1 billion real estate investment fund. Also in 1997, Blackstone made its first investment in Allied Waste. In 1998, Blackstone sold a 7% interest in its management company to AIG, valuing Blackstone at $2.1 billion. In 1999, Blackstone partnered with Apollo Management to provide capital for Allied Waste&#x27;s acquisition of Browning-Ferris Industries. Blackstone&#x27;s investment in Allied was one of its largest at that point in the firm&#x27;s history.

In 1999, Blackstone launched its mezzanine capital business. It brought in five professionals, led by Howard Gellis from Nomura Holding America&#x27;s Leveraged Capital Group, to manage the business.

Blackstone&#x27;s investments in the late 1990s included AMF Group (1996), Haynes International (1997), American Axle (1997), Premcor (1997), CommNet Cellular (1998), Graham Packaging (1998), Centennial Communications (1999), Bresnan Communications (1999), and PAETEC Holding Corp. (1999). Haynes and Republic Technologies International both had problems and ultimately filed bankruptcy.

Blackstone&#x27;s investments in telecommunications businesses—four cable TV systems in rural areas (TW Fanch 1 and 2, Bresnan Communications and Intermedia Partners IV) and a cell phone operator in the Rocky Mountain states (CommNet Cellular) were among the most successful of the era, generating $1.5 billion of profits for Blackstone&#x27;s funds.

Blackstone Real Estate Advisers, its real estate affiliate, bought the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. in July 1998 for $39 million and sold it to Monument Realty in August 2004.

=== Early 2000s ===
In October 2000, Blackstone acquired the mortgage for 7 World Trade Center from the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association.
In July 2002, Blackstone completed fundraising for a $6.45 billion private equity fund, Blackstone Capital Partners IV, the largest private equity fund at that time.

With a significant amount of capital in its new fund, Blackstone was one of a handful of private equity investors capable of completing large transactions in the adverse conditions of the early 2000s recession. At the end of 2002, Blackstone, together with Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain Capital, acquired Houghton Mifflin Company for $1.28 billion. The transaction represented one of the first large club deals completed since the collapse of the Dot-com bubble.

In 2002, Hamilton E. James joined Blackstone, where he serves as president and chief operating officer. He also serves on the firm&#x27;s executive and management committees, and its board of directors. In late 2002, Blackstone acquired TRW Automotive in a $4.7 billion buyout, the largest private equity deal announced that year (the deal was completed in early 2003). TRW&#x27;s parent was acquired by Northrop Grumman, while Blackstone purchased its automotive parts business, a major supplier of automotive systems. Blackstone also purchased a majority interest in Columbia House, a music-buying club, in mid-2002.

Blackstone made a significant investment in Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), a monoline bond insurer alongside PMI Group, The Cypress Group and CIVC Partners. FGIC incurred heavy losses, along with other bond insurers in the 2008 credit crisis.

Two years later, in 2005, Blackstone was one of seven private equity firms involved in the buyout of SunGard in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. Blackstone&#x27;s partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco at the end of the 1980s leveraged buyout boom. Also, at the time of its announcement, SunGard was the largest buyout of a technology company in history, a distinction it ceded to the buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction is also notable for the number of firms involved, the largest club deal completed to that point. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered crossholdings among firms to be generally unattractive.

In 2006, Blackstone launched its long/short equity hedge fund business, Kailix Advisors. According to Blackstone, as of September 30, 2008, Kailix Advisors had $1.9 billion of assets under management. In December 2008, Blackstone announced that Kailix would be spun off to its management team to form a new fund as an independent entity backed by Blackstone.

While Blackstone was active on the corporate investment side, it was also busy pursuing real estate investments. Blackstone acquired Prime Hospitality and Extended Stay America in 2004. Blackstone followed these investments with the acquisition of La Quinta Inns &amp; Suites in 2005. Blackstone&#x27;s largest transaction, the $26 billion buyout of Hilton Hotels Corporation, occurred in 2007 under the tenure of Hilton CFO Stephen Bollenbach. Extended Stay Hotels was sold to The Lightstone Group in July 2007 and Prime Hospitality&#x27;s Wellesley Inns were folded into La Quinta. La Quinta Inns &amp; Suites was spun out for IPO in 2014 and later acquired by Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts.

=== Buyouts (2005–2007) ===
During the buyout boom of 2006 and 2007, Blackstone completed some of the largest leveraged buyouts. Its most notable transactions during this period included:

=== Initial public offering in 2007 ===
In 2004, Blackstone had explored the possibility of creating a business development company (BDC), Blackridge Investments, similar to vehicles pursued by Apollo Management. Blackstone failed to raise capital through an initial public offering that summer and the project were shelved. It also planned to raise a fund on the Amsterdam stock exchange in 2006, but its rival, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., launched a $5 billion fund there that soaked up all demand for such funds, and Blackstone abandoned its project.

In 2007, Blackstone acquired Alliant Insurance Services, an insurance brokerage firm. The company was sold to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 2012.

On June 21, 2007, Blackstone became a public company via an initial public offering, selling a 12.3% stake in the company for $4.13 billion, in the largest U.S. IPO since 2002.

=== 2008 to 2010 ===
During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, Blackstone closed only a few transactions. In January 2008, Blackstone made a small co-investment alongside TPG Capital and Apollo Management in their buyout of Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment, although that transaction had been announced during the buyout boom period. Other notable investments that Blackstone completed in 2008 and 2009 included AlliedBarton, Performance Food Group, Apria Healthcare, and CMS Computers.

In July 2008, Blackstone, NBC Universal, and Bain Capital acquired The Weather Channel from Landmark Communications for $3.5 billion. In 2015, the digital assets were sold to IBM for $2 billion. In 2018, the remainder of the company was sold to Byron Allen for $300 million.

In December 2009, Blackstone acquired Busch Entertainment Corporation from Anheuser-Busch InBev for $2.9 billion.

In November 2013, Merlin Entertainments, owned in part by Blackstone Group, became a public company via an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange.

== Recent exits ==

=== Hotel Investment Partners ===

In October 2023, Blackstone divested its stake in the Spanish hotel conglomerate Hotel Investment Partners (HIP) to the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC. As part of the agreement, GIC secured a 35% stake in HIP, with the deal establishing a valuation exceeding €4 billion for the company.

=== Embassy Office Parks ===
In December 2023, Blackstone announced its intention to divest its entire 23.59% stake, valued at $833 million, in Embassy Office Parks, India&#x27;s largest real estate investment trust. The decision came four years after the initial listing of the REIT, as revealed in a term sheet disclosed by Reuters.

== Operations ==
Blackstone operates through four primary departments: private equity; real estate; hedge funds; and credit.

=== Corporate private equity ===

, Blackstone was the world&#x27;s largest private equity firm by capital commitments as ranked by Private Equity International&#x27;s PEI 300 ranking. After dropping to second behind KKR in the 2022 ranking, it regained the top spot in 2023, and retained it in 2024. The firm invests through minority investments, corporate partnerships, and industry consolidations, and occasionally start-up investments. The firm focuses on friendly investments in large capitalization companies.

Blackstone has primarily relied on private equity funds, pools of committed capital from pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, fund of funds, high-net-worth individuals, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors. From 1987 to its IPO in 2007, Blackstone invested approximately $20 billion in 109 private equity transactions.

Blackstone&#x27;s most notable investments include Allied Waste, AlliedBarton Security Services, Graham Packaging, Celanese, Nalco, HealthMarkets, Houghton Mifflin, American Axle, TRW Automotive, Catalent Pharma Solutions, Prime Hospitality, Legoland, Madame Tussauds, Luxury Resorts (LXR), Pinnacle Foods, Hilton Hotels Corporation, Motel 6, Apria Healthcare, Travelport, The Weather Channel (United States) and The PortAventura Resort. In 2009, Blackstone purchased Busch Entertainment (comprising the Sea World Parks, Busch Garden Parks and the two water parks). In 2020 it acquired Ancestry.com.

In 2012, Blackstone acquired a controlling interest in Utah-based Vivint, Inc., a home automation, security, and energy company.

=== Real estate ===

Blackstone&#x27;s most notable real estate investments have included QTS, EQ Office, Hilton Worldwide, Trizec Properties, Center Parcs UK, La Quinta Inns &amp; Suites, Motel 6, Wyndham Worldwide, Southern Cross Healthcare and Vicinity Centres.

The purchase and subsequent IPO of Southern Cross led to controversy in the UK. Part of the purchase involved splitting the business into a property company, NHP, and a nursing home business, which Blackstone claimed would become &quot;the leading company in the elderly care market&quot;. In May 2011, Southern Cross, now independent, was almost bankrupt, jeopardizing 31,000 elderly residents in 750 care homes. It denied blame, although Blackstone was widely accused in the media for selling on the company with an unsustainable business model and crippled with an impossible sale and leaseback strategy.

After the 2007–2010 subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, Blackstone Group LP bought more than $5.5 billion worth of single-family homes to rent, and then be sold when the prices rise.

In 2014, Blackstone sold Northern California office buildings for $3.5 billion. The buildings sold in San Francisco and Silicon Valley included 26 office buildings and two development parcels.

In 2018, a critique was raised regarding a purchase agreement on several hundred apartments in Frederiksberg, Denmark, between Blackstone&#x27;s Danish partner North 360 and Frederiksberg Boligfond, a nonprofit housing organization Frederiksberg Municipality established in 1930. After resistance by residents and questions about the purchase agreement&#x27;s legality, Blackstone withdrew from it in October 2019.

On December 1, 2022, Blackstone restricted withdrawals from its $125 billion real estate investment fund BREIT (Blackstone Real Estate Investment Trust) due to a surge in redemption requests from investors. The move caused investor consternation and limited the ability to attract new capital for BREIT.

In November 2024, Blackstone acquired a group of four retail buildings in Soho for approximately $200 million from ASB Real Estate Investments. This transaction marked the largest Manhattan retail deal by an investor in over three years, signaling a resurgence in the retail asset class. The properties, which house tenants such as Patagonia and Amiri, were purchased with the strategy of increasing revenue by bringing below-market leases up to current rates. The deal included buildings at 61 Crosby Street, 72-76 Greene Street, 465 Broadway, and 415 West Broadway.

=== Marketable alternative asset management ===
In 1990, Blackstone created a fund of hedge funds business to manage internal assets for Blackstone and its senior managers. This business evolved into Blackstone&#x27;s marketable alternative asset management segment, which was opened to institutional investors. Among the investments included in this segment are funds of hedge funds, mezzanine funds, senior debt vehicles, proprietary hedge funds and closed-end mutual funds.

In March 2008, Blackstone acquired GSO Capital Partners, a credit-oriented alternative asset manager, for $620 million in cash and stock and up to $310 million through an earnout over the next five years based on earnings targets. The combined entity created one of the largest credit platforms in the alternative asset management business, with over $21 billion under management. GSO was founded in 2005 by Bennett Goodman, Tripp Smith, and Doug Ostrover. The GSO team had previously managed the leveraged finance businesses at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette and later Credit Suisse First Boston, after it acquired DLJ. Blackstone was an original investor in GSO&#x27;s funds. After the acquisition, Blackstone merged GSO&#x27;s operations with its existing debt investment operations.

== Controversies ==
=== Warrantless disclosure of Motel 6 occupancies ===
In separate cases in 2018 and 2019, the hotel chain Motel 6, owned by Blackstone, agreed to settle for a total of $19.6 million for giving guest lists to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) without a warrant.

=== Ancestry acquisition and data leaks ===
In 2020, Blackstone acquired a majority stake in Ancestry.com, which controls access to millions of people&#x27;s genetic data, heightening concern about Blackstone&#x27;s data privacy practices. This data was disclosed to Blackstone, and it has aggressively defended itself against class action litigation relating to misuse of the data of people who did not consent to genetic testing but were affected through direct biological relations or other means of identification.

=== Illegal child labor ===
An investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor showed that more than 100 American children had been working illegally for Packers Sanitation Services Inc. (PSSI), a slaughterhouse cleaning firm owned by Blackstone. The investigation began after a Walnut Middle School teacher in Grand Island, Nebraska, reported a student with hydrochloric acid burns on his hands and knees to the Department of Labor. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Labor Department fined PSSI $15,138 by for each minor who was employed in breach of the law, totaling $1.5 million in civil money penalties.

=== Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest ===
The company has invested in companies with links to the commercialization and deforestation of the Amazon rainforest.

<doc id="885070" wikidata="Q552465" url="?curid=885070" title="Stephen A. Schwarzman">
<text>Stephen Allen Schwarzman (born February 14, 1947) is an American businessman. He is the chairman and CEO of the Blackstone Group, a global private equity firm he established in 1985 with Peter G. Peterson. Schwarzman was chairman of President Donald Trump&#x27;s Strategic and Policy Forum.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Schwarzman has a net worth of $53.3 billion as of November 2024.

==Early life and education==
Schwarzman was raised in a Jewish family in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, the son of Arline and Joseph Schwarzman. His father owned Schwarzman&#x27;s, a former dry-goods store in Philadelphia, and was a graduate of the Wharton School.

Schwarzman&#x27;s first business was a lawn-mowing operation when he was 14 years old, employing his younger twin brothers, Mark and Warren, to mow while Stephen brought in clients.

Schwarzman attended the Abington School District in suburban Philadelphia and graduated from Abington Senior High School in 1965. He attended Yale University, where he was a member of senior society Skull and Bones and founded the Davenport Ballet Society. After graduating in 1969, he briefly served in the U.S. Army Reserve before attending Harvard Business School, where he graduated in 1972.

==Investment career==
Schwarzman&#x27;s first job in financial services was with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, an investment bank that merged with Credit Suisse in 2000. After business school, Schwarzman worked at the investment bank Lehman Brothers, became a managing director at age 31, and then head of global mergers and acquisitions. In 1985, Schwarzman and his boss, Peter Peterson, started The Blackstone Group, which initially focused on mergers and acquisitions. Blackstone branched into business acquisition, real estate, direct lending, alternative assets, and had $1.1 trillion in assets under management as of September 30, 2024.

When Blackstone went public in June 2007, it revealed in a securities filing that Schwarzman had earned about $398.3 million in fiscal 2006. He ultimately received $684 million for the part of his Blackstone stake he sold in the IPO, keeping a stake then worth $9.1 billion. In the following years, his compensations increased even more: he received $350 million in 2007 and $702.4 million in 2008—partly due to stock awards. His salary was $734.2 million in 2015, $425 US million in 2016 and $786 US million in 2017. In 2022, he was paid $253 million, making him the highest paid CEO in the US that year.

In June 2007, Schwarzman described his view on financial markets with the statement: &quot;I want war, not a series of skirmishes ... I always think about what will kill off the other bidder.&quot;

In September 2011, Schwarzman was listed as a member of the international advisory board of the Russian Direct Investment Fund.

== Political and economic views ==
Schwarzman is a Republican who favors lower taxes, lower government spending, and reproductive rights.

He raised $100,000 for George W. Bush&#x27;s political endeavors.

In August 2010, Schwarzman compared the Obama administration&#x27;s plan to raise the tax rate on carried interest to a war and Hitler&#x27;s invasion of Poland in 1939, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s a war. It&#x27;s like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939.&quot; Schwarzman later apologized for the analogy. In 2012, Obama called Schwarzman and requested his assistance in brokering a budget agreement with Republicans in congress to avoid a fiscal cliff. Eventually a deal was brokered with Schwarzman&#x27;s help. The new tax plan added $1 trillion of additional revenue by raising taxes, closing tax loopholes, and ending deductions. Obama later drafted a formal message of support for Schwarzman Scholars, an education initiative undertaken by Schwarzman.

He endorsed and fundraised for Mitt Romney in 2012. During the 2016 Republican primary, he declined to support any one particular candidate. He identified as center-right and said the eventual GOP nominee should appeal to independent voters, not the right wing of the Republican Party. At the same time, he had positive things to say about Hillary Clinton.

In early 2016, he said that in a two-candidate race he would prefer Donald Trump to Ted Cruz, saying that the nation needed a &quot;cohesive, healing presidency, not one that&#x27;s lurching either to the right or to the left.&quot; He had previously made a donation to Marco Rubio in 2014.

In late 2016, Schwarzman &quot;helped put together&quot; a team of corporate executives to advise Trump on jobs and the economy. The group, which includes JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, Walt Disney boss Bob Iger and former General Electric leader Jack Welch, became Trump&#x27;s Strategic and Policy Forum. In February, Schwarzman was named as chair of the 16-member President&#x27;s Strategic and Policy Forum, which brought together &quot;CEOs of America&#x27;s biggest corporations, banks and investment firms&quot; to consult with the president on &quot;how to create jobs and improve growth for the U.S. economy.&quot; On August 16, 2017, following five members&#x27; resignations, President Trump announced via Twitter he was disbanding the forum.

He is a longtime friend of president Donald Trump and provides outside counsel, and served as chair of Trump&#x27;s Strategic and Policy Forum. In response to criticism for his involvement with the Trump administration, Schwarzman penned a letter to current Schwarzman Scholars, arguing that &quot;having influence and providing sound advice is a good thing, even if it attracts criticism or requires some sacrifice”.

In December 2018, non-profit consumer advocacy organisation Public Citizen published a report titled: Self-Funded&#x27; Trump Now Propped Up By Super PAC Megadonors.&quot; The report disclosed that Schwarzman donated $344,000 in support of Trump&#x27;s re-election campaign. Following his election, Trump appointed Schwarzman as the chairman of the White House Strategic and Policy Forum.

In 2020, Schwarzman donated $15 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, a super-PAC tied to Mitch McConnell, $3 million to Donald Trump&#x27;s America First Action PAC, and a combined total for the election cycle of $33.5 million to Republican candidates. Several of the Republicans he funded voted against certifying the 2020 Presidential Election.

In private, Schwarzman called the January 6 United States Capitol attack an &quot;insurrection&quot; and &quot;an affront to the democratic values we hold dear&quot;. However, he stopped short of criticizing Trump over the riot.

In 2022, Schwarzman indicated that he would not support the Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign, providing in a statement to &quot;Axios&quot; that it was &quot;time for the Republican Party to turn to a new generation of leaders.&quot; In 2024, Schwarzman announced that he would support Donald Trump as a &quot;vote for change&quot;.

==Wealth==

According to &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot;, he had a net worth of $32 billion as of October 2022. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Schwarzman has a net worth of $39 billion, as of April 2024.

In 2014 and 2016, Schwarzman was named as one of Bloomberg&#x27;s 50 Most Influential people of the year.

==Philanthropy==
In 2004, Schwarzman donated a new football stadium to Abington Senior High School—the Stephen A. Schwarzman Stadium. In 2007, Schwarzman was listed among &quot;Time&quot;″s 100 Most Influential People in The World.

In early 2008, Schwarzman announced that he contributed $100 million toward the expansion of the New York Public Library, which he serves as a trustee. The central reference building on 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue was renamed the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building. In 2018, Schwarzman donated $10 million to another library, the National Library of Israel.

On April 21, 2013, Schwarzman announced a $100 million personal gift to establish and endow a scholarship program in China, Schwarzman Scholars, modeled after the Rhodes Scholarship program. Schwarzman simultaneously announced a fundraising campaign with a goal of $200 million. The Schwarzman Scholars program is housed at Tsinghua University. Since its inception, the program has maintained ties to the United Front Work Department as well as other organizations and personnel affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. Schwarzman has also worked on developing a network of scholars who understand China.

In spring 2015, Peter Salovey, the president of Yale University, announced that Schwarzman contributed $150 million to fund a campus center in the university&#x27;s &quot;Commons&quot; dining facility. Additionally, Schwarzman is also a member of the Berggruen Institute&#x27;s 21st Century Council.

He has sat on the board of trustees of New York-Presbyterian Hospital since 2016.

In early 2018, it was announced that Schwarzman gave $25 million to Abington High School, his alma mater. However, this donation was contingent on several conditions, including naming rights to the school. After the public learned about the deal, a new agreement was made and Schwarzman removed several of the conditions for his donation, including renaming the school.

In October 2018, Schwarzman donated $350 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to create the Schwarzman College of Computing.

In June 2019, the University of Oxford announced that Schwarzman had donated £150 million to establish the Schwarzman Centre for the Humanities, due to be completed for the university&#x27;s 2024–25 academic year.

Schwarzman announced in February 2020 that he had signed The Giving Pledge, committing to give the majority of his wealth to philanthropic causes.

In October 2020, Schwarzman pledged to give $8 million to the USA Track and Field Foundation in the run-up to the 2021 Tokyo and 2024 Paris Olympics.

In December 2021, Schwarzman and his wife Christine gave $25 million to the Animal Medical Center of New York in New York City. The hospital was renamed The Stephen and Christine Schwarzman Animal Medical Center.

==Personal life==
Schwarzman married his first wife Ellen Philips in 1971, a trustee of Northwestern University and the Mount Sinai Medical Center. They had two children: film producer Teddy Schwarzman and writer and podcaster Zibby Owens. The couple divorced in 1990.

Schwarzman married Christine Hearst in 1995, an intellectual property lawyer who grew up on Long Island, New York. She has one child from a previous marriage.

He lives in a duplex apartment at 740 Park Avenue previously owned by John D. Rockefeller Jr. Schwarzman purchased the apartment from Saul Steinberg. He spent millions of dollars on both his sixtieth and seventieth birthday parties.

In 2011, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported on the vast water consumption of wealthy Palm Beach residents during exceptional drought conditions. Schwarzman was listed as a top-five water user, having consumed 7,409,688 gallons between June 2010 and May 2011. The average Palm Beach resident consumes 108,000 gallons per year.

Schwarzman purchased the Miramar mansion in Newport, Rhode Island, for $27 million in 2021. He restored it and filled it with art, and has stated that he and his wife intend to open the estate to the public after their deaths.

==Other==
In 1999, Schwarzman received the American Academy of Achievement&#x27;s Golden Plate Award.

In 2018, Schwarzman was awarded the Plaque degree of the Order of the Aztec Eagle by President Enrique Peña Nieto, this in recognition of Schwarzman&#x27;s work on behalf of the U.S. in support of the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement.

In 2019, Schwarzman wrote his first book titled, &quot;What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence&quot;, &quot;which draws from his experiences in business, philanthropy and public service.&quot; His book became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller. However, the title was included with a dagger next to it, used to indicate that retailers reported receiving bulk purchases.

In 2024, Schwarzman was created by King Charles III an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) for services to philanthropy.

<text>Ursinus College is a private liberal arts college in Collegeville, Pennsylvania. It was founded in 1869 and occupies a campus. Ursinus College&#x27;s forerunner was the Freeland Seminary founded in 1848. Its $127 million endowment supports about 1,500 students. Students choose from 60 courses of study.

==History==

===19th century===
In 1867, members of the German Reformed Church began plans to establish a Christian college. The founders hoped to establish an alternative to the seminary at Mercersburg, Pennsylvania (the present-day Lancaster Theological Seminary), a school they believed was increasingly heretical to traditional Reformed faith.

Two years later, the college was granted a charter by the Legislature of Pennsylvania to begin operations on the grounds of Todd&#x27;s School (founded 1832) and the adjacent Freeland Seminary (founded 1848). John Bomberger served as the college&#x27;s first president from 1869 until his death in 1890. Bomberger proposed naming the college after Zacharias Ursinus, a 16th-century German theologian and a figure in the Protestant Reformation.

In 1870, instruction began at the college in September; on October 4, the Zwinglian Literary Society was founded. For many years the annual opening meetings of &quot;Zwing&quot; and its rival society, Schaff, were the major events of the student year.

Women were first admitted in 1881, as a direct consequence of the closing of the Pennsylvania Female College in 1880. A separate literary society for women, The Olevian, was formed in 1885.

The town of Freeland was officially incorporated as the Borough of Collegeville in 1896. The Reading Railroad had named it that in 1869 because of the Pennsylvania Female College and not, as many believe, because of Ursinus, which had just been founded.

&quot;The Ruby&quot;, Ursinus&#x27; yearbook, was first published by the Class of 1897. The name was a tribute to Professor Samuel Vernon Ruby, who collapsed as he was entering Bomberger Hall in 1896 and died in its chapel, surrounded by students and teachers who had gathered there for morning prayers.

===20th Century===

At the start of the US&#x27;s involvement in World War II, Ursinus&#x27; male enrollment decreased from 535 to 350 students. During the war, Ursinus made a concerted effort to bring in military students from across the country, even acquiring a Naval V-12 unit. It also accepted 3 students between 1939 and 1940 who were exiled from Austria and Germany because of the war.

In 1988, the F.W. Olin Foundation awarded a $5.37 million grant to Ursinus to construct a humanities building.

The Philip and Muriel Berman Museum of Art opened on campus in 1989.

Ursinus joined the Centennial Conference at its inception in 1993, a regional athletic conference, consisting of Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, Haverford College, Dickinson College, Gettysburg College, Johns Hopkins University, Franklin &amp; Marshall College, and others.

In 1995, the college appointed John Strassburger as its 12th president, the first president from outside the Ursinus alumni group. During President Strassburger&#x27;s tenure as president, Ursinus became affiliated with numerous prestigious groups such as the Annapolis Group, the Watson Foundation, the Kemper Scholars group, and Project Pericles.

===21st Century===
Ursinus College was profiled in &quot;New York Times&quot; education editor Loren Pope&#x27;s popular guidebook, &quot;Colleges That Change Lives&quot; in 2006&quot;.&quot;

In 2006, the college attempted to capitalize on J. D. Salinger&#x27;s brief time there by establishing a &quot;J. D. Salinger Scholarship&quot; which would allow a freshman to study creative writing and live in Salinger&#x27;s dormitory room for a year. However, the reclusive author&#x27;s representatives wrote to the college within a week to ask that his name be removed. The college conceded and named it simply the College Creative Writing Award though it is known colloquially as the &quot;Not the J.D. Salinger Scholarship.

In 2011, Ursinus was designated as a Top Ten &quot;Up and Coming College&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report.&quot;

Bobby Fong, a graduate of Harvard and UCLA and former president of Butler University, began his tenure as the 13th president of Ursinus on July 1, 2011. Fong died suddenly of natural causes at his home in Collegeville in 2014. Terry Winegar, the Dean and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs, was appointed Interim President.

Brock Blomberg, Dean of the Robert Day School of Economics and Finance at Claremont McKenna College, was named 17th president of Ursinus in 2015. Blomberg announced that he planned to depart Ursinus in September 2021 for the California Institute of Integral Studies.

Robyn Hannigan, former Provost of Clarkson University and patented inventor in the field of medical technology, was named the 19th President of Ursinus College in 2022. Hannigan began her duties on July 1, 2022.

==Academics==
Students choose from 60 courses of study. Popular majors at the college are biology, English, psychology, international relations, business and economics, and health and exercise physiology.

===Common Intellectual Experience===
The Common Intellectual Experience (CIE) is Ursinus&#x27; unique seminar course required of all first-year students and is a requisite for the bachelor&#x27;s degree. It was established in 1999. It is composed of two semester-long seminar courses that help students to figure out their degree path and their path after college. Students read from a range of philosophers and academic thinkers, and discuss them with their classmates.

In September 2012, Ursinus and Columbia University were awarded a joint grant from the Mellon Foundation to work together on the core of their seminar courses – Ursinus College&#x27;s CIE, and Columbia University&#x27;s Core Curriculum. The $300,000 grant allowed Ursinus faculty with prior experience teaching CIE classes to work with, and mentor, post-doctoral students at Columbia, created post-doctoral fellowship program at Ursinus, and also supported campus visits and guest lectures from Columbia faculty who have expertise in the subject matter of CIE.

==Student life==
The school&#x27;s 1,500 students come from 35 states and 12 countries. 22% are students of color and 2% are international students. The school ranges from a 11:1 to a 10:1 student-to-faculty ratio.

===Greek life===
The Ursinus College Greek community consists 12 societies – 5 sororities, 4 fraternities, and 3 gender-inclusive societies. The Ursinus College Inter-Greek Council serves as the elected governing body of all social Greek organizations.

===Clubs and organizations===
The Leadership Development and Student Activities Office provides the student body with leadership opportunities through its more than 100 student clubs and organizations. Ursinus College clubs and organizations include student government, community service, academic honor societies, political clubs and intramural sports. Their student-run newspaper is called, The Grizzly – the name taken from the Latin root of Zacharias Ursinus&#x27; surname (&quot;ursus&quot; translating as &#x27;bear&#x27;). Ursinus also publishes The Lantern, one of the oldest, continuously produced student literary journals.

==Athletics==
As of 2019, 40% of Ursinus students competed on one of its athletic teams. Ursinus is a member of the Centennial Conference, founded in 1993, and which now contains eleven private colleges in the mid-Atlantic region, including Bryn Mawr, McDaniel, Johns Hopkins, Dickinson, Haverford, Franklin and Marshall, Swarthmore, Gettysburg, Muhlenberg, and Washington.

In the immediate years following its founding, there were no organized athletics at Ursinus College. Baseball matches held against neighboring towns, hiking along the Perkiomen Creek and in the nearby area that is now Valley Forge National Historical Park, and skating, bathing and boating in the Perkiomen were popular pastimes for students. In fact, students used to be able to rent canoes and fishing rods from the same location where they can now rent bikes. Students then organized a tennis club in 1888, and intercollegiate baseball began with play against Swarthmore College, Haverford College, and Muhlenberg College between 1886 and 1890. The college&#x27;s first football team was also fielded in 1890 but did not play against another team until 1893 in which they lost 62–0 against Pennsylvania Military College.

The college was well known for many years for its Patterson Field endzone, in which a large sycamore tree grew undisturbed from the 1920s. Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not featured the famous tree for being the only one on an active field of athletic play. A new sycamore, growing since 1984 from a seedling taken from the old tree, stood nearby until a turf field project required its removal in 2011.

In 1974, the NCAA Award of Valor was presented to the 1973 basketball team. Every member of the team had entered a burning building, with their combined efforts leading to the rescue of 14 persons. In the 2003–2004 season, senior shooting guard Dennis Stanton led all NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball scorers, averaging 32.6 points per game.

The Ursinus women&#x27;s field hockey team has historically been very successful. During the tenure of Eleanor Frost Snell as coach of women&#x27;s athletics from 1931, the &quot;Snell&#x27;s Belles&quot; had many winning seasons. More recently they were the 2006 National Champion for NCAA Division III. The team earned spots in the national championship game three times before, between 1975 and 1977, as a Division I program, and the United States Field Hockey Hall of Fame&#x27;s permanent home is at the college.

Ursinus&#x27; women&#x27;s lacrosse team were the 1986, 1989, and 1990 NCAA Division III Women&#x27;s lacrosse champions and the 1985, 1987, and 1991 runners-up.

In November 2019, Ursinus College canceled their Women’s and Men’s swim teams after finding that team members violated the college’s anti-hazing policy and student code of conduct. As an additional consequence, Ursinus College placed Men’s and Women’s Swim Team Head Coach Mark Feinberg on probation.

In 2020, the NCAA Division III Committee on Infractions found that a former Ursinus College Vice President and Dean of Enrollment Management improperly awarded financial aid to prospective students based on their participation in athletics and input from coaches. The committee found that approximately $335,300 in financial aid packages was improperly awarded to student-athletes over 17 sports. As a disciplinary measure, the committee publicly reprimanded Ursinus College and placed them on probation while also requiring them to attend the 2020 and 2021 NCAA Regional Rules Seminars. Additionally, Ursinus College self-imposed numerous penalties upon themselves. 

==Campus and facilities==
The campus is northwest of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and is also within three hours’ driving distance of New York City, Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, D.C.

SEPTA bus #93 has six stops (three southeastward, three northwestward) on Ursinus’ Campus. The route extends southeast to Norristown and northwest to Pottstown.

The nearest SEPTA regional rail line is the Manayunk/Norristown Line, which extends southeastward to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The closest station on the Manayunk/Norristown line to Ursinus College is the Norristown Transportation Center, located 8 miles (13km) from Ursinus College.

Notable facilities at Ursinus include:

=== Bomberger Memorial Hall ===
Bomberger Memorial Hall was opened in 1892 and renovated in 2006. Bomberger Hall is named for John Bomberger, the first President of Ursinus College. Bomberger Auditorium is home to the Heefner Memorial Organ, a three-manual 62-rank organ dedicated in 1986. It was a gift from Mrs. Lydia V. Heefner in memory of her husband, Russell E. Heefner.

=== The Philip and Muriel Berman Museum of Art ===
The museum was dedicated in 1989, located in the original Alumni Memorial Library, built in 1921, expanded in 2010. The museum program is fully accredited by the American Alliance of Museums and houses over 4,000 paintings, prints, drawings, sculpture, decorative, and cultural objects representing a broad array of art historical genres.

The Alumni Memorial Library was dedicated to the 271 Ursinus students and alumni who served in WWII including 8 who died in action. It was built upon a former boarding house.

=== Eger Gateway ===
An iron and stone gateway was erected in 1925 and named for George P. Eger, father of alumnus Sherman A. Eger. The gate reads &quot;Ursinus College&quot; and there is a lantern atop it. Tablets inset into the gate&#x27;s stone columns tell the history of Ursinus College.

=== Brodbeck-Wilkinson-Curtis Hall ===
Brodbeck and Curtis Halls opened in 1927. Wilkinson Hall, named for Joseph C. Wilkinson, opened in 1966 connecting Brodbeck and Curtis.

=== Pfahler Hall &amp; the Walter W. Marstellar Memorial Observatory ===
Pfahler Hall opened in 1932, renovated and expanded in 1998. Named in honor of George E. Pfahler. Within this building Professor John Mauchly worked on the ENIAC, the world&#x27;s first computer. Alumnus and Nobel Laureate Gerald Edelman also attended classes here.

The hall is built on grounds where the first women&#x27;s dormitory, Olevian Hall, stood from 1865 until 1931.

In the 1950s, alumnus Walter W. Marsteller used military surplus materials and aircraft scrap to build an observatory atop the building. However, it was dismantled in the late 1990s.

The labs are equipped with a 300-MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer, Fourier-transform spectrometers, an isothermal calorimeter, gas chromatography/mass spectrometers, a voltammetric analyzer, UV visible absorbance spectrometers, high performance liquid chromatographs, an atomic absorption spectrometer, a capillary electrophoresis apparatus, a Mössbauer spectrometer, and a fluorescence spectrometer.

=== Beardwood-Paisley-Stauffer Hall ===

<doc id="885075" wikidata="Q212900" url="?curid=885075" title="Lehman Brothers">
<text>Lehman Brothers Inc. ( ) was an American global financial services firm founded in 1850. Before filing for bankruptcy in 2008, Lehman was the fourth-largest investment bank in the United States (behind Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch), with about 25,000 employees worldwide. It was doing business in investment banking, equity, fixed-income and derivatives sales and trading (especially U.S. Treasury securities), research, investment management, private equity, and private banking. Lehman was operational for 158 years from its founding in 1850 until 2008.

On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following the exodus of most of its clients, drastic declines in its stock price, and the devaluation of assets by credit rating agencies. The collapse was largely due to Lehman&#x27;s involvement in the subprime mortgage crisis and its exposure to less liquid assets. Lehman&#x27;s bankruptcy filing is the largest in US history, having beaten the previous record holder Worldcom, Inc., and is thought to have played a major role in the unfolding of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. The market collapse also gave support to the &quot;too big to fail&quot; doctrine.

After Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, global markets immediately plummeted. The following day, major British bank Barclays announced its agreement to purchase, subject to regulatory approval, a significant and controlling interest in Lehman&#x27;s North American investment-banking and trading divisions, along with its New York headquarters building. On September 20, 2008, a revised version of that agreement was approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge James M. Peck. The next week, Nomura Holdings announced that it would acquire Lehman Brothers&#x27; franchise in the Asia–Pacific region, including Japan, Hong Kong and Australia, as well as Lehman Brothers&#x27; investment banking and equities businesses in Europe and the Middle East. The deal became effective on October 13, 2008.

== History ==

=== Under the Lehman family (1850–1969) ===
In 1844, 23-year-old Hayum Lehmann, who changed his name to Henry Lehman, the son of a Jewish cattle merchant, emigrated to the United States from Rimpar, Bavaria. He settled in Montgomery, Alabama, where he opened a dry-goods store, &quot;H. Lehman&quot;. In 1847, following the arrival of his brother Emanuel Lehman, the firm became &quot;H. Lehman and Bro.&quot; With the arrival of their youngest brother, Mayer Lehman, in 1850, the firm changed its name again and &quot;Lehman Brothers&quot; was founded.

During the 1850s, cotton was one of the most important crops in the United States, and was Alabama&#x27;s highest-grossing cash crop. Until the U.S. Civil War, nearly all U.S. cotton was produced by slave labor, and by the 1860 census, slaves constituted nearly 45% of Alabama&#x27;s total population. Mayer Lehman was listed as the owner of seven slaves (&quot;three males and four females ranging in age from 5 to 50&quot;) in the U.S. Census of 1860.

Capitalizing on cotton&#x27;s high market value, the three brothers began to routinely accept raw cotton from slave plantations as payment for merchandise, eventually beginning a second business trading in cotton. Within a few years this business grew to become the most significant part of their operation. Following Henry&#x27;s death from yellow fever in 1855, the remaining brothers continued to focus on their commodities-trading/brokerage operations.

By 1858, the center of cotton trading had shifted from the South to New York City, where factors and commission houses were based. Lehman opened its first branch office at 119 Liberty Street, and 32-year-old Emanuel relocated there to run the office. In 1862, facing difficulties as a result of the Civil War, the firm teamed up with a cotton merchant named John Durr to form Lehman, Durr &amp; Co. Following the war the company helped finance Alabama&#x27;s reconstruction. The firm&#x27;s headquarters was eventually moved to New York City, where it helped found the New York Cotton Exchange in 1870, commodifying the crop; Emanuel sat on the board of governors until 1884. The firm also dealt in the emerging market for railroad bonds and entered the financial-advisory business.

Lehman became a member of the Coffee Exchange as early as 1883 and finally the New York Stock Exchange in 1887. In 1899, it underwrote its first public offering, the preferred and common stock of the International Steam Pump Company.

Despite the offering of International Steam, the firm&#x27;s real shift from being a commodities house to a house of issue did not begin until 1906. In that year, under Emanuel&#x27;s son Philip Lehman, the firm partnered with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., to bring the General Cigar Co. to market, followed closely by Sears, Roebuck and Company. Among these were F.W. Woolworth Company, May Department Stores Company, Gimbel Brothers, Inc., R.H. Macy &amp; Company, The Studebaker Corporation, the B.F. Goodrich Co., and Endicott Johnson Corporation.

Following Philip Lehman&#x27;s retirement in 1925, his son Robert &quot;Bobbie&quot; Lehman took over as head of the firm. During Bobbie&#x27;s tenure, the company weathered the capital crisis of the Great Depression by focusing on venture capital while the equities market recovered.

In 1924, John M. Hancock became the first non-family member to join the firm, followed by Monroe C. Gutman and Paul Mazur, who became partners in 1927. By 1928, the firm had moved to its One William Street location.
In the 1930s, Lehman underwrote the initial public offering of the first television manufacturer, DuMont Laboratories, and helped fund the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). It also helped finance the rapidly growing oil industry, including the companies Halliburton and Kerr-McGee. In the 1950s, Lehman underwrote the IPO of Digital Equipment Corporation. Later, it arranged the acquisition of Digital by Compaq.

=== An evolving partnership (1969–1984) ===
Robert Lehman died in 1969 after 44 years in a leadership position for the firm, leaving no member of the Lehman family actively involved with the partnership. At the same time, Lehman was facing strong headwinds amidst the difficult economic environment of the early 1970s. By 1972, the firm was facing hard times and in 1973, Pete Peterson, chairman and chief executive officer of the Bell &amp; Howell Corporation, was brought in to save the firm.

Under Peterson&#x27;s leadership as chairman and CEO, the firm acquired Abraham &amp; Co. in 1975, and two years later merged with Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co., to form Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc., the country&#x27;s fourth-largest investment bank, behind Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs and First Boston. Peterson led the firm from significant operating losses to five consecutive years of record profits with a return on equity among the highest in the investment-banking industry.

By the early 1980s, hostilities between the firm&#x27;s investment bankers and traders prompted Peterson to promote Lewis Glucksman, the firm&#x27;s President, COO and former trader, to be his co-CEO in May 1983. Glucksman introduced a number of changes that had the effect of increasing tensions, which when coupled with Glucksman&#x27;s management style and a downturn in the markets, resulted in a power struggle that ousted Peterson and left Glucksman as the sole CEO.

Upset bankers, who had soured over the power struggle, left the company. Stephen A. Schwarzman, chairman of the firm&#x27;s M&amp;A committee, recalled in a February 2003 interview with &quot;Private Equity International&quot; that &quot;Lehman Brothers had an extremely competitive internal environment, which ultimately became dysfunctional.&quot; The company suffered under the disintegration, and Glucksman was pressured into selling the firm.

=== Merger with American Express (1984–1994) ===
Shearson/American Express, an American Express-owned securities company focused on brokerage rather than investment banking, acquired Lehman in 1984, for $360 million. On May 11, the combined firms became Shearson Lehman/American Express.

From 1983 to 1990, Peter A. Cohen was CEO and chairman of Shearson Lehman Brothers, where he led the $1 billion purchase of E.F. Hutton to form Shearson Lehman Hutton. In 1989, Shearson backed F. Ross Johnson&#x27;s management team in its attempted management buyout of RJR Nabisco, but were ultimately outbid by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, who was backed by Drexel Burnham Lambert.

=== Divestment and independence (1994–2008) ===
In 1993, under newly appointed CEO Harvey Golub, American Express began to divest itself of its banking and brokerage operations. It sold its retail brokerage and asset management operations to Primerica and in 1994 it spun off Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb in an initial public offering, as Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. After being spun off, Dick Fuld became CEO of the company. Fuld steered Lehman through the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, and when the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund collapsed in 1998.

In 2001, the firm acquired the private-client services, or &quot;PCS&quot;, business of Cowen &amp; Co. and later, in 2003, aggressively re-entered the asset-management business, which it had exited in 1989. Beginning with $2 billion in assets under management, the firm acquired the Crossroads Group, the fixed-income division of Lincoln Capital Management and Neuberger Berman. These businesses, together with the PCS business and Lehman&#x27;s private-equity business, comprised the Investment Management Division, which generated approximately $3.1 billion in net revenue.

During the subprime mortgage crisis, Fuld kept his job while CEOs of rivals like Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, and Citigroup were forced to resign. In addition, Lehman&#x27;s board of directors, which included retired CEOs like Vodafone&#x27;s Christopher Gent and IBM&#x27;s John Akers were reluctant to challenge Fuld as the firm&#x27;s share price spiraled lower.

In May 2008, prior to going bankrupt, the firm had $639 billion in assets.

=== Response to September 11, 2001 attacks ===

On September 11, 2001, Lehman occupied three floors (38–40) of 1 World Trade Center, where one of its employees was killed in the terrorist attacks of that day. Its global headquarters in Three World Financial Center were severely damaged and rendered unusable by falling debris, displacing over 6,500 employees. Trading operations moved to Jersey City, New Jersey. When stock markets reopened on September 17, 2001, Lehman&#x27;s sales and trading capabilities were restored.

In the ensuing months, the firm spread its operations across New York City in over 40 temporary locations. The investment-banking division converted the first-floor lounges, restaurants, and all 665 guest rooms of the Sheraton Manhattan Hotel into office space.

The bank also experimented with flextime (to share office space) and remote work via virtual private networking after the attacks. In October 2001, Lehman purchased a 32-story, office building for a reported sum of $700 million. The building, located at 745 Seventh Avenue, had recently been completed, and not yet occupied, by rival Morgan Stanley. Lehman began moving into the new facility in January and finished in March 2002. The firm did not return to Three World Financial Center as its structural integrity had not been given a clean bill of health, and the company could not have waited for repairs to Three World Financial Center to conclude.

After the attacks, Lehman&#x27;s management placed increased emphasis on business continuity planning. Aside from its headquarters in Three World Financial Center, Lehman maintained operations-and-backoffice facilities in Jersey City, space that the firm considered leaving prior to 9/11. The space was not only retained, but expanded, including the construction of a backup-trading facility.

=== June 2003 SEC litigation ===
In June 2003, the company was one of ten firms which simultaneously entered into a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Office of the New York State Attorney General and various other securities regulators, regarding undue influence over each firm&#x27;s research analysts by its investment-banking divisions. Regulators alleged that the firms had improperly associated analyst compensation with the firms&#x27; investment-banking revenues, and promised favorable, market-moving research coverage, in exchange for underwriting opportunities. The settlement, known as the &quot;global settlement&quot;, provided for total financial penalties of $1.4 billion, including $80 million against Lehman, and structural reforms including a complete separation of investment banking departments from research departments, no analyst compensation, directly or indirectly, from investment-banking revenues, and the provision of free, independent, third-party, research to the firms&#x27; clients.

== Rise of mortgage origination (1997–2006) ==
Lehman was one of the first Wall Street firms to move into the business of mortgage origination. In 1997, Lehman bought Colorado-based lender, Aurora Loan Services (not a bank), an Alt-A lender. In 2000, to expand their mortgage origination pipeline, Lehman purchased West Coast subprime mortgage lender BNC Mortgage LLC. Lehman quickly became a force in the subprime market. By 2003 Lehman made $18.2 billion in loans and ranked third in lending. By 2004, this number topped $40 billion. By 2006, Aurora and BNC were lending almost $50 billion per month. By 2008, Lehman had assets of $680 billion supported by only $22.5 billion of firm capital. From an equity position, its risky commercial real estate holdings were thirty times greater than capital. In such a highly leveraged structure, a 3 to 5 percent decline in real estate values would wipe out all capital.

== Collapse ==
=== Causes ===

==== Malfeasance ====
A March 2010 report by the court appointed examiner indicated that Lehman executives regularly used cosmetic accounting gimmicks at the end of each quarter to make its finances appear less shaky than they really were. This practice was a type of repurchase agreement that temporarily removed securities from the company&#x27;s balance sheet. However, unlike typical repurchase agreements, these deals were described by Lehman as the outright sale of securities and created &quot;a materially misleading picture of the firm&#x27;s financial condition in late 2007 and 2008&quot;.

==== Subprime mortgage crisis ====

In August 2007, the firm closed its subprime lender, BNC Mortgage, eliminating 1,200 positions in 23 locations, and took an after-tax charge of $25 million and a $27 million reduction in goodwill. Lehman said that poor market conditions in the mortgage space &quot;necessitated a substantial reduction in its resources and capacity in the subprime space.&quot;

In September 2007, Joe Gregory appointed Erin Callan as CFO. On March 16, 2008, after rival Bear Stearns was taken over by JPMorgan Chase in a fire sale, market analysts suggested that Lehman would be the next major investment bank to fall. Callan fielded Lehman&#x27;s first quarter conference call, where the firm posted a profit of $48.9 million, compared to Citigroup&#x27;s $5.1 billion and Merrill Lynch&#x27;s $1.97 billion losses which was Lehman&#x27;s 55th consecutive profitable quarter. The firm&#x27;s stock price leapt 46 percent after that announcement.

In 2008, Lehman faced an unprecedented loss to the continuing subprime mortgage crisis. Lehman&#x27;s loss was a result of having held on to large positions in subprime and other lower-rated mortgage tranches when securitizing the underlying mortgages; it is unclear whether Lehman was simply unable to sell the lower-rated bonds or voluntarily kept them. In any event, huge losses accrued in lower-rated mortgage-backed securities throughout 2008. In the second fiscal quarter, Lehman reported losses of $2.8 billion and was forced to sell off $6 billion in assets. In the first half of 2008 alone, Lehman stock lost 73% of its value as the credit market continued to tighten.

On June 9, 2008, Lehman Brothers announced a US$2.8 billion second-quarter loss, its first since being spun off from American Express, as market volatility rendered many of its hedges ineffective during that time. Lehman also reported that it had raised a further $6 billion in capital. As a result, there was major management shakeup, in which Hugh &quot;Skip&quot; McGee III (head of investment banking) held a meeting with senior staff to strip CEO Richard Fuld and his lieutenants of their authority. Consequently, Joe Gregory agreed to resign as president and COO, and afterward he told Erin Callan that she had to resign as CFO. Callan was appointed CFO of Lehman in 2008 but served only for six months, before departing after her mentor Joe Gregory was demoted. Bart McDade was named to succeed Gregory as president and COO, when several senior executives threatened to leave if he was not promoted. McDade took charge and brought back Michael Gelband and Alex Kirk, who had previously been pushed out of the firm by Gregory for not taking risks. Although Fuld remained CEO, he soon became isolated from McDade&#x27;s team.

In August 2008, Lehman reported that it intended to release 6% of its work force, 1,500 people, just ahead of its third-quarter-reporting deadline in September. On August 22, 2008, shares in Lehman closed up 5% (16% for the week) on reports that the state-controlled Korea Development Bank was considering buying the bank. Most of those gains were quickly eroded as news came in that Korea Development Bank was &quot;facing difficulties pleasing regulators and attracting partners for the deal.&quot;

On September 9, Lehman&#x27;s shares plunged 45% to $7.79, after it was reported that the state-run South Korean firm had put talks on hold. Investor confidence continued to erode as Lehman&#x27;s stock lost roughly half its value and pushed the S&amp;P 500 down 3.4% on September 9. The Dow Jones lost 300 points the same day on investors&#x27; concerns about the security of the bank. The U.S. government did not announce any plans to assist with any possible financial crisis that emerged at Lehman.

The next day, Lehman announced a loss of $3.9 billion and its intent to sell off a majority stake in its investment-management business, which included Neuberger Berman. The stock slid seven percent that day. Lehman, after earlier rejecting questions on the sale of the company, was reportedly searching for a buyer as its stock price dropped another 40 percent on September 11, 2008.

Just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, executives at Neuberger Berman sent e-mail memos suggesting, among other things, that the Lehman Brothers&#x27; top people forgo multimillion-dollar bonuses to &quot;send a strong message to both employees and investors that management is not shirking accountability for recent performance.&quot; Lehman Brothers Investment Management Director George Herbert Walker IV dismissed the proposal, going so far as to actually apologize to other members of the Lehman Brothers executive committee for the idea having been suggested. He wrote, &quot;Sorry team. I am not sure what&#x27;s in the water at Neuberger Berman. I&#x27;m embarrassed and I apologize.&quot;

==== Short-selling allegations ====
During hearings on the bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers and bailout of AIG before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, former Lehman Brothers CEO Richard Fuld said a host of factors including a crisis of confidence and naked short-selling attacks followed by false rumors contributed to both the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. House committee Chairman Henry Waxman said the committee received thousands of pages of internal documents from Lehman and these documents portray a company in which there was &quot;no accountability for failure&quot;.

An article by journalist Matt Taibbi in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; contended that naked short selling contributed to the demise of both Lehman and Bear Stearns. A study by finance researchers at the University of Oklahoma Price College of Business studied trading in financial stocks, including Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, and found &quot;no evidence that stock price declines were caused by naked short selling&quot;.

=== Bankruptcy ===

On Saturday, September 13, 2008, Timothy F. Geithner, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, called a meeting on the future of Lehman, which included the possibility of an emergency liquidation of its assets. Lehman reported that it had been in talks with Bank of America and Barclays for the company&#x27;s possible sale; however, both Barclays and Bank of America ultimately declined to purchase the entire company, in the former case because the British government (in particular, the Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the CEO of the Financial Services Authority Hector Sants) refused to allow the transaction at the last minute, quoting stockholder regulations in the UK, despite a deal having apparently been completed.

The next day, Sunday, September 14, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) offered an exceptional trading session to allow market participants to offset positions in various derivatives on the condition of a Lehman bankruptcy later that day. Although the bankruptcy filing missed the deadline, many dealers honored the trades they made in the special session.
Shortly before 1 am Monday morning (UTC−5), Lehman Brothers Holdings announced it would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection citing bank debt of $613 billion, $155 billion in bond debt, and assets worth $639 billion. It further announced that its subsidiaries would continue to operate as normal. A group of Wall Street firms agreed to provide capital and financial assistance for the bank&#x27;s orderly liquidation and the Federal Reserve, in turn, agreed to a swap of lower-quality assets in exchange for loans and other assistance from the government. The morning witnessed scenes of Lehman employees removing files, items with the company logo, and other belongings from the world headquarters at 745 Seventh Avenue. The spectacle continued throughout the day and into the following day.

Brian Marsal, co-chief executive of the restructuring firm Alvarez and Marsal was appointed as chief restructuring officer and subsequently chief executive officer of the company.

Later that day, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) suspended Lehman&#x27;s Australian subsidiary as a market participant after clearing-houses terminated contracts with the firm. Lehman shares tumbled over 90% on September 15, 2008. The Dow Jones closed down just over 500 points on September 15, 2008, which was at the time the largest drop in a single day since the days following the attacks on September 11, 2001.

In the United Kingdom, the investment bank went to administration with PricewaterhouseCoopers appointed as administrators. In Japan, the Japanese branch, Lehman Brothers Japan Inc., and its holding company filed for civil reorganization on September 16, 2008, in Tokyo District Court. On September 17, 2008, the New York Stock Exchange delisted Lehman Brothers.

On March 16, 2011 some three years after filing for bankruptcy and following a filing in a Manhattan U.S. bankruptcy court, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc announced it would seek creditor approval of its reorganization plan by October 14 followed by a confirmation hearing to follow on November 17.

=== Liquidation ===
==== Barclays acquisition ====

On September 16, 2008, Barclays PLC announced that they would acquire a &quot;stripped clean&quot; portion of Lehman for $1.75 billion, including most of Lehman&#x27;s North America operations. On September 20, 2008, a revised version of the deal, a $1.35 billion (£700 million) plan for Barclays to acquire the core business of Lehman (mainly its $960-million headquarters, a 38-story office building in Midtown Manhattan, with responsibility for 9,000 former employees), was approved. After a 7-hour hearing, U.S. bankruptcy judge James Peck ruled: &quot;I have to approve this transaction because it is the only available transaction. Lehman Brothers became a victim, in effect the only true icon to fall in a tsunami that has befallen the credit markets. This is the most momentous bankruptcy hearing I&#x27;ve ever sat through. It can never be deemed precedent for future cases. It&#x27;s hard for me to imagine a similar emergency.&quot;

Luc Despins, then a partner at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy, the creditors committee counsel, said: &quot;The reason we&#x27;re not objecting is really based on the lack of a viable alternative. We did not support the transaction because there had not been enough time to properly review it.&quot; In the amended agreement, Barclays would absorb $47.4 billion in securities and assume $45.5 billion in trading liabilities. Lehman&#x27;s attorney Harvey R. Miller of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, said &quot;the purchase price for the real estate components of the deal would be $1.29 billion, including $960 million for Lehman&#x27;s New York headquarters and $330 million for two New Jersey data centers. Lehman&#x27;s original estimate valued its headquarters at $1.02 billion but an appraisal from CB Richard Ellis this week valued it at $900 million.&quot; Barclays were not to acquire Lehman&#x27;s Eagle Energy unit, but to have entities known as Lehman Brothers Canada Inc, Lehman Brothers Sudamerica, Lehman Brothers Uruguay and its Private Investment Management business for high-net-worth individuals. Finally, Lehman would retain $20 billion of securities assets in Lehman Brothers Inc that are not being transferred to Barclays. Barclays acquired a potential liability of $2.5 billion to be paid as severance, if it chooses not to retain some Lehman employees beyond the guaranteed 90 days.

==== Nomura acquisition ====

Nomura Holdings, Japan&#x27;s top brokerage firm, agreed to buy the Asian division of Lehman Brothers for $225 million and parts of the European division for a nominal fee of $2. It would not take on any trading assets or liabilities in the European units. Nomura negotiated such a low price because it acquired only Lehman&#x27;s employees in the regions, and not its stocks, bonds or other assets. The last Lehman Brothers Annual Report identified that these non-US subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers were responsible for over 50% of global revenue produced.

==== Sale of asset management businesses ====

On September 29, 2008, Lehman agreed to sell Neuberger Berman, part of its investment management business, to a pair of private-equity firms, Bain Capital Partners and Hellman &amp; Friedman, for $2.15 billion. The transaction was expected to close in early 2009, subject to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, but a competing bid was entered by the firm&#x27;s management, who ultimately prevailed in a bankruptcy auction on December 3, 2008. Creditors of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. retain a 49% common equity interest in the firm, now known as Neuberger Berman Group LLC. In Europe, the Quantitative Asset Management Business has been acquired back by its employees on November 13, 2008 and has been renamed back to TOBAM.

=== Financial fallout ===
Lehman&#x27;s bankruptcy was the largest failure of an investment bank since Drexel Burnham Lambert collapsed in 1990 amid fraud allegations. Immediately following the bankruptcy filing, an already distressed financial market began a period of extreme volatility, during which the Dow experienced its largest one day point loss, largest intra-day range (more than 1,000 points) and largest daily point gain. What followed was what many have called the &quot;perfect storm&quot; of economic distress factors and eventually a $700bn bailout package (Troubled Asset Relief Program) prepared by Henry Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury, and approved by Congress. The Dow eventually closed at a new six-year low of 7,552.29 on November 20, followed by a further drop to 6626 by March of the next year.

The fall of Lehman also had a strong effect on small private investors such as bond holders and holders of so-called minibonds. In Germany, structured products, often based on an index, were sold mostly to private investors, elderly, retired persons, students and families. Most of those now worthless derivatives were sold by the German arm of Citigroup, the German Citibank now owned by Crédit Mutuel.

=== Ongoing litigation ===

On March 11, 2010, Anton R. Valukas, a court-appointed examiner, published the results of its year-long investigation into the finances of Lehman Brothers. This report revealed that Lehman Brothers used an accounting procedure termed repo 105 to temporarily exchange $50 billion of assets into cash just before publishing its financial statements. The action could be seen to implicate both Ernst &amp; Young, the bank&#x27;s accountancy firm and Richard S. Fuld, Jr, the former CEO. This could potentially lead to Ernst &amp; Young being found guilty of financial malpractice and Fuld facing time in prison. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, in March 2011, the SEC announced that they weren&#x27;t confident that they could prove that Lehman Brothers violated US laws in its accounting practices.

In October 2011, the administrators of Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. lost their appeal to overturn a court order forcing them to pay £148 million into their underfunded pensions plan.

As of January 2016, Lehman paid more than $105 billion to its unsecured creditors. In addition, JPMorgan will pay $1.42 billion in cash to settle a lawsuit accusing JPMorgan of draining Lehman Brothers liquidity right before the crash. The settlement would permit another $1.496 billion to be paid to creditors and a separate $76 million deposit.

The brokerage unit of Lehman Brothers completed its liquidation process on September 28, 2022, after paying out over $115 billion to its customers and creditors over the course of 14 years. As of December 2022, Lehman&#x27;s British operations were being administrated by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which expected to complete the administration process no earlier than 2025.

==In popular culture==

The events of the weekend leading up to Lehman&#x27;s bankruptcy are dramatized in the 2009 BBC television film &quot;The Last Days of Lehman Brothers&quot;.

In the 2010 animated film &quot;Despicable Me&quot;, the main character Gru visits the Bank of Evil, which funds all evil plots for villains around the world and has a sign reading &quot;Formerly Lehman Brothers&quot;.

The 2011 drama film &quot;Margin Call&quot; focuses on the events of a 24-hour period at a large investment bank based on an amalgam of investment banks, drawing heavily from the culture of Lehman Brothers. However, the events in the film are primarily a depiction of the actions of Goldman Sachs.

The 2011 HBO film &quot;Too Big to Fail&quot; recounts the days before Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and the fallout afterward.

The 2011 film &quot;Horrible Bosses&quot; features a character by the name of Kenny Sommerfield (played by P. J. Byrne) who worked at Lehman Brothers until its bankruptcy, ending up broke.

The fall of Lehman Brothers is depicted in the 2015 film &quot;The Big Short&quot;, where two of the characters walk around the Lehman Brothers offices after the bankruptcy to see the main trading floor.

In Imbolo Mbue&#x27;s 2016 debut novel &quot;Behold the Dreamers&quot;, an immigrant from Cameroon is a chauffeur for Clark Edwards, an executive at Lehman Brothers.

In the 2016 animated film &quot;Zootopia&quot;, there is a brief appearance of a bank called Lemming Brothers, which is staffed by lemmings.

&quot;The Lehman Trilogy&quot; is a three-act play by Italian dramatist Stefano Massini about the history of the Lehman Brothers.

In the 2019 Showtime comedy series &quot;Black Monday&quot;, a fictionalized version of Lehman Brothers with an altered spelling is central to the plot and represented by brothers Larry &amp; Lenny Leighman.

<text>The Boeing Y1B-20 (Boeing 316) was designed as an improvement on the Boeing XB-15. It was slightly larger than its predecessor, and was intended to use much more powerful engines. It was presented to the Army in early 1938, and two orders were placed soon after. The order was reversed before construction began.

Despite their cancellation, the XB-15 and Y1B-20 laid the groundwork for the Boeing B-29 Superfortress.

<doc id="885103" wikidata="Q407619" url="?curid=885103" title="U.S. Route 13">
<text>U.S. Route 13 or U.S. Highway 13 (US 13) is a north–south United States Numbered Highway established in 1926 that runs for from Interstate 95 (I-95) just north of Fayetteville, North Carolina, to US 1 in the northeastern suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, near Morrisville. In all, it traverses five states in the Atlantic coastal plain region. It follows the Atlantic coast more closely than does the main north–south U.S. Highway of the region, US 1. Because of this, its number is out of place on the general U.S. Highway numbering grid, as it should be running west of US 11 but does not. Its routing is largely rural, the notable exceptions being the Hampton Roads area in Virginia and the northern end of the highway in Delaware and Pennsylvania. It is also notable for being the main thoroughfare for the Delmarva Peninsula and carrying the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel to it in Virginia.

US 13&#x27;s original plan in 1926 had the route serve no further south than the Delmarva Peninsula. However, it has been extended many times, connecting to the mainland via ferry service and eventually reaching North Carolina. This link across the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay became fixed in 1964 with a bridge–tunnel. The entire route on the Delmarva Peninsula, except for a few sections in Accomack County, Virginia, has been dualized fully with four lanes, and further upgrades continue, such as a freeway section around the east side of Salisbury, Maryland.

===North Carolina===
US 13 runs southwest to northeast through the eastern part of North Carolina. It begins at I-95 near Fayetteville as a continuation of I-295 (Fayetteville Outer Loop) and heads northeast, intersecting US 421 in Spivey&#x27;s Corner and US 701 in Newton Grove. It passes over I-40 without an interchange; access is provided via US 701 or North Carolina Highway 50 (NC 50). It then passes through the city of Goldsboro, where it intersects US 70 and US 117. US 13 continues northeast and shares a brief concurrency with US 264 before passing through the city of Greenville. US 13 then heads north from Greenville, following the limited-access US 64 east between Bethel and Williamston and US 17 north between Williamston and Windsor. US 13 then heads north from Windsor toward Ahoskie and intersects with NC 11. It then crosses US 158 in Gates before crossing the state line with Virginia.

===Virginia===
US 13 continues north, expanding to four lanes near Suffolk and diverges onto the Suffolk Bypass where it joins US 58 and US 460. Here, one of the many business routes of US 13 passes straight through the city as the bypass passes the city to the west. It continues through the Hampton Roads area on the Military Highway and continues north to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel, which the route uses to continue across the Chesapeake Bay to the Eastern Shore of Virginia. Here, US 13 is the main north–south route of the region and connects to most cities and towns with four more business routes forming loops off the highway. North of New Church, US 13 crosses the state border into Maryland.

===Maryland===

US 13 passes through the lower Eastern Shore region of Maryland. It runs through Pocomoke City in Worcester County, where it meets the southern terminus of US 113. It continues north into Somerset County, where it passes through the town of Princess Anne. It then enters Wicomico County, where it bypasses the cities of Salisbury and Fruitland to the east on the limited-access Salisbury Bypass, with the former alignment signed as US 13 Business (US 13 Bus.). On the northeastern part of the bypass, US 13 is concurrent with US 50, which bypasses Salisbury to the north. North of Salisbury, US 13 continues to the state line town of Delmar.

===Delaware===
US 13 runs through the entire north–south length of Delaware. It enters the state in Delmar and runs through western Sussex County, intersecting the western terminus of US 9 in Laurel and passing through the city of Seaford. It continues into Kent County and heads north toward the state capital of Dover. US 13 forms the commercial district of the city of Dover. Between Dover and Wilmington in New Castle County, US 13 is paralleled by the Delaware Route 1 (DE 1) freeway, portions of which are a toll road. It crosses the Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal on the St. Georges Bridge. US 13 continues toward Wilmington, sharing a concurrency with US 40 in the New Castle area. It bypasses the heart of Wilmington to the east, with US 13 Bus. passing through the downtown area. US 13 parallels I-495 between Wilmington and the Pennsylvania border.

===Pennsylvania===
Upon entering the commonwealth of Pennsylvania from Delaware, US 13 runs along the banks of the Delaware River parallel to I-95 through Delaware County. It then runs a southwest to northeast path through the city of Philadelphia. It traverses West Philadelphia on many one-way pairs and then passes by the Philadelphia Zoo. US 13 then runs through North Philadelphia and Northeast Philadelphia by following Hunting Park Avenue, the Roosevelt Boulevard (which is also US 1), and Frankford Avenue, where it crosses Pennypack Creek on the oldest bridge in the U.S. US 13 then enters Bucks County, again closely following I-95, the Delaware River and US 1. US 13 ends after an interchange with US 1 near Morrisville in Falls Township. The road continues north toward Yardley as Pine Grove Road.

==History==
The original 1925 U.S. Highway plan, which never came to fruition, had provision for a US 13 in North Carolina. It would have started in Wilmington and run at least as far north as Elizabeth City, following what would become US 17. Although US 13 was signed in most northern states by the late 1920s, it would not reach North Carolina until the early 1950s.

The route was proposed as one of the first four-lane highways in the U.S. to Pierre S. du Pont by John J. Raskob so as to run from Wilmington, Delaware, to the state capital, Dover. Du Pont wanted a two-lane highway—the standard at the time, but Raskob suggested that with the growth and development of northern Delaware, there would be a future need for a four-lane one. Du Pont agreed and, to honor Raskob for his insight, sought to name the route after him. However, Raskob declined.

<doc id="885126" wikidata="Q1508234" url="?curid=885126" title="Safeway">
<text>Safeway, Inc. is an American supermarket chain. The chain provides grocery items, food and general merchandise and a variety of specialty departments, such as bakery, delicatessen, floral and pharmacy, as well as Starbucks coffee shops, and vehicle fuel centers. It is a subsidiary of Albertsons after being acquired by private equity investors led by Cerberus Capital Management in January 2015. Safeway&#x27;s primary base of operations is in the Western United States, with some stores located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the Eastern Seaboard. The subsidiary is headquartered in Pleasanton, California.

==History==
Marion Barton Skaggs, who already had experience in the grocery business, moved to Portland, Oregon in 1921, and established four grocery stores. This chain of stores grew quickly, and Skaggs enlisted the help of his five brothers to grow the network of stores. By 1926, he had opened 428 Skaggs stores in 10 states. He then almost doubled the size of his business that year when he merged his company with 322 Sam Seelig Company stores and incorporated as Safeway, Inc., because he thought that a chain that would outlive him should not carry his name.

The point of the Safeway name was that the grocery operated exclusively on a cash-and-carry basis – it did not offer credit to customers, as American grocers traditionally had done. It was the &quot;safe way&quot; to buy food because a family could not get into debt via its grocery bill (as many families did at the time, a contributing cause of the Great Depression in the United States). Thus, the original slogan was: &quot;Drive the Safeway. Buy the Safeway&quot;.

The 1926 merger came about because of Charles E. Merrill, the founder of the Merrill Lynch brokerage firm, who saw an opportunity to consolidate the West Coast grocery industry. Towards this end, he purchased the 322-store Safeway chain of W.R.H. Weldon, who wished to exit retailing and concentrate on wholesale. Then, in June 1926, Merrill offered Skaggs either $7 million outright or $1.5 million plus 30,000 shares in the merged firm. Skaggs took the latter. On July 1, 1926, Safeway merged with the 673 stores from Skaggs United Stores of Idaho and Skaggs Cash Stores of California. On completion of the Skaggs/Safeway merger, M. B. Skaggs became the Chief Executive of the business. Two years later, Skaggs listed Safeway on the New York Stock Exchange. In the 1930s, Safeway introduced produce pricing by the pound, adding &quot;sell by&quot; dates on perishables, nutritional labeling, and some of the first parking lots.

The merger instantly created the largest chain of grocery stores west of the Mississippi. At the time of the merger, the company was headquartered in Reno, Nevada. In 1929, it was relocated to a former grocery warehouse in Oakland, California, where it had the exclusive zip code of 94660. Safeway headquarters remained there until they moved to their new offices across from Stoneridge Mall in Pleasanton, California, in 1996. In the 1930s, Charles E. Merrill temporarily left Merrill Lynch to help manage Safeway.

In the late 1930s, the New Negro Alliance boycotted the Sanitary Grocery Company (then a Safeway subsidiary) to pressure store owners to employ black people, especially in predominantly black neighborhoods. The Sanitary Grocery Company successfully sought an injunction against the New Negro Alliance, which was upheld by the Washington, D.C., Court of Appeals. This led to the 1938 landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision of &quot;New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co.&quot;, which defended the right to peaceful protest in the resolution of labor disputes.

In 1969, the Black Panther Party and the United Farm Workers launched simultaneous boycotts of Safeway grocery stores, which were the largest grocery store chain in the U.S. West at that time. The Panthers boycotted due to Safeway&#x27;s refusal to donate to their Free Breakfast for Children Program, created to serve daily hot breakfasts to underprivileged children throughout the U.S. The United Farm Workers boycotted Safeway because the chain continued to sell California grapes despite the union&#x27;s nationwide boycott. The Panthers and United Farm Workers also acted in solidarity with each other&#x27;s goals in boycotting Safeway, including during a 1973 Panthers demonstration outside an Oakland Safeway store documented by KPIX Eyewitness news, in which protestors carried signs that read &quot;Boycott Safeway, Boycott Grapes&quot;.

==Expansion==
The initial public offering price of Safeway stock was $226 in 1927 (). A five for one split in 1928 brought the price down to under $50 (). Over the next few years, Charles Merrill, with financing supplied by Merrill Lynch, then began aggressively acquiring numerous regional grocery store chains for Safeway in a rollup strategy. Early acquisitions included significant parts of Piggly Wiggly chain as part of the breakup of that company by Merrill Lynch and Wall Street.

Most transactions involved the swap of stock certificates, with little cash changing hands. Most acquired chains retained their own names until the mid-1930s.

In 1929, there were rumors of a Safeway-Kroger merger. In late 2022, 93 years later, this merger became another possibility with the announced merger of Albertsons Companies and Kroger Co.

The number of stores peaked at 3,400 in 1932, when expansion ground to a halt. The Great Depression had finally impacted the chain, which began to focus on cost control. In addition, numerous smaller grocery stores were being replaced with larger supermarket stores. By 1933, the chain ranked second in the grocery industry behind The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company and ahead of Kroger.

In 1935, Safeway sold its nine stores in Honolulu, Hawaii, &quot;because of the inconvenience of proper supervision&quot;. Also in 1935, independent groceries in California convinced the California legislature to enact a progressive tax on chain stores. Before the act took effect, Safeway filed a petition to have the law put to a referendum. In 1936, the California electorate voted to repeal the law.

In 1936, Safeway introduced a money back guarantee on meat.


===International expansion===
The company expanded into Canada in 1929 with 127 stores (which became Canada Safeway Limited and which was sold to Sobeys in 2013), into the United Kingdom in 1962 (which became Safeway plc), into Australia in 1963 (which became Safeway Australia), and into West Germany in 1964. The company also has operations in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in a licensing and management agreement with the Tamimi Group during the 1980s. In 1981, it acquired 49% of Mexican retailer Casa Ley.

Safeway usually achieved international expansion by acquiring one or more small chains in a given country. It expanded into Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, however, through a joint venture. This initial nucleus of stores received Safeway systems and technology and then expanded organically. International chains acquired include:

===1940s–1970s===


In 1941, Marion B. Skaggs retired from the Safeway board of directors.

In 1947, the company&#x27;s sales exceeded $1 billion for the first time. By 1951, total sales had reached nearly $1.5 billion. The company adopted the S logo, which it still uses, in 1962.

In 1955, Robert A. Magowan became Chairman of the Board of Safeway. Magowan had married Charles Merrill&#x27;s daughter, Doris. Magowan also assumed the title of President in 1956. He remained president until 1968 and a member of the board until 1978. In 1966, Robert A Magowan brought his star meat processing plant manager, Michael F. Concannon, to Oakland to become the Head of Meat Processing in North America. He retired in 1978 as well. Mike was instrumental in opening the Stockton plant. The Wichita plant and meat processing in Canada began in the 1970s.

In 1959, Safeway opened its first store in the new state of Alaska – the first major food retailer to enter that market. The company opened three stores in Anchorage and one in Fairbanks over the next several years. The store in downtown Fairbanks was built on the site of a red-light district, known as &quot;The Line,&quot; which operated for close to a half century. Most of these stores were in buildings constructed by Anchorage real estate developer Wally Hickel, who later became governor of Alaska and U.S. Secretary of the Interior.

Also in 1959, designed by architects Wurster, Bernardi &amp; Emmons,&lt;ref name=&quot;sfchronicle/4397294&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;roadarch/food2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;andrewturnbull/safeway2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the firm also opened the first &quot;marina-style&quot; store on the Marina in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=&quot;thrillist/safeway-nicknames&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate/2588666&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
The exterior mosaic murals on the east side of the building were created by John Garth. The murals depict food being transported from the four corners of the globe. Garth created murals for three other Safeway stores.
Hundreds of stores in this barrel-vaulted-roof style opened during the next decade.

In 1961, the company sold its New York operations to Finast. In 1963, Safeway again opened stores in Hawaii, having exited this market in 1934. It leased one store in Culver City to animator/filmmaker Don Bluth, who used it as a theater until 1967.

In 1969, Safeway entered the Toronto market in Canada and the Houston market in Texas through opening new stores, rather than by acquisition. The firm ultimately failed against entrenched competition in both these markets.

In 1977, Safeway management instituted a program to fight counterfeit $100 bills by, among other things, telling employees that bills that lacked the words &quot;In God We Trust&quot; were counterfeit. Because Safeway had not sufficiently investigated the history of $100 bills, it was unaware that some bills still in circulation did not have the phrase. Eventually, an innocent shopper was incorrectly reported to Oakland, California, police for passing a &quot;counterfeit&quot; bill. He was arrested and strip-searched before Oakland police contacted the Treasury Department and realized the error. The 1981 jury verdict of joint and several liability for $45,000 against Safeway Stores and the City of Oakland was upheld in full by the Supreme Court of California on December 26, 1986.

In 1979, Peter Magowan, son of Robert Magowan and grandson of Charles Merrill, was appointed chairman and CEO of Safeway. Magowan managed Safeway for the next 13 years – presiding over the dramatic decline of the firm in terms of store numbers

===1980s: Takeover and sell-offs===
Following a hostile takeover bid from corporate raiders Herbert and Robert Haft, the chain was acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) acting as a white knight in 1986. With the assistance of KKR, the company was taken private and assumed tremendous debt. To pay off this debt, the company began selling off a large number of its operating divisions.

The divested domestic divisions of Safeway proved to be problematic for almost all those who acquired them. Essentially every purchasing entity hit financial troubles and either went bankrupt or was later acquired. (Hy-Vee and Fareway are the exceptions with the locations they acquired, having made them work.)

The international stores were more successful for their acquirers. Safeway plc, the operator of the UK stores, was sold to Argyll Foods, which itself was ultimately absorbed by Morrisons in 2004. Safeway Australia was sold to the Australian-based Woolworths Limited in 1985.

Safeway sold its stores in Southern California, including those in established markets like Los Angeles and San Diego, to the Vons Companies in 1988 in exchange for a 30 percent interest in the company. Safeway also scaled back its operations in Fresno, Modesto, Stockton, and Sacramento. Save Mart Supermarkets purchased the few remaining Fresno Safeway stores in 1996.

Many stores in the Eastern Division were also closed or sold in the 1987–1989 time frame, including many recent additions in the DelMarVa Eastern Shore area.

Safeway&#x27;s national presence was now reduced to several western states and Northern California, plus the Washington, D.C. area. Altogether, nearly half the 2,200 stores in the chain were sold.

===Expansion in the 1990s===

The company was taken public again in 1990, with the Jordan stores sold to the Masri family in 1991. In December 2003, the Masri family sold it to The Sultan Center of Kuwait. The late 1990s and early 2000s once again saw Safeway rapidly expand into new territories under a variety of regional names. In 1997, Safeway bought out the rest of the Vons Companies, giving it Southern California stores once more. In 1998, Chicago-based Dominick&#x27;s Finer Foods was acquired from Yucaipa Companies. While Safeway had stores in Alaska, in 1999 they bought Carrs-Safeway, with the same year bringing the purchase of Houston-based Randall&#x27;s Food Markets, which also had stores in Austin, Texas. Randalls also had stores in the Dallas-Fort Worth area through Randalls&#x27; other brand, Tom Thumb, along with gourmet grocery store Simon David. The purchase of Randalls also started the practice of Safeway-owned gas stations, as Randalls already had stations at their stores.

In 2000, Safeway started grocery delivery operations and in 2001 acquired the family-owned Genuardi&#x27;s chain, with locations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. While Safeway also created the subsidiary Blackhawk Network, a prepaid and payments network, a card-based financial solutions company, and a provider of third-party prepaid cards, around this time, Genuardi&#x27;s would be the last grocery purchase Safeway would make.

===Lifestyle stores===

By the early 2000s, Safeway&#x27;s expansion beyond the West Coast had been poorly received, citing Safeway&#x27;s brands and West Coast-based buyers, with Dominick&#x27;s on the sale block, and Randalls and Genuardi&#x27;s losing market share.

To reinvigorate the flagging divisions, increase brand involvement, and to differentiate itself from its competitor, Safeway began a $100 million brand repositioning campaign labeled &quot;Ingredients for life&quot; in 2005.

The launch included a redesigned logo, a new slogan &quot;Ingredients for life&quot; alongside a four-panel life icon to be used throughout stores and advertising, and a web application called &quot;FoodFlex&quot; to improve consumer nutrition. Many locations are being converted to the &quot;Lifestyle&quot; format. The new look was designed by Michigan-based PPC Design. In addition to the &quot;inviting decor with warm ambiance and subdued lighting&quot;, the move required heavy redesign of store layout, new employee uniforms, sushi and olive bars, and the addition of in-store Starbucks kiosks (with cupholders on grocery carts). The change also involved differentiating the company from competitors with promotions based on the company&#x27;s extensive loyalty card database. This would be the design going forward for new and remodeled stores.

At the end of 2004, there were 142 &quot;Lifestyle&quot; format stores in the United States and Canada, with plans to open or remodel another 300 stores with this type of theme the following year. &quot;Lifestyle&quot; format stores have seen significantly higher average weekly sales than its other stores. By the end of 2006, shares were up, proving this rebranding campaign had a major impact on sale figures.

In July 2007, the company stock rose on speculation that Sears Holdings Corporation was seeking to purchase Safeway.

In 2011, Safeway signed an agreement with UNFI, for the distribution to all of Safeway&#x27;s banners in the United States for non-proprietary natural, organic and specialty products effective October 2011.

===Decline and sale to Albertsons===

The Genuardi&#x27;s stores in Wilmington, Delaware, were converted to the Safeway name in 2004 due to legal issues stemming from a union contract signed by the management of early Safeway stores in Delaware that closed in 1982. The current Safeway locations in Delaware are served by division offices in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area, where Safeway has long been a major grocer.

In 2012, the company dissolved the Genuardi&#x27;s chain in the Philadelphia metro through a combination of store selloffs and closures. Giant acquired 15 of the chain&#x27;s stores and made an offer for a 16th which was instead sold to a local chain, McCaffrey&#x27;s, as part of an antitrust settlement. Weis also bought three Genuardi&#x27;s locations. A number of unprofitable Genuardi&#x27;s units also had closed in 2010 and 2011 as their leases expired.
Also in 2012, Safeway&#x27;s then-current CEO, Steve Burd, agreed to build Theranos blood-testing locations at 800 locations, at the cost of $350 million. The vision was to have blood test results done by checkout. Ultimately, the deal failed, and the company and CEO Burd suffered heavy financial losses as a result. In the years following the project termination, all of the spaces designed for Theranos&#x27; labs were either converted into Quest Diagnostics drug testing clinics or pharmacy waiting rooms for vaccine customers, or the stores in whole were permanently closed.

In 2013, it was announced that Cerberus Capital Management were exploring a deal for all or part of Safeway. On June 12, 2013, Sobeys announced it would acquire Safeway&#x27;s operations in Canada for CAD$5.8 billion, subject to regulatory approval. The move will bolster its presence in Western Canada, where Safeway was predominant. Sobeys completed the sale five months later while keeping the Safeway banner on its newly acquired stores while changing private labels to be more inline with those used by its new parent.

In October 2013, Safeway announced that it would close and sell its remaining Dominick&#x27;s stores in the Chicago area by early 2014. The announcement spurred its competitors to seek employees and desirable store locations they could purchase. One location would remain open in Bannockburn, Illinois, until January 25, 2014.

On February 19, 2014, Safeway began to explore selling itself. On March 6, 2014, longtime rival Albertsons, backed by Cerberus Capital Management announced it would purchase Safeway for $9.4 billion in a deal expected to close in the 4th quarter of the year. Many of Safeway&#x27;s private brands and IT systems were integrated and replaced Albertsons legacy equipment. As part of the purchase, Blackhawk Network was spun off into an independent company. Blackhawk remained Safeway&#x27;s sole gift card provider until 2021, when Albertsons switched to InComm for branded gift cards and network activation. Blackhawk continued to provide Safeway with store gift cards and store credit until January 5, 2023, at which point the remaining Blackhawk cards were taken offline (though cards activated prior to this point will not expire until 2037).

===Safeway as a supermarket brand===

On January 30, 2015, the merger between Safeway and Albertsons was finalized. As part of the merger, Bellingham, Washington-headquartered grocery chain Haggen announced it would buy 146 Vons, Albertsons, and Pavilions stores across Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, and Arizona as part of anti-monopoly requirements following the merger. Some of the major metropolitan areas affected were Los Angeles, Portland, Phoenix, Tucson, San Diego, Bakersfield, Seattle, and Las Vegas. Other stores in the West Coast, along with the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex market, also saw divestments.

Following the purchase, Safeway and its remaining brands, Randalls, Tom Thumb, Vons, and Pavilions, along with their respective divisions, were integrated into the operations of Albertsons, and Safeway&#x27;s proprietary food products were distributed in all of the Albertsons-Safeway banners, replacing Albertsons&#x27; SuperValu branded products. All former Albertsons banners had their telephones and NCR POS systems replaced with Safeway&#x27;s Toshiba/IBM hardware.

On January 11, 2016, it was announced that the three remaining Albertsons stores in Florida, located in Largo, Altamonte Springs and Oakland Park, would be re-bannered as Safeway; this marks the first time that the Safeway brand would exist on a supermarket operation in Florida. These stores were short lived, as Albertsons later abandoned their Florida operations and sold the stores to Publix in 2018.

In November 2016, Safeway Inc. agreed to buy Andronico&#x27;s remaining stores, which were based primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area. When Andronico&#x27;s closed as an independent company, it had a total of nine locations: three in Berkeley (Solano Avenue, Telegraph Avenue, and Shattuck Avenue); one in the Rancho Shopping Center in Los Altos; one on Irving Street San Francisco; one at the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto; one in Walnut Creek; one in Danville; and one in town of San Anselmo in Marin County. The stores began closing in January 2017, with the North Berkeley, California store closing first. In February 2019, Safeway said that it was considering bringing back the Andronico&#x27;s name. By February 2020, six Safeway stores were operating under the Andronico&#x27;s Community Market label, with a seventh planned. Four Andronico’s stores in the Bay Area were renamed Safeway Community Market after the 2016 acquisition, though the flagship store in the Sunset District kept the Andronico’s name. Another store in Monterey opened in January 2019 as Andronico’s. In February 2020, four locations of Safeway Community Markets returned to the Andronico’s name - two in Berkeley, one in Los Altos, and one in San Anselmo. Today the stores operate as a special District within the Northern California division, which allows the management team to operate the stores more similarly to how Andronico&#x27;s ran when it was an independent company.

Beginning in 2018, Safeway and Albertsons began remodeling stores with a new theme that moved away from the &quot;Lifestyle&quot; decor first introduced in the early 2000s. The new theme features brighter colors and tiled backsplashes on department signage. The company has also begun to replace most of its lighting setup in favor of LEDs. Most older stores used fluorescent tubes in the main aisles with halogen spotlights in the departments or to accent display cases for a relaxed ambiance. The new standard is LED retrofit tubes for the old fluorescent fixtures, and completely replacing the halogen spot lamps with LED strips or office-style ceiling fixtures that focus on overall illumination instead of targeted, accented lighting. They also replaced lighting in employee areas and offices throughout 2021.

In 2019, Safeway was ordered by a judge to pay a fine of $12 million after a Santa Clara County, California cashier was denied the right to sit. California state law guarantees the right of workers to have &quot;suitable seats&quot;.

In August 2021, Safeway launched FreshPass, a paid subscription service that allows for free unlimited delivery/pickup and gives members exclusive discounts and offers. The program was launched with a refreshed mobile app that supports scan-and-pay shopping in select markets. Safeway also activated QR payments and digital receipts with the updated mobile app. The &quot;Just for U&quot; rewards program (commonly branded J4U), first launched in 2012, was simplified to &quot;for u&quot; as part of the FreshPass launch.

Other Albertsons stores in various markets have rebranded as Safeway, including Denver and Seattle.

In October 2022, Albertsons and its competitor, Kroger, which also operates King Soopers and City Market stores, announced a merger agreement. Following initial opposition, the two parent companies said they would sell 400+ stores to a competitor, C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers. Regardless, the planned merger has been challenged in court by a couple of states. In February 2024, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a lawsuit; he summarized consumer and worker opposition: the merger &quot;would lead to stores closing, higher prices, fewer jobs, worse customer service, and less resilient supply chains.”

==Private brands==
In 2006, Safeway introduced an organically grown and processed line of products named &quot;O Organics&quot;. The brand has proved successful, with yearly sales surpassing $1 billion in 2017. Open Nature was launched in 2011, and has also proved successful enough that Open Nature has absorbed some other previous private brands (Such as Bright Green, Signature Home, and Lucerne Plant-Based products).

After its acquisition by Albertsons, the combined company adopted Safeway&#x27;s private label brand program, changed the name from &quot;Safeway Select&quot; to &quot;Signature Select&quot;, and updated the branding and packaging for all of their products.

==Grocery delivery==
Safeway has offered online grocery delivery service in select markets starting in the American Northwest region in 2000. The service grew to deliver in six states and the District of Columbia, mostly along the west and east coast. Safeway has rapidly expanded the number of locations offering contactless curbside pickup (marketed as &quot;DriveUp &amp; Go&quot;), and continues to offer traditional prescheduled delivery services along with on-demand deliveries filled via Instacart and DoorDash.

In January 2021, Albertsons announced that it would be laying off union company-employed grocery delivery drivers at Safeway stores in the Northern California region, stating that they would be transferring those services to app-based delivery platforms, such as Instacart. This decision only affected employees working in the &#x27;traditional&#x27; scheduled delivery department inside the stores, and all employees were offered other positions within the company.

==Past concepts==
Safeway throughout the decades has ventured and experimented with different concepts and themes for its locations and stores.

In 1963, Safeway developed the Super S format – which combined a general merchandise and drug store and a new Safeway supermarket in the same building. The stores shared a common entrance, but operated as separate businesses with their own checkstands. The first outlet opened in Anchorage, Alaska. In 1965, 22 existing Super S stores were sold to Skaggs Drug Stores. Safeway sold the remaining stores in 1971.

In 1964, Safeway opened a trial two-level International Store at 12th and F Street in Washington, D.C., with a conventional Safeway downstairs and a gourmet store on the upper floor. The Safeway International Store range included wild boar steaks, snow hare, suckling pig, and reindeer steaks.

The company also made a number of attempts to repurpose older, smaller store sites, opening Food Barn, a discount grocery outlet, and Liquor Barn, a discount liquor outlet, in the 1970s. Safeway also trialed Town House in Washington, D.C., small stores targeting apartment dwellers, and a gourmet store concept, Bon Appetit in San Francisco and Tiburon, California.

In 1969, Safeway formed a joint venture with Holly Farms Poultry Industries (now part of Tyson Foods) to open Holly Farms Fried Chicken in an effort to diversify into fast food restaurants and compete with KFC. The first store opened in Colonial Heights, Virginia in August 1969.

Safeway also acquired Pak &#x27;n Save Foods, a box warehouse concept, as part of the 1983 purchase of Brentwood in Northern California. While these stores were initially distinct in price points and bulk sales, today they are functionally and operationally the same as regular Safeway supermarkets. As of 2025, two Pak &#x27;n Save locations remain in San Leandro and Emeryville; all of the other locations have been either permanently closed or remodeled into standard Safeway locations.

===Store Music/Intercom Announcements===
Safeway music is provided by Stingray Advertising. The network beams commercials and advertisements for Safeway products and services that play intermittently with the music. The store&#x27;s unique &quot;Attention Service Desk&quot; announcements, which are used to communicate phone calls on hold to employees, are generated by Cisco&#x27;s Call Manager Server as an overhead announcement.

=== Animal welfare concerns ===
In 2012, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at Christensen Farms, a pork supplier to Safeway, Walmart, Costco, Kroger, and Kmart. Before the public release of Mercy for Animals&#x27; investigation at Christensen Farms, Safeway announced it would begin requiring pork suppliers to phase out gestation crates.

In 2008, Greenpeace started ranking America&#x27;s major supermarket chains on their seafood sustainability practices because, according to Phil Radford, Greenpeace U.S. CEO, &quot;three quarters of global fish stocks are suffering from overfishing, and 90% of top marine predators are already gone&quot;. Criteria included the number of threatened fish species supermarkets sold, their seafood purchasing policies, and ocean legislation policies it supported. Greenpeace annual Carting Away the Oceans (CATO) report ranks supermarkets on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being least sustainable with seafood policies and 10 being the most sustainable with seafood policies. Safeway ranked second best (7.1 out of 10) on the 2013 CATO Report by ensuring that its store brand of canned tuna was sustainably fished and by lobbying for science-based ocean conservation policies.

In 2016, Safeway parent company Albertsons joined a growing wave of companies moving toward &quot;cage-free&quot; egg production and announced a planned shift to cage-free eggs by 2025 following campaigns by The Humane League, Mercy for Animals, The Humane Society of the United States, and others. Following the passage of California Proposition 12, Lucerne and O Organics switched to full cage-free egg production at their facilities in California in January 2022.

<text>(also known as the Sega Sammy Group or simply as Sega Sammy) is a Japanese global holding company and conglomerate formed from the merger of Sega and Sammy Corporation in 2004. Both companies are involved in the amusement industry (Sega with arcade and home video games, Sammy with pachinko machines).

== Corporate history ==
=== Sega ===

Sega was founded on June 3, 1960, by American businessman Martin Bromley. The company started to distribute slot machines to U.S. bases in Japan. During the 1960s, Service Games was renamed to Sega Enterprises Ltd. Sega Enterprises sold their first product, the electro-mechanical game called &quot;Periscope&quot; which became a worldwide hit. In 1969, Sega Enterprises was acquired by U.S. conglomerate Gulf and Western Industries (which also owned the famed movie studio Paramount Pictures around this time). In 1983, Sega launched the Sega Computer Videogame SG-1000, the first 8-bit video game platform. In 1986, a management buyout, led by Computer Service acquired Sega Enterprises through capital participation. Sega Europe Ltd. was established in Europe, and in 1985, Sega Enterprises, Inc. was established in the United States. These regional subsidiaries served as a marketing base for amusement arcade machines.

During 1985, Sega released &quot;Hang-On&quot;, the world&#x27;s first force feedback game. Sega Enterprises was registered stock on over-the-counter (OTC) market. In 1988, Sega listed stock on the second section of Tokyo Stock Exchange. Within this year, Sega released the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, a 16-bit home video game platform that solidified Sega&#x27;s presence in the console market. During this year, Sega also launched the R-360, the world&#x27;s first amusement arcade cabinet could rotate 360 degrees in all directions. In 1991, Sega released &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; as a competitor mascot to represent Sega against Nintendo&#x27;s Mario, and with 15 million copies sold, Sonic the Hedgehog spawned multiple sequels over the years and became Sega&#x27;s flagship franchise.

In 1992, Sega released &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; in order to utilise polygonal 3D-graphics engines, and in 1993, Sega released &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, the world&#x27;s first polygonal 3D fighting game. In 1994, Sega launched the Sega Saturn, a 32-bit home video game platform. In 1995, Sega launched Print Club Arcades in partnership with Atlus. In 1996, Sega released &quot;Sakura Wars&quot;, a Japan exclusive sim-based Strategy RPG that became a cultural phenomenon within Japan, spawning a multi-media franchise. In 1997, Sega attempted to merge with toy manufacturer Bandai with Sega as the surviving entity (which would be named Sega Bandai following the merger), but the deal eventually fell through. In 1998, Sega launched the Sega Dreamcast. In 2000, Sega Enterprises changed their name to Sega Corporation. During this year, Sega released &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot;, the first networked role-playing game (RPG) for home video game platforms. In 2001, Sega discontinued the Dreamcast and withdrew from the console hardware industry to become a third-party video game developer and publisher.

=== Sammy Corporation ===

Sammy Corporation was founded on November 1, 1975, as Sammy Industry Co., Ltd. by Japanese business magnate, Hajime Satomi. It was formed from Satomi Corporation&#x27;s manufacturing and marketing divisions for amusement arcade machines. In the 1980s, Sammy marketed and sold Pachislot machines, and in the 1990s, Sammy expanded their portfolio by marketing and selling Pachinko machines. These two business ventures have been the primary pillar of Sammy Corporations revenue. During 1997, Sammy Industry Co., Ltd. changed its name to Sammy Corporation. By 2000, Sammy Corporation was listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange&#x27;s 1st section, indicating it as a &quot;large company&quot;. Outside of Pachinko and Pachislot industry, Sammy Corporation was also involved in the video game industry as a publisher for fighting games such as the &quot;Guilty Gear&quot; series (developed by Arc System Works), &quot;The Rumble Fish&quot; series (developed by Dimps) and &quot;Survival Arts&quot;.

=== Formation ===
In February 2003, Sega and Sammy announced their intentions to merge. Sammy president Hajime Satomi would head the new company. However, this deal ultimately fell apart. In the year following, Sammy purchased 22.4% of Sega, forced out several Sega executives, and installed Satomi as chairman. By May 2004, the two companies announced a new merger, though this was essentially a takeover of Sega by Sammy. Sega president Hisao Oguchi was named vice president of the new company.

According to the first Sega Sammy &quot;Annual Report&quot;, the merger happened due to the companies facing financial difficulties. According to chairman Hajime Satomi, Sega had been in the red for nearly 10 years and lacked a clear financial base. Sammy, on the other hand, feared stagnation and overreliance of its highly profitable pachislot and pachinko machine business, and wanted to diversify its business in new fields, using Sega&#x27;s broader range of involvement in different entertainment fields.

=== Beginning of operations ===
In 2005, Sega Europe acquired British studio The Creative Assembly. That same year, Sega Sammy acquired 50.2% voting shares of animation studio and entertainment company TMS Entertainment, converting the company into a consolidated subsidiary. Sega Sammy previously held a minority stake in TMS, which was inherited from Sega. In 2006, Sega Europe purchased Sports Interactive.

On December 22, 2010, Sega Sammy Holdings acquired the remaining outstanding shares of TMS Entertainment, Sammy NetWorks, and Sega Toys, thus making all three companies, wholly owned subsidiaries of Sega Sammy Holdings. In April 2017, Marza Animation Planet, Sega&#x27;s CGI animation studio, was restructured into TMS Entertainment.

Together, as the Sega Sammy group, the company has grown and acquired and founded multiple companies.

=== Restructuring ===
Until 2015, the group was structured in four areas:
* The &quot;Consumer Business&quot;, which contained video games, toys and animation.
* The &quot;Amusement Machine Business&quot; which contained Sega&#x27;s arcade business.
* The &quot;Amusement Center Business&quot; which contained Sega&#x27;s amusement centers and theme parks.
* The &quot;Pachislot and Pachinko Business&quot; is the Sammy Corporation and is the main pillar of the group&#x27;s revenue.

For the better half of the first decade of the holding&#x27;s existence it has sought the arcade machine sales of Sega and the pachinko sales of Sammy, as its biggest financial incentive. A shift happened in the 2010s, leading to the &quot;Group Structure Reform&quot; in 2015. Casinos, resorts and digital games became the biggest financial incentives. Arcade sales and packaged games from Sega has softened, while growth in pachinko sales is not anticipated. By this point, Sega Sammy restructured into three business units: Entertainment Contents (which compromises of the company&#x27;s video game, animation, amusement and toy companies, all under Sega Holdings), Pachinko &amp; Pachislot (compromising of the company&#x27;s gambling business, under Sammy) and Resort (compromising of the company&#x27;s resort and casino assets).

=== Post-restructuring ===
On November 4, 2020, it was announced that Sega Sammy would sell 85.1% of Sega Entertainment, its arcade operating business, to Genda Inc., an amusement equipment rental business, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on its arcade and amusement facilities businesses. Sega will still be involved in the arcade machine manufacturing business.

On January 29, 2021, Sega Sammy announced that it would restructure and split its corporate functions for their businesses which occurred at the beginning of the 2022 fiscal year. That same year, it was announced that Sega Sammy would be a kit sponsor for J2 League club Tokyo Verdy, and their women&#x27;s team, Nippon TV Tokyo Verdy Beleza, and also sponsored a Tokyo Classic match on September 26, 2021, between Verdy and crosstown rival FC Machida Zelvia.

Sega Sammy Holdings announced in April that they have made a €706 million ($776 million USD) offer to acquire Rovio Entertainment. Rovio rejected an earlier acquisition bid from Israeli mobile company Playtika for $800 million. The deal closed on 17 August 2023, making the latter company a wholly owned subsidiary of Sega.

In November 2023, Sega Sammy Creation announced that it would acquire sports betting company, GAN Limited, for the price of $1.97 per share pending regulatory approval.

In January 2024, Sega Sammy announced that it would transfer the Amusement Machine business of Sega to Sega Toys, while also changing the name of Sega Toys to Sega Fave Corporation, which is scheduled to take effect during April of 2024. In order for the company to focus more on its core businesses, the company&#x27;s board has elected that it would sell Phoenix Segaia Resort to Fortress Investment Group on May 10 that same year pending regulatory approval. 

In July 2024, Sega Sammy announced it would acquire Dutch online gambling platform Stakelogic for $141 million, pending regulatory approval with the transaction set to close by the 2026 fiscal year.

== Business structure ==
Sega Sammy&#x27;s business consists of three segments, which covers entertainment contents (including video games, animation and toys), pachinko &amp; pachislot and casino &amp; resort.
=== Entertainment contents business ===
The entertainment contents business provides a diverse range of entertainment from digital content to toys. These are the companies and subsidiaries affiliated with the Sega Sammy Group&#x27;s entertainment contents business.

<text>The Washington Nationals are an American professional baseball team based in Washington, D.C. The Nationals compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) East Division. They play their home games at Nationals Park, located on South Capitol Street in the Navy Yard neighborhood of the Southeast quadrant of D.C. along the Anacostia River.

The Nationals are the eighth major league franchise to be based in Washington, D.C., and the first since 1971. The current franchise was founded in 1969 as the Montreal Expos as part of a four-team expansion. After a failed contraction plan, MLB bought the Expos, seeking to move the team to a new city. MLB owners chose Washington, D.C. in 2004 and established the Nationals the next year, in the first MLB franchise move since 1971 when the third Washington Senators moved to Arlington, Texas, to become the Texas Rangers. No other MLB team would move until the 2025 season, when the Oakland Athletics relocated to Sacramento in advance of their ultimately planned move to the Las Vegas metropolitan area.

While the team initially struggled after moving to Washington, the Nationals enjoyed considerable success throughout the 2010s. The team had back-to-back first overall picks in the MLB draft in 2009 and 2010, selecting Stephen Strasburg and Bryce Harper. The team secured their first playoff berth and first division title in and won the National League East again in , , and , but failed to advance past the NLDS each time. In 2019, the team advanced to the World Series as a Wild Card team and defeated the Houston Astros in seven games to earn their first championship.

As of the end of the 2024 season, the franchise&#x27;s overall win–loss record is (). Since moving to Washington, D.C., their overall win–loss record is 1,510–1,626 ()

==History==
===Early baseball in Washington, D.C.===

Multiple short-lived baseball franchises, including two named the Nationals, played in Washington with the National Association in the 1870s. The first Washington Nationals team in a major league played in the American Association in 1884. Another Washington Nationals team also played in the Union Association during its only season in 1884. The first Washington Nationals of the National League played from 1886 to 1889.

===Washington Senators / Statesmen / Nationals===

The Washington Statesmen played in the American Association in 1891, before jumping to the National League as the Senators the following season. The Washington Senators, who were often referred to as the Nationals, played in the National League from 1892 to 1899. They were followed in 1901 by another Washington Senators franchise — a charter member of the new American League — who were officially named the Washington Nationals from 1905 to 1955. In 1912, another Washington Senators team formed as one of eight teams of the United States Baseball League. But the league and the team folded after just over a month of play in 1912.

The first American League Senators franchise moved to Minneapolis after the 1960 season and became the Minnesota Twins. MLB awarded Washington an expansion team, the second American League Senators franchise, which began play in 1961 but moved to Arlington, Texas after the 1971 season to become the Texas Rangers.

===Montreal Expos===

The Montreal Expos were part of the 1969 Major League Baseball expansion, which included the Seattle Pilots (now the Milwaukee Brewers), Kansas City Royals, and San Diego Padres. Based in Montreal, the Expos were the first Major League team in Canada and were named after the Expo 67 World&#x27;s Fair.

The majority-share owner was Charles Bronfman, a major shareholder in Seagram. The Expos&#x27; initial home was Jarry Park. Under manager Gene Mauch, the team lost 110 games in their first season, coincidentally matching the Padres&#x27; inaugural win–loss record, and continued to struggle during their first decade with sub-.500 seasons.

In 1977, the Expos moved into Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium, which was built for the 1976 Summer Olympics. Two years later, the team won a franchise-high 95 games, finishing second in the NL East. The Expos began the 1980s with a core group of young players, including catcher Gary Carter, outfielders Tim Raines and Andre Dawson, third baseman Tim Wallach, and pitchers Steve Rogers and Bill Gullickson. The team won its only division championship in the strike-shortened split season of 1981, ending its season with a three-games-to-two loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Championship Series.

The team spent most of the 1980s in the middle of the NL East pack, finishing in third or fourth place in eight out of nine seasons from 1982 to 1990. The Expos hired Buck Rodgers as manager before the 1985 season, and he guided the team to winning records five times in six years, with the highlight coming in 1987 when they won 91 games (.562). They finished third, but were just four games behind the division-winning Cardinals.

Bronfman sold the team to a consortium of owners in 1991, with Claude Brochu as the managing general partner. The new ownership replaced Rodgers, at that time second only to Gene Mauch in number of Expos games managed, partway through the 1991 season. In May 1992, the Expos promoted Felipe Alou, a member of the Expos organization since 1976, to become the first Dominican-born manager in MLB history. Alou would go on to be the franchise leader in games managed while guiding the team to winning records, including 1994 when the Expos, led by a talented group of players including Larry Walker, Moisés Alou, Marquis Grissom and Pedro Martínez, had the best record in the major leagues until the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike forced the cancellation of the remainder of the season. After the disappointment of 1994, Expos management began shedding its key players and the team&#x27;s fan support dwindled.

Brochu sold control of the team to Jeffrey Loria in 1999, but Loria failed to secure funding to build a new downtown ballpark and did not reach an agreement on television or English radio broadcast contracts for the 2000 season, reducing the team&#x27;s media coverage.

===Proposed 2001 contraction===

After the 2001 season, MLB considered revoking the team&#x27;s franchise, along with that of either the Minnesota Twins or the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. In November 2001, Major League Baseball&#x27;s owners voted 28–2 to contract the league by two teams — according to various sources, the Expos and the Minnesota Twins, both of which reportedly voted against contraction. Subsequently, the Boston Red Sox were sold to a partnership led by John W. Henry, owner of the Florida Marlins. In order to clear the way for Henry&#x27;s group to assume Red Sox ownership, Henry sold the Marlins to Loria who in turn sold the Expos to MLB. However, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, the Metrodome&#x27;s operator, won an injunction requiring the Twins to play there in 2002. MLB&#x27;s inability to revoke the Twins franchise compelled it to keep both the Twins and Expos as part of the regular season schedule. The collective bargaining agreement signed with the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) in August 2002 prohibited contraction until the end of the contract in 2006. By that time, the Expos had become the Washington Nationals and the Twins had made sufficient progress towards the eventual building of a new baseball-specific stadium that contraction was no longer on the agenda.

===2005 move===
With contraction no longer an option in the immediate term, MLB began looking for a new site for the Expos. Some of the choices included Oklahoma City; Washington, D.C.; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Monterrey, Mexico; Portland, Oregon; Northern Virginia (such as Arlington or Dulles); Norfolk, Virginia; Las Vegas; and Charlotte, North Carolina. Washington, D.C., and both Virginia locations emerged as the front-runners.

On September 29, 2004, MLB announced that the Expos would move to Washington, D.C. for the 2005 season, returning professional baseball to the United States&#x27;s capital. On November 15, arbitrators struck down a lawsuit former team owners brought against MLB and former majority owner Jeffrey Loria, bringing to an end all legal actions that could have impeded a move. The other MLB team owners approved the move to Washington, D.C., in a 28–1 vote on December 3 (Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos cast the sole dissenting vote).

Although there was some sentiment to revive the name Senators when the Expos moved to Washington in 2005, legal and political considerations factored into the choice of Nationals, a revival of the first American League franchise&#x27;s official name used from 1901 to 1956. Politicians and others in the District of Columbia objected to the name Senators because the District of Columbia does not have voting representation in Congress. In addition, the Rangers still owned the rights to the Senators name.
Washington, D.C. mayor Anthony A. Williams supported the name &quot;Washington Grays&quot; in honor of the Negro-league team Homestead Grays (1929–1950), which had been based in Pittsburgh but played most of their of their home games in Washington&#x27;s Griffith Stadium during much of the 1940s. On November 21, 2004, the team&#x27;s management chose the name &quot;Washington Nationals&quot;, revealing the club&#x27;s official colors of red, white, and blue the next day.

The Nationals played their first three seasons at RFK Stadium until Nationals Park could be built. Nationals Park was completed in 2008, and the Nationals played their first home game there on March 30, 2008. ESPN televised the game nationally, for which U.S. President George W. Bush threw out the first pitch. Ryan Zimmerman hit his fifth career walk-off home run to give the Nationals a win in the first game in their new stadium.

===Inaugural 2005 season===

The Nationals played their first game on April 4, 2005 at Citizens Bank Park in South Philadelphia, losing to the Philadelphia Phillies 8-4. The Nationals finished their inaugural season at .500 with an 81-81 record. Its first draft pick as the Nationals was Virginia native and University of Virginia graduate Ryan Zimmerman in the first round of the 2005 draft. Zimmerman made his MLB debut in 2005 and became one of the team&#x27;s best players and the face of the franchise, playing his entire career with the Nationals.

===2000s and 2010s===
When Ted Lerner took over the club in mid-2006, he hired Stan Kasten as team president. Kasten was widely known as the Atlanta Braves&#x27; architect before and during their run of 14 division titles. Kasten was also the General Manager or president of many other Atlanta-area sports teams, including the Atlanta Hawks and Atlanta Thrashers. &quot;The Plan&quot;, as it became known, was a long-range rebuilding and restructuring of the team from the ground up. This plan included investing in the farm system and the draft to build a team suitable for their new stadium.

In the front office, the Nationals hired well-respected former Arizona scouting director Mike Rizzo to be the Vice President of Baseball Operations, second in charge under then-general manager Jim Bowden.

The Nationals finished in last place in four out of five years from 2006–2010, but began building the foundations of a contender with their first-overall draft picks of pitcher Stephen Strasburg (in 2009) and catcher Bryce Harper, whom the team converted to the outfield, (in 2010), as well as their sixth-overall draft pick of infielder Anthony Rendon (in 2011). Strasburg, arguably the most hyped prospect in baseball history, struck out 14 batters in an unprecedented Major League debut at home against the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 2011, they signed Jayson Werth to the team&#x27;s first big free-agent contract. With a mix of homegrown players and players acquired via trade and free agency, the Nationals clinched their first playoff berth and first division title in 2012. Teenage phenom Harper was named NL Rookie of the Year, the youngest ever to win. The Nationals were knocked out of the 2012 NLDS by the St. Louis Cardinals in five games after the Cardinals took the lead with two outs in the top of the ninth of game 5. After missing the playoffs in 2013, they hired Matt Williams as manager and rebounded to win their second division title in 2014, but were eliminated in the 2014 NLDS by the San Francisco Giants. In 2014, they acquired shortstop prospect Trea Turner in a trade with the San Diego Padres, with Turner eventually becoming a major part of the Nationals&#x27; core. In 2015, the Nationals signed top free agent pitcher Max Scherzer to a 7-year, $210 million contract. That year, Harper had one of the greatest offensive seasons in MLB history, becoming the youngest player to win the NL MVP unanimously. However the Nationals missed the playoffs again, leading to Williams&#x27; firing. The team hired veteran manager Dusty Baker in 2016, and returned to the playoffs only to be eliminated by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2016 NLDS in five games. They won the NL East title in 2017, but were eliminated in the NLDS yet again after losing game 5 to the Chicago Cubs. Baker&#x27;s contract was not renewed after the 2017 playoff loss, and the team hired Dave Martinez as their sixth manager in ten years.

In 2018, the All-Star Game was played at Nationals Park. 19-year-old phenom Juan Soto had an exceptional debut campaign, finishing 2nd in NL Rookie of the Year Voting. The Nationals failed to make the playoffs in 2018, finishing a disappointing second in a year they were expected to sail to the playoffs. After the 2018 season, superstar slugger Bryce Harper left the team via free agency, signing with the rival Philadelphia Phillies.

===2019 World Series win===

The Nationals began the 2019 season with a record of 19–31, with their projected chances of winning the World Series at that time being 1.5 percent. They then posted a 74–38 record over the remaining 112 games, finishing with an overall record of 93-69 and earning a spot in the 2019 National League Wild Card Game, which they won over the Milwaukee Brewers 4–3. In the NLDS, the Nationals defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games, propelling them past the divisional round for the first time in franchise history. The Nationals then swept the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS, giving them their first NL pennant. The team then defeated the Houston Astros in game seven of the 2019 World Series, giving them their first World Series championship, with Strasburg being voted series MVP. The World Series was the first in MLB history that saw no team win a game at home, as the road team won all seven. The Nationals went a perfect 5-0 in elimination games during the playoffs, all of which were come-from-behind victories, the first team in MLB history to do so.

===Post-World Series===
Franchise cornerstone Anthony Rendon left in free agency for the Los Angeles Angels after the 2019 season. The Nationals agreed to re-sign fellow building block Stephen Strasburg to a massive seven-year deal that guaranteed him $245 million. However, injuries limited him to just 31 and 1/3 innings under the contract, and eventually forced him to retire in 2024. The Nationals struggled in 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic led to the season being shortened to 60 games; the team finished 26-34 and missed the playoffs. After another disappointing start to the 2021 season, in which the team was under .500 at the trade deadline, GM Mike Rizzo disassembled much of the team, trading ace pitcher Max Scherzer and superstar shortstop Trea Turner to the Dodgers, among many other trades of starting players in exchange for prospects, signifying the start of a rebuilding process. Ryan Zimmerman, the longtime face of the franchise who had been with the team since its inaugural 2005 season, announced his retirement after the 2021 season, marking the end of the first era of Nationals baseball. On August 2, 2022, the Nationals traded 23-year-old superstar Juan Soto to the San Diego Padres after he turned down a 15-year, $440 million contract extension offer, which would have constituted the richest contract in baseball history. In doing so, the Nationals lost its franchise icon and one of the last integral players from the 2019 championship team. The Nationals received one of the largest prospect hauls in any single trade in baseball history in return, with the front office hoping that the elite prospects would form the core of the next championship team. After trading Soto and others, the Nationals finished the 2022 season with the worst record in baseball at 55-107. That year proved to be the low point for the Nationals rebuild, as young players such as CJ Abrams and Josiah Gray led them to an improvement of 16 wins in 2023, finishing at 71-91. Additionally, the rebuild had strengthened a once-weak group of prospects. ESPN&#x27;s annual farm system ranking showed improvement from 30th entering 2021 to 22nd in 2022, 13th in 2023, and 16th in 2024. The Nationals ended the 2024 season with the same record as 2023 at 71-91. However, the rebuild progressed with top prospects James Wood, acquired via the Soto trade, and Dylan Crews, drafted #2 overall in 2023, making their debuts. Additionally, shortstop CJ Abrams, also acquired via the Soto trade, was selected to the 2024 All-Star Game.

In 2022, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the Lerner family was exploring a restructuring of the team&#x27;s ownership, including the possibility of selling the team outright. Ted Lerner died on February 13, 2023, from pneumonia complications; his son Mark had become the public-facing principal owner in 2018, though Ted had retained his full interest in the team&#x27;s decisions.

==Uniforms==
===2005–2008: Original uniforms===
The Nationals&#x27; original home uniforms contained the team name and numbers in red with gold bevels and navy trim, and were paired with the all-red &quot;curly W&quot; cap. The road uniforms contained the city name and numbers in navy with gold bevels and red trim, and were paired with the all-navy &quot;curly W&quot; cap. The front letters of both uniforms formed a distinct bridge-like shape. This set was joined the following season by a red alternate uniform, which featured the interlocking &quot;DC&quot; in white with gold bevels and navy trim, as well as numbers in navy with gold bevels and white trim. The red alternates were paired with the all-red &quot;DC&quot; cap.

The Nationals sported two different sleeve patches with this set. In their inaugural season, the patch featured gold accents, the full team name and two gold stars on the outer navy circle, and the interlocking &quot;DC&quot; on the inner red circle. The patch was tweaked the following season, eliminating the team name in favor of nine gold stars and relegating red to trim color.

===2009–2010: Road uniform changes===
For the 2009 season, the Nationals kept the same home uniform but unveiled a new road and red alternate uniform, along with a roundel-less &quot;DC&quot; sleeve patch. The road uniform now featured a script rendition of the city name in front minus the gold bevels, with the letters now rendered in red with navy and gold trim. The red alternate replaced the &quot;DC&quot; logo with the &quot;curly W&quot; logo, and numbers changed to white with gold bevels and navy trim.

===2011–2023: &quot;Curly W&quot; uniforms===
The Nationals unveiled a new uniform set starting in 2011. Gold was eliminated and the emphasis was on the &quot;curly W&quot; logo, which was prominently featured on the home and red alternate uniforms. The road all-navy cap was retired in a favor of a navy cap with red brim, and a new red cap with navy brim was added in 2013 for home games with the red alternates. The sleeve patch was updated to feature the primary roundel logo. Piping was added to the &quot;curly W&quot; uniforms.
===2018–present: Script &quot;Nationals&quot; uniforms===
In 2018, the Nationals released a navy alternate uniform, featuring a script rendition of the team&#x27;s name in white with red trim along with red numbers. The following season, the navy uniform proved to be a good-luck charm for the Nationals, as they went 11–3 while wearing the uniforms en route to winning the World Series. In 2020, a white version was added, with the script version of the team name in navy with red trim. Initially, the Nationals unveiled a pair of white-paneled and red-brimmed alternate caps: one in navy with the United States Capitol dome superimposed over a white block &quot;W&quot;, and another in red with a navy block &quot;W&quot; superimposed over the silhouette of a pitcher. Both designs paid homage to the original Washington Senators (now Minnesota Twins) and the expansion Washington Senators (now Texas Rangers). However, only the &quot;Capitol W&quot; cap was used, and the &quot;pitcher W&quot; cap was not utilized on the field at all and immediately retired.

For most of the 2020 season, the Nationals wore gold-accented versions of the new white uniforms in celebration of their World Series championship, along with all-red caps with the gold &quot;curly W&quot; logo. The script white alternates made their on-field debut on the final regular season home game September 27 against the New York Mets, and were paired with the &quot;Capitol W&quot; cap (the red &quot;curly W&quot; batting helmets were used with this uniform). The Nationals did not wear their home and red alternate &quot;curly W&quot; uniforms throughout that shortened season. In 2021, the white alternates were also paired with the primary red &quot;curly W&quot; cap, though the alternate Capitol cap was still used occasionally.

Starting in 2022, the white alternate uniform with the &quot;Nationals&quot; script became the primary home uniform, replacing the white &quot;curly W&quot; uniform.

In 2024, the Nationals updated their road uniform, featuring a block &quot;Washington&quot; lettering in navy with white and red trim. The red &quot;curly W&quot; alternates were replaced by an alternate white pullover uniform with navy sleeves, featuring the &quot;Capitol W&quot; crest on the left chest and a new sleeve patch depicting the &quot;interlocking DC&quot; logo inside the silhouette of Washington, D.C. The chest numbers on both the primary home and alternate navy uniforms were removed.

Ahead of the 2025 season, the Nationals brought back the red alternate uniform after a one-season absence. This iteration kept the &quot;Curly W&quot; logo on the left chest, but the piping was removed. Due to Nike&#x27;s &quot;4+1&quot; uniform rule, the team retired the &quot;Capitol W&quot; white alternates after only one season.

===City Connect uniform===
As part of MLB&#x27;s uniform deal with Nike, selected teams were given themed &quot;City Connect&quot; uniforms. The Nationals&#x27; version, unveiled in 2022, pay homage to the cherry blossoms that adorn Washington, D.C. in the spring. The design has a dark gray base with pink trim and printed cherry blossoms. The uniforms were worn during Friday and Saturday home games until 2024. After 2024, the City Connect uniforms were retired.

===Stars and Stripes alternates===
In 2009, the Nationals unveiled a navy alternate uniform for games that fell during Independence Day week. The uniform featured the &quot;interlocking DC&quot; logo rendered in the Stars and Stripes motif, along with white/red piping and white numbers with gold bevels and red trim. The original primary logo was added to the left sleeve, and a navy cap with red brim containing the aforementioned &quot;DC flag&quot; logo was used.

In 2011, the uniform was tweaked to feature the &quot;curly W&quot; in Stars and Stripes, along with updated logos and the removal of gold accents. The road navy cap was originally used with this uniform, but in 2016 it was replaced by a similar design, with the exception of the &quot;curly W&quot; which was now rendered in the Stars and Stripes. This design was used until 2019, during which the uniform was no longer exclusively worn on Independence Day week.

In 2017 a white version of the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; alternate was released; this one is paired with the navy-brimmed red cap featuring the &quot;curly W&quot; in Stars and Stripes.

===Baseball Hall of Famers===

===Ford C. Frick Award===
===Retired numbers===

During the franchise&#x27;s period in Montreal, the Montreal Expos retired three numbers in honor of four players, plus Jackie Robinson&#x27;s number 42 which was retired throughout all Major League Baseball in 1997. Following the move to Washington, D.C., the numbers (except 42) were returned to circulation and remain in use . When Washington wore Expos throwback jerseys on July 6, 2019, catcher Yan Gomes wore his usual number 10, even though the number was retired by the Expos for Andre Dawson and Rusty Staub.

After the Expos&#x27; departure from Montreal, the National Hockey League′s Montreal Canadiens hung a banner in Bell Centre honoring the Expos&#x27; retired numbers.

The Nationals retired Ryan Zimmerman&#x27;s No. 11 on June 18, 2022, the first number retired by the Nationals.

===Ring of Honor===
On August 10, 2010, the Nationals unveiled a &quot;Ring of Honor&quot; at Nationals Park to honor National Baseball Hall of Fame members who had played &quot;significant years&quot; for the Washington Nationals, original Washington Senators (1901–1960), expansion Washington Senators (1961–1971), Homestead Grays, or Montreal Expos. In late August 2016, the team dropped the criterion that an inductee be a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, also opening membership to &quot;anyone who has made a significant contribution to the game of baseball in Washington, D.C.&quot;; the first inductee under the revised criteria was Frank Howard.

The Nationals′ attempt to honor the Montreal-Washington franchise&#x27;s entire history in the Ring of Honor, as well as by tracking Montreal-Washington franchise records, is not without controversy; it has been criticized as &quot;an embodiment of the team&#x27;s desire to find history before it can make much.&quot; Although Nationals fans generally take little interest in the franchise&#x27;s Montreal years, some do appreciate acknowledging that the franchise has a history that predates its arrival in Washington, and former Expo Tim Raines received a warm round of applause from fans at Nationals Park at his induction ceremony on August 28, 2017, even though he had never even visited Washington, D.C. before, and the closest baseball he played in the market was one game for Baltimore with his son at the end of 2001. Some Montreal Expos fans express appreciation that the Nationals are honoring the Expos, and Expos players inducted into the Ring of Honor have expressed gratitude that the Nationals chose to include them, especially with no MLB team in Montreal to honor their careers. However, few Nationals fans have taken an interest in franchise records, preferring to compare Nationals records with those of previous Washington MLB teams instead, and a segment of Nationals fans actively opposes the inclusion of Expos history into that of the Nationals, taking the view that the Montreal years are irrelevant to Washington and that the team made a complete break with its past and started anew when it arrived in Washington, inheriting the history of the two Washington Senators teams rather than that of the Expos. Similarly, Montreal Expos fans have taken very little or no interest in the achievements of Nationals players, and many Expos fans strongly oppose the inclusion of former Expos in the Ring, taking the position that to do so is to co-opt the history of the Expos, which they say belongs solely in Montreal.

Observers also have noted that the admission of the first Nationals player to the Ring of Honor, Iván &quot;Pudge&quot; Rodríguez, although he was well-liked as a National, highlights another awkward aspect of the Ring of Honor&#x27;s acceptance criteria, because Rodriguez&#x27;s inclusion arose out of his admission to the National Baseball Hall of Fame based on his exploits for other teams, not out of anything he did during a 155-game, two-season stint with the Nationals at the end of his career in years in which the Nationals posted mediocre records. Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo responded that his inclusion had merit even based on his time with the Nationals, when he &quot;taught us how to be a professional franchise.&quot;

In a ceremony held at Nationals Park between games of a doubleheader on the evening of September 8, 2018, the Nationals inducted former outfielder Jayson Werth, who played for the Nationals from 2011 through 2017, into the Ring of Honor. He became the first &quot;true&quot; National – the first person based specifically on his career as a National – inducted into the Ring of Honor.

The Ring of Honor includes:

==Spring training==

The Nationals hold spring training in Florida, where they play their annual slate of Grapefruit League games. From 2005 through 2016, they held spring training at Space Coast Stadium in Viera, Florida, a facility that they inherited from the Expos. In 2017, the Nationals moved their spring training operations to the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, a new facility they share with the Houston Astros in West Palm Beach, Florida; they played their first Grapefruit League game there on February 28, 2017. On February 16, 2018, it was renamed FITTEAM Ballpark of the Palm Beaches after the Nationals and Astros signed a 12-year deal for the naming rights to the stadium that day with FITTEAM, an event brand partnership and organic products firm located in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. In February 2024, it was renamed CACTI Park of the Palm Beaches after the two teams agreed to a multi-year naming rights deal with American rapper and singer-songwriter Travis Scott&#x27;s CACTI Hard Seltzer company.

==Minor league affiliations==


*The Nationals began an affiliation with the Low-A Nationals in 2005; the then-Advanced-A Potomac Nationals moved from Woodbridge, Virginia, to Fredericksburg, Virginia, before the 2020 season, and moved to Low-A play in the 2021 season.

===Former affiliates===
==Nationals Philanthropies==
The Nationals Philanthropies, formerly the Nationals Dream Foundation, is the team&#x27;s charitable arm which is committed to community partnerships that improve the lives of children and families across the Washington Capital Region. The foundation opened a youth baseball academy in partnership with the D.C. government, and a pediatric diabetes care center at Children&#x27;s National Medical Center in partnership with the Center. The foundation also provides grants to local organizations.

On August 1, 2011, the foundation, in partnership with several local organizations, formally opened Miracle Field in Germantown, Maryland, as part of an effort to encourage athletic activity in children with &quot;mental and/or physical challenges&quot;. According to Steven Miller of MLB.com, what sets Miracle Field apart in terms of safety is its unique design, as it &quot;is made entirely of a cushioned synthetic turf that is five-eighths of an inch thick—providing a safe surface for children in wheelchairs or with other handicaps.&quot;

==Radio and television==
The Nationals&#x27; flagship radio station is WJFK-FM (106.7 FM) &quot;The Fan&quot;, which is owned by Entercom. Charlie Slowes and Dave Jageler are the play-by-play announcers. WJFK fronts a radio network of 19 stations serving portions of Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Delaware as well as the District.

WFED (1500 AM) had been the flagship station since the 2006 season until a multi-year agreement was reached between the Nationals and WJFK before the 2011 season. WFED remains on the network as an affiliate; its 50 kilowatt clear-channel signal allows the Nationals&#x27; home-team call to be heard up and down the East Coast.

WWZZ (104.1 FM), which carried games in the 2005 season, was the team&#x27;s first flagship radio station.

Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) televises all games not picked up by one of MLB&#x27;s national television partners. Bob Carpenter has been the TV play-by-play announcer since 2006 and F.P. Santangelo was hired in January 2011 as color analyst. Mel Proctor was the TV play-by-announcer in 2005, and former color analysts are Ron Darling (2005), Tom Paciorek (2006), Don Sutton (2007–2008), and Rob Dibble, who took over the job in 2009 and was fired in September 2010 after criticizing Stephen Strasburg for not pitching while injured. Ray Knight filled in as color analyst in September 2010 after Dibble was fired.

Previously, WDCA (channel 20) carried 76 games in the 2005 season while the newly founded MASN was still negotiating cable carriage. From 2009 through 2017, MASN syndicated a package of 20 games for simulcast on an over-the-air television station in Washington. Broadcast partners under this arrangement were WDCW (channel 50) from 2009 through 2012 and CBS affiliate WUSA (channel 9) from 2013 through 2017. MASN did not continue the syndication deal for the 2018 season.

In the midst of a season in which they finished with the worst record in Major League Baseball, the Nationals&#x27; television ratings were among the worst in the National League in July 2008 but increased during the 2010 and 2011 seasons. Since 2012, when they began to achieve consistent success on the field, their television viewership has grown continually and dramatically. By 2016, the Nationals′ prime-time television ratings were 15th highest among the 29 U.S. MLB teams, and they rose to 12th in 2017. Ratings declined to 18th among the 29 U.S. teams for the 2018 season.

==Rivalries==
===Baltimore Orioles===

The Nationals have an interleague rivalry, nicknamed the Beltway Series, with the nearby Baltimore Orioles. The teams have played two series a season—one in Baltimore and one in Washington—since 2006. The Nationals and Orioles rivalry is one of the few that can be played in a World Series.

===Philadelphia Phillies===

The Nationals&#x27; rivalry with the Philadelphia Phillies originated during their original tenure as the Montreal Expos. The two teams repeatedly battled for control of the division in the early 1980s and mid 1990s. Following the franchise&#x27;s relocation to Washington, D.C., in 2005, the rivalry increased in geographic tension due to Washington&#x27;s proximity to Philadelphia. The rivalry quickly spiked in intensity during the 2010s after Nationals team management introduced a campaign to block Phillies fans from overtaking home games. In 2019, star-outfielder Bryce Harper further fueled tensions after signing a 13-year, $330 million contract with the Phillies as a free agent. The Nationals later won the 2019 World Series during the first year after Harper&#x27;s departure.

<doc id="885152" wikidata="Q685067" url="?curid=885152" title="Seaslug (missile)">
<text>Seaslug was a first-generation surface-to-air missile designed by Armstrong Whitworth (later part of the Hawker Siddeley group) for use by the Royal Navy. Tracing its history as far back as 1943&#x27;s LOPGAP design, it came into operational service in 1961 and was still in use at the time of the Falklands War in 1982.

Seaslug was intended to engage high-flying targets such as reconnaissance aircraft or bombers before they could launch stand-off weapons. It was only fitted to the Royal Navy&#x27;s eight County-class destroyers which were designed around the missile system. Seaslug was only fired in anger once as an anti-aircraft missile, from during the Falklands War, but missed its target. Later improvements meant that it could also be used against ships and ground targets.

It was planned that Seaslug&#x27;s medium-range role was to be supplanted by a very long-range missile known as Blue Envoy, but this was passed over in favour of a new medium-range system, Sea Dart. Sea Dart entered service in 1973 on the Type 82 destroyers and replaced Seaslug during the 1980s as the s were removed from service.

==Development==
===Initial concept===
In 1943, the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; began the use of anti-shipping missiles and guided bombs in the Mediterranean Sea during Allied operations against Italy. These weapons were released outside of anti-aircraft gun range, which meant that naval operations lacking complete air superiority would be open to attack with no effective response from the ships. A solution for long-range anti-aircraft was required. On 16 March 1944 the first meeting of the &quot;Guided Anti-Aircraft Projectile Committee&quot;, or GAP Committee, was held.

The Admiralty Signals Establishment (ASE), in charge of the Navy&#x27;s radar development, was working on new radars featuring radar lock-on that allowed them to accurately track aircraft at long range. This was part of the LRS.1 fire-control system that allowed large dual-purpose guns to attack bombers at long range. A contemporary British Army project at Cossors, Brakemine, was working on a system to allow a missile to keep itself centred within a radar beam, a concept known today as beam riding. The Navy decided to combine the two concepts, using the LRS.1&#x27;s Type 901 radar with a new missile that differed from Brakemine primarily in requiring longer range and being more robust for shipborne use.

In December 1944, GAP put out a Naval Staff Target for a new anti-aircraft weapon, capable of attacking targets at altitudes up to and speeds of up to . This project was briefly known as LOPGAP, short for &quot;Liquid Oxygen and Petrol Guided Anti-aircraft Projectile&quot;, but soon moved from petrol to methanol which made the &quot;LOP&quot; inaccurate.

===LOPGAP===
The Fairey Aviation Company at this time was working on a missile project for the Ministry of Supply, Stooge. Stooge was more like an armed drone aircraft than a missile. It was flown to a location in front of the target and then cruised toward it until its warhead was triggered by the operator. It was designed primarily to defeat kamikaze attacks at short range. Its low speed and manual guidance meant it was not useful for interceptions outside the immediate area of the ship, and thus did not meet the need for a longer-ranged missile capable of dealing with stand-off weapons.

Accordingly, Fairey was ordered to stop work on Stooge in favour of LOPGAP. Development was slowed by the Air Ministry who were opposed to the project as it might take resources away from jet fighter production and a lack of urgency on the part of both the Admiralty and Ministry of Supply.

A March 1945 report called for the first test launches of LOPGAP from converted QF 3.7-inch air-aircraft gun mounts within two months. The same mounts had also been used, with different modifications, for Stooge and Brakemine. They predicted the final system would be about long and a twin-launcher would take up about the same room as a twin 5.25-inch gun turret. An April Staff Target called for the system to be able to engage an aircraft flying at at altitudes up to with a maximum weight of .

===Move to RAE===
In 1945 a new Guided Projectiles Establishment was set up under the Controller of Supplies (Air) and in 1946 development of all ongoing missile projects moved to the Royal Aircraft Establishment&#x27;s (RAE) new Controlled Weapons Department, soon to become the Guided Weapons Department. They began considering the beam riding concept in partnership with the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE), the deliberately oddly-named department of the Air Ministry responsible for radar development. Over the next year, first Brakemine and then Stooge were moved to the RAE.

In a January 1947 Navy review, the program was given the name Seaslug. This called for a significantly larger weapon than initially envisioned, capable of single-stage vertical launch, a warhead (and guidance) of and an all-up weight of . Development continued as before but was significantly hampered by the post-war exodus of engineering talent. Shortly after the new definition was produced, this project also moved to the RAE. Efforts by the Navy to change the name from Seaslug to the more ominous-sounding &quot;Triumph&quot; failed.

Development slowed, and in July 1947 the Admiralty approached Henry Tizard to argue for a more &quot;virile leadership&quot; of the program. Tizard called a meeting of the Defence Research Policy Committee (DRPC) and started a process of pushing through four key missile programs that were intended to enter service in 1957, Seaslug, a longer ranged Army/Air Force surface-to-air missile known as Red Heathen, the Blue Boar television guided glide bomb, and the Red Hawk air-to-air missile.

In March 1948 a new report from the DRPC noted there was not enough manpower for all four projects, and put Seaslug at the bottom of the priority list, claiming air attack would be less likely than submarine in the event of war. They suggested the much longer ranged Red Heathen was more important in the short term. The Admiralty was of another opinion on the matter and argued against the change in priority.

The Navy found an unlikely ally in the Army, who were concerned that Red Heathen was too difficult to move to in a single step and suggested that Seaslug might be the basis for a more immediate medium-range weapon that could be used both on land and sea. The DPRC also began to have concerns about accurately guiding Red Heathen at its desired maximum range. In September 1948 they agreed to develop Seaslug &quot;as a matter of insurance&quot;, before further upgrading it in 1949 to &quot;top priority&quot;. As a result of these changes, the program was seen as having two stages, Stage 1 would deliver missiles in the mid-1950s with roughly range with capability mostly against subsonic targets, and a Stage 2 of the early 1960s would have a greatly extended range on the order of and able to attack supersonic aircraft.

===Experimental systems===
Two test systems emerged from this centralization. The CTV.1 was a small unpowered Brakemine-like system devoted to the development of the guidance systems, launched using three RP-3 rocket motors and controlled through the coast phase. A series of CTV designs followed, providing ever-increasing amounts of telemetry for the guidance and control systems work. GAP became a purely research-oriented system, RTV.1 (rocket test vehicle), as opposed to a prototype missile design, and was used primarily as a platform for testing the rocket motors. The GAP/RTV.1 efforts would be directed at the Stage 1 design, which would essentially be the Seaslug requirement.

The relatively small CTV could safely be launched at the Larkhill Range, part of the Royal School of Artillery. It was equipped with a parachute that allowed it to be recovered. This was not possible for the much longer-ranged RTV, which was fired from RAF Aberporth out over Cardigan Bay in Wales. The desire to reclaim the RTVs as well led to the opening of a parallel launch facility at the RAAF Woomera Range Complex and a program that led development of supersonic parachutes.

As RTV testing continued, the decision was made to build a larger version, RTV.2, which would be more typical of a production missile. During early testing, the design was further modified and renamed GPV, for General Purpose Test Vehicle. Several liquid rocket motors were tested as part of this program. Early tests demonstrated shifts in the center of gravity that required active damping, which in turn led to the lengthening of the overall fuselage to become the &quot;long round&quot;. This version used forward-mounted boosters, which were mounted so their exhaust was just in front of the mid-mounted wings.

===Project 502===
As experimental work progressed, the Ministry of Supply began forming an industry team to build production systems. In 1949 this gave rise to the &#x27;Project 502&#x27; group from industry, with Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft and Sperry in March and GEC in September.

The 29 July 1949 update of the Staff Target called for a maximum range of and a minimum of . Maximum altitude should be 55,000 ft, but 45,000 would be considered acceptable. A later updated pushed the range to against a , later , target. It was assumed the targets would &quot;jink&quot; at 1G, so the missile needed to maneuver at 4G at sea level and 2.5G at 40,000 ft. Additional requirements were the ability to switch between targets in 6 seconds.

The designers ultimately selected a maximum range of 30,000 yards, which included of coasting after motor burn-out. This was about 50% better than the contemporary US Terrier design. Hit probability was estimated to be 40% at maximum range, so salvos of three missiles would be fired at once, demanding a three-place launcher. This was later reduced back to a twin-launcher when it was realized accessing the missile in the middle launcher would make maintenance difficult.

===Changing requirements===
When the deployment of the Seaslug was first being considered, three classes of custom missile-firing ships were considered. The Task Force Ship would be capable of and would tasked with fleet air defence. The Ocean Convoy Escort was a vessel that would provide direct cover over seagoing convoys, while the Coastal Convoy Escort would do the same closer to shore. At that time it was believed that aircraft carriers would be able to provide adequate cover over convoys or fleets in the ocean, so attention turned to the Coastal Convoy Escort. Beginning in May 1953 a Beachy Head-class repair ship was converted into a prototype escort ship, , to test this fitting.

For this role, the densest possible storage was required, so the initial design of a single booster rocket at the base end of the missile. This led to a very long design, as was the case for most contemporary designs, this was abandoned in favour of four smaller boosters wrapped around the fuselage, giving shorter overall length of about . The boosters were positioned so they lay within the diameter defined by the missile&#x27;s wings, so they did not make it any larger in diameter when stored. If one of the boosters did not fire the thrust would be significantly off-axis, a possibility which was later addressed by moving the boosters forward so their exhaust was near the centre of gravity of the missile, allowing the missile&#x27;s small control surfaces to remain effective. In contrast, the American Terrier missile was somewhat shorter at , but this required an additional tandem booster which took the overall length to .

In 1954, during another review of the Navy&#x27;s future operations, consideration turned from a &quot;hot war&quot; against the Soviets to a series of &quot;warm wars&quot; in the third world. Among other changes brought about by this review, including the cancellation of a future all-gun cruiser class and ending further conversion of WWII-era destroyers to Type 15 frigates, the new environment meant that air cover by carriers could not be guaranteed, and the need for air defence for task-force sized groups became the primary concern. A cut to carrier construction, capping the fleet at four, released funds for missile ship construction. In October 1954, a new design emerged that demanded the speed to keep up with a fleet in combat, have guns limited to self-defence, and carrying a single twin-missile launcher.

The designs were continually modified in order to find a suitable arrangement. They started as early as 1953 with a mid-sized cruiser of carrying 60 to 90 missiles and a crew of 900. Admiral Ralph Edwards pointed out it would be more useful to have a larger number of small ships with 10 to 20 missiles than one larger one, but attempts to design such a ship resulted in one with room for the weapons but not the crew needed to operate them. In May 1955 a wide variety of plans for designs between the two extremes were compared, ranging from 9,850 tons down to 4,550. After continual comparison and revision, these plans finally gelled around what became the County-class destroyer.

===Testing===

Test firings of the GAP-based examples, now known as Rocket Test Vehicle 1, or RTV.1, demonstrated beam riding in October 1956. The Navy had set a date of 1957 for a broad modernization of the fleet, so they desired Seaslug to be cleared for service in 1956. To this end, they accepted the use of liquid fuels in spite of the Navy&#x27;s concerns with these fuels on ships. However, by 1956 a new solid fuel rocket had been developed at the Summerfield Research Station which provided the desired range.

Continual tests took place over the next four years using both the Clausen Rolling Platform at RAE Aberporth and the &quot;Girdle Ness&quot;. A final series of tests at sea, which culminated in sixteen successful firings, finally cleared the missile for service in 1961. After more than 250 launches, the Seaslug Mark 1, also known as Guided Weapon System 1, or GWS.1, finally entered service in 1962 on County-class, each fitted with a single twin missile launcher and a complete weapon system with one fire control set and 30 missiles. The Seaslug-armed cruisers were cancelled in 1957.

Seaslug needed height, range and bearing information for targets. By 1955 the Royal Navy considered using the Type 984 radar on Seaslug-armed cruisers and destroyers to provide this. During development, the projected weight of the radar doubled, to the point where it could still potentially be mounted on cruisers, but was rejected for destroyers because it would have meant sacrificing their 4.5 in gun armament. The gun armament was regarded as essential for the navy&#x27;s wider role outside the hot war mission. The solution adopted with the first batch of the County-class destroyers was to network them with ships carrying Type 984. The destroyers were given a reduced version of the Comprehensive Display System (CDS), which was fed by a CDS-link receiver called DPD (Digital Picture Transmission or Translation).

The final set for the County ships, actually more a cruiser type than a destroyer, was quite complex: a Type 965 radar for early warning (P-band, 450 kW peak power, range over 175 km), in the County Batch 2 the double antenna AKE-2 had two different frequency settings; a Type 992Q target indicator radar (3 GHz, 1.75 MW peak power, 90 km range); a Type 278 height finding set (80–90 km); a Type 901 missile guidance radar (X band, 70 km range), that in the Sea Slug Mk 2 had a continuous wave signal (but it was still a beam riding designation radar); a Type 904 fire control radar (used in the MRS-3 system, X-band, 50 kW, 35 km range) for surface targeting.

==Description==

The missile had four wrap-around booster motors that separated after launch. After separation, the main motor ignited to power the missile to the target. The booster motors were positioned at the side of the missile, but this unusual arrangement with the motor nozzles both angled outwards at 22.5° and 22.5° to the left, the missile entered a gentle roll at launch, evening out differences in the thrusts of the boosters. This meant that large stabilising fins as used on contemporary missiles in service with the Royal Air Force (Bloodhound) and the British Army (Thunderbird) were not required. Once the boosters were jettisoned the control surfaces became active.

Guidance was by radar beam-riding, the beam to be provided by Type 901 fire-control radar. There were four flight modes:

* LOSBR (Line Of Sight, Beam Riding), in which the missile flew up a beam that tracked the target
* CASWTD (Constant Angle of Sight With Terminal Dive), with the missile climbing at a low angle and then diving onto a low-altitude target at 45°, used against low flying targets at over 12,000 yards away
* MICAWBER (Missile In Constant Altitude While BEam Riding), used against low level target approaching at 500–800 feet, it allows switching from CASWTD to LOSBR when the target is closing at the ship
* Up and over: the standard surface attack mode, using the Type 901 radar slaved to the Type 903 in bearing; the missile is fired at high elevation and then depressed in order to strike the vessel with a steep dive, without arming the fuse.

Electrical power when the missile was in flight was provided by a flux switching alternator with a six tooth rotor. &quot;The 1.5 kVA Seaslug generator ran at 24,000 rev/min with a frequency of 2,400 Hz.&quot;

==Service performance==

Seaslug was a high-performance weapon in the 1960s, with a single-shot kill probability of 92%, although other sources give lower kill probabilities: 75% for the Mk 1 and 65% for the Mk 2. The first four ships of the &quot;County&quot;-class (Batch 1) operated the Seaslug Mk 1, while the final four (Batch 2) were fitted with the ADAWS command and control system which enabled them to carry the more capable Mk 2 version. A proposal to refit the Batch 1 ships with ADAWS was dropped in 1968.

During the Falklands War Seaslug was only launched once against an aircraft target, by , and without success. On 21 May 1982 in Falkland Sound, the &quot;Antrim&quot; which had already had an unexploded 1,000 lb bomb pass through the Seaslug magazine, fired a single missile (some sources say two) at one of a second wave of attacking IAI Dagger fighters. It was unguided because the aircraft was too low to be acquired; the launch was intended to deter the pilot and to remove the exposed missile from the ship because it posed a fire hazard. The first combat use in the surface-to-surface role was during a shore bombardment on 26 May, when fired Seaslugs at Port Stanley Airport claiming the destruction of a number of helicopters and a radar installation. A total of eight Seaslug Mk 2 missiles were launched in theatre by the two ships armed with them, including two missiles jettisoned by &quot;Glamorgan&quot; after she was hit by a land-launched Exocet missile on 12 June. Also during 1982, the Mk2 was used as a trials target for Seadart, but there were reliability problems with both systems. 

The last firing of the Seaslug Mk 1 was in December 1981 by , the final GWS1 (or Batch 1) ship in active service. was converted to a training ship, and had her Seaslug systems removed, freeing up large spaces for classrooms and was completed in June 1986. &quot;Fife&quot; and the remaining GWS2 ships were sold to Chile between 1982 and 1987. Initially, the British government had hoped that the Chileans would accept a package to upgrade the ships to operate Seadart, but this was not taken up and they were transferred complete with Seaslug. The Chilean ships were later refitted with an extended flight deck in place of the Seaslug launcher.

==Variants==

There were two main variants of the Seaslug:

===Mark 1 (GWS.1)===
The Seaslug Mark 1 was powered by the solid-fuel &quot;Foxhound&quot; (390 kg fuel) sustainer motor and &quot;Gosling&quot; (145 kg) booster motors. It had a radio proximity fuze and blast warhead.

The Mark 1 was a beam rider missile, meaning the target had to be continually illuminated by the directing radar, so the system was limited to engaging only the number of targets that there were radars to track and lock on.

* Attack Velocity: 
* Range: 
* Ceiling: 

===Mark 2 (GWS.2)===
The Seaslug Mark 2 was based on the aborted Blue Slug programme to develop an anti-ship missile using the Seaslug missile and guidance system. The project was cancelled in favour of the &quot;Green Cheese&quot; missile, a tactical nuclear anti-ship weapon, but other project developments were incorporated into what became the Mark 2. It had improved low altitude performance and a limited anti-ship capability and entered service in 1971. The Mark 2 utilized an improved beam-riding guidance system. and solid-state electronics. It was powered by the &quot;Deerhound&quot; sustainer motor, with &quot;Retriever&quot; boosters. Control was by a modified Type 901M radar and it had an improved infra-red proximity fuze and a continuous-rod warhead with a smaller, , explosive charge (RDX-TNT) and an unfold diameter of about 70 feet (10 mm steel rods were used) 

* Attack velocity: 
* Range: 
* Ceiling: 

The capabilities of the new Sea Slug Mk 2, an almost 2.5 ton missile, were much improved compared to the previous Mk 1. The boosters gave a total of about 60 tons-force, with fuel for each one (145 kg in the Mk 1), accelerating it to over Mach 2. When they separated because the extreme drag made by the rings all around the missile, the solid fuel sustainer &quot;Deerhound&quot; started to burn its of propellant (390 kg for the Mk 1) and gave about for 38 seconds. The slender missile remained at over Mach 2-2.5 until the flameout. The missile was made fully controllable about ten seconds after firing, followed by a radio-beacon while it was centered in the radar beam; and armed the infra-red proximity fuze at about from the target, if &#x27;hot&#x27;, while if &#x27;cold&#x27; the missile was detonated by command sent from the ship. 

The range could be even more than 35,000 yards, especially at high altitude, with head-on supersonic targets. One of the longest shots recorded was made by HMS &quot;Antrim&quot; against a target over away, with an impact at 34.500 with about 46 seconds flight time. The missile was capable of reaching potentially even higher altitude and longer range than nominally attested: even after the engine flameout (over 40 seconds after launch), it retained very high speeds and one of them even surpassed before self-destructing, about one minute after the firing.

For both Mark 1 and Mark 2 Sea Slug there were drill rounds (painted blue) for the purpose of training and display rounds (painted red) which could be loaded onto the launcher for port visits and public relations.

===Nuclear variant (not built)===
In addition, a nuclear-armed variant was planned using a low-yield fission warhead code-named &quot;Winkle&quot;. &quot;Winkle&quot; was never built as it was quickly supplanted by &quot;Pixie&quot;, a very small unboosted warhead with an all-plutonium fissile core tested at Maralinga, which was, in turn, replaced by &quot;Gwen&quot; — a British version of the US W54 &quot;Gnat&quot; unboosted warhead of approximate yield 0.5–2 kiloton of TNT-equivalent. The final warhead choice was &quot;Tony&quot; - a UK version of the W44 &quot;Tsetse&quot; boosted warhead, but all nuclear options for Seaslug were subsequently abandoned, and no nuclear-armed variant of Seaslug was ever deployed.

==Operators==
===Royal Navy===
The County-class destroyers were specifically built to carry Seaslug and its associated control equipment. The magazine was positioned amidships and missiles were assembled in a central gallery forward of the magazine before being passed to the launcher on the quarterdeck. The handling arrangements were designed with a nuclear-war environment in mind and were therefore entirely under cover.

===Chilean Navy===
Some of the County-class destroyers were sold to Chile for the Chilean Navy. The system was decommissioned after the rebuild of the four ships purchased by Chile in the early 1990s.

<text>Bill Dvorak is a Salida, Colorado-based whitewater rafting outfitter. He is best known for organizing multi-day rafting trips on the Dolores and Green Rivers where professional classical musicians give nightly concerts. He claims to be a fifth cousin of classical composer Antonín Dvořák.

He grew up on a ranch in Wyoming and founded his river guiding company, Dvorak Expeditions, in 1979. During the 1980s, Dvorak Expeditions was one of the first companies to organize rafting trips for fishers on the Gunnison River. He has worked as a public land organizer for the National Wildlife Federation and advocated against the diversion of water from the Gunnison River to cities in Colorado.

<doc id="885172" wikidata="Q15030864" url="?curid=885172" title="Ladbroke Grove">
<text>Ladbroke Grove ( ) is a road in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, London, England, which passes through Kensal Green and Notting Hill, running north–south between Harrow Road and Holland Park Avenue.

It is also the name of the surrounding area including parts of Kensal Town, Latimer Road, Kensal Green and Westbourne Park, straddling the W10 and W11 postal districts. Ladbroke Grove tube station is on the road, at the point where it is crossed by the Westway. 

Ladbroke Grove is the nearest tube station to Portobello Road Market. The adjacent bridge and nearby section of the Westway were regenerated in 2007 in a partnership including Urban Eye, Transport for London and London Underground. It is the main road on the route of the annual Notting Hill Carnival. The northern end between the Harrow Road and Kensal House is in Kensal Green, the middle section between Barlby Road and the A40 flyover in North Kensington, and the southern end between Lancaster Road and Holland Park Avenue in Notting Hill.

== History ==
The area and the street are named after James Weller Ladbroke, who developed the Ladbroke Estate in the 1840s. It was originally a predominantly rural area on the western edges of London. Construction at the southern end by Holland Park Avenue began in the 1830s, but the road was not fully developed to Harrow Road until the 1870s.

Hablot Knight Browne, the cartoonist who illustrated Charles Dickens&#x27; novels as &quot;Phiz&quot;, lived at No. 99 in 1872–80.

=== Churches ===
The church of St John the Evangelist was constructed in 1845 on the site of the Hippodrome on the Ladbroke Estate, which had closed four years earlier.

The Anglican church of St Michael and All Angels in the road was designed by James Edmeston and built in the Romanesque style in 1871. The funds were provided by J. E.Gray, the father of the first vicar, the Reverend Edward Ker Gray: the foundation stone was laid on 1 November 1870 by a cousin of the Grays, John Mowbray. The church became fashionable with members of the Royal Family. The Duke of Edinburgh played the violin in the church orchestra. The vicarage was built in 1876, with the foundation stone being laid by the Duchess of Teck. The Lady Chapel was opened by the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh in 1882. However, in 1886, the Reverend Gray moved to the Curzon Street Chapel and St Michael&#x27;s became less fashionable.

The Serbian Orthodox Church of St Sava is on Lancaster Road, just off Ladbroke Grove. The church building was originally built in 1903 as the Anglican church of St Columba; in 1952 it was re-consecrated as Saint Sava&#x27;s, to serve a growing community of post-war refugees. It was the venue for the baptism of Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia, son of Peter II, in 1945, and his second marriage in 1985. Princess Maria Tatiana, daughter of Prince Andrew of Yugoslavia, was baptised there in 1957. In 2013, it was the venue for the memorial service of Princess Margarita of Baden.

The former church of Christ Church, Telford Road was opened in 1881, and closed in 1940 when the parish merged with St Michaels. The church building was demolished.

== Music and culture ==
Ladbroke Grove was a centre of the British counterculture in the 1960s. The area was blacklisted for development following 1958 Notting Hill race riots, and consequently found favour with individuals who distrusted authority, moving into unmodernised Victorian properties along the road. The space rock band Hawkwind were formed here in 1969, and eventually bonded and worked with fantasy author Michael Moorcock who was then a resident. Moorcock&#x27;s work often contain references to Ladbroke Grove, the location being the headquarters of his fictional characters Jerry Cornelius and Colonel Pyat. 

The Deviants (formerly the Social Deviants) and Pink Fairies were musical groups out of the Ladbroke Grove UK underground movement, from which a number of bands would emerge, influenced by anarchistic singer/writer Mick Farren. Punk group The Clash also formed locally in 1976; frontman Joe Strummer squatted around Ladbroke Grove before joining the group. The &quot;Roughler&quot; magazine emerged in the 1980s and 1990s to chronicle the antics of the more Bohemian residents, including the legendary Portobello Pantos.

Ladbroke Grove features as the scene of Van Morrison&#x27;s 1968 song &quot;Slim Slow Slider&quot; from &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;, and is mentioned in the 1970s pop hit &quot;One Man Band&quot; by Leo Sayer. The Pulp song &quot;I Spy&quot;, from the album &quot;Different Class&quot;, features the line &quot;your Ladbroke Grove looks turn me on&quot;. The Blur songs &quot;Fool&#x27;s Day&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Street&quot; also feature Ladbroke Grove in their lyrics. As does the song &quot;Joel&quot; by The Boo Radleys, with the line, &quot;I&#x27;ve found myself in Ladbroke Grove&quot; from the album &quot;Wake Up!&quot;. The Slits song &quot;Ping Pong Affair&quot; from the album &quot;Cut&quot;, also features Ladbroke Grove in its lyrics. 

&quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot; by Laufey mentions Ladbroke Grove in the line &quot;What if I hadn&#x27;t left the train at Ladbroke Grove.&quot; &quot;LDN&quot; by Lily Allen mentions Ladbroke Grove in an overdubbed chorus of London placenames. Killing Joke have released an EP (In Excelsis) that features two mixes of a song called &quot;Ghost Of Ladbroke Grove&quot;. The UK rapper AJ Tracey&#x27;s hit &quot;Ladbroke Grove&quot; is named after the road which he is from; it peaked at number 3 on the UK singles chart. Mahdi made his first music video in Ladbroke Grove. The posthumous music video of the Lil Peep release &quot;4 Gold Chains&quot; is set at 121 Ladbroke Grove.

In 1977, a brief encounter between musicians Phil Collins and Steve Hackett on Ladbroke Grove finalised the latter&#x27;s departure from the progressive rock band Genesis.

From the 2010s to today Ladbroke Grove has been home to some of the most prominent grime and drill artists, such as AJ Tracey and Digga D.

== Transport ==


===Rail===
Ladbroke Grove tube station is located halfway along the road, and is served by the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines. The Westway, part of a main road from Central London to Oxford crosses in the same location, though there is no junction. The road also has bridges over the Great Western Main Line from London Paddington station, and the Grand Union Canal.

===Crossrail===

At a site just to the east of the Old Oak Common site, Kensington and Chelsea Council has been pushing for a station at Kensal off Ladbroke Grove and Canal Way, as a turn-back facility will have to be built in the area anyway. Siting it at Kensal Green, rather than next to Paddington itself, would provide a new station to regenerate the area. Boris Johnson stated that a station would be added if it did not increase Crossrail&#x27;s overall cost; in response, Kensington and Chelsea Council agreed to underwrite the projected £33 million cost of a Crossrail station. TfL is conducting a feasibility study on the station and the project is backed by National Grid, retailers Sainsbury&#x27;s and Cath Kidston, and Jenny Jones (Green Party member of the London Assembly). The plans were resurrected by Johnson in 2016.

On 5 October 1999, two trains on the Great Western Main Line near Ladbroke Grove crashed into each other at a combined speed of over , leading to the diesel fuel of one of the trains igniting and setting fire to both. Thirty one people died and over 400 were injured, including severe burns. The cause of the crash was determined to be lack of suitable visibility of signals. The crash, combined with further major incidents at Hatfield and Potters Bar, shook confidence in the British rail network.

===Bus===
Ladbroke Grove is served by London Buses routes 7, 23, 52, 70, 228, 295, 316, 452 and N7.

<text>Steve Peregrin Took (born Stephen Ross Porter; 28 July 1949 – 27 October 1980) was an English musician and songwriter, best known for his membership of the duo Tyrannosaurus Rex with Marc Bolan. After breaking with Bolan, he concentrated on his own singer-songwriting activities, either as a solo artist or as a frontman for several bands.

==Career==
===Early life (1949–1967) and Tyrannosaurus Rex (1967–1969)===
Took was born Stephen Ross Porter in Eltham, London, on 28 July 1949, and attended Shooters Hill School. He took his name from the character Peregrin Took, a hobbit in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. At the age of 17, having played drums for some months with a mod band named the Waterproof Sparrows (bass player John Rains, guitarists Pete Keen and Wally Woodcock), he answered an advert in &quot;International Times&quot; for Tyrannosaurus Rex, the electric band that Marc Bolan was forming following his departure from John&#x27;s Children. After one disastrous concert at the Electric Garden in London, Bolan and Took reduced the band to a duo, busking in subways on acoustic guitar and bongos, Took having been obliged to sell his full drum kit to pay the rent until paying gigs started to come in.

The flower-power unit, championed by John Peel onto the club and stage circuit and thence into the record shops, released three albums and achieved two top 40 hits. Took contributed harmony backing vocals, which are more noticeable in live recordings than on studio recordings, and provided bongos, African drums, kazoo, pixiphone, and Chinese gong. Took&#x27;s arrangements contributed to transforming Bolan&#x27;s music from the straightforward rock &#x27;n roll it had previously been into an exotic brew of musical styles designed to appeal to Bolan&#x27;s new audience of hippies. Towards the end of his time in the band, as Bolan began returning to the electric guitar, Took returned to a full drum set and also contributed some bass guitar parts.

The band&#x27;s producer Tony Visconti credited Took with much of the sound and success of Tyrannosaurus Rex. In an interview for the documentary &quot;Marc Bolan: The Final Word&quot;, Visconti opined that &quot;Marc and Steve were a true 50:50 partnership. Steve was a remarkable musician, he could play many instruments. He played percussion, he could pick up a bass or a guitar. He would also sometimes play some cello parts. And then his backing vocals were great too.&quot;

Took developed his own songwriting and in early 1969, with recording just complete on Tyrannosaurus Rex&#x27;s third LP, &quot;Unicorn&quot;, Took suggested to Bolan that the duo could perform some of his own material; Bolan refused. By this time, their lifestyles were in direct conflict. Bolan was living quietly with wife-to-be June Child, while Took was rapidly forging links with &quot;revolutionary&quot; underground acts, such as the Deviants and the Pretty Things. The relationship was deteriorating badly—Bolan barely tolerated Took&#x27;s drug use, and Steve Mann recalled that it was clear they &quot;cordially detested each other&quot;.

In addition, Took&#x27;s friendship with Bolan&#x27;s idol Syd Barrett had also developed through their shared interests in both LSD and &quot;strange musical noises&quot;. Mick Farren, in his memoir &quot;Give The Anarchist A Cigarette&quot;, recalled that Took would &quot;drag a bemused Syd Barrett along&quot; to events in Ladbroke Grove in the late 1960s; Took remained friends with Barrett well into the 1970s. Took worked with Syd Barrett on unreleased &quot;Ramadan&quot; tracks. While in Tyrannosaurus Rex, Took also appeared as a backing vocalist on a session for David Bowie, the results of which can be heard on the BBC sessions album &quot;Bowie at the Beeb&quot;.

Eventually, Took donated two of his songs—&quot;Three Little Piggies&quot; and &quot;The Sparrow Is A Sign&quot;—to former Tomorrow and Pretty Things drummer Twink&#x27;s 1969 solo album, &quot;Think Pink&quot;.
Consequently, before the first Tyrannosaurus Rex tour of America, Bolan and his management gave Took notice that they would be sacking him once the tour was complete. Another contributing factor was an incident at the launch party for the UK edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, where jugs of punch prepared for the event were spiked with the hallucinogen STP. Took had already earned himself the nickname &quot;The Phantom Spiker&quot; (in which he rejoiced) through previous similar pranks. Bolan was severely affected by the spiked drink and considered Took to be the prime suspect.

Took was contractually obliged to go on the US tour, but his heart was not in it and he attempted to cope through taking drugs. Additionally, the acoustic duo were overshadowed by the loud electric acts they were billed with. To counter this, he drew from the shock rock style of Iggy Pop; as Took explained to the &quot;NME&quot; in 1972 &quot;I took my shirt off in the Sunset Strip where we were playing and whipped myself till everybody shut up. With a belt, y&#x27;know, a bit of blood and the whole of Los Angeles shuts up. &#x27;What&#x27;s going on, man, there&#x27;s some nutter attacking himself on stage.&#x27; I mean, Iggy Stooge had the same basic approach.&quot; This allowed the management to claim subsequently that it was Took&#x27;s behaviour on stage which had caused the sacking. Bolan replaced Took with Mickey Finn, and after one further album renamed the duo T. Rex, later expanding to a full band again.

===Pink Fairies (1969–1970)===

After being sacked by Bolan, Took formed a prototype version of the Pink Fairies with Twink and Mick Farren, recently ousted from his own band, the Deviants. This band was named in honour of a drinking club of the same name the three had formed earlier that year, along with other leading lights of the underground scene. Together with Twink&#x27;s girlfriend Silva Darling, they performed what Farren would later describe as &quot;less of a gig than a protracted harangue&quot; at the University of Manchester in October 1969, which rapidly dissolved into chaos. Took appeared prominently on Farren&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Mona – The Carnivorous Circus&quot; (recorded December 1969, released 1970) on which he was credited as Shagrat The Vagrant. Twink and the other ex-Deviants then formed a new band called the Pink Fairies (mark 2), without Took or Farren.

===Shagrat (1970–1971)===

In February 1970, Farren and Took headhunted guitarist Larry (or &quot;Lazza&quot;) Wallis and bassist Tim Taylor from their underground band, the Entire Sioux Nation. A month later, Farren dropped out, leaving Took in the role of bandleader for the first time in his career. With the addition of drummer Phil Lenoir, Shagrat was formed (named after an orc in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;). They recorded three tracks, &quot;Peppermint Flickstick&quot;, &quot;Boo! I Said Freeze&quot; and &quot;Steel Abortion&quot;, at Strawberry Studios and played live at the Phun City festival, before Lenoir and Taylor left. Took and Wallis continued with drummer Dave Bidwell, rehearsing with various bass players and eventually forming an acoustic trio of Took on vocals and guitar, Wallis on acoustic bass and Bidwell on tambourine. This line-up recorded a set of (at least) four home demos, &quot;Amanda&quot;, &quot;Strange Sister&quot;, &quot;Still Yawning Stillborn&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Deceiver&quot;, at Wallis&#x27;s father&#x27;s home studio in South London, which in the 1990s would be paired with the earlier electric studio session for limited edition vinyl release and later a CD album release in 2001.

Wallis would later take over the leadership of the Pink Fairies for their &quot;Kings of Oblivion&quot; LP, substantially transforming the sound and style of the band. He and Took would work together again at various intervals in 1972, 1975–1976 and 1977.

===Solo acoustic performer (1971–1972)===
With Wallis and Bidwell otherwise committed to UFO and Savoy Brown respectively, the acoustic Shagrat was effectively reduced down to just Took himself performing solo on an acoustic guitar, usually sitting on a stool interspersing his songs with jokes and other onstage monologues. In this format, Took made some headway as a live performer. &quot;Tookie&quot; appeared in frequent support slots for Hawkwind and the Pink Fairies, attracting some coverage in the UK music press and even performing a live session on Steve Bradshaw&#x27;s &quot;Breakthrough&quot; programme on BBC Radio London. In December 1971, he headlined a three-date mini-tour of southwest England.

He also performed at various benefit events, including the &quot;Nasty Balls&quot; benefits for the &quot;Nasty Tales&quot; magazine (whose editors, including Farren, were on trial for obscenity) as well as the 1972 Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament festival at Aldermaston, Steve&#x27;s account of which was reprinted by Charles Shaar Murray in his book &quot;Shots From The Hip&quot;. Writing for the &quot;NME&quot; in 1972, Murray described Took and his stage act thus: &quot;Most people know who Steve Peregrine Took is, but few people know what he does. A few more know him as a somewhat bizarre figure who materialises at concerts, armed only with an Epiphone guitar, and performs a freeform set of songs, raps, jokes and anything else that flashes through his mind.&quot;

During this time, Took could also often be seen participating in jamming sessions during encores at Hawkwind and Pink Fairies concerts. His contributions to these jams were in the role of third drummer, and he also once played bass guitar for the &quot;Pinks&quot;, substituting for Duncan Sanderson.

===Management by Tony Secunda (1972–1973)===
During 1972, Took was approached by Tony Secunda, recently fired as manager for T. Rex, with a view to recovering royalties owed to Took from the Tyrannosaurus Rex years. Emerging from these conversations, Secunda became Took&#x27;s manager, with a view to leading him to stardom to spite Bolan. Initially, Took attempted to rerecord as a single the song &quot;Amanda&quot; from the 1971 acoustic Shagrat session (along with two other tracks, &quot;Blind Owl Blues&quot; and &quot;Mr Discrete&quot;) with the assistance of the Pink Fairies&#x27; rhythm section of Sanderson and Russell Hunter, whose band was temporarily defunct following the departure of Paul Rudolph. During this session, former Junior&#x27;s Eyes/Bowie guitarist Mick Wayne was recruited as guitarist.

However, none of these tracks were ever completed to Took&#x27;s satisfaction, due to what Wayne later described as &quot;dope-induced thinking&quot; and consequently, Wayne, Sanderson and Hunter formed a new incarnation of the Pink Fairies. (Wayne was quickly supplanted by Wallis, leading to the Kings of Oblivion era as detailed above). Took and Secunda, meanwhile, embarked upon a different approach.

Took moved into a basement flat beneath Secunda&#x27;s Mayfair offices, which he set up as a live-in recording studio to demo material at his own ease. The flat rapidly became a magnet for the cream of musicians on the underground scene, who would contribute to the recordings while visiting Took. As well as old colleagues from Hawkwind and the Pink Fairies, Secunda reported that Took received visits from Syd Barrett, who at the time was living in Cambridge, but would shortly relocate back to London. From Secunda&#x27;s account, it would appear likely that Barrett is on the recordings done in the flat by Took and his friends.

Highlights of the session tapes were eventually released by Cleopatra Records in 1995, as &quot;The Missing Link To Tyrannosaurus Rex&quot;. A new version of the 1971 acoustic Shagrat song &quot;Beautiful Deceiver&quot; is tracklisted on the CD as &quot;Syd&#x27;s Wine&quot; and a credit for guitar and other noises is given to one Crazy Diamond, an allusion to the 1975 Pink Floyd track &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;, written in tribute to Barrett. Stripped down versions of the track &quot;Syd&#x27;s Wine&quot; reveal a second guitarist in the room and audible vocal noises.

===Various projects (1973–1976)===
After splitting with Secunda, Took worked with a number of Hawkwind members, most notably Robert Calvert, Adrian Wagner, and Nik Turner. Took was scheduled to be the support act for Calvert&#x27;s cancelled &quot;Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters&quot; tour. He and Bidwell formed at least two bands, the first with guitarist Eisuke Takahashi, the second with guitarist Hiroshi Kato and future Hawkwind bassist Adrian Shaw. The latter line-up recorded a session of four tracks in summer 1974, including Flophouse Blues (previously recorded twice in the 1972 Secunda sessions).

For some time around 1975, Took lived in the Kent towns of Canterbury and Margate, where he took on local musician and promoter Les Best as his manager. While down there, Took formed a new band, Jolly Roger and the Crimson Gash, with Takahashi now on bass and two local musicians, Bryan East on drums and a guitarist called Phil. This band gigged locally and recorded at least four tracks, produced by Turner at his home studio in Westgate on Sea.

===Steve Took&#x27;s Horns (1976–1978)===

By 1976, Took was back in London and using the band name Steve Took&#x27;s Horns, so called after a horned pendant which he habitually wore. By mid 1977, this had solidified into a steady line-up featuring, in what would be the first of several bands together over many years, Trevor Thoms and Ermanno Ghisio-Erba, later better known to Inner City Unit (ICU) fans as Judge Trev and Dino Ferari.

This group, managed by Turner&#x27;s friend since adolescence Tony Landau, recorded a session of three studio tracks – &quot;It&#x27;s Over&quot;, &quot;Average Man&quot; and &quot;Woman I Need&quot; – at Pathway Studios on 29 November 1977, before going on to perform a gig on 18 June 1978 at The Roundhouse, as part of &quot;Nik Turner&#x27;s Bohemian Love-In&quot;. Took felt the gig went badly, and decided to split up the band. The Pathway Studios session would be released on CD by Cherry Red in 2004, as &quot;Blow It!!! The All New Adventures of Steve Took&#x27;s Horns&quot;, with the CD also featuring out-takes, remixes and fresh recordings of two other Took songs – &quot;Ooh My Heart&quot; and &quot;Too Bad&quot; – which the Horns had been rehearsing back in 1977–1978.

===Involvement with Inner City Unit (1979–1980)===

Despite the break-up, Steve Took&#x27;s Horns had made a considerable impression on Took&#x27;s circle of acquaintances. Consequently, Nik Turner, having first drafted Ghisio-Erba/Ferari into his band Sphynx for a live festival LP recorded that August, went on in 1979 to incorporate the Thoms/Ghisio-Erba partnership into his new Inner City Unit.

Took guested with ICU a number of times, reuniting with his old Horns sidemen; the last recorded dates being 16 June 1980 at London&#x27;s Music Machine and sometime around 21 June 1980 at the Stonehenge Free Festival in Wiltshire – a festival frequented by other &#x27;Festival Bands&#x27;, most famously Took&#x27;s old Ladbroke Grove cohorts Hawkwind. Bootleg recordings exist of the Music Machine show and also an open-air performance on 6 May 1980 at Meanwhile Gardens in Westbourne Park, on both of which Took can be heard performing lead vocals on a cover of the Beatles&#x27; version of Larry Williams&#x27; &quot;Slow Down&quot;

==Personal life==
Took had one son in the early 1970s with partner Lou Tunstall, later the partner of Landau. Took&#x27;s other girlfriends included chronologically, Angie (1969–1971), Tracy Inder (1974–1976), Gertrude de Freyne (1977–1978) and Valerie &quot;Sam&quot; Billiet (1979–1980). As well as his own son, Steve Took was stepfather to Lemmy&#x27;s son Paul Inder (to Tracy Inder), as he later was to Billiet&#x27;s daughter.

==Death==
Steve Took died on Monday 27 October 1980 at 14 Clydesdale House, 255 Westbourne Park Road, Notting Hill, London, aged 31, in the maisonette he shared with Billiet and her young daughter. As a consequence of intervention by Best, now once again Took&#x27;s manager, royalty cheques for the Tyrannosaurus Rex &#x27;Blue Thumb&#x27; American releases had been arriving periodically and Took had received one that week. The day prior to his death, Took purchased morphine and hallucinogenic mushrooms for himself and Billiet, and the evening before Took died, they both injected themselves with the morphine.

Took&#x27;s death certificate records the cause of death as being asphyxiation after inhaling a cocktail cherry. Drugs were not listed as a contributory factor, even though Took&#x27;s death is often listed as a &quot;drugs misadventure&quot;. He was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery (Square 103, in the north-west quadrant of the infilled path around the Inner Circle).

===Opening act===
(Took, as a solo performer, was scheduled to have been the opening act on Bob Calvert&#x27;s cancelled 1974 &quot;Captain Lockheed&quot; UK tour.)

==Equipment==
As a singer songwriter, Took&#x27;s two main guitars were an Epiphone acoustic guitar decorated with stickers (including one of Eddie Cochran) used for solo work, last known to have been in the possession of Billiet, and an electric Rickenbacker used as a rhythm guitar with Took&#x27;s electric bands, currently owned by Best. Both guitars feature prominently in Keith Morris&#x27; early 1970s publicity photographs of Took.

Previously as a member of Tyrannosaurus Rex, Took&#x27;s percussion and other equipment included bongos, tabla, finger cymbals, African talking drum, kazoos, a Chinese gong and a Pixiphone (toy xylophone). As the duo reverted to electric music in early 1969, Took also played a Höfner 500/1 bass and a Chad Valley toy drumkit. In later years, when performing solo support gigs for Hawkwind, Took would often include his bongos as part of his equipment so that, later in the evening, he could guest with Hawkwind on a few songs in their set.

<text>Jordi Savall i Bernadet (; born 1 August 1941) is a Spanish conductor, composer and viol player. He has been one of the major figures in the field of Western early music since the 1970s, largely responsible for popularizing the viol family of instruments (notably the viola da gamba) in contemporary performance and recording. As a historian of early music his repertoire features everything from medieval, Renaissance and Baroque through to the Classical and Romantic periods. He has incorporated non-western musical traditions in his work; including African vernacular music for a documentary on slavery.

==Musical education==
His musical training started at age six in the school choir of his native Igualada (1947–55). After graduating from the Barcelona&#x27;s Conservatory of Music (where he studied from 1959 to 1965) he specialized in early music, collaborating with Ars Musicae de Barcelona under Enric Gispert, studying with August Wenzinger at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis in Basel, Switzerland (1968–70) and eventually succeeding Wenzinger in 1974 as professor of viola da gamba at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis.

==Ensembles==

In 1974 he formed the ensemble &quot;Hespèrion XX&quot; (known since 2000 as Hespèrion XXI), together with his wife soprano Montserrat Figueras, Lorenzo Alpert and Hopkinson Smith. Hespèrion XX favored a style of interpretation characterized simultaneously by great musical vitality and maximum historical accuracy.

In 1987 he returned to Barcelona to found La Capella Reial de Catalunya, a vocal ensemble devoted to pre-eighteenth-century music. In 1989 he founded Le Concert des Nations, an orchestra generally emphasizing Baroque period, but sometimes also Classical and even Romantic music such as, for example, &quot;Sinfonía [por] Grande Orquesta&quot; by Juan Crisóstomo Arriaga) (1806–1826).

More recently Savall has performed with family members. The family ensemble has included his wife Montserrat Figueras (who died in 2011) and their two children, Arianna and Ferran. Arianna plays the harp and sings, like her mother; Ferran plays the theorbo (bass lute) and sings, not only with his family, but also in Barcelona jazz clubs.

In several of his recordings and concerts, Savall and his ensembles have incorporated non-western musical traditions, including African vernacular music played by musicians of the ensemble 3MA (Driss el Maloumi, Ballake Sissoko, Rajery) in &quot;Les Routes de l’Esclavage&quot; or &quot;The&quot; &quot;Routes of Slavery (2017).&quot; In their performances and albums titled &quot;Orient-Occident&quot;, Savall and musicians from the Middle East have presented traditional Arabic, Christian and Sephardic music, originating from medieval Al-Andalus, Syria, Morocco and Turkey.

Additionally, Savall has created music festivals, such as the &quot;Festival musique et histoire&quot; in the Fontfroide Abbey in southern France and the Jordi Savall Festival, set in historic monasteries of Catalonia.

== Personal life ==
Savall was married to Montserrat Figueras from 1968 to her death in 2011. They had a daughter, Arianna Savall, and a son, Ferran Savall. On 23 June 2017, Savall married the Dutch philosopher Maria Bartels, in Cardona.

==Recordings==
Savall&#x27;s discography includes more than 200 recordings. Originally recording with EMI Classics, and then from 1975 on Michel Bernstein&#x27;s Astrée label, since 1998 he has recorded on his own label, Alia Vox.

<text>Mafra () is a city and a municipality in the district of Lisbon, on the west coast of Portugal, and part of the urban agglomeration of the Greater Lisbon subregion. The population in 2011 was 76,685, in an area of 291.66 km2.

It is mostly known for the sumptuous Mafra National Palace inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Built in the baroque style, the Mafra National Palace also inspired Portuguese Nobel Prize laureate José Saramago to write his novel &quot;Baltasar and Blimunda&quot; (Memorial do Convento). Other points of interest around the municipality include the Tapada Nacional de Mafra (also part of the UNESCO site), an enclosed wildlife and game reserve, and Ericeira&#x27;s World Surf Reserve, the second in the world.

==History==

The earliest archaeological remnants discovered in Mafra date to an early settlement of this region in the Neolithic period. In Seixosa, civil parish of Encarnação, in an area that was once a beach, there were archaeological remnants from the Paleolithic period, that indicate one of the oldest human presences in Europe. Similar human vestiges were discovered along the beach of São Julião, including specifically shell mounds produced by Mesolithic communities in the parish of Carvoeira. Although many of these remnants have been discovered submerged along the coast, they have been dated to 7000 B.C. During the Neolithic (5000 B.C.), the first agro-pastoral communities began to appear, remaining in small groups in strategically defensible locations. This includes sites in Igreja Nova, such as Penedo do Lexim (considered an important point in comprehending the Neolithic and Copper Age Iberian settlements) and occupied during the final part of the Neolithic, Chalcolithic and Bronze Age. Other structures from the Neolithic, today missing, such as the &quot;castle&quot; of Cheleiros or dolmens, whose name remains the only proof there is existence, such as Antas-Azueira and Antas-Gradil. In addition to the Penedo do Lexim, also in the Serra do Socorro and Tituaria, as funerary tombs from the Chalcolithic.

Tombstones, altars, tombs, coins, bins, ceramics and glass from the Roman era have been found in almost all parishes of the municipality. These dates back to the first and fourth century, including the Roman road connecting Sintra and Peniche, which crosses Mafra, intersecting the Cheleiros, Mafra, Ericeira, Paço de Ilhas and S. Domingos da Fanga da Fé (where portions of the road have been conserved). In Cheleiros and Carvoeira there are two bridges constructed by the Romans. One of these, a bridge in Santo Isidoro (as well as a 100-metre portion of the road) that was part of the Sintra-Peniche accessway, is a reflection of the areas Romanization. An important agriculture centre during the Roman occupation, anthropologists have discovered Roman coins of the eras of Augustus (27 - 14 B.C.), Claudius (41 - 54) and Magnus Maximo (383 - 388). Although it is unclear the area&#x27;s importance within Olissipo, its agricultural contributions may have contributed to its strong settlement during the period. Wine, oil and vegetables were easily commercialized across the accessway and along the rivers of Cheleiros, Ilhas and Safarujo, which were navigable until the Middle Ages.

The occupation by the Visigoths occurred after the 5th century, until the arrival of the Moors in 711, with few remnants discovered. An inscription, encountered in the parochial church of Cheleiros, a frieze in Alcainça and paeleo-Christian funerary tomb, adapted as a bunk within the Quinta da Corredoura in Mafra are the only current manifestations of these peoples.

It is certain that the built-up urban area of Mafra was once a fortified community, with the area of &quot;Rua das Tecedeiras&quot; being the best example of the walls still being visible. The limits of the castle, which was implanted on the Neolithic settlement, was successively reoccupied until the Iron Age, and taking up the entirety of the &quot;old village&quot;. This includes the space limited in the east by the &quot;Largo Coronel Brito Gorjão&quot;, the south by the &quot;Rua das Tecedeiras&quot;, west by the &quot;Palácio dos Marqueses de Ponte de Lima&quot; and north by the &quot;Rua Mafra Detrás do Castelo&quot;. A dense forest that existed until the 20th century, in &quot;Quinta da Cerca&quot; in this area, that protected and sheltered the settlement from winds.

===Kingdom===
Although Mafra was occupied by the Moors until 1147, when the area was taken by Afonso Henriques, remnants from the Moorish occupation are rare. There are suggestions that many of the churches were once mosques, such as the Matriz Church of Cheleiros, the Church of Santo André and the sanctuary of Serra do Socorro. The origin of the local toponymy &quot;Mafra&quot; is unclear, but evolved from variations of Mafara (1189), Malfora (1201) and, later, Mafora (1288). Some suggest its origin came from the Turanian &quot;Great Ara&quot;, a female fertility cult that may have existed along the rim of the early village. Others suggest that it developed from the Arabic &quot;Mahfara&quot;, which means &quot;pit&quot;, which presumed that the location was implanted within a pit, a fact that was disproved by the Arabist David Lopes. The town is, in fact, located on a hill, with two ravines (Rio Gordo and Rio dos Couros) limiting the area around it.

In 1189/1190 the village was donated by King Sancho I to the Bishop of Silves, D. Nicolau, who received the first foral (&quot;charter&quot;) a year later. This foral was followed by charters to Cheleiros in 1195, Ericeira in 1229 and Vila ao Gradil in 1327.

During the Manueline era many of the national forals were re-issued, especially after the 11th and 15th century. Between 1513 and 1516, King Manuel I issued a new foral to Mafra, Ericeira and Cheleiros, and in 1519, conceded a foral to Enxara dos Cavaleiros, while confirming a foral to Gradil (then originally donated by Afonso IV of Portugal in 1327). During the Manueline reforms, the municipalities that received these forals constructed pillories or required to refurbished their administrative markers. In the census of 18 September 1527, there was an estimated 191 residents, of which only four couples lived within the village. The reign of Manuel I was instrumental in influencing the religious architecture of the region; it is present in many of the churches, such as &quot;Nossa Senhora da Oliveira&quot; in Sobral da Abelheira, &quot;Nossa Senhora do Reclamador&quot; in Cheleiros, &quot;Nossa Senhora da Conceição&quot; in Igreja Nova, &quot;São Miguel&quot; in Milharado, &quot;Santa Eulália&quot; in Santo Estevão das Galés, or &quot;São Silvestre&quot; in Gradil. These architectural details are apparent in the doorways, vaulted ceilings and baptismal fountains. Symbols of judicial power, these markers became posts for notices, orders or commands from &quot;Corte&quot;, and were later refurbished, repositioned or lost over time.

When, in 1717, King John V began construction of the Mafra Palace, written by the Chief Architect of the Kingdom João Frederico Ludovice Mafra was barely a few hamlets that huddled around the monument. The era was also marked by the construction of a garden () and the establishment of the royal hunting park (); building projects continued throughout the reigns of Kings Joseph I (the construction and completion of the Mafra Palace), John VI (the interiors of the Palace) and Ferdinand (the redesign of the Jardim do Cerco). Yet, William Beckford, writing in August 1787, noted that Mafra was of little interest, and nothing more than a few rooftops nestled in mountains.

During the 19th century, the population began to grow around the palace, but this remained generally a rural community (an aspect that would continue until the 20th century). José Mangens in 1936 echoed similar indications of Mafra in writing about old &quot;Rua dos Arcipestres&quot;, noting: &quot;...Mafra offers nothing interesting and looks more like a hinterland village with its huts and ruined portals typical backyard, shielded with old cans...&quot;.

As Guilherme José Ferreira de Assunção later wrote, after a few visits, Queen Maria realized the advantages of establishing a military contingent in the Convent of Mafra, which she initiated. This change transformed the region and its people, who lived in a &quot;precarious conditions of existence&quot;. After 1840, the Convent was occupied by the army. By 1859, 4000 troops would enlist in the official military boot-camp (), established by King Pedro V. Unfortunately, the institution was abolished in the following year, when 94 recruits died from an infectious disease. But, from 1848–1859 and 1870–1873, the convent continued to house the Royal Military College ().

In 1887 the Infantry and Cavalry School () and, a year later, in Tapada, a firing range was established, that was later frequented by King Carlos, an enthusiast of shooting.

During the French invasion of Portugal in 1807, Napoleon made the Mafra Palace headquarters and garrison. Part of the army headed for Peniche and Torres Vedras under orders from General Luison, the remaining forces garrisoned in the Palace and Convent, while the executive staff requisitioned homes in the village. This lasted nine months, until 2 September 1807, when British forces were able to extricate the French from their positions. Meanwhile, Portuguese engineers, allied to British forces constructed a system of fortresses north of Lisbon, to secure the defence of the capital and expel the French. The &quot;Lines of Torres Vedras&quot;, as they were known, passed through the municipality of Mafra, and were constructed in 1809 and 1810. Of the 156 fortresses, 48 were located within Mafra municipality, and represented the second line of defence including sites in Malveira, Gradil, Ribamar, Carvoeira, Mafra and Ericeira. In the main only vestiges of these forts and redoubts remain, but those that are still in good condition or have been restored include the forts of Feira, Santa Susana, and Zambujal. Within the Tapada there were forts in Sunível, Milhariça, Juncal and Silvério, while a group of forts followed the left bank of the Ribeira de Safarujo to Ribamar. In the south, the last line of defence, should the French breach the defences, were the forts of Carvoeira, São Julião and Zambujal.

===Republic===
On 5 October 1910, the Mafra Palace was also the scene for an episode of the Republican Revolution that occurred in Lisbon. King Manuel II fleeing from the coup in Lisbon, took refuge and over-nighted in the Palace of Mafra. The next day they abandoned the palace, by car, travelling with his mother and grandmother to the shores of Praia dos Pescadores in Ericeira, where the royal yacht &quot;D. Amélia&quot; would take them onto Gibraltar and exile. Later that month, on 20 October, a group of monarchists gathered in the &quot;Largo D. João V&quot; with arms, where they walked to the Infantry School (), installing themselves in the convent, cutting the telephone wires and telegraph cables. The revolt was easily put down by the military but resulted in a collection of hundreds of people in the local jails.

In 1911, in the &quot;Depósito de Remonta e Garanhões&quot; which was later replaced by the Military Equestrian School () in 1950 and, seven years later, the Military Centre for Physical Education, Equestriansim and Sport (). Today, it continues to function as the Military Centre for Physical Education and Sport (), since 1993, in the &quot;Largo General Conde Januário&quot; and the Infantry School (), in the Convent of Mafra.

<text>Franklin Wilcox Napuakekaulike De Lima (born July 8, 1949) is an American comedian and singer from Hawai’i. He is most well known for his stand-up and song parodies about the politics and culture of Hawai&#x27;i, having multiple comedy specials and media appearances.

== Early life and education ==
De Lima was born and raised in Pauoa Valley within a large Catholic Portuguese and multiracial family and started comedy while he was young. After graduating from Damien Memorial School, De Lima earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology from Chaminade University and a Masters of Divinity from St. Patrick&#x27;s Seminary and University. After graduating from St. Patrick&#x27;s, he was ordained as a deacon in the Roman Catholic Church at the age of 25 before deciding to return home to start his career as a singer.

== Career ==
De Lima is one of Hawai&#x27;i&#x27;s most popular comedians, often incorporating current events and trends into music parodies as well as commenting on local ethnic culture.

De Lima, along with his musical duo David Kauahikaua and Bobby Nishida, often perform at nightclubs and concert events throughout Hawai&#x27;i and the West Coast. Thus far, De Lima&#x27;s catalog includes three videos and 17 comedy albums. He has also worked with other local comedians, most notably Andy Bumatai and Augie T. During his career, he has received 14 Nā Hōkū Hanohano Awards.

One of his most well-known appearances is in a commercial for TheCab, in which he performs the contact number for the company. He has also appeared in a number of comedy specials and news appearances as a media personality.

=== Non-profit and charity work ===
In 1980, De Lima founded the non-profit Frank De Lima Student Enrichment Program after he had recovered from a car accident and used his free time to visit schools with a purpose of helping Hawai&#x27;i&#x27;s students understand the importance of reading, studying, laughing, family, managing major emotional and physical life transitions, and providing support to middle and intermediate school students. Since the program&#x27;s inception, De Lima&#x27;s visits have increased to 300 schools statewide biennially. In recognition of his commitment to Hawai&#x27;i&#x27;s children, De Lima has been honored by Governor Ben Cayetano Kilohana Award for Volunteer of the Year and the Ellison S. Onizuka Memorial Award from the National Education Association among others.

At 50 years old, De Lima was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and has since advocated for its prevention through healthy lifestyles. On February 11, 2006, De Lima participated as a guest speaker for the Taking Control of Your Diabetes Conference and joined with the Hawai’i Department of Health as a spokesperson for the Prevent Diabetes Hawai&#x27;i campaign in March 2017. During the COVID-19 pandemic, De Lima would work again with the Department of Health to promote public awareness through songs and advertisements about COVID safety.

<doc id="885206" wikidata="Q5508825" url="?curid=885206" title="Functional gastrointestinal disorder">
<text>Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), also known as disorders of gut–brain interaction, include a number of separate idiopathic disorders which affect different parts of the gastrointestinal tract and involve visceral hypersensitivity and motility disturbances.

==Definition==
Using the Delphi method, the Rome Foundation and its board of directors, chairs and co-chairs of the ROME IV committees developed the current definition for disorders of gut-brain interaction.

A group of disorders classified by GI symptoms related to any combination of:
* Motility disturbance
* Visceral hypersensitivity
* Altered mucosal and immune function
* Altered gut microbiota
* Altered central nervous system (CNS) processing

==Classification==
Terms such as &quot;functional colonic disease&quot; (or &quot;functional bowel disorder&quot;) refer in medicine to a group of bowel disorders which are characterized by chronic abdominal complaints without a structural or biochemical cause that could explain symptoms. Other &quot;functional&quot; disorders relate to other aspects of the process of digestion.

The consensus review process of meetings and publications organised by the Rome Foundation, known as the Rome process, has helped to define the functional gastrointestinal disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlRome Foundation // Scoring Rome III Questionnaire using SAS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Successively, the Rome I, Rome II, Rome III and Rome IV proposed consensual classification system and terminology, as recommended by the Rome Coordinating Committee. These now include classifications appropriate for adults, children and neonates/toddlers.

The current ROME IV classification, published in 2016, is as follows:

A. Esophageal disorders
* A1. Functional chest pain
* A2. Functional heartburn
* A3. Reflux hypersensitivity
* A4. Globus
* A5. Functional dysphagia

B. Gastroduodenal disorders
* B1. Functional dyspepsia
** B1a. Postprandial distress syndrome (PDS)
** B1b. Epigastric pain syndrome (EPS)
* B2. Belching disorders
** B2a. Excessive supragastric belching
** B2b. Excessive gastric belching

==Causes==
FGIDs share in common any of several physiological features including increased motor reactivity, enhanced visceral hypersensitivity, altered mucosal immune and inflammatory function (associated with bacterial dysbiosis), and altered central nervous system and enteric nervous system (CNS-ENS) regulation.

The pathophysiology of FGID has been best conceptualized using biopsychosocial model help to explain the relationships between an individual factors in their early life that in turn can influence their psychosocial factor and physiological functioning. This model also shows the complex interactions between these factors through the brain-gut axis. These factors affect how FGID manifest in terms of symptoms but also affect the clinical outcome. These factors are interconnected and the influences on these factors are bidirectional and mutually interactive.

===Early life factors===
Early life factors include genetic factors, psychophysiological and sociocultural factors, and environmental exposures.
* Genetics – Several polymorphisms and candidate genes may predispose individuals to develop FGID. These include alpha-2 adrenergic and 5-HT receptors; serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (SERT, NET); inflammatory markers interleukin-(IL)10, tumor necrosis factor-(TNF) alpha, and TNF super family member 15 (TNF-SF15); intracellular cell signaling (G proteins); and ion channels (SCN5A). However, the expression of a FGID requires the influence of additional environmental exposures such as infection, illness modeling and other factors.
* Psychophysiological factors may affect the expression of these genes, thus leading to symptoms production associated with FGID.
* Sociocultural factors and family interactions have been shown to shape later reporting of symptoms, the development of FGIDs, and health care seeking. The expression of pain varies across cultures as well including denial of symptoms to dramatic expression.
* Environmental exposures  – Prior studies have shown the effect of environmental exposures in relation to the development of FGIDs. Environmental exposures such as childhood salmonella infection can be a risk factor for IBS in adulthood.

===Psychosocial factors===
There is a strong link between FGIDs and psychosocial factors. Psychosocial factors influence the functioning of the GI tract through the brain-gut axis, including the GI tract&#x27;s motility, sensitivity, and barrier function. Psychosocial factors also affect experience and behavior, treatment selection, and clinical outcome.

Psychological stress or one&#x27;s emotional response to stress exacerbates gastrointestinal symptoms and may contribute to FGID development and maintenance. Specifically in children and adolescents, anxiety and depression may present as FGID-associated somatic complaints, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Similarly, anxiety in individuals with FGIDs is linked to greater pain severity, frequency, duration, chronicity, and disabling effects. This is because psychological stress can impact the gut&#x27;s mucosal barrier functions, allowing bacteria and bacterial products to migrate and cause pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms. Conversely, since the brain-gut axis is bidirectional, GI inflammation and injury can amplify pain signals to the brain and contribute to worsened mental status, including anxiety and depression symptoms.

Individuals with FGIDs may also experience poor socialization. Due to the nature of the disease, individuals with an FGID may have difficulty with regular school or work attendance and participation in extracurricular activities, leading to isolation and a lack of peer support. This lack of peer support may lead to depression and loneliness, conditions which exacerbate FGIDs symptoms. In addition, children with FGIDs are more likely to experience bullying. As such, stressful situations which influence socialization (seen as either a lack thereof or negative experiences) may lead to an impaired functioning in patients with FGIDs.

Family interactions may also play a role in the development of FGIDs through their effects on the physical and psychosocial functioning of an individual. Family factors which may influence the development of an FGID include child attachment style, maladaptive parenting behaviors (paternal rejection and hostility), and even the parents&#x27; health status, as children of chronically ill parents experience increased somatization, insecure attachment, and worsened biopsychosocial functioning. Each of these factors leads to the accumulation of stressors, which can ultimately lead to the development of an FGID. In addition, family units which have a member with an FGIDs diagnosis are more likely to face family functioning difficulties, including challenges to familial roles, communication, affective involvement, organization, and cohesion. These challenges arise due to the nature of the disease, and ultimately worsen symptoms for the FGID patient.

===Physiology===
The physiology of FGID is characterized by abnormal motility, visceral hypersensitivity as well as dysregulation of the immune system and barrier function of the GI tract as well as inflammatory changes.
* Abnormal motility Studies have shown altered muscle contractility and tone, bowel compliance, and transit may contribute to many of the gastrointestinal symptoms of FGID which may include diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting.
* Visceral hypersensitivity In FGID there is poor association of pain with GI motility in many functional GI disorders. These patient often have a lower pain threshold with balloon distension of the bowel (visceral hyperalgesia), or they have increased sensitivity even to normal intestinal function; Visceral hypersensitivity may be amplified in patients with FGIDs.
* Immune dysregulation, inflammation, and barrier dysfunction Studies on postinfectious IBS have shown that factors such as mucosal membrane permeability, the intestinal flora, and altered mucosal immune function. Ultimately leading to visceral hypersensitivity. Factors contributing to this occurrence include genetics, psychological stress, and altered receptor sensitivity at the gut mucosa and myenteric plexus, which are enabled by mucosal immune dysfunction.
* Microbiome There has been increased attention to the role of bacteria and the microbiome in overall health and disease. There is evidence for a group of microorganisms which play a role in the brain-gut axis. Studies have revealed that the bacterial composition of the gastrointestinal tract in IBS patient differs from healthy individuals (e.g., increased Firmicutes and reduced Bacteroidetes and Bifidobacteria) However, further research is needed to determine the role of the microbiome in FGIDs.
* Food and diet The types of food consumed and diet consumed plays a role in the manifestation of FGID and also their relationship to intestinal microbiota. Studies have shown that specific changes in diet (e.g., low FODMAP—fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols, or gluten restriction in some patients) may help and reduce the symptom burden in FGID. However, no one diet has been shown to be recommended for all people.

===Brain-gut axis===
The brain-gut axis is a bidirectional mechanism in which psychosocial factors influence the GI tract and vice versa. Specifically, the emotional and cognitive centers of the brain influence GI activity and immune cell function, and the microbes within the gut regulate mood, cognition, and mental health. These two systems interact through several mechanisms. There are direct, physical connections between the central nervous system and nerve plexuses to the visceral muscles. In addition, neurotransmitters send signals related to thoughts, feelings, and pain regulation from the brain to the GI tract. The brain-gut axis influences the entire body through a variety of pathways; it regulates sensory, motor, endocrine, autonomic, immune, and inflammatory reactions. Within the physical and psychological interactions of FGIDs specifically, psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and even autism are well-linked to GI dysfunction. Conversely, functional GI diseases are linked to several comorbid psychiatric diseases. Negative emotions such as fear, anxiety, anger, stress, and pain may delay gastric emptying, decrease intestinal and colonic transit time, and induce defecation and diarrhea.

==Treatments==

===Psychotherapeutic treatments===
Because FGIDs are known to be multifactorial with external stressors and environmental factors playing a role in their development, current research demonstrates that psychological treatments may be effective in relieving some symptoms of the disease. Interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), hypnotherapy, and biofeedback-assisted relaxation training (BART) each show promise in symptom reduction. Each of these therapies aims to alter an individual&#x27;s thought patterns and behaviors while improving self-efficacy, which all work together to improve health outcomes.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is a treatment based on the theory that thinking affects one&#x27;s feelings and behaviors. As such, alterations in one&#x27;s thought process can have a positive or negative effect on actions and perceptions. Through the lens of FGIDs, a negative thought pattern may be associated with a negative physical experience of abdominal pain, discomfort, and general sickness. In theory, retraining the patient&#x27;s thought patterns can alleviate these symptoms and improve quality of life. In patients with FGIDs, CBT is an effective treatment option; one study found 87.5% of participants to be completely pain-free following treatment. Internet-based CBT (iCBT) is similarly effective, and may be a good treatment option for individuals who either cannot afford or otherwise lack access to traditional CBT.

Hypnotherapy, another method for reducing symptoms of FGIDs, teaches users how to alter their perception of uncomfortable sensations in the body. Gut-directed hypnotherapy specifically gives greater improvements in symptoms than standard treatment of the disease. Research demonstrates directed hypnotherapy to be an effective mechanism of reducing visceral hypersensitivity (a low pain threshold of the internal organs) and sympathetic activity, due to the reduced activity of the anterior cingulated cortex and state of relaxation achieved during hypnosis. For patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional abdominal pain (FAP), hypnotherapy reduces pain intensity and frequency.

BART therapies monitor the physiological changes occurring with thoughts, feelings, and emotions. These therapies aim to teach patients how to visualize the effects of the interventions they are undergoing. BART is used to improve mood and somatic responses to anxiety disorders, which may relieve some of the psychological and physiological symptoms of FGIDs. The visual, real-time feedback given through BART empowers the patient to see the difference that the therapy is making, thus giving the patient control over the physiological components of the disease. This allows the patient to maximize their mind-body connection and eventually optimize symptom management and quality of life. BART allows the patient to break the positive feedback loop of anxiety and pain, thus reducing disease exacerbations.

===Pharmaceutical treatments===
Antidepressants have been thoroughly studied as a potential treatment for FGIDs. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) show the most promise in treating some of the symptoms of FGIDs. TCAs, specifically amitriptyline, show promising results when examining common FGIDs symptoms such as pain and poor quality of life. SNRIs also demonstrate pain-relieving qualities. SSRIs are less effective in pain management, but may reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, which would, in turn, reduce some FGIDs symptoms.

==Epidemiology==
Functional gastrointestinal disorders are very common. Globally, irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia alone may affect 16–26% of the population.

==Research==
There is considerable research into the causes, diagnosis and treatments for FGIDs. Diet, microbiome, genetics, neuromuscular function and immunological response all interact. A role for mast cell activation has been proposed as one of the factors.

<text>The Swiss Air Force (; ; ; ) is the air component of the Swiss Armed Forces, established on 31 July 1914, three days after the outbreak of World War I, as a part of the army and in October 1936 as an independent service.

In peacetime, Dübendorf is the operational air force headquarters. The Swiss Air Force operates from several fixed bases (see current status) but its personnel are also trained to carry out air operations from temporary highway airstrips. In case of crisis or war, several stretches of road are specially prepared for this option.

==History==
===Early years===
The first military aviation in Switzerland took the form of balloon transport, pioneered by Swiss balloonist Eduard Spelterini, but by 1914 there was still little official support for an air corps. The outbreak of World War I changed opinions drastically and cavalry officer Theodor Real was charged with forming a flying corps. He commandeered three civilian aircraft at Bern&#x27;s airfield and set about training the initial nine pilots at a makeshift airfield close to Wankdorf Stadium, later moving to a permanent home at Dübendorf. Switzerland remained neutral and isolated during the conflict, and the air corps confined its activities to training and exercises, reconnaissance and patrol. It was only with the worsening international situation in the 1930s that an effective air force was established at great cost, with up-to-date Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Morane-Saulnier D‐3800 fighters ordered from Germany and France respectively (the Moranes were licence-built in Switzerland). The Swiss Air Force as an autonomous military service was created in October 1936.

===World War II===

Although Switzerland remained neutral throughout World War II, it had to deal with numerous violations of its airspace by combatants from both sides – initially by German aircraft, especially during their invasion of France in 1940. Zealous Swiss pilots attacked and shot down eleven German aircraft, losing two of their own, before a threatening memorandum from the German leadership forced General Guisan to forbid air combat above Swiss territory.

Later in the war, the Allied bomber offensive sometimes took US or British bombers into Swiss airspace, either damaged craft seeking safe haven or even on occasions bombing Swiss cities by accident. Swiss aircraft would attempt to intercept individual aircraft and force them to land, interning the crews. Only one further Swiss pilot was killed during the war, shot down by a US fighter in September 1944. From September red and white neutrality bands were added to the wings of aircraft to stop accidental attacks on Swiss aircraft by Allied aircraft.

From 1943 Switzerland shot down American and British aircraft, mainly bombers, overflying Switzerland during World War II: six by Swiss air force fighters and nine by flak cannons. 36 Allied airmen were killed. On 1 October 1943 the first American bomber was shot down near Bad Ragaz: Only three men survived. Officers were interned in Davos, airmen in Adelboden. The representative of the U.S. military in Bern, U.S. military attaché Barnwell R. Legge, instructed the soldiers not to flee so as to allow the U.S. Legation to coordinate their escape attempts, but the majority of the soldiers thought it was a diplomatic ruse or did not receive the instruction directly.

On 1 October 1944 Switzerland housed 39,670 internees in all: 20,650 from Italy, 10,082 from Poland, 2,643 from the United States, 1,121 from the United Kingdom (including five Australians), 822 from the Soviet Union, and 245 from France. In September the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was commissioned by the U.S. Supreme Command to organize the escapes of 1,000 American internees, but the task was not effectively accomplished before late winter 1944/45. Soldiers who were caught after their escape from the internment camp, were often detained in the Wauwilermoos internment camp near Luzern.

Official Swiss records identify 6,501 airspace violations during the course of the war, with 198 foreign aircraft landing on Swiss territory and 56 aircraft crashing there.

With the threat of WW2 and the possible need for the army and civilian population to retreat into the mountains (&quot;Reduit&quot;) as proposed by General Guisan, it was clear that the army air force needed the ability to attack enemy ground forces in the mountains. To practice this Axalp was selected. After WW2 ground attack by jet aircraft was practiced at Axalp, including strafing and bombing exercises.

During the Cold War, military liaison officers from western, eastern and non-aligned nations were invited to the screenings. Nowadays Axalpfliegerschiessen (&quot;Airshow Axalp&quot;) is a performance by the Air Force for anyone interested. It is the only event where everybody may have a look at a live exercise at 1,700 m (5,600 ft) above sea level. The use of helicopter ops at high altitudes, search &amp; rescue and firefighting demonstrations also have become a large part of the Axalp air show.

===Cold War===


After World War II, the service was renamed Airforce and Anti-Aircraft Command (). In 1966, this became a separate service independent from the Army, under its present name .

With the prospect of a future World War 3 involving nuclear weapons, jet aircraft were purchased: 75 De Havilland Vampires in 1950, followed by over 100 De Havilland Venoms and the same number of Hawker Hunters. The Venoms served until 1983; Vampires until 1990 and Hunters even until 1994. In the late 1940s Switzerland purchased the North American P-51 Mustang from US surplus WW2 stock. The aircraft initially was intended as a stop-gap solution for the Swiss army in order to maintain a defence force during a time when the outdated Bf 109E&#x27;s and Swiss built D-3801 Moranes were being phased out but the licensed production of the British designed Dh-100 Vampires and Dh-112 Venoms was not in full swing.

At the end of the 1950s, reflecting both the threat of possible invasion by the Soviet Union and a nuclear warfare, Swiss military doctrine changed to mobile defence that included missions outside its territory, in order to defeat stand-off attacks and nuclear threats, including the possibility of defensive employment of air-delivered nuclear weapons. However the inability to field a force capability to carry out such missions led to the return of traditional &quot;protection of own territory&quot; doctrine. Meanwhile, the army started preparing ad hoc airbases in the mountains, with sections of highway strengthened to act as runways and hangars carved out of the mountains.

In 1954 the first Air Radar Recruit School activated, the first early warning radar systems were installed and the concept of command &amp; control facilities at mountain summits was introduced; leading to acquisition of the FLORIDA early warning and command guidance system in 1965 followed by the current FLORAKO system in 2003. At the same time, ground-based air defence (GBAD) projects were initiated such as radar-equipped medium-caliber guns with an integrated 63 &quot;Superfledermaus&quot; (Superbat) fire control system&#x27; as well as the &quot;BL-64 ‘Bloodhound’&quot; air defence missile system (1964–1999).

After the prototypes EFW N-20 and FFA P-16, Switzerland did not invest in development combat aircraft anymore. In 1964 the procurement of the &quot;Dassault Mirage 3 fighters&quot; (1964–2002) caused a scandal due to severe budget overruns. The commander, the chief of the general staff and the minister of defence were forced to resign, followed by a complete restructuring of the air force and air defence units in 1968 and leading to separation of users and procurement officials.

In February 1968, the airfield brigade 32 was founded as part of a reorganization. The airbase group comprised all military airfields in Switzerland, around 16,000 members of the army. Built up by a:
* brigadestaff, airfield regiments Valais (1), Berner Oberland (2), Central Switzerland and Ticino (3) and a nationwide operating Light airfield division.

In combination with the Bundesamt für Militärflugplätze (BAMF), this organization, together with its ZV Central Administration in Dübendorf, constituted a robust structure, which could be activated by mobilization within 48 hours.

The Patrouille Suisse aerobatics team was founded in 1964, the 50th anniversary year of Swiss army aviation.

In 1969, air force logistics and air defence were reassigned into brigades, the &quot;Armed Forces Meteo Group&quot; and &quot;Avalanche Rescue Service&quot; came under air force and air defence command and the &quot;Para Reconnaissance Company&quot; was established.

In the 1970s major manoeuvres with over 22,000 participants took place. A new air defence concept was also introduced in which the air superiority fighter in interceptor role stood central. In 1974 the first 2 Northrop F-5 &quot;Tiger&quot; fighters were tested and in 1978 the first F-5 Tiger fighter/interceptor squadron became operational.

===Post-Cold War===
In the late 1980s changing political and military world situations implied the need for multirole aircraft in the Air Force. After evaluation, the performance of the F/A-18 Hornet was decisive in its selection. Designed for carrier-borne operations, it was optimally suited to operate from very short runways with steep take-offs. Its radar allowed detection of multiple targets and simultaneously engaging with medium-range air-to-air missiles.

Between 1996 and 1999, 34 licence-built Hornets left the assembly lines at Emmen. As the F/A-18 size is larger than either the Mirage III or Tiger II the caverns in the mountains used to protect the aircraft had to be enlarged, a continuing process as of 2011.

The 100th anniversary of the Swiss Air Force has been celebrated in 2014 with the airshow &quot;Air14&quot; at Payerne.

====Missions====
Switzerland is a small country which has always kept its neutrality. Therefore, its air component is also limited in size and not capable of fighting a long-term full scale air conflict. So the main Swiss Air Force mission is to guarantee Swiss air sovereignty and air defence throughout the country. This is achieved by: 
* maintaining general airspace control preventing unauthorised airspace intrusion through round-the-clock radar coverage (to be expanded by activation of ground-based air defence (GBAD) units)
* a 24/7 air policing as an active airspace protection.

Its secondary missions are executing airlift, reconnaissance operations, and gathering and interpreting intelligence for the Swiss political and military leadership.

====Status====

Through the years, the Swiss Air Force traditionally had been a militia-based service, including its pilots. Its inventory existed of approximately 450 aircraft whose operational service life overlapped several eras. Beginning with its separation from the army in 1966 the Air Force has been reduced in size (currently about 230 fixed and rotary-wing aircraft) moving towards a small professional cadre with fewer reserves and conscripted supporting personnel. Currently the Swiss air force has a peacetime strength of 1,600 career military and about 20,000 reservists on call.

Its air defence consists of 30 McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornets and 53 Northrop F-5 Tiger IIs (110 purchased in 1978–85). The F/A-18 pilots are career military; the F-5 pilots however are reservists (mostly air- or freight-liner pilots with F-5 rating). During reserve duty periods they are assigned to military duties refreshing their operational live flying training and rating. In 2008, the Swiss F-18 component reached its 50,000 flight hour milestone. Due to the RUAG Upgrade 21 (UG21) programme between 2004 and 2009 and the Mid-Life Update (MLU) its operational lifecycle will be guaranteed until 2022.

From 2011 the air force intended to start the Partial F-5 Tiger Replacement programme for 22 new aircraft with the JAS 39 Gripen, Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale as replacement candidates. In November 2011 the Swiss government announced its decision to buy 22 Gripen New Generation fighters. The contract for the 22 aircraft was signed at 3.1 billion Swiss francs. On 25 August 2012, the order was confirmed by both the Swedish and Swiss authorities.

The first new aircraft would be delivered in 2018 and the intention was to lease 11 current generation (eight JAS 39Cs/3 JAS 39Ds) Gripen fighters from 2016 to 2020 in order to train Swiss fighter pilots while avoiding expensive upkeep of the F-5s. However, in a national referendum in May 2014 a majority of Swiss rejected the purchase of the Gripen. This included continued operation of the Patrouille Suisse on F-5E.

To reduce the risk of a negative referendum outcome the Swiss defence ministry revised its procurement strategy. With its Air 2030 programme The Swiss government now opted for a planning order for a combined purchase of new fighters together with long-range groundbased air defences (GBAD). This programme valued at CHF8 billion ($8.1 billion), the biggest arms procurement programme in modern Swiss history. Defence minister Viola Amherd unveiled results of studies tackling the defence procurement package: fighters replacing both the current F-5 Tigers and F/A-18 Hornets scheduled to be retired in the 2020s as well as a reconfigured GBAD.

Armasuisse, the Federal Office for Defence Procurement, asked several firms to submit pricing for 40 aircraft including missile armament and logistics as well as an assessment of the number of aircraft necessary to fulfil Swiss needs and kicked off the competition for 5 types of combat aircraft under consideration (Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F-18 Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, Lockheed Martin F-35A and Saab Gripen E) at Payerne airbase. With a reconfigured GBAD system covering appx 15,000 km2 in the densely populated Swiss plateau the balance between fighter aircraft and ground-based air defence would be ensured for the next decades. On the 30th of June 2021 the F-35A was announced as the winner of the competition.

On 10 December 2010, the last 20 outdated Aérospatiale Alouette III were replaced by two VIP configuration Eurocopter EC135s and 18 Eurocopter EC635s. The first EC-635 was delivered in 2008.

====Limitations====
In peacetime the air defence radar coverage is maintained on a 24/7 basis. Until late 2020, the aviator corps however was incapable of maintaining a matching state of readiness due to limited budget and lack of staff available and was operated from 06:00-22:00 local time only. This became painfully clear as the Swiss Air Force was unable to respond to the Ethiopian Airlines ET702 hijacking in February 2014 which occurred outside routine operating hours. Agreements with Italy and France in particular enabled fighters from both air forces to enter Swiss airspace to handle the threat.

The aim for a 24-hour Quick Reaction Alert readiness of two armed F/A-18 fighters was achieved on 31 December 2020.

A major problem in defending the Swiss airspace is the size of the country. The Swiss maximum extension is only . Commercial airliners may pass over in about 15–20 minutes, while fast jets would take even less time. However, noise-abatement issues traditionally caused problems for the Swiss Air Force because of the tourist industry. Due to these reasons, the Swiss Air Force is increasingly participating in air defence training exercises with many NATO counterparts. These exercises have covered the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, the Euro 2008 football championships, and the annual World Economic Forum.

==Operational structure==


=== Air defence, air surveillance and air policing ===

During the past 35 years, Swiss military and civil airspace control depended on the FLORIDA (FLugsicherungs Operations Radar IDentifikation Alarm – Flight Ops, Radar Identifying, and Alerting) air defense system.

Since its phasing out, however, the Swiss airspace control and defence is being carried out by the THALES Raytheon FLORAKO. This system is being operated from 4 fixed locations on the Pilatus, Scopi, Weisshorn and Weissfluh mountains.

At least one of these Command, Control, and Communications (C3) facilities is always connected to the Air Defence &amp; Direction Center (ADDC or air ops centre) at Dübendorf Air Base and fully operational on-line on a 24/7 basis, monitoring Swiss airspace. Depending on the international situation, more facilities will be manned; in case of crisis or war (ADDC and 4 facilities operational) radarcoverage will be extended far beyond the Swiss boundaries. Each of these facilities is capable of making all battle management decisions in case of elimination of the ADDC or other facilities.

The first FLORAKO unit activated in 2003 and the operational lifetime of this hi-tech system is guaranteed by its manufacturers for at least 25 years. The system consists of:
*A communication system &quot;KOMSYS&quot;. Integrating element of all geographically divided parts of the FLORAKO system uniting speech, data communications, and system commands in a single data network.
*A radar station &quot;FLORES&quot;. Consisting of standard high-power search radars, advanced radars (search mode, high-update ratio, and special functions), and civil authority mono-pulse secondary radars. The 4 radar stations are the main data sources and are complemented by existing military and civil radar data.
*A radar layer-system &quot;RALUS&quot;. Translating the data automatically into flight paths and producing a complete civil-military air picture for all authorities.
*A warning message system &quot;LUNAS-EZ&quot;. AirOps Centres are the combining factors between the FLORAKO-system with real-time data (air picture, planning, and environmental data) and its military users. Workstations are identically configured and built accordingly to latest ergonomics, visual colour high resolution, menu guidance, and known user environment. The Dübendorf &quot;Air Defence &amp; Direction Centre&quot; – as well as the air operations units in the Alps – are equally equipped, thus assuring full-time operational redundancy in producing the actual air-picture; permanent defence of airspace; early warning; command and control; coordination of civil and military air traffic and air policing.
*The Military-Civil Airspace Management System MICAMS. This secondary system provides a computing backup for flexible airspace use for both civil and military flight security.

The radar system may eventually be completed by 2 mobile TAFLIR (TAktische FLIeger Radars – Tactical Flight Radars). These AN/MPQ-64 radars are a variant of the Northrop Grumman AN/TPS-75 and are deployable in areas of difficult terrain or where specific coverage is needed. Peacetime TAFLIR deployment locations are at Dübendorf Air Base and Emmen. In time of crisis or at war they can be deployed anywhere.

Air surveillance in Switzerland (including the airspace of Liechtenstein) is also called Permanent Air Surveillance (PLÜ); uninterrupted 24/365 coverage with the FLORAKO system, wherein the Identifications Officer (IDO) and Track Monitor (TM) monitor and represent the general Recognized Air Picture (RAP).

The Air Force has several operational centres. In peacetime, the primary military command centre is at Dübendorf Air Base joint with the civilian air traffic control Skyguide. The locations of the other operational centres are classified. The command centres are part of the unit &quot;Einsatz Luftwaffe,&quot; the chief of which is directly subordinate to the commander of the Air Force. It consists of the operations center of the Air Force, redundant direct connections to the emergency organizations (air rescue and federal police), as well as to the 2 Skyguide air traffic centers (Geneva and Zurich) and to the relevant military and civilian air traffic control centers of neighboring countries.

Air policing is the main peacetime activity of the Swiss Air Force. The Air Force distinguishes two types of mission, live mission (observation, identification) and hot mission (intervention).

===Ground based air defense===
The Ground Based Air Defence (GBAD) is currently headquartered at Emmen airbase. Formerly it used the fixed emplacement BL-64 &quot;Bloodhound&quot; missile system. The current system uses three shorter ranged but mobile systems which may be deployed anywhere.
*Rapier a mobile 10 km range surface-to-air system. Operated as towed four-missile launchers and related command and control vehicles – 40 units in service.
*FIM-92 Stinger man portable 4.8 km range shoulder-launched infrared surface-to-air missile with a related Stinger Alert short range radar – 96 units in service.
*Oerlikon 35 mm twin cannon 4 km range towed anti-aircraft artillery operating with a Skyguard fire control radar with 15 km detection range. 24 units in service.

===Supporting third party organisations===
The Swiss Air Force supports third party organisations with equipment and staff. It provides the civilian radar Skyguide with FLORAKO radardata enabling safe air traffic management. Air Force helicopters and drones regularly conduct surveillance flights for the Border Guard Corps GWK, for general surveillance at major events and search flights (SAR) for national police and Rega (air rescue). The Fire Department also uses its drones and helicopters with FLIR to locate forestfires and to extinguish them with &quot;Bambibuckets&quot;. 3 helicopters supported &quot;Swisscoy&quot; in the KFOR, some supported in large-scale events for relief abroad (e.g. Sumatra after the tsunami). The Air Force supports the Federal Office of Public Health, National Emergency Operations Centre and conducts regular ENSI flights collecting airquality data and radioactivity measurements; it also does parabolic F-5 flights as part of the ARES program of the ETH Zurich and other research institutions. The Air Force also modified all diplomatic flights outside the opening times of the FOCA and represents the REGA (Swiss Air Rescue) communication systems. The Swiss Air Force operates the Rescue Coordination Center &quot;RCC Zurich&quot; on behalf of the FOCA at the Dübendorf Air Base.

== The future ==

;Planned acquisitions and projects in progress
*FLORAKO upgrading: In 2017 Armasuisse and RUAG confirmed the contract with Thales for the upgrading of the Master A and M type radars in the FLORAKO system. 
*ADS15: As part of the Armament Program 2015, six Elbit Hermes 900 will replace the remaining 15 RUAG Ranger ADS-95s that are still in service by 2019.
*Transport aircraft: In 2015, Minister of Defence Ueli Maurer gave assurances that a transport aircraft purchase was planned by 2018. 
*BODLUV2020: The three anti-aircraft systems (Oerlikon 35 mm twin cannon FIM-92 Stinger and Rapier missile) should be replaced by 2020 by two systems which will have their command and control connected to the FLORAKO System.
*24h/365 QRA15: by 2020 the Swiss Air Force intends to have a round-the-clock 15 minutes Quick Reaction Alert capability (15 minutes from an alert to fighters becoming airborne) with fully armed F/A-18 fighter jets, based at Militärflugplatz Emmen and at Payerne Air Base (the main base for QRA operations); During this time, the presence of F/A-18s will be steadily increased to full strength at permanent readiness.
*F/A-18 replacement: In June 2021, it was announced that the Lockheed F-35A had been chosen to replace Switzerland&#x27;s fleet of F/A-18 Hornets. A total of 36 aircraft are planned to be procured, alongside which Switzerland will also purchase five MIM-104 Patriot SAM systems. Switzerland allocated $6.48 billion funds for total 36 F-35A fighter jets. Raytheon America to partner with Rheinmetall Air Defence and Radar Systems and Mercury Systems to provide Patriot air defense systems to Switzerland as part of $2.16 billion contract.

* Hornet Solo Display – A single F/A-18 Hornet.
* Super Puma Display – A single Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma.
* Parachute Reconnaissance Company 17 performs parachute displays as the &quot;Air Show Team&quot;.

==== Aircraft serial numbering ====
Swiss military aircraft are identified by a role prefix and number, the prefix or code identifies the role and the serial numbers the type or variant, the system was introduced in 1936.

This is followed by a number having from two to four digits 

In four digit numbers, the first digit identifies the aircraft type. The next three are the sub-type and individual aircraft, with the first and sometimes second for the subtype; and the third and sometimes fourth for the individual aircraft, In the following examples, &quot;x&quot; identifies the individual aircraft:
*Mirage IIIBS = J-200x
*Mirage IIIDS = J-201x
*Mirage IIIRS = R-21xx
*Mirage IIIC = J-22xx
*Mirage IIIS = J-23xx
*F-5E = J-30xx (serials previously used for the FFA P-16)
*F-5F = J-32xx
*F/A-18C = J-50xx
*F/A-18D = J-52xx

&quot;3 digit numbers&quot; Most aircraft have three numbers. These follow a broadly similar pattern to the four-digit numbers, although there are exceptions.

Transport aircraft have a first digit of &quot;3&quot; for helicopters and &quot;7&quot; for fixed wing aircraft.

&quot;2 digit numbers&quot; 
Target drones have only two numbers.

&quot;Radio callsigns&quot;
*Bambini-Code – a tactical radio code used from the 1940s to the 1990s

<text>Eugene Znosko-Borovsky (; 16 August 1884 – 31 December 1954) was a Russian chess player, music and drama critic, teacher and author. Born in Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg Governorate, he settled in Paris in 1920, and lived there for the rest of his life.

==Biography==
Znosko-Borovsky learned to play chess as a young boy. He won prizes in local and regional tournaments, whilst progressing to a first-class education at the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum.

Making his international chess tournament debut at Ostend in 1906, where he won the brilliancy prize for his game against Amos Burn, Znosko-Borovsky&#x27;s playing career was frequently interrupted by other events in his life. Between 1909 and 1912 he was a prominent critic of the Modernist &quot;Apollo&quot; magazine, befriended many Russian poets and writers of the Silver Age, and was Nikolay Gumilev&#x27;s second in his 1909 duel against Maximilian Voloshin. Decorated and wounded in military conflicts, he first served as a volunteer in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 and 1905 and was again called into service during World War I. Following evacuation, he was taken by a British ship to Constantinople and from there proceeded to Paris, which remained his home from 1920 onwards.

As a player, Znosko-Borovsky fell short of the very highest level. He did have some notable results in international competition, including Paris 1930, where he finished first without loss, ahead of Savielly Tartakower, Andor Lilienthal and Jacques Mieses, and first prize in the premier tournament at Folkestone 1933. Success often came in individual encounters with his more distinguished peers; he won impressive games against José Raúl Capablanca, Akiba Rubinstein, Max Euwe and Efim Bogoljubov as well as a short match with Edgard Colle in 1922. He was also highly skilled at simultaneous exhibition play.

In conversation and as a lecturer, teacher or writer of chess, his abilities were widely acknowledged, particularly in Russia and France where he contributed regular articles and columns to magazines and newspapers. Indeed, it was in the field of writing that he excelled, penning many popular books including &quot;The Evolution of Chess&quot; (1910), &quot;Capablanca&quot; and &quot;The Muzio Gambit&quot; (both 1911). &quot;Capablanca and Alekhine&quot; followed World War I and most of his later offerings were translated into English, principally &quot;The Middle Game in Chess&quot;, &quot;How Not to Play Chess&quot;, &quot;How to Play the Chess Openings&quot;, &quot;How to Play Chess Endings&quot; (1940), and &quot;The Art of Chess Combination&quot;.

==Tribute==
After hearing of his death, Gerald Abrahams wrote a personal tribute:

:The death of Znosko-Borovsky deprives the chess world of one of the few survivors of an intellectually rich generation, the Russian Masters of the old regime ... My own memories of Znosko go back to 1923–24. I found him then, and at all times later, a stimulating friend and a delightful conversationalist in many subjects. His reputation as a dramatic and literary critic was, at one time considerable in Europe, though England knew little of this. Those who have read his chess works, however, must be aware that their writer was a &quot;kultur mensch&quot; in the best sense. Withal, he was stoical in adversity (adversity was always his lot) and possessed of great humour and resilience ... As a player, he suffered from the demands of a professionalism that is incompatible with great performance: but he leaves records of many games which reveal, if not genius, then a great talent ... those who knew him will all agree that his life enriched, and in a degree inspired, the chess world.

<text>Ericeira () is a civil parish and seaside community on the western coast of Portugal (in Mafra municipality, located 35km northwest of the center of Lisbon, about 45km by road) considered the surfing capital of Europe. It is also one of only two European spots among the World Surfing Reserves because of its exceptional coastline conditions. Ericeira&#x27;s population in 2011 was estimated in 10,260, covering an area of 12 km2.

Ericeira was a popular summer retreat for many of Lisbon&#x27;s families in the 1940s and 1950s. Today, it is a popular destination for local and visiting tourists, as well as surfers from around the world (owing to the forty beaches with good conditions in the area).

==History==

The region&#x27;s taxonomic name has a convoluted history. Ericeira is believed to have originated from &quot;Ouriceira&quot;, itself a derivative of &quot;Ouriço&quot;, referring to the name for sea urchins (used in the parish&#x27;s coat-of-arms). One legend suggested that Ericeira was the &quot;terra de ouriços&quot; (&quot;land of ouriços&quot;), owing to what was assumed to be an abundance of sea-urchins along the beaches. However, recent investigations, archived in the Museum of the Misericórdia, confirm that the animal mentioned was not an &quot;ouriço&quot;, but an &quot;ouriço-caixeiro&quot; (&quot;hedgehog&quot;), a species associated with the Phoenician goddess Astarte. The ancient settlement presumably dates from the passage and colonization of the Phoenicians.

The region&#x27;s first foral (&quot;charter&quot;) dates to 1229, when it was issued by friar D. Fernão Rodrigues Monteiro, Master of the Cavalry and the Military Order of São Bento de Avis, which was later reformed by King Manuel, in 1513.

After the disappearance of King Sebastian of Portugal, during the Battle of Alcácer Quibir, there arose several pretenders to the throne. One of these was the &quot;King of Ericeira&quot;, a young hermit based in the Chapel of São Julião, south of the village of Ericeira, who passed himself off as Dom Sebastian. He crowned a Queen, distributed handouts and punished his detractors, conceding several noble titles. In the end, he was taken to the guillotine, and his supporters too ended-up on the gallows.

Ericeira was an area much frequented for its climatic and seaside comforts. In fact, Charles Lepierre, a chemical engineer referred to Ericeira&#x27;s beaches as &quot;a focus of the major concentration of iodine in all of the northern Portuguese coast&quot;. In 1803, the Bishop of Coimbra took regular baths in Ericeira, and the Royal Family including Queen Maria Pia of Savoy in 1864 also frequented its waters. At the end of the 19th century, beginning of the 20th century, many of Lisbon&#x27;s local aristocracy began to build homes in the parish, including the Burnays, Ulriches and Rivottis.

The development of the commercial port made Ericeira a fundamental pole of the region&#x27;s economy. Reports dating from 1834 noted the anchoring of 175 boats transporting products to the village, principally cereals (which were then distributed into the interior) while exports, especially wines and spirits, were sent to the Algarve, the islands and other locations. The customshouse in Ericeira supported an area extending from Cascais to Figueira da Foz, and the port was the fourth most important in the country, after Lisbon, Porto and Setúbal. With the construction of the western railway and the development of land transport, the port of Ericeira lost much of its importance. At the end of the 19th century, several warehouses and supply shops for sardine fishers were built, employing 500 men but altering the old fishing characteristics of the site. Ericeira&#x27;s golden age of prosperity during the 19th century, when the port was the busiest in Estremadura.

During the Second World War, the region became a refuge for several foreign communities, including pockets of Poles, Germans, French, Belgians and Dutch expatriates fleeing Nazi persecution in their homelands.

Ericeira is more famously known for the day that King Manuel II of Portugal went into exile, from the &quot;Praia dos Pescadores&quot;, after the outbreak of the 5 October 1910 revolution. It was about 3:00 in the afternoon of 5 October 1910, when the 20-year-old monarch, accompanied by Queen Amélie of Orleans and Queen Mother Maria Pia, arrived from Mafra. Arriving by car, escaping from the recent Republican revolution in Lisbon, the king was bound for the royal yacht &quot;D. Amélia&quot; offshore. The details were later immortalized in 1928 by Júlio Ivo, then president of the municipal council of Mafra (during the presidency of Sidónio Pais, who explained: &quot;...the automobiles stopped and the Royal Family got out, they followed the &quot;Rua do Norte&quot; to the &quot;Rua de Baixo&quot;, to the narrow lane that connects the two roads, almost in front of the &quot;Travessa da Estrela&quot;...On arrival at the &quot;Rua de Baixo&quot;, the Royal Family went in the following order: at the front, King Manuel; followed by Maria Pia, then Amélia... the King...climbed aboard the boat using crates and baskets of fish...the flagman signalled with his hat, and the first boat, the &quot;Bomfim&quot;, carrying the blue and white flag on the stern, followed by the rowers, taking the King...the crowds along the coast were immense. Everyone silent, but many with tears running from their eyes...The King was very pallid, Amélia animated, Maria Pia was overwhelmed...The boats had hardly come alongside the yacht when in the village there appeared, coming from Sintra, an automobile with civil revolutionaries, armed with carbines and bearing bombs, which they later indicated they were prepared to throw at the beach if they had reached it at the time of the departure...&quot;.

Its location, near Lisbon, and the development of the roadway network permitted, after the 1950s, a greater migration of summer sun-seekers, which helped to modify the character of the area. Initially a commercial fishing port, Ericeira was transformed into an urban agglomeration dependent on seasonal tourism. The devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary under her title of Our Lady of Good Voyage began in Ericeira.

==Geography==
Along its northern border is &quot;Coxos Break&quot; point, known as one of the best professional surfing areas in Europe, and not an area for beginners. The parish consists of the settlements Bairro Arsénio Amadeu, Calçadinha Preta, Ericeira, Fonte Boa, Fonte Boa dos Nabos, Lapa da Serra, Pinhal de Frades and Seixal.

==Economy==

Ericeira is a seaside town surrounded by many beaches and many surf spots recognized in Europe and the world as world class. Tourism-related businesses ranging from foodservice to hospitality, as well as commerce and fishing, are the main activities in the town. 

Ericeira is the home to Portugal&#x27;s first/largest surfing association/club, the Ericeira Surf Clube. Founded in 1993, it developed from the surfing unit of the Ericeira Naval Club, which organized local, regional and national competitions in surf, bodyboard, kneeboard and longboard throughout the years. In addition, the Surf Club began a school to train local athletes and visiting tourists who wanted to learn how to surf.

In the 2020s especially after the global pandemic, the town has become popular with internationally mobile freelancers - so called digital nomads - who are increasingly engaging with the local population, with co-working spaces, online community groups and meetups such as Open Coffee Ericeira becoming increasingly popular.

The beach of &quot;Ribeira d&#x27;Ilhas&quot;, which routinely hosts a round of the ASP World Tour Surf Championship and is widely regarded as one of the best beaches in Europe for this sport, is located to the north of the town. In 2011, Ericeira was chosen by the WSR to be one of the World Surfing Reserves, together with Malibu and Santa Cruz in California, Manly Beach in Australia, and Huanchaco in Peru. The local council have redeveloped the Ribeira d&#x27;Ilhas foreshore to commemorate and show their support for the importance of surfing to the local culture and economy.

The Grupo Desportivo União Ericeirense, widely referred to as Ericeirense (which means “from Ericeira”), has a football team and was founded on 1 December 1921. Matheus Nunes, as a footballer, and Luís Freire, as a coach, are among the most successful persons in the sport who once were part of the team.

<text>Eccleshall () is a town and civil parish in the Stafford district, in the county of Staffordshire, England. It is located seven miles northwest of Stafford, and six miles west-southwest of Stone. Eccleshall is twinned with Sancerre in France.

==History==
According to the Domesday Book, Eccleshall in 1086 was no more than a small village of about one hundred inhabitants. A few fragments of stone at the base of the tower of the present Parish Church of Holy Trinity suggest that a stone church was in existence about this time and the base of a 10th-century cross still stands outside the church. The oldest part of the church, the pillars and arches of the nave, were begun in 1180 while the remainder of the church was completed during the 13th century, with a fine clerestory being added in the 15th century.

Eccleshall became important as a market town for the surrounding area. In 1153 it was granted the right to hold a weekly market. Around the beginning of the 13th century the village had become a town with the granting of ‘Borough’ status and by 1259 had obtained a charter to hold an annual fair at Ascensiontide. By the time of the survey of the bishop’s estates in 1298 about five hundred people lived in the village, mainly craftsmen or engaged in agriculture.

To the Bishop of Lichfield, Eccleshall was conveniently situated on the main road between the centres of the diocese in Chester, Lichfield and Coventry. Land was reputedly granted to St Chad and in 1200 Bishop Geoffrey de Muschamp was granted by King John a ‘licence to crenellate’ a castle. From then on until the 1860s the site would provide a residence for the Bishops of Lichfield.

However the ruins which exist today are those a later castle built in 1305 by Bishop William Langton, a friend of King Edward I and later Chancellor of England. This was the great era of castle building and he built an imposing fortress with four corner towers and a wide moat. Eccleshall castle briefly played a part in the War of the Roses, when it was used as a base for the Lancastrian Queen Margaret of Anjou and her troops before and after her defeat at the Battle of Blore Heath in 1459.

Bishop William Overton (1580–1609) was probably responsible, in 1580, for bringing two glass making families from Lorraine, Tyzack and Henzey to Bishop&#x27;s Wood near Eccleshall to set up glass production. Manufacturing ceased around 1615, however, the site of one glass furnace has been excavated in recent times and is preserved and can be seen in Bishop&#x27;s Wood.

In June 1643 the castle was besieged by Sir William Brereton and his Parliamentary forces encamped around the church. Their guns caused considerable damage to the walls but the castle held out. When the Parliamentary forces finally took the castle on 30 August they found that the bishop (Robert Wright) had died of a heart attack during the siege and most of the defenders were either drunk or had gone into town drinking in the taverns. The castle was sacked but enough of the building remained to be used as a prison for Royalist gentry.

With the development of turnpike trusts in the 18th century as a method of financing road building and improvements, coach travel throughout England had become faster and more reliable. With its position on the main London to Chester road Eccleshall became an important stopping point for coaches on several different routes and the town prospered, the inns in particular. Until recently the large stables at the Royal Oak Hotel could be seen.

For three centuries leather working and shoemaking had been important domestic industries in Eccleshall, but by the end of the 19th century both had almost ceased, with the growth of the mechanised shoe factories in nearby Stafford.

The film &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going!&quot;, Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s classic romantic comedy made in 1945 highlights Eccleshall in the scene where Joan Webster (Wendy Hiller) meets up with her father in London, and he informs her that he had travelled all the way from Eccleshall to see her that evening.

==Community==
The high street has numerous shops, pubs, restaurants and businesses. A farmers&#x27; market is held every month and the town holds its major festival every two years. The Eccleshall Show is held every summer at Sugnall Parks.

Eccleshall High Street, with many Georgian and earlier buildings, is a conservation area. The town has been a regular winner in the Britain in Bloom competition and, in summer, the main parts of Eccleshall are bedecked with colourful floral baskets, organised by the town&#x27;s civic group, the &#x27;Ecclian Society&#x27;.

Eccleshall F.C. are an English non-league football club. They play in the North West Counties League Division One. The reserves play in the Staffordshire County Senior League Premier Division.

HM Prison Drake Hall is a women&#x27;s closed prison. It is approximately a mile north of the town, near the village of Sturbridge.

Nearby Cold Meece houses a British Army training area that used to be a Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Swynnerton. It is often used by the Air Training Corps and the Army Cadet Force.

== Media ==
In terms of television, Eccleshall is served by BBC Midlands Today and ITV News Central.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Stoke, Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire, and Greatest Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire. 

The local newspapers are the Staffordshire Newsletter and Express and Star, who have offices in Stafford, and The Stone and Eccleshall Gazette which comes from Stone.

==Transport==
The A519 road runs through the town. Junction 14 of the M6 motorway is five miles south of Eccleshall on the A5013.

The nearest railway station was Norton Bridge, three miles east, which formally closed in 2017. The nearest operational railway stations are Stafford and Stone.

Chaserider operate Monday to Saturday bus service 432 between Eccleshall and Stafford, with some journeys via Woodseaves.

==Places of interest==

Holy Trinity Church dates from 1195. The tombs of five Bishops of Lichfield lie in the church, that of William Overton beside the altar being particularly notable.
Eccleshall Castle was the palace of the Bishop of Lichfield. The Domesday Book details that the Eccleshall estate had been given to the Bishop of Lichfield some time before the Norman conquest, possibly as early as the 7th century. By the time Bishop John Lonsdale died in 1867 the lack of a railway was one of the main reasons that his successor Bishop Selwyn gave for the decision to sell the castle and thus sever the long association of Eccleshall with the Bishop of Lichfield. At the beginning of the last century the castle passed into the hands of the present owners, the Carter family (distant relations of former US President Jimmy Carter). The town itself was a relatively important market town by the time of the Wars of the Roses. In 1459, the castle was briefly a residence for the Queen, Margaret of Anjou, in her preparation for the Battle of Blore Heath, the site of which lies a few miles north of the town near Market Drayton. Later, the castle suffered damage during the English Civil War.

The restored Mill Meece Pumping Station is to the north of Eccleshall.

Eagle House, Eccleshall is a Grade II listed building in Eccleshall which is currently used as a Bed and Breakfast. Eagle House was originally erected to replace the old Eccleshall Poorhouse (Workhouse) and was built using construction materials from the demolished local Town Hall.

==Industry==
For three centuries leather working and shoemaking had been important domestic industries in Eccleshall, but by the end of the 19th century both had almost ceased, with the growth of the mechanised shoe factories in nearby Stafford. Glass production was important to the town in the 14th and 15th centuries.

Farming remains a major activity in the area.

Eccleshall has been the site for an operational biofuel power station since September 2007, fuelled by elephant grass, the majority of which is grown by local farmers within a 30-mile radius. The maximum capacity of 2.6MW makes Eccleshall one of the first carbon-neutral towns in the UK, according to the company that runs the plant.

<text>Thomas Augustus Jaggar Jr. (January 24, 1871 – January 17, 1953) was an American volcanologist. He founded the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory and directed it from 1912 to 1940. The son of Thomas Augustus Jaggar, Jaggar Jr. graduated with a PhD in geology from Harvard University in 1897. In 1902, he was one of the scientists that the United States sent to investigate the volcanic disasters at La Soufrière volcano, St Vincent, and Mont Pelée, Martinique, which he credited with inspiring him to make a life&#x27;s work out of geology. He became head of the department of geology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1906.

Jaggar traveled to Hawaii in 1909, where he began fundraising to establish the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO). Jaggar became the first director of HVO in 1912, and remained at HVO until 1940, when he retired and became a research associate in geophysics at the University of Hawaii. Jaggar married twice in his life, and had two children. He died in 1953 in Honolulu, Hawaii.

==Biography==
Jaggar was born on January 24, 1871, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Thomas Augustus Jaggar and Anna Louisa (née Lawrence). Growing up, Jaggar hiked with his father, and in 1875 climbed Mount Vesuvius. His father was the first Bishop of Southern Ohio. Jaggar graduated with a baccalaureate degree in 1893 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1894, both in geology and both from Harvard University. After studying petrography and mineralogy at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and Heidelberg University, he graduated with a Ph.D. in geology from Harvard in 1897. Jaggar was named an associate professor of geology at Harvard in 1903, and, during summers, worked for the United States Geological Survey (USGS). He felt strongly that experimentation was the key to understanding earth science. Jaggar constructed water flumes bedded by sand and gravel to understand stream erosion and melted rocks in furnaces to study the behavior of magmas.

As he matured as a scientist, he began to feel the increasing need for field experimentation. Jaggar wrote: Whereas small scale experiments in the laboratory helped me to think about the details of nature, there remained the need to measure nature itself.

In May 1902, he was one of the scientists sent from the United States to investigate the volcanic disasters at Soufrière and Mont Pelée. With the help of the U.S. Navy and the National Geographic Society, Jaggar landed on the steaming shores of Martinique some 13 days after the disaster. The same year, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In his autobiography published in 1956, Jaggar recounts, 
It was hard to distinguish where the streets had been. Everything was buried under fallen walls of cobblestone and pink plaster and tiles, including 20,000 bodies...As I look back on the Martinique experience I know what a crucial point in my life it was...I realized that the killing of thousands of persons by subterranean machinery totally unknown to geologists...was worthy of a life work.

On April 15, 1903, Jaggar married Helen Kline, with whom he had two children, Russell Kline and Eliza Bowne. The couple divorced in 1914. In 1906 he became head of Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s department of geology. The next 10 years of Jaggar&#x27;s life brought expeditions to the scenes of great earthquakes and eruptions in Italy, the Aleutians, Central America, and Japan. With each trip, Jaggar became increasingly concerned that his field studies were but brief, inadequate snapshots of long-term, dynamic, earth processes. After the 1908 Messina earthquake killed 125,000 people near Mount Etna in Italy, Jaggar declared that &quot;something must be done&quot; to support systematic, ongoing studies of volcanic and seismic activity. He traveled to Hawaii in 1909 at his own expense, and determined that Kilauea was to be the home of the first American volcano observatory. He would work on that project the rest of his life.

He married co-worker Isabel Peyran Maydwell, a widowed schoolteacher from California, in 1917. Jagger established a volcano monitoring station at Mount Lassen and another two on the Aleutian Islands, though the Mount Lassen station did not survive the Great Depression. To explore inaccessible Aleutian Islands beaches, Jaggar designed amphibious vehicles which would form the basis of beach landing craft used by the United States military in World War II, an achievement for which he received the Franklin L. Burr Prize from the National Geographic Society in 1945. After his retirement from the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) in 1940, Jaggar remained active at the University of Hawaii, where he was a research associate in geophysics. He died in Honolulu on January 17, 1953, at age 81.

==Hawaiian Volcano Observatory==

After a lecture on his Martinique expedition in Honolulu, Jaggar was approached by Lorrin A. Thurston, a prominent Honolulu lawyer and businessman. Like Jaggar, Thurston believed that Kilauea was a prime site for a permanent volcano observatory and inquired of Jaggar, &quot;Is it then a question of money?&quot; Within a year of their conversation, Thurston and other businessmen raised financial backing for the Hawaii Volcano Research Association (HVRA). A small observing station was set up on the rim of Halemaumau crater (a pit crater inside Kilauea&#x27;s summit caldera). In July 1909, Jaggar received funding of $25,000 () from the Whitney Estate through the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for use in construction of the HVO; funding also came the HVRA and the people of Hilo. In 1912, construction of the HVO began: in February, prisoners sentenced to a term of hard labor by the Territory of Hawaii dug through Kilauea ash and pumice to a thick layer of pahoehoe lava on which to place concrete piers where seismometers would be mounted. In spring of that year, Jaggar left MIT to become the first director of the HVO.

During his early years as director, Jaggar struggled to obtain private endowments with the hope of eventually securing sponsorship by the federal government. At one point, Jaggar raised pigs to fund the HVO. In 1919, Jaggar convinced the National Weather Service to provide funding for the HVO. The USGS took over its operation in 1924, with the exception of a brief hiatus during the Great Depression when HVO was run by the National Park Service. The USGS established a Section of Volcanology in 1926, with Jaggar named as its first chief.

In 1922, he suggested using Kilauea&#x27;s heat for geothermal energy:

Volcano power for human use is a possibility, for heat is power, and volcanoes generate heat. ... Cracks near Halemaumau have opened from time to time which sometimes get hotter and hotter until they become glowing furnaces, emitting apparently merely hot air. If a boring will start such a furnace, then twenty holes at such a place will run a respectable engine.

On February 3, 1923, when an 8.4-magnitude earthquake hit the southeastern coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, Jaggar tried to warn the Hilo harbormaster about the possibility that a tsunami could have been generated. Jaggar&#x27;s warning was not taken seriously and one fisherman was killed when the tsunami hit, with damage estimated at $1.5 million. According to authors Boris W. Levin and Mikhail Nosov, this was the first tsunami warning in the &quot;far field.&quot; In 1935, Jagger called on the United States Army to bomb lava flow that would soon reach the headwaters of the Wailuku River, which supplied water for the town of Hilo. His hope was that the lava tubes or channels could be destroyed, thereby robbing the advancing flow while feeding another flow that would re-cover the same area. The flow was bombed on December 27, and lava stopped flowing during the night or early morning of January 2, 1936. According to the United States Geological Survey, &quot;Whether or not the bombing stopped the 1935 Mauna Loa lava flow remains a controversial topic today.&quot;

Jaggar remained director of HVO until 1940. The Thomas A. Jaggar Museum in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is named for him. In 2018, the museum closed when earthquakes associated with the eruption damaged its structure. , many of the museum&#x27;s artifacts are in storage.

<text>The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) is an agency of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and one of five volcano observatories operating under the USGS Volcano Hazards Program. Based in Hilo, Hawaii, the observatory monitors six Hawaiian volcanoes: Kīlauea, Mauna Loa, Kamaʻehuakanaloa (formerly Lōʻihi), Hualālai, Mauna Kea, and Haleakalā, of which, Kīlauea and Mauna Loa are the most active. The observatory has a worldwide reputation as a leader in the study of active volcanism. Due to the relatively non-explosive nature of Kīlauea&#x27;s volcanic eruptions for many years, scientists have generally been able to study ongoing eruptions in proximity without being in extreme danger.

Prior to May 2018, the observatory&#x27;s offices were located at Uwekahuna Bluff, the highest point on the rim of Kīlauea Caldera. The summit collapse events during the 2018 eruption of Kīlauea damaged those facilities, so the observatory has since been operating from various temporary offices located in Hilo on the Island of Hawaii.

==History==

Besides the oral history of Ancient Hawaiians, several early explorers left records of observations. Rev. William Ellis kept a journal of his 1823 missionary tour, and Titus Coan documented eruptions through 1881.
Scientists often debated the accuracy of these descriptions. When geologist Thomas Jaggar of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology gave a lecture in Honolulu in 1909, he was approached by businessman Lorrin A. Thurston (grandson of Asa Thurston who was on the 1823 missionary tour) about building a full-time scientific observatory at Kīlauea. The Hawaiian Volcano Research Association was formed by local businessmen for its support. George Lycurgus, who owned the Volcano House at the edge of the main caldera, proposed a site adjacent to his hotel and restaurant.

In 1911 and 1912, small cabins were built on the floor of the caldera next to the main active vent of Halemaʻumaʻu, but these were hard to maintain.
MIT added $25,000 in support in 1912 from the estate of Edward and Caroline Whitney to build a more permanent facility. The first instruments were housed in a cellar next to the Volcano House called the Whitney Laboratory of Seismology. Inmates from a nearby prison camp had excavated through of volcanic ash. Massive reinforced concrete walls supported a small building built on top of the structure. Professor Fusakichi Omori of Japan, now best known for his study of aftershocks, designed the original seismometers. This seismograph vault (building number 29 on a site inventory) is state historic site 10–52–5506, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 24, 1974, as site 74000292.
From 1912 until 1919, the observatory was run by Jaggar personally. Many important events were recorded, although as pioneers, the team often ran into major problems. For example, in 1913 an earthquake opened a crack in a wall and water seeped in. The windows meant to admit natural light caused the vault to heat up in the intense tropical sun. The opening of the national park in 1916 (at the urging of Thurston) brought more visitors to bother the scientists, but also park rangers who would take over public lectures. The prison that had supplied laborers was replaced by the Kīlauea Military Camp.

In 1919, Jaggar convinced the National Weather Service to take over operations at the observatory. In 1924, the observatory was taken over by the United States Geological Survey and it has been run by the USGS ever since (except for a brief period during the Great Depression, when the observatory was run by the National Park Service).
When the Volcano House hotel burned to the ground in 1940, the old building was torn down (although the instruments in the vault continued to be used until 1961).

George Lycurgus convinced friends in Washington D.C. (many of whom had stayed in the Volcano House) to build a larger building farther back from the cliff, so he could build a new larger hotel at the former HVO site. By 1942, the &quot;Volcano Observatory and Naturalist Building&quot; was designated number 41 on the park inventory. However, with the advent of World War II, it was commandeered as a military headquarters. HVO was allowed to use building 41 from October 1942 to September 1948, when it became the park headquarters (and still is today, after several additions).

About two miles west, in an area known as &quot;Uwekahuna&quot;, a &quot;National Park Museum and Lecture Hall&quot; had been built in 1927. The name means roughly &quot;the priest wept&quot; in the Hawaiian Language, which indicates it might have been used to make offerings in the past. The HVO moved there in 1948 after some remodeling of the building. This site was even closer to the main vent of Kīlauea. In 1985 a larger building was built for the observatory adjacent to the old lecture hall, which was turned back into a museum and public viewing site. In the mid-1980s, HVO launched the Big Island Map Project (BIMP) to update the geologic map of the island of Hawai&#x27;i. Its major publication is the 1996 &quot;Geologic Map of the Island of Hawai&#x27;i&quot; (1996) by E.W. Wolfe and Jean Morris, digitized in 2005.

==Operations==

The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory hosts a large monitoring network, with over 100 remote stations transmitting data 24 hours a day. This information is provided immediately over the Internet, as is live coverage of ongoing eruptions from several webcams accessible from the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory website (see External links). Another important function of HVO is to monitor the sulphur emissions that produce the volcanic pollution condition known as vog. The observatory advises the park service when to close areas due to this and other volcanic hazards.

While the main Observatory building itself was not open to the public, the adjacent Thomas A. Jaggar Museum included interpretive exhibits on the work performed at the observatory. The exhibits ranged from general information on volcanoes and lava to the scientific equipment and clothing used by volcanologists. Some of the museum&#x27;s windows provided a sheltered view of Halemaʻumaʻu and the Kīlauea Caldera. A public observation deck at the museum, overlooking Kīlauea and formerly open 24 hours a day, provided views of the area.

On May 10, 2018, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was closed to the public in the Kīlauea volcano summit area, including the visitor center and park headquarters, due to explosions, earthquakes and toxic ash clouds from Halemaʻumaʻu. While much of the park was reopened on September 22, 2018, the former Observatory building and Jaggar Museum remain closed, due to considerable structural damage done to the facility.

With nearly 70 million in federal relief dollars appropriated in 2019, the Observatory is currently looking for a new location for their operations. In April 2019, Hawaii Public Radio reported that a move of the observatory staff to Oahu was being considered. In August 2019 it was reported that the Observatory was looking for a new permanent site in Hilo to replace the transitional offices in use since 2018.

<text>The Thames-Coromandel District is a territorial authority district in the North Island of New Zealand, covering all the Coromandel Peninsula and extending south to Hikutaia.

It is administered by the Thames-Coromandel District Council, which has its seat in the town of Thames. It was the first district council to be formed in New Zealand, being constituted in 1975. The district lies within the Waikato Regional Council area. Its only land boundary is with Hauraki District.

==Demographics==

Religious affiliations were 28.0% Christian, 0.7% Hindu, 0.1% Islam, 1.0% Māori religious beliefs, 0.9% Buddhist, 0.6% New Age, 0.1% Jewish, and 1.3% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 58.8%, and 8.6% of people did not answer the census question.

Of those at least 15 years old, 3,582 (13.0%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 15,453 (55.9%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 7,461 (27.0%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. The median income was $30,000, compared with $41,500 nationally. 1,848 people (6.7%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 9,969 (36.1%) people were employed full-time, 4,404 (15.9%) were part-time, and 645 (2.3%) were unemployed.

==Local government==
The Thames-Coromandel District Council was formed from the amalgamation of the Thames Borough, Thames County and Coromandel County councils in 1975, and is led by the Mayor of Thames-Coromandel.

<text>Eastry is a village and civil parish in the Dover district, in Kent, England, around southwest of Sandwich. It was voted &quot;Kent Village of the Year 2005&quot;. The parish includes the hamlets of Heronden and Selson. In 2011 the parish had a population of 2492.

The name is derived from the Old English &quot;Ēast-rige&quot;, meaning &quot;eastern province&quot; (c.f. &quot;Sūþ-rige&quot; &quot;southern province&quot;), also recorded as &quot;Ēastregē&quot;, from &quot;ēasterra gē&quot; (lit. &quot;more easterly area&quot;).

Poison Cross is a location with an unusual name at the north end of the village. A railway halt there had a short life.

==Historical legends==

Eastry lies on the Roman road north from Dover to Richborough Castle.

In the Early Middle Ages, Eastry was part of the Kingdom of Kent and was an important administrative centre. It was here that a royal palace of the Saxon kings of Kent stood. One of Kent&#x27;s oldest legends concerns King Ecgberht of Kent and the murder of his young cousins, Æthelred and Æthelberht, within the palace walls. According to the legend, the royal residence was passed to the priory of Christchurch in Canterbury as penance for the crime. The site of this ancient palace is believed to now be occupied by Eastry Court, adjacent to the church. An archaeological dig by Time Team in 2006 failed to find the royal palace.

==Parish church==

Eastry&#x27;s Grade I listed Anglican church is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin. Within the church is a brass standard bushel measure given in 1792.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches south to Sutton with a total population taken at the 2011 census of 5,199.

Until 1974 it was in Eastry Rural District.

==East Kent Light Railway==

The East Kent Light Railway was opened to freight traffic in 1911 and passenger traffic in 1916. Its purpose was to serve the new coal mines which were being opened up in the area. Among the stations opened were &#x27;Eastry&#x27; and &#x27;Eastry South&#x27;. It was one of Colonel Stephens&#x27; lines, but was nationalized in 1948 becoming part of British Railways, Southern Region. Both the colliery and the line failed and the section north of Eythorne completely closed by 1951.

The village is also on the Miner&#x27;s Way Trail. The trail links up the coalfield parishes of East Kent.

==Mills==

Eastry has had a number of windmills over the centuries. There were four mills marked on the 1819–1843 Ordnance Survey map, one of which, the Upper Mill, has been converted into a house. Currently there are three windmills in Eastry.

<text>Dream art is any form of art that is directly based on a material from one&#x27;s dreams, or a material that resembles dreams, but not directly based on them.

==History==
The first known reference to dream art was in the 12th century, when Charles Cooper Brown found a new way to look at art. However, dreams &quot;as&quot; art, without a &quot;real&quot; frame story, appear to be a later development—though there is no way to know whether many premodern works were dream-based.

In European literature, the Romantic movement emphasized the value of emotion and irrational inspiration. &quot;Visions&quot;, whether from dreams or intoxication, served as raw material and were taken to represent the artist&#x27;s highest creative potential.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Symbolism and Expressionism introduced dream imagery into visual art. Expressionism was also a literary movement, and included the later work of the playwright August Strindberg, who coined the term &quot;dream play&quot; for a style of narrative that did not distinguish between fantasy and reality.

At the same time, discussion of dreams reached a new level of public awareness in the Western world due to the work of Sigmund Freud, who introduced the notion of the subconscious mind as a field of scientific inquiry. Freud greatly influenced the 20th-century Surrealists, who combined the visionary impulses of Romantics and Expressionists with a focus on the unconscious as a creative tool, and an assumption that apparently irrational content could contain significant meaning, perhaps more so than rational content.

The invention of film and animation brought new possibilities for vivid depiction of nonrealistic events, but films consisting &quot;entirely&quot; of dream imagery have remained an avant-garde rarity. Comic books and comic strips have explored dreams somewhat more often, starting with Winsor McCay&#x27;s popular newspaper strips; the trend toward confessional works in alternative comics of the 1980s saw a proliferation of artists drawing their own dreams.

In the collection, The Committee of Sleep, Harvard psychologist Deirdre Barrett identifies modern dream-inspired art such as paintings including Jasper Johns&#x27;s &quot;Flag&quot;, much of the work of Jim Dine and Salvador Dalí, novels ranging from &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot; to works by Anne Rice and Stephen King and films including Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Three Women&quot;, John Sayles &quot;Brother from Another Planet&quot; and Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot;. That book also describes how the song &quot;Yesterday&quot; by Paul McCartney was heard by him in a dream and most of Billy Joel&#x27;s and Ladysmith Black Mambazo&#x27;s music has originated in dreams.

Dream material continues to be used by a wide range of contemporary artists for various purposes. This practice is considered by some to be of psychological value for the artist—independent of the artistic value of the results—as part of the discipline of &quot;dream work&quot;.

The international Association for the Study of Dreams holds an annual juried show of visual dream art.

The district is centred to the north and west of the city of Hamilton, and takes in much of the northern Waikato Plains and also the Hakarimata Range. The north of the district contains swampy floodplain of the Waikato River and several small lakes, of which the largest is Lake Waikare.

Other than Ngāruawāhia, the main population centres are Huntly, Raglan, and Te Kauwhata. The main industries in the district are dairy farming, forestry, and coal mining. There is a major coal-fired power station at Huntly. Te Kauwhata is at the centre of a major wine region.

==History==
Under the Local Government (Waikato Region) Reorganisation Order 1989, nearly all of Waikato County Council was added to the Boroughs of Huntly, Ngāruawāhia, most of Raglan County Council and a small part of Waipa County Council to form Waikato District Council.

The County Councils had lasted over a hundred years from their formation in 1876. They had been preceded by Highways Boards, formed from 1866. Before that, there had been many complaints about Auckland Province spending a disproportionate amount in Auckland. For example, in 1867 27 Raglan settlers petitioned the House of Representatives asking it to replace provinces with local government and saying that, out of a £500,000 loan to the province, only £500 was spent in all the country districts.

===Highways Boards===
Auckland Province passed a Highways Act in 1862 allowing their Superintendent to define given areas of settlement as Highways Districts, each with a board of trustees elected by the landowners. Land within the boundaries of highway districts became subject to a rate of not more than 1/- an acre, or of 3d in the £ of its estimated sale value, and that was to be equalled by a grant from the Province.

By a notice in the Provincial Government Gazette on 25 August 1866, the deputy Superintendent, Daniel Pollen, declared Whaingaroa Highway District, the first in the future Raglan County. A public meeting in the Raglan courthouse on 20 October 1866 was followed by a meeting a week later to elect 5 trustees. The largest landowner in the district, Captain Johnstone, was elected chairman, but he and 3 other trustees resigned after they couldn&#x27;t collect rates from absent owners and the Province didn&#x27;t pay anything.

Raglan Town Board was formed in 1868, Karioi Board in 1870 by division of Whaingaroa Highway District and by 1871 eleven board chairmen met in Ohaupo to ask for more government help. From 1872 government assistance more than matched rates collected; today government funding through NZTA mainly matches rates funding.
===Raglan County Council===
Under the Counties Act, 1876, in a NZ Gazette Supplement of Thursday, December 28, 1876, the Governor General set the first county council meetings at noon, Raglan County&#x27;s being in The Resident Magistrate&#x27;s Court, Raglan on Tuesday, 9 January 1877.

Raglan County was divided into five ridings (based on the distance a horse could travel in a day): Karioi, Pirongia, with 2 councillors each, and Te Akau, Onewhero and Whangape, with one. Only 3 of the Ridings were represented at the first meeting; W. H. Wallis (elected chairman) and John Pegler, Karioi Riding; James Sherrett, Pirongia; and Richard Robert Hunt, Onewhero. At the next meeting in Whatawhata there was only one other councillor present, from Pirongia. Many of the areas had not had Highway Boards and were sparsely populated (874 people in 175 houses across the whole county), so voters had problems getting together to nominate councillors. By 1887 there were 8 nominations for the 7 seats.

As the population grew, the original 5 ridings were split - Karamu from Pirongia (28 November 1889), Whaingaroa from Karioi 1902, Pukekawa from Onewhero and Port Waikato from Te Akau 1911, Pukemiro from Whangape 1913 and Waingaro from Te Akau 1920.

In 1923, Raglan County covered and had a population of 4,912, with of gravel roads, of mud roads and of tracks.

Some areas were transferred to neighbouring councils. The far south of Raglan went to Kawhia County when it was formed, but in 1952, the Local Government Commission put Makomako back in Raglan. On 1 October 1944, a coal-bearing area of Huntly West went to Huntly Borough. Other minor alterations were gazetted at intervals over the years. In 1954, a Raglan Town Committee was formed. Under the Local Government Act 1974, Raglan and Rotowaro became community towns, governed by elected councils.

The county relied on government grants until 1887, when government cuts forced it to set a rate. From 1889 to 1902 the Highways Boards were gradually merged into the County. Until 1943, each riding paid for its own roads and bridges, supplemented by council funds.

The northern portion of Raglan County was added to Franklin District in 1989 when the rest joined WDC.

==== Offices ====
Raglan had also had a Town Board from 1883 to 1889 and from 1906 to 1938. Raglan Town Board had its offices in the Municipal Buildings in Raglan from their rebuilding in 1928, after a 1927 fire, until the Board again merged with the County.

From 1876 to 1888, Raglan County Council meetings were held in Raglan. However, Raglan wasn&#x27;t central for the county, so meetings then alternated between Raglan and Whatawhata. On 15 May 1901, Raglan County held its first meeting in its new chambers at Ngāruawāhia, though continuing with at least an annual meeting in Raglan. In 1908, the council agreed to sell the old office for £227 10s. and build larger offices on the Raglan side of the Waipā Bridge. W. J. Smith of Raglan built them for £625. The new office opened in 1909. On 27 May 1961, a new £40,000, 16-room, brick building, on the Great South Road, was officially opened by the Minister of Works, Stanley Goosman. The old office was sold in 1961 and was being used as a loom factory, when it burnt down on 18 November 1971.

== Community Boards ==
Waikato District has 5 community boards covering Huntly, Ngāruawāhia and Raglan (formed 1989), Taupiri (added 1992) and Onewhero-Tuakau (added in 2010 covering part of the former Franklin District).

== Community Committees ==
The District also has 5 Community Committees for the townships of Meremere, Te Kauwhata (they had Community Boards from 1992 to 1995), and Tamahere ward, along with the North East Waikato Committee, covering Mangatawhiri, Mangatangi and Maramarua.

An extensive community master planning exercise was completed in 2019 resulting in the adoption by the Council of Community &quot;BluePrints&quot; to capture community aspirations and guide future development.

<text>Waipa District (or Waipā District) is a municipality in the Waikato region of New Zealand that is administered by the Waipa District Council. Its most populous town is Cambridge. The seat of the council is at the second most populous town, Te Awamutu. The district is south and south-east of the city of Hamilton. It has five wards: Te Awamutu, Cambridge, Pirongia, Maungatautari and Kakepuku.

==History==
The District was formed from Waipa County Council and its town boroughs in 1989.

The Waikato River forms much of the eastern boundary of the district, before it flows north-westward through the district, past Cambridge. The Waipā River, the Waikato River&#x27;s main tributary, flows northwards through the western part of the district; the two rivers meet outside the district. The highest mountains are Mount Pirongia in the west and Maungatautari in the east.

The region&#x27;s economy is based largely on dairy farming and cereal production. The southeastern corner of the district includes the hydroelectric project at Karapiro.

There were 28,620 males, 29,886 females and 177 people of other genders in 21,795 dwellings. 2.4% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 40.9 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 11,751 people (20.0%) aged under 15 years, 9,651 (16.4%) aged 15 to 29, 25,896 (44.1%) aged 30 to 64, and 11,388 (19.4%) aged 65 or older.

People could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results were 86.5% European (Pākehā); 15.9% Māori; 2.3% Pasifika; 6.1% Asian; 0.7% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 2.5% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;.

<text>Breakin&#x27; All the Rules is a 2004 American comedy film. It was directed and written by Daniel Taplitz. It stars Jamie Foxx, Morris Chestnut, Jennifer Esposito, Peter MacNicol and Gabrielle Union.

==Plot==
Quincy Watson (Jamie Foxx) is unceremoniously dumped by his fiancée Helen (Bianca Lawson) during their engagement party. Devastated, he attempts to express his feelings to her with a heartfelt letter. His boss, Phillip (Peter MacNicol), has also given him the job of researching how to diplomatically lay off people at their company. As Quincy writes, the letter becomes a &quot;how to&quot; book on the correct way to end a relationship. He has a book published and becomes a best-selling author on the subject. Not wanting his male friends to suffer the same fate, he gives them advice on dumping their mates including Phillip, who is trying to break up with his gold-digger girlfriend Rita (Jennifer Esposito). After his cousin Evan (Morris Chestnut) reads Quincy&#x27;s book he starts to question his relationship with his girlfriend Nicky (Gabrielle Union).

Mistakenly believing that Nicky wants to break up with him, Evan goes to his cousin Quincy and asks him to talk to her, hopefully convincing her that Evan&#x27;s a good guy. Since Quincy has never met her, he does not know what she looks like so Evan tells him that she has long, black hair. (As it turns out, that day, Nicky had cut her hair to a short length she described as being like Halle Berry). Quincy and Nicky end up sitting next to each other at the bar where Nicky was supposed to meet Evan. Quincy tells her that he is looking for his cousin&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Nicky who has long black hair.

Knowing that Quincy is Evan&#x27;s cousin, Nicky lies and tells Quincy her name is Mary. During the time Quincy and Nicky are at the bar, Rita finds out that Philip is planning to break up with her. She goes to Quincy&#x27;s house but when she gets there Evan lies and says that he&#x27;s Quincy. The two begin an affair. Later, Evan goes to Nicky&#x27;s house to break up with her, only to find that she was going to do the same, and has been seeing another man.

Changing his mind, Evan goes to Quincy&#x27;s job and tells him that he thinks he is in love with Nicky, and that she has been seeing another man. During that conversation, Quincy realizes that &#x27;Mary&#x27; is actually Nicky. At the party for Quincy&#x27;s hot seller book, Helen is just back from Paris and has decided she wants to get back with Quincy. Evan had planned on proposing to Nicky at the party but finds out that Quincy is dating his ex-girlfriend. He becomes upset with him and leaves the party to look for Nicky. The next day, Evan talks to Quincy and tells him he will marry Rita. Phillip had a heart attack, and at the hospital, Rita finds out that Evan lied to her. Instead of getting mad, she says she fell in love with him. Quincy breaks up with Helen and goes to look for Nicky. When he goes to her door, her neighbor tells him that she&#x27;s leaving for Portland by train. He goes to look for her. As the train is speeding away he confesses his love for her and they both ride the train to Portland.

It is a service town for the surrounding dairy-farming district. It is recognised as the &quot;gateway&quot; to the Waitomo Caves and as the &quot;Kiwiana Town&quot; of New Zealand. Until 2007, Ōtorohanga held a yearly &#x27;Kiwiana Festival.&#x27;

== History ==
===Early history===
Until the 1860s Ōtorohanga was a Ngāti Maniapoto village, with several whare (houses), peach trees and a flour mill. Huipūtea is a 300-year-old kahikatea tree, just to the south east of Ōtorohanga, which was the site of a skirmish in 1822 between Ngāti Maniapoto and Ngāpuhi. The village was abandoned after the invasion of the Waikato, except for Lewis Hettit&#x27;s (or Hetet) farm. The area remained insecure, with Hettit&#x27;s store being robbed by Te Kooti in 1869, but a meeting with Donald McLean later that year signalled moves towards peace.

John William Ellis became postmaster and opened a store in 1885 with Henry Valder and John Taonui Hetet. In 1886 Ngāti Maniopoto built a court room for the Native Land Court and from that year mail was delivered 3 times a month and disputes which had delayed development were settled. On 9 March 1887 the railway was extended from Te Awamutu and a 14-room hotel was built, primarily for those attending the Court. The sawmill, later run by Ellis and Burnand, started in 1890 and closed in 1912.

===Modern history===
In the early 1900s many businesses were established by Māori, in particular John Ormsby (Hōne Ōmipi). The Otorohanga Times was formed in 1912; it merged with the King Country Chronicle to form the Waitomo News in 1980. McDonald’s began a limestone quarry south of Otorohanga in 1968, which was bought by Graymont in 2015.

Otorohanga’s population grew from 367 in 1916 to 1,569 in 1951, after which growth slowed. Although population dropped from 2,652 in 1991 and to 2,514 in 2013, the fall was much less than in the rest of King Country.

===Harrodsville===
In 1986, the town briefly changed its name to &quot;Harrodsville&quot;. This was a protest in support of a restaurateur, Henry Harrod of Palmerston North, who was being forced to change the name of his restaurant following the threat of lawsuits from Mohamed Al-Fayed, the then owner of Harrod&#x27;s department store in London.

As a show of solidarity for Henry Harrod, and in anticipation of actions against other similar-sounding businesses, it was proposed that every business in Otorohanga change its name to &quot;Harrods&quot;. With the support of the District Council, Otorohanga temporarily changed the town&#x27;s name to Harrodsville.

After being lampooned in the British tabloids, Al Fayed dropped the legal action and Harrodsville and its shops reverted to their former names. The town&#x27;s response raised widespread media interest around the world, with the BBC World Service and newspapers in Greece, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Canada covering the story.

=== Floods ===
Ōtorohanga is built on the Waipā&#x27;s flood plain, but is largely protected by stop banks built between 1961 and 1966, following a major flood in 1958. However, in 2004 Ōtorohanga Primary was flooded by about of water and children were temporarily transferred to the then recently closed Tihiroa Primary School, about north of Ōtorohanga on SH31. In 1907 the whole town was flooded. Houses were also flooded in 1893 and 1926.

<doc id="885280" wikidata="Q7158105" url="?curid=885280" title="Pearl Hart">
<text>Pearl Hart (born Pearl Taylor; 1871 – December 30, 1955) was a Canadian-born outlaw of the American Old West. She committed one of the last recorded stagecoach robberies in the United States, and her crime gained notoriety primarily because of her gender. Many details of Hart&#x27;s life are uncertain, with available reports being varied and often contradictory.

==Early life==
Hart was born Pearl Taylor in the Canadian village of Lindsay, Ontario. Her parents were both religious and affluent, and these factors provided their daughter with the best available education. At the age of 16, she was enrolled in a boarding school where she became enamored with a young man, named Hart, who has been variously described as a rake, drunkard, and/or gambler.

Hart left her husband and reconciled several times. During their time together they had two children, a boy and a girl, whom Hart sent to her mother who was then living in Ohio. In 1893, the couple attended the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, where he worked for a time as a midway barker. Pearl in turn developed a fascination with the cowboy lifestyle while watching Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show. At the end of the Fair, Hart left her husband again on a train bound for Trinidad, Colorado, possibly in the company of a piano player named Dan Bandman.

During this time Hart worked as a cook and singer, possibly supplementing her income as a demimondaine (prostitute). There are also reports she developed a fondness for cigars, liquor, and morphine during this time.

A variation of this story has Bandman instead of her husband leaving Hart for war.

==Life of crime==
By early 1898, Hart was in the town of Mammoth, Arizona. Some reports indicate she was working as a cook in a boardinghouse. While doing well for a time, her financial outlook took a downturn after the mine closed. About this time Hart attested to receiving a message asking her to return home to her seriously ill mother.

Looking to raise money, Hart and an acquaintance known only as &quot;Joe Boot&quot; (likely an alias) worked an old mining claim he owned, but found no gold in the claim.

The pair decided to rob a stagecoach that traveled between Globe and Florence, Arizona.
The robbery occurred on May 30, 1899, at a watering point near Cane Springs Canyon, about 30 miles southwest of Globe. Hart had cut her hair short and dressed in men&#x27;s clothing. Hart was armed with a .38 revolver while Boot had a Colt .45. One of the last stagecoach routes still operating in the territory, the run had not been robbed in several years and thus the coach did not have a shotgun messenger. The pair stopped the coach and Boot held a gun on the robbery victims while Hart took $431.20 about $16,226.21 today, and two firearms from the passengers. After returning $1 to each passenger, she then took the driver&#x27;s revolver. After the robbers had galloped away on their horses, the driver unhitched one of the horses and headed back to town to alert the sheriff.

Others claim the pair became lost and wandered in circles. Regardless, a posse led by Sheriff Truman of Pinal County caught up with the pair on June 5, 1899. Finding both of them asleep, Sheriff Truman reported that Boot surrendered quietly while Hart fought to avoid capture.

== In and out of jail ==
Following their arrest, Boot was held in Florence while Hart was moved to Tucson, the jail lacking any facilities for a woman. The novelty of a female stagecoach robber quickly spawned a media frenzy and national reporters soon joined the local press clamoring to interview and photograph Hart. One article in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; said Hart was &quot;just the opposite of what would be expected of a woman stage robber,&quot; though, &quot;when angry or determined, hard lines show about her eyes and mouth&quot;. Locals also became fascinated with her, one local fan giving her a bobcat cub to keep as a pet.

Taking advantage of the relatively weak building material, and possibly with the aid of an assistant, Hart escaped on October 12, 1899, leaving an hole in the wall.

Hart and Boot came to trial for robbing the stagecoach passengers in October 1899. During the trial Hart made an impassioned plea to the jury, claiming she needed the money to be able to go to her ailing mother. Judge Fletcher M. Doan was shocked and angered when the jury found her not guilty and scolded the jurors for failure to perform their duties. Immediately following the acquittal, the pair was rearrested on the charge of tampering with U.S. mail.

Both Hart and Boot were sent to Yuma Territorial Prison to serve their sentences. Boot became a prison trusty, driving supply wagons to chain gangs working outside the walls. One day while driving a wagon he escaped and was never seen again. At the time of his escape, Boot had completed less than two years of his 30 year sentence.

The attention Hart had received in jail continued once she was imprisoned. The warden, who enjoyed the attention she attracted, provided her with an oversized mountainside cell that included a small yard and allowed her to entertain reporters and other guests as well as pose for photographs. Hart, in turn, used her position as the only female at an all-male facility to her advantage, playing admiring guards and prison trusties off of each other in an effort to improve her situation.

Hart&#x27;s release from prison came in the form of a December 1902 pardon from Arizona Territorial Governor Alexander Brodie. There are accounts that she and the warden were lovers. There is no evidence Hart ever had a third child, so this rumor, if true, may indicate a successful ploy on Hart&#x27;s part. Upon release from prison, Hart was provided with a train ticket to Kansas City.

==Later life==
After escaping prison, Hart largely appeared in public view. She had a short-lived show where she re-enacted her crime and then spoke about the horrors of Yuma Territorial Prison. Following this she worked, under an alias, as part of Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show. In 1904, Hart was running a cigar store in Kansas City when she was arrested for receiving stolen property.

A census taker in 1940 claimed to have discovered Hart living in Arizona under a different name, as she had married again.

== In popular culture ==
In addition to being a staple of pulp western fiction, Hart&#x27;s exploits have been featured in other venues. The play &quot;Lady with a Gun&quot; and the musical &quot;The Legend of Pearl Hart&quot; are also based upon Hart&#x27;s story.

Pearl Hart was the main character, played by Anne Francis, in a Death Valley Days episode “The Last Stagecoach Robbery” aired March 17, 1964. The episode centered on the holdup committed with Joe Boot and their subsequent capture portraying her as adventurous but kindhearted in her search for notoriety. https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0556826/

Pearl Hart is the main character in the play &quot;Waiting Women&quot; by Latina playwright Silvia Gonzalez S.

The Danish rock band Volbeat has a song called &quot;Pearl Hart&quot; on the album Outlaw Gentlemen &amp; Shady Ladies, released in 2013.

In CBBC&#x27;s Horrible Histories, Hart is played by Martha Howe-Douglas. Hart is portrayed as a &quot;real Wild West legend&quot; compared to the fictionalised antics of Billy the Kid and Wyatt Earp.

<doc id="885283" wikidata="Q1420878" url="?curid=885283" title="Vehicle registration plates of China">
<text>Vehicle registration plates in China are mandatory metal or plastic plates attached to motor vehicles in mainland China for official identification purposes. The plates are issued by the local traffic management offices, which are sub-branches of local public security bureaus, under the rules of the Ministry of Public Security.

Hong Kong and Macau, both of which are special administrative regions of China, issue their own licence plates, a legacy of when they were under British and Portuguese administration. Vehicles from Hong Kong and Macau are required to apply for licence plates, usually from Guangdong province, to travel on roads in mainland China. Vehicles from mainland China have to apply for Hong Kong licence plates or Macau licence plates to enter those territories.

The font used are in the Heiti (Traditional: 黑體, Simplified: 黑体) style.

==History==
===1986-series plate===

In July 1986, the 1986-series Plates were put into use. The layout and format for them are listed out as follows:

Hong Kong and Macau vehicles are issued with plates for Shenzhen () and Zhuhai (), respectively. Red-on-black plate-bearing vehicles are only allowed to drive within said cities. White-on-black vehicles are permitted to drive within Guangdong province, while if the vehicles are issued with green or violet plates according to their types, they have no area limitations.

Public security vehicles (e.g. police) are issued with single-line plates with the format GARR-####, where the RR is the regional code, and the following numbers are the serial number, with the &quot;GA&quot; (abbreviation for , &quot;gōng&#x27;ān&quot;, &quot;Public security&quot;) in red.

The regional codes are as follows:

Note: Chongqing was separated from Sichuan as a directly administered city in 1997, and the 1986-series standard was abolished in 1997 as well, therefore Public security vehicles in Chongqing bear the Sichuan code of GA51, instead of the later-introduced GA50.

1986-series plates are allowed to have the first number in the serial replaced by a letter with a special meaning, such as T for &quot;taxi&quot;, Z for (&quot;zìbèichē&quot;, &quot;self-reserved vehicle&quot;), G for (&quot;gètǐhù&quot;, &quot;entrepreneur&quot;).

==Current Series types==

===Common types===



The current plates are of GA36-2014 standard, a further update of the original GA36-1992, made from GB/T 3880.1 and GB/T 3880.2-compliant aluminum material with a thickness of no less than 1.2mm (for rear plates for large vehicles and trailers) or 1.0mm (for any other non-temporary plates), or 200-220g dedicated watermarked paper with plastic sealing for automobiles and motorcycles entering the border on a temporary basis, or 125g white paper-card for temporary license plates. The plates accommodate a one-character provincial abbreviation, a letter of the Pinyin alphabet, and five numbers or letters of the alphabet (Ex. ; ; ; ; ). Previously, all licence plates had used the five-number designation. As the number of motor vehicles grew, however, the number had to exceed what was the maximum previously allowable—90,000 or 100,000 vehicles. Therefore, there had become a need to insert Latin letters into the license plate to increase the number of possible combinations (for the full list of alphanumeric sequences permitted see below). This was first done in the bigger cities with only one prefix. Nanjing, for example, began the change with only the first number, which increased the number of possible combinations to 340,000 (with the exceptions of O &amp; I, which cannot be printed without confusion with the numbers 0 &amp; 1). Further changes allowed the first two places, or the second place alone on the plate to be letters, allowing 792,000 more combinations mathematically. More recently, cities have taken to having the third letter alone being a letter, the rest numbers.
Permitted alphanumeric combinations per GA36-2014 standard are listed in the table below. Should the number of combinations issued exceed 60% of the theoretical capacity of its type, the combination next in the list may be put into use after approval from the Vehicle Management Office of the provincial Public Security authority and reporting to the Vehicle Management Office of the Ministry of Public Security.

Note: Y and N in this table reflects whether or not this combination type may be used in registration plates with 4 or 5 places for digits/numbers, while D and L represents any permitted digit or letter respectively.

The numbers are produced at random, and are computer-generated at the issuing office. Numbers with a sequence of 6s, 8s, or 9s are usually considered to be lucky, therefore special sequences like &quot;88888&quot; or &quot;86888&quot; can be purchased through auction. A previous licence plate system, with a green background and the full name of the province in Chinese characters, actually had a sequential numbering order, and the numbering system was eventually beset with corruption.

License plates have different formats that are issued to different vehicles:
Since October 2007, black plates are no longer issued for vehicles belonging to foreigners, as this was &quot;deemed discriminatory&quot; and instead standard looking blue plates are now issued. However, foreigners still are issued a separate dedicated letter/number sequence to denote that they are a foreign owned/registered vehicle—e.g. in Beijing, the foreign owned plates are in the , , and sequence. The black plates are still issued to those who registered in both mainland China and Hong Kong or Macau, specifically in Guangdong province, which are in the sequence of 粤Z·####港/澳.

Registration combinations of written-off vehicles may be &quot;recycled&quot;, or used again on a different vehicle only after 6 months from the write-off according to relevant regulations, but as a matter of fact, certain serials of number like 京A·##### in Beijing is not available for general public once recycled for unspecified reasons. In 2015, a former Commissioner of Beijing Traffic Management Bureau, the traffic branch of Beijing Municipal Public Safety Bureau, was sentenced for life, having been found guilty of corruption relating to fraud in issuing these licence plate combinations.

===Police Service, Armed Police Force, and Military===

Licence plates for China&#x27;s Police Service, Armed Police Force, and Military are in a white background, with red and black text.

Police Service plates have a designated format of X·LLNNN (X is the geographical abbreviation, N is a digit, and L is either a digit or a letter; &quot; means police and is coloured red, but the separator dot is no longer a circle, rather, a dash). These plates are issued to traffic police, some patrol vehicles, court, and procuratorate vehicles.

The plates’ combination of the Chinese People&#x27;s Armed Police Force (&quot;) begins with the pinyin &quot;wujing&quot; abbreviation WJ.

The 2012 series of CAPF vehicle registration plates is in the WJ P NNNNL pattern, where the stands for a Chinese character i.e. 京 for Beijing, serving as the provincial identifier, and the L denotes the first letter in pinyin of the branch of service. e.g. WJ = a vehicle for firefighting use in Shanghai

The 2004 series use the format WJNN-NNNNN.

The first two small letters behind the WJ are area prefixes:
*WJ01-NNNNN. = Headquarters
*WJ31-NNNNN. = Beijing
*WJ14-NNNNN. = Shandong
*WJ21-NNNNN. = Hainan
The Alphabet Numeral behind the area prefix shows the section of the Armed police:
*WJ01-JNNNN. = Official Guards, Official and Diplomatic Escorts
*WJ01-BNNNN. = Border Police
*WJ01-XNNNN. = Firefighter (Fire Department)
*WJ01-1NNNN. = Headquarters
Military vehicles previously had plates using a code of heavenly stems in red. After reorganization in 2004, again in 2013 military vehicles now use a more organized prefix. These licence plates use the format XL·NNNNN (X is a prefix, L is a letter).

The People&#x27;s Liberation Army vehicle prefixes 2013:

Military vehicles can be identified by having a red letter from the alphabet *V
*V PLA Central Military Commission
*K PLA Air Force
*H PLA Navy
*B PLA Beijing Military
*VA PLA Central Military Commission
*VB PLA Political Works
*VC PLA Logistical Support 
*VD PLA Equipment Development
The People&#x27;s Liberation Army vehicle prefixes 2004:
*&quot;&quot; (Jūn; &quot;Military&quot;)

&quot;Vehicles of the Central Military Commission&quot;
&quot;Vehicles of the Headquarters of People&#x27;s Liberation Army&quot;
&quot;Vehicles of the PLA&#x27;s units at Army-Grade or above. .&quot;

The Ground Force of PLA vehicle of the various military regions have their own prefixes:
*&quot; (Beǐ) Vehicles of the Beijing Military Region of Ground Force)
*&quot; (Shěn); Vehicles of the Shenyang Military Region of Ground Force)
*&quot; (Lán); Vehicles of the Lanzhou Military Region of Ground Force)
*&quot; (Chéng); Vehicles of the Chengdu Military Region of Ground Force)
*&quot; (Jǐ); Vehicles of the Jinan Military Region of Ground Force)
*&quot; (Nán); Vehicles of the Nanjing Military Region of Ground Force)
*&quot; (Guǎng); Vehicles of the Guangzhou Military Region of Ground Force)
The Navy of PLA vehicle prefixes:
*&quot; (Haǐ)
The Air Force of PLA vehicle prefixes:
*&quot;&quot; (Kōng)

Vehicles with government or military plates are not subject to the &quot;Road Traffic Safety Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; (中华人民共和国道路交通安全法); they may run red lights, drive in the wrong direction or weave in and out of traffic. Communist party officials and People&#x27;s Liberation Army members are also exempt from paying road tolls and adhering to parking regulations. According to Xinhua News Agency, &quot;police officers are also reluctant to pull over drivers of military vehicles even if the drivers are breaking the law&quot;, which is the reason behind an emerging trend in which individuals purchase counterfeit military registration plates to avoid being pulled over by police and to avoid road fees. Xinhua News Agency reported in 2008 that since July 2006, the government has confiscated over 4,000 fake military vehicles and 6,300 fake plates and has apprehended over 5,000 people belonging to criminal gangs; under Chinese law, those caught driving under fake registration plates are fined up to 2,000 RMB, and counterfeiters can be jailed for up to three years.

===Motorcycles===

Motorcycle licence plates are nearly the same as that for ordinary vehicles, but are less in length and look more like an elongated square than a banner-like rectangle. There are two lines of text (province code and letter on the top, numbers on the bottom).

For &quot;qingqi&quot; or low-powered motorbikes, blue licence plates are issued throughout.

===Embassies and consulates===

Since 2017, embassy and consulate vehicles have their own license plate with six white numbers followed by a single character denoting its diplomatic status, all on a black background (following the foreigner plate standard, as previously mentioned). Embassies use (&quot;shǐ&quot;, from meaning &#x27;embassy&#x27;) and are used only in Beijing. Consulates use (&quot;lǐng&quot;, from meaning &#x27;consulate&#x27;) and are used for representations outside Beijing. Numbers on embassy plates are formatted so that the first three digits represent the foreign entity/organization the vehicle is registered to while the last three digits are sequential, where 001 is (generally) the Ambassador&#x27;s car, for example: 224·001使 is the car used by the American Ambassador. Numbers 002 to 005 are usually reserved for official use and therefore enjoy the comfort of the highest levels of diplomatic immunity.

In order to protect the privacy of foreign diplomats, the government does not release information on embassy vehicles, so it is possible that some data in the list of plate prefixes below may not be correct.

===Other types===

Vehicles for use in automobile tests, vehicles for use in driving schools (examination and test-driving), and vehicles at airports all have their own separate licence plates.

For automobile tests, licence plates consist of black characters on a yellow background with the suffix &quot;shi&quot; (试 short in Chinese for &quot;ce shi&quot; or test). For driving schools, different plates apply for test-drive vehicles (&quot;jiaolian che&quot;) and examination vehicles (&quot;kaoshi che&quot;).

Airports have licence plates with white characters on a green background with the designation &quot;min hang&quot; (). This shade of green is slightly lighter than the variant used on normal licence plates prior to 1992. Some vehicles belonging to airports that operate &quot;in its vicinity&quot; (rather than inside its perimeters) have dark-green lettering on a white background. These plates, unlike others, permit the use of letter I (as in the &quot;SPIA-A00&quot; series used in Shanghai Pudong International Airport)

Sometimes, to avoid privacy invasion, modern Chinese TV show series are set in fictitious locations. Vehicles featured in these shows often carry registration plates with non-valid provincial abbreviations and/or invalid typefaces.

===Cross-border with Hong Kong and Macau===

Licence plates with a black background and the character or in place of the last number are used for Hong Kong and Macau vehicles, respectively, when they engage in cross-border traffic to and from mainland China. These plates often exist side by side with a local Hong Kong or Macau licence plates on the same car. See the section on Guangdong license plates.

===Interim licence plates===

Interim licence plates are a piece of paper to be affixed to the front of the vehicle&#x27;s window, usually valid for 15 days.

===Shortlived 2002 standard===
For a short while in the summer of 2002, a new 2002 standard was instituted in several cities, including Beijing. They enabled number/alphabetical customisation. (The possible combinations were NNN-NNN, NNN-LLL and LLL-NNN, where N would be a number and L a letter. However, although the usage of &quot;CHN&quot;, to designate China, was not permitted in the plates, that restriction, oddly enough, did not apply to the letters &quot;PRC&quot;.) The VIN was also added to the new plates, and the plates were white, with a gradual blue tint at the bottom end of the plates. Black letters were used on the plate.

In late August 2002 new 2002 standard plates had their issuance temporarily interrupted, officially for technical reasons, but actually because some number/alphabetical combinations of a controversial nature in mainland China were utilised. One of the biggest controversies was when a vehicle with plate number USA-911 was spotted in Beijing, causing an uproar as it was taken to be a reference to the September 11 attacks, and as such was criticized as being disrespectful to Americans. Equal uproars were created with such plates as PRC-001, and trademark violations were rife; the plate number IBM-001 and was seen. The WTO acronym was also spotted in the plates. In a society that is still rather conservative in this topic, the plate SEX-001 was the source of yet another controversy. The number 250, an insult in spoken Chinese, was also spotted in some plates.

Possibly due to the controversies as described above, as of summer 2003, the new plates are no longer being issued. Old plates of the 2002 standard are not being recalled. Cars who have lost their 2002-standard plates are disallowed to get a 2002-standard replacement. The 1992-standard plates will be issued instead.

=== New 2007 Standard (GA36－2007) ===
The Ministry of Public Security has announced on October 30, 2007, that the 1992 vehicle license plate system will be overhauled on November 1, 2007.

* The current black license plates assigned to foreign-owned vehicles will be phased out. New vehicles will be issued &quot;normal&quot; blue license plates.
* Two roman letters (not including O, or I, which could be confused with numerals) may be included among the last five places of the plate number.
A minor difference between the 2007- and the 1992-standard plates is that the separator dot between the regional code and the serial on 2007-standard plates is embossed along the characters, while that on 1992-standard plates are pressed &quot;into&quot; the plate, in the opposite direction of the characters.

Number plates issued in the 1992 standard will not be recalled but black plates will no longer be issued. Neither will plates issued to embassies be affected.

It is believed this is a China-wide standard. Many provinces and municipal cities have since introduced personalized number plates with different limitations. It is generally possible to choose from several alphabetical-numerical combination and personalize some of the digits.

For some provinces it is possible to have a letter occupying the last place of the combination, possibly to increase combination numbers. 
===New Energy vehicles license plates===
On November 21, 2016, the MPS announced the New Energy vehicles license plates which have been instituted in Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuxi, Jinan, and Shenzhen since December 1, 2016. These plates consist of a one-character provincial abbreviation, a letter indicating the city, and a six-character alphanumerical string, in which &quot;D&quot; (&quot;E&quot;) means Electric car, &quot;F&quot; means other types of vehicles powered by New Energy. For small vehicles or Large New Energy vehicles, this letter is located in the first place or the last place, respectively.

New Energy Vehicle License Plates are instituted in more than 10 cities as of 2017.

Dimensions for the Chinese character remains at 45 × 90 mm as the 1992 standard, whereas numbers are reduced to thinner 43 × 90mm dimensions alongside a change in font, which is now found on 2019-standard registration plates for firetrucks as well.

<text>Jennifer Esposito (born April 11, 1973) is an American actress. She is known for her roles in the feature films &quot;Summer of Sam&quot; (1999), &quot;Don&#x27;t Say a Word&quot; (2001), &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; (2002), &quot;Welcome to Collinwood&quot; (2002), &quot;Crash&quot; (2004), &quot;Taxi&quot; (2004), and &quot;Mob Town&quot; (2019). She has also appeared in several television series, most notably &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;, &quot;Spin City&quot;, &quot;Related&quot;, &quot;Samantha Who?&quot;, &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;, and &quot;Mistresses&quot;. From 2016 to 2017, she played Special Agent Alexandra Quinn on the CBS series &quot;NCIS&quot;, while from 2019 to 2020, she played CIA Deputy Director Susan Raynor in the Amazon series &quot;The Boys&quot;.

==Early life==
Esposito was born in the Brooklyn borough of New York City and is of Italian descent. She was raised on Staten Island in Bulls Head and is a graduate of Moore Catholic High School.

==Career==

Esposito made her first television appearance in &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; in 1996. She then joined the cast of &quot;Spin City&quot;, where she appeared for two seasons. She also appeared in &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;. One of her more notable roles was as &quot;Ruby&quot; in Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Summer of Sam&quot; in 1999, which was set against the late 1970s backdrop of the Son of Sam murders. Esposito&#x27;s next films included &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;, &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot;, the 2004 comedy &quot;Taxi&quot;, and the Academy Award-winning film &quot;Crash&quot;, in which she played Don Cheadle&#x27;s partner and romantic interest, Ria.

Esposito has made television appearances on the series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, and &quot;Mercy&quot;. She was a regular cast member on &quot;Related&quot; and &quot;Samantha Who?&quot; Esposito joined the cast of the CBS drama &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; in 2010, playing the role of Detective Jackie Curatola, the partner of Detective Danny Reagan (played by Donnie Wahlberg). In the third season Esposito was diagnosed with celiac disease and, after collapsing on set, Esposito informed CBS that her condition would limit her availability to work on the series. Rather than work around her limited schedule, &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; producers chose to write her character out of the series in 2012.

In 2013, she launched Jennifer&#x27;s Way Bakery in Manhattan&#x27;s West Village, which only serves celiac-safe food. In 2014 she joined the NBC series &quot;Taxi Brooklyn&quot;. On April 22, 2014, Da Capo Lifelong Books published Esposito&#x27;s first book &quot;Jennifer&#x27;s Way&quot;, a detailed look into her personal struggle with celiac disease before and after she was diagnosed and the things she did to survive. The book made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller List on July 6, 2014. In 2015, Esposito played Calista Raines in the ABC drama series &quot;Mistresses&quot;, and it was reported that she would be a cast member on the CBS pilot &quot;Taxi-22&quot;, whose main character would be played by John Leguizamo. She played Dominic West&#x27;s sister in the Showtime series &quot;The Affair&quot; for six episodes.

Esposito became the brand ambassador for Eclair Naturals also in 2015, a gluten- and GMO-free vegan body and skin care line available in Rite Aid stores across the United States. In 2016, it was announced that Esposito would join the cast of &quot;NCIS&quot; as Special Agent Alexandra &quot;Alex&quot; Quinn, executive producer Gary Glasberg noting, &quot;We couldn&#x27;t be happier to have Jennifer Esposito joining us for season 14. She embodies everything that we hoped for in the character of Quinn and we can&#x27;t wait to have her come be a part of our team.&quot; In June 2017, it was announced that this would be her only season. Esposito appeared on the September 10, 2016, episode of &quot;&quot;, where she said her doctor had her hospitalized in a psychiatric ward. She said the hospitalization happened during the time she was an actress on the show &quot;Samantha Who? &quot;

In 2019, she joined the cast of &quot;The Boys&quot;, an Amazon Prime Exclusive. In August, she was set to play a recurring role in the &quot;Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens&quot; series on Comedy Central.

In February 2020, it was announced that Esposito had joined the cast of the Netflix series &quot;Inventing Anna&quot; created by Shonda Rhimes in the role of Talia Mallay. However, this role was ultimately played by Marika Domińczyk.

In 2023, Esposito wrote, directed, and starred in the film &quot;Fresh Kills&quot; playing the mother of two daughters in a coming-of-age story centered in the world of an organized crime family.

==Personal life==
Esposito married actor Bradley Cooper on December 30, 2006. In May 2007, they filed for divorce, which was finalized that November.

<text>Ōpōtiki (; from &quot;Ōpōtiki-Mai-Tawhiti&quot;) is a town in the eastern Bay of Plenty in the North Island of New Zealand. It houses the headquarters of the Ōpōtiki District Council, the mayor of Ōpōtiki and comes under the Bay of Plenty Regional Council.

==History==
In 1840, the New Zealand Church Missionary Society (CMS) established a station in Ōpōtiki. Ōpōtiki was the traditional centre of the Māori iwi (tribe) Te Whakatōhea. On 2 March 1865, CMS missionary Carl Völkner was killed by local Māori for acting as a spy for the New Zealand Government. In response to Völkner&#x27;s death, the New Zealand Government dispatched military expeditions to Ōpotiki to hunt down his killers. Several local people were arrested, with some being executed. The Government also confiscated a large area of land stretching from Matatā to the east of Ōpōtiki from local Bay of Plenty tribes including Te Whakatōhea.

Military settlers settled in Ōpōtiki, which became the main government centre in eastern Bay of Plenty. By 1882, Ōpotiki had become a town district and subsequently became a borough in 1908. Between 1901 and 1936, the population rose from 627 to 1,437. 

Ōpōtiki&#x27;s economy was based on agriculture, becoming a bustling dairy town until the 1980s. During the 1980s, the town was adversely affected by economic reformswhich led to the closure of two clothing factories in nearby Waimana and layoffs in the public works. Between 1996 and 2001, the population declined by 3.7%. During the early 21st century, the town&#x27;s economy was boosted by the development of horticulture plantations and an offshore mussel&#x27;s farm. 

By the 2020s, Ōpōtiki had developed a reputation nationally for its significant gang presence and their associated criminal activities. According to 1News, the three dominant gangs in Ōpōtiki are the Black Power chapter Mangu Kaha, the Ōpōtiki Mongrel Mob and the Mongrel Mob Barbarians. On 14 June 2023, a (funeral) procession led to the temporary closure of several local schools and public transportation. This became a political issue with the Prime Minister, Chris Hipkins, commenting on it.

== Geography ==
The town of Ōpōtiki is situated exactly on latitude 38° South. The climate is temperate. Summer temperatures reach the mid-20s (Celsius, mid-70s Fahrenheit) on the coast and encourage a continuation of the beach culture of the Bay of Plenty. Winter days are often cloudless, the daytime temperature never drops below freezing but there may be a mild frost at night. Winter snow falls along the crest of the ranges, and on the higher peaks (over 1000 m) may remain for a few weeks. Rain occurs at any season. Severe localised rainstorms (&#x27;cloudbursts&#x27;) may occur in the high country and have caused flash flooding including past inundations of Ōpōtiki township.

==Demographics==
Ōpōtiki covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Before the 2023 census, the town had a larger boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Ōpōtiki had a population of 4,806 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 735 people (18.1%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 363 people (8.2%) since the 2006 census. There were 1,539 households, comprising 2,337 males and 2,472 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.95 males per female, with 1,221 people (25.4%) aged under 15 years, 921 (19.2%) aged 15 to 29, 1,920 (40.0%) aged 30 to 64, and 744 (15.5%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 46.7% European/Pākehā, 67.9% Māori, 4.2% Pacific peoples, 3.7% Asian, and 1.1% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 8.2, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 41.9% had no religion, 30.7% were Christian, 18.0% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.6% were Hindu, 0.3% were Muslim, 0.1% were Buddhist and 2.1% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 303 (8.5%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 1,029 (28.7%) people had no formal qualifications. 174 people (4.9%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally.

<doc id="885301" wikidata="Q3286027" url="?curid=885301" title="Manly Warringah Sea Eagles">
<text>The Manly Warringah Sea Eagles are an Australian professional rugby league club based in Sydney&#x27;s Northern Beaches. They compete in the National Rugby League (NRL). The Manly club debuted in the 1947 New South Wales Rugby Football League season and currently hosts the majority of their home games at fortress Brookvale Oval in Brookvale. They train at the New South Wales Academy of Sport in Narrabeen and their Centre of Excellence in Brookvale. The team colours are maroon and white, and they are commonly known as &quot;Manly&quot;.

The club competed in the NSWRL, ARL, or NRL competitions in all respective seasons from 1947 until 1999. At the end of 1999, they entered into a joint venture with the North Sydney Bears to form the Northern Eagles, which rugby league statisticians regard as a separate club. The Northern Eagles competed in the 2000 and 2001 NRL seasons, after which the joint venture collapsed. The Manly Warringah club (who held the NRL licence) competed in the NRL as the Northern Eagles for a further season in 2002, before abandoning the name and identity to return to what they are known as today.

Since winning their first premiership in 1972, the club has won a further seven first-grade titles, with their most recent being in 2011. The club&#x27;s eight titles span five consecutive decades. Since their first Grand Final appearance in 1951, the club has appeared in 19 Grand Finals across seven consecutive decades.

==History==
By the mid-1940s, the movement to expand rugby league in Sydney had gained serious momentum and Manly, as with all the other Sydney district rugby clubs, endured internal agonies as the new &quot;League&quot; was considered. In 1946, Manly Warringah defeated North Sydney 12-8 in the Presidents Cup Grand Final which helped the club gain momentum in pushing for inclusion into the NSWRL competition.

The NSWRL finally accepted Manly&#x27;s application on the 4 November 1946 after two unsuccessful bids in 1937 and 1944. Along with Parramatta, they were granted admission to the 1947 competition. It was North Sydney themselves who had the most to lose from Manly entering the league but they advocated for a team to be on the Northern Beaches. Norths believed Manly&#x27;s inclusion in the competition would provide a far better platform for Rugby League to gain a hold over Rugby Union in the peninsula area.

North Sydney endured an exodus of players to the newly formed team with 20 Manly juniors returning to play for their local club in their first season. Norths lost half of their games in 1947, before spending the next four seasons towards the bottom of the ladder.

Manly immediately adopted the maroon and white colours they had used for their Presidents Cup team since its inception and borrowed originally from the Freshwater SLSC of which Ken Arthurson and other players were members. For their emblem they chose the sea eagle – the native bird of prey of the Sydney coastline. Although a number of media writers referred to Manly as the &quot;sea gulls&quot;, the club maintains that it has always officially been the Sea Eagles.

Manly&#x27;s first premiership game was against Western Suburbs at Brookvale Oval on Saturday 12 April 1947. Max Whitehead, who had first played for Norths in 1942 and was a member of their 1943 Grand Final team, was Manly&#x27;s first captain. Whitehead was a big barrel-chested second rower who was used by Bonds as the model for their iconic &quot;Chesty Bond&quot; character. Their first win was against the Parramatta Eels and the club finished their first season in second last place.

Manly&#x27;s first Grand Final appearance was in the 1951 season, which they lost to South Sydney. Manly Warringah played in five Grand Finals before winning their first premiership in 1972. They then won the following year in 1973 and again in 1976 and 1978. The 1973 final against Cronulla is reputed to be one of the hardest and toughest grand finals, at least in the televised era. There were several incidents of players being hurt, in particular very tough and hard English import, Mal Reilly, was &quot;taken&quot; out early and did not take any further part in the game.
Manly were powerful in the early 1980s but were beaten in two consecutive Grand finals by Parramatta, in 1982 and 1983. Their next premiership was won against the Canberra Raiders in the 1987 Grand final, the last Grand Final played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Coached by Bob Fulton, the Sea Eagles returned to the play-offs in 1993 and 1994 but were beaten on each occasions in the first elimination semi-final by the Brisbane Broncos.

In 1988, Manly, missing six regular first grade players, including captain Paul Vautin, Michael O&#x27;Connor and Phil Daley who were all playing in the first Ashes series test just four days later, plus other stars such as Dale Shearer, Mal Cochrane and David Ronson (all six had played in the 1987 Grand Final win), put the touring Great Britain Lions to the sword with a 30-0 demolition at Brookvale Oval. Teenage halfback Geoff Toovey was named man of the match, scoring one of the Sea Eagles five tries on the night while the side was led by Noel Cleal who had a point to prove after being a shock omission from the Australian team. Great Britain&#x27;s coach for their 1988 tour was Mal Reilly who had played lock forward for the Manly in their 1972 and 1973 Grand Final wins. It would be the first time that former premiership teammates Fulton and Reilly would oppose each other from the coaches box. With Fulton taking over as coach of the Australian team from 1989, it would not be their last time coaching against each other.

In 1995, amidst the Super League war, Manly produced one of its most dominating seasons in the club&#x27;s history but in one of the league&#x27;s biggest upsets, were beaten by Canterbury in the Grand Final. Despite being the best attacking side all year, the Sea Eagles could not score a try in the Grand Final and were defeated by the underdog Canterbury side, led by Terry Lamb.

In 1996 Manly made another Grand Final appearance and beat St. George to win the title that had eluded them the season before. Rugby League in Australia was split in two leagues in 1997, the ARL and Super League, and Manly were one of the leading teams in the ARL competition. For the third consecutive year Manly reached the Grand Final, however lapses in their intensity which appeared during the season returned in the premiership decider against the Mal Reilly coached Newcastle Knights and the Sea Eagles were beaten on the full-time siren by a Knights try.

The Manly teams of 1995 to 1997 produced some of the most entertaining football in Sea Eagles&#x27; history, but also featured rugby league&#x27;s strongest defence. Many great players featured, including Des Hasler, Geoff Toovey, Nik Kosef, Steve Menzies, Terry Hill, Mark Carroll, Cliff Lyons, David Gillespie, Craig Hancock, Danny Moore, John Hopoate, and former NZ All Blacks Matthew Ridge and Craig Innes.

After 1997 the club lost form on the field, recording only 10th place in the 1998 season, and missing the finals in 1999.

==Northern Eagles==

Manly Warringah would usher in the new millennium by merging with the North Sydney Bears to become the Northern Eagles, with Geoffrey Bellew being the Chairman at this time. This venture would run between 2000 and 2002. The club was formed during the rationalisation process of the NRL. The team would share home games between Brookvale Oval and Central Coast Stadium, Gosford, New South Wales.

Little success was had during these three seasons, finishing 12th, 10th, and 9th, winning 30 of 76 games. Also, the new club&#x27;s decision to play games in Gosford instead of the Bears home ground at North Sydney Oval alienated several North Sydney fans, despite North Sydney&#x27;s planned move to the new Central Coast Stadium. In spite of this, the club provided more players for the 2001 State of Origin series&#x27; New South Wales team than any other club. The partnership dissolved in 2002, with Manly emerging as the stand-alone entity. The 2002 season was played under the Northern Eagles name, although effectively the club was the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles by another name. Halfway through the season, the Eagles even abandoned playing games at Gosford, due to a sharp decline in attendances. The people of Gosford preferred to wait until a home grown team was based there. 

The joint venture would collapse by the end of the 2001 season and Manly would officially make a welcome return to the NRL in 2003.

==Resurrection==

The joint venture collapsed and Manly retained the Northern Eagles licence for the 2002 season until returning to the competition as Manly Warringah Sea Eagles for the 2003 season. The 2003 and 2004 seasons produced very few moments of joy for Sea Eagles supporters. The club improved its playing stocks for 2005, and reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1998. Manly would not miss the finals until 2015, whilst every other club have missed the finals at least once since 2004. A meeting of the Football Club on 3 June 2004 saw the club members vote for the privatisation of the Football Club.

During this period, Manly introduced a number of players who became stars of the game over the next decade including local juniors Jason King and Anthony Watmough, as well as the Stewart brothers from Wollongong, back row forward Glenn and speedy try scoring fullback Brett.
=== 2007 season ===

Manly finished the 2007 regular season in 2nd (out of 16) place, losing only six matches throughout. Their 50-16 mauling of Newcastle ensured they would finish in the top two. Throughout the season they were the only club chasing Melbourne (whom they beat in round 11) for the minor premiership. After defeating North Queensland at the Sydney Football Stadium 28–6, Manly played in their 15th grand final against Melbourne, where they were beaten 34–8 by Melbourne on 30 September at Telstra Stadium.

Melbourne would later be stripped of the 2007 title for salary cap breaches.

=== 2008 season ===

With the departure of hooker Michael Monaghan, many questioned whether the Manly could be as competitive as in 2007 and losses in the first 2 rounds seemed to confirm this. Manly finished the regular season tied first with Melbourne and Cronulla but 2nd on points differential and Manly missed out on claiming their first minor premiership since 1997.

In the qualifying final Manly faced 7th placed St. George at Brookvale. This game was club legend Steve Menzies&#x27; last game at Brookvale and he opened the scoring with an unusual charge down try in which after kicking ahead to himself and falling over, the ball bounced up and hit him in the head before he finally grounded it. After getting the week off, Manly faced the history-making New Zealand Warriors. Manly crushed the Warriors 32–6 and showcased their trademark wall of defence and attacking flair. With the win, Manly qualified for their 17th grand final, where in a rematch of the 2007 decider, they would play the Melbourne Storm.

The story of the grand final was very different for Manly-Warringah this time around, as they decimated Melbourne 40–0 (which was the largest number of points scored against a team in a grand final) to win their seventh premiership in front of 80,388 at ANZ Stadium. It was Michael Monaghan&#x27;s replacement, the previously unknown Matt Ballin, who scored the first try of the match. The game was also notable for winger Michael Robertson&#x27;s hat-trick (the first time a Manly player had scored 3 tries in a finals game since Gordon Willoughby scored 3 against Western Suburbs in the 1951 Semi-final at the SCG) and retiring legend Steve Menzies&#x27; try 10 minutes from full-time, which he scored after coming back onto the field to replace the injured Steve Matai. Manly prop forward Brent Kite was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal after a powerhouse display which included a classy try in the 58th minute. This is the largest winning margin in a grand final in rugby league history.

=== 2009 season ===
Three weeks prior to the 2009 season, Des Hasler and his team travelled to England where as the reigning NRL premiers they would take on reigning Super League premiers the Leeds Rhinos in the 2009 World Club Challenge to be played at the Elland Road ground in Leeds. After having lost their previous World Club Challenge game to Wigan in 1987 (with Hasler the halfback in that Manly side), the Sea Eagles took this game much more seriously and included a warm-up game against the Harlequins in London a week before the game (won 34-26 by the Sea Eagles). The warm-up game (Manly were the first Australian side to actually play such a game before a WCC) proved effective as Manly went on to win the WCC 28–20 over the Rhinos.

The 2009 season boded poorly as a result of two incidents on the day of Manly-Warringah&#x27;s season launch. Second-rower Anthony Watmough was assaulted by a sponsor after allegedly making inappropriate comments to his daughter. Brett Stewart later that night was charged with the sexual assault of a 17-year-old girl outside his apartment block, of which he was subsequently cleared, an incident which led to the damning Four Corners investigation, &quot;Code of Silence&quot;. Stewart was cleared of the charge in late September 2010 by a jury which took 45 minutes to reach their decision.

Manly-Warringah paid a $100,000 fine for failing to adequately punish Stewart for his offence. Stewart faced a brief trial at the time, and a further, more comprehensive trial began in March 2010. As a result of Stewart&#x27;s absence, Manly lost their first four games of the season, crashing to last place after round four (thus becoming the first defending premier since Melbourne in 2000 to lose their first four matches of a season), before finally achieving a 23–10 win against the Tigers in which Stewart scored three tries in his first match for 2009.

A double against Souths followed, before injury struck. Stewart only played five games overall in 2009 following a serious knee injury suffered in round six, before returning in round 25. The Sea Eagles snared fifth place at the end of the season and lost the first qualifying final to eventual grand final winners Melbourne 40–12 in a one-sided contest played at Melbourne&#x27;s Etihad Stadium. Due to other unfavourable results occurring on the weekend, Manly were eliminated from the premiership race. This premiership was also stripped from the Storm.

=== 2010 season ===

In 2010, Manly-Warringah started the season with a team of many new faces, including young playmaker Kieran Foran. After narrowly losing their first two games of the season, Manly won their third, following three matches against Newcastle, the Warriors and the Sharks before a late season slump saw them settle for eighth position on the ladder.

Manly-Warringah players were not involved in any further violations in 2010, and embarked on an active program of community engagement, which included activities such as reading at schools and raising money for charities.

Manly&#x27;s season got off to the worst possible start. While warming up for the opening round game against the Wests Tigers at the Sydney Football Stadium, international winger David Williams injured his shoulder forcing him to withdraw from the game. Unfortunately the injury would require surgery which saw Williams ruled out for the remainder of the season. The situation then got worse when fullback Brett Stewart suffered a knee injury when he ruptured his Anterior cruciate ligament during the first half of the game. Stewart&#x27;s injury would also rule him out for the remainder of the season. This would cause Des Hasler to re-shuffle his backline over the course of the season after losing two of his teams most lethal attacking weapons.

Manly-Warringah spent much of the middle of the season near the top of the ladder and were earmarked as a possible premiership contender with impressive wins over the St. George Illawarra Dragons and the Wests Tigers. Inconsistent form, injuries and suspensions caused a dramatic slide down the ladder and Manly were lucky to settle on 8th and just make the finals. Had it not been for the Melbourne Storm salary cap breach earlier in the season, Manly-Warringah would have missed the finals altogether for the first time since 2004. In round 25, ballplaying second-rower Glenn Stewart was suspended for 4 matches for a high shot on Sydney Roosters captain Braith Anasta, and in round 26 centre Steve Matai was suspended for 7 matches for a high tackle that knocked out Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs hooker Michael Ennis. Their 2010 season ended with a dismal 28–0 hammering from the eventual premiers St. George Illawarra, although Manly-Warringah were still in the game with 15 minutes remaining. Manly went into this game with 11 of their first choice players out with either injury or suspension and many of those who did play were still carrying injuries.

=== 2011 season ===

At the end of the 2010 season Manly Warringah lost Trent Hodkinson who signed a deal with the Bulldogs from the start of the 2011 season, as well as Josh Perry and Ben Farrar to the Super League. Daly Cherry-Evans, who came from Manly&#x27;s Queensland Cup feeder club the Sunshine Coast Sea Eagles, was brought into first grade. Manly-Warringah had not made any big-name signings for the 2011 season. This showed up in its lowly 8th placing, its poorest performance in a season since 2005.

Manly-Warringah&#x27;s 2011 season started with an 18–6 loss to the Melbourne Storm in Melbourne. Brett Stewart had minimal impact on the match but escaped injury-free. This was followed with an upset 27–16 win over beaten 2010 Grand Finalists the Sydney Roosters, where Manly-Warringah went into the match without its captain Jamie Lyon, Shane Rodney, Dean Whare and Glenn Stewart through injury and also Jason King and Steve Matai through suspension. Brett Stewart was appointed acting captain for the Roosters match. This is regarded as one of the most commendable wins in Manly&#x27;s history and featured outstanding performances by its younger players including Kieran Foran, Jamie Buhrer, William Hopoate and Vic Mauro. This was followed up with a 26–12 win over the Newcastle Knights at Brookvale, before a 32–20 loss to the South Sydney Rabbitohs which ended Manly&#x27;s unbeaten run at Bluetongue Stadium, having won all of its previous matches at the venue.

Anthony Watmough and Terence Seu Seu were both stood down by the club for off-field offences prior to its round five match against Cronulla at Toyota Stadium. The Sea Eagles were in trouble midway through the second half, down 13–0, before scoring 19 unanswered points, including a try after the siren by Michael Oldfield, to give the Silvertails a 19–13 victory.

Despite losing many players from the 2010 season, the Sea Eagles found themselves sitting in second place on the NRL Ladder at the end of the regular season, behind the Melbourne Storm. They lost only five matches in the season, all being night matches. Manly-Warringah won all of its matches at Brookvale Oval, again nicknamed &quot;Brookie Fortress&quot;. The final game at Brookvale was a Top of the Table Clash against the Melbourne Storm. Manly won this game 18–4 but the win was overshadowed by a brawl between Glenn Stewart and Adam Blair, giving the game the nickname &#x27;The Battle of Brookvale&#x27;.

In their opening playoff game, Manly-Warringah registered a 42–8 win over the North Queensland Cowboys at the Sydney Football Stadium. After a disappointing first half, Manly scored 42 unanswered points in the 2nd half, and progressed to the preliminary final. In this match, they defeated the Brisbane Broncos 26–14 to be the first team through to the 2011 NRL Grand Final, where they met the New Zealand Warriors who were vying for their first ever premiership.

A season of success culminated in Manly-Warringah winning its eighth premiership, defeating the New Zealand Warriors 24–10 in the Grand Final. Glenn Stewart was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal for his 34 tackles and a crucial try in the second half. He and brother Brett Stewart became the first brothers to score tries in the same Grand Final. Manly-Warringah&#x27;s second premiership in four years made them the second team (after the Brisbane Broncos in 2000 and 2006) to win more than one premiership in the 21st century.

Six Weeks after Manly Warringah&#x27;s premiership win, the club dismissed head coach Des Hasler after he was revealed to have breached his contract by trying to lure coaching staff and players to the Bulldogs where he was to have started coaching in 2013. This meant that Geoff Toovey, who was to take over as part of a succession plan, was immediately elevated to the role of head coach from the start of the 2012 season.

=== 2012 season ===

Manly Warringah&#x27;s pre-season started dismally with a 38–6 loss to perennial strugglers Cronulla in the first match played under new coach Geoff Toovey. This was followed by a 26–12 loss in the 2012 World Club Challenge to Leeds Rhinos.

The Sea Eagles&#x27; premiership defence began with an away trip to Eden Park in Auckland where they faced the New Zealand Warriors in the Grand Final rematch and won 26–20. They backed up that close win with another close win against the Wests Tigers, winning 22–18. Manly-Warringah lost its first match for the 2012 season when it went down 17–13 to the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in a major upset, then another loss followed when it fell to 2010 premiers St. George Illawarra at Kogarah by 17–4.

Manly-Warringah ended the 2012 Regular season in 4th position on the ladder. After being defeated by the Bulldogs in the first week of the finals, Manly defeated the Nth Queensland Cowboys, effectively ending their season. However, the Sea Eagles&#x27; season ended the next week after being defeated by eventual premiers Melbourne Storm.

=== 2013 season ===

Ambushed early in the year by the sudden rise of two new title contenders in South Sydney and the Sydney Roosters, Manly spent much of the season flying under the radar with a top four spot safely in their keeping, but minor premiership never truly within their reach.

In fact, as the season wore on a mounting injury toll had many predicting this squad of ageing warriors were bound to hit the wall. Certainly a series of gruelling encounters at the business end of the season provided plenty of excuses had they wanted to use them, but instead it seemed the greater the challenge the more the Sea Eagles lifted to tackle it.

Having not beaten a fellow top four side all season, they finally did so in style with a 28–8 thrashing of Melbourne in Round 25 to warm up for the finals. Despite facing a number of hurdles through the course of the season – from a lengthy list of injury woes to the ASADA investigation which threatened to become a significant distraction at times – they managed to grow in stature as the season progressed but fell just short, losing the grand final to the Sydney Roosters 26–18.

=== 2014 season ===

Most of the headlines for Manly throughout the year came more due to off-field reasons following news popular back-rower Glenn Stewart would be joining Souths in 2015 with the club&#x27;s salary cap constraints preventing them from making him an offer.

It is a measure of the Northern Beaches club&#x27;s decade of excellence that to bow out in the second week of the finals will be deemed a comparative failure by both players and fans. This is what happened after a late-season stutter saw them relinquish their grip on the minor premiership, lose several key players at just the wrong time, and get bundled out of the 2014 Finals Series in straight sets despite their top-two finish.
Even though they achieved a top-two finish, bowing out second week of the finals resulted in an unsatisfactory result for the Sea Eagles for a side that was running first from rounds 18–25. They had their fair share of luck throughout the season but it deserted them at the wrong time and ended Manly&#x27;s season and encapsulated their late downturn in fortunes. There were huge questions over which senior players would stick around until the end of, or beyond, their current contracts. It was questioned if this could be very much a new-look Manly side in the next year or two but as long as the club can lock down its two star halves past their current 2015 deals the future should remain bright.

=== 2015 season ===

Manly struggled to maintain the previous consistency they produced over the past decade. They had made the finals every year for a decade, anything short of a top eight finish would have been seen a failure.

With success comes high expectations and Manly certainly didn&#x27;t hit their own lofty standards in 2015. The club endured one of its toughest seasons of the modern era with highly publicised contract sagas involving their biggest players, the sacking of their coach and club legend Geoff Toovey and a shocking run of injuries. The team had a late, but ultimately helpless last throw from a champion side to make the finals.

2015 will be forever remembered as the changing of the guard at the northern beaches club, when their era of dominance crashed dramatically back down to earth. It was a changing of the guard for Manly, a year where an era of dominance finally came to an end. They lost stalwarts Anthony Watmough (Eels) and Glenn Stewart (Rabbitohs) and struggled for a large chunk of the season. They then lost Kieran Foran (Eels) and coach Geoff Toovey. However, Manly had a strong back half of the 2015 season and ended up finishing 9th, only just missing the finals after being dead last going into Round 17 and in danger of earning the club&#x27;s first ever wooden spoon.

In a move seen to help turn the club&#x27;s fortunes around, Bob Fulton was brought back to the club as a &#x27;consultant&#x27; where he had a hand in the recruiting of a number of players for season 2016 such as Test and Qld Origin forward Nate Myles and South Sydney premiership centre Dylan Walker, as well as New Zealand internationals Lewis Brown and Martin Taupau. Fulton was also instrumental in convincing 2011 premiership halfback Daly Cherry-Evans to remain at the club after initially signing with the Gold Coast Titans. Also joining the club in 2016 would be boom Queensland hooker Matt Parcell from the Ipswich Jets, as well as Souths 2014 premiership hooker Apisai Koroisau. With the new recruits, plus the emergence of younger local juniors in 2015 including tough tackling front row forward Jake Trbojevic and his younger brother, pacey fullback/winger Tom Trbojevic, the future looks promising.

=== 2016 season ===
After Geoff Toovey was sacked following the 2015 season, Manly signed former Australian and NSW half Trent Barrett to coach in what would be his rookie year as an NRL head coach. The team would be without the services of Kiwi five-eighth Kieran Foran who had joined rivals Parramatta, as well as long serving dual-premiership hooker Matt Ballin who was released after suffering his second anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injury in two years. Local junior Clint Gutherson, who although he signed a contract extension with the club in 2015, was released following the season and he too joined Parramatta. Surprisingly, also let go was New Zealand test fullback/centre Peta Hiku who eventually joined Penrith.

In the first 9 rounds of the 2016 NRL season leading into the representative round, Manly&#x27;s injury woes continued with Brett Stewart (hamstring), Jorge Taufua (broken collar bone), Daly Cherry-Evans (ankle sprain) and Tom Trbojevic (ankle) going down with long-term injuries often forcing Trent Barrett into naming a makeshift lineup. However, despite this and the club&#x27;s horrendous draw which saw it have five 5 day turnarounds in the opening 9 rounds, they showed glimpses of becoming a top side once again, eventually finishing the regular season in 13th position, recording eight wins.

On 27 April, long serving premiership captain Jamie Lyon announced that he would retire from playing at the end of the 2016 season. Lyon, the club&#x27;s 2011 premiership captain and a member of the 2008 premiership team, is one of only 4 players (along with Graham Eadie, Bob Batty and Matthew Ridge) to have scored over 1,000 competition points for Manly.

=== 2017 season ===

After a turbulent 2016 Manly Warringah Sea Eagles season the Sea Eagles finished 6th position and made it to the 2017 NRL Finals Series, although lost the first week to Penrith. At the end of season awards Daly Cherry-Evans won the Roy and Bull for best and fairest player.

=== 2018 season ===

After the first two rounds, Manly were found guilty of minor breaches of the salary cap over the previous five years, due to a subtle change in one particular rule interpretation instigated by the NRL&#x27;s CEO. A $750,000 fine (250k suspended) and a $330,000 reduction in the salary cap for 2018 and 2019 seasons was imposed by the NRL.

Manly had not paid any player over what they declared to the NRL but the definition of the phrase &#x27;best efforts&#x27; to find third party payments was curiously changed to now mean an &#x27;iron clad guarantee&#x27;by the NRL&#x27;s CEO. Investigation of close to one million pieces of information and searches of all relevant electrical devices showed all payments to players were correctly and accurately reported to the NRL.
The NRL&#x27;s own salary auditors signed off as true and compliant all payments made to Manly players.

At the end of the 2018 season, Manly finished in 15th place on the table after a horror year on and off the field, one spot better than wooden spooners, Parramatta.
Throughout the season, there were rumours that surfaced highlighting major divisions and unrest with Barrett as coach. In October 2018, it was announced that two time premiership winning coach Des Hasler would return to Manly.

=== 2019 season ===

Before the start of the 2019 NRL season, many predicted that Manly would finish outside the top 8 and struggle towards the bottom of the table. Throughout the season though, Manly surprised many critics by spending nearly the entire regular season in the top 8 which included the club defeating Melbourne at AAMI Park 11–10 in golden point extra-time and also defeating other premiership contenders Canberra twice throughout the year. Manly-Warringah eventually qualified for the finals with a 6th-place finish.

Manly would go on to reach the second week of the finals series but were defeated by South Sydney, 34–26 in the elimination final at ANZ Stadium.

=== 2020 season ===

Manly-Warringah went into the 2020 NRL season with a good start winning four of their first six games before a serious injury to star player Tom Trbojevic derailed their season with Manly winning only three of their last fourteen games to finish 13th and miss out on the finals.

=== 2021 season ===

Manly didn&#x27;t start the 2021 NRL season well, losing their first four rounds. The match against Penrith, which they lost 46–6 at Brookvale Oval, was the club&#x27;s biggest ever home defeat at the ground.

However their season turned around, and by round 16, Manly recorded their biggest ever victory in club history, defeating Canterbury 66–0 at Western Sydney Stadium. After the regular rounds, Manly would finish in the top 4 in 4th place.

The top try scorers for Manly at the end of the Regular Season were Tom Trbojevic with 25 tries, Jason Saab with 23 tries, and Reuben Garrick with 21 tries.

Reuben Garrick became the first player in rugby league to score more than 300 points in a Regular Season. He also became the first player in rugby league history to score 20 tries and 100 goals in a Premiership Season.

After losing in the opening week of the finals against Melbourne, the club won in week two of the finals defeating the Sydney Roosters 42–6. In the preliminary final, the club fell short of reaching the grand final losing to South Sydney 36–16.

=== 2022 season ===

Manly-Warringah didn&#x27;t start the 2022 NRL season well, losing their first two rounds before winning their next four. Another serious injury to star player Tom Trbojevic in round 11 derailed their season once again with Manly winning only four of their last thirteen games to finish 11th and miss out on the finals. Their season was further marred by an incident when seven players boycotted the round 20 match against the Sydney Roosters due to their refusal to wear the club&#x27;s &quot;pride&quot; jersey, which was the start of an unfortunate end to the year for the Sea Eagles. On 13 October, the club decided to terminate Des Hasler as head coach.

=== 2023 season ===

Under new head coach Anthony Seibold, the club started strongly recording four wins and one draw from the opening seven games to sit 4th on the table. However, from round 8 until round 20, Manly only recorded three victories. The club would record four wins from their remaining seven matches as they finished in a disappointing 12th place.

===2024 season===
In the 2024 NRL season, Manly would finish 7th on the table and qualified for the finals. The club would defeat Canterbury in week one of the finals but their season was ended the following week by the Sydney Roosters.

==Emblem and colours==

The team has always been officially known as the &quot;Manly Warringah Sea Eagles&quot; since 1947.

Upon entering the NSWRL, Manly took on the colours of maroon and white. Manly chose the sea eagle – the native bird of prey on the Sydney coastline – as its emblem. The club&#x27;s first jersey was maroon with a large white &#x27;V&#x27; on the front. Manly were one of the first teams to feature an emblem, with an &#x27;MW&#x27; appearing in the early 1950s. The &#x27;Sea Eagle&#x27; has appeared on all jerseys since the mid-1950s. Several iterations of the sea eagle logo would appear over the years. From the 1980s, Manly would go on to use perhaps their most famous of logos used in what is regarded as their most successful years up until the creation of the new competition.

In conjunction with the new competition, the National Rugby League, Manly would change their logo in 1998. It featured predominantly maroon, white, yellow and blue to symbolise the connection the club had with its major sponsor at the time Pepsi. This logo would not last however when the ill-fated merger with North Sydney Bears in 2000 saw them take on the Northern Eagles moniker instead.

Upon their return in 2003, Manly opted to revert to the previous logo but slightly updated to focus on the sea eagle and include Warringah in the club&#x27;s name again. They also returned to their original colours, however a darker shade of maroon and white, a symbol of their roots stemming back from 1947.

In October 2023, Manly unveiled their new identity and emblem with a fresh, modern look, whilst also paying homage to the Club’s rich history. The new logo carried forward traditional Maroon and White colours and elements of the past Manly emblems including a familiar circular motif that the Sea Eagles have incorporated since 1978, whilst focusing on the sea eagle head with simplified details.

===Jerseys===

==Manly Leagues Club==

Manly Warringah Rugby Leagues Club (known as Manly Leagues) is one of the leading clubs on Sydney&#x27;s northern beaches. The Leagues Club has also acquired &quot;Dee Why Bowling Club&quot; to the Manly Leagues brand, which amalgamated in 2022.

Manly Leagues has always enjoyed a close association with the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles. The club&#x27;s charter includes the support of rugby league in the local area and the outstanding history of the Sea Eagles highlights the success of this support.

==Stadium==
When Manly Warringah was admitted into the competition, the then Manly Council denied the club permission to use Manly Oval as their home ground. The Council at the time, which already had the long established North Sydney club to contend with, was very pro-rugby union and attempted to prevent the rival code from spreading to the area. As a result, the club decided to acquire Brookvale Showground (now known as Brookvale Oval) to host matches, which was supported by the then Warringah Council, who owned the ground.

In its early days while still a showground, Brookvale Oval also had a Trotting track on the outside of the pitch that doubled in the summer months as a Dirt Oval speedway, a track frequented in the late 1940s by such drivers as Jack Brabham. The ground itself was described by former Sea Eagles Test player and television commentator Rex Mossop as being &quot;hard baked&quot; with not much grass covering, especially in the centre portion where most of the play took place.

From the mid-late 1960s, Brookvale Oval was into the rectangle shaped ground it is today through the removal of the outer track and old showground buildings that also doubled as change rooms on match days. The redevelopment, costing almost $500,000 which included the building of the then 3,000 seat Jane Try Stand which also housed the new changing rooms for the teams and a new Southern Stand located at the Pittwater Road (south) end of the ground .

Brookvale Oval (officially known as 4 Pines Park) is as of 2025, an 18,000-capacity rectangular stadium that has been the home of the Sea Eagles since 1947, with the venue last redeveloped in 2022 with the opening of the Bob Fulton Stand.

The ground now features four grandstands: the Jane Try Stand, which runs along the western side and is the largest; the Ken Arthurson Stand, located in the southwest corner and named after the long-serving Manly player and coach as well as being a Manly, NSWRL, and ARL administrator; the Lyons-Menzies Stand, situated at the southern end and named after champion Manly players Steve Menzies and Cliff Lyons; and the new 3,000-seat Bob Fulton Stand at the northern end, which incorporates the club&#x27;s centre of excellence. A grass hill runs along the eastern side of the ground, and the venue also features broadcast-quality lights and a video screen.

Brookvale Oval has often been regarded as a graveyard for many opposition teams, earning it the nickname &#x27;Fortress Brookvale.&#x27;

The record crowd at the ground is 27,655, set in the final round of the 1986 season against traditional rivals, the Parramatta Eels. Since the club started playing in 1947, over six million spectators have visited the ground.

Of the permanent venues used by the NRL, Brookvale Oval ranks second for the most games played, with 720 games, behind only Leichhardt Oval (as of October 2023).

In addition to hosting home games at Brookvale, Manly also play a home game against the Brisbane Broncos at Lang Park as part of Magic Round in Brisbane. 

=== Naming Rights ===
In February 2017, a 3-year $1 million naming rights deal with Lottoland, renamed Brookvale Oval to &quot;Lottoland&quot;. In August 2019 Lottoland group exercised its option to extend the sponsorship contract, worth $500,000 for another year to the end of the 2020 season. The final game to be played under the name &quot;Lottoland&quot; was in Round 9, 2021 of the NRL between the Sea Eagles and New Zealand Warriors.

In June 2021, a 4-year deal was signed with 4 Pines Brewing Company to be named &quot;4 Pines Park&quot;

In January 2025, before the start of the new season, the Sea Eagles and 4 Pines Brewing Co. announced the renewal of the stadium naming rights partnership, extending the agreement for 4 Pines Park to the end of the 2027 season.

4 Pines has proudly held the naming rights to the Northern Beaches local iconic Brookvale Oval, now known as 4 Pines Park, since 2021.

==Administration and Facilities==
In March 2022, the Centre of Excellence at the western end of the oval, formerly home to the &#x27;Family Hill&#x27; was opened. The club moved all training and administration operations to this new, 4-storey building as well as the centre providing approximately 3,000 seats and premium hospitality spaces to be utilised on match day. The centre of excellence features change rooms, pools, a gym, training and medical spaces and general administration areas for staff to utilise.

In round 3 of the 2022 NRL season, Manly played their first match back at the redeveloped Brookvale Oval defeating Canterbury-Bankstown 13–12.

==Local catchment area==

Historically, Manly has had a rich history of local juniors representing the first grade side, including former Australian, State and Club captains Max Krilich and Geoff Toovey. Other notable former local juniors include 4-time Premiership winners Ian Martin and Terry Randall and 2-time Premiership winners Steven Menzies and Anthony Watmough.

Local rugby league clubs play within the joint Manly-Warringah/North Sydney District Rugby League district competition. And teams are identified with either Norths or Manly, with teams in the Manly, Warringah and Pittwater (Northern Beaches and Forest District) districts wearing the Manly logo, whilst teams in the North Sydney (North Shore and Hornsby Shire) district compete with the North Sydney logo.

In 1990, the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles club recognised their players, past and present, with a team announced to reflect the best squad up to that point. That team is listed below.








In 2006, a Dream Team of former Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles players was selected by a panel of selectors which featured former Manly-Warringah administrator Ken Arthurson, respected rugby league writer Ian Heads, the club chairman Kerry Sibraa and journalist Phil Rothfield.








==Rivalries==

===North Sydney Bears===
Prior to the ill-fated Northern Eagles joint venture from 2000 to 2002, the rivalry between the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and foundation club the North Sydney Bears was arguably one of rugby league&#x27;s fiercest. Manly were admitted into the premiership in 1947 with North Sydney at the time being one of the main advocators for a team to be in Manly. In Manly&#x27;s first season, most of the side was made up of former Norths players including captain Max Whitehead who played for North Sydney in their 1943 Grand Final defeat by Newtown.

The intense feelings between the two sides continued over the next couple of decades fuelled as players switched between the two clubs. The biggest defection occurred in 1971 when North&#x27;s life member and one of the game&#x27;s greatest wingers Ken Irvine joined Manly. Former Manly and North Sydney player Phil Blake said of the rivalry &quot;It was certainly a game you looked forward playing in. The ground was always packed and it was always a great afternoon&quot;.

In 2016, North Sydney and Manly played their final competitive senior game against each other in the Canterbury Cup competition where the Bears won the match 32–18. The Sea Eagles announced that they would be merging their lower grade sides with the Blacktown Workers teams to become the Blacktown Workers Sea Eagles. The only competitive games played between the two clubs as of 2017 are between the Bears and Sea Eagles Harold Matthews Cup, SG Ball Cup and Jersey Flegg Cup competitions.

===Melbourne Storm===
This was regarded as one of the biggest rivalries in the modern era, with the two clubs meeting in the 2007 and 2008 Grand Finals.

The 2008 Grand Final saw the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles defeat their biggest rivals, the Melbourne Storm 40-0 at ANZ Stadium in front of a crowd of 80,388. In the game, Manly ran in eight tries to record the highest rugby league Grand Final margin in Australian history. It was Manly&#x27;s seventh premiership title.

After Manly went on to win the 2011 premiership, both teams faced off in the 2012 preliminary final in Melbourne. Melbourne defeated Manly 40–12, ending Manly’s chances of winning back-to-back titles. Melbourne would then go on to win their second legitimate premiership, following the stripping of their 2007 and 2009 titles after the NRL discovered systematic salary cap breaches by the club .

After nine years without playing each other in the finals, Manly and Melbourne met in week one of the 2021 NRL finals series, where Melbourne won the match 40–12 at Sunshine Coast Stadium.

===Parramatta Eels===
The Manly Warringah Sea Eagles and the Parramatta Eels, built a fierce rivalry that started in the 1970s. They met in the 1976 NSWRFL Grand Final, in which Manly denied Parramatta a maiden premiership. However, Parramatta won both the 1982 and 1983 Grand Finals against Manly. Since the 1983 Grand Final, Manly and Parramatta have only played against each other in one other finals game, which was in 2005 when Parramatta finished as Minor Premiers and Manly finished in 8th place. Parramatta won the match 46–22.

On 18 May 2003, Parramatta and Manly played in the first-ever golden point match in NRL history. Manly won the match 36–34 at Brookvale Oval, courtesy of a Ben Walker penalty goal. In Round 2 of the 2018 NRL season, Parramatta suffered their worst-ever loss to Manly. The game was played in temperatures of nearly 40 degrees, where Manly ran out 54-0 winners.

In the 2019 NRL season, Parramatta beat Manly in Round 25 to take Manly&#x27;s fifth spot on the ladder and would go on to beat Brisbane 58–0 in the elimination final. The victory is currently the biggest win in finals history.
In Round 11 of the 2022 NRL season, Manly led Parramatta by ten points in the second half before Parramatta scored two tries to make it 20-20. Parramatta&#x27;s Mitchell Moses then converted a goal from the sideline to win the match 22–20.
In Round 21 of the 2022 NRL season, the two sides met at Brookvale Oval, where Manly needed to defeat Parramatta to have any chance of reaching the finals. Parramatta won the game 36–20, with the maligned Jakob Arthur providing two try assists for Parramatta, which ended Manly&#x27;s finals hopes.

===Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks===
This rivalry has been dubbed the &quot;Battle of the beaches&quot;, and they met in a brutal Grand Final in 1973 which was described as the dirtiest and 
toughest Grand Final of them all. Manly also defeated Cronulla 16–0 in the 1978 Grand Final Rematch after the original contest had an 11–11 draw. In 1996, Manly and Cronulla played each other in the 1996 preliminary final where Manly defeated Cronulla 24–0. In the 2013 finals series, the two clubs met at the Sydney Football Stadium with Manly running out 24-18 winners.

In week one of the 2019 finals series, Manly defeated Cronulla to win the game 28–16 at Brookvale Oval and eliminated Cronulla from the finals race.

===Western Suburbs===
Manly-Warringah had a fierce rivalry with foundation club Western Suburbs which started in the 1970s and continued through to the early 1980s. The rivalry was dubbed as the &quot;Fibros vs Silvertails&quot;. Former Wests coach and now respected league writer Roy Masters was the brain behind the now famous catch-cry. The rivalry was also fierce due to the two club&#x27;s competing for the premiership with Western Suburbs winning the Minor Premiership in 1978 but it was Manly who claimed the 1978 premiership defeating Wests in the semi-finals.

Cliff Lyons holds the club record for most first-grade games (309). Steve Menzies played 349 first-grade games, although 69 were with the Northern Eagles. The club record for most career points is held by Graham Eadie (1,917). Matthew Ridge held the highest season total with 257 points in 1995, a record that has since been overtaken by Reuben Garrick, who scored 304 points in 2021. Brett Stewart is the top try scorer with 163 tries, surpassing the previous record held by Steve Menzies. Menzies scored 151 tries playing for Manly-Warringah and a further 29 during the Northern Eagles venture. Menzies is regarded as the highest try-scoring forward in the history of the game, although there is some contention about the exact number of tries scored, as he started some games playing in the centres. There is also debate over Manly&#x27;s career try-scoring record with respect to Menzies and his time with the Northern Eagles.

<text>Kawerau is a town in the Bay of Plenty Region on the North Island of New Zealand. It is situated 100 km south-east of Tauranga and 58 km east of Rotorua. It is the seat of the Kawerau District Council, and the only town in Kawerau District.

Kawerau is a small community, with an economy that is largely driven by the nearby pulp and paper mill that is run by Norske Skog and OJI Fibre Solutions. It is located along State Highway 34, southwest of Onepu, and is the terminus of the East Coast Main Trunk Railway, and the commencing point of the Murupara Branch railway.

Kawerau is among the three towns in New Zealand with a majority Māori population, along with Ōpōtiki and Wairoa. Kawerau was one of the worst-affected towns in the 1987 Edgecumbe earthquake.

== History and culture ==

===European settlement===

Kawerau, one of the youngest towns in New Zealand, was founded in 1953 as a mill town for the new Tasman pulp and paper mill. The site for the mill was chosen by the Tasman Pulp and Paper Company because of the ready availability of geothermal energy, water from the Tarawera River and the large supply of pine timber from the nearby Kaingaroa Forest. The town site was chosen in February 1953.

Unlike most other towns of its size, Kawerau was carefully planned before construction. The town was built with an impressive number of facilities, to accommodate a multinational specialist workforce. The mill continues to drive the local economy and greatly influences the fortunes of the town. The town&#x27;s population peaked in the early 1980s (8718 in the 1981 census) but has declined significantly since then due to the restructuring of the mill and of associated industries.

===Recent history===
In 2012, mill owner Norske Skog said it would be shutting one of the two newsprint machines at the mill. In January 2013, it was confirmed nearly half the mill&#x27;s jobs would be lost.

Norse Skog of Norway, which is the world&#x27;s second-biggest producer of newsprint, confirmed the closure of one of its two paper machines at the Tasman Mill at Kawerau with the loss of 110 jobs. The company first announced its intention to shut one machine last September, following a review of its newsprint capacity in Australasia. The remaining Tasman machine would continue to produce newsprint, predominantly for the New Zealand and Australian markets. Norske Skog management would work closely with employees, unions and other stakeholders on the detailed closure arrangements, including a mill-wide restructuring programme. Peter McCartey, General Manager of Tasman Mill said it was widely understood the decision had been brought about by global market forces within the industry. The second paper machine had operated successfully for over 50 years. Norske Skog has the widest geographical spread of all the paper producers, with mills in 11 countries on all continents except Africa.

As of July 16, 2021, all of the three newsprint paper machines have ceased operation due to less demand as the world is going digital.

Kawerau is also home to geothermal power supply Kawerau Power Station for the local industry as well as the rest of New Zealand.

===Marae===

The local marae, Tohia o te Rangi, is affiliated with the Ngāti Tūwharetoa hapū of Ngāi Tamarangi. It features the Waitaha Ariki Kore meeting house.

The volcanic cone of Mount Edgecumbe/Putauaki lies to the east of Kawerau, and is easily visible from the town. The Tarawera River straddles Kawerau to the east and continues north to the Bay of Plenty. Water is supplied to the town from two natural springs. Kawerau&#x27;s water was judged the best-tasting in New Zealand in 2003 and 2004.

Kawerau has access to vast geothermal resources. There are a number of geothermal hot springs in the surrounding bush owned and operated by local families. The Kawerau geothermal field provides steam power for the paper mill, and a 90 MW geothermal power station is currently under construction.

=== Kawerau Woodfest &amp; National Woodskills Competition ===
The National Woodskills Festival is a competition that encompasses a broad spectrum of wood craftsmanship and wood art. Some of the competitors are professionals, but many are amateurs. The Woodskills Festival was first held in Kawerau in 1989 as a local competition. By 1991, the event had become such a popular annual competition that it was developed into a national event, attracting exhibitors from throughout New Zealand. The competition has now developed into a broader range of attractions which captivates many skills from the Forestry Industry and now takes over the town for the weekend, in what is known as Kawerau Woodfest.

<text>Laws of Attraction is a 2004 romantic comedy film directed by Peter Howitt, based on a story by Aline Brosh McKenna and screenplay by Robert Harling and McKenna. It stars Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore.

==Plot==
High-powered divorce attorneys Audrey Woods and Daniel Rafferty have seen love go wrong in many scenarios—so, how good could their own chances be? As two of the top divorce lawyers in New York, Audrey and Daniel are a study in opposites. She practices law strictly by the book. He seems to win by the seat of his pants, or by &quot;cheap theatrics,&quot; as Audrey says in one scene.

Soon the two lawyers are pitted against one another in several high-profile divorce cases, including a nasty public split between rock star Thorne Jamison and his dress-designer wife, Serena. The settlement hinges on an Irish castle, Caisleán Cloiche, or &quot;Rock Castle,&quot; that each spouse wants. Audrey and Daniel travel to Ireland to chase down depositions, and both stay in the castle. Although Audrey, at least, is reluctant to acknowledge their mutual attraction, they find themselves attending a romantic Irish festival together. After a night of wild celebration, they wake up the next morning to discover they have wed. Audrey is shocked, though Daniel takes their apparent marriage in his stride.

The pair return to New York and find news of their wedding printed on Page 6 of the New York Post the following day. Audrey suggests the two maintain the semblance of a marriage for the sake of their careers, and Daniel moves into the guest room of Audrey&#x27;s apartment. Although, in the courtroom they continue to fight the Jamisons&#x27; high-profile divorce case with the gusto they have always shown, at home, they settle into domestic life together. While disposing of garbage one day, Daniel accidentally discovers some sensitive information about Audrey&#x27;s client, Thorne Jamison, which he reveals in the next day&#x27;s court proceedings. Audrey feels betrayed and asks for a divorce, which Daniel agrees to give, citing his love for her.

Next, their famous clients each return to the castle in Ireland, even though they are not permitted to be there because of the pending division of assets. Judge Abramovitz sends their respective counselors to Ireland to inform them of this, but on arrival they discover the celebrity couple has reconciled on the seventh anniversary of their wedding, which took place at the castle. Audrey and Daniel then learn that the &quot;priest&quot; who performed their own marriage ceremony is in fact the Jamisons&#x27; butler, and the &quot;weddings&quot; he presided over at the festival were simply romantic celebrations.

Daniel returns immediately to New York, alone, but with Audrey fast on his heels, as she realizes she has fallen in love with him. Confronting him in the grocery store below Daniel&#x27;s Chinatown office, Audrey asks Daniel if he is willing to fight to save their relationship. In the romantic final scenes, the couple are married in a private ceremony in Judge Abramovitz&#x27;s chambers, with Audrey&#x27;s mother as the sole witness.

<doc id="885310" wikidata="Q7243079" url="?curid=885310" title="Primary Mathematics World Contest">
<text>The Primary Mathematics World Contest (PMWC; ) is an annual math competition for primary school students in Hong Kong. It was first held in 1997 and is sponsored by Po Leung Kuk. The competition has attracted teams from around the world.

==History==
The first Primary Mathematics World Contest (PMWC) was organised in 1997. The sponsors of the competition are the charitable organisation Po Leung Kuk, the public university Hong Kong Institute of Education, and Panda Hotel. Competitions are held at the Panda Hotel, which is in the Tsuen Wan town of New Territories West.

In the 21st competition in 2018, there were 32 teams that represented Australia, Bulgaria, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macau, Malaysia, Mongolia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, the United States, Thailand, and Vietnam. The 22nd competition took place on five days in July 2019. After COVID-19 prevented the contest from being held in-person, Po Leung Kuk had restarted it according to a 2023 article in HK01.

==Format==
The event has an individual and a team competition. The individual contest&#x27;s participants have 90 minutes to finish 15 math questions. The ratio of gold to silver to bronze medals is 1:2:3, and half of the participants receive medals. In 2016, a student who got all the questions right received gold medals, while students who got one question wrong received a silver medal. In 2014, the cutoffs for bronze, silver, and gold were 10/15, 12/15, and 14/15 solves respectively. 

During the team competition, team members have 60 minutes to finish 10 math questions. Each team has four people. First, the four participants are given 8 questions, where they have about 10 minutes to skim through them and distribute the problems amongst themselves. They then individually work on the questions they&#x27;ve selected until time is up. It is not required for each participant to get exactly 2 of the 8 questions. Afterwards, they are no longer allowed to work on these 8 questions and must work on the last 2 questions together as a group.
