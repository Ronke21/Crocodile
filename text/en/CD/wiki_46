<text>8 Foot Sativa is a New Zealand–based extreme metal band formed in 1998. Their most famous single is their self-titled song, &quot;8 Foot Sativa&quot;, which was number one on the M2 (a late night New Zealand music show) top 12 list for 12 weeks, and stayed on the chart for seven months. The band has toured and released albums internationally, and have played alongside artists such as Fear Factory, Soulfly, Korn, Slipknot, System of a Down, Children of Bodom, Disturbed, Motörhead, Pungent Stench, Shihad and Corrosion of Conformity. 8 Foot Sativa have become a household name in New Zealand.

==History==

===Early days (1998–2002)===
8 Foot Sativa formed when members Brent Fox and Gary Smith met at Massey High School in Auckland, New Zealand. They both enjoyed metal music and played music together. Peter &#x27;Speed&#x27; Young from Kelston Boys&#x27; High School joined the band as the band&#x27;s drummer. &#x27;Fat&#x27; Dave was on the bass guitar. In their early days, they were a cover band, who played music from Pantera, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Sepultura, Metallica and Slayer.

&#x27;Fat&#x27; Dave often did not turn up to practices, so Brent Fox moved from guitar to bass. The band met their next vocalist, Ari, at a music school, where he was formally training as a drummer. Ari was the first vocalist to write original songs for the band, and wrote &quot;Fuel Set&quot;, &quot;Kick It All Away&quot; and &quot;Engine&quot;, which later appeared on the band&#x27;s debut album.

During this time, the band met Justin &#x27;Jackhammer&#x27; Niessen at a mall. According to Gary Smith: &quot;He used to sneak into the gigs and we&#x27;d sneak him beers&quot;. After Ari&#x27;s disappearance from the band (the other members didn&#x27;t see him for several years), Niessen became the new vocalist.

Niessen is famous among 8 Foot Sativa fans for occasionally collapsing on-stage due to the strain of his vocal performances, most notably during a performance of &quot;Destined to be Dead&quot; on a New Zealand music show, Space. NZMusician.com claims that these collapses were due to, &quot;shortage of breath attributed to a lack of vocal training&quot;.

===&quot;Hate Made Me&quot; (2002)===
In 2002, 8 Foot Sativa released their debut album, &quot;Hate Made Me&quot;, with the album later receiving gold status within New Zealand for selling more than 7,500 copies Shortly after the release of &quot;Hate Made Me&quot;, Young left the band, reportedly citing &#x27;musical differences&#x27;. He was replaced with Sinate drummer, Sam Sheppard.

This album features what is probably 8 Foot Sativa&#x27;s most well-known song, the eponymous &quot;8 Foot Sativa&quot;, which is a staple of their live shows. It also appeared in an episode of Monster Garage.

===&quot;Season For Assault&quot; (2003)===
In 2003, 8 Foot Sativa released their second album &quot;Season for Assault&quot;, which neared gold status within New Zealand. The album features well- known songs &quot;Chelsea Smile&quot; and &quot;Season For Assault&quot;.

Niessen resigned from the band two weeks before they were set to fly to Sweden to record their third album. The singer position was vacant for two days before Sam Sheppard&#x27;s brother (and fellow Sinate member), Matt Sheppard, became 8 Foot Sativa&#x27;s new vocalist.

===&quot;Breed The Pain&quot; (2005)===
With a new vocalist, 8 Foot Sativa released their third album &quot;Breed the Pain&quot; in 2005. It was recorded at Studio Underground in Sweden. Matt Sheppard wrote or co-wrote six of the songs on the album, and his girlfriend provided the artwork.

Matt and Sam Sheppard left 8 Foot Sativa after the Breed the Pain tour. They later reformed their previous band, Sinate. They joined forces with 8 Foot Sativa&#x27;s guitar technician Sean Parkinson and Antony &quot;Colonel&quot; Folwell from the band Reprobate.

Justin &#x27;Jackhammer&#x27; Niessen toured with the band temporarily from 9 September until 17 September, playing a four concert tour around New Zealand. This tour also saw newcomers William Cleverdon and Corey Friedlander, joining the band. For the concert tour, Niessen and the band played songs mainly from &quot;Hate Made Me&quot; and &quot;Season for Assault&quot;, the albums which Niessen performed on.

===&quot;Poison of Ages&quot; (2007)===
Ben Read, from New Zealand death metal band Ulcerate and formerly of hardcore band Kill Me Quickly, joined the band as the new vocalist. 8 Foot Sativa went over to Studio Underground in Sweden again to record their fourth album, titled &quot;Poison of Ages&quot;. Corey Friedlander did not perform drums on the album and would later leave the band to focus on his other project Final Eve. Steven Westerberg of Carnal Forge stepped in as a session musician, and Friedlander was ultimately replaced by Jamie Saint Merat, also of Ulcerate.

&quot;Poison of Ages&quot; was originally meant to be released on 8 May 2006, however it was postponed due to a breached contract. Ben Read stated on the official forum&#x27;s that the album would not be released until the band could put together NZ$20,000. The album was finally released on 21 May 2007.

Several members of the band departed in the meantime: In October 2006, original member Brent Fox decided to leave the band, leaving Gary Smith as the only original member. Fox was replaced by Rommily Smith. Guitarist William Cleverdon, who had earlier taken a hiatus of several months, was forced to leave in January 2007 after he was required to undergo a series of surgeries on his left wrist and forearm. Christian Humphreys, a member of Rommily&#x27;s other band, New Way Home, replaced Cleverdon

Lyrics on &quot;Poison of Ages&quot; were written by Ben Read and Gary Smith, and the album as a whole was influenced by blackened death metal.

===2009===

Gary Smith returned from injury to rejoin the band. Jamie Saint Merat left the band to relocate with his other band, Ulcerate.

8 Foot Sativa, still working on a new unnamed album, released a new single called &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot;. The video to this single is controversial, as it follows a calf from the farm, to the freezing works showing it being killed, then chopped up by butchers, before being sold to a family in a supermarket. It does this in graphical disturbing way. It also shows pigs and chickens being held in cages. A message at the end of the video states &quot;Thousands of animals were harmed in the making of this video.&quot;

In July 2009, bassist Romilly Smith left the band, with Steve Boag, of In Dread Response, taking his spot. Before heading to the studio to record the new still unnamed album, 8 Foot Sativa are to travel New Zealand, performing final shows, with In Dread Response, New Way Home, Bloodletting, The Rest Is Silence.., and other various local acts across New Zealand

===2010===
In January 2010, 8 Foot Sativa went into hiatus due to the continued effects of Smith&#x27;s injury. The remaining members formed a new band project, The Mark of Man, while Smith continued his recovery.

===2011===

After a couple of years on hiatus, the social media connected fan base started talking and rumours began when the band&#x27;s Facebook page was completely stripped back and saturated by their original theme and imagery including the one and only &quot;dopeman&quot; the band&#x27;s featured character and mascot which became the band&#x27;s non-forgettable logo and animated menace seen in their early music videos, a tall and cheeky Sativa plant usually pulling himself in and around war zones and heated political situations with his large leafy arms.

With the return of Justin &quot;Jackhammer&quot; Niessen and the addition of Nik Davies from Death Metal act &quot;Perditionist&quot; the band released a greatest hits compilation entitled &quot;10 Years of Sativa&quot; in 2012. This campaign saw the band touring relentlessly right up until the recording and release of what soon was to become &quot;The Shadow Masters&quot;

===&quot;The Shadow Masters&quot; (2013)===
8 Foot Sativa entered Quicksand Studio in Christchurch, New Zealand in early 2013 to record their 5th studio album &#x27;The Shadow Masters&#x27;.
The line up for this album is:

Vocals – Justin &quot;Jackhammer&quot; Niessen
Drums – Corey Friedlander
Guitar – Gary Smith
Guitar – Nik Davies
Bass – Brent Fox

8 Foot Sativa have Clint Murphy from Modern World Studio in the UK producing this album. The Shadow Masters was released on 30 August 2013.

===&quot;Hate Re-Made Me&quot; (2015)===
The line up consisted of the three original members plus Nik Davies and Corey Friedlander.

With Clint Murphy back on board, the less than $1000 produced HMM record got a complete re-amp as the band dropped 40k into studio time for a re-recording.

A recent interview with Nik Davies brought light upon the situation where he simply stated that &quot;its there, we are proud of it and it will be released when we feel it&#x27;s right to do so. 8 Foot Sativa will always exist, we&#x27;re not going anywhere&quot;

<doc id="887492" wikidata="Q125999304" url="?curid=887492" title="Duke of Noailles">
<text>The title of Duke of Noailles was a French peerage created in 1663 for Anne de Noailles, Count of Ayen.

==History==
Noailles is the name of a prominent French noble family, derived from the castle of Noailles in the territory of Ayen, between Brive and Turenne in Limousin, and claiming to date back to the 11th century. The family did not obtain fame until the 16th century, when its head, Antoine de Noailles (1504–1562), became admiral of France and was ambassador in England during three important years (1553–1556), maintaining a gallant but unsuccessful rivalry with the Spanish ambassador, Simon Renard. Henri de Noailles (1554–1623), son of Antoine, was a commander in the religious wars and was made comte d&#x27;Ayen by Henry IV of France in 1593.

Anne de Noailles (died 1678), the grandson of the first count, played an important part in the Fronde and the early years of the reign of Louis XIV, became captain-general of the newly won province of Roussillon, and in 1663 was made Duke of Noailles and a peer of France.

The sons of the first duke raised the family to its greatest fame. The eldest son, Anne Jules de Noailles (1650–1708), was one of the chief generals of France towards the end of the reign of Louis XIV. After raising the regiment of Noailles in 1689, he commanded in Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession and was made Marshal of France in 1693. A younger son, Louis Antoine de Noailles (1651–1729), was in 1695 made archbishop of Paris and hence also Duke of Saint-Cloud and peer of France in his own right, holding these high dignities until his death; he was made a cardinal in 1699.

The name of Noailles continued to be prominent throughout the 18th century. Adrien Maurice (1678–1766), the third duke, served in all the most important wars of the reign of Louis XV in Italy and Germany, and became a marshal in 1734. His last command was in the War of the Austrian Succession, when he was beaten by the English at the battle of Dettingen in 1743. He married Françoise Charlotte d&#x27;Aubigné, a niece of Madame de Maintenon, and two of his sons also attained the rank of Marshal of France.

The elder son of Adrien Maurice, Louis (1713–1793), who bore the title of duc d&#x27;Ayen until his father&#x27;s death in 1766, when he became Duke of Noailles, served in most of the wars of the 18th century without particular distinction, but was nevertheless made a marshal in 1775. He refused to emigrate during the Revolution, but escaped the guillotine by dying in August 1793, before the Terror reached its height. On the 4th Thermidor (July 22), the aged duchesse de Noailles was executed with her daughter-in-law, the duchesse d&#x27;Ayen, and her granddaughter, the vicomtesse de Noailles. His younger brother, Philippe (1715–1794), comte de Noailles, afterwards Duke of Mouchy, was a more distinguished soldier than his brother.

Jean Paul François (1739–1824), the fifth duke, was in the army, but his tastes were scientific, and for his eminence as a chemist he was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1777. He became Duke of Ayen in 1766 on his grandfather&#x27;s death, and Duke of Noailles on his father&#x27;s in 1793. Having emigrated in 1792, he lived in Switzerland until the Restoration in 1814, when he took his seat as a peer of France.

He had no son, and was succeeded as Duke of Noailles by his grand-nephew, Paul (1802–1885), who won some reputation as an author and who became a member of the French Academy in the place of Chateaubriand in 1849. The grandfather of Paul de Noailles, and brother of the fifth duke, Emmanuel Marie Louis (1743–1822), marquis de Noailles, was ambassador at Amsterdam from 1770–1776, at London from 1776–1783, and at Vienna from 1783–1792.

<text>Langeland (, ) is a Danish island located between the Great Belt and Bay of Kiel. The island measures 285 km2 (c. 110 square miles) and, as of 1 January 2018, has a population of 12,446. The island produces grain and is known as a recreational and wellness tourism area. A bridge connects it to Tåsinge via Siø – a small island with a population of approximately 20 – and the main island of Funen (to the northwest). There are connections by car ferry to the islands of Lolland, Ærø, and Strynø.

Rudkøbing, the island&#x27;s largest town, is the birthplace of famous physicist and chemist Hans Christian Ørsted, his brother, Anders Sandøe Ørsted, a former Danish prime minister, and their nephew, botanist Anders Sandøe Ørsted.

Administratively, Langeland and several smaller islands around it form the &quot;Municipality of Langeland,&quot; the most populous of them being Strynø.

== Role in the Larne gun-running ==
On 30 March 1914, the vessel &quot;SS Fanny&quot; docked at Langeland and proceeded to be loaded with a &quot;mysterious&quot; cargo. This cargo turned out to be a weapons cache including 11,000 Männlicher rifles brought from the Steyr works in Austria; 9,000 ex-German army Mausers; 4,600 Italian Vetterli-Vitali rifles; and 5 million rounds of ammunition in clips of five. The cache had been purchased by Major Frederick Hugh Crawford for the Ulster Unionist Council to equip the Ulster Volunteer Force in Ireland.

Danish customs officials suspected that the cargo might have contained weapons to arm militant Icelandic home rulers who sought independence from Denmark. However the &quot;SS Fanny&quot; cut loose, escaped in a gale and sailed out of Danish territorial waters.

The weapons cache would later land in Larne on the north-east coast of Ireland in what became known as the Larne gun-running.

<text>Rotting Christ is a Greek black metal band formed in 1987. They are noted for being one of the first black metal bands within this region, as well as a premier act within the European underground metal scene. They are also responsible for creating the signature Greek black metal sound prevalent in the early 1990s.

== History ==
Rotting Christ was founded in 1987 as a grindcore act. They released a series of demos and splits with local bands during their rehearsal era. During this period, the group gradually altered their sound with influence from proto-black metal bands like Celtic Frost and Venom, and in the process became one of the inaugurators of black metal. Their 1989 demo, &quot;Satanas Tedeum&quot;, presented a crossover between black metal and grindcore. In 1991, the band released &quot;Passage to Arcturo&quot;, their career-breaking EP.

One of band&#x27;s major debuts was on the 1993 &quot;Fuck Christ Tour&quot;, which also featured Immortal and Blasphemy. During this concert, some audience members engaged in cutting and self-mutilation that resulted in hospitalization. Before signing to Unisound Records (a now-defunct Athens-based independent record label founded in 1992), Mayhem&#x27;s Øystein Aarseth had expressed interest in distributing the band through his Deathlike Silence Productions label, but due to Aarseth&#x27;s murder the same year, nothing materialized. The band signed to Century Media in 1996 and remained on their roster for 10 years before joining Season of Mist.

Rotting Christ has played in many regions outside their native Greece, including the Americas, Greater Europe, Russia, the United Kingdom, Malta, the Middle East and South Africa. Several heavy metal festivals around the world have hosted the band, including the 2003 Wacken Open Air in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Past tour-mates include My Dying Bride, Tristania, Tiamat, Vintersorg, Finntroll, Agathodaimon, Old Man&#x27;s Child, Malevolent Creation, Anorexia Nervosa, Vader, Krisiun, Deicide, Behemoth, Melechesh and Nile, among many others.

Rotting Christ was one of the first bands announced to perform the Barge to Hell festival, which is a metal-themed cruise organized by Ultimate Metal Cruises and took place aboard Royal Caribbean&#x27;s &quot;Majesty of the Seas&quot;. Barge to Hell set sail from Port of Miami on December 3, 2012.

, Rotting Christ has been around for 37 years and is one of the longest running bands within the black metal genre. In celebration of the band&#x27;s longevity, the 2-DVD + 2-CD compilation &quot;Non Serviam: A 20 Year Apocryphal Story&quot;, shot in Athens on December 8, 2007, was released in Europe and North America February 23, 2009.

&quot;Aealo&quot;, the band&#x27;s tenth studio album, was released on February 15, 2010, in Europe and February 23, 2010, in the United States.

Their eleventh album, &quot;Katá ton Daímona Eautoú&quot;, was released in March 2013.

They made their first appearance in South Asia on September 13, 2014, in India (Bangalore Open Air 2014 Edition) and September 14, 2014, in Sri Lanka.

Their twelfth studio album, &quot;Rituals&quot;, was released on February 12, 2016.

To coincide with their 30th anniversary, the band released a new 7-inch single &quot;The Call&quot; on February 9, 2018; the single&#x27;s b-side is a live version of &quot;The Sign of Evil Existence&quot;, which includes guest vocals by Behemoth&#x27;s Nergal and Varathron&#x27;s Stefan Necroabyssious. The band also released an official biography entitled &quot;Non Serviam: The Official Story Of Rotting Christ&quot; in late November 2018, written by Sakis Tolis and British author Dayal Patterson (author of &#x27;Black Metal: Evolution Of The Cult&#x27;, &#x27;The Cult Never Dies Vol. One&#x27; and &#x27;Into The Abyss&#x27;) and published by British publishing house Cult Never Dies. The book features extensive interviews with Sakis Tolis, Themis Tolis, Jim Mutilator, Morbid, George Emmanuel and members of the bands Watain, Mayhem, Enslaved, Moonspell, Blasphemy, Mystifier, Septicflesh, Behemoth, Macabre Omen, Cradle Of Filth and Immolation The book has since been released in Greek, Russian and Czech languages.

Rotting Christ&#x27;s thirteenth studio album, &quot;The Heretics&quot;, was released on February 15, 2019.

In 2020, Rotting Christ announced a collaboration with the video game developer Cold Symmetry on their action role-playing video game, Mortal Shell. The game&#x27;s launch trailer, released in August 2020, featured the song &quot;χξς (666)&quot; as its soundtrack. In addition, a downloadable content pack, titled &quot;Rotten Autumn&quot;, was released for the game in October 2020 and includes, among other content, an alternative soundtrack composed by Rotting Christ.

Rotting Christ&#x27;s fourteenth studio album, &quot;Pro Xristou&quot;, was released on May 20, 2024.

=== Line-up ===
The permanent line-up consists of brothers Sakis Tolis (vocals and guitar) and Themis Tolis (drums). Third founding member Jim Patsouris played bass until 1996. Andreas Lagios was the bassist since 1997, taking the stead of Patsouris until the end of 2011. Nightfall&#x27;s Giorgos Bokos joined as a guitarist in 2005, replacing Costas Vasilakopoulos. In February 2012, Bokos announced his departure from the band for personal reasons. In December 2012, the new members of the band were announced: guitarist George Emmanuel and bassist Vagelis Karzis. George Emmanuel and Vagelis Karzis amicably left the band in February and May 2019 respectively to pursue other projects.

Three keyboardists had previously been a part of the band; George Tolias, George Zaharopoulos (Magus Wampyr Daoloth of Necromantia) and a session musician known only as Panayiotis (on &quot;A Dead Poem&quot;).

The band members from the beginning, up to &quot;Triarchy of the Lost Lovers&quot; album, were using the pseudonyms Necromayhem for Sakis, Necrosauron for Themis and Mutilator for Jim (Dimitris). George Zaharopoulos used the pseudonym Morbid for early EP and split-LP releases up to &quot;Passage to Arcturo&quot;, and the pseudonym Magus Wampyr Daoloth for &quot;Thy Mighty Contract&quot; and &quot;Non Serviam&quot;.

== Publicity ==
Over the years, the group has faced controversy due to their name and gained international media attention in November 1999 during the 2000 United States Presidential Primaries for Republican Nomination, when candidate/Christian conservative Gary Bauer accused the band of being &quot;anti-Catholic&quot;, among other things. In response to Bauer&#x27;s criticism, Sakis Tolis wrote:

They also have had to cancel some shows, most recently in May 2005, when Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine threatened to refuse to play at a Greek concert if Rotting Christ were on the bill.

In response to their forced cancellation, Tolis noted:

Nuclear Assault and former Anthrax bassist Dan Lilker defended Rotting Christ and criticized Dave Mustaine&#x27;s actions, as did Nevermore&#x27;s Warrel Dane, whose bands appeared on Mustaine&#x27;s Gigantour in 2005. Dane added:

When playing in Malta, a country which in its constitution declares itself as Roman Catholic, trouble from the Church and other Catholic groups ensued when an unknown person stuck a Rotting Christ flyer to a church door. The band was allowed to play eventually even though they had to change venue.

In April 2018, Rotting Christ were scheduled to play in Georgia. Upon arriving in Tbilisi, founding members Sakis and Themis Tolis were arrested by Georgian authorities under suspicion of terrorism due to their band name, as reported by an announcement from the band&#x27;s label, Season of Mist. They had their passports and cell phones confiscated and were detained in prison, without being permitted legal representation or contact with the Greek Embassy for 12 hours. Afterwards, they were informed by their lawyers that the two were included in a &quot;list of unwanted people for reasons of national security&quot; that labeled them as &quot;Satanists&quot; and &quot;suspects of terrorism&quot;. The two were eventually released, after arrangements made by the band&#x27;s other members in collaboration with the local promoter, &quot;who involved legal experts, journalists and activists in Georgia&quot;. The band was allowed to perform their scheduled concert and left for their next destination, Armenia, without hassle.

A species of prehistoric brittle star, &quot;Brezinacantha tolis&quot;, was named after the Tolis brothers.

== Musical style ==
Early in their career, they were responsible for creating what is known as the &quot;classic&quot; Greek black metal sound which can be heard in other bands such as Varathron and Thou Art Lord. Despite the name, the band&#x27;s traditional lyrical themes involving evil and occultism has evolved into a more &quot;mystic&quot; path, and they have modified their musical direction on each album, utilizing elements such as clean melodic baritone vocals, doom, gothic metal and industrial music traits, and male/female Benedictine chants. Recent albums, beginning with &quot;Khronos&quot;, have shown the band taking a more modern, faster and more aggressive approach to their blackened-gothic style. Their 2007 album, &quot;Theogonia&quot;, especially, has been described as more &quot;atmospheric&quot; and &quot;epic&quot; by their label.

The group&#x27;s choice of producers, engineers and mixers has also been varied; Swedish extreme metal figures Dan Swanö (Unisound), Peter Tägtgren (Abyss Studios) and Fredrik Nordström (Studio Fredman), German producers Andy Classen (Asphyx, Belphegor), Siggi Bemm (Therion, Theatre of Tragedy) and Waldemar Sorychta (Lacuna Coil, The Gathering) as well as Xy (Samael percussionist/keyboardist) have all contributed to production on the band&#x27;s albums.

<text>1News is the news division of New Zealand television network TVNZ. The programme is broadcast live from TVNZ Centre in Auckland. The flagship news bulletin is the nightly 6 pm news hour, but 1News also has late night news bulletins, as well as current affairs shows such as &quot;Breakfast&quot; and &quot;Seven Sharp&quot;.

The 6 pm programme is New Zealand&#x27;s most-watched news programme. As of July 2008, it had a market share of 44% (651,400+ each night).

TVNZ&#x27;s Executive Editor, News and Current Affairs (formerly known as Head of News and Current Affairs) is Phil O&#x27;Sullivan. O&#x27;Sullivan had previously been in the role in an acting capacity since June 2022. His predecessors include John Gillespie who departed TVNZ in 2020, and Paul Yurisich who was appointed to the role of Head of News and Current Affairs until he resigned from TVNZ in 2022 after a review into the hiring of former Al Jazeera presenter Kamahl Santamaria.

1News was awarded Best News in the Qantas Media Awards from 2008 through 2011 and won Best Breaking News in the New Zealand Film and Television Awards 2012.

==History==
Television news in New Zealand started in 1960 with the introduction of television. These bulletins were broadcast from New Zealand&#x27;s four main cities (Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin) operating independently of each other due to technical constraints. The &quot;Wahine&quot; disaster in April 1968 highlighted the need for a nationwide news network; footage shot in Wellington could not be broadcast in other centres around the country at the same time, and the extra-tropical cyclone which contributed to the disaster also grounded air traffic preventing the film being flown to other centres.

In October 1969 the nationwide TV network was completed. The first network news broadcast was live on 3 November 1969 at 7:35pm, read by Dougal Stevenson. This bulletin was possible due to microwave links being established between the four main centres; the programme was called the &quot;NZBC Network News&quot;. Initially, it was read by Philip Sherry, Dougal Stevenson or Bill Toft on a rotating roster.

Prior to the building of the Warkworth satellite communications station in 1971, international programmes could not be received live – the footage had to be flown into New Zealand and was often days old.

The &quot;NZBC Network News&quot; featured many other newsreaders until the NZBC was dissolved in 1975. The programme was then renamed as simply &quot;News&quot;.

While the NZBC began broadcasting in colour on 31 October 1973, &quot;Network News&quot; continued to primarily broadcast in black-and-white until the NZBC was dissolved on 31 March 1975. This was to avoid refitting the Wellington studio in Waring Taylor Street with colour equipment while awaiting the move to the new purpose-built Avalon television centre.

===TV One and TV2/South Pacific Television (SPTV) era (1975–80)===
TV One began broadcasting on 1 April 1975 and moved its evening news bulletin to 6:30 pm, with Dougal Stevenson or Bill McCarthy reading the news on a rotating roster until 15 February 1980. The launch of TV One also coincided with the opening of the Avalon television centre, allowing the news to broadcast primarily in colour.

TV2 followed suit on 30 June 1975 and its main evening news was initially broadcast at 7 pm before moving to the earlier timeslot of 6 pm by the end of 1975. Jennie Goodwin was the first female newsreader in New Zealand to anchor a nightly television news programme, although Angela D&#x27;Audney was the first two years earlier. TV2 was rebranded as South Pacific Television in December 1976 to distinguish itself from the former NZBC channel and within the next year, its main evening news was read by Tom Bradley and Philip Sherry (later replaced by John Hawkesby) until South Pacific Television ceased transmission on 15 February 1980.

===TVNZ era (1980–present)===
TV One and South Pacific Television were amalgamated into Television New Zealand on 16 February 1980 and its main evening news continued to broadcast at 6:30 pm on TV One. From 31 March 1980, four regional news programmes were broadcast – one in each of the four main regions: &quot;Top Half&quot; (Auckland and the upper North Island), &quot;Today Tonight&quot; (Wellington and the lower North Island and originally the upper South Island), &quot;The Mainland Touch&quot; (Christchurch, Canterbury and later the upper South Island) and &quot;7:30 South&quot; (Dunedin, Otago and Southland). Initially, these programmes aired at 7:30 pm and ran for half an hour in duration.

In February 1982, the main bulletin was revamped and broadcast from 6:30-7:30 pm; the one-hour package incorporated the day&#x27;s national and international news, regional news programmes and the weather forecast. At the same time, Dunedin&#x27;s &quot;7:30 South&quot; was rebranded as &quot;The South Tonight&quot; and TVNZ introduced a feature segment called &quot;Nationwide&quot;; it contained regional items of national interest, as well as &quot;sidebars&quot; – items which, for example, focused on the human interest element of an event outlined in the network news.

In late 1983, &quot;Nationwide&quot; was dropped, with the main bulletin extended to fill the time and give greater sports news coverage.

During the mid-1980s, Philip Sherry and Tom Bradley shared the role of newsreader on a rotating roster with Richard Long and Tony Ciprian alternately presenting sports news. Weather was presented on alternate nights by Veronica Allum and Sue Scott.

The main bulletin was revamped in November 1986 and renamed as the &quot;Network News&quot;, with Judy Bailey and Neil Billington initially co-presenting in a double-headed format and replacing Philip Sherry. Tom Bradley moved to weekends, where he alternated with Angela D&#x27;Audney as weekend anchor.

In February 1988, sports anchor Richard Long took over from Neil Billington as co-anchor of the &quot;Network News&quot;, the beginning of a partnership that would continue for much of the next 15 years. Tony Ciprian moved to the new commercial network TV3, the network&#x27;s first sports producer. He was with &quot;3 News&quot; for almost 20 years.

In July 1988, the &quot;Network News&quot; was moved to 6 pm and renamed as the &quot;Network News at Six&quot; but the weekend bulletin remained at 6:30 pm (as the &quot;Network News and Sport&quot;). The moving of the &quot;Network News&quot; to 6 pm also marked the introduction of computer-generated weather graphics and the arrival of Jim Hickey and Penelope Barr, who replaced Veronica Allum and Sue Scott as weather presenters.

On 3 April 1989 TVNZ launched a new nightly current affairs programme, &quot;Holmes&quot;, which was presented by Paul Holmes. &quot;Holmes&quot; began screening at 6:30 pm. At the same time, the duration of the &quot;Network News at Six&quot; was reduced back to 30 minutes and the regional news programmes were transferred to around 5:45 pm on TV2. The year saw the introduction of TVNZ&#x27;s first foreign correspondents – Liam Jeory in London and Susan Wood in Sydney.

In October 1989, the weekend &quot;Network News and Sport&quot; was moved from 6:30 pm to 6 pm.

In November 1989, the &quot;Network News&quot; was relaunched as &quot;One Network News&quot;; its renaming due to competition from new broadcasting station TV3&#x27;s news programme &quot;3 National News&quot;.

In December 1989, both &quot;Top Half&quot; and &quot;Today Tonight&quot; were axed by TVNZ but &quot;The Mainland Touch&quot; and &quot;The South Tonight&quot; continued for another year and screened on TV One at 5:45 pm as a lead-in to &quot;One Network News&quot; at 6 pm, with support from NZ On Air. The Christchurch and Dunedin based regional news programmes were axed at the end of 1990.

In February 1995, the main bulletin was again extended from 30 minutes to a full hour, screening from the now familiar 6 pm timeslot, followed by &quot;Holmes&quot; at 7 pm. The change coincided with the unveiling of a new studio set which was used until 2003. On 2 January 1995, the main &quot;One Network News&quot; bulletin was delayed for 10 minutes after protesters occupied the studio and protested about the Māori language bulletin &quot;Te Karere&quot; which was off air over the Christmas and New Year period.

July 1997 saw the replacement of weekend news presenters Angela D&#x27;Audney and Tom Bradley with husband and wife Simon Dallow and Alison Mau. Bradley resigned, but D&#x27;Audney stayed as a backup presenter for other bulletins until her death in 2002.

On 11 August 1997, the early morning &quot;Telstra Business&quot; and &quot;Breakfast&quot; shows were first aired; Telstra Business was hosted by Michael Wilson; Breakfast hosted by Susan Wood and Mike Hosking.

In 1998, TVNZ signed &quot;3 National News&quot; anchor John Hawkesby to replace Richard Long from the start of 1999. But when Haweskby began presenting &quot;One Network News&quot; at 6 pm alongside Judy Bailey, there was a public outcry over the separation of Bailey and Long, that lead to Long reinstated as co-anchor at 6 pm three weeks later. Hawkes&#x27;bay later took TVNZ to court, a dispute that he subsequently won.

The programme was renamed again on 31 December 1999 to &quot;One News&quot;.

On 19 March 2000, TVNZ launched its first digital initiative nzoom.co.nz. Staffed by 20 journalists, nzoom included news, sports, entertainment and home and garden sections, in additional to being a web portal. The website was closed in 2003, and replaced by a more basic offering that was designed to extend television programming. At the time of its closure, it ranked second amongst local online news providers - behind the New Zealand Herald and ahead of Stuff.

2003 saw a major shake up of TVNZ&#x27;s news and current affairs programming with entering head Bill Ralston making sweeping changes to the formats of many programmes. A new state-of-the-art studio came into use for &quot;One News&quot; programmes, but many presenters were culled. The changes saw the end of Long and Bailey&#x27;s 15-year partnership; from January 2004, the main 6 pm bulletin reverted to a single-headed broadcast with Judy Bailey as anchor. Jim Hickey, TVNZ&#x27;s most popular weather presenter, and sports presenter April Bruce (née Ieremia) also left in 2003. Hickey returned to &quot;One News&quot; in 2007.

&quot;Close Up&quot; was launched in November 2004, when Paul Holmes, host of the &quot;Holmes&quot; programme, resigned following failed contract negotiations. &quot;Close Up&quot; followed the same format as &quot;Holmes&quot;, but was hosted by Susan Wood until her sudden resignation in 2006. Mark Sainsbury became the main host following her resignation.

In October 2005, TVNZ announced that it would not be renewing long-standing flagship broadcaster Judy Bailey&#x27;s contract; some observers believe this was a direct reaction to the programme&#x27;s market share decline in Auckland to &quot;3 News&quot;. An emotional Bailey signed off for the final time at the end of the 6 pm &quot;One News&quot; bulletin on 23 December 2005. She was TVNZ&#x27;s longest serving newsreader and had been reporting and presenting with both NZBC and TVNZ for 34 years. When the 6 pm edition of &quot;One News&quot; returned after the Christmas break of 2005–2006, it reverted to double-headed presentation with Wendy Petrie and Simon Dallow taking over from Bailey. The weekend 6 pm bulletin remained single-headed until September 2008, when popular presenter Peter Williams joined Bernadine Oliver-Kerby as co-anchor.

In December 2008, One News relaunched online news product under the TVNZ.co.nz domain. The broadcaster said it was &quot;upping the ante&quot; for digital offerings.

Sir Paul Holmes returned to TVNZ as the host on the new political programme &quot;Q+A&quot; in 2009. He hosted the programme until late 2012, when illness prevented him from continuing his duties. He died on 1 February 2013.

On 3 November 2009, TVNZ celebrated One News&#x27; 40th birthday with some archival footage available on their website. Later that year, Jennie Goodwin, David Beatson, Dougal Stevenson and Lindsay Perigo returned to read one &quot;Breakfast&quot; news segment each.

A Saturday edition of &quot;Breakfast&quot;, called &quot;Saturday Breakfast&quot;, was broadcast from 3 September 2011, hosted by Rawdon Christie and Toni Street, and ran until the end of 2012, when it and &quot;One News at 4:30&quot; were cancelled for financial reasons.

In September 2012 an announcement was made that TVNZ would discontinue &quot;Close Up&quot; at the end of 2012. The final &quot;Close Up&quot; programme screened on 30 November 2012 and in early 2013, an announcement was made of the replacement show, named &quot;Seven Sharp&quot;. The first show screened on 4 February 2013.

Former BBC meteorologist Daniel Corbett joined the weather team in September 2014. In December 2014, Jim Hickey left his position as head weather forecaster. Nearly a year later Karen Olsen left the weathercaster position, making her final broadcast on 16 November 2015.

In July 2015, TVNZ rebranded its news website to One News Now, focused specifically on breaking news and video content. The change was expected to double the website&#x27;s number of video views. Some changes were criticised for an apparent pivot towards &quot;clickbait&quot;. In May 2016, TVNZ began syndicating news video with Stuff.

One News programmes were renamed 1News in 2016, when TV One was renamed TVNZ 1.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand as part of cost-cutting measures, 1News reverted to a single news presenter for its 6 pm bulletin. Simon Dallow remained as the sole newsreader while Wendy Petrie lost her role. Petrie would remain at TVNZ as a backup presenter across other 1News programmes.

In late July 2023, 1News revamped its intro and banner, by changing the colour from blue to black, and moving the name and job to the left side.

In early March 2024, TVNZ proposed ending several television programmes including &quot;1News at Midday&quot; and &quot;1News Tonight&quot; due to a decline in advertisement revenue and competition from digital competitors such as Netflix and YouTube. In addition, TVNZ has proposed 68 job cuts, amounting to about 9 percent of its staff. On 9 April, TVNZ confirmed that 1News&#x27; Midday and late night bulletins would be axed by mid-May 2024. Midday broadcast its final bulletin on Friday 3 May 2024, hosted by Indira Stewart.

On 7 October 2024, TVNZ&#x27;s management proposed closing down 1News&#x27; website by February 2025 as part of a NZ$30 million cost-saving measure. On 29 October, TVNZ abandoned plans to shut down its 1News website but proposed expanding the news content of its TVNZ+ streaming service.

<text>Bad Langensalza (; until 1956: Langensalza) is a spa town of 17,500 inhabitants in the Unstrut-Hainich district, Thuringia, central Germany.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
Bad Langensalza is located in the Thuringian Basin, the fertile lowlands along the Unstrut river. The river Salza flows through the town and joins the Unstrut about east of the town. Bad Langensalza lies in an unwooded, intensively farmed and largely flat landscape that rises to the west to the Hainich, to the north to the &quot;Heilinger Höhen&quot; (Heilinger Heights) and to the southeast to the &quot;Fahner Höhen&quot; (Fahner Heights). Due to this location, the climate in Bad Langensalza is relatively mild and, with annual precipitation of about , very dry.

The town itself is divided into the relatively large old town centre, which is bounded by the historical town wall, and several areas of urban expansion dating from 1850 onwards. Initially, the town expanded southwards and south-eastwards towards the railway station. This is also where the first industrial areas were built. This was followed by expansion to the southwest, where the village of Ufhoven is located, which has since been incorporated into the core town. Since 1950, Bad Langensalza has expanded mainly to the north, where several residential and commercial areas have been built. Municipal reforms since the early 1990s have greatly enlarged the administrative urban area, which now stretches from the forests of the Hainich National Park to the eastern side of the Unstrut river.

=== Neighbouring towns ===
Neighbouring towns of Bad Langensalza are Mühlhausen, northwest, Eisenach, southwest, Gotha, south, Erfurt, southeast, Sömmerda, east and Sondershausen, northeast. Neighbouring municipalities are (clockwise, starting in the west): Schönstedt, Unstrut-Hainich, Nottertal-Heilinger Höhen, Kirchheilingen, Sundhausen, Tottleben, Urleben and Großvargula in the Unstrut-Hainich district, Tonna and Nessetal in the Gotha district and Hörselberg-Hainich in the Wartburg district.

=== Administrative division ===
Bad Langensalza is divided into a total of 15 quarters (including the core town):

==History==
The town was first mentioned in historical records , as a village named &quot;Salzaha&quot;. The town&#x27;s name was changed to Langensalza , and &quot;Bad&quot; (&quot;Spa&quot;) added to the name in 1956.

In 1075, Langensalza was the site of a battle, in which Emperor Henry IV won over the rebelling Saxons and Thuringians.

The town was plundered and damaged by fires during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (c. 1632). Fires again destroyed large parts of the town in 1711, including complete destruction of the town hall, which was rebuilt between 1742 and 1752.

War again affected the town between 1756 and 1763, during the Seven Years&#x27; War; it was the scene of a battle in February 1761. In 1815 Langensalza became part of the Prussian Province of Saxony.

In 1866 it was again the site of a battle between Prussia and Hanover during the Austro-Prussian War. This Battle of Langensalza is famous for being the last time intra-German forces have met in combat.

On April 5, 1945, Langensalza was occupied by American troops and handed over to the Red Army in early July. It became part of the Soviet (Russian) occupation zone and, from 1949 to 1990, was part of the German Democratic Republic.

Langensalza is a popular tourist destination, with a well-preserved medieval old town, a number of themed public gardens and a thermal spa bath. In 2011 it won the title &quot;Most blooming town in Europe&quot; as part of the Europe-wide horticultural competition &quot;Entente Florale&quot;.

Sulphur springs were discovered in 1811 and opened to the public as a curative bath in 1812. A new version of the public sulphur bath was opened in 1928. Salt and mineral water springs were discovered in 1996, which prompted the opening of many new curative facilities. Today a modern thermal bath attracts many visitors.

Bad Langensalza contains a Botanical Garden, along with a Rose Garden, a Magnolia Garden and an Arboretum. It is one of the few European towns with an authentic Japanese Garden. Bad Langensalza is also close to the Hainich National Park, Germany&#x27;s oldest deciduous forest.

Every August, the town hosts a Middle Ages Festival (&quot;Mittelalterstadtfest&quot;) where townsfolk don traditional dress from the middle ages and visitors can experience medieval crafts, handwork, martial arts, food and music.

The town is on the German Timber-Frame Road (&quot;Fachwerkstraße&quot;) and is notable for the number of well-preserved medieval half-timbered (&quot;Fachwerk&quot;) houses.

Travertine stone has been mined in the town since medieval times, and is still carved there today. It forms the distinctive white stonework of the old town. Travertine from Langensalza was used in the building of the Brandenburg Gate and in one of the most famous works of modern architecture, the Barcelona Pavilion.

==Cultural==

The then Augustinian friar Martin Luther visited Langensalza&#x27;s (still preserved) Augustinian Cloister in 1516 in his role as District Vicar. As a result, the town is now on the Luther Trail. The poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock lived in Langensalza between 1748 and 1750, where he composed some of his most famous odes. His sumptuous house is still standing in the Salzstraße. The poet Novalis lived for a time in Langensalza in 1796 whilst studying chemistry under Johann Christian Wiegleb at his house in the Markstraße. Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, the most eminent German physician of the 19th Century, was born in Langensalza. He is buried in the famous Dorotheenstadt Cemetery in Berlin.

<text>n-tv (styled ntv) is a German free-to-air television news channel owned by RTL Deutschland. n-tv broadcasts news and weather every hour and half-hour in the morning. It also broadcasts magazine shows and documentaries.

== History ==
n-tv began as a business development project at Time Warner International which, under the leadership of then-chairman Steve Ross, was looking for ways to grow its businesses internationally. Time Warner at the time was a major shareholder in Turner Broadcasting System, parent company of CNN (both now part of Warner Bros. Discovery), and began looking for ways to get into the news channel business internationally. In 1991, under the direction of Tom McGrath, the then-president of Time-Warner International Broadcasting, the company developed a strategy for Austria, Germany, and the German-speaking areas of Switzerland.

One of McGrath&#x27;s pet projects was a German-language 24-hour news channel. McGrath secured the last available transponder on the Kopernikus satellite and secured several terrestrial television licenses for transmission of what would become n-tv. McGrath then recruited several German companies including the Otto Group and Apax Partners as partners, and recruited Karl Kuhlo, an experienced German broadcaster, as the CEO.

The station started broadcasting on 30 November 1992, headquartered in Berlin. In doing so, it became the first German-language news channel. In 1994, CNN bought 27.5% of the company, and later increased its share to 50%.

In 2004, the station&#x27;s headquarters were moved to Cologne, where other RTL stations are based.

RTL Group took full control of n-tv in 2006, having acquired half the company in 2002.

In September 2010, n-tv moved to the &quot;Rheinhallen&quot; media center in Cologne-Deutz, where all of RTL&#x27;s TV operations in Germany are based.

n-tv gained a new visual identity, a new logo and graphics package from 1 September 2017. Another sister channel, RTL was also rebranded.

==Logos==
== Programming ==
n-tv broadcasts news, business and talk shows. The channel broadcasts news from Monday to Friday on the hour. In the morning every half-hour (between 7 and 9 o&#x27;clock every 15 minutes). At weekends, the channel broadcasts news every hour. After 8 pm, n-tv broadcasts 15 minute news bulletins, focused on business news.

The channel also broadcasts documentaries and magazine shows focused on sport and lifestyle. A ticker at the bottom of the screen shows news, business and sports headlines as well as weather and stock market information.

== Wall Street coverage ==
Several correspondents report live from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ and the New York Mercantile Exchange, including Jens Korte, Lars Halter, and Markus Koch.

<text>James Roy Newman (1907–1966) was an American mathematician and mathematical historian. He was also a lawyer, practicing in the state of New York from 1929 to 1941. During and after World War II, he held several positions in the United States government, including Chief Intelligence Officer at the US Embassy in London, Special Assistant to the Undersecretary of War, and Counsel to the US Senate Committee on Atomic Energy. In the latter capacity, he helped to draft the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. He became a member of the board of editors for &quot;Scientific American&quot; beginning in 1948. He is also credited for first publishing the mathematical term &quot;googol&quot; in his book &quot;Mathematics and The Imagination&quot;, co-authored with Edward Kasner.

== Author ==
In 1940 Newman and Edward Kasner wrote &quot;Mathematics and the Imagination&quot;, in which they reported the mathematical idea of a very large but finite number, called a &quot;googol&quot;, consisting of 1 followed by 100 zeroes, and a larger number called a &quot;googolplex&quot;. In 1942 Newman wrote &quot;The Tools of War&quot;, which was an illustrated examination of warfare. In 1948 he published &quot;The control of atomic energy&quot;. In 1955 he wrote &quot;What is Science&quot;.

In 1956 Newman published &quot;The World of Mathematics&quot;, a four-volume library on the literature of mathematics from A&#x27;h-mosé the Scribe to Albert Einstein, presented with commentaries and notes (1956). The four volumes cover many branches of mathematics and represent a 15-year effort by Newman to collect what he felt were the most important essays in the field. With essays ranging from a biography of Srinivasa Ramanujan by Newman to Bertrand Russell&#x27;s &quot;Definition of Number&quot;, the series is often praised as suitable for any level of mathematical maturity. The series has been reprinted several times by various publishers.

Newman also wrote &quot;Gödel&#x27;s Proof&quot; (1958) with Ernest Nagel, presenting the main results of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem and the mathematical work and philosophies leading up to its discovery in a more accessible manner. This book inspired Douglas Hofstadter to take up the study of mathematical logic, write his famous book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;, and prepare a second edition of &quot;Gödel&#x27;s Proof&quot;, published in 2002.

<text>Augustin Mouet, sieur de Langlade, (with a number of name variations) (1703 – 1771), was born in Trois-Rivières, Quebec. He was the son of Pierre Mouet, sieur de Moras.

Augustin obtained a fur trading license at Michilimackinac in 1728. That year he married Domitilde, a widow with six children, who was the daughter of an Odawa chief and the sister to another. This strengthened his standing in the area. He was largely responsible for the establishment of the fur trading outpost that became Green Bay, Wisconsin. In 1728 he also fought in the Fox Wars together with François-Marie Le Marchand de Lignery.

Augustin was a Canadian fur trader in that region. His son, Charles Michel de Langlade, was also involved in fur trading, and was a leader in the French and Indian Wars.

<text>Margrete Helle Auken (born 6 January 1945) is a Danish politician who served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 2004 to 2024. She is a member of the Socialistisk Folkeparti, part of the European Green Party. She was also formerly a Member of the Folketing.

Auken was educated at the University of Copenhagen and is a &quot;sognepræst&quot; (parish priest) at the Frederiksberg Church in the Church of Denmark.

==Political career==
Auken was a member of the Danish parliament from October 1979 to December 1990 and from September 1994 to June 2004.

When she was elected as the sole candidate for SF for the European Parliament in 2004 Auken sparked an uproar in SF by choosing to join the European Green Party – European Free Alliance instead of the European United Left – Nordic Green League without the approval of SF.

In parliament, Auken served on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety from 2014. She had previously been a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism (2004-2007), the Committee on Development (2005-2009). In 2007 she also joined the Committee on Petitions.

In addition to her committee assignments, Auken was a member of the delegation for relations with Palestine. She is also part of the European Parliament Intergroup on the Welfare and Conservation of Animals and the European Parliament Intergroup on Seas, Rivers, Islands and Coastal Areas.

Auken was re-elected in 2019.

==Personal life==
Auken&#x27;s brother is Svend Auken. She has three children. Her daughter Ida Auken is also a priest and politician, though since 2014 she has been a member of the Danish Social Liberal Party, unlike her mother. The younger Auken was Minister of the Environment in the Cabinet of Helle Thorning-Schmidt I.

<text>Hana Gartner CM is a retired Canadian investigative journalist who is best known as the host and interviewer of several programs for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

==Early life and education==

Gartner was born in 1948 in Prague, Czechoslovakia, but grew up in Chomedey, Laval, Quebec. She studied at Loyola College (now Concordia University), in Montreal, and graduated &quot;cum laude&quot;.

==Career==

Gartner began her career as a radio host at Montreal&#x27;s CJAD in 1970.

In 1974, she joined the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a TV news anchor at CBMT Montreal. She moved to Toronto the following year to work on the program &quot;In Good Company&quot;, alongside Roger Abbott, Don Ferguson, Nancy White, and Gene DiNovi.

Gartner became the host of CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;This Country in the Morning&quot; and replaced Judy LaMarsh in 1976. The following year, she moved back to television as a co-host of both the CBC&#x27;s local newscast at CBLT in Toronto and the network&#x27;s afternoon public affairs program &quot;Take 30&quot;. (Previous hosts of &quot;Take 30&quot; had included Mary Lou Finlay, Moses Znaimer, and Adrienne Clarkson.)

In 1982, Gartner became co-host of the CBC&#x27;s primetime TV newsmagazine, &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot;. In 1992, she worked alongside Julian Sher and Daniel Burke in exposing Inspector Claude Savoie of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as corrupt. In her interviews with Savoie, she asked him questions about his business relationships with the shady lawyer Sidney Leithman and the gangster Allan &quot;the Weasel&quot; Ross. Savoie told her that he had last seen Ross in May 1992 and that: &quot;He [Ross] wasn&#x27;t an informant, nor was I an informant for him. But I knew him. Put it that way. I met him&quot;. The scandal ended with Savoie committing suicide in his office at the RCMP&#x27;s national headquarters in Ottawa. Gartner stated that she was in shock at the time as she recalled: “We were both like whirling dervishes. No story is worth anybody offing himself.&quot;

In 1995, she replaced Pamela Wallin as co-host with Peter Mansbridge of CBC&#x27;s flagship newshour, &quot;Prime Time News&quot;, as it returned to 10 p.m. and reverted to its previous name, &quot;The National&quot;. Gartner hosted the &quot;National Magazine&quot; portion of the programme, which has interviews, extended features, and documentaries and was the second half of the hour, following Mansbridge&#x27;s newscast.

Gartner left &quot;The National&quot;, returned to &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; in 2000, and remained with the programme for 11 years.

On May 11, 2011, Gartner announced her retirement from the CBC.

==Awards==

Gartner has won five Gemini Awards and has been nominated 18 times in the Gemini hosting, anchoring, and interviewing categories during her career. She has also twice won the special Gemini Gordon Sinclair Award for excellence in broadcast journalism: in 1985 and in 2006. In 2011, she was awarded a Michener Award for her story about a troubled teen who died while in the Ontario corrections system.

In 2019, she was appointed as a Member of the Order of Canada.

<doc id="887521" wikidata="Q753524" url="?curid=887521" title="BitComet">
<text>BitComet (originally named SimpleBT client from versions 0.11 to 0.37) is a cross-protocol BitTorrent, HTTP and FTP client written in C++ for Microsoft Windows and available in 52 different languages. Its first public release was version 0.28. The current BitComet logo has been used since version 0.50.

== Features ==
The BitComet program is a multi-threaded multi-protocol hybrid download manager and BitTorrent peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing application. It supports simultaneous download tasks. To complete a particular download, it can draw parts of files from many sources across different P2P and client–server protocols.

BitComet&#x27;s main features include an embedded Internet Explorer window to let users search for torrents. Along with the features typical of contemporary BitTorrent clients, it supports UPnP gateway configuration, bandwidth scheduling, Webseeding, selecting only certain files for download inside a torrent package, NAT traversal (&quot;removed in v.1.03&quot;), Peer Exchange (&quot;in older versions, using a proprietary protocol and starting with v.1.19 also by using the Extension Protocol, implementing a PEX mechanism compatible with μTorrent / Mainline PEX&quot;), Initial-Seeding (Super-Seeding) and support for Magnet Links.

When downloading, BitComet provides the option to prioritize the first and last portions of media files so that files may be previewed before they are completely downloaded.It also has a &quot;Preview Download Mode&quot; in which all pieces of the torrent will be, basically, downloaded sequentially thus allowing the user to play a media file while downloading (provided that the downloading speed and piece availability stay ahead of playing bitrate).BitComet also allows users to share their .torrent files, on a searchable P2P network, with other BitComet users through the torrent sharing feature, named &quot;Torrent Share&quot; in previous versions and renamed to &quot;Torrent Exchange&quot; since v.1.17. BitComet uses the Kademlia (mainline) DHT to operate even when the tracker is offline. BitComet is capable of downloading files over HTTP and FTP as well as bittorrent, and it includes download plugins for Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Maxthon.

An optional plugin is available to connect to the eD2K network. The plugin is a modified version of the GPL eMule program. When installed, it connects automatically to a server.
The software includes an application to play Flash Video files (.flv and .swf files).

In February 2011, BitComet launched an anonymous downloading feature to its VIP customers. Using this feature, downloads will be handled by BitComet VIP servers and the real IP address of the user will be hidden.

=== Optional standalone software ===
BitComet.com offers a BitTorrent tracker available for download from the official site. The FLV player program can also be downloaded separately and used independently of the BitComet software.

==== Search engine ====
The search site is google.atcomet.com

== Controversy and criticism ==
=== Hash reporting ===
Since version 0.86 BitComet includes discussion and stat-tracking features which send information about torrents to the Bitcomet.com servers, including the torrent hash.

=== DHT exploit ===
During version 0.60, BitComet received bad publicity because its implementation of the DHT feature, which was new at the time, could be exploited to ignore the private flag of a tracker. This allowed users to avoid download and upload ratio restrictions, which are common on private trackers. Some private trackers responded to this by blacklisting version 0.60. BitComet developer RnySmile reverted the client back to version 0.59 in response to the blacklisting.

The DHT exploit was fixed in version 0.61.

=== Padding files ===
Starting with version 0.85 (from early 2007), BitComet added a non-standard option to its torrent maker that ensures that no two data files in a multi-file torrent occupy the same BitTorrent &quot;piece.&quot; To accomplish this, BitComet includes in the torrent a collection of empty &quot;padding&quot; files which houses the remainder of each file&#x27;s last &quot;piece&quot;. While these files are transparent to BitComet users, they damage the performance of other clients, because peers must devote resources and bandwidth to the padding files, with no benefit to the non-BitComet users. These files can constitute up to 10% of the total data transferred, creating a substantial drain on the swarm. BitComet developers added this feature to allow support of a feature called Long-Term Seeding in which the BitComet client can download files from other BitComet clients who have an identical file but not from the same torrent. It also allows the downloading of individual files from other non torrent sources like ED2K links. The addition of the padding file ensures that a complete version of the file can be obtained rather than being unable to complete the relevant file or last &quot;piece&quot; 

Creation of padding files has been enabled by default since version 0.85, and as of version 1.36 is still enabled by default.

=== FileHippo controversy ===

The download site FileHippo ceased carrying new versions of BitComet in April 2008, with this announcement.
As of April 2008 FileHippo will no longer be updating BitComet. As they have copied the FileHippo site text, files, images and update checker and are passing it off as original work. We recommend you use a different more reputable torrent client such as uTorrent.
This occurred after FileHippo reportedly noticed that the design and code of the AppHit.com site was very similar with the one FileHippo used, copying not only icons, but text from FileHippo&#x27;s website and FileHippo&#x27;s own original update checking software.

Because AppHit and BitComet were contractual partners, FileHippo decided to stop carrying BitComet. BitComet has since terminated the partnership, by 2015 FileHippo made BitComet available once more.

=== Torrent file format ===
According to the official BitTorrent specification, &#x27;All strings in a .torrent file that contains text must be UTF-8 encoded&#x27;. When generating torrents on non-Latin character systems such as Chinese or Japanese, BitComet versions prior to 1.20 encoded the files&#x27; names and paths using the Windows Chinese/Japanese code page, and stored a UTF-8 version in a non-standard attribute. Starting with the March 2010 release of version 1.20, BitComet&#x27;s torrent format now conforms to the standard.

<doc id="887527" wikidata="Q5094524" url="?curid=887527" title="Chewin' the Fat">
<text>Chewin&#x27; the Fat is a Scottish comedy sketch show, starring Ford Kiernan, Greg Hemphill and Karen Dunbar. Comedians Paul Riley and Mark Cox also appeared regularly on the show among other actors such as Tom Urie.

&quot;Chewin&#x27; the Fat&quot; first started as a radio series on BBC Radio Scotland. The later television show, which ran for four series, was first broadcast on BBC One Scotland, but series three and four, as well as highlights from the first two series, were later broadcast nationally across the United Kingdom. Although the last series ended in February 2002, a Hogmanay special was broadcast each New Year&#x27;s Eve between 2000 and 2005. &quot;Chewin&#x27; the Fat&quot; gave rise to the successful, and cult spin-off show &quot;Still Game&quot;, a sitcom focusing on the two elderly friends, Jack and Victor. The series was mostly filmed in and around Glasgow and occasionally West Dunbartonshire.

The English idiom &quot;to chew the fat&quot; means to chat casually, but thoroughly, about subjects of mutual interest.

== Recurring characters and sketches ==
; Alistair (Hemphill) and Rory (Kiernan): Two eccentric documentary presenters from the Scottish Highlands, fascinated with Scottish history and landscapes. They are constantly harassed by two neds, who often play practical jokes on the pair or taunt them, shouting: &quot;ya couple o&#x27; fannies!&quot; The pranks vary from childish tricks (such as putting glue on the receiver of &quot;Britain&#x27;s most northerly phone box,&quot; which promptly sticks to Alistair&#x27;s beard) to potentially lethal actions (such as rolling a caber down a mountainside at full tilt towards them); however, the pair of plucky Highlanders always live to present another show. The characters are partly based on the hosts of Scottish history programmes such as &quot;Weir&#x27;s Way&quot;.
; The Big Man (Kiernan): The Big Man is a tough Glaswegian gangster, and a stereotypical representation of an &quot;Alpha Male&quot;, who turns up to solve people&#x27;s problems by means of intense intimidation and violence. Keeping with the &quot;hard man&quot; theme, he has a very deep voice. The character first appeared in a parody of &quot;Scotland Today&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Call The Lawyer&quot; section, in which people having problems could get legal advice. The character was so popular after his first appearance that he appeared in other sketches; his catchphrase being: &quot;Is there a problem here?&quot; The Big Man is frequently hypocritical, usually demanding as payment whatever he had helped his clients receive. However, the people are always very happy to give him whatever he asks for.
; Bish &amp; Bosh: Two very dodgy painter &amp; decorators who usually steal things from the houses they are working at. Their real names are Tony (Kiernan) and Wullie (Hemphill). In the sketches, they are normally seen having a tea break talking about something inconsequential that Wullie drags into depravity, only to be told by Tony, &quot;You&#x27;ve taken that too far&quot;.
; The Banter Boys: Two camp men who are regularly found nearby places where Glaswegian banter is common, taking great relish (and apparently even sexual arousal) experiencing the Glaswegian accent and patter in a variety of situations. This includes hiding out in a football team&#x27;s changing room to hear the coach shouting at the players and taking a taxi ride in a complete circle back to where they got on, paying out with a £100 note for &quot;the banter&quot; they received from the driver. The two characters appear in the form of the stereotypical Kelvinside housewife, with the same pretensions and turns of phrase. Their catchphrase is &quot;we&#x27;re just paying for the banter&quot;. Their real names are James (Hemphill) and Gary (Kiernan). In earlier sketches, they were seen in a tearoom where they discuss various subjects often relating to Glaswegian banter and culture.
; Big Jock (Kiernan): An overbearing, narcissistic golfer who enjoys humiliating his fellow golf club members by making them do such things as retrieving a £50 note from a dustbin, or leaving another £50 note on the bar to see who would be desperate enough to pick it up for themselves. He is typically very loud and likes to make bombastic speeches and has a habit of calling everyone &quot;Percy&quot;, even if it isn&#x27;t their name. He also wins many trophies, and makes sure everyone knows about it.
; The Lighthouse Keepers: Duncan (Hemphill) and Malcolm (Kiernan) are two Highlanders who work in a lighthouse on the fictional west coast island of Aonoch Mor. Their sketches usually featured at the start of the programme. Duncan endures pranks from Malcolm while pleading &quot;Gonnae no dae that?&quot; Malcolm&#x27;s pranks gradually escalated in severity as the series went on, going from simple jokes to excruciating torture of the psyche, including drawing bras and undergarments over the unfortunate man&#x27;s pornography (seemingly his only form of sexual gratification available) and pretending that he has hanged himself. The final sketch ends with the lighthouse being blown up, Duncan&#x27;s trademark &quot;Gonnae no dae that?&quot; phrase being spoken as the unfortunate lighthouse keeper watches Malcolm sail away before the lighthouse explodes. 
; The Lonely Shopkeeper (Karen Dunbar): A bored, friendless woman working in a corner shop who is &quot;stuck in this shop, day after day after day...&quot;, and therefore constantly trying to be over-friendly with her customers, and invariably frightening them off. She often attempts to pry into customers&#x27; personal lives, and comments on their (occasionally embarrassing) purchases. In the final sketch, she had seemingly faked her death to get sympathy of those that attended her wake within the shop.
; The Depressed Taxi Caller (Karen Dunbar): These sketches feature an extremely unlucky woman named Fiona working as a taxi controller, who is always shown crying down her headset to the drivers about her terrible life and how her new boyfriends keep dying in bizarre circumstances. She generally smokes many cigarettes and drinks large volumes of whisky throughout the sketch, in order to &quot;dull the pain.&quot;
; Jack (Kiernan) and Victor (Hemphill): Two OAPs who get up to mischief, featuring the characters that were famously later to appear in the series &quot;Still Game.&quot;
; The Janny (Kiernan): A school janitor who pops up to try and fix everything from broken ankles to broken hearts with a liberal application of sawdust from his bucket. His catchphrase is &quot;Gie that ten minutes an&#x27; it&#x27;ll be as right as rain.&quot;
; The Boy Who Has Just Started Masturbating:A 14-year-old boy called Stephen (played by Gordon McCorkell) who is constantly embarrassed by his parents as they announce proudly to anyone they meet that he has just started masturbating. While other young people around him find this hilarious, most of the adults react by smiling and congratulating Stephen.
; Betty the Auld Slapper (Karen Dunbar): A female OAP, usually seen giving interviews to a &quot;teatime [radio] show&quot; about her memories from during the Second World War. These always end up with Betty describing her (numerous) sexual experiences in detail before being cut off by the show&#x27;s exasperated host (Hemphill). She always sits with her legs spread wide apart, exposing her underwear. 
; The Community Mobile Van: A van that brings various cultural amenities to the car park of a council estate, ranging from things like swimming pools to an art gallery to a theatre. The staff of the van are often harassed by a ned or two walking past. In reality, such vans would contain something like a Mobile Library, or the &quot;Bionic Bus&quot; which councils would send around local estates to keep the children amused.
; Miss Isabelle Gourlay, the Teacher (Karen Dunbar): A highly-strung, seemingly sexually-repressed teacher who gets overly offended by just about anything her class says, who take pleasure in winding her up as a result. Her catchphrase is: &quot; Right, that&#x27;s enough!&quot; Apparently, she was based on a chemistry teacher Karen Dunbar had at her own school.
; Ballistic Bob (Kiernan): A man who attempts to do a normal task, fails multiple times or time takes too long, and ends up trashing the surrounding area in a frustrated rage. He was also featured in two Scottish adverts for broadband where he smashed up an entire office when a file took an infuriatingly long time to download from the Internet and his home study was wrecked when someone he was trying to call wouldn&#x27;t answer the phone.
; The Nightshifters: Two men who try to get some sleep for their night shift, but are always interrupted by too much noise. They follow the noise, and upon finding the culprit(s), the men shout &quot;Haw, we&#x27;re oan the night shift!&quot;. This noise can be anything from a loud football match to pens clicking.
; Gretta (Karen Dunbar):An outgoing female boss who hangs around two reluctant male employees at their desks whilst being obsessed with her moustache.
; Sluich: Two sock puppets from the Scottish Highlands that get up to mischief, such as finding a &quot;package&quot; on the beach, then discovering that it is hash and proceed to produce a Rizla. They speak gibberish that is supposed to sound like Gaelic with English loan words to allow the audience to understand the gist of what they are saying, with their conversations beginning and ending with &quot;oola.&quot; It is a parody of the Gaelic-language children&#x27;s programme &quot;Dòtaman.&quot;
; Mr. Simpson (Kiernan):A man with a whistling lisp, which often gets satirised by other people by having him say a phrase with the pronunciation of the letter &quot;S&quot; strewn throughout, such as his niece and nephew having him read &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot; from the beginning (the sketch begins with him finishing it, on the last sentence where the letter &quot;S&quot; not present.) So he reads it as (lisps are in bold) &quot;Twas the night before christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.&quot;
; The Smoking Family:A family of chain smokers who only spend their money on their incredibly heavy addiction to cigarettes. They have all lost their voices (due to throat cancer) so they have to rely on voice boxes to communicate. One scene includes the young grandson who, wishing to &#x27;have a fag&#x27;, invites the opportunity for grandad to &#x27;grab the camera&#x27; for the boy&#x27;s first ever cigarette.
; The Sewer Workers: Two sewer workers who find strange ways of amusing themselves in the sewer, including playing with faeces.
; Ronald Villiers (Kiernan):The world&#x27;s worst actor, with a gravelly, monotonous voice. Ronald is apparently registered with the agent &quot;Widdecombe &amp; Pump.&quot; When presented with any script or concept, he invariably responds, &quot;Ah can dae that&quot;, but he is incapable of remembering simple lines, often completely misunderstands the directions of the director, and attempts inappropriate ad-libs.
; Gym Teacher (Hemphill): A flatulent gym teacher who demonstrates physical activity to his class, and ends up passing gas from exertion. After this happens, the class laughs at him as he then yells &quot;Simmer down!&quot;
; The Sniffer (Karen Dunbar): A woman who can smell &quot;shite&quot;, often in the form of a scam or a lie, from a distance away. According to her mail, her name is Olive Actory, a play on olfactory.
; The Shoe Sniffer (Hemphill): A man with an extreme fetish for sniffing other people&#x27;s shoes; he usually distracts them and then sniffs them in a surreptitious manner.
; Bob (Hemphill) &amp; Alan (Kiernan): Two overbearing salesmen in an electronics store who frequently try to put their &quot;sales pitch&quot; on expecting customers. They will usually attempt to completely confuse the customer, often using entirely fictional or inappropriate terminology to describe everyday electronics equipment. They also end up insulting the customers by using offensive and overly familiar terms, such as distorting the person&#x27;s own name until it becomes a personal insult towards them.
; Socially Awkward Car salesman: A car salesman (played by Mark Cox) who stands in a group with three other car salesmen (Kiernan, Hemphill, and Paul Riley) that have a laugh with each other by making comments or noises in relation to a subject. When it gets to his turn, he becomes overbearing by making loud noises or gestures, resulting in the other car salesmen walking away in embarrassment.
; Milk Lemonade Chocolate: Different characters in competitive, or disagreeing situations, who proceed to taunt the losing side by chanting &quot;Milk Lemonade Chocolate&quot;, pointing to their breasts, crotch, and posteriors respectively.
; Oo-oo-hh, fancy!:A sketch featuring a different group of people each time. The group will be comparing items (packed lunches, drinks bought at a bar, etc.). All but the last item will be stereotypically &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;working-class&quot; – but the last person will have something considered &quot;posh&quot;. On hearing this sophisticated item everyone else in the group will put their hands by their cheeks – wiggling their fingers – and chant &#x27;OO-OO-HH Fancy!&#x27;. The most infamous example is the &quot;Cheese Baguette&quot;, as being slightly more sophisticated than an ordinary cheese sandwich, that it is still commonly used as a comedic taunt within social groups.
; Eric the Activist (Hemphill): A deranged animal rights activist (always seen in a tie-dyed shirt and baggy jeans) who would do to a person what he/she is doing to an animal, such as grab a guy&#x27;s lip when he is fishing to show what it feels like. His catchphrases are &quot;Now you know what it feels like&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Mon the (animal that is being abused)!&quot;
; Harry (Kiernan), Linda (Dunbar) and George (Hemphill): Harry often becomes unjustifiably angry and even verbally abusive to his long-suffering wife, Linda, if she makes the simplest of mistakes, such as during a game of Monopoly or &quot;Countdown&quot;. George – a family friend with a soft spot for Linda – always gets caught in the middle of these arguments while trying to stop them. Linda and George always have the last laugh, however, as Harry is nearly always injured at the end of these episodes. The final sketch of Series 2, featuring a Hogmanay party at the couple&#x27;s house, shows Harry&#x27;s ultimate comeuppance, when Linda and George end up kissing passionately in front of him after he makes a fuss about some sausage rolls Linda said she&#x27;d made herself but had in fact, bought meat and pastry and &quot;put the sausage rolls together&quot; which, Harry tries to make clear, are not the same thing. They reappeared in Series 3 where they visit a zoo in episode one and a warehouse in episode four.
; Tom Gallagher (Hemphill): A Glasgow merchant who sets up stalls around Glasgow in an attempt to sell sports socks at the price of &quot;two for a pound&quot;.
; Brenda (Karen Dunbar): A woman who repeatedly injures (often seriously) her husband (Hemphill), she then shouts &quot;HELP HELP, there&#x27;s been a terrible accident!&quot; in a very bored, insincere manner. Her husband then usually replies with &quot;Brenda, ya bastard!&quot; Another Brenda was introduced in Series 4, depicting an overbearing woman who would, at unexpected moments, go &quot;My heart was like that&quot;, and tap on her chest simultaneously.
; Rab McGlinchy (Kiernan):Rab is a stereotypical shellsuit-wearing, chain-smoking, hard-drinking Glaswegian ned in who is employed by the television company to translate the Scottish news, narrated by a newsreader (Hemphill), into the ned dialect. He is introduced thusly &quot;...and here, interpreting for the Neds tonight, Rab McGlinchy.&quot;
; Singing Bar Boys: Many old men who sing songs, changing the lyrics for comedic effect. Some of these characters later appeared in &quot;Still Game&quot;.
; Archie – Couple o&#x27; plums: Two men harass their friend Archie in a bar. A typical sketch will involve Archie walking up to his mates, at which point they start shouting &quot;ARCHIIIEE&quot; whilst fondling him. Often they will shout &quot;TITTIES&quot; or &quot;COUPLE O&#x27; PLUMS.&quot; Archie then gets frustrated with them and storms off after shouting: &quot;Get aaf me ya pair ah bastards!&quot;
; Take a Drink!:In different situations, while several people are drinking (not necessarily alcoholic beverages), a person declines to drink. He/she is prompted to &quot;Take a drink&quot; by a constantly growing number of people until they give up and accept (&quot;Awright then&quot;), at which point everyone cheers him/her.
; Foulmouthed Fishermen: Two fishermen aboard the trawler the &quot;pearl necklace&quot;. They speak in a nautical sounding tone but the words used are rude and have very little to do with ships, tending to make references to sex or various parts of the anatomy.
; The Wee Girl with the Scooter: Often characters are seen to be injured in various, and often serious, ways, such as being run over or pushed down the stairs, and when looking around to see the perpetrator, they are faced with a smiling young girl on a scooter, accompanied by some light ice cream van-esque music. The injured party and anyone accompanying them respond by saying, &quot;Awww&quot; and seem to forget about what has happened to them, occasionally dying from their injuries.
; Woman married to Derek (Karen Dunbar):A (gullible) woman on the phone to her mother recounting how great her husband Derek (who is never seen) is, completely unaware that he seems to be a self-serving liar and cheat. For example, he travels to Tenerife without his wife, telling her it&#x27;s because she has an old red passport instead of a new blue one (red actually being the latest and blue no longer valid during recording) and she could not have a photograph taken because her teeth are &quot;fillings with magnets&quot; and would break the photo booth. The conversation ends when sheriff&#x27;s officers appear to &quot;repossess the beanbag&quot; she is sitting on.
; Wank, Good Guy: Various characters in different situations describing other people (and things) as either a &quot;wank&quot; or a &quot;good guy&quot;, including ducks in a pond, gingerbread men, fish, and soldiers at the Changing of the Guard being described that way by Prince Philip.

<text>Foodstuffs (NZ) Ltd is a New Zealand grocery company owned by the retailers&#x27; cooperatives Foodstuffs North Island Limited and Foodstuffs South Island Limited. Together, the two cooperatives collectively control an estimated 53% of the New Zealand grocery market. The group owns retail franchises Four Square, New World and Pak&#x27;nSave, and in-store private labels Pams, Pam&#x27;s Finest, and Pam&#x27;s Value (formerly named Budget). Foodstuffs operates over 400 retail stores , and serves an estimated 3.6 million customers each week.

Foodstuffs&#x27; major competitor is the New Zealand division of the Australian Woolworths Group through their main supermarket chain Woolworths New Zealand, creating an effective duopoly in New Zealand&#x27;s supermarket sector.

== History ==

The first Foodstuffs co-operative was formed in Auckland in 1922. On 6 July 1922, Foodstuffs founder J Heaton Barker called together members of the Auckland Master Grocers&#x27; Association to discuss plans for the formation of a co-operative buying group. The buying group expanded in 1925 with the introduction of Four Square branding on members&#x27; stores. Similar co-operatives were set up in other parts of the country, with Wellington commencing also in 1922, Christchurch in 1928 and Dunedin in 1948. Initially, the buying groups traded under different names, but in 1935, the name Foodstuffs was applied to all the original co-operatives.

There have been various mergers between the small regional co-operatives, and until 2013 there were three co-operative companies: Foodstuffs (Auckland) Ltd; Foodstuffs (Wellington) Co-operative Society Ltd, and Foodstuffs South Island Ltd. Each operated independently and autonomously with its own board of directors, chief executive officer and management structure. There were no common members or shareholders. The organisation has continued to evolve, adopting supermarkets early in their evolution with the formation of the New World group in 1963. The Pak&#x27;nSave group began later, and the first store was opened in Kaitaia in 1985.

In 2006 Foodstuffs acquired a 10% stake in The Warehouse for $150 million. This was a time when The Warehouse was pushing to enter the grocery business. Later that year, Foodstuffs applied to the Commerce Commission to make an acquisition of The Warehouse in cooperation with Pacific Equity Partners. Foodstuff&#x27;s stake in The Warehouse was later sold in 2021 for a loss.

On 7 February 2013, Foodstuffs (Auckland) Ltd and Foodstuffs (Wellington) Co-operative Society Ltd announced that a merger was being planned to bring the two companies together under the name Foodstuffs North Island Ltd. The merged Foodstuffs North Island started trading on 1 September 2013.

In September 2017 Foodstuffs announced that they had a goal to stop selling cage eggs by 2027. This followed an announcement by Countdown a few months prior that they would stop selling cage eggs by 2024. Foodstuffs&#x27; Pams brand has been cage free since 2008.

In August 2018 Foodstuffs announced that beginning on 1 January 2019, they would stop selling plastic bags within their stores. In 2022 Foodstuffs North Island announced that 29 of its North Island stores had started using facial recognition technology as a crime prevention measure.

In November 2023 Foodstuffs proposed to merge Foodstuffs North Island and Foodstuffs South Island into one entity. Foodstuffs argued that this would reduce costs due to a lack of duplication. However, the Commerce Commission blocked the merger in October 2024, stating that the buying power of the combined entity would be greater than what Foodstuffs North and South Island had individually, which would reduce competition and allow them to purchase from their suppliers at lower prices.

In February 2024 Foodstuffs North Island began trialling facial recognition technology, in use since 2022, in Pak&#x27;nSave and New World stores to detect people who have previously been trespassed. The Privacy Commissioner has expressed concerns about the technology&#x27;s rate of false matches, which occurs higher in people of colour and women.

==Four Square==


Four Square is a national chain of 225 small scale supermarkets that operate in both the North and South Islands. During the 1950s the Foodstuffs advertising department designed the famous &quot;Mr 4 Square&quot; who initially appeared only in newspaper advertising and posters, but was developed to become part of the Four Square identity, appearing in every Four Square store and eventually becoming a nationally recognised symbol in New Zealand, remaining famous to this day. The image is often closely associated with the art of New Zealand artist Dick Frizzell, who has used the iconic character in many of his works.

The name Four Square emerged when Mr Barker, while talking on the telephone to one of the buying group members on 4 July 1924, drew a square around the 4 of the date on his calendar. He immediately realised he had a suitable name for the buying group, stating that &quot;they would stand &#x27;Four Square&#x27; to all the winds that blew&quot;.

==New World==
New World is a full-service supermarket chain. Founded in 1963, New World was the first American-style full-service supermarket brand of Foodstuffs, and the second in New Zealand (after Foodtown). There is a total of 148 New World supermarkets across the North and South Islands of New Zealand (as of July 2023). New World stores tend to be smaller () and more upscale than their competitors. Prices tend to be higher in most stores, due to the cost of upscale presentation, large employee numbers (200–300 in some large stores), and often a lack of competition, especially in smaller towns. New World has been a member of the Fly Buys programme since the programme started in September 1996; Foodstuffs has a 25% stake in the Fly Buys company.

The New World brand was designed by Auckland design and branding studio Sanders Design.

==Pak&#x27;nSave==

Pak&#x27;nSave is a New Zealand discount supermarket chain owned by the Foodstuffs cooperative. Founded in 1985, Pak&#x27;nSave is the most recent of the three current major New Zealand supermarkets (Countdown, New World, and Pak&#x27;nSave) to be founded. There are 58 Pak&#x27;nSave stores operating across the North and South Islands of New Zealand as of July 2023. Stores are large and have a no-frills environment, often with unlined interiors and concrete floors. Customers are left to pack their own bags or boxes.

The Pak&#x27;nSave brand was designed by Auckland design and branding studio Sanders Design.

The stores are supplied daily from their co-operative distributor Foodstuffs. Pak&#x27;nSave stores often buys stock in bulk. This process means that stores don&#x27;t offer a wide variety of products as full-service supermarkets – a 2009 &quot;Consumer magazine&quot; survey noticed this especially in the pet food and toilet paper categories.

==On the Spot==
On the Spot is a chain of 71 (as of July 2023) convenience stores/dairies in the South Island.

==LiquorLand==

Foodstuffs operates a franchise of independently owned liquor stores: LiquorLand.

LiquorLand is run by Foodstuffs North Island and Foodstuffs South Island. It has 147 stores, including 45 Auckland stores. The chain sells a range of spirits, liqueurs, beer, wine, cider, ready-to-drinks and snack food, including confectionery.

Henry&#x27;s Beer, Wine &amp; Spirits was run by Foodstuffs South Island. These have now been rebranded to LiquorLand stores.

==Wholesalers==

* Gilmours (part of &quot;Foodstuffs North Island&quot;).
* Trents (part of &quot;Foodstuffs South Island&quot;)

== Operations ==
Foodstuffs is vertically integrated, operating central distribution centres which supply stores throughout the country. Foodstuffs North Island and Foodstuffs South Island jointly own Foodstuffs NZ Limited, which is used to coordinate between the different Foodstuffs cooperatives. It owns the brand names, but does not trade on its own or act as a holdings company.

<text>Manipal is a suburb and university town within Udupi, in coastal Karnataka, India. Manipal is located five kilometres away from the centre of Udupi City, in Udupi District, Karnataka (state) in south western India. It is administered by the Udupi City Municipality. The suburb is located in coastal Karnataka, 62 km north of Mangalore and 8 km east of the Arabian Sea.

<text>Eric Malling (September 4, 1946 – September 28, 1998) was a Canadian television journalist.

Malling was born in Swift Current, Saskatchewan. He was the only son of Danish immigrant John Malling Sorensen, a butcher. He graduated from the University of Saskatchewan with a BA degree in English literature, then continued his studies at Carleton University&#x27;s School of Journalism in Ottawa.

==Career==
Eric Malling was a hard-hitting investigative journalist. Malling initially worked for the provincial government. He then worked as a journalist for the Regina Leader-Post, Swift Current Sun, and The Toronto Star beginning in 1968. From 1976 to 1990, he was the host of the CBC&#x27;s &quot;the fifth estate&quot;. In 1978, his one-hour documentary on Gerald Bull and his role in the illegal export of artillery shells from Canada to South Africa during apartheid brought wide acclaim. In another of many sensational stories, the Federal Minister responsible for Fisheries, John Fraser, resigned after Malling revealed he had overruled his own health inspectors and allowed the sale of tainted &quot;StarKist&quot; brand of tuna based on the suggestion by a non-government corporation.

In 1990, he moved to CTV to host &quot;W5&quot;, which during this period was known as &quot;W5 with Eric Malling&quot;. In 1995, Malling moved from hosting &quot;W5&quot; to hosting &quot;Mavericks&quot;, a CTV program that explored controversial political figures.

His television journalism earned him a Gemini Award, six ACTRA Awards, three Gordon Sinclair awards for excellence in broadcast journalism. He also received two Centre for Investigative Journalism Awards for excellence in investigative journalism.

Malling died at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto. He was 52 years of age.

<doc id="887537" wikidata="Q157079" url="?curid=887537" title="Wir sind Helden">
<text>Wir sind Helden (, German for &quot;We are heroes&quot;) was a German pop rock band that was established in 2000 in Hamburg and based in Berlin. The band was composed of lead singer and guitarist Judith Holofernes, drummer , bassist and keyboardist/guitarist .

Wir sind Helden&#x27;s breakthrough came in 2002 with the release of the song &quot;Guten Tag&quot;, even though the band did not yet have a recording contract. The ensuing debut album, &quot;Die Reklamation&quot;, reached No. 2 in the German charts and sold over half a million copies. Over the rest of the decade, the band released the albums &quot;Von hier an blind&quot;, &quot;Soundso&quot; and &quot;Bring mich nach Hause&quot;, all of which peaked at No. 1 or No. 2 in the German and Austrian charts.

Wir sind Helden&#x27;s music shows influences from the Neue Deutsche Welle, especially in the debut album &quot;Die Reklamation&quot;. The band&#x27;s music is also characterized by social commentary in songs such as &quot;Guten Tag&quot; and &quot;Müssen nur wollen&quot;. In April 2012, the band informed its fans that it was going on indefinite hiatus.

== History ==

=== 2000–2002: Early years ===

Prior to the formation of Wir sind Helden, singer-songwriter and guitarist Judith Holofernes was performing in Berlin clubs as a solo artist and had self-released the EP &quot;Kamikazefliege&quot; (1999). The band was founded in 2000 after she met drummer Pola Roy and keyboardist/guitarist Jean-Michel Tourette at a pop music workshop in Hamburg. Soon thereafter, Mark Tavassol joined the band as bassist.

The idea behind using the word &quot;Helden&quot; (which means &quot;heroes&quot;) in the band name was to reclaim the word for the antiheroes (&quot;Der Begriff &#x27;Helden&#x27; wird jetzt so inflationär benutzt. Wir wollten ihn zurückhaben für die Antihelden.&quot; English: &quot;The term &#x27;heroes&#x27; is so inflated now. We want it back for the anti-heroes.&quot;). In addition, the band name was also inspired by German band Die Helden, which was the first band Holofernes saw performing live, and by the song &quot;Heroes&quot; by English singer David Bowie, whom Holofernes has cited as a role model for the band.

In 2002, Wir sind Helden self-released the EP &quot;Guten Tag&quot;. Despite the band&#x27;s lack of recording contract, the title song was played by German radio stations and its music video was aired on the rotation of MTV Germany. The band consequently attracted the attention of several record companies and then signed with Labels, an EMI label. The growing interest in the band also led to Holofernes being invited to appear on &quot;Die Harald Schmidt Show&quot;, a late-night talk show on German television.

=== 2003–2004: &quot;Die Reklamation&quot; ===
Wir sind Helden&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Guten Tag&quot;, was released in February 2003, and the follow-up single was &quot;Müssen nur wollen&quot;, released in May 2003. The criticisms of modern-day life in both songs (the former relating to consumerism and the latter concerning the pressure to achieve) brought the band to the attention of newspaper culture sections. Both singles entered the German singles chart, where they reached No. 53 and No. 57, respectively.

The two singles were followed by Wir sind Helden&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Die Reklamation&quot;, which was released in July 2003. In addition to uptempo, punk-influenced songs such as the previously released &quot;Guten Tag&quot; and &quot;Müssen nur wollen&quot;, the album also includes melancholic songs such as &quot;Die Zeit heilt alle Wunder&quot; and &quot;Du erkennst mich nicht wieder&quot;.

German news website &quot;Spiegel Online&quot; declared that Wir sind Helden&#x27;s sound reconciled the good sides of New Wave and Neue Deutsche Welle with the modern era, and it named &quot;Die Reklamation&quot; as one of the most important CDs of 2003. In his review of the album, Stefan Friedrich of music magazine &quot;laut.de&quot; described Holofornes as the woman currently writing the most intelligent, witty and beautiful German song lyrics.

&quot;Die Reklamation&quot; entered the German albums chart at No. 6 before peaking at No. 2 and eventually selling over 500,000 copies. At the 2004 ECHO music awards, Wir sind Helden was the recipient of three awards.

=== 2005–2006: &quot;Von hier an blind&quot; ===

Released in April 2005, Wir sind Helden&#x27;s second album, &quot;Von hier an blind&quot;, saw the band become more introspective and less political compared to &quot;Die Reklamation&quot;. Speaking in an interview, Holofernes stated that the album was concerned with asking what was it deep inside that prevented happiness (&quot;Ich habe mich gefragt, was mich tief im Inneren davon abhält, glücklich zu sein&quot;).

In comparison with &quot;Die Reklamation&quot;, &quot;Von hier an blind&quot; gives less prominence to keyboard sounds and Neue Deutsche Welle influences. The album also includes the swing number &quot;Gekommen um zu bleiben&quot;, which Wir sind Helden performed with a live orchestra at the 2005 ECHO music awards.

&quot;Von hier an blind&quot; went straight to the top of the German albums chart and stayed in the top 10 for twenty weeks. The album also charted at No. 1 in Austria. Two singles from the album, &quot;Gekommen um zu bleiben&quot; and &quot;&quot;, were both top 30 hits in the German singles chart.

Later in 2005, Wir sind Helden was one of the headliners at German rock music festival Rock am Ring and was one of the acts performing in Berlin as part of the series of Live 8 concerts. The following year, Holofernes and Roy married and started a family.

=== 2007–2009: &quot;Soundso&quot; ===
The third album by Wir sind Helden, &quot;Soundso&quot;, was released in May 2007 and reached No. 2 in both the German and Austrian albums charts. Speaking in an interview, Tavassol explained that the common theme of the album was that of distribution of roles, individuality, and personalities within the various roles (&quot;Es gibt dabei einen roten Faden, das ist das Thema Rollenverteilung, Individualität und letztendlich Persönlichkeiten in den verschiedenen Rollen&quot;).

&quot;Soundso&quot; saw a development in Wir Helden&#x27;s sound, with Neue Deutsche Welle influences reduced to a minimum and the incorporation of further musical elements such as horns, glam guitars and virtual orchestras. The album also saw the introduction of &quot;musical humour&quot; to the band&#x27;s music: according to Tourette, duophonic guitars and synthesized saxophones were used because of their cheesiness and charm (&quot;Zweistimmige Gitarren einzusetzen, ist im deutschen Pop genauso verpönt, wie synthetische Saxofone zuzulassen. Wir haben jetzt beides auf dem Album, weil sie schön cheesy klingen, aber Charme haben&quot;).

The first single released from &quot;Soundso&quot; was &quot;Endlich ein Grund zur Panik&quot;, a hectic synthpop song with a swing and ska climax backing up the choruses. While polarizing fans, the single went to No. 34 in the German charts.

=== 2010–2011: &quot;Bring mich nach Hause&quot; ===

After three years away from the spotlight, Wir sind Helden returned in August 2010 with &quot;Bring mich nach Hause&quot;, the band&#x27;s fourth album. The band had by then signed to Sony Music following the break-up of Labels. In addition, Wir sind Helden had parted ways with Patrik Majer, who had produced the band&#x27;s previous three albums, with the new album being produced by English producer Ian Davenport.

For the recording of &quot;Bring mich nach Hause&quot;, Wir sind Helden strived to use real instruments over synthesizers. Additional instruments which can be heard on the album include the accordion, oud, banjo and glockenspiel. In addition, bassist Jörg Holdinghausen from German band Tele was involved in recording the album as guest musician and vocalist.

Speaking in an interview, Holofernes stated that &quot;Bring mich nach Hause&quot; had both a melancholic side and a euphoric side, and cited &quot;Alles&quot; as the song which best embodied these two sides. &quot;Alles&quot; was the first single released from the album and reached No. 36 in the German singles chart. The album itself went to No. 1 in Germany and Austria.

=== 2012: Indefinite hiatus ===
On 4 April 2012, it was announced on the official Wir sind Helden website that the band was going on an indefinite hiatus. The band members cited the distance between their home cities, the demands of their family lives, &quot;signs of wear and tear&quot;, and the feeling of an increasingly impossible undertaking (&quot;...so haben wir trotz numeroser echter Kinder, dreier Heimatstädte und diverser Abnutzungserscheinungen festgehalten an einem immer unmöglicher werdenden Unterfangen...&quot;). In February 2014, Holofernes released her first post-Wir sind Helden solo album, &quot;Ein leichtes Schwert&quot;.

== Musical style ==
Wir sind Helden has been referred to as a pop band or pop rock band in the German press. In an interview at the time of the release of &quot;Die Reklamation&quot;, Roy acknowledged that the band&#x27;s music had Neue Deutsche Welle influences and added that it contained indie rock as well. He further stated that Holofernes&#x27;s song writing was influenced by Elvis Costello, Bob Dylan and Rio Reiser.

== International activities ==
Wir sind Helden held two back-to-back concerts in London, England in 2005, playing in front of 500 fans on each occasion. Two years later, the band returned to London to perform at the Institute of Contemporary Arts as part of the 2007 iTunes Festival. Other foreign countries in which the band gave live performances include Austria, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland.

In 2007, the iTunes Store launched its series of &quot;iTunes Foreign Exchange&quot; singles, where two artists from countries with different languages are paired up to cover each other&#x27;s music. The first single released features American band +44 and Wir sind Helden, with the former providing an English cover of &quot;Guten Tag&quot; and the latter doing a German cover of the +44 song &quot;When Your Heart Stops Beating&quot;. The original versions of the songs are also included in the single.

Video game company EA Sports used the Wir sind Helden songs &quot;Guten Tag&quot; and &quot;Endlich ein Grund zur Panik&quot; for the soundtracks of its association football games. The songs appear on &quot;FIFA Football 2004&quot; and &quot;FIFA 08&quot;, respectively.

Two Wir sind Helden compilation albums were released outside Germany: &quot;Sa Itte Miyo&quot;, which was released in Japan, and &quot;Wir sind Helden&quot;, which was released in France. For these albums, some songs were re-recorded in Japanese or French.

<doc id="887540" wikidata="Q537116" url="?curid=887540" title="Watching Ellie">
<text>Watching Ellie is an American television sitcom that stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus and was created by her husband, Brad Hall and aired on NBC from February 26, 2002 to May 20, 2003. Sixteen episodes were broadcast before it was canceled due to low ratings, the show received mixed reviews.

== Premise and formats ==
There were two incarnations of &quot;Watching Ellie&quot;. Both focused on the character of cabaret singer Ellie Riggs (Louis-Dreyfus), with markedly different approaches.

The first was directed by Ken Kwapis, known for his innovative work in single-camera sitcoms such as &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; and &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot;. Each 22-minute episode was meant to portray a 22-minute slice of Ellie&#x27;s life, in real time. In the earliest episodes, a clock was even shown in the corner of the screen. Louis-Dreyfus stated in 2003 that the clock was Jeff Zucker&#x27;s idea. Thirteen episodes were filmed, but only ten aired before the series was put on indefinite hiatus (the remaining first-season episodes have never aired).

Nearly a full year later, the show reappeared as a more traditional sitcom, with multiple cameras and a live studio audience plus an added laugh track. This version fared even worse than its predecessor and was canceled after six episodes.

== Cast ==
* Julia Louis-Dreyfus – Ellie Riggs
* Lauren Bowles – Susan
* Steve Carell – Edgar
* Darren Boyd – Ben
* Peter Stormare – Ingvar
* Don Lake – Dr. Zimmerman

==Production==
Louis-Dreyfus and Hall earned salaries of $350,000 each per episode and their contracts stipulated 15 episodes per season, rather than the usual 22. Carsey-Werner-Mandabach Productions, the original production company, dropped out because of the high costs and was replaced by NBC Studios.

The show was pitched to ABC, CBS, Fox and HBO, who all turned down the series.

Louis-Dreyfus and Bowles played sisters and they are also half-sisters in real life.

<text>The Amer is a river in the Dutch province of North Brabant. It is a continuation of the Bergse Maas river from the river Donge near Raamsdonksveer to the point where it joins the river Nieuwe Merwede to form the Hollands Diep estuary, and has a total length of approximately . The Amer is a major navigation route. It forms the south boundary of the Biesbosch National Park.

In 1886, the splitting of the Maas and of the Waal made the Amer the mouth of the Maas. Before anthropogenic actions in the early 1900s, salmon used to reach the Bergse Maas through the Amer.

The river is also known because the Amercentrale, one of the biggest power plants in the Netherlands, is located on its bank. As a result, ships transporting coal for the plant use the eastern part of the river, mainly coming from the Wilhelmina Canal.

<text>Alisha Klass (born January 3, 1972) is a former American pornographic actress.

==Career==
Klass began starring in pornographic movies around 1997, becoming the best known collaborator with director Seymore Butts, aka Adam Glasser, to whom she was once engaged. Klass had a tattoo on her rear reading &quot;Seymore Butts.&quot; However, following an acrimonious break up in 2000 she has since had it covered with a dolphin. &quot;Tampa Tushy Fest, Part 1&quot;, a 1998 video featuring Klass in a lesbian fisting scene with Chloe Nicole, resulted in Glasser being charged with obscenity. Glasser pleaded public nuisance charge as part of an agreement with the Los Angeles city attorney&#x27;s office on March 20, 2002. He also paid a fine of $1,000.

===Other ventures===
Klass has worked as a host on the &quot;Playboy&quot; television show, &quot;Inside Adult&quot;, and wrote a column for &quot;Club Confidential&quot; magazine. 

===Appearances===
Klass had a brief cameo as a cheerleader in the movie &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; in 1999. She appeared briefly as a dancer in the 2001 independent film &quot;The Center of the World&quot;. Klass has also made appearances on the &quot;Howard Stern Show&quot;, both television and radio, as well as various documentaries about the adult industry as herself including &quot;Porn Star: The Legend of Ron Jeremy&quot; in 2001.

==Personal life==
She studied directing and screenwriting at UCLA in 2001. She was engaged to Seymore Butts and briefly dated sports agent Dan Lozano.

<doc id="887545" wikidata="Q1784133" url="?curid=887545" title="Coupling (probability)">
<text>In probability theory, coupling is a proof technique that allows one to compare two unrelated random variables (distributions) and by creating a random vector whose marginal distributions correspond to and respectively. The choice of is generally not unique, and the whole idea of &quot;coupling&quot; is about making such a choice so that and can be related in a particularly desirable way.

==Definition==

Using the standard formalism of probability theory, let formula_1 and formula_2 be two random variables defined on probability spaces formula_3 and formula_4. Then a coupling of formula_1 and formula_2 is a &quot;new&quot; probability space formula_7 over which there are two random variables formula_8 and formula_9 such that formula_8 has the same distribution as formula_1 while formula_9 has the same distribution as formula_2.

An interesting case is when formula_8 and formula_9 are &quot;not&quot; independent.

==Examples==

===Random walk===
Assume two particles &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; perform a simple random walk in two dimensions, but they start from different points. The simplest way to couple them is simply to force them to walk together. On every step, if &quot;A&quot; walks up, so does &quot;B&quot;, if &quot;A&quot; moves to the left, so does &quot;B&quot;, etc. Thus, the difference between the two particles&#x27; positions stays fixed. As far as &quot;A&quot; is concerned, it is doing a perfect random walk, while &quot;B&quot; is the copycat. &quot;B&quot; holds the opposite view, i.e. that it is, in effect, the original and that &quot;A&quot; is the copy. And in a sense they both are right. In other words, any mathematical theorem, or result that holds for a regular random walk, will also hold for both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.

Consider now a more elaborate example. Assume that &quot;A&quot; starts from the point (0,0) and &quot;B&quot; from (10,10). First couple them so that they walk together in the vertical direction, i.e. if &quot;A&quot; goes up, so does &quot;B&quot;, etc., but are mirror images in the horizontal direction i.e. if &quot;A&quot; goes left, &quot;B&quot; goes right and vice versa. We continue this coupling until &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; have the same horizontal coordinate, or in other words are on the vertical line (5,&quot;y&quot;). If they never meet, we continue this process forever (the probability of that is zero, though). After this event, we change the coupling rule. We let them walk together in the horizontal direction, but in a mirror image rule in the vertical direction. We continue this rule until they meet in the vertical direction too (if they do), and from that point on, we just let them walk together. 

This is a coupling in the sense that neither particle, taken on its own, can &quot;feel&quot; anything we did. Neither the fact that the other particle follows it in one way or the other, nor the fact that we changed the coupling rule or when we did it. Each particle performs a simple random walk. And yet, our coupling rule forces them to meet almost surely and to continue from that point on together permanently. This allows one to prove many interesting results that say that &quot;in the long run&quot;, it is not important where you started in order to obtain that particular result.

===Biased coins===

Assume two biased coins, the first with probability &quot;p&quot; of turning up heads and the second with probability &quot;q&quot; &gt; &quot;p&quot; of turning up heads. Intuitively, if both coins are tossed the same number of times, we should expect the first coin turns up fewer heads than the second one. More specifically, for any fixed &quot;k&quot;, the probability that the first coin produces at least &quot;k&quot; heads should be less than the probability that the second coin produces at least &quot;k&quot; heads. However proving such a fact can be difficult with a standard counting argument. Coupling easily circumvents this problem.

Let &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; be indicator variables for heads in a sequence of flips of the first coin. For the second coin, define a new sequence &quot;Y&quot;1, &quot;Y&quot;2, ..., &quot;Y&quot;&quot;n&quot; such that

* if &quot;Xi&quot; = 1, then &quot;Yi&quot; = 1,
* if &quot;Xi&quot; = 0, then &quot;Yi&quot; = 1 with probability (&quot;q&quot; − &quot;p&quot;)/(1 − &quot;p&quot;).

Then the sequence of &quot;Yi&quot; has exactly the probability distribution of tosses made with the second coin. However, because &quot;Yi&quot; depends on &quot;Xi&quot;, a toss by toss comparison of the two coins is now possible. That is, for any &quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;

:formula_16

=== Convergence of Markov Chains to a stationary distribution ===
Initialize one process formula_17 outside the stationary distribution and initialize another process formula_18 inside the stationary distribution. Couple these two independent processes together formula_19. As you let time run these two processes will evolve independently. Under certain conditions, these two processes will eventually meet and can be considered the same process at that point. This means that the process outside the stationary distribution converges to the stationary distribution.

<text>Adrien Maurice de Noailles, 3rd [[Duke of Noailles]] (29 September 167824 June 1766) was a French nobleman and soldier.

== Biography ==
Son of Anne Jules de Noailles, he inherited the title duc de Noailles on his father&#x27;s death in 1708.

He fought in the War of the Spanish Succession (1710–1713) during which the forces under his command on 24–26 July 1710 drove back a British attack on Sète. He was president of the Finance Council from 1715 to 1718. He distinguished himself in the War of the Polish Succession (1733–1738) and was made a marshal of France in 1734, becoming dean of the marshals in 1748. 

He served in the War of the Austrian Succession and was appointed to command the French forces in March 1743. He was defeated at the Battle of Dettingen in June 1743, but successfully drove the Austrians out of Alsace-Lorraine the following year, although he missed an opportunity to seriously damage the Austrian army as it was crossing the Rhine.

The duc de Noailles was Foreign Minister from April to November 1744, and regarded Great Britain as a greater enemy of France than Austria. He later acted in a diplomatic capacity and had substantial influence over the course of foreign policy.

== Family ==
In 1698, as comte d&#x27;Ayen, he married Françoise Charlotte Amable d&#x27;Aubigné, niece and beneficiary of the marquise de Maintenon, and by her had six children, 4 daughters and 2 sons. His two sons Louis, 4th duc de Noailles, and Philippe, duc de Mouchy, also went on to become marshals of France.

The duc de Noailles was made a knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1702, a Grandee of Spain in 1711, and a Knight of the Order of Saint-Esprit in 1724.

<text>The Baptist War, also known as the Sam Sharp Rebellion, the Christmas Rebellion, the Christmas Uprising and the Great Jamaican Slave Revolt of 1831–32, was an eleven-day rebellion that started on 25 December 1831 and involved up to 60,000 of the 300,000 slaves in the Colony of Jamaica. The uprising was led by a black Baptist deacon, Samuel Sharpe, and waged largely by his followers. The revolt, though militarily unsuccessful, played a major part in the abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire.

== Ideology ==
The missionary-educated rebels had been following progress of the abolitionist movement in London; their original intention was to call a peaceful general strike. Compared with their Presbyterian, Wesleyan, and Moravian counterparts, Baptist slaves seemed more ready to take action. This may have reflected a higher level of absenteeism among white Baptist missionaries. The relative independence of Black deacons facilitated slaves taking greater ownership over their religious life, including reinterpretations of Baptist theology in terms of their experience (for example, they placed a greater emphasis on the role of John the Baptist, sometimes at the expense of Jesus).

Thomas Burchell, a missionary in Montego Bay, returned from a Christmas vacation in England in late 1831. Rumours circulated among the local Baptist ministry that he was carrying documents signed by William IV that would grant full emancipation. Discontent quickly escalated among slaves when the Jamaican governor announced that the rumours were false and that no emancipation had been granted.

== The strike and the uprising ==
Led by Baptist preacher Samuel Sharpe, enslaved black workers initiated their strike, demanding more freedom and a working wage of &quot;half the going wage rate&quot;; they took an oath to stay away from work until their demands were met. The enslaved labourers, following the example of their ministers, were convinced that the Jamaican government and the plantation owners would capitulate quickly – they were prepared to use force, however, if military action was taken against them. 

Sharpe was the inspiration for the rebellion and was nicknamed &quot;Daddy&quot; by his followers. His officers were literate slaves, like him, and they included Johnson, a carpenter called Campbell from the York estate, a waggoner from the Greenwich estate named Robert Gardner, Thomas Dove from the Belvedere estate, John Tharp from the Hazlelymph estate, and George Taylor, who, like Sharpe, was a deacon in Burchell&#x27;s chapel.

It became the largest slave uprising in the British West Indies, mobilising as many as 60,000 of Jamaica&#x27;s 300,000 slaves. During the rebellion, fourteen white people and over 207 rebels were killed.

Violence exploded on 27 December when a group of slaves burned down the Kensington estate, in the hills above Montego Bay. The governor appointed Colonel William Grignon, a prominent St. James lawyer and militia commander, to suppress the strike and force the slaves back to work. Grignon was also a powerful landowner with several working estates, including one at Salt Spring, where a series of incidents in December were the sparks for the uprising. 

Grignon led his militia against the slaves, expecting them to scatter easily, but strong resistance from rebels armed with stockpiled guns and ammunition forced a retreat. This early victory put Sharpe and his forces in control of the rural areas of the Parish of St James.

On December 31, the colonial authorities instituted martial law. Sir Willoughby Cotton of the British Army assumed responsibility for dealing with the rebels and enlisted the Jamaican Maroons of Accompong Town to confront Sharpe&#x27;s followers in the second week of January 1832. Though the Maroons were themselves descended from escaped slaves, they formed a loose alliance with the colonial government to protect their vulnerable community. 

Accompong Maroons attacked the rebels at Catadupa, but they too chose to retreat because the rebels were &quot;too strong&quot;. They soon gained the upper hand, however, and quickly defeated the rebels in a second skirmish; Sharpe&#x27;s deputy Campbell was slain. When Cotton&#x27;s regulars were besieged in their camp by a large rebel army at Maroon Town, the Accompong Maroons relieved them, killing more rebels and capturing scores of them, including another of Sharpe&#x27;s deputies, Dehany.

When news came that the Windward Maroons from Charles Town, Jamaica and Moore Town had also pledged to fight for Cotton, the rebel cause collapsed. A final battle ended with the capture of rebel leader Gillespie. The remaining slaves, led by Robert Gardner, surrendered when they learned that the Windward Maroons had been sent to finish them off. 

== Suppression and death toll ==
The rebellion was quickly suppressed by the colonial authorities. The reaction of the colonial government and reprisals of the plantocracy were far more brutal than any actions undertaken by the rebels; approximately 500 rebels were killed, with 207 killed outright during the revolt. After the rebellion, an estimated 310 to 340 enslaved Jamaicans, including Sharpe, Gardner, and the other captured slave leaders, were killed through &quot;various forms of judicial executions&quot;. 

Judicial records show that many of the death sentences were ordered for minor offenses (one recorded execution was for the theft of a pig; another, a cow). An 1853 account by missionary Henry Bleby described how the courts commonly executed three or four persons simultaneously; bodies were then piled up and taken by Black labourers to be dumped in mass graves on the outskirts of town. 

Total property damage was estimated in the Jamaican Assembly&#x27;s summary report, issued in March 1832, at £1,154,589 (roughly £124,000,000 in 2021). Thousands of rebels had set fire to more than 100 properties, destroying over 40 sugar works and the homes and estates of nearly 100 white Jamaicans.

White Baptist missionaries were suspected of having encouraged and supplied the rebellion. Some, such as William Knibb and Bleby, were arrested and subjected to tar and feathers but were later released. Churches that had been built for the use of Black congregations were vandalised and destroyed by white mobs.

==Aftermath==
As a result of the Baptist War, hundreds of slaves ran away into the Cockpit Country in order to avoid being forced back into slavery. The Maroons were dispatched to track them down, but only a handful of slaves were captured and sent back to their plantations. Many runaways were still at large when the British government formally abolished slavery in 1833.

Historians argue that the brutality of the Jamaican plantocracy during the revolt accelerated the passage of full emancipation. When Burchell and Knibb gave their accounts before the House of Commons, the representatives were outraged that white Englishmen had been abused for merely associating with rebellious slaves. Parliament passed the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, beginning initial measures late that year, followed by partial emancipation (outright for children six or under, six years&#x27; apprenticeship for the rest) in 1834 and then unconditional emancipation of chattel slavery in 1838.

==In literature==
* Andrea Levy&#x27;s 2010 novel &quot;The Long Song&quot; recounts, through a fictional narrative, the events of the Baptist War.
* The 1929 novel &quot;The White Witch of Rosehall&quot;, by Herbert G. de Lisser, has a climax set in Rose Hall at the time of the Baptist War.

<text>The Sutro Baths was a large, privately owned public saltwater swimming pool complex in the Lands End area of the Outer Richmond District in western San Francisco, California.

Built in 1894, the Sutro Baths was located north of Ocean Beach, the Cliff House, Seal Rocks, and west of Sutro Heights Park. The structure burned down to its concrete foundation in June 1966; its ruins are located in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the Sutro Historic District.

== History ==
On March 14, 1896, the Sutro Baths were opened to the public as the world&#x27;s largest indoor swimming pool establishment. The baths were built on the western side of San Francisco by wealthy entrepreneur and former mayor of San Francisco (1894–1896) Adolph Sutro.

The structure was situated in a small beach inlet below the Cliff House, also owned by Adolph Sutro at the time. Both the Cliff House and the former baths site are now a part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, operated by the United States National Park Service. The baths struggled for years, mostly due to the very high operating and maintenance costs. Eventually, the southernmost part of the baths was converted into an ice skating rink, with a wall separating it from the dilapidated swimming pools, until 1964 when the property was sold to developers for a planned high-rise apartment complex.

In addition to financial struggles, the Sutro Baths became the focus of a significant civil rights battle in 1897. John Harris sued Adolph Sutro after being denied entry to the baths because of his race. Harris won the case, making it a landmark victory against racial segregation in public facilities. This case set an important precedent for future civil rights actions, underscoring the growing demand for equal treatment and access to public spaces.

A fire in 1966 destroyed the building while it was in the process of being demolished. All that remains of the site are concrete walls, blocked-off stairs and passageways, and a tunnel with a deep crevice in the middle. The cause of the fire was determined to be arson. Shortly afterwards, the developers left San Francisco and claimed insurance money.

== Infrastructure and facilities ==
The following statistics are from a 1912 article written by J. E. Van Hoosear of Pacific Gas and Electric. Materials used in the structure included of glass, 600 tons of iron, of lumber, and of concrete.

During high tides, water would flow directly into the pools from the nearby ocean, recycling the two million US gallons (7,600 m3) of water in about an hour. During low tides, a powerful turbine water pump, built inside a cave at sea level, could be switched on from a control room and could fill the tanks at a rate of 6,000 US gallons a minute (380 L/s), recycling all the water in five hours.

Facilities included: 
* Six saltwater pools and one freshwater pool. The baths were long and wide for a capacity of . They were equipped with seven slides, 30 swinging rings, and one springboard. 
* A museum displaying an extensive collection of stuffed and mounted animals, historic artifacts, and artwork, much of which Sutro acquired from the Woodward&#x27;s Gardens estate sale in 1894
* A 2700-seat amphitheater, and club rooms with capacity for 1100
* 517 private dressing rooms
* An ice skating rink

The baths were once served by two rail lines. The Ferries and Cliff House Railroad ran along the cliffs of Lands End overlooking the Golden Gate. The route ran from the baths to a terminal at California Street and Central Avenue, now Presidio Avenue. The second line was the Sutro Railroad, which ran electric trolleys to Golden Gate Park and downtown San Francisco. Both lines were later taken over by the Market Street Railway.

<text>High Willhays ( , ), or according to some authorities High Willes, is the highest point on Dartmoor, Devon, at above sea level, and the highest point in Southern England.

==Toponymy==
In 1912, William Crossing, writer and documenter, said that the name &quot;High Willes&quot; had been thought to have derived from the word &quot;huel&quot; or &quot;wheal&quot; meaning &quot;mine&quot;, but he did not think that very likely as old mine workings were invariably located near to streams. He suggested instead that the name derived from &quot;gwylfa&quot;, a watching place, noting its similarity with &quot;Brown Willy&quot;, the name of the highest hill on nearby Bodmin Moor, and suggested that a watch for beacon fires used to be kept here. He also posited a possible link to the word &quot;gwili&quot; meaning winding or tortuous, but said it was unlikely this was where it originated from.

&quot;The Place-Names of Devon&quot; (1931) notes that the peak was named &quot;Hight Wyll&quot; in a document of 1532, and was known in 1827 as &quot;High Willows&quot;. The authors state that the name may simply be a compound of &quot;high&quot; and &quot;well&quot; (meaning &quot;spring&quot;), though they admit that the additional syllable at the end is hard to explain.

==Topography==
High Willhays is near the northwestern edge of Dartmoor, about south east of Meldon Reservoir and about south of the town of Okehampton. Although it is the highest point of the moor, it is relatively insignificant in comparison to most of the moor&#x27;s tors, consisting of no more than a few low outcrops of rock along a north–south ridge. The largest outcrop is crowned with a cairn. The more impressive, but slightly lower, Yes Tor is about north along this ridge, which is known as &quot;the roof of Devon&quot;.

High Willhays and Yes Tor are the only summits in England south of Kinder Scout in the Peak District to rise above , apart from Black Mountain on the Welsh border. Before Ordnance Survey measured accurately the heights of High Willhays and Yes Tor many people believed Yes Tor was the higher of the two, and it was only the local farmers and moormen that believed the contrary. However, the first topographical survey of the area carried out by Ordnance Survey suggested that High Willhays was higher, although the difference has now been measured at just . William Crossing stated that High Willhays was the highest point in England south of Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales, but since then surveys have shown that Kinder Scout is also higher (albeit less prominent).

The geology of High Willhays, like most of Dartmoor, consists of granite intruded about 280 million years ago. However High Willhays is in an area of the northern plateau of the moor where the exposed rock has noticeably fewer of the large feldspar megacrysts that are typical of most of Dartmoor&#x27;s tors. Each of the outcrops displays lamellar bedding.

High Willhays is within one of Dartmoor&#x27;s Danger Zones, areas used periodically by the British Army for exercises. Red flags are raised around the perimeter when live-firing is due to take place.

<text>The Nederrijn (; &quot;Lower Rhine&quot;; distinct from the Lower Rhine or further upstream) is the Dutch part of the Rhine from the confluence at the town of Angeren of the cut-off Rhine bend of Oude Rijn (Gelderland) and the Pannerdens Kanaal (which was dug to form the new connection between the Waal and Nederrijn branches). The city of Arnhem lies on the right (north) bank of the Nederrijn, just past the point where the IJssel branches off. The Nederrijn flows on to the city of Wijk bij Duurstede, from where it continues as the Lek. The once-important but now small Kromme Rijn branch (in Roman times part of the Limes Germanicus and border river of the Roman Empire) carries the name &quot;Rhine&quot; towards the city of Utrecht.

From the city of Utrecht, the Kromme Rijn forks into the Vecht to the north, and into the Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland) to the west. The first part is channelised and known as the Leidse Rijn (Leiden Rhine). After the railway bridge near Harmelen (municipality Woerden) it is known as the Oude Rijn, flowing westward to the North Sea.

In order to regulate the distribution of drainage between the different branches of the Rhine, several dams have been constructed. If the dams were to be closed, there would be little flow in the Nederrijn and most of the water would be drained by the IJssel. As for the Old Rhine, there is a pumping station near the North Sea that protects the river from sea tides and silting.

Bridges over the Nederrijn are in Arnhem (railway and three road bridges), in Heteren (A50) and Rhenen. Ferries are found near Doorwerth, Wageningen, Opheusden, Elst and Amerongen.

==History==

In 1530, the Rhine near Arnhem was moved, a project that was completed in 1536. The city, which originated along the St. Jansbeek (&quot;St. John&#x27;s Brook&#x27;), could develop better now that it was closer to the river, and was also more easily defended against Habsburg expansionism into Guelders.

<text>A slavocracy (from &quot;slave&quot; + &quot;-ocracy&quot;) is a society primarily ruled by a class of slaveholders, such as those in the southern United States and their confederacy during the American Civil War. The term was initially coined in the 1830s by northern abolitionists as a term of disparagement and subsequently used in wider senses, including as a term for the planter class of such a society itself. Slavocracies are also sometimes known as plantocracies, after &quot;planter&quot; used as a term for the owners of plantations.

A number of European colonies in the New World were largely slavocracies, usually consisting of a small European settler population relying on a predominantly West African chattel slave population as well as smaller numbers of indentured servants, both European and non-European in origin. In the Caribbean, the slaves were primarily used to produce sugar, while in North America the slaves were primarily used to produce cotton. These proslavery societies attempted to resist the abolitionist movement and subsequently relied on freed black and poor white sharecroppers for labor following abolition.

One prominent organization largely representing and collectively funded by a number of British slavocracies was the &quot;West India Interest&quot;, which lobbied the British parliament on behalf of planters. It is credited with delaying the abolition of the slave trade from the 1790s until 1806–1808 and then delaying emancipation into the 1820s and 1830s, extracting reparations for the lost &quot;property&quot; in a policy known as &quot;amelioration&quot;.

<doc id="887567" wikidata="Q958873" url="?curid=887567" title="Otherland">
<text>Otherland is a science fiction tetralogy by American writer Tad Williams, published between 1996 and 2001. The story is set on Earth near the end of the 21st century, probably between 2082 and 2089, in a world where technology has advanced somewhat beyond the present. The most notable advancement is the widespread availability of full-immersion virtual reality installations, which allow people from all walks of life to access an online world, called simply the Net. Tad Williams weaves an intricate plot spanning four thick volumes, and creates a picture of a future society where virtual worlds are fully integrated into everyday life.

His proposed ability to immerse oneself fully in a simulation gives him a great deal of artistic freedom, and the story winds through alternate interpretations of many classical literary works such as &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, &quot;The Odyssey&quot; and &quot;The Iliad&quot;, &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, &quot; Gormenghast&quot;, and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, which are available as entertainment simulations within the series. Orlando Gardiner, one of the main characters in the books, spent most of his teenage years in this world&#x27;s equivalent to MMORPGs based upon J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fiction. The overall series&#x27;s events also bear a strong resemblance to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

The series is known for being ahead of its time. Nearly 30 years after the first books&#x27; release, the themes and technical elements of William&#x27;s work have become more and more accurate.

The story opens with Paul Jonas, a British infantryman in an apparent part of the Western Front of World War I. Wounded, he has a vivid dream in which he meets a &quot;bird-woman&quot;, and after he wakes up, he discovers one of her feathers with him in the trenches. Realizing that the world is not as it seems, he flees, pursued by his comrades Finch and Mullet, who suddenly have different appearances. Suffering from almost complete memory loss, he begins to travel through a series of bizarre worlds, seeking answers to who he is and his connection to the bird-woman. She appears to him in several guises as he travels, and is initially one of the few things he remembers from before the trenches.

Meanwhile, in the late 21st century, technology has advanced so that the internet has become a vast Virtual Reality network. The most realistic connections to the network are achieved by using an expensive, surgically implanted bio-port interface at the back of the user&#x27;s neck called a &#x27;neurocannula&#x27;. However, around the world, children are falling victim to a disease known as Tandagore Syndrome, which in its most serious form is a deep coma from which the patient cannot wake. Irene &quot;Renie&quot; Sulaweyo, an instructor in &quot;virtual engineering&quot; at a polytechnic institute in Durban, South Africa, is devastated when her younger brother, Stephen, falls victim to this disease. She and her former San technology student ǃXabbu begin to investigate what has happened and start discovering strange goings-on in the Net, including an evil hypnotic entity and the constant reappearance of a mysterious golden city. She seeks expert assistance from a previous instructor, Susan van Bleeck. But it soon becomes apparent that she has made powerful enemies: Renie is dismissed from her job, the apartment complex where she and her unemployed father Long Joseph live is burned down, and Professor van Bleeck is murdered. Renie turns to two of van Bleeck&#x27;s acquaintances: a retired security expert and hacker called &quot;Blue Dog Anchorite&quot; and the French researcher Martine Desroubins. Blue Dog Anchorite informs the others that Otherland, the mysterious network where the golden city is located, was specially commissioned by a cryptic organization known as the &quot;Grail Brotherhood&quot;, comprising some of the world&#x27;s wealthiest and most powerful men and women, and that he is the only surviving member of the team who devised Otherland&#x27;s security, his colleagues having died in unusual circumstances. With the help of Martine and Blue Dog, Renie, ǃXabbu, Long Joseph and van Bleeck&#x27;s assistant Jeremiah Dako break into Wasps&#x27; Nest, a mothballed military base in the Drakensberg which nevertheless contains equipment facilitating extended stays online. While Long Joseph and Jeremiah stay offline, she, ǃXabbu and Martine (who remains in France) break into the Otherland network to reach the golden city.

In North America, Orlando Gardiner and his friend Sam Fredericks, famous contestants in the Middle Country, a medieval fantasy gameworld, go on an apparently routine quest, where Orlando finds his own image of the golden city. While he is distracted by the image, his gaming character is killed, and he becomes obsessed with finding out what the city is and why it was shown to him. Following the trail of the city, he and Fredericks gain access to the online fringe community TreeHouse, from where they too find their way into Otherland.

Renie, ǃXabbu, Martine, Orlando and Fredericks, along with several others, find themselves in an uncomfortable situation. In the simulation world, they are held prisoner by the king of Temilún (the golden city), who is none other than Bolivar Atasco, a former member of the Grail Brotherhood. Furthermore, they are unable to drop offline, and experience terrible pain if disconnected by others. Summoned to an audience with Atasco and his wife, they meet a mysterious man named Sellars, who claims to have gathered them. Sellars gives them a mission: they are to find Paul Jonas, who is at large somewhere within Otherland&#x27;s many simulation worlds. But before the briefing can finish, the Atascos&#x27; home in the real world is assaulted by assassins working for the Grail Brotherhood. Bolivar and his wife are murdered, and Sellars vanishes. Even as the group flees Temilún, one of their &quot;sims&quot;—simulation bodies—is secretly taken over by John Dread, a murderous young man who directed the Grail Brotherhood&#x27;s assault on the Atascos and who now seeks to learn about Otherland to his own advantage.

As they try to discover the motivations of the Grail Brotherhood—obviously not world domination, since they already control the world—they discover that they are unable to log off. They are trapped, and if they die in the network, they also die in real life. The series covers their adventures as they seek to uncover the truth and wake their loved ones from their comas.

==Major characters==

===The Volunteers===
*Mr. Sellars—a mysterious man kept under house arrest on a US Military base. He is responsible for recruiting people to infiltrate Otherland and uncover its secrets. Although mentally tortured by the danger to which he has submitted them, he affectionately refers to them as his volunteers and tries to aid them in every way possible.
*Paul Jonas—a British man trapped in Otherland and pursued by the Grail Brotherhood for unknown reasons. He suffers from a hypnotic blocking of his memories. Both the Twins and a strange woman (whom he dubs the Angel) seem to be seeking him out, but for very different purposes.
*Irene (Renie) Sulaweyo—a South African Zulu woman and a college professor in Durban. After her younger brother, to whom she is a surrogate mother, falls into a coma, she begins a search for answers. Renie is headstrong, and other characters constantly refer to her tendency towards action over contemplation.
*ǃXabbu—a Kalahari San and a friend of Renie. He was originally Renie&#x27;s student, learning how to control virtual reality from her in order to create a simulation that would preserve his dying culture. He is known for his ability to tell engaging folktales that offer new insights into situations. 
*Orlando Gardiner—a young boy suffering from progeria who is drawn to Otherland while playing a virtual reality MMORPG called &quot;Middle Country&quot;, in which he is the Barbarian hero Thargor.
*Salome (Sam) Fredericks—Orlando&#x27;s best friend, though the two have never met in person. In &quot;Middle Country&quot;, Sam goes under the alias of Pithlit the thief. Though Sam is actually female, she uses exclusively male aliases, leading to a lot of confusion about her real gender.
*Martine Desroubins—a blind French researcher who is able to sense the online world through a complex synesthesia, around which she has built her personal machine. Though deprived of sight, she is often able to sense things that her companions cannot.
*Singh—Known better by the name &quot;Blue Dog Anchorite&quot;, who is the only surviving member of the group of technicians that designed Otherland and a well-known member of Treehouse.
*Florimel—A German woman who is just as strong-willed as Renie, although not as forthright with her story and motivation.
*Quan Li—A Chinese grandmother who sought out answers after her granddaughter fell into a coma.
*Sweet William-an elderly British man wearing the avatar of a vampire. He and Martine seem to know each other. Like Florimel, he is also silent about his personal life.
*Javier &quot;T4b&quot; Rodgers—a goggleboy who speaks in badly mangled net-slang and wears the armor of a robot or a space-age warrior. Like Florimel and Sweet William, he does not volunteer any information—not that anyone except Orlando and Fredericks could understand him even if he did. He is a suspected charge-head—someone who takes data-based drugs.

===The Grail Brotherhood and associates===
*Félix Jongleur (Osiris)—the wealthy head of the Grail Brotherhood, a powerful organization that employs assassins in order to guard its secrecy. The oldest living man, his motives remain unclear.

*Johnny &quot;Dread&quot; Wulgaru (Anubis)—a half-Aboriginal Australian psychopath obsessed with rape and murder, employed as an assassin by the Grail Brotherhood. He possesses the ability to mentally interfere with machines, allowing him to do many seemingly impossible things. He refers to this ability as his twist.
*Dulcinea (Dulcie) Anwin—an associate of Dread&#x27;s whose specialty is hacking through security systems and gaining information. After the events of the Sky God Project, she is drawn into the events surrounding Dread and Otherland.
*Hideki Kunohara—a Japanese man of unknown allegiances who nevertheless owns private space on the Otherland network.
*Bolivar Atasco (Shu)—A Colombian man who contributed to the Otherland Network in order to build a simulation in which Meso-America became a world power. He agreed to work with Sellars behind the Grail Brotherhood&#x27;s backs.

===Inside Otherland===
*The Other—the strange entity that is the secret and backbone of Otherland.
*The Twins—two men, one monstrously fat and the other painfully skinny, who appear in different incarnations throughout the network. They pursue Paul Jonas relentlessly.
*The Angel—a woman who also appears in different incarnations. She seems to have a particular affinity for Paul Jonas, although she also appears to other characters to give them guidance.
*Gally—a young boy who travels with Paul. He is neither a puppet (non-sentient character) nor a citizen (a human wearing an avatar).
*Azador—a Romany so stereotypical that he is almost amusing. He knows a great deal about the Otherland network, although he is unwilling to share his information.
*Emily 22813—a young woman originally thought to be a puppet who nonetheless is able to cross world boundaries. She is pregnant, and she claims that Azador is the father.
*Nandi Paradivash-an Indian man, a devotee of Krishna, and a member of the Circle, a secret organization of people from all faiths at odds with the Grail Brotherhood.

==Adaptations==

===Video game===
On October 1, 2008, RealU and dtp entertainment announced that they were developing a massively multiplayer online game (MMO) based on the novels. The Otherland MMO was scheduled to be released in Europe and North America in 2012. However, after dtp entertainment (RealU&#x27;s parent company) entered insolvency, RealU confirmed that it was laying off its staff and that development on the Otherland game was cancelled.

On October 9, 2014, Drago Entertainment revealed that it had taken over the game&#x27;s development. The game was preparing for early access through Steam in August 2015, but the release was postponed until September 10 due to bug problems in the U.S. and German servers. After releasing through Steam Early Access, Otherland&#x27;s development woes continued. The game was removed from the Steam store due to alleged technical issues on January 28, 2016. The game became available again on October 4, 2016. Servers for the game were shut down permanently on September 23, 2021.

===Film and TV===
In January 2012, Warner Bros. acquired the film rights to the &quot;Otherland&quot; novels. The producer of the planned feature film was set to be Dan Lin, and the script was to be written by John Scott III.

On December 13, 2023, it was reported that the book series is being developed as a TV series produced by Mike Weber.

<text>Jiří Weil (; 6 August 1900, Praskolesy – 13 December 1959, Prague) was a Czech writer of Jewish origin and Holocaust survivor. His noted works include the two novels &quot;Life with a Star&quot; (&quot;Život s hvězdou&quot;), and &quot;Mendelssohn Is on the Roof&quot; (&quot;Na střeše je Mendelssohn&quot;), as well as many short stories, and other novels.

==Biography==
Weil was born in Praskolesy, a village about 40 kilometres from Prague, on 6 August 1900. He was the second son born to upper-middle-class Orthodox Jewish parents. Weil graduated from secondary school in 1919. As a student he had already begun writing mainly verses, but had also begun planning his three-part novel, &quot;Město&quot;, which he planned to publish under the pseudonym, Jiří Wilde. Upon graduation, Weil was accepted to Charles University in Prague where he entered the Department of Philosophy and also studied Slavic philology and comparative literature. He was a favourite student of F. X. Šalda. He completed his doctoral dissertation, &quot;Gogol and the English Novel of the 18th Century&quot;, in 1928.

In 1921, Weil joined the Young Communists and attained a position of leadership in the group. He had a keen interest in Russian literature and Soviet culture. About that same time, his first articles were published about cultural life in the Soviet Union in the Newspaper &quot;Rudé Právo.&quot; He also became one of the first translators of contemporary Russian literature into the Czech language and bringing works by Boris Pasternak, Vladimir Lugovskoy and Marina Tsvetaeva to Czech readers. He was the first person to translate the works of Vladimir Mayakovsky into Czech.

In 1922, Weil traveled for the first time to the Soviet Union with a youth delegation. He writes about an ill-fated meeting with the poet Sergei Esenin in his feuilleton, &quot;Busta básníkova.&quot; Weil worked in Moscow from 1933 to 1935 as a journalist and translator of Marxist literature in the publishing department of the Comintern, the international wing of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In this capacity, he helped translate Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s &quot;The State and Revolution&quot; into Czech. After the 1934 assassination of Sergei Kirov, which marked the beginning of the Stalinist Purges, Weil found himself on shaky ground in Moscow and in the Communist party. He was expelled from the Communist Party and exiled to Central Asia. The circumstances of his expulsion and his subsequent deportation to Central Asia have never been fully explained, but these experiences marked a turning point for Weil. They are described in a samizdat biography by Weil&#x27;s friend, Jaroslava Vondráčková, &quot;Mrazilo – tálo&quot;.

In 1935, Weil returned to Prague and published his novel &quot;Moskva-hranice&quot; (1937), an account of the purges. The Munich Agreement heralded trouble for Europe&#x27;s Jewish population, but Weil was unable to join relatives in Great Britain.

During the Nazi occupation, Weil was assigned to work at the Jewish Museum in Prague. He was called to be interned at the Terezín (Theresienstadt) ghetto in November 1942, but he decided not to go, instead staging his own death. Weil survived the rest of the war by hiding in various illegal apartments, with several acquaintances and even spent time hiding in a hospital. Despite the tremendous hardship, Weil continued to write.

After the war, Weil reintegrated into cultural life and from 1946 to 1948, he worked as an editor at ELK. He published a lyrical book of tributes to fallen comrades, &quot;Bárvy&quot; (Colours), a novel, &quot;Makanna otec divů&quot;, which won the Czechoslovak book prize that year, and a small book of reminiscences about Julius Fučík. After 1948, Weil lost his position and the press was nationalized.

From 1949 on, Weil&#x27;s work focuses on Jewish themes. His book &quot;Life with a Star,&quot; published without fanfare in 1949, is probably his best-known work. It received varying critical attention, but a firestorm of controversy over it erupted in 1951. Critics decried it as &quot;decadent&quot;, &quot;existentialist&quot;, &quot;highly subjective&quot; and &quot;the product of a cowardly culture.&quot; It was roundly criticized from both an ideological and a religious standpoint and was banned. He resumed work at the Jewish Museum, where he was instrumental in the creation of an exhibition of children&#x27;s drawings from Terezín, I Never Saw Another Butterfly, and the creation of a monument for Jewish citizens murdered by Nazis in the Pinkas Synagogue, for which he wrote a prose poem, &quot;Žalozpěv za 77 297 obětí&quot;.

In the thaw following the death of Klement Gottwald, Weil was readmitted to the Writers&#x27; Union. Weil worked continuously until his death from leukemia in 1959.

==Weil&#x27;s legacy==

In recent years, Weil&#x27;s &quot;Star&quot; is considered a classic. According to Philip Roth (who was largely responsible for introducing Weil to American readers) the book is &quot;without a doubt, one of the outstanding novels I&#x27;ve read about the fate of a Jew under the Nazis. I don&#x27;t know another like it.&quot; Michiko Kakutani adds that it is &quot;one of the most powerful works to emerge from the Holocaust: it is a fierce and necessary work of art.&quot; And Siri Hustvedt has written; &quot;When I mention this astounding novel to people, I am almost always met with blankness. It may be that its subject matter, the Nazi occupation of Prague, is grim. I don&#x27;t know. What I do know is that I read the book when it came out – (the English translation, published in 1989, 40 years after its first publication in Czechoslovakia) – and it burned itself into me. The words German, Nazi and Jew never appear. There is nothing coy about these omissions. They are essential to the novel&#x27;s uncanny immediacy, its urgent telling of a human story which, despite its particularity, refuses to locate itself in the past.&quot;

Beyond &quot;Life with a Star&quot; and &quot;Mendelssohn is on the Roof&quot; Weil&#x27;s fiction is woefully underrepresented in English-language translations. At this writing, his other novels have not been translated into English but an edition of &quot;Colors&quot; is available through Michigan Slavic Publications.

Only &quot;Life with a Star&quot; and &quot;Mendelssohn is on the Roof&quot;, &quot;Moskva-hranice,&quot; and &quot;Dřevená lžice&quot; have been reprinted in Czech.

The 110th anniversary of the birth of Jiří Weil marked by premiere of concert performance of a ballet &quot;MAKANNA&quot; written by the Czech composer and organist Irena Kosíková, based on his novel Makanna otec divů. The concert featured Jan Židlický as narrator, the Czech cellist František Brikcius and the Talich Chamber Orchestra conducted by Maestro Jan Talich. &quot;Makanna&quot; was held under the auspices of Sir Tom Stoppard and Václav Havel to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the birth of Jiří Weil (1900–1959) and as part of the &quot;Daniel Pearl World Music Days&quot; and made possible by the cooperation of the National Gallery, the Jewish Museum in Prague, and the City of Prague.

<text>Henry Wilfrid Brambell (22 March 1912 – 18 January 1985) was an Irish television and film actor, best remembered for playing the grubby rag-and-bone man Albert Steptoe alongside Harry H. Corbett in the long-running BBC television sitcom &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; (1962–1965, 1970–1974). He achieved international recognition in 1964 for his appearance alongside the Beatles in &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, playing the fictional grandfather of Paul McCartney.

==Early life==
Brambell was born on 22 March 1912 in Dublin, the youngest of three sons born to Henry Lytton Brambell (1870–1937), a cashier at the Guinness Brewery, and his wife, Edith Marks (1879–1965), a former opera singer. His two older brothers were Frederick Edward Brambell (1905–1980) and James Christopher Marks &quot;Jim&quot; Brambell (1907–1992).

Brambell&#x27;s first experience as an actor was as a child, entertaining the wounded troops during the First World War. After leaving school, he worked part-time as a reporter for &quot;The Irish Times&quot; and part-time as an actor at the Abbey Theatre before becoming a professional actor for the Gate Theatre. He also did repertory at Swansea, Bristol, and Chesterfield.

In the Second World War, he joined the British military forces entertainment organisation ENSA.

==Acting career==
Brambell had roles in film and television from 1947, his first being an uncredited appearance in &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; as a tram passenger. His television career began during the 1950s, when he was cast in small roles in three Nigel Kneale/Rudolph Cartier productions for BBC Television: as a drunk in &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; (1953), as both an old man in a pub and later a prisoner in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1954), and as a tramp in &quot;Quatermass II&quot; (1955).

He played Jacob, an immigrant from eastern Europe selling newspapers in Paris, in an episode of &quot;Maigret&quot; entitled &quot;A Man of Quality&quot;, first broadcast on 12 December 1960.

All of these roles earned Brambell a reputation for playing old men, despite being aged in his 40s. He appeared in the short film series&quot; Scotland Yard&quot; in the episode, &quot;The Grand Junction Case&quot;. He appeared as Bill Gaye in the 1962 Maurice Chevalier/Hayley Mills picture, &quot;In Search of the Castaways&quot;. He was heard on the original London cast recording of the long-running West End stage musical &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; in which he starred at London&#x27;s Phoenix Theatre.&quot;

He also released two 45-rpm singles, &quot;Second Hand&quot;/&quot;Rag Time Ragabone Man&quot;, that played on his &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; character, followed in 1971 by &quot;Time Marches On&quot;, his tribute to the Beatles.

Brambell was featured in many prominent theatre roles. In 1966, he played Ebenezer Scrooge in a musical version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. This was adapted for radio the same year and was broadcast on the BBC Light Programme on Christmas Eve. Brambell&#x27;s booming baritone voice surprised many listeners: he played the role straight, true to the Dickens original. In 1971, he starred in the premiere of Eric Chappell&#x27;s play, &quot;The Banana Box&quot;, in which he played Rooksby. This was adapted for television under the name &quot;Rising Damp&quot;, with the character of Rooksby renamed Rigsby and played by Leonard Rossiter. Brambell also played Bert Thomson, an Irish widower, in the film &quot;Holiday on the Buses&quot;; the character in question started a close friendship with Stan Butler&#x27;s mother, Mabel.

===&quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; and &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;===
It was Brambell&#x27;s ability to play old men that led to his casting in his best-remembered role as Albert Steptoe, the irascible father in &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, a man who, when the series began, was said to be in his sixties, even though Brambell was only aged 50 in 1962 (thirteen years older than Harry H. Corbett, who played his son Harold). The series began as a pilot on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot;, and its success led to the commissioning of a full series. It ran from 1962 to 1974, including a five-year hiatus. A constant thread throughout the series was Albert being referred to by Harold as a &quot;dirty old man&quot;; for example, when he was eating pickled onions while taking a bath and retrieving dropped ones from the bathwater. There were also two feature film spin-offs, a stage show, and an American incarnation titled &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, some episodes of which were almost exact remakes of the original British scripts.

The success of &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; made Brambell a high-profile figure on British television and earned him the supporting role of Paul McCartney&#x27;s grandfather in the Beatles&#x27; first film, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964). A running joke is made throughout the film of his character being &quot;a very clean old man&quot;, in contrast to his being referred to as a &quot;dirty old man&quot; in &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;. In real life, he was indeed nothing like his &quot;Steptoe&quot; persona, being dapper and well-spoken. He notably spoke with a distinct received pronunciation accent, in strong contrast to both his Cockney &quot;Steptoe&quot; accent and his native Irish accent, which he would use where the role dictated. In 1965, Brambell told the BBC that he did not want to do another series of &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, and in September that year, he travelled to New York City to appear in the Broadway musical &quot;Kelly&quot; at the Broadhurst Theatre. It closed after a single performance.

===Later career===
After the final series of &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; concluded in 1974 Brambell had some guest roles in films and on television. He and Corbett also undertook a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1977, in a stage production based on &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;. He and Corbett appeared together in character for the last time in a 1981 advertisement for Kenco Coffee.

John Sullivan considered him for the role of Grandad in &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, but decided against it as he thought Brambell was too closely associated with &quot;Steptoe&quot;. The role later went to Lennard Pearce whose character encompased some of &quot;Steptoe&quot;&#x27;s habits.

In 1982 he appeared in Terence Davies&#x27;s film &quot;Death and Transfiguration&quot;, playing a dying elderly man who finally comes to terms with his homosexuality. His performance in this short film, a segment of &quot;The Terence Davies Trilogy&quot; (1983), won him critical acclaim. Brambell appears throughout the full 24-minute piece, but he does not speak a single word.

==Personal life==
In 1982, Brambell appeared on BBC News paying tribute to Corbett, after the latter&#x27;s death from a heart attack.

In 2002, Channel 4 broadcast a documentary film, &quot;When Steptoe Met Son&quot;, about the off-screen life of Brambell and his relationship with Corbett. The film claimed that the two men detested each other and were barely on speaking terms after the Australian tour. The claimed rift was supposedly caused in part by Brambell&#x27;s alcoholism and supposedly evidenced by the pair leaving the country on separate planes. The claim was disputed by the writers of &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, who rejected any hatred or conflict. Corbett&#x27;s nephew released a statement in which he said that the actors did not hate each other: &quot;We can categorically say they did not fall out. They were together for nearly a year in Australia, went on several sightseeing trips together, and left the tour at the end on different planes because Harry was going on holiday with his family, not because he refused to get on the same plane.&quot; They continued to work together after the Australian tour on radio and adverts, with it being generally accepted that the relationship between the two actors was under its greatest strain during the tour, though Brambell and Corbett soon settled their differences &quot;fairly amicably&quot;, and in the spring of 1978 performed a short BBC radio sketch entitled &quot;Scotch on the Rocks&quot;.

Brambell was married to Mary Josephine Hall (known as &quot;Molly&quot;) from 1948 to 1955. They divorced after she gave birth to their lodger&#x27;s baby in 1955.

In 1962 Brambell was arrested and accused of persistently importuning in a toilet in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, but was conditionally discharged. Decades after his death it was claimed that Brambell was homosexual but Brambell himself asserted &quot;I&#x27;m not a homosexual ... The very thought disgusts me.&quot;

==Death==
Brambell died of cancer at his home in Westminster, London, aged 72, on 18 January 1985. He was cremated on 25 January 1985 at Streatham Park Cemetery, where his ashes were scattered. Just six people attended his funeral: his brother, his partner Raymond, Ray Galton and
Alan Simpson, a BBC representative, and his former co-star Corbett&#x27;s widow, Maureen.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Curse of Steptoe&quot;, a BBC television play about Brambell and his co-star Harry H. Corbett, was broadcast on 19 March 2008 on digital BBC channel BBC Four, featuring Phil Davis as Brambell. The first broadcast gained the channel its highest audience figures to date, based on overnight returns.

<text>Shrapnel Records is an American record label group founded by record producer Mike Varney. The group principally uses the &quot;Shrapnel Records&quot; record label, a guitar-oriented label which features shred guitar, hard rock, metal and progressive metal. In the 1990s, he also started the &quot;Tone Center Records&quot; and &quot;Blues Bureau International&quot; sublabels to promote fusion and blues.

Blues Bureau artists include Rick Derringer, Eric Gales, Marc Ford, Chris Duarte, Leslie West and Pat Travers.

Tone Center Records grew out of Varney&#x27;s admiration for the jazz fusion of the 1970s and groups such as The Tony Williams Lifetime, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Return to Forever, and Soft Machine. Tone Center&#x27;s early releases included drummer Steve Smith and guitarists Larry Coryell, Frank Gambale, and Scott Henderson.

== History ==
Guitarist Marty Friedman (formerly of Megadeth and Cacophony), one of the label&#x27;s most successful artists, first appeared on the album &quot;Unsung Guitar Heroes II&quot; in 1980 with the band Vixen. Vixen would later change their name to Hawaii and release the album &quot;One Nation Underground&quot; for Shrapnel. In 1981, a friend gave Mike Varney a tape featuring a 17-year-old Swedish guitarist named Yngwie Malmsteen. A year later, Malmsteen wrote to the label stating that he wanted to export his music to America. Varney, who started writing a column called &quot;Spotlight&quot; for &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine in 1982, featured Malmsteen in his February 1983 column. The record executive flew Yngwie to California and set him up with vocalist Ron Keel&#x27;s new band called Steeler. Steeler&#x27;s self-titled album became a best selling release for Shrapnel Records.

&quot;Blues Bureau&quot; was created as a subsidiary in 1992, as an American guitar oriented, blues, and blues rock independent record label.

The label was acquired by The Orchard, subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment, in November 2015.

== Related labels ==
In 1989, Mike Varney co-founded progressive rock/metal label Magna Carta Records.

<text>Ivan Klíma (born Ivan Kauders, 14 September 1931) is a Czech novelist and playwright. He has received the Magnesia Litera award and the Franz Kafka Prize, among other honors.

== Biography ==
Klíma&#x27;s early childhood in Prague was happy and uneventful, but this all changed with the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938, after the Munich Agreement. He had been unaware that both his parents had Jewish ancestry; neither were observant Jews, but this was immaterial to the Germans.

In November 1941, first his father Vilém Klíma and then, in December, he and his mother and brother, were ordered to leave for the concentration camp at Theriesenstadt (Terezín), where he was to remain until liberation by the Red Army in May 1945. Both he and his parents survived incarceration, a miracle at that time, as Terezín was a holding camp for Jews from central and southern Europe and was regularly cleared of its overcrowded population by transports to &quot;the East&quot;—to death camps such as Auschwitz. The family adopted the less German-sounding surname of Klíma after the war.

Klíma has written graphically of this period in articles in the UK literary magazine, &quot;Granta&quot;, particularly &quot;A Childhood in Terezin&quot;. He has written that &quot;anyone who has been through a concentration camp as a child, who has been completely dependent on an external power which can at any moment come in and beat or kill him and everyone around him - probably moves through life at least a bit differently from people who have been spared such an education. That life can be snapped like a piece of string - that was my daily lesson as a child.&quot;

With the post-war rise of the Czech Communist regime and proxy Soviet control, Klima became a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Eventually, his childhood hopes of triumphs of good over evil became an adult awareness that it was often &quot;not the forces of good and evil that do battle with each other, but merely two different evils, in competition for the control of the world&quot;.

The early show trials and murders of those who opposed the new regime had begun with this new regime, and Klíma&#x27;s father was again imprisoned, this time by his own countrymen. 

During the Prague Spring of 1968 Klíma was a leading dissident voice. At the time of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, Klíma was in London, on his way to teaching engagement in Michigan. He however returned to Prague in March 1970. Although he was then deprived of his passport and forced to work in menial jobs, he remained part of the literary &#x27;underground&#x27;, smuggling books and involved in samizdat. On the overthrow of communism in 1989 Klíma was a leading supporter of Vaclav Havel.

==Writing==
Ivan Klíma was awarded Franz Kafka Prize in 2002 as a second recipient. His two-volume memoir &quot;Moje šílené století&quot; (&quot;My Crazy Century&quot;) won the Czech literary prize, the Magnesia Litera, in the non-fiction category in 2010. My Crazy Century was published in English in 2013 by Grove Press.

<doc id="887587" wikidata="Q2249142" url="?curid=887587" title="Creatio ex materia">
<text>Creatio ex materia is the notion that the universe was formed out of eternal, pre-existing matter. This is in contrast to the notion of &quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot;, where the universe is created out of nothing. The idea of &quot;creatio ex materia&quot; is found in ancient near eastern cosmology, early Greek cosmology such as is in the works of Homer and Hesiod, and across the board in ancient Greek philosophy. It was also held by a few early Christians, although &quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot; was the dominant concept among such writers. After the King Follet discourse, &quot;creatio ex materia&quot; came to be accepted in Mormonism. 

Greek philosophers came to widely frame the notion of &quot;creatio ex materia&quot; with the philosophical dictum &quot;nothing comes from nothing&quot; (; ). Although it is not clear if the dictum goes back to Parmenides (5th century BC) or the Milesian philosophers, a more common version of the expression was coined by Lucretius, who stated in his &quot;De rerum natura&quot; that &quot;nothing can be created out of nothing&quot;.

Alternatives to &quot;creatio ex materia&quot; include &quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot; (&quot;creation from nothing&quot;); &quot;creatio ex deo&quot; (&quot;creation from God&quot;), referring to a derivation of the cosmos from the substance of God either partially (in panentheism) or completely (in pandeism), and &quot;creatio continua&quot; (ongoing divine creation).

== Greek philosophy ==
Greek philosophers widely accepted the notion that creation acted on eternally existing, uncreated matter. Parmenides&#x27; articulation of the dictum that &quot;nothing comes from nothing&quot; is first attested in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot;:

In English translation:

Though commonly credited to Parmenides, some historians believe that the dictum instead historically traces back to the Milesian philosophers. In any case, Parmenides believed that non-existence could neither give rise to existence (genesis), nor could something that exists cease to exist (perishing). That which does not exist has no causal powers, and therefore could not give rise to something.

A typical expression of it can be found in the writings of Plutarch, which conditions that the structured and formed things that exist now derive from earlier, unformed and unshaped matter. Therefore, the creation act was the process of ordering this unordered matter.

The Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius expressed this principle in his first book of &quot;De rerum natura&quot; (&quot;On the Nature of Things&quot;) (1.149–214). According to his argument, if something could come from nothing, it would be commonplace to observe something coming from nothing all the time, even to witness any animal emerge fully-made or to see trees at one point bearing an apple but later producing a pear. This is because there is no prerequisite for what would come out of nothing, as prior causes or matter would have no place in limiting what comes into existence. In short, Lucretius believed that &quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot; would lead to a lack of regularity in nature.

In their interaction with earlier Greek philosophers who accepted this argument/dictum, Christian authors who accepted &quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot;, like Origen, simply denied the essential premise that something cannot come from nothing, and viewed it as a presumption of a limitation of God&#x27;s power; God was seen as in fact able to create something out of nothing.

<text>Franz Carl Heimito, [[Ritter]] von Doderer, known as Heimito von Doderer (; 5 September 189623 December 1966), was an Austrian writer.

== Family ==

Heimito von Doderer was born in Weidlingau, which has been part of the 14th District of Vienna since 1938, in a forester&#x27;s lodge where his family stayed while his father, the architect and engineer (1854, Klosterbruck (), Znaim 1932, Vienna) worked on the regulation of the Wien River. The lodge was not preserved; today a memorial marks the site. Wilhelm Carl Doderer also worked on the construction of the Tauern Railway, the Kiel Canal and the Wiener Stadtbahn public transport network. His brother Richard (18761955) and his father (1825, Heilbronn 1900, Vienna; ennobled in 1877) were also noted architects and industrialists. Carl Wilhelm&#x27;s wife Maria von (18351914) was related through her mother to the Austrian poet Nikolaus Lenau.

Doderer&#x27;s mother, Wilhelm Carl&#x27;s wife Louise Wilhelmine &quot;Willy&quot; von Hügel (18621946), was the daughter of the established German building contractor Heinrich von Hügel (18281899), who had worked with her later husband on several railway projects. Her sister Charlotte married (1859, Vienna 1936, Vienna), son of Heinrich von Ferstel, architect of the Vienna Votive Church. Max von Ferstel designed the plans for the Doderer family home in the Vienna Landstraße district.

Until World War I, the Doderer family ranked among the wealthiest industrial dynasties of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Heimito was the youngest of six children. His unusual first name was a German phonetic spelling of the Spanish name &quot;Jaimito&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;Jaime&quot; (James). As Louise Wilhelmine was Protestant, her children likewise were baptised Protestant, although they grew up in a mainly Catholic environment.

== Life and work ==
Heimito von Doderer spent most of his life in Vienna, where he attended the gymnasium (secondary school) with moderate success. He spent his summers in his family&#x27;s retreat in Reichenau an der Rax. The adolescent entered into a homoerotic romantic affair with his home tutor and gained bisexual and sadomasochistic experiences as a frequent brothel visitor. In 1914, he narrowly passed his matura exams and enrolled to study law at the University of Vienna; however, in April 1915 he joined the dragoon regiment No. 3 of the Austro-Hungarian Army and served in the mounted infantry at the Eastern Front in Galicia and Bukovina. On 12 July 1916 (during the Brusilov Offensive) he was captured as a prisoner of war by the Imperial Russian Army in the area of Tlumach.

A long way from home, in a Russian Far East camp for officer POWs in Krasnaya Rechka near Khabarovsk, he decided to become an author and began writing. Upon the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk he was released by the Bolshevik government but had to make his way back to Austria through the Russian Civil War. Stranded in Samara, Doderer and his comrades again turned to the East, finding refuge in a Red Cross camp near Krasnoyarsk, cared for by Elsa Brändström. Many men had died from typhoid fever during their flight. Doderer stayed in Siberia until his eventual return to Austria in 1920; he finally reached Vienna on 14 August.

His first published work, the book of poems &quot;Gassen und Landschaft&quot; (&quot;Streets and countryside&quot;), appeared in 1923, followed by the novel &quot;Die Bresche&quot; (&quot;The breach&quot;) in 1924, both with little success. A second novel, &quot;Das Geheimnis des Reichs&quot; (&quot;The secret of the empire&quot;), was published in 1930. In the same year he married Gusti Hasterlik, but they separated two years later and were divorced in 1938.

In 1933 Doderer joined the Austrian section of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) and published several stories in the &quot;Deutschösterreichische Tages-Zeitung&quot; (&quot;German-Austrian Daily&quot;), a newspaper closely linked to the party and promoting racism and the incorporation of Austria into Nazi Germany. In 1936 he moved to Dachau, Germany, where he met Emma Maria Thoma, who would become his second wife in 1952. In Germany, he renewed his NSDAP membership (the Austrian Nazi Party had been banned since 1933). He returned to Vienna in 1938, sharing a flat with the celebrated painter Albert Paris Gütersloh. In that year his novel &quot;Ein Mord, den jeder begeht&quot; (&quot;Every Man a Murderer&quot;) was published. He converted to Catholicism in 1940 as a result of his reading of Thomas Aquinas and his alienation from the Nazis, which had been growing for some years. Also in 1940, Doderer was called up to the Wehrmacht and was later posted to German-occupied France, where he began work on his most celebrated novel &quot;Die Strudlhofstiege&quot; (the name refers to the so-called Strudlhofstiege, an outdoor staircase in Vienna). Due to ill health, he was allowed in 1943 to return from France, serving in the Vienna area, before a final posting to Oslo at the end of the war.

After his return to Austria in early 1946, he was banned from publishing until 1947. He continued work on &quot;Die Strudlhofstiege&quot;, but although he completed it in 1948, the still-obscure author was unable to get it published immediately. However, when it did finally appear in 1951, it was a huge success, and Doderer&#x27;s place in the post-war Austrian literary scene was assured. Doderer subsequently returned to an earlier unfinished project, &#x27;Die Dämonen&quot; (&quot;The demons&quot;), which appeared in 1956 to much acclaim. In 1958 he began work on what was intended to be a four-volume novel under the general title of &quot;Roman Nr. 7&quot; (&quot;Novel No. 7&quot;), to be written as a counterpart to Beethoven&#x27;s Seventh Symphony. The first volume &#x27;, appeared in 1963; the second volume, &quot;Der Grenzwald&quot;, was to be his last work and was published, incomplete and posthumously, in 1967. Doderer died in Vienna of intestinal cancer on 23 December 1966.

<text>Public roads in Romania are ranked according to importance and traffic as follows:
*motorways (autostradă – pl. autostrăzi) – colour: green; designation: A followed by one or two digits
*expressways (drum – pl. drumuri express) – colour: red; designation: DEx followed by one or two digits and an optional letter
*national road (drum național – pl. drumuri naționale) – colour: red; designation: DN followed by one or two digits and an optional letter
*county road (drum județean – pl. drumuri județene) – colour: blue; designation: DJ followed by three digits and an optional letter; unique numbers per county
*local road (drum – pl. drumuri comunale) – colour: yellow; designated DC followed by a number and an optional letter; unique numbers per county

Some of the national roads are part of the European route scheme. European routes passing through Romania: E58; E60; E70; E85; E79; E81; E68; E87 (Class A); E574; E576; E581; E583; E671; E771.

As of 31 December 2021, public roads totaled : 17,530 km (20.3%) national roads, 35,096 km (40.7%) county roads and 33,573 km (39%) local roads.

From the point of view of the type of cover, the structure of the public road network registers at the end of 2022 was: 41,653 km (48,2%) modernized roads (94,1% with asphalt pavements of heavy/medium type and 5.9% with concrete), 20,956  km (24.3%) with light-duty asphalt surface, 15,713 km (18,2%) stone paving (such as sett paving or cobblestone roads) and 8,014  km (9,3%) dirt roads.

Regarding the technical condition, 29,9% of modernized roads and 41,1% of roads with light road clothing have exceeded their &quot;service life&quot;.

==Motorways==
Development of the overall length (at the end of):


Motorways are identified by A followed by a number. As of April 2024, Romania has 1,098 km of motorway in use, with another 720 km under construction. In recent years, a master plan for the national motorway network has been developed and many works have begun around the country, which will result in significant changes by 2015, and eventually by 2022.

There are few tolls for using roads in Romania. There is one at the Giurgeni – Vadu Oii Bridge over the river Danube on highway DN2A at Vadu Oii and one at the Cernavodă Bridge, on the A2 motorway, a 17 km long section between Fetești and Cernavodă which consists of two road/railway bridges. Nevertheless, every owner of a car that uses a motorway (A) or a national road (DN) in Romania must purchase a vignette (rovinietă) from any of the main petrol stations or at any post office throughout the country.

==Expressways==
Planned expressways according to CNADNR (Romanian National Company of Motorways and National Roads):

==National roads==

Total length (including European routes and Highways) of National Roads in 2019 is 17,873 km (11105.77 mi), an increase from 17,272 km (10,732 mi) in 2015. The majority of National Roads (DN) are single carriageway, with only 12.5% being dual carriageway. A major problem being that many National Roads (drumuri naționale) have no ring roads around cities and towns, disrupting the traffic flow (i.e. making traffic condition more difficult).

In 2019 16,088 km (9,996 mi) of National Roads are asphalt concrete roads of heavy/medium type, 880 km (546.8 mi) concrete roads and 720 km (447 mi) of light asphalt road &quot;clothing&quot;. 54.7% of heavy/medium roads and 79.4% of light asphalt roads have exceeded their &quot;service life&quot; and are in need of some form of repair or replacement.

Seven one-digit national roads start off in Bucharest in a radial pattern.

<text>Josef Škvorecký (; September 27, 1924 – January 3, 2012) was a Czech-Canadian writer and publisher. He spent half of his life in Canada, publishing and supporting banned Czech literature during the communist era. Škvorecký was awarded the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in 1980. He and his wife were long-time supporters of Czech dissident writers before the fall of communism in that country. Škvorecký&#x27;s fiction deals with several themes: the horrors of totalitarianism and repression, the expatriate experience, and the miracle of jazz.

==Life==
Born the son of a bank clerk in Náchod, Czechoslovakia, Škvorecký graduated in 1943 from the Reálné &quot;gymnasium&quot; in his native Náchod. He had a youthful love-affair with jazz and was an amateur tenor saxophone player in the period just prior to the Second World War, an experience he drew upon for his novella &quot;The Bass Saxophone&quot; (1967). For two years during the War he was a slave labourer in a Messerschmitt aircraft factory in Náchod.

After the war, he began to study at the Faculty of Medicine of Charles University in Prague, but after his first term he moved to the Faculty of Arts, where he studied philosophy and graduated in 1949. In 1951 he gained a PhD in philosophy. He then taught for two years at the Social School for Girls in Hořice. Between 1952 and 1954 he performed his military service in the Czechoslovak Army.

He worked briefly as a teacher, editor and translator in the 1950s. In this period he completed several novels including his first novel &quot;The Cowards&quot; (written 1948–49, published 1958) and &quot;The End of the Nylon Age&quot; (1956). They were condemned and banned by the Communist authorities after their publication. His prose style, open-ended and improvisational, was an innovation, but this and his democratic ideals were a challenge to the Communist regime. As a result, he lost his job as editor of the magazine &quot;Světová literatura&quot; (&quot;World Literature&quot;). Škvorecký kept writing, and helped nurture the democratic movement that culminated in the Prague Spring in 1968.

After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia that year, Škvorecký and his wife, writer and actress Zdena Salivarová, fled to Canada.

In 1971, he and his wife founded 68 Publishers which, over the next 20 years, published banned Czech and Slovak books. The imprint became an important mouthpiece for dissident writers, such as Václav Havel, Milan Kundera, and Ludvík Vaculík, among many others. For providing this critical literary outlet, the president of post-Communist Czechoslovakia, Václav Havel, later awarded the couple the Order of the White Lion in 1990.

He taught at the Department of English at the University of Toronto where he was eventually appointed Professor Emeritus of English and Film. He retired in 1990. In Canada, he is considered to be a Canadian author despite the fact that he is mostly published in Czech.

==Literary works==
Most of Škvorecký&#x27;s novels are available in English: the novels &quot;The Cowards&quot;, &quot;Miss Silver&#x27;s Past&quot;, &quot;The Republic of Whores&quot;, &quot;The Miracle Game&quot;, &quot;The Swell Season&quot;, &quot;The Engineer of Human Souls&quot; which won a Canadian Governor General&#x27;s Award, &quot;The Bride of Texas&quot;, &quot;Dvořák in Love&quot;, &quot;The Tenor Saxophonist&#x27;s Story&quot;, &quot;Two Murders in My Double Life&quot;, &quot;An Inexplicable Story or The Narrative of Questus Firmus Siculus&quot;, his selected short stories &quot;When Eve Was Naked&quot; and the two short novels &quot;The Bass Saxophone&quot; and &quot;Emöke&quot;. A recurring character in several of his novels is Danny Smiricky, who is a partial self-portrait of the author.

He wrote four books of detective stories featuring Lieutenant Boruvka of the Prague Homicide Bureau: &quot;The Mournful Demeanor of Lieutenant Boruvka&quot;, &quot;Sins for Father Knox&quot;, &quot;The End of Lieutenant Boruvka&quot; and &quot;The Return of Lieutenant Boruvka&quot;.

His poetry was published as a collection in 1999 as &quot;...there&#x27;s no remedy for this pain&quot; (...&quot;na tuhle bolest nejsou prášky&quot;).

His non-fiction works include &quot;Talkin&#x27; Moscow Blues&quot;, a book of essays on jazz, literature and politics, an autobiography &quot;Headed for the Blues&quot;, and two books on the Czech cinema including &quot;All the Bright Young Men and Women&quot;.

In Middle Europe, he was also a well-known Cthulhu Mythos expert, who wrote many prefaces to H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s works.

Škvorecký wrote for films and television. The feature film &quot;The Tank Battalion&quot; was adapted from his novel &quot;The Republic of Whores&quot;. Other features, written for Prague TV, include &quot;Eine kleine Jazzmusik&quot;, adapted from his story of the same name, &quot;The Emöke Legend&quot; from a novella of the same name, and a two-hour TV drama &quot;Poe and the Murder of a Beautiful Girl&quot;, based on Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s story &quot;The Mystery of Marie Roget&quot;. Three very successful TV serials were made from his stories: &quot;Sins for Father Knox&quot;, &quot;The Swell Season&quot; and &quot;Murders for Luck&quot;.

A film version of the novel &quot;Pastor&#x27;s End&quot; was produced in 1968, but was never shown and went straight into locked Communist archives due to the fact that its author &quot;illegally&quot; fled the country. In the spring and summer of 1968 Škvorecký and the Czech film director Miloš Forman jointly wrote a script synopsis to make a film version of &quot;The Cowards&quot;. After Škvorecký fled the Warsaw Pact invasion the synopsis was translated into English, but no film was made. In the 21st century the English translation was translated back into Czech and has been published.

Prominent in his writing for radio was a long-running monthly series on literature for Voice of America. From 1973 to 1990 he wrote more than 200 of these shows covering notable literary works and discussing literary themes.

He died on January 3, 2012, in Toronto, Ontario, from cancer; he was 87 years old.

==Awards==
Among his numerous literary awards are the Neustadt International Prize for Literature (1980), the Canadian Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language fiction (1984), the Czech Republic State Prize for Literature (1999), the Prize of the Comenius Pangea Foundation &quot;For Improvement of Human Affairs&quot; (2001) which he received with the Polish film director Andrzej Wajda as well as the Angelus Award (2009).

Nominated for the Nobel Prize in 1982.

Awarded the Order of the White Lion by the President of Czechoslovakia, Václav Havel, 1990.

In 1992 he was made a Member of the Order of Canada.

Škvorecký was a Guggenheim Fellow, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, République Française, 1996.

<text>Samuel Sharpe, or Sharp (1801 – 23 May 1832), also known as Sam Sharpe, was an enslaved Jamaican who was the leader of the widespread 1831–32 Baptist War slave rebellion (also known as the Christmas Rebellion) in Jamaica.

He was proclaimed a National Hero of Jamaica on 31 March 1982 and his image is on the $50 Jamaican banknote.

== Biography ==
Samuel Sharpe was born into slavery in the parish of St James, Jamaica, on a plantation owned by Samuel and Batty Sharpe. The Slave Return of 1832 announcing his death gave his name as Archer aka Samuel Sharpe, the son of Eve, and he was only 28 years old when he died. The Slave Return of Samuel and Jane Sharpe in 1817 showed a young 12-year-old Archer on the plantation with his mother Juda Bligom and siblings Joe (two years old) and Eliza (20 years old). He was allowed to become educated, for which he was well respected by his enslaved peers.

Sharpe became a well-known preacher, leader and missionary in the Baptist Church, which had long welcomed the enslaved as members and recognized them as preachers. He was a deacon at the Burchell Baptist Church in Montego Bay, whose pastor was Rev. Thomas Burchell, a missionary from England. Sharpe spent most of his time travelling to different parishes in Jamaica, educating the enslaved about Christianity, which he believed promised freedom.

== Baptist War ==
Where possible, the enslaved closely followed the British Parliament&#x27;s discussions surrounding the abolition of slavery. In the mistaken belief that emancipation had already been granted by the Queen of India, Sharpe organised a peaceful general strike across many estates in western Jamaica to protest working conditions. This took place during the harvest of sugar cane, a critical time for the plantation owners: generally the workforce had to work overtime to process the cane quickly at its peak. The Christmas Rebellion (Baptist War) began on 27 December 1831 at the Kensington Estate. Reprisals by the plantation owners led to the rebels&#x27; burning the crops.

Sharpe&#x27;s originally peaceful protest turned into Jamaica&#x27;s largest slave rebellion. The uprising lasted for 10 days and spread throughout the entire island, mobilizing as many as 60,000 of Jamaica&#x27;s enslaved population. The colonial government used the armed Jamaican military forces and warriors from the towns of the Jamaican Maroons to put down the rebellion, suppressing it within two weeks. Some 14 whites were killed by armed slave battalions, but more than 200 slaves were killed by troops. Afterwards, more reprisals followed. The government tried, convicted, and hanged many of the leaders, including Sharpe, in 1832. A total of 310 to 340 were executed through the judicial process, including many for purely property offences such as theft of livestock.

In the months leading up to his execution, while in jail, Sharpe had several meetings with Rev. Henry Bleby, a missionary, who reported that Sharpe told him: &quot;I would rather die upon yonder gallows than live my life in slavery.&quot; The rebellion and government response provoked two detailed Parliamentary Inquiries. The Jamaican government&#x27;s severe reprisals in the aftermath of the rebellion are believed to have contributed to passage by Parliament of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 and final abolition of slavery across the British Empire in 1838.

== Legacy ==
* In 1982, the government of independent Jamaica proclaimed Sharpe a National Hero, with the posthumous title of Rt. Excellent Samuel Sharpe.
* Also in 1975, Sam Sharpe Teachers&#x27; College was founded and named in his honour in Granville, a suburb of Montego Bay.
* Sharpe&#x27;s image is used on the modern Jamaican $50 bill pre-2023. In 2023 this was changed to the new $500 bill.
* The British jazz saxophonist Courtney Pine (of Jamaican parentage) included an instrumental composition &quot;Samuel Sharpe&quot; as a tribute on his 2012 album &quot;House of Legends&quot;.
* Sam Sharpe is referenced by Vybz Kartel in his 2019 song &quot;Stand Strong&quot;.
* &quot;Daddy Sharpe: A Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Samuel Sharpe, West Indian Slave – Written by Himself, 1832&quot;, a fictionalized account of Sharpe&#x27;s life, by Fred W. Kennedy, was published in 2008.

<text>SSN is a techno-thriller novel, created by Tom Clancy and Martin H. Greenberg and published on December 1, 1996, as a tie-in to the video game of the same name. It follows the missions of , a United States Navy nuclear attack submarine, during a fictional war between the United States and China over the Spratly Islands. &quot;SSN&quot; is the second Clancy novel after &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; (1986) that is not set in the Ryanverse.

The book also features the transcript of a discussion of the game with Clancy and former Royal Navy submarine commander Doug Littlejohns, which was held in Greek Island, a former government-owned fallout shelter located in West Virginia. The interview was originally released along with the CD-ROM of the game.

==Plot summaries==
=== Preface: &quot;Prelude to War&quot; ===
In 1997, former Chinese Communist Party leader Deng Xiaoping dies, creating a power struggle within the Chinese government. Premier Li Peng later takes over in a coup d&#x27;etat and orders the arrest of his political rivals, particularly Deng&#x27;s technical successor Jiang Zemin. He then orders an invasion of the Spratly Islands, where a large oil deposit was recently discovered by an American oil company. A Chinese attacks the American aircraft carrier , prompting one of her escort submarines to sink the Chinese sub in retaliation and killing everyone aboard. War between the two countries becomes imminent.

=== &quot;First Blood&quot; ===
, a commanded by Captain Bartholomew Mackey, deploys from San Diego to Pearl Harbor to join the conflict in the South China Sea. Initially ordered to fire on any Chinese submarines only in self defense, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; encounters and later sinks a when the latter fires first. With the war now underway, Mackey bears witness to the sinking of another enemy sub near Pearl Harbor.

=== &quot;South China Sea Station&quot; ===
&quot;Cheyenne&quot; is diverted from her initial destination in Pearl Harbor and is ordered to proceed to South China Sea and escort the aircraft carrier . Along the way, she sinks a Chinese Luda-class destroyer and its escort , which are in the area to lay mines and attack &quot;Independence&quot;. She additionally cripples a Chinese task group as well as another Romeo-class sub before meeting with &quot;Independence&quot;.

=== &quot;Four if by Sea, Six if by Land&quot; ===
Initially assigned as the advance escort for the &quot;Independence&quot; carrier group, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; receives orders to proceed to Spratly Islands and destroy a Chinese submarine base there. Along the way, it scores kills on another Luda-class destroyer and two more enemy subs.

=== &quot;Dogfight&quot; ===
&quot;Cheyenne&quot; meets up with the submarine tender in Sulu Sea for supplies and debriefing. Its new orders are to sink any Chinese submarines and surface ships in contact. While managing to destroy one Han-class and three s, Mackey discovers the existence of a Russian joining the Chinese.

=== &quot;Interdiction&quot; ===
&quot;Cheyenne&quot; is once again assigned to patrol duty on the &quot;Independence&quot; carrier group. Tasked to attack a Chinese surface task group from north of the Spratlys, Mackey prevents two Chinese-crewed Alfa-class submarines from attacking an American frigate by sinking them. After successfully sinking the surface task group, it later fends off a Ming-class submarine from sinking &quot;McKee&quot; before meeting up with the latter.

=== &quot;Ambush&quot; ===
&quot;Cheyenne&quot; is tasked to patrol several abandoned oil rigs in the Spratlys. It destroys a Chinese submarine depot there, as well as a Kilo-class submarine.

=== &quot;Target: Convoy&quot; ===
&quot;Cheyenne&quot; is dispatched to cripple a Chinese merchant group entering the Spratlys from the mainland, later managing to evade an attacking Romeo-class submarine.

=== &quot;Patrol&quot; ===
Mackey is informed that the Chinese Navy is aware of his submarine&#x27;s actions and is deploying all their ships to hunt down and sink &quot;Cheyenne&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; is assigned to patrol routine in the Spratlys as well as to destroy Chinese airfields and runways with Tomahawk missiles near the Philippine island of Palawan. Mackey later scores kills on three Chinese-crewed Alfa-class submarines.

=== &quot;The Fourth Patrol: From Russia with Love&quot; ===
After completing its patrol duties, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; makes a quick stop at the former United States military base in Subic Bay, Philippines. After undergoing weapons replenishment from &quot;McKee&quot; and maintenance through the floating dry dock &quot;Arco&quot;, the submarine is assigned to sink six s with experienced Russian personnel embedded within the Chinese crews before they reach the Paracel Islands north of Spratlys.

=== &quot;Rescue&quot; ===
A SEAL Team One unit recaptures the American oil drillship &quot;Benthic Adventure&quot; from the Chinese in the Spratlys. With the ship now being escorted by the &quot;Independence&quot; carrier battle group to safety, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; is assigned to join the convoy and protect the ship from any Chinese submarines in the area. Along with the &quot;Independence&quot; carrier group, they later ward off several attacking Chinese vessels intent on sinking &quot;Benthic Adventure&quot;.

=== &quot;Battle Royale&quot; ===
After failing to recapture &quot;Benthic Adventure&quot;, the Chinese Navy sends over sixty ships and submarines from the mainland to attack the &quot;Independence&quot; carrier battle group. &quot;Cheyenne&quot; takes part in sinking most of the Chinese fleet.

=== &quot;Strait Up&quot; ===
Former Chinese leader Zemin resurfaces in Taiwan, having been smuggled out of China by . &quot;Cheyenne&quot; is assigned to reconnoiter the mine-infested Formosa Strait in order to find a safe passage for the deposed Chinese premier&#x27;s eventual return to the mainland. Mackey scores kills on a Kilo-class submarine and two Luda-class destroyers.

=== &quot;Typhoon Hunt&quot; ===
&quot;Cheyenne&quot; is deployed to sink a Russian-crewed Typhoon-class submarine operating in the South China Sea, along with its &quot;Akula&quot;-class escorts. In the ensuing attack, one remaining &quot;Akula&quot;-class submarine manages to escape.

=== &quot;Hornets&#x27; Nest&quot; ===
&quot;Cheyenne&quot; continues patrolling the eastern side of Taiwan to &quot;sanitize&quot; the area of enemy submarines. Surviving an ambush, she scores kills on five &quot;Akula&quot;-class submarines (including one that had escaped earlier) and two Kilo-class submarines.

=== &quot;Special Delivery&quot; ===
&quot;Cheyenne&quot; is tasked with transporting Zemin to mainland China to negotiate a ceasefire to the ongoing conflict with Chinese Premier Peng. It manages to sink the Sino-Russian next-generation nuclear attack submarine &quot;Mao&quot;, which has been aggressively pursuing &quot;Cheyenne&quot;. After Zemin retakes his position as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, he declares a ceasefire ending the war in the South China Sea. Mackey is later honored by the Chinese and American governments.

<text>The Prix Révélation (Prize of Revelation or Debut Prize) is one of the prizes awarded by the Angoulême International Comics Festival. This prize honors cartoonists who are early in their career.

Some version of the prize has been awarded almost every year since the first festival in 1974. At first it was called the Prize of Best Hope (&quot;prix du meilleur espoir&quot;), then in 1985 it was reborn as the Prize for Best First Album (&quot;prix du meilleur premier album&quot;). In 1989, as the whole award ceremony was renamed after Hergé&#x27;s unfinished book &quot;Alph-Art&quot;, this prize became the Alph-Art coup de cœur and was awarded to authors with up to three published works. From 2003-2006 the award was again called Best First Album (&quot;meilleur premier album&quot;), then in 2007 was renamed the &quot;Prix Révélation&quot;, which is still its name as of 2018.

<text>The Battle of the North Cape was a Second World War naval battle that occurred on 26 December 1943, as part of the Arctic campaign. The , on an operation to attack Arctic convoys of war materiel from the western Allies to the Soviet Union, was brought to battle and sunk by the Royal Navy&#x27;s battleship with cruisers and destroyers, including an onslaught from the destroyer of the exiled Royal Norwegian Navy, off the North Cape, Norway.

The battle was the last between British and German big-gun capital ships. The outcome increased the British advantage in major surface units. It was also the penultimate engagement between battleships in history, the last being the October 1944 Battle of Surigao Strait.

==Background==
Since August 1941, the western Allies had run convoys of ships from the United Kingdom and Iceland to the northern ports of the Soviet Union to provide essential supplies for their war effort on the Eastern Front. These endured much hardship, frequently attacked by German naval and air forces stationed in occupied Norway. A key concern were German &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; battleships such as and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;. Even the threat of these ships&#x27; presence was enough to cause disastrous consequences for the convoys, such as Convoy PQ 17 that was scattered and mostly sunk by German forces after false reports of the &quot;Tirpitz&quot; sailing to intercept them. To ward off the threat of Germany&#x27;s capital ships in the Arctic and to escort convoys with a high level of success, the Royal Navy had to outlay great assets.

Operation Ostfront was an attempt by the German &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; to intercept the expected Arctic convoys. In late December 1943, there was a Russia-bound convoy JW 55B consisting of 19 cargo vessels under the command of the Commodore, retired Rear-Admiral Maitland Boucher, accompanied by a close escort of two destroyers, and , among others, and an ocean escort of eight Home Fleet destroyers led by . Also in the area was convoy RA 55A, returning to the United Kingdom from Russia, consisting of 22 cargo ships, accompanied by a close escort of two destroyers and four other vessels, and an ocean escort of six Home Fleet destroyers led by . It had arrived safely at Murmansk with its normal escorts and the additional protection by Force 1, commanded by Vice Admiral Robert Burnett, consisting of the cruiser , the flagship, and the cruisers and .

Escorting the convoys to Russia was the responsibility of the Home Fleet and its commander-in-chief, Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser. Fraser wished to neutralise &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, a major threat to the convoys, and planned a confrontation over Christmas 1943 in which convoy JW 55B would be used to draw out the enemy. Fraser expected and hoped that &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; would attempt to attack JW 55B. At a conference of the captains of the ships in his force Fraser described his plan to intercept &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; at a position between the convoy and the enemy&#x27;s Norwegian base. He would then approach the enemy to within in the Arctic night, illuminate &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; with star shell, and open fire using .

Convoy JW 55B had left Loch Ewe on 20 December and was sighted two days later by a &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft which commenced shadowing. By 23 December it was clear to the British from intelligence reports that the convoy had been sighted and was being shadowed by enemy aircraft. Fraser then put to sea with Force 2 consisting of his flagship the battleship , the cruiser and S-class destroyers , , , and of the exiled Royal Norwegian Navy. Fraser was anxious not to discourage &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; from leaving its base, so did not approach before it was necessary to do so. As JW 55B and its escorts approached the area of greatest danger on the same day, the 23rd, travelling slowly eastward off the coast of north Norway, Burnett and Force 1 set out westward from Murmansk while Fraser with Force 2 approached at moderate speed from the west. On 25 December, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; (under Captain Fritz Hintze) with the s , , , and left Norway&#x27;s Altafjord under the overall command of &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; Erich Bey. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; set course for the convoy&#x27;s reported position as a south-westerly gale developed.

==Battle==

Fraser received confirmation from the Admiralty in the early hours of 26 December that &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was at sea and searching for convoy JW 55B. The stormy weather had resulted in the grounding of all &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; reconnaissance planes. With no ability to search for the British ships from the air and heavy seas hampering the movement of his ships, Rear Admiral Bey was unable to locate the convoy. Despite a German U-boat spotting the convoy and reporting its position, Bey was still not able to make contact with the British ships. Thinking he had overshot the enemy, he detached his destroyers and sent them southward to increase the search area, and the destroyers subsequently lost contact with their flagship. Fraser, preparing for the German attack, had diverted the returning empty convoy RA 55A northward, out of the area in which it was expected, and ordered JW 55B to reverse course to allow him to close. He later ordered four of the destroyers with RA 55A; , , and , to detach and join him.
The unescorted &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; encountered Burnett&#x27;s Force 1 shortly after 09:00. &quot;Belfast&quot; was the first ship to obtain radar contact on &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, and the British cruisers rapidly closed the range. At a distance of nearly , the British cruisers opened fire and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; responded with her own salvoes. While no hits were scored on the British ships, the German battleship was struck twice, with one shell destroying the forward Seetakt radar controls and leaving &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; virtually blind in a mounting snowstorm. Without radar, gunners aboard the German battleship were forced to aim at the enemy&#x27;s muzzle flashes. This was made more difficult because two of the British cruisers were using a new flashless propellant. Bey, believing he had engaged a battleship, turned south in an attempt to distance himself from the pursuers and perhaps draw them away from the convoy.

&quot;Scharnhorst&#x27;s&quot; superior speed allowed Bey to shake off his pursuers, after which he turned northeast in an attempt to circle round them and attack the undefended convoy. Burnett, instead of giving chase in sea conditions that were limiting his cruisers&#x27; speed to , correctly guessed Bey&#x27;s intentions and positioned Force 1 so as to protect the convoy. It was a decision that he had some personal doubts about as it would result in the cruisers losing contact with &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, and the decision was criticised by some of the British force&#x27;s other officers but supported by Fraser. To Burnett&#x27;s relief, shortly after noon, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was once again detected by the cruisers&#x27; radars as it attempted to approach the convoy. As fire was again exchanged, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; scored two hits on &quot;Norfolk&quot; with 11-inch shells, disabling a turret and her radar. Burnett&#x27;s destroyers were also unable to get close enough to &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; to launch a torpedo attack on the German ship. Following this exchange, Bey decided to return to port, while he ordered his destroyers to attack the convoy at a position reported by the U-boat earlier in the morning. The reported position was out of date, and the destroyers missed the convoy.

&quot;Scharnhorst&quot; ran south for several hours, once again taking advantage of its superior speed. Burnett pursued, but both &quot;Sheffield&quot; and &quot;Norfolk&quot; suffered engine problems and were forced to drop back, leaving the outgunned &quot;Belfast&quot; as the sole pursuer and dangerously exposed for a while. The lack of working radar aboard &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; prevented the Germans from taking advantage of the situation, allowing &quot;Belfast&quot; to reacquire the German ship on her radar set. Bey was unaware that his ship was now sailing into a trap, with Admiral Fraser&#x27;s main force steaming towards &quot;Scharnhorst&#x27;s&quot; position and perfectly placed to intercept the fleeing German ship. With &quot;Belfast&quot; sending a constant stream of radio signals on the &quot;Scharnhorst&#x27;s&quot; position, the battleship &quot;Duke of York&quot; battled through the rough seas to reach the German ship. Fraser sent his four escorting destroyers to press ahead and try to get into torpedo-launching positions. The main British force soon picked up &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; on radar at 16:15 and were manoeuvring to bring a full broadside to bear. At 16:17 &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was detected by &quot;Duke of York″&quot;s Type 273 radar at a range of and by 16:32 &quot;Duke of York″&quot;s Type 284 radar indicated that the range had closed to .

At 16:48, &quot;Belfast&quot; fired star shells to illuminate &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; which was unprepared, with her turrets trained fore and aft, and clearly visible from &quot;Duke of York&quot;. &quot;Duke of York&quot; opened fire at a range of and scored a hit on the first salvo, disabling &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;″s foremost turrets (&quot;Anton&quot; and &quot;Bruno&quot;), while another salvo destroyed the ship&#x27;s aeroplane hangar. Bey turned north, but was engaged by the cruisers &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Belfast&quot;, and turned east at a high speed of . &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was now being engaged on one side by &quot;Duke of York&quot; and &quot;Jamaica&quot; while Burnett&#x27;s cruisers engaged from the other side. The Germans took continuing heavy punishment from &quot;Duke of York&#x27;s&quot; 14-inch shells, and at 17:24 a desperate Bey signalled to Germany &quot;am surrounded by heavy units&quot;.
Bey was able to put some more distance between &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and the British ships to increase his prospects of success. Two 11-inch shells from one of her salvoes damaged the foremast of the &quot;Duke of York&quot;, severing some of the wireless aerials and spraying the superstructure and the upper deck with splinters, and, more serious still, knocking over the radar aerial to the Type 284 gunnery control radar set. These hits could not have been known to Bey, and Lt. Harold Bates, the electrical officer, despite the appalling conditions (a force 8 gale, darkness and substantial ice), climbed the mast, returned the aerial to the horizontal, and restarted the gyro-stabiliser so that within a few minutes the radar was working again. (After the battle, a myth arose that Bates had repaired the wires with his bare hands, leading to the nickname &quot;Barehand&quot; Bates.) &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;&#x27;s fortunes took a dramatic turn for the worse at 18:20 when a shell fired by &quot;Duke of York&quot; at extreme range pierced her belt armour and destroyed the No. 1 boiler room. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;″s speed dropped to only , and though immediate repair work allowed it to recover to , &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was now vulnerable to torpedo attacks by the destroyers. Five minutes later, Bey sent his final radio message to the German naval command: &quot;We will fight on until the last shell is fired.&quot; At 18:50 &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; turned to starboard to engage the destroyers &quot;Savage&quot; and &quot;Saumarez&quot;, but this allowed &quot;Scorpion&quot; and the Norwegian destroyer &quot;Stord&quot; to attack with torpedoes, scoring two hits on the starboard side. As &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; continued to turn to avoid the torpedoes, &quot;Savage&quot; and &quot;Saumarez&quot; scored three hits on her port side. &quot;Saumarez&quot; was hit several times by &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;″s secondary armament and suffered 11 killed and 11 wounded.

Due to the torpedo hits, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;″s speed again fell to , allowing &quot;Duke of York&quot; to rapidly close the range. With &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; illuminated by star shells &quot;hanging over her like a chandelier&quot;, &quot;Duke of York&quot; and &quot;Jamaica&quot; resumed fire, at a range of only . At 19:15, &quot;Belfast&quot; joined in from the north. The British vessels subjected the German ship to a deluge of shells, and the cruisers &quot;Jamaica&quot; and &quot;Belfast&quot; fired their remaining torpedoes at the slowing target. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;″s end came when the British destroyers &quot;Opportune&quot;, &quot;Virago&quot;, &quot;Musketeer&quot; and &quot;Matchless&quot; fired a further 19 torpedoes at her. Wracked with hits and unable to flee, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; finally capsized and sank at 19:45 on 26 December, her propellers still turning, at an estimated position of . She was later identified and filmed at . Of her total complement of 1,968, only 36 were pulled from the frigid waters, 30 by &quot;Scorpion&quot; and six by &quot;Matchless&quot;. Neither Rear Admiral Bey nor Captain Hintze were among those rescued (although both were reported seen in the water after the ship sank), nor were any other officers. British casualties, in contrast, were relatively light with only 21 killed and 11 wounded. The majority of British casualties occurred on &quot;Saumarez&quot;, with 11 of the destroyer&#x27;s sailors being killed as the ship attempted to close with &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;. HMS &quot;Norfolk&quot; suffered most of the remaining casualties with seven of her men being killed while the destroyer &quot;Scorpion&quot; also had one of its men missing in action. The Norwegian destroyer &quot;Stord&quot; also suffered losses when the rough sea washed two men over board during the chase; one was washed back onto the ship by another wave, and wounded, while the other was lost at sea. Fraser ordered the force to proceed to Murmansk, making a signal to the Admiralty: &quot;&quot;Scharnhorst&quot; sunk&quot;, to which the reply came: &quot;Grand, well done.&quot;

==Aftermath==
Later in the evening of 26 December, Admiral Fraser briefed his officers on board &quot;Duke of York&quot;: &quot;Gentlemen, the battle against &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; has ended in victory for us. I hope that if any of you are ever called upon to lead a ship into action against an opponent many times superior, you will command your ship as gallantly as &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was commanded today&quot;. After the battle Admiral Fraser sent the following message to the Admiralty: &quot;... Please convey to the C-in-C Norwegian Navy. &quot;Stord&quot; played a very daring role in the fight and I am very proud of her...&quot;. In an interview in the &quot;Evening News&quot; on 5 February 1944 the commanding officer of HMS &quot;Duke of York&quot;, Captain Guy Russell, said: &quot;... the Norwegian destroyer &quot;Stord&quot; carried out the most daring attack of the whole action...&quot;.

The loss of &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; demonstrated the vital importance of radar in modern naval warfare. While the German battleship should have been able to outgun all of her opponents save the battleship &quot;Duke of York&quot;, the early loss of radar-assisted fire control combined with the problem of inclement weather left her at a significant disadvantage. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was straddled by 31 of the 52 radar-fire-controlled salvoes fired by &quot;Duke of York&quot;. In the aftermath of the battle, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; commander, &quot;Großadmiral&quot; Karl Dönitz remarked, &quot;Surface ships are no longer able to fight without effective radar equipment.&quot;

The sinking of the &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was a major victory for the Allied war effort in the Arctic theatre and further altered the strategic balance at sea in their favour. The Battle of the North Cape took place only a few months after the successful Operation Source, which had severely damaged the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; with midget submarines as she lay at anchor in Norway. With &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; destroyed and Germany&#x27;s other battleships out of service, the Allies were now for the first time in the war free from the threat of German battleships raiding their convoys in the Arctic and Atlantic. This would allow the Allies to reallocate their naval resources that had been previously tied up to counter the threat of the German &#x27;fleet in being&#x27;. This would prove to be the final battle of battleships in European waters and was one of few major surface actions in the Second World War without air support.

<doc id="887629" wikidata="Q7570405" url="?curid=887629" title="Southern Rhodesia Liberal Party">
<text>The Southern Rhodesian Liberal Party was a political party in Southern Rhodesia, founded in 1943 by Jacob Smit (1881–1959), the former United Party (UP) Minister of Finance. It is thought that Smit split from the UP largely because Prime Minister Sir Godfrey Martin Huggins had failed to include him in the exclusive Second World War Defence Committee.

In his &quot;A History of Rhodesia&quot;, Robert Blake writes that Smit&#x27;s party, &quot;in accordance with the Rhodesian tradition of adopting the most misleading political nomenclature possible, called themselves &#x27;Liberals.&#x27;&quot; The party was, in fact, pronouncedly illiberal, and attempted to unite conservative, non-trade union opposition to the UP while opposing government economic regulation and the advancement of Black political interests. The Liberal Party did well in the 1946 general election, winning 12 out of 30 seats in the Southern Rhodesia Legislative Assembly, but in the 1948 general election it won only five seats and its support declined subsequently. It was to become one of the political precursors to the future Rhodesian Front (RF) party.

The Republic of the Rif is considered the first-ever independent non-monarchical modern Amazigh state.

After the Riffian victory, President Abd el-Krim and his Council of Ministers issued a document titled &quot;Government of the Rif Republic; Declaration of State and Proclamation to all Nations&quot; declaring the independence of the Rif from the Franco-Spanish colonial dominion and from the Arab-Alouite Sultan Yusef of Morocco.

<text>The United Federal Party (UFP) was a political party in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

==History==
The UFP was formed in November 1957 by a merger of the Federal Party, which had operated at the federal level, and the Southern Rhodesian United Rhodesia Party. However, after conservative elements gained control of the party, the liberal faction led by Garfield Todd broke away to re-establish the United Rhodesia Party.

In the 1958 general election in Southern Rhodesia the UFP won 17 of the 30 seats, despite receiving fewer votes than the Dominion Party, whilst the URP failed to win a seat. In the federal election in November 1958, the UFP won 46 of the 59 seats.

General elections in Northern Rhodesia in March 1959 saw the UFP win 13 of the 20 elected seats. In the August 1961 elections in Nyasaland the Malawi Congress Party won 22 seats (including two upper roll seats) and the UFP five (all from the upper roll).

The next federal elections in March 1962 were boycotted by all other parties, allowing the UFP to win 54 of the 57 seats. However, that was the end of the UFP&#x27;s success. In the Northern Rhodesian general elections in September the UFP won the most seats, but the Northern Rhodesian African National Congress, which held the balance of power, went back on a secret pact its leader Harry Nkumbula had made with the UFP and allowed the United National Independence Party to form the government. General elections in Southern Rhodesia in December 1962 saw the UFP defeated by the new Rhodesian Front; the UFP winning 29 seats to the Front&#x27;s 35.

In April 1963 the party was split into four; the federal branch was rebranded as the Federal Party and continued to be led by Roy Welensky, whilst the territorial branches became the National Progressive Party in Northern Rhodesia, the Nyasaland Constitutional Party in Nyasaland and the Rhodesia National Party in Southern Rhodesia, where it was led by Edgar Whitehead. The federation was dissolved at the end of 1963.

<text>The Angeles National Forest (ANF) of the United States Forest Service is located in the San Gabriel Mountains and Sierra Pelona Mountains, primarily within Los Angeles County in southern California. The ANF manages a majority of the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument.

The national forest was established in 1908, incorporating the first San Bernardino National Forest and parts of the former Santa Barbara and San Gabriel National Forests. Angeles National Forest headquarters are located in Arcadia, California.

==Geography==
The Angeles National Forest covers a total of , protecting large areas of the San Gabriel Mountains and Sierra Pelona Mountains. It is located just north of the densely inhabited metropolitan area of Greater Los Angeles.

While primarily within Los Angeles County, a small part extends eastward into southwestern San Bernardino County, in the Mount San Antonio (&quot;Mount Baldy&quot;) area, and a tiny section also extends westward into northeastern Ventura County, in the Lake Piru area.

The San Gabriel Mountains National Monument, established in 2014 and managed by the U.S. Forest Service, is largely within the Angeles National Forest.

The John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act of 2019 established the Saint Francis Dam Disaster National Memorial and Saint Francis Dam Disaster National Monument at and around the ruins of the St. Francis Dam in the Forest&#x27;s San Francisquito Canyon.

===Wilderness areas===
The Angeles National Forest contains five nationally designated wilderness areas. Two of these also extend into neighboring San Bernardino National Forest: 
* Cucamonga Wilderness — &quot;mostly in San Bernardino National Forest&quot;
* Magic Mountain Wilderness
* Pleasant View Ridge Wilderness
* San Gabriel Wilderness
* Sheep Mountain Wilderness — &quot;partially in San Bernardino National Forest&quot;

===Climate===


==History==
Early Native American cultural sites in the inland mountain regions corresponding with the Angeles National Forest are sparse, Radiocarbon dates of 7675 and 7600 years Before Present (BP), taken from a cooking feature in one of the northern drainages of the San Gabriel Mountains, are the oldest known from the central Transverse Ranges. Early material culture indicates extensive use of grinding implements to process small seeds, supplemented by hunting activities. Numerous cogged stones are also found within sites of this period, indicating ceremonial activities.

During the Middle Period (5000 BP to 800 BP), sites generally indicate an increase in population and broadening of the resource base in response to population pressure and resource stress. This period is represented by a large array of specialized subsistence sites, characterized as villages, base camps, food processing and procurement sites, special use sites, rockshelters, pictographs, ovens, and cemeteries.

A Late Period (800 BP to AD 1769) proliferation of sites within the Angeles National Forest indicates a marked increase in regional population. Village provinces, composed of politically and economically-aligned villages may have existed during this period. Subsistence efforts in the mountains appear to focus on hunting, marked by the appearance of the bow and arrow. Greater regional interaction is marked by an increase in non-local materials, indicative of widespread interregional trade networks.

The first reported European contact for the area of the Angeles was in 1769 when the expedition of Gaspar de Portola traveled through the neighboring valleys on his way to Monterey. Early non-Native American use of the Forest centered on early explorers traveling through the area, while early land grants, missions, and townsites surrounded the Forest area. The construction of the missions of San Gabriel Archangel (1771) and San Fernando Rey de España (1797) cemented Spanish presence in the region. In the first two decades of the 19th Century, the Mission System drew in large numbers of Indian neophytes for baptism, completely changing the cultural landscape of the area. A number of subordinate Missions, or Estancias, were built with native labor as outposts to serve as mission-affiliated ranchos, overseeing localized operations. The Spanish Missions generally occupied the lands in the lowlands but relied heavily on the mountains for water, building supplies, and game. By 1800, local Native American traditional cultural lifestyles of had largely disappeared due to devastating European influences, including diseases and incorporation into the Mission System.

The first documented instance of timber activity in the local mountains was in 1819 when Joseph Chapman cut down timber in Millard Canyon (also called Church Canyon) for use in the construction of the Plaza Church in El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Angeles de Porciuncula (now just ‘Los Angeles’). It has also been said that timbers for the San Fernando Mission came from the Tujunga Canyons, and for the San Gabriel Mission came from Little Icehouse Canyon and Little Santa Anita Canyon.

With the Independence of Mexico in 1821, the area of the Forest came under Mexican control. The Mexican Period is typified by the secularization of the Mission system, and the appearance of large land grants, called Ranchos. The major activities involved livestock and farming, and peripheral areas were regularly involved in these activities, as vaqueros sought out timber, water, prey, sport, and stray cattle and horses. Use of the highlands may have included seasonal livestock grazing, utilizing some of the springs in the area.

It was during this period that gold was discovered in Placerita Canyon, in 1842, the first authenticated discovery of gold in California. It started California&#x27;s &quot;first&quot; gold rush. Soon after the later discovery of gold at Sutter’s Mill in 1848, and subsequent conflict between the United States and Mexico, California became part of the United States. Almost immediately large numbers of American migrants began crossing the desert. Merchants and landowners settled in communities throughout the southern California region. Miners poured into the mountains primarily following original and modified Indian trails. Large placer and lode mining operations were established in the San Gabriels, with mixed success. Although the mountains were honeycombed with quartz veins, and a host of small mines were gouged out of the slopes in an attempt to strike gold, many of the ventures were inactive by 1896. The last flurries of serious mining in the region largely ended by the late 1930s. Building of major roads began in the 1850s and railroads passed through Soledad Canyon and Cajon Pass a short time later. Don Benito Wilson, in 1864, built a road into the Forest to harvest wood for fence posts, wine barrels, pickets and shingles. With the majority of Forest composed of chaparral, timber has not played a large role on the Forest, with commercial timber activities virtually ceasing in the Forest during the mid-1950s.

The Great Hiking Era of the San Gabriel Mountains (AD 1880 – 1938) saw increasing use of the rugged backcountry for recreational purposes by the foothill communities, coinciding with the real estate boom in the lowlands and the great interest in hiking, hunting and fishing by the urban populations. In particular, six major hiking trails converged at Red Box Saddle. Settlements started inside the Forest boundaries in the forms of homesteads and resorts in the southern section, and, in the less steep northern section, ranches and homesteads. In 1891, the first homestead was filed in the Big Tujunga Canyon area, and others soon followed. Homestead patents were established throughout the range, with the last being granted on the Angeles National Forest in 1938. A number of resorts and camps sprang up, and these supported the increasing numbers of hikers and campers who forged into the wilderness.  In 1889, the first telescope made its arduous journey up to the summit of Mt. Wilson. A small observatory of canvas and wood, run by Harvard and USC astronomers, was later replaced in 1904 by the more famous institution run by George Ellery Hale. Mount Wilson Observatory would quickly rise to dominate astronomy worldwide. It was home to the world&#x27;s two largest telescopes as well as the most powerful facilities in existence for studying the sun.

In 1891, preliminary work began on an electric cable incline railway from Rubio Canyon to Echo Mountain, a feat never before attempted in the world. Professor Thaddeus S. C. Lowe, an energetic entrepreneur who had garnered fame in the Civil War by ballooning for the Union Army, undertook the venture. In its height at the turn of the century, the Mount Lowe Railway was the most popular tourist attraction in California, comparable to a modern-day Disneyland. In its 43 year history, it saw over three million recorded visitors. In 1938, the most destructive rainstorm in recent memory washed away so much of the track that the railway was abandoned. Much of the ruins of the Mt Lowe Railway are still accessible above Pasadena for interpretive hikes.

On December 20, 1892, the San Gabriel Timberland Reserve was created by President Harrison. The creation of the Reserve, which was the forerunner of the Angeles, was in response to public concern about watershed values as early as 1883. Floods resulting from fire denuded slopes were causing problems with the lowland populations. In 1905, the Reserves were transferred from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture, and renamed National Forest in 1907. The San Gabriel National Forest consisted of the southern section of the present day Angeles and portions of the San Bernardino Forest. In 1908, the name was changed to Angeles National Forest. In 1926, the eastern area was divided and San Bernardino National Forest recreated. At this time, the Saugus (now part of the Santa Clara-Mojave Rivers Ranger District) was detached from the Santa Barbara Reserve and joined with the Angeles.

The San Gabriel Forest Reserve was established on December 20, 1892, the San Bernardino Forest Reserve was established on February 25, 1893, and the Santa Barbara Forest Reserve was established on December 22, 1903. Together, they became National Forests on March 4, 1907, and they were combined on July 1, 1908, with all of the San Bernardino forest and portions of San Gabriel forest and Santa Barbara forest composing the new Angeles National Forest. In 1916, there was a movement to create the Sierra Madre National Park, but that never occurred.

On September 30, 1925, portions of the Angeles National Forest and the Cleveland National Forest were detached to re-establish the San Bernardino National Forest.

Angeles National Forest is registered as California Historical Landmark #717, for being the first National Forest in the state.

The campgrounds at Broken Blade, Twisted Arrow and Pima Loops were closed on July 26, 2013, after squirrel infected with bubonic plague was discovered.

===Wildfires===
====Loop Fire (1966)====

On 1 November 1966, a fire started at 5:19a.m. on the Los Pinetos Nike Site (LA-94). The fire spread, threatening medical facilities and residential areas south edge of the national forest. 12 firefighters with United States Forest Service&#x27;s El Cariso &quot;Hot Shot&quot; crew were killed when they were caught in a flare up in a canyon. 11 more firefighters were seriously burned in the incident. The fire was brought under control at 1:00p.m. on 2 November, having burned .

====Station Fire (2009)====

In the Station Fire, more than of the forest were burned by an arson fire that began on August 26, 2009, near Angeles Crest Highway in La Cañada and quickly spread, fueled by dry brush that had not burned for over 150 years. The fire burned for more than a month and was the worst in Los Angeles County history, charring , approximately one-fourth of the forest; displacing wildlife, and destroying 91 homes, cabins and outbuildings and the family-owned Hidden Springs Cafe.

During the fire, two firefighters died after driving off the Mt. Gleason County Road looking for an alternate route to get the inmates out at Camp 16. The Station Fire threatened the Mount Wilson Observatory atop Mt. Wilson . The site includes two telescopes, two solar towers, and transmitters for 22 television stations, several FM radio stations, and police and fire department emergency channels. Although the fire scorched one side of the outhouse at amateur-owned Stony Ridge Observatory, six miles northeast of Mt. Wilson, aside from minor damage from smoke and ash infiltration, the remainder of the observatory and its historic 30-inch Carroll telescope survived.

====Bobcat Fire (2020)====

In September and October 2020, the Bobcat Fire burned (468 km2) in the central San Gabriel Mountains of the Angeles National Forest. It was one of the largest wildfires in Los Angeles County history.

====Bridge Fire (2024)====
On September 8, 2024, the Bridge Fire broke out near East Fork and Glendora Mountain roads in the Angeles National Forest. It quickly burned through much of the eastern portion of the forest and the Sheep Mountain Wilderness. On September 10, it crossed into San Bernardino County after seeing rapid growth. Evacuation orders were prompted for Mount Baldy Village and Wrightwood as the fire approached the communities. By the time it was contained, the fire burned a total of and destroyed 81 structures. The fire caused the Angeles National Forest to order closures for a large area of the forest in and around the burned area until December 31, 2025.

==Natural history==

The Angeles National Forest manages the habitats, flora and fauna ecosystems, and watersheds. Some of the rivers with watersheds within its boundaries provide valuable non-groundwater recharge water for Southern California. The existing protected and restored native vegetation absorb and slow surface runoff of rainwater to minimize severe floods and landslides in adjacent communities. The land within the forest is diverse, both in appearance and terrain. Elevations range from . The Pacific Crest Trail crosses the forest.

===Flora===
Much of this National Forest is covered with dense chaparral shrub forests with oak woodlands, which changes to pine and fir-covered slopes in the higher elevations. Subsequent to the fire there was a heavy growth of poodle-dog bush, apparently triggered by the fire&#x27;s effect on dormant seeds, that lasted for several years. The plant produces prolific lavender flowers. Unfortunately, as visitors to the Forest discovered, contact with it may cause a poison-oak-like rash.

Tree species for which the forest is important include bigcone Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga macrocarpa&quot;), Coulter pine (&quot;Pinus coulteri&quot;), and California walnut (&quot;Juglans californica&quot;). The National Forest also contains some of old growth, with Jeffrey pine (&quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot;) forests, as well as mixed conifer forests (with Coast Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; var. &quot;menziesii&quot;), ponderosa pine (&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;), white fir (&quot;Abies concolor&quot;), and lodgepole pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot;) being the most abundant trees).

===Fauna===
This forest is home to black bears, gray foxes, bobcats, mountain lions, mule deer, bighorn sheep, rattlesnakes and coyotes.

==Access==
A National Forest Adventure Pass is required for parking at many locations in the Angeles National Forest and other National Forests in Southern California, and this can be obtained online or from visitor centers and local merchants. Los Angeles County has declared that passes are not required on county-maintained roads. There are also many other areas that do not require the pass.

<text>PAOK FC (, ), short for &quot;Pan-Thessalonian Athletic Club of Constantinopolitans&quot; (), and commonly known as PAOK Thessaloniki, PAOK Salonika or simply PAOK, is a Greek professional football club based in Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece. PAOK are one of the top domestic clubs, the most widely supported in Northern Greece and the current Greek Super League champions.

Established on 20 April 1926 by Greek refugees who fled to Thessaloniki from Constantinople in the wake of the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), they play their home games at Toumba Stadium, a 29,000 seating capacity football ground. Their name, along with the club&#x27;s emblem, the Byzantine-style double-headed eagle with retracted wings, honours the memory of the people and places (mostly from the city of Constantinople) that once belonged to the Eastern Roman Empire. PAOK currently plays in the top-flight Super League, which they have won four times (in 1976, 1985, 2019 and 2024). They are eight-time winners of the Greek Cup (in 1972, 1974, 2001, 2003, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021). The club is one of the three which have never been relegated from the top national division and the only team in Greece that have won the Double (in 2019) going unbeaten (26–4–0 record) in a national round-robin league tournament (league format since 1959).&lt;ref name=&quot;2018/19 squad&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The team has appeared several times in the UEFA Europa League, but has yet to reach the group stage of the UEFA Champions League. PAOK have reached the quarter-finals of a European competition three times; once in the 1973–74 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and twice in the UEFA Conference League, in the 2021–22 and 2023–24 seasons. PAOK is the only Greek team that has more wins than losses in their European record (90 wins, 65 draws and 79 defeats, as of April 2024) and the 0–7 away UEFA Cup win over Locomotive Tbilisi on 16 September 1999 is the largest ever achieved by a Greek football club in all European competitions.

== History ==

=== Foundation and early years (1926–1939) ===

PAOK FC is the oldest department of the major multi-sport club AC P.A.O.K., which is closely linked with &quot;Hermes Sports Club&quot;, that was formed in 1875 by the Greek community of Pera, a district of Istanbul (Constantinople).

The football club was founded in April 1926 by Constantinopolitans who fled to Thessaloniki after the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War. PAOK&#x27;s policy was to be open to every citizen of Thessaloniki, leading to a minor rivalry with Athlitiki Enosis Konstantinoupoliton Thessalonikis, the other Constantinopolitan club of the city, in which only refugees were allowed to play. Both clubs were founded by Enosis Konstantinoupoliton Thessalonikis (E.K.Th.), a social and political organisation.
The original logo of PAOK was a horseshoe and a four-leaf clover.

PAOK played their primary friendly match on 4 May 1926 at the stadium of Thermaikos, defeating Megas Alexandros Thessaloniki 2–1. The first coach of the club was Kostas Andreadis who spent five years on the team&#x27;s bench without demanding payment. Their first captain was Michalis Ventourelis.

In 1926–1927 season, PAOK participated in the 2nd tier of Macedonia Football Clubs Association ( or Ε.Π.Σ.Μ.) local Macedonia championship. PAOK FC historic inaugural official match was a 3–1 win against Nea Genea Kalamaria on 12 December 1926. PAOK finished at the top of the 2nd division and faced the 1st division teams in classification matches, defeating all of them: Thermaikos 4–1, Aris 2–1, Atlas Ippodromiou (w/o) and Iraklis 1–0. In 1927–1928, PAOK participated for the first time in the 1st tier of Ε.Π.Σ.Μ.

The first professional contract was signed by the club on 5 September 1928. The contract stipulated that the French footballer Raymond Etienne (of Jewish descent from Pera Club) would be paid 4,000 drachmas per month. The contract was signed by Dr. Meletiou, the PAOK chairman, and Mr. Sakellaropoulos, the Hon. Secretary.

In March 1929, Athlitiki Enosis Konstantinoupoliton Thessalonikis (AEK Thessaloniki) was disbanded as a sports club and their members joined PAOK. PAOK thereupon changed their emblem, adopting the Double-headed eagle, as a symbol of the club&#x27;s Byzantine/Constantinopolitan heritage. PAOK also got possession of AEK facilities located around Syntrivani (i.e. Fountain Square), next to the Children&#x27;s Heritage Foundation, where today stands the Faculty of Theology of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The same year PAOK and Enosis Konstantinoupoliton Thessalonikis (E.K.Th.) wanted to expand the football ground, but they faced problems with the underground flow of the river. Finally, after technical works the keystone was put on 12 December 1930.

In 1930–1931, PAOK made their debut in the Panhellenic Championship, playing their first match on 1 February 1931 against Olympiacos at Piraeus, where they were defeated by 3–1, and ended the season in 5th place. The first foreign coach in team&#x27;s history was Austrian Rudolf Gasner, who served at PAOK in 1931–1932. On 5 June 1932 the Syntrivani Stadium was inaugurated with PAOK&#x27;s 3–2 victory over Iraklis. Syntrivani meant to be their home ground for 27 years.

In 1937, PAOK won their first regional title, the Macedonia championship () and participated in the Panhellenic Championship, finishing 2nd. The 1937 team included: Sotiriadis, Vatikis, Goulios, Kontopoulos, Bostantzoglou, Panidis, Glaros, Kritas, Ioannidis, Kalogiannis, Koukoulas, Kosmidis, Apostolou, Vafiadis, Vasiliadis, Anastasiadis, Moschidis, Tzakatzoglou, Zakapidas.

=== Greco-Italian War and World War II (1939–1945) ===

On 28 May 1939, PAOK competed for first time in a Greek Cup final against AEK Athens and were defeated 2–1 at Leoforos Alexandras Stadium. The following season, PAOK won the Northern Greece Championship and reached the two-legged final of the Panhellenic Championship, but they lost 5–3 on aggregate to AEK.

The declaration of the Greco-Italian War caused mobilization in Greece and ended every sport activity. PAOK football players recruited to Hellenic Army and two of them died on duty: left defender Georgios Vatikis and goalkeeper Nikolaos Sotiriadis. They were among four Greek footballers who died in the war (the others were Spyridon Kontoulis of AEK and Mimis Pierrakos of Panathinaikos). Georgios Vatikis, the first Greek athlete to fall on the Greek-Italian front, served as a warrant officer. He was 22 years old when he died in Battle of Morava–Ivan. After his death, Vatikis was honorarily promoted to lieutenant and awarded the Silver Cross of Valour and the Homeland of Gratitude. Nikolaos Sotiriadis, who played from 1932 until 1940 for PAOK, died on 28 January 1941 in Kleisura, fighting with the rank of Sergeant for the 5th Infantry Regiment. He was 33 years old.

=== Macedonia Football Clubs Association (Macedonia Championship) (1946–1959) ===

After World War II, in the early 1950s, PAOK Academy was created by the Austrian coach, Wilhelm (Willi) Sefzik, and was known as the &quot;chicos of Willi&quot;. From the newly founded academy sprang some great football players of the period, such as Leandros Symeonidis, Giannelos Margaritis and Giorgos Havanidis.

In 1948, PAOK won their second Macedonia Championship, and then participated in the final phase of the Panhellenic Championship where they were ranked third. PAOK footballers dedicated the title to the memory of team captain, Thrasyvoulos Panidis, who had lost his life (18 February 1948) in the civil war few days before. Panidis played for PAOK since 1930 and had 122 appearances. In 1950, they became champions of Macedonia for a third time, and the following year (1950–51), the team reached their second Greek Cup final, but lost 4–0 to Olympiacos at Leoforos Alexandras Stadium.

During the summer transfer period of 1953 Kouiroukidis, Petridis, Progios, Geroudis, Kemanidis, Chassiotis and Angelidis joined the team. The arrival of Lampis Kouiroukidis from Doxa Drama was vital and alongside Lefteris Papadakis and Christophoros Yientzis, they formed a famous attacking trio.

For four consecutive seasons (1954, 1955, 1956, 1957), PAOK won the Macedonia championship and participated in the Panhellenic Championship, finishing fourth each year. Yientzis was the top scorer in 1953–54 season and Kouiroukidis in 1955–56 season. Coached by Nikos Pangalos, PAOK won the 1954 and 1955 local Macedonia championship unbeaten. In 1955, PAOK participated in a third Greek Cup final and were defeated 2–0 by Panathinaikos at Leoforos Alexandras Stadium (home ground of Panathinaikos). Ιn 1956, under Hungarian coach Erman Hoffman they won their third consecutive unbeaten local championship. The successful 4-year period ended with 1957 championship, coached by the Austrian Walter Pfeiffer.

=== Toumba Stadium and rise of Giorgos Koudas to prominence (1959–1969) ===

The Aristotle University of Thessaloniki purchased a two-acre piece of land in the area of Syntrivani Stadium in order to construct new schools. PAOK had to relocate and a 7.5 acres area, owned by the Ministry of National Defence at Toumba district was chosen as the adequate location. The purchase cost was set at 1.5 million drachmas and was paid by PAOK administration in 20 six-month instalments of 75,000 drachmas each. On 7 February 1958, a committee of III Army Corps officers delivered the land to PAOK representatives.

There were still barracks on the premises, housing victims of the Greek Civil War and the 1953 Ionian earthquake. Relocating all these people cost the club 70,000 drachmas. The total cost of the stadium&#x27;s construction amounted to 6 million drachmas, with just 1.1 million coming from the General Secretariat of Sports as subvention. In spring of 1958 construction work started, based on the plans of architect Minas Trempelas and civil engineer Antonis Triglianos. In an attempt to collect the necessary funds, the club issued the &quot;Lottery for the construction of PAOK New Stadium&quot; in April 1958 at a cost of 20 drachmas each. Since 1956, the administration was withholding 15% of the gate income in order to fund the construction of the new stadium. Many PAOK fans, apart from money, also contributed to construction by volunteering to work as builders. The construction of the stadium was completed at a record time of one year.

The inauguration event was scheduled for Sunday 6 September 1959 with a friendly encounter against AEK (PAOK prevailed 1–0 with a goal by Kostas Kiourtzis). Prime minister Konstantinos Karamanlis&#x27;s attendance was cancelled at the last minute. However, several ministers of his government were there for the occasion. As for the ball for the first kick-off, it fell at 17:30 off an airplane of Sedes Military Air Base. On inauguration day, 15,000 PAOK supporters packed Toumba Stadium, as that was the stadium&#x27;s capacity back then. It would increase to 20,000 seats in the following months until it reached a 45,000-seat capacity in the mid-&#x27;70s through extensive expansion work.

The attendance record remains at 45,252 tickets and was registered on 19 December 1976 in the goalless draw against AEK. In European football, the highest attendance was a 45,200 crowd in the 1–0 win against Barcelona (UEFA Cup, 16 September 1975).

==== First years in Greek National League (Alpha Ethniki) ====

In &quot;1959-60 Alpha Ethniki&quot; – the precursor of the current Super League – was set up as a national round-robin tournament and the 1959–60 championship was the first nationwide league competition. In the first decade of Greek Alpha Ethniki (1959–1969), PAOK had a top-half finish in every season except from the 10th-place finish in 1961. The best outcome came out in 1963 and 1967 with a 4th-place finish. Notable players of this period were Leandros Symeonidis, Ioannis Giakoumis, Ignatios Mouratidis, Pavlos Papadopoulos, Anestis Afentoulidis and Giorgos Makris.

==== Giorgos Koudas debut and start of the Olympiacos–PAOK rivalry ====

Giorgos Koudas was born on 23 November 1946 in Thessaloniki. Aged 12, he signed his first contract with PAOK and made his first team debut on 21 December 1963 in a 1–0 loss to Ethnikos at Leoforos Alexandras Stadium. Koudas&#x27; talent immediately started to excel and in 1965–66 season he made 29 appearances and scored 13 goals. On 14 July 1966, PAOK fans were shocked by the news of Koudas&#x27; descent to Piraeus, accompanied by his father (who was enraged with PAOK administration for financial reasons) and determined to sign for Olympiacos, who tempted him by offering a much higher annual salary without going into a negotiation with his club. PAOK president Giorgos Pantelakis never gave his consent for the transfer to be completed and for the next two seasons, Koudas participated only in Olympiacos friendly games. Military junta&#x27;s Minister of Sports Kostas Aslanidis suggested in 1968 that Koudas should return to PAOK for two years and then move to Olympiacos, but Pantelakis refused saying &quot;I may go to Gyaros island (place of exile for leftist political dissidents), but Koudas would never go to Olympiacos&quot;. Eventually, Koudas returned to PAOK in the summer of 1968 and led the great team of the 1970s to glorious days. Fueled by this incident, Olympiacos–PAOK rivalry is considered nowadays the fiercest intercity football rivalry in Greece.

=== 1970s ===

The 1970s decade was one of the best periods in the history of the football club. Scouting some of the best youth players in Northern Greece at the time and signing many of them to PAOK, president Giorgos Pantelakis built a strong team (including Stavros Sarafis, Christos Terzanidis, Kostas Iosifidis, Giannis Gounaris, Dimitris Paridis, Achilleas Aslanidis, Koulis Apostolidis, Filotas Pellios, Aristarchos Fountoukidis, Panagiotis Kermanidis, Angelos Anastasiadis, Neto Guerino and captained by Giorgos Koudas). The team won their first Championship (1976), two Cups (1972, 1974), a Greater Greece Cup (1973) and distinguished themselves in European competitions.

PAOK participated in seven Greek Cup finals from 1970 to 1978. In the 1969–70 Greek Cup PAOK lost 1–0 to local rivals Aris in the final held at Kaftanzoglio Stadium and in the 1970–71 Greek Cup final they were defeated 3–1 by Olympiacos at Karaiskakis Stadium (home ground of Olympiacos).

The first domestic title PAOK won, was the Cup of 1971–72 season. PAOK reached the final for the third straight year, sixth in total and it would be the fifth time traveling to Athens for the trophy match. This time PAOK faced league champions Panathinaikos (runners-up in 1971 European Cup). The final was held at Karaiskakis Stadium on 5 July 1972. PAOK players had 10,000 fans on their side and they vowed that it was about time to return with the trophy to Thessaloniki. PAOK won the game 2–1 with Koudas scoring both goals. In the second half, a magnificent bicycle kick of Matzourakis found the net, but the goal was surprisingly disallowed by referee Michas. PAOK triumphed and their first Greek Cup title was widely celebrated by fans in Thessaloniki.

In 1972–73 season, PAOK came close to winning their first championship title playing exceptional football under the guidance of Les Shannon. On 25 February 1973 (matchday 20), PAOK, who were leading the league table by three points (point system 3–2–1) from rivals Olympiacos, suffered their first loss with 1–0 in a much disputed derby against Olympiacos at Karaiskakis Stadium. PAOK complained that referee Fakis was not taking the proper disciplinary action against Olympiacos players who committed violent fouls. Two players (Iosifidis and Aslanidis) were substituted in the first half after sustaining injuries. One week later, PAOK lost 1–0 to Fostiras in Athens and Olympiacos drew 0–0 away to Egaleo, results that left the two teams level on points. On 22 April 1973 (matchday 28), PAOK suffered a 3–5 shock defeat against Panachaiki at Toumba Stadium and Olympiacos who drew 1–1 away to Kavala, took the lead in the standings and with six wins in their remaining matches won the championship. At the end of the season, PAOK participated for fourth consecutive year in the Greek Cup final and lost 1–0 to Olympiacos at Karaiskakis Stadium (home ground of Olympiacos).

In 1973–74 season, PAOK reached the quarter-finals of 1973–74 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup where they were knocked out by Milan 5–2 on aggregate. PAOK had defeated Legia Warsaw 2–1 on aggregate and Lyon 7–3 on aggregate in the previous rounds. That season, PAOK reached the Greek Cup final for a fifth consecutive year. The final was held at Nikos Goumas Stadium, once again in Athens, on 16 June, and was the first to be decided by a penalty shoot-out. The game ended 2–2 and PAOK won 4–3 on penalties over Olympiacos with Koulis Apostolidis converting the last of the procedure.

==== 1975–76 Alpha Ethniki (first league title) ====

In the 1975–76 PAOK FC season, with Gyula Lóránt at the helm, the team had two daily practices instead of one and physical condition of the players improved significantly. On 4 January 1976, PAOK won 4–0 away at Olympiacos (their biggest home defeat in their history). On 11 April, PAOK defeated Panionios 4–0 and topped the table for first time that season, level on points with AEK who lost 0–1 to Panathinaikos. On matchday 25, AEK were defeated 1–0 by Aris in Thessaloniki and PAOK, with a 3–0 away win over Panachaiki, were alone at the top of the league table. The league title would be decided in two consecutive high-profile encounters at Toumba Stadium. PAOK prevailed 3–1 over Olympiacos and 1–0 over AEK with Neto Guerino scoring the winner in the 89th minute, giving the Double-Headed Eagle of the North a four-point lead (point system 2–1–0). The league title was clinched on the following matchday, when AEK were held to a goalless draw at Panserraikos and PAOK defeated 3–1 Iraklis at Kaftanzoglio Stadium.

In the 1976–77 season, the team tried to defend the title and reached the last 16 of 1976–77 European Cup where they were knocked out by a far superior Dynamo Kyiv side. On 1 May 1977 (matchday 28), PAOK were leading the league table and lost 1–0 to AEK at Nikos Goumas Stadium with a controversial first-half goal that was scored from a direct free kick while goalkeeper Milinis was still setting up the wall. Referee Tsoukaladelis credited the goal to AEK despite the heavy protests from PAOK players and also sent off PAOK midfielder Damanakis in the first half for dangerous play. In the second half, a headed goal scored by Sarafis was wrongly ruled out for offside. PAOK fell from the top of the table. On 12 June (matchday 32), the team had a great chance against Panathinaikos at a packed Toumba Stadium to regain the lead (Panathinaikos were a point ahead). The game ended in a 0–0 stalemate, disappointing fans eager to win a back-to-back championship, while the team performance in the championship decider also did not meet expectations. On 22 June, PAOK lost 2–1 to Panathinaikos in the Greek Cup final held at Karaiskakis Stadium. President Pantelakis was furious with referee Platopoulos who sent off Gounaris in the 64th minute and ordered PAOK players to leave the awarding ceremony without receiving their medals.

In the 1977–78 season, PAOK finished runners-up in the league, with Kostas Orfanos finishing top scorer of the club in the league with 15 goals. The team&#x27;s loss to AEK at the Nea Filadelfeia Stadium at the end of the season sealed the title to the latter. The team also mounted a strong Cup run, beating Aris in the semi–finals on extra time, but lost 2–0 to AEK in the Cup final held at Karaiskakis Stadium.

Compared to the previous three seasons, the 1978–79 season was lackluster, with a 4th place and early eliminations in the domestic Cup and the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup to Olympiacos and Servette, respectively, under Polish manager Egon Piechaczek. However, the team mounted a near perfect home run in all competitions, having only wins, save for a draw against Iraklis in October. The team was also affected by the deadly June earthquake that plagued the city of Thessaloniki, with Toumba Stadium being unusable for a period of time.

Prior to the 1979–80 season, football in Greece became fully professional and PAOK would become entangled in ownership controversies involving the club&#x27;s ultras Gate 4 that would go on via various means for over two decades.

By March 1980, five teams were battling for the championship title. On 9 March 1980 (matchday 24), PAOK were leading the table and lost 0–2 to rivals Panathinaikos at Toumba Stadium. This was the first home defeat after a 62-game unbeaten run (52 wins/10 draws). Kostikos scored two goals in the first half, but both of them were disallowed by referee Litsas. In the second half, Kostikos was brought down in the area by Kovis, but Litsas denied the penalty and sent off PAOK defender Pellios who was protesting. In the final minutes of the game, PAOK had a chance to score from the penalty spot, but the fans shouted to Orfanos to send the ball wide. Orfanos made a really weak side foot-kick which was easily saved by goalkeeper Konstantinou. After the final whistle, all hell broke loose in and around the stadium with 23 police officers and 20 fans sustaining injuries.

In April, Piecharczek was sacked after a series of poor results and was replaced by Gyula Lóránt, who returned after his successful title charge four years earlier, but couldn&#x27;t pull the team above an ultimately disappointing 5th place in the league table. Adding to the club&#x27;s short term troubles, Toumba&#x27;s Gate 8 collapsed in February due to the 1978 earthquake, which rendered the stadium unusable until early into the following season, with the team playing at Iraklis&#x27; Kaftanzoglio Stadium for that time period.

=== 1980s: Professionalism, league title and financial troubles ===
On 31 May 1981, PAOK manager Gyula Lóránt had a heart attack in the 16th minute of the match against Olympiacos at Toumba Stadium when Koudas headed the ball wide from close range. Doctors attempted to resuscitate him, but he died before the ambulance arrived. At half-time PAOK players were told that he had been taken to hospital and were only told about his death after the game. PAOK eventually won the derby 1–0 with the goal by substitute Vassilis Vasilakos (who had been sitting next to Lóránt when he collapsed). PAOK players wanted to dedicate a Greek Cup title to his memory, but the team lost 3–1 to Olympiacos in the Greek Cup final held at Nikos Goumas Stadium on 21 June.

In the 1981–82 season PAOK contested a domestic double, but ultimately fell short of both trophies, owing to a mediocre form in the last fixtures of the league, which condemned the team to a 3rd-place position, and a tense semi–final at Leoforos Alexandras against Panathinaikos, where the team conceded a late goal from Grigoris Charalampidis, resulting in elimination. Moreover, the team engaged in a memorable tie against West German powerhouse Eintracht Frankfurt in that year&#x27;s Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. After a 2–0 loss at the Waldstadion, anticipation for the return tie was massive. In front of a crowd of 35,000 (unofficial estimates range much higher), the team had a dominant display and managed to equal the 2–0 deficit, but failed to score the third goal prior to the penalty shootout. After up-and-coming Christos Dimopoulos&#x27;s penalty was saved, Bruno Pezzey netted the winning penalty kick.

On 29 June 1983, PAOK participated once again in the Greek Cup final which was held for first time at the newly built Olympic Stadium of Athens. Captained for last time in a Greek Cup final by Koudas, the team lost 2–0 to AEK despite their superiority over the opponents that day. A first-half goal by Giorgos Kostikos was ruled out for offside.

PAOK also made a memorable appearance against German giants Bayern Munich in the second round of the 1983–84 UEFA Cup, where they were knocked out on penalties (9–8) after two goalless draws. Bayern&#x27;s first penalty kick, taken by Klaus Augenthaler, was saved twice by PAOK goalkeeper Mladen Furtula, but the English referee Arthur Robinson ordered the penalty to be retaken both times. Augenthaler admitted in a 2018 interview that the referee favored Bayern and that he felt uncomfortable when he was asked to take the penalty for a third time. At the end of the season, Koudas and Furtula retired from professional football.

==== 1984–85 Alpha Ethniki (second league title) ====


PAOK&#x27;s second championship came in 1984–85 season, under Austrian manager Walter Skocik. Notable team figures included Giorgos Skartados, Nikos Alavantas, Thomas Siggas, Rade Paprica and the attacking duo of Giorgos Kostikos and Christos Dimopoulos. It was the last season at the club for Ioannis Damanakis and captain Kostas Iosifidis, who ended his football career.

On 20 January 1985 (matchday 15), PAOK gained a five-point lead (point system 2–1–0) with a 1–0 away win over Panathinaikos at the Olympic Stadium of Athens. The crucial goal was scored by Paprica in the 80th minute with a diving header. On 9 June, PAOK clinched the league title with a goalless draw at Nea Smyrni Stadium against Panionios, as Panathinaikos were held to a 2–2 draw by bottom of the table Pierikos. On 22 June, 10-man (Vasilakos was sent-off early in the first half) PAOK lost 4–1 to Larissa in the Greek Cup final held at the Olympic Stadium of Athens and wasted the opportunity to win a first domestic Double. PAOK&#x27;s top goalscorer that season, Christos Dimopoulos, did not participate as he left the team at Athens airport when they arrived from Thessaloniki for the game. He went to the headquarters of Motor Oil (company of Panathinaikos president Vardinogiannis) in order to seal his transfer to Panathinaikos as his five-year contract with PAOK was expiring.

In the 1987–88 season, PAOK were fighting for the title (along with AEL and AEK) up to matchday 23, when they suffered a surprising 0–2 home defeat to Iraklis. Earlier that season, on 6 December 1987, PAOK made a record 6–1 win over rivals Olympiacos at Serres Municipal Stadium (biggest defeat of Olympiacos in Greek Alpha Ethniki/Superleague history). PAOK finished third in the league and qualified for 1988–89 UEFA Cup where they faced Napoli of Maradona, Careca and Alemão. The team fought vigorously, but lost 2–1 on aggregate. Maradona, when asked on RAI TV, moments after the final whistle of the second leg at Toumba Stadium, if he had ever played in such an atmosphere, said &quot;&quot;I have played a lot of games, but I have never seen anything like this. We couldn&#x27;t find any rhythm and I believe that it was difficult for the opponents too. It was a weird encounter&quot;.

=== The Thomas Voulinos era (1989–1996) ===

In the 1989–90 season, with Magdy Tolba shining and youngster Giorgos Toursounidis rising, the team managed to reach the half-way stage of the competition topping the table (winter champions), but good form deteriorated and PAOK finished third.

The 1990–91 season started with PAOK facing Sevilla in the first round of the UEFA Cup and they were knocked out on penalties after two goalless draws. On 23 September 1990 (matchday 2), president Thomas Voulinos stormed the field in the 77th minute of the derby against Panathinaikos at the Olympic Stadium of Athens. Voulinos was furious with referee Karamanis and despite the fact that the scoreline was 3–0 and the winner was already determined, he ordered PAOK players to leave the pitch. After the game which was eventually abandoned, he said &quot;We felt like sheep that were heading to be butchered and that was unacceptable&quot;&quot;. PAOK were later penalised with a three-point deduction and had to play five home games behind closed doors. The two teams met again in the Greek Cup semi-finals and in the 57th minute of the second leg at Toumba Stadium, Voulinos once again entered the pitch angry at decisions by referee Vasilakis. Panathinaikos won 2–1 on aggregate.
In 1991–92 season, under Croatian manager Miroslav Blažević, PAOK qualified against the then strong KV Mechelen (winners in 1988, semi-finalists in 1989 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup / quarter-finalists in 1990 European Cup) in the first round of 1991–92 UEFA Cup, 2–1 on aggregate. Stefanos Borbokis scored the winner in the 85th minute of the second leg at Achter de Kazerne Stadium. Blazevic was replaced by Gounaris later and the team lost in the two-legged Greek Cup final to Olympiacos, 3–1 on aggregate. On 24 May 1992 (matchday 32), PAOK lost 1–2 to Olympiacos at Toumba Stadium and suffered their first home defeat against rivals Olympiacos after a 24-game unbeaten run (21 wins/3 draws – 21 league matches/3 cup matches – goals 52/12) which lasted for 23 years. It is rumoured that after this shock defeat, the renowned PAOK ultras leader Thomas Mavromichalis (nicknamed Makis Manavis, i.e., greengrocer due to his profession – PAOK ultras refer to him as «The General») decided to never set foot again at Toumba Stadium.

On 1 October 1992, the PAOK v. Paris Saint–Germain UEFA Cup match was abandoned due to crowd violence. PAOK were punished with a two-year ban from all European competitions by UEFA&#x27;s disciplinary committee. The sentence was later reduced to one year. In the 1994–95 season, under Dutch manager Arie Haan, PAOK finished third in the league and Apollon Athens took their place in the next season&#x27;s UEFA Cup.

The 1995–96 season was the worst in the club&#x27;s history. PAOK were seriously threatened with a possible relegation for first time in their history. The team managed to avoid relegation a few weeks before the end of the season, finishing in a record low 14th place, with various demonstrations and riots against Voulinos throughout the season, including an arson attack on his house after a 1–3 loss to AEK in November 1995. However, the team mounted a consistent Cup run, being eliminated in the semi–finals by Apollon Athens.

=== The George Batatoudis era (1996–2003) ===
In 1996, Thomas Voulinos handed over a debt-free PAOK to Giorgos Batatoudis. Numerous transfers of quality players such as Zisis Vryzas, Spyros Marangos, free kick specialist Kostas Frantzeskos, Percy Olivares and Joe Nagbe took place under the new administration. In May 1997, after a five-year absence from European competitions, PAOK qualified for the UEFA Cup under coach Angelos Anastasiadis. The club&#x27;s reappearance at European level was marked by a victory and qualification over Arsenal, 2–1 on aggregate. Arsenal went on to win a domestic Double that season. Remembering the first leg encounter, captain Tony Adams and goalkeeper David Seaman spoke very highly of the atmosphere created by PAOK fans at Toumba Stadium.

On 9 February 1998, PAOK player Panagiotis Katsouris, aged 21, was returning from an amateur 5x5 match, when his car skidded off the road due to excessive speed, hitting the barriers at the Thermi interchange outside Thessaloniki. His death was verified in AHEPA Hospital shortly afterwards. He was buried on 12 February in the Anastaseos Cemetery in Thessaloniki. A bust was erected in his memory at Toumba Stadium and memorial services are held each year near the accident scene. In February 2009, PAOK announced that a football tournament, bearing his name, would be held annually. Katsouris&#x27; No 17 jersey was permanently retired by the club in his memory.

Early on 4 October 1999, in a bus accident in the Vale of Tempe, Thessaly, six PAOK fans were killed (Kyriakos Lazaridis, Christina Tziova, Anastasios Themelis, Charalampos Zapounidis, Georgios Ganatsios, Dimitris Andreadakis). The bus was heading back to Thessaloniki after a 1–1 draw against Panathinaikos at the Olympic Stadium of Athens. A ceremony in commemoration of the incident has taken place every year since.

In January 2000, PAOK appointed Dušan Bajević as their new manager. PAOK won the 2001 Greek Cup beating Olympiacos 4–2 in the final held at Nikos Goumas Stadium on 12 May 2001.

On 17 May 2003, PAOK defeated local rivals Aris 1–0 in the final held at Toumba Stadium with an excellent goal scored by Georgiadis and earned their fourth Greek Cup title. PAOK manager Angelos Anastasiadis became the first in the club&#x27;s history to win the Cup both as a player (in 1974) and manager.

During the seven-year period of Batatoudis&#x27; ownership, PAOK&#x27;s debts rose to about €10 million.

=== The Giannis Goumenos era: troubled times (2003–2006) ===

The 2003–04 season was an unexpected success. Batatoudis was no longer the major shareholder and under coach Anastasiadis, PAOK managed to finish third in the league and reached the third qualifying round of 2004–05 UEFA Champions League, where they faced Maccabi Tel Aviv. The first leg at Toumba Stadium ended 1–2, but it was later awarded 0–3 against PAOK for fielding a suspended player - Liasos Louka, a Cypriot player still serving a two-match ban in UEFA competitions (for his sending-off in a UEFA Intertoto Cup tie while playing for Nea Salamis on 8 July 2000) had played. Eventually, the team failed to qualify for the group stage.

Rolf Fringer succeeded Angelos Anastasiadis in September 2004, but after a few games, he was replaced by Nikos Karageorgiou, who led the club to a fifth-place finish in May 2005 and a subsequent 2005–06 UEFA Cup qualification.

In late May 2006, the club&#x27;s poor financial position started to emerge; players declared they had been unpaid for months. A shocking decision by UEFA to ban the club from the upcoming UEFA Cup brought the club close to dissolution. The organized supporters&#x27; groups launched an all-out war against president Giannis Goumenos during the summer of 2006, even occupying the club&#x27;s offices in Toumba stadium for a handful of days. The situation was worsening for Goumenos after various negotiations with possible investors failed, constant allegations of embezzlement emerged, and especially after his decision to sell star player Dimitris Salpingidis to Panathinaikos.

On 13 November 2006, Goumenos resigned from PAOK presidency leaving huge debts behind (during the three-year period of Goumenos&#x27; ownership, the club&#x27;s debts rose from about €10 million to around €30 million → €10 million were the primary debt obligations plus €20 million from additional taxes, fines and surcharges) and few weeks later, Nikos Vezyrtzis–Apostolos Oikonomidis duo (former PAOK BC presidents) assumed temporary management of the club.

=== Theodoros Zagorakis – Zisis Vryzas management with massive fans&#x27; support (2007–2012) ===
In June 2007, former player and captain Theodoros Zagorakis assumed the presidency of the club, replacing the Nikos Vezyrtzis and Apostolos Oikonomidis administration and thus ushered a new era, in an effort to bring the club back to successes.

In 2007–08 PAOK FC season, the early replacement of Georgios Paraschos by the well-known established manager Fernando Santos did little to prevent a ninth-place finish in the league. On 6 January 2008, Zisis Vryzas ended his football career coming on as a substitute in the game against AEL and immediately started his tenure as PAOK sports director.

The club&#x27;s finances gradually improved thanks to new sponsorship deals and the continuing support from fans (the number of season tickets was vastly increased). In June 2008, Theodoros Zagorakis announced the club&#x27;s intention of building a new PAOK FC Sport Center in the Nea Mesimvria urban area of Thessaloniki, owned by the club. The administration had already acquired land from the municipality of Agios Athanasios and the project would be executed by former president Vasilis Sergiannidis&#x27; construction company.

In the summer of 2008, the club brought in promising winger Vieirinha and widely known internationals Pablo Contreras, Zlatan Muslimović and Pablo García. In the winter transfer window that followed, Olivier Sorlin and Lino joined the team. The end of the 2008–09 PAOK FC found PAOK in second place, eight points behind champions Olympiacos. However, the team lost in the Super League playoffs (pos. 2–5) to Panathinaikos and finished in fourth place.

In the 2009–10 PAOK FC season, PAOK fought for the title up to matchday 26 (Panathinaikos were two points ahead), when they lost 2–0 against local rivals Aris at Kleanthis Vikelidis Stadium. The club complained about referee Spathas; after the final whistle, Zagorakis went to the dressing room and apologized to PAOK players for not being able to protect them against poor refereeing. PAOK went on to win the league playoffs (pos. 2–5) and qualified for 2010–11 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round, but the success was swiftly followed by Fernando Santos&#x27; announcement of his decision to depart, having concluded his three-year contract as head coach. It was eventually decided in mid-June that Mario Beretta would be his successor.

Beretta was quickly replaced by Pavlos Dermitzakis and became the shortest-serving PAOK coach ever, sitting on the bench for just 38 days. With Dermitzakis at the helm, PAOK faced Ajax and was ultimately eliminated on the away goals rule, managing a 1–1 draw in Amsterdam and a thrilling 3–3 draw in Thessaloniki. Entering the UEFA Europa League playoff round, PAOK were drawn against Fenerbahçe, also eliminated from the Champions League third qualifying round. PAOK won the home game 1–0 in Thessaloniki, then secured a 1–1 draw after extra time in Constantinople. Dermitzakis was removed after a 1–0 loss to Panathinaikos FC on 17 October. His assistant, Makis Chavos, replaced him as caretaker manager and PAOK reached the knockout phase of the Europa League, losing 2–1 on aggregate to CSKA Moscow. In the league, PAOK finished third and qualified for the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League.

PAOK board appointed Romanian László Bölöni as the club&#x27;s new head coach for the following season. The team qualified from the UEFA Europa League playoff round and entered the group stage. On 30 November 2011, PAOK achieved a historic 2–1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. With this victory, the club qualified for the knockout phase for a second consecutive year. On 26 January 2012, Theodoros Zagorakis resigned from the club&#x27;s presidency and was replaced by Zisis Vryzas.

=== The Ivan Savvidis era (2012–present) ===

On 10 August 2012, Ivan Savvidis acquired PAOK ownership by depositing a fee of €9,951,000 and thus becoming the major shareholder of the club.

In 2012–13 PAOK FC season, under manager Giorgos Donis, PAOK finished 2nd during the regular period, qualifying for the Super League Greece playoffs (pos. 2–5). After a Greek Cup semi-final loss to Asteras Tripoli, Donis was replaced by technical director and former player Georgios Georgiadis, who was appointed as caretaker manager. PAOK managed to win qualification for the third qualifying round of the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League through the playoffs after a last game win against PAS Giannina.

In June 2013, PAOK appointed Huub Stevens as their new coach, but he was dismissed in March 2014 after achieving poor results. Once again, Georgiadis was appointed as caretaker manager and the team managed to reach the 2013–14 Greek Cup final, but lost 4–1 to Panathinaikos at the Olympic Stadium of Athens.

In March 2015, Law N° 4321/2015 on regulations for kickstarting the economy was adopted by the Greek government and stated that a total repayment of a company&#x27;s primary debt obligations would lead to the deletion of all additional taxes, fines and surcharges. On 12 May 2015, PAOK owner Ivan Savvidis paid the total amount of the club&#x27;s debts towards Greek public authorities, a fee of €10,886,811. On 27 May, PAOK hired Frank Arnesen as their new sports director. On 18 June, Igor Tudor was hired as the new manager of the club, signing a three-year contract. On 2 September, PAOK announced the signing of Dimitar Berbatov on a one-year deal. Playing a 3–5–2 formation, the team progressed through three qualifying rounds to reach the UEFA Europa League group stage and on 10 December, PAOK made a surprising 1–0 away win over Borussia Dortmund at Signal Iduna Park. Tudor was replaced in March 2016 by youth-team coach Vladimir Ivić and the team won the Super League playoffs (pos. 2–5) and qualified for the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round.

PAOK won the 2016–17 Greek Cup beating AEK 2–1 in the final held at Panthessaliko Stadium with a controversial goal scored by Pedro Henrique in the 81st minute. Linesman Kalfoglou failed to indicate that the scorer was in an offside position. In the same phase of play, moments before Leovac made the cross to Henrique, Crespo was brought down in the area by Simoes, but PAOK were denied a penalty by referee Kominis. The final was marred by crowd violence before the kick-off. In the Super League playoffs (pos. 2–5) that followed, a game against Panathinaikos at Leoforos Alexandras Stadium was abandoned (scoreline 1–0 at the time) when Ivić was struck on his head by a beer can that was thrown from the crowd. The Serbian coach was taken to a public hospital and the match was interrupted by referee Kominis in the 54th minute. Panathinaikos representatives claimed that Ivić exaggerated the impact of the injury and could continue. The game was awarded 0–3 to PAOK by court decision. AEK went on to win the playoffs and PAOK finished 4th. After the end of the season, Ivić did not renew his contract and the club appointed Aleksandar Stanojević whose tenure as PAOK manager did not last long. On 11 August 2017, he was replaced by Răzvan Lucescu.

==== 2017–18 eventful season ====


On 25 February 2018 (and while PAOK were leading the league table being 2pts ahead of AEK), PAOK–Olympiacos derby was suspended before kick-off when Olympiacos manager Óscar García Junyent was hit by an object thrown from the crowd (reportedly by an unfolding cash register paper roll). Óscar García received medical attention before being taken to a private general hospital (Interbalkan Medical Center). The private clinic where García was taken issued a statement about five hours after the coach was admitted, saying that due to his medical condition (sensitivity in the jaw, neck pain, dizziness and nausea) García had to stay at the hospital overnight and PAOK vs Olympiacos game never started. Olympiacos communications chief Karapapas stated that he expected a huge apology from PAOK for the incident and that their rivals should become more civilized if they want to develop into a big club. He also claimed that the object that fell onto García was a sealed cash register paper roll, which can be as heavy as a stone and when thrown from a certain height and distance with a certain force can be a very powerful blow. PAOK representatives claimed that the whole incident was a certain tactic from Olympiacos, which eventually did not work out because there was no injury sustained. Medical report of the official doctor of the match, approved by the Greek Football Federation (EPO), stated that García was not seriously injured and could return on the bench, but Olympiacos questioned doctor&#x27;s credibility because he was a PAOK employee, working in PAOK youth academy. Referee Aretopoulos (who had many controversial moments in his career) submitted two match reports to describe why the game was abandoned (an initial report at Toumba Stadium and a supplementary report few days later that was demanded by first-instance court judge). Olympiacos were later awarded a 0–3 win by court decision.

On 11 March 2018, during a championship decider derby against AEK (timeline of events before the game: 24 Feb: PAOK 52pts/AEK 50pts, 25 Feb: PAOK–Olympiacos suspended before kick-off, 26 Feb: Atromitos–AEK 1–1 and PAOK 52pts/AEK 51pts, 4 Mar: Asteras Tripoli–PAOK 3–2, AEK–Panionios 1–0 and AEK 54pts/PAOK 52pts, 5 Mar: first-instance court sentence: PAOK deducted 3pts, game awarded 0–3 to Olympiacos, 2 home games behind closed doors and AEK 54pts/PAOK 49pts, 10 Mar: court of appeal sentence: 3pts returned to PAOK, game awarded 0–3 to Olympiacos, closed doors penalty suspended and AEK 54pts/PAOK 52pts), the president of the team, Ivan Savvidis, stormed onto the pitch when referee Georgios Kominis disallowed a 90th-minute goal scored by Fernando Varela with a header. The goal was initially credited to PAOK by both the referee who pointed the center spot and the linesman who never raised his flag and ran towards the center. About 10–15 seconds later and while PAOK players were celebrating, linesman Pontikis was approached by AEK players who were protesting and approximately 3 minutes after the goal was scored, they altered their decision. The goal was ruled out for offside (according to referee Kominis, Maurício influenced play). Savvidis entered the pitch with few members of his personal guard and Ľuboš Micheľ (former UEFA Elite referee). At first, he ordered his team to leave the pitch, but his request was denied by PAOK captain Vieirinha. Afterwards they went close to the referee, where Micheľ expressed his complaints about the decision. Leaving the pitch 1 minute after his entry, a tension was built between Savvidis and members of AEK bench and moments later Savvidis took off his jacket and a gun appeared attached to his belt. The referee suspended the game and sent the two teams to the dressing rooms. Savvidis tried to enter into the referees&#x27; dressing room, but he was denied entrance by security and few minutes later he left the stadium. Kominis&#x27; intention was the game to be continued after 1 hour (and blew his whistle outside the dressing rooms calling the two teams), but AEK general manager Vasilis Dimitriadis approached him and claimed (as can be heard in audio) that the players of AEK were terrified from the incident and could not continue as he felt that their safety was at risk. PAOK vice-president Chrisostomos Gagatsis is heard trying to persuade Dimitriadis to order AEK players to return on the pitch. Soon after, the game was abandoned.

The incident caused the league to be suspended by the Greek government. AEK manager Manolo Jiménez giving his side of the story, confirmed that Kominis wanted the game to be concluded, but AEK president told them not to play. He also said about a year later, that AEK players and himself realized that Savvidis was actually carrying a gun on his belt when they received photos on their cellphones and not while they were on the pitch. AEK midfielder Panagiotis Kone in an interview after the game also confirmed that Kominis told them to go out and play for the remaining 5 minutes, but he did not inform AEK players as to whether he would award or overturn PAOK goal when asked in the dressing rooms. He replied that they would be informed outside on the pitch. Of course, both Jiménez and Kone condemned Savvidis&#x27; actions and held him responsible for the interruption. PAOK goalkeeper Alexandros Paschalakis stated that it was clearly a legitimate goal scored by Varela, because Maurício was behind the goalkeeper and did not influence play. He also said that Savvidis&#x27; invasion of the pitch wasn&#x27;t proper. On his official match report, referee Kominis wrote down that when the match was interrupted the scoreline was 1–0 and that he decided to award the goal. Kominis received a summons to appear at the court hearing, but he sent a letter instead, explaining that he could not show up for personal reasons. He also received a legal document with 3 questions from first-instance court judge and gave a definite answer in one of them and a vague response in the other two. Ivan Savvidis apologised for his behaviour two days after the game and he was later banned from all football stadiums for three years. PAOK were sentenced with a 3pt deduction (and 2pts from next season&#x27;s championship) and AEK were awarded a 0–3 win by court decision. The 6-point swing was a major blow to PAOK&#x27;s title hopes and the club was unable to secure the title as AEK were crowned champions with three match-days to go.

The club still managed to end their season on a high note by winning their second consecutive Greek Cup beating AEK 2–0 in the final held at the Olympic Stadium of Athens (AEK home ground at the time), with the match refereed after many years in Greece by a foreign referee (David Fernández Borbalán). During the post-game press conference, manager Lucescu and captain Vieirinha (final MVP) both stated that 2018 championship title was stolen from PAOK.

==== 2018–19 unbeaten Champions and first Domestic Double ====

2018–19 season was the best in club&#x27;s history. During the 2018–19 Super League Greece, the major derbies, after decades in Greek football history, were refereed by foreign referees.

On 21 April, PAOK beat Levadiakos 5–0 and clinched the league title, hosting a memorable celebration. On 5 May, PAOK earned their 26th win in 30 games to complete an undefeated season (26–4–0 record). This is arguably the best performance in Greek football history, the previous held by Panathinaikos, who won the 1963–64 Alpha Ethniki title undefeated, but with a 24–6–0 record. PAOK were also the only unbeaten European football club in the national championships held across Europe during the 2018–2019 season.

On 11 May, PAOK won the Greek Cup for third consecutive year, defeating AEK 1–0. This was the third consecutive Greek Cup final against the same opponent and it was held for second consecutive year at the Olympic Stadium of Athens (AEK home ground at the time). The Video assistant referee (VAR) was used for the first time in Greek football and in a Greek Cup final. The winning goal came in the 45th minute with an overhead kick of Chuba Akpom. Dimitris Pelkas provided the assist. With this Greek Cup victory, PAOK FC achieved a domestic Double for first time in their history.

Vieirinha was named MVP of the Season.

====2020–21 Greek Cup winners and 2021–22 UEFA Europa Conference League quarter-finalists====
On 22 May 2021, under Uruguayan manager and fan favorite Pablo García, PAOK won their eighth Greek Cup title, beating Olympiacos 2–1 in the final held at the Athens Olympic Stadium with Michael Krmenčík scoring the winner in the 90th minute.And PAOK conquered the Greek Cup for 8th time in the history of the club. In the 2021–22 season, PAOK reached the quarter-finals of the inaugural UEFA Conference League, losing 1–3 on aggregate to Marseille. On 21 May 2022, PAOK lost 1–0 to Panathinaikos in the Greek Cup final which was held at the Olympic Stadium of Athens.

2022–23 Greek Cup final disappointment and early European exit

The 2022–23 season started with an early elimination in the UECL 2nd Qualifying Round to Levski Sofia and a slow start in the league, being 5th at the end of October. However, the team resurged and entered the play–offs as title contenders, but, in a repeat of the previous season, failed to live up to expectations and finished 4th, 16 points below the top. The team&#x27;s cup run was stopped at the final against AEK Athens, behind closed doors at the Panthessaliko Stadium, losing 2–0 even though AEK Athens received an early red card in the game.

====2023–24 Greek Championship and UEFA Conference League quarter-finalists====

The 2023–24 season started with new signings in the summer window, such as Kiril Despodov. The team managed to suffice in the qualifying rounds of the Conference League, tightly beating Beitar Jerusalem and topping HNK Hajduk Split and Hearts in the 2nd, 3rd and play–off qualifying rounds respectively. In the group stage, the team defeated HJK before scoring a memorable home victory at an atmospheric Toumba Stadium against 2022 Europa League winners Eintracht Frankfurt 2–1 on injury time, a feat which the club would repeat against Aberdeen in Pittodrie, followed by a draw against Aberdeen at home.

In March, PAOK played Dinamo Zagreb at the Maksimir Stadium for the competition&#x27;s round of 16, suffering a 2–0 defeat. However, in the return leg, PAOK managed an impressive 5–1 comeback, qualifying to the quarterfinals with a score of 5–3 on aggregate. The 2023–24 UEFA Conference League run ended in the quarter-finals where PAOK played against Club Brugge. In the first leg, PAOK lost 1–0. They didn&#x27;t manage to make up for the loss in the second leg, where PAOK lost 0–2.
In 2023–24 season, PAOK after finishing first in the regular season, managed to remain on top after the conclusion of the play-offs winning their fourth Greek Championship on a remarkable fashion. PAOK defeated all their major rivals (AEK, Olympiacos, Panathinaikos and Aris) in the last four matches, winning against the three league contenders from Athens at home and clinching the title with a 1–2 away victory over city rivals Aris at the Kleanthis Vikelidis Stadium on 19 May 2024.

== Crest and colours ==

=== Crest ===
The first emblem of PAOK depicted a four-leaf clover and a horseshoe. The leaves were green and above them were the initials of the word &quot;PAOK&quot;. Kostas Koemtzopoulos, one of PAOK&#x27;s founding members, came up with this idea, inspired by his favourite brand of cigarettes.

On 20 March 1929, Enosis Konstantinoupoliton Thessalonikis (A.E.K.) was dissolved and absorbed by PAOK and a mournful version of the double-headed eagle with the wings closed instead of stretched, indicating the grief for the lost homelands, was adopted as the club&#x27;s new emblem.

On 11 June 2013, under the presidency of Ivan Savvidis, a golden outline was added to the crest, as a symbol of the club&#x27;s Byzantine heritage.

During the 2018–19 season, the first emblem was used on the third kit.

=== Colours ===

The club&#x27;s colours have always been black and white, black for the sorrow related to countless thousands of Greek refugees who were forced to leave the land their ancestors had been living in for centuries (Asia Minor, Eastern Thrace, Pontus, Caucasus) and white for the hope of a new beginning that came with settling in a new home. PAOK&#x27;s traditional kit features a black and white vertical striped shirt, combined with black or white shorts and socks. Various types of shirts were used throughout the club&#x27;s history and the most common alternatives were those with thinner or wider stripes, the all-black one and the all-white one. Over the years, several other colours were used on the 3rd kit, such as grey, silver, blue, purple, orange and red.

==== Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors ====
The current kit manufacturer is &quot;Macron&quot;, a collaboration that started in July 2015 and was renewed twice until 2027. &quot;Stoiximan&quot;, a Greek online gambling company, is the shirt sponsor since June 2017, with the sponsorship deal extended twice and set to last until 2025.
==Facilities==

===Toumba Stadium===
PAOK&#x27;s current home ground is Toumba Stadium, which was built in 1959. During the years, this artifact of modern architecture has been used as an owned country house by fellow citizens of Thessaloniki, commemorating the actual roots of this great club.

===New Toumba Stadium project===

PAOK administration have already presented to the Greek public authorities an architecture study of a new at Toumba Stadium. The Greek Council of State (CoS), the country&#x27;s supreme court, in April 2022 approved a proposal to set up the complete redevelopment of Toumba Stadium, with the CoS deeming legal a draft Presidential Decree concerning the approval of a Special Urban Plan for the district of Toumba, where the venue is located. On 21 June 2022, PAOK has formalized the beginning of a collaboration with a team consisting of domestic engineering and consulting firm SALFO and global architectural design company Populous to deliver the project. It is estimated that PAOK will be granted a building permit in 2023 and the new stadium will be completed by 2026 and will have a capacity of 41,900 spectators. PAOK would probably move to Kaftanzoglio Stadium until the new Stadium is built.

New Toumba Stadium project plans present some significant changes to the original stadium, notably a giant roof covering the entire stadium which counters a common criticism of the current ground regarding exposure to weather and elements outside of Gates 1 and 2. The existing stands would be demolished and reconstructed, moving closer to the pitch and eliminating the distance from the former running track.
However, as of early 2024, the project has been in a continuous stalemate.

===Training ground===

PAOK FC Sport Center is the training ground of the first team and Academy, located in Nea Mesimvria area of Thessaloniki. The construction started under the presidency of Theodoros Zagorakis.

===New Training Center Thermi===
On 19 January 2024, a blessing of the land where the club&#x27;s new training center will be built took place. The newly acquired plot of land is located on the 8th road of the Tagarades farmland in the community of the Thermi municipality.

== Supporters ==

PAOK FC is the most widely supported football club in Northern Greece and with the 3rd largest fanbase in the country, according to the latest polls and researches.

PAOK&#x27;s traditional fanbase comes from the city of Thessaloniki, where the club is based, as well as from the rest of Macedonia region and Northern Greece. They also have fans all over the country and in the Greek Diaspora (Germany, Australia, USA, etc.). Research by Marca in August 2018 reported that PAOK are the most popular Greek football team on social media.

Toumba Stadium is infamous for its hostile atmosphere, a factor that led to the attribution of the Stadium as &quot;The Black Hell&quot;. On high-profile encounters, when the players walk out of the tunnel, the song Hells Bells by AC/DC is heard from the stadium&#x27;s speakers. The notorious Gate 4 is home to many PAOK organized supporters&#x27; groups from around the globe, with the homonymous &quot;Gate 4&quot; fan club which was founded in April 1976, being the most familiar everywhere. The supporters&#x27; group from Neapoli district of Thessaloniki that was founded in 1963 is the oldest one. One of the biggest banners in the world was created by PAOK&#x27;s fan club in Michaniona.

No 12 jersey is dedicated to the fans, the symbolic 12th man on the pitch. It was permanently retired by the club on 16 August 2000.

=== Vale of Tempe tragedy (1999) ===

3,000 PAOK fans descended to the Olympic Stadium of Athens for the game against Panathinaikos on 3 October 1999. A few hours later, on its way back to Thessaloniki, the double-decker bus of the Kordelio fan club collided with a truck and fell into a ditch in the Vale of Tempe, Thessaly. The aftermath of the bus crash was devastating. Six PAOK fans lost their lives (Kyriakos Lazaridis, Christina Tziova, Anastasios Themelis, Charalampos Zapounidis, Georgios Ganatsios, Dimitris Andreadakis) and many others were injured. A roadside memorial was erected at the site of the crash bearing the following inscription: &quot;Their love for PAOK brought them here, left them here and went beyond&quot;.

PAOK fans maintain a strong friendship with the supporters of Serbian club Partizan, the &quot;Grobari&quot;. On many occasions, fans from both clubs traveled to watch each other&#x27;s games. A part of PAOK organized supporters&#x27; groups have good relations with the fans of CSKA Moscow and Beşiktaş.

A good rapport exists between PAOK and OFI Crete fans, a friendship that started in October 1987 when OFI faced Atalanta for 1987–88 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup at Toumba Stadium and numerous PAOK fans supported the Cretans. A mutual respect stands between PAOK and Panionios fans.

=== Rivalries ===

The rivalry between Olympiacos and PAOK is the fiercest intercity football rivalry in Greece and is long-standing, emerging in the 1960s, when Olympiacos unsuccessfully tried to acquire Giorgos Koudas from PAOK, approaching him directly without going into a negotiation with his club. A longtime heated rivalry exists between PAOK and local rivals Aris. Panathinaikos and AEK, Athens&#x27; two big clubs, are also considered major rivals. There are also some less intense rivalries, like those with Iraklis (local conflict) and AEL.

<text>Rudolf Belling (26 August 1886 – 9 June 1972) was a German sculptor. His work was part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

==Artistic theories==

At the very beginning of the 20th century Rudolf Belling&#x27;s name was something like a battlecry. The composer of the &quot;Dreiklang&quot; (triad) evoked frequent and hefty discussions. He was the first, who took up again thoughts of the famous Italian sculptor Benvenuto Cellini (1500–1570), who, at his time, stated, that a sculpture should show several good views. These were the current assumptions at the turn of the century. However they foreshadow an indication of sculpture being three-dimensional.

Rudolf Belling amplified: a sculpture should show only good views. And so he became an opponent to one of the German head scientists of art in Berlin, Adolf von Hildebrandt, who, in his book, &quot;The problem of Form in Sculpture&quot; (1903) said: &quot;Sculpture should be comprehensible – and should never force the observer to go round it&quot;. Rudolf Belling disproved the current theories with his works.

His theories of space and form convinced even critics like Carl Einstein and Paul Westheim, and influenced generations of sculptors after him. It is just this point which isn&#x27;t evident enough today.

==Departure from Germany==

From 1933 on, Belling had no chance to work in his home country. His works were marked as degenerate art, many of them were melted down or smashed. As his political opinions were also not in conformity with the Nazi regime, he was banned from working as well as from his membership of the Prussian Academy of Arts, Berlin. The academy president advised him in the name of the Prussian Minister of Education and Arts to resign.

In 1935, Rudolf Belling stayed for eight months in New York City, where he had an exhibition in the Weyhe Gallery with his most important works from the Modern Classic Period. He also gave courses of lectures on modern sculpture and his own theories. America offered him a marvellous possibility at that time to live his life there.

He returned to Germany because his nine-year-old son Thomas was in danger there since his mother, Rudolf Belling&#x27;s first wife, had been Jewish. He succeeded in saving his son and emigrated once again, in 1937, this time to Istanbul, Turkey. He lived and worked there for thirty years.

From 1937 to 1954 he was a lecturer at the Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul, re-organizing the department of sculpture and mediating introductions towards modern art, basing his work on traditional studies. In 1939, he managed to fly out his son illegally from Berlin to Turkey. In 1942, he married his second wife Yolanda Carolina Manzini, who was from an Italian-German family, and in 1943, his daughter Elisabeth was born.

From 1943 to 1944 he made a statue of İsmet İnönü realised in bronze, even though even the plinth was ready, due to the change of government in 1950 the statue was not erected. It was finally erected in 1982 in the Maçka Park. This statue is particularly notable as the first statue made of İnönü and it was (at least as of 1993) the 2nd largest İnönü statue in existence after the statue that was erected in the mid 1980s in the garden of İnönü&#x27;s house in Ankara. 

From 1951 to 1966, he was a lecturer at the Istanbul Technical University, at the department of architecture. He was a member of the selection committee that judged submissions for relief designs being made for the Anıtkabir which went on from 1951 to 1953. 1955, he got the Federal Cross of Merit. He was called back to the academy in West Berlin only in 1956, the same year the works which stayed in New York could be received back with the help of the Foreign Office.

At the age of eighty, he decided to return to West Germany again, where he lived in Krailling, near Munich. He died in Munich in June 1972, being highly decorated by the German government with the Federal Cross of Merit with Star.

The archive is meanwhile managed by his daughter Elisabeth Weber-Belling.

<text>The name United Rhodesia Party and the acronym, URP, refers to a political party in Southern Rhodesia.

At first the party was led by Sir Godfrey Huggins, and which in 1933 came to power in the colony. It was informally known as the United Party.

But then later it was led by former UFP premier of Southern Rhodesia, Sir Garfield Todd, during the time in which Southern Rhodesia was one of three territories within the Central African Federation (CAF). This revived URP, which stood to the left of the more centrist UFP, merged with the latter in 1958 following Todd&#x27;s defeat in the Territorial elections and the victory of the UFP, led at the time by Sir Edgar Whitehead.

<doc id="887677" wikidata="Q1568932" url="?curid=887677" title="Battle of Lowestoft">
<text>The Battle of Lowestoft took place on during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. A fleet of more than a hundred ships of the United Provinces commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer, Lord Obdam, attacked a British fleet of equal size commanded by James, Duke of York, forty miles east of the port of Lowestoft in Suffolk.

Although it was a substantial English victory, the escape of the bulk of the Dutch fleet deprived England of the chance of ending the war quickly with a single decisive victory. As a result, the Dutch were able to make good their losses by building new and better-armed ships and improving their organisation and discipline. Their Dutch fleets would not be so badly organised or ill-disciplined in the remaining battles of this war and, in Obdam&#x27;s replacement, Michiel de Ruyter, the Dutch had gained a superb tactician and leader for the remainder of the war.

== Background ==
The Second Anglo-Dutch War resulted from long-standing commercial tensions between England and the Netherlands. Despite diplomatic negotiations to avoid the outbreak of war, each country refused to compromise, and hostile acts by each side continued. The English ambassador in France reported that Louis XIV of France would probably evade his treaty obligations and refuse to be drawn into war with England if the Dutch could be provoked into declaring war: following English attacks on Dutch convoys, one off Cadiz and the other in the English Channel, the Dutch Republic did declare war on England on 4 March 1665. At the start of the war, both sides considered an early decisive battle was desirable, as English government finances could not sustain a long war, and as an English blockade of Dutch ports and attacks on their merchant and fishing fleets would soon bring about the ruin of the Dutch economy. After an early English blockade which took place in April and May was broken off through its ships&#x27; lack of supplies, the Dutch were desperate to prevent a second blockade. The Grand Pensionary and leading Dutch politician, Johan de Witt and other members of the States-General, formed a commission to supervise Obdam, which gave him detailed instructions comprising 26 articles, ordering him to attack the English aggressively when and where he could do them most damage. However, these instructions gave Obdam little guidance on how he should do so.

Although the Dutch had ordered the construction of many new warships, during and after the First Anglo-Dutch War, including several comparable to the all but the largest English ships to augment the existing fleet, not all of these were completed or fitted out by 1665. To complete Oddam&#x27;s fleet, eighteen older warships that had been laid up after the First Anglo-Dutch War were reactivated, and several very large Dutch East India Company built hybrid ships were added. These could be used for carrying cargo, as convoy escorts or in battle, although they were not as strongly built as pure warships. Perhaps realising that his fleet was still too inferior in organisation, training, discipline and firepower to challenge the English successfully in a decisive battle, Obdam prepared to postpone the fight until the wind turned favourable in order to seek a limited confrontation, with his fleet in a defensive leeward position from which it could disengage quickly and return to its ports without openly disobeying orders. However, this opportunistic attitude and lack of a clear strategic plan was a significant cause of his defeat and death. The instructions issued by the commission headed by de Witt insisted on specifying that the Dutch fleet&#x27;s order of battle should involve its division into a seven squadrons with a total of 21 flag officers for political reasons. Each of the five Dutch admiralties had its own set of flag officers, including many recently appointed ones. Each of the three smaller admiralties insisted on having its own squadron, so the larger Admiralties of Amsterdam and the Maas (i.e. Rotterdam) then split their forces in two squadrons, each of similar size to those of the smaller admiralties. This resulted in seven squadrons, each with three flag officers; several were led by Lieutenant Admirals of equal rank to Obdam, who commanded his own squadron as well as the whole fleet.

As the seven squadrons were not subdivided, the 14 subordinate flag officers had no clear function, except as potential replacements for their leaders. In addition, several squadrons had ships or flag officers from more than one admiralty, complicating their chain of command. Both national fleets could only be made as large as they were by employing armed merchants: the English used 24 of these, the Dutch twelve. On 11 June, a ship detached from the English fleet sighted the Dutch fleet sailing from the east with a light following breeze, and the fleet tried to close in on the Dutch against an adverse wind. At 4pm, the strength of the turning tide and a near calm forced the English fleet to anchor, and the Dutch did not make use of the favourable current to attack them, but also anchored, so avoiding battle that day. Obdam certainly wished to fight and had clear orders to do so, but an easterly breeze would prevent the Dutch fleet from retreating if it were outfought, and his waiting for a westerly breeze may have saved the bulk of the Dutch fleet from destruction by allowing it to withdraw after the resulting battle. On 12 June the wind again blew from the east, and again Obdam declined to attack, despite holding the weather gage. The two fleets sailed westward for most of the day, until the wind veered to a southerly, then a southwesterly, direction overnight. By dawn, the wind had strengthened and was from a direction between southwest and south, which slightly favoured the English fleet. Obdam decided to attack and he now approached the enemy, possibly fearing that if the wind became more westerly, it would favour the English fleet even more.

The English fleet of 109 ships carried 4,542 guns and 22,055 men; it consisted of three squadrons:
# Prince Rupert of the Rhine commanded the van, the White Squadron
# James himself commanded the centre, the Red Squadron, and
# Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich, commanded the rearguard, the Blue Squadron

The Dutch fleet of 103 ships carrying 4,869 guns and 21,613 men had no fewer than seven squadrons:
# First squadron, from the Admiralty of Amsterdam, commanded by van Wassenaer himself in 
# Second squadron, mainly from the Admiralties of Zeeland and the Maas, commanded by Lieutenant Admiral Johan Evertsen on &quot;Hof van Zeeland&quot;
# Third squadron from the Admiralty of Amsterdam, commanded by Lieutenant Admiral Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer on &quot;Groot Hollandia&quot;
# Fourth squadron, mainly from the Frisian fleet with some East Indies Company ships, commanded by Lieutenant Admiral Auke Stellingwerf on &quot;Sevenwolden&quot;
# Fifth squadron from the Admiralty of Amsterdam, commanded by Vice Admiral Cornelis Tromp on &quot;Liefde&quot;
# Sixth squadron, mainly from the Admiralties of Zeeland and the Maas, commanded by Vice Admiral Cornelis Evertsen the Elder on &quot;Vlissingen&quot; and
# Seventh squadron from the Admiralty of the Northern Quarter commanded by Vice Admiral Volckert Schram on &quot;Wapen van Nassau&quot;

== Battle ==
=== Morning ===

It is difficult to give a fully coherent account of the battle, and more so to recover the intentions of the commanders, particularly those of Obdam who did not survive the battle. He had, on 12 June, sent all of his silverware and other valuables home, which perhaps shows his state of mind. Although Obdam has been accused of lack both of leadership and tactical insight, masked in earlier battles where Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer, who had been promoted to be a lieutenant-admiral at Lowestoft, had been his flag captain. Although the English found Obdam&#x27;s behaviour puzzling, his tactical decisions may relate to his appreciation that his out-gunned, poorly organised fleet could only succeed in battle under ideal conditions and needed to be able to disengage if it risked defeat. After their defeat, the surviving Dutch flag officers, in order to exonerate themselves, pretended their fleet had followed the original written orders, blaming misfortune and cowardice among the merchant captains for the disaster. In the early morning of the 13th, both fleets were about 40 miles southeast of Lowestoft, with the Dutch fleet southeast of the English fleet. The wind was described as a &quot;fine chasing gale&quot;, implying a strong but not excessive wind, from a direction between southwest and south. Just before dawn, at around 4am, Obdam made a sudden westward dash to regain the weather gage, trying to pass to the south of the English fleet. In Sandwich&#x27;s account, Sir Christopher Myngs, leading the English van, immediately moved southeast to prevent this, and was able to retain the weather gage, forcing the leading Dutch ships to steer northwest, the two fleets passing in opposite directions but at some distance. As Obdam&#x27;s move surprised his own fleet, it was left in some confusion. An alternative interpretation was that the wind was blowing from the northwest and van Wassenaer tried to engage the English from a defensive leeward position. However, Warnsinck&#x27;s detailed account from a Dutch perspective confirms a southwest wind was blowing.

During this first pass, the &quot;Great Charity&quot; (originally an Amsterdam Directors&#x27; ship the &quot;Groote Liefde&quot;, which was captured during the Battle of Portland in 1653) became isolated to the east of the Dutch line and was boarded and captured by captain Jan den Haen, the later admiral, who immediately returned with his prize to the Netherlands. This obviously unsound practice would be prohibited in the Dutch fleet after this battle. Another English ship, the merchantman &quot;John &amp; Abigail&quot; was also isolated, but eventually managed to rejoin the English fleet. Later an English victory tune &quot;The Dutch Armado A Meer Bravado&quot; declared: &quot;Fortune was pleasant when she lent the Dutch our &#x27;Charity&#x27; a thing they wanted much.&quot; After this, there was a second pass that needed each fleet to reverse course. Penn had inserted a new article in the fleet&#x27;s Fighting Instructions requiring it to tack from the rear, so reversing the order of the fleet, but Penn later recounted that displaying the signal for this manoeuvre was delayed until after the Dutch fleet had already started to turn. Prince Rupert in the van, realising there was a problem, ordered his Red Squadron to reverse course while maintaining the same order, although his leading division under Myngs at first missed Rupert&#x27;s signal. Penn then cancelled his first order and the Duke led the centre and rear of his squadron to the northwest, but his leading division under Lawson ignored his admiral&#x27;s turn until the Blue Squadron under Sandwich began its own turn. This left a large gap to the rear of Rupert&#x27;s White Squadron. Fortunately for the English, the Dutch fleet was sufficiently far to the north to be unable to take immediate advantage of this gap and, from 6am to 7am, the two fleets were not engaged.

Penn&#x27;s solution to the developing Dutch threat, was bold: soon after 7am he steered the &quot;Royal Charles&quot; and the bulk of the Red Squadron to the west to form a second battleline to prevent Obdam gaining the weather gage. The Dutch made no attempt to do so, whether because of Penn&#x27;s manoeuvre or because their ships could not steer sufficiently westward against a southwesterly wind. In addition, Sandwich&#x27;s Blue Squadron had largely closed the gap left by Rupert&#x27;s squadron, and had formed in a rather disordered line behind him, with Lawson&#x27;s division following Sandwich. The fighting during this pass was at a closer range than in the first one, and the Dutch ships attempted to break through the English line: although three of their ships temporarily succeeded, they were soon forced back. Once the whole Dutch fleet was opposite the English, James and Penn decided to attempt the manoeuvre of tacking from the rear a second time. This required careful coordination and timing, but it was achieved under fire, such that Lawson&#x27;s division now led Sandwich, with Rupert in the rear. Following this, the two fleets were now moving in the same northwesterly direction at the same speed from about 8am. Up to this point, casualties had been relatively light, but in the heavy fighting that followed, the Frisian commander, Lieutenant-Admiral Auke Stellingwerf, was cut in two and the veteran Lieutenant-Admiral Kortenaer, probably the most competent Dutch commander present, was fatally wounded, both by cannonballs. Quartermaster Ate Stinstra then took command of Kortenaer&#x27;s ship.

All reports of the stage of the battle from late morning to midday are fragmentary. Although the English fleet had become disarranged through executing its tacking manoeuvres, the Dutch were in greater disarray and many Dutch ships failed to remain in a coherent line of battle. In theory, their being in a leeward position would have given the Dutch guns greater range, allowing them to destroy the rigging of the English ships from a safe distance with chain shot, but in reality the seven squadrons began to block each other&#x27;s line of fire. In addition, those flag officers and captains most hungry for battle quickly left the less enthusiastic officers and older ships behind, while company ships were untrained in the tactics of fighting in formation. As far as can be established, Kortenaer&#x27;s squadron led the Dutch fleet, ranged against Lawson, followed by Johan Evertsen and Obdam, who were mainly opposing Sandwich&#x27;s squadron, with Tromp and Cornelis Evertsen towards the rear, facing Rupert. The ships of the Dutch fourth and seventh squadrons were scattered throughout the line, and most of the English Red Squadron formed a separate line to the west of the main area of combat, remaining almost out of range of Dutch gunfire for several hours. Around midday, Lawson&#x27;s flagship, the &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, left the line having suffered significant damage, with Lawson himself wounded. He was quickly replaced by Joseph Jordan, who soon returned the flagship to lead its division.

=== Afternoon ===
The long gunnery contest continued until around 2pm, with the Dutch putting significant pressure on the English Blue Squadron, while holding their own elsewhere, because much of the Red Squadron was largely inactive. However, James and Penn began to send reinforcements to assist Sandwich around noon. The fiercest fighting of the early afternoon was between Obdam&#x27;s and Sandwich&#x27;s squadrons, the latter of which was concentrating its fire and heavily damaging the opposing Dutch ships. Obdam&#x27;s flagship &quot;Eendracht&quot; and about five other large Dutch ships tried to break through Sandwich&#x27;s squadron, and men from the giant Dutch East Indies ship &quot;Oranje&quot; under its captain Bastian Senten boarded and temporarily took over one of Sandwich&#x27;s ships, the &quot;Montague&quot;. However James and Penn sent the &quot;Old James&quot; of 68 guns under Earl of Marlborough against the &quot;Oranje&quot;, whiled he and Penn sailed the against the &quot;Eendracht&quot; in support of Sandwich&#x27;s flagship . These reinforcements forced Senten to recall his boarders and the Dutch to abandon their attempted breakthrough: this attempt and its repulse created considerable disorder among the Dutch ships. Both Sandwich, who was close to the centre of the action and, simultaneously but independently, Rupert further away, noticed the Dutch disarray, and embarked on attacks which were to decide the outcome of the battle. Sandwich attempted to break through the Dutch centre and four of the Dutch ships trying to oppose him ran into one another. As these ships failed to surrender, they were later attacked by an English fireship, and only one escaped being burned. Other Dutch ships retreated. To the north, Tromp and Cornelis Evertsen tried to seize the weather gage from Rupert, who retained it while continuing to inflict severe damage to his opponents.

While these two English attacks were taking place, the Duke of York attacked the &quot;Eendracht&quot;. A Dutch chain-shot from Obdam&#x27;s flagship narrowly missed James and killed several of his courtiers on the &quot;Royal Charles&quot;, the Hon. Richard Boyle (son of Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington), Viscount Muskerry and the Earl of Falmouth. The last, who was untalented and little regarded was decapitated, leading the poet Andrew Marvell, using the pseudonym John Denham) to write a brutal epitaph: &quot;His shattered head the fearless Duke disdains, and gave the last first proof that he had Brains&quot;. However, casualties on the &quot;Eendracht&quot; were even more severe, with Obdam being killed on its quarterdeck by a cannonball and, a few minutes after his death, at about 3pm, its magazine exploded without warning, destroying the ship and killing all but five of its crew. The loss of the flagship and death of its commander, just as the English Blue and White squadrons were attacking, seriously affected Dutch morale, which was further damaged by the uncertainty over his successor. The next most senior flag officer was Johan Evertsen of Zeeland, who was distrusted by the politicians of the dominant province of Holland, who had therefore nominated Egbert Kortenaer to be Obdam&#x27;s successor before the battle. Kortenaer had been fatally wounded and was incapable of command, but Stinstra, his flag captain kept Kortenaer&#x27;s flag as admiral of the third Squadron flying and, unnerved by the explosion of the &quot;Eendracht&quot;, he fled the battle, followed by many ships of that squadron, which assumed that they should follow their leader&#x27;s flag. Seeing, as he thought, Kortenaer had abdicated his responsibility, Johan Evertsen raised a pendant showing he commanded the fleet, but Cornelis Tromp, the senior Amsterdam officer also raised a command pendant adding to the confusion, as three ships claimed to be fleet flagship.

By this stage, any semblance of lines of battle had disappeared, and the battle took on the appearance of a gigantic and shapeless mêlée, although the more aggressive English fleet was in fact forcing many of the Dutch ships, unnerved by the loss of the &quot;Eendracht&quot; or following Kortenaer&#x27;s flag in the &quot;Groot Hollandia&quot;, to retreat. A complete Dutch rout was prevented only by what ships rallied to Evertsen or Tromp and the action of the &quot;Oranje&quot;, which fought off several opponents for around two hours until, shattered and sinking it surrendered and was burned. These Dutch forces allowed the bulk of their fleet, which had lost all cohesion by around 6pm, to gain a headstart on any English pursuit. During this stage, the Earl of Marlborough and the Earl of Portland were killed and the ships of Lawson&#x27;s division of the Red Squadron and Teddiman&#x27;s division of the Blue Squadron joined the main battle forcing more Dutch ships to retreat. Between 6pm and 9pm, the larger English ships concentrated, on forcing first Evertsen and then Tromp into retreat and mopping-up Dutch ships too damaged to escape, capturing three. Tromp later claimed that his rearguard action prevented greater losses, as many of the fleeing Dutch ships&#x27; crews were demoralised and would not fight any English pursuers. As Sandwich had broken through the Dutch fleet, it disintegrated in its flight into a number of separate bodies, escaping to different ports. Tromp led one group to Texel, followed by Rupert, Johan Evertsen retreated with another contingent to the Maas () pursued by the rest of the English fleet, and other ships headed for the Scheldt. However, the English commanders did not order a general chase by releasing their faster ships to overtake the slower of the Dutch fugitives, but remained in squadron. At around 9pm, Sandwich even ordered his squadron to shorten sail so that the White Squadron could catch up and the Duke of York assume command.

Much more damaging, however, was the decision taken for the &quot;Royal Charles&quot; to reduce sail during the night. Significant controversy surrounds this incident, and several explanations have been proposed to explain it. An account which relies on the reported testimonies of Penn and Harman suggests that Lord Henry Brouncker, James&#x27; master of the bedchamber, either from fear or because he had promised the Duchess of York to keep the Duke from danger, first approached William Penn, the Captain of the Fleet asking him to slacken sail, reminding him that the Duke was heir presumptive and that his death would be a disaster. Penn refused, stating that only James could order this, but he then went below. Brouncker next approached the captain of the &quot;Royal Charles&quot; John Harman, this time pretending that the order to take in sail did come from James. When &quot;Royal Charles&quot; reduced sail in the course of the night, the rest of the English fleet followed suit. According to another account, Penn was said to have remarked that James, having narrowly escaped death in the battle, had lost his nerve completely. Brouncker later fled for his life rather than face a Parliamentary enquiry after the war, which could have condemned him. When, on the morning of 14 June, the fastest English frigates were sent ahead of the main fleet, they captured six Dutch ships, some of which defended themselves honourably, but others offered little resistance: these were in addition to three captures on the previous evening. The results of what had been a notable victory were less than might have been expected, firstly through the rearguard actions of Tromp and Johan Evertsen which allowed many Dutch ships to disengage from the battle and secondly the failure to release the faster frigates from the main fleet in pursuit of the fleeing Dutch, which could have been ordered as early as 6pm. These small but fast ships had taken little part in the main action, but their activities on the morning of 14 June showed what could have been achieved. The controversial slowing-down of the whole fleet at night simply exacerbated this earlier failure.

== Aftermath ==

The English lost only one ship, the captured &quot;Great Charity&quot; mentioned above. Eight Dutch ships were sunk by the English; six of these were burnt in two separate incidents when they got entangled while fleeing and each group was set ablaze by a fire ship: this happened to the &quot;Tergoes&quot; entangling with the company ship &quot;Maarseveen&quot; and the merchantman &quot;Swanenburg&quot;; also to the &quot;Koevorden&quot;, the &quot;Stad Utrecht&quot; and the &quot;Prinse Maurits&quot;. The earlier mentioned company ship &quot;Oranje&quot; was set on fire after being reduced to a wreck when fighting off several English ships. The first to attack was one of the Duke of York&#x27;s squadron, the &quot;Mary&quot; under captain Jeremiah Smith, which lost 99 men of its crew in this action, followed later by the , the and the . According to some accounts, the &quot;Oranje&quot; lost half of its crew of 400 before succumbing, a severely wounded Senten (rumoured to be an expatriate Scotsman) was picked up by an English vessel and shortly after he also died. During the Dutch flight, the English captured nine more ships: &quot;Hilversum&quot;, &quot;Delft&quot;, &quot;Zeelandia&quot;, &quot;Wapen van Edam&quot; and &quot;Jonge Prins&quot;; the VOC-ship &quot;Nagelboom&quot; and the merchants &quot;Carolus Quintus&quot;, &quot;Mars&quot; and &quot;Geldersche Ruyter&quot;. &quot;Tromp&quot; was captured but escaped. Eight older ships had to be written off later, as the costs of repairing them would have exceeded their value. The English fleet had lost one flag officer, Rear-Admiral Robert Samsun during the battle, while Vice-Admiral Lawson was mortally wounded and died three weeks after the battle. Notable English admirals and captains present at the battle included William Penn in the , Christopher Myngs and George Ayscue.

The escape of most of the Dutch fleet was more significant than its losses, as only its destruction as a fighting force would have given England the early victory it needed. That possibility became more remote as senior Dutch sea officers and politicians began to consider the reasons for the disaster at Lowestoft and identified three principal causes. The first was the lack of discipline that was dealt with by severely punishing the worst offenders while rewarding success. The second was tactical, as the favoured Dutch tactic of the undisciplined mêlée, with individual ships boarding and capturing their opponent and, in many cases, leaving the battle with their prize, was ineffective against English gunnery on ships fighting in line. Although de Ruyter did partially revert to mêlée tactics in the last day of the Four Days Battle., fighting in line became the standard tactic in new Fighting Instructions approved by the States General in August 1665. The final cause was the inferiority of Dutch ships which, though well-constructed, were generally smaller and more lightly armed than those of other maritime nations. Although there had been a significant building programme after the First Anglo-Dutch War, only &quot;Eendracht&quot; and &quot;Groot Hollandia&quot;, built as fleet flagship, were comparable to English ships of the third-rate. Although from 1660 the Dutch embarked on an expansion programme, many were smaller ships and only one exceeded the size of the &quot;Eendracht&quot;, equaling an English second-rate. This building programme was greatly expanded after the outbreak of the war, but none of its ships had been completed by the time of Lowestoft. Compared with the Dutch fleet at the Four Days&#x27; Battle in June 1666, Obdam had a fleet comprising many older and smaller vessels and fewer modern ones. It relied strongly on the East Indies Company&#x27;s ships and other merchantmen, although these did not have the resilience of true warships. There were no East Indies Company ships in the battles of 1666, and the few merchant ships present were not in the line of battle but acted as auxiliaries.

Although Tromp and Evertsen were ordered by the commissioners from the States General to return to sea with as many ships as possible, in the recriminations that followed the battle, Tromp refused, denouncing a number of captains for disobedience or cowardice and the States General formed a commission to inspect the ships and question the captains of those that seemed to have suffered little damage. Although about two dozen ships showed were found to have suffered little damage, only ten captains were charged with cowardice Nine captains were brought to trial: three were shot before the fleet, three exiled and three dismissed from their commands. A tenth captain, Laurens Heemskerck, who had fled from the Netherlands in 1665, fearing he would be tried for cowardice in the battle, was afterwards condemned &quot;in absentia&quot; to perpetual banishment from the Netherlands. Heemskerck assisted England in planning the attack on the Vlie and later, in 1672, fought on the French side against his countrymen at the Battle of Solebay. Although there was considerable dissatisfaction with the conduct of a number of ships&#x27; crews, the States General did not investigate these, considering that the fault lay with their captains. There were also disputes about who should be promoted to fill the places of the two deceased admirals. The Dutch attempted to learn lessons from their defeat. The Admiralty of Zeeland instructed its flag officers and captains to avoid lengthy and disadvantageous gun battles and to practice drills aimed at boarding and capturing enemy ships. In August 1665 the deputies of the States General in discussion with Tromp and other admirals issued revised combat instruction that became the basis of Dutch naval tactics for the rest of the Second Anglo-Dutch War and for the Third Anglo-Dutch War. The main points of these instruction were the division of the fleet into three distinct squadrons, each with a clear chain of command, improved signalling and the application of the principle of the concentration of superior force against part of the enemy fleet. These instructions implicitly criticised the division of the fleet at Lowestoft into seven squadrons with unclear chains of command but also Obdam&#x27;s cautious tactics.

<text>Swan Hunter, formerly known as Swan, Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson, is a shipbuilding design, engineering, and management company, based in Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, England.

At its apex, the company represented the combined forces of three powerful shipbuilding families: Swan, Hunter and Wigham Richardson.

The company was responsible for some of the greatest ships of the early 20th century, most famously which held the Blue Riband for the fastest crossing of the Atlantic, and which rescued survivors from .

In 2006 &quot;Swan Hunter&quot; ceased vessel construction on Tyneside, but continues to provide design engineering services.

==History==
Swan &amp; Hunter was founded by George Burton Hunter, who formed a partnership with the widow of Charles Sheridan Swan (the owner of a Wallsend Shipbuilding business established in 1852 by Charles Mitchell) under the name in 1880.

In 1903, C.S. Swan &amp; Hunter merged with Wigham Richardson (founded by John Wigham Richardson as Neptune Works in 1860), specifically to bid for the important contract to build on behalf of Cunard. Their bid was successful, and the new company, Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Ltd, went on to build what was to become, in its day, the most famous oceangoing liner in the world. Also in 1903, the Company took a controlling interest in the Wallsend Slipway &amp; Engineering Company, which was an early licensed manufacturer of Parsons steam turbine engines, which enabled &quot;Mauretania&quot; to achieve her great speed. &quot;Mauretania&quot; was launched from Wallsend on 20 September 1906 by the Duchess of Roxburghe. The firm expanded rapidly in the early part of the twentieth century, acquiring the Glasgow-based Barclay Curle in 1912.

In 1966, Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson merged with Smiths Dock Company to form &quot;Associated Shipbuilders&quot;, which later became &quot;Swan Hunter Group&quot;. Following the publication of the &quot;Geddes Report&quot; recommending rationalisation in British shipbuilding, the Company went on to acquire Clelands Shipbuilding Company and John Readhead &amp; Sons in 1967. Meanwhile, Swan Hunter inherited both the Naval Yard at High Walker on the River Tyne of Vickers-Armstrongs and the Hebburn Yard of Hawthorn Leslie in 1968. In 1973 further expansion came with the purchase of Palmers Dock at Hebburn from Vickers-Armstrongs.

Then in 1977, Swan Hunter Group was nationalised as part of British Shipbuilders. The former flagship of the Royal Navy, was built at Swan Hunter during this period, entering service in 1985.

The Company was privatised again in 1987 but decided to close its Neptune Yard in 1988. It was then forced to call in the receivers when the UK government awarded the contract for to Kvaerner Govan in 1993. The receiver took steps to break up the business. However, the main shipyard in Wallsend was bought out from receivership by Jaap Kroese, a Dutch millionaire. The yard subsequently undertook several ad-hoc ship repair and conversion projects for private-sector customers.
In 2000, Swan Hunter was awarded the contract to design and build two (Auxiliary) Landing Ship Dock ships for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary with two other ships being built by BAE Systems Naval Ships: the cost of the two Swan Hunter ships was to be £210 million including £62 million for lead yard services, with an inservice date of 2004. By July 2006, the costs had risen to £309 million and only one ship had been delivered. As a result of this, the second ship was transferred to BAE Systems Govan in Glasgow for completion.

In 2001, Swan Hunter acquired Kværner&#x27;s Port Clarence offshore yard at Teesside but then in 2006 sold it to Wilton Engineering Group.

In November 2006, after the failure to complete &quot;Lyme Bay&quot; within budget and resulting exclusion from future Royal Navy shipbuilding projects, Jaap Kroese announced that the business was effectively finished and placed the Wallsend Yard&#x27;s iconic cranes up for sale. He also said that he was actively looking for a buyer for the land. During this time, &quot;Lyme Bay&quot;″s earlier sister ship, &quot;Largs Bay&quot;, was noted as the last ship to be built and fully completed by Swan Hunter. In April 2007, Swan Hunter&#x27;s cranes, along with its floating dock and other equipment, were sold to Bharati Shipyards, India&#x27;s second-largest private-sector shipbuilder. The entire plant machinery and equipment from Swan Hunter was dismantled and transported to India over six months to be rebuilt at Bharati Shipyards.

Swan&#x27;s performed the conceptual design of &quot;Pioneering Spirit&quot;, provisionally named &quot;Pieter Schelte&quot;, the world&#x27;s largest platform installation/decommissioning and pipelay vessel. The basic design of the lifting systems was completed by the end of 2008, and detailed design of the hulls by May 2010.

In 2008, the company said it was concentrating on ship design with just under 200 people employed.

In 2016, Jaap Kroese died but the company said it would continue with its business of ship design. At the time, the company had 40 employees and contractors.

Also in 2016, Swan Hunter was relaunched into the subsea industry by Gerard Kroese, the eldest son of former owner Jaap Kroese. Swan Hunter started to offer specialist equipment, design, engineering &amp; project management services to the offshore renewables and subsea oil &amp; gas energy markets. On 12 October 2016, the company announced the issue of a letter of intent for the design and build of a basket carousel loading tower. The company announced further equipment pool growth through a 15Te tensioner and 450Te reel drive system. Swan Hunter announced loading tower readiness on 5 May 2017 with completion of mobilisation onto EMAS Chiyoda Subsea&#x27;s multi-lay vessel &#x27;Lewek Constellation&#x27; shortly thereafter.

==Operations==
The Company owned three main yards:
* The Neptune Yard at Walker-on-Tyne inherited from Wigham Richardson (opened in 1860 and closed in 1988)
* The Wallsend West Yard at Wallsend inherited from Charles Sheridan Swan (opened in 1842 and closed in 2006)
* The Naval Yard at High Walker inherited from Vickers-Armstrongs (opened in 1912 and closed during the 1980s)
All three were on the north side of River Tyne. The company also owned the Wallsend Slipway &amp; Engineering Company, the yard that built the engines for the Mauretania, from 1903 until the 1980s. At various times Swan Hunter also owned Palmers Hebburn Yard, Hawthorn Leslie Hebburn Yard and Readheads at South Shields which were all on the south side of the River Tyne.

<text>Rear of the Year was a British award for celebrities who were considered to have attractive buttocks. It was created by publicity consultant Anthony Edwards in 1976. Initially, it was awarded only to women, but in 1986 the first award was made to a man and from 1997, it was awarded annually to one woman and one man.

The award was organised by Rear of the Year Limited. The last contest was held in 2019, and Rear of the Year Limited was dissolved as a company in 2021. 

==History==
Edwards initiated the award as a way to promote specific brands of jeans. Barbara Windsor won the first award in 1976, which was presented as a one-off publicity stunt. Five years later it became an annual event with Felicity Kendal receiving the honours. The 1982 winner Suzi Quatro commented: &quot;I’ve been told since I was about eight or nine that I had a nice ass... So, when I won the award, I was actually quite proud.&quot; The singer Lulu, who won the 1983 award, was later asked by a journalist if she felt that she had been the subject of objectification when she won the award, and replied: &#x27;I think you&#x27;re taking this all much too seriously&#x27;. On winning the award in 1985, Lynsey de Paul quipped &quot;I would like to thank the organisers from the heart of my bottom&quot;. In 1986, the award was presented to a man for the first time (Michael Barrymore) and 1991 saw Marina Ogilvy, the daughter of Princess Alexandra, became the first royal recipient. A male award was given to Richard Fairbrass in 1994 and from 1997 the male award became a regular part of the annual event. The 2002 award to Charlotte Church attracted controversy as the winner had only recently turned 16 at the time.

2010 winner Fiona Bruce accepted the award and participated in a photoshoot, happily posing for pictures in tight jeans. However, she subsequently described the award as &quot;the most hypocritical, ridiculous, ludicrous thing I’ve ever done.&quot;

In 2014, Carol Vorderman became the first person to receive the award for a second time, joking: &quot;I always suspected there were a lot of people out there who were glad to see the back of me. It now appears there were even more than I thought.&quot;

The winners of the award were selected by public vote, a process that sometimes accrued popular campaigns for particular individuals. The winners were usually actors in soap operas, contestants in reality TV shows or pop stars. Edwards has described the contest as &quot;an excellent monitor of fashions in body shape&quot;. In 2012 he declared that female rears were starting to slim down as more women took to the gym, jogging and keeping trim during that Olympic year. In 2018 he said that &quot;the trend is towards a shapely, well-toned and, above all, proportionate rear&quot;.

A number of businesses sponsored the award including manufacturers of beauty products, Cadbury and Wizard Jeans. By 2015 the award was reported to be generating a level of media coverage equivalent to £4 million (US$ million) Advertising Value Equivalent.

Award winners were given a commemorative plaque in the form of an engraved crystal trophy. Until 2016 the award was promoted with a winner&#x27;s photo op that was reported in the UK&#x27;s tabloid newspapers. The event, staged for some years at The Dorchester hotel in London, was attended by numerous press photographers and included a champagne reception. Some winners subsequently described ambivalent feelings about their photo ops, during which they were photographed from behind. 2007 winner Siân Lloyd described hers as &quot;probably the weirdest photocall I’ve attended in my life&quot;, while 2003 winner Natasha Hamilton said of seeing her pictures in the press: &quot;I just didn’t like it. It seemed a little bit crass and seedy.&quot;

<text>Vinayagar Agaval is a devotional poetic hymn to the Hindu deity Ganesha. It was written in the 10th century during the Chola dynasty by the Tamil poet Avvaiyar, shortly before her death. It is considered to be her greatest poem. The 72-line &#x27;Agaval&#x27; is a form of blank verse, close to speech.

&quot;Vinayagar Agaval&quot; defines a religious path, part of the Tamil devotional tradition of Bhakti, within the Hindu philosophy of the Shaivite sect. Its application as a spiritual tool begins during concentration on a physical image of Ganesha and continues with the use of the Agaval&#x27;s description of Hindu spiritual belief and practice, and aspects of the teachings on human life attributed to the deity.


meaning is, the Lotus feet of Ganesha having the color of red lotus, and which is besmeared with cool sandal is adorned by anklets, sings various songs.golden waist belt and his clothes as soft as flower shine like beautiful colors in the rainbow.

According to Chandrasekarendra Swamigal, a person reciting the &quot;Vinayagar Agaval&quot; every day will realize highest wisdom.

==Translation (Lyrics in English)==

Cool, white and fragrant lotus like feet, 
with anklets tinkling sweet in multitude beat, 
gold girdle, garments as soft as flower, 
colorfully wrapping your comely hips lower,

belly like a pot and big, heavy tusk, 
elephant-face with the perfect red mark, 
five hands, the goad, the noose in hands apart, 
dwelling divine beautiful blue body in my heart,

With pendulous mouth and one with four mighty shoulder, 
having three eyes that denotes three sect marks bolder, 
two ears, the gold crown gleaming on your head, 
the breast glowing with the holy triple thread.

Oh divine turya knowledge, Beautiful beyond word, 
who came as wish-fulfilling elephant, we heard. 
Oh mouse-rider, fond of the three famed fruit, 
desire to make me yours this instant, takes root,

Having appeared before me, like a mother, 
Cutting delusion of unending births, not another. 
imprinting the five prime letters, clearly, 
You have come and entered my heart, dearly.

Stepped in the form of a teacher, into my world, 
Thine divine feet, pointing to the priceless, gold, 
With the divine knowledge without fatigue, blessed, 
With that unfailing weapon, my heinous sins, severed.

Uncloying pure precepts, poured in my ear, 
clarity of ever-fresh awareness, laid bare - 
for firm control of all of my senses, five, 
out of kindness, thou have blessed me high.

Brought the idea of the organs of action, controlled, 
snapped my two-fold karma and my darkness dispelled, 
a place for me in all four states, your grant, 
dissolved the illusion of triple filth,

Using a single name over the temple with nine-door, 
five-door senses now under control, free no more, 
fixed me firm in all of the six yogic center, 
Stabilized in myself, speechless joy, I enter.

of ida and pingala, having been introduced, 
last the head of sushumna, to me, you showed, 
three bright spheres of sun, moon and fire, 
To the tongue of the serpent that sinks and soar.

Having achieved the energy of Kundali assemblage, 
and explicitly uttered it purely through your grace; 
flame of muladhara, collected in me and raging, 
imparted the skill of breath, steadily rising.

The state of immortality, the sun&#x27;s moving trend 
and the charm of the moon; the water lily&#x27;s friend, 
the sixteen states of the chakras intermediary, 
revealed to me in thoughtful wisdom in my body.

the six-faced form and four-faced body subtle, 
and the eight separate modes of my eternal soul; 
Given me understanding of subtle body that is divine, 
Miraculous powers, my mind is open to your design.

the never-closing gateway of Brahman opened so, 
You have also given me the final mukti, too; 
revealed my Self to me and by your grace 
My accumulated karma, swept of the base.

State beyond speech and thought, in tranquil calm 
You clarified my intellect, this is now my form. 
making me experience, at the spot between two eyes, 
through your divine blessing, between my ears, bliss.

You have given me the state of boundless elation, 
showing me the way of grace, ending all affliction, 
As the core of the sound Om, I have seen Sadasiva, 
At the core of my mind, you have shown me lingasiva.

atom within atom, vast beyond all vastness, 
hid in the hardened node, having tasted sweetness. 
You have steadied me clear in human form, devoid of duality, 
added me to the congregation of your servants true and trusty.

Of the Five-handed one, the absolute true essence, 
You have given it to me in my heart, the experience, 
restored my real state to me; and will rule me now, 
Oh Master of Wisdom, Vinayaka, to thine feet alone, I bow, 
Oh Master of Wisdom, Vinayaka, to thine feet alone, I bow.

== History and etymology ==
===Etymology===

The term &quot;tattoo&quot; derives from a 17th-century Dutch phrase &quot;doe den tap toe&quot; (&quot;turn off the tap&quot;) a signal to tavern owners each night, played by a regiment&#x27;s Corps of Drums, to turn off the taps of their ale kegs so that the soldiers would retire to their billeted lodgings at a reasonable hour. With the establishment of modern barracks and full military bands later in the 18th century, the term &quot;tattoo&quot; was used to describe the last duty call of the day, as well as a ceremonial form of evening entertainment performed by military musicians.

===Origins===
The first public military tattoo in Edinburgh was entitled &quot;Something About a Soldier&quot; and took place in 1949 at the Ross Bandstand in the Princes Street Gardens. The first official Edinburgh Military Tattoo, with eight items in the programme, was held in 1950. It drew some 6,000 spectators seated in simple bench and scaffold structures around the north, south, and east sides of the Edinburgh Castle esplanade. In 2018, the stands were able to accommodate a nightly audience of 8,800, allowing 220,000 to watch the multiple live performances.

===Seating expansion===
Since the 1970s, on average, just over 220,000 people see the Tattoo live on the esplanade of Edinburgh Castle each year (8,800 each evening). Before the cancellation of the 2020 and 2021 editions due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the Tattoo had sold out for 22 consecutive seasons beginning in 1998. According to a submission by the Tattoo to the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, 2020 ticket sales indicated that 30% of the audience were from Scotland and 32% from the rest of the United Kingdom. The remaining 38% were international visitors from 69 countries.
The temporary grandstands on the castle esplanade, used in 2018, had a capacity of 8,800. New £16 million spectator stands and corporate hospitality boxes came into use in 2011. The new temporary stands reduced the time taken to erect and dismantle them from the original two months to one month, allowing the esplanade to host events at other times of the year.

==Performances==

The Tattoo performance takes place every weekday evening and twice on Saturdays throughout August and has never been cancelled due to inclement weather. However, in 2020 and 2021 the performances were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2010 the event became the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo after HM Queen Elizabeth awarded the Royal title in celebration of its six decades of existence. Since 2012, each performance has included a fireworks display. From 2005 to 2015, a &quot;son et lumière&quot; element projected on to the facade of the Castle. In 2016, the projection technology on the castle was upgraded to utilize modern projection mapping technology. In 2018, laser technology was used for the first time.

Since 2004, the Edinburgh Military Tattoo has also held free abridged performances at the Ross Bandstand in Princes Street Gardens, entitled &quot;Taste of the Tattoo&quot;, and as of 2008 also in George Square in Glasgow. The Edinburgh Military Tattoo has also toured overseas, visiting New Zealand in 2000 as part of the Tattoo&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebrations. It visited Australia in 2005 and returned to the Sydney Football Stadium in February 2010 as part of the Tattoo&#x27;s 60th anniversary celebrations. In February 2016 the Tattoo sold 240,000 tickets when it was staged in Wellington, New Zealand and Melbourne Australia. The performance was held at ANZ Stadium, Sydney in October 2019. There were also plans to take the show to China in 2020, with performances in Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic these plans were suspended.

, Anne, Princess Royal is the patron of the event, with the main corporate sponsor being Edinburgh Airport.

===International exposure===
In 2018 the Tattoo was planned to be televised to 40 countries allowing an estimated 100–300 million people see the event on television worldwide. In Britain the BBC broadcasts the event annually, with commentary in 2009 and 2010 provided by BBC Radio Scotland presenter Iain Anderson. Bill Paterson provided commentary from 2011 to 2019; before 2009 Tom Fleming commentated, not missing a year between 1966 and 2008. In Australia the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) traditionally telecasts the Tattoo on the evening of New Year&#x27;s Eve, although in a break with tradition, the 2006 Tattoo was broadcast a day earlier on 30 December, the 2007 Tattoo was broadcast even earlier on Christmas Eve, and the 2009 Tattoo was broadcast two days after New Year&#x27;s Eve on 2 January 2010. These changes were made so the ABC could expand its news coverage of local New Year celebrations.

The Tattoo is run for charitable causes and in 2017 it was estimated that over the years has given £10 million to the arts, military and civilian charities and organisations, such as the Army Benevolent Fund. The event also generates up to £100 million in revenue for Edinburgh&#x27;s economy annually, according to estimates by the Tattoo itself.

Launched in 2002, the official magazine of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, &quot;Salute&quot;, is distributed free to sponsors, friends of the Tattoo, and visiting performers.

===Performance structure===

Each performance begins with a fanfare, usually composed for that year&#x27;s show. The Massed Pipes and Drums then perform, marching through the gatehouse of the castle and performing a traditional pipe band set. Then, the show&#x27;s featured acts perform individually.

== Performers ==

Each service is usually represented by bands from the British Armed Forces, along with drill and display teams as well. On special occasions, the Tattoo will feature bands from more than one service at the same time. In both 2002 and 2012, bands from all three services were featured to mark Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden and Diamond Jubilees. In 2003, the music of Westlife was featured at the event.

From 1950 until 1994, the show mainly featured acts from military organizations. However, the show began to diversify and feature civilian acts beginning in 1995. While this was initially met with resistance from some fans, the inclusion of civilian acts has become more and more present in the show over time. One of the most popular acts featured at the Tattoo is the Top Secret Drum Corps from Basel, which has performed in the 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018, and 2022 Tattoos. By 2018 performers from 48 countries had appeared in the tattoo since its inception.

Since 2014, a house pipe band was introduced to allow individual pipers and drummers from not only Scotland but across many parts of the world to play in the Tattoo. Known as The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo Pipes and Drums, they join in with the massed pipes and drums each year and are the first pipe band with no military connections to play in the Tattoo.

A stage band made up of volunteer musicians from around the world was assembled for the 2019 program. The 2022 programme included Banda Monumental de Mexico, the United States Army Field Band in its debut Tattoo performance, the Highland Divas, the New Zealand Army Band and the United States Air Force Honor Guard Drill team.

===Guards of honour===

Several other units have also been invited to provide sentries for the Castle Drawbridge and/or form the guard of honour for the performance&#x27;s finale. They include:

<doc id="887704" wikidata="Q3522676" url="?curid=887704" title="Tirumantiram">
<text>The Tirumantiram () or Thirumantiram is a Tamil poetic work, written either in the 2nd century BCE and 4th century CE by Tirumular. It is the tenth of the twelve volumes of the &quot;Tirumurai&quot;, the key texts of Shaiva Siddhanta and the first known Tamil work to use the term. The &quot;Tirumantiram&quot; is the earliest known exposition of the Shaiva Agamas in Tamil. It consists of over three thousand verses dealing with various aspects of spirituality, ethics and praise of Shiva. But it is more spiritual than religious and one can see the difference between Vedanta and Siddhanta from Tirumular&#x27;s interpretation of the Mahavakyas. According to historian Venkatraman, the work covers almost every feature of the siddhar of the Tamils. According to another historian, Madhavan, the work stresses on the fundamentals of Siddha medicine and its healing powers. It deals with a wide array of subjects including astronomy and physical culture.

== Etymology ==
Tirumantiram&#x27;s literal meaning is &quot;sacred mantra&quot; or &quot;holy incantation.&quot;

==Content==

The &quot;Tirumantiram&quot; is divided into nine chapters, 9 tantras ():

* 1. Philosophical views and divine experience, impermanency of the physical body, love, education etc.
* 2. Shiva&#x27;s glory, His divine acts, classification of souls etc.
* 3. Yoga practices according to the eight-angled way of Patanjali. Also refers to Vasi Yoga
* 4. Mantra, tantra, etc.
* 5. Various branches of Saiva religion; the four elements of Shaiva Siddhanta.
* 6. Shiva as &quot;guru&quot; bestowing grace and the devotee&#x27;s responsibility.
* 7. Shiva linga, Shiva worship, self-control.
* 8. The stages of soul experience.
* 9. &quot;Panchadsara manthiram&quot;, Shiva&#x27;s dance, the state of samadhi.

The poems have a unique metrical structure, each line consisting of 11 or 12 syllables depending on the initial syllable. Tirumular discusses the four steps of spiritual progress; &quot;Charya&quot;, &quot;Kriya&quot;, &quot;Yoga&quot; and &quot;Gnana&quot;, the Shaiva Siddhanta concept of &quot;Pati&quot;, &quot;Pasu&quot; and &quot;Pasa&quot; where Pati stands for Shiva, Pasu stands for the humankind and Pasa stands for Maya (the desire), &quot;sadhana&quot;, &quot;Vedanta&quot;, the Upanishadic &quot;Tat tvam asi&quot; and other Vedantic concepts, the transcendental reality as emptiness &quot;(Sunya)&quot; devoid of any attribute and &quot;Tantrasastra&quot; (Shakti worship), &quot;chakras&quot;, magic spells and their accessories.

The section on Yoga, called &quot;Shiva yoga&quot;, offers details not found in the Sanskrit text of Patanjali. The &quot;Tirumantiram&quot; describes means of attaining an immortal body &quot;(kaya siddhi)&quot;, advocating a theory of preserving the body so that the soul would continue its existence ().

Tirumular is not only one of the 63 Nayanmars (Nayanars) but also a significant one among the 18 Siddhars. Tirumular has been referred to as &quot;Nampiran&quot; (meaning: nam-Our, piran-God, thus thirumular has been called as a leader or god to all the remaining Nayanars) by Sundarar in his thiru thondar thogai (the earliest song which mentions the names of 63 Nayanars). Tirumular as a moral philosopher teaches the ethics of non-violence (ahimsa), abstinence from slaughtering, meat and alcohol. He condemns coveting another man&#x27;s wife. He declares that &quot;love is God&quot;, proclaims the unity of mankind and God and stresses the acquisition of knowledge.

The final section of the Tirumantiram, named &quot;Sunya Sambhashana&quot; (&quot;Colloquy on the Void&quot;), is full of metaphorical sayings communicating mystical and speculative thoughts, for example;

<text>Heide Park Resort, commonly known as Heide Park, is a theme park in Soltau, Lower Saxony, Germany. With an overall area of over 850,000 m2 (210 acres), it is the largest amusement park in Northern Germany and among the largest in the country. It is part of the British-based Merlin Entertainments, which operates 123 attractions in 24 countries.

==History==
The site originally belonged to the Heidenhof Wildlife Park, which was named after the chapel that was built there in 1350. After the zoo was closed in 1972 following a devastating storm, the showman Hans-Jürgen Tiemann bought the land and opened a small amusement park in 1978 (with the contractual requirement to maintain Heidenhof Chapel as well as the keeping of native animals). When Heide Park opened on 19 August 1978 it offered only six rides: the &quot;Monzapiste&quot;, the &quot;Heide Park Express&quot;, the &quot;Oldtimerrundkurs&quot;, the &quot;Floßfahrt&quot; (tow boat ride), the &quot;Wichtelhausenbahn&quot; and the &quot;Hochbahn&quot;. In its first season, the Heide Park had just under 200,000 visitors. 1979 saw the first dolphin show, for which they built a large domed roof a year later (after the 2008 season, the dolphinarium was closed due to protests).

The &quot;Heide-Dorf&quot; (Heath Village), a richly detailed replica of typical buildings from the Lüneburg Heath, was inaugurated in the 1988 season. In 1996/&#x27;97, the Dutch section of the park was built, with a windmill and canal at the other end of the park.

With the growth of the park, the catchment area grew as well. In the 1990s, up to two million people visited Heide-Park each season, with 2,100,000 guests in 2001. The following year the UK-based Tussauds Group bought the park and since then attendance to the park has decreased to 1.5–1.6 million visitors per annum. Hans-Jürgen Tiemann still has influence in the park by shares and as an advisory director of the Tussauds Group. In early 2007 the Merlin Entertainments Group bought the majority of the shares of Tussauds Group from Dubai International Capital, which had taken over the shares in 2005.

The most recognizable landmark in the park is a 1/3 scale replica of the Statue of Liberty (35 meters tall), it was inaugurated on 4 July 1986 on the 100th anniversary of the original statue. At the end of 2011 the whole structure was relocated to stand within the roller coaster &quot;Colossos&quot;. The park&#x27;s mascot is a bear called Wumbo.

In the 1990s, Hans-Jurgen Tiemann was successful as a driver and sponsor on the touring-car racing circuit, while his son Marcel Tiemann began a career as a professional race car driver.

The Park&#x27;s owner, The Tussauds Group, was sold in May 2007 to the Blackstone Group. The Tussauds Group as a separate entity ceased to exist, and was merged into the Blackstone-owned Merlin Entertainments, which has since operated the Park.

==Music and events==
The music played at Heide Park is a combination of commercial tracks, library music and commissioned music. The following composers have had their music played at the park: Graham Smart, Ian Habgood, David Buckley, Crispin Merrell, IMAscore and John Sanderson.

Halloween in October is a special event.

<doc id="887708" wikidata="Q1809409" url="?curid=887708" title="No independence before majority rule">
<text>No independence before majority rule (abbreviated NIBMAR) was a policy adopted by the British government requiring the implementation of majority rule in a colony, rather than rule by the white colonial minority, before the empire granted independence to its colonies. It was sometimes reinterpreted by some commentators as no independence before majority African rule though this addition was not government policy.

== Rhodesia ==
In particular, the NIBMAR position was advocated with respect to the future status of Rhodesia as an independent state. British prime minister Harold Wilson was pressured into adopting the approach during a conference in London. Wilson was not initially inclined to do so, fearing it would slow the rate at which Rhodesia could be granted independence, but Lester Pearson, the Prime Minister of Canada, formulated a draft resolution committing Wilson to NIBMAR. Wilson defended the policy when it was attacked as disastrous by opposition Conservatives.
The accomplishment was short-lived, however, as Wilson continued to extend offers to Ian Smith, the Rhodesian Prime Minister, which Smith ultimately rejected. The UK policy of NIBMAR led Smith&#x27;s government to declare Rhodesia&#x27;s independence without British consent.

<doc id="887710" wikidata="Q1275894" url="?curid=887710" title="Eromenos">
<text>In ancient Greece, an eromenos was the younger and passive (or &#x27;receptive&#x27;) partner in a male homosexual relationship. The partner of an &quot;eromenos&quot; was the &quot;erastes&quot;, the older and active partner. The &quot;eromenos&quot; was often depicted as beautiful, beardless and more youthful-looking than the &quot;erastes&quot;.

== Terminology ==
&quot;Erômenos&quot; (ἐρώμενος) means &#x27;one who is sexually desired&#x27; in Greek language and is the past participle of the verb &quot;eramai&quot;, to have sexual desire. In &quot;Greek Homosexuality&quot;, the first modern scholarly work on this topic, Kenneth Dover used the literal translation of the Greek word as an English word to refer to the passive partner in Greek homosexual relationship. Though in many contexts the younger man is also called &quot;pais&quot;, &#x27;boy&#x27;, the word can also be used for child, girl, son, daughter and slave, and therefore &quot;eromenos&quot; would be more specific and can &quot;avoid the cumbrousness and…imprecision of &#x27;boy&#x27;&quot;. It is in contrast to the masculine active participle erάn (&#x27;be in love with...&#x27;, &#x27;have a passionate desire for&#x27;). The word &quot;erastes&quot; (lover), however, can be adapted to a married man&#x27;s role in both heterosexual and homosexual relationship.

== Characteristics ==
In vase paintings and other artworks, the &quot;eromenos&quot; is often depicted as a beautiful young adult. His relatively small stature suggests his passive role in the relationship and younger age as well as social status. Usually, they show a combination of a youthful-looking face with a body which possesses mature musculature. The lack of beard and pubic hair are an important clue in identifying an &quot;eromenos&quot;, though this may possibly be attributed to style. A poem quoted in &quot;Greek Sexuality&quot; (couplet 1327f) shows that ‘the poet will never cease to ‘fawn on’ the boy so long as the boy&#x27;s cheek is hairless.

Therefore, it may be concluded that &quot;eromenos&quot; is not a fixed term, as it is only a stage in the development of young Greek men. After they grow up, their relationship with the &quot;erastes&quot; could end and they could get married or start another relationship. This experience, similar to some forms of socially-constructed bisexuality, is also shown in books, such as how Bion the Borysthenite condemns Alcibiades, &quot;that in his adolescence he drew away the husbands from their wives, and as a young man the wives from their husbands.&quot; According to Garrison, for Cretan boys, the passage to adulthood is the ‘prewedding’ of sex with a mature man.

== Representation ==
=== Visual art ===

The image of Ganymede in the figure on the right is an idealized portrait of an &quot;eromenos&quot;. The muscles on his body contrasts with the hoop, a child&#x27;s toy which emphasises the shape of his genitals and inner thighs, and he holds the cockerel, which is the love gift from Zeus. There is no moustache or pubic hair.

John Beazley&#x27;s three types of erotic scenes appear in Athenian vase paintings. &quot;Eromenoi&quot; are often touched on chin and genitals by their &quot;erastes&quot; (alpha group), presented with gifts (beta group) or entwined between the thighs of their &quot;erastes&quot; (gamma group). Meanwhile, Eva Cantarella discovered that representations of pederastic relationships contain two successive moments of courtship. The first phase is similar to Beazley&#x27;s alpha group, while in the second phase the &quot;eromenos&quot; stands behind the &quot;erastes&quot; with his penis between his thighs, somehow similar to the gamma group.
This vase (Brygos Painter) depicts a classical scene of an &quot;erastes&quot; courting an &quot;eromenos&quot;. As the &quot;eromenos&quot;’ legs are positioned between the &quot;erastes&quot;’ thighs with the &quot;erastes&quot; touching his penis and his chin, it is similar to the alpha group. The pectoral and belly muscles show that he was well-trained in wrestling schools, and the bag of ‘Kydonian apples’ or quinces is a sign of his sexual awakening.

Dover and Gundel Koch-Harnack have argued that the gift-giving scene to the &quot;eromenos&quot; is in fact a courting scene. Common gifts include a sprig of flowers, a rabbit, and a fighting cock.

=== Poems and literature ===
The love for an &quot;eromenos&quot; is a frequent topic in Ancient Greek poems. Dover studied poems related to pederasty and quoted some verses expressing love to the eromonos, ‘O boy with the virginal eyes, I seek you, but you do not listen, not knowing that you are the charioteer of my soul!’ Also, A surviving fragment of Solon from the early sixth century B.C. writes that ‘Till he loves a lad in the flower of youth, bewitched by thighs and by sweet lips.’ 

The graffiti of Thera verified that anal penetration was normal in pederastic relationships, for in the inscriptions, Krimon used the verb &quot;oiphein&quot; (male sexual act performed as either active or passive partner in Dorian dialect) to describe the intercourse with his &quot;eromenos&quot;, which indicates anal penetration. Also, literature suggested that the charm of the &quot;eromenos&quot; lay in his attractive anal area, which was described by various metaphors such as rosebud, fruits, figs or gold.

It is noteworthy that most of the Greek verses about homosexuality were about how the &quot;erastes&quot; longed for the &quot;eromenos&quot;, but few were written from the perspective of the &quot;eromenos&quot;.

=== Myths ===

The &quot;erastes-eromenos&quot; relationship can be not only between humans but also between humans and gods. The love between Apollo and Hyacinth was said to have been the archetype of pederasty in Sparta. Apollo fell in love with Hyacinth on account of his youthful beauty, and became his instructor in archery, music, hunting and the gymnasium. Hyacinth was killed by the discus thrown by Apollo when studying discus-throwing with him, and in some versions of myths it was Zephyr (the god of the west wind) who also loved Hyacinth, and who disturbed the wind to cause this accident.

Though usually known as the mortal lover of Aphrodite, Adonis was said to be loved by other gods such as Apollo, Heracles and Dionysus, for his youth and beauty.

== Attitudes ==
The Athenians banned slaves from pursuing courtship of freeborn youths with themselves as the active partner, as &quot;Against Timarchus&quot; states that ‘A slave shall not be the lover of a free boy nor follow after him, or else he shall receive fifty blows of the public lash’; but this did not apply to free men. Nevertheless, to be in such a relationship with honour, &quot;eromenoi&quot; were supposed to resist the pursuit of their &quot;erastes&quot; to test their love, before finally yielding. According to Foucault, an &quot;eromenos&quot; should avoid being chased too easily, receiving too many gifts or quickly getting into a relationship before the &quot;erastes&quot; proved their passion, love and responsibility. Moreover, the perception of pederasty varied in different cities. While it was allowed in Elis and Boeotia, Ionians did not accept pederastic courtship. Athenians held a complicated attitude, as it was considered that Athenian fathers ought to protect their sons from suitors.

== Scholarship ==

=== Analysis of power structure ===
Some scholars believe that what the &quot;eromenoi&quot; gained from their &quot;erastes&quot; were not material rewards, but intellectual and moral edification, as well as learning how to achieve ejaculation, as pederasty was regarded as a process of education and sensual pleasure. However, Michel Foucault argued that, according to Plutarch, the &quot;erastes&quot;&#x27; sexual contact was imposed through violence, and the &quot;eromenos&quot; could only feel anger, hatred, the desire for revenge and social shame through having become an object of contempt, which he described as &quot;acharistos&quot;.

=== Comparison with women ===
In heterosexual erotic images in Ancient Greece, the gender roles of male and female are often depicted as the dominant and subordinate positions. Women are depicted bending over, recumbent, or supported by men positioned upright or on top; while &quot;eromenoi&quot; are often depicted as experiencing ‘intercrural sex’ (i.e., between the thighs), with their partners standing face-to-face with them.

To &quot;erastes&quot;, whether the appeal and seduction of the &quot;eromenos&quot; lies in their masculinity or femininity is contested. Dover discovered a line of Athenian Kritias quoted by a Roman writer, ‘In males, the most beautiful appearance is that which is female; but in females, the opposite.’ However, due to the lack of specific context and further supporting evidence, we cannot conclude that female characteristics of &quot;eromenos&quot; are the stimuli of pederasty. He also found that beardless male and female faces share the same contours, except for the eyes. Some scholars like Eva Cantarella and Cohen found that the lengths of time during which one ought to resist one&#x27;s suitors&#x27; advances were similar in both same-sex and different-sex courtships; since the honour lay not in the refusal, but the choice of which was the best time to give in. Also, Garrison argues that the love of boys by men is emblematic of attitudes prevalent among the ruling class, in which love for women is devalued. The love for &quot;eromenoi&quot; can be related to misogyny in Ancient Greece.

Not all homosexual relationships in Ancient Greece are typified as pederasty or as the &quot;erastes-eromenos&quot; relationship. The love between Achilles and Patroclus might be a counterargument to pederasty, for both of them showed their masculinity in this heroic, blood-brother like relationship, and were around the same age, with Patroclus only slightly older than Achilles.

== Later depictions ==
The 20th-century English and South African writer Mary Renault was famous for her romantic novels on pederasty in Ancient Greece. Her novel &quot;The Last of the Wine&quot; (1956) tells the love story of Alexias, a beautiful and noble Athenian youth and Socrates’ student who was chased by a number of older men because of his beauty. Bernard F. Dick commented on her novels that they provided historically accurate representation of Greek homosexuality. Her fan community also created artworks that imitate Greek vase paintings portraying courting scenes between the &quot;erastes&quot; and &quot;eromenos&quot;.

<text>Colin John Clarke (born 30 October 1962) is a Northern Irish retired footballer who played as a forward, and a former head coach.

He played for seven English clubs between 1981 and 1993 before retiring through a knee injury, and scored 13 goals in 38 matches for the Northern Ireland national football team from 1986 to 1993. A member of their squad at the 1986 FIFA World Cup, he was joint with Billy Gillespie as Northern Ireland&#x27;s top scorer of all before their record was surpassed by David Healy.

After retiring as a player, Clarke went into management in the United States, coaching teams including Major League Soccer franchise FC Dallas and the Puerto Rico national football team.

==Playing career==
Born in Newry, Clarke began his professional career in the Football League Fourth Division at Peterborough United in the 1981–82 season, scoring 18 goals in 84 games over the next three seasons (having a loan spell at Gillingham during his final season at London Road) before he signed for their Fourth Division rivals Tranmere Rovers. 

Along with fellow striker John Clayton, he formed one of the deadliest strike-forces in the Football League by scoring 22 goals that season, but the 1984–85 campaign ended in disappointment as Tranmere just missed out on promotion. He was then transferred to Third Division club AFC Bournemouth and scored 26 goals, though again his goals were not enough to win his club promotion.

In the summer of 1986, Clarke made the big move of his career in a transfer to First Division club Southampton for £500,000, and he was an instant success in his first campaign as a top division striker with 20 league goals, including two hat-tricks in the first few weeks of the season. The Saints reached the semi-finals of the Football League Cup that season. He enjoyed another successful campaign a year later by scoring 16 goals, but a sudden loss of form in 1988–89 restricted him to nine First Division games (in which he failed to score).

He was loaned back to Bournemouth (by then in the Second Division) during that campaign and scored twice in four games before a permanent exit from The Dell in March 1989, saw him resume his First Division career with Queens Park Rangers (QPR). He scored five goals in 12 games as QPR finished ninth, but his goalscoring rate slowed in 1989–90 as he managed just six goals in 34 games in a season where QPR finished lower and underwent a mid season managerial change when Trevor Francis was succeeded by Don Howe.

He was transferred to Portsmouth in June 1990, where he remained until the end of his playing career three years later. During his time at Fratton Park he was in the side that reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1992, only being eliminated by Liverpool after a replay and penalties, and narrowly missed out on promotion to the Premier League a year later. He retired at the end of the 1992–93 season due to a knee injury.

===International career===
Like many players from Northern Ireland Colin Clarke&#x27;s greatest playing days came in a Northern Ireland shirt, for whom he scored 13 goals (second behind David Healy) in 38 appearances. Clarke joined the National Team set up just as arguably the greatest Northern Ireland team of all time was breaking up. He made his international debut in a pre-Mexico World Cup warm-up match against France in February 1986 and scored his first Northern Ireland goal against Morocco on his third appearance. In Mexico he appeared in all of Northern Ireland&#x27;s matches, scoring a consolation against Spain, but the team were unable to match the heights they had reached at the 1982 World Cup.

After returning from the Mexico World Cup, many of Northern Ireland&#x27;s star players retired or were at least in the veteran stage. Team manager Billy Bingham set about building a new team with Clarke as the spearhead. Although this new team failed to reach the heights of Bingham&#x27;s first, Clarke did have some notable highlights. In September 1991, against the Faroe Islands he became the first Northern Ireland player to score a hat-trick in international football since George Best in 1971. He scored his then record-breaking thirteenth Northern Ireland goal against Albania in September 1992 and played his final international match two months later against Denmark.

==Coaching and management career==
Clarke was appointed interim coach during the latter half of the 2003 MLS season as a replacement for Mike Jeffries, and was appointed full-time to the position for the 2004 season. Clarke went on to manage both the 2005 and 2006 seasons with great regular season form indeed FC Dallas won the Western Conference comfortably in 2006, but was eliminated in the play-offs in both years latterly after a penalty shoot out. This led to his sacking on 7 November 2006. Before being appointed head coach, Clarke was an assistant coach for the Burn. He spent two seasons as head coach of the Richmond Kickers of the United States&#x27; A-League. During that time, he compiled a 38–18 record. On 13 December 1999, he was named head coach of the San Diego Flash, a position he held for one season. Clarke was appointed head coach at Virginia Beach Mariners in January 2007. Within two months of his arrival, the club folded and Clarke was again without a job.

===Puerto Rico Islanders===
On 22 May 2007, Puerto Rico Islanders appointed Clarke to replace Toribio Rojas as head coach midway through the team&#x27;s worst season since their creation. During the last half of the 2007 season he turned the squad&#x27;s fortunes around and managed to cling to the sixth spot in the table, guaranteeing a playoff berth. The squad would make it all the way to the semi-finals where they lost to Seattle Sounders on penalty kicks. Late in 2007 he also took the Islanders to the CFU Club Championship semi-finals, the Caribbean qualifiers for the 2008 CONCACAF Champions Cup, where they lost 1–0 to Joe Public F.C. of Trinidad and Tobago.

Despite a bad start to the 2008 season, Clarke managed to lead the team into the CONCACAF Champions League by winning a two-game series on 1:0 aggregate against fellow 2007 CFU Club Championship semi-finalist San Juan Jabloteh for the tournament&#x27;s Caribbean third place spot. After several bad results at the start of the season, Clarke managed to push the Islanders into an undefeated run that would lead the team its first league trophy, Commissioner&#x27;s Cup, after they ended the regular season in first place. The team would make it all the way to the finals, but lost to second seed Vancouver Whitecaps 2:1.

===Puerto Rico national team===
In January 2008, Clarke was chosen to lead the Puerto Rico national team. After two wins against Bermuda and a draw versus Trinidad and Tobago was popular with many Puerto Rican football fans. On 4 June, he led the national team to a disappointing 4–0 defeat against Honduras. However, on 14 June, Puerto Rico played against Honduras in the second leg earning a 2–2 draw in Puerto Rico.

In Puerto Rico he was known as &quot;El General&quot; (&quot;The General&quot;).

===North Carolina FC===
On 6 December 2011, the Carolina RailHawks of the North American Soccer League, now known as North Carolina FC and playing in the United Soccer League, announced that Clarke would replace Martin Rennie as the team&#x27;s head coach.

After amassing a 91–84–58 record over seven seasons, North Carolina FC announced on 17 October 2018 that it would part ways with Clarke.

<text>The United African National Council (UANC) is a political party in Zimbabwe. It was briefly the ruling party during 1979–1980, when its leader Abel Muzorewa was prime minister.

==History==
The party was founded by Muzorewa in 1971. Running as African National Council independents, it won six of the eight African seats in the House of Assembly in the 1974 general elections. The party was renamed the United African National Council in 1977, but did not contest the 1977 general elections.

Following the Internal Settlement of 1978, the party won the 1979 elections, winning 51 of the 100 seats, resulting in Muzorewa becoming prime minister. However, the new government failed to win international recognition due to its exclusion of the African nationalist ZAPU and ZANU in negotiations and following the Lancaster House Agreement, early elections were held in April 1980. The UANC won only three seats as ZANU–PF took power.

After failing to win a seat in the 1985 and 1990 elections, the party joined with other opposition parties to form United Parties to support Muzorewa in the 1996 presidential election, but he subsequently pulled out (albeit with his name remaining on the ballot). United Parties also unsuccessfully contested the 2000 parliamentary elections.

The party contested the 2018 general elections but received just 1,889 votes.

<text>Richard William Butler, (born 13 May 1942) is a retired Australian public servant, United Nations weapons inspector, and a former Governor of Tasmania.

==Early life and career==
Butler was born in Coolah in rural New South Wales. He grew up in Sydney and was educated at Randwick Boys High School, the University of Sydney and the Australian National University, Canberra. He married Susan Ryan in 1963 and they had a son and a daughter; they divorced in 1972.

Butler joined the Australian Department of External Affairs in 1965, and served in a number of postings until 1975, when he resigned to become Principal Private Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Gough Whitlam, who had recently been dismissed as prime minister.

In 1983 the next Australian Labor Party Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, appointed him as Australia&#x27;s Permanent Representative on Disarmament to the United Nations in Geneva. He was next appointed Australian Ambassador to Thailand, and played a major part in the Cambodian peace settlement, working closely with then Foreign Minister Gareth Evans. He was Australian Ambassador to the United Nations from 1992 to 1997. His term was ended by the new Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, after Butler&#x27;s intensive lobbying had failed to win Australia a seat on the Security Council in 1996. In a 2000 memoir &quot;The Greatest Threat&quot;, Butler acknowledged that his &quot;high-energy, high-visibility activities ... had served as a distraction and clearly alienated some nations whose votes we might otherwise have won&quot;.

Butler is currently a Global Diplomat in Residence and Clinical Professor at the Center for Global Affairs at the New York University School of Continuing and Professional Studies; and is also a professor at the School of International Affairs at Penn State University in State College.

==Butler at UNSCOM==

In 1997 Butler was appointed Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), the UN weapons inspection organisation in Iraq, in succession to Rolf Ekéus. In this role he antagonised both the Iraqi regime and the United States, and was frequently described as arrogant and aggressive. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan rebuked him for using &quot;undiplomatic&quot; language about then Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein.

While at UNSCOM Butler frequently argued that Saddam had undisclosed weapons of mass destruction. In a 1999 speech he said:
He also accused Iraq of actively concealing its weapons and obstructing UNSCOM&#x27;s work:
In a 1999 interview he said:
In 1998 Iraq accused Butler and other UNSCOM officials of acting as spies for the United States, but the UNSCOM weapons inspectors were not expelled from the country by Iraq as has often been reported (and as George W. Bush alleged in his infamous &quot;axis of evil&quot; speech). Rather, according to Butler himself in his book &quot;Saddam Defiant&quot; (2000), it was U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh, acting on instructions from Washington, who suggested Butler pull his team from Iraq in order to protect them from the forthcoming U.S. and British airstrikes. A number of media reports in the United States suggested that there was some substance to the spying allegations and to the charge that he was tailoring UNSCOM&#x27;s findings to suit the United States. Eric Fournier, a French diplomat who served as Butler&#x27;s deputy at UNSCOM in 1998, told an Australian journalist, Christopher Kremmer, that the US bombing of Iraq in 1998—which made the UNSCOM mission untenable—occurred &quot;because Richard Butler reported that the Iraqis had not cooperated with inspections, even though more than three hundred had taken place in a few weeks and only a handful had been a problem. Three out of three hundred did not go perfectly smoothly...the report, drafted like that, was a good excuse for some members of the Security Council to take action&quot;. Fournier also told Kremmer that Butler at one point sounded positive about closing the disarmament issue. But then he received a call from the state department who weren&#x27;t happy with a positive outcome in Iraq.

Both &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, citing anonymous sources, said that Butler had known of and co-operated with a US electronic eavesdropping operation that allowed intelligence agents to monitor military communications in Iraq. This was confirmed by UNSCOM insider Rod Barton on Australian television in February 2005. This intelligence was used to target US air attacks on Iraq.

Butler admitted that foreign intelligence agencies were being used to locate Iraqi WMD but denied allegations that he colluded with the U.S. to access Saddam Hussein&#x27;s private channel via &quot;piggybacking&quot; UNSCOM. He also stated that foreign intelligence activities decreased during 1998. He was publicly supported by Kofi Annan, but Annan was reported to be privately seeking Butler&#x27;s resignation, which occurred a few months later. After leaving UNSCOM in 1999 Butler was a Diplomat-in-Residence at the Council of Foreign Relations.

During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Butler, despite his earlier criticism of Saddam Hussein, opposed the US-led invasion and Australian participation in it. In July 2003 he called for the resignations of Prime Minister John Howard and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, who he said had misled the Australian people over the war.

==Governor of Tasmania==
===Appointment===
In August 2003 the Labor Premier of Tasmania, Jim Bacon, announced the appointment of Butler as Governor of Tasmania. He was sworn in on 3 October. His appointment was criticised on the grounds that he was not Tasmanian by either birth or association, that he was too closely identified with the Labor Party, and that he was a republican, and thus not a suitable person to represent the Queen of Australia, Elizabeth II, in Tasmania.

The Melbourne daily &quot;The Age&quot; wrote:
Butler sought to ease such fears by saying: &quot;I will give no gratuitous offence to any monarchist. It would be pointless and offensive to do so. The day will come when the next part of the Australian story will be told, but in the meantime we get on with our story today and the process of building and making Tasmania grow.&quot;

He added: &quot;I hope my international knowledge, my contacts, my experience in the global environment will enable me to make a contribution to the growing international awareness of Tasmania.&quot;

He married Jennifer Grey, his third wife, the day after he was sworn in as governor and commenced his term by leaving for a three-week overseas honeymoon.

===Controversy===
Criticisms of various kinds continued thereafter. When Butler broke with established vice-regal convention against public comment on domestic and international affairs, Premier Paul Lennon (who had replaced Jim Bacon in February 2004), specifically requested him to refrain from doing so.

In August 2004, the Tasmanian Liberal Opposition Leader, Rene Hidding, withdrew his support for Butler, and a federal Labor Member of Parliament, Harry Quick, also criticised him. In the same week, three long-serving staff members at Government House resigned amid claims of difficulties in working with Butler and his wife.

These departures occurred while Butler was once again on leave, this time for two weeks, during which time he made three public appearances in performances of Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Lincoln Portrait&quot; (a work for speaker and orchestra) with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Reporters tried to speak to Butler while on his way to rehearsals of this work, but were told to leave him and his wife alone as they were &quot;on holiday&quot;. He was nevertheless billed for the performance as &quot;The Hon Richard Butler, Governor of Tasmania&quot;.

When asked for his view of the growing public controversy about Butler&#x27;s performance and behaviour as governor, Prime Minister John Howard said he would not comment on a matter reserved for state authorities, but he nevertheless made the point, repeatedly, that &quot;this was not my appointment&quot;.

===Resignation===
On 9 August 2004, after a three-hour meeting with Lennon, Butler announced his resignation, citing a desire to end a &quot;malicious campaign&quot; against him and his wife. Lennon said Butler had dealt with the situation &quot;with honour&quot; and that the decision to resign was &quot;courageous and statesman-like&quot;.

Butler&#x27;s supporters held he had been hounded from office by monarchists and the Murdoch press; the Murdoch-owned Hobart newspaper &quot;The Mercury&quot; having run a series of articles critical of Butler&#x27;s performance in the lead-up to his resignation. These aired such matters as his lengthy honeymoon, his alleged inability to get on with staff, and his allegedly arrogant and patronising manner.

On 5 August &quot;The Mercury&quot; carried an article reporting the University of Tasmania political scientist Richard Herr as saying that &quot;recent goings-on at Government House appeared inconsistent with legislation attached to the office of Governor.&quot; Some of the matters raised included an alleged breach of protocol with the welcome of the Botswanan High Commissioner and a luncheon given for him, at which Jennifer Butler officiated. The point was made that the spouse of a governor has no status in their own right during the governor&#x27;s absence, and that this function should have been hosted by the Lieutenant-Governor, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Tasmania, the Hon William Cox.

Upon Butler&#x27;s resignation, William Cox was appointed acting governor. He was appointed Governor of Tasmania later that year.

The day after Butler&#x27;s resignation, Lennon said that he had offered Butler an &quot;ex gratia&quot; payment of A$650,000 in compensation for the loss of four years&#x27; expected income from the remainder of his five-year term. This payment, which was not constitutionally required, was widely criticised in the press and by the Tasmanian Opposition. Both the Prime Minister, John Howard and the federal Opposition Leader, Mark Latham, were critical of the payment, which Latham described as &quot;sickening.&quot;

The Butler fallout resurfaced briefly in September 2005 following the release of Latham&#x27;s diaries. Latham had earlier resigned as Federal ALP leader in January of that year amid acrimonious circumstances with his ALP colleagues. His diaries claimed that Lennon had discussed with him Butler&#x27;s payout despite being publicly critical about it. Latham also wrote that Butler as Tasmania&#x27;s governor was drunk at the 2004 Danish royal wedding and it cost him his job.

Opposition Leader Rene Hidding questioned Lennon in Parliament about Latham&#x27;s claims on the payout. Lennon dismissed what Latham wrote in his diaries saying that they are &quot;a tirade of invective and abuse levelled at everybody and anybody who had anything to do with Mark Latham. The man has no credibility. Anything he says or writes has no credibility.&quot;

==Honours==
Butler was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 1988 Australia Day Honours, &quot;In recognition of service to international peace and disarmament&quot;.

On 5 September 2003, while Governor-designate of Tasmania, Butler was promoted to Companion of the Order of Australia (AC).

<text>Motzstraße, or Motzstrasse (see ß), is a street in the Berlin borough of Tempelhof-Schöneberg. It runs from Nollendorfplatz via Viktoria-Luise-Platz in Schöneberg to Prager Platz in Wilmersdorf. 

The section of Motzstraße between Nollendorfplatz and Martin-Luther-Straße is the centre of one of Berlin&#x27;s gay areas. Berlin&#x27;s Lesbian and Gay City Festival Motzstraßenfest is held there every July, on the weekend before the Gay Pride celebrations (CSD) in Berlin.

== History ==

Named after , a Prussian Finance Minister, the first, northerly section was laid out around 1870. That section, to the north of Nollendorfplatz has been renamed twice, in 1934 to Mackensenstraße, at which time the street numbering was changed and again in 1996 to Else Lasker-Schüler Straße. Motzstraße 6 was the location of the American Church from 1903 until 1944, when it was destroyed in an Allied air raid, along with many other buildings in the area. &quot;motzbuch&quot; was located at Motzstraße 32 from 1981 and attracted many authors for readings, including Reinhard Jirgl. The business closed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual street festival was cancelled in 2020 and 2021.

== Surroundings ==

The area around Motzstraße has been recognised as a gay-friendly neighbourhood since the 1900s. Related establishments include Piscator&#x27;s Theatre (later Metropol Theatre) and then Metropol cinema), Metropol discothek, Goya club (now known as Metropol), and the Eldorado (1926–1932).

British-American author Christopher Isherwood lived around the corner from Motzstraße on Nollendorfstraße, where he was inspired by the area&#x27;s diversity to write several of his best-selling novels.

The section of Motzstraße around Viktoria-Luise-Platz, restored after wartime damage, is an upscale neighbourhood filled with Wilhelmine architecture. Many notable personalities and famous figures have made their homes in the area, such as Rudolf Steiner and Else Lasker-Schüler.

<text>Chief Jeremiah Sikireta Chirau, ICD (6 June 1923 – 27 January 1985) was a notable figure among Rhodesia&#x27;s chiefs, and during the UDI he became the only leader of the Zimbabwe United People&#x27;s Organisation (ZUPO), a party largely comprising chiefs.

Born near Makonde, he was awarded a medal for service in World War II. A staunch traditionalist, he was well versed in African customary law. In 1961 he was appointed acting chief, and eventually rose to chiefship of the communal lands of the Chirau people. Elected to the Council of Chiefs, he
became its president in 1973, a position he held until his death. He entered politics in 1970 when he was elected into the Senate. He formed ZUPO in 1976 and was a signatory to the Internal Settlement. ZUPO contested the resulting elections but failed to win any seats and was subsequently disbanded.

<doc id="887751" wikidata="Q2919132" url="?curid=887751" title="Red Rose of Lancaster">
<text>The Red Rose of Lancaster (blazoned: &quot;a rose gules&quot;) was the heraldic badge adopted by the royal House of Lancaster in the 14th century. In the modern era, it symbolises the county of Lancashire. The exact species or cultivar which it represents is thought to be &quot;Rosa gallica officinalis&quot;.

John of Gaunt&#x27;s younger brother Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York (1341–1402), adopted the White rose of York as his heraldic badge. His descendants fought for control of the throne of England during several decades of civil warfare, which became known as the Wars of the Roses, after the heraldry of the House of York 

Adopted after the civil wars of the fifteenth century had ended, the red rose was the symbol of the English Monarchy.

The opposition of the roses was a romantic invention created after the fact, and the Tudor arts under poets like Shakespeare gave the wars their popular conception: The Wars of the Roses, coined in the 19th century. The conflict was ended by King Henry VII of England who, upon marrying Elizabeth of York, created the Tudor rose, the symbol of the Tudor dynasty.

==Flower==

Lancaster&#x27;s Red Rose (also known as Apothecary&#x27;s Rose, Old Red Damask and Rose of Provins) is an official variety and is possibly the first cultivated rose. The rose grew wild throughout Central Asia and was discovered by the ancient Persians and Egyptians. Later adopted by the Romans, who introduced it to Gaul (France) where it assumed the name &quot;Rosa gallica&quot;. It is documented that Charlemagne&#x27;s court exploited the rose as a perfume. The rose was also appreciated for its medical value and was utilized in countless medical remedies.

==Medieval symbol==
The Red Rose of Lancaster derives from the gold rose badge of Edward I of England. Other members of his family used variants of the royal badge, with the king&#x27;s brother, the Earl of Lancaster, using a red rose. It is incorrectly believed that the Red Rose of Lancaster was the House of Lancaster&#x27;s badge during the Wars of the Roses. Evidence for this &quot;wearing of the rose&quot; includes scant evidence. there are, however, doubts as to whether the red rose was actually an emblem taken up by the Lancastrians during the Wars of the Roses. Adrian Ailes has noted that the red rose “probably owes its popular usage to Henry VII quickly responding to the pre-existing Yorkist white rose in an age when signs and symbols could speak louder than words.&quot; 
It also allowed Henry to invent and exploit his most famous heraldic device, the Tudor Rose, combining the so-called Lancastrian red rose and the White Rose of York. This floral union neatly symbolised the restoration of peace and harmony and his marriage in January 1486 to Elizabeth of York. It was a brilliant piece of simple heraldic propaganda.” The Tudor Rose is used as the plant badge of England (Scotland uses the thistle, Ireland uses the shamrock, and Wales uses the leek).

==Later use==

The rose does not form any part of the insignia of the Duchy of Lancaster, but came to be seen as an emblem of the county of Lancashire, and as such was incorporated in the coats of arms of numerous Lancashire local authorities including the county council. Since 1974 a number of metropolitan boroughs in Greater Manchester and Merseyside have included red roses in their armorial bearings to show their formation from parts of Lancashire. It is also present in the crest of the coat of arms of the London Borough of Enfield.

The traditional Lancashire flag, a red rose on a white field, was never officially registered with the Flag Institute and when this was attempted it was found that this flag had been registered by the town of Montrose, Scotland. As two flags of the same design can not be registered, Lancashire&#x27;s official flag is now registered as a red rose on a yellow field.

Today the Red Rose is still widely used, and not necessarily on a yellow background. Lancashire County Cricket Club still use the rose as an emblem. The Trafford Centre also features Red Roses in its architecture, most noticeably on all of the glass panes in the shopping centre. Lancashire GAA features a red rose on its emblem. Manchester City Football Club featured the red rose on the club badge from 1972 to 1997 and reinstated it in 2015, reflecting Manchester&#x27;s history as part of Lancashire. It also features on the badges of Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, and Barrow.
Edge Hill University in Ormskirk uses the Red Rose on a yellow background on its crest along with a Liver bird which signifies its current location (Lancashire) and origins in Liverpool.

The shield of Lancashire County Council&#x27;s coat of arms, however, displays not one but three red roses, on gold piles on a red background. The arms have been official since 1903.

==Military use==
From the nineteenth century the red rose was part of the badge of a number of units of the British Army recruiting in the county. During the First World War, the rose was worn by 55th (West Lancashire) Division; their motto was &quot;They win or die, who wear the Rose of Lancaster&quot;. When the division was reformed in 1920, it maintained the rose as its insignia. The cap badge of the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment, formed in 2006, features the rose.

The Saskatoon Light Infantry of the Canadian Army also incorporated the red rose into the design of their cap badge and regimental buttons, due to an alliance with the York and Lancaster Regiment of the British Army.

==International use==

The Canadian city of Montreal has a Lancastrian rose in the top right hand corner of its flag, representing the city&#x27;s historical English community. 

The U.S. City of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, known as &quot;Red Rose City&quot;, uses the Lancastrian rose as its seal, and in its flag.

<doc id="887753" wikidata="Q6132565" url="?curid=887753" title="Roger Peckinpaugh">
<text>Roger Thorpe Peckinpaugh (February 5, 1891 – November 17, 1977) was an American professional baseball player shortstop and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1910 through 1927, during which he played for the Cleveland Naps, New York Yankees, Washington Senators and Chicago White Sox.

Nap Lajoie discovered Peckinpaugh as a high school student, and signed him to his first professional contract. Peckinpaugh debuted with the Naps, who traded him to the Yankees in 1913. He managed the Yankees for 20 games in 1914 and was the team captain for the remainder of his time with the club. The Senators acquired Peckinpaugh, where he continued to play until his final season, spent with the White Sox. After his playing career, Peckinpaugh managed the Indians from 1928 through 1933 and in 1941. He was also a minor league baseball manager, and served in the front office of the Indians and Buffalo Bisons from 1942 through 1947.

Peckinpaugh was considered an excellent defensive shortstop and strong leader. When he managed the Yankees, he became the youngest manager in MLB history. He was named American League Most Valuable Player in 1925. He played in the World Series three times: winning the 1924 World Series with the Senators, losing the 1921 World Series with the Yankees, and losing the 1925 World Series with the Senators.

==Early life and amateur career==
Peckinpaugh was born in Wooster, Ohio, the third child of 
Frank and Cora Peckinpaugh. His father played semi-professional baseball.

At a young age, the Peckinpaughs moved from Wooster to Cleveland. He attended East High School, where he played American football, basketball, and baseball. There, Nap Lajoie of the Cleveland Naps, who lived in the same neighborhood, discovered Peckinpaugh. Lajoie signed Peckinpaugh to a contract with a salary of $125 per month ($ in current dollar terms) when he graduated from high school in 1910.

==Playing career==

===Cleveland Naps and New York Yankees (1910–1921)===
The Naps started Peckinpaugh&#x27;s professional career by assigning him to the New Haven Prairie Hens of the Class-B Connecticut League. He was promoted to the Naps to make his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut in September 1910, playing in 15 games for the Naps at age 19. The Naps assigned Peckinpaugh to the Portland Beavers of the Class-A Pacific Coast League for the entire 1911 season. He appeared in 70 games for the Naps in 1912, batting only .212. On May 25, 1913, after giving the starting shortstop position to Ray Chapman, the Naps traded Peckinpaugh to the New York Yankees for Jack Lelivelt and Bill Stumpf.
The Naps soon regretted the trade. With the Yankees, Peckinpaugh emerged as a team leader. He was named captain in 1914 by manager Frank Chance. Chance resigned with three weeks remaining in the season, and Peckinpaugh served as player–manager for the remainder of the season; at the age of 23, he became the youngest manager in MLB history. He finished the 1914 season fifth in the AL with 38 stolen bases.
Bill Donovan was hired as the Yankees manager in the offseason. In the 1914–15 offseason, Peckinpaugh considered leaving the Yankees to join the Federal League, as he received offers from the Chicago Federals, Buffalo Blues, and Indianapolis Hoosiers. After considering the offer from Chicago, he chose to stay with the Yankees, and received a three-year contract worth $6,000 ($ in current dollar terms) per season from 1915 through 1917. He resigned with the Yankees in 1918. Peckinpaugh tied Buck Weaver for fourth in runs scored (89) and several players for eighth in home runs (7) in the 1919 season.

By the 1921 season, Peckinpaugh was one of three players, along with Wally Pipp and Bob Shawkey, remaining with the Yankees from the time Jacob Ruppert and Tillinghast L&#x27;Hommedieu Huston purchased the team in 1915. The Yankees reached the World Series in 1921, losing to the New York Giants. Peckinpaugh set an MLB record for most assists in one game by a shortstop with nine.

===Washington Senators and Chicago White Sox (1922–1926)===
Peckinpaugh was traded twice during the 1921–22 offseason. On December 20, 1921, the Yankees traded Peckinpaugh with Rip Collins, Bill Piercy, Jack Quinn and $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms) to the Boston Red Sox for Bullet Joe Bush, Sad Sam Jones and Everett Scott. On January 10, 1922, Pecknipaugh was involved in a three-team trade involving the Red Sox, Washington Senators and Philadelphia Athletics, where Peckinpaugh joined the Senators, Joe Dugan and Frank O&#x27;Rourke went to the Red Sox, and the Athletics acquired Bing Miller, José Acosta, and $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Though team owner Clark Griffith had indicated that Peckinpaugh would serve as his player-manager at the time of the trade, he named Clyde Milan player-manager for the 1922 season instead. This distracted Peckinpaugh, and along with injuries, limited his performance.

Chance, now managing the Boston Red Sox, attempted to acquire Peckinpaugh from the Senators before the 1923 season. Remaining in Washington, Peckinpaugh rebounded during the 1923 season with timely hitting and solid fielding.
Griffith appointed Bucky Harris as manager before the 1924 season. Harris considered Peckinpaugh his &quot;assistant manager&quot;. Peckinpaugh was a key contributor in the 1924 World Series, in which the Senators defeated the Giants. He won the League Award as the AL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player in 1925, edging Al Simmons by a small margin. In the 1925 World Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Peckinpaugh committed eight errors in the seven-game series, an MLB record.

On January 15, 1927, the Senators traded Peckinpaugh to the Chicago White Sox for Leo Mangum and Sloppy Thurston. However, his playing time with the White Sox was limited by a leg injury. He acted as an advisor to manager Ray Schalk. After one season with the White Sox, Peckinpaugh retired as a player.

==Managerial and executive career==
Peckinpaugh was named manager of the Cleveland Indians after the 1927 season. After the Indians fell from first to fifth place during the 1933 season, the Indians fired Peckinpaugh, replacing him with Walter Johnson.

After being considered for the Detroit Tigers&#x27; managerial vacancy that offseason, Peckinpaugh took over as manager of the Kansas City Blues of the Class-AA American Association for the 1934 season. Out of professional baseball in 1935, Peckinpaugh joined Lew Fonseca on nationwide baseball tours, which involved the viewing of a movie and technical demonstrations. He applied to be manager of the Boston Bees for the 1938 season, but the job was given to Casey Stengel. Peckinpaugh returned to professional baseball as the manager of the New Orleans Pelicans of the Class-A1 Southern Association in 1939.

The Indians rehired Peckinpaugh as their manager in 1941, signing him to a two-year contract; team president Alva Bradley, who fired Peckinpaugh in 1933, promised Peckinpaugh full cooperation and minimal interference. After the 1941 season, he was promoted to vice president, later serving as Cleveland&#x27;s general manager and president. When Bill Veeck bought the Indians in July 1946, he brought Harry Grabiner and Joseph C. Hostetler with him to serve in the front office. Peckinpaugh and Bradley resigned.

Peckinpaugh succeeded Harris as general manager for the Buffalo Bisons of the International League in the 1946–47 offseason. He was fired after the 1947 season, as the team&#x27;s directors felt Peckinpaugh failed to sufficiently develop a farm system.

===Managerial record===
==Personal==
Peckinpaugh was considered a calm baseball player and manager, who did not let his temper get the best of him.

After the end of his baseball career, Peckinpaugh worked as a manufacturer&#x27;s representative for the Cleveland Oak Belting Company. He retired in 1976 at the age of 85. Suffering from cancer and heart disease, he was brought to a hospital for a respiratory condition, and died on November 17, 1977, in Cleveland. He was buried in Acacia Masonic Memorial Park in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. His wife, Mildred, died five years earlier. Together, they had four sons. Peckinpaugh was survived by two of his sons.

<doc id="887757" wikidata="Q5604432" url="?curid=887757" title="Greensand">
<text>Greensand or green sand is a sand or sandstone which has a greenish color. This term is specifically applied to shallow marine sediment that contains noticeable quantities of rounded greenish grains. These grains are called &quot;glauconies&quot; and consist of a mixture of mixed-layer clay minerals, such as smectite and glauconite. Greensand is also loosely applied to any glauconitic sediment.

==Formation==
Greensand forms in anoxic marine environments that are rich in organic detritus and low in sedimentary input. Having accumulated in marine environments, greensands can be fossil-rich, such as in the late-Cretaceous deposits of New Jersey.

==Occurrence==
Important exposures are known from both northern and western Europe, North America, southeastern Brazil and north Africa. Well known and important greensands are the Upper and Lower Greensands of England and occur within Eocene and Cretaceous sedimentary strata underlying the coastal plains of New Jersey and Delaware. Although greensand has been found throughout Phanerozoic and Late Precambrian sedimentary deposits, it appears to be most common in Eocene, Cambrian, and Cretaceous sedimentary deposits.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, greensand refers to a fertilizer produced from glauconitic siltstone units belonging to the Serra da Saudade Formation, Bambuí Group, of Neoproterozoic/Ediacaran age. The outcrops occur in the Serra da Saudade ridge, in Alto Paranaíba region, Minas Gerais. It is a silt-clay sedimentary rock, laminated, bluish-green, composed of glauconite (40–80%), potassium feldspar (10–15%), quartz (10–60%), muscovite (5%) and minor quantities of biotite (2%), goethite (&lt;1%), titanium and manganese oxides (&lt;1%), barium phosphate and rare-earth elements phosphates (&lt;1%).

Enriched levels of potash have K2O grades between 8% and 12%, thickness up to and are associated to the glauconitic levels, dark green in color. Glauconite is authigenic and highly mature. The high concentration of this mineral is related to a depositional environment with a low sedimentation rate. The glauconitic siltstone has resulted from a high level flooding event in the Bambuí Basin. The sedimentary provenance is from supracrustal feldsic elements on a continental margin environment with an acidic magmatic arc (foreland basin).

===Great Britain===
In Great Britain, greensand usually refers to specific rock strata of Early Cretaceous age. A distinction is made between the Upper Greensand and Lower Greensand. The term greensand was originally applied by William Smith to glauconitic sandstones in the west of England and subsequently used for the similar deposits of the Weald, before it was appreciated that the latter are actually two distinct formations separated by the Gault Clay. The Upper Greensand was also once known as either the &quot;Malm&quot; or &quot;Malm Rock Of Western Sussex&quot;.

Both Upper and Lower Greensand outcrops appear in the scarp slopes surrounding the London Basin and the Weald. Prominent seams are to be found in the Vale of White Horse, in Bedfordshire, in Kent, Surrey, the South Downs National Park, elsewhere in Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, and the Jurassic Coast in Dorset. Some minor seams are found further west in Devon in the Blackdown and Haldon hills.

The soil of the greensand is quite varied, ranging from fertile to fairly sterile. On the fertile soils chestnut and stands of hazel and oak are common, while Scots pine and birch colonise the poorer soils. These Greensand Ridges are popular long distance walking routes, for instance the Greensand Way in Kent.
====Lower Greensand==== 

The Lower Greensand (known as the Woburn Sand north of the London Basin) is of Aptian age. In the Weald the Lower Greensand consists of four deposits which are partly diachronous: the Atherfield Clay thick, the Folkestone Beds thick; the Hythe beds thick and the Sandgate Beds thick. Although it appears both north and south of the London Basin it is not present everywhere beneath the Chalk Group which underlies the basin; the Gault lies directly on eroded Jurassic or Devonian rocks under much of the area.

====Upper Greensand==== 

The Upper Greensand is of Albian age. It represents a sandy lithofacies deposited in areas of stronger currents than the Gault Clay. Like the Lower Greensand it is not present beneath the whole of the London Basin, apparently passing laterally into Gault clay east of a line between Dunstable and Tatsfield and of uncertain extent to the east of London.

Outcrops of the Upper Greensand occur in the southwest of England including the Blackdown Hills and East Devon Plateau and the Haldon Hills, remnants of a once much wider extent.

==Properties and uses==
The green color of greensand is due to variable amounts of the mineral glauconite, an iron potassium silicate with very low weathering resistance; as a result, greensand tends to be weak and friable. It is a common ingredient as a source of potassium in organic gardening and farming fertilisers. Greensand glauconite is used as a water softener for its chemical-exchange properties. Greensand coated with manganese oxide (called manganese greensand) is used in well water treatment systems to remove dissolved (reduced) iron and manganese with the addition of an oxidant, usually potassium permanganate, under controlled pH conditions. It is also used as a type of rock for stone walls in areas where greensand is common.

In Roman times in Britain, coarse grits derived from the lower greensand were used to line the inner surface of mortars (grinding bowls) produced in Oxfordshire pottery kilns.

Recently, glauconitic greensand has become a popular organic soil amendment. The porous properties of glauconite greensand allows for the absorption of water and minerals, making irrigation and nutrient delivery much more efficient (see soil conditioner). Greensand can be used to absorb excess water in clay-rich soils and to prevent water loss in sandy soils.

<doc id="887766" wikidata="Q2488684" url="?curid=887766" title="Ultra low frequency">
<text>Ultra low frequency (ULF) is the ITU designation for the frequency range of electromagnetic waves between 300 hertz and 3 kilohertz, corresponding to wavelengths between 1,000 to 100 km. In magnetosphere science and seismology, alternative definitions are usually given, including ranges from 1 mHz to 100 Hz, 1 mHz to 1 Hz, and 10 mHz to 10 Hz.

Many types of waves in the ULF frequency band can be observed in the magnetosphere and on the ground. These waves represent important physical processes in the near-Earth plasma environment. The speed of the ULF waves is often associated with the Alfvén velocity that depends on the ambient magnetic field and plasma mass density.

This band is used for communications in mines, as it can penetrate the earth.

==Earthquakes==
Some monitoring stations have reported that earthquakes are sometimes preceded by a spike in ULF activity. A remarkable example of this occurred before the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in California, although a subsequent study indicates that this was little more than a sensor malfunction. On December 9, 2010, geoscientists announced that the DEMETER satellite observed a dramatic increase in ULF radio waves over Haiti in the month before the magnitude 7.0 Mw 2010 earthquake. Researchers are attempting to learn more about this correlation to find out whether this method can be used as part of an early warning system for earthquakes.

==Earth mode communications==
ULF has been used by the military for secure communications through the ground. NATO AGARD publications from the 1960s detailed many such systems, although it is possible that the published papers left a lot unsaid about what actually was developed secretly for defense purposes. Communications through the ground using conduction fields is known as &quot;Earth-Mode&quot; communications and was first used in World War I. Radio amateurs and electronics hobbyists have used this mode for limited range communications using audio power amplifiers connected to widely spaced electrode pairs hammered into the soil. At the receiving end, the signal is detected as a weak electric current between a further pair of electrodes. Using weak signal reception methods with PC-based DSP filtering with extremely narrow bandwidths, it is possible to receive signals at a range of a few kilometers with a transmitting power of 10100W and electrode spacing of around 1050m.

<doc id="887767" wikidata="Q621063" url="?curid=887767" title="Super low frequency">
<text>Super low frequency (SLF) is the ITU designation for electromagnetic waves (radio waves) in the frequency range between 30 hertz and 300 hertz. They have corresponding wavelengths of 10,000 to 1,000 kilometers. This frequency range includes the frequencies of AC power grids (50 hertz and 60 hertz). Another conflicting designation which includes this frequency range is Extremely Low Frequency (ELF), which in some contexts refers to all frequencies up to 300 hertz.

Because of the extreme difficulty of building transmitters that can generate such long waves, frequencies in this range have been used in very few artificial communication systems. However, SLF waves can penetrate seawater to a depth of hundreds of meters. Therefore, in recent decades the U.S., Russian and Indian militaries have built huge radio transmitters using SLF frequencies to communicate with their submarines. The U.S. naval service is called Seafarer and operates at 76 hertz. It became operational in 1989 but was discontinued in 2004 due to advances in VLF communication systems. The Russian service is called ZEVS and operates at 82 hertz. The Indian Navy has an operational ELF communication facility at the INS Kattabomman naval base to communicate with its Arihant class and Akula class submarines.

The requirements for receivers at SLF frequencies are less stringent than for transmitters, because the signal strength (set by atmospheric noise) is far above the noise floor of the receiver, so small, inefficient antennas can be used. Radio amateurs have received signals in this range using simple receivers built around personal computers, with coil or loop antennas connected to the PCs sound card. Signals are analysed by a software fast Fourier transform algorithm and converted into audible sound.

<doc id="887768" wikidata="Q3793679" url="?curid=887768" title="Bounty Hamster">
<text>Bounty Hamster is a 2003 British-New Zealand comic science fiction animated series created by David Max Freedman and Alan Gilbey.

==Plot==
Cassie Harrison, a 13-year-old girl, is searching the universe for her father after he was kidnapped by space pirates. To help her, she enlists the aid of the only bounty hunter she can afford, a talking blue hamster named Marion. They have an odd-couple style relationship and search the universe together for Cassie&#x27;s father.

The blue space ship the pair use is divided into two parts, a driving cockpit which can be detached in order to fly down to a planet in a similar manner to a jolly boat from a vessel, and a larger booster component which is attached on top of the small driving compartment. Scenes involving driving often show large objects and rooms that appear within the ship. The name of the ship is Keith.

Running gags include Marion pulling many, or odd, objects from his cheeks as if they are large pockets. In one instance he pulls out a large assortment of objects to help him and Cassie when they are falling off a cliff and this includes a cruise ship. Also, one of the science fiction references is the gag in which C-3PO from &quot;Star Wars&quot; appears in the ship and Cassie asks who he is.

Every episode starts with a brief explanation of the basic running plot and features a sequence showing Cassie&#x27;s father being taken away. This is followed by a short sequence showing Marion being uncovered from a &#x27;tough&#x27; armoured outfit and standing on stilts. The next sequence features the screen divided into four quarters, each showing several different scenes from episodes. The credits culminate in Marion uttering a fierce growl. The closing credits show an image of stars in space. The tune to the theme sounds like the words &#x27;bounty hamster&#x27; but with notes to a 3-4 beat.

Despite airing in a children&#x27;s timeslot, the show has quite a broad appeal, containing frequent science fiction references, in-jokes and puns, as well as nods to other movies and TV series. Marion&#x27;s name and eyepatch is a parody of John Wayne and the character he played in &quot;True Grit&quot;. The show&#x27;s premise is also based on &quot;True Grit&quot; – a young girl loses her father and then hires a bounty hunter.

==Characters==
*Marion, the hamster (voiced by Alan Marriott) – Marion is a blue talking hamster. He wears an eyepatch on his right eye (purely for aesthetic reasons, as he has both eyes) and can fit all manner of objects within his cheek cavities. He is often outraged by stronger characters calling him &#x27;cute&#x27; and tries to defend his personality despite his feminine name and small structure and this is when he says his catchphrase &quot;Don&#x27;t call me CUTE!&quot; before going berserk. He is often seen as being clumsy or forgetful, with the exception of comedic instances, such as when he remembers to use a remote-controlled locking device on his space ship.
*Cassie Harrison (voiced by Juliet Cowan) – Cassie (short for Cassiopeia) has dirty blonde hair and is usually the more rational of the pair. She is constantly searching for her father and complaining of Marion&#x27;s foolishness.

==Episodes==

In addition, &quot;A.I. (Artificial Idiocy)&quot;, an episode between &quot;The Lost World&quot; and &quot;Planet of the Japes&quot; was originally slated to air as episode 21; but due to budget cuts at ITV, the episode was never made and was replaced by &quot;The Trial&quot;, a low-budget clip show episode. According to co-creator Alan Gilbey, the episode would have involved a past friend of Marion now hunting the duo down in a starship.

<doc id="887777" wikidata="Q4358476" url="?curid=887777" title="USS Stringham (DD-83)">
<text>USS &quot;Stringham&quot; (DD–83) was a in the United States Navy during World War I. Later she served in World War II as APD-6. She was the second ship named for Silas Horton Stringham.

&quot;Stringham&quot; was laid down on 19 September 1917 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company. The ship was launched on 30 March 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Edward B. Hill. The destroyer was commissioned on 2 July 1918, Cmdr. Neil E. Nichols in command.

==Service history==

===World War I===
Following commissioning, &quot;Stringham&quot; was assigned to convoy escort and antisubmarine duty through the end of World War I. Upon her return to the United States in 1919, she was assigned to Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 6 of the Atlantic Fleet Destroyer Force. Except for a six-month period from December 1919 to June 1920 when she was in reduced commission, &quot;Stringham&quot; remained fully active with the Atlantic Fleet until the middle of 1922. During that time, alpha-numeric hull numbers were adopted by the Navy; and &quot;Stringham&quot; was redesignated DD-83 effective 17 July 1920. On 2 June 1922, she was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.

===World War II===
She remained inactive until 1940, when she was apparently moved to the Norfolk Navy Yard for conversion to a high-speed transport (APD). On 2 August 1940, &quot;Stringham&quot; was redesignated APD-6.

====1940-1942====
On 11 December 1940, she was recommissioned at Norfolk, whence she operated until mid-1942. Her duties consisted primarily of escorting coastal convoys from point to point along the eastern seaboard and to various bases in the Caribbean Sea. On 18 April 1942, &quot;Stringham&quot; attacked an enemy submarine, but could not confirm a kill, even though heavy black oil surfaced soon after her attack. On the following day, she put into Norfolk and participated in amphibious exercises in the Chesapeake Bay through the first week in July.

On 6 July, she got underway from Norfolk in company with a convoy bound for the Panama Canal. She transited the canal on 13 July, reported to the Commander, Southeastern Pacific, and continued west. After stops in the Society and Fiji Islands, she reached Espiritu Santo, in the New Hebrides, on 14 August. Two days later, she put to sea on the first of many resupply voyages to help bolster the marines defending the beachhead on Guadalcanal.

The Guadalcanal campaign was unique among the amphibious operations conducted in the Pacific during World War II. Neither the United States nor Japan enjoyed the overwhelming naval superiority which in almost every other case ensured victory for the greater force. Relative equality made the naval forces of each side a constant threat to the supply lines of the other. Consequently, both sides relied upon the high-speed transport, converted destroyers like &quot;Stringham&quot;, which were well armed for transports and fast enough to evade more powerfully armed warships. While the contribution of the larger elements of the American fleet cannot be overlooked, the struggle for Guadalcanal was to a great extent the battle of the high-speed transport. &quot;Stringham&quot; and similar high speed transports succeeded where their Japanese counterparts failed. They kept the marines supplied.

On 23 August, during &quot;Stringham&quot;″s second run to Guadalcanal, a torpedo passed her close astern; and she immediately charged to the attack. She dropped 11 depth charges; forced the submarine to broach; and then lost contact. Although her crew thought at the time they had sunk the submarine, subsequent checking failed to verify their victory. Not long after her scrape with the submarine, &quot;Stringham&quot; was ordered out to join the group of ships attempting to tow the destroyer , torpedoed the previous evening, into Tulagi. The imminence of the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, however, forced that weak formation to abandon &quot;Blue&quot; and seek shelter. Accordingly, &quot;Blue&quot; sank at 2223 on 23 August. &quot;Stringham&quot; resumed her supply runs in the Solomons until 5 October, when she got underway from New Caledonia to return to the California coast.

====1943====
After six weeks in the Mare Island Navy Yard, she got underway for the South Pacific. Her return to action, however, was short-lived for—while operating in Pepasala Bay in the Russell Islands on 26 February 1943—a heavy squall forced her aground on a reef. In maneuvering clear of the reef, she was forced to back down to avoid a collision with the destroyer and damaged her starboard propeller. After emergency repairs at Tulagi, she was routed back to Mare Island, where she arrived on 16 April.

Over the next six months, &quot;Stringham&quot; advanced up the Solomons staircase with the American forces. In mid-August, she participated in the landings at Vella Lavella in the central Solomons. That operation cut the Japanese supply lines to Kolombangara and delivered vital air bases to the Americans. On 27 October, she and six other APDs, along with various smaller ships, put a force of New Zealanders ashore at Mono and Stirling islands in the Treasury Islands sub-group. November found her supporting the assault on Bougainville at Empress Augusta Bay.

On the day after Christmas, &quot;Stringham&quot; joined the American forces which outflanked the Bismarck Barrier at Cape Gloucester, near the western terminus of New Britain. From that position, they could move in two directions—west to pounce upon the back of the New Guinea hen or north to the Admiralties to isolate Kavieng and Rabaul. &quot;Stringham&quot; participated in one operation in each direction.

====1944====
On 2 January 1944, she supported the forces which landed at Saidor, New Guinea; and, in March, she assisted in the invasion of Emirau. Between these two operations, &quot;Stringham&quot; helped land troops in the Green Islands, the northernmost subgroup of the Solomons, located between Buka and New Ireland.

During the spring of 1944, American military thinking focused increasingly upon the Central Pacific invasion route to Japan. Accordingly, &quot;Stringham&quot; returned to Hawaii with marines embarked; and both she and her passengers commenced preparations for the invasion of the Marianas. The initial waves of assault troops stormed the beaches at Saipan on 15 June. &quot;Stringham&quot; discharged her marines the following day and patrolled off Saipan throughout the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 and 20 June. On 22 June, Underwater Demolition Team (UDT) 7 shifted to her from for the Tinian phase of the Marianas operation. Until the landings, the high-speed transport conducted sporadic bombardment and harassment fire on Tinian. On 10 July, she sent her UDT men ashore to reconnoiter the two potential landing sites; and, just before the actual assault began on 24 July, her frogmen participated in a daylight feint at Tinian Town to divert Japanese attention from the actual landing sites. On 28 July, she completed her work with UDT 7 in the Marianas and headed for Espiritu Santo, via Eniwetok Atoll.

&quot;Stringham&quot;, was at Purvis Bay, Florida Island, in the midst of exercises preparatory to the invasion of the Palaus when UDT 7 rejoined her on 5 September. By 12 September, she and her frogmen were off the coast of Angaur with Task Group 32.5. At 1035, she disembarked the UDT men at Peleliu to clear a path through heavy minefields. That afternoon, she towed to Kossol Passage, and then returned to work with the UDT teams until 27 September, when she headed for Manus. There she was moored alongside . On the night of 3 October, a fire broke out on &quot;Clemson&quot; and swept across &quot;Stringham&quot; amidships and aft, igniting the UDT teams&#x27; rubber boats and bags of explosives. &quot;Stringham&quot; drifted from her moorings after the lines were cut, and her crew finally got the fire under control.

====1945====
&quot;Stringham&quot; returned to the United States for , repairs, and alterations. She did not return to the western Pacific until 17 March 1945. She joined the southern defense group at Saipan and sortied with it for Okinawa on 26 March. The high-speed transport arrived off Okinawa on 2 April, the day following the initial assault, and screened the transport area until 7 April, when she headed for Guam. During that time, &quot;Stringham&quot; took two &quot;kamikazes&quot; under fire, one on 3 April and one on 6 April. The former succeeded in crashing while the latter gave up his plunge in the face of &quot;Stringham&quot;″s heavy antiaircraft fire, dove on a destroyer, but missed both American ships.

&quot;Stringham&quot; screened another convoy from Guam to the Ryukyus, reaching Okinawa on 22 April. She remained in the vicinity for five relatively uneventful days; then headed back to Guam. On this voyage, she rendered assistance to the hospital ship, , which had been crashed by a Japanese &quot;kamikaze&quot;. &quot;Comfort&quot; was able to resume course without assistance, but &quot;Stringham&quot; shepherded her until relieved by .

While at Guam, &quot;Stringham&quot; was rammed by , a battle casualty. The APD&#x27;s starboard side was damaged, as was her bridge, her forward crew&#x27;s compartment, and much of her electrical equipment. Because of this, &quot;Stringham&quot; was ordered back to San Diego for extensive repairs. On 19 June, she entered San Diego and began conversion back to a destroyer; and, on 25 June, she resumed her former designation, DD-83. In August, the end of the war brought a halt to &quot;Stringham&quot;″s conversion. Later that month, it was determined that she would be decommissioned at Philadelphia. In September, she sailed from San Diego, transited the Panama Canal, and proceeded to Philadelphia, where she reported for duty to the Commandant, 4th Naval District, on 26 September. She was decommissioned on 9 November 1945, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 5 December 1945. &quot;Stringham&quot; was scrapped at Philadelphia in March 1946.

<doc id="887778" wikidata="Q1431723" url="?curid=887778" title="Volkov Commander">
<text>Volkov Commander (VC) is a file manager for DOS inspired by the Norton Commander. Volkov Commander is purely written in assembly language and is very small (less than 100 KB) and fast.

Volkov Commander was written by Vsevolod V. Volkov, a programmer from Ukraine, born in 1971. The stable version is released as shareware. A preview version is also available, which is interchangeably mentioned as an Alpha or Beta release on the website. The Webmaster for the public face of VC was Daniel R. Egner of Germany.

==Version 4==
Version 4.05 is the last fully functional release of the Volkov Commander. It is a pure DOS application, so it doesn&#x27;t support special features of Windows 9x like long filenames. (Apart from that, it can be used under Windows 9x.) Besides the Russian version, there is an English one. Version 4 is shareware and can be tested free for 30 days.

==Version 4.99==
Vsevolod Volkov was working on a new version 5 of his commander (VC 5). It was still in a phase of development. This upgrade works in a Windows 9x / Windows NT or OS/2 environment. VC 5 supports long filenames, and can explore archives (*.zip, *.arc, *.rar, etc.) as though they were directories. When updated last time, the actual beta release was version 4.99.08 alpha. Most of the features of the final release are already available. Though it is a pure DOS application, the new commander supports some of the special features of Windows 95/98/NT. &quot;Beta version (4.99.xx), of course, can be tested for free, because in this stadium of development it does not yet represent a complete program.&quot;

==Rumored later version==
Rumours about existing Version 5 of Volkov Commander:
:In the community, someone posted about the existing VC 5. Here is what Vsevolod answered:
:[...] VC 5.0 is a fake. The last released version is 4.99.08 alpha. [...] I really didn&#x27;t release new version for very long time. So, development of VC is hold in fact. But I don&#x27;t exclude possibility of new releases. I have no roadmap and could not promise something.&quot;

VC 4.99.08 is included within Ultimate Boot CD (UBCD) v3.4, as part of the general FreeDOS base package.

Volkov Commander is included in the NwDsk DOS network boot disk.

<text>Szczebrzeszyn (; ; ) is a city in southeastern Poland in Lublin Voivodeship, in Zamość County, about 20 km west of Zamość. From 1975–1999, it was part of the Zamość Voivodeship administrative district. The town serves as the seat to the Gmina Szczebrzeszyn district. A 2004 census counted 5,357 inhabitants. It lends its name to the Szczebrzeszyn Landscape Park. Szczebrzeszyn is often called the &quot;Capital City of Polish Language&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Szczebrzeszyn&#x27;s history can be traced back to 1352, during the reign of Casimir III, although archaeological evidence suggests the area had been settled for several centuries prior to this. Neighboring villages named in Nestor&#x27;s 11th century chronicle of Rus further support that Szczebrzeszyn is much older, once lying beside a major commercial route running from south to north.

By 1492, trade had developed enough to warrant a special act imposed by Jan Olbracht. The Act specified which roads Szczebrzeszyn merchants could use when traveling through Lesser Poland with their wares. As merchants traveled through Szczebrzeszyn, they paid set taxes which proved to be an excellent source of revenue.

After Jan Amor Tarnowski of Tarnów&#x27;s death in 1500, Szczebrzeszyn stayed in the hands of the Tarnowski family for the next 20 years. Later it was included in a dowry to the Kmita family. At that time long-running feuds among family members re-ignited over the Szczebrzeszyn inheritance, while other magnates laid claims. King Zygmunt August issued a binding decree to end this dispute in 1555, which allocated rights over the city to the Gorka family of Greater Poland. The Gorkas took a strong interest in religious matters and granted freedom to all religious groups. They built a Greek Orthodox church, transformed the Roman Catholic parish church into a Calvinist one, and opened a synagogue nearby.

=== The Holocaust ===
Between 3,000 and 4,000 Jews lived in Szczebrzeszyn when the German Army occupied the city in 1939. Isaac Bashevis Singer&#x27;s grandmother, Tema Blima Szejner was from the city. Singer mentions his grandmother Tema in his autobiographical novel &#x27;In My Father&#x27;s Court&#x27;. On October 14, 1939—in spite of the fact it was the Jewish Sabbath—the Germans ordered the Jews to clean the streets for the entire day. They treated them brutally by cutting or tearing off their beards, cursing them, and beating them. In mid-October a police force was formed in Szczebrzeszyn—composed of 60 men—and was instructed to persecute the Jewish population of the city.

Several hundred Jews from Kalisz and Wloclawek were re-settled in Szczebrzeszyn. The Judenrat was forced to provide several dozen men for work in Zamość each day. According to a Polish doctor in the town, Zygmunt Klukowski: &quot;The Jewish laborers are sent to Bortatycze and Bialobrzeg outside of Zamosc. The work consists of digging ditches in order to drain the swamps there. They must work standing in the water. They sleep in barracks that are incredibly dirty. They must make this trip (to the labor camp) every day, and if they make the slightest mistake they are beaten with clubs. The Jewish slave laborers are covered with lice. They are mostly boys, 17–20 years old.&quot;

On November 10, 1942, Klukowski wrote: &quot;In principle, all the Jews in the settlements of the Bilgoraj district, to which Szczebreszyn belongs, have been killed. The only ones remaining are those in the forests, valleys, etc.&quot; In total, there were six separate transports from Szczebrzeszyn to Bełżec extermination camp between May and November 1942—totaling more than 5,500 Jewish men, women and children to their immediate deaths. Hundreds of other Jews were murdered in Szczebrzeszyn, hunted down by police and Polish civilians and then murdered. One Polish couple did shelter a Jewish family and were named Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem after the war. The once vibrant Jewish community of Szczebrzeszyn ceased to exist.

=== After the Zamość Uprising ===
In July the Polish resistance carried out the country-wide Operation Tempest, and in the Zamość region the town of Szczebrzeszyn and Zamość itself were freed by the partisans.

== In literature ==
The name Szczebrzeszyn is infamous for being very difficult to pronounce for non-native speakers. Polish poet, Jan Brzechwa, used the town&#x27;s name in his poem entitled &quot;Chrząszcz&quot;. The line with Szczebrzeszyn goes like this:
&quot;W Szczebrzeszynie chrząszcz brzmi w trzcinie&quot; (pronunciation)

This roughly translates to: &quot;In [the town of] Szczebrzeszyn a beetle sounds in the reed&quot;. The phrase has been incorporated in everyday language as an epitome of Polish tongue twisters, and is often presented by natives to foreign learners of Polish. A two monuments depicting a cricket playing the violin that were erected in Szczebrzeszyn refers to the poem.

In 2004 Philip Bibel (1909–2006), brother of painter Leon Bibel, published his &quot;Tales of the Shtetl,&quot; a memoir of early 20th century life in the shtetl of Szczebrzeszyn. Sample chapters can be read here:
