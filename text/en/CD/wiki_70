<text>The AEG C.VIII was a prototype two-seat reconnaissance aircraft of World War I. 
Two examples were built, based on the successful C.IV design, one of biplane configuration, the other a triplane (the latter sometimes referred to as the C.VIII.Dr). Neither version offered enough of an improvement on the C.IV to make mass production worthwhile.

== Variants ==
* C.VIII - Biplane prototype two-seater fighter/reconnaissance aircraft.

<doc id="894568" wikidata="Q1155896" url="?curid=894568" title="Yamamoto District, Akita">
<text>is a rural district located in Akita Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2020, the district has a population of 24,727 and an area of 764.27 km2. All of the city of Noshiro was formerly part of Yamamoto District.

==Towns and villages==
*Fujisato
*Happō
*Mitane

==History==
The area of Yamamoto District (Hiyama District, Akita) was formerly part of Dewa Province, and came under the new province of Ugo Province on January 19, 1869, following the Meiji restoration. At the time, the area consisted of 2 towns and 72 villages formerly under the control of Kubota Domain, based at Akita. The area became part of Akita Prefecture in 1871, and was organized as Yamamoto District in 1878. 


With the establishment of the municipality system on April 1, 1889, two towns (Noshiroko and Hiyama) and 24 villages were established. Futatsui was raised to town status on June 4, 1902, followed by Kado on January 1, 1932. Noshiroko became the city of Noshiro on October 1, 1940.

Hachimori was raised to town status on October 1, 1954. Hiyama was absorbed into Noshiro on April 1, 1955, and the town of Kado was renamed Kotooka. The village of Yamamoto gained town status on September 1, 1962, followed by Fujisato on November 1, 1963, and Hachiryū on September 1, 1965.

In 2006, as part of the Heisei period Municipal mergers and dissolutions in Japan, all of the district except for the town of Fujisato was scheduled to merge with Noshiro to form the new city of Shirakami. However, the residents of Noshiro were opposed to this name and left the merger conference. The remaining six towns and villages tried to merge, but this plan failed as the merger would turn Hachimori and Minehama into an exclave of the new city. Noshiro delegates attempted to return to the conference, but the other conference members rejected their participation and the meeting split into the three different merger conferences of &quot;Noshiro-Futatsui,&quot; &quot;Southern Three Towns,&quot; and &quot;Northern Two Towns and Villages.&quot;
As a result:

* On March 20, 2006 - The towns of Hachiryū, Koto&#x27;oka, and Yamamoto were merged to create the town of Mitane.
* On March 21, 2006 - The town of Futatsui was merged with the expanded city of Noshiro, although Futatsui wanted the new city&#x27;s name to be Yoneshiro (米代市).
* On March 27, 2006 - The town of Hachimori, and the village of Minehama were merged to create the town of Happō.

== Economics ==
The area of Mitane is known for growing junsai.

As of 2020, the areas on the sea are being considered for an offshore wind project.

<text>The AEG Dr.I was a triplane fighter of World War I, based on the D.I. Only a single prototype was built and its poor performance meant that no production ensued. The Dr.I was a Dreidecker (triplane) variant of the D.I and had been inspired by a Sopwith Triplane that had been captured intact. A number of proposals for fighters with comparable characteristics were put forward, and AEG&#x27;s contribution to the program appeared in October 1917. Other than the triple wing it was a D.I, the aircraft had the same fuselage, engine and twin gun armament of its earlier brethren.

==History==
The area of Minamiakita District was formerly part of Akita District [ja], Dewa Province, and came under the new province of Ugo Province on January 19, 1869 following the Meiji restoration. At the time, the area consisted of 2 towns and 166 villages formerly under the control of Kubota Domain, based at Akita. The area became part of Akita Prefecture in 1871, and was organized as Minamiakita District in 1878. 


With the establishment of the municipality system on April 1, 1889, one town (Tsuchizaki Minato) and 35 villages were established. Funakawa Minato was raised to town status on October 24, 1894, followed by Gojōme on January 19, 1896 and Kitaura on June 4, 1902. Funakoshi became a town on December 20, 1904, followed by Okubo on April 1, 1924 and Hitoichi on December 1, 1925 and Terauchi on August 1, 1933, Iitagawa on November 30, 1935.

Tsuchizaki Minato and Terauchi were annexed by Akita City on April 1, 1941 and the towns of Iitagawa and Okubo joined to form the town of Showa on March 24, 1942. However, on September 28, 1950 a portion of the town of Showa split away to re-create the town of Iitagawa. The town of Funakawa merged with four neighboring villages to create the city of Oga on March 31, 1954, which subsequently annexed the towns of Funakoshi and Kitaura on March 1, 1955. On September 30, 1956, Hitoichi was renamed Hachirōgata. Tenno was raised to town status on November 3, 1961, followed by Wakami on November 1, 1970 and Iikawa on August 1, 1974.

In 2006, as part of the Heisei period Municipal mergers and dissolutions in Japan, the remaining seven towns and one village in the district were reduced to the present three towns and one village:

*On March 22, 2005 - the towns of Iitagawa, Shōwa and Tennō were merged to create the city of Katagami.
*On March 22, 2005 - the town of Wakami was merged into the expanded city of Oga.

<text>Cerci (: cercus) are paired appendages usually on the rear-most segments of many arthropods, including insects and symphylans. Many forms of cerci serve as sensory organs, but some serve as pinching weapons or as organs of copulation. In many insects, they simply may be functionless vestigial structures.

In basal arthropods, such as silverfish, the cerci originate from the eleventh abdominal segment. As segment eleven is reduced or absent in the majority of arthropods, in such cases, the cerci emerge from the tenth abdominal segment. It is not clear that other structures so named are homologous. In the Symphyla they are associated with spinnerets.

==Morphology and functions==
Most cerci are segmented and jointed, or filiform (threadlike), but some take very different forms. Some Diplura, in particular &quot;Japyx&quot; species, have large, stout forcipate (pincer-like) cerci that they use in capturing their prey.

The Dermaptera, or earwigs, are well known for the forcipate cerci that most of them bear, though species in the suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina do not. It is not clear how many of the Dermaptera use their cerci for anything but defense, but some definitely feed on prey caught with the cerci, much as the Japygidae do.

Crickets have particularly long cerci while other insects have cerci that are too small to be noticeable. However, it is not always obvious that small cerci are without function; they are rich in sensory cells and may be of importance in guiding copulation and oviposition.

In groups such as crickets and cockroaches, cerci play important sensory roles. They have been shown to be sensitive to puffs of air and low-frequency vibration, and thus trigger anti-predatory responses such as escape in response to certain predators. In field crickets, the range of frequency detection by the cerci spans from infrasonic sound to nearly 1 kHz. In crickets, higher-frequency sound such as stridulation and ultrasonic bat calls are picked up by a separate tympanal organ, not the cerci.

Some hexapods such as mayflies, silverfish and diplurans possess an accompanying third central tail filament which extends from the tip of the abdomen. This is referred to as the &quot;terminal filament&quot; and is not regarded as a cercus.

Aphids have tube-like cornicles or siphunculi that are sometimes mistaken for cerci but are not morphologically related to cerci.

==Evolutionary origin==
Like many insect body parts, including mandibles, antennae and stylets, cerci are thought to have evolved from what were legs on the primal insect form, a creature that may have resembled a velvet worm, Symphylan or a centipede, worm-like with one pair of limbs for each segment behind the head or anterior tagma.

<text>was a town located in Yuri District, Akita Prefecture, Japan.

In 2003, the town had an estimated population of 12,836 and a density of 103.50 persons per km2. The total area was 124.02 km2.

On October 1, 2005, Kisakata, along with the town of Konoura, was merged into the town of Nikaho (all from Yuri District) to become the city of Nikaho.

The poet Bashō visited Kisakata as part of his 1689 travels in Honshū, and composed a famous waka about Kisakata&#x27;s islands. However, an eruption of Mount Chōkai and Kisakata earthquake in 1804 caused the sea bed to rise, and the islands are now surrounded by land, not water. There is a statue of Bashō at the Kanman Temple, which he visited.

For hikers and climbers Kisakata is the jumping-off point for trips to Mount Chōkai. There are also a number of picturesque waterfalls, including the Naso no Shirataki (奈曽の白滝) and the Mototaki (元滝).

==History==
The area of Yuri Distinct was formerly part of Dewa Province, which was divided into the provinces of Ugo Province and Uzen Province following the Meiji restoration on January 19, 1869, with the area of Yuri becoming part of Ugo Province.

Akita Prefecture was founded on December 13, 1871.


With the establishment of the municipality system on December 23, 1878, Yuri District, with three towns (Honjō, Kameda and Yashima) and 28 villages was established.

<text>Clive Doucet (born 1946) is a Canadian writer and politician. He served as the Ottawa City Councillor for Capital Ward from 1997 to 2010 and ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Ottawa in the 2010 Ottawa municipal election, finishing third with 15 per cent of the vote. Eight years later, in 2018, he again ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Ottawa, this time finishing second with 22 per cent of the vote.

==Early life==

Doucet was born in 1946 in London, England to an Acadian serviceman from Grand Étang and an English war bride. Doucet grew up in the city of Ottawa, Ontario, having moved there at the age of six. He also spent some of his youth in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. Doucet was raised as a Catholic, and his mother was Protestant. He became a Quaker in 1980. He first came to Ottawa in his teens when his father worked there. Doucet played for the Carleton Ravens football team for one season, and then moved to the University of Toronto. A football injury took him out of that sport and into the sport of rowing. He received a master&#x27;s degree in urban anthropology from the University of Montreal. In his younger days, he spent a summer working in a rock copper mine in British Columbia and helped build the National Arts Centre as a construction worker. Before entering politics, Doucet was a municipal affairs policy advisor.

==Politics==
In the 1997 regional elections, Doucet ran for Ottawa-Carleton Regional Council in Capital Ward, which includes The Glebe, Old Ottawa South, Old Ottawa East, part of Riverview Park, Carleton University, and Heron Park. He was an activist against the proposed Bronson Freeway, which propelled him to victory.

Central to his political platform has been the creation of a light rail rapid transit system across Ottawa manifested to date with the O-Train demonstration project (today&#x27;s Trillium Line).

On 6 July 2010, Doucet announced his candidacy for Mayor of Ottawa in the 2010 Ottawa municipal election. Doucet joined a record number of 115 candidates running for municipal office in 2010, of which 15 challenged mayoral incumbent Larry O&#x27;Brien. Doucet placed third with 15 per cent of the vote.

During the 2018 Ontario election campaign, Doucet volunteered in Ottawa Centre for NDP candidate Joel Harden.

On July 27, 2018, Doucet announced that he would once again be running for Mayor of Ottawa in the 2018 Ottawa municipal election. Doucet placed second behind incumbent mayor Jim Watson who he had also lost to in 2010. He won 22% of the vote.

Doucet announced he will be running for the Green Party of Canada in the 2019 Canadian federal election in the riding of Cape Breton—Canso, the riding of his secondary residence of Grand Étang, Nova Scotia.

==Publications==
Throughout his career, Doucet has been a writer of novels, poetry, plays, and non-fiction, often writing about his Acadian roots. His most recent book, &quot;Urban Meltdown: Cities, Climate Change and Politics as Usual&quot;, was published by New Society Publishers in 2007. In its review, &quot;The Walrus&quot; wrote &quot;When Doucet speaks from the firm ground of experience as city councillor, his sharply logical solutions to municipal problems seem both hopeful and achievable.&quot;

<text>The AEG G.II was a German biplane bomber aircraft of World War I developed from the AEG G.I, with more powerful engines. The G.II was typically armed with three 7.92 mm (.312 in) machine guns and 200 kg (440 lb) of bombs. The bomber suffered stability problems, and many G.IIs were fitted with additional vertical tail surfaces on each side of the fin and rudder to improve flight handling characteristics.

This aircraft was the second assignment of Baron von Richthofen prior to becoming a pilot.

<text>The AEG G.IV was a biplane bomber aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft. It saw action during the First World War with the Luftstreitkräfte (Imperial German Army Air Service).

The G.IV was developed from the AEG G.III, featuring various refinements to power, bomb-load, and dimensions; specifically, it featured double the bomb capacity of the AEG G.II. Introduced to service during late 1916, the G.IV managed to achieve some operational success in both reconnaissance and direct combat missions. Because of its relatively short range, the G.IV served mainly as a tactical bomber and thus operated close to the front lines. It initially flew both day and night operations in France, Romania, Greece and Italy, but was increasingly restricted to night missions as the conflict progressed. Many night operations were considered nuisance raids, conducting without any specific targets other than the intention of disrupting enemy activity at night and achieving some collateral damage at best.

Some officials concluded that the G.IV was still inadequate in terms of offensive capacity and performance, thus further improvements were sought. A single specialised G.IV was converted into an armored, anti-tank gunship, the G.IVk (&quot;Kanone&quot;) with two 20 mm Becker cannon, but it did not see action. The G.IV would be the last in the series to see action as, while development of the improved G.V did proceed, the Armistice of 1918 that brought an end to the combat came into effect before this successor could become operational.

==Design and development==
The &quot;Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft&quot; (A.E.G.) G.IV was derived from the earlier G.III; according to the aviation historians Peter Gray and Owen Thetford, it was only a slight refinement of its predecessor. Designed from the onset to operate as a tactical bomber, the designers opted to incorporate various relatively modern technologies of the era, including onboard radios and electrically heated suits for the crew.

Unlike the other German twin-engined &quot;Großflugzeug&quot;-class (&quot;G&quot;) bombers, such as the Gotha G.V and the Friedrichshafen G.III, the G.IV featured an all-metal welded-tube frame that made the aircraft considerably more durable than most of its contemporaries. This design choice resulted in a relatively high structural weight despite its compact size for a twin-engine aircraft. The fuselage was constructed as one complete unit, instead of using sub-assemblies. In addition to the fuselage, the tail unit also made use of steel tube construction. Aside from plywood paneling on the nose, the exterior was covered by fabric. The tail unit featured a particularly tall rudder, which necessitated unconventional bracing to the upper longeron; the tail fins also featured a relatively unorthodox high camber.
The G.IV was powered by a pair of Mercedes D.IVa six-cylinder water-cooled inline piston engines; cooling was provided via automotive-type radiators positioned immediately aft of the propellers. These engines were mounted via a complex array of steel struts to the lower wing spars and braced against the upper longerons of the fuselage; somewhat unusually, there was no connecting struts between the engine and the upper wing. The wings comprised a fixed central section with detachable swept outer panels of composite construction, that being a pair of 50 mm diameter steel tube spars and solid wood ribs. To lighten the wing structure, strategically-placed holes were drilled and, besides loose threading, no solid connection between the ribs and the spars were made; several of the ribs were also false. The upper wing featured large balanced ailerons that shared a similar profile to that of the AEG C.IV. The undercarriage comprised a relatively sturdy tailskid and a pair of wheels, each one mounted directly beneath each engine and equipped with shock absorbers.

The G.IV was relatively well equipped in terms of armament, being capable of carrying a warload of 400 kg (880 lb). At the port side of the rear cockpit were a pair of tracks for carrying 25 lb bombs, an additional bomb rack was fitted between the rear and forward cockpits underneath the floor. Provisions for the carriage of up to five 50 lb bombs, one underneath each wing and up to three beneath the fuselage, were also made Bomb release was controlled from the forward cockpit. The G.IV was typically flown by a three-man crew, although a fourth could be readily accommodated when required. The rear gunner&#x27;s cockpit was located on the top of the fuselage, being equipped with a hinged window in the floor for viewing and fending off pursuing aircraft. When suitably configured, dual flight controls (with the notable exception of the ailerons) could be furnished, although this facility was of limited use outside of emergencies.

Several experimental modifications were made to the G.IV. A version with increased span and three bay struts, the G.IVb, is known to have been built. Furthermore, the aircraft was also converted into an armored, anti-tank gunship, the G.IVk (&quot;Kanone&quot;) with two 20 mm Becker cannon, however, this model is believed to have never entered service.

==Operational history==

The G.IV entered service with the German Air Force in late 1916. Even at the start of its career, its performance in several metrics was inferior to that of contemporary Gothas, including range and payload capacity, despite typically sharing the same Mercedes D.IVa engine. However, while Gotha crews struggled to keep their heavy aircraft aloft, the G.IV was regarded as being a relatively easy aircraft to fly. In light of its relatively small payload when fully-fueled, missions typically undertaken by the type were short range, thus permitting more munitions to be carried at the expense of fuel. On occasion, it was flown without any offensive payload to perform aerial reconnaissance flights.

The G.IV performed both day and night time bombing missions, often targeting areas to the rear of the contact line. Some crews of &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 4 are reputed to have flown up to seven combat missions per night on the Italian front. One notable mission conducted by a G.IV, piloted by Hauptmann Hermann Köhl, was conducted against the railway sheds in Padua, Italy.

By August 1918, it is believed that around 50 aircraft were still active with the German Air Force. The G.IV continued to be used operationally through to the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the conflict.

==Survivor==

A single example (number &quot;574/18&quot;) is preserved at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum. This example is significant not only as the only one of its kind in existence, but as the only preserved German, twin-engined combat aircraft from the First World War. The aircraft was brought to Canada in 1919 as a war trophy and has been at the museum since 1970.

After the war, several were converted into 6-passenger airliners. It was the only large German World War I aircraft to see commercial duties in any significant capacity. Initially, passengers sat in an open cockpit, but a Limousine version was soon developed. AEG attached a cabin fairing to enclose the passenger area and outfitted the nose with a hinged door for baggage. Finally, a toilet was provided aft of the passenger cabin.

<text>Ibram Lassaw (May 4, 1913 – December 30, 2003) was an Egyptian-born American sculptor of Russian heritage, known for non-objective construction in brazed metals.

==Early life and education==
Lassaw was born on May 4, 1913, in Alexandria, Egypt, of Russian Jewish émigré parents. He moved to the United States in 1921, and the family settled in Brooklyn, New York. He became a United States citizen in 1928. 

He first studied sculpture in 1926 at the Clay Club (now SculptureCenter) with Dorothea H. Denslow, and later at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design in New York. He made abstract paintings and drawings influenced by Kandinsky, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, and other artists. He also attended the City College of New York.

== Career ==
Influenced by his study of art history and readings in European art magazines, Lassaw began to make sculpture in the late 1920s. He was among the &quot;small group of artists committed themselves to abstract art during the 1930s.&quot; In his work, Ibram Lassaw &quot;replaced the monolithic solidity of cast metal with open-space constructions obtained by welding.&quot;

During the mid-1930s, Lassaw worked briefly for the Public Works of Art Project cleaning sculptural monuments around New York City. He subsequently joined the WPA as a teacher and sculptor until he was drafted into the army in 1942. Lassaw&#x27;s contribution to the advancement of sculptural abstraction went beyond mere formal innovation; his promotion of modernist styles during the 1930s did much to insure the growth of abstract art in the United States. He was one of the founding members of the American Abstract Artists group in 1937, and served as president of the American Abstract Artists organization from 1946 to 1949.

Lassaw is a sculptor who was a part of the New York School of Abstract expressionism during the 1940s and 1950s. Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, James Brooks, John Ferren, Willem de Kooning, and several other artists like Lassaw spent summers on the south fork of Long Island. Lassaw spent summers on Long Island from 1955 until he moved there permanently in 1963.

<doc id="894636" wikidata="Q3497630" url="?curid=894636" title="Robert Doyle">
<text>Robert Keith Bennett Doyle (born 20 May 1953) is an Australian politician who was the 103rd Lord Mayor of Melbourne, elected on 30 November 2008 until he resigned on 4 February 2018 amidst allegations of sexual harassment. He was previously Member for Malvern in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria from 1992 to 2006 and Leader of the Victorian Opposition from 2002 to 2006, representing the Liberal Party.

==Background==

Born in Melbourne, Doyle attended secondary school in Geelong. He graduated from Monash University in 1977, and the following year began work as a teacher at Geelong College, his &quot;alma mater&quot;. In 1982, he moved back to Melbourne, working as a departmental head at Lauriston Girls&#x27; School. After three years, he again changed schools, becoming a senior administrator and English teacher at Scotch College.

==State politics==
At the 1992 state election, Doyle succeeded in winning Liberal preselection for the electorate of Malvern by defeating Geoff Leigh. The Liberal Party, under Jeff Kennett, won government, defeating Joan Kirner. After the election, Doyle was immediately placed on the Crime Prevention Committee, and several other taskforces, particularly in the area of health. In April 1996, Doyle was promoted to the position of Parliamentary Secretary for Human Services.

The Kennett government suffered an unexpected defeat at the 1999 election, and Kennett himself retired from politics soon afterwards. Kennett&#x27;s deputy and Health Minister, Denis Napthine, became leader, and Doyle became shadow Health Minister.

===Leader of the Opposition (2002–2006)===
By 2002, the Liberal Party was flagging in the polls, and was expected to lose the election due later that year. Doyle successfully challenged Napthine for the leadership of the state Liberal Party, claiming that the party was &quot;facing political oblivion&quot; if it stayed under Napthine&#x27;s leadership.

He lost the 2002 election by a large margin; the result was in fact the worst showing for the main non-Labor party in Victoria since it adopted the Liberal banner in 1945. The party lost control of the Legislative Council for only the second time in Victorian parliamentary history, while their lower house seat count was more than halved, to 17 seats–their smallest presence in the legislature in half a century. The Liberals were further crippled when the Shadow Treasurer, Robert Dean, was deemed ineligible to stand because he had failed to update his voter registration after moving to a new electorate; under Victorian law, he was no longer on the electoral roll.

For some time after the 2002 defeat, Doyle remained Opposition Leader, partly through the sheer shortage of potential alternative candidates for the job in the much-reduced Liberal party room. However, following the decisions of Shadow Minister Victor Perton and Deputy Leader Phil Honeywood to resign, and the further resignation of Doyle&#x27;s Chief of Staff Ron Wilson and his Director of Communications Rob Clancy, debate as to Doyle&#x27;s future was re-ignited. Even many of Doyle&#x27;s key supporters—including Upper House MPs Andrea Coote and Philip Davis, and Michael Kroger and Helen Kroger—eventually recognised that Doyle&#x27;s leadership was unlikely to attract sufficient electoral support. It was also reported that Doyle&#x27;s personal approval rating had dropped to 15 per cent. On 4 May 2006, Doyle announced his resignation as Opposition Leader, stating that &quot;I have given my best—it was not enough&quot; and that the move would give the party the &quot;best chance of electoral success&quot;. Ted Baillieu succeeded Doyle in the post.

He officially ended his term as a Member of Parliament for the District of Malvern on 25 November 2006. On that day, the Liberals under Baillieu were again severely defeated; and as a result, Doyle publicly criticised several prominent party figures.

On 21 June 2007 the state government announced that it would appoint Doyle as the new chairman of Melbourne Health, the group that operates the Royal Melbourne Hospital.

==Lord Mayor of Melbourne==
When Lord Mayor of Melbourne John So announced his decision not to contest for a third consecutive term in early October 2008, Doyle emerged as a contender for the Lord Mayoralty in November 2008. Doyle told the media that he &quot;was a better than 50-50 chance of running&quot;. On 27 October Doyle announced his candidacy, saying he could leave partisan politics aside to work with the State Government if he became Lord Mayor. Doyle selected John So&#x27;s deputy between 2001 and 2004, Susan Riley, as his running mate.

On 30 November 2008, Doyle was elected Lord Mayor, defeating Councillor Catherine Ng in a tightly contested election. Doyle also defeated former Melbourne Deputy Lord Mayor and Spotless heir-apparent, Peter McMullin and So&#x27;s deputy between 2004 and 2008, Gary Singer.

Doyle&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, Robert Bennett, previously served as Lord Mayor (then known as simply Mayor) from 1861 to 1862 and Bennett Lane, of Bennetts Lane Jazz Bar fame in Melbourne is named after him.

On 27 October 2012, Doyle was re-elected as Lord Mayor, with an increased majority, defeating high-profile candidate, Gary Morgan and former Councillor and Lord Mayor Candidate, Catherine Ng.

On 11 November 2015, Doyle announced that he will run again for the office of Lord Mayor in the elections to be held in October 2016. Stating that it was the &quot;best job in the world&quot;
===Policies===

Many of Doyle&#x27;s policies have been around &#x27;activating&#x27; Melbourne as a night time city in conjunction with the Andrews&#x27; Government introduction of 24-hour public transport on weekends, extending hours of hospitality operation and continued support of 24-hour arts festivals.

In July 2016 Doyle announced that the homelessness problem in the Melbourne central business district had reached &quot;emergency&quot; levels. Citing a study conducted by the City of Melbourne that the number of homeless people had increased 74% in two years.

Doyle has been a vocal supporter of marriage equality, and has appeared regularly on LBGTI radio station Joy 94.9 as a prominent conservative politician.

Some of Doyle&#x27;s policies as Lord Mayor to make the CBD safer and more family friendly have caused mild controversy. Doyle made an election promise to return private vehicle traffic to Swanston Street, which had for several decades been open to limited but mostly pedestrian traffic. The move attracted opposition from the Public Transport Users Association, Greens and Bicycle Victoria. He also raised the idea of a theme park to attract children to the CBD. Doyle was also quick to vow to rid the Melbourne city centre of &quot;bogans&quot; and &quot;untalented&quot; buskers. Doyle has also openly criticised the state government&#x27;s handling of Melbourne Docklands, claiming that it lacks &#x27;social glue&#x27; and character and wanting more control over the precinct&#x27;s planning expressing the desire to see more open space in the form of a large park and also Venice style canals.

In September 2010, when asked on radio about a move by suburban councils to ban smoking in some outdoor areas due to the risks of passive smoking, he said &quot;I don&#x27;t know of a case of cancer that has been caused by passive smoking.&quot;

=== Tensions with China over Uighur film ===
In August 2009, Doyle came under pressure from the Chinese Government to intervene and stop the screening of &quot;The 10 Conditions of Love&quot; at the Melbourne International Film Festival. This Australian-made film is about a prominent Uighur woman Rebiya Kadeer, who China labels a &#x27;terrorist&#x27; and claims that she was the orchestrator of the July 2009 Ürümqi riots. Kadeer did attend the screening at the Melbourne Town Hall.

The Chinese Consul-General in Melbourne requested a meeting with the Lord Mayor to discuss the matter. Despite the protests from the Chinese Government, Doyle refused to intervene to stop the screening. Subsequently, reports emerged that China would consider terminating the sister-city relationship between Melbourne and Tianjin, one of China&#x27;s four municipal-level cities and the fifth most populous city in China.

Defying the Chinese Government&#x27;s threat, Doyle lodged a complaint to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, prompting the Department to warn the Chinese Embassy to conduct themselves appropriately.

===Occupy Melbourne Street protests inquiry===

Doyle was criticised for sending in riot police to evict protesters who had gathered in Melbourne&#x27;s City Square and had failed to comply with an eviction notice he had ordered to be issued to them, stating on ABC radio they were &quot;a self-righteous, narcissistic, self-indulgent rabble &quot;(that) &quot;tried to capture the city.&quot; This action resulted in a range of injuries to protesters. Reports on the number of injuries vary, and while Occupy Melbourne reported &quot;43 documented cases of police brutality&quot; in press releases, the official report from newspapers is just one protester who was sent to hospital after being trampled on by a police horse.

Calls for a public enquiry were turned down by the Lord Mayor who was firm that neither he or Victoria Police acted inappropriately. This led to Occupy Melbourne protesters pressing legal charges against Melbourne City Council for breaching federal law which prohibits the interference of a political protest.

Occupy Melbourne protesters then bombarded Robert Doyle with requests for an inquiry online during his 2012 election campaign, to which the Lord Mayor then closed his Facebook and Twitter accounts due to &quot;abuse and harassment&quot;. He later re-launched his online election campaign.

===Sexual harassment accusations===
On 15 December 2017, City of Melbourne councillor Tessa Sullivan, who was elected on the same ticket as Doyle, resigned from the council and lodged a complaint against Doyle with City of Melbourne chief executive, Ben Rimmer. In her complaint, Sullivan alleged that Doyle had sexually harassed and indecently assaulted her. On 17 December, Doyle released a statement on Twitter, which said he had not been informed of the details of the allegations. He announced he would take a month&#x27;s leave while an investigation was carried out, stressing that his standing aside &quot;must not be interpreted as any concession or admission&quot;.

On 4 February 2018, Doyle resigned as Lord Mayor of Melbourne, following reports the previous month that two other women had made separate accusations of sexual misconduct. The third complainant alleged that Doyle had &quot;touched her repeatedly under the table on her upper thigh and made offensive remarks to her at a medical awards ceremony held by Melbourne Health in June 2016&quot;. Doyle was reported to have &quot;vigorously denied all allegations&quot;.

In March 2021, an independent investigation commissioned by the Department of Health and conducted by Charles Scerri concluded that Doyle had committed &quot;serious misconduct of a sexual nature&quot;. Doyle refused to participate in the investigation on the grounds of ill health. However, in May 2021 he made a public apology in an interview with Neil Mitchell on 3AW.

=== Order of Australia ===
In 2017, Doyle was made a Companion of the Order of Australia for his contribution to community service. In 2023, the Governor-General terminated the appointment.

<doc id="894637" wikidata="Q5768935" url="?curid=894637" title="Hiraka District, Akita">
<text>was a rural district located in southern Akita, Japan. On 1 October 2005, its remaining components- the towns of Hiraka, Jūmonji, Masuda, Omonogawa, Ōmori; and the villages of Sannai and Taiyū- merged into the city of Yokote, upon which Hiraka District was dissolved and ceased to exist as an administrative unit.

==History==
The area of Hiraka Distinct was formerly part of Dewa Province, which was divided into the provinces of Ugo Province and Uzen Province following the Meiji restoration on 19 January 1869, with the area of Hiraka becoming part of Ugo Province. At the time, the area consisted of one town (Yokote) and 113 villages all of which were formerly under the control of Kubota Domain. Akita Prefecture was founded on 13 December 1871.

With the establishment of the municipality system on 1 April 1889, Hiraka District, with one town (Yokote) and 23 villages was established. Masuda and Asamai were raised to town status in 1895, followed by Kakumagawa in 1896, and Numadate and Ōmori in 1901 and Jūmonji in 1922. The city of Yokote was established on 1 April 1951, Numadate became Omonogawa in 1956, and Kakumagawa was merged into what later became the city of Daisen the same year. Asamai became Hiraka in 1956.

On 1 October 2005, the towns of Hiraka, Jūmonji, Masuda, Omonogawa, Ōmori, and the villages of Sannai, and Taiyū merged into the city of Yokote. Hiraka District was dissolved as a result.

<text>The AEG J.I was a German biplane ground attack aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft. It was a mission-specific derivative of the AEG C.IV reconnaissance aircraft.

The J.I was developed as an interim ground attack aircraft, being redesigned from the C.IV to feature armour plating and the more powerful Benz Bz IV piston engine. For engaging ground targets, a pair of 7.92 mm downward-facing (.312 in) LMG 08/15 machine guns were equipped. The aircraft&#x27;s design was kept as similar to the C.IV as possible to minimise development and production schedules; however, to offset that aircraft&#x27;s increased weight, it was necessary to add lower wingtip ailerons as well as to reinforce the shock absorbers. A key visual difference between the C.IV and J.I was the latter&#x27;s angular nose due to the armouring.

An improved model, the &quot;J.II&quot;, was produced in 1918 during the closing months of the war; it featured aerodynamic improvements and an extended fuselage. Around 609 aircraft, both J.Is and J.IIs, had been produced by the enactment of the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the conflict. The type saw limited use following the war. Multiple J.IIs served the first sustained daily passenger aeroplane service in the world, between the German cities of Berlin and Weimar, launched by Deutsche Luft-Reederei on 5 February 1919.

==Design and development==
During 1917, Germany undertook the formation and equipping of several Infanterie-Flieger units; military planners was decided that an interim aircraft would be needed for these units prior to the arrival of adequate numbers of purpose-built aircraft such as the Junkers J.I. The AEG J.I, being a relatively straightforward development of the AEG C.IV reconnaissance aircraft, could be hastily put into production and thus was deemed suitable for fulfilling this role. The principal changes between the C.IV and the J.I were the adoption of the more powerful Benz Bz IV in-line piston engine along with an armoured fuselage, the former helping to offset the additional 860 lb of weight of the latter.

In terms of its basic configuration, the J.I was a twin-seat single-engined tractor biplane. Equipped with a conventional landing gear with a tail skid, it had steel tube structure and was mainly covered with fabric. The armour plating, which extended from the aircraft&#x27;s nose to just aft of the rear cockpit, was roughly 5.1 mm thick; this armouring was not intended to function as structural elements, being instead fixed to various structural members. The J.I&#x27;s distinctive angular nose is a result of the armouring, which made little concession to shaping or aerodynamic refinement.

Both the pilot and gunner were seated in an open tandem cockpit that was protected with armour. The gunner was provisioned with three weapons, including a pair of 7.92 mm (.312 in) LMG 08/15 machine guns fitted to the floor of the cockpit for use against ground targets, and a single 7.92 mm (.312 in) Parabellum MG14 machine gun on a rotatable mounting to provide flexible defensive fire. Ammunition was belt-fed from a relatively large supply drum, while aiming was achieved via a rudimentary sight in the form of a circular hole in the forward-righthand side of the cockpit. Typically there was no forward-firing armament as the aircraft was intended to focus on strafing troops on the ground rather than engage in aerial combat; however, various non-standard armaments would often be fitted in the field.


While the prototype J.I had been equipped with an identical wing to that of the C.IV, it was determined that the greater weight of the aircraft necessitated greater lateral control; this was resolved with minimal redesign work to the overall wing via the addition of ailerons at the outer parts of the lower wing. Other modifications included the reinforcement of the shock absorbers to appropriately cope with the additional weight. Otherwise, conscious efforts were made to avoid unnecessary design changes from the C.IV.

During 1918, a refined version of the J.I, designated &quot;J.II&quot;, was developed. While this aircraft differed little in terms of structure from the J.I, it featured considerable changes in terms of its aerodynamics. All of the flight control surfaces, other than the lower ailerons, were redesigned; the incorporation of overhanging horn balances made the two models visually distinct from one another. Another visible change was the extension of the rear fuselage; other changes included the fitting of an enlarged fin to improve directional stability and a repositioned aileron link strut.

By the signing of the Armistice of 11 November 1918, roughly 609 aircraft, both J.Is and J.IIs, had been produced.

The type saw use for several years following the end of the conflict. Multiple J.IIs served the first sustained daily passenger aeroplane service in the world, between the German cities of Berlin and Weimar, flown by Deutsche Luft-Reederei. This route began on 5 February 1919. Early commercial J.IIs retained open cockpits, but modified versions with enclosed cabins for the two passengers were quickly produced and replaced them.

==Variants==
;AEG J.I
:An armoured version of the AEG C.IV fitted with downward pointing machine guns in the floor of the rear cockpit for ground strafing and a defensive hand-aimed machine-gun in the observers cockpit.
;AEG J.Ia
:The J.Ia version featured aileron controls on the lower wings, in addition to the upper.
;AEG J.II
:Structurally similar to the J.I, outfitted with ailerons aerodynamically balanced by large horn extensions at the wing-tips, increased fin area to improve directional stability and a re-located aileron link strut.

<text>Bourke Place is a skyscraper situated at 600 Bourke Street, Melbourne central business district, Victoria, Australia. As of 2024, it is the equal 18th tallest building in Melbourne and the 37th tallest building in Australia. It was completed in 1991.

Designed by the architectural firm Godfrey &amp; Spowers, it is a modernist building. It previously served as the headquarters for BHP, and the company&#x27;s sign on the outside of the structure was the highest in the country. BHP has since moved to a new building across the city to 171 Collins Street.

The building&#x27;s most obvious feature on the skyline is its sloped roof, which hides various communications equipment. The structure&#x27;s facade is of laminated glass.

In 2019 the building&#x27;s ground floor foyer has undergone refurbishment under the guidance of 3XN in collaboration with NH Architecture with construction work carried out by Probuild.

Bourke Place is home to numerous law firms, including King &amp; Wood Mallesons, which occupies the top eleven floors, HFW, Sparke Helmore Lawyers, Gadens, and Lander &amp; Rogers. Other tenants include M&amp;K Lawyers, Berkshire Hathaway, Scottish Pacific and Interpro.

<text>The Tata Indigo is a supermini produced by the Indian manufacturer Tata Motors produced from 2002 through 2016. It is the four-door saloon version of the Tata Indica, a supermini especially designed for developing countries.

In 2009, Tata released the second generation of the Indigo, called Tata Indigo Manza to distinguish it from the first generation which remained in production.

==First generation (2002–2018)==

The first generation of the Indigo, made by James Charles, which was launched in the Indian market in 2002, is based on the Tata Indica, a subcompact hatchback. The two cars shared a similar design, while the Indigo had a longer wheelbase, a 450 litre trunk, and turbo-diesel and petrol engine options. The car received its first design refresh in 2006, giving it distinguishing features from the Indica, such as more upmarket double-barreled headlamps, front fog-lamps, more upmarket interiors with fabric upholstery, etc.
The 2006 Tata Indigo went on to form the base platform for three other cars: the Indigo Marina station-wagon with a large boot and a ski-rack; the Indigo XL, a variant with a longer wheelbase for increased legroom in the second row, air-conditioner vents for the second row, and leather upholstery option; and the Indigo CS, a smaller version with a length of under 4 metres to take advantage of tax benefits for vehicles of that size. The latter was renamed Indigo eCS after an engine upgrade in 2010.

Tata Motors discontinued the Indigo and Indigo Marina in 2009 in favour of the Indigo Manza, a larger sedan based on the Tata X1 platform. The Indigo eCS remained in production, receiving a design refresh and the addition of ABS in 2013. The company also continued to sell the Indigo XL, although only as a variant tailored for use as a taxi, and sold only in bulk to fleet operators.

===Indigo Sedan (2002–2009)===
The first generation Tata Indigo was launched in 2002, and was largely based on the Indica. The two cars shared a majority of their parts. The Indigo had a greater wheelbase than the Indica, to accommodate the more acute-angled C-pillar and the trunk. The front bumper had housings for fog lamps, a feature which the Indica lacked at the time. While the Indica had a 1.4 L naturally aspired diesel engine, the Indigo featured its turbocharged variant, which produced . The car was also offered with a 1.2 L 4-cylinder MPFI petrol engine. The interior of the Indigo featured a few exclusives over the Indica, such as HVAC and fabric upholstery on all variants, and power windows for all doors on the top model. The steeper angle of the C-pillars meant that the Indigo lacked a rear windshield wiper. A minor design refresh in 2004 introduced a new 1.4 L turbocharged diesel engine.

In 2006, Tata Motors introduced the first major design update for the Indigo, with new body panels, a redesigned front grille housing double-barreled headlamps, triangular front fog-lamps, a multi-reflector tail-lamp cluster with dual brake lamps; a newer 3-spoke steering wheel, refreshed dual-tone fabric interiors, and an audio system with a CD player. Under the hood, it featured a new 1.4 L &quot;Dicor&quot; turbocharged common rail diesel engine, which produced and complied with the Bharat Stage III emission norms.

The 2006 Tata Indigo formed the base platform for three other cars, the Indigo Marina station-wagon, the Indigo XL sedan, and the Indigo CS compact-sedan.

===Indigo XL (2007–2009)===
Launched in 2007, the Indigo XL was a variant of the 2006 Indigo, with its wheelbase increased by 200 mm, and a few upmarket features. The added wheelbase translated into increased legroom in the second seating row and a bigger trunk. Tata Motors positioned it as a premium product and equipped it with a few upmarket features such as optional leather upholstery, rear air-conditioner vents, a rear center arm-rest with cup-holders, and a new 16-valve MPFI petrol engine option, with DOHC and a power output of . It retained the 1.4 L Dicor engine from the Indigo.

In 2009, with the introduction of the Indigo Manza based on its newer X1 platform, Tata Motors pulled the Indigo XL from consumer sales, and relegated it only to fleet sales as a taxi. The 2009 Indigo XL retained most of its feature-set from the 2007 original, with the exception of lack of leather upholstery and factory-fitted audio system. The car was offered in three engine variants, beginning with the 16-valve MPFI petrol engine carried over from the original, with a newer Bharat Stage IV-compliant catalytic converter, a dual-fuel CNG variant, which can switch on-the-fly between petrol and CNG, with a factory-fitted CNG kit; and the 1.4 L CR4 turbocharged common-rail diesel engine, also Bharat Stage-IV compliant, with a power output of .

===Indigo CS (2008–2016)===

The Indigo ECS (compact-sedan) was launched in 2008, as a crossover between a hatchback and a sedan, while technically being referred to as the latter. It was originally designed to appeal to buyers who sought an inexpensive &quot;3-box&quot; car at the price of a hatchback. At launch, the Indigo CS was the shortest sedan in the world, with a length of 3,998 mm. The car&#x27;s length allowed Tata Motors to avail excise-duty incentives targeted at cars with under 4 meters of length. The Indigo CS retained most of the feature-set of the 2007 Indigo. The car was launched with the 1.4 L TDI turbocharged diesel engine, and the 1.2 L 8-valve, 4-cylinder petrol engine carried over from the Indica Xeta. Both these engines complied with Bharat Stage-III emission norms.

In 2010, Tata Motors introduced the first design update to the Indigo CS, in the form of the company&#x27;s new 1.4 L CR4 turbocharged common-rail diesel engine, rechristening the car as Indigo eCS. The 1.4 L CR4 engine complies with the Bharat Stage-IV norms. Variants of the car, with the Bharat Stage-III compliant TDI engine continued to be sold till 2012. The 1.2 L SOHC petrol engine was carried over, with an upgraded Bharat Stage-IV compliant catalytic converter.

In 2012, Tata Motors introduced a high-end version of the car, the Indigo eCS VX, featuring anti-lock braking system (ABS) with electric brake-force distribution (EBD), electrically-adjustable outside rear-view mirrors (E-ORVMs), side repeaters mounted on the ORVMs, and 14-inch alloy wheels.

In 2013, the company introduced a more pronounced design refresh of the car, featuring redesigned body panels, chrome-inserts on the front-grille, trunk-lid, and front fog-lamp accents; smoked double-barreled headlamp housing, &quot;Sahara Beige&quot; fabric upholstery, dual-tone interiors with jet-black and beige tones, a newer 4-spoke steering wheel, and a 2-DIN audio system head-unit, with Bluetooth pairing for smartphones, for hands-free voice calls. The company also introduced variants with factory-fitted CNG kits, called the Indigo eCS e-Max. The car was discontinued in April 2016.

==Second generation (2009–2016)==

The Indigo Manza was launched on 14 October 2009. The variant is based on the Tata X1 platform which was displayed by Tata Motors in its prototype form called Elegante Concept during the 2007 Geneva Motor Show. It is priced between Rs 4.8 lakhs and Rs 6.75 lakhs. The launch coincided with the phasing out of the 2007 Tata Indigo, and the re-positioning of the Indigo XL as a fleet/taxi car. The Indigo Manza features a modern feature-set, including front SRS airbags, ABS with EBD; an audio system integrated into the dashboard, automatic climate control, leather upholstery, diamond-cut alloy-wheels, and a 500-litre trunk. The car is larger than the 2007 Indigo in all dimensions.
The car is powered by Bharat Stage-IV compliant engines sourced from Fiat. These include the 1.4 L Fiat &quot;FIRE&quot; petrol engine (re-branded as &quot;Safire&quot;), and the 1.3 L &quot;MultiJet&quot; common-rail diesel engine featuring a variable turbine turbocharger (re-branded as &quot;Quadrajet 90&quot;). Both engines have a power output rating of 90 HP.

In 2011, Tata Motors launched a high-end variant called the Tata Manza Elan. This car offered Italian leather upholstery, and reversing parking sensors. Around the same time, Tata Motors released a new version of the Indica Vista (which until the time, although based on the same X1 platform, featured significantly different body panels and lamp clusters). The 2011 Indica Vista &quot;Sedan-class&quot; featured mostly identical front-side body paneling, grille, and headlamp clusters to the Indigo Manza, although under the hood, it featured a variant of the 1.3 L Multijet diesel engine.

In 2012, Tata Motors launched a design refresh across all variants, called the Tata Manza &quot;Club-class.&quot; It offered 2-tone body colours (with the roof colour contrasting the rest of the body), updated exterior chrome inserts, 16-spoke alloy wheels, newer 2-tone &quot;Sahara Beige&quot; or &quot;Black Plum&quot; interiors with black Italian leather upholstery on the high-end EXL variant; a chrome-insert interior package, leather-wrapped gear lever, and a Blaupunkt-sourced infotainment system, with a 6-inch true-colour touchscreen, GPS satellite navigation software sourced from MapMyIndia, and DVD video playback (usable only when the car is stationary).

<doc id="894674" wikidata="Q1129668" url="?curid=894674" title="Set Fire to Flames">
<text>Set Fire to Flames was a Canadian instrumental music ensemble consisting of 13 musicians from Montreal, Quebec. The band was often considered a side project of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, as the two groups shared several members.

==History==
Set Fire to Flames was initiated by David Bryant. The group released two albums on Alien8 Recordings and FatCat Records, on their own imprint, 130701, which was set up in 2001. The first album, &quot;Sings Reign Rebuilder&quot;. was released in October that year. 

The ensemble&#x27;s second album, &quot;Telegraphs in Negative/Mouths Trapped in Static&quot;, followed in 2003. It was recorded in a barn in rural Ontario; the sounds of the creaking doors and other background noises are heard behind the songs.

Both albums contain brooding, eerie music. Many of the tracks are minimalist, filled with ambient noise and various other non-musical sound effects, juxtaposed or combined with instrumental music. Both album cover images display the work of photographer Michael Ackerman. 

A third album was recorded in collaboration with the band Jackie-O Motherfucker but never released. In 2009, a composition from the band&#x27;s first album was included on a compilation album released by 130701. In 2016, a previously unreleased track was issued on 130701&#x27;s 15th-anniversary compilation &quot;Eleven Into Fifteen&quot;.

<doc id="894677" wikidata="Q468405" url="?curid=894677" title="Lateran">
<text>Lateran and Laterano are names for an area of Rome, and the shared names of several buildings in Rome. The properties were once owned by the Lateranus family of the Roman Empire. The Laterani lost their properties to Emperor Constantine who allegedly gave them to the Bishop of Rome though this traditional report has been most likely based on the document Donation of Constantine which has been proven to be a forgery.

The most famous Lateran buildings are the Lateran Palace, once called the Palace of the Popes, and the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, the cathedral of Rome, which while in Rome, and not in the Vatican, are properties of the Holy See, and have extraterritorial privileges as a result of the 1929 Lateran Treaty with Italy. As the official ecclesiastical seat of the pope, Saint John Lateran contains the papal &quot;cathedra&quot;. The Lateran is Christendom&#x27;s earliest basilica.

Attached to the basilica is the Lateran Baptistery, one of the oldest in Christendom. Other constituent parts of the Lateran complex are the building of the Scala Sancta with the Sancta Sanctorum and the Triclinium of Pope Leo III.

Another basilica in the neighborhood is San Clemente al Laterano.

The Pontifical Lateran University, or simply Lateranum, is one of the pontifical universities of Rome. An ecclesiastical college in the Philippines was named after the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, the Colegio de San Juan de Letran, founded in 1620.

==History==
The Lateran buildings played an important role in Catholic Church history. It (specifically the Lateran Palace) being the place where the First Council of the Lateran 1123, Second Council of the Lateran 1193, Third Council of the Lateran 1179, Fourth Council of the Lateran 1213, Fifth Council of the Lateran 1512-17. 

# The First Council of the Lateran (1123) followed and confirmed the concordat of Worms.
# The Second Council of the Lateran (1139) declared clerical marriages invalid, regulated clerical dress, and punished attacks on clerics by excommunication.
# The Third Council of the Lateran (1179) limited papal electors to the cardinals alone, condemned simony, and forbade the promotion of anyone to the episcopate before the age of thirty.
# The Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215) dealt with transubstantiation, papal primacy, and conduct of clergy. It said Jews and Muslims should wear a special dress to distinguish them from Christians.
# The Fifth Council of the Lateran (1512–1517) attempted reform of the church, including to make peace with Christian lands. 
It also held non-ecumenical synods which are: 

# The Lateran Council of 649, organized by Maximus the Confessor, and called by Pope Theodore I to condemn the heresy of Monothelitism in the Church of the west. 
# The Lateran Council (769), called by Pope Stephen III to approve icon veneration in the East and thus condemn the heresy of Iconoclasm, deposed Antipope Constantine II, and increased cardinals rights in the Western Church.
# The Lateran Council (964), was called to depose Pope Benedict V.

The Lateran is also where the Lateran Treaty was signed in 1929 establishing Vatican City as an independent state. It was signed by Benito Mussolini, and Papal diplomat Pietro Gasparri.

<text>The Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) is a class of air-cushioned landing craft (hovercraft) used by the United States Navy and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). They transport weapons systems, equipment, cargo and personnel from ship to shore and across the beach. It is to be replaced in US service by the Ship-to-Shore Connector (SSC).

==Design and development==
Two prototypes were built; JEFF A by Aerojet General in California, JEFF B by Bell Aerospace.

JEFF A had four rotating ducted propellers JEFF B had two ducted rear propellers similar to the proposed SK-10 which was derived from the previous Bell SK-5 / SR.N5 hovercraft tested in Vietnam. JEFF B was selected for the LCAC. JEFF A was later modified for Arctic use and deployed in Prudhoe Bay to support offshore oil drilling.

The first 33 were included in the FY82-86 defense budgets, 15 in FY89, 12 each in FY90, FY91 and FY92, while seven were included in FY93. The first LCAC was delivered to the Navy in 1984 and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was achieved in 1986. Approval for full production was granted in 1987.

After an initial 15-craft competitive production contract was awarded to each of two companies, Textron Marine &amp; Land Systems (TMLS) of New Orleans, La, and Avondale Gulfport Marine, TMLS was selected to build the remaining craft. The final craft was delivered in 2001.

On 29 June 1987, approval was granted for full LCAC production. Forty-eight air-cushion landing craft were authorized and appropriated through FY 89. Lockheed Shipbuilding Company was competitively selected as a second source. The FY 1990 budget request included $219.3 million for nine craft. The FY 1991 request included full funding for 12 LCACs and advance procurement in support of the FY 1992 program (which was intended to be nine craft). The remaining 24 were funded in FY92.

==Operations and Craft Crew==
The LCAC first deployed in 1987 aboard . LCACs are transported in and operate from all the U.S. Navy&#x27;s amphibious-well deck ships including LHA, LHD, LSD and LPD. Ships capable of carrying the LCAC include the (3 LCACs), (1), (4–5), (2), and (2) classes.

All of the planned 91 craft were delivered. Seventeen have since been disassembled or terminated for cost reasons, two are held for R&amp;D, and 36 are in use on each coast at Little Creek, Virginia and Camp Pendleton, California. Eight minesweeping kits were acquired in 1994–1995. A service-life extension program (SLEP) to extend service life from 20 to 30 years for the remaining 72 active LCACs was begun in 2000 and was scheduled to be completed by 2018.

The craft operates with a crew of five enlisted Sailors. Crew positions and responsibilities are as follows: Craft Master, Navigator, Craft Engineer, Deck Engineer, and Load Master. The Craft Master is over all in charge of piloting the craft, crew coordination, crew safety, craft safety, and has the ability to terminate a mission if weather or craft conditions have degraded past the point of mission accomplishment. The Craft Engineer is responsible for power plant monitoring, is cross trained as a secondary Craft Master in the case that the actual Craft Master becomes incapacitated, is the overall subject matter expert on craft mechanical and electrical systems, and leads/advises all in flight and in mission repairs. The Navigator is over all in charge of plotting safe lanes of travel, making in flight path of travel changes as needed, ensuring on time beach landings, logging weight of equipment moved, and communications with other craft and ground forces. The Deck Engineer is over all in charge of completing in flight and in mission repairs to the craft as needed, cross trains as a Craft Engineer in the case the Craft Engineer becomes incapacitated, leads on deck firefighting evolutions, and aids the Load Master in on-load and off-load of cargo and troops. The Load Master is overall in charge of all deck evolutions, movement of equipment, cargo, and troops during on loading and off-loading evolutions, proper loading of cargo on deck to ensure proper weight and balance of the craft is maintained and craft is level while on cushion, anchoring, mooring, and rigging for tow operations, ensuring proper restraints are used to secure cargo or calculate restrain requitements for unique or mission specific non-standard equipment, maintenance of craft armament, craft armorer, distribution of weapons and ammunition on command of the Craft Master, and acts as the port look out while in flight.

In addition to beach landings, LCAC provides personnel transport, evacuation support, lane breaching, mine countermeasure operations, casualty transport, and Marine and Special Warfare equipment delivery. The four main engines are all used for lift and all used for main propulsion while two smaller auxiliary generator engines, Auxiliary Power Units (APU), provide craft electrical power.. The craft can continue to operate, at reduced capability, with two engines inoperable, one lift fan inoperable, and one APU inoperable. Main engines are interchangeable for redundancy and ease of maintenance. A Personnel Transport Model (PTM) can be assembled on the cargo deck of the craft. They can seat 180 troops, 120 combat loaded troops, and can additionally be converted to transport 54 casualties for medical treatment.

The LCAC&#x27;s cargo capacity is , slightly less if cold weather kit is installed for winter and Arctic operations. The LCAC is capable of carrying a 60 short-ton payload (up to 75 tons in an overload condition), including one M-1 Abrams tank, at speeds over 40 knots. Fuel capacity is 5000 gallons. The LCAC uses an average of 1000 gallons per hour.

Maneuvering considerations include requiring 500 yards or more to stop and 2000 yards or more turning radius. The bow ramp is wide while the stern ramp is wide. Noise and dust levels are high with this craft. If disabled the craft is difficult to tow. In recent years spray suppression has been added to the craft&#x27;s skirt to reduce interference with driver&#x27;s vision.

===SLEP===

In Fiscal Year 2000 the Navy started an LCAC Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) to add 10 years of design life to each craft. The SLEP will be applied to 72 LCACs, extending their service life from 20 to 30 years.

Phase I. Replacing electronics components with readily available commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. The new electronics suite will be more reliable and less costly to operate and maintain.

Phase II. Buoyancy box replacement at the Textron Marine and Land Systems facility in New Orleans, LA, to increase the LCACs resistance to corrosion. Phase II will also include the electronics upgrade of Phase I, until the entire active fleet is outfitted with the new configuration. The new buoyancy box will incorporate improvements to damage stability and trim control of the LCACs.

NAVSEA transitioned from the research and development effort to the SLEP in 1999. Concurrently NAVSEA also considered additional SLEP options, including an enhanced engine to provide improved operation in excessively hot environments and an advanced skirt that is more reliable and cost effective.

The Navy continued the LCAC Service Life Extension Program in Fiscal Year 2001. This program combines major structural improvements with Command, Control, Communications, Computer and Navigation upgrades and adds 10 years to the service life, extending it to 30 years. In FY 2001, it was funded at $19.9 million and extended the service life of 1 craft. The SLEP is planned for a total of 72 craft.

The near-term focus will be on the &quot;C4N&quot; [Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Navigation] program, to replace the crafts&#x27; obsolete equipment. This will focus on replacement of LN-66 radars with modern, high-power P-80 radar systems. Additionally, the SLEP will include an open-architecture concept, relying on modern commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment, which will allow much easier incorporation of later technology changes, such as the precision navigation system and communications systems ¾ fully interoperable with in-service and near-term future Joint systems ¾ now planned. The C4N program is to complete by 2010.

Through 2016, the Navy will look to incorporate other important service-life enhancements: Engine upgrades (ETF-40B configuration) that will provide additional power and lift particularly in hot (, and higher) environments, reduced fuel consumption, reduced maintenance needs, and reduced lift footprint; Replacement of the buoyancy box to solve corrosion problems, incorporate hull improvements, and &quot;reset&quot; the fatigue-limit &quot;clock&quot;; Incorporation of a new (deep) skirt that will reduce drag, increase performance envelope over water and land, and reduce maintenance requirements.

As of September 2012, there were 80 LCACs in the U.S. Navy inventory; 39 LCACs had undergone the SLEP conversion and 7 were in progress and 4 are awaiting induction. The FY 2013 budget authorized 4 SLEP conversions per year through FY 2018. The last of the 72 SLEP conversions will be delivered to the Navy in FY 2020. After the first SLEP LCAC reached its 30 years design service age in 2015, it was to gradually be retired. In 2019, at which point the inventory of LCACs had fallen to 50, the USN began receiving the new Ship-to-Shore Connector (SSC), the LCAC-100.

The USN inventory of LCACs was projected to fall until 2023 after which SSC replacements would increase it.

==Japanese operations==
Six LCAC are in use by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. Approval for the sale was given by the United States Government on 8 April 1994. The craft were built by Textron Marine &amp; Land Systems in New Orleans, Louisiana. Purchase of the first craft was included in the FY93 budget, second in FY95, third and fourth in FY99 and fifth and sixth in FY00.

==Operators==
** Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (6 units)
** United States Navy (74 units).
***Assault Craft Unit 4
***Assault Craft Unit 5
***Naval Beach Unit 7 (Sasebo, Japan)

<text>Sudbury East was a provincial electoral riding in the Canadian province of Ontario, that was represented in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1967 to 1999. It served the easternmost portion of the former city of Sudbury, the eastern portion of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury, and several rural communities to the east and southeast of the city. The riding only existed in provincial elections — for federal elections, most of Sudbury East was part of either Nickel Belt or Timiskaming—French River.

In 1999, the provincial government realigned its ridings to match the federal riding boundaries, and Sudbury East was amalgamated into the provincial Nickel Belt district. Shelley Martel, the incumbent MPP for Sudbury East prior to the 1999 election, continued to represent the region for another eight years as the MPP for Nickel Belt.

==Members of Provincial Parliament==




==Other usages==
The name Sudbury East is still used to refer collectively to the municipalities east and southeast of the city which were formerly part of the riding but are &quot;not&quot; part of the current city of Greater Sudbury, including Markstay-Warren, St. Charles and French River. These towns, as well as the adjacent municipality of Killarney and the unorganized townships of Burwash, Cox, Davis, Hawley, Hendrie, Henry, Janes, Laura, Loughrin, Secord, Servos, Street and Waldie, coordinate economic development and planning through the cooperative Sudbury East Planning Board.

In unofficial usage, the designation may also be extended to include the municipality of West Nipissing, particularly the community of Sturgeon Falls, although West Nipissing is not officially part of the Sudbury East area.

<text>Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, OP, also known as Mother Mary Alphonsa (May 20, 1851 – July 9, 1926), was an American Dominican religious sister, writer, social worker, and foundress of the Dominican Sisters of Hawthorne.

==Early life and education==
Rose Hawthorne was born on May 20, 1851, in Lenox, Massachusetts, to Nathaniel Hawthorne and his wife Sophia Peabody. Sophia was assisted in the birth by her father, Nathaniel Peabody. Hawthorne wrote about the infant Rose to his friend, Horatio Bridge, comparing her birth to the publication of a book: &quot;Mrs. Hawthorne published a little work, two months ago, which still lies in sheets; but, I assure you, it makes some noise in the world, both by day and night. In plain English, we have another little red-headed daughter—a very bright, strong, and healthy imp, but, at present, with no pretentions to beauty.&quot; Rose Hawthorne and her siblings were raised in a positive environment and their parents did not believe in harsh discipline or physical punishment.

On July 28, 1851, Sophia took Hawthorne and her older sister, Una, to visit relatives in West Newton, Massachusetts. Growing up, Rose lived in Massachusetts, Liverpool, London, Paris, Rome, and Florence. The family returned to Concord, Massachusetts, in 1860. There, her older brother Julian was enrolled in a co-educational school run by Franklin Benjamin Sanborn. Though their friend, the poet Ellery Channing, recommended the Hawthorne girls attend the same school, neither was enrolled. Sophia wrote: &quot;We entirely disapprove of this commingling of youths and maidens at the electric age in school. I find no end of ill effect from it, and this is why I do not send Una and Rose to your school.&quot; Two years after Nathaniel&#x27;s death in 1864, Hawthorne was enrolled at a boarding school run by Diocletian Lewis in nearby Lexington, Massachusetts; she disliked the experience.

After Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s death, the family moved to Germany and then to England. Sophia and Una died there in 1871 and 1877, respectively.

==Marriage==
Rose married author George Parsons Lathrop in 1871. Prior to the marriage, George had shown romantic interest in Hawthorne&#x27;s sister Una. Their brother Julian Hawthorne used the love triangle as an inspiration for his first novel, &quot;Bressant&quot;, in 1873. In 1876, the Lathrops had a son, Francis. Rose Hawthorne tried to become an author in her own right, much like her husband, father, and brother. She serialized her novel &quot;Miss Dilletante&quot; in the Boston &quot;Courier&quot; under George&#x27;s editorship in 1878 and published a book of poems, &quot;Along the Shore&quot;, in 1888.

In the spring of 1879, Rose and her husband purchased her family&#x27;s former home in Concord, The Wayside, with borrowed funds, where they lived until their son Francis died of diphtheria at the age of five in 1881. They returned to New York City but moved to New London, Connecticut, in 1887 for George&#x27;s health. Following Francis&#x27; death George had become an alcoholic and was increasingly unstable. Una suspected he abused Rose. George also competed with Hawthorne&#x27;s brother Julian for control of Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s legacy. In 1883, Julian planned to publish &quot;Dr. Grimshawe&#x27;s Secret&quot;, a manuscript left unfinished by their father, but Rose did not believe in its existence and suspected him of forgery or perpetrating a hoax.

In New London, the Lathrops became involved with the Catholic summer school movement and collaborated on a book, &quot;A Story of Courage: A History of the Georgetown Visitation Convent&quot;. Both Hawthorne and Lathrop converted to Roman Catholicism in 1891. Though &quot;To many of their old friends this conversion came as a shock&quot;, Hawthorne&#x27;s journey to Catholicism had been years in the making.

Their travels through England, Portugal, France and Italy [had] exposed the Hawthornes to the &#x27;Roman Church,&#x27; often misunderstood in the Protestant circles of New England … Hawthorne would write of her experience at the age of seven of seeing Pope Pius IX during Holy Week from his balcony: &quot;I became eloquent about the Pope, and was rewarded by a gift from my mother of a little medallion of him and a gold scudo with an excellent likeness thereon, both always tenderly reverenced by me.&quot;

Nevertheless, the Lathrops&#x27; marriage continued to suffer and they separated permanently in 1896. George died of cirrhosis three years later.

==Career==

Hawthorne sought greater purpose in her life and spent time with the Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts, becoming inspired by their motto, &quot;I am for God and for the poor.&quot; She was further inspired by her relationship with Emma Lazarus, whom she befriended in 1881. After Lazarus&#x27;s death from cancer at age 38, Hawthorne recalled that she was at least comfortable, unlike others who were poor. She wrote later, &quot;Though I grieved deeply for her, I would not pity her, for she never knew unaided suffering, but every amelioration.&quot; As a source for her motivation to work with incurable impoverished people, she cited the story of a young seamstress who was too poor to afford medical treatment and instead had herself admitted to an institution for the insane on Blackwell&#x27;s Island.

In the summer of 1896, Hawthorne trained as a nurse at the New York Cancer Hospital, the first institution in the United States to provide training in treating cancer at a time when general hospitals in the city did not admit patients with cancer. Later that year, she founded a charitable organization named after Rose of Lima, Sister Rose&#x27;s Free Home, to care for impoverished cancer patients. At first, she visited patients at their homes. In October 1896, she rented three rooms in a tenement on Scammel Street on the Lower East Side, a poor immigrant neighborhood, with the help of an assistant named Alice Huber. A Dominican priest, Clement Thuente, witnessed their work in February 1899 and encouraged them to join the Dominican order as tertiaries.

On December 8, 1900, Hawthorne founded a new religious congregation, with the approval of Archbishop Michael A. Corrigan of New York. The congregation was named the Servants of Relief for Incurable Cancer; she became its first Mother Superior, with the name Mother Mary Alphonsa. Alice became known as Mother Rose. The congregation — now known as the Dominican Sisters of Hawthorne — opened a facility called St. Rose&#x27;s Home on Water Street in Manhattan; it then moved to Cherry Street, before settling north of New York City in what is now Rosary Hill Home in Hawthorne.

Hawthorne&#x27;s brother, Julian, considered her decision to be a martyrdom, writing, &quot;Nothing less than the extreme would satisfy her thirst for self-sacrifice.&quot; When he was imprisoned for mail fraud, she traveled to Washington, D.C., on April 3, 1913, to ask President Woodrow Wilson to pardon him. Julian was angered by her intervention, and no pardon was granted.

==Death and legacy==
On July 8, 1926, Hawthorne wrote various letters asking for donations until nearly 10 o&#x27;clock before going to bed. She died in her sleep on July 9, the day that would have been her parents&#x27; 84th wedding anniversary. She was buried on the grounds of the motherhouse of the Dominican Sisters in Hawthorne, N.Y.

Hawthorne received a medal from the National Institute of Social Sciences for &quot;notable achievement&quot; in 1914. In 1925, she was awarded an honorary Master of Arts from Bowdoin College. On April 18, 1926, the Rotary Club of New York presented her with a service medal as &quot;soldier of love, a friend of the poor, organizer of rare ability, hope of the hopeless&quot;.

The Rose Hawthorne Guild was established to promote her cause for canonization. In 2003, Cardinal Edward Egan, Archbishop of the Archdiocese of New York, approved the movement for Hawthorne&#x27;s canonization. On March 14, 2024, Pope Francis, recognized Hawthorne&#x27;s life of heroic virtue and declared her Venerable, the final step before Beatification, which would require a miracle to take place through the intercession of Hawthorne.

<text>Jilin City is the second-largest city and former capital of Jilin province in northeast China. As of the 2020 census, 3,623,713 people resided within its administrative area of and 1,895,865 in its built-up (&quot;or metro&quot;) area consisting of four urban districts. A prefecture-level city, it is the only major city nationally that shares its name with its province.

Jilin City is also known as the &quot;River City&quot; because of the Songhua River surrounding much of the city. In 2007, it co-hosted the Asian Winter Games.

== History ==
Jilin City is one of the oldest cities in Northeast China.

During the reign of the Yongle Emperor in the Ming dynasty, efforts were made to expand Ming control throughout all of Manchuria. Mighty river fleets were built and sailed several times from Jilin City, getting the chieftains of the local tribes to swear allegiance to the Ming rulers. 
Soon after the establishment of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty, the territory of today&#x27;s Primorsky Kray was put under the administration of Jilin. As the Russian Empire advanced eastward to the Pacific coast, the Qing government ordered a naval shipbuilding factory to be set up here in 1661. Jilin was officially established as a fort city in 1673 when Anzhuhu (), the Deputy Lieutenant-General (), was ordered to build a castle in Jilin. In 1676, the Military Governor of Ninguta was transferred to Jilin City because of its more convenient location and increasing military importance, while the former Deputy Lieutenant-General was transferred in the opposite direction to Ninguta. Since then Jilin City has developed at a rapid pace. The nickname of Jilin City is &quot;River City&quot; (), which originates from one sentence &quot;&quot; of a poem written by Kangxi Emperor when he was visiting Jilin City in 1682. Jilin retained its importance into the 18th and 19th century as one of the few cities existing beyond the Willow Palisade, along with Qiqihar, Ninguta and Mukden.

After Manchukuo established their capital in Xinjing (present-day Changchun), Jilin City&#x27;s importance decreased. By 1940, Jilin&#x27;s population was 173,624, while Xinjing&#x27;s population reached 544,202 at the same time. Soviet forces captured Jilin during the August Storm operation.

Jilin became the provincial capital of Jilin Province after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, until Changchun took this position in 1956.

==Geography==
Jilin City, which is located in central Jilin Province spanning from 125° 40&#x27; to 127° 56&#x27; E longitude and 42° 31&#x27; to 44° 40&#x27; N latitude. Neighbouring prefectures are:
*Harbin, Heilongjiang (N)
*Changchun (W)
*Siping (W)
*Yanbian (E)
*Liaoyuan (S)
*Tonghua (S)
*Baishan (S)
Jilin City is situated in a hilly area near the Songhua River. There are four famous mountains surrounding Jilin City, which is North Mountain in the west, Long Tan Mountain in the east, Zhuque Mountain in the North, and Turtle Mountain in the south, plus Songhua River, it forms a bagua in Taiji pattern.
North Mountain, called Beishan, is the most famous mountain in Jilin City and is home to several Buddhist Temples. The Qianlong Emperor reportedly visited the mountain.

===Climate===

Jilin City has a four-season, monsoon-influenced, humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;). Winters are long (lasting from November to March), cold, and windy, but dry, due to the influence of the Siberian anticyclone, with a January mean temperature of . Spring and autumn are somewhat short transitional periods, with some precipitation, but are usually dry and windy. Summers are hot and humid, with a prevailing southeasterly wind due to the East Asian monsoon; July averages . Snow is usually light during the winter, and annual rainfall is heavily concentrated from June to August.

===Environmental issues===

====2005 Jilin benzene pollution====

The Jilin chemical plant explosions were a series of explosions which occurred on November 13, 2005, in the No.101 Petrochemical Plant in Jilin City, killing six. The explosion severely polluted the Songhua River, with an estimated 100 tons of pollutants containing benzene and nitrobenzene entering into the river. The benzene level recorded was at one point 108 times above national safety levels. This caused downstream major cities including Harbin, Songyuan and Khabarovsk suspending their water supply for almost one week. Chinese leaders later had to apologize to the Russian government over its handling of the incident as the pollutants finally flowed into the Amur (Heilong) River, the major boundary river between China and Russia.

====2010 Jilin floods and pollution====
Jilin was one of the worst-hit regions in China by rain and landslides in the 2010 summer China floods. On July 28, 2010, several thousand barrels, which contained toxic chemicals including trimethylsilyl chloride and hexamethyldisiloxane, about of a poisonous substance in each, were washed into the Songhua River by the floods from two chemical plants based in Jilin. There were reports that some barrels exploded on contact with water. By late afternoon on August 1, 6,387 barrels had been retrieved from the river. Officials stated that tests show the water in the river remains safe to drink. Three soldiers of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army in Jilin drowned after working to remove the barrels and control the flooding. The Dahe Dam in Changshan Township was breached on July 28, spilling 4 million m3 of water, destroying five villages downstream and leaving 40 people dead or missing. Over 100 were dead or missing after floods devastated Jilin prefecture. Workers started repairing fifty-one damaged small reservoirs and fortifying riverbanks in the province after the Songhua River surged to levels twice as high as normal.

==Administrative divisions==
==Tourism==

Jilin City is a popular destination for tourists to come each winter to view the magnificent rime ice () on trees along the banks of the Songhua River, (the river is the only river in the region that does not freeze in winter). The rime ice is a natural phenomenon that occurs every year during January and February. It is a result of water vapor rising up from the warm Songhua River to meet the cold night air, causing the crystallisation of water vapour on willows branches.

Attractions:
* Meteorite Museum (largest stony meteorite of a documented meteorite fall)
* North Hill (Beishan in Chinese) Park (north-west of Jilin)
* Dragon Pool Mountain Park
* Songhua Lake (south-east of Jilin)
* Wulajie (; formerly also transcribed as Wulakai) Old City (), a Qing dynasty walled town in Longtan District, on the east bank of the Sungari River downstream from Jilin&#x27;s main urban area. The place was the center for collection of local products to the imperial court during the Qing dynasty. In 1682—when, according to Ferdinand Verbiest, Wulajie (Ula) was &quot;the most illustrious city of the whole province&quot;—the Kangxi Emperor himself visited the place to enjoy sturgeon fishing. These days, a public school nearby is one of the few schools in the country where some Manchu is taught.

<text>Kokstad is a town in the Harry Gwala District Municipality of KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Kokstad is named after the Griqua chief Adam Kok III who settled here in 1863. Kokstad is the capital town of the East Griqualand region, as it is also the biggest town in this region. It was built around Mount Currie, a local mountain range, by the town’s founder Adam Kok III, for whom the town is named. &quot;Stad&quot; is the Dutch and Afrikaans word for &quot;city&quot;.

The town is built on the outer slopes of the Drakensberg and is 1,302 m above sea level. Behind it Mount Currie rises to a height of 2,224 m.

It is a centre for cheese and other dairy products.

Kokstad has the N2 Highway south of the town&#x27;s CBD. The R56 leads from Kokstad to Cedarville (45 km), Matatiele (68 km) and Maluti leading to the border of Lesotho. The R617 is also a bisecting route leading from Kokstad to Underberg (109 km), Swartberg (41 km) and Bulwer (147 km).

The N2, the national route, leads from Kokstad to the east to Port Shepstone (175 km), Durban (380 km) and to the south Mount Ayliff (57 km), Mthatha (180 km), East London (419 km) and Qonce (447 km).

Kokstad is 10 km from the Eastern Cape border on the N2.

The majority of residents can speak IsiXhosa as well as IsiZulu.

Kokstad has no rural villages to date. It is a farming community with majority of its countryside land being cattle farms or residential farms.

== History ==
In 1820 the Griqua tribe which lived in Griquatown (in central South Africa) split and under the leadership of Adam Kok III, descendant of the former cook who established the tribe, one section first moved to Philippolis (southern Free State). In 1861 several hundred Griquas moved across the Drakensberg down the Ongeluks Nek to the vicinity of modern Kokstad. They moved because of the growing confrontation they faced with the Voortrekkers who had moved north of the Orange River to escape the laws of the British. The Voortrekkers, largely Dutch, secured leases over Griqua land and then refused to return the land at the end of the lease. The Big Hole of Kimberley was at the centre of controversy over one such lease.

The Griquas were forced to travel over the Drakensberg into a region earlier devastated by the great Zulu King, Shaka—thus its name &quot;Nomansland&quot;. By the time the Griquas arrived in their new promised land eighteen months later they were exhausted and most of their livestock had perished. The impoverished Griquas named the mountain where they settled Mount Currie after Sir Walter Currie who gave support to their effort to settle here. Once settled their leader, Adam Kok, renamed their new land East Griqualand. Every male Griqua who settled in East Griqualand was able to secure a farm, but most of them sold their land cheaply to white settlers and squandered their money. The Rev William Dower in his 1902 book &quot;The Early Annals of Kokstad&quot; describes in great detail how cheaply the Griqua gave their farms away.

When, in 1869, the Reverend William Dower was asked by the Griqua to establish a mission, he agreed on condition that they resettle in a more suitable place on the banks of the Mzimhlava river.

Two prominent European settlers George Brisley and Donald Strachan played a major role in the early development of Kokstad and East Griqualand: their trading store, Strachan and Co, in 1874 introduced South Africa&#x27;s first indigenous currency—a set of trade tokens which circulated across a wide region, covering an area the size of Ireland.

Confirmation that the Strachan and Co coins circulated as money in the region at this time comes from the local Standard Bank at Kokstad and the managing director of Strachan and Co.

In 1878 East Griqualand came into the possession of Cape Colony. The first hotel in Kokstad, The Royal, was opened by an African-American who also started a newspaper (the &quot;Kokstad Advertiser&quot;) in 1881. Kokstad became a municipality in 1892. In 1904 the population was recorded at 2903 whom a third were Griquas. The town was transferred to Natal province in 1978. Today the population of Kokstad lies at just over 50,000 people.

==Cultural assets==
Stemming from a relatively old farming community, Kokstad rose from the lands beneath Mount Currie. Many old buildings and monuments have been erected that are now considered to be National Heritage Sites.

* The Adam Kok Monument (Griqua): The monument commemorates the leadership of the Griqua, Adam Kok, who, after leading the Griquas from the Southern Free State to Griqualand East during the 1860s, died after a fall off a cart in 1875. The monument is situated next to the police station of Kokstad.
* Kokstad Bandstand (British Colonial): The ornamental, cast iron bandstand dates from 1912. It was donated to the town council by the engineers who were responsible for the Kokstad water scheme. It was declared a national monument in October 1983.
* Boy Scouts Monument (British Monument): The monument to former Boy Scouts who fell in the world wars is situated in the foothills of Mount Currie North of Kokstad.
* Cape Mounted Rifles Monument (British Colonial): The monumen is a tall column surrounded by four lions peering upwards. It is situated close to the town hall.
* St. Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church (Cathedral)
* East Griqualand Museum and Community Tourism Info Center: Griqua history is the main theme of this museum&#x27;s display. Although it has several other local history exhibits and items also known as the Kokstad museum.
* Old town hall (historical building): The old town hall is considered a National Monument Site. It is one of the largest town structures that predates World War I within the surrounding areas. Currently used for ceremonial practices, it also functioned as the town&#x27;s library for many years until 2005, when the new library on the neighbouring plot was opened. The town hall is now used for many municipal and political functions, as well as public gatherings ranging from weddings to sporting ceremonies.

==Attractions==
The area is popular for its many rivers and dams that provide ample opportunity for trout fishing and hiking possibilities. There are three reserves, Mount Currie, Wilfred Bauer and the Mountain Lake Nature Reserve. These have camping and picnic spots. Among these reserves, the Mountain Lake Nature Reserve contains paths that provide sightseeing walks, as well as over 220 species of birds. The Mount Currie reserve is filled with history. On the site stands a historic laager site surrounded by graves of early pioneers and a monument pays homage to Boy Scouts who died during the First World War in East Africa.

The area&#x27;s many dams provide multiple forms of use. Crystal Springs Dam provides many boating and angling opportunities. The dam is fed by the pure water of Crystal Springs, the main source of Kokstad&#x27;s water supply. In 1924, William Mortimer Mail (b. 16 November 1885) was to take-up an appointment as the Kokstad Town Engineer, Arguably, Mail&#x27;s most notable achievement was improvement to Kokstad&#x27;s drinking water, which at the time of his arrival, was drawn from a mountain stream. Whenever it rained, it became heavily stained. After identifying a suitable spring further down the mountain (Crystal Springs), he first conducted a series of water flow rate metering, to establish there was sufficient flow to meet the town&#x27;s needs. Once it had been proven there was sufficient flow, Mail then oversaw design and construction of a new water treatment plant. The new plant provided crystal clear water to Kokstad, which helped the town grow and flourish.

In addition to supplying drinking water to the town, the Crystal Spring Dam has become an attraction for both the Kokstad residents, and tourists to the area. There are three rural schemes located in nearby Swartberg, Franklin and Kransdraai, which meet the RDP level of service.

==Infrastructure and schooling==
Kokstad has many primary and secondary schools, as well as a tertiary institution college. Some of the main schooling institutions are as follows:

* Carl Malcomess High
* Mount Currie Senior Secondary School
* Seven Fountains Primary School
* Shayamoya High
* Kokstad Public Primary
* Kokstad Junior School
* Kokstad Primary School
* Kokstad College
* St. Patricks College (both primary and secondary)
* Esayidi TVET College
Kokstad also has two main hospitals that service the surrounding areas:

* Kokstad Private Hospital
* Usher Memorial Hospital (State Owned Hospital).

==Coats of arms==

===Municipal (1)===
By 1931, the Kokstad municipal council had assumed a pseudo-heraldic &quot;coat of arms&quot; depicting a landscape with Mount Currie in the background, ears of wheat, and a tree, and the motto &quot;Concilio et animis&quot;.

===Municipal (2)===
A proper coat of arms was designed by Ivan Mitford-Barberton in the late 1950s. It was registered with the Cape Provincial Administration in October 1960 and at the Bureau of Heraldry in July 1979.

The arms were : &quot;Per fess Gules and Or, in chief, dexter a Griqua hunter statant holding in his dexter hand a slain buck and in his sinister hand a rifle, sinister a lion statant, all Or; in base, below a yoke the barrel of a cannon palewise, all Sable; the whole within a bordure compony of 40 pieces Argent and Sable&quot;. In layman&#x27;s terms, the shield was divided horizontally into red and gold, the upper half depicting a Griqua hunter holding a slain buck and a rifle and facing a lion, and the lower half a yoke above an upright black cannon barrel, the whole design surrounded by a border divided into forty sections alternately silver and black.

The crest was a cock&#x27;s head issuing from a golden eastern crown, and the motto was &quot;Pro rege lege et grege&quot;.

<text>Jeremiah Léoda Gauthier (December 29, 1904 – January 17, 1964) was a Canadian Member of Parliament from 1945 to 1958. A member of the Liberal Party caucus, he represented three different ridings over the course of his career as the city of Sudbury grew in size and importance to warrant one, and then two, ridings of its own.

==Background==
Born in Copper Cliff, Ontario, Gauthier owned a lumber company in the Sudbury area, and was one of the founding shareholders in Sudbury Broadcasting, F. Baxter Ricard&#x27;s radio company which established CHNO and CFBR. He was active in politics as an organizer, and as campaign manager for provincial MPP James Cooper.

He also served on the boards of the Sudbury Wolves and the Victorian Order of Nurses.

==Political career==
In the 1945 election, he was first elected to represent the riding of Nipissing, which he represented for a single term. In 1947, he was one of several MPs from Northern Ontario who lobbied the government to provide tax relief to the region&#x27;s gold mines. The following year, he was one of six MPs who demanded that the government of Mackenzie King reinstitute food subsidies and remove the sales tax from food, to counter the rising cost of living and the emerging power of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.

In the 1949 election, he shifted to the new riding of Sudbury, which he also represented for a single term. In the 1953 election, he became the first MP for Nickel Belt,

During his time as an MP, he played a role in securing government funding for the construction of the Sudbury Airport, although he raised a public objection when he did not receive a formal invitation to the airport&#x27;s official opening in 1954.

He was reelected in the 1957 election, which resulted in the election of John Diefenbaker&#x27;s short-lived minority government, but retired at the 1958 election for health reasons.

He died on January 17, 1964, at Memorial Hospital in Sudbury.

<doc id="894700" wikidata="Q1049279" url="?curid=894700" title="Omohyoid muscle">
<text>The omohyoid muscle is a muscle in the neck. It is one of the infrahyoid muscles. It consists of two bellies separated by an intermediate tendon. Its inferior belly is attached to the scapula; its superior belly is attached to the hyoid bone. Its intermediate tendon is anchored to the clavicle and first rib by a fascial sling. The omohyoid is innervated by the ansa cervicalis of the cervical plexus. It acts to depress the hyoid bone.

==Anatomy==
=== Structure ===
The omohyoid muscle consists of muscle bellies that meet at an angle at the muscle&#x27;s intermediate tendon.

==== Inferior belly ====
The inferior belly is narrow and flat band.

It arises from the superior border of scapula (near the scapular notch). It sometimes also arises from the superior transverse scapular ligament.

It is directed anteriorly and somewhat superiorly from its origin, extending across the inferior portion of the neck. It passes posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle to insert at the intermediate tendon.

==== Superior belly ====
The superior belly arises at the intermediate tendon. It extends nearly vertically superior-ward close to the lateral border of sternocleidomastoid muscle to insert at the inferior border of the body of hyoid bone (its site of insertion is lateral to that of the sternohyoid muscle).

==== Intermediate tendon ====
The intermediate tendon is variable in length and form, and contains a variable amount of muscle tissue. It is anchored inferiorly to the clavicle and first rib by a band of deep cervical fascia that surrounds the intermediate tendon; this fascial fixation maintains the angle of the muscle.

It is typically situated at the level of the arch of cricoid cartilage, adjacent to the internal jugular vein.

===Innervation===
The omohyoid is innervated by the ansa cervicalis of the cervical plexus. The inferior belly is innervated by the ansa cervicalis itself (which is derived from cervical spinal nerves C1-C3), and the superior belly is innervated by the superior root of ansa cervicalis (which is derived from the first cervical spinal nerve (C1)).

=== Relations ===
The inferior belly of the omohyoid divides the posterior triangle of the neck into a occipital triangle (above) and a subclavian triangle (below).

Its superior belly divides the anterior triangle into an carotid triangle (above) and a muscular triangle (below). Its superior belly serves as the most lateral member of the infrahyoid muscles, located lateral to both the sternothyroid muscles and the thyrohyoid muscles.

The tendon is related to the internal jugular vein and can be used as a landmark for this vein during surgery.

===Variation===
The omohyoid muscle may be doubled or completely absent in some people. Either belly may be doubled or absent.

The inferior belly may be attached to the clavicle directly (rather than by fascia).

The superior belly may be fused with the sternohyoid muscle.

=== Actions/movements ===
The muscle depresses the hyoid bone when the bone is in an elevated position.

A putative action of the muscle is tension of the inferior portion of deep cervical fascia to prevent soft tissues from collapsing inward into the upper airway during deep inspiration.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;omohyoid&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;omos&quot; meaning shoulder, giving one of its attachments, and &quot;hyoid&quot;, giving the other attachment – the hyoid bone.

<doc id="894706" wikidata="Q1501775" url="?curid=894706" title="White Paper of 1939">
<text>The White Paper of 1939 was a policy paper issued by the British government, led by Neville Chamberlain, in response to the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. After its formal approval in the House of Commons on 23 May 1939, it acted as the governing policy for Mandatory Palestine from 1939 to the 1948 British departure. After the war, the Mandate was referred to the United Nations.

The policy, first drafted in March 1939, was prepared by the British government unilaterally as a result of the failure of the Arab–Zionist London Conference. The paper called for the establishment of a Jewish national home in an independent Palestinian state within 10 years, rejecting the Peel Commission&#x27;s idea of partitioning Palestine. It also limited Jewish immigration to 75,000 for five years and ruled that further immigration would then be determined by the Arab majority (section II). Jews were restricted from buying Arab land in all but 5% of the Mandate (section III).

The proposal did not meet the political demands proposed by Arab representatives during the London Conference and was officially rejected by the representatives of Palestine Arab parties, who were acting under the influence of Haj Amin Effendi al-Husseini, but the more moderate Arab opinion that was represented by the National Defence Party was prepared to accept the White Paper.

Zionist groups in Palestine immediately rejected the White Paper and led a campaign of attacks on government property that lasted for several months. On 18 May, a Jewish general strike was called.

Regulations on land transfers and clauses restricting immigration were implemented, but at the end of the five years in 1944, only 51,000 of the 75,000 immigration certificates provided for had been used. In light of this, the British offered to allow immigration to continue beyond the cutoff date of 1944, at a rate of 1,500 per month, until the remaining quota was filled. From December 1945 to the 1948 end of the Mandate, 1,500 additional certificates for Jewish immigrants were allocated each month. Key provisions were ultimately never to be implemented, initially because of cabinet opposition after the change in government and later because of preoccupation with World War II.

==Background==


During World War I, the British had made two promises regarding territory in the Middle East. Britain had promised the Hashemite governors of Arabia, through Lawrence of Arabia and the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence, independence for a united Arab country in Syria in exchange for supporting the British against the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Caliphate had declared a military jihad for the Germans, and the British hoped that an alliance with the Arabs would quell chances of a general Muslim uprising in British-held territories in Africa, India and the Far East. Britain had also negotiated the Sykes–Picot Agreement to partition the Middle East between Britain and France.

A variety of strategic factors, such as securing Jewish support in Eastern Europe while the Russian front collapsed, culminated in the 1917 Balfour Declaration in which Britain promised to create and foster a Jewish national home in Palestine. The broad delineations of territory and goals for both the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine and Arab self-determination were approved in the San Remo Conference.

In June 1922, the League of Nations approved the Palestine Mandate, effective September 1923, an explicit document on Britain&#x27;s responsibilities and powers of administration in Palestine, including &#x27;secur[ing] the establishment of the Jewish national home&#x27;, and &#x27;safeguarding the civil and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine&#x27;. In September 1922, the British government presented the Trans-Jordan memorandum to the League of Nations that stated that the Emirate of Transjordan would be excluded from all the provisions dealing with Jewish settlement, in accordance with Article 25 of the Mandate. The memorandum was approved on 23 September. Stiff Arab opposition and pressure against Jewish immigration made Britain redefine Jewish immigration by restricting its flow according to the country&#x27;s economic capacity to absorb the immigrants. In effect, annual quotas were put in place as to how many Jews could immigrate, but Jews possessing a large sum of money (£500) were allowed to enter the country freely.

Following Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, European Jews were increasingly prepared to spend the money necessary to enter Palestine. The 1935 Nuremberg Laws stripped the 500,000 German Jews of their citizenship. Jewish migration was impeded by Nazi restrictions on the transfer of finances abroad (departing Jews had to abandon their property), but the Jewish Agency for Israel was able to negotiate an agreement that allowed Jews resident in Germany to buy German goods for export to Palestine, thus circumventing the restrictions.

The large numbers of Jews entering Palestine was a cause of the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. Britain responded to the revolt by appointing a royal commission, the Peel Commission, which went to Palestine and undertook a thorough study of the issues. The Peel Commission recommended in 1937 for Palestine to be partitioned into two states: one Arab the other Jewish. The proposal was rejected by the Arabs while the Zionist response was &quot;neither positive nor negative&quot; and the Peel Commission failed to stem the violence. In January 1938, the Woodhead Commission explored the practicalities of partition and considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel Plan. Reporting in 1938, the Woodhead Commission rejected the plan, primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive forced transfer of Arabs, an option that the British government had already ruled out. With dissent from some of its members, the Commission instead recommended a plan that would leave the Galilee under British mandate, but it emphasised serious problems with it such as a lack of financial self-sufficiency of the proposed Arab state. The British government accompanied the publication of the Woodhead Report by a statement of policy rejecting partition as impracticable for &quot;political, administrative and financial difficulties&quot;. It proposed a substantially smaller Jewish state, including the coastal plain only. The Évian Conference, convened by the United States in July 1938, failed to find any agreement to deal with the rapidly growing number of Jewish refugees, increasing pressure on the British to find a solution to the problem of Jewish immigration to Palestine.

===London Conference===
In February 1939, the British called the London Conference to negotiate an agreement between Arabs and Jews in Palestine. The Arab delegates attended on the condition that they would not meet directly with the Jewish representatives, which would constitute recognition of Jewish claims over Palestine. The British government, therefore, held separate meetings with the two sides. The conference ended in failure on 17 March.

In the wake of World War II, the British believed that Jewish support was either guaranteed or unimportant. However, the government feared hostility from the Arab world. That geopolitical consideration was, in Raul Hilberg&#x27;s word, &quot;decisive&quot; to British policies since Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia were independent and allied with Britain.

==Content==

These were the main points of the White Paper:
*Section I. The Constitution: It stated that with over 450,000 Jews having now settled in the mandate, the Balfour Declaration about &quot;a national home for the Jewish people&quot; had been met, and it also called for an independent Palestine to be established within 10 years and to be governed jointly by Arabs and Jews:

His Majesty&#x27;s Government believe that the framers of the Mandate in which the Balfour Declaration was embodied could not have intended that Palestine should be converted into a Jewish State against the will of the Arab population of the country. [ ... ] His Majesty&#x27;s Government therefore now declare unequivocally that it is not part of their policy that Palestine should become a Jewish State. They would indeed regard it as contrary to their obligations to the Arabs under the Mandate, as well as to the assurances which have been given to the Arab people in the past, that the Arab population of Palestine should be made the subjects of a Jewish State against their will.

The objective of His Majesty&#x27;s Government is the establishment within 10 years of an independent Palestine State in such treaty relations with the United Kingdom as will provide satisfactorily for the commercial and strategic requirements of both countries in the future. [..] The independent State should be one in which Arabs and Jews share government in such a way as to ensure that the essential interests of each community are safeguarded.

*Section II. Immigration: Jewish immigration to Palestine under the British Mandate was to be limited to 75,000 over the next five years and then would depend on Arab consent:

His Majesty&#x27;s Government do not [..] find anything in the Mandate or in subsequent Statements of Policy to support the view that the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine cannot be effected unless immigration is allowed to continue indefinitely. If immigration has an adverse effect on the economic position in the country, it should clearly be restricted; and equally, if it has a seriously damaging effect on the political position in the country, that is a factor that should not be ignored. Although it is not difficult to contend that the large number of Jewish immigrants who have been admitted so far have been absorbed economically, the fear of the Arabs that this influx will continue indefinitely until the Jewish population is in a position to dominate them has produced consequences which are extremely grave for Jews and Arabs alike and for the peace and prosperity of Palestine. The lamentable disturbances of the past three years are only the latest and most sustained manifestation of this intense Arab apprehension [ ... ] it cannot be denied that fear of indefinite Jewish immigration is widespread amongst the Arab population and that this fear has made possible disturbances which have given a serious setback to economic progress, depleted the Palestine exchequer, rendered life and property insecure, and produced a bitterness between the Arab and Jewish populations which is deplorable between citizens of the same country. If in these circumstances immigration is continued up to the economic absorptive capacity of the country, regardless of all other considerations, a fatal enmity between the two peoples will be perpetuated, and the situation in Palestine may become a permanent source of friction amongst all peoples in the Near and Middle East.

Jewish immigration during the next five years will be at a rate which, if economic absorptive capacity permits, will bring the Jewish population up to approximately one third of the total population of the country. Taking into account the expected natural increase of the Arab and Jewish populations, and the number of illegal Jewish immigrants now in the country, this would allow of the admission, as from the beginning of April this year, of some 75,000 immigrants over the next four years. These immigrants would, subject to the criterion of economic absorptive capacity, be admitted as follows: For each of the next five years a quota of 10,000 Jewish immigrants will be allowed on the understanding that a shortage one year may be added to the quotas for subsequent years, within the five-year period, if economic absorptive capacity permits. In addition, as a contribution towards the solution of the Jewish refugee problem, 25,000 refugees will be admitted as soon as the High Commissioner is satisfied that adequate provision for their maintenance is ensured, special consideration being given to refugee children and dependents. The existing machinery for ascertaining economic absorptive capacity will be retained, and the High Commissioner will have the ultimate responsibility for deciding the limits of economic capacity. Before each periodic decision is taken, Jewish and Arab representatives will be consulted. After the period of five years, no further Jewish immigration will be permitted unless the Arabs of Palestine are prepared to acquiesce in it.
*Section III. Land: No restriction had been imposed on the transfer of land from Arabs to Jews, but the &quot;White Paper&quot; now stated:

The Reports of several expert Commissions have indicated that, owing to the natural growth of the Arab population and the steady sale in recent years of Arab land to Jews, there is now in certain areas no room for further transfers of Arab land, whilst in some other areas such transfers of land must be restricted if Arab cultivators are to maintain their existing standard of life and a considerable landless Arab population is not soon to be created. In these circumstances, the High Commissioner will be given general powers to prohibit and regulate transfers of land.

On 22 May 1939, the House of Commons debated a motion that the White Paper was inconsistent with the terms of the Mandate, but it was defeated by 268 votes to 179. The following day, the House of Lords accepted the new policy without a vote.

During the debate, Lloyd George called the White Paper an &quot;act of perfidy&quot;, and Winston Churchill voted against his party although it was in the government. The Liberal MP James Rothschild stated during the parliamentary debate that &quot;for the majority of the Jews who go to Palestine it is a question of migration or of physical extinction&quot;.

Some supporters of the government were opposed to the policy on the grounds that it appeared in their view to contradict the Balfour Declaration. Several government MPs voted against the proposals or abstained, including Cabinet Ministers such as the illustrious Jewish Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha.

===League of Nations===
The Permanent Mandates Commission unanimously held that the White Paper was in conflict with the interpretation that the Mandatory Government, with the concurrence of the organs of the League, had put upon the mandate in the past. Four of the members felt that the policy was not in harmony with the terms of the Mandate, and the other three held that existing circumstances would justify the policy if the Council of the League of Nations did not oppose it. The outbreak of the Second World War suspended any further deliberations.

===Arab reactions===
The Arab Higher Committee initially argued that the independence of a future Palestine government would prove to be illusory since the Jews could prevent its functioning by withholding participation, and in any case, real authority would still be in the hands of British officials. The limitations on Jewish immigration were also held to be insufficient since there was no guarantee immigration would not resume after five years. In place of the policy enunciated in the White Paper, the Arab Higher Committee called for &quot;a complete and final prohibition&quot; of Jewish immigration and a repudiation of the Jewish national home policy altogether.

In June 1939, Hajj Amin al-Husayni initially &quot;astonished&quot; the other members of the Arab Higher Committee by turning down the White Paper. According to Benny Morris, the reason that the advantageous proposal was turned down was entirely selfish: &quot;it did not place him at the helm of the future Palestinian state.&quot;

In July 1940, after two weeks of meetings with the British representative, S. F. Newcombe, the leader of the Palestinian Arab delegates to the London Conference, Jamal al-Husseini and fellow delegate Musa al-Alami, agreed to the terms of the White Paper, and both signed a copy of it in the presence of the prime minister of Iraq, Nuri as-Said.

===Zionist reactions===
Zionist groups in Palestine immediately rejected the White Paper and began a campaign of attacks on government property and Arab civilians, which lasted for several months. On 18 May, a Jewish general strike was called.

On 27 February 1939, in response to enthusiastic Arab demonstrations after reports that the British were proposing to allow independence to Palestine on the same terms as Iraq, a co-ordinated Irgun bombing campaign across the country killed 38 Arabs and wounded 44.

In response to the White Paper, the right-wing Zionist militant group Irgun began formulating plans for a rebellion to evict the British and to establish an independent Jewish state. Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky, the founder of Irgun, who had been exiled from Palestine by the British, proposed a plan for a revolt to take place in October 1939, which he sent to the Irgun High Command in six coded letters. Jabotinsky&#x27;s plan, he and other &quot;illegals&quot; would start by arriving in Palestine by boat. Then, the Irgun would help him and the other passengers escape. Next, the Irgun would raid and occupy Government House and other British centres of power in Palestine, raise the Jewish national flag and hold them for at least 24 hours, even at a heavy cost. Simultaneously, Zionist leaders in Western Europe and the United States would proclaim an independent Jewish state in Palestine and function as a government-in-exile. Irgun seriously considered carrying out the plan but was concerned over the heavy losses that would be inevitable. Irgun leader Avraham Stern, who would later break from Irgun to form Lehi, formed a plan for 40,000 armed Jewish fighters recruited in Europe to sail to Palestine and join the rebellion. The Polish government supported his plan and began training Jews and setting aside weaponry for them. However, the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 quickly put an end to those plans.

After the outbreak of war in September 1939, the head of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, David Ben-Gurion declared, “we must help the [British] army as if there were no White Paper, and we must fight the White Paper as if there were no war.”

==Aftermath==

On 13 July, the authorities announced the suspension of all Jewish immigration into Palestine until March 1940. The reason given was the increase in the number of illegal immigrants.

In March 1940, the British High Commissioner for Palestine issued an edict dividing Palestine into three zones:

In Zone A, consisting of about 63 percent of the country including the stony hills, land transfers save to a Palestinian Arab were in general forbidden. In Zone B. consisting of about 32 percent of the country, transfers from a Palestinian Arab save to another Palestinian Arab were severely restricted at the discretion of the High Commissioner. In the remainder of Palestine, consisting of about five percent of the country-which, however, includes the most fertile areas—land sales remained unrestricted.

In December 1942, when the extermination of the Jews became public knowledge, there were 34,000 immigration certificates remaining. In February 1943, the British government announced that the remaining certificates could be used as soon as practicable to rescue Jewish children from Southeastern Europe, particularly Bulgaria. This plan was partly successful, but many of those who received certificates were not able to emigrate although those in Bulgaria survived. In July, it was announced that any Jewish refugee who reached a neutral country in transit would be given clearance for Palestine. During 1943 about half the remaining certificates were distributed, and by the end of the war, there were 3,000 certificates left.

At the end of World War II, the British Labour Party conference voted to rescind the White Paper and to establish a Jewish state in Palestine, but the party&#x27;s Foreign Minister, Ernest Bevin, persisted with the policy, which remained in effect until the May 1948 British departure from Palestine.

After the war, the determination of Holocaust survivors to reach Palestine led to large scale illegal Jewish migration to Palestine. British efforts to block the migration led to violent resistance by the Zionist underground.

Illegal immigrants detained by the British Government were interned in camps on Cyprus. The immigrants had no citizenship and could not be returned to any country. Those interned included a large number of children and orphans.

Immigration statistics compiled in December 1945 indicated that the White Paper allowance had been exceeded by 790 persons when illegal immigrants were included. On 31 January 1946, the High Commissioner announced:
It will be recalled that in the Statement of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of 13 November 1945, it was made clear that His Majesty&#x27;s Government could not divest themselves of the duties and responsibilities under the Mandate while the Mandate continued. They therefore proposed that they would consult with the Arabs with a view to an arrangement which would ensure that pending the receipt of the interim recommendations of the [Anglo-American] Committee of Inquiry there would be no interruption of Jewish immigration at the present monthly rate. These consultations with the Arabs have been proceeding over a long period and have reached no conclusive result.

In these circumstances His Majesty&#x27;s Government have now decided for cogent reasons that they must allow immigration to continue provisionally at the proposed rate of 1,500 a month. Preference will be given to those European Jews who have a special claim such as those to whom the Palestine Government have already undertaken obligations, and relatives in Europe of Jews already established in Palestine. Illegal immigrants will of course, continue to be deducted from quotas.
The quota of 1,500 certificates for Jewish immigrants per month continued until the end of the mandate.

The Provisional Council of Israel&#x27;s first constitutional act was a Proclamation that &quot;All legislation resulting from the British Government&#x27;s White Paper of May 1939, will at midnight tonight become null and void. This includes the immigration provisions as well as the land transfer regulations of February 1940.&quot;

<text>The cervical plexus is a nerve plexus of the anterior rami of the first (i.e. upper-most) four cervical spinal nerves C1-C4. The cervical plexus provides motor innervation to some muscles of the neck, and the diaphragm; it provides sensory innervation to parts of the head, neck, and chest.

== Anatomy ==
They are located laterally to the transverse processes between prevertebral muscles from the medial side and vertebral (m. scalenus, m. levator scapulae, m. splenius cervicis) from lateral side. There is anastomosis with accessory nerve, hypoglossal nerve and sympathetic trunk. It is located in the neck, deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

The branches of the cervical plexus emerge from the posterior triangle at the nerve point, a point which lies midway on the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid.

=== Relations ===
The cervical plexus is situated deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, internal jugular vein, and deep cervical fascia.

It is situated anterior to the middle scalene muscle, and levator scapulae muscle.

=== Branches ===
The cervical plexus has two types of branches: cutaneous and muscular.
*Cutaneous (4 branches): 
**Lesser occipital nerve - innervates the skin and the scalp posterosuperior to the auricle (C2)
**Great auricular nerve - innervates skin near concha auricle (outer ear) and external acoustic meatus (ear canal) (C2-C3)
**Transverse cervical nerve - innervates anterior region of neck (C2 and C3)
**Supraclavicular nerves - innervate the skin above and below the clavicle (C3-C4) 
*Muscular
**Ansa cervicalis - a loop formed by C1-C3 that supplies most infrahyoid (a.k.a. &quot;strap&quot;) muscles (sternothyroid, sternohyoid, omohyoid muscles) etc.
**Nerve to thyrohyoid - fibres from C1 that run with the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII) and do not participate in the formation of the superior root of ansa cervicalis, instead continuing for some further distance to reach and innervate the thyrohyoid muscle and the geniohyoid muscle.
**Phrenic (C3-C5, but mostly C4) - innervates thoracic diaphragm and the pericardium.
**Segmental branches (C1-C4) - innervate anterior and middle scalene muscles
**Levator scapulae muscle (C3-C4) (also innervated by dorsal scapular nerve (C5) of the brachial plexus)

<text>Shanghai Triad is a 1995 Chinese crime-drama film, directed by Zhang Yimou and starring Gong Li. The script is written by Bi Feiyu based on Li Xiao&#x27;s 1994 novel &quot;Rules of a Clan&quot; (门规). The film is set in the criminal underworld of 1930s Shanghai, Republic of China and spans seven days. &quot;Shanghai Triad&#x27;s&quot; Chinese title reads &quot;Row, row, row to Grandma Bridge&quot;, refers to a well known traditional Chinese lullaby.

The film was the last collaboration between Zhang Yimou and actress Gong Li in the 1990s, thus ending a successful partnership that had begun with Zhang&#x27;s debut, &quot;Red Sorghum&quot;, and had evolved into a romantic relationship as well. With the wrapping of filming for &quot;Shanghai Triad&quot; the two agreed to end their relationship both professionally and personally. Gong Li and Zhang Yimou would not work together again until 2006&#x27;s &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower&quot;.

==Plot==

Tang Shuisheng has arrived in Shanghai to work for a Triad Boss, also named Tang. He is taken to a warehouse where two rival groups of Triads carry out an opium deal that goes wrong, leaving one of the rival members dead. Shuisheng is then taken by his uncle to Tang&#x27;s palatial home, where he is assigned to serve Xiao Jinbao, a cabaret singer and mistress of the Boss. It is soon learned that Jinbao is also carrying on an affair with the Boss&#x27;s number two man, Song.

On the third night, Shuisheng witnesses a bloody gang fight between the Boss and a rival, Fat Yu, in which his uncle is killed. The Boss and a small entourage retreat to an island. There, Jinbao befriends Cuihua, a peasant woman with a young daughter, Ajiao. When Jinbao unwittingly meddles in Cuihua&#x27;s business, it results in the Boss&#x27;s men killing Cuihua&#x27;s lover. Furious, Jinbao confronts the Boss and tells Shuisheng to leave Shanghai.

By the seventh day, Song arrives to the island along with Zheng, the Boss&#x27;s number three man. Shuisheng, while evacuating his bowels in the reeds, overhears hiding men plotting, amongst other things, to kill Jinbao. He rushes back and tells Boss what he heard. During a mahjong game, the Boss and Jinbao calmly confront Song with evidence of his treachery. The gang kills Song&#x27;s men and buries Song alive. The Boss then informs Jinbao that she will have to die as well for her role in Song&#x27;s betrayal. Jinbao is calm until she learns that Cuihua is to be killed too, prompting her to futilely attack the Boss. As Shuisheng attempts to save her from her fate, he is thrown back and beaten. The film ends with Shuisheng tied to the sails of the ship as it sails back to Shanghai. The Boss takes Ajiao with him, telling her that Shuisheng needs to learn how to be loyal to the proper people, and how in a few years, Ajiao herself will become another Jinbao.

== Production ==

&quot;Shanghai Triad&quot; was director Zhang Yimou&#x27;s seventh feature film. Zhang&#x27;s previous film, &quot;To Live&quot; had landed the director in trouble with Chinese authorities, and he was temporarily banned from making any films funded from overseas sources. &quot;Shanghai Triad&quot; was therefore only allowed to continue production after it was officially categorized as local production. The director has since noted that his selection of &quot;Shanghai Triad&quot; to follow up the politically controversial &quot;To Live&quot; was no accident, as he hoped that a &quot;gangster movie&quot; would be a conventional film.

The film was originally intended to be a straight adaptation of the novel &quot;Gang Law&quot; by author Li Xiao. This plan eventually changed with Gong Li&#x27;s character becoming more important and the story&#x27;s viewpoint shifting to that of the young boy, Tang Shuisheng. As a result, the film&#x27;s title was changed to reflect its new &quot;younger&quot; perspective.

==Reception==
Though perhaps less well known than some of Zhang Yimou&#x27;s more celebrated films (notably &quot;Ju Dou&quot;, &quot;To Live&quot; and &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot;), &quot;Shanghai Triad&quot; has an approval rating of 90% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 31 reviews, and an average rating of 7/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;Well-acted and beautifully filmed, Shanghai Triad deftly depicts a young man&#x27;s coming of age against the backdrop of mob violence and its punishing legacy&quot;. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 77 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating generally favourable reviews. 

With its headline position in the New York Film Festival, &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; critic Janet Maslin opened her review that despite the clichéd genre of the &quot;gangster film,&quot; &quot;Shanghai Triad&quot; nevertheless &quot;movingly affirms the magnitude of [Zhang Yimou&#x27;s] storytelling power.&quot; Derek Elley of the entertainment magazine &quot;Variety&quot; similarly found the film to be an achievement, particularly in how it played with genre conventions, calling the film a &quot;stylized but gripping portrait of mob power play and lifestyles in 1930 Shanghai.&quot; Roger Ebert, however, provided a counterpoint to the film&#x27;s praise, arguing that the choice of the boy as the film&#x27;s main protagonist ultimately hurt the film, and that &quot;Shanghai Triad&quot; was probably &quot;the last, and ... certainly the least, of the collaborations between the Chinese director Zhang Yimou and the gifted actress Gong Li&quot; (though Gong would again work with Zhang in 2006&#x27;s &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower&quot;). Even Ebert however, conceded that the film&#x27;s technical credits were well done, calling Zhang one of the &quot;best visual stylists of current cinema.&quot;

<text>Vratsa ( ) is the largest city in northwestern Bulgaria and the administrative and economic centre of the municipality of Vratsa and Vratsa district. It is about north of Sofia, southeast of Montana.

Situated at the foot of the Vrachanski Balkan, the town is near numerous caves, waterfalls, and rock formations. The most famous of them are the Ledenika Cave, Skaklya Waterfall, and the Vratsata Pass.

Vratsa&#x27;s motto is &quot;A city like the Balkan – ancient and young&quot;.

==Name==

== History ==

The Ottoman census records of the early 1550s indicate that İvraca was in a continuous development. According to this, there were 82 Muslim households, corresponding to approximately 400 people, and a mosque, later known as &quot;Eski Camii&quot;, with also a population of 31 unmarried males. The Christians living in 12 neighborhoods, on the other hand, reached a population of approximately 1840 with 354 households and 172 unmarried males. At this time the ratio of the Muslim population to the general population increased to 18%. In addition, it is mentioned in the defter that the Muslim and non-Muslim population in the city and some residents of the 2 neighbouring villages were working in the mines and therefore these workers and their families were exempted from the avarız property tax. In 1580, Muslims made up 30% of the total population. At that time, the city had 3 Muslim neighborhoods (mahalle-i Câmi-i Atik, Mahalle-i Câmi-i Cedid, Mustafa Çavuş Mescidi mhalle). There were a total of 258 households in these neighbourhoods. The Christian population also increased, reaching a total of 583 households in 12 neighborhoods named after their priests. Apart from these, there were seven Coptic mining households whose statuses were recognized in 1550. The number of monasteries, which was 4 up to this date, increased to 8.

1831 Ottoman population statistics show that 74% of the Christians were non-taxpayers in the kaza of İvraca and 83% of the Christians were recorded as middle-class.

==History==

Vratsa is an ancient city found by ancient Thracians. Vratsa was called (&quot;door of a fortress&quot;) by the Romans due to a narrow passage where the main gate of the city fortress was located. Nowadays, this passage is the symbol of Vratsa, and is shown on the town&#x27;s Coat of arms.

After the fall of Rome, Vratsa became part of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium).

At the end of the 6th century AD, Vratsa was populated by the South Slavic tribes. Even if they came from Pannonia and Dacia on the north, the town remained under Byzantine rule.

In the 7th century, the Bulgars and the Slavs found the First Bulgarian Empire and the Slavic Vratsa became part of it. The city grew into important strategic location because of its proximity to the South State border. Vratsa became famous for its goldsmiths and silversmiths production and trade, high-quality earthenware and military significance.

In the 8th century, the Bulgarian army captured Sofia, which led to the decreasing of Vratsa&#x27;s importance because of the better strategic position of Sofia, its more developed economy and larger size. But Vratsa was again key for the resistance against the Byzantine, Serbian and Magyar invasions in the Middle Ages.

On 1 May 1966 in the village of Sgorigrad, a Mir-Plakanista mine tailings dam collapsed, causing a flood of mud and debris that killed 488 people. It remains one of the biggest disasters in Vratsa since the 30 September 1923 fire and the Anglo-American bombing of 23 January 1944.

<text>The Osmonds were an American family music group who reached the height of their fame in the early to mid-1970s. The group had its best-known configurations as a quartet (billed the Osmond Brothers) and a quintet (the Osmonds). The group has consisted of siblings who are all members of a family of musicians from Ogden, Utah, and have been in the public eye since the 1960s.

The Osmond Brothers began as a barbershop quartet consisting of brothers Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay. They were later joined by younger siblings Donny and Jimmy, both of whom enjoyed success as solo artists. With the addition of Donny, the group became known as the Osmonds; performing both as teen idols and as a rock band, their peak lasted from 1971 to 1975. Their only sister Marie, who rarely sang with her brothers at that time, launched a successful career in 1973, both as a solo artist and as Donny&#x27;s duet partner. By 1976, the band was no longer producing hit singles; that year, they transitioned into television with &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot;, a popular variety show that ran until 1979.

A revival of the original Osmond Brothers lineup in the 1980s achieved moderate success in country music, and both Donny and Marie separately made comebacks in their respective fields in the late-1980s. The Osmonds have sold over 77 million records worldwide.

The quartet continued to perform through their 50th anniversary in 2007, at which point Alan and later Wayne retired due to health issues; Jimmy was recruited after Alan&#x27;s retirement, with the group performing as a trio until Jimmy suffered a stroke and retired in 2018. On 14 October 2019, the original Osmond Brothers quartet reunited for CBS&#x27; &quot;The Talk&quot; for their sister Marie&#x27;s 60th birthday, which would be the last appearance for the lineup before Wayne&#x27;s death in 2025. The brothers performed &quot;The Last Chapter&quot;, written as a farewell song and introduced in 2018. Donny &amp; Marie ended an 11-year Las Vegas residency on November 16, 2019. Merrill announced his retirement in 2022 to pursue a church mission, leaving Jay as the last remaining member of the original quartet still performing (Donny continues to perform as a solo artist as well). In later years, Alan&#x27;s sons, particularly Nathan and David, and Merrill&#x27;s son Travis have made appearances with their uncles.

== Early careers ==
George Virl Osmond Sr. and Olive Osmond, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, resided on a farm in Ogden, Utah, with their family. George was a postal worker with a military background; both he and Olive were musicians within their church. They had nine children: Virl, Tom, Alan, Wayne, Merrill, Jay, Donny, Marie, and Jimmy. Virl and Tom were both born with severe hearing impairments. After Virl and Tom&#x27;s births, doctors had warned the couple that further children would likely also have hearing impairment, but sensing a divine message not to stop having children, they continued having children anyway; all seven of the later children would be born with full hearing.

The Osmond Brothers&#x27; career began in 1958 when Alan, Wayne, Merrill, and Jay began singing barbershop music for local audiences in and around Ogden, as well as during their weekly church services. In their made-for-TV movie &quot;Inside the Osmonds&quot;, they explain that they originally performed to earn money to help buy hearing aids for Virl and Tom and to finance their future church missions. Despite their young ages (ranging from nine to three years old), within a few years the boys&#x27; talent and stage presence were strong enough that their father took them to compete in an amateur barbershop singing competition in California. On the same trip they visited Disneyland, where Tommy Walker, Disneyland&#x27;s Director of Entertainment and Customer Relations from 1955 to 1966, found the Osmond Brothers singing with the Dapper Dans on Main Street. Walker hired the Osmonds to perform in the park during the following summer and to perform minor roles in the television series &quot;The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters,&quot; starring actor Kurt Russell. The family also appeared on a segment of &quot;Disneyland After Dark&quot;, which first aired in April 1962.

While the Osmond Brothers were working on &quot;Disneyland After Dark&quot;, Andy Williams&#x27;s father Jay saw them and was so impressed he told his son to book them on his television show, The Andy Williams Show. Andy did, and the Osmond Brothers became regulars on the show from 1962 to 1967, where they earned the nickname &quot;one-take Osmonds&quot; among staff due to their professionalism and tireless rehearsing. Donny soon joined them on the show, making the Osmond Brothers a five-member group. Marie and Jimmy were also introduced on the show a few years later. During this time the Osmonds also toured Europe, performing with Sweden&#x27;s most popular singer, Lars Lönndahl, and even releasing a single where they sang a Swedish version of &quot;Two Dirty Little Hands&quot; (&quot;Fem smutsiga små fingrar&quot;).

&quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot; ended its first run in 1967, after which the Osmond Brothers were signed to &quot;The Jerry Lewis Show&quot;, staying with that show until it was canceled in 1969, after which they rejoined &quot;The Andy Williams Show,&quot; which had just returned for its second run. They soon decided they wanted to perform popular music and become a rock and roll band, prompting them to shed their variety-show image. This change was difficult for their father, who was suspicious of rock and roll, but he was persuaded and the boys began performing as a pop band. George Osmond used his military training to keep his sons strictly regimented.

In 1967, the Osmonds had the single &quot;Flower Music&quot;  &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; released by UNI Records. The song failed to become a hit. The group saw several other singles released over the next four years, failing to score a hit until the 1971 chart debut of &quot;One Bad Apple&quot;.

== Pop and rock era ==
=== Bubblegum: &quot;Osmonds&quot; and &quot;Homemade&quot; ===
Record producer Mike Curb saw the Osmonds perform as a band and recognized that they combined a rare mix of polished performing style, instrumental skill, and vocal talent. Curb, at the time, was in the midst of a crusade against rock musicians who promoted drug use, and the Osmond Brothers represented a wholesome and drug-free alternative to the psychedelic rock of the late 1960s. He signed the Osmonds to MGM Records and arranged for them to record at Muscle Shoals with R&amp;B producer Rick Hall. Under Hall&#x27;s guidance, the Osmonds hit the top spot on the pop chart with &quot;One Bad Apple&quot; in 1971. The song, &quot;One Bad Apple&quot;, written by George Jackson, was composed in the style of The Jackson 5 (Jackson denied that he had ever offered it to The Jackson 5, though the Osmonds would later state that The Jackson 5 considered recording it). The Osmond and Jackson families would eventually meet in 1972 and become friends. &quot;One Bad Apple&quot; debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 on 2 January 1971, first hitting No. 1 in February, where it stayed for five weeks.

The Osmonds soon had hits with other light, R&amp;B-style pop numbers like &quot;Double Lovin&#x27;&quot; (No. 14, which was essentially a &quot;One Bad Apple&quot; sound-alike record) and &quot;Yo-Yo&quot; (No. 3). In each of these hits, the formula was the same; Merrill sang lead, and Donny was &quot;co-lead&quot; in essence, singing the &quot;hook&quot; or &quot;chorus&quot; of the song. At this time the Osmonds also recorded several songs that were billed to Donny, the lead soloist on the songs: &quot;Sweet and Innocent&quot; (No. 7), &quot;Go Away Little Girl&quot; (No. 1), &quot;Hey Girl&quot; (No. 9) and &quot;Puppy Love&quot; (No. 3). Uni Records also re-released their 1967 single &quot;Flower Music,&quot; this time with &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; as the A-side, where it reached No. 96. Their transition to pop stars required more elaborate choreography than their original work had required, so older brother Virl Osmond taught the quintet how to dance. Olive Osmond initially taught the quintet how to sing harmony; the harmony arrangements eventually fell upon Wayne, who was found to have perfect pitch.

=== Transition to rock: &quot;Phase III&quot; and &quot;Crazy Horses&quot; ===
The Osmonds began writing and performing their own music, and their sound moved towards rock music beginning with their album &quot;Phase III&quot;. Part of the transition to self-written music was, according to Wayne in 2004, the fact that the family was becoming dissatisfied with some of the material being offered to them not fitting their moral standards, so they started writing their own. In addition to &quot;Yo-Yo&quot;, &quot;Phase III&quot; produced the major hit &quot;Down by the Lazy River&quot; (No. 4). Their next &quot;Crazy Horses&quot; album was the band&#x27;s first personal statementthe brothers have been quoted as saying that the title song refers to air pollution from cars, and its instrumentation featured an even harder rock sound bordering on early heavy metal. They wrote all the songs and played all the instruments with Alan on rhythm guitar, Wayne on lead guitar, Merrill on lead vocals and bass, Jay on drums, and Donny on keyboards; all of the brothers sang backing vocals and an occasional lead on album cuts. Donny largely switched to instrumental contributions for much of 1972 to accommodate his changing voice; by 1973, Donny had settled from his former boy soprano range into a smooth baritenor voice.

Donny&#x27;s voice change was a major upset to the group&#x27;s original formula for success, largely eliminating Merrill&#x27;s young-sounding co-lead&#x27;s voice and forcing Merrill&#x27;s mature tenor voice to strain to cover most of the higher notes, with audible difficulty, through the next few years. The success of &quot;Crazy Horses&quot; singles &quot;Hold Her Tight&quot; (No. 14) and title track &quot;Crazy Horses&quot; (on which Donny did not sing, but did contribute with a prominent keyboard riff) kept the group very popular through 1973. As the group toured, Donny continued to sing his solo hits, with the band progressively lowering the key until his voice change was complete.

With their clean-cut image, talent, and energetic pop-rock sound, the Osmonds toured to crowds of fans across the United States. By this time, the Osmonds had broken through in the United Kingdom as well: counting group and solo recordings, members of the Osmond family charted 13 singles on the UK charts in 1973. Some observers coined a new word, &quot;Osmondmania&quot;, to describe the phenomenon, by analogy with the similar &quot;Beatlemania&quot; of the previous decade. The group also had their own Saturday-morning cartoon series in 1972 and 1973, &quot;The Osmonds&quot;, on ABC-TV. Initially this audience was mostly girls who viewed the band as teen idols, but &quot;Crazy Horses&quot; would eventually introduce the band&#x27;s stylings to a male audience.

=== Emergence as teen balladeers: &quot;The Plan&quot; and &quot;Love Me for a Reason&quot; ===
In their late teens, the older Osmond brothers were of age to go on church missions, typically expected for male members of the church. Noting that the Osmonds&#x27; music career was a major publicity boon for the church that had brought tens of thousands of new members, high-ranking church leadership exempted the Osmonds from missionary service on the logic that the group served as &quot;de facto&quot; missionaries for the faith through their fame and music. Merrill would eventually serve a mission in 2022 after the group disbanded.

They recorded an ambitious album in 1973 called &quot;The Plan&quot;, perhaps best described as a Mormon concept album with progressive rock aspirations, with Alan describing it as aiming to reach The Beatles&#x27; &quot;white album&quot; in scope. One reviewer for &quot;Billboard&quot; suggested that &quot;The Plan&quot; carried a too-strong religious message, given that Mormonism is perceived as fairly conservative and not usually associated with the themes of rock-and-roll. The reviewer likewise suggested that the music was too varied and too experimental. In a retrospective review, Allmusic stated &quot;The Plan&quot; showed the Osmonds had &quot;versatility and skills as musical craftsmen&quot; but they attempted too many musical styles to make the album cohesive as a whole and some of the lyrics were &quot;preachy&quot;. The album produced only two minor hits: &quot;Let Me In&quot; and &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot; (both No. 36 in the United States, although they both went top 5 in the United Kingdom and &quot;Let Me In&quot; was also a major hit on the easy listening charts). Alan considers &quot;The Plan&quot; to be the group&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;.

Following the release of &quot;The Plan,&quot; the popularity of the Osmonds as a group began to decline. Alan, Wayne, and Merrill all married their wives in 1973 and 1974 (Donny married in 1978; Jay would not marry until 1987), and the band began to slow their tour circuit. &quot;The Plan&quot; was also a major departure from the pop music which made them so popular. The combination of this album, along with Donny&#x27;s voice change the year before, meant that the Osmonds&#x27; popularity with young fans would wane.

Another major factor in the band&#x27;s decline was the sheer diversity of its output: within three years, the Osmonds released bubblegum pop, hard rock, and easy listening, and Donny&#x27;s solo career as an oldies cover artist further muddled the band&#x27;s direction. Donny&#x27;s collaboration with Steve and Eydie, &quot;We Can Make it Together&quot; (which Alan, Wayne, and Merrill had penned for Donny), came out on the easy listening charts at the same time the much harder &quot;Crazy Horses&quot; song was charting.

=== Donny&#x27;s solo career, and the emergence of Marie and Jimmy as spin-off acts ===

Donny, Marie, and Jimmy soon began to emerge as solo artists. Jimmy was becoming &quot;big in Japan&quot; and, in 1972, had a No. 1 hit in the United Kingdom with &quot;Long Haired Lover from Liverpool&quot;. Marie, then 13 years old, hit No. 1 on the US country chart in 1973 with &quot;Paper Roses&quot; (a song originally recorded by Anita Bryant a decade before). Donny had a string of pop hits with covers of earlier teen-pop songs, including &quot;Go Away Little Girl&quot; (No. 1, originally by Steve Lawrence), &quot;Puppy Love&quot; (No. 3, a Paul Anka composition) and &quot;The Twelfth of Never&quot; (No. 8, originally recorded by Johnny Mathis). Between 1971 and 1976, Donny had twelve Top 40 hits, including five in the Top 10; for most of these, the Osmonds were still performing as a full band, but backing and giving star billing to Donny while he sang lead.

Donny&#x27;s numerous solo hits have led many to assume he was the group&#x27;s lead singer. Merrill was usually the lead singer; Donny would usually sing the choruses on songs billed to the Osmonds, thus being a &quot;co-lead&quot;. (All five members of the group sang lead at various times; Jay would sing lead on some of the group&#x27;s harder rock tunes, while Alan and Wayne would occasionally contribute a lead vocal on some album tracks.) Donny&#x27;s emergence as a solo star and the record company&#x27;s desire to appeal to the teen-girl audience often thrust Donny out in front of the group; the work of &quot;Tiger Beat&quot; editor Ann Moses was particularly influential in promoting Donny as a teen idol.

By now the family was touring, recording, creating, and producing for five technically separate artists: The Osmonds, Donny Osmond, Marie Osmond, and Jimmy Osmondplus Donny and Marie had begun recording duets and had hits with &quot;I&#x27;m Leaving It Up to You&quot; (No. 4) and &quot;Morning Side of the Mountain&quot; (No. 8). Through all the stress and pressures created by these many efforts, the family hung together, largely at George&#x27;s command. The 2001 ABC-TV movie &quot;Inside the Osmonds&quot; depicts the family mottoes as being &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter who&#x27;s out front, as long as it&#x27;s an Osmond&quot; and &quot;family, faith, and career. In that order&quot;. (Alan&#x27;s version was slightly different in that it was &quot;God, then family, and then career, in that order.&quot;)

The original Osmonds as a group still produced hits. In 1974, &quot;Love Me for a Reason&quot; reached No. 10 in the United States and No. 1 in the United Kingdom. The Irish boy band Boyzone took the song to No. 2 in the UK in 1994. &quot;Love Me for a Reason&quot; was the title track to the album of the same name, which featured a blue-eyed soul format (their fourth style change in less than a decade) arranged by H. B. Barnum.

=== Fall from pop prominence: &quot;The Proud One&quot; and &quot;Brainstorm&quot; ===

By 1976, though, the group&#x27;s record sales were softening. Their 1975 album &quot;The Proud One&quot; sold poorly (despite the title track, a cover of a Frankie Valli minor hit, providing a chart-topping easy listening hit and the group&#x27;s last US top-40 hit to date), and MGM Records was sold to PolyGram. Their first album on the subsidiary label Polydor was the album &quot;Brainstorm&quot;; that album sold only slightly better than its predecessor, and its lead single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Live a Dream&quot; (another Valli cover), fell short of the top 40. Polydor would release two more albums from the family (a Christmas album that included all of the performing family members, and a greatest hits compilation).

== Television era ==
In 1976, ABC offered Donny and Marie their own television show, &quot;The Donny &amp; Marie Show&quot;. George demanded that the Osmond Brothers work behind the scenes on the show. The family and ABC built and operated &quot;Osmond Studios&quot;, a first-class television studio in Orem, Utah, where the show was produced beginning in 1977. As a result, the Osmonds as a performing band became a lower priority to Donny and Marie. The older brothers deferred or gave up their dreams of being a rock-and-roll band, although Donny and Marie as a duo continued to record hits into 1978. Alan recalled not having regrets at the decision, noting that they were able to fulfill a dream while at the same time escaping the hedonism of Hollywood by building the Osmond Studios in Utah. In an interview with &quot;The Lost 45s&quot;, Wayne Osmond suggested their abandonment of songwriting and not working on material during the TV run may have been a mistake, as their career never recovered from the hiatus. Various members of the family struggled with the transition; Donny experienced stage anxiety, Merrill struggled with bipolar disorder, and Marie had a brief bout with an eating disorder after a network executive told her she looked heavy. Both Donny and Marie were offered roles in the 1978 film adaptation of the hit musical &quot;Grease&quot;, with Donny being considered for the role of the Teen Angel and Marie for the role of Sandy; Marie turned the role down, concerned that the character&#x27;s rebellious turn at the end was not a fit for her. Donny and Marie instead chose to star in &quot;Goin&#x27; Coconuts&quot;, under the belief that it would be more family-friendly, which ended up being a critical and commercial failure.

&quot;The Donny &amp; Marie Show&quot; was canceled in 1979, and the Osmonds found themselves in debt and without a clear direction. The group switched from Polydor to corporate affiliate Mercury Records and released another album, &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;, was a transitional album for the Osmonds and was produced by Maurice Gibb, as Curb had temporarily left the recording industry after being unexpectedly elected Lieutenant Governor of California. Among its tracks was the first recorded version of &quot;Rest Your Love on Me&quot;, a country song that became a hit for Gibb&#x27;s group, the Bee Gees, and topped the country charts in a cover version by Conway Twitty. &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot; itself was a major failure, with the album failing to chart and its only charting single, &quot;You&#x27;re Mine,&quot; reaching only to No. 138 on the &quot;Record World&quot; charts; it would be their only album on the Mercury label.

The family also produced two unsuccessful projects for Marie, a sitcom pilot that never aired and a variety show revival that lasted seven episodes in 1980 and 1981. Donny, angry at being typecast as a teen idol, retreated from the public spotlight shortly thereafter. The family also fell prey to embezzlers who came on as business partners to help finance the television show; several went to prison for their crimes.

George Osmond refused to let the family declare bankruptcy and ordered his children honor all of their financial obligations by whatever means necessary, effectively forcing the Osmonds to return to the road.

== Later careers ==
=== Marie Osmond ===

Marie recorded several successful duets with Donny and continued to sing country music; she had several Top 40 country hits in the mid-1980s, the biggest of which was &quot;Meet Me in Montana&quot; with Dan Seals (No. 1). She starred in the Broadway revivals of the musicals &quot;The King and I&quot; (as the lead, Anna) and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (as the lead, Maria) in the mid-1990s. She returned to television first in the short-lived 1995 ABC sitcom &quot;Maybe This Time&quot; and then with Donny in 1998 to co-host &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot;, a talk-entertainment show that lasted two seasons.

Marie suffered from postpartum depression and wanted to help other women who suffered from it. In 2001 Marie, Marcia Wilkie, and Dr. Judith Moore wrote a book on postpartum depression titled, &quot;Marie Osmond Behind the Smile&quot;.

=== Donny Osmond ===

Donny returned to the pop music scene in 1989; when he released &quot;Soldier of Love&quot; to much success in the United Kingdom, American music industry insiders were wary of the Osmond brand and promoted the song as being by a &quot;mystery artist&quot;. The song became a turntable hit in this manner and, when Osmond&#x27;s identity as the mystery artist was revealed, &quot;Soldier of Love&quot; eventually rose to No. 2 on the US charts and was enough of a success to warrant follow-up singles, including &quot;Sacred Emotion&quot;, which peaked at No. 13, and &quot;My Love Is a Fire,&quot; which peaked at No. 21. In 1998, Donny sang &quot;I&#x27;ll Make a Man Out of You&quot; for the film &quot;Mulan&quot;. He performed on Broadway as Gaston in the stage production of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, and also gave over 2,000 performances as Joseph in the touring production of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;. He has hosted game shows in the United States and the United Kingdom (most notably the 20022004 revival of &quot;Pyramid&quot; and the British version of &quot;Identity&quot;), continues to appear on television, winning the ninth season (Fall 2009) of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, and still tours in the United States and England.

==== Donny &amp; Marie&#x27;s Vegas residency ====
From September 2008 to November 2019, Donny &amp; Marie performed a 90-minute show at the Flamingo Las Vegas. The show began in September 2008 and was originally scheduled to run for six months. The response was so overwhelming that the Flamingo immediately asked for a two-year extension. The Donny &amp; Marie Show ultimately ran for 11 years, ending its run in 2019. &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; has been awarded “The Best Show in Las Vegas” for 2012, 2013, and 2014, according to the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot;. The showroom was renamed &quot;The Donny and Marie Showroom&quot; in 2013.

=== &quot;The Osmond Brothers&quot; ===
In response to their father&#x27;s orders, Alan, Wayne, Merrill, and Jay returned to using the name &quot;the Osmond Brothers&quot; and, building on the boom in country pop crossover artists and drawing from the success of the covers of &quot;Rest Your Love on Me&quot; from the previous album, started focusing on recording country music full-time. They had two top-30 Billboard Country hits in the early 1980s: &quot;I Think About Your Lovin&#x27;&quot; (No. 17) and &quot;It&#x27;s Like Fallin&#x27; in Love (Over and Over)&quot; (No. 28), in addition to a handful that reached the bottom of or narrowly missed the top 40. In 1980, Alan and Merrill established Stadium of Fire, an annual festival in their home state of Utah. The brothers paid off their debts by 1983. The Osmond Brothers&#x27; record sales were hampered by a reluctance to go on tour after the debts were paid off; the group instead opted to stay in Branson, Missouri and promote their music through promotional music videos. The brothers continued to perform with various line-ups and sometimes with their children in Branson. Merrill performed and recorded as a solo artist as well; his biggest hit independent of his siblings was a duet with Jessica Boucher, &quot;You&#x27;re Here to Remember, I&#x27;m Here to Forget&quot;, a piece Merrill specifically chose to break from his family-friendly image (like Donny, Merrill had to hide his Osmond identity and recorded the song under the name &quot;Merrill and Jessica&quot;) and which became a hit on the country charts in 1987. The band largely stopped recording and touring in 1987 after Alan was diagnosed with a progressive form of multiple sclerosis that affected his mobility; when the family resumed touring, it was usually without Alan (Alan continues to write new material to the present day). Donny had initially hoped that his comeback would give the Osmond Brothers an opening to return to recording pop music, reasoning that the success of &quot;Soldier of Love&quot; had resolved the major problem of the Osmond name seeming uncool, but this never materialized, in part due to Alan&#x27;s illness and because of issues between the Osmonds and Mike Curb, who—in revenge for Donny choosing to sign with another record label—had tried to pit the brothers against each other as Donny attempted his comeback by having the Osmond Brothers record songs Donny had intended to release on his own album. Wayne, who survived a brain tumor in 1997, retired from the group in 2012 after treatment for the brain tumor damaged his cochlea and rendered him deaf and a stroke rendered him unable to play guitar. All of the brothers are married, some with large families.

Alan&#x27;s eight sons started performing in the mid-1980s as &quot;the Osmond Boys&quot;, later known as &quot;the Osmonds—Second Generation&quot;. Two of Alan&#x27;s sons, Nathan and David; have emerged as solo artists, David as a pop musician and as the lead of the Osmond Chapman Orchestra, and Nathan as a country singer. Alan had initially resisted letting his sons follow him into the music business, warning them after they had completed their church missions that the life of a touring musician would be detrimental to starting a family, but eventually relented. Merrill&#x27;s son Travis Osmond joined the backing band as bass guitarist in 1991; he declined to stay with the band full-time because of his dislike of touring but continued to appear occasionally in that position through Merrill&#x27;s farewell tour in 2024.

In 20072008 all of the Osmonds went on a tour of Europe to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of their career in show business. A special televised concert in Las Vegas (the only tour stop in the US), commemorating the anniversary, aired on US PBS stations on March 10, 2008. Alan played piano with the orchestra for most of the show and Virl and Tom provided signed lyrics for two songs. The Osmonds&#x27; long-time friend and mentor Andy Williams made a surprise appearance, reminiscing about how his father had told him to put the brothers on his variety show.

Jay Osmond was the primary choreographer for the Osmonds’ concerts and some television concerts.

Jimmy worked as a businessman and manager. He eventually moved to Branson, Missouri, and opened the Osmond Family Theater, where he and his brothers performed until 2002. They appear in Branson during the Christmas season.

In 2009, Donny and Marie recorded a television special for the British channel ITV1: &quot;An Audience with Donny and Marie&quot;, part of ITV&#x27;s long-running &quot;An Audience with...&quot; series was based on their Las Vegas stage show.

Both Donny and Marie tour extensively around the world, with Alan&#x27;s son David occasionally filling in for Donny. Merrill, Jay, and Jimmy also sang together at the Suncoast Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, along with some limited touring, mostly in the United Kingdom. Since Andy Williams&#x27;s death, Merrill, Jay, and Jimmy took over operations of his long-running Christmas show, which they perform in Branson, Missouri in November. In 2012, the trio released their first studio album in 28 years, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get There Without You&quot;, which featured the recording debut of Jimmy as lead singer.

Alan and Wayne rejoined the group for one time only for what was billed as their last-ever performance as the Osmond Brothers at Neal S. Blaisdell Center in Honolulu in October 2018, a concert that also included Marie and David among the performers. Since that time, Merrill and Jay toured as &quot;the Osmonds&quot;, sometimes appearing with Marie and David; in these shows (billed as &quot;Marie and the Osmonds&quot;), Jay and Merrill sing many of their old hits and substitute for the late Paul Davis and Dan Seals on Marie&#x27;s country duets. Jimmy toured separately with various projects at the time before suffering a stroke in December 2018; he stated in April 2019 that he was in good health and had decided to take a &quot;long-overdue break&quot; from performing. Alan and Wayne made a second &quot;last ever performance&quot; in October 2019, appearing on &quot;The Talk&quot; for Marie&#x27;s birthday. In 2022, Merrill announced his retirement from performing; his final American show was in April 2022 and featured a special appearance by Donny. The last time the group performed together was in 2022, for a private celebration celebrating Merrill&#x27;s entry into the mission field; the performance, not shared publicly until after Wayne&#x27;s death in 2025, featured a lineup of Alan, Wayne, Merrill, Donny, Jimmy and Tom.

In October 2024, Jay was scheduled to begin a residency in Branson with Nathan Osmond. This did not come to pass after Jay was cast as a guest star in &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call a Musical&quot;.

Wayne Osmond died January 1, 2025 following a stroke.

== 21st-century legacy ==
The Osmonds rank among the poorest performers in terms of having their hits of the 1970s survive in recurrent rotation; classic hits and oldies stations rarely play any of their music, with the occasional exception of &quot;One Bad Apple.&quot; According to Sean Ross at RadioInsight, discussing the fifteen popular songs of 1971 that saw the biggest declines in airplay:

Teen acts had been with us from the beginning, of course, but not since the early ‘60s had they seemed so particularly stigmatized (...) Five songs by teen idolsfour of them Osmonds-related. We haven’t shown individual breakouts for every year of the ‘70s, but we can tell you that there’s an Osmonds-related song every year between 1971 and 1976, except for 1973, when Donny Osmond was being challenged by the DeFranco Family and didn’t have a big enough hit.

Ross later noted of the top 100 songs in the 1970 to 1974 period ranked by a drop-off in airplay, the Osmond family had six listed, the most of any collection of acts; this was twice as high as the next two artists on the list (Cher and Helen Reddy, each of whom recorded three. The Osmond family as a whole ranked the most neglected musical act of the era of the classic hit, from 1970 to 1994. Broadening to the period of 1960 to 1999, the top 100 most neglected songs (which had a disproportionate number of early 1960s songs largely neglected by modern radio) had three performed by at least one Osmond, tied for the most with Connie Francis on the list; this was especially notable because other neglected 1970s artists such as Reddy and Barbra Streisand failed to make the broader list at all. Such was the Osmonds&#x27; fall into obscurity that Karen Osmond, Jay&#x27;s second and current wife, had never heard of the group before meeting him, while Donny&#x27;s son Chris advanced all the way to the final episode of season 2 of &quot;Claim to Fame&quot; largely because most of the contestants were repeatedly unaware who Donny was.

The Osmonds have seen occasional admirers among professional musicians, particularly with a reassessment of their rock era work. Guitarist Paul Gilbert ranked the hard rock &quot;Phase III&quot; album as one of his &quot;not-so-guilty pleasures&quot; and stating &quot;Do not underestimate Merrill Osmond in 1971&quot;. An obituary in &quot;Forbes&quot; lauded Wayne Osmond&#x27;s guitar work with the band and his rock influence, describing him as a &quot;criminally overlooked shredder.&quot;

==Parents==
Olive Osmond, mother of the Osmond siblings, died on 9 May 2004, at age 79. Their father, George Osmond, died on 6 November 2007, at age 90. The couple was survived by their nine children and 55 grandchildren, as well as a number of great-grandchildren. Before George Osmond&#x27;s death, plans were being made for him and the 120-plus members of the Osmond family to appear on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; to celebrate the family&#x27;s 50th anniversary in show business. He died just a few days prior to the taping. The family ultimately decided to go on with the show as scheduled and, on 9 November, the entire Osmond family appeared on stage with Oprah Winfrey as a tribute to their father. The show aired the following day, the same day as George Osmond&#x27;s funeral.

== Hollywood Walk of Fame ==
In 2003, the Osmond Family was honored for their achievements in the entertainment industry with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles, California.

== Band members ==
The members of the band transitioned from exclusively vocal performance to playing instruments, all around the time that &quot;Crazy Horses&quot; was released.

<doc id="894714" wikidata="Q7728264" url="?curid=894714" title="The Crucifucks">
<text>The Crucifucks were an American punk band formed in 1981 in Lansing, Michigan. They were noted for their political agitation, provocative lyrics, and unusually shrill vocals by band leader Doc Corbin Dart. Dead Kennedys vocalist Jello Biafra signed them to his independent Alternative Tentacles label.

Other members of the original line up included Dart&#x27;s cousin Joe on guitar, Scott Fagersten on bass, and drummer Steve Shelley, who went on to play with Sonic Youth.

==History==
The band&#x27;s debut LP &quot;The Crucifucks&quot; was recorded in 1984 and released in 1985 on Jello Biafra&#x27;s Alternative Tentacles label. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; followed in 1987, also on Alternative Tentacles. Between that album and 1996&#x27;s &quot;L.D. Eye&quot;, Dart recorded two solo projects, &quot;Patricia&quot;, on Alternative Tentacles in 1990, and &quot;Black Tuesday&quot;, a self-released cassette, in 1991. After a long hiatus, Doc released an album entitled &quot;The Messiah&quot; on Crustacean Records in 2004. The moniker he used for this album is &quot;26&quot;.

A Crucifucks compilation album entitled &quot;Our Will Be Done&quot; was issued in 1992, combining the band&#x27;s first two LPs with a non-LP song, &quot;Annual Report&quot;, also featured on Maximum Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&#x27;s compilation &quot;Welcome To 1984&quot;. A picture of a Philadelphia police officer posing as shot—originally part of a public relations campaign to obtain wage concessions from the city—was used on the album&#x27;s back cover. Four years later, its discovery by the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police led to a lawsuit against the Crucifucks, which was eventually dismissed.

Dart claims the Crucifucks never officially broke up, but rather drifted apart due to a variety of reasons. By the mid 1990s, Dart had formed a new group called The L.D. Eye. When the group had prepared a full-length record, Alternative Tentacles agreed to release it under the stipulation that it be credited to The Crucifucks. Thus, the group changed its name to The Crucifucks, although no former members other than Dart were involved with The L.D. Eye, and used &quot;The L.D. Eye&quot; as the title of the 1996 album. The band played a number of concerts during this period, including a 1998 performance at Alternative Tentacles&#x27; twentieth anniversary party at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, California, before sinking back into inactivity.

In the early 2000&#x27;s Dart toured with Arizona based punk band the Zero Tolerance Task Force. ZTTF would open for Dart, and he would perform Crucifucks songs with them backing him up. They did at least two tours of this. ZTTF was also signed to Alternative Tentacles. 

The band was known for its anti-authoritarian lyrics, often rife with obscure and perverse humor. The band sought to go beyond the pale in terms of lyrical content, attempting to be as offensive as possible. Many of their other songs are similarly blunt, attacking the American government, American culture in general, and religion, particularly Christianity.

As recently as 2006, Dart has begun identifying himself by the name &quot;26&quot; (dropping his entire given name of Doc Corbin Dart) and renounces swear words, such as his former group&#x27;s moniker.

<text>Petrography is a branch of petrology that focuses on detailed descriptions of rocks. Someone who studies petrography is called a petrographer. The mineral content and the textural relationships within the rock are described in detail. The classification of rocks is based on the information acquired during the petrographic analysis. Petrographic descriptions start with the field notes at the outcrop and include macroscopic description of hand-sized specimens. The most important petrographer&#x27;s tool is the petrographic microscope. The detailed analysis of minerals by optical mineralogy in thin section and the micro-texture and structure are critical to understanding the origin of the rock. 

Electron microprobe or atom probe tomography analysis of individual grains as well as whole rock chemical analysis by atomic absorption, X-ray fluorescence, and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy are used in a modern petrographic lab. Individual mineral grains from a rock sample may also be analyzed by X-ray diffraction when optical means are insufficient. Analysis of microscopic fluid inclusions within mineral grains with a heating stage on a petrographic microscope provides clues to the temperature and pressure conditions existent during the mineral formation.

==History==
Petrography as a science began in 1828 when Scottish physicist William Nicol invented the technique for producing polarized light by cutting a crystal of Iceland spar, a variety of calcite, into a special prism which became known as the Nicol prism. The addition of two such prisms to the ordinary microscope converted the instrument into a polarizing, or petrographic microscope. Using transmitted light and Nicol prisms, it was possible to determine the internal crystallographic character of very tiny mineral grains, greatly advancing the knowledge of a rock&#x27;s constituents.

During the 1840s, a development by Henry C. Sorby and others firmly laid the foundation of petrography. This was a technique to study very thin slices of rock. A slice of rock was affixed to a microscope slide and then ground so thin that light could be transmitted through mineral grains that otherwise appeared opaque. The position of adjoining grains was not disturbed, thus permitting analysis of rock texture. Thin section petrography became the standard method of rock study. Since textural details contribute greatly to knowledge of the sequence of crystallization of the various mineral constituents in a rock, petrography progressed into petrogenesis and ultimately into petrology.

Petrography principally advanced in Germany in the latter 19th century.

==Methods of investigation==

===Macroscopic characters===
The macroscopic characters of rocks, those visible in hand-specimens without the aid of the microscope, are very varied and difficult to describe accurately and fully. The geologist in the field depends principally on them and on a few rough chemical and physical tests; and to the practical engineer, architect and quarry-master they are all-important. Although frequently insufficient in themselves to determine the true nature of a rock, they usually serve for a preliminary classification, and often give all the information needed.

With a small bottle of acid to test for carbonate of lime, a knife to ascertain the hardness of rocks and minerals, and a pocket lens to magnify their structure, the field geologist is rarely at a loss to what group a rock belongs. The fine grained species are often indeterminable in this way, and the minute mineral components of all rocks can usually be ascertained only by microscopic examination. But it is easy to see that a sandstone or grit consists of more or less rounded, water-worn sand grains and if it contains dull, weathered particles of feldspar, shining scales of mica or small crystals of calcite these also rarely escape observation. Shales and clay rocks generally are soft, fine grained, often laminated and not infrequently contain minute organisms or fragments of plants. Limestones are easily marked with a knife-blade, effervesce readily with weak cold acid and often contain entire or broken shells or other fossils. The crystalline nature of a granite or basalt is obvious at a glance, and while the former contains white or pink feldspar, clear vitreous quartz and glancing flakes of mica, the other shows yellow-green olivine, black augite, and gray stratiated plagioclase.

Other simple tools include the blowpipe (to test the fusibility of detached crystals), the goniometer, the magnet, the magnifying glass and the specific gravity balance.

===Microscopic characteristics===
When dealing with unfamiliar types or with rocks so fine grained that their component minerals cannot be determined with the aid of a hand lens, a microscope is used. Characteristics observed under the microscope include colour, colour variation under plane polarised light (pleochroism, produced by the lower Nicol prism, or more recently polarising films), fracture characteristics of the grains, refractive index (in comparison to the mounting adhesive, typically Canada balsam), and optical symmetry (birefringent or isotropic). &quot;In toto&quot;, these characteristics are sufficient to identify the mineral, and often to quite tightly estimate its major element composition.
The process of identifying minerals under the microscope is fairly subtle, but also mechanistic – it would be possible to develop an identification key that would allow a computer to do it. The more difficult and skilful part of optical petrography is identifying the interrelationships between grains and relating them to features seen in hand-sized specimen, at outcrop, or in mapping.

===Separation of components===
Separation of the ingredients of a crushed rock powder to obtain pure samples for analysis is a common approach. It may
be performed with a powerful, adjustable-strength electromagnet. A weak magnetic field attracts magnetite, then haematite and other iron ores. Silicates that contain iron follow in definite order—biotite, enstatite, augite, hornblende, garnet, and similar ferro-magnesian minerals are successively abstracted. Finally, only the colorless, non-magnetic compounds, such as muscovite, calcite, quartz, and feldspar remain. Chemical methods also are useful.

A weak acid dissolves calcite from crushed limestone, leaving only dolomite, silicates, or quartz. Hydrofluoric acid attacks feldspar before quartz and, if used cautiously, dissolves these and any glassy material in a rock powder before it dissolves augite or hypersthene.

Methods of separation by specific gravity have a still wider application. The simplest of these is , which is extensively employed in mechanical analysis of soils and treatment of ores, but is not so successful with rocks, as their components do not, as a rule, differ greatly in specific gravity. Fluids are used that do not attack most rock-forming minerals, but have a high specific gravity. Solutions of potassium mercuric iodide (sp. gr. 3.196), cadmium borotungstate (sp. gr. 3.30), methylene iodide (sp. gr. 3.32), bromoform (sp. gr. 2.86), or acetylene bromide (sp. gr. 3.00) are the principal fluids employed. They may be diluted (with water, benzene, etc.) or concentrated by evaporation.

If the rock is granite consisting of biotite (sp. gr. 3.1), muscovite (sp. gr. 2.85), quartz (sp. gr. 2.65), oligoclase (sp. gr. 2.64), and orthoclase (sp. gr. 2.56), the crushed minerals float in methylene iodide. On gradual dilution with benzene they precipitate in the order above. Simple in theory, these methods are tedious in practice, especially as it is common for one rock-making mineral to enclose another. Expert handling of fresh and suitable rocks yields excellent results.

===Chemical analysis===
In addition to naked-eye and microscopic investigation, chemical research methods are of great practical importance to the petrographer. Crushed and separated powders, obtained by the processes above, may be analyzed to determine chemical composition of minerals in the rock qualitatively or quantitatively. Chemical testing, and microscopic examination of minute
grains is an elegant and valuable means of discriminating between mineral components of fine-grained rocks.

Thus, the presence of apatite in rock-sections is established by covering a bare rock-section with ammonium molybdate solution. A turbid yellow precipitate forms over the crystals of the mineral in question (indicating the presence of phosphates). Many
silicates are insoluble in acids and cannot be tested in this way, but others are partly dissolved, leaving a film of gelatinous
silica that can be stained with coloring matters, such as the aniline dyes (nepheline, analcite, zeolites, etc.).

Complete chemical analysis of rocks are also widely used and important, especially in describing new species. Rock analysis has of late years (largely under the influence of the chemical laboratory of the United States Geological Survey) reached a high pitch of refinement and complexity. As many as twenty or twenty-five components may be determined, but for practical purposes a knowledge of the relative proportions of silica, alumina, ferrous and ferric oxides, magnesia, lime, potash, soda and water carry us a long way in determining a rock&#x27;s position in the conventional classifications.

A chemical analysis is usually sufficient to indicate whether a rock is igneous or sedimentary, and in either case to accurately show what subdivision of these classes it
belongs to. In the case of metamorphic rocks it often establishes whether the original mass was a sediment or of volcanic origin.

===Specific gravity===
Specific gravity of rocks is determined by use of a balance and pycnometer. It is greatest in rocks containing the most magnesia, iron, and heavy metal while least in rocks rich in alkalis, silica, and water.
It diminishes with weathering. Generally, the specific gravity of rocks with the same chemical composition is higher if highly crystalline and lower if wholly or partly vitreous. The specific gravity of the more common rocks range from about 2.5 to 3.2.

==Archaeological applications==
Archaeologists use petrography to identify mineral components in pottery. This information ties the artifacts to geological areas where the raw materials for the pottery were obtained. In addition to clay, potters often used rock fragments, usually called &quot;temper&quot; or &quot;aplastics&quot;, to modify the clay&#x27;s properties. The geological information obtained from the pottery components provides insight into how potters selected and used local and non-local resources. Archaeologists are able to determine whether pottery found in a particular location was locally produced or traded from elsewhere. This kind of information, along with other evidence, can support conclusions about settlement patterns, group and individual mobility, social contacts, and trade networks. In addition, an understanding of how certain minerals are altered at specific temperatures can allow archaeological petrographers to infer aspects of the ceramic production process itself, such as minimum and maximum temperatures reached during the original firing of the pot.

<text>The Stoke Newington &amp; Edmonton Railway was built by the Great Eastern Railway, under the GER (Metropolitan Station &amp; Railways) Act of 29 July 1864. Construction was delayed due to the financial problems of the GER. Work commenced on the Hackney Downs to Lower Edmonton section in 1870. The section from Bethnal Green Junction to Stoke Newington with stations at Cambridge Heath, London Fields, Hackney Downs, Rectory Road, and Stoke Newington opened on 27 May 1872. The remainder opened on 22 July 1872 with stations at Stamford Hill, Seven Sisters, Bruce Grove, White Hart Lane, Silver Street, and Edmonton, then to Edmonton Green. The connection with the original branch line to Enfield Town north of Edmonton Green station was opened on 1 August 1872.

These corrections are typically derived by applying the fiducial cuts on collections of simulated collision events, with and without detector simulation, and inverting the resulting detector transfer function.

<text>Eaglescliffe is a village in the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, England. It is in the civil parish of Egglescliffe.

The village was formerly known as Eaglescliffe Junction, being formed around . In 2011, the Office for National Statistics had the area as Yarm&#x27;s built-up area.

==History==
The village&#x27;s name is thought to be derived from a misspelling of the name of the nearby village of Egglescliffe meaning a church on a hill. A common myth on the name change is that in Victorian times the sign for the new railway station turned up incorrect after the signwriter thought that Egglescliffe was a mistake and altered it.

The Stockton and Darlington Railway passed through the grounds of Preston Hall in Eaglescliffe, and on the opening day there was a famous race between a stagecoach travelling down Yarm Road, and the Locomotion No. 1.

In 2011, Eaglescliffe was named the 4th best place for families to live in England and Wales, according to the savings firm Family Investments.

== Events ==

Many events are held in Eaglescliffe every year, mostly in Preston Park which is situated north of the village, in Preston. Many of these events are run by Stockton Council.

Many local groups gather at the community centres and village halls within Eaglescliffe and its neighbouring villages. Egglescliffe Community Centre is the largest, and plays host to two amateur dramatics groups – Cliffe Theatre (who produce at least two plays every year), and Centre Stage (who produce a pantomime every January, as well as a musical every summer). Egglescliffe Community Centre also hosts many other community groups including a Ladies Section, a weight loss group, dance classes, and many others.

== Sport and leisure ==

To the village&#x27;s east is Eaglescliffe Golf Club – a course which occupies the land bordered to the south by the Sunningdale Estate, to the north by Teesside High School, and to the east by the River Tees. Many street names in the Sunningdale Estate, as well as the name of the local &#x27;Links Primary School&#x27;, reflect the location of this golf club. Preston Park has large playing fields.

==Education==
Eaglescliffe has one secondary school called Egglescliffe School. This is in the east of the village and also has Egglescliffe Sixth Form College for ages 16–18. There are also four primary schools: Junction Farm, Durham Lane, The Links, and Preston. Egglescliffe village has a primary school called Egglescliffe CofE Primary School. As well as these there is also Teesside High School, an independent preparatory and high school, originally an all-girls school, it is now introducing boys within the framework of a diamond model of education.

==Economy==
Tetley Tea have had their only tea bag factory in the western world here since 1969 on &quot;Sowerby Way&quot;. It is the largest tea bag factory in the world, on the Durham Lane Industrial Park, having a floor area of and makes 18 billion tea bags a year; David Cameron and Boris Johnson have both visited the site. Warburtons have a bakery outside of the village to the north-east on the Preston Farm Industrial Estate. The Elementis Chromium site in nearby Urlay Nook closed in June 2009.

==Governance==

Eaglescliffe is part of the Stockton South Parliamentary Constituency which is currently represented in the House of Commons by Matt Vickers (Conservative) who won the 2019 general election by a majority of 5,260. The previous MP was Dr Paul Williams (Labour), &quot;a local GP&quot; (2017–2019). A previous MP is James Wharton (2010–2017) the former Conservative Minister for Northern Powerhouse. The lowest tier of local government is Egglescliffe and Eaglescliffe parish council.

== Transport ==

Eaglescliffe railway station is staffed. Grand Central operate five trains a day direct to/from London King&#x27;s Cross station. Northern provide local services to , , and . Regional destinations and .
 station also serves the village. The closest airport is Teesside International Airport.

== Notable residents ==
* Matthew Bates, former professional footballer, raised and schooled in the area
* Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, Paralympic athlete, lives in Eaglescliffe
* Gary Havelock, speedway rider place of birth
* Frank Middlemass, actor
* Sir Samuel Alexander Sadler (1842–1911), industrialist, mayor and MP for Middlesbrough resided in Eaglescliffe
* James Wharton, former MP for Stockton South

<text>Ingleby Barwick is a town and civil parish in the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees, North Yorkshire, England. It is south of the River Tees and north-east of the River Leven.

Large scale development of the town started in the late 1970s on farm land south-west of Thornaby, the first development being officially opened on 30 July 1981 by the mayor of Stockton-on-Tees. At a parish council meeting in February 2007, the parish gained town status in with the passing of a resolution under the Local Government Act 1972 s245(6).

In 2011, the population of the civil parish of Ingleby Barwick was 20,378, its two electoral wards (which also include the settlements of Hilton, Maltby, High Leven and Low Leven) had a population of 21,045.

==Etymology==
Ingleby Barwick was originally two settlements under a single joint parish, it is common to shorten the name to Ingleby in speech unless disambiguation is needed. Ingleby is derived from Old Norse Englar+by, a group of Angles&#x27; place. Barwick is of Anglo-Saxon in origin, Bere is Old English for barley and Wick means farm.

A &#x27;-by&#x27; suffix is a homophone to the word &#x27;bee&#x27; and such place with the suffix are common locally: Maltby, Thornaby and Coulby Newham. The by-laws are reminant of by&#x27;s use as a word for a place type, the word itself has come to be pronounced in this case as a homophone to &#x27;bye&#x27;. Ingleby is a common name around Yorkshire. Ingleby Arncliffe and Ingleby Greenhow are notably within a ten mile distance from the town and in the same county, North Yorkshire.

This name is pronounced two ways. One way Barwick is pronounced is Bar-ick, this loss is traditional and also seen with Berwick-upon-Tweed. The second way of pronouncing is closer to how the individual words evolved in English and how the name is spelt, Bar-wick. This reflects the name&#x27;s origin as two separate words. Both ways are common in Ingleby Barwick itself.

==History==
===Prehistoric and ancient===
The settlement of Ingleby Barwick has been occupied for thousands of years. There are traces of human occupation from as far back as the Stone Age. Work at a former farm discovered prolific multi period flintwork and Iron Age field patterns in the town.

A salvage excavation was carried out on the former Windmills Fields of the town, at the end of 1996. Five individual burials were found along with a wooden cist, these finds were accompanied by objects containing stone, jet and copper alloy of high status. This site was considered of European significance as it threw new light on the settlement of the area in the Bronze Age and highlighted a change in tradition of burial traditions and trade networks at this time.

A Roman settlement is also apparent in the town and a Roman Villa, was excavated in part. This has been preserved as public open space at Condercum Green in The Rings area of Ingleby Barwick. Building work at Quarry Farm discovered prolific concentrations of multi period flintwork along the South Bank of the River Tees and traces of Iron Age field patterns were discovered. A Roman Villa , perhaps the most northerly in UK, was excavated in part. The &quot;official&quot; report on the excavation was published in 2013 with the title &quot;A Roman Villa at the Edge of Empire&quot; ( )

===Norman era===
After the Norman Conquest the Manor of Barwick was given to Robert Malet, the son of William Malet, William the Conqueror’s great chamberlain. In the 13th century the land was owned by the Priors of Guisborough Priory and Jervaulx Abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Ingleby and Barwick were two separate places. Between the 14th to 17th century, it is not known when Barwick merged with Ingleby as a parish. Between the 14th and 16th centuries landowners in the area included the Percys of Northumberland and the Parrs of Nottingham.

===Renaissance===

The Middle Ages are considered to have ended with the Renaissance in the mid 15th century. In the 17th century the Manor of Barwick was sold to Sir Thomas Lynch, Governor of Jamaica and then to Sir William Turner of Kirkleatham.

===Modern===
After 1611, it is not known when the two separate places of Barwick and Ingleby combined their names or if Ingleby developed as a separate settlement or spawned from and then re-merged with Barwick. The land was in the ownership of the Turners, with them gaining profits from the land used to support a free school and hospital at Kirkleatham.

Industrial revolution

The north of Ingleby Barwick was formerly quarried for Whinstone. Much of this area now forms Ingleby Barwick Golf Academy and northern part of The Rings. Evidence of a tramway system and jetty on historic Ordnance Survey maps suggest that the Whinstone was exported by boat.

Ingleby Barwick is listed as being a township in the parish of Stainton in 1887. Its population was given as 132. During this time the land was sold off by the Turner estate.

World wars

During the Second World War Ingleby Barwick stood near to the south-western perimeter of Thornaby Airfield and a number of aircraft crashed where Ingleby Barwick now stands. On 11 June 1940 a Coastal Command Lockheed Hudson crashed at Quarry Farm killing the four crew after the bomb load exploded on crashing. On 28 April 1941 a Bristol Blenheim crashed at Barwick Lane killing all three crew. On 18 December 1941 a Lockheed Hudson stalled soon after take off and crashed into Quarry Farm killing the five crew and four civilians. On 4 September 1942 a Lockheed Hudson crashed at Myton House Farm killing the four crew. The last aircraft accident was a Photo Reconnaissance de Havilland Mosquito which was attempting to land at Thornaby on one engine and crashed into land which is now home to Ingleby Mill School on 11 November 1943 killing both crew members; there is now a stone marking the crash site.

==Governance==
===Town Council===
Previously under the Maltby and Ingleby Barwick Parish Council, the parish council split in 1990. Ingleby Barwick Parish Council became a town council in 2007, therefore giving the settlement town status.

It has 6 councillors from 4 May 2023, rather than the 12 previously allocated, due to a Boundary Commission error. The town council manage The Rings Community Hub Rings and the war memorial in Romano Park.

In 2021 the council attracted controversy after they declined a request for the council to fly the Pride Flag during pride month.



====Coat of Arms====

The Coat of Arms was given to the town in October 2000. It contains: a representation of the three rivers that run around Ingleby Barwick; depictions of mill-rinds which are an historical link to the Turner family, who used to own most of the land which now forms the town, and the Barwick element of the name.

The crest shows a Teal bird which refers to a horse named Teal, trained at Middleham by Captain Neville Crump, which won the Grand National in 1952. The Teal Arms in the town is also a reference to the horse.

<text>Mohamed Alí Amar (; born 5 November 1966), known as Nayim (), is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a central midfielder.

He scored a last-minute goal for Real Zaragoza in the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final against Arsenal, with a 45-yard lob in the final minute of extra time. Over eight seasons in La Liga, he appeared in 130 matches and scored five goals.

He started his professional career with Barcelona and also represented Tottenham for five years, making over 100 league appearances.

==Club career==

===Barcelona and Tottenham===
At the age of 12, Nayim left his hometown of Ceuta and joined FC Barcelona&#x27;s youth academy La Masia. He broke into the first team under Terry Venables, but had very few opportunities due to 18 months of injuries. The same manager took him to Tottenham Hotspur in November 1988 originally on loan, making him the first Spaniard to play in English football since the Basque child refugee Emilio Aldecoa in 1947. Having initially spent several weeks waiting for a work permit, he signed the following year for £400,000 as part of the deal that took Gary Lineker in the same direction; his first goal for the club came in a 2–0 away win against Southampton, and he also found the net in Spurs&#x27; 3–0 home victory over West Ham United.

On 25 October 1989, Nayim scored a free kick in a 3–0 win away to Manchester United, which put pressure on their manager Alex Ferguson. He made a total of 23 appearances in 1989–90, helping Tottenham to a third-place finish. The League Cup offered him his first experience of English cup competition, playing four games &quot;en route&quot; to the quarter-finals and scoring three times.

The following season proved to be Nayim&#x27;s most successful in English football. Although the team finished tenth, he appeared in 33 league matches and netted five times; his path to a Wembley final was again halted at the League Cup semi-final but, in the FA Cup, they overcame Nottingham Forest 2–1 in the final, with the player replacing injured Paul Gascoigne early in the game and setting up both goals to bring success to White Hart Lane. In a pre-match interview, he was praised by Bill Nicholson, Tottenham&#x27;s double-winning manager of 1961.

Nayim took part in 31 league games in 1991–92, adding six in the League Cup campaign, including both legs of the semi-final loss to Nottingham Forest. The following season, he won the &quot;Goal of the Month&quot; competition for October with a volley against Liverpool; he added a hat-trick in the FA Cup quarter-final at Manchester City, helping his team to a 4–2 win. Spain national team manager Javier Clemente made a rare foreign trip to monitor him, but he never earned a cap.

During his time in England, Nayim was accused by the press of diving; a feign against Oxford United earned a rebuke from the usually reserved television commentator Trevor Brooking. He was dissuaded from continuing to simulate by Venables, who told him that the practice was reviled in England.

===Zaragoza===
In May 1993, Nayim signed for Real Zaragoza for £500,000. His most notable moment in football came in the final seconds of extra time in the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final by lobbing David Seaman from 45 yards to score a last-minute goal and win it 2–1 against Arsenal; nearly two decades later, he told UEFA&#x27;s website that the strike was premeditated as his experience in England had taught him that the Gunners played a high defensive line.

===Later years===
Nayim retired in 2000, after a stint with Spanish Segunda División side CD Logroñés. He took up coaching afterwards, managing Atlético Ceuta and serving as assistant to AD Ceuta; in late 2009, he joined former Zaragoza teammate José Aurelio Gay&#x27;s coaching staff, being named his assistant manager after Marcelino García Toral&#x27;s sacking.

Nayim returned to his hometown in May 2016, to become sporting director at AD Ceuta FC.

==Personal life==
Nayim, a Muslim, was the only player of the Islamic faith to compete in the inaugural Premier League season. The eldest of his three children, Youssef, pursued a football career in the same position.

In 2006, the Aragonese village of Trasmoz named a street &#x27;Gol de Nayim&#x27; (&#x27;Nayim&#x27;s Goal&#x27;).

<doc id="894763" wikidata="Q1037763" url="?curid=894763" title="Hollywood Rose">
<text>Hollywood Rose was an American glam metal group formed in June 1983. They are best known as the precursor for what would eventually become Guns N&#x27; Roses. The group was founded by Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin and Chris Weber, while they were aided during live shows by Rick Marrs, Andre Troxx, Daniel &quot;DJ&quot; Nicolson, Johnny Kreis and Steve Darrow. Rose, Stradlin and Weber, along with Kreis and Nicolson, recorded a five-song demo in January 1984. However, after a number of lineup changes, which includes Weber, Kreis and Nicolson being replaced by Slash and Steven Adler (both then of Road Crew) as well the departure of Stradlin, the group disbanded the same year.

Hollywood Rose reunited for a New Year&#x27;s Eve show on 1 January 1985 with Rose, Stradlin, and Darrow returning and adding former L.A. Guns drummer Rob Gardner to the group. L.A. Guns founder Tracii Guns replaced Weber for the reunion gig. In March 1985, they merged with L.A. Guns to become Guns N&#x27; Roses.

The five-song demo was released on 22 June 1984 with the title &quot;The Roots of Guns N&#x27; Roses&quot;. A number of Hollywood Rose songs were included on the Guns N&#x27; Roses albums &quot;Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide&quot; (1986), &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; (1987), &quot;Live from the Jungle&quot; (1987), and &quot;G N&#x27; R Lies&quot; (1988).

==History==

===Formation (1983)===
Prior to forming, guitarist Chris Weber was introduced to Lafayette native Izzy Stradlin in the parking lot of the Rainbow Bar and Grill, by friend Tracii Guns, who was leading the first incarnation of L.A. Guns at this time, after Weber expressed an interest in forming a band. 

Soon afterwards, Weber and Stradlin started writing material and, at the suggestion of Stradlin, recruited his childhood friend, former Rapidfire and L.A. Guns singer Axl Rose, then known as Bill Rose. At the suggestion of Rose, the group called themselves AXL, with Rose adopting Axl as his first name. They played their first gig at The Orphanage in North Hollywood and played a few more shows before changing their name to Rose. The group soon changed their name, for the final time, to Hollywood Rose when Weber discovered that the name Rose was already being used by a New York band.

During the group&#x27;s live shows, they were aided by bassists Rick Marrs, Andre Troxx, Daniel &quot;DJ&quot; Nicolson and Steve Darrow, along with drummer Johnny Kreis, who remained the only consistent member of the group outside of Rose, Stradlin and Weber.

===Lineup changes, Guns N&#x27; Roses (1984–1985)===

After borrowing money from Weber&#x27;s father, the group recorded a five-song demo in Hollywood in 1984. 

After playing a number of shows, they appeared at the Music Machine in 1984. During the show, Weber accidentally hit Rose with the headstock of his guitar. Rose stormed off and eventually fired Weber from the band, with former Road Crew guitarist Slash joining the group. Unhappy at the firing of Weber, Stradlin left the group when Slash first came to rehearse, going on to join London. Slash&#x27;s Road Crew bandmate Steven Adler also replaced drummer Kreis during this time. The group continued to play more shows before eventually disbanding, playing their final show at The Troubadour in 1984. Rose went on to front L.A. Guns, while Slash auditioned for Poison at the suggestion of former guitarist Matt Smith.

The group reunited for a New Years celebration show on 1 January 1985, with Rose, Stradlin and Darrow returning along while L.A. Guns drummer Rob Gardner also joined the group. Weber, who left to move to New York City, was replaced by Tracii Guns for the gig. 

Hollywood Rose then merged with L.A. Guns in March 1985, forming Guns N&#x27; Roses. The initial lineup consisted of Axl Rose, Tracii Guns, Izzy Stradlin, Ole Beich and Rob Gardner. 

Beich, Guns and Gardner were all gone from the band within two months and replaced by Duff McKagan, Slash, and Steven Adler. The lineup of Rose, Stradlin, McKagan, Slash and Adler became known as the &quot;classic lineup&quot; of Guns N&#x27; Roses.

A number of Hollywood Rose songs would be included on releases by Guns N&#x27; Roses, including &quot;Anything Goes&quot; (from &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;), &quot;Reckless Life&quot; and &quot;Move to the City&quot; (both from &quot;Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide&quot; and &quot;G N&#x27; R Lies&quot;) as well as &quot;Shadow of Your Love&quot; (from &quot;Live from the Jungle&quot;).

In 1998, former guitarist Weber sued Axl Rose, claiming that he co-wrote two songs he was not credited for, &quot;Shadow of Your Love&quot; and &quot;Back Off Bitch&quot; (from &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot;).

===Re-formation (1989–1990)===
In 1989, Weber re-formed Hollywood Rose with new vocalist Jimmy Swan and they were signed to Summa Music Group. A full-length album was recorded, but went unreleased. One track from the album, &quot;Sweet Little Angel&quot;, was subsequently released on the soundtrack to the 1990 film &quot;Miami Blues&quot;. 

A second studio track, &quot;Come A Little Closer&quot;, with Jimmy Swan on vocals, can be heard on the four-disc box set &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Rebels &amp; the Sunset Strip, Vol. 1&quot;.

===&quot;The Roots of Guns N&#x27; Roses&quot; (2004)===
In 2004, Weber, who had formed U.P.O. since leaving the band, sold the five-song demo the group recorded in 1984 to Cleopatra Records.

They released the album, which included, along with the original recordings, remixes by former Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Gilby Clarke (which featured addition guitar overdubs by Tracii Guns) and former London and Cinderella drummer Fred Coury (who had filled in for Guns N&#x27; Roses drummer Steven Adler for a few shows) on June 22 with the title &quot;The Roots of Guns N&#x27; Roses&quot;. The Japanese edition of the album included a DVD with footage of the group.

On 21 June 2004, Axl Rose sought an injunction against the release of the album, suing Cleopatra Records for trademark infringement, violation of rights in his name and likeness, and unfair competition. 

Slash and former Guns N&#x27; Roses bassist Duff McKagan were also named as plaintiffs with Rose. However, on July 6, United States district court Judge Gary A. Fees denied the motion of Rose and his Guns N&#x27; Roses partnership for a preliminary injunction against the independent record label.

In 2012, Cleopatra Records re-released a CD entitled &quot;Dopesnake&quot; by a similarly named Guns N&#x27; Roses tribute act named Hollywood Roses (plural), which had been originally put out in 2007 by another label. 
There were no songs by either Guns N&#x27; Roses or Hollywood Rose on the album, but it did feature guest performances by Phil Lewis of L.A. Guns as well as Guns N&#x27; Roses veterans Tracii Guns, Gilby Clarke, Chris Weber and Teddy Zig Zag.

<doc id="894764" wikidata="Q325575" url="?curid=894764" title="Sweet November (2001 film)">
<text>Sweet November is a 2001 American romantic drama film based in San Francisco directed by Pat O&#x27;Connor and starring Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron. The film is loosely based on the 1968 film &quot;Sweet November&quot; written by Herman Raucher, which starred Anthony Newley and Sandy Dennis; with some differences in plot. The film reunites Reeves and Theron, who starred in &quot;Devil’s Advocate&quot;.

&quot;Sweet November&quot; was released on February 16, 2001, and was panned by critics, who called it &quot;schmaltzy and manipulative&quot;, while the plot and the lack of chemistry between Reeves and Theron were also criticized. The film was also a box office disappointment, grossing only $65.8 million worldwide against a budget of $40 million.

==Plot==

Nelson Moss is a workaholic advertising executive who meets Sara Deever, a woman very different from anyone he has met before. His attempt to get an answer from her on his driving test leads to her failing due to cheating.

Sara beguiles Nelson and continually asks him to spend a month with her on the promise that she will change his life for the better. On the first night of November, after he is fired and dumped on the same day, she sleeps with him, and the next day Chaz, a close friend of Sara&#x27;s, arrives and refers to Nelson as Sara&#x27;s &quot;November&quot;.

Throughout November, the two experience happy times together and fall in love. Nelson examines his life and past, and befriends a 10-year-old fatherless child named Abner. Eventually, he realizes he is in love with Sara and asks her to marry him. It is revealed that Sara has terminal cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Because she cannot bear to have Nelson experience her death, she asks him to leave. Sara tells Chaz that Nelson proposed. When he says that it wasn&#x27;t the first time that a man had proposed, implying Sara has had numerous &quot;months&quot; before. Sara confirms this but claims it was the first time she had wanted to say yes.

Sara decides she will not continue the relationship to protect Nelson from being hurt. He complies, but then stages a surprise return during the Thanksgiving holiday, giving her gifts that remind her of their happy times.

They stay together for one more day; he posts November calendars all over her apartment walls, saying it can always be November for them. They make love, but the next morning, Nelson finds Sara is dressed. She asks him to leave, and he sees she has taken down the calendars.

Sara runs out of her apartment with Nelson chasing her in the street until finally she stops along a foot bridge to the park entrance. There, she asks him to let her go so that he will always have happy memories of her, and explains that this is how she needs to be remembered. Sara will return home to her family (whom she had been avoiding) and face her last days.

Sara then blindfolds Nelson, leads him into the park, and gives him a last kiss. He takes off the blindfold and sees that he is alone in the park where they went on one of their first dates. His eyes fill with tears.

===Box office===
The film opened at number 4 at the North American box office making $11,015,226 in its opening weekend behind &quot;&quot;, &quot;Down to Earth&quot; and &quot;Hannibal&quot;. It ultimately grossed $25.3 million domestically with an additional $40.5 million overseas to a total of $65.8 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 15% based on 99 reviews, with an average rating of 3.6/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;Schmaltzy and manipulative, &quot;Sweet November&quot; suffers from an implausible plot and non-existent chemistry between its leads.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 27 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Todd McCarthy of Variety called it: &quot;A contrived but entirely workable premise is given a well-tooled treatment in Sweet November, a femme-slanted doomed romance with a heavily calculated feel to it.&quot;
Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it 1 out of 4, and wrote: &quot;Passes off pathological behavior as romantic bliss. It&#x27;s about two sick and twisted people playing mind games and calling it love.&quot;
Peter Travers of Rolling Stone warned: &quot;Beware all male viewers who enter here, you are in chick-movie hell.&quot;
The film was nominated for three Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Remake or Sequel, Worst Actor (Keanu Reeves), and Worst Actress (Charlize Theron). It is listed on Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot; as one of the 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.

<text>Emission theory, also called emitter theory or ballistic theory of light, was a competing theory for the special theory of relativity, explaining the results of the Michelson–Morley experiment of 1887. Emission theories obey the principle of relativity by having no preferred frame for light transmission, but say that light is emitted at speed &quot;c&quot; relative to its source instead of applying the invariance postulate. Thus, emitter theory combines electrodynamics and mechanics with a simple Newtonian theory. Although there are still proponents of this theory outside the scientific mainstream, this theory is considered to be conclusively discredited by most scientists.

==History==

The name most often associated with emission theory is Isaac Newton. In his &quot;corpuscular theory&quot; Newton visualized light &quot;corpuscles&quot; being thrown off from hot bodies at a nominal speed of &quot;c&quot; with respect to the emitting object, and obeying the usual laws of Newtonian mechanics, and we then expect light to be moving towards us with a speed that is offset by the speed of the distant emitter (&quot;c&quot; ± &quot;v&quot;).

In the 20th century, special relativity was created by Albert Einstein to solve the apparent conflict between electrodynamics and the principle of relativity. The theory&#x27;s geometrical simplicity was persuasive, and the majority of scientists accepted relativity by 1911. However, a few scientists rejected the second basic postulate of relativity: the constancy of the speed of light in all inertial frames. So different types of emission theories were proposed where the speed of light depends on the velocity of the source, and the Galilean transformation is used instead of the Lorentz transformation. All of them can explain the negative outcome of the Michelson–Morley experiment, since the speed of light is constant with respect to the interferometer in all frames of reference. Some of those theories were:

*Light retains throughout its whole path the component of velocity which it obtained from its original moving source, and after reflection light spreads out in spherical form around a center which moves with the same velocity as the original source. (Proposed by Walter Ritz in 1908). This model was considered to be the most complete emission theory. (Actually, Ritz was modeling Maxwell–Lorentz electrodynamics. In a later paper Ritz said that the emission particles &quot;in his theory&quot; should suffer interactions with charges along their path and thus waves (produced by them) would not retain their original emission velocities indefinitely.)
*The excited portion of a reflecting mirror acts as a new source of light and the reflected light has the same velocity &quot;c&quot; with respect to the mirror as has original light with respect to its source. (Proposed by Richard Chase Tolman in 1910, although he was a supporter of special relativity).
*Light reflected from a mirror acquires a component of velocity equal to the velocity of the mirror image of the original source (Proposed by Oscar M. Stewart in 1911).
*A modification of the Ritz–Tolman theory was introduced by J. G. Fox (1965). He argued that the extinction theorem (i.e., the regeneration of light within the traversed medium) must be considered. In air, the extinction distance would be only 0.2 cm, that is, after traversing this distance the speed of light would be constant with respect to the medium, not to the initial light source. (Fox himself was, however, a supporter of special relativity.)

Albert Einstein is supposed to have worked on his own emission theory before abandoning it in favor of his special theory of relativity. Many years later R.S. Shankland reports Einstein as saying that Ritz&#x27;s theory had been &quot;very bad&quot; in places and that he himself had eventually discarded emission theory because he could think of no form of differential equations that described it, since it leads to the waves of light becoming &quot;all mixed up&quot;.

==Refutations of emission theory==
The following scheme was introduced by de Sitter to test emission theories:
:formula_1
where &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light, &quot;v&quot; that of the source, &quot;c&#x27; &quot; the resultant speed of light, and &quot;k&quot; a constant denoting the extent of source dependence which can attain values between 0 and 1. According to special relativity and the stationary aether, &quot;k&quot;=0, while emission theories allow values up to 1. Numerous terrestrial experiments have been performed, over very short distances, where no &quot;light dragging&quot; or extinction effects could come into play, and again the results confirm that light speed is independent of the speed of the source, conclusively ruling out emission theories.

=== Astronomical sources ===

In 1910 Daniel Frost Comstock and in 1913 Willem de Sitter wrote that for the case of a double-star system seen edge-on, light from the approaching star might be expected to travel faster than light from its receding companion, and overtake it. If the distance was great enough for an approaching star&#x27;s &quot;fast&quot; signal to catch up with and overtake the &quot;slow&quot; light that it had emitted earlier when it was receding, then the image of the star system should appear completely scrambled. De Sitter argued that none of the star systems he had studied showed the extreme optical effect behavior, and this was considered the death knell for Ritzian theory and emission theory in general, with formula_2.

The effect of extinction on de Sitter&#x27;s experiment has been considered in detail by Fox, and it arguably undermines the cogency of de Sitter type evidence based on binary stars. However, similar observations have been made more recently in the x-ray spectrum by Brecher (1977), which have a long enough extinction distance that it should not affect the results. The observations confirm that the speed of light is independent of the speed of the source, with formula_3.

Hans Thirring argued in 1924, that an atom which is accelerated during the emission process by thermal collisions in the sun, is emitting light rays having different velocities at their start- and endpoints. So one end of the light ray would overtake the preceding parts, and consequently the distance between the ends would be elongated up to 500 km until they reach Earth, so that the mere existence of sharp spectral lines in the sun&#x27;s radiation, disproves the ballistic model.

=== Terrestrial sources ===
Such experiments include that of Sadeh (1963) who used a time-of-flight technique to measure velocity differences of photons traveling in opposite direction, which were produced by positron annihilation. Another experiment was conducted by Alväger et al. (1963), who compared the time of flight of gamma rays from moving and resting sources. Both experiments found no difference, in accordance with relativity.

Filippas and Fox (1964) did not consider Sadeh (1963) and Alväger (1963) to have sufficiently controlled for the effects of extinction. So they conducted an experiment using a setup specifically designed to account for extinction. Data collected from various detector-target distances were consistent with there being no dependence of the speed of light on the velocity of the source, and were inconsistent with modeled behavior assuming c ± v both with and without extinction.

Continuing their previous investigations, Alväger et al. (1964) observed π0-mesons which decay into photons at 99.9% light speed. The experiment showed that the photons didn&#x27;t attain the velocity of their sources and still traveled at the speed of light, with formula_4. The investigation of the media which were crossed by the photons showed that the extinction shift was not sufficient to distort the result significantly.

Also measurements of neutrino speed have been conducted. Mesons travelling nearly at light speed were used as sources. Since neutrinos only participate in the electroweak interaction, extinction plays no role. Terrestrial measurements provided upper limits of formula_5.

=== Interferometry ===
The Sagnac effect demonstrates that one beam on a rotating platform covers less distance than the other beam, which creates the shift in the interference pattern. Georges Sagnac&#x27;s original experiment has been shown to suffer extinction effects, but since then, the Sagnac effect has also been shown to occur in vacuum, where extinction plays no role.

The predictions of Ritz&#x27;s version of emission theory were consistent with almost all terrestrial interferometric tests save those involving the propagation of light in moving media, and Ritz did not consider the difficulties presented by tests such as the Fizeau experiment to be insurmountable. Tolman, however, noted that a Michelson–Morley experiment using an extraterrestrial light source could provide a decisive test of the Ritz hypothesis. In 1924, Rudolf Tomaschek performed a modified Michelson–Morley experiment using starlight, while Dayton Miller used sunlight. Both experiments were inconsistent with the Ritz hypothesis.

Babcock and Bergman (1964) placed rotating glass plates between the mirrors of a common-path interferometer set up in a static Sagnac configuration. If the glass plates behave as new sources of light so that the total speed of light emerging from their surfaces is &quot;c&quot; + &quot;v&quot;, a shift in the interference pattern would be expected. However, there was no such effect which again confirms special relativity, and which again demonstrates the source independence of light speed. This experiment was executed in vacuum, thus extinction effects should play no role.

Albert Abraham Michelson (1913) and Quirino Majorana (1918/9) conducted interferometer experiments with resting sources and moving mirrors (and vice versa), and showed that there is no source dependence of light speed in air. Michelson&#x27;s arrangement was designed to distinguish between three possible interactions of moving mirrors with light: (1) &quot;the light corpuscles are reflected as projectiles from an elastic wall&quot;, (2) &quot;the mirror surface acts as a new source&quot;, (3) &quot;the velocity of light is independent of the velocity of the source&quot;. His results were consistent with source independence of light speed. Majorana analyzed the light from moving sources and mirrors using an unequal arm Michelson interferometer that was extremely sensitive to wavelength changes. Emission theory asserts that Doppler shifting of light from a moving source represents a frequency shift with no shift in wavelength. Instead, Majorana detected wavelength changes inconsistent with emission theory.

Beckmann and Mandics (1965) repeated the Michelson (1913) and Majorana (1918) moving mirror experiments in high vacuum, finding &quot;k&quot; to be less than 0.09. Although the vacuum employed was insufficient to definitively rule out extinction as the reason for their negative results, it was sufficient to make extinction highly unlikely. Light from the moving mirror passed through a Lloyd interferometer, part of the beam traveling a direct path to the photographic film, part reflecting off the Lloyd mirror. The experiment compared the speed of light hypothetically traveling at &quot;c + v&quot; from the moving mirrors, versus reflected light hypothetically traveling at &quot;c&quot; from the Lloyd mirror.

=== Other refutations ===
Emission theories use the Galilean transformation, according to which time coordinates are invariant when changing frames (&quot;absolute time&quot;). Thus the Ives–Stilwell experiment, which confirms relativistic time dilation, also refutes the emission theory of light. As shown by Howard Percy Robertson, the complete Lorentz transformation can be derived, when the Ives–Stillwell experiment is considered together with the Michelson–Morley experiment and the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment.

Furthermore, quantum electrodynamics places the propagation of light in an entirely different, but still relativistic, context, which is completely incompatible with any theory that postulates a speed of light that is affected by the speed of the source.

<text>In group theory, the Todd–Coxeter algorithm, created by J. A. Todd and H. S. M. Coxeter in 1936, is an algorithm for solving the coset enumeration problem. Given a presentation of a group &quot;G&quot; by generators and relations and a subgroup &quot;H&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, the algorithm enumerates the cosets of &quot;H&quot; on &quot;G&quot; and describes the permutation representation of &quot;G&quot; on the space of the cosets (given by the left multiplication action). If the order of a group &quot;G&quot; is relatively small and the subgroup &quot;H&quot; is known to be uncomplicated (for example, a cyclic group), then the algorithm can be carried out by hand and gives a reasonable description of the group &quot;G&quot;. Using their algorithm, Coxeter and Todd showed that certain systems of relations between generators of known groups are complete, i.e. constitute systems of defining relations.

The Todd–Coxeter algorithm can be applied to infinite groups and is known to terminate in a finite number of steps, provided that the index of &quot;H&quot; in &quot;G&quot; is finite. On the other hand, for a general pair consisting of a group presentation and a subgroup, its running time is not bounded by any computable function of the index of the subgroup and the size of the input data.

== Description of the algorithm ==
One implementation of the algorithm proceeds as follows. Suppose that formula_1, where formula_2 is a set of generators and formula_3 is a set of relations and denote by formula_4 the set of generators formula_2 and their inverses. Let formula_6 where the formula_7 are words of elements of formula_4. There are three types of tables that will be used: a coset table, a relation table for each relation in formula_3, and a subgroup table for each generator formula_7 of formula_11. Information is gradually added to these tables, and once they are filled in, all cosets have been enumerated and the algorithm terminates.

The coset table is used to store the relationships between the known cosets when multiplying by a generator. It has rows representing cosets of formula_11 and a column for each element of formula_4. Let formula_14 denote the coset of the &quot;i&quot;th row of the coset table, and let formula_15 denote generator of the &quot;j&quot;th column. The entry of the coset table in row &quot;i&quot;, column &quot;j&quot; is defined to be (if known) &quot;k&quot;, where &quot;k&quot; is such that formula_16.

The relation tables are used to detect when some of the cosets we have found are actually equivalent. One relation table for each relation in formula_3 is maintained. Let formula_18 be a relation in formula_3, where formula_20. The relation table has rows representing the cosets of formula_11, as in the coset table. It has &quot;t&quot; columns, and the entry in the &quot;i&quot;th row and &quot;j&quot;th column is defined to be (if known) &quot;k&quot;, where formula_22. In particular, the formula_23&#x27;th entry is initially &quot;i&quot;, since formula_24.

Finally, the subgroup tables are similar to the relation tables, except that they keep track of possible relations of the generators of formula_11. For each generator formula_26 of formula_11, with formula_20, we create a subgroup table. It has only one row, corresponding to the coset of formula_11 itself. It has &quot;t&quot; columns, and the entry in the &quot;j&quot;th column is defined (if known) to be &quot;k&quot;, where formula_30. In particular, the last entry is &quot;H&quot;, since formula_31.

When a row of a relation or subgroup table is completed, a new piece of information formula_32, formula_33, is found. This is known as a &quot;deduction&quot;. From the deduction, we may be able to fill in additional entries of the relation and subgroup tables, resulting in possible additional deductions. We can fill in the entries of the coset table corresponding to the equations formula_32 and formula_35.

However, when filling in the coset table, it is possible that we may already have an entry for the equation, but the entry has a different value. In this case, we have discovered that two of our cosets are actually the same, known as a &quot;coincidence&quot;. Suppose formula_36, with formula_37. We replace all instances of &quot;j&quot; in the tables with &quot;i&quot;. Then, we fill in all possible entries of the tables, possibly leading to more deductions and coincidences.

If there are empty entries in the table after all deductions and coincidences have been taken care of, add a new coset to the tables and repeat the process. We make sure that when adding cosets, if &quot;Hx&quot; is a known coset, then &quot;Hxg&quot; will be added at some point for all formula_33. (This is needed to guarantee that the algorithm will terminate provided formula_39 is finite.)

When all the tables are filled, the algorithm terminates. We then have all needed information on the action of formula_40 on the cosets of formula_11.

<text>Telenor Denmark is one of the 4 major Danish mobile telephone operators with a customer base in excess of 1.4 million customers. Since 12 February 2004, it has been a subsidiary of the Norwegian mobile telephone company Telenor ASA. Before 15 June 2009, it was known as Sonofon. Sonofon and Cybercity merged in 2006 to form an alliance. On 15 June 2009, the two brands merged and renamed to Telenor. Since December 2014, Telenor has partnered with Swedish operator Telia to deliver a joint mobile network across Denmark.

== History ==
=== Sonofon ===

Sonofon was founded as a company in 1991 as a joint venture between GN Store Nord and BellSouth Corporation. On 9 September that year, Sonofon was awarded the license to operate Denmark&#x27;s first GSM 900 mobile network (while the second GSM license was later awarded to Tele Danmark). Sonofon launched its services in September 1992 and saw its mobile base grow rapidly to half a million users by 1996. On 11 January 1998, Sonofon launched Denmark&#x27;s first prepaid SIM cards, and in 2000 Sonofon launched GPRS on its network.

GN Store Nord sold its 53.1% stake in Sonofon for 13.1 billion DKK on 13 June 2000, and on 10 December 2003, Telenor acquired BellSouth&#x27;s stake for 3.05 billion DKK.

In 2006, Cybercity initiated a tight cooperation with Sonofon, sharing headquarters on Frederikskaj in Copenhagen (where Sonofon&#x27;s main administrative sections are housed), and even going as far as using Sonofon-hired and trained consultants within Sonofon&#x27;s main call centre as a secondary base of customer service operations.

=== Tele2 ===
In May 2007, Telenor announced the purchase of the Danish operations of the competing ISP Tele2, with the Danish commission of monopoly approving the purchase (later the approval was announced to the press, currently the main press release).

=== Cybercity ===

Cybercity was a name of a leading Danish internet service provider owned by Telenor. The company has its own nationwide core network, and serves both consumer and business customers. Cybercity has reported more than 186,000 DSL customers in its report for the first quarter of 2007, with more than 380 employees.

<doc id="894787" wikidata="Q960086" url="?curid=894787" title="Japanese sound symbolism">
<text>The Japanese language has a large inventory of sound symbolic or mimetic words, known in linguistics as ideophones. Such words are found in written as well as spoken Japanese. Known popularly as &quot;onomatopoeia&quot;, these words do not just imitate sounds but also cover a much wider range of meanings; indeed, many sound-symbolic words in Japanese are for things that make no noise originally, most clearly demonstrated by .
==Categories==
The sound-symbolic words of Japanese can be classified into four main categories:
: words that mimic sounds made by living things, like a dog&#x27;s bark (&quot;wan-wan&quot;).
: words that mimic sounds made by objects, like wind blowing or rain falling (&quot;zā-zā&quot;).
: words that depict states, conditions, or manners of the external world (non-auditory senses), such as &quot;damp&quot; or &quot;stealthily&quot;.
: words that depict psychological states or bodily feelings.

These divisions are not always drawn: sound-symbolism may be referred to generally as onomatopoeia (though strictly this refers to imitative sounds, phonomimes); phonomimes may not be distinguished as animate/inanimate, both being referred to as &quot;giseigo&quot;; and both phenomimes and psychomimes may be referred to as &quot;gitaigo&quot;.

In Japanese grammar, sound-symbolic words primarily function as adverbs, though they can also function as verbs (verbal adverbs) with the auxiliary verb , often in the continuous/progressive form , and as adjectives (participle) with the perfective form of this verb . Just like ideophones in many other languages, they are often introduced by a quotative complementizer . Most sound symbolic words can be applied to only a handful of verbs or adjectives. In the examples below, the classified verb or adjective is placed in square brackets.

* Unlike the other examples, &quot;doki doki&quot; is an onomatopoeic word and mimics the sound of two heartbeats.

==Other types==
In their &quot;Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar&quot;, Seiichi Makino and Michio Tsutsui point out several other types of sound symbolism in Japanese, that relate phonemes and psychological states. For example, the nasal sound gives a more personal and speaker-oriented impression than the velars and ; this contrast can be easily noticed in pairs of synonyms such as and which both mean &quot;because&quot;, but with the first being perceived as more subjective. This relationship can be correlated with phenomimes containing nasal and velar sounds: While phenomimes containing nasals give the feeling of tactuality and warmth, those containing velars tend to represent hardness, sharpness, and suddenness.

Similarly, i-type adjectives that contain the fricative in the group &quot;shi&quot; tend to represent human emotive states, such as in the words , , , and . This too is correlated with those phenomimes and psychomimes containing the same fricative sound, for example and .

The use of the gemination can create a more emphatic or emotive version of a word, as in the following pairs of words: , , , and many others.

<doc id="894792" wikidata="Q2701586" url="?curid=894792" title="Failure (band)">
<text>Failure is an American alternative rock band from Los Angeles that was active from 1990 to 1997 and again from 2014 to the present. They have released six full-length albums and five EPs.

==History==
===1990–1997: Formation, &quot;Comfort&quot;, &quot;Magnified&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Planet&quot;===
In 1992, Failure signed with Slash Records (an LA-based independent label whose releases were manufactured and distributed by Warner Bros. in the United States), and went to Minnesota to record their debut album with producer Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studio that summer. &quot;Comfort&quot; was released in September 1992, and around this same time, they went on their first of several tours with Tool.

The band were unsatisfied with the sound of &quot;Comfort&quot; and their lack of involvement in the mixing process; they wanted a more flattering, produced sound that went beyond Albini&#x27;s style of essentially documenting a band&#x27;s raw live sound. So when the band went back into the studio in 1993, Andrews and Edwards took on the role of producers themselves. Midway through these sessions, Gauss left the band, so Edwards played some drums himself, until a replacement was found in Kellii Scott. Their second album, &quot;Magnified&quot;, was released in March 1994; a promotional video (the band&#x27;s first) was made for the single &quot;Undone&quot;, but it received little airtime, if any, on any of the traditional music video outlets. Critics took note of the sonic and musical advances achieved on &quot;Magnified&quot;, and other more well-known musicians also began singing Failure&#x27;s praises. That year, they again went on tour with Tool, and during Failure&#x27;s set each night, Tool guitarist Adam Jones joined them onstage to play rhythm guitar on the &quot;Comfort&quot; track &quot;Macaque&quot;.

Anxious to build on the momentum afforded to them by the relative success of &quot;Magnified&quot;, Andrews, Edwards, and Scott began recording again in 1995, this time in a rented home owned by Lita Ford in the hills just outside LA. With the band again producing themselves, and Andrews handling the lion&#x27;s share of the engineering himself, the situation allowed the band to take far more time in recording than they ever had before, and follow their instincts as far as they chose without outside interference. As the recordings neared completion, they received word that their label&#x27;s distribution deal with Warner had expired and would not be renewed. Since Failure was essentially sidelined while the owners of Slash were trying to negotiate a new distribution deal, the band members kept themselves busy with outside projects: Andrews and Edwards (and friends) recorded an album of covers under the name Replicants; Andrews produced albums for Blinker the Star and Molly McGuire (the Kansas City-based rock band, not the LA-based singer-songwriter); Scott did some session work. Meanwhile, the band continued to &quot;unofficially&quot; shop the record to other labels and industry personnel, while hoping that Warner would step up and release the album. In the spring of 1996, Warner did exactly that, agreeing to keep the Slash imprint one last time for Failure, and &quot;Fantastic Planet&quot; was released that August. Guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, a friend and former bandmate of Scott&#x27;s, joined Failure around the time of the album&#x27;s release. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Stuck on You&quot; became a minor alternative-radio hit and achieved light to medium rotation on MTV, but failed to chart significantly. The song peaked at No. 31 on the U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock chart and No. 23 on the Modern Rock chart. Other songs, such as &quot;Saturday Saviour&quot; and &quot;Pitiful&quot;, received some airplay from more adventurous-minded DJs, but no more videos were made for any of the album&#x27;s tracks, and due to the state of disarray at their label at that time, little effort was put into its promotion.

In 1997, the band were asked by friends in the industrial rock band God Lives Underwater to contribute a track for a Depeche Mode tribute album that they were assembling; Failure chose to cover the 1990 hit &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot;, a worldwide smash and Depeche Mode&#x27;s best-selling and most well-known single. The members of Depeche Mode were reportedly very pleased with the album, and with the Failure track particularly; Andrew Fletcher said that he actually prefers their cover over his band&#x27;s original version. That summer, Failure also joined the Lollapalooza tour, during what became the last of that tour&#x27;s travelling years. Originally booked to headline the side stage, Failure was promoted to also perform on the main stage to fill the void created when Korn dropped out; Failure played both an early afternoon set on the main stage and a longer headlining set in the evening on the side stage for the remainder of the tour.

On November 19, 1997, Failure officially announced that they had disbanded, citing personal differences.

===1997–2013: Post-breakup work===
Ken Andrews has gone on to become a well-known producer, engineer, and mixer, and has been involved in several different music projects. ON (1999–2002) was more or less a solo project, and was not unlike Failure, in terms of songwriting, but the overall sound was more based on electronics, with less emphasis on guitars and the typical heavy rock sound. Year of the Rabbit (2002–2004) saw Andrews&#x27; return to the four-piece rock band format, alongside ON&#x27;s touring drummer, Tim Dow, and former members of National Skyline and Cupcakes; the harder-rocking sound of YotR is much closer to that of Failure, but the band lost momentum and eventually went on indefinite hiatus after their label, Elektra Records, was ostensibly shut down by in the wake of its merger with Atlantic Records. Throughout all of this, Andrews has become increasingly sought-after for his production and mixing skills, and his résumé has expanded to include work on albums by Pete Yorn, Paramore, Candlebox, Tenacious D, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, and Mae, among many others. Also notable is his participation in the production of &quot;You Know My Name&quot;, the theme for the 2006 James Bond movie &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, performed by then-former Soundgarden/Audioslave frontman Chris Cornell. Currently, Andrews is performing as a solo artist, as well as collaborating in a self-described &quot;digital band&quot; called Los Angeles Digital Noise Academy, whose loose membership also includes Brad Laner (Medicine), Sharky Laguana (Creeper Lagoon), Charlotte Martin (whom Andrews married in 2005), Jordon Zadorozny (Blinker the Star) and others. He released his first solo album, &quot;Secrets of the Lost Satellite&quot;, in 2007. He has also started a label, Dinosaur Fight Records, which has released his solo album and Martin&#x27;s, and has announced their intention to release the forthcoming LADNA album, as well.

Greg Edwards collaborated with fellow musicians Chris Pitman, Brad Laner, and Paul D&#x27;Amour in the psychedelic pop outfit Lusk, releasing the album Free Mars in 1997. In 2000, Edwards formed the band Autolux in with vocalist/bassist Eugene Goreshter and former Ednaswap drummer Carla Azar. Their self-produced, self-released 2001 EP &quot;Demonstration&quot; brought them to the attention of legendary producer T Bone Burnett, who used his vanity label DMZ to secure them a contract with Sony BMG Music Entertainment and produced their debut album, &quot;Future Perfect&quot;, which was released in October 2004 to general critical praise. They were hand-picked by Trent Reznor to open for Nine Inch Nails&#x27; North American arena tour in the autumn of 2005, playing bottom of the bill before Queens of the Stone Age. In 2006, they collaborated on a few tracks with the British musical outfit Unkle, for Unkle&#x27;s 2007 release, War Stories. After various delays, Autolux released their second album, Transit Transit, in 2010.

Kellii Scott joined Blinker the Star after Failure&#x27;s breakup, and then joined Campfire Girls for their 2003 album, &quot;Tell Them Hi&quot;. Scott also played on a track titled &#x27;Best Friend&#x27; by Size 14 bassist Robt Ptak on his solo project Artificial Joy, Ptak put this on his own personal reverbnation page in 2013. As of 2005, he was playing drums for both Veruca Salt and Enemy. In 2008, his most recent band The Brontosaur released their self-titled album. From 2008 to 2012 Kellii could be heard playing on all Linda Perry&#x27;s recording sessions, most notably Christina Aguilera&#x27;s song &quot;You Lift Me Up&quot; and Courtney Love&#x27;s &quot;Letter To God&quot;. And in 2013 he worked with the Dr Dre and a 72 piece orchestra at Capitol studios for a song on his upcoming album.

Troy Van Leeuwen first resurfaced in the original lineup of A Perfect Circle, appearing on their debut album, Mer De Noms (2000), and on the subsequent tour. During the sessions for APC&#x27;s second album, Van Leeuwen was extended an invitation to join Queens of the Stone Age, which he accepted; he does appear on three tracks on the second APC album, &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; (2003), but the included cover of Failure&#x27;s &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; is not one of them. He has remained with Queens of the Stone Age since then, first appearing on the tour for their 2002 album, &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;, but not on the album itself. Also, during this time, Van Leeuwen assembled Enemy, a vehicle in which he is the front man and guitarist; their debut album, &quot;Hooray for Dark Matter&quot;, was released in October 2005. In 2008 Van Leeuwen formed the band Sweethead with vocalist Serrina Sims, who also provided backing vocals on Queens of the Stone Age single Make It wit Chu on the album Era Vulgaris, in 2007. The bands roster was rounded up with Norm Block formerly of Plexi and Troy&#x27;s former Enemy bandmate Eddie Nappi.

In 2004, although the band had been inactive for many years, Andrews and Edwards got together to collaborate on a CD/DVD set entitled &quot;Golden&quot;, which collects demos, outtakes, touring footage, both of the band&#x27;s videos, and other rare material from the band&#x27;s active period. Another posthumous compilation, a 2-CD set titled &quot;Essentials&quot;, was assembled for release in 2006; the first disc contains selected tracks from Failure&#x27;s three studio albums, and the second disc features the first official CD release of all four songs from their two pre-Slash singles, and the complete demos for &quot;Magnified&quot;. In 2008, a tribute album to Failure was released titled: &quot;A Tribute to Failure: The Nurse Who Loved Me.&quot; On June 8, 2010, Fantastic Planet was planned to be released on a 2LP vinyl set for the first time from Warner Bros. Both Magnified and Comfort were released on LP for the first time in the second half of 2011 by ORG Music (Magnified was delayed until late 2013). The 2010 limited LP release of Fantastic Planet were in such high demand, that they were fetching hundreds of dollars online. In 2016 as part of their pledge project for &quot;The Heart Is A Monster&quot;, the band re-released Fantastic Planet on vinyl once more.

===2013–2017: Reunion, &quot;Tree of Stars&quot;, &quot;The Heart is a Monster&quot;===
Failure announced their reunion in late 2013. With the &quot;classic lineup&quot; of Greg Edwards, Ken Andrews and Kellii Scott, they performed their first show since 1997 at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles on February 13, 2014. The members had said they had heard rumors that they were even more beloved now than in the 90s, and decided to see if it was true, and the show sold out in less than 5 minutes, which had never happened in the 90s. It was subsequently announced that the band would open for Tool on their upcoming tour.

After the first leg, starting in March and culminating with the &quot;Cinquanta&quot; shows on May 10 and 11 at The Greek Theater in Los Angeles, Failure&#x27;s separate &quot;Tree of Stars&quot; tour took place during May and June 2014 for 18 performances. A tour exclusive EP entitled &quot;Tree of Stars&quot; was available during this leg. The EP contains 4 live tracks and their first new song since &quot;Fantastic Planet&quot;, entitled &quot;Come Crashing&quot;. On May 14, Failure released the track on their Bandcamp following with &quot;The Focus&quot; on July 14, 2014. Failure commenced work on their fourth album in late 2014, which was significant as their first album in over eighteen years.

On March 30, Failure announced their fourth studio album &quot;The Heart Is a Monster,&quot; spanning 18 tracks, which was released on June 30 through INgrooves. This announcement coincided with the release of the new single &quot;Hot Traveler,&quot; which the band debuted at SXSW earlier that month. Troy Van Leeuwen was not cited as returning to the band, however, he contributed guitar work on several tracks and would participate in its October 2015 tour.

In 2016 Failure announced an October tour where they would be playing Fantastic Planet in its entirety to celebrate the album&#x27;s 20 year anniversary. On Thanksgiving 2016, Failure announced they&#x27;d be releasing Fantastic Planet live, using tracks recorded during the Fantastic Planet Anniversary tour. On December 8, 2017, Failure&#x27;s Slash Records albums were acquired by PIAS Recordings, as part of Warner Music Group&#x27;s divestment of artist catalogues to indie labels.

===2018–present: &quot;In The Future...&quot; EP/LP Releases and &quot;Wild Type Droid&quot;===
On March 14, 2018, Failure announced a series of four EPs, with the first, &quot;In The Future&quot;, released on March 30. The remaining three will be released throughout 2018 and will eventually culminate in a complete full-length studio album later in the year. The second EP, &quot;Your Body Will Be&quot;, was released on May 25, 2018, and the third, &quot;The Furthest Thing&quot;, was released on September 14, 2018.
. The finished album, titled &quot;In The Future Your Body Will Be The Furthest Thing From Your Mind&quot; was released on November 16, 2018, with the completion of the fourth and final EP, &quot;From Your Mind&quot;. In support of the new album, Failure embarked on a 29 city tour starting March 11, 2019 and ending April 24, 2019. They were joined by Swervedriver as a co-headlining act on the tour.

While Failure had previously financed two projects, the 2015 album &quot;The Heart is a Monster&quot; and the 2016 live album &quot;Fantastic Planet Live&quot;, using the crowdfunding website PledgeMusic, the band announced in March 2019 that they were not paid at the end of a similar crowdfunding campaign for &quot;In The Future...&quot;. The band advised supporters to seek remedies from their credit card companies as PledgeMusic declared bankruptcy in May 2019. Andrews said that, following the PledgeMusic bankruptcy, major label artists were refunded but independent and self-funded musicians were left out.

On December 16, 2019, Failure announced their vinyl box set Failure 1992–1996, which includes their albums &quot;Comfort&quot;, &quot;Magnified&quot;, and &quot;Fantastic Planet&quot;. The band was to embark on 2020 residency shows in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City in support of its release, however the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the cancellation of all dates.

On July 3, 2020, the band released a re-recorded cover of &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot;, titled &quot;Enjoy the Silence 2020&quot; for sale on Bandcamp. Failure had originally covered the song in 1998 for the tribute album &quot;For the Masses&quot; and re-recorded the song due to the album being hard to find, being out of print for several years and not available on streaming sites. Ken Andrews stated that Failure received the blessing of Depeche Mode for the updated cover.

As of December 2021, Failure moved their digital releases to Bandcamp going forward, including prior albums released with Ingrooves &amp; Slash Records. On February 1, 2022, Failure released a statement that they would be removing their music from Spotify due to policies regarding COVID vaccine misinformation and artist royalties. Albums under Rhino Records, who purchased the rights to Slash&#x27;s back catalog, remains on the service.

Ken Andrews appeared on a podcast by Shiner&#x27;s Allen Epley on April 26, 2021, stating that Failure was currently working on music for an upcoming album. The band&#x27;s sixth studio LP, &quot;Wild Type Droid&quot;, was released on December 3, 2021. On January 12, 2022, Failure announced a tour to support the new album during June &amp; July 2022. Debuting at the &quot;Wild Type Droid&quot; tour, a documentary of the band was announced with interview footage previewed in place of an opening act. The footage was shot as far back as 2016 (of note, Matt Pinfield before the December 2018 accident that incapacitated him for months). It was announced that the producers turned over the footage of the incomplete project to Failure as of 2023.

The concert film &quot;We Are Hallucinations&quot; featuring performances from the band&#x27;s Wild Type Droid tour was released to Veeps on December 15, 2022. A blu-ray version was released on July 6, 2023.

==Musical style==
Musically, the band has been described as alternative rock, art rock, space rock, post-grunge and alternative metal. However in December 2021, Edwards stated that the band may be leaning away from the space rock themes and iconography in their future work. Failure has cited a number of bands as influences, including the Beatles, Pink Floyd, and the Cure.

<doc id="894795" wikidata="Q645694" url="?curid=894795" title="Digastric muscle">
<text>The digastric muscle (also digastricus) (named &quot;digastric&quot; as it has two &#x27;bellies&#x27;) is a bilaterally paired suprahyoid muscle located under the jaw. Its posterior belly is attached to the mastoid notch of temporal bone, and its anterior belly is attached to the digastric fossa of mandible; the two bellies are united by an intermediate tendon which is held in a loop that attaches to the hyoid bone. The anterior belly is innervated via the mandibular nerve (cranial nerve V), and the posterior belly is innervated via the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). It may act to depress the mandible or elevate the hyoid bone.

The term &quot;digastric muscle&quot; refers to this specific muscle even though there are other muscles in the body to feature two bellies.

==Anatomy==
The digastric muscle consists of two muscular bellies united by an intermediate tendon. The posterior belly is longer than the anterior belly. The two bellies of the digastric muscle have different embryological origins - the anterior belly is derived from the first brachial arch and the posterior belly from the second brachial arch - and consequently differ in their innervation (the former being innervated via CN V and the latter via CN VII).

=== Structure ===

==== Posterior belly ====
The posterior belly attaches at the mastoid notch of the temporal bone (which is located upon the inferior surface of the skull, medial to the mastoid process of the temporal bone - between the mastoid process and the styloid process of the temporal bone).

It extends anteroinferiorly from its osseous attachment toward the intermediate tendon.

==== Anterior belly ====
The anterior belly attaches at the digastric fossa of mandible (situated at the base of the mandible near the midline).

It extends inferoposteriorly from its origin toward the intermediate tendon.

==== Intermediate tendon ====
The two bellies meet at the intermediate tendon which perforates the stylohyoideus muscle. The tendon is embraced by a fibrous sling which attaches the body and greater cornu of hyoid bone. The tendon occasionally features a synovial sheath.

=== Innervation ===
The anterior belly receives motor innervation from the mylohyoid nerve (a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve, which is in turn a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3)).

The posterior belly is supplied by the digastric branch of facial nerve.

===Relations===
The posterior belly is situated posterior to the parotid gland and the facial nerve.

==== Triangles of the neck ====
The digastric muscle divides the anterior triangle of the neck into four smaller triangles: the submandibular triangle (digastric triangle), the carotid triangle, the submental triangle (suprahyoid triangle), and the inferior carotid triangle (muscular triangle). 

===Variation===
The intermediate tendon may be absent. The posterior belly may arise partly (by an supplemental strip of muscle) or entirely from the styloid process of the temporal bone. It may be connected by a muscle slip to the middle or inferior constrictor.

The anterior belly may be double, or extra slips from this belly may pass to the jaw or mylohyoideus or decussate with a similar slip on opposite side. It may be absent and posterior belly inserted into the middle of the jaw or hyoid bone. It may fuse with the mylohyoid muscle.

The tendon may pass in front, more rarely behind the stylohyoideus. The mentohyoideus muscle passes from the body of hyoid bone to chin.

=== Actions/movements ===
The muscle depresses the mandible, and may elevate the hyoid bone. 

It depresses the mandible when the hyoid bone is held in place (by the infrahyoid muscles).

==Function==
The digastric muscle is involved in any complex jaw action such as speaking, swallowing, chewing, and breathing. The posterior belly is particularly functionally involved in swallowing and chewing.

==Other animals==

The digastric muscles are present in a variety of animals, specific attachment sites may vary. For example, in the orangutan, the posterior digastric attaches to the mandible rather than the hyoid.

<text>The Centre Democrats (, CD) were a Danish political party.

==History==
The party was formed in 1973 by Erhard Jakobsen, a former MP and mayor of Gladsaxe, as a centrist splinter group from the Danish Social Democrats. It participated in both centre-right governments (1982–1988) and centre-left governments (1993–1996).

In the 2001 election, it lost its parliamentary representation, a severe setback for the party. In the 2005 election, it got 33,635 votes (1% of votes nationwide). It also ran in several municipalities in the Danish municipal election in November 2005. It also ran in simultaneous elections to the new Regional Councils, except in Region Midtjylland, where a local party official forgot to hand in the required number of voters&#x27; signatures before the deadline closed.
On 26 January 2008, an extraordinary party conference decided to dissolve the party by 1 February 2008.

<text>Vnukovo, formally Vnukovo Andrei Tupolev International Airport (named after Andrei Tupolev) () , is a dual-runway international airport located in Vnukovo District, southwest of the centre of Moscow, Russia. It is one of the four major airports that serve Moscow, along with Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo, and Zhukovsky.

In 2019, the airport handled 24.01 million passengers, representing an increase of 12% compared to the previous year. Vnukovo was the eleventh-busiest airport in Europe in 2021 but had a strong decline in traffic and dropped to 30th place in 2022 as a consequence of sanctions following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==History==


Vnukovo is Moscow&#x27;s oldest operating airport. It was opened and used for military operations during the Second World War but became a civilian facility after the war. Its construction was approved by the Soviet government in 1937 because the older Khodynka Aerodrome (located much closer to the city centre, but closed by the 1980s) was becoming overloaded.

On 15 September 1956, the Tupolev Tu-104 jetliner made its first passenger flight from Moscow Vnukovo to Irkutsk via Omsk.

On 4 November 1957, a plane carrying Romanian Workers&#x27; Party officials, including the most prominent politicians of Communist Romania (Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Chivu Stoica, Alexandru Moghioroș, Ştefan Voitec, Nicolae Ceauşescu, Leonte Răutu, and Grigore Preoteasa), was involved in an accident at Vnukovo Airport. Preoteasa, who was the minister of foreign affairs at the time, was killed, as was the aircraft&#x27;s crew. Several others were seriously injured.

The first passenger flights of the IL-18 (Moscow to Alma-Ata on 20 April 1956) and Tu-114 (Moscow to Khabarovsk on 24 April 1961) were also made from Vnukovo Airport. In 1980, Vnukovo was expanded because of the 22nd Summer Olympic Games. In 1993, Vnukovo Airport became a joint-stock company.

A massive reconstruction and strategic development programme commenced at Vnukovo International in late 2003, following the transfer by the federal government of the controlling stake in the airport to the government of Moscow.

As part of the Airport Strategic Development Plan, these projects were completed between 2003 and 2005:

* April 2004: New Terminal B was opened. The terminal currently handles international passengers, but in the future, it will be converted to handle domestic flights or to fulfill any other dedicated functions to be determined at a later date. The terminal&#x27;s total floor space offering stands at ), allowing for an annual passenger throughput capacity of four million.
* August 2005: Vnukovo&#x27;s express rail link to Kiyevsky Rail Terminal was opened.
* December 2010: New Terminal A was opened.
* Summer 2016: All flights served by Terminal B were transferred into Terminal A, and Terminal B was closed.

Vnukovo is Europe&#x27;s busiest airport for international flights by larger private planes.

==Location and capacity==
Of the three Moscow airports, Vnukovo is the highest ( above sea level), so in case of fog, it has frequently served as an alternative airport.

The airfield has two intersecting runways of and in length. Each runway is wide, with -wide safety shoulders on each side. The joint runway capacity is 60 aircraft movements per hour. Runway 24 is mostly used for departures, while Runway 01 is for landings.

The airport has two passenger terminals (Terminal A and Terminal B), one general aviation terminal (for charter and business flights), one cargo terminal, and 60 aircraft stands.

The airport can handle a maximum of 10,100 passengers per hour, and 4,000 people are employed there. In 2013, the airport handled almost 11.18 million passengers, representing a 15.3% increase compared to 2012. In February 2014 the airport handled 722,500 passengers, an increase of 23.8% compared to February 2013, partly attributed to expansion by Utair.

Vnukovo Airport is equipped with a VIP hall, which is used by many political leaders and important people visiting Russia. The Russian President also uses Vnukovo&#x27;s VIP facility. The Tupolev airliner rework facility is located at the edge of the airport, and major overhaul and modification programmes are carried out in several large aircraft hangars. On the northern perimeter of the airport, the government VIP transport wing is located, operating head-of-state flights for high-ranking government officials. Thus, the airport is occasionally closed for regular flights when VIP flights arrive or depart.

==Further expansion==
The prospective development programme was intended to last until 2015, and was aimed at transforming Vnukovo International into a highly competitive air transportation hub of international significance – one that would offer a comprehensive range of quality services to both its passengers and its tenant carriers.

A new international passenger Terminal A will have a total floor space of and passenger throughput capacity of 7,800 passengers per hour, making a total capacity of 18–20 million passengers annually. This will open up many opportunities for the tenant airlines to expand and improve the quality of their customer service at the airport, and ensure the introduction of international-quality service and comfort overall. The sprawling terminal building will be located on the site of the existing domestic passenger terminal, and will also serve as a springboard for the subsequent development of the entire adjacent landside area both next to the terminal and further out towards Vnukovo Settlement. The oldest of the Vnukovo passenger terminals, dating back to 1941, will be demolished by the time construction of the new one goes ahead (it was started to be dismantled in November 2005). The existing domestic Terminal 2, built in the late 1970s, will continue in operation until its eventual demolition during the final phase of construction and replacement with the new terminal.

The expansion plans include lengthening one of the two V-configured runways ( and long) to and upgrading the instrument landing system from the present CAT II to CAT III. The existing taxiways are to be extended as part of the expansion and new ones will also be built, along with a brand new control tower, an extension to the cargo terminal, and a multistory car park.

==Terminals==

Terminal A is the only terminal used both for domestic and international flights. Terminals B and D are out of service as of October 2017.

<text>A dictionary coder, also sometimes known as a substitution coder, is a class of lossless data compression algorithms which operate by searching for matches between the text to be compressed and a set of strings contained in a data structure (called the &#x27;dictionary&#x27;) maintained by the encoder. When the encoder finds such a match, it substitutes a reference to the string&#x27;s position in the data structure.

== Methods and applications ==
Some dictionary coders use a &#x27;static dictionary&#x27;, one whose full set of strings is determined before coding begins and does not change during the coding process. This approach is most often used when the message or set of messages to be encoded is fixed and large; for instance, an application that stores the contents of a book in the limited storage space of a PDA generally builds a static dictionary from a concordance of the text and then uses that dictionary to compress the verses. This scheme of using Huffman coding to represent indices into a concordance has been called &quot;Huffword&quot;.

In a related and more general method, a dictionary is built from redundancy extracted from a data environment (various input streams) which dictionary is then used statically to compress a further input stream. For example, a dictionary is built from old English texts then is used to compress a book.

More common are methods where the dictionary starts in some predetermined state but the contents change during the encoding process, based on the data that has already been encoded. Both the LZ77 and LZ78 algorithms work on this principle. In LZ77, a circular buffer called the &quot;sliding window&quot; holds the last &quot;N&quot; bytes of data processed. This window serves as the dictionary, effectively storing &quot;every&quot; substring that has appeared in the past &quot;N&quot; bytes as dictionary entries. Instead of a single index identifying a dictionary entry, two values are needed: the &quot;length&quot;, indicating the length of the matched text, and the &quot;offset&quot; (also called the &quot;distance&quot;), indicating that the match is found in the sliding window starting &quot;offset&quot; bytes before the current text.

LZ78 uses a more explicit dictionary structure; at the beginning of the encoding process, the dictionary is empty. An index value of zero is used to represent the end of a string, so the first index of the dictionary is one. At each step of the encoding process, if there is no match, then the last matching index (or zero) and character are both added to the dictionary and output to the compressed stream. If there is a match, then the working index is updated to the matching index, and nothing is output.

LZW is similar to LZ78, but, the dictionary is initialized to all possible symbols. The typical implementation works with 8 bit symbols, so the dictionary &quot;codes&quot; for hex 00 to hex FF (decimal 255) are pre-defined. Dictionary entries would be added starting with code value hex 100. Unlike LZ78, if a match is not found (or if the end of data), then only the dictionary code is output. This creates a potential issue since the decoder output is one step behind the dictionary. Refer to LZW for how this is handled. Enhancements to LZW include handing symbol sizes other than 8 bits and having reserved codes to reset the dictionary and to indicate end of data.

<doc id="894820" wikidata="Q637288" url="?curid=894820" title="Balkan sprachbund">
<text>The Balkan sprachbund or Balkan language area is an ensemble of areal features—similarities in grammar, syntax, vocabulary and phonology—among the languages of the Balkans. Several features are found across these languages though not all apply to every single language. The Balkan sprachbund is a prominent example of the sprachbund concept.

The languages of the Balkan sprachbund share their similarities despite belonging to various separate language family (genetic) branches. The Slavic, Hellenic, Romance, Albanian and Indo-Aryan branches all belong to the large Indo-European family, and the Turkish language is non-Indo-European.

Some of the languages use these features for their standard language (i.e. those whose homeland lies almost entirely within the region) whilst other populations to whom the land is not a cultural pivot (as they have wider communities outside of it) may still adopt the features for their local register.

While some of these languages may share little vocabulary, their grammars have very extensive similarities; for example:

* They have similar case systems, in those that have preserved grammatical case and verb conjugation systems.
* They have all become more analytic, although to differing degrees. 
* Some of those languages mark evidentiality, which is uncommon among Indo-European languages, and was likely inspired by contact with Turkish.

The reason for these similarities is not a settled question among experts. Genetic commonalities, language contact, and the geopolitical history of the region all seem to be relevant factors, but many disagree over the specifics and degree of these factors.

==History==
The earliest scholar to notice the similarities between Balkan languages belonging to different families was the Slovenian scholar Jernej Kopitar in 1829. August Schleicher (1850) more explicitly developed the concept of areal relationships as opposed to genetic ones, and Franz Miklosich (1861) studied the relationships of Balkan Slavic and Romance more extensively.

Nikolai Trubetzkoy (1923), Kristian Sandfeld-Jensen (1926), and Gustav Weigand (1925, 1928) developed the theory in the 1920s and 1930s.

In the 1930s, the Romanian linguist Alexandru Graur criticized the notion of “Balkan linguistics,” saying that one can talk about “relationships of borrowings, of influences, but not about Balkan linguistics”.

The term &quot;Balkan language area&quot; was coined by the Romanian linguist Alexandru Rosetti in 1958, when he claimed that the shared features conferred the Balkan languages a special similarity. Theodor Capidan went further, claiming that the structure of Balkan languages could be reduced to a standard language. Many of the earliest reports on this theory were in German, hence the term &quot;Balkansprachbund&quot; is often used as well.

==Languages==

The languages that share these similarities belong to five distinct branches of the Indo-European languages:

* Indo-European languages
** Albanian
*** Tosk
*** Gheg
** Eastern Romance
*** Aromanian
*** Northern Romanian
**** Eastern Romanian
***** Megleno-Romanian
***** Romanian
**** Istro-Romanian
** Hellenic 
*** Greek
** Indo-Aryan 
*** Romani
** South Slavic
*** Eastern South Slavic 
****Bulgarian
****Macedonian
****Torlakian
***Western South Slavic 
****Serbo-Croatian
****Slovenian
In 2000, the Finnish linguist Jouko Lindstedt computed a Balkanization factor, which gives each Balkan language a score proportional to the number of features shared in the Balkan language area. The results were:

Another language that may have been influenced by the Balkan language union is the Judaeo-Spanish variant that used to be spoken by Sephardi Jews living in the Balkans. The grammatical features shared (especially regarding the tense system) were most likely borrowed from Greek.

==Origins==
The source of these features as well as the directions have long been debated, and various theories were suggested.

===Paleo-Balkan===
Early researchers, including Kopitar, believed they must have been inherited from the Paleo-Balkan languages (e.g. Illyrian, Thracian and Dacian) which formed the substrate for modern Balkan languages. But since very little is known about Paleo-Balkan languages, it cannot be determined whether the features were present. The strongest candidate for a shared Paleo-Balkan feature is the postposed article.

===Greek===
Another theory, advanced by Kristian Sandfeld in 1930, was that these features were an entirely Greek influence, under the presumption that since Greece &quot;always had a superior civilization compared to its neighbours&quot;, Greek could not have borrowed its linguistic features from them. However, no ancient dialects of Greek possessed Balkanisms, so that the features shared with other regional languages appear to be post-classical innovations. Also, Greek appears to be only peripheral to the Balkan language area, lacking some important features, such as the postposed article. Nevertheless, several of the features that Greek does share with the other languages (loss of dative, replacement of infinitive by subjunctive constructions, object clitics, formation of future with auxiliary verb &quot;to want&quot;) probably originated in Medieval Greek and spread to the other languages through Byzantine influence.

===Latin and Romance===
The Roman Empire ruled all the Balkans, and local variation of Latin may have left its mark on all languages there, which were later the substrate to Slavic newcomers. This was proposed by Georg Solta. The weak point of this theory is that other Romance languages have few of the features, and there is no proof that the Eastern Romans were isolated for enough time to develop them. An argument for this would be the structural borrowings or &quot;linguistic calques&quot; into Macedonian from Aromanian, which could be explained by Aromanian being a substrate of Macedonian, but this still does not explain the origin of these innovations in Aromanian. The analytic perfect with the auxiliary verb &quot;to have&quot; (which some Balkan languages share with Western European languages), is the only feature whose origin can fairly safely be traced to Latin.

===Multiple sources===
The most commonly accepted theory, advanced by Polish scholar Zbigniew Gołąb, is that the innovations came from different sources and the languages influenced each other: some features can be traced from Latin, Slavic, or Greek languages, whereas others, particularly features that are shared only by Romanian, Albanian, Macedonian and Bulgarian, could be explained by the substratum kept after Romanization (in the case of Romanian) or Slavicization (in the case of Bulgarian). Albanian was influenced by both Latin and Slavic, but it kept many of its original characteristics.

Several arguments favour this theory. First, throughout the turbulent history of the Balkans, many groups of people moved to another place, inhabited by people of another ethnicity. These small groups were usually assimilated quickly and sometimes left marks in the new language they acquired. Second, the use of more than one language was common in the Balkans before the modern age, and a drift in one language would quickly spread to other languages. Third, the dialects that have the most &quot;balkanisms&quot; are those in regions where people had contact with people of many other languages.

==Features==

===Grammatical features===

====Case system====
The number of cases is reduced, several cases being replaced with prepositions, the only exception being Serbo-Croatian. In Bulgarian and Macedonian, on the other hand, this development has actually led to the loss of all cases except the vocative.

A common case system of a Balkan language is:

* Nominative
* Accusative
* Dative/genitive (merged)
* Vocative

=====Syncretism of genitive and dative=====
In the Balkan languages, the genitive and dative cases (or corresponding prepositional constructions) undergo syncretism.

&quot;Example:&quot;
=====Syncretism of locative and directional expressions=====
Note: In Romanian this is an exception, and it only applies when referring to individual countries, e.g. &#x27;, &#x27;, etc. The rule is that &quot;into&quot; translates as ”&#x27;” when trying to express destination, e.g. &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;&quot;, etc. but even in this case the same preposition is used to express direction and location.

====Verb tenses====

===== Future tense =====
The future tense is formed in an analytic way using an auxiliary verb or particle with the meaning &quot;will, want&quot;, referred to as de-volitive, similar to the way the future is formed in English. This feature is present to varying degrees in each language. Decategorization is less advanced in fossilized literary Romanian &#x27; and in Serbo-Croatian &#x27;, where the future marker is still an inflected auxiliary. In modern Greek, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Albanian, Aromanian, and spoken Romanian, decategorization and erosion have given rise to an uninflected tense form, where the frozen third-person singular of the verb has turned into an invariable particle followed by the main verb inflected for person (compare Rom 1.sg. &#x27;, 2.sg. &#x27;, 3.sg. &#x27; &gt; invariable &#x27; &gt; mod. &#x27;). Certain Torlakian dialects also have an invariant future tense marker in the form of the proclitic third-person-singular present form of the verb &#x27;to want&#x27;: &#x27; () &#x27;I will see&#x27;, &#x27; () &quot;you will see&quot;, &#x27; () &#x27;he/she/it will see&#x27;.
=====Analytic perfect tense=====
The analytic perfect tense is formed in the Balkan languages with the verb &quot;to have&quot; and, usually, a past passive participle, similarly to the construction found in Germanic and other Romance languages: e.g. Romanian &#x27; &quot;I have promised&quot;, Albanian &#x27; &quot;I have promised&quot;. A somewhat less typical case of this is Greek, where the verb &quot;to have&quot; is followed by the so-called (&#x27;invariant form&#x27;, historically the aorist infinitive): . However, a completely different construction is used in Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian, which have inherited from Common Slavic an analytic perfect formed with the verb &quot;to be&quot; and the past &quot;active&quot; participle: , &#x27; (Bul.) / , &#x27; (Ser.) - &quot;I have promised&quot; (lit. &quot;I am having-promised&quot;). On the other hand, Macedonian, the third Slavic language in the sprachbund, is like Romanian and Albanian in that it uses quite typical Balkan constructions consisting of the verb &quot;to have&quot; and a past passive participle (, &quot;&quot; = &quot;I have promised&quot;). Macedonian also has a perfect formed with the verb &quot;to be&quot;, like Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian.

=====Renarrative mood=====
The so-called renarrative mood is another shared feature of the Balkan languages, including Turkish. It is used for statements that are not based on direct observation or common knowledge, but repeat what was reported by others. For example, Патот бил затворен in Macedonian means &quot;The road was closed (or so I heard)&quot;. Speakers who use the indicative mood instead and state &quot;Патот беше затворен&quot; imply thereby that they personally witnessed the road&#x27;s closure.

=====Avoidance or loss of infinitive=====
The use of the infinitive (common in other languages related to some of the Balkan languages, such as Romance and Slavic) is generally replaced with subjunctive constructions, following early Greek innovation.

* in Bulgarian, Macedonian and Tosk Albanian, the loss of the infinitive is complete
* in demotic (vernacular) Greek, the loss of the infinitive was complete, whereas in literary Greek (&quot;Katharevousa&quot;, abolished in 1976) it was not; the natural fusion of the vernacular with &quot;Katharevousa&quot; resulted in the creation of the contemporary common Greek (Modern Standard Greek), where the infinitive, when used, is principally used as noun (e.g. &quot;speaking, fluency, eloquence&quot;, &quot;writing&quot;, &quot;being&quot;, etc.) deriving directly from the ancient Greek infinitive formation. But its substitution by the subjunctive form when the infinitive would be used as a verb is complete. Most of the times, the subjunctive form substitutes the infinitive also in the cases when it would be used as a noun (e.g. / &quot;to go, the act of going&quot;, / &quot;to see/be seeing, the act of seeing&quot; instead of the infinitive &quot;&quot;, etc.)
* in Aromanian and Southern Serbo-Croatian dialects, it is almost complete
* in Gheg Albanian, the infinitive, constructed by the particle &quot;me&quot; plus the past participle, is in full use
* in standard Romanian (prepositional phrase: &#x27; + verb stem) and Serbo-Croatian, the infinitive shares many of its functions with the subjunctive. In these two languages, the infinitive will always be found in dictionaries and language textbooks. However, in Romanian, the inherited infinitive form (&#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27;) is now used only as a verbal noun.
* Turkish as spoken in Sliven and Šumen has also almost completely lost the infinitive, but not verbal nouns using the same grammatical form. This is clearly due to the influence of the Balkan sprachbund.

For example, &quot;I want to write&quot; in several Balkan languages:

But here is an example of a relict form, preserved in Bulgarian:
====Bare subjunctive constructions====
Sentences that include only a subjunctive construction can be used to express a wish, a mild command, an intention, or a suggestion.

This example translates in the Balkan languages the phrase &quot;You should go!&quot;, using the subjunctive constructions.
====Morphology====

=====Postposed article=====
With the exception of Greek, Serbo-Croatian, and Romani, all languages in the union have their definite article attached to the end of the noun, instead of before it. None of the related languages (like other Romance languages or Slavic languages) share this feature, with the notable exception of the northern Russian dialects, and it is thought to be an innovation created and spread in the Balkans. It is possible that postposed article in Balkan Slavic is the result of influence from Eastern Romance languages (Romanian or Aromanian) during the Middle Ages. However, each language created its own internal articles, so the Romanian articles are related to the articles (and demonstrative pronouns) in Italian, French, etc., whereas the Bulgarian articles are related to demonstrative pronouns in other Slavic languages.
=====Numeral formation=====
The Slavic way of composing the numbers between 10 and 20, e.g. &quot;one + on + ten&quot; for eleven, called superessive, is widespread. Greek does not follow this.
Albanian has preserved the vigesimal system, which is considered to be an remnant from a Pre-Indo-European language. The number 20 is described &quot;njëzet and 40 as &quot;dyzet. In some dialects &#x27; &#x27;60&#x27; and &#x27; &#x27;80&#x27; still may be used. All other Balkan languages lack at this.

=====Clitic pronouns=====
Direct and indirect objects are cross-referenced, or doubled, in the verb phrase by a clitic (weak) pronoun, agreeing with the object in gender, number, and case or case function. This can be found in Romanian, Greek, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Albanian. In Albanian and Macedonian, this feature shows fully grammaticalized structures and is obligatory with indirect objects and to some extent with definite direct objects; in Bulgarian, however, it is optional and therefore based on discourse. In Greek, the construction contrasts with the clitic-less construction and marks the cross-referenced object as a topic. Southwest Macedonia appears to be the location of innovation.

For example, &quot;I see George&quot; in Balkan languages:
Note: The neutral case in normal (SVO) word order is without a clitic: &quot;.&quot; However, the form with an additional clitic pronoun is also perfectly normal and can be used for emphasis: &quot;.&quot; And the clitic is obligatory in the case of a topicalized object (with OVS-word order), which serves also as the common colloquial equivalent of a passive construction. &quot;.&quot;

=====Adjectives=====
The replacement of synthetic adjectival comparative forms with analytic ones by means of preposed markers is common. These markers are:
*Bulgarian: 
* Macedonian: (prepended)
*Albanian: &quot;më&quot;
*Romanian: &quot;mai&quot;
*Modern Greek: πιο (pió)
*Aromanian: &quot;(ca)ma&quot;

Macedonian and Modern Greek have retained some of the earlier synthetic forms. In Bulgarian and Macedonian these have become proper adjectives in their own right without the possibility of [further] comparison. This is more evident in Macedonian: виш = &quot;higher, superior&quot;, ниж = &quot;lower, inferior&quot;. Compare with similar structures in Bulgarian: = &quot;(the) higher, (the) superior&quot; ( = &quot;(the) [more] higher, (the) [more] superior&quot;; &quot; = &quot;(the) ([most]) highest, supreme&quot;; (also spelled as sometimes) = &quot;low, lower, inferior&quot;, it can also possess further comparative or superlative as with &quot; above.

Another common trait of these languages is the lack of suppletive comparative degrees for the adjective &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;, unlike other Indo-European languages.

=====Suffixes=====
Also, some common suffixes can be found in the language area, such as the diminutive suffix of the Slavic languages (Srb. Bul. Mac.) &quot;-ovo&quot; &quot;-ica&quot; that can be found in Albanian, Greek and Romanian.

===Vocabulary===

====Loanwords====
Several hundred words are common to the Balkan union languages; the origin of most of them is either Greek, Bulgarian or Turkish, as the Byzantine Empire, the First Bulgarian Empire, the Second Bulgarian Empire and later the Ottoman Empire directly controlled the territory throughout most of its history, strongly influencing its culture and economics.

Albanian, Aromanian, Bulgarian, Greek, Romanian, Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian also share a large number of words of various origins:

====Calques====
Apart from the direct loans, there are also many calques that were passed from one Balkan language to another, most of them between Albanian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Greek, Aromanian and Romanian.

For example, the word &quot;ripen&quot; (as in fruit) is constructed in Albanian, Romanian and (rarely) in Greek (&quot;piqem&quot;, &quot;a (se) coace&quot;, ψήνομαι), in Turkish &quot;pişmek&quot; by a derivation from the word &quot;to bake&quot; (&quot;pjek&quot;, &quot;a coace&quot;, ψήνω).

Another example is the wish &quot;(∅/to/for) many years&quot;:

&quot;Note&quot;: In Old Church Slavonic and archaic Eastern South Slavic dialects, the term сполай(j) ти (spolaj ti) was commonly used in meaning &quot;thank you&quot;, derived from the Byzantine Greek (is polla eti).

Idiomatic expressions for &quot;whether one &lt;verb&gt; or not&quot; are formed as &quot;&lt;verb&gt;-not-&lt;verb&gt;&quot;. &quot;Whether one wants or not&quot;:

This is also present in other Slavic languages, e.g. Polish &quot;chcąc nie chcąc&quot;.

===Phonetics===
The proposed phonological features consist of:
*the presence of an unrounded central vowel, either a mid-central schwa or a high central vowel phoneme
**&quot;ë&quot; in Albanian; &quot;ъ&quot; in Bulgarian; &quot;ă&quot; in Romanian; &quot;ã&quot; in Aromanian
**In Romanian and Albanian, the schwa is developed from an unstressed 
***Example: Latin &quot;camisia&quot; &quot;shirt&quot; &gt; Romanian &quot;cămașă&quot; , Albanian &quot;këmishë&quot; )
**The schwa phoneme occurs across some dialects of the Macedonian language, but is absent in the standard.
*some kind of umlaut in stressed syllables with differing patterns depending on the language.
**Romanian:
***a mid-back vowel ends in a low glide before a nonhigh vowel in the following syllable.
***a central vowel is fronted before a front vowel in the following syllable.
**Albanian: back vowels are fronted before &quot;i&quot; in the following syllable.
*The presence of or but not 

This feature also occurs in Greek, but it is lacking in some of the other Balkan languages; the central vowel is found in Romanian, Bulgarian, some dialects of Albanian, and Serbo-Croatian, but not in Greek or Standard Macedonian.

Less widespread features are confined largely to either Romanian or Albanian, or both:
*frequent loss of &quot;l&quot; before &quot;i&quot; in Romanian and some Romani dialects
*the alternation between &quot;n&quot; and &quot;r&quot; in Albanian and Romanian.
*change from &quot;l&quot; to &quot;r&quot; in Romanian, Greek and very rarely in Bulgarian and Albanian.
*the raising of &quot;o&quot; to &quot;u&quot; in unstressed syllables in Bulgarian, Romanian and Northern Greek dialects.
*change from &quot;ea&quot; to &quot;e&quot; before &quot;i&quot; in Bulgarian and Romanian.

Not all linguists agree there are any phonological features associated with Balkan sprachbund.

<text>Frederick Warren Kelly (September 12, 1891 – May 7, 1974) was an American athlete, winner of 110 m hurdles at the 1912 Summer Olympics.

Born in Beaumont, California, Fred Kelly attended Orange High School. He was a freshman at University of Southern California when he was selected to the US 1912 Olympic team.

At Stockholm, Kelly won his preliminary heats easily and qualified to the final with four more Americans and one representative from Great Britain. From the start, the five Americans ran even until the eighth hurdle, where Kelly and James Wendell spun ahead to decide the winner. Kelly got in front the instant before the tape was broken to win by 0.1 seconds. He also competed for the USA in an exhibition baseball tournament in Stockholm.

Kelly was the AAU Champion in hurdles in 1913 and finished second in 1916 and 1919. Kelly also finished first at the 1915 AAU Championships but was disqualified for knocking down four hurdles.

Kelly served in the United States Army in World War I and later became a pioneering aviator, carrying mail for Western Air Express and training Army pilots during World War II.

Beginning on March 19, 1949, he served as the first President of the SoCal Olympians and Paralympians.

Fred Kelly died in Medford, Oregon, aged 82.

A stadium near where he attended Orange High School in Orange, California has been named after him, Fred Kelly Stadium, which is located next to El Modena High School.

The &quot;belt&quot; terminology was first applied to growing regions for various crops, which often follow lines of latitude because those are more likely to have similar climates. The allusion was to a long clothing belt, as seen on a map.

The usage has expanded to other climatic, economic, and cultural concentrations. These regions are not formally defined; they frequently overlap and have vague borders. The terminology is also used outside the U.S. (e.g. India&#x27;s Hindi Belt).

<text>Chen Zaidao (, 24 January 1909 – 6 April 1993) was a Chinese general in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, who commanded the Wuhan Military Region from 1954 to 1967. He is most noted for having arrested pro-Mao Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li during the Wuhan Incident in July 1967. He was promptly dismissed after the incident, but was rehabilitated in 1972 and entered the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in 1978.

During the Tiananmen Square protests of spring 1989, Chen Zaidao joined former Minister of Defense Zhang Aiping and five other retired generals in opposing the enforcement of martial law by the Army in Beijing.

<doc id="894850" wikidata="Q3518502" url="?curid=894850" title="Ravi Shastri">
<text>Ravishankar Jayadritha Shastri (born 27 May 1962) is an Indian cricket commentator, former professional cricketer and head coach of the India national cricket team. As a player, he played for the India national cricket team between 1981 and 1992 in both Test matches and One Day Internationals. Although he started his career as a left arm spin bowler, he later transformed into a batting all-rounder. Shastri was a member of the Indian team that won the 1983 Cricket World Cup. He won the C. K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award at the Indian cricket team annual award show NAMAN in 2024.

As a cricketer, Shastri was essentially defensive with his trademark &quot;chapathi&quot; (a flick off the pads), but he could raise his strike rate when required. Due to his above-average height (he stood 6&#x27; 3&quot; tall) and an upright stance, he had a limited number of shots against fast bowling, but was able to put the lofted shot to good use against spin bowling. Ravi played either as an opening batsman or in the middle order.

The highlight of his career was when he was elected Champion of Champions in the World Championship of Cricket in Australia in 1985. In the same season, on 10 January 1985, he equaled West Indian Garry Sobers&#x27;s record of hitting six sixes in an over in first class cricket. He was regarded as a potential captain, but his image outside cricket, injuries and tendency to lose form at crucial times meant that he captained India in only one Test match.

In domestic cricket, he played for Bombay and led them to the Ranji Trophy title in his final year of playing. He also played four seasons of county cricket for Glamorgan. He was forced to retire aged 31 due to a recurring knee injury. He has done commentary on behalf of BCCI in the matches that India play. In 2014, he became the director of Indian cricket team for a period of eight months from India&#x27;s tour of England until the 2015 World Cup. On 13 July 2017, he was appointed as the head coach of Indian cricket team. On 16 August 2019, he was re-appointed as the head coach of the senior men&#x27;s Indian team and remained in charge until the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup.

== Personal life ==
Ravi Shastri is of Mangalorean descent, was born in Bombay and studied at Don Bosco High School. As a teenager, he took to cricket seriously. Playing for Don Bosco (Matunga), Shastri reached the final of the 1976 inter-school Giles Shield, finally losing to St Mary&#x27;s, whose lineup included two future Ranji players, Shishir Hattiangadi and Jignesh Sanghani. The next year, under Shastri&#x27;s captaincy, Don Bosco won the Giles Shield in 1977, the first time in the history of that school. At school, his coach was B. D. Desai, once a Tatas and Dadar Union player. While Don Bosco was not traditionally a major force in schools cricket, the R. A. Podar College, where Shastri later studied commerce, produced many good cricketers. Vasant Amladi and, in particular, V. S. &quot;Marshall&quot; Patil, were integral figures in Shastri&#x27;s development as a cricketer.

When not in Mumbai, Shastri lives in Alibaug.

On 18 March 1990, Shastri married Ritu Singh. They have one daughter named Alekha Shastri. After 22 years of marriage, Shastri filed for divorce.

==Domestic career==
In his last year at the junior college, he was selected to represent the Bombay team in the Ranji Trophy. At 17 years and 292 days, he was then the youngest cricketer to play for Bombay.
An Indian under-19 team was scheduled to tour Pakistan in 1980–81. Shastri was included in the coaching camp at the last minute by the National Coach Hemu Adhikari. Shastri captained one of the two teams in a trial game and was then asked to lead the Indian Under-19 team. The tour, however, was cancelled. The team later went to Sri Lanka, but the games were frequently interrupted by rain.

His only notable achievement in his first two Ranji seasons were bowling figures of 6-61, which he took against Delhi in the 1979–80 Ranji final that Bombay lost. While he was playing against Uttar Pradesh at Kanpur in the next season, he was called up to the squad touring New Zealand to stand in for the injured left arm spinner Dilip Doshi. Shastri arrived in Wellington the night before the first Test. His first over in Test cricket was a maiden to the New Zealand captain Geoff Howarth. In the second innings, he took 3 wickets in four balls, all to catches by Dilip Vengsarkar, to bring a quick close to the New Zealand innings. In the third Test, his seven wickets won him the man of the match award, while his 15 wickets in the series were the highest for either side.

The Ranji final of 1984/85 turned out to be one of the finest matches in Indian domestic cricket history. A sleepy Gavaskar won the toss and batted. He could hardly close his eyes before Bombay was 3 down for 42. Batting at No.5, he scored his 20th and last Ranji Trophy hundred and took Bombay to 333. Shastri made 29 before he was bowled attempting to cut an arm–ball. Delhi was in early trouble before they were rescued by Chetan Chauhan, batting with a fractured finger in his last first class match. Ajay Sharma, in his first season, scored a hundred and took Delhi into the lead with nine wickets down.

The rules of the competition specified that in the event of a draw, the team with the first innings lead would be declared the winners. With two days and 100 minutes left, Bombay went for quick runs. A crowd of about 46,000 turned up for match on the fourth day and the organizers ran out of tickets. Shastri top scored with 76 as Bombay set Delhi 300 to win in a day and ninety minutes.

Except for the odd delivery, the ball spun slowly and afforded enough time for the batsmen to play their strokes. Early on the final day, Delhi reached 95 for no loss and then collapsed. His first wicket was Chauhan who was declared out caught behind with the ball having spun across the face of the bat without apparently touching it. The match changed dramatically and the batsmen lost their head. Gursharan Singh was lbw playing no stroke, Kirti Azad played on, Surinder Khanna was stumped after a few slogs. Shastri took 8 for 91; Bombay won by 90 runs. In the 50th year of Ranji trophy, it was their 30th title.

After the tour of Australia in 1985–86, he also began to decline as a bowler. Bombay lost to Haryana in the semifinal of the Ranji trophy but West Zone won the Duleep Trophy. His major contribution was as a bowler in the semifinal against North Zone on a flat wicket at Trivandrum. Like in the Ranji final, North looked the likely winner going into the last day, before he took 8 for 145.

He scored hundreds in the quarterfinal and semifinal of the Duleep trophy, but West Zone lost to South on first innings lead in the latter match. Shastri&#x27;s only other score over fifty in the season was a particularly dull 125 against Pakistan in the Jaipur Test. He did well enough to be the man of the one day series. In the first one-day match against Pakistan he captained India for the first time, scoring 50 and taking three wickets. He took four wickets at Calcutta and 69* at Hyderabad in two thrilling finishes. Later at Nagpur with India facing a big target, he scored 52 in 40 balls.

In 1987, Glamorgan contracted Shastri to play for them. He stayed with them until 1991, with a break in 1990 due to India&#x27;s tour of England. Shastri&#x27;s presence did little for the fortunes of the county which finished at the bottom of the first class table in two of those seasons. Shastri topped 1000 runs in 1989 and scored hundreds in both innings against Middlesex. His best bowling performance of 7 for 49 (11 for 90) in the match came against Lancashire in 1988, where he got bounce and turn and was &#x27;unplayable&#x27; according to Wisden. The almanack noticed that Shastri was already becoming reluctant to bowl.

1988 was by far the best of the seasons for Glamorgan in one day matches. They finished 5th in the Sunday League – up from 14 in 1987 – and reached the semifinal of the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup. Shastri won the leading six hitter award for the Sunday league matches of 1988 with 14 sixes. He was part of the MCC team that played a Rest of the World team in the MCC bicentennial match at Lord&#x27;s in 1987.

Bombay breezed through the West Zone league of the 1993–94 Ranji Trophy winning all four matches – a very rare feat – by big margins. With the Test players away, Shastri captained the young team in the knockout matches. Bombay defeated Haryana by an innings and 202 runs in the pre quarter final but ran into trouble against Karnataka in the next round. Against 406, Bombay lost their first six for 174, before Shastri and Sairaj Bahutule added 259 in six hours. Shastri&#x27;s individual score was 151. Bombay survived the best part of the last day to win on first innings lead. Shastri scored 612 runs in the season and took 17 wickets at 15. Bombay went on to beat Bengal in a low scoring final to lift the Ranji Trophy. It was their first championship since the famous win against Delhi nine years ago.

In September 1994, while in Sri Lanka covering the Singer World Series, Shastri announced his retirement from first class cricket.

==International career==
===Early days===
Within eighteen months of his Test debut, Shastri had moved up from tenth position in the batting order to being an opening batsman. &quot;His calm, sensible batting lower in the order&quot;, wrote Wisden, commenting on his first series, &quot;raised promise of his developing into a useful all-rounder, and his fielding too was an asset&quot;. By the end of his career, he had batted in every position from one to ten. By his own admission, he ignored his bowling in favour of his batting. This was reflected in his performances. However, his figures of 9–101 in the season-opening 1981 Irani Trophy stood as a tournament record for nearly twenty years.

It was the failure of the regular openers Pranab Roy and Ghulam Parkar that led to Shastri being made to open at the Oval against England in 1982. He distinguished himself by scoring 66 runs in that match. An injury in the webbing of his hand ruled him out of four of the Tests to be played in Pakistan. Forced again to open in the final Test at Karachi, against the fast bowling of Imran Khan (then at the peak of his career), he scored his first Test hundred. He later made another hundred against the West Indies in Antigua. &quot;Indian Cricket&quot; was impressed enough to suggest that, given time, he could become one of the best batsmen in the Indian team.

Shastri was not selected to play in most of the important matches in the 1983 World Cup. In the series against the West Indies later that year, he again distinguished himself with his bold effort in batting against the domineering West Indian pace bowlers.

===The glorious winter===
In October 1984, India toured Pakistan for the third time in six years. The Lahore Test saw India collapse to 156 against Pakistan&#x27;s 428, and follow on. India went into the last day trailing by 92 with six wickets in hand but were saved by a fifth wicket partnership of 126 between Shastri and Mohinder Amarnath. Shastri scored 71, while Amarnath made 101*. Shastri was even more successful in the next Test at Faisalabad, where he scored 139 and shared a stand of 200 with Sandeep Patil. The last Test and the remainder of the tour were cancelled because of the assassination of Indira Gandhi.

There were already signals that Shastri was being groomed as a future captain. Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar was coming to the end of his career and Kapil Dev, who had led India in the previous season, was expected to succeed him. Shastri appeared to be the next in line. He led the Young India side to Zimbabwe in early 1984. Against the touring English side in November, he led the India Under–25 to an innings win - the first defeat of England in a tour match in India for fifty years.

Around this time, Shastri also began to open the innings regularly in one day games. He scored 102 against Australia in October – India&#x27;s second hundred in ODIs – and made the same score against England at Cuttack in December. Shastri had stood in for Gavaskar and opened with Srikkanth in two matches of the 1983 World Cup. The third time that they opened was at Cuttack and they set a world record of 188 for the first wicket. Later in the season, this partnership was to form the foundation for the Indian triumph in the WCC in Australia.

Shastri&#x27;s success continued in Test matches against England. In the Bombay Test his 235 run stand with wicket-keeper Syed Kirmani led to victory for India. His 142 improved upon the 139 at Faisalabad as his highest score.

In the third Test at Kolkata, Shastri made 111 in 357 balls and 455 minutes, though his innings was heavily interrupted by rain. With Mohammad Azharuddin he added 214 for the fifth wicket, another Indian record. When India started the second innings late in the final day, he was sent in to open, thus becoming one of the few batsmen to bat on all five days of a Test.

Shastri set another record for Bombay against Baroda in a West Zone Ranji match. His first hundred came up in 72 minutes and 80 balls and included nine fours and four sixes. The second took just 41 minutes and 43 balls. His 123 ball, 113-minute 200* became the fastest double hundred in first class history, beating the previous record by 7 minutes, and included 13 fours and 13 sixes. Six of the sixes came off a single over of the left arm spinner Tilak Raj. In terms of the number of sixes, it bettered the 58-year-old Indian record of CK Nayudu who had struck 11 sixes against a touring MCC team at Bombay Gymkhana in 1926–7. Shastri&#x27;s unfinished sixth wicket stand of 204* with Ghulam Parkar, who contributed only 33 to the partnership, took only 83 minutes. In Baroda&#x27;s second innings, Shastri took two wickets in four overs.

===World Championship of Cricket - 1985===
Except for a few series in Pakistan and the 1983 World Cup final, the World Championship of Cricket in Australia was the first time overseas cricket matches were shown live in India. The WCC saw India win every match convincingly. The WCC was conceived as a celebration of the 150th year of the formation of Victoria, but the finalists turned out to be India and Pakistan.

Shastri had a slow start to the tournament but finished with fifties in the last three matches. Srikkanth too scored three fifties and India posted century opening stands against Australia and in the final. India went in with two spinners for every match. It helped that all the matches were played at Melbourne and Sydney which have turning tracks and long boundaries. Sivaramakrishnan and Shastri claimed 18 wickets between them in five matches.

For his 182 runs and 8 wickets, Shastri was chosen as the man of the series which in this tournament was called &#x27;The Champion of Champions&#x27;. He won an Audi 100 car for his efforts. By the special order of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Indian customs waived the heavy duty its import would have normally entailed.

===Vice-Captaincy 1985===
Two weeks later India won the Rothman&#x27;s cup in Sharjah beating Pakistan and Australia. The victory against Pakistan was particularly memorable because India defended a total of only 125. Shastri and Siva continued their successful partnership with the ball. It was for this tournament that Shastri served as the Indian vice captain for the first time. Gavaskar had announced his decision to resign his captaincy at the end of the WCC before the tournament began. Before the final, former Australian captain Ian Chappell suggested that for the good of Indian cricket, Gavaskar should continue as the captain until Shastri could take over from him.

Shastri continued as vice captain to Kapil Dev in the 1985–86 season. This season and the England tour of 1986 were ordinary ones for him. Australia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan toured India in 1986–87. Shastri played a crucial role in the Tied Test at Madras against Australia, scoring 62 and 48*. When Indian middle order collapsed and India fell behind the run rate, his two sixes in quick succession off off–spinner Greg Matthews came in handy. In the final Test at Bombay he scored 121*. As was becoming increasingly common, it was played in first and fourth gear. He hung around for around 30 minutes for the last run for his fifty and twice as long in the nineties. Yet he hit six sixes, three of which came after he completed his hundred. The huge six off left arm fast bowler Bruce Reid – a cross batted heave that went over longon – was particularly memorable. Six sixes in an innings was an Indian record at the time. But he was outshone by Dilip Vengsarkar who scored 164* in the same innings. They added a record 298* for the sixth wicket.

In early 1987, he presented a 15-minute coaching series which went by the name &#x27;That&#x27;s Cricket&#x27;. This was aired on the national channel Doordarshan on Sunday mornings. There were even rumours of an involvement with actress Amrita Singh.

India lost the final Test at Bangalore to lose the 1986–87 series against Pakistan. Kapil Dev was widely criticised in the media for his captaincy. The selectors retained him as captain in the Reliance World Cup at the beginning of the 1987–88 season. Shastri failed with the bat in the Reliance Cup but formed a successful bowling partnership with Maninder Singh, another left arm spinner. India topped its group but went down to England in the semifinal. Kapil Dev received more criticisms for skying a catch to deep midwicket when a win was still a possibility.

===Captaincy issues 1987===
About this time, Vengsarkar emerged as the strongest candidate to take over from Kapil. He had had a dream run with the bat, starting from the series in England in 1986. In 1987, the newly established Deloitte ratings (the forerunner of the current LG ratings) ranked him the best batsman in the world. The Indian selectors have conventionally leaned towards making the best player of the team the captain. So before the home series against West Indies, Kapil was sacked and Vengsarkar was made the Indian captain.

Vengsarkar had his left arm fractured in the third Test and Shastri captained India for the only time in his Test career. On an underprepared turning track in Madras, India won the toss and elected to bat first. Debutant Narendra Hirwani took 16 for 136 as India won by 255 runs to draw the series 1–1. Apart from this, Shastri did little with bat or ball. West Indies won 7 of the eight one day matches, he was the captain in six of them. Vengsarkar meanwhile picked up a six-month ban from BCCI for writing newspaper columns. So Shastri continued as the captain for a three nations tournament in Sharjah in April. Sri Lanka and New Zealand were the other teams and India won easily.

===Sacking and vice captaincy 1989===
India travelled to West Indies in early 1989. Though a failure overall, Shastri played the best innings by either side in the series. It came at Bridgetown in the second Test. India trailed by 56 in the first innings and lost the six second innings wickets for 63. Batting at No.3, Shastri was last out for a courageous 107 out of 251 all out. Looking back at the end of his career, he was to consider this his finest innings. The bowlers were Malcolm Marshall, Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh and Ian Bishop and the pitch, difficult.

On the way back many of the Indian players took part in an exhibition match in United States. BCCI suspended the players. Though the suspension was later revoked, Vengsarkar was sacked. Srikkanth became the new captain and Shastri, yet again, the deputy. After an indifferent series in Pakistan, both were excluded from the tour of New Zealand in 1990. Azharuddin led an experimental team which a selector called the &#x27;team of the nineties&#x27;. Within a few weeks, the phrase got the status of a joke. Shastri was recalled for the tour to England that summer as the vice-captain. 

===The Indian summer===
Shastri&#x27;s career generally remained a struggle until the England tour of 1990 where he scored two hundreds in the three Test rubber. Opening the innings for India, he began with an even 100 in India&#x27;s reply to a huge England score at Lord&#x27;s. It was a hard-working innings and Shastri played and missed often with most of the runs came with his usual flicks and nudges. Towards the end of his innings, he grew aggressive, reaching his hundred by hitting the English off-spinner Eddie Hemmings for two fours and a six in an over, and departed immediately attempting another big hit.

He topped this with 187 at the Oval. Journalist and commentator Harsha Bhogle&#x27;s description of this innings holds true for many of Shastri&#x27;s major efforts:

:Watching Shastri bat is like admiring the Qutub Minar; tall, timeless, solid. You admire it for the virtues, not for its style. For nine hours and 21 minutes, he chiselled away the England attack and the sculpture that he left behind represented perseverance and craft. There was the usual stoic, expressionless face under the helmet, but you could see the determination in his eyes as he planted himself at the wicket, struck root and bore fruit.

: Only occasionally, the bat wavered in its resolve but the mind put it on the right path again, almost in admonishment, and the bat grew broader and straighter ... He may never be a Gavaskar, but he at least represents the great man&#x27;s virtues, even if by proxy. It would be a relief too, to know that he will never throw away his wicket for nobody guards his crease more fiercely.

Following the innings at the Oval, Shastri scored his career best score of 217 in the Irani trophy in the opening match of the Indian season and a top score of 88 on a very bad wicket in the Chandigarh Test against Sri Lanka. He carried his bat for 101* against the same opponents in a one-day match a week later, reaching the hundred with a two off the last ball. Next year in South Africa&#x27;s first-ever ODI series on their return to international cricket, he scored 109 at Delhi, his fourth and last one day hundred. A series of abandoned tours meant India played few matches at home at this time.

At the end of 1991, India travelled to Australia for a five Test series, to be followed by the World Cup. Channel 9 dubbed it &quot;the Indian Summer&quot;. The series was a disaster for India – they lost four of the Tests – and was rife with umpiring controversies. But it also saw the final flourishes in the careers of Shastri and Kapil Dev.

Shastri took 5 wickets for 15 runs against Australia in an early match in the World Series Cup. It was then the best bowling figures by an Indian in ODIs. Most of the wickets were gratuitously earned, though – three batsmen were caught on the legside boundary and another stumped. In the third Test at Sydney, he scored his only double hundred in Test cricket, the first by an Indian against Australia. He was dropped in the sixties by the Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne, who was making his debut, off his own bowling. Amidst frequent interruptions by rain, he completed his hundred early on the fourth day and a six off Warne brought up the 150. He finally fell to a tired shot at Warne after nine and a half hours, scoring 206 with 17 fours and the two sixes, thus becoming Warne&#x27;s first Test wicket.

It was also during this innings that the knee injury that would soon end his career appeared for the first time. India had gone into the match with four pace bowlers and no regular spinners. Shastri was little more than a part-time bowler by this time. By the final day, pitch started taking spin. Shastri took four wickets in the second innings and Australia just about beat the clock to draw the match. India could well have won the match with another spinner.

===Late career===

The remaining WSC matches followed the Sydney Test. In the second final against Australia Shastri worsened the knee injury. At the later stages of the innings he was forced to stand and slog. After a few quick runs, it ended in an inevitable mishit to cover. He missed the remaining two Test matches, both of which India lost. For a while it seemed doubtful that he would be able to play the World Cup which was being hosted by Australia and New Zealand, but was included at the last moment.

In their second match, India chased 238 to win in 50 overs against Australia. A rain interruption meant that the target was revised to 236 in 47 overs. Shastri took 67 balls for his 25; India went on to lose by one run. He was blamed for the defeat and dropped from the remaining matches of the tournament.

In the next season, South Africa hosted India for their first ever tour. Shastri opened in all four Tests and struggled to score runs. The only bright spot was a 16 ball 27 not out, in India&#x27;s one day win at Centurion park. He had batted down the order in the one day matches of this series. In reference to the World Cup innings against Australia, he commented later that for once he knew what his exact role was.

India hosted England immediately after the South Africa series. The knee injury returned before the series and put Shastri out of cricket for eight months. He never again represented India in international cricket.

==Post-retirement==
He made his debut as a TV commentator with the World Masters Tournament in Mumbai in March 1995. In 2003, he collaborated in starting up &quot;Showdiff Worldwide&quot;, a celebrity management company. He has since served ICC and BCCI in temporary official capacities and as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. Some of his temporary shows, such as Super Spells, still run Star Sports and related channels. He and fellow commentator Sunil Gavaskar ended their long-term associations with ESPN-STAR Sports in April 2008 as they were contracted by the BCCI as commentators for lucrative Indian Premier League which was broadcast by rival network Sony Max. 2008 also held great significance for Shastri as he became the father of Alekha at the age of 46. He temporarily coached the Indian cricket team for their 2007 Bangladesh tour. He was named the Celebrity Torchbearer for the Oman Leg of the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay.

==Coaching career==
In July 2017 Shastri, the former team director, was appointed as Head Coach for the national side by the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC), comprising Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman. The contract has him getting paid Rs. 8 crore per year. Rs. 1.5 Crore more than his predecessor Anil Kumble. As the World cup 2019 was in progress, on 13 June, the BCCI announced an extension of Shastri&#x27;s contract by 45 days after the tournament. On 16 August 2019, he was re-appointed as the head coach of the senior men&#x27;s Indian team, with his new contract extending up to the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup in India.

Under the guidance of head coach Ravi Shastri, India achieved one of their most historic Test victories at the Gabba during the 2020-21 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Despite being plagued by injuries and fielding a relatively inexperienced side, Shastri’s leadership played a crucial role in fostering belief and resilience within the team. His strategic approach, combined with his ability to motivate players, helped India chase down 328 runs on the final day, breaking Australia’s 32-year unbeaten streak at the Gabba. The win not only secured a 2-1 series victory but also solidified Shastri’s legacy as one of India’s most successful coaches.

==Legends League Cricket==
In November 2021, Shastri retired from coaching national cricket team and joined the Legends League Cricket as the commissioner.

==In popular culture==
A Bollywood film &quot;Azhar&quot; released in 2016, directed by Tony D&#x27;Souza, revolves around Match fixing scandals in late 90s and 2000 and role of Mohammad Azharuddin in the scandal. Shastri&#x27;s character was portrayed by Gautam Gulati in the film. However, the film portrayed Shastri&#x27;s character in highly negative light as it depicts him as a Womaniser. Due to the negative depiction, Shastri slammed the makers of the film and further said that he has no intentions of watching the movie.

The 2021 Indian film &quot;83&quot;, which is based on India&#x27;s World Cup win, features Dhairya Karwa portraying Shastri&#x27;s character.

<doc id="894899" wikidata="Q1783534" url="?curid=894899" title="Conversion (word formation)">
<text>In linguistics, conversion, also called zero derivation or null derivation, is a kind of word formation involving the creation of a word (of a new part of speech) from an existing word (of a different part of speech) without any change in form, which is to say, derivation using only zero. For example, the noun &quot;green&quot; in golf (referring to a putting-green) is derived ultimately from the adjective &quot;green&quot;.

Conversions from adjectives to nouns and vice versa are both very common and unnotable in English; much more remarked upon is the creation of a verb by converting a noun or other word (for example, the adjective &quot;clean&quot; becomes the verb &quot;to clean&quot;).

==Verbification ==
Verbification, or verbing, is the creation of a verb from a noun, adjective or other word.

===In English===

In English, verbification typically involves simple conversion of a non-verb to a verb. The verbs &quot;to verbify&quot; and &quot;to verb&quot;, the first by derivation with an affix and the second by zero derivation, are themselves products of verbification (see autological word), and, as might be guessed, the term &quot;to verb&quot; is often used more specifically, to refer only to verbification that does not involve a change in form. (Verbing in that specific sense is therefore a kind of anthimeria.)

Many adjectives have become verbs, including adjectives based on Latin passive participles, such as &quot;separate&quot;. Usually, at least now, there is a pronunciation difference between the adjective and the verb. (Later this was extended to forming verbs from Latin passive participles even if they were not used as adjectives.)

Examples of verbification in the English language number in the thousands, including some of the most common words such as &quot;mail&quot; and &quot;e-mail&quot;, &quot;strike&quot;, &quot;salt&quot;, &quot;pepper&quot;, &quot;switch&quot;, &quot;bed&quot;, &quot;sleep&quot;, &quot;ship&quot;, &quot;train&quot;, &quot;stop&quot;, &quot;drink&quot;, &quot;cup&quot;, &quot;lure&quot;, &quot;mutter&quot;, &quot;dress&quot;, &quot;dizzy&quot;, &quot;divorce&quot;, &quot;fool&quot;, &quot;merge&quot;, to be found throughout the dictionary. Thus, verbification is by no means confined to slang and has furnished English with countless new expressions: &quot;access&quot;, as in &quot;access the file&quot;, which was previously only a noun, as in &quot;gain access to the file&quot;. Similar mainstream examples include &quot;host&quot;, as in &quot;host a party&quot;, and &quot;chair&quot;, as in &quot;chair the meeting&quot;. Other formations, such as &quot;gift&quot;, are less widespread but still mainstream.

Verbification may have a bad reputation with some English users because it is such a potent source of neologisms. Although some neologism that are products of verbification may meet considerable opposition from prescriptivist authorities (the verb sense of &quot;&quot; is a well-known example), most such derivations have become so central to the language after several centuries of use that they no longer draw notice.

In many cases, the verbs were distinct from their noun counterparts in Old English, and regular sound change has made them the same form: these can be reanalysed as conversion.

A modern case of zero derivation in slang from popular culture might be seen in , in the noun sense of &quot;awkwardness, inducement of second-hand embarrassment&quot;.

===In other languages===
In Toki Pona, any content word may function as a noun, verb or adjective depending on syntax; for example, &quot;moku&quot; may mean &quot;food&quot; or &quot;to eat&quot;.

==Noun conversion in English==

Many English nouns are formed from unmodified verbs: a fisherman&#x27;s &quot;catch&quot;, to go for a &quot;walk&quot;, &quot;etc.&quot;

==Humor==
Verbification is sometimes used to create nonce words or joking words. Often, simple conversion is involved, as with formations like &quot;beer&quot;, as in &quot;beer me&quot; (&quot;give me a beer&quot;) and &quot;eye&quot;, as in &quot;eye it&quot; (&quot;look at it&quot;). Sometimes, a verbified form can occur with a prepositional particle, e.g., &quot;sex&quot; as in &quot;sex it up&quot; (&quot;make it sexier&quot;).

A &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; strip dealing with this phenomenon concluded with the statement that &quot;Verbing weirds language&quot;, demonstrating the verbing of both &quot;verb&quot; and &quot;weird&quot;. (The former appears in its use as a gerund.)

<text>The AEG R.I or Riesenflugzeug 1 (meaning &quot;giant aircraft&quot;) was a four-engined biplane bomber aircraft of World War I manufactured by AEG.

==Design and development==
The R.I was unusual for a multi-engined aircraft in that rather than connecting propellers directly to the engines and mounting the engines in nacelles, the R.I carried all its engines within the fuselage and turned its propellers via a system of drive shafts. A single prototype was completed and flew in 1916. Initial flights were quite successful, the aircraft being considered very manoeuvrable, but on 3 September 1918, a newly assembled propeller, which had not been given sufficient time for glue to cure, disintegrated. The vibrations resulting from that failure caused the complex transmissions and shafting connecting all four engines to both propellers to tear loose, which then cut a center section strut, resulting in the breakup of the aircraft, killing all seven crew on board. Of the seven further AEG R.1 aircraft planned or under production when the war ended, (R.21, R.22, R.59, R.60, R.61, R.62, R.63 and R.64), only R.21 was finished and R.22 partially complete.
