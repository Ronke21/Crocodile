<text>Léon Daudet (; 16 November 1867 – 2 July 1942) was a French journalist, writer, an active monarchist, and a member of the Académie Goncourt.

==Move to the right==

Daudet was born in Paris. His father was the novelist Alphonse Daudet, his mother was Julia Daudet and his younger brother, Lucien Daudet, would also become an artist. He was educated at the Lycée Louis le Grand, and afterwards studied medicine, a profession which he abandoned. Léon Daudet married Jeanne Hugo, the granddaughter of Victor Hugo, in 1891 and thus entered into the higher social and intellectual circles of the French Third Republic. He divorced his wife in 1895 and became a vocal critic of the Republic, the Dreyfusard camp, and of democracy in general.

Together with Charles Maurras (who remained a lifelong friend), he co-founded (1907) and was an editor of the nationalist, integralist periodical &quot;L&#x27;Action Française&quot;. A deputy from 1919 to 1924, he failed to win election as a senator in 1927 – despite having gained prominence as the voice of the monarchists. When Maurras was released from prison after serving a sentence for verbally attacking Prime Minister Léon Blum, Daudet joined other political leaders Xavier Vallat, Darquier de Pellepoix, and Philippe Henriot to welcome him in the Vel&#x27; d&#x27;Hiv in July 1937.

==Scandals and later life==

When his son Philippe was discovered fatally shot in 1923, Daudet accused the republican authorities of complicity with anarchist activists in what he believed to be a murder, and lost a lawsuit for defamation brought against him by the driver of the taxi in which Philippe&#x27;s body was found. That same year, Germaine Berton carried out an assassination against fellow &quot;Action Française&quot; writer Marius Plateau. Daudet was also a target of this assassination but was not present at the time of the shooting. 

Condemned to five months in prison, Daudet fled and was exiled in Belgium, receiving a pardon in 1930. In 1934, during the Stavisky Affair, he was to denounce Prime Minister Camille Chautemps, calling him the &quot;leader of a gang of robbers and assassins&quot;. He also showed particular detestation for the subsequent Prime Minister Léon Blum, candidate of a coalition of socialists and other parties of the left.

A supporter of the Vichy administration headed by Marshal Pétain, Léon Daudet died in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.

<text>Fairy bread is sliced white bread spread with butter or margarine and covered with hundreds and thousands (colorful round sprinkles), often served at children&#x27;s parties in Australia and New Zealand. It is typically cut into triangles. It is similar to the Dutch Hagelslag, which are normally oblong, chocolate sprinkles a few millimetres long but can also be fruit flavoured (&quot;vruchtenhagel&quot;) served on buttered white bread. The flavor of fairy bread has been compared to Funfetti cake.

==History==
Although people had been putting hundreds and thousands (or nonpareils) on bread and butter for some time, the first known reference to this dish as fairy bread was in the &quot;Hobart Mercury&quot; in April 1929. Referring to a party for child inmates of the Consumptive Sanitorium, the article proclaimed that &quot;The children will start their party with fairy bread and butter and 100s and 1,000s, and cakes, tarts, and home-made cakes...&quot;

The origin of the term is not known, but it may come from the poem &#x27;Fairy Bread&#x27; in Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;A Child&#x27;s Garden of Verses&quot; published in 1885, and had been used for a number of different food items before the current usage.

In April 2021, the satirical group The Chaser created a fabricated online petition calling for the renaming of fairy bread, calling it &quot;offensive&quot;, which resulted in many mainstream news stories.

In November 2021, a Google Doodle was created to celebrate fairy bread.

In 2024 rumours surfaced that Fairy Bread, along with smiley fritz, had been banned from South Australian schools. The SA Education Department subsequently released a statement that this was not the case and that their new guidelines for school canteens were optional.

<doc id="897331" wikidata="Q775456" url="?curid=897331" title="Hárbarðsljóð">
<text>Hárbarðsljóð (Old Norse: &#x27;The Lay of Hárbarðr&#x27;) is one of the poems of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, found in the Codex Regius and AM 748 I 4to manuscripts. It is a flyting poem with figures from Norse Paganism. &quot;Hárbarðsljóð&quot; was first written down in the late 13th century but may have had an older history as an oral poem.

==Synopsis==

In this poem, the ferryman Harbard and the god Thor compete in a flyting or verbal contest with one other. The ferryman Hárbarðr (&quot;Greybeard&quot;) is rude and obnoxious towards Thor who is returning to Asgard after a journey in Jötunheimr, the land of the jötnar. Hárbarðr obstructs his way and refuses him passage across a swollen river. He begins by saying that Thor dresses poorly (in a beggars clothes, without pants) and that his mother is dead. In the course of the poem, Harbard boasts of his sexual prowess, his magical and tactical abilities, asking Thor about his. Thor responds, telling how he defeated Giants. Ultimately, after mocking him at length, Harbard curses Thor and tells him to walk around.

==Structure==
The poem is significantly less structured than most Eddic poems, and is predominantly written in a metric form known as &quot;málaháttr&quot; or &quot;conversational style.&quot; However, other metrical forms are also to be discerned, while some of the text is pure prose. In the last decade, several scholars have concluded that the poem is an intentionally stylized version of the traditional flyting structure.

==Theories==
Some early commentators, such as F. W. Bergmann and Viktor Rydberg argued that Hárbarð was in fact Loki. Although the name Hárbarð means &quot;Grey beard,&quot; in the opening exchange of insults Thor addresses the ferryman as one would speak to a youthful servant. Some believe that Hárbarðr&#x27;s confessed exploits also are allegedly more akin to those of Loki than Odin. However, Hárbarðr repeatedly boasts of his conquests of giantesses, as does Odin in &quot;Havamal.&quot; Loki in &quot;Lokasenna&quot; and Hárbarð in &quot;Hárbarðsljóð&quot; both accuse Thor&#x27;s wife Sif of adultery, a charge that is never denied and may have been commonly known. They also speak identical half-lines, accusing Thor of being unmanly. Despite these arguments, this theory was rejected by later scholars such as Finnur Jónsson, Fredrick Sander, and Felix Niedner, in favor of identifying Hárbarð with Odin, based, among other things, on Odin&#x27;s statement in &quot;Grimnismál&quot; 47 that Hárbarð is one of his by-names.

<doc id="897342" wikidata="Q5693867" url="?curid=897342" title="Heather Has Two Mommies">
<text>Heather Has Two Mommies is a children&#x27;s book written by Lesléa Newman with illustrations by Diana Souza. First published in 1989, it was one of the first pieces of LGBTQ+ children&#x27;s literature to garner broad attention. 

In its early years, &quot;Heather Has Two Mommies&quot; garnered both positive and negative attention due to the lesbian themes present in the book. The book received praise for highlighting the parenthood of lesbian parents, but also drew criticism from people opposed to same-sex parenting, as well as from members of the LGBTQIA+ community who felt the book did not portray same-sex parenthood accurately.

== Summary ==
A child named Heather who is raised by lesbian women: her biological mother, Jane, who gave birth to her after artificial insemination, and her biological mother&#x27;s same-sex partner, Kate. At Heather&#x27;s playgroup, her family situation is discussed simply and positively, as are those of other children in other family units. At first, Heather becomes upset when she realizes that many of her other peers at the playgroup have a daddy and she does not. Molly, the caretaker at the playgroup, ensures that all the children at the playgroup understand that all families are special and no family type is better than any of the others. By the end of the book, Heather&#x27;s sadness goes away and she expresses gratitude for her mothers.

== Background ==
The idea for &quot;Heather Has Two Mommies&quot; was not Newman&#x27;s own. While out for a walk, Newman was approached by lesbian parents and asked to write a children&#x27;s story about a family like theirs. The parents explained that there were no books that they could show their daughter that portrayed the life of a family with lesbian parents. According to &quot;The More Things Change&quot; Newman wrote the story for this purpose, but did not expect the book to gain widespread controversy. 

== Release, republications ==
The book was originally co-published by Newman and her friend Tzivia Gover under the auspices of Gover&#x27;s desktop publishing business, &quot;In Other Words, Ink&quot;. Six months after the book&#x27;s publication in December 1989, it was picked up by Alyson Publications.

Alyson Publishing brought out a Special 20th Anniversary edition in 2010, replacing the original black and white drawings with full-color illustrations by its illustrator Diana Souza, a strategy intended to make the book more modern and kid-friendly. That same year, Alyson Publishing company folded and the book went out of print for some time. 

Later, the book was picked up by Candlewick Publications and the original illustrations were replaced in post-2015 editions by Laura Cornell, who made one of Heather&#x27;s moms look like Lesléa Newman.

== Analysis ==
According to Jennifer Esposito, a professor at Georgia State University, Leslea Newman attempts to normalize the lesbian family structure in &quot;Heather Has Two Mommies&quot; but seems to have done just the opposite. When Heather acknowledges that she does not have a daddy it makes her sad. Esposito argues that because Heather gets upset that she does not have a father instead of wondering why she has two mothers, it portrays that there is a problem with having two mommies. Furthermore, Esposito believes that &quot;Heather Has Two Mommies&quot; &quot;dequeers&quot; lesbian households by making them equivalent to heterosexual households. She believes that this does a disservice to those children that live in those households because their experience in the real world is a lot different than what is portrayed in the story. Esposito thinks that books dealing with lesbian families should take the approach of informing people that these households are just as normal as other households while at the same time addressing the unique problems they face. Similarly, Esposito admonishes the manner in which queer relationships are presented. Rather than focusing on the queer relationship, Heather&#x27;s mothers are used more so as a learning experience for heterosexuals.

According to Jaime Naidoo, a scholar in children&#x27;s queer literature, Newman included the depiction of artificial insemination in the first edition of the book, meaning that this book was the first to portray a lesbian couple deliberately planning the birth of their child. However, Newman later explained her regret in incorporating this detail into the book. Because parents were writing complaints about not reading the book to their children due to the scene, she decided to omit the section altogether in her 10th edition. Many believed the book was aimed at adults because of the artificial insemination sequence, although the book was intended to be child friendly.

Editor Cat Yampell, though &quot;Heather has Two Mommies&quot; has faced backlash and criticism, the book has also received praise. For example, Newman explains that multiple presses have expressed interest in more manuscripts, including queer stories. Seeing as publishers are becoming more comfortable in asking for more queer content, it seems like &quot;Heather has Two Mommies&quot; has helped queer children&#x27;s literature become more accepting.

In addition, researchers argue that books such as &quot;Heather has Two Mommies&quot; can be beneficial in the educational setting. Scholars Brianna Burke and Kristina Greenfield argue that &quot;Heather Has Two&quot; &quot;Mommies&quot; can create a school environment of tolerance and inclusion of members of the LGBTQIA+ community. In addition, scholar Selena Van Horn explains that by presenting elementary school students with books that challenge heteronormativity. They can gain new perspectives on diverse family structures and critically question their prior knowledge on LGBTQIA+ related topics.

==Reception==
The American Library Association ranked it the 9th most frequently challenged book in the United States in the 1990s.

In the 2006 Dav Pilkey book &quot;Captain Underpants and the Preposterous Plight of the Purple Potty People&quot;. In it, the parallel-universe Miss Singerbrains (the school librarian) invites the two main characters, George and Harold, to read the book &quot;Mommy Has Two Heathers&quot;.
=== Challenges ===

According to Leslea Newman, in Fayetteville, North Carolina, people tried to have &quot;Heather Has Two Mommies&quot; banned from local libraries and schools. Newman claims they were unsuccessful in their attempts, and instead paid for advertisements in local newspapers to convince citizens to vote against the construction of 5 new libraries in the Fayetteville area. The advertisements conveyed that the libraries were in &quot;pursuit of legitimizing homosexuality&quot; and compared homosexuality to &quot;prostitution, bestiality or incest&quot;.

According to Jennifer Steele, Assistant Professor of Library and Information Science at The University of Southern Mississippi, another example of an attempted banning of the book took place in Wichita Falls, Texas. Because several residents of the city wanted to ban &quot;Heather Has Two Mommies&quot; and &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Roommate&quot;, the city council declared a resolution that would limit access to the children&#x27;s books should it reach 300 signatures. With the support of the American Civil Liberties Union, a countersuit was brought forth after the book restrictions were enforced, eventually leading to the Sund v. City of Wichita Falls, Texas (2000) court case. As a result, the District Court ruled in favor of the countersuit and allowed both books to be restored to their previous status.

In another instance, the Wasilla Public Library in Alaska also neglected to shelve the same two books, &quot;Heather Has Two Mommies&quot; and &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Roommate&quot;. Ironically, the books were sent in as a gift during Banned Books Week. When citing why the book was barred from the shelves, the library cited the books were &quot;poorly constructed, lacked engaging illustrations and seemed to lack the ability to engage young readers.&quot; The books were later sold in a fundraiser for the library.

=== Support ===
In 1991, Doris Robinson, regional services manager at Fairview Park Regional Library in Cleveland, claims that books such as &quot;Heather Has Two Mommies&quot; should have a place in schools and libraries around the country, &quot;as long as they tastefully, accurately and appropriately portray the subject matter.&quot; Furthermore, Robinson recognizes that keeping LGBTQ subject matter from children would do them a disservice as homosexual couples become a recognized part of society. Robinson asserts that because homosexual families deserve respect, exposing children to &quot;Heather Has Two Mommies&quot; will teach them to be more accepting of these families.

Additionally, researchers April M. Sanders and Janelle B. Mathis from the University of North Texas have concluded that in order to combat censorship and discrimination in LGBTQ+ literature, young readers, instructors, and parents must learn how to change their attitudes toward LGBTQ+ individuals. Due to the reception of &quot;Heather Has Two Mommies&quot;, The National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) issued a resolution (2007) advocating for the inclusion of LGBTQ+ themes in the classroom, as well as standards for teacher training on such inclusions.

<text>The Cladoniaceae are a family of lichen-forming fungi in the order Lecanorales, comprising about 560 species distributed amongst 18 genera. This family is one of the largest among lichen-forming fungi and is globally distributed, from Arctic tundra to tropical rainforests, favouring humid environments while being intolerant of arid conditions. Molecular phylogenetics has significantly advanced the understanding of their complex taxonomic history, revealing intricate evolutionary relationships and leading to a refined classification. Notable members include reindeer moss and cup lichens of the genus &quot;Cladonia&quot;, which consist of about 500 species and forms a significant part of the diet for large mammals in taiga and tundra ecosystems.

A distinctive feature of many Cladoniaceae species is their dimorphic thallus: a scaly or crust-like form and a (shrub-like) secondary form known as a podetium or . These lichens typically grow on soil, decaying wood, or tree trunks, with a few species found on rocks. They form symbiotic associations with green algae, usually from the genus &quot;Asterochloris&quot;. The family is known for its diverse secondary metabolites—over 70 have been identified—which play roles in species identification and ecological functions such as protection against UV radiation and herbivore deterrence. Genomic studies have uncovered significant variation in mitochondrial DNA among Cladoniaceae species, contributing to the understanding of their evolution and diversity.

Some Cladoniaceae species have economic value, particularly in decorative uses such as floral arrangements and model-making due to their unique structures. Six species are included in the International Union for Conservation of Nature&#x27;s Red List of Threatened Species, facing threats from habitat loss, climate change, and human activities. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these vulnerable species.

==Systematics==
===Historical taxonomy===

Before the term &#x27;lichen&#x27; was widely adopted, one of the earliest classification systems for these organisms was developed by the German botanist Johann Jacob Dillenius. In his 1741 system, &quot;Cladonia&quot; species were placed within the genus &quot;Coralloides&quot;. In his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;, Carl Linnaeus formally described several species that are now classified within the Cladoniaceae. Although he initially placed them in the eponymously named genus &quot;Lichen&quot;, a dozen of these species are recognised as belonging to the genus &quot;Cladonia&quot;. Among these was &quot;Cladonia pyxidata&quot;, a representative of the &quot;pixie cup&quot; or &quot;trumpet&quot; lichens—so named for their distinctive shape, as well as some well-known and widespread &quot;Cladonia&quot; species: &quot;C. coccifera&quot;, &quot;C. cornuta&quot;, &quot;C. deformis&quot;, &quot;C. digitata&quot;, &quot;C. fimbriata&quot;, &quot;C. gracilis&quot;, &quot;C. portentosa&quot;, &quot;C. rangiferina&quot;, &quot;C. stellaris&quot;, &quot;C. subulata&quot;, and &quot;C. uncialis&quot;. These 12 species represent about 14% of the 80 &quot;Lichen&quot; species Linnaeus described in his seminal 1753 work.

The German naturalist Jonathan Carl Zenker formally introduced the Cladoniaceae to science in 1827, with his work appearing in a publication edited by Karl Goebel. Zenker&#x27;s initial concept of the family included genera such as &quot;Baeomyces&quot;, &quot;Icmadophila&quot;, and &quot;Stereocaulon&quot;, which have since been reclassified into separate families due to advances in taxonomic understanding. William Nylander included 53 &quot;Cladonia&quot; species worldwide in his 1860 work &quot;Synopsis lichenum&quot;. When Edvard August Vainio published his three-volume monograph on the Cladoniaceae (&quot;Monographia Cladoniarum universalis&quot;, 1887, 1894, and 1897), he included 134 species and subspecies. In his circumscription of the family, the genera &quot;Pycnothelia&quot;, &quot;Cladia&quot;, and &quot;Cladina&quot; were included in the genus &quot;Cladonia&quot;. In recent history, Teuvo Ahti&#x27;s extensive research, including comprehensive monographs and revisions, has significantly advanced the understanding of Cladoniaceae taxonomy and biogeography.

Cladoniaceae is now one of the largest families of lichen-forming fungi, with about 560 species distributed amongst 18 genera. The type genus is &quot;Cladonia&quot;, circumscribed by the Irish physician and botanist Patrick Browne in 1756. He included eight species in his new genus. Of their occurrence, he wrote: &quot;All these species are found in great abundance in the mountains of Liguanea: they grow mostly on the ground, among other sorts of moss, but a few ... species chiefly are found upon the decaying trunks of trees.&quot;

===Etymology and naming===

As is standard practice in botanical nomenclature, the name &quot;Cladoniaceae&quot; is based on the name of the type genus, &quot;Cladonia&quot;, with the ending indicating the rank of family. The genus name comprises the Greek word: (&quot;klādos&quot;), meaning &quot;branch&quot;, &quot;bud&quot;, or &quot;shoot&quot;; and the Latin &quot;-ia&quot;, a suffix commonly used in Latin to form nouns, particularly in taxonomy to denote genera.

It is well known that reindeer feed on lichens, which has led to the widespread but misleading name &quot;reindeer moss&quot;. This common name, along with &quot;reindeer lichen&quot; and &quot;caribou lichen&quot;, is typically applied to the ground-dwelling, mat-forming species that were previously classified in the genus &quot;Cladina&quot;. &quot;Cladonia&quot; species with cup-shaped structures borne at the tips of vertical stalks (podetia) are often known as &quot;pixie cups&quot;. Examples include the &quot;boreal pixie cup&quot; (&quot;C. borealis&quot;), the &quot;finger pixie cup&quot; (&quot;C. digitata&quot;), and the &quot;red-fruited pixie cup&quot; (&quot;C. pleurota&quot;) Additional names alluding to these characteristic structures include the &quot;powdered funnel lichen&quot; (&quot;C. cenotea&quot;), and the &quot;trumpet lichen&quot; (&quot;C. fimbriata&quot;). Some names reference the reddish hue of their fruiting structures, such as &quot;British soldiers&quot; (&quot;C. cristatella&quot;), the &quot;jester lichen&quot; (&quot;C. leporina&quot;), and the &quot;lipstick powderhorn&quot; (&quot;C. macilenta&quot;).

===Phylogenetics===

Molecular phylogenetics studies have significantly advanced the scientific understanding of relationships within the Cladoniaceae, particularly in the large and diverse genus &quot;Cladonia&quot;. Early studies in the early 2000s began to reveal the complexity of relationships within the family, challenging traditional morphology-based classifications. More recent comprehensive analyses have identified 13 major clades within &quot;Cladonia&quot;, providing a framework for understanding the genus&#x27;s evolution and diversity. These clades, while generally well-supported by molecular data, often lack clear morphological synapomorphies (shared physical characteristics inherited from a common ancestor), highlighting the challenges in &quot;Cladonia&quot; taxonomy. Some clades, such as clade Erythrocarpae (characterised by red apothecia) and clade Ochroleucae (with pale ochraceous apothecia), do share distinctive features. However, most clades encompass a wide range of morphological and chemical variation.

Within these clades, several species complexes have been identified, such as the &quot;Cladonia gracilis&quot; group and the &quot;Cladonia humilis&quot; group. These complexes often include morphologically similar species that are difficult to distinguish based on traditional taxonomic characters. Molecular studies have revealed that many of these complexes contain cryptic diversity, with genetically distinct lineages that are not easily recognisable morphologically.

Focused molecular studies have further refined the understanding of specific groups within Cladoniaceae. For instance, detailed analyses of the &quot;Cladonia furcata&quot; complex have revealed high levels of homoplasy (the occurrence of similar traits due to convergent evolution rather than shared ancestry) in the morphological characters traditionally used for species delimitation. Similarly, studies on the &quot;Cladonia cariosa&quot; group and the &quot;Cladonia pyxidata&quot; group have uncovered previously unrecognised diversity and highlighted the need for integrative approaches combining molecular, morphological, and chemical data in species delimitation. These phylogenetic studies have also shed light on biogeographic patterns within Cladoniaceae. For example, some clades show distinct geographic distributions, such as a group of predominantly African species within clade Perviae, while others have more cosmopolitan distributions. Morphologically distinct genera like &quot;Carassea&quot;, &quot;Pycnothelia&quot;, and &quot;Metus&quot; form a sister clade to &quot;Cladonia&quot;. These genera share some morphological and chemical traits, such as dimorphic thalli and the production of atranorin. However, their geographic distributions vary, with &quot;Carassea&quot; being endemic to Brazil, while &quot;Pycnothelia&quot; has a bipolar distribution (i.e., found in the high latitudes of both hemispheres) and &quot;Metus&quot; is found primarily in Australasia.

===Genomics===

Genomic studies have revealed significant variation in the size and structure of mitochondrial DNA in Cladoniaceae, uncovering significant variation in genome size and structure. Within the genus &quot;Cladonia&quot;, mitochondrial genomes span from approximately 45,000 to 66,000 base pairs, consistently containing respiratory genes and ribosomal RNA regions across all examined species. Crustose lichens tend to have smaller mitochondrial genomes compared to their fruticose and foliose counterparts. The genomes often harbour homing endonuclease genes, which may influence genomic evolution. Notably, substantial intraspecific variation has been observed, particularly in widespread species such as &quot;C. rangiferina&quot; and &quot;C. submitis&quot;. Unlike some other symbiotic organisms, Cladoniaceae do not exhibit mitochondrial genome reduction, suggesting complex evolutionary dynamics.

===Synonymy===

Several phylogenetic studies have shown that Cladoniaceae is a member of the order Lecanorales, and is closely related to the family Stereocaulaceae. The family Cetradoniaceae, which was created in 2002 to contain the endangered species &quot;Cetradonia linearis&quot;, was folded into the Cladoniaceae in 2006.

In 2018, Ekaphan Kraichak and colleagues used a technique called temporal banding to reorganise the Lecanoromycetes, proposing a revised system of classification based on correlating taxonomic rank with geological (evolutionary) age. They synonymised the families Squamarinaceae and Stereocaulaceae with the Cladoniaceae, resulting in a large increase in the number of genera and species. The Squamarinaceae had already been included in the Cladoniaceae by previous authors. Although this reorganisation has been used in some later publications, the folding of the Stereocaulaceae into the Cladoniaceae was not accepted in a recent analysis. Robert Lücking highlighted that merging the two families under the name Cladoniaceae is not permissible without a formal conservation proposal because Stereocaulaceae, established in 1826, predates Cladoniaceae, which was established in 1827. According to the rules of botanical nomenclature, the earliest validly published name has priority and must be used when two families are combined unless an exception is granted. This means that if the families were merged without a conservation proposal, the combined family would have to be named Stereocaulaceae due to its earlier establishment. In a 2021 treatment of the British and Irish Cladoniaceae, the authors also keep these families separate, noting &quot;both families are monophyletic and easily distinguishable on both morphological and molecular terms&quot;.

==Description==

The thallus (body) of Cladoniaceae lichens often have a unique structure known as growth, where two distinct forms develop simultaneously within the same organism. The , which can be short-lived () or long-lasting, grows close to the surface and may appear crusty, leafy, or scaly. From this base, a typically grows upright, bearing the reproductive structures (ascomata). This secondary growth can range from a few millimetres to over 25 centimetres (10 inches) in height. Due to this dual structure, the overall appearance of these lichens can be either fruticose (bushy) or foliose (leafy). However, some species in this family do not develop either the primary thallus or the upright structures, showing variations within the group. As for vegetative propagules, isidia occur rarely in this family, whereas soredia are common.

The ascomata are in the form of an apothecium, and are , meaning they are of the type – light in colour and soft in consistency. They often have a reduced margin. Their colour is typically dark brown (sometimes pale brown), red, ochraceous, or black. The (referring to all hyphae between the asci in the hymenium) consists of sparsely branched paraphyses, and is amyloid, indicating that stains blue to blue-black with iodine-based reagents. The asci (spore-bearing cells) are somewhat , meaning they have two layers that separate during ascus dehiscence. The ascus structure consists of an and a tube (both of which are amyloid), which is cylindrical to (club-shaped). number eight per ascus, and they are usually non-septate (lacking internal partitions), ellipsoid to more or less spherical in shape, hyaline (translucent), and non-amyloid. Except for a few genera that produce septate ascospores (&quot;Calathaspis&quot;, &quot;Pycnothelia&quot; and &quot;Pilophorus&quot;), the hymenium does not generally have that are useful in taxonomy. The conidiomata (asexual fruiting bodies) are in the form of pycnidia; the conidia (asexual spores) are non-septate, usually (thread-like), and hyaline.

===Chemistry===

In the Cladoniaceae, over 70 different secondary metabolites (lichen products), primarily polyphenols, have been identified. These substances crucial roles in species identification and have ecological functions such as protection against UV radiation and deterrence of herbivores. To observe the fluorescence of certain depsides and depsidones, ultraviolet light is directly applied to the specimens. Traditional colour spot tests with reagents like KOH can be ineffective at low concentrations. Consequently, thin-layer chromatography, a laboratory technique used to separate chemical compounds, is essential for detecting and identifying lichen substances that are present in low concentrations. Chemotaxonomy is an important aspect in the identification of Gray&#x27;s pixie cup (&quot;Cladonia grayi&quot;): when lit by a UV light, it produces a light blue fluorescence.

===Photobionts===

The symbiotic algal partner (photobiont) of most Cladoniaceae taxa are unicellular green algae, usually in the genus &quot;Asterochloris&quot;, but occasionally in the genus &quot;Chlorella&quot;; both of these genera are in the class Trebouxiophyceae. Eleven species of &quot;Asterochloris&quot; have found to be associated with genus &quot;Cladonia&quot;; the algal genus – one of the most common lichen symbionts – occurs in the thalli of more than 20 lichen genera. The most common photobionts in this genus that associate with &quot;Cladonia&quot; are &quot;A. glomerata&quot;, &quot;A. italiana&quot;, and &quot;A. mediterranea&quot;, with some lineages showing dominance in one or several climatic regions. In contrast, &quot;Myrmecia&quot; was shown to be the main photobiont for the Mediterranean species &quot;Cladonia subturgida&quot;. The algal genus &quot;Trebouxia&quot;, a common lichen photobiont, has not been recorded associating with the Cladoniaceae. Some &quot;Pilophorus&quot; species form tripartite associations, involving the fungus, green algae, and cyanobacteria within gall-like structures called cephalodia. The cyanobacterial genera &quot;Nostoc&quot; and &quot;Stigonema&quot; are involved in these tripartite associations. In a study of several &quot;Cladonia&quot; lichens collected from Southern Finland, the associated microbial community, which was found to be consistent amongst the different species, consisted largely of Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteriota.

==Development==

The development of several Cladoniaceae genera have been studied in detail, although the interpretation of results has sometimes been controversial. For example, two 1970 studies by Hans Jahns explored the development of fruiting bodies in &quot;Cladonia&quot;, significant for understanding the taxonomy and phylogeny within the Cladoniaceae. This work revealed two distinct ontogenetic types based on the formation of generative tissue and its role in developing the characteristic podetium of &quot;Cladonia&quot; species. This generative tissue, originating in the thallus horizontalis and growing vertically, is crucial for forming the podetium. The study identified variability within species, showing that different species can have more than one ontogenetic type, challenging previous assumptions about the uniformity of development patterns within the genus. This demonstrated variability had implications for the taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships within Cladoniaceae, suggesting a complex evolution of reproductive structures that did not strictly align with previously conceived taxonomic groupings.

Cladoniaceae species begin development with the formation of a prothallus – a fungal layer upon which an alga-containing thallus will develop. It comprises the hyphae from the germination of an ascospore. After the protothallus contacts the alga, lichenisation begins with the development of small squamules (scale-like thallus segments) that make up the primary thallus, which is squamulose (scaly) or crustose (crustose-like). The secondary thallus consists of vertical structures that are shrubby and hollow, although they can be solid in rare cases. If these structures are made of generative tissue, they are called &quot;podetia&quot;; when they are made of vegetative tissue, they are called &quot;pseudopodetia&quot;. The morphology of these structures determines to a large part the taxonomy of the Cladoniaceae, which can range from simple to complex branching patterns. &quot;Cladonia minisaxicola&quot;, found in the mountains of Bahia (Brazil) is the only species in that large genus that is completely crustose and does not develop podetia.

The tips of the podetia have a wide range of morphology in the Cladoniaceae. They can be straight, tapering from a wide base to a point (called ), or flaring on cup-shaped . The scyphi are sometimes closed, or have a central perforation, forming structures called funnels. The podetia are slow-growing, with an annual growth rate generally ranging from 1 to 15 mm.

Branching in the Cladoniaceae occurs on the podetium, driven by the growth patterns of fungal meristem tissue at its tip. There are two main branching patterns: in one, branches emerge later from a large meristem that changes shape, while in the other, smaller meristems split early but keep their shape. These growth patterns help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships within Cladoniaceae. A shift from isotropous growth (uniform in all directions) to anisotropous growth (different in various directions) allows for more flexibility in development. This transition, from symmetrical to more irregular growth, may signal evolutionary adaptations. Despite these changes, the branching processes remain highly consistent even among species in the family that are not closely related.

==Genera==

After more than a century of discovery and research, including recent advances in understanding revealed by molecular phylogenetics studies, the Cladoniaceae encompass 18 genera and more than 500 species. In terms of species diversity, the Cladoniaceae stood as the tenth-largest lichen-forming fungal family by 2017. This is a list of the genera contained within the Cladoniaceae, based on the Catalogue of Life; this includes taxa formerly classified in the Squamarinaceae, but does not include the Stereocaulaceae. Following the genus name is the taxonomic authority, year of publication, and the number of species:

*&quot;Calathaspis&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Carassea&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Cetradonia&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Cladia&quot; – ca. 27 spp.
*&quot;Cladonia&quot; – ca. 500 spp.
*&quot;Gymnoderma&quot; – 3 spp.
*&quot;Heteromyces&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Metus&quot; – 3 spp.
*&quot;Muhria&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Notocladonia&quot; – 2 spp.
*&quot;Paralecia&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Pilophorus&quot; – 17 spp.
*&quot;Pulchrocladia&quot; – 3 spp.
*&quot;Pycnothelia&quot; – 2 spp.
*&quot;Rexiella&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Sphaerophoropsis&quot; – 2 spp.
*&quot;Squamella&quot; – 1 sp.
*&quot;Thysanothecium&quot; – 3 spp.

&quot;Myelorrhiza&quot; was transferred from the Cladoniaceae to the Ramalinaceae by Sonja Kistenich and colleagues in 2018. &quot;Neophyllis&quot;, originally classified in the Cladoniaceae, was transferred to Sphaerophoraceae in 1999.

==Habitat and distribution==

Cladoniaceae species have been recorded growing in many habitats and on a diversity of substrates, including soil, tree trunks, and rotten wood. In a few cases, Cladoniaceae can grow on rocks, such as &quot;Cladonia salmonea&quot; which grows on the rock faces of vertical cliffs, or &quot;Cladonia pyxidata&quot;, which can grow on thin soil on rocks. Cladoniaceae species are generally absent from arid environments due to their preference for humid conditions. The range of their habitats includes boreal forests, bogs, temperate forests, the tundra of the Arctic and Antarctic, man-made habitats (e.g. roadsides), tropical highlands, and the sandy tropical lowlands of the Amazon rainforest.

In his 2000 monograph on the Cladoniaceae of the Neotropical realm, Ahti included 184 species in 4 genera, and showed that South America is a hotspot of biodiversity for genus &quot;Clanodia&quot;. Bioclimatic variables significantly influence the distribution of Cladoniaceae species richness in the Neotropics, particularly under conditions of low precipitation and temperature, and high climatic variability. Areas with stable climates and higher temperatures and precipitation tend to support greater species richness. Twenty-six Cladoniaceae species (25 &quot;Cladonia&quot; and 1 &quot;Cladia&quot;) are known to occur in the Galápagos Islands. There, some species form mats on lava flows that have developed little soil. A 2013 monograph of Northern European Cladoniaceae treated 100 species (95 &quot;Cladonia&quot;, 4 &quot;Pilophorus&quot;, and the monotypic genus &quot;Pycnothelia&quot;). In the 2021 key to lichen species in Italy, 86 Cladoniaceae are included. In Bulgaria, 55 species in two genera were reported in 2022. In a study of the lichen biodiversity in Kazakhstan&#x27;s Burabay National Park, the Cladoniaceae made up about 30 percent of the species diversity.

In western North America, the Coast Mountains of British Columbia act as a key phytogeographic barrier. This results in distinct oceanic and continental taxa groupings on either side. The research also suggests that the southern boundaries of certain species may be determined more by historical rather than purely ecological factors, indicating possible range expansions. The highest diversity of &quot;Cladonia&quot; species is found in British Columbia between 52°N and 56°N, an area that was covered by glaciers until about 10,000 to 13,000 years ago. The Cladoniaceae biodiversity in this region represents the richest assemblage of the family in western North America. Species diversity declines sharply south of 52°N, with a loss of three to five taxa for each degree of latitude.

The glacial history of the region has played a crucial role in shaping the current distribution of Cladoniaceae. During the Pleistocene, most species likely survived in areas south of the Cordilleran ice sheet, with some persisting in nunataks, arctic regions, or small coastal refugia. This glacial legacy is still evident in the family&#x27;s current distribution patterns. Cladoniaceae show a preference for specific habitats, with greater floristic and chemical diversity observed in humid areas and lower forested elevations compared to arid regions and alpine zones. This suggests that many species in the family are adapted to environments with relatively short periods of desiccation. The post-glacial period has seen significant changes in the distribution of Cladoniaceae. Many species that likely existed in Washington, Oregon, and California during the Pleistocene are now absent from these areas. This change is thought to be a result of climate shifts since deglaciation, particularly an increase in summer moisture deficits. While most Cladoniaceae species have reached a stable distribution, some are still in flux. Species like &quot;Cladina stellaris&quot; and &quot;C. trassii&quot; appear to be continuing their southward expansion from northern glacial refugia.

==Conservation==

Each of the six Cladoniaceae species that have been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature for the global IUCN Red List face a variety of threats impacting their survival. &quot;Cetradonia linearis&quot; (vulnerable, 2015) is endangered by ecosystem changes in spruce–fir forests, specifically the balsam woolly adelgid&#x27;s impact on Fraser fir, and changes in humidity regimes and cloud immersion. The species is also vulnerable to threats from logging, mining, and road building if its legal protection status is removed.

&quot;Cladonia appalachiensis&quot; (endangered, 2020) growing on high-elevation Anakeesta Knob rock, faces threats from visitor disruption and changes in cloud cover and humidity. The species is particularly vulnerable due to its restricted range and specific habitat requirements. The main threats to &quot;Cladonia perforata&quot; (endangered, 2003) include habitat loss, hurricanes, and improper fire management, with a single natural event potentially causing substantial subpopulation reduction.

&quot;Cladonia submitis&quot; (endangered, 2020) is primarily threatened by habitat loss and degradation due to land development, particularly around metropolitan areas. Climate change also poses significant risks through altered fire regimes and sea level rise, affecting its pine barren and sand dune habitats. The species&#x27; limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it particularly susceptible to these threats. &quot;Pilophorus fibula&quot; (endangered, 2020) is threatened by habitat loss, alteration of hydrological regimes, recreational damage, and declining water quality. The species is found in a limited number of locations, making it vulnerable to local extinctions.

&quot;Gymnoderma insulare&quot; (endangered, 2014), primarily found in old-growth forests in Japan and Taiwan, faces threats from natural hazards like typhoons and is affected by the decline of its tree hosts, &quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot; and &quot;Chamaecyparis obtusa&quot;. The species&#x27; dependence on specific host trees and old-growth forest conditions makes it particularly vulnerable to forest degradation and climate change impacts.

On the red list of China&#x27;s macrofungi, &quot;Cladonia delavayi&quot; (vulnerable), &quot;Cladonia pseudoevansii&quot; (critically endangered), &quot;Gymnoderma coccocarpum&quot; (endangered), and &quot;Gymnoderma insulare&quot; (endangered) are the representatives of the Cladoniaceae.

==Human interactions and uses==

&quot;Cladonia&quot; lichens, particularly the &quot;reindeer lichens&quot; such as &quot;C. stellaris&quot;, &quot;C. rangiferina&quot;, and &quot;C. arbuscula&quot;, are a critical winter food source for reindeer (caribou) in northern boreal and arctic regions. In some areas, these lichens can constitute up to 80% of reindeer winter diet. The average annual linear growth rate of these reindeer lichens is about 5 mm per year, accounting for their slow recovery rate after grazing or disturbance. Satellite-based studies have shown a significant decline in caribou lichen cover across large areas of Eastern Canada over the past three decades, likely due to factors such as climate change-induced shrub encroachment, increased wildfire frequency, and grazing pressure, which could have serious implications for caribou populations and ecosystem dynamics. The abundance of lichen-rich forests has significant economic implications for reindeer husbandry, particularly for indigenous Sámi people in Fennoscandia. However, lichen-dominated forests have declined significantly in recent decades due to factors such as intensive forestry practices, overgrazing, and fire suppression. This decline has prompted efforts to restore lichen habitats, including experimental transplantation of lichen fragments to accelerate recovery after disturbances like forest fires.

Some Cladoniaceae species are exploited in a profitable export business for decorative uses, with demand reaching thousands of kilograms. In Europe, &quot;Cladonia stellaris&quot; is used ornamentally in wreaths, floral decorations and architectural models. From 1970–1975, an average of nearly 3000 metric tonnes were exported each year from Finland, Norway and Sweden; most of these exports (about 80%) went to West Germany. Fruticose &quot;Cladonia&quot; species, often dyed green and glycerol-treated for flexibility, are common in model train displays as miniature trees and shrubs. The product commercially sold as &quot;ball moss&quot; or &quot;Icelandic moss&quot; in hobby and craft stores is often &quot;Cladonia stellaris&quot; and other similar species, often dyed in various colours. In Sweden, &quot;Cladonia&quot; lichens were used historically as a partial insulation for storm windows.

The complex net-like structures of the Australasian lichen &quot;Pulchrocladia retipora&quot; have been described as &quot;of considerable beauty resembling lace or coral&quot;, and have been utilised in floral and architectural design. This species&#x27; branches, characterised by its numerous small holes, exemplify nature&#x27;s efficient use of latticework structures. This design, widely used in construction for structures such as transmission towers or bridges, allows the organism to maintain structural integrity while minimising the amount of biological material used in its construction. The unique lichen architectures of five Cladoniaceae species are depicted in Ernst Haeckel&#x27;s well-known and widely reproduced lichen-themed lithograph in his 1904 work &quot;Kunstformen der Nature&quot; (&quot;The art forms of nature&quot;). According to the lichenologists Robert Lücking and Toby Spribille, &quot;the &quot;Cladonia&quot; growth form continues to be one of the most widely recognized lichen architectures, with their basal scales and erect, often trumpet-shaped podetia&quot;.

<text>Jack Yan (; born 1972) is a New Zealand publisher, designer and businessman. He is best known as the founder and publisher of &quot;Lucire&quot;.

He ran for mayor of Wellington in 2010, and again in 2013, but was unsuccessful in both elections.

==Background==
Yan was born in Kowloon, Hong Kong, and emigrated to Wellington, New Zealand, with his parents in 1976. He attended St Mark&#x27;s Church School (where he was Dux) and Scots College, and graduated from Victoria University of Wellington with three degrees – two in business and one in law.

Aside from English, Yan speaks Cantonese, French, and Taishanese.

==Career==

=== Business ventures ===
Beginning in the 1980s, Yan created over 100 typeface designs himself for his firm, Jack Yan &amp; Associates and was New Zealand&#x27;s first digital typeface designer. He encouraged other local typeface designers such as Kris Sowersby to pursue careers in that industry. His typefaces include Ætna, a revival of Bembo.

He also helms a consulting firm, and is co-chair of the Medinge Group think-tank.

In 1997, he founded &quot;Lucire&quot;, a fashion magazine that added print editions after starting on the web, and serves as its publisher.

From 2007 to 2012, he was a judge for Miss Universe New Zealand, and became a director of the licensee firm that took over in 2013.

In 2008, he founded the online car encyclopedia &quot;Autocade&quot;, which he then extended into a print version in 2023.

===Writings and media===
Yan was a contributor to &quot;Visual Arts Trends&quot; in New York (1999–2001), &quot;The Journal of Brand Management&quot; in London (2003–11), and &quot;Desktop&quot; magazine in Australia (1996–2010).

Web publications that he has written for include UK-based &quot;Fontzone&quot; and &quot;DZ3&quot;. He was a founding contributor to Allaboutbranding.com (from 2002). Additionally, he writes for his own publications, &quot;CAP&quot; and &quot;Lucire&quot;.

He contributed chapters to &quot;Beyond Branding&quot; (2003) and &quot;Brands with a Conscience&quot; (2016), wrote &quot;Typography and Branding&quot; (2004), and ghost-wrote Greek designer Panos Papadopoulos&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Panos: My Life, My Odyssey&quot; (2022), for which they won a Highly Commended at the Business Book Awards 2023. He followed that up with the biographical &quot;Lilla boken om Panos: historien om den ikoniska badmodedesignern&quot; (2024) in Sweden.

From 3 March 2006, he began a weekly spot on TV One&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning&quot;, discussing men&#x27;s issues, but resigned from that role in 2007.

In 2020, he started as a regular panellist on Radio New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;The Panel&quot;.

He is better known outside New Zealand for his work; he has been interviewed by CNN, &quot;Business 2.0&quot; and the UK&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

===Politics===
In the 2008 general election Yan stood as a candidate on the Alliance party list, but no candidates for the Alliance were elected. He was a candidate in Wellington&#x27;s 2010 mayoral election, and stood again in the 2013 elections.

<doc id="897351" wikidata="Q207989" url="?curid=897351" title="Southern Italy">
<text>Southern Italy (, , or , ; ; ), also known as () or (; ; ; ), is a macroregion of Italy consisting of its southern regions.

The term &quot;&quot; today mostly refers to the regions that are associated with the people, lands or culture of the historical and cultural region that was once politically under the administration of the former Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily (officially denominated as one entity and , i.e. &quot;Kingdom of Sicily on the other side of the Strait&quot; and &quot;across the Strait&quot;) and which later shared a common organization into Italy&#x27;s largest pre-unitarian state, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

The island of Sardinia, which was not part of the aforementioned polity and had been under the rule of the Alpine House of Savoy, which would eventually annex the Bourbons&#x27; southern Italian kingdom altogether, is nonetheless often subsumed into the . The Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) employs the term &quot;south Italy&quot; (, or just , i.e. &quot;south&quot;) to statistically identify in its reportings the six mainland regions of southern Italy without Sicily and Sardinia, which form a distinct statistical region under the ISTAT denominated &quot;Insular Italy&quot; (, or simply &quot;Islands&quot;). These same subdivisions are at the bottom of the Italian First level NUTS of the European Union and the Italian constituencies for the European Parliament. Nonetheless, Sardinia and especially Sicily are included as &quot;southern Italy&quot; in most definitions of the southern Italy macroregion. 

==Etymology of Mezzogiorno==
In a similar fashion to France&#x27;s (&quot;midday&quot; or &quot;noon&quot; in French), the Italian term &quot;&quot; refers to the intensity and the position of sunshine at midday in the south of the Italian peninsula.

The term came into vogue after the annexation of the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies by the mainland-based Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia, and the subsequent Italian unification of 1861.

==Regions==

Southern Italy is generally thought to comprise the administrative regions that correspond to the geopolitical extent of the historical Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, including Abruzzo, Apulia, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Molise, and Sicily. The island of Sardinia, although being culturally, linguistically and historically less related to the aforementioned regions than any of them is to one another is frequently included as part of the , often for statistical and economical purposes.

==Geography==

Southern Italy forms the lower part of the Italian &quot;boot&quot;, containing the ankle (Campania), the toe (Calabria), the arch (Basilicata), and the heel (Apulia), Molise (north of Apulia) and Abruzzo (north of Molise) along with Sicily, removed from Calabria by the narrow Strait of Messina. Separating the &quot;heel&quot; and toe of the &quot;boot&quot; is the Gulf of Taranto, named after the city of Taranto, which is at an angle between the heel and the boot itself. It is an arm of the Ionian Sea. The island of Sardinia, situated to the west of the Italian peninsula and right below the French island of Corsica, may also often be included.

On the eastern coast is the Adriatic Sea, leading into the rest of the Mediterranean through the Strait of Otranto (named after the largest city on the tip of the heel). On the Adriatic, south of the &quot;spur&quot; of the boot, the peninsula of Monte Gargano; on the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Gulf of Salerno, the Gulf of Naples, the Gulf of Policastro and the Gulf of Gaeta are each named after a large coastal city. Along the northern coast of the Salernitan Gulf and on the south of the Sorrentine Peninsula runs the Amalfi Coast. Off the peninsula&#x27;s tip is the isle of Capri.

The climate is mainly Mediterranean (Köppen climate classification Csa), except at the highest elevations (Dsa, Dsb) and the semi-arid eastern stretches in Apulia and Molise, along the Ionian Sea in Calabria and the southern stretches of Sicily (BSw). The largest city of southern Italy is Naples, an originally Greek name that it has historically maintained for millennia. Bari, Taranto, Reggio Calabria, Foggia, and Salerno are the next largest cities in the area.
The region is geologically very active, except for Salento in Apulia, and highly seismic: the 1980 Irpinia earthquake killed 2,914 people, injured more than 10,000 and left 300,000 homeless.

==History==
===Prehistory and antiquity===

In the 8th and the 7th centuries BCE, for various reasons, including demographic crisis (famine, overcrowding etc.), the search for new commercial outlets and ports, and expulsion from their homeland, Greeks began to settle in southern Italy. Also during this period, Greek colonies were established in places as widely separated as the eastern coast of the Black Sea, Eastern Libya and Massalia (Marseille). 
They included settlements in Sicily and the southern part of the Italian peninsula. The first Greek settlers found Italy inhabited by three major populations: Ausones, Oenotrians and Iapyges (the last of which were subdivided into three tribes: Daunians, Peucetians and Messapians). The relationships between the Greek settlers and the native peoples were initially hostilem especially with the Iapygian tribes. The Hellenic influence eventually shaped their culture and way of life.
The Romans used to call the area of Sicily and coastal southern Italy Magna Graecia (&quot;Great Greece&quot;) since it was so densely populated by coastal Greek colonies; the ancient geographers differed on whether the term included Sicily or merely Apulia and Calabria with Strabo being the most prominent advocate of the wider definitions.

With this colonisation, Greek culture was exported to Italy in its dialects of the Ancient Greek language, its religious rites and its traditions of the independent &quot;polis&quot;. An original Hellenic civilization soon developed, later interacting with the native Italic and Roman civilisations. The most important cultural transplant was the Chalcidean/Cumaean variety of the Greek alphabet, which was adopted by the Etruscans; the Old Italic alphabet subsequently evolved into the Latin alphabet, which became the most widely used alphabet in the world.

Many of the new Hellenic cities became very rich and powerful like &quot;Neapolis&quot; (Νεάπολις, Naples, &quot;New City&quot;), &quot;Syrakousai&quot; (Συράκουσαι, Syracuse), &quot;Akragas&quot; (Ἀκράγας, Agrigento), and &quot;Sybaris&quot; (Σύβαρις, Sibari). Other cities in Magna Graecia included &quot;Tarentum&quot; (Τάρας), &quot;Metapontum&quot; (Μεταπόντιον), &quot;Heraclea&quot; (Ἡράκλεια), &quot;Epizephyrian Locri&quot; (Λοκροὶ Ἐπιζεφύριοι), &quot;Rhegium&quot; (Ῥήγιον), &quot;Croton&quot; (Κρότων), &quot;Thurii&quot; (Θούριοι), &quot;Elea&quot; (Ἐλέα), &quot;Nola&quot; (Νῶλα), &quot;Syessa&quot; (Σύεσσα), &quot;Bari&quot; (Βάριον), and others.

Although many of the Greek inhabitants of Magna Graecia were entirely Latinized during the Middle Ages, pockets of Greek culture and language remained and have survived to the present day. One example is the Griko people in Calabria (Bovesia) and Salento (Grecìa Salentina), some of whom still maintain their Greek language (Griko language) and customs. The Griko language is the last living trace of the Greek elements that once formed Magna Graecia.
After Pyrrhus of Epirus failed in his attempt to stop the spread of Roman hegemony in 282 BCE, the south fell under Roman domination and remained in such a position until the barbarian invasions (the Gladiator War is a notable suspension of imperial control). It was restored to Eastern Roman control in the 530s after the fall of Rome in the West in 476, and some form of imperial authority survived until the 1070s. Total East Roman rule was ended by the Lombards by Zotto&#x27;s conquest in the final quarter of the 6th century.

===Middle Ages===


After the Gothic War (535–554) until the arrival of the Normans, much of southern Italy&#x27;s destiny was linked to the fortunes of the Eastern Empire even though Byzantine domination was challenged in the 9th century by the Lombards, who annexed the area of Cosenza to their Duchy of Benevento. Consequently, the Lombard and the Byzantine areas became influenced by Eastern monasticism, and much of southern Italy experienced a slow process of orientalisation in religious life (rites, cults and liturgy), which accompanied a spread of Eastern churches and monasteries that preserved and transmitted the Greek and Hellenistic tradition. The Cattolica monastery in Stilo is the most representative of these Byzantine monuments. From then to the 11th-century Norman conquest the south of the peninsula was constantly plunged into wars between the Byzantines, Lombardy, and the Aghlabid dynasty. The latter established two emirates in southern Italy: the Emirate of Sicily and, for 25 years, the Emirate of Bari. Amalfi, an independent republic from the 7th century until 1075, and to a lesser extent Gaeta, Molfetta and Trani, rivalled other Italian maritime republics in their domestic prosperity and maritime importance.
From 999 to 1139, the Normans occupied all the Lombard and Byzantine possessions in southern Italy, ended a millennium of imperial Roman rule in Italy and eventually expelled the Muslims from Sicily. The Norman Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II was characterised by its competent governance, multi-ethnic nature and religious tolerance. Normans, Jews, Muslim Arabs, Byzantine Greeks, Lombards and &quot;native&quot; Sicilians lived in relative harmony. However, the Norman domination lasted only several decades before it formally ended in 1198 with the reign of Constance of Sicily, and was replaced by that of the Swabian Hohenstaufen dynasty, thanks to Constance&#x27;s marriage to Henry VI, member of this family.

In Sicily, King Frederick II endorsed a deep reform of the laws culminating with the promulgation of the Constitutions of Melfi (1231, also known as &quot;Liber Augustalis&quot;), a collection of laws for his realm that was remarkable for its time and a source of inspiration for a long time afterward. It made the Kingdom of Sicily a centralised state and established the primacy of written law. With relatively small modifications, the&quot; Liber Augustalis&quot; remained the basis of Sicilian law until 1819. His royal court in Palermo from around 1220 to his death saw the first use of a literary form of an Italo-Romance language, Sicilian, which had a significant influence on what was to become the modern Italian language. He also built the Castel del Monte and in 1224 founded the University of Naples, now called, after him, Università Federico II.

In 1266, conflict between the House of Hohenstaufen and the papacy led to Sicily&#x27;s conquest by Charles I, Duke of Anjou. Opposition to French officialdom and taxation combined with incitement of rebellion by agents from the Byzantine Empire and the Crown of Aragon led to the Sicilian Vespers insurrection and successful invasion by king Peter III of Aragon in 1282. The resulting War of the Sicilian Vespers lasted until 1302 the Peace of Caltabellotta divided the old Kingdom of Sicily into two.

The island of Sicily, called the &quot;Kingdom of Sicily beyond the Lighthouse&quot; or the Kingdom of Trinacria, went to Frederick III of the House of Barcelona, who had been ruling it. The peninsular territories, called Kingdom of Sicily contemporaneously but Kingdom of Naples by modern scholarship, went to Charles II of the House of Anjou, who had likewise been ruling it. Thus, the peace was formal recognition of an uneasy &quot;status quo&quot;. Although the king of Spain had seized both two crowns in the 16th century, the administrations of the two halves of the Kingdom of Sicily remained separated until 1816, when they were reunited in the Kingdom of Two Sicilies.
===Early modern history===

In 1442, Alfonso V conquered the Kingdom of Naples and unified Sicily and Naples once again as dependencies of the Crown of Aragon. At his death in 1458, the kingdom was again divided . Ferrante, Alfonso&#x27;s illegitimate son, inherited Naples. When Ferrante died in 1494, Charles VIII of France invaded Italy by using the Angevin claim to the throne of Naples, which his father had inherited on the death of King René&#x27;s nephew in 1481, as a pretext, which started the Italian Wars. Charles VIII expelled Ferrante’s successor, Alfonso II of Naples, from Naples in 1495. However, he was soon forced to withdraw because of the support of Ferdinand II of Aragon to his cousin, Alfonso II&#x27;s son Ferrantino.

Ferrantino was restored to the throne but died in 1496 and was succeeded by his uncle, Frederick IV. The French, however, did not give up their claim and, in 1501, agreed to a partition of the kingdom with Ferdinand of Aragon, who abandoned his cousin, King Frederick. The deal soon fell through, however, and the Crown of Aragon and France resumed their war over the kingdom, ultimately resulting in an Aragonese victory leaving Ferdinand in control of the kingdom by 1504.

The kingdom remained disputed between France and Spain for the next several decades. The French efforts to gain control of it became feebler as the decades went on, and Spanish control was never genuinely endangered. The French finally abandoned their claims to the kingdom by the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis in 1559. With the Treaty of London (1557), the new client state of the so-called &quot;Presidi&quot; (&quot;state of the garrisons&quot;) was established and governed directly by Spain as part of the Kingdom of Naples.

The administration of the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily, as well as of the Duchy of Milan, was run by the Council of Italy. The island of Sardinia, which had fully come to be under Iberian sovereignty in 1409 upon the fall of the last indigenous state, was an integral part of the Council of Aragon instead and remained as such until the first years of the XVIII° century, when Sardinia was ceded to Austria and eventually handed over to the Alpine-based House of Savoy in 1720.

After the War of the Spanish Succession in the early 18th century, possession of the kingdom again changed hands. Under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, Naples was given to Charles VI, the Holy Roman Emperor. He also gained control of Sicily in 1720, but Austrian rule did not last long. Both Naples and Sicily were conquered by a Spanish army during the War of the Polish Succession in 1734, and Charles, Duke of Parma, a younger son of King Philip V of Spain was installed as King of Naples and Sicily from 1735. Charles inherited the Spanish throne from his older half-brother in 1759, he left Naples and Sicily to his younger son, Ferdinand IV. Despite the two kingdoms being in a personal union under the House of Bourbon from 1735 onwards, they remained constitutionally separated.

===Early 19th century===
Being a member of the House of Bourbon, King Ferdinand IV was a natural opponent of the French Revolution and Napoleon. In January 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte, in the name of the French Republic, captured Naples and proclaimed the Parthenopaean Republic, a French client state, as successor to the kingdom. King Ferdinand fled from Naples to Sicily until June of that year. In 1806, Bonaparte, by then French Emperor, again dethroned King Ferdinand and appointed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as King of Naples. In the Edict of Bayonne of 1808, Napoleon removed Joseph to Spain and appointed his brother-in-law, Joachim Murat, as King of the Two Sicilies, though this meant control only of the mainland portion of the kingdom. Throughout this Napoleonic interruption, King Ferdinand remained in Sicily, with Palermo as his capital.

After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, King Ferdinand IV was restored by the Congress of Vienna of 1815 as Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies. He established a concordat with the Papal States, which previously had a claim to the land. There were several rebellions on the island of Sicily against the King Ferdinand II, but the end of the kingdom was not brought about until the Expedition of the Thousand in 1860, led by Giuseppe Garibaldi, an icon of Italian Unification, with the support of the House of Savoy and its Kingdom of Sardinia with its economic, political and cultural powerhouse in Northern Italy. The expedition resulted in a striking series of defeats for the Sicilian armies against the growing troops of Garibaldi. After the capture of Palermo and Sicily, he disembarked in Calabria and moved towards Naples, and in the meantimem the Piedmontese also invaded the Kingdom from the Marche. The last battles fought were that of the Volturnus in 1860 and the siege of Gaeta, where King Francis II had sought shelter in thepe of for help, which never came.

The last towns to resist Garibaldi&#x27;s expedition were Messina, which surrendered on 13 March 1861, and Civitella del Tronto, which surrendered on 20 March 1861. The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was dissolved and annexed to the new Kingdom of Italy, which was founded in the same year.

===Southern and Northern Italy in 1860===

At the time of Italian unification, the gap between the former northern states of Italy and the southern two Sicilies was significant: northern Italy had about 75,500 kilometers of roads and 2,316 kilometers of railroads, combined with a wide range of canals connected to rivers for freight transportation; iron and steel production was 17,000 tons per year. By contrast, in the former Bourbon southern state, there were 14,700 kilometers of roads, 184 kilometers of railroads (only around Naples), no canals connected to rivers and iron and steel production was 1,500 tons per year.

In 1860, illiteracy rates on the Italian peninsula averaged 75%, with the lowest level of 54% in the northwestern Kingdom of Sardinia (also known as &quot;Piedmont&quot;) and the highest in the south, and illiteracy in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies reached 87%.

In 1860, the southern merchant navy amounted to 260,000 tons, and the northern merchant navy came to 347,000 tons, apart from the Venetian Navy, which was annexed in 1866 and assessed at 46,000 tons. In 1860 the whole Italian merchant navy was the fourth largest in Europe at about 607,000 tons.

The southern merchant navy was made up of sailing vessels mainly for fishing and coastal shipping in the Mediterranean Sea and had very few steamships, even if one of the first steamers was built and fitted out in Naples in 1818. Both the merchant and the military navies were insufficient compared to the great coastal extent of southern Italy, defined by the Italian historian Raffaele De Cesare: &quot;… a great pier towards the south&quot;.

In the article &quot;This is Not Italy! Ruling and Representing the South&quot;, it is clear how the northern elites considered the south. The Piedmontese north felt the need to invade the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and establish a new form of governance based on the northern system, since they viewed the south as underdeveloped and lacking in social capital. Those views of the south can largely be attributed to the letters of correspondents in southern Italy who sent biased letters to leaders of the north, specifically Camillo Benso, urging the invasion and reformation of the south. Although those views of the south were condescending, they also came with a genuine belief that to create a unified Italy, help from the north was necessary. Viewing southern Italy as barbaric served as a sort of justification to allow the &quot;civilized, Piedmontese north&quot; (167) to intervene. Another viewm however, was marked by disdain for southern Italy. According to the article, &quot;such manifestations of the south&#x27;s difference threaten the glowing and gloating sense of northern superiority&quot; (167). These viewpoints clearly indicate the divide between northern and southern Italy in the 1860s.

In an attempt to explain the striking difference between the annexed territory of the former Two Sicilies and the economic and political powerhouse centred in the north, racist theories were postulated, suggesting that such a divide had its roots in the coexistence of two mostly incompatible races.

The British historian Denis Mack Smith describes the radical difference between Northern and the newly-annexed southern Italy in 1860 as both halves being on quite different levels of civilization. He pointed out that the Bourbons in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies were staunch supporters of a feudal system, had feared the traffic of ideas and had tried to keep their subjects insulated from the agricultural and industrial revolutions of Northern Europe.

The study by Mack Smith is confirmed by the Italian historian and left-wing politician Antonio Gramsci in his book &quot;The Southern Question&quot; by which the author emphasizes the &quot;absolutely antithetical conditions&quot; of northern and southern Italy at the time of Italian unification in 1861, when south and north were united again after more than one thousand years. Gramsci remarked that in Northern Italy, the historical period of the Comunes had given a special boost to history and in northern Italy existed an economic organization similar to that of the other states of Europe, propitious to further development of capitalism and industry, but in southern Italy, history had been different, and the paternalist Bourbon administrations produced nothing of value. The bourgeois class did not exist, agriculture was primitive and insufficient to satisfy the local market, there were no roads, no ports and the few waterways that the region had were not exploited because of the region&#x27;s special geographical features.

The living conditions of the people of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies are also illustrated by Raffaele De Cesare, who reported that the Jing of Naples Ferdinand II had no interest in doing useful works to improve the neglected condition of public hygiene, particularly in the provinces, where scarcity of sewer systems and often water shortages were known issues.

The problem of brigandage is explained in the book &quot;Heroes and Brigands&quot; by the southern Italian historian and politician Francesco Saverio Nitti, outlining that brigandage was endemic in southern Italy, since the Bourbons themselves relied on it as their military agent.
Unlike in southern Italy, there was little brigandage in the other annexed states of Northern and Central Italy, like the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, the Duchy of Parma, the Duchy of Modena, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Papal States.

According to the southern Italian historian Giustino Fortunato, and the Italian institutional sources the problems of southern Italy had existed way before Italian unification, and Giustino Fortunato emphasised that the Bourbons were not the only ones responsible for the problems of the south, which had ancient and deep origins in the previous centuries of poverty and isolation, caused by domination by foreign governments.

In literature, the period around 1860 was depicted by the Sicilian writer Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa in his famous novel &quot;Il Gattopardo&quot; (&quot;The Leopard&quot;), set in Sicily at the time of Italian unification. In a famous final scene, Prince Salina, when invited to join the senate of unified Italy, tells a high-ranking Piedmontese officer that &quot;the Sicilian will never want to change, because the Sicilian feels perfect...&quot;. With theoe and other words, the author underscored the Sicilians&#x27; problems of having to change their old lifestyle and remaining on their island. The novel was adapted by Luchino Visconti for his homonymous 1963 film &quot;The Leopard&quot;.

===After 1861===

The southern economy greatly suffered after the Italian unification, and the process of industrialisation was interrupted. This situation of persistent backwardness in the socioeconomic development of the regions of southern Italy compared to the other regions of the country, especially the northern ones, is known as the southern question. Poverty and organised crime were long-standing issues in southern Italy as well and it got worse after unification. Cavour stated the basic problem was poor government, and believed the solution lay in the strict application of the Piedmontese legal system. The main result was an upsurge in brigandage.

Therefore, the south experienced great economic difficulties resulting in massive emigration leading to a worldwide Italian diaspora, especially to North America, South America, Australia and other parts of Europe. Many natives also relocated to the industrial cities in northern Italy, such as Genoa, Milan and Turin. A relative process of industrialisation has developed in some areas of the &quot;Mezzogiorno&quot; after the Second World War. In the 1946 referendum, the region voted to keep the monarchy, with its greatest support coming in Campania. Politically, the region was at odds with the north, which won the referendum to establish a republic.

Today, the south remains less economically developed than the northern and central regions, which enjoyed an &quot;economic miracle&quot; in the 1950s and the 1960s and became highly industrialized.

== Economy ==

Starting from the unification of Italy in 1861–1870, a growing economic divide between the Northern provinces and the southern half of Italy became evident. In the early decades of the new kingdom, the lack of effective land reform, heavy taxes, and other economic measures imposed on the south, along with the removal of protectionist tariffs on agricultural goods imposed to boost northern industry, made the situation nearly impossible for many tenant farmers, small businesses and land owners. Multitudes chose to emigrate rather than try to eke out a meagre living, especially from 1892 to 1921. In addition, the surge of brigandage and mafia provoked widespread violence, corruption and illegality. Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti once conceded that places existed &quot;where the law does not operate at all&quot;.

After the rise of Benito Mussolini, the &quot;Iron Prefect&quot;, Cesare Mori, tried to defeat the powerful criminal organizations flowering in the south with some degree of success. However, when connections between mafia and the fascists emerged, Mori was removed, and fascist propaganda declared the mafia defeated. Economically, Fascist policy aimed at the creation of an Italian Empire and southern Italian ports were strategic for all commerce towards the colonies. Naples enjoyed a demographic and economic rebirth, mainly due to the interest of King Victor Emmanuel III, who was born there.

In the 1950s, the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno was set up as a huge public master plan to help industrialise the south by land reforms creating 120,000 new small farms and by the &quot;Growth Pole Strategy&quot; whereby 60% of all government investment would go to the south to boost the southern economy by attracting new capital, stimulating local firms, and providing employment. However, the objectives were largely missed, and the south became increasingly subsidised, dependent on the state and incapable of generating private growth itself. Presently, huge regional disparities still persist. Problems still include pervasive organised crime and very high unemployment rates.

Southern Italy&#x27;s lack of progress in bettering the area has had it record numbers of emigration. The most prevalent issue in southern Italy is its inability to attract businesses and therefore create jobs. Between 2007 and 2014, 943,000 Italians were unemployed, 70% being Italians from the south. Employment in the south is ranked the lowest when compared to countries in the European Union. Italians from the south are also ranked the lowest in terms of financial contributions into the economy of Italy from immigrants. In southern Italy, the tourism, distribution, food industries, wood furniture, wholesale, vehicle sales, mineral sales and artisan fields are among the leading areas contributing to the projected employment growth. The south heavily relies on tourism in for its economy and attracts tourists through its rich historical background.

A report published in July 2015 by the Italian organization &quot;SVIMEZ&quot; shows that southern Italy had a negative GDP growth in the previous seven years and that from 2000, it has been growing half as much as Greece. In 2016, southern Italy&#x27;s GDP and economy was growing twice as much as northern Italy&#x27;s. According to Eurostat figures published in 2019, southern Italy is the European area with the lowest percentages of employment: in Apulia, Sicily, Campania and Calabria, less than 50% of the people aged between 20 and 64 had a job in 2018. That is largely due to the low participation of women in the workforce, as slightly more than 30% of the women are employed, compared to a national and European average of 53.1% and 67.4%, respectively.

In southern Italy, which contains eight cohesion areas (Sicily, Calabria, Campania, Molise, Puglia, Abruzzo and Basilicata), a public–private partnership known as SMEI Italy serves as a catalyst for private investment and supports economic growth and employment creation. Over €1 billion in finance has been catalyzed in these eight locations to far, supporting almost 5 000 SMEs and small mid-caps.

===Per capita GDP by region===
Today, Abruzzo is the richest southern Italian the region, and Calabria is the poorest.

==Culture==

The regions of southern Italy were exposed to some different historical influences from those the rest of the peninsula, starting most notably with Greek colonisation in Magna Graecia. Greek influence in the south was dominant until Latinisation was completed by the time of the Roman Principate. Greek influences returned by the late Roman Empire, especially following the reconquests of Justinian and the Byzantine Empire.

Sicily, a distinctive Norman–Arab–Byzantine culture throughout the Middle Ages, was captured by Muslims and turned into an Emirate for a period, and elements of Arab culture were introduced via Sicily to Italy and Europe. The rest of the mainland was subject to a struggle of power among the Byzantines, Lombards, and Franks. In addition, the Venetians established outposts as trade with Byzantium and the Near East increased.

Until the Norman conquests of the 11th and the 12th centuries much of the south followed Eastern rite (Greek) Christianity. The Normans who settled in Sicily and southern Italy in the Middle Ages significantly impacted the architecture, religion and high culture of the region. Later, southern Italy was subjected to rule by the new European nation-states, first the Crown of Aragon, then Spain and finally Austria. The Spanish had a major impact on the culture of the south, having ruled it for over three centuries.

Jewish communities lived in Sicily and southern Italy for over 15 centuries, but in 1492, King Ferdinan II of Aragon proclaimed the Edict of Expulsion. At their height, Jewish Sicilians probably constituted around one tenth of the island&#x27;s population. After the edict, they partially converted to Christianity and some moved to the Ottoman Empire and other places in Italy and Europe. In the 19th century, street musicians from Basilicata began to roam worldwide to seek a fortune, most of them would become professional instrumentalists in symphonic orchestras, especially in the United States.

Southern Italy has many major tourist attractions, such as the Palace of Caserta, the Amalfi Coast, Pompeii, Sassi di Matera, Trulli di Alberobello and other archaeological sites (many of which are protected by UNESCO). There are also many ancient Greek cities in southern Italy, such as Sybaris and Paestum, which were founded several centuries before the start of the Roman Republic. Some of its beaches, woodlands and mountains are preserved in several National Parks; a major example is the Pollino, between Basilicata and Calabria, that hosts the largest national park in Italy.

In recent years, southern Italy has experienced a revival of its traditions and music, such as the Neapolitan song and the &quot;tarantella&quot;.

<text>The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) are the military of the Republic of Singapore, responsible for protecting and defending the security interests and the sovereignty of the country. A component of the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF), the armed forces have four service branches: the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Digital and Intelligence Service. An integrated force, it is one of the most capable, robust, technologically sophisticated and powerful militaries in the Southeast Asia region. The SAF is headed by the chief of defence force, appointed by the President, on the advice of the Cabinet.

Since its inception, the SAF has been involved in various operations, both domestically and abroad. These include peacekeeping missions in places such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Nepal and Timor Leste as well as disaster relief operations in various countries, including the 1970 Bhola cyclone, 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, 2008 Sichuan earthquake, April 2015 Nepal earthquake, Hurricane Harvey, among others. In addition, the SAF has assisted the United Nations to oversee and supervise the electoral process in countries such as Cambodia, Ethiopia, Namibia and South Africa.

It has an approximate active strength of over 51,000 full-time personnel and is capable of mobilising over 252,500 reservists (also known as National Servicemen, or NSmen) in the event of national exigencies or a full-scale war. It also has a large pool of conscripts (also known as Full-time National Servicemen, or NSFs) in the active and reserve forces, with about 50,000 reaching military age annually.

In recent years, the SAF has also taken on a more active role in counter-terrorism efforts.

==History==

===Pre-independence===
Prior to Singapore attaining its independence as a nation state, the British colonial force defended Singapore.

The Singapore Volunteer Rifle Corps (SVRC) was first created in 1854 as a private organisation, with the governor serving as its first Colonel. It was later gazetted in 1857. However, participation in the SVRC was weak and it was disbanded on 16 December 1887 in favour of forming an artillery corps instead. This was to be the Singapore Volunteer Artillery (SVA), which was formed in 1888 to operate the gun emplacements around Singapore, and is also considered to be the predecessor of the artillery formation of the Singapore Armed Forces. In 1901, additional non-artillery units were set up, including a Chinese infantry company, Eurasian infantry company, and the Singapore Volunteer Engineers, leading to the force being renamed as the Singapore Volunteer Corps (SVC). It assisted in suppressing the 1915 Singapore Mutiny. In 1921, the SVC was combined with other volunteer forces from Malacca and Penang as the Straits Settlements Volunteer Force (SSVF).

During World War II the voluntary military forces of Singapore sustained heavy casualties. The voluntary military force of Singapore was reestablished in 1949.

===Post-independence===
In 1965 an Israeli military advisory team arrived in Singapore, which would remain in the country for the next nine years. Under the guidance of the Israeli military advisory team, the SAF established its organisation, doctrine, training, as well as its equipment, and arsenal. The SAF in Singapore benefited from conscription and massive public spending. In the mid-1970s, the SAF in Singapore had a force of 300,000 soldiers, including regular soldiers, conscript soldiers, as well as reserve force soldiers. The political purpose of the SAF in Singapore was to pose a reasonable deterrence to the two historically hostile neighbours of Singapore. Singapore became known as the &quot;most heavily armed country on earth&quot; when it purchased light tanks, M113 armoured personnel carriers, A-4 Skyhawks, and F-5 fighter aircraft in the mid-1970s.

In the 1980s the SAF in Singapore armed itself to attain the capability to defend Singapore&#x27;s maritime lifeline. In the mid-1980s Singapore purchased eight F-16 fighter-bombers, demonstrating the intent to maintain the SAF as unrivalled in Southeast Asia. In the early 1990s the SAF in Singapore attained the military force necessary to defend Singapore up to 1,000 miles at sea, and therefore respond if necessary to any conflict in the region.

===21st century===
Singapore has been described as &quot;a military powerhouse with the best air force and navy in Southeast Asia.&quot; Singapore&#x27;s wealth allows it to acquire and make the best equipment available as well as incorporate high-end technological equipment into its nation military forces. The SAF is also called &quot;the most technologically advanced armed forces across the Association of Southeast Asian Nation states&quot;.

A key recent example was Singapore&#x27;s decision to acquire four Lockheed Martin&#x27;s F-35B Joint Strike Fighters, which the United States Congress approved, with the option to acquire a further eight more and beyond. This acquisition is significant as &quot;Singapore will fly the most advanced fleet of fighters in its region&quot; which reflects its security relationship with the United States. Furthermore, Singapore stands out from all the other countries in Southeast Asia with its technological sophistication and equipment that &quot;operates at a very high level of capability&quot; and are &quot;all integrated into a single cohesive fighting force.&quot;

Armed Forces Day is commemorated by the SAF annually on 1 July, with a parade held at the SAFTI Military Institute.

On 1 July 2018, Minister for Defence Ng Eng Hen announced that the SAF would transition from its current third-generation technologies to fourth next-generation technologies by overhauling its arsenal. On 27 February 2019, the office of Inspector-General of the Armed Forces was set up to ensure that safety protocols are applied and enforced throughout the military following the death of Aloysius Pang, who was the fourth training related fatality in 18 months after 2017.

===Recent years===
====Contribution in national crises====
On 15 March 1986, the six-storey Hotel New World collapsed. SAF soldiers aided in rescue operations, working alongside members of the Singapore Civil Defence Force to remove the rubble. RSAF UH-1H helicopters were on standby at the nearby Farrer Park football field to evacuate rescued victims to the Singapore General Hospital.

On 26 March 1991, Singapore Airlines Flight 117 was hijacked by four Pakistanis en route to Singapore. Upon landing in Changi Airport at 8:15pm SGT, the hijackers demanded the release of several Pakistan People&#x27;s Party members. Negotiations faltered, and after the hijackers gave their ultimatum to have their demands fulfilled at 6.15am SGT of the following morning, commandos from SAF&#x27;s Special Operations Force (SOF) stormed the plane, killing all hijackers and rescuing the hostages.

During the SARS outbreak in 2003, SAF paramedics were deployed at Changi Airport to screen incoming passengers from places hit by SARS. The SAF also deployed 220 servicemen with operations such as screening, contact tracing and enforcing home quarantine orders. The team also managed other major operations, such as the quarantine of 1,500 staff from the Institute of Mental Health.

In 2004, the Singapore Armed Forces also responded to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.

During the COVID-19 pandemic since 2020, SAF servicemen were called upon to pack and transport masks, conduct tracing calls, and check compliance with stay home notices. MINDEF personnel also ran the National Call Centre to address public queries on the collection of reusable masks. The SAF also deployed manpower to assist in manning thermal imagery machines at the airport to screen travellers with symptoms. The SAF was also involved in managing COVID-19 cases in foreign worker dormitories and at isolation facilities

==Defence policy==

Deterrence and diplomacy have been the fundamental tenets of Singapore&#x27;s military defence policy. Through the years, the SAF in Singapore has developed extensive links with armed forces from other countries. In recent years, there has also been an increased emphasis on peacekeeping and international emergency relief operations. Notable are the SAF&#x27;s contribution to the peacekeeping operations in Afghanistan, East Timor, the Persian Gulf, as well as the disaster response in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake, Hurricane Katrina, and the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.

Singapore&#x27;s spending on military hardware has enabled the SAF to advance from a defensive and defeatist &quot;poisoned shrimp&quot; strategy to a forward defence military strategy in tandem with sustained economic growth. Since the 1980s the government of Singapore has maintained the SAF as a modern and technically proficient armed force that is capable of conventional warfare on land. The SAF&#x27;s declared mission statement is to &quot;enhance Singapore’s peace and security through deterrence and diplomacy, and should these fail, to secure a swift and decisive victory over the aggressor&quot;.

The SAF&#x27;s policy towards Malay people, who share religious and ethnic ties with Singapore&#x27;s largest neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, has been a source of controversy over the years. Malays were virtually excluded from conscription from the beginning of the draft in 1967 until 1977 and, after the policy was eased, were assigned mainly to serve in the Singapore Police Force and the Singapore Civil Defence Force, and not active combat roles.

In 1987, Lee Hsien Loong (then Second Minister for Defence) stated that &quot;If there is a conflict, if the SAF is called to defend the homeland, we do not want to put any of our soldiers in a difficult position where his emotions for the nation may be in conflict with his religion.&quot; Military analyst Sean Walsh claimed that &quot;official discrimination against the Malay population remains an open secret&quot;. The Ministry of Defence contests the charge, noting that there are &quot;Malay pilots, commandos and air defence personnel&quot; and stating that &quot;the proportion of eligible Malays selected for specialist and officer training is similar to the proportion for eligible non-Malays.&quot;

==National Service==
Women are exempt from full-time National Service in Singapore, but can sign on as a career soldier in both combat and non-combat roles. The range of positions available to women has been expanded gradually. In July 2007, the SAF held an exhibition highlighting the contributions of women in the armed forces. In recent years, some women have taken higher positions, such as BG Gan Siow Huang, who is the highest ranking female officer and the first female General in the SAF.

In 2014, a governmental Committee to Strengthening NS established a SAF Volunteer Corps (SAFVC). The SAFVC enables women, first generation Permanent Residents and new citizens to contribute to national defence and strengthen support for NS. Volunteers undergo a four-week course to gain basic military skills and values.

Under the Enlistment Act 1970, conscription is mandatory for all &quot;persons subject to [the] act&quot;, defined as those who are not less than 16 years and 6 months of age and not more than 40 years of age, with some exemptions and with no specific bias to gender. In practice however, it is only compulsory for all Singaporean men who have reached 18 years of age, and are not deferred or exempted for certain reasons, to be conscripted in military service.

NS was initially three years for commissioned officers and two years for other ranks, but it was later revised to two years and six months for soldiers with the rank of Corporal and above, and two years for those with the rank of Lance Corporal or lower. In June 2004, NS was shortened to two years for all Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs), regardless of rank, due to changes in population demographics, manpower requirements and technological advancements. Combat fit NSFs who obtain a silver or gold standard in a physical fitness test have an additional two months reduction, serving 22 months of NS effectively. Upon completion of their NSF stint, servicemen are considered as having reached their Operationally-ready Date (ORD) and are known as Operationally-ready National Servicemen (NSmen). Almost all NSmen go through a 10-year reservist cycle of military training with their assigned unit deployment. Almost all NSmen are obliged to be called up annually for a maximum of 40 days per workyear for national duties, refresher trainings, mobilisations, upgrading courses and individual physical fitness tests and conditioning, depending on their NS unit deployment.

===Training===
Prior to enlistment, pre-enlistees (recruits) are required to attend a medical examination (PULHHEEMS) to determine their medical status to assess vocational suitability postings. They will then be issued a &quot;Physical Employment Status&quot; (PES), which will be used as a guideline to determine for which vocation groupings they are deemed suitable.

PES A and PES B1 (combat-fit) recruits go through a nine-week Basic Military Training (BMT) program, held at the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) on the offshore island of Pulau Tekong. Recruits who are considered obese, are required to attend a 19-week PES Bp BMT weight-loss program. PES B2 formally PES C1 (fit for some combat vocations) recruits will go through a nine-week modified BMT programme at BMTC. PES C and PES E recruits (non-combat-fit) undertake a nine-week modified BMT program in BMTC School V at Kranji Camp II, where serviceman undergoing a four-week modified BMT programme before being deployed to various combat service support vocations such as Admin Support Assistant (ASA), Transport Operator (TO), and Supply Assistant (SA). All servicemen, with the exception commandos, naval divers and service support vocation units, will complete their BMT at BMTC.

===Military education===
Initially, commissioned officers were drawn exclusively from the ranks of Singaporeans who had completed their GCE A levels or embarked on tertiary studies. While the requirements have since been revised, the SAF has still been criticised for &quot;using a promotion system that is based more on education and scholarships than on proven competence&quot;.

==Foreign defence relations==
Singapore is part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements, whose other members include the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia. Designed to replace the former defence role of the British in Singapore and Malaysia, the arrangement obliges members to consult in the event of external threat against Malaysia and Singapore. To this end, an Integrated Air Defence System is set up in Butterworth, Malaysia involving the stationing of officers from the 5 countries at its headquarters.

In 1975, President Chiang Ching-kuo and Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew signed an agreement code-named &quot;Project Starlight&quot; (星光計畫, also known as Hsing Kuang), wherein Singaporean troops could conduct training exercises in Taiwan. These exercises, engaging as many as 10,000 troops at any one time, provided officers a chance to simulate wartime conditions more closely and gain experience in the command and control of operations involving several battalions.

Singapore has consistently supported a strong US military presence in the Asia-Pacific region. In 1990, the US and Singapore signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) which allows the US access to Singapore facilities at Paya Lebar Air Base and the Sembawang wharves. Under the MOU, a US Navy logistics unit was established in Singapore in 1992; US fighter aircraft deploy periodically to Singapore for exercises, and a number of US military vessels visit Singapore. The US Navy&#x27;s Task Force 73/Commander, Logistics Group Western Pacific is now located at Sembawang. The MOU was amended in 1999 to permit US naval vessels to berth at Changi Naval Base, which was completed in early 2001.

Singapore&#x27;s defence resources have also been used for international humanitarian aid missions. They included United Nations peacekeeping missions in areas such as Kosovo, Kuwait and East Timor, participation in the Multi-National Force – Iraq, sending military equipment and personnel to assist in the humanitarian rescue and relief efforts in Indonesia after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, and the United States after Hurricane Katrina, sending medical supplies and personnel in response to the earthquake in Nepal and establishing medical and dental assets for use by the Afghan people. The Republic of Singapore Navy contributes to anti-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden off the eastern coast of Somalia as part of the 25 nations coalition Combined Maritime Forces. Several of the SAF&#x27;s top officers have thus overseas operational military experience. Singapore was the only Asian country to contribute assets and personnel to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and had participated in Operation Gallant Phoenix since May 2017.

Many of the Singapore&#x27;s air units are located abroad such as: No. 130 Squadron in Australia, No. 150 Squadron in France, or joint USAF-RSAF 425th and 428th Fighter Squadron. Since 2009, up to 90 soldiers annually are sent to Germany for exercises of a maximum of seven weeks each time at the Bergen-Hohne Training Area and other locations.

==Legislation==
Under the Singapore Armed Forces Act, the president of Singapore has the authority to raise and maintain the SAF. The president also has the power to form, disband or amalgamate units within the SAF.

The Armed Forces Council (AFC) administers matters relating to the SAF under the Singapore Armed Forces Act. The AFC consists of:
* Minister for Defence and other ministers who are responsible for defence matters or has been assigned to assist them;
* the Permanent Secretaries of the Ministry of Defence;
* the Chief of Defence Force (CDF);
* the Chief of Army (COA);
* the Chief of Air Force (CAF);
* the Chief of Navy (CNV);
* the Chief of Digital and Intelligence Service (CDI) and
* not more than four other members as the president may appoint if the president, acting in their discretion, concurs with the advice of the prime minister.

===Military offences===
Military offences are governed by the SAF and the Enlistment Act in the Singapore Statutes. However, civilian offences (e.g. against the Penal Code) may also amount to a military offence. Offences may be prosecuted by military prosecutors, through the military justice system, or through the civilian judicial system.

==Organisation==
=== Services ===
The SAF consists of four service branches:
* Army &lt;br&gt;(3 combined arms divisions - 3 Div, 6 Div &amp; 9 Div; &lt;br&gt;2 army operational reserve divisions - 21st Div and 25th Div; &lt;br&gt;1 island defence command - 2nd People&#x27;s Defence Forces)
* Air Force (17 squadrons and 4 air bases)
* Navy (5 commands, 8 flotillas, and 2 naval bases)
* Digital and Intelligence Service (inaugurated in 2022)

===Task Forces===
The SAF comprises seven standing task forces:

* Army Deployment Force
* Island Defence Task Force
* Joint Task Force
* Special Operations Task Force; an integrated joint command formed in 2009, to combat common terrorist threats. It comprises selected members of the 1st Commando Battalion&#x27;s Special Operations Force, Naval Diving Unit&#x27;s Special Warfare Group and other forces
* Maritime Security Task Force
* Air Defence Task Force
* Cybersecurity Task Force

=== Defence Agencies ===
Supporting the combat role of the SAF are other governmental organisations of MINDEF, such as the Defence Policy Group, the Defence Management Group, the Defence Technology Group, and the Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency. Within these groups are the Central Manpower Base, Defence Cyber Organisation, and the Military Security Department. Domestic technology companies also play a role in building up Singapore&#x27;s military capabilities, particularly the government-linked ST Engineering (formerly known as Chartered Industries of Singapore), which has designed and built SAF weaponry and equipment.

===Chief of Defence Force (CDF)===
The position of Chief of Defence Force was established in 1990, with the inaugural holder being Winston Choo, who was previously Chief of the General Staff. The SAF is headed by the CDF, a three-star General by establishment and the only active SAF General that can hold three-star rank. He is assisted by the four chiefs of the respective services, who are two-star generals/admirals by establishment. The SAF has a Sergeant Major who currently holds the rank of CWO. The CDF is also supported by the Chief of Staff, Joint Staff, the Joint Operations Directorate, Joint Plans &amp; Transformation Department, the Joint Manpower Department, the Joint Logistic Department, the Joint Intelligence Directorate, and Office of the Inspector-General of the Armed Forces.

=== Ranks ===

The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has five rank schemes for active and reservist personnel, with a sixth for the auxiliaries of the SAF Volunteer Corps. The SAF has a unique rank structure as an integrated force, ranks are the same in the Singapore Army, the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN), the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF), and the Digital and Intelligence Service (DIS).

==Technology in the SAF==

The SAF utilises technology as &quot;force multipliers&quot;, especially in the area of C4I integration, which will enable its various units to fight in an integrated manner. The Army, Air Force and Navy are linked via advanced data-links and networks to enable coordinated attacks and support for various units and forces. Technology is an important element in the SAF&#x27;s transformation into a 3rd Generation Fighting Force.

The SAF acknowledges that technology is crucial for overcoming the limitations of Singapore&#x27;s small population. Having consistently had one of the largest defence budgets in the Asia-Pacific region, Singapore has focused on maintaining its spending on sophisticated and superior weaponry. Research and experimentation to develop a technological edge began as early as 1971, even though the SAF then had only rudimentary capabilities. The effort started off with a three-man team. At present, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) is one of the largest employers of engineers and scientists in Singapore and the SAF continues to devote considerable resources to defence research and development (R&amp;D) and experimentation—5% and 1% of the defence budget, respectively. Singapore&#x27;s education system has also produced national servicemen who can be trained to operate SAF&#x27;s sophisticated platforms and systems.

In Sep 2008, the SAF officially opened its Murai Urban Training Facility (MUTF) to hone the SAF&#x27;s networked urban operations capability. The MUTF resembles a typical town and allows the soldiers to train realistically in an urban setting. In the same month, the SAF&#x27;s new combat uniform, as well as the Advanced Combat Man System, were also unveiled for the first time.

The country also has an established military manufacturing industry that is responsible for the design and development of the following military hardware:
* PRIMUS – Self-propelled Howitzer
* Bionix II – Infantry Fighting Vehicle (an upgrade of the Bionix AFV)
* MATADOR – Unguided Short Range Anti-Armour Weapon
* Terrex I, II, III – Infantry Carrier Vehicle
*PEGASUS – Light Weight Howitzer
* SAR 21 &amp; Bullpup multirole combat rifle – Bullpup Assault Rifle
* Formidable-Class Stealth Frigate – warships designed with stealthy characteristics, equipped with advanced combat systems and with longer endurance
* Independence-class littoral mission vessel – warships designed for littoral and coastal warfare

===Uniforms===
The SAF&#x27;s first-generation army uniform was named &quot;Temasek Green&quot; from the simple flat green uniform, with brown and blue colours being used for the navy and air force&#x27;s uniforms respectively. This was followed by the second-generation uniform, which used a patchy camouflage pattern for the army, while using overalls for the army and navy.

The third and current generation of combat uniforms, commonly known as the No. 4, uses digital camouflage with base colours green, blue, light grey and dark grey for the army, air force, navy and DIS respectively. In June 2018, the SAF introduced a new variant of the uniform for combat units, which provides more effective cooling in a manner similar to the ones issued to US army personnel for tropical climates.

The SAF&#x27;s desert-camouflage uniforms are only issued to personnel deployed overseas to countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan.

<text>Almaden Valley (Spanish: &quot;Valle de Almadén&quot;), commonly known simply as Almaden (Spanish: &quot;Almadén&quot;), is a valley and neighborhood of San Jose, California, located in South San Jose. It is nestled between the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west and the Santa Teresa Hills to the east, bordering the town of Los Gatos and West San Jose neighborhood.

Almaden, named after the ancient Spanish mining town of Almadén, traces its history back to the 1820s, when Mexican miners discovered mercury deposits on Rancho Los Capitancillos, which later led to the establishment of the New Almaden mines. Almaden Valley, known for its abundant parkland, is one of San Jose&#x27;s most expensive neighborhoods to live in and is consistently ranked as one of the most expensive areas in the country.

==History==
Almaden was originally inhabited by the Tamien nation of Ohlone people, prior to the arrival of the Spanish. The Ohlone had long utilized the area for its cinnabar, which they used for paint production.

During the Mexican era, the area of what is now Almaden was divided between two rancho grants: Rancho San Vicente, granted to José de los Reyes Berryessa, and Rancho Los Capitancillos, granted to Justo Larios. Rancho Cañada de los Capitancillos and Rancho Cañada de Oro were later divided from these original ranchos.

===Nueva Almadén===


Almaden Valley&#x27;s origins go back to the early 1800s in what is now its southernmost neighborhood, known as New Almaden (Spanish: &quot;Nueva Almadén&quot;). In the 1820s, there were several attempts by local Californio officials from the Pueblo of San José to mine the area for silver, including an 1824 venture led by Don Antonio Suñol, a prominent local figure, and Luis Chaboya, of Rancho Yerba Buena.

Quicksilver (mercury) was only successfully identified in 1845, by Mexican cavalry captain Andrés Castillero, who was able to obtain a grant to mine the area by Governor Pío Pico. However, occupied with his military responsibilities, Castillero sold his claim to the mines to Alexander Forbes, then serving as the British Consul to Mexican California. The area was named after the ancient Spanish mining town of Almadén, where mercury has been mined since Roman times.

Mercury was extracted from the New Almaden mines from the time of the California Gold Rush until 1975. Many of the names in Almaden retain their mercury mine themes, such as Silver Lode Lane and Silver Mine Drive. Many places in Almaden still use the name Quicksilver.

===Post-Conquest era===

Following the American Conquest of California, Almaden Valley attracted a significant amount of settlers from the East Coast and Europe.

In 1852, Charles LeFranc founded Almaden Vineyards, the first commercial winery in California, with his father-in-law Éthienne Thée, using vine cuttings from his native France. Following Prohibition, the winery and the company had great success with their blush wine and the White Grenache Rosé, one of the first popular pink wines in the United States. Almaden Vineyards has since moved its winery to Madera, California, while the historic remains of the property are now known as the Old Almaden Winery, which serves as a public park and California Historic Landmark.

Beginning in the late 1800s, Almaden was home to the Graystone Quarry (originally the Goodrich Quarry), one of the most significant quarries in the Bay Area, used in the construction of landmarks including San Francisco City Hall, Stanford University, Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph, among numerous others. Today, the area where Graystone Quarry once existed and where the Pfeiffer family once lived is occupied by the neighborhood of &quot;Pfeiffer&quot;, also known as, &quot;the Graystone of Almaden&quot;, thus named after the quarry&#x27;s stone master Jacob Pfeiffer and the Quarry.
===20th century===

In December 1959, the Regents of the University of California selected Almaden Valley to be the site of the next campus of the University of California system. Unfortunately, news of this decision caused property values in the area to increase so rapidly that the Regents could no longer afford to buy the needed land. After another year of study, the Regents selected another site much farther south, which opened in 1965 as the University of California, Santa Cruz.

In 1968, Calero County Park was established around Calero Lake in the Calero area of southern Almaden. Calero Lake was created in 1935, when Arroyo Calero was dammed.

In 1975, the New Almaden mines closed after 135 years of operation. Santa Clara County Parks subsequently purchased the vast property surrounding the mines, in order to transform it into a regional park. Almaden Quicksilver County Park opened a few years later after an extensive cleanup of the area. It was declared a National Historic Landmark and a California Historical Landmark.

===Casa Grande===

Casa Grande was constructed in 1854, under the direction of the mine&#x27;s general manager, Henry Halleck, who used the building until 1920 as a personal and official residence for the New Almaden Mining Company. John McLaren, of Golden Gate Park fame, assisted in designing the five acres of formally landscaped grounds around the house.

In 1997, Santa Clara County purchased the building to house the Almaden Quicksilver Mining Museum, which started as a private collection by Constance Perham, who displayed it in her house in New Almaden. The new museum opened in 1998. The building underwent extensive renovation from 2009 to 2010 to restore it to its configuration when it was a mine manager&#x27;s residence from 1854 to 1925. It reopened in January 2011. It houses interpretive exhibits and displays on the history of the New Almaden mines and on the lives of its workers and their families.

===Hacienda Hotel===

In the mid-1800s, just a few years before the great California Gold Rush, Andres Castillera, a Mexican officer with the Artillery discovered cinnabar in New Almaden, a precious metal also known as &quot;quicksilver&quot; which bought Castillera lot of riches. As the word spread, New Almaden was thriving with miners trying to mine more cinnabar themselves.

In 1848, a boarding house was constructed by the creek in New Almaden as a house for boarding for the miners. Hot meals were served in the rustic dining room downstairs. This was the first two-story lodging in California. Fire destroyed the building in 1875 but it was rebuilt and stayed in operation in this capacity until the 1930s.

It was then converted into Cafe Del Rio which served New Almaden for almost 40 years.

In 1992, La Foret, a high-end French restaurant opened in the building. The restaurant, still in operation, is a local landmark in San Jose and well known across the Bay Area for its fine dining.

===New Almaden Historic District===

A two-teacher school was built in the 1860s on a flat near Casa Grande. Enrollment came chiefly from the Hacienda along with some children from nearby ranches. One of the oldest buildings in the district is the Carson-Perham Adobe, built between 1848 and 1850 by Mexican miners, and later the home of George Carson, the mine company bookkeeper, postmaster, telegraph operator, and Wells Fargo agent. Constance Perham lived in the adobe house for many years and established a private museum there in 1949, the collections of which were purchased in 1983 by Santa Clara County.

<doc id="897371" wikidata="Q687709" url="?curid=897371" title="Bank of Latvia">
<text>The Bank of Latvia (,) is the Latvian member of the Eurosystem and has been the monetary authority for Latvia from 1922 to 2013, albeit with a long suspension between 1940 and 1992. It issued the Latvian lats (1922-1940), then a Latvian ruble (1992-1993) and second lats (1993-2013). Since 2014, it has also been Latvia&#x27;s national competent authority within European Banking Supervision. The Bank of Latvia&#x27;s administration is located in Riga.

==History==

On 7 September 1922, the Constitutional Assembly adopted the Law on the Establishment of the Bank of Latvia. The Bank of Latvia was granted emission rights. The Bank&#x27;s interim statutes were approved on 19 September 1922, with the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers, and its initial capital was 10 million lats.

On 24 April 1923, Saeima approved the Statute of the Bank of Latvia, signed by President Jānis Čakste on 2 July. The bank was headed by a council and board. The Council consisted of a chairman, a deputy, and 11 members, but the board included a director general, his deputy, and three directors.

On 17 June 1940, Latvia was occupied and was incorporated into the USSR on 5 August. On 25 July, the Law on the Nationalization of Banks and Large Industrial Enterprises was adopted. After the Second World War, both money emission and the Treasury&#x27;s functions were performed by the USSR State Bank, but the money system of the Latvian SSR was under its full control.

On 2 March 1990, the Latvian SSR Supreme Council passed the Law &quot;On Banks&quot; and the decision &quot;On the Bank of Latvia&quot;. It determined that the Bank of Latvia, a local central bank, was reestablished as an independent state bank, a money issuing center, a central bank in relation to commercial banks, an organizer of the execution of the state budget, and a monetary policy regulator.

However, only after the Declaration of 4 May 1990 on the restoration of independence of the Republic of Latvia and the collapse of the USSR with the decision of the Republic of Latvia Supreme Council of 3 September 1991 &quot;On the Reorganization of Banking Institutions in the Territory of the Republic of Latvia&quot;, the Bank of Latvia became the only central and issuing bank. It took over the ownership and structure of the USSR banks, Latvijas Republikānisko banku, and other state credit institutions.

On 4 March 1992, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia passed the Law &quot;On the Acquisition of the Bank of Latvia established in 1922&quot;. The Bank of Latvia&#x27;s status as the central bank of the country and the issue bank was definitively consolidated by the laws of the Republic of Latvia &quot;On Banks&quot; and &quot;On the Bank of Latvia&quot; adopted on 19 May 1992. For the first time in Latvia, the independence of the national central bank from the government policy was ensured through legislation. The Law &quot;On the Bank of Latvia&quot; did not envisage its commercial activities, therefore, a decision was taken on the restructuring and privatization of 49 Bank of Latvia branches.

==Monetary policy strategy and exchange rate policy==
Like most central banks of the world, the main goal of the Bank of Latvia is to provide inflation at a certain level.

After joining the European Union (EU), until its membership in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the Bank of Latvia was able to pursue its monetary policy, provided that it is in line with the common EU interests, does not harm the development of other EU Member States, and contributes to economic stability.

Membership in the EU also envisages joining EMU and the euro. After joining the EU, Latvia had to demonstrate its ability to meet the EMU accession criteria. One of these criteria was the two-year membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM II). Latvia joined it on 2 May 2005. ERM II means that at least two years before the euro changeover, the lats had been pegged to the euro and the exchange rate of the lats against the euro may fluctuate by no more than +/− 15% against the lats&#x27; pegging rate in euro.

In order to achieve its main goal, as well as successfully entering the EMU, the Bank of Latvia implemented a fixed exchange rate strategy (EUR 1 = Ls 0.702804). Fluctuations around the fixed coupling rate are possible within +/− 1%. The Bank of Latvia had been implementing the lats attraction policy since February 1994, when the lats was pegged to the SDR basket of currencies. The lats was pegged to the euro on 1 January 2005.

Also, at the beginning of 2006 and 2007, the Bank of Latvia operated a refinancing rate instrument, a rate for travel. In a situation where banks do not intend to actively use the instruments offered by the Bank of Latvia, the increase of the refinancing rate has a more signaling function.

== Research ==
The Bank of Latvia also serves as a research center, producing economic and financial analysis and providing data on economic trends and developments in Latvia and the wider region.

==Management==
The Bank of Latvia is managed by the Bank&#x27;s Board and Management Board. The council consists of eight people: the president of the bank, his deputy, and six members of the council. The Bank&#x27;s Supervisory Council is managed by the President of the Bank of Latvia. The Governing Council of the Bank of Latvia takes decisions on behalf of the Bank of Latvia.

For the practical work and operational management of the Bank of Latvia, the Bank Council establishes a permanent board of six people. The Bank&#x27;s Governor approves the structure of the Bank of Latvia and recruits and dismisses the Bank of Latvia&#x27;s employees.

<text>Chalmers Student Union (&quot;Chalmers Studentkår&quot; or ChS) is the student union at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. Its primary purpose is to look after the interests of the students of the university in questions regarding the education. The student union also arranges one of Europe&#x27;s largest labour market days, CHARM.

The social committee of ChS, consisting of 6 members, is called FestU. It was founded in 1948. FestU&#x27;s primary job is to arrange big parties for the student union members, their biggest event of the year is Valborgskalaset which is held April 30 every year.

== History ==

The union was founded in 1904, and the first charter of the organisation was adopted in 1906. In 1911 a proposal to start The Cortège, an annual carnival parade now seen by 250,000 people each year, was accepted. The union&#x27;s own magazine &quot;Tofsen&quot; was first published in 1944, and ChS obtained its first union building &quot;Lopphuset&quot; that same year. A new union building was opened in 1952. The union owns several corporations, including &quot;Cremona&quot;, a bookstore which became an aktiebolag in 1988. A new union building was inaugurated in 2001. The building was drawn by Gert Wingårdh and won the Kasper Salin Prize that year.

== Notable pranks ==

In 1955, a student at the university, Rickard Wilson, held a fake disputation on fatilary calculus, witnessed by many of the larger newspapers in Sweden, fooling many of the journalists, who the day after produced a number of serious articles on the disputation. Three years later, in 1958, a committee at the union, Chalmersspexet, donated 64 öre–corresponding to around 4.5 USD of today–to the Swedish state to &quot;even out the national debt to a whole number of kronor&quot;. In 1968, when the Stockholm University Student Union occupied their union building, ChS decided to occupy the brewery Pripps. Before the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to China from the United Kingdom in 1997, the students&#x27; union wrote a request to the British Prime Minister asking if they could hire the whole of Hong Kong for a few minutes in connection with the transfer to China.

<text>The Morris Minor is an economy car produced by British marque Morris Motors between 1948 and 1971. It made its debut at the Earls Court Motor Show, London, in October 1948. Designed under the leadership of Alec Issigonis, more than 1.6 million were manufactured in three series: the Series MM (1948 to 1953), the Series II (1952 to 1956), and the 1000 series (1956 to 1971).

Initially available as a two-door saloon and tourer (convertible), the range was expanded to include a four-door saloon from September 1950. An estate car with a wooden frame (the Traveller) was produced from October 1953 and panel van and pick-up truck variants from May 1953. It was the first British car to sell over a million units, and is considered a classic example of automotive design, as well as typifying &quot;Englishness&quot;.

Although Morris launched a new model with a similar name and a similar market positioning, the Morris Mini in 1959, the Minor remained in production for more than a decade after that, and inearly 2020, its 23-year production run was counted as the twenty-eighth most long-lived single generation car in history by Autocar magazine, who called it: &quot;... a primary way Britain got back on the road after the Second World War.&quot;

==Development==

===Origins===
The Minor was conceived in 1941. Although the Nuffield Organization was heavily involved in war work and a governmental ban existed on civilian car production, Morris Motors&#x27; vice chairman, Miles Thomas, wanted to prepare the ground for new products to be launched as soon as the war was over. Vic Oak, the company&#x27;s chief engineer, had already brought to Thomas&#x27; attention a promising junior engineer, Alec Issigonis, who had been employed at Morris since 1935 and specialised in suspension design, but he had frequently impressed Oak with his advanced ideas about car design in general. Issigonis had come to Oak&#x27;s particular attention with his work on the new Morris Ten, which was in development during 1936/7. This was the first Morris to use unitary construction and was conceived with independent front suspension. Issigonis designed a coil-sprung wishbone system, which was later dropped on cost grounds. Although the design was later used on the MG Y-type and many other postwar MGs, the Morris Ten entered production with a front beam axle. Despite his brief being to focus on the Ten&#x27;s suspension, Issigonis had also drawn up a rack and pinion steering system for the car. Like his suspension design, this was not adopted, but resurfaced in the postwar years on the MG Y-type. These ideas showed that he was the perfect candidate to lead the design work on a new advanced small car.

With virtually all resources required for the war effort, Thomas nonetheless approved the development of a new small family car that would replace the Morris Eight. Although Oak (and Morris&#x27;s technical director, Sidney Smith) were in overall charge of the project, Issigonis was ultimately responsible for the design, working with only two other draughtsmen: (William)Jack Daniels.
 Thomas named the project &#x27;Mosquito&#x27; and ensured that it remained as secret as possible, both from the Ministry of Supply and from company founder William Morris (Lord Nuffield), who was still chairman of Morris Motors, and as widely expected, would not look favourably on Issigonis&#x27; radical ideas.

Issigonis&#x27; overall concept was to produce a practical, economical, and affordable car for the general public that would equal, or even surpass, the convenience and design quality of a more expensive car. In later years he summed up his approach to the Minor; that he wanted to design an economy car that &quot;the average man would take pleasure in owning, rather than feeling of it as something he&#x27;d been sentenced to&quot; and &quot;people who drive small cars are the same size as those who drive large cars and they should not be expected to put up with claustrophobic interiors.&quot; Issigonis wanted the car to be as spacious as possible for its size, and comfortable to drive for inexperienced motorists. Just as he would with the Mini 10 years later, he designed the Mosquito with excellent roadholding and accurate, quick steering, not with any pretence of making a sports car, but to make it safe and easy to drive by everyone.

===Original design features===
Issigonis&#x27; design included the same ideas he had proposed for the Ten before the war: independent suspension, rack and pinion steering, and unitary construction. In the case of the Mosquito, Issigonis was inspired by the Citroën Traction Avant, a car he greatly admired, and he proposed using torsion bars on each wheel, as on the Citroën, rather than the usual coil spring system. The French car, launched in 1934, had also been an early example of the use of rack and pinion steering.

Nearly every feature of the Minor served the joint aims of good handling and maximum interior space. For example, Issigonis specified wheels for the Mosquito, with 5.20-14 Dunlop Crossply tyres, (145R14 is the radial alternative). These were smaller than any other production car of the time (the existing Morris Eight had wheels). These small wheels reduced intrusion into the cabin space and minimised the car&#x27;s unsprung mass, giving better ride comfort and stability. For the same reasons, the wheels themselves were placed as far as possible towards each corner of the Mosquito&#x27;s floorpan. The same went for the placement of the engine, as far as possible towards the front of the engine compartment. Most cars of the time had a front beam axle, which forced the engine to be mounted behind the front axle line. While this meant that, with only a driver on board, the weight distribution was fairly even, when laden with passengers, cars often became severely tail-heavy, leading to unstable handling and oversteer. The new Morris&#x27;s independent suspension meant there was no front axle, allowing the engine to be placed low down and far forward. Putting the Mosquito&#x27;s engine in the nose meant that the car was nose-heavy when lightly laden, leading to superior directional stability, and when fully laden it achieved nearly equal weight balance, so handling and grip remained good regardless of the load carried. Placing the engine further forward also maximised cabin space.

As proposed by Issigonis, the engine itself was also radical, being a water-cooled flat-four unit. One of Miles Thomas&#x27;s few restrictions on the Mosquito project was that it had to have an engine that would not fall afoul of the British horsepower tax, which taxed cars under a formula relating to their engine cylinder bore. At the same time, Thomas wanted the car to appeal to the all-important export markets, which had no such restrictions, and generally favoured larger-engined cars. Issigonis&#x27; solution was the flat-four engine, which could easily be produced in two versions – a narrow-bore 800-cc version for the British market and a wide-bore 1100-cc version for export. Both versions would use identical parts, except for the actual cylinder blocks (which could still be produced on the same machinery) and the pistons. The flat-four layout reduced the overall length of the engine, further increasing potential cabin space, and reduced the car&#x27;s centre of gravity for improved handling.

===Pre-production changes===
The engine was to prove a step too far for the Mosquito project. As the car approached completion in 1946, the war was over and secrecy was no longer necessary or possible to maintain, as more and more Morris staff and executives had to be involved to start production. Many were pessimistic about the radical car&#x27;s prospects and especially the huge cost in tooling up for a design that shared no parts with any existing Morris product. Lord Nuffield himself took a strong dislike to both the Mosquito and Issigonis, famously saying that the prototype resembled a poached egg. Nuffield preferred to continue production of the conventional Morris Eight, which succeeded very well before the war, with some minor styling and engineering improvements. He particularly objected to the Mosquito&#x27;s expensive and unconventional engine design. Whatever Nuffield&#x27;s personal views, all of the Mosquito&#x27;s radical features were looking increasingly unlikely to be implemented while maintaining an acceptable final purchase price and without incurring too much setup costs at the Cowley factory. Thomas and Vic Oak drew up a plan to create a three-model range of cars using Issigonis&#x27; design – the Mosquito with an 800-cc engine, a mid-sized model (tentatively designated the Minor after a previous small Morris launched in 1928) with an 1100-cc engine, and a new Morris Oxford with a 1500-cc version of the engine, all sharing different-sized variants of the same platform and with sporting MG and luxury Wolseley versions to achieve further economies of scale.

There was also the matter of timing – a big rush existed for British manufacturers to get new models to market following the end of the war. Austin was known to be working on an all-new but conventional car, the Austin A40 Devon, which would be launched in 1947. The Mosquito was proposed for launch in 1949 and that deadline was appearing increasingly unlikely due to the untried nature of many of the car&#x27;s features. The Morris board insisted on launching the Mosquito at the first postwar British Motor Show in October 1948.

This meant that several of Issigonis&#x27; proposals were reviewed – first the all-independent torsion bar suspension was changed for a torsion-sprung live rear axle and this was then substituted by a conventional leaf-sprung arrangement. All of Miles Thomas&#x27; suggestions for spreading the cost of developing the new car and broadening the design&#x27;s appeal were treated sceptically by the Morris board and vetoed by Lord Nuffield. It became clear that the only way to overcome the personal and financial obstacles to the project was to adopt a lightly revised version of the Morris Eight&#x27;s obsolete side-valve engine. Thomas resigned his position at Morris Motors over the debacle. Despite the changes the fundamental principles of Issigonis&#x27; concept – a spacious cabin, small wheels at each corner, a forward-placed engine, rack and pinion steering, and independent torsion-bar front suspension – remained.

While Thomas had been battling for the Mosquito&#x27;s future, Issigonis had been settling the car&#x27;s styling. Although in his later career he became known for very functional designs, Issigonis was heavily influenced by the modern styling of American cars, especially the Packard Clipper and the Buick Super. A new feature was a low-set headlamps, integral with the grille panel (Issigonis had originally sketched hidden lamps concealed behind sections of the grille, but these were never implemented). The original Mosquito prototype, which drew Lord Nuffield&#x27;s &quot;poached egg&quot; comment, was designed with similar proportions to prewar cars, being relatively narrow for its length. In late 1947, with Cowley already tooling up for production, Issigonis was unhappy with the appearance of the car. He had the prototype cut lengthways and the two halves moved apart until it looked &quot;right&quot;. The production model was thus wider than the prototype, and in keeping with Issigonis&#x27; design principles, this further improved interior space and roadholding. It also gave the car distinctive (and recognisably modern) proportions – contrast with the Austin A30, launched in 1952, but still recognisably prewar in size and proportions. The last-minute change to the design required a number of workarounds – bumpers had already been produced, so early cars had ones cut in half with a four-inch plate bolted between the joint. The bonnet had a flat fillet section added to its centreline and the floorpan had two two-inch sections added either side of the transmission tunnel.

===From Mosquito to Minor===
The last change made was to the car&#x27;s name. The Mosquito codename was widely expected to be the name of the production model, but Nuffield disliked it. Also, Issigonis&#x27; last-minute size increase and the fitment of the larger-than-planned sidevalve engine needed to be considered; while still a small car, the new Morris was no longer the ultra-compact economy car that it had been on the drawing board, and the Mosquito name seemed inappropriate. Morris&#x27;s marketing department wanted a reassuring name for what it worried would be an innovative, radical car that would be difficult to sell to a cautious public. So, the Minor name, intended for the midsized model in Thomas&#x27; planned trio of new cars, was adopted for what would become the smallest postwar Morris. The original 1928 Morris Minor had itself introduced a number of innovative features and had been the first four-wheeled car to sell for £100.

The new Morris Minor was launched at the British Motor Show at Earls Court in London on 27 October 1948. The original range consisted solely of a two-door saloon or a two-door tourer with a 918-cc engine and a starting price of £358. At the same show, Morris also launched the new Morris Oxford and Morris Six models, plus Wolseley variants of both cars, which were scaled-up versions of the new Minor, incorporating all the same features and designed with Issigonis&#x27; input under Oak&#x27;s supervision. Thus, Issigonis&#x27; ideas and design principles underpinned the complete postwar Morris and Wolseley car ranges, although not the same extent that Miles Thomas had initially proposed.

==Minor &quot;Series MM&quot;==

The Series MM type Minor was produced from late 1948 until early 1953. It included a pair of four-seat saloons, two-door and (from 1950) a four-door, and a convertible four-seat Tourer. The front torsion bar suspension shared its design with the larger Morris Oxford MO, as was the almost-unibody construction. Although the Minor was originally designed to accept a flat-4 engine, late in the development stage it was replaced by a side-valve inline-four engine, little changed from that fitted in the early 1930s Morris Minor and Morris 8, with a bore of 57 mm but with the stroke of 90 mm and not 83 mm, and producing and of torque. The engine pushed the Minor to just but delivered . Brakes were four-wheel drums.

Early cars had a painted section in the centre of the bumpers to cover the widening of the production car from the prototypes. This widening of is also visible in the creases in the bonnet. Exports to the United States began in 1949 with the headlamps removed from within the grille surround to be mounted higher on the wings to meet local safety requirements. In 1950 a four-door version was released, initially available only for export, and featuring from the start the headlamps faired into the wings rather than set lower down on either side of the grille. The raised headlight position became standard on all Minors in time for 1951. From the start, the Minor had semaphore-type turn indicators, and subsequent Minor versions persisted with these until 1961. An &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine road test in 1950 reported that these were &quot;not of the usual self-cancelling type, but incorporate[d] a time-basis return mechanism in a switch below the facia, in front of the driver&quot;. It was all too easy for a passenger hurriedly emerging from the front passenger seat to collide with and snap off a tardy indicator &quot;flipper&quot; that was still sticking out of the B-pillar, having not yet been safely returned by the time-basis return mechanism to its folded position.
Another innovation towards the end of 1950 was a water pump (replacing a gravity dependent system), which permitted the manufacturer to offer an interior heater &quot;as optional equipment&quot;.

When production of the first series ended, just over a quarter of a million had been sold, 30% of them the convertible Tourer model.

A 918 cc-engined tourer tested by the British magazine &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1950 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 29.2 seconds. However, the 918 cc engine did 0–60 mph in 50+ seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £382 including taxes.


==Minor Series II==

In 1952, the Minor was substantially re-engineered following the merger of the Nuffield Organization (Morris&#x27;s parent company) with the Austin Motor Company to form the British Motor Corporation. As part of a rationalisation programme to reduce the production of duplicate components for similar vehicles, the Minor drivetrain was completely replaced with an Austin-derived engine, gearbox, propshaft, differential, and axle casing. The more modern Austin-designed overhead valve A-series engine, which had been designed for the Minor&#x27;s main rival, the Austin A30, was smaller in all dimensions, but nevertheless gave noticeable performance improvements over the pre-war side-valve Morris unit it replaced. The 52 second drive to was still calm, but top speed increased to . Fuel consumption also rose to .

An estate version was introduced in 1952, known as the Traveller (a Morris naming tradition for estates, also seen on the Mini). The Traveller featured an external structural ash (wood) frame for the rear bodywork, with two side-hinged rear doors. The frame was varnished rather than painted and a highly visible feature of the body style. Travellers were built alongside the saloon model at Cowley minus their rear bodies. The half-completed cars were then shipped to the MG factory at Abingdon where the bodies (built in Coventry) would be mated to the chassis and the final assembly carried out. This was because the main Cowley production lines were no longer fully equipped to deal with body-on-frame vehicles such as the Traveller while the MG lines still handled these sorts of cars and had experience working with wood-framed bodies. Commercial models, marketed as the Morris Quarter Ton Van and Pick-up were added in May 1953. Rear bodies of the van versions were all steel. The four-seat convertible and saloon variants continued as well.

In October 1954 the Minor&#x27;s front end and interior styling was updated, with the addition of a horizontal slat grille, and a new dashboard with a central speedometer. Larger tail lights were also fitted by the end of the year. As Alec Issigonis had left BMC for Alvis in 1952 and wouldn&#x27;t return until 1955, the Cowley design team led by Sid Goble undertook this series of design updates. These changes were announced at the London Motor Show in late October 1954.

&quot;The Motor&quot; magazine tested a four-door saloon in 1952. It reported a top speed of and acceleration from 0– in 28.6 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £631 including taxes.

The 803 cc &quot;A-Series&quot; inline-four engine used in the Series II produced at 4,800 rpm and of torque at 2,400 rpm

269,838 examples of the Series II had been built when production ended in 1956.

==Minor 1000==
===Series III===
In 1956, the Minor received a major programme of updates intended to keep the car competitive into the 1960s. Where previously the Minor had been offered with a broad range of colours and trim options, the &#x27;Minor 1000&#x27; (so named for its 948cc engine) shifted emphasis towards rationalisation of components to access improved economies of scale, and thus enabled increased production volumes to help the Minor retain a significant share of the small car market during a period where car ownership was becoming more commonplace.

The dawn of the motorway era necessitated the fitting of a new 948cc (57.9 cu in) variant of the BMC A-Series engine, elevating top speed from to , and reducing 0-60 mph acceleration from 52.5 secs to 31.3 secs. Driving was further improved by a substantially revised gearbox, which incorporated taller ratios for more relaxed cruising speeds and a remote selector allowing a shorter gear lever and less ponderous gearchange action. This new engine and gearbox was the product of a broader engine policy at BMC, and had been developed for use in a range of their smaller vehicles, including the Austin A35, A40 Farina, and Austin-Healey Sprite/MG Midget, to maximise parts sharing and thus reduce production costs, servicing costs and consumer costs across the model range.

A series of changes to the body pressings for the roof/scuttle and bonnet panels yielded a large wraparound rear windscreen and one-piece curved front windscreen, which markedly improved visibility and lent a modernised appearance to the car at relatively small outlay.

Many of the &#x27;luxury&#x27; items, such as leather trim (except for the Tourer), were replaced with more durable and cheaper materials, and over the course of the following years the range of available paint and interior colours was dramatically reduced. Various unique Minor trim items and components (such as light units and heaters) were also gradually replaced with ubiquitous items from the BMC range. This programme of changes succeeded in giving access to improved economies of scale to allow production to be ramped up. By the turn of the 1960s, over 100,000 Minors were being produced per year, compared to fewer than 50,000 per year a decade earlier.

In 1961 the semaphore-style trafficators were replaced by flashing direction indicators. These were US-style red at the rear (using the same bulb filament as the brake lamp) and white at the front (using a second brighter filament in the parking lamp bulb) which was legal in the UK and many export markets at the time (such as New Zealand). On the two door cars, the rear wings were modified to remove the openings for the trafficators; on the 4-door, the B-pillar pressing was modified to leave a &quot;blank&quot; in place of the trafficator housing.

An upmarket car based on the Minor floorpan using the larger BMC B-Series engine was sold as the Riley One-Point-Five/Wolseley 1500 beginning in 1957: versions of this Wolseley/Riley variant were also produced by BMC Australia as the Morris Major and the Austin Lancer.

In December 1960 the Morris Minor became the first British car to sell more than 1,000,000 units. To commemorate the achievement, a limited edition of 350 two-door Minor saloons (one for each UK Morris dealership) was produced with distinctive lilac paintwork and a white leather interior with black piping. The badge name on the side of the bonnet was modified to read &quot;Minor 1000000&quot; instead of the standard &quot;Minor 1000&quot;. The millionth Minor was donated to the National Union of Journalists, which planned to use it as a prize in a competition in aid of the union&#x27;s Widow and Orphan Fund. The company, at the same time, presented a celebratory Minor to London&#x27;s Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, but this car was constructed of cake.

===Series V (ADO59)===
The final major upgrade to the Minor was made in 1962. Although the name &quot;Minor 1000&quot; was retained, the changes were sufficient for the new model to be given its own ADO development number. Morris chassis numbering convention refers to these cars as &#x27;Series V&#x27;, the &#x27;Series IV&#x27; designation having been assigned to the Morris Mini Minor.

A new, larger version of the existing A-Series engine had been developed in conjunction with cylinder head specialist Harry Weslake for the then new ADO16 Austin/Morris 1100 range. This new engine used a taller block than the 948 cc unit, with increased bore and stroke bringing total capacity up to 1,098 cc. Although fuel consumption suffered moderately at 38 mpg, the Minor&#x27;s top speed increased to , and a 20% increase in torque gave an altogether more responsive drive. The revised engine was teamed to a stronger gearbox fitted with baulk ring synchromesh replacing the previous cone-clutch type. Drum brakes were retained on each corner, but the front units were increased from in diameter. From October 1963, larger combined front side/indicator light units, common to many BMC vehicles of the time, were fitted to the front wings, and larger tail lamp units were fitted at the rear. Both incorporated separate amber flashers for directional indicators. In 1964 the interior received its final update, with a new heater unit (now with fresh air ventilation), and from October of that year, a modified dashboard with toggle switches, white-on-black speedometer unit (incorporating a warning light for a blocked oil filter), textured alloy fascia, new glove-box cover design (a fully enclosing bottom-hinged cover on the passenger side, and fixed open aperture surround on the driver&#x27;s side), and finally a two-spoke &#x27;safety&#x27; steering wheel (shared with the Morris 1100) were added.

From 1965, no further major production improvements were made to the Minor, with resource being channelled into improving the ADO16 (the Minor&#x27;s spiritual successor and Britain&#x27;s best-selling car in the 1960s), and development of the Morris Marina, which would succeed the Minor on the Cowley production lines in 1971.

In 1969, production of the Traveller variants was moved to the ex-Wolseley plant at Adderley Park, where the van and pick-up models were already made. This freed up production space at Cowley and simplified the production chain as the Traveller&#x27;s rear bodies were built at the Morris Bodies factory in Coventry. Adderley Park-built Travellers were offered in a new range of colours from the paint range that had been introduced for 1970, including vibrant shades such as Limeflower (lime green) and Aqua (turquoise). From 1971 Minors were fitted with a steering-column mounted ignition key and a steering lock rather than the facia-mounted ignition switch used up to that point.

==Decline and replacement==
During the life of the Minor 1000 model, production declined as the Mini and 1100/1300 had become BMC&#x27;s best selling models by the mid-1960s.

The last Convertible/Tourer was manufactured on 18 August 1969, and the final saloon model was built on November 12, 1970. Production of the more practical Traveller and commercial versions ceased in April 1971. According to Newell (1993), 1.6 million Minors were made in total and Wainwright (2008) even claims that 1,619,857 Minors of all variants were ultimately sold.
Overseas production in the form of ckd Kit Assembly continued in New Zealand until 1974.

The last new Morris Minor, a blue 4-door saloon, was assembled at The Brittans group, Dublin, in 1975; the same year British Leyland ordered the company to cease assembly of their vehicles for the Irish market.

In November 2020, on the 50th anniversary of the last saloon produced, it was announced that the final Morris Minor Saloon ever made had been fully restored by the Morris Minor Owners Club in Derby.

===The Minor vs Volkswagen===
The decline and cancellation of Minor production was source of some consternation by industry commentators in the late 1960s, who believed that further development of the car had the potential to challenge the Volkswagen Beetle in export markets. The Volkswagen, which was developed as a small family car with a very similar brief to the Minor, had been upgraded consistently over 25 years, and retained a healthy market share in export markets (especially developing countries), where it was very often the lowest priced new car on the market. It went on to achieve over 21 million units before cancellation in 2003. In the year of the Minor&#x27;s cancellation, 1971, over 1.3 million Beetles were produced, which was its maximum annual production. This corresponded to over 80% of total Minor production in 23 years, or ten times the production volume of Minors in their peak year of 1958 when 113,699 were built. Some historians also report that the Minor was being sold at a loss during its final years.

===Successors===
The Minor was officially replaced on the Cowley production lines by the Morris Marina (ADO28), which was developed primarily in response to Ford&#x27;s top-selling Escort. Building a larger mid-sized car capable of volume sales (particularly in the lucrative fleet-buying market) was becoming increasingly key in maintaining healthy sales figures, and was an issue BMC had consistently failed to address hitherto. The Marina was developed under the watchful eye of British Leyland management, and used a modified version of the Minor chassis floorplan, extended to increase the wheelbase by 10 inches. Many other Minor components, including much of the suspension, were used in the running gear, which served to streamline production changeover and minimise the financial outlay associated with chassis development and retooling.

The spiritual successor to the Morris Minor was arguably the ADO16 Austin/Morris 1100 range, which had been launched in 1962 and aimed at the same small family-car market (and actually replaced the Minor in some export markets such as Australia and New Zealand). The crisp styling, hydrolastic suspension and innovative front-wheel drive system (itself a &quot;scaling-up&quot; of the Mini principle) made ADO16 a worthy successor to the (in its day) forward-looking Minor. However, due to the British Motor Corporation&#x27;s commitment to both the Morris factory at Cowley, and Austin plant at Longbridge – in addition to a healthy demand for both products – production of the two cars continued in parallel for nearly 10 years. Indeed, production of ADO16 outlasted that of the Minor by only three years or so, before being replaced by the innovative, export-oriented, yet flawed Austin Allegro in 1973.

==Safety==
Despite the four major updates of the Minor in its 23-year production run, very few actively designed &quot;safety features&quot; were ever engineered into the Minor&#x27;s design. For a short time in 1968, the thickness of the steel used in the bonnet and doors was decreased from 1.2 mm to 1.0 mm to act as a form of crumple zone, but as the wings continued to be made of 1.4 mm mild steel, the modification was pointless and ineffectual and was reversed in 1969 as it increased passenger compartment crush in collisions.

The 1950 change from the &quot;lowlight&quot; model was made to comply with Canadian lighting standards, with higher and brighter headlights to increase visibility in fog and during dark Canadian winters.

Australian models, and tourer models made in Britain and exported to Australia, featured safety glass windscreens and safety glass windows, to comply with local regulations. Australian models also had blinking indicator lights in addition to the standard trafficator arms on the indigenous Minor 1000.

==Morris quarter ton van and pick-up==
Closed van and open flat-bed (&quot;pick-up&quot;) versions of the Minor were built from 1953 until the end of production. They were designed for commercial use with small businesses, although many were also used by larger corporations. Van versions were popular with the General Post Office, the early versions of these (to around 1956) having rubber front wings to cope with the sometimes unforgiving busy situations in which they were expected to work. Both the van and the pickup differed from the monocoque construction of the Saloon and Traveller variants by having a separate chassis. They also differed in details such as telescopic rear dampers, stiffer rear leaf springs and lower-ratio differentials to cope with heavier loads.

The commercial versions were initially marketed as the Morris Quarter Ton Van and Pick-up, with a Series III designation applied from 1956. The names Morris 6cwt Van and Pickup was used following the introduction of the 1098cc engine in 1962 and 8cwt versions were added in 1968 with more substantial rear leaf springs.

As BMC&#x27;s policy was to provide both Austin and Morris with complete commercial vehicle ranges, Austin-badged variants of the Minor van and pick-up were sold following the end of Austin A35 production in 1968. These featured Austin badging and the corporate Austin &#x27;crinkle-cut&#x27; radiator grille but were otherwise identical to the standard Minor commercials, and were sold as the Austin 6cwt and Austin 8cwt.


==Morris Minor today==
Today the Morris Minor and 1000 are among the best-served classic family-sized cars in the old vehicle movement and continue to gain popularity. The enduring affection for the &quot;Moggie&quot; (also a common British nickname for an undistinguished cat, or a Morgan) or &quot;Morrie&quot; (as it is often known in Australia and New Zealand) is reflected in the number of restored and improved Morris Minors currently running in Britain and Australasia. In addition to more powerful engines, desirable improvements necessitated by the increase in traffic density since the Minor was withdrawn from volume production include the replacement of the original equipment drum brakes with discs. Other important upgrades include the version of the A-series engine, derided by Morris Marina enthusiasts as a key reason why many Marinas were scrapped, and the similarly sized Nissan A engine, which shares all common dimensions to the Morris Minor engine, except piston size. &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenter Jeremy Clarkson once stated that the Morris Minor is Britain&#x27;s Volkswagen Beetle (although this was meant in a derogatory way rather than favourably). There is still an extensive parts backup for these cars, and parts are cheap compared to modern day cars.

Replacement panels for the Morris Minor were still being made in 2002 by the Durable Car Company in Sri Lanka.

=== Cancelled Revival ===
Following the bankruptcy of the MG Rover Group in 2005, three competing bids were launched aiming to acquire the company&#x27;s assets, including the hardware to manufacture the Rover 25, 45 and 75 models, as well as the K-Series engine. One of the bids, led by Maserati CEO Martin Leach alongside Chinese state-owned Shanghai Automotive Industries Corporation (SAIC), included plans for a Morris Minor revival. According to reports, the proposal was entirely Leach&#x27;s idea and was seen as essential to his vision for the revival of MG Rover. The car would likely have been built on a planned &#x27;monospace mini&#x27; platform, and used the Rover K-Series engine. The idea was not revealed to the public, presumably to prevent competitors from discovering the proposal, and information regarding the project was only released in 2024.

Despite initially being met with optimism, the bid was lost to the Nanjing Automobile Corporation and the new Minor was not produced, although Nanjing Automobile Corporation later merged with SAIC, with all assets, including the Morris marque, being transferred to SAIC.

<doc id="897403" wikidata="Q8035703" url="?curid=897403" title="World Fantasy Award—Anthology">
<text>The World Fantasy Awards are given each year by the World Fantasy Convention for the best fantasy fiction published in English during the previous calendar year. The awards have been described by book critics such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a &quot;prestigious fantasy prize&quot;, and one of the three most prestigious speculative fiction awards, along with the Hugo and Nebula Awards (which cover both fantasy and science fiction). The World Fantasy Award—Anthology is given each year for anthologies of fantasy stories by multiple authors published in English. An anthology can have any number of editors, and works in the anthology may have been previously published; awards are also given out for collections of works by a single author in the Collection category. The Anthology category has been awarded annually since 1988, though from 1977 through 1987 anthologies were admissible as nominees in the Collection category. During the ten years they were admissible for that category they won the award seven times and represented 38 of the 56 nominations.

World Fantasy Award nominees and winners are decided by attendees and judges at the annual World Fantasy Convention. A ballot is posted in June for attendees of the current and previous two conferences to determine two of the finalists, and a panel of five judges adds three or more nominees before voting on the overall winner. The panel of judges is typically made up of fantasy authors and is chosen each year by the World Fantasy Awards Administration, which has the power to break ties. The final results are presented at the World Fantasy Convention at the end of October. Winners were presented with a statue in the form of a bust of H. P. Lovecraft through the 2015 awards; more recent winners receive a statuette of a tree.

During the 37 nomination years, 137 editors have had works nominated; 41 of them have won, including co-editors. Only six editors have won more than once. Ellen Datlow has won 8 times out of 39 nominations, the most of any editor; Terri Windling has won 6 times out of 18 nominations, all of the nominations as a co-editor with Datlow; Jeff VanderMeer has two wins each out of seven nominations, with both wins and five nominations shared with Ann VanderMeer; Jack Dann has won twice out of five nominations; Sheree Thomas and Dennis Etchison have won twice out of three nominations, and Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki was won both of his nominations. After Datlow and Windling, the editors with the most nominations are Stephen Jones, who has won once out of fifteen nominations, Gardner Dozois, who has won once out of seven nominations, Jonathan Strahan, who has won once out of six nominations, and John Joseph Adams, David Sutton, and Martin H. Greenberg, who each have been nominated six times without winning.

==Winners and nominees==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the anthology was first published. Each year links to the corresponding &quot;year in literature&quot;. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the editor&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist.

<doc id="897414" wikidata="Q7318893" url="?curid=897414" title="Revolutionary Workers Ferment">
<text>The Revolutionary Workers Ferment, often known by its Spanish name or initials Fomento Obrero Revolucionario or FOR, was a small Trotskyist international founded by Grandizo Munis, which arose as a split from the Fourth International at its Second Congress in 1948. 

Though Munis and his co-thinkers carried on polemics with other currents of Trotskyst origin for three decades, and it was only in the late 1970s that a formal organization was formed. The FOR only held one international conference, at Paris in 1981. At that conference a split emerged between, on the one hand the &quot;interior&quot; Spanish section based in Spain, supported by the FOCUS group in the United States, and the Spanish &quot;exile&quot; faction based in Paris, along with the French section. The interior Spanish and American groups were expelled from the FOR.

Munis and the FOR had developed an &quot;ultraleft&quot; policy: they were opposed to the &quot;Communist&quot; states, regarding them as state capitalist; they were opposed to the capitalist system and its form of government; they did not believe in parliamentarism, political parties or trade unions; they did not believe in any kind of nationalism or national liberation struggles and affirmed the &quot;inevitable necessity of the communist revolution on a world scale&quot;.

== Sections ==
Groups associated with the FOR included

*FOR Organizing Committee of the United States in the United States

*Synagermos in Greece
*Allerma in Spain

<doc id="897417" wikidata="Q1757958" url="?curid=897417" title="Matt Robinson (actor)">
<text>Matthew Thomas Robinson Jr. (January 1, 1937 – August 5, 2002) was an American actor, writer and television producer. Robinson was the first actor to portray the character of Gordon Robinson on the PBS children&#x27;s TV program &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. When &quot;Sesame Street&quot; began in 1969, not only did Robinson play Gordon, but he also provided the voice of the puppet Roosevelt Franklin and was one of the show&#x27;s producers. He left the show in 1972. In later years, when producers needed a last name for the Gordon character, then played by Hal Miller and later Roscoe Orman, they used Matt&#x27;s last name.

He wrote and produced the films &quot;Save the Children&quot; and &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; in the early 1970s, and authored scripts for &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; and &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;. In 1983, he joined the staff of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; as a producer and staff writer. By that time, he was beginning to show symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, but stayed with the show for seven seasons despite the difficulty. He ultimately died from the disease on August 5, 2002, in Los Angeles at the age of 65.

==Family, early life==
Born Matthew Thomas Robinson Jr., in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Matthew Robinson Sr. and Marie (&quot;née&quot; Henson) Robinson on January 1, 1937. His father worked as a postal worker and one of the first African American columnists for &quot;The Philadelphia Independent&quot; newspaper, while his mother worked as an elementary-school teacher.

Robinson attended West Philadelphia High School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before going on to Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pennsylvania, and graduating in 1958 with a degree from the College of the Liberal Arts and Sciences. While at Penn State, Robinson was elected president of the Penn State Omega Psi Phi fraternity, one of the first African-American fraternities founded at a prominently African-American college or university—Howard University in Washington, D.C.

==Career==
In 1962, Robinson wrote a slave revolt drama titled &quot;Rained All Night&quot;.

He began his media career in 1963 as a writer, and soon after producer and on-air talent, at television station WCAU-TV in his hometown of Philadelphia. Robinson produced and hosted &quot;Opportunity in Philadelphia&quot;, a weekly televised employment service oriented toward African Americans. By televising job opportunities, &quot;Opportunity in Philadelphia&quot; sought to allay the apprehension many minorities felt when looking for work. Robinson established his talent at WCAU, ultimately leading to future successes as a producer and actor.

===&quot;Sesame Street&quot;===
Robinson&#x27;s television breakthrough came in 1969 when he joined the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW) to assist in the development of a new children&#x27;s program for National Educational Television titled &quot;Sesame Street.&quot; His initial role was to produce and oversee filmed segments focusing on the diversity of different characters on the show. Robinson was eventually chosen to play the fictional character of Gordon in the series, after the performance of the character in test episodes by another actor, Garrett Saunders, did not work out as the producers had hoped. Gordon was the first character with spoken lines on the show, as a result of difficulty in finding someone to fill the figure. This was against Robinson&#x27;s original intentions upon joining the show, as he preferred a behind-the-scenes role, and was initially reluctant to take the part. Dolores Robinson commented on his backseat role on the set: &quot;He was by nature shy, and he knew that they were having a difficult time casting Gordon. And the people overseeing the taping up in the booth, peering at the monitors, kept saying, &#x27;Matt knows what to do. He should be Gordon.&#x27;” Robinson remained with Sesame Street until 1972.

In total four actors have played Gordon. In addition to Robinson, Roscoe Orman, Garrett Saunders, and Hal Miller have filled the role. Each actor&#x27;s tenure is not exactly clear with some sources citing Roscoe Orman beginning in 1974 and others in 1973. Later, when Gordon and Susan needed a surname, Robinson&#x27;s was used in tribute.

Robinson wrote one of the first &quot;Sesame Street&quot;-themed storybooks in 1972, titled &quot;Gordon of Sesame Street&#x27;s Storybook&quot;. It was composed of four of his originally written children stories, &quot;No More Milk&quot;, &quot;Fisher-Man&quot;, &quot;Fire-Man,&quot; and &quot;A Lot of Hot Water&quot;. The cover has a Gordon Robinson caricature reading to different children.

====Roosevelt Franklin====
While with CTW, Robinson also played the voice of a reddish-magenta puppet named Roosevelt Franklin. Robinson worked closely with Jim Henson to accurately design the character, the first black-influenced Muppet. Other minority-based Muppets created by Henson and Robinson were Baby Ray Francis, Mobley Mose and a Latino Muppet, A.B. Cito. Roosevelt Franklin promoted ideals such as family, pride, respect, and geography while also showing a passion for rhyming and blues music. By both creating the character and performing Franklin&#x27;s voice for three seasons, Robinson helped his puppet become one of the show&#x27;s main characters. In addition, Franklin continued to make appearances until 1975.

The puppet was pulled from the show because a negative perception of the character among African Americans began to grow. This resulted from Franklin&#x27;s frequently unruly behavior at the fictional elementary school, which was deemed a bad example for the audience. Additional arguments for the character&#x27;s departure were rooted in its overly excessive black image, or lack thereof. Dolores Robinson has stated that Roosevelt Franklin became a televised vehicle for her then-husband&#x27;s anger with racism and pride in black people.

Robinson recorded and released the first Sesame Street album to be focused on a single character, &quot;The Year of Roosevelt Franklin (Gordon&#x27;s Friend from Sesame Street).&quot; Released in 1971, and then re-released in 1974 under the name &quot;My Name is Roosevelt Franklin&quot;, the album dealt with many appropriate behaviors for children; aside from basic topics such as numbers and letters, it also touched on traffic safety, sharing and getting along with others. All tracks were co-written with the help of Joe Raposo. The album was again released on compact disc in 2010 as a part of a set titled &quot;Old School: Volume 2&quot;, also including &quot;Grover Sings the Blues&quot; and &quot;The Count Counts&quot;.

===Post-&quot;Sesame Street&quot;===
Following his time with CTW, Robinson continued to produce and write for movies, television and the stage. He wrote and produced, under the direction of Stan Lathan, &quot;Save The Children&quot; (1973), a musical performance that was a spinoff of a black exposition conducted by People to Save Humanity. Robinson would continue his work as a producer and writer in the 1974 film &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, which was about a group of neighbors seeking to overthrow some shady, money-hungry politicians.

After leaving &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, Robinson returned to Philadelphia and to WCAU-TV, where he starred on &quot;The Candy Apple News Company&quot;, a locally produced children&#x27;s show where a small human cast interacted with puppets in a radio and newspaper office. Other post-&quot;Sesame Street&quot; work included writing episodes for &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, &quot;The Waltons&quot; and &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;, and writing and producing for CBS&#x27;s children&#x27;s series &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;.

===&quot;The Cosby Show&quot; (1983–1990)===
In 1983, Robinson joined the crew of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; as a producer and writer. The family sitcom, which aired from 1984 for eight seasons until 1992, revolved around the life of the Huxtable family – an affluent African-American family in Brooklyn, New York. Robinson transitioned between writer, executive story consultant, executive story editor and soundtrack writer for over 50 episodes of the show, eventually becoming a co-producer. He acted in one episode, &quot;Cliff&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;, as a French scientist.

===&quot;The Confessions of Stepin Fetchit&quot; (1993)===
Written by Robinson and directed by Bill Lathan, &quot;The Confessions of Stepin Fetchit&quot; is a one-man play that focuses on Lincoln Perry, who was a popular black comic character in 1930s films but soon came under fire by civil rights advocates. The play was meant as a call to history as well as a discussion forum for reflection on Perry&#x27;s life story as one of America&#x27;s first black movie stars.

==Personal life==
Matt and his wife Dolores had two children, Matthew Thomas Robinson III and Holly Elizabeth Robinson (born September 18, 1964), before divorcing.

==Death==
Robinson was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 1982 at the age of 45 and battled the disease for 20 years. In 1997, during her father&#x27;s struggle with the disease, daughter Holly Robinson Peete and her husband, NFL quarterback Rodney Peete, started the HollyRod Foundation. The foundation was created to reach out to all those affected by Parkinson&#x27;s disease or autism and provide medical, physical and emotional support. Located within the Center for Parkinson&#x27;s Research and Movement Disorders at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, the HollyRod Foundation is able to provide low or no-cost treatment as well as various services to the underserved in greater Los Angeles. His son Matt also developed Parkinson&#x27;s.

Robinson died in his sleep at his Los Angeles home on Monday, August 5, 2002, at the age of 65. A memorial service was held on the morning of Friday, August 9, 2002, at The Writers Guild of America Theatre in Beverly Hills, California. He is survived by daughter and actress Holly Robinson Peete, son and production assistant Matthew Robinson III, former spouse Dolores Robinson and five grandchildren.

<text>This article discusses the history of whaling from prehistoric times up to the commencement of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. Whaling has been an important subsistence and economic activity in multiple regions throughout human history. Commercial whaling dramatically reduced in importance during the 19th century due to the development of alternatives to whale oil for lighting, and the collapse in whale populations. Nevertheless, some nations continue to hunt whales even today.

== Early history ==

Humans have engaged in whaling since prehistoric times. Early depictions of whaling at the Neolithic Bangudae site in Korea, unearthed by researchers from Kyungpook National University, may date back to 6000BCE. The University of Alaska Fairbanks has described evidence for whaling at least as early as circa 1000BCE.

The oldest known method of catching cetaceans is dolphin drive hunting, in which a number of small boats are positioned between the animal and the open sea and the animals are herded towards shore in an attempt to beach them. This method is still used for smaller species such as pilot whales, beluga whales, porpoises and narwhals, as described in &quot;A Pattern of Islands&quot;, a memoir published by British administrator Arthur Grimble in 1952.

Another early method used a drogue (a semi-floating object) such as a wooden drum or an inflated sealskin tied to an arrow or a harpoon. Once the missile had been shot into a whale&#x27;s body, the buoyancy and drag from the drogue would eventually cause the whale to tire, allowing it to be approached and killed. Cultures that practiced whaling with drogues included the Ainu, Inuit, Native Americans, and the Basque people of the Bay of Biscay. The Bangudae petroglyphs show sperm whales, humpback whales and North Pacific right whales surrounded by boats, and suggest that drogues, harpoons and lines were being used to kill small whales as early as 6000BCE. Cetacean bones of the same period were also found in the area, reflecting the importance of whales in the diet of prehistoric coastal people.

Whale bones recovered near the Strait of Gibraltar raise the possibility that whales were hunted in the Mediterranean Sea by ancient Rome.

== Whaling history by region ==

=== North America ===

====Newfoundland and Labrador====
Around 1525 Basques began whaling and fishing for cod off Newfoundland, Labrador, and similar places. In his &quot;History of Brittany&quot; (1582), the French jurist and historian Bertrand d&#x27;Argentré made the claim that the Basques, Bretons, and Normans were the first to reach the New World &quot;before any other people&quot;. The Bordeaux jurist Etienne de Cleirac (1647) made a similar claim, stating that the French Basques, in pursuing whales across the North Atlantic, discovered North America a century before Columbus. The Belgian cetologist Pierre-Joseph van Beneden (1878, 1892) repeated such assertions by saying that the Basques, in the year 1372, found the number of whales to increase on approach of the Newfoundland Banks.

The first undisputed presence of Basque whaling expeditions in the New World was in the second quarter of the 16th century. It appears to have been the French Basques, following the lead of Breton cod-fishermen that reported finding rich whaling grounds in &quot;Terranova&quot; (Newfoundland). The Basques called the area they frequented &quot;Grandbaya&quot; (Grand Bay), today known as the Strait of Belle Isle, which separates Newfoundland from southern Labrador. Their initial voyages to this area were mixed cod and whaling ventures. Instead of returning home with whale oil, they brought back whale meat in brine. The French Basque ship &quot;La Catherine d&#x27;Urtubie&quot; made the first known voyage involving whale products in 1530, when she supposedly returned with 4,500 dried and cured cod, as well as twelve barrels of whale meat &quot;without flippers or tail&quot; (a phrase for whale meat in brine). After a period of development, expeditions were sent purely aimed at obtaining whale oil. The first establishments for processing whale oil in southern Labrador may have been built in the late 1530s, although it wasn&#x27;t until 1548 that notarial documents confirm this.

By the 1540s, when the Spanish Basques began sending whaling expeditions to Newfoundland, the ventures were no longer experimental, but a &quot;resounding financial success from their inception.&quot; By the end of the decade they were delivering large cargoes of whale oil to Bristol, London, and Flanders. A large market existed for &quot;lumera&quot;, as whale oil used for lighting was called. &quot;Sain&quot; or &quot;grasa de ballena&quot; was also used (by mixing it with tar and oakum) for caulking ships, as well as in the textile industry. Ambroise Paré (1510–90), who visited Bayonne when King Charles IX (r. 1560–74) was there in 1564, said they used the baleen to &quot;make farthingales, stays for women, knife-handles, and many other things&quot;.

Most documents dealing with whaling in Newfoundland concern the years 1548 to 1588, with the largest quantity dealing with the harbor of Red Bay or &quot;Less Buttes&quot;⁠—both names in reference to the red granite cliffs of the region. The references include acts of piracy in the 1550s, the loss of a ship in 1565, a disastrous wintering in 1576–77, and, on Christmas Eve 1584, a will written for a dying Basque, Joanes de Echaniz; the first known Canadian will. The last overwintering in Red Bay was made in 1603. During their onshore stays, the whalers developed relations with North American natives that led to the establishment of a purpose-specific language with both American native and Basque elements.
==== United States of America ====


Beginning in the late colonial period, the United States grew to become the preeminent whaling nation in the world by the 1830s. American whaling&#x27;s origins were in New York and New England, including Cape Cod, Massachusetts and nearby cities. Whale oil was in demand chiefly for lamps. By the 18th century whaling in Nantucket had become a highly lucrative deep-sea industry, with voyages extending for years at a time and traveling as far as South Pacific waters. During the American Revolution, the British navy targeted American whaling ships as legitimate prizes. In turn, many whalers fitted out as privateers against the British.

Whaling recovered after the war ended in 1783 and the industry began to prosper, using bases at Nantucket and then New Bedford. Whalers took greater economic risks in search of profit, expanding their hunting grounds. Investment and financing arrangements allowed managers of whaling ventures to share their risks by selling some equity, but retain a substantial portion of the profit. As a result, they had little incentive to plan their voyages to minimize risk.

Ten thousand seamen manned the ships, including more than 3,000 African American seamen. Early whaling efforts concentrated on right whales and humpbacks, which were found near the American coast. As these populations declined and the market for whale products grew, American whalers began hunting sperm whales. The sperm whale was particularly prized for spermaceti, a dense waxy substance that burns with an exceedingly bright flame that is found in the spermaceti organ, located forward and above the skull. (In fact, the measurement of luminosity, or light, is called Candlepower, and its very definition is measured as the light put out by a spermaceti candle.) 

Hunting sperm whales required longer whaling voyages, and soon New Bedford and Nantucket whalemen were ranging the globe, cruising &quot;whaling grounds&quot; off of Japan, off the coast of Peru and Ecuador, and along the equatorial regions of the Pacific Ocean.

Whale oil was essential for illuminating homes and businesses in the 19th century, and lubricated the machines of the Industrial Revolution. Manufacturers in the United States and Europe prized the long keratin plates (called baleen) found in the mouths of whale species like the right whale and the humpback whale. The Baleen Whales used these fringed plates as a sort of &quot;sieve&quot; to strain small food items out of the water. For humans, the baleen went to work in the form of corset stays and umbrella ribs and the like.

British competition and import duties drove New England whaling ships out of the North Atlantic and into the southern oceans, ultimately making whaling into a global economic enterprise. The mid 19th century was the golden age of American whaling.

From the Civil War, when Confederate raiders targeted American whalers, through the early 20th century, the American whaling industry suffered economic competition, especially from kerosene, a superior fuel for lighting.

===== Localities =====

A number of New England towns were heavily involved in whaling, particularly Nantucket and New Bedford. Nantucket began whaling in 1690 after recruiting a whaling instructor, Ichabod Paddock. The south side of the island was divided into three and a half mile sections, each with a mast erected to look for the spouts of right whales. Once a whale was sighted, rowing boats were sent from the shore. If the whale was successfully killed it was towed ashore, flensed (i.e., the blubber was cut off), and the blubber boiled in cauldrons known as &quot;try pots&quot;. Even when whales were caught far offshore, the blubber was still boiled on shore well into the 18th century. New Bedford whaling was established when prominent Nantucket whaling families moved their operations to the town for economic reasons, and made New Bedford the fourth busiest port in the United States. In Herman Melville&#x27;s novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; the narrator passes through New Bedford before beginning his whaling voyage from Nantucket.

In the late 1870s, schooners began hunting humpbacks in the Gulf of Maine. In 1880, with the decline of menhaden fish, steamers began to switch to hunting fin and humpback whales using bomb lances. This has been called &quot;shoot-and-salvage&quot; because of the high-rate of loss due to whales sinking, lines breaking, etc. The first such whale hunting ship was the steamer &quot;Mabel Bird&quot;, which towed whale carcasses to an oil processing plant in Boothbay Harbor. At its height in 1885 four or five steamers were engaged in whale fishery at Boothbay Harbour, dwindling to one by the end of the decade. Over 100 whales were killed annually during some years. The fishery ended in the late 1890s.

===== Technological advancement =====
In the 1850s, the Euro–American whalemen began a serious attempt at catching rorquals such as the blue whale and fin whale. In the 1860s Captain Thomas Welcome Roys invented a rocket harpoon, making a significant contribution to the development of the California whaling industry. In 1877, John Nelson Fletcher, a pyrotechnist, and a former Confederate soldier, Robert L. Suits, modified Roys&#x27;s rocket, marketing it as the &quot;California Whaling Rocket&quot;. The rocket was highly effective in killing whales.

Danish naval officer Captain Otto C. Hammer and the Dutchman Captain C. J. Bottemanne also imitated Roys&#x27; rocket harpoon. Hammer formed the Danish Fishing Company, which operated from 1865 to 1871. Botteman formed the Netherlands Whaling Company, which operated from 1869 to 1872.

===== Legacy =====
In 1996, the New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park was established, offering exhibits on the history of the &quot;City that Lit the World&quot;.

==== Pacific Northwest ====

Whaling on the Pacific Northwest Coast encompassed both aboriginal and commercial whaling. The indigenous peoples of this coast have whaling traditions dating back millennia. A memoir by John R. Jewitt, an English blacksmith who spent three years as a captive of the Nuu-chah-nulth people from 1802 to 1805, makes clear the importance of whale meat and oil to their diet. Whaling was integral to the cultures and economies of other indigenous people as well, notably the Makah and Klallam. For other groups, especially the Haida, whales appear prominently as totems.

Hunting of cetaceans continues by Alaska Natives (mainly beluga and narwhal, plus subsistence hunting of the bowhead whale) and to a lesser extent by the Makah (gray whale). Commercial whaling in British Columbia and southeast Alaska ended in the late 1960s.

===Bering Strait===

In the 1840s, large numbers of bowhead whale were discovered around the Bering Strait. In 1848, American whaler Thomas Welcome Roys returned with a significant catch which drew the industry&#x27;s attention. More than 500 whales were caught the following year and more than 2,000 in 1850. The whaling boom drew more than 220 ships in 1852 but it collapsed almost as soon as it began, with catches severely diminishing in 1853.

=== Basque Country (Spain and France) ===

The first mention of Basque whaling was made in 1059, when it was said to have been practiced at the Basque town of Bayonne. The fishery spread to what is now the Spanish Basque Country in 1150, when King Sancho the Wise of Navarre granted petitions for the warehousing of such commodities as whalebone (baleen). At first, they hunted the North Atlantic right whale, using watchtowers (known as vigias) to look for their distinctive twin vapor spouts.

By the 14th century, Basque whalers were making &quot;seasonal trips&quot; to the English Channel and southern Ireland. The fishery spread to Terranova (Labrador and Newfoundland) in the second quarter of the 16th century, and to Iceland by the early 17th century. They established whaling stations in Terranova, mainly in Red Bay, and hunted bowheads as well as right whales.

The fishery in Terranova declined for a variety of reasons, including the conflicts between Spain and other European powers during the late 16th and early 17th centuries, attacks by hostile Inuit, declining whale populations, and perhaps the opening up of the Spitsbergen fishery in 1611.

The first voyages to Spitsbergen by the English, Dutch, and Danish relied on Basque specialists, with the Basque provinces sending out their own whaler in 1612. The following season San Sebastián and Saint-Jean-de-Luz sent out a combined eleven or twelve whalers to the Spitsbergen fishery, but most were driven off by the Dutch and English. Two more ships were sent by a merchant in San Sebastián in 1615, but both were driven away by the Dutch. Conflict over the Spitsbergen whaling grounds between the English, French, Dutch and Danish continued until 1638.

Whale fishing in Iceland and Spitsbergen continued at least into the 18th century, but Basque whaling in those regions appears to have ended in 1756 at the beginning of the Seven Years&#x27; War.

===Greenland and Spitsbergen===


Encouraged by reports of whales off the coast of Spitsbergen, Norway, in 1610, the English Muscovy Company (also known as the Russian Company) sent a whaling expedition there the following year. The expedition was a disaster, with both ships sent being lost. The crews returned to England in a ship from Hull. The following year two more ships were sent. Other countries followed suit, with Amsterdam and San Sebastian each sending a ship north. The latter ship returned to Spain with a full cargo of oil. Such a fabulous return resulted in a fleet of whaleships being sent to Spitsbergen in 1613. The Muscovy Company sent seven, backed by a monopoly charter granted by King James I. They met with twenty other whaleships (eleven or twelve Basque, five French, and three Dutch), as well as a London interloper, which were either ordered away or forced to pay a fine of some sort. The United Provinces, France, and Spain all protested against this treatment, but James I held fast to his claim of sovereignty over Spitsbergen.
The following three and a half decades witnessed numerous clashes between the various nations (as well as infighting among the English), often merely posturing, but sometimes resulting in bloodshed. This jealousy stemmed as much from the mechanics of early whaling as from straightforward international animosities. In the first years of the fishery England, France, the United Provinces and later Denmark–Norway shipped expert Basque whalemen for their expeditions. At the time Basque whaling relied on the utilization of stations ashore where blubber could be processed into oil. In order to allow a rapid transference of this technique to Spitsbergen, suitable anchorages had to be selected, of which there were only a limited number, in particular on the west coast of the island.
Early in 1614, the Dutch formed the &quot;Noordsche Compagnie&quot; (Northern Company), a cartel composed of several independent chambers (each representing a particular port). The company sent fourteen ships supported by three or four men-of-war this year, while the English sent a fleet of thirteen ships and pinnaces. Equally matched, they agreed to split the coast between themselves, to the exclusion of third parties. The English received the four principal harbors in the middle of the west coast, while the Dutch could settle anywhere to the south or north. The agreement explicitly stated that it was only meant to last for this season.
In 1615 the Dutch arrived with a fleet of eleven ships and three men-of-war under Adriaen Block, occupied Fairhaven, Bell Sound, and Horn Sound by force, and built the first permanent structure on Spitsbergen: a wooden hut to store their equipment in. The ten ships sent by the Muscovy Company were relegated to the south side of Fairhaven, Sir Thomas Smith&#x27;s Bay, and Ice Sound. The Danes meanwhile sent a fleet of five sail under Gabriel Kruse to demand a toll from the foreign whalers and in doing so assert Christian IV&#x27;s claim of sovereignty over the region, but both the English and Dutch rebuffed his efforts—two ships from Bordeaux chartered by a merchant in San Sebastian were also sent away by the Dutch. The following year, 1616, the English, with a fleet of ten ships, occupied all the major harbors, appropriated the Dutch hut, and made a rich haul, while the Dutch, preoccupied with Jan Mayen, only sent four ships to Spitsbergen, which &quot;kept together in odd places... and made a poor voyage.&quot;
In 1617 a ship from Vlissingen whaling in Horn Sound had its cargo seized by the English vice-admiral. Angry, the following season the Dutch sent nearly two dozen ships to Spitsbergen. Five of the fleet attacked two English ships, killing three men in the process, and also burned down the English station in Horn Sound. Negotiations between the two nations followed in 1619, with James I, while still claiming sovereignty, would not enforce it for the following three seasons. When this concession expired, the English twice (in 1623 and 1624) tried to expel the Dutch from Spitsbergen, failing both times.
In 1619 the Dutch and Danes, who had sent their first whaling expedition to Spitsbergen in 1617, firmly settled themselves on Amsterdam Island, a small island on the northwestern tip of Spitsbergen; while the English did the same in the fjords to the south. The Danish–Dutch settlement came to be called Smeerenburg, which would become the centre of operations for the latter in the first decades of the fishery. Numerous place names attest to the various nations&#x27; presence, including Copenhagen Bay (&quot;Kobbefjorden&quot;) and Danes Island (&quot;Danskøya&quot;), where the Danes established a station from 1631 to 1658; Port Louis or Refuge Français (&quot;Hamburgbukta&quot;), where the French had a station from 1633 to 1638, until they were driven away by the Danes (see below); and finally English Bay (&quot;Engelskbukta&quot;), as well as the number of features named by English whalemen and explorers—for example, Isfjorden, Bellsund, and Hornsund, to name a few.
Hostilities continued after 1619. In 1626 nine ships from Hull and York destroyed the Muscovy Company&#x27;s fort and station in Bell Sound, and sailed to their own in Midterhukhamna. Here they were found by the heavily armed flagship of the London whaling fleet; a two-hour battle ensued, resulting in defeat for the Hull and York fleet and their expulsion from Spitsbergen. In 1630 both the ships of Hull and Great Yarmouth, who had recently joined the trade, were driven away clean (empty) by the ships from London. From 1631 to 1633, the Danes, French, and Dutch quarreled with each other, resulting in the expulsion of the Danes from Smeerenburg and the French from Copenhagen Bay. In 1634 the Dutch burned down one of the Danes&#x27; huts. There were also two battles this season, one between the English and French (the latter won) and the other between London and Yarmouth (the latter won, as well). In 1637 and again in 1638 the Danes drove the French out of Port Louis and seized their cargoes. In the former year they also seized a French ship in the open sea and detained it in Copenhagen Bay, while in the latter year they also held two Dutch ships captive in the same bay for over a month, which led to protests from the Dutch. Following the events of 1638 hostilities, for the most part, ceased, with the exception of a few minor incidents in the 1640s between the French and Danes, as well as between Copenhagen and Hamburg and London and Yarmouth, respectively.
The species hunted was the bowhead whale, a baleen whale that yielded large quantities of oil and baleen. The whales entered the fjords in the spring following the breakup of the ice. They were spotted by the whalemen from suitable vantage points, and pursued by &quot;shallops&quot;, &quot;chaloupes&quot; or &quot;chalupas&quot;, which were manned by six men. (These terms derive from the Basque word &quot;txalupa&quot;, used to name the whaling boats that were widely utilized during the golden era of Basque whaling in Labrador in the 16th century.) The whale was harpooned and lanced to death and either towed to the stern of the ship or to the shore at low tide, where men with long knives would flense (cut up) the blubber. The blubber was boiled in large copper kettles and cooled in large wooden vessels, after which it was funneled into casks. The stations at first only consisted of tents of sail and crude furnaces, but were soon replaced by more permanent structures of wood and brick, such as Smeerenburg for the Dutch, Lægerneset for the English, and Copenhagen Bay for the Danes.
Beginning in the 1630s, for the Dutch at least, whaling expanded into the open sea. Gradually whaling in the open sea and along the ice floes to the west of Spitsbergen replaced bay whaling. At first, the blubber was tried out at the end of the season at Smeerenburg or elsewhere along the coast, but after mid-century the stations were abandoned entirely in favor of processing the blubber upon the return of the ship to port. The English meanwhile stuck resolutely to bay whaling, and didn&#x27;t make the transfer to pelagic (offshore) whaling until long after.
In 1719, the Dutch began &quot;regular and intensive whaling&quot; in the Davis Strait, between Greenland and Canada&#x27;s Baffin Island. The British South Sea Company financed 172 whaling voyages to Greenland from London&#x27;s Howland Dock between 1725 and 1732. Beginning in 1733, the British Government offered a &#x27;bounty&#x27; for whale oil, leading to further expansion. However, due to reductions in the bounty and wars with America and France, London&#x27;s Greenland fleet fell to 19 in 1796.

During the 17th and 18th century North Frisian Islanders had a reputation of being very skilled mariners, and most Dutch and English whaling ships bound for Greenland and Svalbard would recruit their crew from these islands. Around the year 1700, Föhr island had a total population of roughly 6,000, of whom 1,600 were whalers. In 1762, 25% of all shipmasters on Dutch whaling vessels were people from Föhr, and the South Sea Company&#x27;s commanding officers and harpooners were exclusively from Föhr. Sylt island and Borkum island were also notable homes of whaling personnel.

The British would continue to send out whalers to the Arctic fishery into the 20th century, sending their last on the eve of the First World War.

=== Japan ===
The oldest written mention of whaling in Japanese records is from Kojiki, the oldest Japanese historical book, which was written in the 7th century CE. This book describes whale meat being eaten by Emperor Jimmu. In Man&#x27;yōshū, an anthology of poems from the 8th century CE, the word &quot;Whaling&quot; (いさなとり) was frequently used in depicting the ocean or beaches.

One of the first records of whaling using harpoons is from the 1570s at Morosaki, a bay attached to Ise Bay. This method of whaling spread to Kii (before 1606), Shikoku (1624), northern Kyushu (1630s), and Nagato (around 1672).

Kakuemon Wada, later known as Kakuemon Taiji, was said to have invented net whaling sometime between 1675 and 1677. This method soon spread to Shikoku (1681) and northern Kyushu (1684)

Using the techniques developed by Taiji, the Japanese mainly hunted four species of whale: the North Pacific right, the humpback, the fin, and the gray whale. They also caught the occasional blue, sperm, or sei/Bryde&#x27;s whale .

In 1853, the US naval officer Matthew Perry forced Japan to open up to foreign trade. One purpose of his mission was to gain access to ports for the American whaling fleet in the north-west Pacific Ocean. Japan&#x27;s traditional whaling was eventually replaced in the late 19th century and early 20th century with modern methods.

=== Britain ===
Britain&#x27;s involvement in whaling extended from 1611 to the 1960s and had three phases. The Northern (or Arctic) whale fishery lasted from 1611 to 1914 and involved whaling primarily off Greenland, and particularly the Davis Strait. The Southern (or South Seas) whale fishery was active from 1775 to 1859 and involved whale hunting first in the South Atlantic, then in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. British law defined and differentiated the two trades. Finally, modern British involvement in whaling extended from 1904 to 1963. Each of these three trades involved different species of whales as targets.

==== Northern whale fishery ====
From 1753 to 1837 whalers from Whitby were active in the Davis Strait. In 1832 the &quot;Phoenix&quot; was the only vessel to go out, returning with a record 234 tons of oil. The owners of the &quot;Phoenix&quot;, the Chapmans, therefore sent out two ships in 1833, the and the &quot;Phoenix&quot;. Both vessels returned with large volumes of oil, but the price of whale oil and whalebone had fallen. After unsuccessful voyages in 1837 both ships were withdrawn from whaling, ending whaling from Whitby.

==== Southern whale fishery ====
The Southern fishery was launched when Samuel Enderby, along with Alexander Champion and John St Barbe, using American vessels and crews, sent out twelve whaleships in 1776. In 1786, the Triumph was the first British whaler to be sent east of the Cape of Good Hope, and in 1788, the whaler &quot;Emilia&quot; was sent west around Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean to become the first ship of any nation to conduct whaling operations in the Southern Ocean. &quot;Emilia&quot; returned to London in 1790 with a cargo of 139 tons of whale oil. The first sperm whale killed in the Southern fishery was taken off the coast of Chile on 3 March 1789.

In 1784 the British had 15 whaleships in the southern fishery, all from London. Between 1793 and 1799 there was an average of 60 vessels in the trade, increasing to 72 in 1800–1809. The first sperm whale off the coast of New South Wales, Australia, was taken by the ship &quot;Britannia&quot; (Commander Thomas Melvill) in October 1791.

In 1819 the British whaler &quot;Syren&quot;, under Frederick Coffin of Nantucket, sailed to the coastal waters of Japan. She returned to London on 21 April 1822, with 346 tons of whale oil. By 1825 the British had 24 vessels there.

The number of vessels being fitted out annually for the southern fishery declined from 68 in 1820 to 31 in 1824. In 1825, there were 90 ships in the southern fishery, but by 1835 it had dwindled to 61 and by 1843 only 9 vessels left for the southern fishery. In 1859 the trade from London ended.

==== Antarctic whaling ====
The shore stations on the island of South Georgia were at the center of the Antarctic whaling industry from its beginnings in 1904 until the late 1920s when pelagic whaling increased. The activity on the island remained substantial until around 1960, when Norwegian–British Antarctic whaling came to an end.

=== France ===
In 1786, William Rotch, Sr. established a colony of Nantucket whalemen in Dunkirk. By 1789 Dunkirk had 14 whaling ships sailing to Brazil, Walvis Bay, and other areas of the South Atlantic to hunt sperm and right whales. In 1790 Rotch sent the first French whalers into the Pacific. The majority of the French whaling ships were lost during the Anglo-French War (1793-1802). Whaling began to revive after the war ended, but when Napoleon came to power Rotch&#x27;s holdings in Dunkirk were seized.

After the Napoleonic Wars the government issued subsidies in an attempt to revive whaling, and in 1832 this effort succeeded. In 1835 the first French whaleship, the Gange, reached the Gulf of Alaska and found abundant right whales. In 1836, the first French whaler reached New Zealand. In 1851, the French government passed a law to encourage whaling but this was not successful. Whaling in France ended in 1868.

=== Iceland ===

In 1883 the first whaling station was established in Alptafjordur, Iceland, by a Norwegian company. Between 1889 and 1903 nine more companies established themselves in Iceland. Catching peaked in 1902, when 1,305 whales were caught to produce 40,000 barrels of oil. Whale hunting had largely declined by 1910, when only 170 whales were caught.

A ban on whaling was imposed by the Althing in 1915. In 1935 an Icelandic company established a whaling station that shut down after only five seasons. In 1948, another Icelandic company, Hvalur H/F, purchased a naval base at the head of Hvalfjörður and converted it into a whaling station. Between 1948 and 1975, an average of 250 Fin, 65 Sei, and 78 sperm whales were taken annually, as well as a few blue and humpback whales. Unlike the majority of commercial whaling at the time, this operation was based on the sale of frozen meat and meat meal, rather than oil. Most of the meat was exported to England, while the meal was sold locally as cattle feed.

=== Scandinavia ===

There is strong evidence of active, large-scale whaling in Scandinavia from the 6th century onwards.

Scandinavia&#x27;s whaling industry invented many new techniques in the 19th century, with most inventions occurring in Norway. Jacob Nicolai Walsøe was probably the first person to suggest the idea of using a small steamboat with a gun mounted in the bows, while Arent Christian Dahl experimented with a combination of an explosive and a harpoon in a single projectile, in the Varanger Fjord (1857–1860). In 1863 Svend Foyn invented a harpoon with a flexible joint between the head and shaft and adapted Walsøe and Dahl&#x27;s ideas, initiating the modern whaling era.

Later, cannon-fired harpoons, strong cables, and steam winches were mounted on maneuverable, steam-powered catcher boats. They made possible the targeting of large and fast-swimming whale species that were taken to shore-based stations for processing. Breech-loading cannons were introduced in 1925; pistons were introduced in 1947 to reduce recoil. These highly efficient devices reduced whale populations to the point where large-scale commercial whaling became unsustainable.

==== Finnmark ====
In February 1864, Svend Foyn began his first whale-hunting trip to Finnmark in the schooner-rigged, steam-driven whale catcher &quot;Spes et Fides&quot; (Hope &amp; Faith). The ship had seven guns on her forecastle, each firing a harpoon and grenade separately. Several whales were seen, but only four were captured. After two unsuccessful trips in 1866 and 1867, he invented a harpoon gun that fired a grenade and harpoon at the same time and was able to catch thirty whales in 1868. He patented his grenade-tipped harpoon gun two years later.

Foyn was given a virtual monopoly on the trade in Finnmark in 1873, which lasted until 1882. Despite this, local citizens established a whaling company in 1876, and soon others defied his monopoly and formed companies. Unrestricted hunting began in 1883, triggering a large increase in the number of whale catchers. At the peak, in 1896–1898, between 1,000 and 1,200 whales were caught each year. The last station closed down in 1904.

==== Spitsbergen ====
In 1903, the wooden steamship Telegraf (737 gross tons) embarked on a whale catching trip to Spitsbergen. She returned with 1,960 barrels of oil produced from a catch of 57 whales, of which 42 were blue whales. By 1905, there were eight companies operating around Spitsbergen and Bear Island, and 559 whales (337 blue) were caught to produce 18,660 barrels. Operations were suspended in 1912.

=== Faroe Islands ===
Whaling stations in the Faroe Islands have included Gjánoyri on Streymoy (est. 1894), Norðdepil on Borðoy (1898–1920), Lopra on Suðuroy (1901–1953), Funningsfjørður on Eysturoy (est. 1901), and Við Áir (1905–1984) on Streymoy.

Peak catching was reached in 1909, when 773 whales were caught to produce 13,850 barrels of oil. In 1917, with the war and poor catches, whaling was suspended. The islanders&#x27; main interest in whaling was cheap meat, while 90% of the proceeds from the oil went abroad, mostly to Norway. Four Norwegian companies resumed catching in 1920 but quickly stopped. In 1933 the two remaining whaling stations in Lopra and Við Áir were taken over by Faroese owners. From 1977 to 1984 the whaling station Við Áir was owned and operated by the Faroese government.

The buildings and the equipment of Við Áir whaling station are still in existence. The Faroese Ministry of Culture (Mentamálaráðið) recommended conservation in 2007, suggesting that the whaling station be made into a maritime museum with activities for the visitors.

=== South Africa ===
== Twentieth century ==


By 1900, bowhead, gray, and right whales were nearly extinct, and whaling had declined. It revived with the invention of harpoons shot from cannons, explosive tips and factory ships, which allowed distant whaling. Whaling expanded in the northern hemisphere, then in the southern hemisphere. As each species was reduced to the point where it was hard to find, whalers moved on to the next species, catching blue whales, fin whales, sperm whales, sei whales and minke whales in sequence.

The League of Nations held a conference on whaling in 1927, and in 1931, 27 countries signed a convention for the regulation of whaling. The convention was not enforceable, and a record ~43,000 whales were caught in 1931. In 1932, whaling companies formed a cartel, which cut harvests for two years, but then failed. A 1937 convention agreed to shorter seasons and to sparing bowhead, gray and right whales, and whales under a minimum size. Ships killed faster to harvest as many as possible in the shorter season.

In 1946, 15 whaling nations formed the International Whaling Commission, with membership also open to non-whaling nations. It prohibited killing gray, humpback and right whales, limited hunting seasons, and set an Antarctic limit of 16,000 &quot;Blue Whale Units&quot; per year, but again had no enforcement ability. In 1949–1952 more than 2,000 humpbacks per year were harvested in the Antarctic, despite an annual quota of 1,250. In 1959–1964, there were disagreements over a moratorium on blue whales and humpbacks, with scientific advice eventually recommending a limit of 2,800 blue whale units. The IWC adopted quotas of 8,000. In 1970 the United States prohibited import of whale products by adding all commercial whales to its Endangered Species List.

Proposals for 10-year moratoria were rejected in 1971, 1972 and 1974, but species quotas were adopted and reduced. Consumer boycotts focused on Japanese and Russian products began in 1974, to protest the hunting of large whales by these countries. In 1978, the IWC called for an end to international trade in whale products. In 1982, the IWC adopted a ban on commercial whaling, to start in 1986. Japan, Norway and the USSR filed objections so the moratorium would not apply to them. Chile and Peru also filed objections, but Peru later agreed to be covered, and Chile stopped whaling.

No international quotas were ever put on beluga whales and narwhals; 1,000 to 2,000 of each have been killed each year to the present, mostly in Alaska, Canada and Greenland.

===Catches by country and year===
Sources: IWC Summary Catch Database version 6.1, July 2016, which includes great whales, orcas (mostly caught by Norway and USSR), bottlenose whales (mostly Norway), pilot whales (mostly Norway), and Baird&#x27;s Beaked Whales (mostly Japan). This database also has some pre-1900 counts, not shown here.

The IWC database is supplemented by Faroese catches of pilot whales, Greenland&#x27;s and Canada&#x27;s catches of Narwhals (data 1954–2014), Belugas from multiple sources shown in the Beluga whale article, Indonesia&#x27;s catches of sperm whales, bycatch in Japan 1980–2008, and bycatch in Korea 1996–2017. The IWC database includes illegal whaling from USSR and Korea. This is supplemented by academic findings on Korea for 1999–2003.

Note that most species of dolphins are omitted. Otherwise the main areas of missing data are: bycatch in countries other than Japan and Korea (generally much smaller), narwhals before 1954; belugas in Canada and USA before 1970, and in Nunavut (Canada) for all years; belugas in USSR in Bering, East Siberian and Laptev Seas and Sea of Okhotsk outside Amur River area.

<text>The Kosmos-3M ( meaning &quot;Cosmos&quot;, GRAU index 11K65M) was a Russian space launch vehicle, member of the Kosmos rocket family. It was a liquid-fueled two-stage launch vehicle, first launched in 1967 and with over 420 successful launches to its name.

The Kosmos-3M used UDMH fuel and AK27I oxidizer (red fuming nitric acid) to lift roughly of payload into orbit. It differed from the earlier Kosmos-3 in its finer control of the second-stage burn, allowing operators to tune the thrust and even channel it through nozzles that helped orient the rocket for the launching of multiple satellites at one time.

PO Polyot manufactured these launch vehicles in the Russian city of Omsk for decades. It was originally scheduled to be retired from service in 2011; however, in April 2010 the Commander of the Russian Space Forces confirmed that it would be retired by the end of 2010. One further launch, with Kanopus-ST, was planned; however, this was cancelled in late 2012 as the launch vehicle had exceeded its design life while in storage ahead of the launch.

== Launches ==

== Accidents ==
A total of 446 Kosmos 3Ms were launched from 1967 to 2010, with 22 failures. Some of the more noteworthy ones:

On 22 December 1970, a launch of a target vehicle for ASAT tests lost thrust at liftoff and fell back onto the pad at Plesetsk, exploding and badly damaging it.

On 26 June 1973, a Kosmos 3M exploded on the pad at Plesetsk during a propellant loading accident, killing nine people.

An attempted launch of an Intercosmos scientific satellite on 3 June 1975 failed 84 seconds into the launch when the first stage engine shut down.

An attempted launch of a military radar calibration satellite on 25 January 1983 suffered another first stage failure about 40 seconds into launch when the RD-219 started losing thrust. The onboard computer automatically shut the engine off and the launch vehicle fell into the Northern Dvina. Due to the tense relations between the U.S. and Soviet Union at this time, the U.S. military was widely suspected of having shot down the launch vehicle and General Secretary Yuri Andropov personally informed of this possibility. However, a group of locals ice fishing in the Dvina had witnessed the booster plunge into the river and reported what they&#x27;d seen to authorities. After this and a quick examination of telemetry, sabotage was ruled out. The failure was traced to high-frequency combustion instability, which had been a problem with the RD-219 engine and was also responsible for the 1970 and 1975 Kosmos 3M failures. The engine was redesigned and no further launches were lost due to first stage engine failures.

More recently, on 21 November 2000, a Kosmos 3M launcher failed to place the QuickBird 1 satellite into orbit due to a failure of its second stage. The launch vehicle and satellite reentered the atmosphere over Uruguay, and an inquest into the accident was inconclusive.

<text>In linguistic morphology a cranberry morpheme (also called unique morpheme or fossilized term) is a type of bound morpheme that cannot be assigned an &quot;independent&quot; meaning and grammatical function, but nonetheless serves to distinguish one word from another.

==Etymology==
The eponymous archetypal example is the &quot;cran&quot; of &quot;cranberry&quot;. Unrelated to the homonym &quot;&quot; with the meaning &quot;a case of herrings&quot;, this &quot;cran&quot; actually comes from &quot;crane&quot; (the bird), although the connection is not immediately evident. Similarly, &quot;mul&quot; (from Latin &quot;&quot;, the mulberry tree) exists only in &quot;mulberry&quot;. Phonetically, the first morpheme of &quot;raspberry&quot; also counts as a cranberry morpheme, even though the word &quot;rasp&quot; does occur by itself. Compare these with &quot;blackberry&quot;, which has two obvious unbound morphemes (&quot;black&quot; + &quot;berry&quot;), and to &quot;loganberry&quot; and &quot;boysenberry&quot;, both of which have first morphemes derived from surnames (James Harvey Logan and Rudolph Boysen, respectively).

==Examples==
Other cranberry morphemes in English include:

* &quot;cob&quot; in &quot;cobweb&quot;, from the obsolete word &quot;&quot; (&quot;spider&quot;).
* Many elements in English toponyms, such as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Reading&quot;, &quot;Dorking&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;) from an Old English term meaning &quot;the people of...&quot; or &quot;belonging to...&quot; (Note, however, that the &quot;&quot; at the end of words such as &quot;reading&quot;, the verb, is not a cranberry morpheme but rather an affixed morpheme.)
* &quot;dew&quot; in dewlap, assuming that the particle popularly associated with literal dew is folk etymology and not lost.

==Emergence==
Cranberry morphemes can arise in several ways:
* A dialectal word can become part of the standard language in a compound, but not in its root form: e.g. &quot;blatherskite&quot; (&quot;one who talks nonsense&quot;), as Scots has the word &quot;&quot; (&quot;contemptible person&quot;).
* A word can become obsolete in its root form but remain current in a compound: e.g. &quot;lukewarm&quot; from Middle English &quot;&quot; (&quot;tepid&quot;).
* A compound loanword may have a recognisable native cognate for one element but not the other: e.g. &quot;hinterland&quot; is from German &quot;&quot; (&quot;behind&quot;) + &quot;&quot; (&quot;land&quot;).
* A loanword may have one part misanalysed to a false cognate: e.g. a &quot;taffrail&quot; is a type of rail, but the word comes from Dutch &quot;&quot; (&quot;carved panel&quot;).

*Unpaired word – words like &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;

<text>The Latécoère 28 was a long distance monoplane aircraft designed and produced by the French aircraft manufacturer Latécoère.

First flown in 1927, it had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage and an enclosed cockpit for its crew of two. When configured for airline use, the Latécoère 28 could accommodate up to eight seated passengers. It was produced in both land and floatplane configurations, being marketed towards the civilian market both as a mail plane and passenger airliner.

During its operating life, the Latécoère 28 became the main-stay of Air France&#x27;s predecessor, Aéropostale, which heavily used the aircraft during the 1930s in its efforts to establish intercontinental air mail services and support French colonialism and French cultural influence during the Interwar period. Its pilots included famous poets and French men of letters, such as Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and Jean Mermoz, along with numerous veteran pilots from the First World War.

==Development==

The Latécoère 28 was a development of the Latécoère 26. A total of about fifty aircraft of several versions were produced between 1927 and 1932. The seaplane version, the Latécoère 28-3, was the first to make a postal delivery crossing of the South Atlantic when Jean Mermoz flew from Dakar to Natal in 21 hours and a half aboard the &quot;Comte-de-La Vaulx&quot; (prototype n° 919) on 12 May 1930. Unfortunately, the plane was lost at sea during the return flight (with no loss of life, nor of mail).

Early examples had been furnished with Renault 12Jbr engines; however, all use of this powerplant was quickly substituted for by Hispano Suiza 12, which waw capable of providing up to 500 hp (370 kW). The floatplane version was equipped with the Hispano Suiza 12Lbr, which could generate to up 650 hp (480 kW).

==Design==

The Latécoère 28 was a long-range high-wing single-engined monoplane. The fuselage, which was highly streamlined and largely supported by light-metal tubing, was internally divided into three sections, each with its own distinct structure and function. The main landing gear comprised two independent wheels mounted on axles joined to the fuselage and supported by elastic struts that incorporated shock absorbers. The recoil from landing was absorbed via a light-metal strut in the plane of the axle, supported at one end by the axle&#x27;s bend and hinged to the fuselage at the other end; atypically strong carbon-injected steel, which was hardened and tempered after machining, was used. A hinged elastic tail skid was also used to dampen the landing forces.

The forwardmost section of the aircraft was the bow, the double tubular framework of which constitutes the engine bed in the form of a girder cradle. Two struts are used to deliver power to the propeller, while various accessories of the engine, including the radiator, fire extinguishers, control lines, fuel piping, and oil tank. Maintenance access to the engine was achieved via a removable aluminium hood. Directly behind the engine was two spaces, the pilot&#x27;s room and the first baggage hold, the former being above the latter. The pilot&#x27;s room was provisioned with an ample windshield, and was well ventilated via two sliding overhead doors that was intended to be used for emergency egress if such a circumstance required it; typical access was via a pair of side doors. The chief pilot would be seated on the left, provisioned with an instrument board complete with electric light switches, while the position on the right was equipped with a radio set.

The majority of the central section was divided from the pilot&#x27;s room via two substantial bulkheads, between which were located the fuel tanks; these bulkheads were also the attachment points for both the wings and landing gear. Aft of the bulkhead was the passenger cabin, to the rear of which was the lavatory and a second baggage hold. Both the doors and windows had reinforced metal frames; a total of ten openable windows, along with washable fabric walls, a carpeted floor, ten baggage nets, and three ceiling 
lights for night flying were present in the passenger cabin. The rear section comprised a relatively simple arrangement of four girders that supported the tail unit; these were braced with piano wires and enclosed in a light wood cowling.
The wing of the Latécoère 28, which was furnished with a pair of ailerons and elliptical wingtips, was rigidly attached to the fuselage via a set of oblique struts. The structure comprised two spars composed of rectangular metal tubing, which was intentionally lightened via numerous holes and reinforced using riveted channel flanges; the distance between the spars was maintained by metal tubing braced by highly-resistant steel wiring. The ribs, which were triangularly-braced spruce girders with birch plywood gussets, determined the wing&#x27;s profile via their curvature. Reinforced box ribs gave the wing rigidity of the wing at key attachment points, such as with the fuselage and towards the ends of the ailerons; the wing was primarily attached to the fuselage via four bolts, two for each spar. Each of the ailerons, which had an all-metal framework, were fitted with a light-metal horn. As to achieve the desired profile of the elliptical wingtips, the adjacent ribs were reshaped. In anticipation of a potential wing strike, the wing&#x27;s design incorporated a damage control measure in the form of the spars terminating at two slightly weaker tip sections that would break off in the event of contact.

The vertical empennage of the tail was outfitted with a triangular fin and a balanced semi-circular rudder. The fin was supported at either end by a cross piece attached to the upper longerons of the fuselage and was braced via four wires running to the triangular horizontal stabilizer. The structure of the tail largely comprised light-metal tubular members and stamped ribs, the majority of which was joined using rivets. The exterior was mainly covered by fabric. Both the rudder and the elevator were balanced. The aircraft&#x27;s flight controls comprised a rudder bar, a wheel for the ailerons and a control stick for the elevator.

==Operational service==
The first aircraft were used by Aéropostale on the African mail routes connecting Casablanca and Dakar. The aircraft also inaugurated a Paris-Madrid service.
The Latécoère 28 became famous in South America because of the regular mail service it performed between France and Argentina, amongst other destinations. This aircraft&#x27;s introduction made it possible to send a letter from Paris to Santiago de Chile in what seemed then like an astonishingly short four days. Previously, the mail steamships had taken weeks or months.

The Latécoère 28 was also operated in a military capacity. Venezuela purchased three aircraft for use as bombers while the French government supplied several to the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War.

<text>Oud-Vossemeer (Zeelandic: &quot;Ou-Vossemaer&quot;) is a village on the island of Tholen in the Dutch province of Zeeland. It is a part of the municipality of Tholen, and lies about 13 km northwest of Bergen op Zoom, close to the Eendracht, part of the Scheldt-Rhine Canal.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1410 as Vosmer, and means &quot;old fresh water stream&quot;. Oud (old) has been added to distinguish from Nieuw-Vossemeer. Oud-Vossemeer is a circular church village which developed after the Kerkepolder was &quot;poldered&quot; in 1411. Up to the 16th century, it formed a &quot;heerlijkheid&quot; with Nieuw-Vossemeer. In 1576, it was burnt by the Dutch States Army.

The tower of the Dutch Reformed church dates from 1450. The church was heavily damaged by the 1576 fire. It was rebuilt in 1595, and the tower was placed inside the church. The church was extensively modified between 1913 and 1915. The Catholic St Willibrordus Church is an aisleless church with wooden tower from 1841. The interior was modified in 1928.

The former forge dates from 1786. The façade contains a &quot;smith&#x27;s clock&quot; from 1805 with carved wooden figures, and has a wooden ringer with a brass bell. Above the clock is tunnel with cavalry figures. The clock was restored in 1960. Since 2015, the Roosevelt Information centre is housed in the forge.

Oud-Vossemeer was home to 1,364 people in 1840. It includes the previous municipality and hamlet of Vrijberge. In 1944, Oud-Vossemeer and the surrounding country side was inundated by the Germans. Oud-Vossemeer was a separate municipality until 1971, when it was merged with Tholen.

== Notable people ==
The ancestors of the American presidential family Roosevelt may have lived in Oud-Vossemeer. A monument honouring the Four Freedoms (formulated by Franklin Delano Roosevelt) was placed in the centre of the village.

<text>Sir Angus McMillan Tait (22 July 1919 – 7 August 2007) was a New Zealand electronics innovator and businessman.

Tait had a childhood fascination for electronics and during and after high school at Waitaki Boys&#x27; High School, he worked in a friend&#x27;s (Kempton Collett) radio store. He served with the Royal New Zealand Air Force and also the Royal Air Force instructing as a second lieutenant on radar in Britain, during World War II.

After the war, he designed and built mobile radio equipment, although his first company went into receivership. In 1969, he founded Tait Electronics Ltd, now operating as Tait Radio Communications, Christchurch (New Zealand), with men who had decided to remain loyal and see him through; now his company is considered a world leader in mobile radio. He had persisted in keeping his manufacturing base in New Zealand, with 95 per cent of production exported to 160 countries.

In the 1992 New Year Honours, Tait was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to manufacturing and export. In 1996, he was inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame. He was awarded the IEEE Ernst Weber Engineering Leadership Recognition in 1998. In the 1999 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to technology, manufacturing and export. In 2003 he was the Inaugural New Zealand High Tech Award Winner. Presently, Tait&#x27;s company employs in excess of 850 people. In March 2009, Tait was commemorated as one of the Twelve Local Heroes, and a bronze bust of him was unveiled outside the Christchurch Arts Centre.

He died in 2007, at the age of 88.

<text>Selwyn Featherston Toogood (4 April 1916 – 27 February 2001) was a New Zealand radio and television personality.

==Early life and family==
Born in Wellington on 4 April 1916, Toogood was the son of Henry Featherston Toogood and Ethel Lois Copus &quot;Noonie&quot; Toogood (née Butler). Through his mother, Toogood was the great-grandson of John Howell, who established a whaling station at Riverton, and his second wife, Caroline Brown, whose mother was Māori from the Ngāi Tahu iwi. Toogood did not learn of his Māori ancestry until he was 18 years old.

Toogood was educated at Wellesley College and Wellington College, where he had an inauspicious career, apart from excelling in the dramatic arts.

On 30 June 1948, Toogood married Cynthia Holden Webb at St Peter&#x27;s church, in Willis Street, Wellington. Cynthia&#x27;s brother was Sir Richard Webb, who served as the New Zealand Chief of Defence Staff between 1971 and 1976. The Toogoods went on to have two sons, including Kit Toogood, who was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1999 and a High Court judge in 2011.

==Military service==
Toogood joined the army following the outbreak of World War II. As an ammunition officer, he saw active service in Greece, North Africa and Italy, rising to the rank of major. He was mentioned in dispatches in 1944, in recognition of gallant and distinguished service in Italy.

In 1953, Toogood was awarded the Efficiency Decoration.

==Acting and broadcasting career==
After leaving school, Toogood became involved in theatre and radio, including a role in New Zealand&#x27;s first radio soap opera. On a troopship on the way home from World War II, he ran his first quiz show. After the war, Toogood picked up where he had left off as a stage actor, voice-over artist and radio announcer.
He began his career as a radio host in 1946 and was the originator of the game show &quot;It&#x27;s in the Bag&quot;, in which he popularised the catch-phrases, &quot;By hokey&quot;, and &quot;What will it be, customers - the money or the bag?&quot;, in New Zealand. &quot;It&#x27;s in the Bag&quot; eventually moved on to network television, where it was equally successful. He published his autobiography &quot;Out Of The Bag&quot; in 1979. Toogood hosted numerous other TV shows for the Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand and Television New Zealand, including the panel show &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and the children&#x27;s quiz show &quot;W3&quot;. He retired from &quot;It&#x27;s in the Bag&quot; in the 1980s, handing over the mantle to radio and TV host John Hawkesby.

In the 1977 New Year Honours, Toogood was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for community services. Toogood was awarded a special lifetime achievement award by the New Zealand Academy of Film and Television Arts in New Zealand in 1999.

==Death==
Toogood died in Auckland in 2001, and his ashes were buried in Karori Cemetery. Cynthia Toogood died in 2005.

<doc id="897454" wikidata="Q2905361" url="?curid=897454" title="Jabesh-Gilead">
<text>Jabesh-Gilead ( &quot;Yāḇēš Gilʿāḏ&quot;), sometimes shortened to Jabesh, was an ancient Israelite town in Gilead, in northwest Jordan. Jabesh is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible primarily in connection with King Saul&#x27;s battles against the Ammonites and Philistines.

jabesh Gilead means Jabesh of Gilead or Jabesh in Gilead, i.e. the town Jabesh in the region of Gilead, as opposed to other towns called Jabesh in other parts of the country. 

Jabesh means &quot;dry&quot; in Hebrew, a name possibly attributed to the site&#x27;s well-draining soil. Gilead means &#x27;heap [of stones] of testimony&#x27;. There is also an alternative theory that it means &#x27;rocky region&#x27;. [Smith&#x27;s Bible Dictionary, &quot;Gil&#x27;e-ad&quot;].

==History==

=== In the Hebrew Bible ===
Jabesh-Gilead is mentioned in the Book of Judges, 
in the first and second Books of Samuel, and in the Book of Chronicles.

==== Benjaminite War ====

Jabesh is mentioned in the biblical episode of the Levite&#x27;s concubine, also known as the Benjamite War, during which eleven tribes of Israel had massacred the Tribe of Benjamin. The eleven tribes relented from wiping out the whole tribe, and decided that they needed to find wives for the 600 remaining Benjaminite men since all other people in Benjamin had been killed. However, they had taken an oath not to give their daughters to a Benjaminite, so they found the one city in Israel that had not joined the fight: Jabesh. The city&#x27;s inhabitants were executed under the Herem except for 400 virgins. They brought back 400 virgins from Jabesh and gave them to the men on Rimmon Rock ().

==== Nahash of Ammon ====
Jabesh-Gilead is a central setting of . After Saul is anointed by Samuel, Nahash of Ammon attacks Jabesh-Gilead. Having subjected the town to a siege, its inhabitants sought terms for surrender, but were told by Nahash that they had a choice of death by sword or having their right eyes gouged out. The population obtained seven days&#x27; grace from Nahash, during which they would be allowed to seek help from the Israelites, after which they would have to submit to the terms of surrender. The town&#x27;s inhabitants sought help from the people of Israel, sending messengers throughout the whole territory, and Saul responded by raising an army which decisively defeated Nahash and his cohorts at Bezek. After the war is over, the Israelites assemble at Gilgal to renew Saul&#x27;s kingship over Israel.

==== Saul&#x27;s Death ====

After Saul falls on his sword during the Battle of Gilboa, the victorious Philistines recover his body as well as those of his three sons who also died in the battle, decapitate them and display them on the wall of Beit She&#x27;an. At night, the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead retrieve the bodies, showing their devotion to the rescuer of the city. Following a funeral pyre, the bones of Saul and his sons were buried under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh (, ). When David learns it was the men of Jabesh-Gilead who had brought Saul to a honorable burial, he sent messengers to bless them (). Later, David takes the bones of Saul and of his son Jonathan from Jabesh and buries them in Zela, in the tomb of Saul&#x27;s father ().

==== House of Shallum ====
In the Books of Kings (, ) Shallum of Israel&#x27;s father is identified as Jabesh. However, the passage may instead mention a toponym, identifying that Shallum was &quot;the son&quot; of a city called Jabesh. In this view, Shallum may have originated from Jabesh-Gilead.

=== Later years ===
In his &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (c. 93–94 CE), Josephus describes Jabesh Gilead as a metropolis in the Transjordan. In the early-4th century CE, Greek scholar Eusebius mentioned &quot;Iabeis Galaad&quot; in his &quot;Onomasticon&quot; as a &quot;village beyond the Jordan located on the mountains six miles from the city of Pella on the road to Gerasa.&quot;

==Identification==

The exact location of Jabesh-Gilead is debated. Most scholars identify it with Tell el-Maqlub, but Tell Abu al-Kharaz is also frequently suggested. Both sites were inhabited during the Iron Age and lie along Wadi al-Yabis, a stream believed to preserve the town&#x27;s ancient name.

<doc id="897456" wikidata="Q1655613" url="?curid=897456" title="Ian Mune">
<text>Sir Ian Barry Mune (born 1941) is a New Zealand character actor, director, and screenwriter. His screen acting career spans four decades and more than 50 roles. His work as a film director includes hit comedy &quot;Came a Hot Friday&quot;, an adaptation of classic New Zealand play &quot;The End of the Golden Weather&quot;, and &quot;What Becomes of the Broken Hearted?&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Mune was born in Auckland, and educated at Wesley College in the same city. He was married to the writer Josie Mune until her death in 2015.

==Acting==
Mune acted on stage while training to be a teacher in Wellington. After time acting in the UK, he returned to his native New Zealand and won a Feltex award in 1975 after starring in one-off television drama &quot;Derek&quot;. Another award followed for playing Leo Moynihan, the secretary of a trade union in television series &quot;Moynihan&quot;. In 1987 he appeared in the TVNZ documentary mini-series &quot;&quot; for which he won the award for Best Male in a Dramatic Role.

In 1994, Mune won another New Zealand television award after playing Prime Minister Sir Robert Muldoon in television mini-series &quot;Fallout&quot;, which depicted the end of the Muldoon-led National Government.

Mune featured in a documentary about the making of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; called &quot;In The Shadow of King Lear&quot; by New Zealand company Theatre at Large giving insight into his acting process.

He has gone on to appear in a range of New Zealand feature films, including &quot;A Song of Good&quot;, &quot;Savage Honeymoon&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Not Harry Jenson&quot;. He played Winston Churchill in American telemovie &quot;&quot;, and Buster Keaton in &quot;&quot;.

Mune was a support role in the Australian drama &quot;Wanted&quot;, opposite Rebecca Gibney and Robyn Malcolm that premiered in 2016.

In 2024, he appeared in &quot;The Rule of Jenny Pen&quot;.

==Directing and writing==
Mune took multiple creative roles on 1976 anthology series &quot;Winners and Losers&quot;, which saw him collaborating with director Roger Donaldson. The two first collaborated on &quot;Derek&quot;; Mune directed and wrote some episodes of the new series, and acted in others. Having helped script Donaldson&#x27;s first feature film, dystopian thriller &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;, Mune also appeared on-screen alongside its star, Sam Neill.

Mune&#x27;s other writing credits include adapting classic Ian Cross novel &quot;The God Boy&quot; into a well-regarded telemovie, the movie version of children&#x27;s fable &quot;The Silent One&quot;, and co-writing &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie&quot;, the first New Zealand feature to win large audiences in its home country.

In 1985 he made his feature debut as a director with hit comedy &quot;Came a Hot Friday&quot;. Based around the escapades of two smalltown conmen in 50s era New Zealand, the film is based on the novel by Ronald Hugh Morrieson.

Mune won further acclaim in 1991 for directing &#x27;coming of age&#x27; drama &quot;The End of the Golden Weather&quot;, an adaptation of parts of Bruce Mason&#x27;s classic one-man play. Mune spent a number of years developing this passion project and seeking finance, working with Mason on the project before Mason died.

&quot;What Becomes of the Broken Hearted?&quot; won nine of its 13 New Zealand Film Award nominations in 1999. The film is the sequel to hard-edged drama &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot;, which became New Zealand&#x27;s most successful feature film soon after release. It remains Mune&#x27;s biggest commercial success to date.

Mune&#x27;s other directorial projects include a feature-length documentary on comedian (and &quot;Came a Hot Friday&quot; actor) Billy T James, teenage drama &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot;, and UVF thriller &quot;The Grasscutter&quot;. For television, he directed episodes of comedy series &quot;Letter to Blanchy&quot; and anthology series &quot;The Ray Bradbury Theater&quot;. He was one of a large team of second unit directors on Peter Jackson&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and played a small cameo in the first film.

In 2008 Mune directed depression-era telefeature movie &quot;Life&#x27;s A Riot&quot;. Mune also had a cameo role as a judge, after the actor cast in the role did not show up.

&quot;Mune: An Autobiography&quot; was published in 2010.

<doc id="897457" wikidata="Q1362711" url="?curid=897457" title="Sweeper">
<text>Sweepers are small, tropical marine (occasionally brackish) ray-finned fish of the family Pempheridae. Found in the western Atlantic Ocean and Indo-Pacific region, the family contains about 26 species in two genera. One species (&quot;Pempheris xanthoptera&quot;) is the target of subsistence fisheries in Japan, where the fish is much enjoyed for its taste. Sweepers are occasionally kept in marine aquaria.

== Description ==
Deeply keeled, compressed bodies and large eyes typify sweepers, their form somewhat like hatchetfish; both cycloid and ctenoid scales may be present. The small, short dorsal fin begins before the body&#x27;s midpoint and may have four to seven spines; the anal fin is extensive and usually has three spines. The mouth is subterminal and strongly oblique. Species of the genus &quot;Parapriacanthus&quot; have much more cylindrical bodies.

Some species possess photophores. All but the curved sweeper (&quot;Pempheris poeyi&quot;) possess a gas bladder. The largest species is the common bullseye (&quot;Pempheris multiradiata&quot;) at long; most other species measure or less. Colouration is relatively subdued.

== Behaviour ==
Characteristically shallow water, schooling fish (especially as juveniles), sweepers are nocturnal and seek shelter under ledges or in the caves, nooks, and crannies of reefs or eroded, rocky shorelines during the day. They are often found sharing these hiding places with cardinalfishes and bigeyes, also nocturnal species. At night, sweepers forage for zooplankton, their primary food.

At least one species, the small-scale bullseye (&quot;Pempheris compressa&quot;) of Australia, is known to enter coastal estuaries whilst young.

==Genera==
The following genera are classified within the family Pempheridae:

* &quot;Parapriacanthus&quot; 
* &quot;Pempheris&quot;

<text>Medieval Hebrew was a literary and liturgical language that existed between the 4th and 19th century. It was not commonly used as a spoken language, but mainly in written form by rabbis, scholars and poets. Medieval Hebrew had many features distinguishing it from older forms of Hebrew. These affected grammar, syntax, sentence structure, and also included a wide variety of new lexical items, which were either based on older forms or borrowed from other languages, especially Aramaic, Koine Greek and Latin.

==History==
In the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain, important work was done by grammarians in explaining the grammar and vocabulary of Biblical Hebrew; much of this was based on the work of the grammarians of Classical Arabic. Important Hebrew grammarians were Judah ben David Hayyuj and Jonah ibn Janah. A great deal of poetry was written, by poets such as Dunash ben Labrat, Solomon ibn Gabirol, Judah Halevi, David Hakohen Abraham ibn Ezra and Moses ibn Ezra, in a &quot;purified&quot; Hebrew based on the work of these grammarians, and in Arabic quantitative metres (see piyyut). This literary Hebrew was later used by Italian Jewish poets.
The need to express scientific and philosophical concepts from Ancient Greek and medieval Arabic motivated Medieval Hebrew to borrow terminology and grammar from these other languages, or to coin equivalent terms from existing Hebrew roots, giving rise to a distinct style of philosophical Hebrew. Many have direct parallels in medieval Arabic. The ibn Tibbon family, and especially Samuel ibn Tibbon, were personally responsible for the creation of much of this form of Hebrew, which they employed in their translations of scientific materials from the Arabic. At that time, original Jewish philosophical and theological works produced in Spain were usually written in Arabic, but as time went on, this form of Hebrew was used for many original compositions as well.

Another important influence was Maimonides, who developed a simple style based on Mishnaic Hebrew for use in his law code, the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;. Subsequent rabbinic literature is written in a blend between this style and the Aramaicized Mishnaic Hebrew of the Talmud.

By late 12th and early 13th centuries the cultural center of Mediterranean Jewry was transferred from an Islamic context to Christian lands. The written Hebrew used in Northern Spain, Hachmei Provence (a term for all of Occitania) and Italy was increasingly influenced by Latin, particularly in philosophical writings, and also by different vernaculars (Provençal, Italian, French etc.). In Italy we witness the flourishing of a new genre, Italian-Hebrew philosophical lexicons. The Italian of these lexicons was generally written in Hebrew characters and are a useful source for the knowledge of Scholastic philosophy among Jews. One of the earliest lexicons was that by Moses b. Shlomo of Salerno, who died in the late 13th. century; it was meant to clarify terms that appear in his commentary on Maimonides&#x27; &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot;. Moses of Salerno&#x27;s glossary was edited by Giuseppe Sermoneta in 1969. There are also glossaries associated with Jewish savants who befriended Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. Moses of Salerno&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Guide&quot; also contains Italian translations of technical terms, which brings the Guide&#x27;s Islamic-influenced philosophical system into confrontation with 13th-century Italian scholasticism.

Hebrew was also used as a language of communication among Jews from different countries, particularly for the purpose of international trade.

Mention should also be made of the letters preserved in the Cairo Geniza, which reflect the Arabic-influenced Hebrew of medieval Egyptian Jewry. The Arabic terms and syntax that appear in the letters constitute a significant source for the documentation of spoken medieval Arabic, since Jews in Islamic lands tended to use colloquial Arabic in writing rather than classical Arabic, which is the Arabic that appears in Arabic medieval sources.

<doc id="897460" wikidata="Q3454119" url="?curid=897460" title="Rzip">
<text>rzip is a huge-scale data compression computer program designed around initial LZ77-style string matching on a 900 MB dictionary window, followed by bzip2-based Burrows–Wheeler transform and entropy coding (Huffman) on 900 kB output chunks.

== Compression algorithm ==
rzip operates in two stages. The first stage finds and encodes large chunks of duplicated data over potentially very long distances (900 MB) in the input file. The second stage uses a standard compression algorithm (bzip2) to compress the output of the first stage.

It is quite common these days to need to compress files that contain long distance redundancies. For example, when compressing a set of home directories several users might have copies of the same file, or of quite similar files. It is also common to have a single file that contains large duplicated chunks over long distances, such as PDF files containing repeated copies of the same image. Most compression programs won&#x27;t be able to take advantage of this redundancy, and thus might achieve a much lower compression ratio than rzip can achieve.

The intermediate interface between the two stages is made of a byte-aligned data stream of which there are two commands, a &quot;literal&quot; (&quot;add&quot;) with length and data:

 type:8 = 0 =&gt; literal/add range of count bytes
 count:16 = 1..65535
 data:8..∞ = literal data to be inserted (n whole bytes)

and a &quot;match&quot; (&quot;copy&quot;) with length and offset parameters:

 type:8 = 1 =&gt; match/copy range of count bytes
 count:16 = 31..65535
 offset:32 = offset to position to be copied from

Literal or match/copy lengths of greater than 65,535 bytes are split into multiple instructions. End-of-stream is indicated with a zero-length literal/add (type=0,count=0) command and immediately followed by a 32-bit CRC checksum.

== Reference implementation ==
A rolling-checksum algorithm based on the one in rsync is used to locate potential matches from over such a large dataset. As the hash buckets fill up, previous hashes (&quot;tags&quot;) are discarded based on twice. The tags are discarded in such a manner as to provide &quot;fairly good&quot; coverage, with a gradually decreasing match granularity as the distance increases. This implementation does not search for match lengths of fewer than 31 consecutive bytes.

== Advantages ==
The key difference between rzip and other well known compression algorithms is its ability to take advantage of very long distance redundancy. The well known deflate algorithm used in gzip uses a maximum history buffer of 32 KiB. The Burrows–Wheeler transform block sorting algorithm used in bzip2 is limited to 900 KiB of history. The history buffer in rzip can be up to 900 MiB long, several orders of magnitude larger than gzip or bzip2. Rzip is often much faster than bzip2, despite using the bzip2 library as a back end. This is because rzip feeds bzip2 with shrunken data, so that bzip2 has to do less work. Simple comparisons (although too small for it to be an authoritative benchmark) have been produced.

== Disadvantages ==
rzip is not suited for every purpose. The two biggest disadvantages of rzip are that it cannot be pipelined (so it cannot read from standard input or write to standard output), and that it uses a high amount of memory: a typical compression run on a large file might use hundreds of megabytes of RAM. If there is a lot of RAM to spare and a very high compression ratio is required, rzip should be used, but if these conditions are not satisfied, alternate compression methods such as gzip and bzip2, which are less memory-intensive, should be used instead of rzip.
There is at least one patch to enable pipelining.

== History ==
rzip was originally written by Andrew Tridgell as part of his PhD research.

== Alternative implementations ==

=== lrzip ===
lrzip (Long Range ZIP) is an improved version of rzip. Its file format (codice_1) is incompatible with rzip&#x27;s. It has the following improvements:
* Choice of LZMA, LZO, DEFLATE, Bzip2, and ZPAQ compression (as opposed to Bzip2 only)
* No dictionary limit, not even limited by available RAM
* Ability to test data for compressibility before compressing, preventing the computer from wasting time by trying to compress incompressible data
* Ability to be pipelined from standard input / standard output (with a loss in compression ratio)
* Ability to disable last-stage compression for use with another compressor
* Optional AES-128 encryption

The lrzip distribution comes with a pair of programs to use it with tar, codice_2 and codice_3.

=== rzip64 ===
rzip64 is an extension of rzip for very large files that can utilize multiple CPU cores in parallel. There are benchmark results. Most important, however, is the ability of rzip64 to be interrupted at any time. Thereby a running compression task (that may easily take several hours for large files) survives even a system maintenance reboot without losing already completed work and can be resumed later. The file format of rzip64 is identical to the original rzip.

=== REP ===
REP is an alternative implementation of rzip algorithm by Bulat Ziganshin used in his FreeArc archiver as preprocessor for LZMA/Tornado compression algorithms. In FreeArc, REP finds large-distance matches and then LZMA compress the remaining data. For example, on computer with 2 GB RAM, REP finds matches that is at least 512 bytes long at the distances up to 1 GB, and then LZMA finds any remaining matches at the distances up to 128 MB. So, working together, they provide the best compression possible on 2 GB RAM budget.

Being optimized for stream decompression and collaborative work with LZMA, REP has some differences from the original RZIP implementation. First, by default it finds only matches that are 512+ byte long, since benchmarking proved that this is optimal setting for overall REP+LZMA compression. Second, it uses a sliding dictionary that&#x27;s about 1/2 RAM long, so decompression doesn&#x27;t need to reread data from decompressed file. REP&#x27;s advantage is its multiplicative rolling hash that is both quick to compute and has near-ideal distribution.

Larger minimal match length (512 bytes compared to 32 bytes in rzip) allowed for additional speed optimizations, so that REP provides very fast compression (about 200 MB/s on Intel i3-2100).

=== SREP ===
SREP (SuperREP) is an implementation of Tridgell&#x27;s idea of LZ compressor that doesn&#x27;t store its dictionary in RAM, using instead SHA1 hashes of processed blocks to compare their contents. It allows the program to compress files that are about 10x larger than RAM available. Decompression performed either by reading data from decompressed part of file, or by storing in the memory future matches (future-LZ compression algorithm). Of course, future-LZ compression requires 2 passes over input file but decompression needs tiny memory. In one experiment, 22 GB file compressed with minimum match length of 512 bytes and full 22 GB dictionary required just 2 GB of RAM for decompression.

<doc id="897466" wikidata="Q6226240" url="?curid=897466" title="John Clarke (satirist)">
<text>John Morrison Clarke (29 July 1948 – 9 April 2017) was a New Zealand comedian, writer and satirist who lived and worked in Australia from the late 1970s. He was a highly regarded actor and writer whose work appeared on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in both radio and television and also in print. He is principally known for his character Fred Dagg and his long-running collaboration with fellow satirist Bryan Dawe, which lasted from 1989 to his death in 2017, as well as for his success as a comic actor in Australian and New Zealand film and television.

==Early life and career==
Clarke was born on 29 July 1948 in Palmerston North, New Zealand, the son of Ted Clarke and Neva Clarke-McKenna. He moved to Wellington and attended Scots College before studying at Victoria University of Wellington between 1967 and 1970.

Clarke first became known during the mid to late 1970s for portraying a laconic farmer called Fred Dagg on stage, film and television. Gumboot and singlet-clad, Dagg had seven sons all named &quot;Trev&quot;. Clarke also recorded a series of records and cassettes and published several books as Dagg. Over forty years after its release, the first Fred Dagg album, &quot;Fred Dagg&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; (1976), remains one of New Zealand&#x27;s biggest selling records. Some of his earliest appearances as Fred Dagg in the Australian media were on the ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Science Show&quot; and Dagg later made regular radio appearances on 2JJ until the station moved to FM and was renamed 2JJJ in 1980. An LP of some 2JJ sketches, &quot;The Fred Dagg Tapes&quot;, was released in 1979. He relocated to Australia in 1977.

In 1984 Clarke was part of the Australian ABC TV series &quot;The Gillies Report&quot;, starring Max Gillies. Among the highlights of this satire were Clarke&#x27;s straight-faced reports on the fictional sport of &quot;farnarkeling&quot; and the exploits of Australia&#x27;s farnarkeling champion, Dave Sorenson.

In 1998, together with others, Clarke developed the TV series &quot;The Games,&quot; a satirical series depicting the preparations for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games&quot;.&quot;

== Films ==
In 1972, he made his first film appearance in &quot;The Adventures of Barry McKenzie&quot;, a film about an expatriate Australian in London. Although Clarke was only an extra, the film&#x27;s makers, Bruce Beresford and Barry Humphries, instantly recognised his talent; &quot;he was terribly funny and terribly real&quot;. In 1974 he wrote and appeared (as Ken) in &quot;Buck House&quot;, a New Zealand comedy TV series set in a student flat.

In 1982, he was nominated for an AFI award for co-writing the acclaimed Paul Cox film &quot;Lonely Hearts&quot;. He also co-wrote the mini-series &quot;Anzacs&quot; and provided the voice of Wal Footrot in the feature-length animated film, &quot;Footrot Flats: The Dog&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1986), based on the comic strips by Murray Ball. Towards the end of the 1980s, he featured in a number of other films, and began to be known for his political satire.

During the 1980s and early 1990s, Clarke featured in several films, including &quot;Never Say Die&quot;, alongside New Zealand actor Temuera Morrison, &quot;Death in Brunswick&quot;, alongside another New Zealand actor, Sam Neill, and &quot;Blood Oath&quot; (released in some countries as &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;).

== Mock interviews ==

In 1987 or 1989 Clarke and collaborator Bryan Dawe introduced weekly satirical mock interviews to television, and these short pieces became a regular and popular segment of the Nine Network current affairs programme &quot;A Current Affair&quot;. These are described by Robert Phiddian &amp; Jessica Milner as John Clarke&#x27;s &quot;most sustained comic attack on public mendacity.&quot;

Each segment addressed a topical issue, with Dawe acting as the interviewer, while Clarke assumed the persona of a politician or other figure, who typically tries to avoid directly answering any of Dawe&#x27;s questions. Unusually for the genre, Clarke never attempted to directly mimic the voice, manner or appearance of his subject. This feature set the segments apart from the typical approach to this form of satire, including Clarke&#x27;s earlier series &quot;The Gillies Report&quot; (1985–86).

The pair continued to do mock interviews for &quot;A Current Affair&quot; until 1997, satirising a range of figures including Paul Keating, Alexander Downer, George Bush, and Alan Bond. After a break, the pair reappeared on ABC TV&#x27;s &quot;The 7.30 Report&quot; in a similar format. In 2013 the mock interviews became an eponymous program, &quot;Clarke and Dawe&quot;, which screened on ABC TV. The interviews were broadcast weekly on ABCTV and were made available online on both the ABC and on YouTube and for retail sale. This format of mock interviews was continued by John Bird and John Fortune on the British TV show &quot;Bremner, Bird and Fortune&quot; from 1999 onwards.

The interviews have been compiled into books and CD releases. &quot;Great Interviews of the Twentieth Century&quot; won the ARIA Award for Best Australian Comedy Album in 1991. &quot;The Annual Report&quot; won the same award in 1992 and &quot;Secret Men&#x27;s Business&quot; was nominated in 1997.

== Later career ==
Clarke had a commercial success in 1998, when he co-wrote (with Ross Stevenson) and starred (with Dawe and Gina Riley) in &quot;The Games&quot;, a mockumentary about the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG). In 2001, Billy Connolly starred in a film based on Clarke&#x27;s screenplay &quot;The Man Who Sued God&quot; (re-written by Don Watson). In 2002 Clarke appeared in a villainous role in the movie &quot;Crackerjack&quot; and as a comedy club owner in the award-winning telemovie &quot;Roy Hollsdotter Live&quot;. After a quiet period, he re-emerged in 2004, adapting Melbourne author Shane Maloney&#x27;s &quot;Murray Whelan&quot; series for film. This resulted in two films, &quot;Stiff&quot; and &quot;The Brush-Off&quot;, both starring David Wenham and Mick Molloy. Clarke directed &quot;Stiff&quot; himself and made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Brush-Off&quot;, which was directed by his old friend Sam Neill.

Clarke was the author of several books, notably two mock compilations of Australian poetry, and &quot;The Tournament&quot;, a book describing a fictional tennis tournament involving many philosophical and literary figures of the twentieth century.

During the 1980s, Clarke was an influential Board member of Film Victoria.

In 2004 he was the recipient of the Byron Kennedy Award, &quot;for his works of sustained excellence and for the inspiration he presents to all of us in his roles as poet, playwright, actor, author, director and producer.&quot;

Clarke was patron of the Australian Poetry Centre, launched in June 2007, one of the forerunners of the national peak body for poets, Australian Poetry.

He was inducted into the Logies Hall of Fame in 2008. The Logie was presented to him by long-time collaborator and friend Bryan Dawe. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2017 his posthumous album, &quot;Clarke&#x27;s Classics&quot;, won the award for Best Comedy Release in October of that year.

== Death and legacy ==
On 9 April 2017, Clarke died of a heart attack while on a bushwalk up Mount Abrupt in the Grampians National Park, Victoria. Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, leader of the opposition Bill Shorten, and New Zealand prime minister Bill English paid tribute to his role as a political satirist; Turnbull saying that &quot;His satire served a noble purpose. It spoke truth to power. It made our democracy richer and stronger. It kept politicians on their toes.&quot;

Long-time collaborator Bryan Dawe said in an interview with &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;He&#x27;d never forget what was going on in your life&quot;, and paid tribute to their partnership; &quot;The trick with John was he had these sparkling eyes. He was a mischief maker and his eyes went looking for mischief. You could see it and it would set you off. Neither of us could look at each other when we were doing the show.&quot; He added, &quot;It was always about the audience. And now he&#x27;s gone.&quot; Episodes of &quot;Clarke &amp; Dawe&quot; were re-released online and interviews with the pair were repeated on ABC Radio in the wake of Clarke&#x27;s death.

Clarke&#x27;s work was presented on ABC radio and television over a period of nearly 30 years. In tribute to him and his work, the ABC repeated many pieces after his death, including his guest presentation for ABC Classic FM from October 2016 and the three-part documentary &quot;Sporting Nation&quot;, repeated on ABC television. ABC television also screened a program containing tributes from Dawe and other friends, politicians, colleagues and comedians entitled &quot;John Clarke: Thanks for Your Time&quot;. Comedian and fellow New Zealander Tony Martin delivered a tribute to Clarke at the 2017 Logie Awards.

Clarke and his works are the subject of an academic study in the journal &quot;Comedy Studies&quot;. The study was written and compiled by New Zealand film producer and writer Paul Horan in collaboration with film researcher and archivist Mark Hutchings.

The Fred Award, named after Clarke&#x27;s character Fred Dagg, is the top award at the New Zealand International Comedy Festival and has been presented since 2006.

His daughter Lorin Clarke published the memoir &quot;Would that be funny?&quot; in 2023.

The Victorian Premier&#x27;s Literary Awards added a category in 2024 named the John Clarke Prize for Humour Writing for works of fiction, nonfiction and poetry.

Morrison voiced Boba Fett in the 2004 re-release of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, various &quot;Star Wars&quot; video games, and portrayed Boba fully in the second season of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; (2019–present) and the spin-off show &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot; (2021–2022). In 2022, he had a recurring role in the black ops thriller series &quot;Echo 3&quot;. Morrison is known for voicing Chief Tui, the father of the Moana in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Moana&quot; (2016), and for playing Arthur Curry&#x27;s father Tom Curry in the DCEU films &quot;Aquaman&quot; (2018), &quot;The Flash&quot; (2023), and &quot;Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&quot; (2023).

==Early life==
Morrison was born in 1961 in the town of Rotorua, on the North Island of New Zealand. He is the son of Hana Morrison (née Stafford), and musician Laurie Morrison. He is Māori, of Te Arawa (Ngāti Whakaue) and Tainui (Ngāti Maniapoto, Ngāti Rarua) whakapapa, and also has Scottish and Irish ancestry. His sister was performer Taini Morrison and his uncle was musician Sir Howard Morrison. His secondary education took place at Wesley College, Auckland, and Western Heights High School, Rotorua.

==Career==
Morrison&#x27;s film debut is the 1973 film &quot;Rangi&#x27;s Catch&quot;, playing the title character. He trained in drama under the New Zealand Special Performing Arts Training Scheme. One of his earliest starring roles was in the 1988 film &quot;Never Say Die&quot;, opposite Lisa Eilbacher. After this he played Dr. Hone Ropata on the television soap opera &quot;Shortland Street&quot; from 1992 to 1995.

In 1994, he received attention for his role as the violently abusive Māori husband Jake &quot;The Muss&quot; Heke in &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot;, a film adaptation of Alan Duff&#x27;s novel &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot;. The film became the most successful local release in New Zealand, and sold to many countries. The role won him international acclaim and he received the award for best male performance in a dramatic role at the 1994 New Zealand Film and Television Awards. He reprised the role in the sequel, &quot;What Becomes of the Broken Hearted?&quot;, for which he received the Best Actor award from the New Zealand Film Awards. Morrison said in 2010 that he felt typecast by the role, to the point that it was &quot;a millstone round my neck&quot;. In 1996, he appeared in the Pamela Anderson film &quot;Barb Wire&quot;.

He has appeared in supporting roles in &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Beautiful Country&quot; (2004). In 2005, Morrison became the host of the talk show &quot;The Tem Show&quot; on New Zealand television.

In the 1996 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Morrison was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to drama.

He started writing an autobiography in 2009, which he hoped would inspire others to &quot;reach for the stars&quot;.

He released his debut album, &quot;Tem&quot;, through Sony Music Entertainment NZ in late November 2014. It consists of covers of songs that his father, and uncle Sir Howard Morrison, had performed at local venues when he was growing up.

===&quot;Star Wars&quot;===
Morrison became widely known outside of New Zealand with his role as bounty hunter Jango Fett in the 2002 film &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;. Part of the plot involves an army of clones created with Jango&#x27;s DNA, so Morrison also provided the voice acting for the clones. He reappeared as several clones in &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;, and re-recorded the lines of the character Boba Fett (Jango&#x27;s clone &quot;son&quot;) in the 2004 DVD re-releases of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, replacing the voice of Jason Wingreen.

Morrison has since portrayed Jango Fett and his clones in several &quot;Star Wars&quot; video games, all produced by LucasArts. He played the clone commando &quot;Boss&quot; in &quot;Star Wars: Republic Commando&quot; (2005), voiced all the troopers in &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront&quot; (2004), and voiced both Jango and Boba Fett in its sequel, &quot;Battlefront II&quot; (2005). Morrison reprised his role as Jango in &quot;Star Wars: Bounty Hunter&quot; (2002), a game centered around the character, and &quot;LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game&quot; (2005), along with his clones, but was uncredited in the latter. He voiced Boba in the 2006 game &quot;Star Wars: Empire at War&quot;, and DICE&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars Battlefront&quot; (2015) and &quot;Battlefront II&quot; (2017), the latter of which were produced by EA.

Morrison physically portrayed Boba Fett for the first time in the second season of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; (2020). In the show, Morrison portrays an aged, weathered version of the character. Morrison&#x27;s Fett has heavy scars on his face, and wears dark robes before reclaiming and restoring his armor. Morrison says that with the physically worn appearance, he adjusted his voice to be more gravelly, as if Boba&#x27;s vocal cords were affected by his past traumas. With the role, Morrison was also able to bring a bit of his own Māori culture to Fett&#x27;s portrayal. In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he said that he &quot;wanted to bring that kind of spirit and energy, which we call wairua, [to the role]&quot; and used that influence in his on-screen fight scenes, both in the hand-to-hand combat and while wielding weapons.

In 2020, a spinoff of the series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; was announced, titled &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;. Morrison reprises his role as Boba Fett, following Fett&#x27;s life after the events of the 1983 film &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. The series premiered on 29 December 2021.

In 2022, Morrison made a cameo appearance as a homeless veteran clone trooper in the &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot; TV series, and voiced Rex and other clones in an episode of &quot;Ahsoka&quot;.

===Other roles===
Morrison returned to &quot;Shortland Street&quot; for six weeks in June and July 2008 to reprise the role of Dr. Hone Ropata.

In 2008, he appeared on New Zealand skit comedy television show &quot;Pulp Sport&quot;, in a sketch that made fun of him being cloned.

Morrison has appeared in several DC Comics-related films. In the 2011 film &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, he portrayed Abin Sur. In 2018 he played lighthouse keeper Tom Curry, the father of the title character, in &quot;Aquaman&quot;. Morrison reprised the role in &quot;The Flash&quot;, released in 2023, and &quot;Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&quot;, which released in December 2023.

Morrison also provided the voice of Moana&#x27;s father, Chief Tui, in the 2016 animated Disney film of the same name. He reprised the role in the 2024 sequel, and also provided Tui&#x27;s singing voice instead of Christopher Jackson.

==Personal life==
Morrison lives in New Zealand, and divides his time between filming there, Australia, and the United States. He has an adult son from a relationship in the late-1980s with singer Kim Willoughby from the all-girl group When the Cat&#x27;s Away; and a daughter with Peata Melbourne. Morrison&#x27;s partner is Ashlee Howden-Sadlier, who is of Māori descent (specifically Tūhoe and Ngāti Porou descent).

<text>Jānis Lūsis (19 May 1939 – 29 April 2020) was a Latvian track and field athlete who competed in javelin throw.

== Biography ==

Lūsis trained at Daugava Voluntary Sports Society and later at Armed Forces sports society. He competed in four Summer Olympics for the USSR team, winning bronze in 1964 Olympics, gold in 1968 Olympics and silver in 1972 Olympics.

The javelin competition at the 1972 Games was the closest in Olympic history. Germany&#x27;s Klaus Wolfermann had taken the lead from Lūsis in the fifth round with an Olympic Record throw of 90.48 meters. Then, in the sixth and final round, Lūsis let fly with a very long effort that measured at 90.46 meters - Wolfermann&#x27;s two-centimeter margin was, at the time, the smallest unit of measurement used in javelin competitions.

, he remains the only Latvian to have won an all three classes of Olympic medals (gold, silver and bronze) over the span of his career. Lūsis set two world records in javelin throw, of 91.68 m in 1968 and of 93.80 m in 1972. He is also a 4-time European champion. In 1987 IAAF named him the greatest javelin thrower in history.

After Lūsis finished competing, he became an athletics coach. He was married to Elvīra Ozoliņa, the 1960 Olympic female champion in the javelin throw. Their son, Voldemārs Lūsis, is also a javelin thrower who competed in 2000 Summer Olympics and 2004 Summer Olympics.

During the 2009 Latvian Sportspersonality of the year award ceremony, Lūsis received the Lifetime Contribution to Sport award.

In 2014 he was inducted into IAAF Hall of Fame.

<text>Reinhardt Møbjerg Kristensen (born 1948) is a Danish invertebrate biologist, noted for the discovery of three new phyla of microscopic animals: the Loricifera in 1983, the Cycliophora in 1995, and the Micrognathozoa in 2000. He is also considered one of the world&#x27;s leading experts on tardigrades. His recent field of work revolves mostly around arctic biology.

He is also known for documenting &quot;Dendrogramma&quot;, an invertebrate genus that was later classified as Siphonophorae of the family Rhodaliidae.

== Loricifera ==

Kristensen collected the first members of the Loricifera phylum in Roscoff, France, in 1970, but did not describe it until 1983.

== Cycliophora ==
Kristensen and Peter Funch described &quot;Symbion pandora&quot;, on the mouth-parts of Norwegian lobsters, in 1995; other species were later found on other types of lobsters.

== Micrognathozoa ==
Kristensen described &quot;Limnognathia maerski&quot;, the first (and so far only) known species in the group, in a cold spring on Disko Island in 2000.

<text>Just One of the Guys is a 1985 American teen comedy film directed by Lisa Gottlieb and co-written by Dennis Feldman and Jeff Franklin. It is a loose adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. The film stars Joyce Hyser, Clayton Rohner, Billy Jacoby, Toni Hudson, and William Zabka.

In 2015, the film was ranked number 48 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; list of the &quot;50 Best High School Movies&quot;.

==Plot==

Terri Griffith is a high school student and aspiring journalist in Phoenix, Arizona, who feels that her teachers do not take her articles seriously because of her good looks. After failing to obtain her dream job as a newspaper intern, she concludes that it is because she is a girl.

Terri decides to remedy the situation while her parents are out of town on a two-week Caribbean vacation. She enrolls as a boy named &quot;Terry&quot; at a rival high school, her real identity known only to her sex-obsessed younger brother, Buddy, and her best friend, Denise. On her first day, she meets Rick Morehouse, a socially awkward transfer student whom she finds attractive. Trying to stay close to Rick, Terri helps him through an image makeover and encourages him to start talking to girls.

After many episodes in and out of school, including fending off a group of bullies led by bodybuilder Greg Tolan, dealing with her real college boyfriend Kevin, and being set up on a blind date with a potential new girlfriend named Sandy, Terri manages to be accepted as &quot;one of the guys&quot;.

At the senior prom, a jealous Greg picks a fight with Rick, who ultimately trounces the bully in front of the entire class. When Terri&#x27;s boyfriend shows up unexpectedly and discovers the ruse, Rick assumes that Terri&#x27;s big secret is that &quot;Terry&quot; is gay. To prove otherwise, Terri opens her shirt and reveals her breasts to Rick. Although she admits to loving Rick, he rejects her, prompting a desperate Terri to kiss him in front of everyone. To placate the awestruck students, Rick derisively announces that Terri &quot;has tits&quot; before leaving the prom and Terri behind.

Heartbroken and humiliated, Terri retreats to her room and writes a lengthy article on what it is like to be a girl in boys&#x27; clothing, detailing all of her positive and negative experiences. Terri then returns to her school. When her article is printed in the newspaper, she receives high praise and finally earns her dream job there. Nevertheless, she still yearns for Rick, who has not spoken to her since the prom.

One day during the summer, Rick suddenly turns up after reading her article. Realizing their true feelings for each other, they reconcile and plan another date. They decide to go for a drive in Terri&#x27;s car, but before Buddy can join them, an attractive blonde on a motorcycle rides up and beckons to him with a smile. Buddy then climbs onto the back of her motorcycle, and both couples happily part ways.

<doc id="897486" wikidata="Q192614" url="?curid=897486" title="God is dead">
<text>&quot;God is dead&quot; ( ; also known as the death of God) is a statement made by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. The first instance of this statement in Nietzsche&#x27;s writings is in his 1882 &quot;The Gay Science&quot;, where it appears three times. The phrase also appears at the beginning of Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;.

The meaning of this statement is that since, as Nietzsche says, &quot;the belief in the Christian God has become unbelievable&quot;, everything that was &quot;built upon this faith, propped up by it, grown into it&quot;, including &quot;the whole [...] European morality&quot;, is bound to &quot;collapse&quot;. The time of the Enlightenment had transformed collective human knowledge to the point where many would question their beliefs. The framing of the construct suggests that God could exist, from an atheistic perspective, in the minds of men rather than in reality, and so widespread disbelief would equate to God&#x27;s death.

Other philosophers had previously discussed the concept, including Philipp Mainländer and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. The phrase is also discussed in the Death of God theology.

== Early usage ==
Discourses of a &quot;death of God&quot; in German culture appear as early as the 17th century and originally referred to Lutheran theories of atonement. The phrase &quot;God is dead&quot; appears in the hymn &quot;Ein Trauriger Grabgesang&quot; (&quot;A mournful dirge&quot;) by Johann von Rist.

Before Nietzsche, the phrase &quot;&#x27;Dieu est mort!&quot;&#x27; (&#x27;God is dead&#x27;) was written in Gérard de Nerval&#x27;s 1854 poem &quot;Le Christ aux oliviers&quot; (&quot;Christ at the olive trees&quot;). The poem is an adaptation into a verse of a dream-vision that appears in Jean Paul&#x27;s 1797 novel &quot;Siebenkäs&quot; under the chapter title of &#x27;The Dead Christ Proclaims That There Is No God&#x27;. In an address he gave in 1987 to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the literary scholar George Steiner claims that Nietzsche&#x27;s formulation &#x27;God is dead&#x27; is indebted to the aforementioned &#x27;Dead Christ&#x27; dream-vision of Jean Paul, but he offers no concrete evidence that Nietzsche ever read Jean Paul.

The phrase is also found in a passage expressed by a narrator in Victor Hugo&#x27;s 1862 novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot;:

Buddhist philosopher K. Satchidananda Murty wrote in 1973 that, coming across in a hymn of Martin Luther what Hegel described as &quot;the cruel words&quot;, &quot;the harsh utterance&quot;, namely, &quot;God is dead&quot;, developed the theme of God&#x27;s death according to whom, to one form of experience, God is dead. Murty continued that commenting on Kant&#x27;s first &quot;Critique&quot;, Heinrich Heine who had purportedly influenced Nietzsche spoke of a dying God. Since Heine and Nietzsche the phrase &quot;Death of God&quot; became popular.

=== German philosophy ===

==== Hegel ====
Contemporary historians believe that 19th-century German idealist philosophers, especially those associated with Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, are responsible for removing the specifically Christian resonance of the phrase relating to the death of Jesus Christ and associating it with secular philosophical and sociological theories.

Although the statement and its meaning are attributed to Nietzsche, Hegel had discussed the concept of the death of God in his &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;, where he considers the death of God to &quot;Not be seen as anything but an easily recognized part of the usual Christian cycle of redemption&quot;. Later on Hegel writes about the great pain of knowing that God is dead: &quot;The pure concept, however, or infinity, as the abyss of nothingness in which all being sinks, must characterize the infinite pain, which previously was only in culture historically and as the feeling on which rests modern religion, the feeling that God Himself is dead, (the feeling which was uttered by Pascal, though only empirically, in his saying: Nature is such that it marks everywhere, both in and outside of man, a lost God), purely as a phase, but also as no more than just a phase, of the highest idea.&quot;

Hegel&#x27;s student Richard Rothe, in his 1837 theological text &quot;Die Anfänge der christlichen Kirche und ihrer Verfassung&quot;, appears to be one of the first philosophers to associate the idea of a death of God with the sociological theory of secularization.

==== Stirner ====
German philosopher Max Stirner, whose influence on Nietzsche is debated, writes in his 1844 book &quot;The Ego and its Own&quot; that &quot;the work of the Enlightenment, the vanquishing of God: they did not notice that man has killed God in order to become now – &#x27;sole God on high.

==== Mainländer ====
Before Nietzsche, the concept was popularized in philosophy by the German philosopher Philipp Mainländer.

It was while reading Mainländer that Nietzsche explicitly writes to have parted ways with Schopenhauer. In Mainländer&#x27;s more than 200 pages long criticism of Schopenhauer&#x27;s metaphysics, he argues against one cosmic unity behind the world, and champions a real multiplicity of wills struggling with each other for existence. Yet, the interconnection and the unitary movement of the world, which are the reasons that lead philosophers to pantheism, are undeniable. They do indeed lead to a unity, but this may not be at the expense of a unity &quot;in&quot; the world that undermines the empirical reality of the world. It is therefore declared to be dead.

== Nietzsche ==
In &quot;The Gay Science&quot;, &quot;God is dead&quot; is first mentioned in &quot;New Struggles&quot;:

Still in &quot;The Gay Science&quot;, the expression is stated through the voice of the &quot;madman&quot;, in &quot;The Madman&quot;, as follows:
In the madman passage, the madman is described as running through a marketplace shouting, &quot;I seek God! I seek God!&quot; He arouses some amusement; no one takes him seriously. &quot;Maybe he took an ocean voyage? Lost his way like a little child? Maybe he&#x27;s afraid of us (non-believers) and is hiding?&quot; – much laughter. Frustrated, the madman smashes his lantern on the ground, crying out that &quot;God is dead, and we have killed him, you and I!&quot;. &quot;But I have come too soon&quot;, he immediately realizes, as his detractors of a minute before stare in astonishment: people cannot yet see that they have killed God. He goes on to say: 

Lastly, &quot;The Meaning of our Cheerfulness&quot; section of &quot;The Gay Science&quot; discusses what &quot;God is dead&quot; means (&quot;that the belief in the Christian God has become unworthy of belief&quot;), and the consequences of this fact.

In &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, at the end of section 2 of Zarathustra&#x27;s prologue, after beginning his allegorical journey, Zarathustra encounters an aged ascetic who expresses misanthropy and love of God (a &quot;saint&quot;). Nietzsche writes:

What is more, Zarathustra later not only refers to the death of God but states: &quot;Dead are all the Gods.&quot; It is not just one morality that has died, but all of them, to be replaced by the life of the , the overman:

=== Explanations ===
Nietzsche recognized the crisis that this &quot;Death of God&quot; represented for existing moral assumptions in Europe as they existed within the context of traditional Christian belief. &quot;When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one&#x27;s feet. This morality is by no means self-evident [...] By breaking one main concept out of Christianity, the faith in God, one breaks the whole: nothing necessary remains in one&#x27;s hands.&quot;

=== Interpretation ===

==== Martin Heidegger ====
Martin Heidegger understood Nietzsche’s declaration &quot;God is dead&quot; as a commentary on the end of metaphysics. For Heidegger, Nietzsche’s statement signifies not merely a theological or cultural shift but marks the culmination—and, consequently, the demise—of philosophy as metaphysics. Heidegger argued that metaphysics, which had structured Western thought from its inception, had now reached its maximum potential and, in doing so, had exhausted its relevance. The &quot;death of God,&quot; then, is emblematic of this end, signaling the dissolution of any metaphysical worldview. According to Heidegger, metaphysics had been bound to end in this way since its origin.

Heidegger viewed the death of God as a pivotal moment in the history of thought, representing a transformation in humanity’s relationship to &quot;Being.&quot; This shift, he argued, invites a new mode of engagement with existence, one that transcends human-imposed structures of meaning and value. Unlike Nietzsche, who proposes the &quot;will to power&quot; as a means for individuals to assert their own values, Heidegger critiques this as a lingering form of human-centered valuation, one that still attempts to impose meaning onto existence.

Instead, Heidegger advocates a contemplative approach, suggesting that we &quot;let Being be&quot;—appreciating existence without the constraints of human valuation or the demand for purpose. This approach marks a philosophical divergence: while Nietzsche encourages the active creation of values in a world absent of divine authority, Heidegger calls for a more fundamental openness to Being itself, free from valuation. In this sense, the &quot;death&quot; of God is not only a loss but also an opportunity for a new, radically different understanding of existence.

== Death of God theology ==

Although theologians since Nietzsche had occasionally used the phrase &quot;God is dead&quot; to reflect increasing unbelief in God, the concept rose to prominence in theology in the late 1950s and 1960s, subsiding in the early 1970s, as the Death of God theology. The German-born theologian Paul Tillich, for instance, was influenced by the writings of Nietzsche, especially his phrase &quot;God is dead&quot;.

<text>Whistling Straits is one of two 36-hole links-style golf courses associated with Destination Kohler, a luxury golf resort owned and operated by the Kohler Company in Kohler, Wisconsin. The other course is Blackwolf Run, located in the Village of Kohler. The Whistling Straits complex is located north of Sheboygan, in the unincorporated community of Haven in the Town of Mosel in Sheboygan County. Whistling Straits is separated into two courses, the Straits Course and the Irish Course.

The courses at Whistling Straits (and Blackwolf Run) were designed by Pete and Alice Dye.

==Straits Course==
The Straits Course is the flagship course at Whistling Straits. As of 2012, it had a length of and a par of 72. It hosted the 2004 PGA Championship, the 2007 U.S. Senior Open, and the 2010 PGA Championship. The course hosted the PGA Championship for a third time in 2015 and the 2021 Ryder Cup was held on the course with the United States winning 19–9.

The Straits Course replicates the ancient seaside links courses of the United Kingdom and Ireland. Nestled along a two-mile (3 km) stretch of Lake Michigan shoreline, the course has eight holes hugging the lake, a flock of Scottish Blackface sheep, three stone bridges, and elevation changes of approximately . It has vast rolling greens, deep pot bunkers, grass-topped dunes and winds that sweep in off the lake. Being a coastal links-style course, there are few large trees or woods on the course, which is open and exposed to wind and the elements.

Before the course was built, the property was an abandoned airfield called Camp Haven (1949–1959), with a stream running through the middle. Wisconsin Electric purchased the property in the 1970s and attempted to build the Haven Nuclear Power Plant on the property, but its construction was opposed by local residents and Wisconsin Power &amp; Light (Sheboygan County&#x27;s major electric utility), and the company never built the plant. It then sold the property to the Kohler Company in the early 1990s.

Kohler Company CEO Herbert Kohler hired the Dyes to be the course architects. During construction, the original landscape of the Straits Course was covered with about 800,000 cubic yards (610,000 m3) of dirt and sand.

Hiroshi Iwata holds the course record for the Straits Course with a 63 in the second round of the 2015 PGA Championship.

==Irish Course==
The second course at Whistling Straits is the Irish Course, an inland grass-and-dune layout. It is a par-72 course that features of golf from the longest tees, with a course rating of 75.6 and a slope rating of 146. Also designed by Pete Dye, it opened for play in 2000. The course record of 67 was shot by Mike Frechette in 2007 and then matched by Garret Buckley at the 2014 Whistling Straits Intercollegiate.

<doc id="897495" wikidata="Q709094" url="?curid=897495" title="Paste (Unix)">
<text>paste is a Unix command line utility which is used to join files horizontally (parallel merging) by outputting lines consisting of the sequentially corresponding lines of each file specified, separated by tabs, to the standard output. 

==History==
The original Bell Labs version was written by Gottfried W. R. Luderer. The version of codice_1 bundled in GNU coreutils was written by David M. Ihnat and David MacKenzie. The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities.

==Usage==
The utility is invoked with the following syntax:

 paste [&quot;options&quot;] [&quot;file1&quot; ..]

==Description==
Once invoked, will read all its &quot;&quot; arguments. For each corresponding line, will append the contents of each file at that line to its output along with a tab. When it has completed its operation for the last file, will output a newline character and move on to the next line.

 exits after all streams return end of file. The number of lines in the output stream will equal the number of lines in the input file with the largest number of lines. Missing values are represented by empty strings. 

Though potentially useful, an option to have paste emit an alternate string for a missing field (such as &quot;NA&quot;) is not standard. 

A sequence of empty records at the bottom of a column of the output stream may or may not have been present in the input file corresponding to that column as explicit empty records, unless you know the input file supplied all rows explicitly (e.g. in the canonical case where all input files all do indeed have the same number of lines).

==Options==
The utility accepts the following options:

codice_2, which specifies a list of delimiters to be used instead of tabs for separating consecutive values on a single line. Each delimiter is used in turn; when the list has been exhausted, begins again at the first delimiter.

codice_3, which causes to append the data in serial rather than in parallel; that is, in a horizontal rather than vertical fashion.

==Examples==
For the following examples, assume that is a plain-text file that contains the following information:

and that is another plain-text file that contains the following information:

The following example shows the invocation of with and as well as the resulting output:

$ paste names.txt numbers.txt
Mark Smith 555-1234
Bobby Brown 555-9876
Sue Miller 555-6743
Jenny Igotit 867-5309

When invoked with the option ( on BSD or older systems), the output of is adjusted such that the information is presented in a horizontal fashion:

$ paste --serial names.txt numbers.txt
Mark Smith Bobby Brown Sue Miller Jenny Igotit
555-1234 555-9876 555-6734 867-5309

Finally, the use of the option ( on BSD or older systems) is illustrated in the following example:

$ paste --delimiters . names.txt numbers.txt
Mark Smith.555-1234
Bobby Brown.555-9876
Sue Miller.555-6743
Jenny Igotit.867-5309

As an example usage of both, the command can be used to concatenate multiple consecutive lines into a single row:

$ paste --serial --delimiters &#x27;\t\n&#x27; names.txt
Mark Smith Bobby Brown
Sue Miller Jenny Igotit

<doc id="897496" wikidata="Q913673" url="?curid=897496" title="Underoath">
<text>Underoath (styled as Underøath or UnderOath) is an American rock band from Tampa, Florida. It was founded by lead vocalist Dallas Taylor and guitarist Luke Morton in 1997 in Ocala, Florida; subsequently, its additional members were from Tampa, including drummer, singer and last remaining original member Aaron Gillespie. The band&#x27;s current lineup consists of Gillespie, keyboardist Christopher Dudley, lead guitarist Timothy McTague, bassist Grant Brandell, and lead vocalist Spencer Chamberlain. Originally, the band identified as a Christian group; they have since distanced themselves from Christianity.

The band&#x27;s lineup shifted frequently during its early years. Taylor recorded &quot;Act of Depression&quot;, &quot;Cries of the Past&quot;, and &quot;The Changing of Times&quot; with the band and remained with the group until his departure in 2003; Chamberlain replaced him as lead vocalist, and the lineup has remained mostly stable since. The band then released &quot;They&#x27;re Only Chasing Safety&quot; and &quot;Define the Great Line&quot;, and both earned gold certifications by the RIAA. These two albums remain their most commercially successful releases, and provided them with mainstream status; the latter of the two holds their highest &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 entry, peaking at no. 2. Following their sixth studio album, &quot;Lost in the Sound of Separation&quot;, which also reached a top-ten peak on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Gillespie left the group and was replaced by former Norma Jean drummer Daniel Davison. Their seventh album, &quot;Ø (Disambiguation)&quot;, was released in 2010; Chamberlain and McTague provided more prominent sung vocals in Gillespie&#x27;s absence. On October 2, 2012, Underoath announced that they would be disbanding in 2013; they played their final show that January.

On August 17, 2015, the band announced they had reunited; in doing so, Gillespie returned to the lineup. After performing at A Day to Remember&#x27;s Self Help Fest in 2016, Underoath announced their eighth studio album, &quot;Erase Me&quot;, would be released 2018. It was their first album in 8 years and their first in 10 years with Gillespie; the band also publicly abandoned their Christian musical approach starting with this record. The follow-up, &quot;Voyeurist&quot;, was released in January 2022.

== History ==
=== Formation and &quot;Act of Depression&quot; (1997–2000) ===

On November 30, 1997, Underoath formed with Dallas Taylor and guitarist Luke Morton in Ocala, Florida. Morton devised the name Underoath &quot;from somewhere in the Bible.&quot; Drummer Aaron Gillespie, who attended Morton&#x27;s church, was then asked to play with them. Gillespie agreed, and the group recruited guitarist Corey Steger and bassist Octavio Fernandez; the band members were all in high school.

After a year of playing at festivals and touring the area around Florida, Underoath signed to Alabama&#x27;s Takehold Records in 1999. Around this time Luke Morton had left the band without appearing on any of their formal recordings. They released their debut &quot;Act of Depression&quot; that July, and it sold over 2,000 copies.

=== &quot;Cries of the Past&quot; and &quot;The Changing of Times&quot; (2000–2003) ===

In 2000, keyboardist Christopher Dudley joined Underoath, and the five-song, forty-minute long record, &quot;Cries of the Past&quot; was released, quickly selling 3,000 copies. In 2001, Corey Steger left the band; he died in a car accident on March 17, 2021. Takehold Records was bought out by Seattle&#x27;s Tooth &amp; Nail Records and Underoath was subsequently signed to the label&#x27;s subsidiary, Solid State Records. In January 2002, bassist Grant Brandell joined Underoath. The band then began working on their Solid State debut, &quot;The Changing of Times&quot;, with &quot;Cries of the Past&quot; producer James Paul Wisner. The album was released on February 26, 2002, and produced one single: &quot;When the Sun Sleeps&quot;. Dallas Taylor explained that the lyrics on &quot;The Changing of Times&quot; were about &quot;people playing with other people&#x27;s emotions and how it can leave you bitter&quot; and &quot;struggling through life&#x27;s hardships and trying to find God in all of it.&quot;

In 2003, Underoath supported the album&#x27;s release with their first inclusion on Warped Tour, however their participation in the tour came to an end when Taylor (under controversial conditions) was asked to leave the band. Dudley explained at that time that Taylor could no longer tour with Underoath for various reasons and left on his own decision. Under speculation of a potential breakup, the band then went on a supporting tour with Atreyu in August 2003 with Matt Tarpey as the temporary lead vocalist, while at the time being a part of Winter Solstice. In October 2003, at the CMJ Fest in New York City, the band reappeared with Spencer Chamberlain, formerly of the band This Runs Through, as the new lead vocalist. Chamberlain had toured with Underoath when fronting his former band and at one time was roommates with Dudley; their previous friendship with Chamberlain was considered when making him lead vocalist. Gillespie explained that before Chamberlain had been in the band, the group members &quot;didn&#x27;t really get along&quot;, however, after Chamberlain joined &quot;everything was just normal, we clicked&quot;. After Chamberlain became a permanent member, Underoath discussed the possibility of changing the name and becoming a new band. Ultimately, the members decided to remain as Underoath.

=== &quot;They&#x27;re Only Chasing Safety&quot; (2004–2005) ===

After taking the end of 2003 off from touring to begin working on an album, the band scheduled time in February 2004 to begin recording.

During the early months of 2004, Underoath returned to the studio with Chamberlain as lead vocalist and producer James Paul Wisner. &quot;They&#x27;re Only Chasing Safety&quot; was released on June 15, 2004, and proved to be a more commercial success for the band, going onto outsell the previous three albums combined. The album sold close to 100,000 copies in its first week of release and was certified gold by the end of 2005, selling more than 487,000 copies. With Gillespie being the only original member, &quot;They&#x27;re Only Chasing Safety&quot; had been a vast change in sound and rhythm from what they performed earlier on. &quot;Reinventing Your Exit&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Dangerous Business Walking out Your Front Door&quot; were released as the album&#x27;s two singles and both songs spawned music videos that received frequent airplay on MTV2 and Fuse.

In March 2005, Underoath participated in the inaugural Taste of Chaos tour, and shortly after, embarked on their first headlining tour. The band premiered two brand-new songs during the length of the tour. They played a part of the Warped Tour, but declined to perform for the entirety of the tour in order to take time to record another album. Underoath made their first covers of national magazines appearing on &quot;CCM Magazine&quot; in July 2005 and then &quot;Alternative Press&quot; in September, and in October, &quot;They&#x27;re Only Chasing Safety&quot; was re-released in a two-disc set with four formerly unreleased songs. Also included was re-mastered album artwork by Jacob Bannon of Converge, and a DVD with over two hours of footage of the band touring in support of the album. As of 2005, &quot;They&#x27;re Only Chasing Safety&quot; has sold more than 218,000 copies, with the re-release selling an additional 279,000 copies, making a combined sales of more than 500,000 copies in the US alone.

=== &quot;Define the Great Line&quot; (2006–2007) ===

The title for their fifth album, &quot;Define the Great Line&quot; is presented upon the theory of an individual having &quot;to find that line and that way to live your life.&quot; The band had been writing for the album two weeks after the release of &quot;They&#x27;re Only Chasing Safety&quot;. Matt Goldman, who produced albums for Copeland and Norma Jean, and Adam Dutkiewicz, guitarist for Killswitch Engage, enlisted as producers. Chamberlain noted that the vocals for the album would sound less like an imitation of former vocalist Taylor, but more like the vocals of Chamberlain&#x27;s former band. The lyrics were also meaningful to Chamberlain because they had been written about &quot;things that have molded him into who he is today&quot;.

An unfinished version of the album was leaked onto BitTorrent websites and P2P services months before the release date. Drummer Aaron Gillespie, during the short time after the recording of &quot;Define the Great Line&quot;, recorded the debut album for his side-project The Almost, which was produced by Seattle producer Aaron Sprinkle and was released April 3, 2007. In April 2006, the band had been courted by several major record labels, instead re-signing with Tooth &amp; Nail Records because they felt that major labels &quot;don&#x27;t get heavy bands&quot; and &quot;we don&#x27;t really agree with a lot of the business practices major labels employ sometimes.&quot; On April 21, Underoath flew to Sweden to work with Popcore Films, to create music videos for &quot;In Regards to Myself&quot; and &quot;Writing on the Walls&quot;; the latter was chosen as the lead single for the album and was later nominated for the 2007 Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video. Dudley commented that the videos were &quot;high-energy videos and more intricate than any video we&#x27;ve ever done.&quot;

Released on June 20, 2006, &quot;Define the Great Line&quot; sold 98,000 copies in its first week and debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Chart at No. 2, the highest debut for a Christian album since 1997. With the debut of &quot;Define the Great Line&quot;, Underoath simultaneously released a special edition version of the album featuring special artwork and a DVD that includes another behind-the-scenes movie and a &quot;making of&quot; video. &quot;Define the Great Line&quot; was certified Gold by the RIAA on November 11, 2006, representing 500,000 shipped units of the album. The album was also released on vinyl however, this edition was limited to only 3,000 copies.

The band was scheduled to spend June and July 2006 on the main stage of the Warped Tour, but on July 28, 2006, it was announced that Underoath was dropping off the remaining dates of the tour. A statement from the band stated that the members &quot;felt it necessary to take some immediate time to focus on our friendship, as that&#x27;s more important than risking it for the sake of touring at this time.&quot; In an &quot;Alternative Press&quot; cover story on Underoath, Michael &quot;Fat Mike&quot; Burkett told the magazine that Chamberlain had confided in him that Underoath&#x27;s band members had been &quot;having a lot of arguments over their religious beliefs.&quot; Burkett admitted to Punknews.org that he had poked fun at the band for their beliefs, but emphasized that he befriended Underoath&#x27;s band members at the start of the tour and had a personal policy of not making jokes on-stage about anyone he was not friends with or did not like personally. It was also spread that the band&#x27;s withdrawal from the tour was due to Chamberlain&#x27;s rumored drug problems and time spent in rehabilitation, to which Gillespie responded, &quot;If there was something serious going on like that and he was in rehab, we&#x27;d have to tell the press. But it&#x27;s just not true.&quot; Underoath toured extensively throughout Europe, Australia and Asia in the late 2006, from February to April in 2007 toured with Taking Back Sunday and Armor for Sleep.

Underoath shot videos for the songs &quot;You&#x27;re Ever So Inviting&quot; and &quot;A Moment Suspended in Time&quot; in February 2007; both videos have been released and &quot;You&#x27;re Ever So Inviting&quot; won MTV&#x27;s Battle of the Videos on May 23, 2007. Underoath performed a Canadian tour followed by the Taste of Chaos World Tour, and also played at the 2007 Cornerstone Festival. On July 17, 2007, Underoath released their &quot;777&quot; DVD to the US market. Underoath also played the Warped Tour 2007 from July 24 to August 9, and in August 2007, toured Australia and East Asia. During a tour with Maylene and the Sons of Disaster, Poison the Well, and Every Time I Die, Gillespie went through emergency surgery on an infection in his hand. Instead of cancelling shows, Underoath recruited Kenny Bozich, the drummer of Gillespie&#x27;s band, The Almost.
Underoath lead vocalist Spencer Chamberlain was featured on the cover of the &quot;Warped Tour 2008 Tour Compilation&quot; album.

=== &quot;Lost in the Sound of Separation&quot; (2008–2009) ===

During the September 2007 tour, Chamberlain stated various times that the band will release a new album in mid-2008. It was later confirmed that it would be released on September 2, 2008. Recording for the album began in March 2008 and ended in April 2008. McTague said that the album, &quot;Lost in the Sound of Separation&quot;, would be considerably heavier than &quot;Define the Great Line&quot;.
In October 2007, Underoath had begun filming their third person documentary &quot;Survive, Kaleidoscope&quot;. &quot;The Audible Diversion Group&quot;, a small film team, shot footage of the band as they followed Underoath on their September tour and the entirety of the &quot;We Believe in Dino-Tours&quot;. The film was shot in 720p high definition 16:9 widescreen format. Underoath released the &quot;Survive, Kaleidoscope&quot; live CD/DVD on May 27, 2008. The album opened at No. 81 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band recorded the concert footage at a performance in Philadelphia at the Electric Factory in October 2007.

During mid-2008, Underoath joined the 30-city Rockstar Energy Mayhem Tour with bands such as Slipknot, Disturbed, Mastodon, and DragonForce. The tour began on July 9, 2008, and concluded in Buffalo, New York, on August 19, with Underoath headlining the tour&#x27;s stop at the Hot Topic venue. After the release of &quot;Lost in the Sound of Separation&quot; on September 2, 2008, Underoath began headlining tour in support of the album, along with Saosin and The Devil Wears Prada, and in various markets, P.O.S, Person L, and The Famine.

In its first week, &quot;Lost in the Sound of Separation&quot; debuted at No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, selling around 56,000 copies in the US alone. In December 2008, Underoath won Best Hardcore/Screamo Artist at the Rock on Request Awards and embarked on their first South American Tour. The band played six concerts in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Colombia, and played at Warped Tour 2009. On international tours in 2009, Underoath began writing pieces of new songs for their fifth studio release. The songs &quot;Desperate Times, Desperate Measures&quot; and &quot;Too Bright to See, Too Loud to Hear&quot; were released as the two singles from the album.

=== Departure of Aaron Gillespie and &quot;Ø (Disambiguation)&quot; (2010–2011) ===

During a late 2009 interview, guitarist Timothy McTague stated that the band had &quot;just started writing songs that may be included on the next record&quot;, and that they are hoping to enter the studio late summer or early fall 2010. Underoath is set to release their live album &quot;Live at Koko&quot; exclusively to their UK audience via their UK merchandise site. On February 25, 2010, Underoath stated they were finishing writing their new album.

On April 5, 2010, the band announced the departure of their final founding member, drummer and vocalist, Aaron Gillespie. Aaron played his final show with the band in Milan, Italy, on April 6.

On May 10, 2010, through their official MySpace blog, Underoath announced that they will be entering the studio on May 24 to record their follow up to &quot;Lost in the Sound of Separation&quot;, which was aimed to be released later that year, with producers Matt Goldman (&quot;Lost in the Sound of Separation&quot; and &quot;Define the Great Line&quot;) and Jeremy SH Griffith. Following the departure of Gillespie, Underoath recruited ex-Norma Jean drummer Daniel Davison for the recording of their new album. Davison&#x27;s first tour with the band was &quot;The Cool Tour&quot; featuring As I Lay Dying and Blessthefall. The band then announced that the new album, &quot;Ø (Disambiguation)&quot;, will be released on November 9, 2010, through Tooth &amp; Nail Records. On September 9, 2010, it was announced that Underoath had signed to Roadrunner Records for worldwide distribution outside of the US and Canada.

On September 14, 2010, the band held a listening party for &quot;Ø (Disambiguation)&quot; at Swinghouse Studios in Los Angeles. Danny Sugimoto of spitInthemud.com remarked that the album &quot;feels darker and more chaotic than ones prior, yet with a tasteful sense of calm mixed within.&quot;

Underoath embarked on their headlining November tour on the 2nd of the month. On November 23, vocalist, Spencer Chamberlain began to suffer from foodborne disease. His position in Underoath was substituted by Tyler Smith of The Word Alive for the show scheduled that day.

On October 18, 2011, a compilation, &quot;Play Your Old Stuff&quot;, was released, containing three previously released albums: &quot;The Changing of Times&quot;, &quot;They&#x27;re Only Chasing Safety&quot; and &quot;Define the Great Line&quot;, along with new artwork.

=== Anthology, breakup, and farewell tour (2012–2013) ===
On October 2, 2012, the band announced through their Twitter account that they would be disbanding in 2013. In addition, the band released a career-spanning compilation album, &quot;&quot; on November 6, 2012.

On October 9, 2012, they announced their farewell tour with mewithoutYou, As Cities Burn, and letlive. as opening acts.

On January 26, 2013, Underoath played their final show at Jannus Live in St. Petersburg, Florida. Aaron Gillespie also performed on the songs &quot;Emergency Broadcast :: The End is Near&quot; and &quot;Reinventing Your Exit&quot;.

=== Post-breakup activities, reunion, and tours (2015–2017) ===
In January 2015, the band launched a campaign to finalize production of documentary film about their farewell tour of 12 shows, posting two trailers on that subject to their YouTube channel.

In July 2015, Underoath began teasing the phrase &quot;rebirth is coming&quot; and an accompanying cryptic video across their social media accounts. The audio portion to the cryptic video, when played backwards, turned out to be the chorus for &quot;It&#x27;s Dangerous Business Walking Out Your Front Door&quot; off the band&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;They&#x27;re Only Chasing Safety&quot;, and a countdown timer ending on August 24, 2015, later appeared on the band&#x27;s website.

On August 17, 2015, the band&#x27;s first show since disbanding in 2013 was announced, headlining the Self Help Fest in San Bernardino, California on March 19, 2016, along with A Day to Remember. In an interview article for &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, it was confirmed that the band was reuniting, including Gillespie&#x27;s return to the lineup.

=== &quot;Erase Me&quot;, &quot;Voyeurist&quot; and &quot;The Place After This One&quot; (2018–present) ===
&quot;Erase Me&quot; was released via Fearless Records on April 6, 2018. The band released &quot;Rapture&quot;, the second single from the album, on March 19. The band kicked off with the No Fix tour in support of the album in late April 2018 with Dance Gavin Dance. The lead single of the album, &quot;On My Teeth&quot;, received a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance; it lost to High on Fire&#x27;s &quot;Electric Messiah&quot;.

The band supported Korn and Alice in Chains during a mid-2019 North American tour. On July 14, 2021, the band released &quot;Damn Excuses&quot;, the lead single from their ninth album &quot;Voyeurist&quot;. The album marked their first in nearly four years, their longest gap between albums without breaking up. It was originally intended for release in October 2021, but was pushed back by three months due to vinyl production delays. On August 4, 2021, the band released the second single from the album, &quot;Hallelujah&quot;.

On September 22, 2021, the band released the third single &quot;Pneumonia&quot; and revealed it was written exactly one year prior to release. The single was also partly inspired by the passing of guitarist Tim McTague&#x27;s father. &quot;Voyeurist&quot; was released on January 14, 2022. On March 28, 2023, long-time rhythm guitarist James Smith announced that he had been &quot;informed&quot; he was no longer a member of Underoath.

Underoath were the featured artist on three tracks in 2024: Bring Me The Horizon&#x27;s &quot;A Bullet w/ My Name On&quot;, Mitchell Tenpenny&#x27;s &quot;Demon or Ghost&quot; and Des Rocs&#x27; &quot;In The Night&quot;. The band also released three new singles throughout 2024: &quot;Teeth&quot; in September, &quot;Survivors Guilt&quot; in October, and &quot;Generation No Surrender&quot; in December. Also in December, at a concert in St. Petersburg, Florida, Dallas Taylor appeared on stage with Underoath and performed the song &quot;When the Sun Sleeps&quot; alongside all current members. All three of Underoath&#x27;s 2024 singles will feature on their 10th studio album, &quot;The Place After This One&quot;, which will be released on March 28, 2025.

== Musical style and influences ==
=== Christianity ===
Underoath&#x27;s members identified as Christian in their earlier years and stated during that time period that they were a Christian band. However, as vocalist Spencer Chamberlain explained in 2006, &quot;[We are Christian but] in a different way. We&#x27;re not like your average Christian band.&quot; He explains that Christianity is the &quot;backbone of our lives, especially in the way that we handle certain things, but it&#x27;s not so much the backbone of our lyrics. It&#x27;s not like every song is a lesson from the Bible or something. It&#x27;s just normal life struggles.&quot; Keyboardist Christopher Dudley stated that a majority of Underoath&#x27;s audience is not Christian, nor are the bands with whom they would often tour. Though the band has been noted for &quot;setting precedent in both Christian rock and beyond&quot;, only a portion of their albums are sold in the Christian marketplace. Chamberlain said, &quot;I look at us as just another band in the secular market like with all these other hardcore bands and we just happen to be a Christian band that has different beliefs.&quot; However, in an interview with &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, Drummer Aaron Gillespie stated that &quot;I&#x27;m definitely a Christian, but I don&#x27;t think Underoath should be a &#x27;Christian band&#x27;&quot; The band has since openly distanced themselves from Christianity and organized religion.

Upon releasing their comeback single, &quot;On My Teeth&quot;, from &quot;Erase Me&quot;, the band&#x27;s first song to feature profanity in their entire career, the band updated their Spotify profile to read &quot;The band who once openly—and without apology—professed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, &quot;Erase Me&quot; illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal, and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems.&quot; In a 2018 interview, Spencer Chamberlain stated that, &quot;my journey and my role in playing in a Christian band, I held a huge burden and I got burnt badly and was treated awfully. I&#x27;m not saying religion is wrong for everyone, but for me it was wrong. It ruined my life, turned me into a drug addict and people were awful to me the whole time. I never felt more alone in my life than when I was Christian.&quot;

=== Genre ===

Underoath have been labeled as metalcore, hardcore punk, post-hardcore, emo, screamo, and Christian metal. The band&#x27;s style has changed over the years, as explained by AllMusic: &quot;since their inception, Florida&#x27;s Underoath have evolved from a run-of-the-mill Christian metalcore band into a fluid, dynamic, and energized rock group that adeptly blends emotive melody, charged punk rock rhythms, and a chunky, engaging bottom end.&quot; Jesus Freak Hideout also took notice of this, mentioning in a review that &quot;Underoath&#x27;s sound has evolved a lot — from metal to emocore to straight-up hardcore.&quot;

As demonstrated on their first release, &quot;Act of Depression&quot;, Underoath initially played a combination of hardcore and metalcore mixed with black metal and death metal. The band kept a similar sound on their second album, &quot;Cries of the Past&quot;, featuring occasional traces of black metal, but the band later moved away from this style to embrace a more melodic-leaning post-hardcore sound. On the follow up release, Underoath stood &quot;at the heavy metal crossroads on &quot;The Changing of Times&quot;, a hardcore album that parallels classic arena rock.&quot; The band experimented with electronic elements, with Casey Boland of &quot;Alternative Press&quot; noting that the album &quot;was an Olympic pole vault-like leap forward for Underoath,&quot; and that the band was &quot;welcoming the process of evolution.&quot; He also noted the addition of Aaron Gillespie&#x27;s sung singing, which offered &quot;a compelling counterpoint and presaged a swarm of bands adopting the sing-scream dichotomy that would become the hallmark of &#x27;screamo.&#x27;&quot; Cross Rhythms noted the growing popularity of the band, and described them as playing &quot;an interesting mix of hardcore and indie rock, utilising loops, keyboards, acoustic guitars and melodic vocal harmonies, amongst the onslaught of heavy guitars and screeching hardcore vocals.&quot;

Underoath underwent an extreme overhaul preceding their fourth release, &quot;They&#x27;re Only Chasing Safety&quot;, with Dallas Taylor and Octavio Fernandez leaving the band and Spencer Chamberlain taking over lead vocal duties. This marked a radical shift for Underoath, &quot;as the band ditched its formerly metal leanings for the decidedly friendly confines of screamo,&quot; a change with ignited a debate over which was better, &quot;old&quot; or &quot;new&quot; Underoath. A review by Alex Henderson of AllMusic classifies the album under an alternative rock style which could be described as screamo, post-hardcore, or melodic hardcore, and which differed from full-out metalcore. In another review, Andrew Segal of Cross Rhythms described the album as nu metal, and said that, while on the heavier side of the rock scale, the album is well produced and &quot;shows more signs of intelligence than the [nu-metal] genre is often credited with.&quot;

For their fifth album, &quot;Define the Great Line&quot;, Underoath abandoned the pop choruses of the previous album and instead demonstrated a heavier and more eclectic style, updating their sound with &quot;weird&quot; time changes and ambient post-metal passages. According to Sputnikmusic, while the album is basically a modern metalcore recording, it incorporated other influences including post-metal guitar leads on several tracks and ambient electronica on tracks such as &quot;Salmarnir&quot;. AllMusic stated that the band found the &quot;delicate middle ground between throat-shredding grindcore and My Chemical Romance/From Autumn to Ashes-style emo-punk,&quot; and Cross Rhythms described the album as &quot;an impressively versatile project where metal riffs and emo breakdowns, screamo noise and memorable hooks collide in a veritable sonic feast.&quot;

Underoath&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Lost in the Sound of Separation&quot;, established Spencer Chamberlain as the band&#x27;s frontman and saw the band incorporating some industrial elements. With the departure of the last original member of Underoath, Aaron Gillespie, the band underwent their &quot;biggest shift in sound for the band in a long time.&quot; &quot;Ø (Disambiguation)&quot; featured a darker and more immersive approach than their previous albums, and used a heavy atmospheric and ambient sound and also utilized groove sections on some tracks. &quot;Erase Me&quot;, the band&#x27;s comeback album, saw more of an emphasis on alternative rock.

=== Influences ===
Underoath&#x27;s stated influences have included Refused, At the Drive-In, Jimmy Eat World, Radiohead and Isis, with guitarist Timothy McTague describing At the Drive-In in particular as &quot;probably one of the biggest influences&quot; on the band. With the departure of Dallas Taylor following &quot;The Changing of Times&quot;, an album that foreshadowed the changes to come for the band, the group&#x27;s style took a new direction courtesy of new vocalist Spencer Chamberlain. Beginning with &quot;They&#x27;re Only Chasing Safety,&quot; the writing dynamic changed in the band, as Chamberlain and drummer/vocalist Aaron Gillespie now wrote all the lyrics they sang. On &quot;Define the Great Line&quot;, Chamberlain noted that his vocals now sounded less like an imitation of Taylor and more like the vocals of his previous band, This Runs Through. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; wrote of the album, &quot;[Chamberlain&#x27;s] bellow [is] more carnal and guttural, [and] his high end more tuneful than whiny.&quot;

The Bogside Artists first began working together in 1993 to document the events surrounding the Northern Ireland Troubles. With supplies donated from local residents, they painted several murals on the walls of buildings in Rossville Street, commemorating the Northern Ireland civil rights movement, the Battle of the Bogside, and Bloody Sunday in which British Army paratroopers opened fire on marches; 13 civilians were killed on the day and one subsequently.

From 1994 to 2008, they painted a total of twelve murals in the Bogside, which they collectively named &quot;The People&#x27;s Gallery&quot;. The People&#x27;s Gallery spans the entire length of Rossville Street, which runs through the centre of the Bogside. It is a unique visual display – an entire street devoted to the history of over three decades of political conflict in the province as it affected the city. It occupies no fewer than four pages in the Lonely Planet guide (2012). The gallery has never been promoted either by the local council or by any other body including the tour bodies or arts bodies, many of which are run by Sinn Féin. The gallery was officially inaugurated in August 2007 and an additional mural dedicated to Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and retired leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, John Hume, was completed in 2008.

The Bogside Artists have exhibited their work widely in various cities, including Boston, Sydney, Brisbane, Chicago, London and Washington, D.C. They have painted a number of other works, most notably a mural of Martin Luther King Jr. in Washington D.C. In September 2011 they painted a mural for the town of Vordernberg Austria on the controversial theme of the New World Order. More recently they completed a mural for Europe&#x27;s City of Culture Maribor, Slovenia that was unveiled by the Dalai Lama. They see their work as humanitarian and human as &quot;men speaking to men&quot; ( Tom Kelly, spokesman) and have little time or interest in contemporary art. &quot;All real art is contemporary as it has its origins in the truthful state of mind which is timeless&quot;. On their website one will find their manifesto.

==Art and peacebuilding==
The Bogside Artists design the murals of The People’s Gallery are not as &quot;political propaganda, declarations of identity, or territorial markers.&quot; The murals of the Bogside Artists are supposed to make its audiences &quot;think about the past and process painful memories&quot; and &quot;enable and facilitate cross-community conversation around shared experiences seen from different perspectives and contexts.&quot; They hope that this will foster mutual understanding, reconciliation and the building of peace.

In addition to their work as muralists, the Bogside Artists also conducted numerous art workshops throughout the years with local Catholic and Protestant children to promote cross-community understanding.

They were also featured in many documentaries &quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot; and &quot;Window on the West&quot;, etc.

==Controversy==
In November 2005, Walter Momper, president of the Berlin State Parliament, cancelled a planned exhibition of the Bogside murals in the parliament building. He criticised the artists for their &quot;partiality&quot; in only representing one side of the conflicts in Northern Ireland. The artists stated that the murals are intended to be &quot;a human document&quot; rather than a political or sectarian statement.

<text>Raybon Kan (born 1966) is a New Zealand comedian and newspaper columnist.

==Early life and family==
Kan&#x27;s family moved to Wellington, New Zealand soon after his birth in Masterton. He began his education at St Mark&#x27;s Church School. He showed an early flair for public performance which he continued at Wellington College and was School Council President and proxime accessit to dux. He attended Victoria University of Wellington&#x27;s law school, and earned his LL B(Hons) and was admitted to the Bar. During his university days, he captained his team to second place in the World Universities Debating Championships, losing the final to the University of Oxford. While at Victoria University he won the Dominion Journalism Scholarship, and the Energy Law Research Scholarship. His article on energy law was published in the &quot;New Zealand Law Journal&quot;.

==Career==
Kan first came to media prominence writing television reviews for &quot;The Dominion&quot; newspaper in Wellington and performed stand-up comedy on stage and on television. His television work included regular appearances on comedy sketch shows.

Kan was named Best Comedian by &quot;Metro&quot; and &quot;North and South&quot; magazines on repeated occasions in New Zealand. He has performed at the Melbourne Comedy Festival, (where The Age newspaper named him one of the festival&#x27;s highlights,) the Montreal Comedy Festival (1998 and 2001) and the Edinburgh Fringe. He has also performed in Calgary, Toronto, Vancouver, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Sydney. He was nominated for the inaugural Billy T Award in 1997.

His movie reviews featured in TV3&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot; nightly news programme. His New Zealand TV appearances include &quot;Pulp Comedy&quot;, &quot;Laugh Festival Gala,&quot; &quot;Before Stardom&quot;, &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Famous Now&quot;, &quot;Skitz&quot;, &quot;Test the Nation&quot; (which he won three times), &quot;The Great New Zealand Spelling Bee&quot;, &quot;Inside New Zealand&quot;, a documentary in which he trained for two months to be a casino croupier; and a profile in TV&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. In Australia he performed on &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; and was interviewed by Bert Newton.

Kan wrote &quot;Five Days in Las Vegas&quot; in the early 1990s about his travels to the United States where he appeared on &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. Another travel-based book &quot;America on Five Bullets a Day&quot; was published in 1998 and featured his love of tennis. A collection of his short writings was published by Penguin in 2004 as &quot;An Asian at My Table&quot;. For many years he continued to write a column in The Sunday Star Times.

He has appeared in the films &quot;I&#x27;ll Make You Happy&quot; (directed by Athina Tsoulis), &quot;Tongan Ninja&quot; (directed by Jason Stutter), and &quot;Spooked&quot; (directed by Geoff Murphy). In November 2004, he became the TV commercial spokesman for the Freedom Air airline in New Zealand.

For a time, Kan was based in the United Kingdom, and in 2009 he performed his stand-up show &#x27;Spermbank Millionaire&#x27; at the Edinburgh Fringe. The film he starred in, and co-wrote with Jason Stutter, &quot;&quot;, was also released in 2009.

==Personal life==

Kan has returned to New Zealand. He continues to provide commentary on social issues in print media, and is a guest speaker for events. He is of Chinese heritage and has commented on how racist attitudes affect people of Asian appearance in New Zealand. In 2008, Kan was awarded a Bravo award by the New Zealand Skeptics for his column &quot;I see dud people,&quot; wherein he stated &quot;I don’t want to get in the way of entertainers earning a crust, but it’s scummy to pretend to communicate with the dead to take advantage of grieving relatives.&quot;

<doc id="897503" wikidata="Q1298697" url="?curid=897503" title="Alexisonfire">
<text>Alexisonfire (pronounced &quot;Alexis on Fire&quot;) is a Canadian post-hardcore band formed in St. Catharines, Ontario in 2001. The band&#x27;s members are George Pettit (vocals), Dallas Green (vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards), Wade MacNeil (lead guitar, vocals), Chris Steele (bass) and Jordan Hastings (drums, percussion). The band has won numerous awards, and in Canada their albums have all been certified either gold or platinum.

==History==

===&quot;Alexisonfire&quot; (2001–2003)===
Alexisonfire was formed in late 2001 in the aftermath of a three-band break up. Pettit was playing guitar in a metal band called Condemning Salem, Green was lead singer and guitar player in Helicon Blue, and MacNeil and Steele played in a punk band called Plan 9. These bands broke up at the same time, and Pettit, Steele, MacNeil and Green recruited drummer Jesse Ingelevics, and formed Alexisonfire. The band&#x27;s name was derived from Alexis Fire, a pornographic actress. When Fire discovered that they were using her website name as their band name, she threatened to sue, but it was discovered that the moniker was not registered, and no further action took place.

In 2002, the band released its first EP, &quot;Math Sheets Demo&quot;, so named because the CD was wrapped in Jesse Ingelevics&#x27; math homework. This caught the attention of recording engineer Greg Below and Montreal journalist Mitch Joel, who were setting up the record label Distort Entertainment and were looking for artists. Below was also working with EMI, which allowed the band to record at the company&#x27;s in-house studio, and land a co-publishing and distribution deal.

On October 31, 2002, &quot;Alexisonfire&quot; was released. Although there was a distribution deal with EMI, the album&#x27;s success was mostly attributed to word-of-mouth. They had already been playing dates in Ontario and New York with bands like GWAR, Juliana Theory and Glassjaw; 2003 saw them touring in support of the album, crossing Canada twice, playing with Spitalfield and Billy Talent, appearing at Hellfest, and touring Europe with Rise Against.

In October 2005, &quot;Alexisonfire&quot; was certified gold in Canada, marking over 50,000 sales. (In 2014, Dine Alone Records released a remastered version of the album.)

At the 2004 Canadian Independent Music Awards, the video for the album&#x27;s song &quot;Pulmonary Archery&quot; won Best Video. They were named Favourite Indie Band at the CASBY Awards, and the video for the song &quot;Counterparts and Number Them&quot; was nominated for Best Independent Video at the MuchMusic Video Awards.

===&quot;Watch Out!&quot; (2004–2005)===
Alexisonfire recorded their second album with Julius Butty at his Silo Studios near Hamilton, Ontario, &quot;Watch Out!&quot; and was released on June 29, 2004. It was released worldwide, mainly through Distort but through Equal Vision Records in the USA, and Sorepoint Records in the UK. It debuted at No. 6 on the Nielsen Soundscan Top 200, sold 6,000 copies in its first week, received gold certification in Canada in twelve weeks, and certified platinum in 2007. The critical reception came from the fact that the band was more focused from the eighteen months of touring, helping them harness more aggression, release more emotion, and fine-tune all the tracks. The album was noted as a real departure from their debut album, and was a critical success.

As soon as the album was released, the band went on tour, playing the Vans Warped Tour on several US dates, and then heading to the UK, playing the Reading and Leeds Festivals and other British gigs. (While playing Glasgow with Johnny Truant and The Blood Roses in, the members of all three bands had the word &quot;Yeti&quot; tattooed on themselves. On an episode of the MuchMusic program &quot;The New Music&quot;, Pettit and Green said that the idea for the tattoos came from the 1988 Gary Oldman film &quot;The Firm&quot;.) The band spent all of 2005 on the road, touring the UK, US, Canada and Europe. They also played the Summer Sonic Festival in Japan.

On June 14, 2005, Alexisonfire posted a statement on their website stating that founding drummer Jesse Ingelevics had left the band. He was replaced by Jordan Hastings, late of the band Jersey.

At the MuchMusic Video Awards, the video for the song &quot;Accidents&quot; won Best Independent Video, and the band was nominated for the Peoples&#x27; Choice Award – Favourite Canadian Group. At the Juno Awards of 2005, Alexisonfire won the award for New Group of the Year.

===&quot;Crisis&quot; (2006–2007)===

On August 22, 2006, the band released their third studio album, &quot;Crisis&quot;, which received rave reviews and continues to be deemed &#x27;important&#x27;.

The album&#x27;s release was marked with a party on a boat on the River Thames in London, England. This also launched a 10-month world tour that took them through the UK, Australia, Canada and the US. They were now playing to crowds of up to 80,000 people, at the Reading and Leeds Festivals, Festival d&#x27;été de Québec, and they headlined at the Brixton Academy in London. They played the Warped Tour, the Taste of Chaos tour, the Saints &amp; Sinners Festival and Australia&#x27;s Soundwave festival. At this point, they were one of the most popular bands in Canada.

The band toured with Anti-Flag, Saosin, The Bled, Norma Jean, Every Time I Die, Cancer Bats, Attack in Black, Moneen, Envy on the Coast, A Change of Pace, The Ghost of a Thousand and The Dear &amp; Departed, among others.
At this time, Pettit told a reporter: &quot;The next record, I think, is us pretty much wanting to put the knife in screamo. I don&#x27;t want to be the band that saves it, I want to be the band that kills it.&quot; Pettit later regretted making the statement.

At the 2006 CASBY Awards, &quot;Crisis&quot; won Favorite New Indie Release. At the 2007 MuchMusic Video Awards, the video for &quot;This Could Be Anywhere in the World&quot; won the award for Best Cinematography and was nominated for Best Rock Video. The band was also nominated for the Peoples&#x27; Choice Award – Favourite Canadian Group. At the Juno Awards of 2007, &quot;Crisis&quot; garnered a nomination for CD/DVD Artwork Design of the Year, Julius Butty received a Producer of the Year nomination for &quot;This Could Be Anywhere in the World&quot;, and Alexisonfire was nominated for Group of the Year.

===&quot;Old Crows/Young Cardinals&quot; and &quot;Dog&#x27;s Blood&quot; (2008–2010)===
In 2008, MacNeil told a &quot;Bombshell Zine&quot; interviewer: &quot;Alexis hasn&#x27;t broken up, but we&#x27;ll see what happens. We are at a crossroads now.&quot; As a result, by 2009, rumours that Alexisonfire was about to break up abounded, but the band announced the name of their new album on February 1. They began recording &quot;Old Crows/Young Cardinals&quot; on the same day. By March 1, the recording process was near completion and two songs were announced--&quot;Midnight Regulations&quot; and &quot;Emerald St.&quot; On March 31, 2009, it was confirmed that Alexisonfire had signed to Dine Alone Records, whose founder, Joel Carriere, had once been the band&#x27;s manager.

On April 20, Alexisonfire released the song &quot;Young Cardinals&quot; for radio airplay. The music video premiered on MuchOnDemand on May 15, 2009; the album was released on June 23, 2009, and was very well received.

The band then went on a 300-date tour through Europe, the US and Canada, which lasted through December 2010.

In 2008, Dallas Green told Canoe.ca that he had sketched out new songs that he hoped would take the band into &quot;new, weird territories&quot;. These songs would become the four-track EP &quot;Dogs Blood&quot;, which was released in 2010. The band announced the release of &quot;Dogs Blood&quot; at the 2009 Verge Awards, hosted by The Verge (XM), where &quot;Old Crows/Young Cardinals&quot; was nominated for Album of the Year and the band was nominated as Artist of the Year. At the Juno Awards of 2010, &quot;Old Crows/Young Cardinals&quot; was nominated as Rock Album of the Year.

On February 16, 2010, the band was set to play a free all-ages show at the 2010 Winter Olympics venue Live City Yaletown when, seconds into the show, the rush of the audience broke a barrier and people were trampled; 20 were slightly injured. Alexisonfire returned to Vancouver later that year as headliners at the PNE Forum.

Also in 2010, the band released a collection of six songs available exclusively through iTunes as a digital download. The EP, &quot;iTunes Originals&quot;, contained previously-recorded material from the group&#x27;s discography, versions of some of their previously released songs performed slightly differently, and interviews with the band. On November 22, 2010, a digital version of their &quot;Aussie Tour 7&quot;&quot; was released on iTunes. It contains two cover songs, originally by Midnight Oil and The Saints.

===Disbandment and farewell tour (2011–2012)===

In 2005, Dallas Green had launched a solo folk/rock side project called City and Colour. The project had become very successful and between that and his commitments to Alexisonfire, he said that he suffered a nervous breakdown and that being in Alexisonfire was killing him. At the end of the &quot;Old Crows/Young Cardinals&quot; tour, Green told the band that he was leaving Alexisonfire, but that he would not announce his departure until the rest of the band decided on their future plans.

On February 14, 2011, Alexisonfire tweeted that they had been writing new music for their fifth studio album, describing it as &quot;so heavy it&#x27;s going to make &quot;Dog&#x27;s Blood&quot; look like a ska record&quot;. Despite these statements, the album did not materialize and on August 5, 2011, Alexisonfire announced their break-up. In the statement, George Pettit cited the departures of both Green and MacNeil (who left to become the vocalist for Gallows), and personal issues among the remaining members as reasons for breaking up. Pettit also described the break-up as not being &quot;amicable&quot;. Alexisonfire planned on celebrating their tenth anniversary with one last headlining Canadian tour and &quot;a series of releases&quot;, although Green had specifically said that, for him, their December 19, 2010, show in their hometown was their last concert.

In July 2012, Green stated he had been in contact with other ex-Alexisonfire members, and that he and MacNeil had been &quot;starting to talk about doing some final [Alexisonfire] shows, because when we did play our last show nobody knew it was our last show.&quot; In December 2012, Alexisonfire embarked on their farewell tour. It was initially nine dates, but it expanded to 30, with stops in Canada, the UK, Australia and Brazil. In December, the EP &quot;Death Letter&quot; was released, featuring new interpretations of songs spanning the band&#x27;s previous four albums.

On December 25, 2013, the band released a limited-edition vinyl box set containing all the four albums as well as EPs, LPs, B-sides etc. One thousand copies were produced; they were sold out in 30 minutes. In August 2014, they released a slightly smaller second edition of the boxed set.

===Reunion and &quot;Otherness&quot; (2015–present)===

On March 9, 2015, the band announced a reunion tour, their first since their farewell tour in 2012, including dates at Reading and Leeds festivals, Sonic Boom, Heavy Montréal, X-Fest and Riot Fest. On September 19, 2015, at Riot Fest in Toronto, Wade MacNeil announced on stage that the band was officially back. The band later clarified this statement, reaffirming they had &quot;no immediate plans&quot; regarding new music or tours together, however they&#x27;ve played 100 concerts since 2015.

On February 12, 2016, the band released &quot;Live at Copps&quot;, a recording of their performance on December 30, 2012, at the Copps Coliseum in Hamilton, Ontario, which was the last show of their 2012 farewell tour. The album was released for download through iTunes, as well as in a special 4-record set, and as a Blu-ray video.

On June 22, 2016, Alexisonfire was announced as the main headliner for the 2017 Unify Gathering in Victoria, Australia, and announced a tour with The Dirty Nil, Behind Crimson Eyes and The Getaway Plan through Australia and New Zealand. The band was then announced as a headliner at the annual Quebec festival Montebello Rock and, on February 27, 2017, the band made a surprise three-song appearance at the Toronto stop of Billy Talent&#x27;s Afraid of Heights Tour. They played Toronto&#x27;s Danforth Music Hall in December 2017, and spent the following June touring Germany and the UK before heading back to Canada to play the Festival d&#x27;été de Québec.

On February 1, 2019, the band posted a black image on their Facebook page. Later in the day, the band posted a teaser video featuring a building with a green neon light spelling out the words &quot;Familiar Drugs&quot;. Later, on February 12, 2019, the band posted 3 illusive black pictures on their Instagram page. Fans soon figured out that by changing the brightness and contrast on these black pictures, it revealed the numbers 2,15 and 19. On February 15, 2019, the band released a new song called &quot;Familiar Drugs&quot;, their first new material in nearly nine years. On April 16, 2019, the band released the music video for &quot;Familiar Drugs,&quot; which was shot completely on VHS and cellphones.

On May 24, 2019, the band released another standalone single called &quot;Complicit&quot;, followed by &quot;Season of the Flood&quot;, on January 13, 2020.

Alexisonfire went out on a short tour in 2019, playing shows in London, New York City, Los Angeles and Toronto as well as a show at Ottawa Bluesfest. This was followed by 2020 performances in Winnipeg, Edmonton, Calgary, Vancouver and Seattle.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the band hosted a special one-time watch party on YouTube, showing a filmed performance of the final show on their farewell tour in December 2012 in Hamilton, Canada. Starting before the livestream was the premiere of their music video for their song, &quot;Season of the Flood&quot;, which is made up of footage shot exclusively by AOF concertgoers in Winnipeg, Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver during the tour in January.

In an interview with the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; in 2019, George Pettit revealed that, in 2015, he had become a professional firefighter and that, even though the band had reunited, that new career would be his priority. He also remains the lead singer in his side project, Dead Tired.
Wade MacNeil continues as the lead singer for Black Lungs and Gallows. On May 21, 2021, MacNeil presented his latest project, Doom’s Children with his first single and video, &quot;Flower Moon&quot;.
Jordan Hastings continues with his long-time side project, Cunter.
Dallas Green has continued on with City and Colour, and with You+Me, his collaboration with Pink.

In a June 2021 interview, Green stated that Alexisonfire was &quot;trying to get all these new songs together for the first time in like ten years&quot; implying that more new music was in the works. On March 10, 2022, the band announced their fifth studio album &quot;Otherness&quot;, their first album of new studio recordings in thirteen years. It was released on June 24, 2022. The album won the Juno Award for Rock Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2023. The band opened for Blink-182 in Toronto on August 15, 2024.

==Musical style and legacy==
The band describes their music as &quot;the sound of two Catholic high-school girls in mid-knife-fight&quot;; in 2004, then-drummer Jesse Ingelevics described their sound as &quot;Mogwai meets Sunny Day Real Estate&quot;. Others have described their music as post-hardcore, emo, melodic hardcore, and screamo. The band members originally bonded over the myriad punk rock styles that their hometown scene consisted of, including moshcore, screamo, youth crew, crust punk and emo. Their music is unique for its use of three main vocalists: one clean (Green), one unclean (Pettit) and one serving as a combination of the two (MacNeil). Their 2009 album &quot;Old Crows / Young Cardinals&quot; saw a more prominent overall use of clean vocals, with Pettit also providing further clean vocals, having occasionally done so on &quot;Crisis&quot;. The band&#x27;s first two albums include occasional spoken word vocals, also performed by Pettit.

The band have cited influenced including Saetia, Refused, Fucked Up, Moneen, Quicksand, Planes Mistaken for Stars, the Misfits, Tears for Fears, Hot Water Music, Elliott, the Appleseed Cast, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Alice in Chains, Jeff Buckley, Leonard Cohen and Slint.

Alexisonfire has been cited as an influence by bands such as Cancer Bats, Silverstein, Four Year Strong and 36 Crazyfists. &quot;Revolver&quot; Magazine additionally cited them as influencing the majority of the mid-2000s post-hardcore scene. Liam Cormier, lead vocalist of Cancer Bats, stated &quot;everyone will always remember Alexisonfire and Billy Talent as the two bands that brought heavy music to the forefront and broke that scene wide open in this country.&quot; The band has also been well-regarded for their live performances throughout the years. Ex-frontman of Grade, Kyle Bishop, credited them for this in an interview with &quot;The Grid TO&quot;. &quot;Previous to them, Canadian content was pretty lame, palatable stuff,&quot; he said. &quot;Then you had Alexis come in, George shredding his larynx and smashing his face against the wall. They destroyed everything. And a lot of people gravitated to that, and I&#x27;ve never seen that happen in Canada before. They opened up the door for a lot of bands to be appreciated, and brought a whole new group of people into punk rock.&quot; In an article for &quot;Exclaim!&quot;, Ian Gormely praised the band for &quot;opening doors for like-minded artists steeped in Southern Ontario&#x27;s potent punk and metal scenes,&quot; and as having an &quot;enduring influence in Canadian rock, and aggressive music in general&quot;.

<doc id="897507" wikidata="Q932852" url="?curid=897507" title="Masters of Reality">
<text>Masters of Reality is an American rock band formed in 1981 by frontman Chris Goss and guitarist Tim Harrington in Syracuse, New York, United States. They took the name for the band from a misprinted label of the third Black Sabbath album, &quot;Master of Reality&quot;. Goss has remained the only constant band member. Since the release of their self-titled debut album in 1989, Masters of Reality has released six studio albums so far.

The band&#x27;s music has touched on many styles, ranging from hard rock to blues, from progressive rock to Beatlesque pop music. The band is sometimes associated with the &quot;Palm Desert Scene&quot;, which includes bands like Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age and many other stoner rock and &quot;desert rock&quot; bands.

==History==
Frontman Chris Goss started out with a band covering heavy 1970s rock acts (New York Dolls, Aerosmith, David Bowie, Blue Öyster Cult, Alice Cooper, Led Zeppelin) and writing his own songs since circa 1975. After getting into punk rock for a while (performing at CBGB in 1978), he didn&#x27;t play guitar for a few years, instead preferring electronic music like Kraftwerk and becoming a club DJ.

In 1981 Goss and Tim Harrington started to make experimental home recordings with lo-fi, cheap and/or borrowed equipment that included a Sanyo boombox Rhythm Ace drum machine, a Korg, synthesizers and a Fender Vibroverb amp. The rhythm tracks of synths and a beat recorded on cassette would be played back to &quot;overdub&quot; vocals, guitar, more synthesizers, et cetera. They considered Manson Family as a name for their act, but never actually used it for their performances. They played regularly at CBGB with a sound reminiscent of Suicide or somewhat like how Nine Inch Nails or Marilyn Manson would sound in the 1990s.

Early original songs included &quot;Building the Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Voodoo Doll&quot;, &quot;Metal Entity&quot;, &quot;Cash&quot;, &quot;Anchor&quot;, &quot;Stones in Every Field&quot; and &quot;Doraldina&#x27;s Prophecies&quot;.

Masters of Reality grew into a four-piece with the addition of Googe (bass) and Vinnie Ludovico (drums) and developed a sound with less electronics and more heavy blues rock with influences like Black Sabbath, Cream, Led Zeppelin and King Crimson. A demo tape reached producer Rick Rubin who went to see a live show in late 1986 and then signed the band to Def Jam. Rubin brought out the blues rock character of the band Rubin quit Def Jam but took the band with him to his new Def American label, before their self-titled debut album was eventually released in 1989.

The band appears briefly in the 1990 film &quot;Marked for Death&quot; (starring Steven Seagal).

Goss got frustrated with the band while touring the debut album. He quit the tour after Matt Dike invited him to come to Los Angeles and to get signed to his Delicious Vinyl label. They bought the rights from Rubin and released a newly sequenced version of the album with &quot;Doraldina&#x27;s Prophecies&quot; as an extra track.

In 1992 Goss and Googe resurfaced, now with Ginger Baker (formerly of Cream) on drums. The new album &quot;Sunrise on the Sufferbus&quot; spawned a Top 10 rock chart hit with the single &quot;She Got Me (When She Got Her Dress On)&quot;. An album cut sometimes used by American radio shows when they have a British guest is &quot;T.U.S.A.&quot;, a rap by Baker describing the inability of Americans to make a proper cup of tea. Baker left the band after a few years and was replaced by Victor Indrizzo (of Circus of Power and Samiam).

Masters of Reality recorded the song &quot;Climb Inside My World&quot; for a 1994 &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; episode entitled &quot;Jerry the Bellybutton Elf&quot;. The song was written by Steve Mellor who also wrote the episode in which it appeared.

Masters of Reality recorded a full studio album entitled &quot;The Ballad of Jody Frosty&quot; for Epic that was scheduled to be released in 1995, but it was shelved. One song appeared on the live album &quot;How High the Moon&quot; (1997) and some of the studio recordings were released on &quot;Give Us Barabbas&quot; (2004). The full album was eventually leaked online in 2004.

Masters of Reality were quiet for several years as Goss was occupied producing music for other bands. However, the band did appear at Johnny Depp&#x27;s Viper Room night club in 1997 for a two-night stand, and a resultant live album, &quot;How High the Moon&quot; featured Stone Temple Pilots vocalist Scott Weiland on &quot;Jindalee Jindalie&quot;.

In 1999 the band released &quot; Welcome to the Western Lodge&quot;. Goss&#x27; connection to Queens of the Stone Age resulted in the collaborative album &quot;Deep in the Hole&quot; in 2001, and two years later, in the release of the subsequent live album &quot;Flak &#x27;n&#x27; Flight&quot;.

In 2003, the band covered the song &quot;Devil&#x27;s Radio&quot; for the album &quot;Songs from the Material World: A Tribute to George Harrison&quot;.

The band released its fifth album, &quot;Give Us Barabbas&quot;, in 2004, a collection of lost tracks opening with the &quot;Ballad of Jody Frosty&quot;.

On August 24, 2009, the band released &quot;Pine/Cross Dover&quot;.

Masters of Reality&#x27;s seventh album, and its first in 16 years, &quot;The Archer&quot;, is due for release on April 11, 2025.

<doc id="897521" wikidata="Q3322869" url="?curid=897521" title="Palm Desert Scene">
<text>The Palm Desert Scene is a group of related bands and musicians from Palm Desert, California. Their hard rock sound – sometimes described as desert rock – contains elements of heavy metal, psychedelia, blues, punk, alternative, grunge, and other genres. It often features distinctive repetitive drum beats, a propensity for free-form jamming, and &quot;trance-like&quot; or &quot;sludgy&quot; grooves. The involved musicians often play in multiple bands simultaneously, and there is a high rate of collaboration between bands. The Palm Desert Scene is also notable for fostering stoner rock pioneers Kyuss. The term &quot;stoner rock&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with the term &quot;desert rock&quot;. However, not all Palm Desert scene bands are &quot;stoner rock&quot; and not all stoner rock bands sound exactly like those in Palm Desert. Palm Desert has been named by &quot;Blender&quot; magazine as &quot;one of the top seven rock n&#x27; roll cities in America&quot;.

==History==
The scene evolved from various Palm Desert bands&#x27; (especially Yawning Man&#x27;s) marijuana-driven instrumental jam sessions in the desert. It is largely known for its heavy, grinding riffs and association with the use of illicit substances, particularly marijuana, peyote, LSD, and magic mushrooms. These jam sessions inevitably contained some psychedelic rock influences.

Palm Desert bands built a large local following by frequently performing at bars and parties in and around the isolated towns of Southern California&#x27;s desert areas. The band Kyuss, specifically, performed shows at desert parties known as &quot;generator parties&quot;. These shows consisted of small crowds of people partying in the desert, beer drinking, drugs, and the use of gasoline-powered generators to provide electricity for the musical equipment. Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age member Josh Homme commented that playing in the desert &quot;was the shaping factor for [Kyuss]&quot;, noting that &quot;there&#x27;s no clubs here, so you can only play for free. If people don&#x27;t like you, they&#x27;ll tell you. You can&#x27;t suck.&quot;

==The Desert Sessions==

One project within this scene are the Desert Sessions, in which Josh Homme invites a group of musicians, most of whom are from the Palm Desert scene, to Rancho De La Luna, a studio in the desert, where they write, rehearse and record some 10 songs in one week&#x27;s time. The songs are recorded and then never played again by the same lineup, though a number of Desert Sessions songs have later been covered on albums by Queens of the Stone Age and become part of the QOTSA live repertoire. The Desert Sessions series has now yielded 12 volumes, which have been released in pairs on CD but individually in 10&quot; vinyl EP format. Though the series is commonly associated with the Palm Desert Scene, not all artists in the scene have participated, and there have been other artists to contribute to the project who are clearly not from the scene, such as John McBain of Red Bank, New Jersey&#x27;s Monster Magnet, Dean Ween of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Ween and England&#x27;s PJ Harvey.

<doc id="897526" wikidata="Q6504003" url="?curid=897526" title="Lawrence Dundas, 1st Earl of Zetland">
<text>Lawrence Dundas, 1st Earl of Zetland (10 April 1766 – 19 February 1839) was a British politician and peer who sat in the House of Commons from 1790 to 1820 when he was raised to the peerage of the United Kingdom.

== Early life ==
Dundas was the son of Thomas Dundas, 1st Baron Dundas and was born in Westminster on 10 April 1766. He was educated at Harrow and was admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge. He married Harriot Hale, one of the twenty-one children of General John Hale and his wife Mary Chaloner, by whom he had three sons and four daughters.

==Military career==
In 1789 Dundas was commissioned as a Captain in the disembodied North York Militia, of which his father was Lieutenant-Colonel. The regiment was embodied for full-time service on the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War, and Dundas was promoted to Major in 1795. In the frequent absences of the Colonel, Earl Fauconberg, and his father on parliamentary business, Dundas was often left in command of the regiment on its coast defence duties. When Fauconberg resigned the command on grounds of ill-health in 1797 Lord Dundas was appointed colonel and Major Lawrence Dundas was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. The regiment was disembodied after the Treaty of Amiens in 1802, but was re-embodied in 1803 when the peace broke down. However, Dundas resigned to become Lt-Col Commandant of the new Cleveland Volunteers on 24 October 1803. After an initial burst of enthusiasm, the volunteers declined and were replaced in 1808 by units of Local Militia raised under compulsory service. Dundas was commissioned as Lt-Col Commandant of the 3rd North York Local Militia on 24 September 1808. The Local Militia was disbanded in 1816.

==Political career==
Dundas was elected Whig Member of Parliament for Richmond, North Yorkshire in 1790. Twelve years later he exchanged this seat for that of York, and in 1808 returned to Westminster as representative for his old Richmond seat. In 1811 he was again elected MP for York, and became Lord Mayor of the city that same year, having been an alderman since 1808. He was Lord Mayor a second time in 1821.

In 1820 Dundas succeeded his father as second Baron Dundas and as a baronet. He was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Orkney and Shetland in 1831, and in 1838, on the occasion of the coronation of Queen Victoria, he was created Earl of Zetland (i.e. Shetland) for having provided financial assistance to the new Queen&#x27;s parents, the Duke &amp; Duchess of Kent, in the years preceding her accession.

==Slave holder==

According to the &quot;Legacies of British Slave-Ownership&quot; at the University College London, Zetland was awarded compensation in the aftermath of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 with the Slave Compensation Act 1837. 

Zetland was associated with &quot;T71/880 Grenada claim no. 604 (Dougalston Estate)&quot; and &quot;T71/881 Dominica claim no. 576A &amp; B (Castle Bruce)&quot;, he owned 351 slaves in Grenada and Dominica and received a £8,135 payment at the time (worth £ in 2025).

==Later life and legacy==
Dundas&#x27;s wife died in 1834. He died suddenly on 19 February 1839 at his home of Aske Hall, Yorkshire. He was succeeded by his eldest son Thomas Dundas, 2nd Earl of Zetland.

He is buried in the family vault at Trinity Church in central Falkirk.

The only ones who may be presented in the second round of balloting shall be the two candidates who shall have received the greatest number of votes in the first round. In case of the withdrawal of one or both of the two candidates, the next ones shall be presented in the order of their filing after the first balloting.

The candidate having received the relative majority of votes cast in the second round shall be declared elected.

The convocation of the electors shall be made by a decree issued in the Council of Ministers.

The first round of balloting for the election of the President of the Republic shall take place at least thirty days and at most forty days before the expiration date of the powers of the President in office.

The mandate of the new President of the Republic shall take effect by counting from the expiration date of the mandate of his predecessor.

===Oath of office===
Before taking his office, the President of the Republic shall take the following oath:

This oath shall be received by the President of the Constitutional Court before the National Assembly and the Supreme Court.

===Vacancy===
In case of vacancy of the Presidency of the Republic by death, resignation or permanent impediment, the National Assembly shall reconvene in order to rule on the case with an absolute majority of its members. The President of the National Assembly shall refer the matter to the Constitutional Court which shall certify it and declare the vacancy of the Presidency of the Republic. The duties of President of the Republic, with the exception of those mentioned in Articles 54 paragraph 3, 50, 60, 101, and 154 shall be temporarily exercised by the President of the National Assembly.

The election of a new President of the Republic shall take place thirty days at the least and forty days at most after the declaration of the permanent nature of the vacancy.

In case of bringing an accusation of the President of the Republic before the High Court of Justice, his interim shall be assumed by the President of the Constitutional Court who shall exercise all the duties of President of the Republic with the exception of those mentioned in Articles 54 paragraph 3, 58, 60, 101 and 154.

<doc id="897529" wikidata="Q2612406" url="?curid=897529" title="Fermat curve">
<text>In mathematics, the Fermat curve is the algebraic curve in the complex projective plane defined in homogeneous coordinates (&quot;X&quot;:&quot;Y&quot;:&quot;Z&quot;) by the Fermat equation:
:formula_1

Therefore, in terms of the affine plane its equation is:
:formula_2

An integer solution to the Fermat equation would correspond to a nonzero rational number solution to the affine equation, and vice versa. But by Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem it is now known that (for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2) there are no nontrivial integer solutions to the Fermat equation; therefore, the Fermat curve has no nontrivial rational points.

The Fermat curve is non-singular and has genus:

:formula_3

This means genus 0 for the case &quot;n&quot; = 2 (a conic) and genus 1 only for &quot;n&quot; = 3 (an elliptic curve). The Jacobian variety of the Fermat curve has been studied in depth. It is isogenous to a product of simple abelian varieties with complex multiplication.

The Fermat curve also has gonality:

:formula_4

==Fermat varieties==
Fermat-style equations in more variables define as projective varieties the Fermat varieties.

<doc id="897536" wikidata="Q957824" url="?curid=897536" title="Ed Schieffelin">
<text>Edward Lawrence Schieffelin (1847–1897) was an American prospector and Indian Scout who discovered silver in the Arizona Territory, an event that led to the founding of Tombstone. He entered into a partnership with his brother Al and mining engineer Richard Gird in a handshake deal that produced millions of dollars in wealth for all three men. During the course of Tombstone&#x27;s mining history, about in silver was produced from its mines.

== Early life ==

Schieffelin was born in a coal-mining region of Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, the son of a prominent New York and Pennsylvania family, in 1847. His great-grandfather Jacob Schieffelin, Sr., born in 1757, joined the Loyalist army and served as Henry Hamilton&#x27;s secretary during the Revolutionary War. Schieffelin was captured in 1779 and held prisoner in Williamsburg, Virginia. He escaped to Canada, where in 1780 he was appointed a lieutenant in the Queen&#x27;s Rangers by Henry Clinton. He spent time in Montreal and Detroit, before returning to New York, where in 1794 he founded a drug company with his brother Lawrence. This firm still exists as a liquor import house, Schieffelin &amp; Somerset. Jacob&#x27;s wife, Hannah Lawrence, was a descendant of Quaker colonial religious pioneer John Bowne, Elizabeth Fones, and the Winthrop family of New England.

In January 1849, Jacob, Jr. traveled to California with his sons Alfred and Edward Girard on the ship &quot;Morrison&quot;. They arrived in September, but almost immediately booked passage home via Panama in November. Jacob Schieffelin, Jr. traveled overland and joined his brother and Ed. Schieffelin&#x27;s father Clinton Emanuel Del Pela Schieffelin settled in the Rogue Valley, Oregon Territory, in the mid-1850s to raise cattle, grain and children. The family maintained an interest in the mining activities in the area.

== Hunt for gold and silver ==

At age 17, Schieffelin set out on his own as a prospector and miner. He began looking for gold and silver in about 1865. From Oregon, he went east to Coeur d&#x27;Alene, then searched across Nevada into Death Valley, back into Colorado and then New Mexico.

In 1876, David P. Lansing of Phoenix, Arizona, described Schieffelin as &quot;about the strangest specimen of human flesh I ever saw. He was tall and had black hair that hung several inches below his shoulder and a beard that had not been trimmed or combed for so long a time that it was a mass of unkempt knots and mats. He wore clothing pieced and patched from deerskins, corduroy and flannel, and his hat was originally a slouch hat that had been pieced with rabbit skin until very little of the original felt remained.&quot;

A year later as a 30-year-old, Schieffelin moved to California to find gold. He surveyed the Grand Canyon area as well. Unsuccessful, he heard that a group of Hualapai Indians had enlisted as scouts for the U.S. Army, which was establishing a camp to counter the Chiricahua Apache threat and to secure the nearby border with Mexico. The Army established Camp Huachuca at the foot of the Huachuca Mountains in Pima County, Arizona Territory on March 3, 1877. Silver had already been discovered in some northern areas of Arizona Territory, but the southern portion had been under continued Apache attack.

Schieffelin accompanied the scouts on a few trips into the back country while prospecting part-time. He finally decided to stay put and explore the hills east full-time. The hills east of the San Pedro River where he prospected could be dangerous. They were only about from the hostile Chiricahua Apache Indians led by Cochise, Geronimo and Victorio that had established a stronghold in the Dragoon Mountains.

=== Ore discovery ===

Frederick Brunckow, a Prussian-born mining engineer, discovered silver in the hills of Cochise County in 1858. He built a cabin near the San Pedro River after finding a small silver deposit nearby. He hired three other white men and about a dozen Mexican miners. In September 1860, two of the white men were robbed and murdered at the cabin and Brunckow was found dead in the mine with a rock drill through him. The German cook blamed the Mexican workers for the murders. After Brunckow&#x27;s death, ongoing conflict with native Indians prevented further development of the mines for several years. Brunckow&#x27;s San Pedro mine influenced Ed Schieffelin to prospect the rocky outcropping northeast of the cabin. In 1876, Schieffelin and his party were attacked by Apaches, and a man named Lenox was killed. The cabin was the site of 22 murders during the frontier days.

When friend and fellow army scout Al Sieber learned what Schieffelin was up to, he is quoted as telling him, &quot;The only rock you will find out there will be your own tombstone&quot;. Another account reported Schieffelin&#x27;s friends told him, &quot;Better take your coffin with you; you will find your tombstone there, and nothing else.&quot;

In 1877, Schieffelin used Brunckow&#x27;s cabin as a base of operations to survey the country. After many months, Ed was working the hills east of the San Pedro River when he found pieces of silver ore in a dry wash on a high plateau called Goose Flats. It took him several more months to find the source. When he located the vein, he estimated the vein to be long and wide. Schieffelin&#x27;s claim was sited near Lenox&#x27;s grave site, and when he filed his first mining claim on September 21, 1877, he fittingly named his stake &quot;Tombstone&quot;.

Flat broke, Schieffelin persuaded William Griffith to pay for the legal paperwork required to file a mining claim on September 3, 1877. Tucson did not have an assay office, and when they showed the sample ore to some local men, they thought it was worthless.

With only 30 cents in his pocket, Schieffelin set out to find his brother Al, whom he had not seen in four years. He believed Al was working the Silver King mine, about to the north in central Arizona Territory near present-day Globe. But Schieffelin learned that Al had moved on to the McCracken Mine in Signal City, Arizona, another north. Schieffelin spent his 30 cents on tobacco and had to pause in his search for his brother to earn enough money to go on. He found a job as a hoist operator at the Champion silver mine, and for fourteen days hauled up a dozen tons of ore every night by cranking a hand windlass.

=== Partnership formed ===


When Ed finally located his brother in February 1878, Al asked the foreman at the McCracken mine to look at brother Ed&#x27;s ore specimens. The foreman thought the samples were mostly lead. Unconvinced, Schieffelin showed the samples to 20 or 30 others who had some expertise, and they all thought the ore worthless. Frustrated, Schieffelin threw his ore specimens out his brother&#x27;s cabin door, as far as he could throw, but at the last minute held on to three of them. For the next four weeks he worked in the McCracken Mine, wielding a pick and shovel.

Ed learned about the McCracken Mine&#x27;s recently arrived assayer, Richard Gird, who had a reputation as an expert. Taking his last three ore samples, Ed Schieffelin asked Gird if he thought they were worth assaying. Gird took a look and said he&#x27;d get back to Ed. Three days later, Al shook Ed out of his bunk and said Gird wanted to see him now. When they met, Gird told Ed that he valued the best of the ore samples at $2,000 a ton. Ed, Al Schieffelin and Richard Gird formed a partnership on the spot. Gird offered his expertise, connections, and a grubstake. They shook hands on their three-way deal, a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement that was never put down on paper but that resulted in millions of dollars of wealth for all three men. When Richard resigned, his employer offered to make him general superintendent of the mine, but he declined.

Gird bought a second-hand blue spring wagon and loaded it with supplies, his assay equipment, and also bought a second mule that with Ed&#x27;s mule could haul the wagon. Gird wanted time to wind up his affairs and to wait for spring and better weather, but Ed insisted they depart immediately. Al hesitated to leave his well-paid, $4.00 a day job as a miner. Ed and Gird didn&#x27;t wait for him, but left that day. Al reconsidered and joined them that night. Reaching Arizona Territory, and despite reports of continued Apache raids and the murder of miners and ranchers in the area, the three men returned to Cochise County and set up camp at the Brunckow cabin. The deaths of several locals at the hands of the Apache Indians were testified to by the fresh graves near the cabin.
The three partners formed the Tombstone Gold and Silver Mining Company to hold title to their claims. Gird built a crude assay furnace in the cabin&#x27;s fireplace. He found that Schieffelin&#x27;s initial find of silver ore was valuable, but within a few weeks of mining the vein, Ed discovered it ended in a pinch about three feet deep. His brother Al and Gird were despondent, but Ed was optimistic he could find more ore deposits. He continued his search for many more weeks until one day Al found Ed joyously exclaiming over another sample of float ore he had found. Indifferently, Al told Ed he was a &quot;lucky cuss,&quot; and that became the name of one of the richest mining claims in the Tombstone District. The ore samples assayed at $15,000 a ton. Ed shortly afterward identified another claim, the &quot;Tough Nut&quot; lode, rich in horn silver.

On June 17, 1879, Schieffelin showed up in Tucson driving the blue spring wagon carrying the first load of silver bullion valued at $18,744 (about $ today)

=== Tombstone founded ===
When the first claims were filed, the initial settlement of tents and cabins was located at Watervale near the Lucky Cuss mine. By March 1879, about 100 residents occupied tents and shacks at Watervale. Former Territorial Governor Anson P.K. Safford offered financial backing for a cut of the men&#x27;s mining claims, and Ed Schieffelin, his brother Al, and their partner Richard Gird formed the Tombstone Mining and Milling Company and built a stamping mill. On March 5, 1879, U.S. Deputy Mineral Surveyor Solon M. Allis finished laying out a new town site on a mesa named Goose Flats at , to top of the Tough Nut mine, and large enough to hold a growing town. The town was named &quot;Tombstone&quot; after Schieffelin&#x27;s initial mining claim. The shelters at Watervale were relocated to the new town site and a scattering of cabins and tents was quickly built for about 100 residents.

During the first few months of mining, the upper portion of the Tombstone mining district was accidentally discovered by Ed Williams and Jack Friday. Late one night, their mules broke loose and dragging their chain, left the miners&#x27; dry camp for water along an Indian trail. The men tracked the mules&#x27; chain trail all the way to the Schieffelin camp. Williams and Friday noticed a bright gleam where the iron had dragged across bare rock. They filed a claim for their find, but Al and Ed Schieffelin and Richard Gird contested their claim, asserting it violated their earlier claims. When the two parties finally resolved their arguments and counterclaims, they agreed to divide the ground. Williams and Friday took the higher end, which they called the Grand Central, and the Schieffelin company took the lower end, which they named the Contention in remembrance of the quarrel that led to its founding. Those two mines were eventually the most profitable mines in Tombstone. Some of the ore from the &quot;Lucky Cuss&quot;, &quot;Tough Nut&quot;, and the &quot;Contention&quot; mines assayed at around $15,000 to the ton.
Ed Schieffelin preferred prospecting to running a mine and he left Tombstone to find more ore. When he returned four months later, Gird had lined up buyers for their interest in the Contention, which they sold for $10,000 to J.H. White and S. Denson, who represented W.D. Dean of San Francisco. The sellers thought the $10,000 price was exorbitant. The Grand Central and Contention claims turned out to be the richest claims in the district, producing millions of dollars in bullion. The Schieffelin company also soon sold a half-interest in the Lucky Cuss, and the other half turned into a steady stream of money.

On March 13, 1879, Al and Ed Schieffelin sold their two-thirds interest in the Tombstone Mining and Milling Company, which owned the Tough Nut mine, for US$1 million each to the Corbin brothers, Hamilton Distin of Philadelphia, and Simmons Squire of Boston. Safford became president of the new Tombstone Gold and Silver Milling and Mining Company with Richard Gird as superintendent. Ed moved on, but Al remained in Tombstone for some time longer. Gird later sold off his one-third interest for US$1 million, doubling what the Schieffelins had been paid. Gird remained in the territory, but Ed Schieffelin left to pursue other interests.

When Cochise County was formed in February 1881, Tombstone became the county seat. In 1881, early in Tombstone&#x27;s rapid growth, Ed&#x27;s brother Al built Schieffelin Hall as a theater, recital hall, and a meeting place for Tombstone citizens. His great-niece Mary Schieffelin Brady reopened it in 1964 and it remains an attraction in Tombstone. It is the largest standing adobe structure in the southwest United States.

At its height in the mid-1880s, Tombstone&#x27;s population was officially about 7,000 miners, but some estimates figure in an additional 5–7,000 women and children, Chinese, Mexicans, and prostitutes. In the late 1880s, the silver mines reached the water table and the mines eventually filled with water. Tombstone&#x27;s population faded, until tourism became its main attraction.

== Later life ==
Ed had accumulated more than $1 million in wealth as a result of the silver boom. While he had maintained a casual appearance, including long hair and beard, he cleaned himself up. He traveled to New York City, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and other cities. He met many distinguished people. Ever restless, over the next 20 years Ed showed up at nearly every boom town in the West.

Schieffelin had made a practice of studying maps and believed there was a great &quot;continental belt&quot; of mineral wealth that extended from South America through Mexico, the United States, and British Columbia. During 1882, Ed prepared for what he planned to be a three-year survey of mineral wealth. He began the expedition with his brother Al and three others on a trip up the Yukon River. They commissioned construction of and fitted out a small, shallow draft sternwheel steamer which they named the &quot;New Packet&quot;. Schieffelin prospected during the trip in Alaska and found some specks of gold. He was for a while convinced he had found the continental belt he had been searching for. But he was extremely discouraged by the Arctic cold he experienced, up to 50 F below zero (-46 C). He decided that mining in Alaska was a lost cause and he returned to the lower 48 states.

In 1883, he returned to San Francisco, where he met Mrs. Mary E. Brown. They married the same year in La Junta, Colorado, and they spent part of the winter in Salt Lake City, Utah. In the spring of 1884, they returned to California, where Ed built a mansion for his wife across the bay from San Francisco in Alameda. They bought a home in Los Angeles that they shared with Ed&#x27;s brother Al until Al died of consumption in 1885.

== Early death ==

In 1897 Schieffelin bought a ranch near his brothers Effingham (Eff) and Jacob (Jay) outside Woodville, now Rogue River, Oregon. He continued prospecting in the Canyonville area, where he searched for gold and silver. On May 12, 1897, after he had not shown up in town for supplies for several days, his neighbor checked on him and found him face down on the floor of his miner&#x27;s cabin. The coroner ruled that he had died of a heart attack. The ore samples found in his cabin were later reported to have assayed at more than $2,000 to the ton. Other reports from his family said it was only valued at $7 per ton. Schieffelin did not leave a map or directions behind pointing to the origins of his discovery. He was initially buried near his cabin about east of Canyonville.

It was shortly afterward learned that he had requested to be buried in Tombstone. &quot;It is my wish, if convenient, to be buried in the dress of a prospector, my old pick and canteen with me, on top of the granite hills, about three miles westerly from the City of Tombstone, Arizona, and that a monument, such as prospectors build when locating a mining claim, be built over my grave.&quot; Schieffelin was interred about northwest of Tombstone, Arizona, near the dry wash in which he originally found silver ore and the later location of the Grand Central Mine. He was buried as his will specified: in mining clothes, with pick, shovel, and his old canteen. He divided his estate between his wife and his brother Jay. &quot;I give my wife, Mary E. Schieffelin, all interests, both real and personal properties—in Alameda and Santa Clara Counties, California—also fifteen $1,000 University of Arizona Bonds. All other properties, both real and personal, I give to my brother, Jay L. Schieffelin.&quot; Mary Schieffelin moved to New York City after her husband&#x27;s death.

== Legacy ==

A tall monument representing the type of marker a miner makes in claiming a strike was erected near the spot of his original claim. The plaque on it reads, &quot;Ed Shieffelin, died May 12, 1897, aged 49 years, 8 months. A dutiful son, a faithful husband, a kind brother, and a true friend.&quot; Years before, Schieffelin had written, &quot;I never wanted to be rich, I just wanted to get close to the earth and see mother nature&#x27;s gold.&quot; Schieffelin Gulch Road in the Rogue Valley, Oregon is named after the family who homesteaded there.

There are widely varying estimates of the value of gold and silver mined during the course of Tombstone&#x27;s history. In 1883, writer Patrick Hamilton estimated that during the first four years of activity the mines produced about $25,000,000 (approximately $ today). Other estimates include $40 million to $85 million (about $ to $ today). Renewed mining is planned for the area.

<text>In physics, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation, named after William Rowan Hamilton and Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, is an alternative formulation of classical mechanics, equivalent to other formulations such as Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics.

The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is a formulation of mechanics in which the motion of a particle can be represented as a wave. In this sense, it fulfilled a long-held goal of theoretical physics (dating at least to Johann Bernoulli in the eighteenth century) of finding an analogy between the propagation of light and the motion of a particle. The wave equation followed by mechanical systems is similar to, but not identical with, Schrödinger&#x27;s equation, as described below; for this reason, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation is considered the &quot;closest approach&quot; of classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. The qualitative form of this connection is called Hamilton&#x27;s optico-mechanical analogy.

In mathematics, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation is a necessary condition describing extremal geometry in generalizations of problems from the calculus of variations. It can be understood as a special case of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation from dynamic programming.

== Overview ==
The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is a first-order, non-linear partial differential equation

for a system of particles at coordinates . The function formula_1 is the system&#x27;s Hamiltonian giving the system&#x27;s energy. The solution of this equation is the &quot;action&quot;, , called &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s principal function&quot;. 
The solution can be related to the system Lagrangian formula_2 by an indefinite integral of the form used in the principle of least action:
formula_3
Geometrical surfaces of constant action are perpendicular to system trajectories, creating a wavefront-like view of the system dynamics. This property of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation connects classical mechanics to quantum mechanics.

== Mathematical formulation ==
=== Notation ===
Boldface variables such as formula_4 represent a list of formula_5 generalized coordinates,
formula_6

A dot over a variable or list signifies the time derivative (see Newton&#x27;s notation). For example,
formula_7

The dot product notation between two lists of the same number of coordinates is a shorthand for the sum of the products of corresponding components, such as
formula_8

=== The action functional (a.k.a. Hamilton&#x27;s principal function) ===
==== Definition ====
Let the Hessian matrix formula_9 be invertible. The relation
formula_10
shows that the Euler–Lagrange equations form a formula_11 system of second-order ordinary differential equations. Inverting the matrix formula_12 transforms this system into
formula_13

Let a time instant formula_14 and a point formula_15 in the configuration space be fixed. The existence and uniqueness theorems guarantee that, for every formula_16 the initial value problem with the conditions formula_17 and formula_18 has a locally unique solution formula_19 Additionally, let there be a sufficiently small time interval formula_20 such that extremals with different initial velocities formula_21 would not intersect in formula_22 The latter means that, for any formula_23 and any formula_24 there can be at most one extremal formula_25 for which formula_17 and formula_27 Substituting formula_25 into the action functional results in the Hamilton&#x27;s principal function (HPF)

{=} \int^t_{t_0} \mathcal{L}(\gamma(\tau;\cdot),\dot\gamma(\tau;\cdot),\tau)\,d\tau,&lt;/math&gt;

* formula_30
* formula_27

=== Formula for the momenta ===
The momenta are defined as the quantities formula_32 This section shows that the dependency of formula_33 on formula_34 disappears, once the HPF is known.

Indeed, let a time instant formula_14 and a point formula_36 in the configuration space be fixed. For every time instant formula_37 and a point formula_38 let formula_25 be the (unique) extremal from the definition of the Hamilton&#x27;s principal function . Call formula_40 the velocity at . Then
{\partial \dot q^i}\right|_{\mathbf{\dot q} = \mathbf{v}}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!, \quad i=1,\ldots,n.&lt;/math&gt;
|title=}}

{\partial\mathbf{q}} - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial {\cal L}}{\partial\mathbf{\dot q}}\right)\delta \xi\,dt + \frac{\partial {\cal L}}{\partial \mathbf{\dot q}}\,\delta \xi\Biggl|^{t_1}_{t_0},
&lt;/math&gt;
where one should substitute formula_41 and formula_42 after calculating the partial derivatives on the right-hand side. (This formula follows from the definition of Gateaux derivative via integration by parts).

Assume that formula_43 is an extremal. Since formula_43 now satisfies the Euler–Lagrange equations, the integral term vanishes. If formula_43&#x27;s starting point formula_36 is fixed, then, by the same logic that was used to derive the Euler–Lagrange equations, formula_47 Thus,
formula_48

Step 2. Let formula_49 be the (unique) extremal from the definition of HPF, formula_50 a vector field along formula_51 and formula_52 a variation of formula_53 &quot;compatible&quot; with formula_54 In precise terms, formula_55
formula_56 formula_57

By definition of HPF and Gateaux derivative,
formula_58

Here, we took into account that formula_59 and dropped formula_14 for compactness.

Step 3. We now substitute formula_61 and formula_62 into the expression for formula_63 from Step 1 and compare the result with the formula derived in Step 2. The fact that, for formula_64 the vector field formula_65 was chosen arbitrarily completes the proof.

=== Formula ===
Given the Hamiltonian formula_66 of a mechanical system, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation is a first-order, non-linear partial differential equation for the Hamilton&#x27;s principal function formula_67,

,t \right).&lt;/math&gt;

\mathbf{\dot q} + \frac{\partial S}{\partial t}\right]^{\mathbf{q}=\xi(t)}_{\mathbf{\dot q} = \dot\xi(t)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

From the formula for formula_68 and the coordinate-based definition of the Hamiltonian
formula_69
with formula_70 satisfying the (uniquely solvable for formula_71 equation formula_72 obtain
formula_73
where formula_74 and formula_75

Alternatively, as described below, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation may be derived from Hamiltonian mechanics by treating formula_76 as the generating function for a canonical transformation of the classical Hamiltonian
formula_77

The conjugate momenta correspond to the first derivatives of formula_67 with respect to the generalized coordinates
formula_79

As a solution to the Hamilton–Jacobi equation, the principal function contains formula_80 undetermined constants, the first formula_5 of them denoted as formula_82, and the last one coming from the integration of formula_83.

The relationship between formula_84 and formula_4 then describes the orbit in phase space in terms of these constants of motion. Furthermore, the quantities
formula_86
are also constants of motion, and these equations can be inverted to find formula_4 as a function of all the formula_88 and formula_89 constants and time.

== Comparison with other formulations of mechanics ==

The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is a &quot;single&quot;, first-order partial differential equation for the function of the formula_5 generalized coordinates formula_91 and the time formula_37. The generalized momenta do not appear, except as derivatives of formula_67, the classical action.

For comparison, in the equivalent Euler–Lagrange equations of motion of Lagrangian mechanics, the conjugate momenta also do not appear; however, those equations are a &quot;system&quot; of formula_5, generally second-order equations for the time evolution of the generalized coordinates. Similarly, Hamilton&#x27;s equations of motion are another &quot;system&quot; of 2&quot;N&quot; first-order equations for the time evolution of the generalized coordinates and their conjugate momenta formula_95.

Since the HJE is an equivalent expression of an integral minimization problem such as Hamilton&#x27;s principle, the HJE can be useful in other problems of the calculus of variations and, more generally, in other branches of mathematics and physics, such as dynamical systems, symplectic geometry and quantum chaos. For example, the Hamilton–Jacobi equations can be used to determine the geodesics on a Riemannian manifold, an important variational problem in Riemannian geometry. However as a computational tool, the partial differential equations are notoriously complicated to solve except when is it possible to separate the independent variables; in this case the HJE become computationally useful.

== Derivation using a canonical transformation ==
Any canonical transformation involving a type-2 generating function formula_96 leads to the relations
formula_97
and Hamilton&#x27;s equations in terms of the new variables formula_98 and new Hamiltonian formula_99 have the same form:
formula_100

To derive the HJE, a generating function formula_96 is chosen in such a way that, it will make the new Hamiltonian formula_102. Hence, all its derivatives are also zero, and the transformed Hamilton&#x27;s equations become trivial
formula_103
so the new generalized coordinates and momenta are &quot;constants&quot; of motion. As they are constants, in this context the new generalized momenta formula_104 are usually denoted formula_82, i.e. formula_106 and the new generalized coordinates formula_107 are typically denoted as formula_108, so formula_109.

Setting the generating function equal to Hamilton&#x27;s principal function, plus an arbitrary constant formula_110:
formula_111
the HJE automatically arises
formula_112

When solved for formula_113, these also give us the useful equations
formula_114
or written in components for clarity
formula_115

Ideally, these &quot;N&quot; equations can be inverted to find the original generalized coordinates formula_116 as a function of the constants formula_117 and formula_118, thus solving the original problem.

== Separation of variables ==
When the problem allows additive separation of variables, the HJE leads directly to constants of motion. For example, the time &quot;t&quot; can be separated if the Hamiltonian does not depend on time explicitly. In that case, the time derivative formula_119 in the HJE must be a constant, usually denoted (formula_120), giving the separated solution
formula_121
where the time-independent function formula_122 is sometimes called the abbreviated action or Hamilton&#x27;s characteristic function and sometimes written formula_123 (see action principle names). The reduced Hamilton–Jacobi equation can then be written
formula_124

To illustrate separability for other variables, a certain generalized coordinate formula_125 and its derivative formula_126 are assumed to appear together as a single function
formula_127
in the Hamiltonian
formula_128

In that case, the function &quot;S&quot; can be partitioned into two functions, one that depends only on &quot;qk&quot; and another that depends only on the remaining generalized coordinates
formula_129

Substitution of these formulae into the Hamilton–Jacobi equation shows that the function &quot;ψ&quot; must be a constant (denoted here as formula_130), yielding a first-order ordinary differential equation for formula_131

formula_132

In fortunate cases, the function formula_133 can be separated completely into formula_134 functions formula_135
formula_136

In such a case, the problem devolves to formula_134 ordinary differential equations.

The separability of &quot;S&quot; depends both on the Hamiltonian and on the choice of generalized coordinates. For orthogonal coordinates and Hamiltonians that have no time dependence and are quadratic in the generalized momenta, formula_133 will be completely separable if the potential energy is additively separable in each coordinate, where the potential energy term for each coordinate is multiplied by the coordinate-dependent factor in the corresponding momentum term of the Hamiltonian (the Staeckel conditions). For illustration, several examples in orthogonal coordinates are worked in the next sections.

=== Examples in various coordinate systems ===
==== Spherical coordinates ====
In spherical coordinates the Hamiltonian of a free particle moving in a conservative potential &quot;U&quot; can be written
formula_139

The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is completely separable in these coordinates provided that there exist functions formula_140 such that formula_141 can be written in the analogous form
formula_142

Substitution of the completely separated solution
formula_143
into the HJE yields
formula_144

This equation may be solved by successive integrations of ordinary differential equations, beginning with the equation for formula_145
formula_146
where formula_147 is a constant of the motion that eliminates the formula_145 dependence from the Hamilton–Jacobi equation
formula_149

The next ordinary differential equation involves the formula_150 generalized coordinate
formula_151
where formula_152 is again a constant of the motion that eliminates the formula_150 dependence and reduces the HJE to the final ordinary differential equation
formula_154
whose integration completes the solution for formula_67.

==== Elliptic cylindrical coordinates ====
The Hamiltonian in elliptic cylindrical coordinates can be written
formula_156
where the foci of the ellipses are located at formula_157 on the formula_158-axis. The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is completely separable in these coordinates provided that formula_141 has an analogous form
formula_160
where formula_161, formula_162 and formula_163 are arbitrary functions. Substitution of the completely separated solution
formula_164 into the HJE yields
formula_165

Separating the first ordinary differential equation
formula_166
yields the reduced Hamilton–Jacobi equation (after re-arrangement and multiplication of both sides by the denominator)
formula_167
which itself may be separated into two independent ordinary differential equations
formula_168
formula_169
that, when solved, provide a complete solution for formula_67.

==== Parabolic cylindrical coordinates ====
The Hamiltonian in parabolic cylindrical coordinates can be written
formula_171

The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is completely separable in these coordinates provided that formula_141 has an analogous form
formula_173
where formula_174, formula_175, and formula_163 are arbitrary functions. Substitution of the completely separated solution
formula_177
into the HJE yields
formula_178

Separating the first ordinary differential equation
formula_179
yields the reduced Hamilton–Jacobi equation (after re-arrangement and multiplication of both sides by the denominator)
formula_180
which itself may be separated into two independent ordinary differential equations
formula_181
formula_182
that, when solved, provide a complete solution for formula_67.

== Waves and particles ==

=== Optical wave fronts and trajectories ===

The HJE establishes a duality between trajectories and wavefronts. For example, in geometrical optics, light can be considered either as “rays” or waves. The wave front can be defined as the surface formula_184 that the light emitted at time formula_185 has reached at time formula_186. Light rays and wave fronts are dual: if one is known, the other can be deduced.

More precisely, geometrical optics is a variational problem where the “action” is the travel time formula_187 along a path,formula_188 where formula_189 is the medium&#x27;s index of refraction and formula_190 is an infinitesimal arc length. From the above formulation, one can compute the ray paths using the Euler–Lagrange formulation; alternatively, one can compute the wave fronts by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi equation. Knowing one leads to knowing the other.

The above duality is very general and applies to &quot;all&quot; systems that derive from a variational principle: either compute the trajectories using Euler–Lagrange equations or the wave fronts by using Hamilton–Jacobi equation.

The wave front at time formula_186, for a system initially at formula_192 at time formula_193, is defined as the collection of points formula_194 such that formula_195. If formula_196 is known, the momentum is immediately deduced.formula_197

Once formula_198 is known, tangents to the trajectories formula_199 are computed by solving the equationformula_200for formula_199, where formula_202 is the Lagrangian. The trajectories are then recovered from the knowledge of formula_199.

=== Relationship to the Schrödinger equation ===

The isosurfaces of the function formula_204 can be determined at any time &quot;t&quot;. The motion of an formula_67-isosurface as a function of time is defined by the motions of the particles beginning at the points formula_4 on the isosurface. The motion of such an isosurface can be thought of as a &quot;wave&quot; moving through formula_4-space, although it does not obey the wave equation exactly. To show this, let &quot;S&quot; represent the phase of a wave
formula_208
where formula_209 is a constant (the Planck constant) introduced to make the exponential argument dimensionless; changes in the amplitude of the wave can be represented by having formula_67 be a complex number. The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is then rewritten as
formula_211
which is the Schrödinger equation.

Conversely, starting with the Schrödinger equation and our ansatz for formula_212, it can be deduced that
formula_213

The classical limit (formula_214) of the Schrödinger equation above becomes identical to the following variant of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation,
formula_215

Setting the four-momentum formula_220 equal to the four-gradient of the action formula_133,

The particle motion occurs along the figure-8 trajectory in formula_280 plane set perpendicular to the solenoid axis with arbitrary azimuth angle formula_281 due to axial symmetry of the solenoidal magnetic field.

<doc id="897540" wikidata="Q909461" url="?curid=897540" title="Simone (2002 film)">
<text>Simone (stylized as S1M0NE) is a 2002 American satirical science fiction film written, produced and directed by Andrew Niccol. The film stars Al Pacino, Catherine Keener, Evan Rachel Wood, Rachel Roberts, Jay Mohr and Winona Ryder. The story follows a fading director who creates a virtual actress to star in his films and the attempts he makes to keep her non-presence a secret as she becomes more famous. &quot;Simone&quot; garnered mixed reviews from critics, grossing $19.6 million worldwide against its $10 million budget.

==Plot==
When Nicola Anders, the star of a new film by disillusioned, out-of-favor director Viktor Taransky, refuses to finish the film and contractually requires her image to not be used in the film without risking a lawsuit, Taransky is forced to find an actress to replace her and re-shoot scenes from the film.

Instead of hiring another actress, Taransky experiments with a new computer program that he inherits from acquaintance Hank Aleno. It enables the creation of a computer-generated woman that he can easily animate to play the film&#x27;s central character. Taransky names his virtual actor &quot;Simone&quot;, a name derived from the computer program&#x27;s title, Simulation One. Seamlessly incorporated into the film, Simone gives a fantastic performance, precisely controlled by Taransky. The film is a huge success, but the studio and world grow confused about Simone, and are eager to find out who she is.

Taransky initially claims that Simone is a recluse and requests that her privacy be respected, but that merely intensifies media demands for her to appear. Taransky decides that he will reveal the secret of her non-existence after her second starring motion picture. To satisfy demand, he executes a number of progressively ambitious stunts that rely on misdirection and cinematic special effects. Eventually, the ruse escalates to simulated remote live interviews.

Two determined tabloid reporters discover that Taransky used out-of-date stock photography as the background during an interview, and they blackmail him into providing Simone for a live appearance. He arranges for her to perform a song at a stadium event, appearing in a cloud of smoke and using flawless holographic technology. The perception of being in-person is reinforced with real-time visualization on the stadium&#x27;s monitors. Simone becomes even more famous, simultaneously becoming a double winner of the Academy Award for Best Actress, tied with herself.

Although initially happy that his hoax was successful, Viktor grows tired of Simone constantly overshadowing him in the press. So he decides to purposefully make her third film bad. Thus, Simone&#x27;s next film, &quot;I Am Pig&quot;, is her &quot;directorial debut&quot;, and a tasteless treatment about zoophilia intended to disgust audiences. Not only does it fail to achieve the desired effect of audience alienation, it also serves to foster her credibility as a risk-taking, fearless and avant-garde artist.

Taransky&#x27;s subsequent attempts to discredit Simone by having her drink, smoke and curse at public appearances, and use politically incorrect statements backfire when the press instead begins to see her as refreshingly honest. As a last resort, Taransky decides to completely dispose of Simone by using a computer virus to erase her, dumping the hard drive and floppy disks into a steamer trunk, burying the trunk at sea, and announcing to the press that she has died of a rare virus that she contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the Third World. During the funeral, the police interrupt, open the coffin and find only a cardboard cutout of Simone. Viktor is arrested and shown a security camera video that recorded him loading the steamer trunk onto his yacht.

After being charged with her murder, Taransky admits that Simone is not a person but merely a computer program. The chest containing the computer data is retrieved from the ocean, but it is empty. Taransky&#x27;s daughter Lainey and ex-wife Elaine enter his studio to help him try to restore Simone. They find Taransky&#x27;s virus source disk (&quot;Plague&quot;) and apply an anti-virus program to eradicate the computer virus. They restore Simone and have her appear on national television holding up a newspaper headline with her obituary, along with a story that her death was a hoax. Elaine and Taransky reunite, but Simone and Taransky create a &quot;public relationship&quot;. They even have a virtual baby as a publicity stunt.

==Cast==
==Production==
Like Andrew Niccol&#x27;s predecessor &quot;Gattaca&quot;, &quot;Simone&quot; deals with themes of the problematic aspects of technological advances being used to attempt to attain perfection. Unlike the former, however, &quot;Simone&quot; was Niccol&#x27;s first attempt at a comedic satire with lighter moments and over-the-top drama. Niccol&#x27;s first attempt at non-satire had been the earlier and more successful &quot;The Truman Show&quot;.

Pruitt Taylor Vince and Jason Schwartzman were cast as obese tabloid investigator Max Sayer and his shady-looking but peculiarly childlike assistant Milton, respectively. Rebecca Romijn was later cast in the role of Faith, Viktor&#x27;s secretary, who is so obsessed with Simone that she begins dressing like Simone, dying her hair like Simone, and trying to have sex with Viktor so that she can hear him call her &quot;Simone&quot;. These side actors built up much of the comedy surrounding the bizarre cultural phenomenon surrounding Simone.

Footage of character Holly Golightly from &quot;Breakfast At Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; was obtained from Paramount Studios to be used in the film for part of the basis of the Simone character, while scenic footage used for Simone&#x27;s &quot;remote interview&quot; backgrounds was obtained from Getty Images. Stylized elements that are present throughout the film and its credits include the use of the numeral 1 in place of the letter &quot;I&quot;, and the numeral 0 in place of the letter &quot;O&quot;. The style occurs for the duration of the film, including for all cast and crew names. Principal photography was by Edward Lachman, while the entirety of the production was made in California, using the Getty stock footage to fill in for locations such as Egypt&#x27;s Great Pyramids.

&quot;Simone&quot; features a cover of &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; by Mary J. Blige, which Simone sings via hologram during a concert scene, and which plays during the closing credits.

Carter Burwell composed the film&#x27;s score, which was released on CD.

===Special effects===
The film shows how the fake is produced using the chroma key technique. A post-credits sequence shows Viktor creating fake footage of Simone in a supermarket, which one of her pursuers sees and believes it to be real.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened at number 9 at the North American box-office, grossing $3,813,463 in its opening weekend. The film grossed $19,576,023 worldwide.

===Critical response===
&quot;Simone&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 50% approval rating, based on 161 reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;The satire in &quot;S1m0ne&quot; lacks bite, and the plot isn&#x27;t believable enough to feel relevant.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 49, based on 38 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; was critical of Niccol wasting his premise by giving it a broad appeal with &quot;sitcom simplicity&quot;, and his cast with a narrow direction for their characters, saying, &quot;He wants to edge it in the direction of a Hollywood comedy, but the satire is not sharp enough and the characters, including the ex-wife, are too routine.&quot; 

&quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Peter Bradshaw wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s reasonable material, but there are no real plot twists or unexpected implications; it all just rolls out easily in a Hollywood that director Niccol makes appear so unreal as to be an easy target.&quot;

Marc Savlov of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; said, &quot;What really irked me about &quot;Simone&quot; was that it stank of the very thing it appeared to be mocking: it&#x27;s a big-budget, commercial film taking potshots at big-budget, commercial filmmaking (as well as overripe, over-earnest indies), and although it strives constantly for a sense of knowing, winking irony, the only thing ironic about it is how much it resembles its supposed target.&quot;

Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;The writer-director Mr. Niccol is satirizing the kinds of dazzling empties he himself has made. [Mr. Niccol is] fascinated with surfaces—the films he&#x27;s been involved with (he wrote &quot;The Truman Show&quot; and wrote and directed &quot;Gattaca&quot;) are a mix of populism and deconstruction. His newest effort, &quot;Simone&quot;, goes beyond postmodern to post-entertainment—it&#x27;s tepid and vapid.&quot;

<text>A Market-based valuation is a form of stock valuation that refers to market indicators, also called extrinsic criteria (i.e. not related to economic fundamentals and account data, which are intrinsic criteria).

==Examples of market valuation methods==
===Technical analysis===
Technical analysis is the most characteristic market-based method, although it focuses more on timing than pricing.

Also, rough market comparison tools such as the PE ratio and the PEG ratio are used. More sophisticated forms of analysis (fundamental analysis, quantitative analysis, and behavioral analysis) use also some market criteria, such as the risk premium or beta coefficient.

Those criteria might be &quot;tilted&quot; in some valuation models in anticipation of their possible variation in the next future, or to adapt them to their historical statistical range or mean.

<text>Australia&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos (AFHV, also known as Funniest Home Videos or simply The Video Show, originally Graham Kennedy&#x27;s Funniest Home Video Show in its first season and Australia&#x27;s Funniest Home Video Show until 2004) is an Australian television show on the Nine Network that presents home videos sent in by viewers. It is the Australian counterpart of &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;, which was also created by Vin Di Bona.

The show was broadcast from March 1990 until February 2014. Although Nine did not officially cancel the show, in 2015 they stated that they had no plans to produce new episodes.

==Synopsis ==
The show is similar in content to &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Framed!&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;, which was also created by Vin Di Bona (which was based on Tokyo Broadcasting System&#x27;s &quot;Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan&quot;). The videos frequently feature slapstick and lowbrow humour such as people tripping over or animals behaving in amusing ways. Most videos are overdubbed with a voice-over and sound effects. In a deal with various foreign producers of similar shows, some imported clips are used, in exchange for home-grown videos from Australia.

Each new Australian video shown on the programme received $500. At the end of each episode the audience watching at home can choose their favourite video of the night from a selection of 4, via telephone and SMS voting, with the winning clip receiving $10,000. At the end of each year, winning clips compete in a semi-final and grand final, where in the most recent seasons third place received a home theatre package, second place received a prize package worth around $100,000 (typically with two or three cars), while the winner received $250,000 in cash (although in 2012 the winner received $150,000).

In 2005, the show received a major revamp with a new set, logo and theme music, leaving behind the original internationally recognised look of &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; for a &quot;futuristic&quot; design with a brighter and more open set. Since then, the set has received both minor and major alterations, but still retains a bright and open appearance.

For most of the show&#x27;s life, it has been a half-hour program broadcast on Tuesday at . In mid 2000 the show moved to 6.30 pm Saturday, and in 2004, was extended to one hour. In 2013, the show switched from its regular seasonal broadcast to a &quot;summer season&quot; of repeats to allow for broadcasting of &quot;The Voice Australia&quot;. In 2014, the show returned to its original half-hour format and aired on Saturday at 7.00 pm.

=== Theme music ===
From 1991 to 2004 the theme song was a cover version of &quot;The Funny Things You Do&quot; from the show&#x27;s American counterpart with the word &quot;America&quot; replaced by &quot;Australia&quot; and the line &quot;You&#x27;re the red, white and blue&quot; changed to &quot;You&#x27;re the dinky-di true blue&quot;. It was slightly rearranged in 1994 (with vocals from then-host Jo Beth Taylor, which remained after her 1997 departure). In line with the new season in 2000, the show received a refresh in updated video graphics, set recolouring and a brand new theme song with vocals provided by Australian session singer and songwriter, Marty Cobcroft, in a rock-based arrangement. Sydney musician, Andy Payne, provided additional backing vocals. From 2005 onwards, original compositions were used as the theme music.

The theme song served as the show&#x27;s intro and played before and after each commercial break. Until 2001 the theme song can be heard during the closing credits.

==Special episodes==

On 19 November 1991, a special international edition of the show hosted by Jacki MacDonald with special guests hosts from versions of the show around the world via video link featuring Bob Saget (America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos), Kerry Smith (New Zealand&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos), Linda de Mol &amp; Billy Hotdog (De Leukste Thuis), Frank Dingenen (Videodinges), Bernard Montiel &amp; Alexandre Debanne (Video Gag), Fausto Silva (Video Cassetadas), Mike Carl and Gundis Zambo (Bitte Lächeln). The episode also includes imported clips from each country featured.

On 28 February 1995, the show celebrated its 200th episode hosted by Jo Beth Taylor during an hour-long special which featured special guest appearances from America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos host at the time Bob Saget, Bernard Montiel &amp; Alexandre Debanne from Video Gag via video message, as well as video messages from casts and hosts of other programs on the Nine Network congratulating the show&#x27;s milestone. The shows anniversary special featured bloopers of former hosts Graham Kennedy, Jacki MacDonald &amp; Lisa Patrick, also including The Channel Nine Marching Band conducted by Geoff Harvey performing the shows theme song in between each segment before and after the breaks.

In the summer of 1999, the show celebrated its 10th birthday, hosted by Kim Kilbey and featuring special guest Frank Bennett, to perform his single &quot;Beautiful People&quot; alongside the Sydney Children&#x27;s Choir, who sang a special arrangement of the show&#x27;s theme song along with Jo Beth Taylor. The show&#x27;s anniversary special included a timeline of hosts; bloopers; fashion (of the female hosts); and interviews of former hosts Graham Kennedy, Jacki MacDonald, Lisa Patrick, Jo Beth Taylor, and Catriona Rowntree. This was also the last episode before moving to the Melbourne network and the inception of a new style for the following season in 2000.

On 31 December 2003, the show celebrated its 14th birthday, which included segments &quot;As The Camera Rolls&quot;, where Toni is wearing a feather scarf and Bridge (Richard Wilkins) is wearing a pirate eye patch, an appearance by John Burgess of Burgo&#x27;s Catch Phrase and videos from past grand final winners. Other features includes host bloopers, the introduction of the &quot;Taped Crusader&quot; character, and a videotaped message from former host Catriona Rowntree who paid homage to inaugural presenter Graham Kennedy. The 14th birthday special concluded with Mercury4 performing their hit single &quot;Get Me Some&quot; at the end of the show.

On 4 April 2009, it celebrated its 20th birthday; some of the features included the timeline of the openings, fashion (all female hosts), and additional features.

On 16 April 2011, the show celebrated its &#x27;21st&#x27; birthday and featured giveaways from JVC, timeline of the hosts, celebratory messages from Avril Lavigne, Short Stack, Alexis Jordan, Shane Warne and former host Kim Kilbey. Other features includes appearances by Julie Goodwin, Justice Crew, the cast of Hi-5 and a special visit from former host Toni Pearen. During the show Shelley Craft paid tribute to honour inaugural presenter Graham Kennedy who died in 2005. The &#x27;21st&#x27; birthday special concluded with Justice Crew performing their song &#x27;Friday to Sunday&#x27; at the end of the show.

===&quot;Australia&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos: Daily Edition&quot;===

Australia&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos: Daily Edition (also known simply as The Daily Edition) is a spin-off to &quot;Australia&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; which first aired on the Nine Network from 30 November 2009 to December 2010 and later aired on GO! from 2011. It was a brief 30-minute version of the full show that would broadcast selected clips from the original show, and was hosted by then-current host of the original series Shelley Craft. The show was later cancelled in late 2012.

===&quot;Australia&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos: World&#x27;s Funniest Videos&quot;===
Australia&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos: World&#x27;s Funniest Videos (also known as AFHV: World&#x27;s Funniest Videos) is a spin-off to &quot;Australia&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; which first aired on the Nine Network from 7 April 2009. The 30-minute show features clips predominately from the American version of &quot;Funniest Home Videos&quot;, and was hosted by former Australian rules footballer, Shane Crawford and former MTV Australia video jockey, Lyndsey Rodrigues. The show was later cancelled after its third episode on 21 April 2009.

===&quot;Australia&#x27;s Naughtiest Home Videos&quot;===

Australia&#x27;s Naughtiest Home Videos is a controversial one-off special spin-off to &quot;Australia&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; which aired on the Nine Network on 3 September 1992. It was a highly explicit special, depicting videos of sexual situations and other sexually explicit content, and was hosted by Australian radio personality Doug Mulray. It was planned to be a 60-minute broadcast, but due to complaints from both viewers and then-owner on the Nine Network Kerry Packer, was taken off the air part-way through the first and only episode, making it the only Australian television series to have done so. A copy of the full episode was later located at the Nine Network in 2008, after which the episode was edited to comply with new television standards and re-broadcast with commentary from Bert Newton at 8:30 PM on 28 August 2008, one week short of sixteen years after the original special, and at the same airing time.

<doc id="897554" wikidata="Q11329019" url="?curid=897554" title="Packrat parser">
<text>The Packrat parser is a type of parser that shares similarities with the recursive descent parser in its construction. However, it differs because it takes parsing expression grammars (PEGs) as input rather than LL grammars.

In 1970, Alexander Birman laid the groundwork for packrat parsing by introducing the &quot;TMG recognition scheme&quot; (TS), and &quot;generalized TS&quot; (gTS). TS was based upon Robert M. McClure&#x27;s TMG compiler-compiler, and gTS was based upon Dewey Val Schorre&#x27;s META compiler-compiler.
Birman&#x27;s work was later refined by Aho and Ullman; and renamed as Top-Down Parsing Language (TDPL), and Generalized TDPL (GTDPL), respectively. These algorithms were the first of their kind to employ deterministic top-down parsing with backtracking. 

Bryan Ford developed PEGs as an expansion of GTDPL and TS. Unlike CFGs, PEGs are unambiguous and can match well with machine-oriented languages. PEGs, similar to GTDPL and TS, can also express all LL(k) and LR(k). Bryan also introduced Packrat as a parser that uses memoization techniques on top of a simple PEG parser. This was done because PEGs have an unlimited lookahead capability resulting in a parser with exponential time performance in the worst case.

Packrat keeps track of the intermediate results for all mutually recursive parsing functions. Each parsing function is only called once at a specific input position. In some instances of packrat implementation, if there is insufficient memory, certain parsing functions may need to be called multiple times at the same input position, causing the parser to take longer than linear time.

== Syntax ==
The packrat parser takes in input the same syntax as PEGs: a simple PEG is composed of terminal and nonterminal symbols, possibly interleaved with operators that compose one or several derivation rules.

=== Symbols ===
* Nonterminal symbols are indicated with capital letters (e.g., formula_1)
* Terminal symbols are indicated with lowercase (e.g., formula_2)
* Expressions are indicated with lower-case Greek letter (e.g., formula_3)
** Expressions can be a mix of terminal symbols, nonterminal symbols and operators

=== Operators ===

=== Rules ===
A derivation rule is composed by a nonterminal symbol and an expression formula_4.

A special expression formula_5 is the starting point of the grammar. In case no formula_5 is specified, the first expression of the first rule is used.

An input string is considered accepted by the parser if the formula_7 is recognized. As a side-effect, a string formula_8 can be recognized by the parser even if it was not fully consumed. 

An extreme case of this rule is that the grammar formula_9 matches any string.

This can be avoided by rewriting the grammar as formula_10 

=== Example ===
formula_11

This grammar recognizes a palindrome over the alphabet formula_12, with an optional digit in the middle.

Example strings accepted by the grammar include: formula_13 and formula_14.

=== Left recursion ===
Left recursion happens when a grammar production refers to itself as its left-most element, either directly or indirectly. Since Packrat is a recursive descent parser, it cannot handle left recursion directly. During the early stages of development, it was found that a production that is left-recursive can be transformed into a right-recursive production. This modification significantly simplifies the task of a Packrat parser. Nonetheless, if there is an indirect left recursion involved, the process of rewriting can be quite complex and challenging. If the time complexity requirements are loosened from linear to superlinear, it is possible to modify the memoization table of a Packrat parser to permit left recursion, without altering the input grammar.

=== Iterative combinator ===
The iterative combinator formula_15, formula_16, needs special attention when used in a Packrat parser. As a matter of fact, the use of iterative combinators introduces a &quot;secret&quot; recursion that does not record intermediate results in the outcome matrix. This can lead to the parser operating with a superlinear behaviour. This problem can be resolved apply the following transformation:

With this transformation, the intermediate results can be properly memoized.

== Memoization technique ==
Memoization is an optimization technique in computing that aims to speed up programs by storing the results of expensive function calls. This technique essentially works by caching the results so that when the same inputs occur again, the cached result is simply returned, thus avoiding the time-consuming process of re-computing. When using packrat parsing and memoization, it&#x27;s noteworthy that the parsing function for each nonterminal is solely based on the input string. It does not depend on any information gathered during the parsing process. Essentially, memoization table entries do not affect or rely on the parser&#x27;s specific state at any given time. 

Packrat parsing stores results in a matrix or similar data structure that allows for quick look-ups and insertions. When a production is encountered, the matrix is checked to see if it has already occurred. If it has, the result is retrieved from the matrix. If not, the production is evaluated, the result is inserted into the matrix, and then returned. When evaluating the entire formula_17 matrix in a tabular approach, it would require formula_18 space. Here, formula_19 represents the number of nonterminals, and formula_20 represents the input string size. 

In a naïve implementation, the entire table can be derived from the input string starting from the end of the string.

The Packrat parser can be improved to update only the necessary cells in the matrix through a depth-first visit of each subexpression tree. Consequently, using a matrix with dimensions of formula_17 is often wasteful, as most entries would remain empty. These cells are linked to the input string, not to the nonterminals of the grammar. This means that increasing the input string size would always increase memory consumption, while the number of parsing rules changes only the worst space complexity. 

=== Cut operator ===
Another operator called &quot;cut&quot; has been introduced to Packrat to reduce its average space complexity even further. This operator utilizes the formal structures of many programming languages to eliminate impossible derivations. For instance, control statements parsing in a standard programming language is mutually exclusive from the first recognized token, e.g.,formula_22.

When a Packrat parser uses cut operators, it effectively clears its backtracking stack. This is because a cut operator reduces the number of possible alternatives in an ordered choice. By adding cut operators in the right places in a grammar&#x27;s definition, the resulting Packrat parser only needs a nearly constant amount of space for memoization.

== The algorithm ==

RULE(R : Rule, P : Position )
 entry = GET_MEMO(R,P) -- return the number of elements previously matched in rule R at position P
 if entry == nil then
 return EVAL(R, P);
 end
 return entry;
EVAL(R : Rule, P : Position )
 start = P; 
 for choice in R.choices -- Return a list of choice
 acc=0;
 for symbol in choice then -- Return each element of a rule, terminal and nonterminal
 if symbol.is_terminal then
 if INPUT(start+acc) == symbol.terminal then
 acc = acc + 1; --Found correct terminal skip pass it
 else
 break; 
 end
 else 
 res = RULE(symbol.nonterminal , start+acc ); -- try to recognize a nonterminal in position start+acc
 SET_MEMO(symbol.nonterminal , start+acc, res ); -- we memoize also the failure with special value fail
 if res == fail then 
 break; 
 end
 acc = acc + res;
 end
 if symbol == choice.last -- check if we have matched the last symbol in a choice if so return
 return acc;
 end
 end
 return fail; --if no choice match return fail

<text>Zinovy Alekseyevich Peshkov (, or &quot;Pechkov&quot;, 16 October 1884 – 27 November 1966) was a Russian-born French general and diplomat.

==Early life==
Born as Zalman or as Yeshua Zalman Sverdlov (in Russian: Zinovy Mikhailovich Sverdlov), the future Zinovy Peshkov was the second child and eldest son in a Jewish family in Nizhny Novgorod. His father, Mikail Izraylevich (1846?-1921), was a relatively prosperous itinerant coppersmith and copper engraver from the region of Bialystok in the Kingdom of Poland, in an area of Belarusian and Lithuanian influence. His mother, Elizaveta Solomonovna Averbach (1864-1900), was related to merchant families of Nizhny Novgorod which, since the beginning of the 19th century, had experienced vigorous economic development.

Zinovy&#x27;s generation was emblematic of the fate of Jewish families who were in contact with the principal powers at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. In fact, out of the eight known children of Mikhail and Elisabeth, some settled in Soviet Russia – sometimes by adopting the new regime – while others, having chosen emigration, after crossing Western Europe, settled in the United States. Thus Sarah, the oldest daughter, born in Polotsk, near Vitebsk (in present-day Belarus) in 1876, emigrated to New York around 1913. She died there in 1947. Zinovy, the oldest of the sons, born in 1884, was followed by Yakov (1885-1919), the future political colleague of Lenin. Following these two brothers, who had singular and opposite destinies, several sons and daughters arrived who in their turn, were separated by politics and emigration. These include, other than Sarah, Zinovy, Sophie (who died in 1951 in Saratov), Sore (died in 1964), Lev (born 1893, died in 1914 in Russia) and (, born 1886, emigrated to the USA, returned to Soviet Russia in 1918, shot in 1939).

==The protege of Gorky==
Reluctant to pursue his studies and prepared from adolescence for any adventure, the young Zinovy trolled the streets of Nizhny Novgorod on the fringes of legality, spending his time with the many thugs on the banks of the Volga. In 1896, salvation came upon his meeting a character who undoubtedly had ties to the Sverdlov family, although we have no knowledge of the exact relations between them. Originally from the region where he was placed under house arrest (Nizhny Novgorod, his home town, is 100 km north of Arzamas, where he was exiled), Maxim Gorky – who was then 28 years old – took under his protection the young Zinovy, who he undoubtedly saw as a kind of double as well as a quirky reflection of his own journey.

Gorky organized meetings, promoting his ideas throughout Russia with an uncommon energy. Acting as a kind of secretary and “jack of all trades”, Zinovy brought him a support that was as fervent as it was efficient. He shared his arrests and imprisonments ordered by a hostile regime, at a moment when Gorky was at the threshold of huge success both in and out of Russia, a success which relied on a radical criticism of the aristocracy. Under the guidance of his mentor, the young man, perhaps at the advice of Stanislavski, tried himself in the theater in Moscow as well as in writing. He also collected romantic conquests and opened himself to the world.

1902 was a milestone for Gorky and Sverdlov. The presentation on the stage of the Moscow Art Theatre of “The Lower Depths” marked the first triumph of the writer. At the same moment, his election to the Academy of Literature – which had been annulled by Nicholas II – a major public event, joined another more private one, the adoption at Arzamas, under Russian Orthodox rites, of the young Zinovy. In order to bypass the law limiting movement and settlement of Jews in the empire, but also to mark his link with the writer, Zinovy was baptized on September 30, 1902, in the city church. He officially changed his name, adopting the real last name of Gorky, Peshkov, since the latter was his official godfather.

Wishing to avoid induction into the armies of the Tsar during the Russo-Japanese war of 1904, Zinovy Peshkov went abroad. After Finland, England and Sweden, he ended up settling in Canada, where he worked in a number of trades. Few details are known about this wandering life, except those which his letters to Gorky reveal to us. The 1905 revolution and its upheavals drove the writer into exile.

In April 1906, Zinovy joined his friend on a dock in New York, the first step in a tour in which mobs crowded in to hear his speeches. The New York Times interviewed Peshkov, giving information about Gorky&#x27;s forthcoming visit, and noting that their source &quot;Nikolay Zavolzsky Pieshkoff (sic), Gorky&#x27;s adopted son&quot;, had fled Russia and for more than a year: &quot;has been living quietly on the east side and earning his living in the mailing room of Wilshire&#x27;s Magazine.&quot; Four days later the New York Times covered an event where Gorky spoke at length, and was supported by Mark Twain. In this report Peshkov is described as: &quot;Kikolay Zavolsky Pieshkoff, the adopted son of Gorky&quot;. Unfortunately American opinion, at first charmed by the oratorical capacities of Gorky, to which Peshkov’s intermediation provided picturesque relief, changed quickly when it learned that the writer was travelling not with his wife, but with his mistress, Maria Andreieva. Persona non grata, Gorky was forced after being expelled from his hotel to find an improvised pied-a-terre in New York. In October, he left the United States bound for Italy, leaving Zinovy behind.

After a year of wandering across the Pacific Ocean from San Francisco to New Zealand, Peshkov rejoined his adopted father in Italy in May 1907. This was the period of the “School of Capri”, which was an especially formative time for him since many intellectuals and artists (Chaliapine, for example), gathered there; in addition, there were Bolshevik revolutionaries in exile – Lenin, Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, Bazarov, etc. – generously hosted by the writer who assumed all the costs of these visits, in which political theory and action were in daily contact, threatening the Tsarist empire with the greatest danger.

Zinovy, once again acting as Gorky’s secretary, organized this collective life, supervised the details, profiting as well from these unusual encounters to which he was a witness. He rubbed shoulders with Lenin, whom he bore little respect, whose relations with Gorky he later indicated were complicated by often divergent opinions. It was during October 1910, while staying at La Spezia with Alexander Amfiteatrov, that he married the daughter of a Cossack colonel five days after meeting her. He emigrated with her to the United States, where he struggled to find a situation. Shortly afterward, they were separated. From this short liaison, Peshkov had a daughter, Elizabeth. This wife, Lydia Bourago (1889-1966) was perhaps related to Colonel Alexander Bourago, hero of the 1878 war against Turkey, who died in 1883. She is sometimes referred to under the name of Vicomtesse de Combette. Her daughter, Elisabeth Peshkov, was married to Ivan Markov, Soviet ambassador to Rome, who was liquidated in 1937 by order of Stalin.

In 1913 he returned to Capri, where he once again took up his activities with Gorky, who, shortly afterward, profiting from an amnesty offered by the Romanovs to writers guilty of criminal opinions, returned to Russia. The First World War surprised Zinovy in Italy in August 1914. As in 1905, he had no desire to serve the Tsar. Without our being able to know the deeper reasons – he had no particular ties to France during his exile from the empire, having resided mainly across the Atlantic or in Italy – he went to the French consulate in Genoa to enlist in the Foreign Legion.

==The hero of the Foreign Legion==

Guided to the recruitment post in Nice, he enlisted on August 31, 1914 as EVDG (an acronym for “voluntary enlisted for the duration of the war”) in the marching battalion of the 1st Foreign Regiment. Two months were sufficient to equip and train the volunteers at the beginning of the conflict. Peshkov, who was special – in addition to Russian, he knew French, English, Italian and German, which was useful in a unit containing men from all over the world – was given the rank of 1st class on October 21, 1914. Named corporal on April 1, 1915, he was put in command of a squad. Several days later, in May 1915, during combat with his division before Arras, he was seriously wounded. During the capture of Carency, a bullet shattered his arm while he was leading his soldiers.

Peshkov’s regiment, like its twin, the 2nd marching regiment of the Foreign Legion, absorbed many Russian Jews assembled in these two units, who distinguished themselves in the battle of the Somme and that of Artois. The attack at Carency in May 1915 was a bloody one for these volunteers, as their losses were very great.

Treated near the front, he had to find the strength to make it to the rear. After succeeding in borrowing a train, he found himself in the American hospital at Neuilly, where only amputation saved him from death. Decorated, Corporal Peshkov underwent rehabilitation and then was pensioned. He then returned to Italy. Introduced into high society, where he was a sensation, he gave lectures on the horrors of war, probably inspired by the meetings organized with Gorky several years earlier, which had a great public success. He then found himself again in Paris. On June 22, 1916, Peshkov again enlisted “for the duration of the war” with the grade of 2nd class. He was attached to the 20th section of the military staff. In Paris, he met Philippe Berthelot, Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who realized what this young mutilated soldier, bedecked with decorations, could bring in terms of propaganda aimed at neutral countries, first of all the United States, a place with which Peshkov was well acquainted.

Convinced of the value of this strategy, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Briand sent Zinovy to the French Ambassador, Jusserand, with the grade of temporary 3rd class interpreter (lieutenant), for the duration of his mission. At the end of nine months, Peshkov returned to Paris, having accomplished his mission. In fact, in April 1917, President Wilson had the Senate vote on a declaration of war. The United States joined the allies in the conflict.

At that time, diplomatic attention was focused on the European continent. Promoted to the rank of 2nd class interpreter officer (captain) on May 13, 1917, Peshkov was present at the events which plunged Russia into the revolution. In May, the French government sent a mission to the provisional government. He was then asked to participate, the objective being for France to convince the new Russian power to continue the war against the German Empire. This return to his roots was, for Zinovy, an occasion to renew ties to his native land and his family. By way of his brother Yakov, he had contacts with the Bolsheviks, but in no way shared their point of view. He probably saw his brother Veniamin as well as his sisters who had remained in Russia, all supporters of the revolution. The contacts with Gorky were cold, but this climate did not harm the solid friendship which tied the two men.

Lenin’s seizure of power in October was rapidly followed in December by the Brest-Litovsk armistice, which put an end to the Russo-German war, which was a setback for the French diplomatic mission. Zinovy returned to Paris, but the French government, aware of the diplomatic capabilities of Captain Peshkov, soon sent him to advise the White Armies on all the fronts of the civil war which was then bloodying Russia. He was promoted temporary head of a battalion for the duration of his mission from December 9, 1918. He also met the ataman of the Cossacks, Semenov, in Vladivostok, then Admiral Kolchak in the Urals to help him in reorganizing his army. The defeat of the latter sent him in February 1920 to the Caucasus, where he attempted in vain to play a role with General Wrangel. The definitive victory of the Red Army over the Whites in November obligated Peshkov to return to Paris.

At that time, Peshkov was still a man of fashion, who had been “launched” according to the expression popular during that period. He was received in the greatest homes in the company of Princess Salomea Andronikova, who he had met in the Caucasus, brought to Europe and with whom he was sharing his life. He was made permanent Captain by a decree of January 14, 1920. He was attached to the 1st Foreign Regiment. He was later attached to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be sent to the United States on January 21, 1921. Returning in May, he remained as secretary of the French delegation of the International Commission for Russia. Still tied to Russia, Zinovy, secretary general of an organization “against famine”, relayed the desperate appeal of Gorky to the international press to gain popular opinion for food aid for his country. This campaign – and the time the writer spent in Germany where he was undergoing treatment – brought the adoptive father and son closer together.

In May 1922, he was put at the disposal of Marshall Lyautey, commander of the troops in Morocco, to be attached to the staff of Meknes. Then he was transferred to the 4th Foreign Infantry Regiment on February 17, 1923, where he commanded the 12th company. Once again, everything about this appointment was astonishing. Peshkov, who received French nationality only the following year, was again in the Foreign Legion with the rank of chief of battalion, although he had no training in command and no experience in the position. Nevertheless, he met the challenge. “The Magnificent One-Armed Man”, as he was nicknamed by his soldiers, led his troops into combat with courage. In June 1925, his left leg was injured during an attack at Bab Taza, “for the sake of symmetry” he quipped, showing the right sleeve of his uniform, useless for the past ten years.

Zinovy, who continued to maintain his ties to foreign affairs, alternated periods of command with diplomatic missions. His stay at the French embassy in the United States from 1926 to 1929 did not prevent him from paying a visit to Gorky at Sorrento during vacations, prior to the writer’s permanent departure for the USSR. During this time Peshkov had a relationship with Irving Thalberg. He met him in Paris in March 1928, with a possible project of adapting his work on the Foreign Legion (published in English as The Bugle Sounds: Life in the Foreign Legion). During his many stays cut short by his command in Morocco, he played an important role in the Levant, particularly intervening with Shi’ite groups in Gabal Amil (now southern Lebanon). During this epoch, he met his second wife, Jacqueline Delaunay-Belleville, the widow of a diplomat, but this marriage, like the earlier one, was quickly dissolved. On the eve of global conflict, chief of battalion Peshkov commanded a unit in Morocco with panache and vigor; his celebrity brought him into close and regular contact with many personalities, members of high society and journalists. It was in this position in North Africa, commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Foreign Regiment, that he learned of the collapse of the French troops facing the Wehrmacht in May 1940.

==The Gaullist diplomat==
After having heard the appeal of 18 June of General de Gaulle, then in refuge in London, he decided to join him. His project succeeded, but his first contacts with the head of Free France were difficult. Nevertheless, at the end of 1941, de Gaulle promoted him to the rank of colonel (he remained almost 20 years the head of battalion) and sent him on a mission to South Africa, where he organized the transport of arms for the Allied troops, while keeping an eye on Madagascar, which was relatively near. As was often the case, Peshkov succeeded in establishing confidential relations with the head of the armies in the region, General Smuts. The British occupation of the Big Island precipitated events. Uninterested in a critical and controversial involvement with the English, whom he liked, Zinovy then arranged to be sent to French West Africa, where he brilliantly organized the rallying of the colonies.

Appointed Brigadier General in April 1944, Peshkov was soon sent as a delegate of the French Committee of National Liberation to the Republic of China to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, who had just broken with Vichy. Upon arrival at Chung King, the new capital of the country due to the Japanese occupation, Zinovy had to deal with the presence of another French mission sent by General Giraud, a competitor which he knew how to marginalize with subtlety. Made ambassador in November 1944, his presence once again gave him an occasion to demonstrate his capacity to make himself appreciated by leaders of all backgrounds which were so numerous in a China in full revolution.

After this Chinese period, Peshkov was named French ambassador to Japan in 1946 (or more precisely, head of the French liaison mission with the superior allied commander in the Far East). He was close to General MacArthur, whom he admired, since upon the return of the hero of the Philippines, he was not able to hide the interest he showed toward this officer, who impressed him with his uniqueness. On December 14, 1946, he invested MacArthur with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor.

Concerned with looking after the defeated, the diplomat devoted himself to creating ties of confidence with the Japanese government, which he succeeded gradually in achieving during his mandate. In 1950, General Peshkov was retired and replaced by Maurice Dejean. He left Japan for a final return to Paris. Two years later, the government granted him the honor of the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor, which profoundly touched the young roughneck of Nizhny Novgorod.

The return to action of General de Gaulle in 1958 pleased General Peshkov, who had always respected the chief of Free France. Upon his return, the head of state did not forget his loyal ally of the hard times. He charged him with a number of diplomatic missions before sending him in 1964 to Chiang Kai-shek. Since France had decided to support the People&#x27;s Republic of China – i.e. to recognize it diplomatically – the announcement of this turnaround had to be done with the greatest respect for the aged marshal in refuge in Taiwan. The choice of Zinovy was a great homage given to these two soldiers of exceptional destiny.

Zinovy Peshkov died in Paris in November 1966. His ashes are in the Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery. At his request, his tombstone bears only the following inscription:

<text>In finance, the beta ( or market beta or beta coefficient) is a statistic that measures the expected increase or decrease of an individual stock price in proportion to movements of the stock market as a whole. Beta can be used to indicate the contribution of an individual asset to the market risk of a portfolio when it is added in small quantity. It refers to an asset&#x27;s non-diversifiable risk, systematic risk, or market risk. Beta is not a measure of idiosyncratic risk.

Beta is the hedge ratio of an investment with respect to the stock market. For example, to hedge out the market-risk of a stock with a market beta of 2.0, an investor would short $2,000 in the stock market for every $1,000 invested in the stock. Thus insured, movements of the overall stock market no longer influence the combined position on average. Beta measures the contribution of an individual investment to the risk of the market portfolio that was not reduced by diversification. It does not measure the risk when an investment is held on a stand-alone basis.

The beta of an asset is compared to the market as a whole, usually the S&amp;P 500. By definition, the value-weighted average of all market-betas of all investable assets with respect to the value-weighted market index is 1. If an asset has a beta above 1, it indicates that its return moves more than 1-to-1 with the return of the market-portfolio, on average; that is, it is more volatile than the market. In practice, few stocks have negative betas (tending to go up when the market goes down). Most stocks have betas between 0 and 3.

Most fixed income instruments and commodities tend to have low or zero betas; call options tend to have high betas; and put options and short positions and some inverse ETFs tend to have negative betas.

== Technical aspects ==

===Mathematical definition===
The market beta formula_1 of an asset formula_2, observed on formula_3 occasions, is defined by (and best obtained via) a linear regression of the rate of return formula_4 of asset formula_2 on the rate of return formula_6 of the (typically value-weighted) stock-market index formula_7:
:formula_8
where formula_9 is an unbiased error term whose squared error should be minimized. The coefficient formula_10 is often referred to as the alpha.

The ordinary least squares solution is:
:formula_11
where formula_12 and formula_13 are the covariance and variance operators. Betas with respect to different market indexes are not comparable.

=== Relationship between own risk and beta risk ===
By using the relationship between standard deviation and variance, formula_14 and the definition of correlation formula_15, market beta can also be written as
:formula_16,
where formula_17 is the correlation of the two returns, and formula_18, formula_19 are the respective volatilities. This equation shows that the idiosyncratic risk (formula_18) is related to but often very different to market beta. If the idiosyncratic risk is 0 (i.e., the stock returns do not move), so is the market-beta. The reverse is not the case: A coin toss bet has a zero beta but not zero risk.

Attempts have been made to estimate the three ingredient components separately, but this has not led to better estimates of market-betas.

=== Adding an asset to the market portfolio ===
Suppose an investor has all his money in the market formula_7 and wishes to move a small amount into asset class formula_2. The new portfolio is defined by
:formula_23
The variance can be computed as
:formula_24
For small values of formula_25, the terms in formula_26 can be ignored,
:formula_27
Using the definition of formula_28 this is
:formula_29
This suggests that an asset with formula_30 greater than 1 increases the portfolio variance, while an asset with formula_30 less than 1 decreases it &quot;if&quot; added in a small amount.

=== Beta as a linear operator ===
Market-beta can be weighted, averaged, added, etc. That is, if a portfolio consists of 80% asset A and 20% asset B, then the beta of the portfolio is 80% times the beta of asset A and 20% times the beta of asset B.

== Financial analysis ==

In practice, the choice of index makes relatively little difference in the market betas of individual assets, because broad value-weighted market indexes tend to move closely together. Academics tend to prefer to work with a value-weighted market portfolio due to its attractive aggregation properties and its close link with the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Practitioners tend to prefer to work with the S&amp;P 500 due to its easy in-time availability and availability to hedge with stock index futures.

In the idealized CAPM, beta risk is the only kind of risk for which investors should receive an expected return higher than the risk-free rate of interest. When used within the context of the CAPM, beta becomes a measure of the appropriate expected rate of return. Due to the fact that the overall rate of return on the firm is weighted rate of return on its debt and its equity, the market-beta of the overall unlevered firm is the weighted average of the firm&#x27;s debt beta (often close to 0) and its levered equity beta.

In fund management, adjusting for exposure to the market separates out the component that fund managers should have received given that they had their specific exposure to the market. For example, if the stock market went up by 20% in a given year, and a manager had a portfolio with a market-beta of 2.0, this portfolio should have returned 40% in the absence of specific stock picking skills. This is measured by the alpha in the market-model, holding beta constant.

Occasionally, other betas than market-betas are used. The arbitrage pricing theory (APT) has multiple factors in its model and thus requires multiple betas. (The CAPM has only one risk factor, namely the overall market, and thus works only with the plain beta.) For example, a beta with respect to oil price changes would sometimes be called an &quot;oil-beta&quot; rather than &quot;market-beta&quot; to clarify the difference.

Betas commonly quoted in mutual fund analyses often measure the exposure to a specific fund benchmark, rather than to the overall stock market. Such a beta would measure the risk from adding a specific fund to a holder of the mutual fund benchmark portfolio, rather than the risk of adding the fund to a portfolio of the market.

=== Special cases ===
Utility stocks commonly show up as examples of low beta. These have some similarity to bonds, in that they tend to pay consistent dividends, and their prospects are not strongly dependent on economic cycles. They are still stocks, so the market price will be affected by overall stock market trends, even if this does not make sense.

Foreign stocks may provide some diversification. World benchmarks such as S&amp;P Global 100 have slightly lower betas than comparable US-only benchmarks such as S&amp;P 100. However, this effect is not as good as it used to be; the various markets are now fairly correlated, especially the US and Western Europe.

Derivatives are examples of non-linear assets. Whereas Beta relies on a linear model, an out of the money option will have a distinctly non-linear payoff. In these cases, then, the change in price of an option relative to the change in the price of its underlying asset is not constant. (True also - but here, far less pronounced - for volatility, time to expiration, and other factors.) Thus &quot;beta&quot; here, calculated traditionally, would vary constantly as the price of the underlying changed.

Accommodating this, mathematical finance defines a specific volatility beta.

Here, analogous to the above, this beta represents the covariance between the derivative&#x27;s return and changes in the value of the underlying asset, with, additionally, a correction for instantaneous underlying changes.
See volatility (finance), volatility risk, .

==Empirical estimation==

A true beta (which defines the true expected relationship between the rate of return on assets and the market) differs from a realized beta that is based on historical rates of returns and represents just one specific history out of the set of possible stock return realizations. The true market-beta is essentially the average outcome if infinitely many draws could be observed. On average, the best forecast of the realized market-beta is also the best forecast of the true market-beta.

Estimators of market-beta have to wrestle with two important problems. First, the underlying market betas are known to move over time. Second, investors are interested in the best forecast of the true prevailing beta most indicative of the most likely &quot;future beta&quot; realization and not in the &quot;historical market-beta&quot;.

Despite these problems, a historical beta estimator remains an obvious benchmark predictor. It is obtained as the slope of the fitted line from the linear least-squares estimator. The OLS regression can be estimated on 1–5 years worth of daily, weekly or monthly stock returns. The choice depends on the trade off between accuracy of beta measurement (longer periodic measurement times and more years give more accurate results) and historic firm beta changes over time (for example, due to changing sales products or clients).

=== Improved estimators ===
Other beta estimators reflect the tendency of betas (like rates of return) for regression toward the mean, induced not only by measurement error but also by underlying changes in the true beta and/or historical randomness. (Intuitively, one would not suggest a company with high return [e.g., a drug discovery] last year also to have as high a return next year.) Such estimators include the Blume/Bloomberg beta (used prominently on many financial websites), the Vasicek beta, the Scholes–Williams beta, the Dimson beta, and the Welch beta.

* The &quot;Blume beta&quot; shrinks the estimated OLS beta towards a mean of 1, calculating the weighted average of 2/3 times the historical OLS beta plus 1/3. A version based on monthly rates of return is widely distributed by Capital IQ and quoted on all financial websites. It predicts future market-beta poorly.
* The &quot;Vasicek beta&quot; varies the weight between the historical OLS beta and the number 1 (or the average market beta if the portfolio is not value-weighted) by the volatility of the stock and the heterogeneity of betas in the overall market. It can be viewed either as an optimal Bayesian estimator under the (violated) assumption that the underlying market-beta does not move. It is modestly difficult to implement. It performs modestly better than the OLS beta.
* The &quot;Scholes–Williams and Dimson betas&quot; are estimators that account for infrequent trading causing non-synchronously quoted prices. They are rarely useful when stock prices are quoted at day&#x27;s end and easily available to analysts (as they are in the US), because they incur an efficiency loss when trades are reasonably synchronous. However, they can be very useful in cases in which frequent trades are not observed (e.g., as in private equity) or in markets with rare trading activity.
* The &quot;Welch beta&quot; is a slope-winsorized beta estimator that bounds daily stock returns within the range of −2 and 4 times the contemporaneous daily market return. The slope-winsorized daily return of a stock follows formula_33, effectively restricts beta estimates to be between −2 and 4. The beta is estimated with the weighted least squares (WLS) estimation on slope-winsorized daily stock returns and the market returns. It outperforms OLS beta, Blume beta, Vasicek beta, and Dimson betas in forecasting the future realizations of market betas and hedging.

These estimators attempt to uncover the instant prevailing market-beta. When long-term market-betas are required, further regression toward the mean over long horizons should be considered.

<doc id="897559" wikidata="Q1636533" url="?curid=897559" title="Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority">
<text>The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) is an executive non-departmental public body of the Department of Health and Social Care in the United Kingdom. It is a statutory body that regulates and inspects all clinics in the United Kingdom providing &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilisation (IVF), artificial insemination and the storage of human eggs, sperm or embryos. It also regulates human embryo research.

==Background to the establishment of the HFEA==
After the birth of Louise Brown, the world&#x27;s first IVF baby, in 1978, there was concern about the implications of this new technology. In 1982, the UK government formed a committee chaired by philosopher Mary Warnock to look into the issues and see what action needed to be taken.

Hundreds of interested individuals including doctors, scientists and organisations such as health, patient and parent organisations as well as religious groups gave evidence to the committee.

In the years following the Warnock report, proposals were brought forward by the government in the publication of a white paper &quot;Human Fertilisation and Embryology: A Framework for Legislation&quot; in 1987. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 was drafted taking the report into account.

==Legal framework==

===Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990===

The 1990 Act provided for the establishment of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), an executive, non-departmental public body, the first statutory body of its type in the world. 
The HFEA is the independent regulator for IVF treatment and human embryo research and came into effect on 1 August 1991. The 1990 Act ensured the regulation, through licensing, of:
*the creation of human embryos outside the body and their use in treatment and research
*the use of donated gametes and embryos
*the storage of gametes and embryos.

The Act also requires the HFEA keep a database of every IVF treatment carried out since that date and a database relating to all cycles and use of donated gametes (egg and sperm).

===Cloning===

In 2001, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Research Purposes) Regulations 2001/188 extended the purposes for which embryo research could be licensed to include &quot;increasing knowledge about the development of embryos&quot;, &quot;increasing knowledge about serious disease&quot;, and &quot;enabling any such knowledge to be applied in developing treatments for serious disease&quot;.

This allows researchers to carry out embryonic stem cell research and therapeutic cloning providing that an HFEA Licence Committee considers the use of embryos necessary or desirable for one of these purposes of research.

The Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001 was introduced to explicitly prohibit reproductive cloning in the UK, but it was repealed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008.

===Donor anonymity===
In 2004, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (Disclosure of Donor Information) Regulations 2004/1511, enabled donor-conceived children to access the identity of their sperm, egg or embryo donor upon reaching the age of 18.

The Regulations were implemented on 1 April 2005 and any donor who donated sperm, eggs or embryos from that date onwards is, by law, identifiable. Since that date, any person born as a result of donation is entitled to request and receive the donor&#x27;s name and last known address, once they reach the age of 18.

===European Union Tissues and Cells Directive===
The European Union Tissues and Cells Directives (EUTCD) introduced common safety and quality standards for human tissues and cells across the European Union (EU).

The purpose of the directives was to facilitate a safer and easier exchange of tissues and cells (including human eggs and sperm) between member states and to improve safety standards for European citizens. 
The EUTCD was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 2 March 2004 and published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 7 April 2004. Member States were obliged to comply with its provisions from 7 April 2006.

===Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008===
In 2005, the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee published a report on Human Reproductive Technologies and the Law.

This inquiry investigated the legislative framework provided by the 1990 Act and challenges presented by technological advance and &quot;recent changes in ethical and societal attitudes&quot;.
In light of the Committee&#x27;s report, and legislative changes that had already been made, the Department of Health undertook a review of the 1990 Act. They then held a public consultation based on their review of the Act, and following this published a White Paper, Review of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, within which Government presented its initial proposals to revise the legislation.

A Joint Committee of both houses scrutinised the Government&#x27;s recommendations, and provided its views on what ought to be the final form of the Bill to be brought to parliament.

The Bill was finally brought to the House of Lords in November 2007, passing through the House of Commons through Spring and Autumn of 2008, and finally receiving Royal Assent on 13 November 2008. 
The HFE Act 2008 updates the law to ensure it is fit for purpose in the 21st century. It is divided into three parts:

#amendments to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990
#parenthood
#miscellaneous and general.

The main new elements of the Act are:

*ensuring that the creation and use of all human embryos outside the body – whatever the process used in their creation – are subject to regulation
*a ban on selecting the sex of offspring for social reasons
*continuing to require that clinics take account of &quot;the welfare of the child&quot; when providing fertility treatment, and replacing the previous requirement that they also take account of the child&#x27;s &quot;need for a father&quot; with &quot;supportive parenting&quot;
*allowing for the recognition of both partners in a same-sex relationship as legal parents of children conceived through the use of donated sperm, eggs or embryos
*enabling people in same sex relationships and unmarried couples to apply for an order allowing for them to be treated as the parents of a child born using a surrogate
*changing restrictions on the use of data collected by the HFEA to make it easier to conduct research using this information
*provisions clarifying the scope of legitimate embryo research activities, including regulation of &quot;human admixed embryos&quot; (embryos combining both human and animal material).

==Current responsibilities==
The current statutory functions of the HFEA, as a regulator under the HFE Acts 1990 and 2008 and other legislation include:
*license and monitor clinics carrying out in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and donor insemination
*license and monitor establishments undertaking human embryo research
*maintain a register of licences held by clinics, research establishments and storage centres
*regulate storage of gametes (eggs and sperm) and embryos
*implement the requirements of the European Union Tissue and Cells Directive (EUTCD) to relicense IVF clinics and to license Intrauterine Insemination (IUI), Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT) and other services.

==Policy decisions==

*As of 2017, centres receiving sperm donation could distribute sperm to no more families than the number specified by the donor, and the donor could not specify more than ten.
*In October and November 2007, the HFEA decided on a policy to reduce multiple births from fertility treatment. This forms part of a wider national strategy to reduce the risk of multiple births from fertility treatment involving professional bodies, patient groups and NHS-funding bodies.

Multiple pregnancy is the single biggest risk to patients and children born as a result of fertility treatment. Women undergoing IVF treatment are twenty times more likely to have a multiple birth than if they conceive naturally.

After carefully considering views from clinics, patients and professional bodies, the HFEA decided to set a maximum multiple birth rate that clinics should not exceed, which will be lowered each year. All clinics will have their own strategy setting out how they will lower the multiple birth rate in their clinic by identifying the patients for whom single embryo transfer is the most appropriate treatment. The HFEA aims to reduce multiple births from IVF treatment to 10% over a period of years.

*In September 2007, after an extensive consultation with the UK public, the Authority decided that there is no fundamental reason to prevent cytoplasmic hybrid research. Individual research teams should be able to undertake research projects involving the creation of cytoplasmic hybrid embryos, provided that an HFEA Licence Committee is satisfied that their planned research is necessary and desirable. They must also meet the overall standards required by the HFEA for any embryo research. In January 2008, the HFEA granted licenses to Newcastle University and King&#x27;s College London to carry out cytoplasmic hybrid research projects
*In 2007 the Authority agreed to allow women to be able to donate their eggs to research projects, provided that there are strong safeguards in place to ensure the women are properly informed of the risks of the procedure and are properly protected from coercion
*In 2006, the HFEA approved in principle the screening of embryos for genes that may lead to certain cancers in middle age
*In 2005, the HFEA granted a licence to treat mitochondrial diseases by allowing researchers to attempt to create an embryo with two genetic mothers
*In 2004, the HFEA granted British scientists a licence to produce cloned human cells, making it only the second country in the world to permit such a procedure

<doc id="897564" wikidata="Q372906" url="?curid=897564" title="Yellow-crested cockatoo">
<text>The yellow-crested cockatoo (Cacatua sulphurea) also known as the lesser sulphur-crested cockatoo, is a medium-sized (about 34-cm-long) cockatoo with white plumage, bluish-white bare orbital skin, grey feet, a black bill, and a retractile yellow or orange crest. The sexes are similar.

The yellow-crested cockatoo is found in wooded and cultivated areas of East Timor and Indonesia&#x27;s islands of Sulawesi and the Lesser Sundas. It is easily confused with the larger and more common sulphur-crested cockatoo, which has a more easterly distribution and can be distinguished by the lack of pale yellow coloring on its cheeks (although some sulphur-cresteds develop yellowish patches). Also, the yellow-crested cockatoo&#x27;s crest is a brighter color, closer to orange. The citron-crested cockatoo, which used to be considered a subspecies of the yellow-crested cockatoo, is similar, but its crest is orange and it is endemic to Sumba.

The yellow-crested cockatoo&#x27;s diet consists mainly of seeds, buds, fruits, nuts, and herbaceous plants.

==Taxonomy==
In the 18th century, yellow-crested cockatoos were imported into Europe as pets and these birds were described by various naturalists. In 1738 English naturalist Eleazar Albin included a description and illustration of the &quot;Cockatoo or White crested parrot&quot; in his &quot;A Natural History of Birds&quot; based on a bird displayed at &quot;The Tiger&quot; tavern on Tower Hill in London. In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included &quot;Le Kakatoes à hupe jaune&quot; in his &quot;Onithologie&quot; based on a live bird that he had seen in Paris. Then in 1764, George Edwards included the &quot;Lesser white cockatoo with a yellow crest&quot; in his &quot;Gleanings of natural history&quot; from a pet bird kept at a home in Essex, and in 1779 French polymath Comte de Buffon included the bird in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot;.

When the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin revised and expanded Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1788 he included the yellow-crested cockatoo based on the accounts of earlier naturalists. He placed it with the parrots in the genus &quot;Psittacus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Psittacus sulphureus&quot;. The type locality is the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. The yellow-crested cockatoo is now one of 11 species placed in the genus &quot;Cacatua&quot; that was introduced in 1817 by Louis Pierre Vieillot.

=== Subspecies ===
According to the International Ornithological Congress, 5 subspecies are recognized:

* &quot;C. s. sulphurea&quot; (nominate subspecies) (Gmelin, JF, 1788) – Sulawesi and nearby islands (Muna and Buton)
* &quot;C. s. abbotti&quot; (Abbott&#x27;s yellow-crested cockatoo or simply known as Abbott&#x27;s cockatoo, &quot;Beka&quot;) (Oberholser, 1917) – Masakambing Island
* &quot;C. s. djampeana&quot; Hartert, E, 1897 – Tanah Jampea and Tukangbesi Islands
* &quot;C. s. occidentalis&quot; Hartert, E, 1898 – Western and central Lesser Sundas (Lombok, Sumbawa, Komodo, Padar, Rinca, Flores, Pantar and Alor)
* &quot;C. s. parvula&quot; (Timor yellow-crested cockatoo) (Bonaparte, 1850) – Central Lesser Sundas (Rote, Semau, and Timor)

Previously, only 4 of these were recognized, but &quot;djampeana&quot; and &quot;occidentalis&quot; were recognized in 2022 based on a 2014 phylogenetic study. The subspecies &quot;paulandrewi&quot;, thought to be endemic to the Tukangbesi Islands and also recognized in the 2014 study, is not recognized by the IOC.

Until 2023, the citron-crested cockatoo (&quot;Cacatua citrinocristata&quot;) was considered by the IOC to be a subspecies of yellow-crested cockatoo.

==Breeding==
The yellow-crested cockatoo nests in tree cavities. The eggs are white and usually two in a clutch. The incubation is shared by both parents. The eggs are incubated for about 28 days and the chicks leave the nest about 75 days after hatching.

==Status and conservation==

The yellow-crested cockatoo is critically endangered. Numbers have declined dramatically due to illegal trapping for the cage-bird trade. Between 1980 and 1992, over 100,000 of these birds were legally exported from Indonesia, yet a German proposal submitted to CITES to move it to Appendix I was not approved. It has since been moved to Appendix I. The current population is estimated at fewer than 2,500 individuals and is thought to be declining in number.

The subspecies &quot;C. s. abbotti&quot; is found only on the island of Masakambing. Its population on this tiny island (about 5 km2 or 1.9 mi2) had fallen to 10 as of June and July 2008. The decline results from trapping and logging, especially of mangroves (&quot;Avicennia apiculata&quot;) and kapok trees.

Several national parks their habitat, including Rawa Aopa Watumohai National Park on Sulawesi, Komodo National Park on Komodo Island, the national parks of Manupeu Tanah Daru and Laiwangi Wanggameti on Sumba, and the Nino Konis Santana National Park in East Timor (Timor-Leste).

==Introduced population==
An introduced population of these birds is found in Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s feral population is estimated to be around 200, 10% of the total wild population. They are a common sight across the densely populated area on both sides of the harbour, easily spotted in the woods and public parks in the north and west of Hong Kong Island. The large group has developed from some caged birds that have been released into the Hong Kong area over many years. An often repeated story is that Hong Kong Governor Sir Mark Aitchison Young released the Government House&#x27;s entire bird collection – including a large number of yellow-crested cockatoos – hours before surrendering Hong Kong to Japanese troops in December 1941. Historians and conservation biologists in Hong Kong have found no evidence to corroborate this story, and believe that Hong Kong&#x27;s yellow-crested cockatoo population is made up of escaped pets. The earliest record of an escaped yellow-crested cockatoo pet comes from 1959.

<doc id="897567" wikidata="Q1379223" url="?curid=897567" title="Insemination">
<text>Insemination is the introduction of sperm (in semen) into a female or hermaphrodite&#x27;s reproductive system in order to fertilize the ovum through sexual reproduction. The sperm enters into the uterus of a mammal or the oviduct of an oviparous (egg-laying) animal. Female humans and other mammals are inseminated during sexual intercourse or copulation, but can also be inseminated by artificial insemination.

In humans, the act and form of insemination has legal, moral and interpersonal implications. However, whether insemination takes place naturally or by artificial means, the pregnancy and the progress of it will be the same. Insemination may be called in vivo fertilisation (from &quot;in vivo&quot; meaning &quot;within the living&quot;) because an egg is fertilized inside the body, this is in contrast with in vitro fertilisation (IVF).

== Plants ==
In plants, the fertilization process is referred to as pollination. It is the process of transfer of pollen grains from one anther to the stigma of other plants.

==Natural insemination==

Insemination during sexual intercourse through penile–vaginal penetration is referred to as &quot;natural insemination&quot; (i.e., insemination by natural means). If an artificial lubricant needs to be used, care must be taken that it does not have spermicidal properties. During ejaculation, semen, containing male gametes known as sperm, is expelled from the penis through the male urethra into the moist and warm environment of the female reproductive tract. In humans, semen is usually ejaculated into the posterior vaginal fornix in direct contact with cervical mucus, though sperm may swim from other areas of the vagina or vulva to the cervix. The average volume of semen produced at ejaculation is 2 to 5 millilitres (about a teaspoon), containing an average of 182 million sperm. Only a small proportion of the sperm in each ejaculation reach the site of fertilization in the fallopian tubes, their numbers decreasing exponentially as they progress through the female reproductive tract. The majority of sperm either die in the acidic environment of the vagina or drip out with the semen. Prior to ovulation, the cervical mucus becomes thinner and more hospitable to sperm. Sperm swim rapidly into the uterus upon encountering cervical mucus, though many become lost in the cervical crypts where they either die or are delayed. Further attrition occurs in the uterus, where sperm are attacked by the female immune system. Only about 100–1000 sperm reach the fallopian tubes, where they may survive for up to six days. If ovulation occurs and the sperm encounter an ovum in the fallopian tube, fertilization may occur.

A woman may also be naturally inseminated while having penile–vaginal intercourse for pleasure without any intent to conceive. This may be unintentional as a result of the failure of a barrier or behavioural method of contraception, or may be intentional if relying on female contraceptive methods or indifferent to the possibility of pregnancy. In most cultures, insemination by a male through sexual intercourse, whether the woman&#x27;s husband, normal sex partner or not, is subject to social and sexual inhibitions and taboos, and has legal, moral and interpersonal implications.

The term is also used in the context of third-party insemination, where a male who is not the woman&#x27;s usual sexual partner (i.e., a sperm donor) fathers a child for the woman by providing his sperm through sexual intercourse rather than by providing his sperm for it to be used to produce a pregnancy in the woman by artificial means. The incidence of natural insemination by a sperm donor is usually a private matter, and may also carry greater health risks than where sperm has been processed by a fertility center. Advocates claim natural insemination generates higher pregnancy rates and a more &#x27;natural&#x27; conception which does not involve the intervention and intrusion of third parties. However, it has not been medically proven that natural insemination has an increased chance of pregnancy. Additionally, conceiving through natural insemination is considered a natural process, so the father may be liable for child support and have custody and other rights of the child. The law usually draws a distinction between a man fathering a child by natural means, and a man who provides his sperm for it to be used to father a child by artificial means (i.e. by artificial insemination).

==Artificial insemination==
Artificial insemination is the introduction of sperm into the reproductive tract of a female by means other than sexual intercourse for the purpose of impregnating the female. In humans, artificial insemination may be used when a woman or her normal sex partner cannot, for any of a number of reasons, conceive by natural means. A number of artificial insemination strategies are available, including intracervical insemination (ICI) and intrauterine insemination (IUI). Compared with natural insemination, artificial insemination may be more invasive, and may require professional assistance and medical expertise, which will have a higher cost.

ICI attempts to simulate natural insemination, without the sexual element. It is painless and is the simplest, easiest and most common method of artificial insemination; it can be performed in the home, either by the female on herself or with non-professional assistance. ICI involves the introduction of unwashed or raw semen into the vagina at the entrance to the cervix, usually by means of a needleless syringe.

The sperm for insemination may be provided either by a sexual partner of the female&#x27;s choice or by a sperm donor. Donor sperm is most commonly used by lesbian couples and single women, and by heterosexual couples when the male partner is suffering from male infertility. In some circumstances, sperm has been collected from males before they go off to war, or even right after they have died, and used to inseminate their female partners. In some countries, there are laws restricting and regulating who can donate sperm, who can receive artificial insemination, and what the legal consequences are of such insemination. Subject to any such restrictions, donor sperm is available to all women who want or need it. Women who live in a jurisdiction that prohibits them from being artificially inseminated may sometimes choose to obtain it by traveling to a jurisdiction that permits it.

Artificial insemination has been and continues to be commonly used in livestock breeding as an efficient way of increasing production.

==Other forms of insemination==
In various other animal species, sperm can be introduced into the female&#x27;s reproductive tract by various means. For example, in some species of hemiptera sperm can be introduced violently by traumatic insemination, injection through the body wall. In some species of animals, sperm finds its way through the body wall when the spermatophore is left in contact with the female&#x27;s skin, such as in the onychophora (velvet worms).

<doc id="897570" wikidata="Q457499" url="?curid=897570" title="Quba District (Azerbaijan)">
<text>Quba District (; ) is one of the 66 districts of Azerbaijan. Located in the northeast of the country, it belongs to the Guba-Khachmaz Economic Region. The district borders the districts of Qusar, Qabala, Ismayilli, Shamakhi, Shabran, and Khachmaz. Its capital and largest city is Quba. As of 2020, the district had a population of 173,400.

The fertile region surrounding Quba is best known for its production of apples and the city area of Quba is known for its fine carpets.

== History ==
Quba rose to prominence in the 18th century. In 1747, Nader Shah ruler of the Afsharid Dynasty was assassinated. That same year, Hussein-Ali, the Shah&#x27;s designated ruler of the region, decided to attempt to unify the Azeri khanates as an independent kingdom. One of his first moves was to relocate his capital from the less defensible Xudat in the Caspian lowlands to Quba where he built a fortress. Hussein-Ali died in 1757 and his son Fatali Khan carried on the expansion with Quba reaping the riches of its status as the capital. Some ruins from this period, such as Çirax Qala on the way to Baku, exist today.

However, upon Fatali Khan&#x27;s death in 1789, the city&#x27;s fortunes began to turn. In 1806, the khanate was occupied and soon absorbed by the Russian Empire. As a result, the city fell into the background of Azerbaijani history and politics.

The city is home to several historic buildings, including the Juma Mosque (Cuma Məscid or Friday Mosque), Ardabil Mosque (Ərdəbil Məscid) and old hamman (baths).

The region is home to Azerbaijan&#x27;s largest community of Mountain Jews in the community of Qırmızı Qəsəbə (formerly in , ), located just across the river from Quba City.

<doc id="897576" wikidata="Q192056" url="?curid=897576" title="Adder">
<text>Vipera berus, also known as the common European adder and the common European viper, is a species of venomous snake in the family Viperidae. The species is extremely widespread and can be found throughout much of Europe, and as far as East Asia. There are three recognised subspecies.

Known by a host of common names including common adder and common viper, the adder has been the subject of much folklore in Britain and other European countries. It is not regarded as especially dangerous; the snake is not aggressive and usually bites only when really provoked, stepped on, or picked up. Bites can be very painful, but are seldom fatal. The specific name, &quot;berus&quot;, is Neo-Latin and was at one time used to refer to a snake, possibly the grass snake, &quot;Natrix natrix&quot;.

The common adder is found in different terrains, habitat complexity being essential for different aspects of its behaviour. It feeds on small mammals, birds, lizards, and amphibians, and in some cases on spiders, worms, and insects. The common adder, like most other vipers, is ovoviviparous. Females breed once every two or three years, with litters usually being born in late summer to early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Litters range in size from three to 20 with young staying with their mothers for a few days. Adults grow to a total length (including tail) of and a mass of . Three subspecies are recognised, including the nominate subspecies, &quot;Vipera berus berus&quot; described here. The snake is not considered to be threatened, though it is protected in some countries.

==Taxonomy==
There are three subspecies of &quot;V. berus&quot; that are recognised as being valid including the nominotypical subspecies.
The subspecies &quot;V. b. bosniensis&quot; and &quot;V. b. sachalinensis&quot; have been regarded as full species in some recent publications.

The name &#x27;adder&#x27; is derived from &quot;nædre&quot;, an Old English word that had the generic meaning of serpent in the older forms of many Germanic languages. It was commonly used in the Old English version of the Christian Scriptures for the devil and the serpent in the Book of Genesis. In the 14th century, &#x27;a nadder&#x27; in Middle English was rebracketed to &#x27;an adder&#x27; (just as &#x27;a napron&#x27; became &#x27;an apron&#x27; and &#x27;a &quot;nompere&quot;″ changed into &#x27;an umpire&#x27;).

In keeping with its wide distribution and familiarity through the ages, &quot;Vipera berus&quot; has a large number of common names in English, which include:
:&quot;Common European adder&quot;, &quot;common European viper&quot;, &quot;European viper&quot;, &quot;northern viper&quot;, &quot;adder&quot;, &quot;common adder&quot;, &quot;crossed viper&quot;, &quot;European adder&quot;, &quot;common viper&quot;, &quot;European common viper&quot;, &quot;cross adder&quot;, or &quot;common cross adder&quot;.

In Welsh, it is called &quot;gwiber&quot;, a name derived from Latin &quot;vīpera&quot;. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, the snake is known as &quot;hugorm&quot;, &quot;hoggorm&quot; and &quot;huggorm&quot;, roughly translated as &#x27;striking snake&#x27;. In Finland, it is known as &quot;kyykäärme&quot; or simply &quot;kyy&quot;, in Estonia it is known as &quot;rästik&quot;, while in Lithuania it is known as &quot;angis&quot;. In Poland the snake is called &quot;żmija zygzakowata,&quot; which translates as &#x27;zigzag viper&#x27;, due to the pattern on its back.

==Description==
Relatively thick-bodied, adults usually grow to in total length (including tail), with an average of . Maximum size varies by region. The largest, at over , are found in Scandinavia; specimens of have been observed there on two occasions. In France and Great Britain, the maximum size is . Mass ranges from to about .

The head is fairly large and distinct and its sides are almost flat and vertical. The edge of the snout is usually raised into a low ridge. Seen from above, the rostral scale is not visible, or only just. Immediately behind the rostral, there are two (rarely one) small scales.

Dorsally, there are usually five large plates: a squarish frontal (longer than wide, sometimes rectangular), two parietals (sometimes with a tiny scale between the frontal and the parietals), and two long and narrow supraoculars. The latter are large and distinct, each separated from the frontal by one to four small scales. The nostril is situated in a shallow depression within a large nasal scale.

The eye is relatively large—equal in size or slightly larger than the nasal scale—but often smaller in females. Below the supraoculars are six to 13 (usually eight to 10) small circumorbital scales. The temporal scales are smooth (rarely weakly keeled). There are 10–12 sublabials and six to 10 (usually eight or 9) supralabials. Of the latter, the numbers 3 and 4 are the largest, while 4 and 5 (rarely 3 and 4) are separated from the eye by a single row of small scales (sometimes two rows in alpine specimens).

Midbody there are 21 dorsal scales rows (rarely 19, 20, 22, or 23). These are strongly keeled scales, except for those bordering the ventral scales. These scales seem loosely attached to the skin and lower rows become increasingly wide; those closest to the ventral scales are twice as wide as the ones along the midline. The ventral scales number 132–150 in males and 132–158 in females. The anal plate is single. The subcaudals are paired, numbering 32–46 in males and 23–38 in females.

The colour pattern varies, ranging from very light-coloured specimens with small, incomplete, dark dorsal crossbars to entirely brown ones with faint or clear, darker brown markings, and on to melanistic individuals that are entirely dark and lack any apparent dorsal pattern. However, most have some kind of zigzag dorsal pattern down the entire length of their bodies and tails. The head usually has a distinctive dark V or X on the back. A dark streak runs from the eye to the neck and continues as a longitudinal series of spots along the flanks.

Unusually for snakes, it is often possible to distinguish the sexes by their colour. Females are usually brownish in hue with dark-brown markings, the males are pure grey with black markings. The basal colour of males will often be slightly lighter than that of the females, making the black zigzag pattern stand out. The melanistic individuals are often females.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Vipera berus&quot; has a wide range. It can be found across the Eurasian land-mass; from northwestern Europe (Great Britain, Belgium, Netherlands, Scandinavia, Germany, France) across southern Europe (Italy, Serbia, Albania, Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, and northern Greece) and eastern Europe to north of the Arctic Circle, and Russia to the Pacific Ocean, Sakhalin Island, North Korea, northern Mongolia and northern China. It is found farther north than any other snake species. The type locality was originally listed as &#x27;Europa&#x27;. Mertens and Müller (1940) proposed restricting the type locality to Uppsala, Sweden and it was eventually restricted to Berthåga, Uppsala by designation of a neotype by Krecsák &amp; Wahlgren (2008).

In several European countries, it is notable as being the only native venomous snake. It is one of only three snake species native to Britain. The other two, the barred grass snake and the smooth snake, are non-venomous.

Sufficient habitat complexity is a crucial requirement for the presence of this species, in order to support its various behaviours—basking, foraging, and hibernation—as well as to offer some protection from predators and human harassment. It is found in a variety of habitats, including: chalky downs, rocky hillsides, moors, sandy heaths, meadows, rough commons, edges of woods, sunny glades and clearings, bushy slopes and hedgerows, dumps, coastal dunes, and stone quarries. It will venture into wetlands if dry ground is available nearby and thus may be found on the banks of streams, lakes, and ponds.

In much of southern Europe, such as southern France and northern Italy, it is found in either low lying wetlands or at high altitudes. In the Swiss Alps, it may ascend to about . In Hungary and Russia, it avoids open steppeland; a habitat in which &quot;V. ursinii&quot; is more likely to occur. In Russia, however, it does occur in the forest steppe zone.

===Conservation status===

In Great Britain, it is illegal to kill, injure, harm or sell adders under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The same situation applies to Norway under the (The Wildlife Act 1981) and Denmark (1981). In Finland (Nature Conservation Act 9/2023) killing an adder is legal if it&#x27;s not possible to capture and transfer it to another location and the same provision also applies in Sweden. The common viper is categorised as &#x27;endangered&#x27; in Switzerland, and is also protected in some other countries in its range. It is also found in many protected areas.

This species is listed as protected (Appendix III) under the Berne Convention.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species describes the conservation status as of &#x27;least concern&#x27; in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, broad range of habitats, and likely slow rate of decline though it acknowledges the population to be decreasing. Reduction in habitat for a variety of reasons, fragmentation of populations in Europe due to intense agriculture practices, and collection for the pet trade or for venom extraction have been recorded as major contributing factors for its decline. A citizen science based survey in the UK found evidence of extensive population declines in the UK, especially affecting smaller populations. A combination of public pressure and disturbance, habitat fragmentation and poor habitat management were considered the most likely causes of the decline. The release of 47 million non-native pheasants and 10 million partridges each year by countryside estates has also been suggested to have a significant impact on adder populations across the UK, with the possibility the reptile could be extinct by 2032.
==Behaviour==

This species is mainly diurnal, especially in the north of its range. Further south it is said to be active in the evening, and it may even be active at night during the summer months. It is predominantly a terrestrial species, although it has been known to climb up banks and into low bushes in order to bask or search for prey.

Adders are not usually aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are generally bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, presumably to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these turn out to be pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.

The species is cold-adapted and hibernates in the winter. In Great Britain, males and females hibernate for about 150 and 180 days, respectively. In northern Sweden hibernation lasts 8–9 months. On mild winter days, they may emerge to bask where the snow has melted and will often travel across snow. About 15% of adults and 30–40% of juveniles die during hibernation.

==Feeding==

Their diet consists mainly of small mammals, such as mice, rats, voles, and shrews, as well as lizards. Sometimes, slow worms are taken, and even weasels and moles. Adders also feed on amphibians, such as frogs, newts, and salamanders. Birds are also reported to be consumed, especially nestlings and even eggs, for which they will climb into shrubbery and bushes. Generally, diet varies depending on locality. 

Juveniles will eat nestling mammals, small lizards and frogs as well as worms and spiders. One important dietary source for young adders is the alpine salamander (&quot;salamadra atra&quot;). Because both species live at higher altitudes, &quot;S. atra&quot; could be a prevalent food source for adders, since there may be few other animals. One study suggests that alpine salamanders could consist of almost half of the adders&#x27; diets in some locations. They have been witnessed swallowing these salamanders in the early morning hours. Once they reach about in length, their diet begins to resemble that of the adults.

==Reproduction==
In Hungary, mating takes place in the last week of April, whilst in the north it happens later (in the second week of May). Mating has also been observed in June and even early October, but it is not known if this autumn mating results in any offspring. Females often breed once every two years, or even once every three years if the seasons are short and the climate is not conducive.

Males find females by following their scent trails, sometimes tracking them for hundreds of metres a day. If a female is found and then flees, the male follows. Courtship involves side-by-side parallel &#x27;flowing&#x27; behaviour, tongue flicking along the back and excited lashing of the tail. Pairs stay together for one or two days after mating. Males chase away their rivals and engage in combat. Often, this also starts with the aforementioned flowing behaviour before culminating in the dramatic &#x27;adder dance&#x27;. In this act, the males confront each other, raise up the front part of the body vertically, make swaying movements and attempt to push each other to the ground. This is repeated until one of the two becomes exhausted and crawls off to find another mate. Appleby (1971) notes that he has never seen an intruder win one of these contests, as if the frustrated defender is so aroused by courtship that he refuses to lose his chance to mate. There is no record of any biting taking place during these bouts.

Females usually give birth in August or September, but sometimes as early as July, or as late as early October. Litters range in size from 3 to 20. The young are usually born encased in a transparent sac from which they must free themselves. Sometimes, they succeed in freeing themselves from this membrane while still inside the female.

Neonates measure in total length (including tail), with an average total length of . They are born with a fully functional venom apparatus and a reserve supply of yolk within their bodies. They shed their skins for the first time within a day or two. Females do not appear to take much interest in their offspring, but the young have been observed to remain near their mothers for several days after birth.

==Venom==
Because of the rapid rate of human expansion throughout the range of this species, bites are relatively common. Domestic animals and livestock are frequent victims. In Great Britain, most instances occur in March–October. In Sweden, there are about 1,300 bites a year, with an estimated 12% that require hospitalisation. At least eight different antivenoms are available against bites from this species.

Mallow et al. (2003) describe the venom toxicity as being relatively low compared to other viper species. They cite Minton (1974) who reported the values for mice to be 0.55 mg/kg IV, 0.80 mg/kg IP and 6.45 mg/kg SC. As a comparison, in one test the minimum lethal dose of venom for a guinea pig was 40–67 mg, but only 1.7 mg was necessary when &quot;Daboia russelii&quot; venom was used. Brown (1973) gives a higher subcutaneous LD50 range of 1.0–4.0 mg/kg. All agree that the venom yield is low: Minton (1974) mentions 10–18 mg for specimens in length, while Brown (1973) lists only 6 mg.
Relatively speaking, bites from this species are not highly dangerous. In Britain there were only 14 known fatalities between 1876 and 2005—the last a 5-year-old child in 1975—and one nearly fatal bite of a 39-year-old woman in Essex in 1998. An 82-year-old woman died following a bite in Germany in 2004, although it is not clear whether her death was due to the effect of the venom. A 44-year-old British man was left seriously ill after he was bitten by an adder in the Dalby Forest, Yorkshire, in 2014. Even so, professional medical help should always be sought as soon as possible after any bite. Very occasionally bites can be life-threatening, particularly in small children, while adults may experience discomfort and disability long after the bite. The length of recovery varies, but may take up to a year. 

Local symptoms include immediate and intense pain, followed after a few minutes (but perhaps by as much as 30 minutes) by swelling and a tingling sensation. Blisters containing blood are not common. The pain may spread within a few hours, along with tenderness and inflammation. Reddish lymphangitic lines and bruising may appear, and the whole limb can become swollen and bruised within 24 hours. Swelling may also spread to the trunk, and with children, throughout the entire body. Necrosis and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.

Systemic symptoms resulting from anaphylaxis can be dramatic. These may appear within 5 minutes post bite, or can be delayed for many hours. Such symptoms include nausea, retching and vomiting, abdominal colic and diarrhoea, incontinence of urine and faeces, sweating, fever, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, blindness, shock, angioedema of the face, lips, gums, tongue, throat and epiglottis, urticaria and bronchospasm. If left untreated, these symptoms may persist or fluctuate for up to 48 hours. In severe cases, cardiovascular failure may occur.

==In culture and beliefs==
Adders were believed to be deaf, which is mentioned in Psalm 58 (v. 4), but snake oil made from them was used as a cure for deafness and earache. Females were thought to swallow their young when threatened and regurgitate them unharmed later. It was believed that they did not die until sunset. Remedies for adder &quot;stings&quot; included killing the snake responsible and rubbing the corpse or its fat on the wound, also holding a pigeon or chicken on the bite, or jumping over water. Adders were thought to be attracted to hazel trees and repelled by ash trees.

Druids believed that large frenzied gatherings of adders occurred in spring, at the centre of which could be found a polished rock called an adder stone or &quot;Glain Neidr&quot; in the Welsh language. These stones were said to have held supernatural powers.

<doc id="897583" wikidata="Q313088" url="?curid=897583" title="Lance Klusener">
<text>Lance Klusener (born 4 September 1971) is an international cricket coach and former cricketer of South Africa. He was known for his aggressive batting and fast-medium swing bowling. Klusener was one of the best all-rounders in the world during 1990s and early 2000s and one of the pioneers of power batting as a finisher. He was popular for his ferocious batting, ability to hit the deck hard and ability to take wickets on crunch situations and break partnerships.

He is nicknamed &quot;Zulu&quot; because of his fluency in the Zulu language. Since his retirement he has occasionally commentated on cricket in both Zulu and Xhosa.

In September 2019, Klusener was appointed as the head coach of the Afghanistan national cricket team.

== Early life ==
Klusener grew up on a sugarcane farm north of Empangeni, attending Kwambonambi primary school with Zulu children. He later attended Durban High School and broke into the school&#x27;s first team only in his final year. He also underwent military service for three years which contributed to a straightforward approach to his bowling. The manager of Natal Denis Carlstein identified the potential in his bowling and he recommended Klusener to attend the provincial nets. He was later spotted by the West Indian fast bowler Malcolm Marshall who was then Natal&#x27;s overseas player in the first-class cricket season. Klusener was drafted into Natal&#x27;s first XI in 1993/94 season and was mentored by Malcolm Marshall.

==Career==
===Domestic career===
Klusener played for KwaZulu-Natal (Nashua Dolphins) in the domestic level in South Africa between 1991 and 2004. In 2004, Northamptonshire County Cricket Club signed him on a contract running until late 2008. At Wantage Road he impressed with his fired-up seam bowling and his hard-hitting in the low middle-order. Due to family bereavements back home, it was announced that his contract with the county would not be renewed at the end of the 2008 season. In late 2007, he started playing in the Indian Cricket League Twenty20 tournament in India for the Kolkata Tigers team.

===International career===
Klusener made his ODI debut on 19 January 1996 against England. He made his Test debut for South Africa against India in Calcutta during the second Test in 1996/97. At the time playing primarily as a bowler, Klusener took some hammering in the first innings at the hands of Mohammad Azharuddin, who at one point hit him for five consecutive fours, but Klusener returned what would remain career-best figures of eight for 64 in the second. On his test debut he picked 8 wicket haul in a flat pitch in Kolkata, and he led from the front especially after Allan Donald had broken down. His bowling figures of 8/64 is regarded as the best bowling figures by a South African bowler in an innings on test debut.

In his fourth test appearance, he registered the then fastest-ever test century by a South African in test cricket when he raced to the milestone off 100 balls against India at Cape Town in January 1997. It was also his maiden test century, as he achieved it while batting at no 9 position. He was initially selected to the South African squad for the 50 over cricket tournament at the 1998 Commonwealth Games but he later withdrew from the tournament without featuring in any of the games and was subsequently replaced by Alan Dawson. He also raised his game in test cricket further by scoring 174 against England in a drawn test match in Port Elizabeth in December 1999 and he was awarded the player of the match.

Klusener is remembered for his contributions in One Day Internationals, in which he was a hard hitting batsman and was voted as Man of the Tournament during the 1999 World Cup. He showed glimpses of his big-hitting in the years leading to the 1999 World Cup. His baseball-style backlift and thunderous hitting lit up the tournament and nearly took South Africa to the final. He was also voted as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 2000.

His international career tapered off after this, mainly due to persistent ankle injuries, as well as a public dispute with the then South African captain Graeme Smith, who at a breakfast meeting shortly after his appointment to the captaincy, in which he described Klusener as a &quot;disruptive force&quot; to the younger players within the South African national cricket team. The quote ended up in the South African press. Later Klusener and Smith patched up their differences.

He had scored 1,906 runs in 49 matches with a highest score of 174 and took 80 wickets with best figures of 8/64 in test matches. He scored 3,576 runs in 171 ODI matches at an average of 41.1 with a highest score of 103 and took 192 wickets with a best of 6/49. He has most fifers for South Africa in ODIs with 6.

===1999 World Cup===
In the 1999 Cricket World Cup, South Africa had progressed to the semi-finals, and Klusener until then had an excellent tournament, taking 17 wickets and scoring 250 runs (including two half centuries) in 8 matches and building a reputation as a hard-hitting batsman in tight situations. During the 1999 World Cup, he remained not out in five consecutive innings which yielded 214 runs without being dismissed. His streak was finally ended by Gavin Larsen in the Super Six stage match against New Zealand when he was dismissed for the first time in the tournament after scoring just four runs. His finishing prowess before the New Zealand match prompted the team to promote him to no 3 position in the match against New Zealand but it backfired.

During the World Cup, he was dismissed only on two occasions out of the eight innings in which he played and averaged 142.50 in those eight innings. He still holds the record for not having dismissed in most consecutive innings in World Cup matches. Due to his all-round performances with the bat and ball during the World Cup, he topped the ICC rankings for allrounders with a rating of 521 points. He showed his temperament in every matches for South Africa either with the bat and ball with performances including 12* &amp; 3/66 against India, 52* off 45 balls &amp; 3/21 against Sri Lanka, 48* and 1/16 against England, DNB &amp; 5/21 against Kenya, 52* and 1/35 against Zimbabwe, 46* and 1/41 against Pakistan, 4 &amp; 2/46 against New Zealand, 36 &amp; 1/53 against Australia (Super Six), 31* off 16 balls &amp; 0/50 against Australia in the semi-final. The only time he went wicketless in the tournament was the semi-final against Australia as he was always amongst the wickets. He was praised for his baseball-style backlift throughout the tournament. He had a strike rate of 163 in last 10 overs of 1999 WC.

He won four Man of the Match awards out of the nine matches South Africa played in the tournament. The four awards were consecutive with respect to South Africa&#x27;s wins (one match in between was won by Zimbabwe). The only other South African to win Man of the Match award in this tournament was Jacques Kallis. He was criticized for his knock in a losing cause against Zimbabwe taking 58 balls to score 52 and when South Africa were bowled out for 185, he was stranded in the crease without being dismissed. His opposite number Neil Johnson who also took 1999 World Cup on storm had engineered Zimbabwe&#x27;s win of the tournament against South Africa with his all-round display scoring 76 runs and taking 3/27.

His teammate Herschelle Gibbs let Klusener down when the former dropped an easy catch of Steve Waugh off Klusener&#x27;s bowling in the last Super Six match, which proved out to be the turning point of the match. Waugh eventually scored a match-winning century remaining unbeaten on 120, as Australia won in the last over of the contest with two balls to spare.

The second semi-final was played between Australia and South Africa in Edgbaston, England. Australia, having been put in to bat, set a target of 214 for South Africa to chase in 50 overs. Klusener came in to bat when South Africa were 175/6 in 44.5 overs, and his big-hitting along with support from other batsmen helped South Africa enter the final over at 205/9, needing nine runs to win with only one wicket remaining. The two batsmen at the crease were Klusener (on strike) and Allan Donald.

Klusener scored consecutive fours on the first two balls of the over (bowled by Damien Fleming), levelling the scores and leaving South Africa with only 1 run to win in 4 balls with Klusener on strike. The third ball was a dot, and Donald narrowly escaped getting run out when he backed out too far and tried to get back to his crease. The fourth saw Klusener mis-hit his shot to mid-wicket fielder Mark Waugh. Klusener went for the run, although chances of a run-out were high and two balls were still remaining. However, Donald at the other end, keeping his eyes on the ball and hoping to avoid another mix-up like in the last delivery, did not see Klusener sprinting down the pitch and did not hear the call to run, and Klusener was almost at the bowler&#x27;s end by the time Donald (who had also dropped his bat) began running. By then, Waugh had thrown the ball to Fleming, who rolled it to Adam Gilchrist who took the bails off at the other end, meaning Donald was run-out by some distance, thus ending the match with the scores level. However, a tie meant that Australia progressed to the final since they had beaten South Africa in the group stages of the tournament. As commentator Bill Lawry put it during the final ball:

 &quot;...this will be out surely – oh it&#x27;s out, it&#x27;s gonna be run out...oh, that is South Africa out – Donald did not run, I cannot believe it. Australia go into the World Cup Final – ridiculous running with two balls to go. Donald did not go, Klusener came – what a disappointing end for South Africa.&quot; 

Australia went on to win the tournament, but Klusener was voted the &quot;Player of the Series&quot;.

In 2014, Klusener stated in an interview that Donald was not to blame for what happened. Klusener stated that he became impatient and, although he made it to the bowler&#x27;s end, there was genuinely no run. After the match, he was cross at himself and regretted making that run.

=== Post 1999 World Cup ===
After a breakthrough World Cup tournament, many expected him to continue his strong performance from him for South Africa. He was named in South African squad for the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy. However, he struggled for consistency in the tours of West Indies in 2000/01 and Australia in 2001/02 which forced him out of the team for a while. He then got a recall to the South African team for both the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy and 2003 World Cup. He performed decently, despite South Africa&#x27;s group stage exit from the 2003 World Cup tournament.

He was subsequently snubbed from the side for the tour of England in 2003 which raised questions about his future in the game. His omission from the English test tour of 2003 was nothing short of controversy as he took legal action against United Cricket Board of South Africa for loss of earnings as he turned down the County cricket offers after being assured of a spot in the test side. Later, United Cricket Board of South Africa and Klusener both swept the legal battle under the carpet and ended their differences.

He was again available for selection following the end of disputes and was picked for the ODI series against the West Indies in 2003/04. He also received a test recall for the tour of Sri Lanka in 2004. He was also included for the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy. He retired from international cricket in 2004.

== Coaching career ==
Klusener severed all ties with the Indian Cricket League in late 2009 and then completed a Level-three coaching course provided by Cricket South Africa in Spring 2010. He has also worked closely with the South African High Performance Program and also worked with the South Africa A cricket team.

Klusener confirmed he was in negotiations with the Bangladesh Cricket Board about becoming the team bowling coach. However, in early September 2010 the Bangladesh Cricket Board confirmed that they were still awaiting a response from Klusener. Klusener had finally turned down the offer to take over as Bangladesh&#x27;s bowling coach, replacing Sri Lanka&#x27;s Champaka Ramanayake. Klusener was reportedly unable to convince his wife about a permanent move to Bangladesh.

From 2012 until 2016, he was head coach of the Dolphins, whom he represented in domestic cricket during his playing career, Klusener reportedly took over the coaching job from Graham Ford during the mid domestic season in 2012 as the latter resigned midway and departed to Sri Lanka to coach the Sri Lankan national side. In February 2016, his contract with Dolphins was terminated and was told that his contract would not be renewed which also triggered Klusener to seek an arbitration proceeding over the manner of his dismissal from the Dolphins franchise.

In 2016, he started as a batting coach for the Zimbabwe national team and served in the position until 2018. He also coached the Lyca Kovai Kings in the Tamil Nadu Premier League.

In 2018, he was appointed as the head coach of Rajshahi Kings in the Bangladesh Premier League replacing Daniel Vettori.

He was named as consultant coach for Delhi team ahead of the 2018–19 Ranji Trophy season. He also served as the batting coach of Mumbai Indians and has also coached Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League.

In 2019, he served in an interim capacity as the assistant batting coach of South Africa for the away T20I series against India.

In July 2019, Klusener was appointed as the head coach of the Glasgow Giants for the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament.

In September 2019, Klusener was appointed as the head coach of the Afghanistan national cricket team replacing Phil Simmons. He stepped down from the post after the 2021 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup. Overall, under Klusener&#x27;s tenure, Afghanistan won one out of three Test matches, three out of six ODIs and nine out of fourteen T20 internationals.

In December 2020, it was announced that he would serve as team director of Bangla Tigers during the 2021 T10 League.

In January 2022, Klusener was appointed as the head coach of the Khulna Tigers in the Bangladesh Premier League In 2022, it was reported that he initially applied for the role of head coach of Sri Lankan men&#x27;s cricket team but after being shortlisted by Sri Lanka Cricket as one of the candidates, he pulled out at the eleventh hour citing personal reasons.

In March 2022, he was reappointed as batting coach of Zimbabwe men&#x27;s national team.Currently he is the coach of the cricket team of Tripura, a north eastern state of India.
He is one of the assistant coach of IPL team Lucknow Super Giants.
