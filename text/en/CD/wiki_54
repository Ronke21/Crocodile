<text>Insect collecting refers to the collection of insects and other arthropods for scientific study or as a hobby. Most insects are small and the majority cannot be identified without the examination of minute morphological characters, so entomologists often make and maintain insect collections. Very large collections are preserved in natural history museums or universities where they are maintained and studied by specialists. Many college courses require students to form small collections. There are also amateur entomologists and collectors who keep collections.

Historically, insect collecting has been widespread and was in the Victorian age a very popular educational hobby. Insect collecting has left traces in European cultural history, literature and songs (e.g., Georges Brassens&#x27;s &quot;La chasse aux papillons&quot; (&quot;The Hunt for Butterflies&quot;)). The practice is particularly common among Japanese youths.

==Capture and kill techniques==


Insects may be passively caught using traps such as funnels, pitfall traps, bottle traps, malaise traps, or flight interception traps, some of which are baited with small bits of sweet foods (such as honey). Entomologists collecting nocturnal insects (especially moths) during faunistic survey studies might utilize ultraviolet light traps such as the Robinson trap. Aspirators, sometimes called &quot;pooters&quot;, suck up insects too small or delicate to handle with fingers.

Active capture of insects often involves using nets. Aerial insect nets are used to collect flying insects. The bag of a butterfly net is generally constructed from a lightweight mesh to minimize damage to delicate butterfly wings. Sweep nets are more rugged, and used to collect insects from grass and brush. A sweep net is swept back and forth through vegetation quickly turning the opening from side to side and following a shallow figure eight pattern. The collector walks forward while sweeping, and the net is moved through plants and grasses with force. Sweeping continues for some distance and then the net is flipped over, with the bag hanging over the rim, trapping the insects until they can be removed. Other types of nets used for collecting insects include beating nets and aquatic nets. Leaf litter sieves are used by coleopterists and to collect larvae.

Once collected, insects must be killed before they damage themselves trying to escape. Killing jars are used on hard-bodied insects. Soft-bodied insects, such as those in the larval stage, are generally fixed in a vial containing an ethanol and water solution.

==Storage and curation==

There are several different preservation methods that are used; some of which include: dried preservation (pinning), liquid preservation, or slide mounts. Another (now mostly historical) approach is caterpillar inflation, where the innards were removed and the skin dried. Pinning is by far the most common form of insect preservation.

It is better to pin an insect that has died recently enough that it has not dried yet, because it allows the thoracic muscles to adhere to the pin. Previously dried specimens must have glue applied to the pin location to avoid spinning. The large majority of the time insects are pinned vertically through their mesothorax and slightly off-center to the right of the mid-line. The pin should sit with 1/4 of the pin above the insect as to allow enough room for labels to be readable underneath.

When pinning insects with wings, it is important to display them properly: Lepidoptera wings should always be spread. When drying insects with wings such as butterflies, setting paper is used to position the wings.

Orthopteroids often have their left wings spread. In scientific collections, the insect&#x27;s wings, legs, and antenna are tucked underneath it to conserve space.

When point-mounting small insects the insect is glued to a small piece of non acidic, triangle paper. When drying an insect the relaxed insect is spread out accordingly using pins on a foam block where it can dry and retain its positioning.

When labeling insects the labels are presented in this order top down: Locality, additional locality/voucher label/accession numbers, insect identification.

== Insect pins ==


Insect pins are used by entomologists for mounting insect specimens.

As standard, they are long and come in sizes from 000 (the smallest diameter), through 00, 0, and 1, to 8 (the largest diameter).
The most generally useful size in entomology is size 2, which is in diameter, with sizes 1 and 3 being the next most useful.

They were once commonly made from brass or silver, but these would corrode from contact with insect bodies and are no longer commonly used.
Instead they are nickel-plated brass, yielding &quot;white&quot; or &quot;black&quot; enamelling, or even made from stainless steel.
Similarly, the smallest sizes from 000 to 1 used to be impractical for mounting until plastic and polyethylene became commonly used for pinning bases.

There are also &quot;micropins&quot;, which are long.
&quot;minutens&quot; are headless micropins that are generally only made of stainless steel, used for double-mounting, where the insect is mounted on the minuten, which is pinned to a small block of soft material, which is in turn mounted on a standard, larger, insect pin.

===Pinning of entomological specimens===

*Entomological pins. Continental pins, so called for historical reasons, are used internationally by museums and collectors. They are made of stainless steel for preference, especially for very long-term storage of specimens, but blackened steel also is used. The pins have round plastic or solid metal heads. Continental pins are of a standard length (40mm), but they are available in thicknesses numbered 000 (the thinnest), 00, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (the thickest). This standard pin length is sufficient to accommodate an adequate number of data labels and to permit convenient handling with suitably curved forceps or tweezers, referred to as &#x27;entomological forceps&#x27;.
As an exception to this standard, there also are pins of size 7, extra-long and very strong pins for very large beetles; they are 52mm long and thicker than size 6 pins. 
*Direct pinning. Direct pinning is the insertion of an entomological pin directly through the thorax of a specimen. The insects are pinned vertically through the thorax with a suitably sized pin, but by convention they are &quot;not&quot; pinned on the midline, but to the right, so as to leave at least one side undamaged.
*Point. A point is a triangular piece of white card. Specially designed point punches permit the production of large numbers of points of standard sizes as required. To use a point, a pin is inserted through the broad base of the triangle. To mount the specimen, a tiny amount of glue is placed on the tip and applied to the right side of the insect&#x27;s thorax. If appropriate the tip of the point may be bent at the necessary angle to hold the body of the specimen horizontal when the pin is vertical, with the long axis of the insect at right angles to the point.
*Minuten pins. Insect pins without heads, 12mm long. They are used for double mounting (staging) very small insects. They also may be used profitably for staging insects of moderate size, where they have the advantage of being less damaging to the specimen. For best effect in that respect, the pin is inserted from below through the staging card, well into the thorax, but not all the way through. Alternatively the minuten pin can be inserted laterally into one side of the thorax, again preferably not all the way through.
*Carding. Insects (especially Coleoptera and Hemiptera) are glued to rectangular pieces of acid free card or Bristol board providing a stage. Typical sizes are 4.5 x 11 mm;5 x 14 mm;6 x 17 mm;10 x 21 mm;13 x 30 mm. Printed lines allow uniform placement of the entomological pin. Though this is convenient, it is dubious practice at best, because it obscures features that might be necessary for taxonomic or morphological studies. In any case, at the very least the glue should be sufficiently conveniently soluble to be removed with solvents when necessary. With such considerations in mind, Canada balsam is about as good an adhesive as any. 

*Staging. When specimens are mounted on a smaller support which in turn is supported on a normal full-sized entomological pin, this is called staging. For example a specimen might be mounted on a minuten pin, typically being pinned on its side (lateral pinning) or upright (direct pinning) with the minuten pin driven into a stage, a strip of suitable material such as dried plant pith or plastic foam supported in a horizontal position on the main entomological pin; as a rule a number 3 pin is convenient. Other forms of stage include card mounts and point mounts. 
:The stage usually is positioned at such a distance up the vertical stage-pin, as to put the specimen at the same height as a directly pinned insect; this normally allows room for labels beneath and to allow handling of the specimen without damage. 
:If insects are side-pinned by pins that pass right through the specimens, then the minuten should be at such an angle that different features are damaged on the opposite sides of the thorax. Competent staging protects small specimens and displays most features conveniently. The stage-pin then is easy to manipulate when moving the specimen and the stage absorbs vibrations.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Pokémon&quot; creator Satoshi Tajiri&#x27;s childhood hobby of insect collecting is the inspiration behind the popular video game series.

A beetle collection becomes a source of fascination for a mentally disturbed woman in Chapter XI of MacKinlay Kantor&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;Andersonville&quot; (1955).

<doc id="889730" wikidata="Q5292175" url="?curid=889730" title="Don Atchison">
<text>Donald James Atchison (born March 1, 1952) is a Canadian politician who was Mayor of Saskatoon, the largest city in the central Canadian province of Saskatchewan, from 2003 to 2016. Atchison was elected mayor four times, tied for the most after mayoral terms were extended beyond one year in 1954. When he lost his bid for a fifth term in 2016, he left office as the longest-serving mayor in the city&#x27;s history at 13 years.

== Early life ==
Atchison was born and raised in Saskatoon, where he attended Queen Elizabeth and Holliston Elementary School, Walter Murray Collegiate, and the University of Saskatchewan. He developed an early interest in politics and joined his high school student council in grade 12; running for the position of sports representative, he campaigned by wearing sports equipment to class daily. He was a standout ice hockey goaltender from an early age, and he played junior hockey for the Saskatoon Blades in the 1971–72 season. In 1972, Atchison was drafted by the NHL&#x27;s Pittsburgh Penguins. Although he did not ultimately play in the NHL, Atchison had a brief professional career in the United States before returning to Saskatoon and joining the family business, the men&#x27;s wear store Atch &amp; Co. He was offered a role in the 1977 hockey film Slap Shot, but turned the opportunity down, thinking it was a joke.

== Political career ==

=== Saskatoon city councillor ===
Atchison was first elected to Saskatoon&#x27;s city council in 1994 as councillor for the newly created Ward 10, and was re-elected in 1997 and acclaimed in 2000. He was well known for his campaigning style of standing on street corners and waving at passing motorists, a tactic that was eventually outlawed. He sought initially to bring a business perspective to city government. In 1996, he infamously brought forward a heavily derided proposal from local consultant Henry Feldkamp to enclose much of downtown Saskatoon in an $80 million, 10-storey climate-controlled glass atrium dubbed the &quot;Atreos.&quot;

=== Mayor of Saskatoon ===
Atchison was first elected as mayor on October 22, 2003 in a close four-way contest, unseating incumbent Jim Maddin. He became just the second Saskatoon mayor to have been born in the city. Atchison ran on a platform that included being tough on crime, freezing property taxes, centralizing control of city management, and resuming control of the city&#x27;s police commission. After his election as mayor, he briefly required citizens visiting the Mayor&#x27;s office to be formally dressed, but the policy was dropped after being widely criticized and noted as a potential conflict of interest, given Atchison&#x27;s involvement with the family men&#x27;s wear store. The policy was targeted by comedian Rick Mercer, who sponsored an online contest in 2004 that went on to name Atchison &quot;Canada&#x27;s Craziest Mayor,&quot; a title he jokingly embraced.

Atchison oversaw a period of rapid economic growth, emphasizing the development of new neighbourhoods, infrastructure, and the renewal of the River Landing development adjacent to downtown. He was re-elected by wide margins in 2006 and 2009, before earning a narrow bid for a fourth term in 2012 against political newcomer Tom Wolf. In the 2012 election, Wolf targeted perceived mismanagement at City Hall, a lack of consultation with the public, and Atchison&#x27;s reputation for boosterism, and won a majority of votes in all of the city&#x27;s core neighbourhoods. Atchison was re-elected on a strong performance in suburban neighbourhoods. As term limits for Saskatchewan municipal councils were extended at this time to four years, Atchison&#x27;s fourth term would make him the longest serving mayor in the city&#x27;s history.

Atchison was known as a mayor who attended events prolifically, but by 2012 he also began drawing heavy criticism for never having attended a local pride parade, despite annual invitations from organizers. In 2015, hundreds of people circulated a letter criticizing Atchison&#x27;s continued absence, though in 2016 Atchison continued to claim that his absences were merely due to scheduling conflicts.

In 2016 Atchison launched a bid for what would have been a record-setting fifth term as mayor. He was ultimately defeated by former city councillor Charlie Clark, who ran against Atchison on a platform focused on inclusiveness and planning for future growth.

=== Comeback attempts ===
After the 2016 election, Atchison worked as a consultant for Canwest Commercial and Land Corporation on the development of a World Trade Center in downtown Saskatoon. In 2020, he launched a comeback bid for the mayor&#x27;s chair, challenging the incumbent Clark and former provincial cabinet minister Rob Norris. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, Atchison positioned himself as an experienced leader best-positioned to guide the city&#x27;s economic recovery. He renewed his early-career promise to freeze property taxes and criticized recently adopted initiatives including a new rapid-transit system and a new central library project. He ultimately finished third in the race behind Norris and Clark, who was re-elected to a second term. In the summer of 2023, it was reported that Atchison had expressed interest in running once again in 2024, stating that he would &quot;love to be the mayor&quot; again, while targeting municipal spending as a key campaign issue. In August 2024, he officially announced another bid for mayor; with Clark deciding not to run for a third term, Atchison was joined in the race by two-term councillor Cynthia Block and former provincial cabinet minister Gordon Wyant. As in 2020, Atchison finished in third place, with Block winning the election.

==Personal life==
Atchison and his wife Mardele have five children and thirteen grandchildren. He has maintained an interest and involvement in a variety of sports including curling, tennis, football, golf, and hockey, as both a player and a coach. Atchison is a member of the Saskatchewan Grand Lodge of Freemasons. He was appointed to the Saskatchewan Order of Merit in 2019.

== Controversies ==
In 2022 Atchison was named as one of at least three local politicians for whom students at Legacy Christian Academy school (then Christian Centre Academy) were coerced into campaigning for. Although Atchison was not a member of the affiliated Saskatoon Christian Centre church, it has been alleged that he had a close relationship with the church&#x27;s director, Keith Johnson, who has been named in a class action lawsuit by former student&#x27;s seeking redress for allegations of child abuse. Former students have alleged that they were also required to purchase two pairs of pants each year from Atchison&#x27;s men&#x27;s wear store.

<text>The Chevrolet Citation is a range of compact cars that was produced by Chevrolet from the 1980 to 1985 model years. The first front-wheel drive Chevrolet, the Citation replaced the Chevrolet Nova as the automaker downsized its compact cars. Initially slotted between the Chevrolet Monza and the Chevrolet Malibu in the Chevrolet product line, the model line was later marketed between the Chevrolet Cavalier and the Chevrolet Celebrity.

The Citation used the GM X platform architecture used for its compact car range. For 1980, the X bodies were resized to match the previous downsizing of GM full-size and mid-size cars, along with transitioning to front-wheel drive. Sharing a common chassis architecture with the redesigned Buick Skylark, Oldsmobile Omega, and Pontiac Phoenix, the Citation was offered three body styles, including three-door and five-door hatchback coupes (the latter, shared with the Phoenix). While all four model lines received a two-door notchback coupe, the Citation was styled with a model-exclusive roofline. Alongside a standard trim level, the Citation X-11 was offered as a performance-oriented variant.

Chevrolet assembled the model line in the United States and Mexico in its North Tarrytown Assembly (North Tarrytown, New York), Oklahoma City Assembly (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma), and Ramos Arizpe Assembly (Ramos Arizpe, Mexico) facilities. Following its 1985 discontinuation, the Citation was replaced for 1987 by the Chevrolet Beretta coupe and Chevrolet Corsica sedan/hatchback. In total, Chevrolet manufactured 1,642,587 examples of the model line during its production run.

== Development ==
To better compete in the compact segment following the 1973 fuel crisis, General Motors commenced work in April 1974 on a replacement for its X-body compact lines, a model family that included the Chevrolet Nova and its divisional counterparts. As the 1970s progressed, the popularity of import-brand vehicles (such as the Honda Accord and the Volkswagen Rabbit) led to declining market share held by American manufacturers in the compact segment. Though downsizing of the full-size B and C-body platforms and the A-body mid-size lines was crucial to the future of the company, the two redesigns placed GM model hierarchy out of alignment; though officially a compact, the X-body Nova became dimensionally larger than the Malibu (a year after becoming closer in size to the Caprice than the Chevette).

To realign the X-body platform in size between the A-body and the H-body subcompacts, GM commenced a redesign of its compact lines in 1974. Intended for a 1978 introduction, the Chevrolet Condor was to be introduced as the replacement for the outgoing Chevrolet Nova. Along with a major reduction in exterior footprint (sized between the Vega and Monza in length), the X-body platform was adopting the transverse front-wheel drive layout used by its competitors. Though GM had pioneered the use of front-wheel drive in postwar American vehicles (with the 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado), its experience with the layout was limited to longitudinal powertrains (large-block V8s for the Toronado, Cadillac Eldorado, and GMC Motorhome). To gain insight towards front-wheel drive vehicles powered by inline-4 engines, the company acquired multiple Lancia vehicles for testing and reverse engineering. During the summer of 1976, the first X-body prototypes entered testing.

As chassis design for the front-wheel drive X-body evolved, design work was delegated between divisions. Chevrolet was responsible for the front suspension design, with Pontiac to develop the rear suspension. The 2.5L inline-4 was a Pontiac-designed engine along with a 2.8L Chevrolet-developed V6. Though far smaller than its predecessor, the new X-body remained among the largest designs in its segment, using a 105-inch wheelbase. In contrast to the fastback coupe and hatchback and the four-door sedan of the previous generation, the downsized platform was to offer multiple designs specific to each division. For Chevrolet, the Condor was to be offered as a two-door coupe and three-door and five-door hatchbacks.

While the Chevrolet Condor was originally intended for a 1978 model-year release (to compete against the Ford Fairmont and the smaller Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon), its launch was postponed into early 1979. Though design work was completed, company parts supplies and tooling were not yet ready to match the production of a vehicle replacing the Chevrolet Nova. During the delay, Chevrolet dropped the Condor nameplate in favor of Citation.

==History ==
Released in April 1979 as a 1980 model-year vehicle, the Chevrolet Citation replaced the Chevrolet Nova as the compact car line for the division; it also became the first Chevrolet to feature front-wheel drive. Downsized nearly as extensively as the Caprice/Impala and the Malibu, the Citation shed 20 inches of length, 4 inches of width, and 800 pounds from its 1979 Nova predecessor (making it only an inch longer than the final Chevrolet Vega). The interior design underwent substantial dimensional upgrades, rivaling the Malibu in passenger space and the Impala/Caprice in trunk space.

=== 1980 ===
The 1980 Chevrolet Citation was released in three body styles, including a two-door coupe and three-door and five-door hatchbacks (the first two designs were offered only for the Citation and not shared with any other X-body car). Alongside the standard trim, a sporty X-11 version was produced. At $4,800, the base price of the Citation was more expensive than a fully-equipped 1979 Nova.

Though closer in size to the Honda Accord than the Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon, the three-door and five-door hatchbacks proved popular, accounting for nearly 85% of sales. The high demand for the model line, coinciding with a second fuel crisis, left GM with significant shortages of the standard 2.5L engine, with some customers waiting several months to receive their vehicles. Before the release of the model line, Chevrolet had anticipated 70% of Citation customers would purchase the optional 2.8L V6, leading its production lines backlogged under the high demand for the inline-4 engine.

Coinciding with its early-spring launch and the timing of its release (a fuel-efficient design during a fuel shortage), the 1980 Citation became one of the most successful product launches in General Motors history; over 810,000 examples were sold, with the Citation becoming the best-selling car in the United States for 1980.

=== 1981 ===
For 1981, the Citation saw few visual changes, following its success the year before. The eggcrate-style grille was revised and amber lenses were added for the rear turn signals. The two-door coupe was dropped from the model line, with all Citations produced as hatchbacks. The X-11 (see below) saw several performance upgrades, including the addition of a 135hp &quot;high-output&quot; 2.8L V6.

Sales of the model line dropped by nearly 50%. Coinciding with approximately six months shorter of a model year, 1981 saw the introduction of additional competitors for the Citation, as Chrysler introduced the Dodge Aries/Plymouth Reliant (the Chrysler K-Cars); along with more traditional styling for buyers, the Aries/Reliant included notchback sedan and station wagon models unavailable for the Citation.

=== 1982 ===

For 1982, the Citation underwent a minor exterior revision, as the eggcrate grille was replaced with a horizontally-slatted grille design (taking on the design of the Malibu). After sitting out for 1981, the two-door coupe made its return as a running change during the model year.

To improve fuel economy, the 2.5L engine moved to fuel injection; the entire production (including the X-11) was switched to low rolling-resistance tires.

Sales of the model year decreased over 60% from 1981, coinciding from several factors. In addition to negative publicity stemming from large safety recalls of the model line, the Citation faced a much greater degree of internal competition as Chevrolet introduced additional front-wheel drive lines. For 1982, the Chevrolet Cavalier (J-car, subcompact) replaced the Monza/Vega, offering coupe, hatchback, sedan, and station wagon designs. The Chevrolet Celebrity (A-car, mid-size) replaced the Malibu, offering 2/4-door sedans, and a 5-door station wagon; the front-wheel drive Celebrity shared its chassis underpinnings (including its wheelbase) with the Citation. Several competing import vehicles underwent design changes, as the Honda Accord underwent its first redesign and the Toyota Camry was introduced (featuring an optional 5-door hatchback).

=== 1983 ===
For 1983, Chevrolet concentrated its revisions on the interior, with a nearly unchanged exterior. To provide less competition for the larger Celebrity and bring the Citation in line with its import-brand competitors, the full-width bench seat was deleted, with all versions receiving bucket seats in their place. In addition, the dashboard underwent minor updates.

The 1983 Citation struggled in sales, selling only 92,000 units.

=== Citation II (1984-1985) ===
For 1984, Chevrolet rebranded its Citation line, renaming it the Citation II. Intended to draw attention away from previous safety recalls and quality issues, the Citation II was only nominally changed from 1983 (distinguished by decklid badging revisions). The two-door coupe was carried over, along with both hatchbacks; the X-11 made its return.

For the first time in its production, the model line gained sales over the previous year; at less that 100,000 units, the Citation II lagged far behind the Cavalier and Celebrity in sales.

1985 marked the final year for the Citation. Now only sold with the Buick Skylark, Chevrolet dropped the Citation II coupe, leaving only the hatchbacks. While in its final year, the interior underwent its most substantial revision since 1980, as Chevrolet introduced a new dashboard for the Citation. Along with a new steering wheel, the dashboard accommodated a horizontally-mounted radio (a change necessitated by GM&#x27;s adoption of standardized head units with electronic tuning in nearly all of its vehicles).

== Discontinuation ==
After 1.6 million units assembled of the model line, Chevrolet discontinued the Citation after the 1985 model year. The year before, GM began to wind down its use of the X platform, as it dropped the Oldsmobile Omega and Pontiac Phoenix (the slowest-selling variants), leaving only the Citation II and the Buick Skylark for 1985. After 23 years and five generations, GM retired the X platform entirely for its compact cars after 1985.

GM would not offer a direct replacement for the X platform, as its compact models were split among two different platforms phased in between 1985 and 1988. Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac used the split-wheelbase N platform (designed by Oldsmobile); the Chevrolet-designed L platform replaced the Citation with the Corsica and Beretta. Though designed separately, L-body and N-body cars shared engineering commonality with the smaller J-body chassis.

Though the 1980 launch of the Citation has not been replicated again (in terms of sales), the replacement compact cars proved successful in the marketplace, as the Pontiac Grand Am became the best-selling vehicle of the brand, with the Chevrolet Corsica/Beretta becoming one of the highest-selling vehicles in the United States at its launch.

==Powertrain==
For the all-new X-platform, GM introduced two new engines for the platform architecture. The Pontiac-designed 2.5L &quot;Iron Duke&quot; inline-4 had been introduced in 1977 for the Chevrolet Vega and the rest of the H-platform, but it underwent a series of upgrades for it to be used in a transverse-engine chassis. As an option, a Chevrolet-designed 2.8L V6 was developed as the first GM 60° V6 engine; an iron-block engine, the new engine family used a narrower 60° V-angle (for better balance and packaging, but not used for V6 engines with engineering commonality with V8s).

In 1981, Chevrolet added electronic control to its emissions systems, which reduced engine output slightly. For 1982, the 2.5L engine received fuel injection (adopted by the high-output V6 for 1985). For 1983, the 2.8L high-output V6 (previously paired with the X-11) became an option for all Citations.

Along with its use on the X platform, the Iron Duke engine and the 60° V6 engine family was widely used for a wide range of vehicles; in various forms, the V6 would remain in use in North America until 2009.  
==Citation X-11==

Produced as a separate trim level, the Citation X-11 was a variant featuring cosmetic, chassis, and powertrain upgrades over the standard Citation. While less powerful than the Camaro Z28 (and later Monte Carlo SS), the Citation X-11 would also take over the role of the similarly sized Chevrolet Monza. The X-11 was offered throughout the production run of the Citation/Citation II, on the 3-door hatchback and 2-door &quot;club coupe&quot; (discontinued in 1981 and 1985).

In 1981, the Citation X-11 accelerated from 0–60 MPH in 8.5 seconds; the 1982–1984 version accelerated from 0–60 MPH in 9.2 seconds.

=== Chassis upgrades ===
At its 1980 launch, the chassis of the Citation X-11 was upgraded with front and rear stabilizer bars and a retuned sport suspension, which were kept throughout its production. In place of steel wheels, the X-11 featured 13-inch rallye rims with Goodyear P205/70R-13 white-letter tires. In 1981, the 13-inch wheels were replaced with 14-inch wheels with Goodyear Eagle GT P215/60 R14 radial tires. To upgrade handling, for 1982, the steering rack was relocated from the firewall to the subframe holding the engine and front suspension. The design change was intended to prevent subframe movement from affecting steering behavior.

For 1980, the X-11 offered only handling upgrades over a Citation, with the powertrain consisting of a 90 hp 2.5 L inline-4 and a 115 hp 2.8 L V6. Alongside the standard Citation, the X-11 was available with either a 4-speed overdrive manual transmission or a 3-speed automatic transmission (the only transmission available for 1985).

To aid acceleration, axle ratios of the X-11 were changed, alongside the transmission gearing. A taller first gear was intended to allow the X-11 to accelerate to 60 mph without shifting to third gear. For 1981, the X-11 was powered exclusively by a &quot;high-output&quot; version of the 2.8 L V6; a higher-performance dual-tip exhaust system raised output to 135 hp/165 lb-ft of torque. As before, the X-11 maintained separate final-drive ratios. In 1982, emissions regulations required a decrease in torque output, to 145 lb-ft (horsepower remained unchanged). This output remained the same through 1984. In 1985, the carbureted engine was replaced by a fuel-injected version of the 2.8 L V6 with output decreased to 130 hp/155 lb-ft of torque. In slightly different tuning, the Citation X-11 shared its powertrain with the Chevrolet Celebrity Eurosport, Pontiac 6000STE, and Pontiac Fiero.

=== Body upgrades ===
In 1980, the Citation X-11 shared most of its powertrain with the standard Citation, with the model being mostly a chassis and visual upgrade. Alongside the alloy wheels and tires, the X-11 featured a trunklid spoiler, sport mirrors, body skirting, and side striping. In 1981, to better distinguish the model from standard two-tone Citations, the side striping of the X-11 was replaced in favor of large &quot;X-11&quot; door graphic, which remained in use for the rest of its production. The model is best distinguished from a standard Citation by its use of a black grille (the only exterior chrome trim on a Citation II X-11 is the Chevrolet grille bowtie and trunklid badging). In 1981, a functional cowl-induction hood scoop was added. Under hard acceleration, a solenoid operated switch opened a flap that let in extra air.

While produced without the front bench seat seen in the launch of the Citation, the interior of the X-11 was most widely differentiated with the use of a sport steering wheel. The X-11 was produced with its own instrument panel, which featured a full set of engine gauges (6000 RPM tachometer for 1980, 7000 RPM tachometer for 1981–1985).

=== Racing ===
The SCCA classified the X-11 in Showroom Stock B class. Bob McConnell drove a 1981 X-11 to SSB National Championships in 1982 and 1984.

== Reception ==
The Chevrolet Citation was awarded Motor Trend Car of the Year for 1980. In 2009, the editorial staff of &quot;Car and Driver&quot; criticized the 1980 Motor Trend decision (alongside several other vehicle awards), citing poor build quality and mechanical reliability undeserving of such an award in hindsight.

Car and Driver, along with several other car magazines of the time, were duped when GM lent them specially modified versions of the X-body vehicles in which heavy torque steer had been engineered out (torque steer was a handling trait common to X-platform vehicles). Patrick Bedard of &quot;Car and Driver&quot; said that they were completely surprised by this when they drove a production version some time later. Like the other X-body cars, there were numerous reports of the Citation locking the rear wheels upon braking, causing loss of control and a crash.

Hagerty, an insurance company specializing in classic cars, notes that the X-car was &quot;GM&#x27;s prime contender for one of the malaziest cars&quot; of the Malaise era, a car that did &quot;enormous damage to GM&#x27;s reputation, putting together a most unenviable record for recalls and poor quality control.&quot;

=== Safety recalls ===
Through its production, as one of the front-wheel drive X-body vehicles, the Chevrolet Citation would undergo a number of manufacturer recalls. In 1980, 225,000 examples were recalled to fix a transmission hose related to underhood fires. The X-body cars (which included the Citation) were the target of an unsuccessful lawsuit by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which cited a tendency for the vehicles to lose control under heavy braking, and power steering problems.

<text>Aerial Support to Regional Enforcement Agencies (ASTREA) is the aviation unit of the San Diego County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. It is based at Gillespie Field in El Cajon, California.

== History ==
1972 - ASTREA began operations with three Korean War-era Bell 47G helicopters based at Gillespie Field in El Cajon.

1997 - On February 16, Deputy Patrick &quot;Pat&quot; S. Coyle, 42, died after the ASTREA helicopter in which he and pilot Ron Hobson were flying crashed in Sycamore Canyon, northeast of Santee, California. His death marked the first fatality in the then 25-year history of the sheriff&#x27;s air support unit.

2003 - Cedar Fire and Paradise Fire

2005 - ASTREA receives two refurbished Bell 205A-1++ &quot;Super Huey&quot; firefighting helicopters. These are the first two aircraft purchased for the new regional fire helicopter program the county started after the October 2003 wildfires. Both are single-engine, medium-lift copters equipped with 375 gallon underbelly water tanks. The helicopters arrived at Gillespie Field after a three-day, 2,000-mile flight from Eagle Copters of Calgary, Canada. They are designated Copter 10 and 12.

2008 - A new Bell 407 is acquired and equipped to support law enforcement and command and control missions.

2009 - ASTREA sells two of its Hughes 500Ds. (ASTREA 2 &amp; 4) These will eventually be replaced with MD530Fs.

2010 - The only MD500E owned by ASTREA is converted to an MD530F, which is better suited for high altitude and hot weather operations.

2015 - ASTREA adds a Bell 407GX to the fleet (N972PC). On September 29, ASTREA receives a third Bell 205A-1. Like the first two, Copter 11 was rebuilt by Eagle Copters and flown from Calgary to El Cajon.

2019 - The first two of four Bell 407GXi were delivered.

2020 - The third Bell 407GXi were delivered. (N709WG) The WG registration letters are the initials of the former Sheriff William Gore.

2023 - The last Bell 407GXi joined the fleet, and the first of two Bell/Subaru 412EPX arrived. N972PC a Bell 407GX was sold to make way for the new GXi.

== Aircraft ==
As of November 2023, ASTREA&#x27;s fleet consists of 8 helicopters:

*The 407 models can be equipped with a Bambi Bucket for use in firefighting, while the Bell 205s and 412 have 375 gallon belly tanks already installed.

<text>In film and photography, a prime lens is a fixed focal length photographic lens (as opposed to a zoom lens), typically with a maximum aperture from f2.8 to f1.2. The term can also mean the primary lens in a combination lens system.
Confusion between these two meanings can occur without clarifying context. Alternate terms, such as &quot;primary focal length&quot;, &quot;fixed focal length&quot;, or &quot;FFL&quot; are sometimes used to avoid ambiguity.

== As alternative to zoom lens ==
The term &quot;prime&quot; has come to mean the opposite of &quot;zoom&quot;—a fixed-focal-length, or unifocal lens.

While a prime lens of a given focal length is less versatile than a zoom lens, it is often of superior optical quality, wider maximum aperture, lighter weight, and smaller size. These advantages stem from having fewer moving parts, optical elements optimized for one particular focal length, and a less complicated lens formula that creates fewer optical aberration issues. Larger maximum aperture (smaller f-number) facilitates photography in lower light, and a shallower depth of field.

A normal lens or &quot;normal prime&quot; is a lens with a focal length about equal to the diagonal size of the film or sensor format, or that reproduces perspective that generally looks &quot;natural&quot; to a human observer under normal viewing conditions.

== Traditional meaning as primary lens ==

The older, original meaning of &quot;prime lens&quot; is the main lens in a combination lens system. When the camera lens is used with some other optical device, such as a close-up lens, teleconverter, or teleside converter, the camera lens itself is properly called the &quot;prime lens&quot;. &quot;Prime&quot; is here used in the sense of primary, chief, original, first in order, etc.

Lens manufacturers such as ARRI Media, ISCO Precision Optics, Schneider, Carl Zeiss AG, Canon and others still make variable focal length cine and video lenses regularly catalogued as variable prime lenses. A variable prime is sometimes distinguished from a &quot;true zoom&quot; in that the latter maintains focus as the focal length is varied.

This use of the term &quot;prime lens&quot; is an example of a retronym. Early in photography only primary camera lenses were available, and were merely called &quot;lenses&quot; or &quot;objectives&quot;. Later, &quot;auxiliary&quot; lenses were available, which usually fit in front of the front element of the primary, or &quot;prime&quot; lens.

== Popular focal lengths ==

Many lens manufacturers produce or produced prime lenses at or near the following focal lengths: 20mm, 24mm, 28mm, 35mm, 40mm, 50mm, 85mm, 105mm, 135mm, 200mm, 300mm, 400mm, and 600mm. For these lengths many manufacturers produce two or more lenses with the same focal length but with different maximum apertures to suit the different needs of photographers. Additional focal lengths can be created by using a teleconverter.

For 35 mm film and full frame digital cameras (in which the image area is 36 by 24 millimeters) prime lenses can be categorized by focal length as follows:

* 12 to 21 mm: Ultra-Wide — usually used at very close subject distances to produce a perspective that provides a dramatic, often extreme image that distorts a scene’s natural proportions
* 24 to 35 mm: Wide — capture a wider field of view than a standard lens, at shorter distances, the perspective can show distortion
* 50 mm: Standard — a focal length near the 44mm image diagonal and a perspective similar to human vision
* 85 mm: Portrait — short telephoto lens that accommodates a longer subject to camera distance for pleasing perspective effects and useful image framing
* 135 mm: Telephoto — used, for example, by action and sports photographers to capture faraway objects
* 200 to 500 mm: Super Telephoto — specialized, bulky lenses typically used in sports, action, and wildlife photography

== Specialist lenses ==

Some specialist lenses are only available as prime lenses due to design or cost constraints. Examples of such specialist lenses are: extreme telephoto or wide angle, lenses with tilt or shift function, lenses with large apertures and macro lenses.

<doc id="889743" wikidata="Q1407488" url="?curid=889743" title="Stonehenge Free Festival">
<text>The Stonehenge Free Festival was a British free festival from 1974 to 1984 held at the prehistoric monument Stonehenge in England during the month of June, and culminating with the summer solstice on or near 21 June. It emerged as the major free festival in the calendar after the violent suppression of the Windsor Free Festival in August 1974, with Wally Hope providing the impetus for its founding, and was itself violently suppressed in 1985 in the Battle of the Beanfield, with no free festival held at Stonehenge since although people have been allowed to gather at the stones again for the solstice since 1999.

By the 1980s, the festival had grown to be a major event, attracting up to 30,000 people in 1984. The festival attendees were branded as hippies by the British press. This, along with the open drug use and sale, contributed to the increase in restrictions on access to Stonehenge, and fences were erected around the stones in 1977. The same year, police resurrected a moribund law against driving over grassland in order to levy fines against festival goers in motorised transport. By 1984 police–festival relations were relaxed with only a nominal police presence required.

==Bands==
The festival was a celebration of various alternative cultures. The Tibetan Ukrainian Mountain Troupe, The Tepee People, Circus Normal, the Peace Convoy, New Age Travellers and the Wallys were notable counterculture attendees.

The stage hosted many bands including Hawkwind, Zorch, Poison Girls, Doctor and the Medics, Flux of Pink Indians, Buster Blood Vessel, Omega Tribe, Killing Joke, The Selecter, Dexys Midnight Runners, Thompson Twins, Bronz, The Raincoats, The 101ers, Jeremy Spencer &amp; the Children of God, Brent Black Music Co-op, Killerhertz, Mournblade, Amazulu, Wishbone Ash, Man, Benjamin Zephaniah, Inner City Unit, Here and Now, Cardiacs, The Enid, Roy Harper, Jimmy Page, Ted Chippington, Ozric Tentacles, Solstice and Vince Pie and the Crumbs, who all played for free.

<text>Vert is a term used in extreme sports especially vert skating, vert skateboarding, snowboarding and BMX to denote a competition held on a vert ramp which allows the competitors to fly into the air and land back on the ramp. This time in the air allows the competitor to perform moves which would otherwise be extremely difficult. An example of this would be a flip, or a spin.

The term itself comes from the word &quot;vertical,&quot; the direction in which the competitor is moving after leaving the ramp.

Ramps used in these events are usually vert ramps.

Outside of competitions, the term &quot;vert&quot; is not normally used. Instead, the specific type of ramp is denoted. So instead of saying &quot;I am going to go ride vert,&quot; one might say &quot;I am going to go ride a half-pipe.&quot; However, it would be correct to say &quot;in competitions, I usually ride vert,&quot; in order to differentiate from other forms of competition (such as freestyle, park or street).

ESPN&#x27;s X Games initially eliminated vert from its 2008 competition, due to declining ratings over the last few years, but because of a proposed boycott of the &quot;Big Air&quot; event, mainly by the professional skateboarders, it was reinstated.

<doc id="889746" wikidata="Q1711430" url="?curid=889746" title="Supernetwork">
<text>A supernetwork, or supernet, is an Internet Protocol (IP) network that is formed by aggregation of multiple networks (or subnets) into a larger network. The new routing prefix for the aggregate network represents the constituent networks in a single routing table entry. The process of forming a supernet is called supernetting, prefix aggregation, route aggregation, or route summarization.

Supernetting within the Internet serves as a strategy to avoid fragmentation of the IP address space by using a hierarchical allocation system that delegates control of segments of address space to regional Internet registries. This method facilitates regional route aggregation.

The benefits of supernetting are efficiencies gained in routers in terms of memory storage of route information and processing overhead when matching routes. Supernetting, however, can introduce interoperability issues and other risks.

==Overview==
In IP networking terminology, a supernet is a block of contiguous subnetworks addressed as a single subnet from the perspective of the larger network. Supernets are always larger than their component networks. Supernetting is the process of aggregating routes to multiple smaller networks, thus saving storage space in the routing table, simplifying routing decisions and reducing route advertisements to neighboring gateways. Supernetting has helped address the increasing size of routing tables as the Internet has expanded. 

Supernetting in large, complex networks can isolate topology changes from other routers. This can improve the stability of the network by limiting the propagation of routing changes in the event of a network link failure. If a router only advertises a summary route to the next router, then it does not need to advertise any changes to specific subnets within the summarized range. This can significantly reduce any unnecessary routing updates following a topology change. Hence, it increases the speed of convergence resulting in a more stable environment.

==Protocol requirements==
Supernetting requires the use of routing protocols that support Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). Interior Gateway Routing Protocol, Exterior Gateway Protocol and version 1 of the Routing Information Protocol (RIPv1) assume classful addressing, and therefore cannot transmit the subnet mask information required for supernetting.

Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) supports CIDR. By default, EIGRP summarizes the routes within the routing table and forwards these summarized routes to its peers. Other routing protocols with CIDR support include RIPv2, Open Shortest Path First, EIGRP, IS-IS and Border Gateway Protocol.

==Examples==
A company that operates 150 accounting services in each of 50 districts has a router in each office connected with a Frame Relay link to its corporate headquarters. Without supernetting, the routing table on any given router might have to account for 150 routers in each of the 50 districts, or 7500 different networks. However, if a hierarchical addressing system is implemented with supernetting, then each district has a centralized site as an interconnection point. Each route is summarized before being advertised to other districts. Each router now only recognizes its own subnet and the other 49 summarized routes.

The determination of the summary route on a router involves the recognition of the number of highest-order bits that match all addresses. The summary route is calculated as follows. A router has the following networks in its routing table:
Firstly, the addresses are converted to binary format and aligned in a list:
Secondly, the bits at which the common pattern of digits ends are located. These common bits are shown in red. Lastly, the number of common bits is counted. The summary route is found by setting the remaining bits to zero, as shown below. It is followed by a slash and then the number of common bits. 

The summarized route is 192.168.96.0/20. The subnet mask is 255.255.240.0. This summarized route also contains networks that were not in the summarized group, namely, 192.168.96.0, 192.168.97.0, 192.168.103.0, 192.168.104.0, 192.168.106.0, 192.168.107.0, 192.168.108.0, 192.168.109.0, 192.168.110.0, and 192.168.111.0. It must be assured that the missing networks do not exist outside of this route. 

In another example, an ISP is assigned a block of IP addresses by a regional Internet registry (RIR) of 172.1.0.0 to 172.1.255.255. The ISP might then assign subnetworks to each of their downstream clients, e.g., &quot;Customer A&quot; will have the range 172.1.1.0 to 172.1.1.255, &quot;Customer B&quot; would receive the range 172.1.2.0 to 172.1.2.255 and &quot;Customer C&quot; would receive the range 172.1.3.0 to 172.1.3.255, and so on. Instead of an entry for each of the subnets 172.1.1.x and 172.1.2.x, etc., the ISP could aggregate the entire 172.1.x.x address range and advertise the network 172.1.0.0/16, which would reduce the number of entries in the global routing table.

==Risks==
The following supernetting risks have been identified:
*Supernetting is implemented in different ways on different routers.
*Supernetting on one router interface can influence how routes are advertised on other interfaces of the same router.
*In the presence of supernetting, detecting a persistent routing loop becomes a difficult problem.
*Adverse impact in heterogeneous routing environments with discontiguous subnets

<text>The following list of chief rabbis of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth gives information regarding the Chief Rabbi of the United Synagogue, which is represented through the mainstream majority Orthodox community of the United Kingdom (as the oldest and original denomination), and various other Orthodox communities located within the Commonwealth of Nations. The Chief Rabbi&#x27;s full title is the &quot;Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth&quot;, previously &quot;... of the British Empire&quot;. His title and position has historically, since 1758, been considered to be the Orthodox Jewish community in Britain&#x27;s equivalent of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

<text>The Battle of the Beanfield took place over several hours on 1 June 1985, when Wiltshire Police prevented The Peace Convoy, a convoy of several hundred New Age travellers, from setting up the 1985 Stonehenge Free Festival in Wiltshire, England. The police were enforcing a High Court injunction obtained by the authorities prohibiting the 1985 festival from taking place. Around 1,300 police officers took part in the operation against approximately 600 travellers.

The convoy of travellers heading for Stonehenge encountered a police road block seven miles from the landmark. Police claimed that some traveller vehicles then rammed police vehicles in an attempt to push through the roadblock. Around the same time police smashed the windows of some of the convoy&#x27;s vehicles and some travellers were arrested. The rest broke into an adjacent field, and a stand-off developed that persisted for several hours. According to the BBC, &quot;Police said they came under attack, being pelted with lumps of wood, stones and even petrol bombs&quot;. Conversely, &quot;The Observer&quot; states the travellers were not armed with petrol bombs and that police intelligence suggesting so &quot;was false&quot;.

Eventually the police launched another attack during which the worst of the violent police behaviour took place. According to &quot;The Observer&quot;, during this period pregnant women and those holding babies were clubbed by police with truncheons and the police were hitting &quot;anybody they could reach&quot;. When some of the travellers tried to escape by driving away through the fields, &quot;The Observer&quot; stated that the police threw truncheons, shields, fire extinguishers and stones at them to try to stop them.

Dozens of travellers were injured, and 537 travellers were eventually arrested. This represents one of the largest mass arrests of civilians since at least the Second World War, possibly one of the biggest in English legal history.

Two years after the event, a Wiltshire police sergeant was found guilty of Actual Bodily Harm as a consequence of injuries incurred by a member of the convoy during the Battle of the Beanfield.

In February 1991 a civil court judgement awarded 21 of the travellers £24,000 in damages for false imprisonment, damage to property and wrongful arrest. The award was swallowed by their legal bill as the judge did not award them legal costs.

==Background==

The British New Age Travellers movement developed in the 1970s with the intended purpose of attempting to create an alternative way of life. Travellers maintained themselves partly by travelling between, organising and trading at free festivals. After a stay with Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament demonstrators, one group of travellers came to be known as &quot;The Peace Convoy&quot;.
The free festival scene thus also emerged in the 1970s. The People&#x27;s Free Festival at Windsor ran from 1972 until 1974 when it was violently terminated by the authorities. Stonehenge Free Festival began in 1974. In 1975 the Windsor festival switched to Watchfield but did not prove successful at the abandoned military site. Consequently, The People&#x27;s Free Festival at Stonehenge became the focal point of the movement. In 1980, the Festival was marred by significant violence, largely by biker groups.

In 1984 the Department of the Environment passed management of Stonehenge and the surrounding land to English Heritage. By that time the festival had grown in size, the attendance figure for the 1984 festival was estimated at 100,000. Due to the high attendance figures there was little authority present at Stonehenge festivals and the police were unable to shut them down or implement the law. Consequently, most illegal drugs were unrestrictedly available and advertised for purchase. Traders at the festival were neglecting to obtain licences or pay taxes.

Critics claimed that the 1984 festival had resulted in the destruction of archaeological information and on the site itself, &quot;holes had been dug in Bronze Age barrows for latrines and as bread ovens, motorcycles had been ridden over them, churning the surface. Fences had been torn down, and a thousand young trees cut down for firewood&quot;. The clean-up cost upwards of £20,000, besides the archaeological information that was lost. Landowners also claimed that damage to Stonehenge, other property damage, trespassing, recreational drug use and bathing naked in rivers had occurred during the festival.

A civil high court injunction was consequently imposed prohibiting the proposed 1985 festival from taking place.

==Main events==
After staying the previous night in Savernake Forest, the Convoy on the morning of 1 June numbered up to 140 vehicles, most of them buses and vans converted into living spaces; it is estimated they contained 600 people. The police had laid down an exclusion zone 4 miles (6.4 km) around the perimeter of Stonehenge, which the convoy hoped to breach. The Convoy met resistance when the police set up a roadblock near Shipton Bellinger about 7 miles (11 km) from Stonehenge. This was achieved by tipping three lorry loads of gravel across the road. According to &quot;The Observer&quot;, the convoy evaded the main roadblock on the A303 by slipping down a side road but were then met with a second roadblock. At this juncture the police claim that some traveller vehicles rammed police vehicles in an attempt to escape the roadblock. At around the same time the police smashed the windscreens of traveller vehicles and arrested occupants.

Most traveller vehicles broke into an adjacent field, by driving through a hedgerow according to one source. A stand-off consequently ensued. Travellers made attempts to negotiate with police but the officer in charge, Assistant Chief Constable Lionel Grundy, ordered that all travellers be arrested. There were outbreaks of violence during which several members of the Convoy received head injuries. An ambulance was allowed through to take them to hospital. Police Officer Bernie Lund, who was on scene, claimed that during the stand-off, petrol bombs and sticks were thrown at officers. However &quot;The Guardian&quot; states that travellers were not armed with petrol bombs and that police intelligence suggesting that they were &quot;was false&quot;.

At 7pm officers in riot gear entered the field and launched a final attack. Pregnant women and those holding babies were hit by police with truncheons according to &quot;The Observer&quot;, who also noted journalist Nick Davies stating that police were hitting &quot;anybody (that) they could reach&quot;. When some travellers tried to escape by driving away through the field police allegedly threw truncheons, shields, fire-extinguishers and stones at them to stop them. &quot;The Observer&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot; report that travellers&#x27; vehicles were smashed and set on fire.

One traveller was taken away with a suspected fractured skull.

The large majority of the travellers, over 500, were arrested on suspicion of obstructing police and obstructing the highway. One source states that this represented the largest mass arrest of civilians in English legal history, another that it was the biggest figure since the Second World War. There were insufficient holding cells in local jails to hold all those arrested. Convoy members were transported throughout the Midlands and even to northern England. Not all children and parents ended up in the same region. Most of the arrests did not result in successful prosecutions.

Traveller Alan Lodge, speaking to the BBC, described it as &quot;an ambush that happened on a small, mild mannered bunch of people&quot;.

The UK miners&#x27; strike had ended earlier in the same year, and police compared this event with tactics used at the Battle of the Beanfield, stating: &quot;The Police operation had been planned for several months and lessons in rapid deployment learned from the miners&#x27; strike were implemented.&quot;

==Witnesses==
Most independent eyewitness accounts of the events relate that the police used violent tactics against men, women and children, including pregnant women; and purposely damaged the vehicles used by the convoy.

===Earl of Cardigan===
The travellers had departed from Savernake Forest, which is owned by the Earl of Cardigan&#x27;s family. The Earl of Cardigan decided to follow the convoy on his motorbike. The Earl describes that during the initial confrontation there were negotiations with police who insisted that the travellers would not be allowed to pass. The travellers subsequently began entering into a field. Then &quot;police rushed out on foot, from behind their barricades. Clutching drawn truncheons and riot shields, they ran round to the driver&#x27;s door of each vehicle, slamming their truncheons into the bodywork to make a deafening noise, and shouting at every driver, &#x27;get out, get out, hand over your keys, get out&#x27;&quot;. He states that police were &quot;smashing up vehicles&quot; and instructions to &quot;Get out!&quot; often happened simultaneously, giving travellers no time to react before police used riot sticks to break the vehicles&#x27; windscreens. Cardigan described seeing a very pregnant woman being &quot;repeatedly clubbed on the head&quot; by police, many of whom had their ID numbers covered up. He also saw police with hammers smashing up the dashboards of several of the now-abandoned motor-coach homes.

Cardigan also described how he was approached by the police the following day, who wanted permission to remove travellers who were still at Savernake: &quot;They said they wanted to go into the campsite &#x27;suitably equipped&#x27; and &#x27;finish unfinished business&#x27;. Make of that phrase what you will. I said to them, that if it was my permission they were after, they did not have it. I did not want a repeat of the grotesque events that I&#x27;d seen the day before.&quot;

===Journalists===
ITN Reporter Kim Sabido was at the scene and recorded a piece-to-camera in which he claimed that he had witnessed &quot;some of the most brutal police treatment of people&quot; that he had seen in his entire career as a journalist. He also remarked on the number of people that had been &quot;clubbed&quot; by police including those &quot;holding babies in their arms&quot;. He felt that an inquiry should be held into what had happened. Sabido later claimed that when he went back to the ITN library to look at the rushes, most of the footage had &quot;disappeared, particularly some of the nastier shots.&quot; Some of this missing footage was later rediscovered and incorporated into &quot;Operation Solstice&quot; a documentary shown on Channel 4 in 1991.

Nick Davies reported for the &quot;Observer&quot; that &quot;There was glass breaking, people screaming, black smoke towering out of burning caravans and everywhere there seemed to be people being bashed and flattened and pulled by the hair. Men, women and children were led away, shivering, swearing, crying, bleeding, leaving their homes in pieces.&quot;

Freelance photographer Ben Gibson, engaged by &quot;The Observer&quot; that day, was arrested and charged with obstructing a police officer. He was later acquitted. Another freelance photographer, Tim Malyon, had to flee at one point.

==Legal action==
Twenty-four of the travellers sued Wiltshire Police for wrongful arrest, assault and criminal damage to themselves and their property. Six years after the event a verdict was reached. Twenty-one of the travellers were successful in their case and were awarded £24,000 in damages towards their false imprisonment, damage to property and wrongful arrest. The judge declined to award their legal costs and their compensation consequently went towards paying for this. Their barrister, Lord Gifford QC, stated &quot;It left a very sour taste in the mouth.&quot;

In court, individual police officers were difficult to identify, as they had hidden their identification numbers on the day. Despite this, one police sergeant was convicted of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm on a member of the Convoy.

Police radio and video was used as evidence during the court case, however there was a recording gap in both the radio and video recordings. The recording gap in the video footage was allegedly due to the video tape breaking when the convoy was initially halted at the roadblock. There was also evidence that radio logs of conversations between officers on the day of the battle had been altered.

The Earl of Cardigan testified in court against Wiltshire Police. His testimony proved vital in supporting the allegation that police violence had been excessive. He was criticised by several national newspapers for acting as a witness against Wiltshire Police; Bill Deedes&#x27; editorial in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; claimed he was a class traitor. Consequently, the Earl successfully sued for defamation.

==Aftermath and legacy==
Legislation was introduced in the form of the Public Order Act 1986 and later the Criminal Justice Act 1994 that made the travellers&#x27; way of life increasingly difficult to sustain.

Following the events of 1985, the four-mile blockade of Stonehenge was maintained for future summer solstices. Consequently, conflict between police and those trying to reach Stonehenge continued to take place every year. Neo-druid leader Arthur Uther Pendragon was arrested on each and every summer solstice between 1985 and 1999 whilst trying to access Stonehenge. In the summer of 1988 around 130 people were arrested and in 1989 that figure rose to 260.

For the 1999 summer solstice English Heritage granted &quot;limited access&quot; to Stonehenge to neo-druids. This access permission was later rescinded when 200 New Age travellers broke on to the site. Twenty people were arrested.

Despite repeated calls, an inquiry into the events of 1 June 1985 has never been honoured.

==Cultural references==
In the 1985 song &quot;Stonehenge&quot; by Poison Girls, the Battle of the Beanfield is referenced, highlighting the conflict between festival-goers and police forces.

Singer Roy Harper&#x27;s song &quot;Back to the Stones&quot; refers to the Battle of the Beanfield. It was recorded in 1989 and appears on his 1993 live album &quot;Unhinged&quot;.

The Hawkwind song &quot;Confrontation&quot; from the album &quot;Out &amp; Intake&quot; includes a description of the day&#x27;s events and includes a dramatisation of some events including the repeated phrase &quot;I am not interested in anything you have to say&quot;.

The Levellers&#x27; song &quot;Battle of the Beanfield&quot;, from their 1991 album &quot;Levelling the Land&quot;, was inspired by the Battle of the Beanfield.

British progressive-rock band Solstice wrote a song which comments on the Battle. &quot;Circles&quot; is found on their 1997 album of the same name, and includes what sounds like reporting from the battle, with Kim Sabido&#x27;s voice-over.

The song &quot;Itinerant Child&quot;, by Ian Dury and Chaz Jankel, which appears on the 1998 album &quot;Mr. Love Pants&quot;, by Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads, was inspired by Dury&#x27;s experiences during the incident.

The police riot is a feature of the 2001 novel &quot;He Kills Coppers&quot; by Jake Arnott, partially following changes in police culture between the 1960s and the 1980s, later made into an ITV TV series.

The confrontation is also featured in the 2018 novel &quot;The Fountain in the Forest&quot; by Tony White.

<text>Glowworm or glow-worm is the common name for various groups of insect larvae and adult larviform females that glow through bioluminescence. They include the European common glow-worm and other members of the Lampyridae, but bioluminescence also occurs in the families Elateridae, Phengodidae and Rhagophthalmidae among beetles; as well as members of the genera &quot;Arachnocampa&quot;, &quot;Keroplatus&quot; and &quot;Orfelia&quot; among keroplatid fungus gnats.

==Beetles==
Four families of beetles are bioluminescent. The wingless larviform females and larvae of these bioluminescent species are usually known as &quot;glowworms&quot;. Winged males may or may not also exhibit bioluminescence. Their light may be emitted as flashes or as a constant glow, and usually range in colour from green, yellow, to orange. The families are closely related, and are all members of the beetle superfamily, Elateroidea. Phylogenetic analyses have indicated that bioluminescence may have a single evolutionary origin among the families Lampyridae, Phengodidae, and Rhagophthalmidae; but is likely to have arisen independently among Elateridae.
* Family Elateridae – The click beetles. Of the estimated 10,000 species classified under this family, around 200 species from tropical regions of the Americas and some Melanesian islands are bioluminescent. All of them are members of the subfamily Pyrophorinae, except for one species, &quot;Campyloxenus pyrothorax&quot;, which belongs to subfamily Campyloxeninae, and &quot;Balgus schnusei&quot;, in Thylacosterninae.
* Family Lampyridae – True fireflies. Contains around 2,000 species found throughout the world. Some &quot;glow worms&quot; are in this family.
* Family Phengodidae – Usually known as glowworm beetles. Contains around 230 species endemic to the New World. This family also includes railroad worms, which are unique among all terrestrial bioluminescent organisms in producing red light. 
* Family Rhagophthalmidae – Contains around 30 species found in Asia. The validity of this family has not been fully resolved. Rhagophthalmidae was formerly considered to be a subfamily under Phengodidae before being treated as a distinct family. Some authors now believe that it should be classified under Lampyridae.
==Fungus gnats==
Three genera of fungus gnats are bioluminescent, and known as &quot;glowworms&quot; in their larval stage. They produce a blue-green light. The larvae spin sticky webs to catch food. They are found in caves, overhangs, rock cavities, and other sheltered, wet areas. They are usually classified under the family Keroplatidae, but this is not universally accepted and some authors place them under Mycetophilidae instead. Despite the similarities in function and appearance, the bioluminescent systems of the three genera are not homologous and are believed to have evolved separately.
* Genus &quot;Arachnocampa&quot; – around five species found only in New Zealand and Australia. The best-known member of the genus is the New Zealand glowworm, &quot;Arachnocampa luminosa.&quot; The larvae are predatory and use their lights to lure prey into their webs.
* Genus &quot;Orfelia&quot; – sometimes known as &quot;dismalites&quot;. Contains a single species, &quot;Orfelia fultoni&quot;, found only in North America. Like &quot;Arachnocampa&quot; spp., their larvae may use their lights to attract prey like springtails and other small insects, but their main food is fungal spores.
* Genus &quot;Keroplatus&quot; – found in Eurasia. Unlike &quot;Arachnocampa&quot; and &quot;Orfelia&quot;, the larvae of &quot;Keroplatus&quot; feed only on fungal spores. Their bioluminescence is believed to have no function and is vestigial.

<doc id="889775" wikidata="Q7177682" url="?curid=889775" title="Peter White (Canadian politician)">
<text>Peter White, (August 30, 1838 – May 3, 1906) was a Canadian parliamentarian.

White was born into a family that had established its homestead at the junction of the Muskrat and Ottawa Rivers where the town of Pembroke, Ontario was soon established. His family established several businesses including a lumberyard, general store and blacksmith&#x27;s shop.

As a young man, White and his brother took over the family business and became wealthy as they supplied the steam engine industries. He also became a major shareholder and president of the Pembroke Company.

White entered politics and became reeve of Pembroke Township in 1870. He first ran for the House of Commons of Canada as a Conservative candidate in the 1872 federal election in the riding of Renfrew North but was defeated. He won election in the 1874 election, but his victory was overturned by the courts, and he lost the subsequent by-election that was held later that year. He was elected in a subsequent 1876 by-election, again won election in the 1878 election, and sat in the House of Commons of Canada for the next twenty years. A supporter of Sir John A. Macdonald, White was a believer in the National Policy.

Following the 1891 election, Macdonald nominated White to be Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada. Macdonald died soon after, and White presided over a tumultuous period in the House of Commons as a succession of Conservative Prime Ministers attempted to hold the party and government together in the absence of the party&#x27;s long time leader. Debates over the Manitoba Schools Question were particularly divisive, and brought down the government of Sir Mackenzie Bowell. White opposed the government&#x27;s policy that favoured Catholic education rights as he believed that it interfered with the provincial government&#x27;s right to set education policy, but, as Speaker, remained silent on the issue until the 1896 election campaign. Despite his independence on the issue, White lost his seat in the election and failed in several attempts to return to the House until the 1904 election when he finally regained a seat. By this time, he was in declining health, and was unable to regularly attend House sittings. He died in office in 1906.

<doc id="889777" wikidata="Q2497963" url="?curid=889777" title="Noel Counihan">
<text>Noel Jack Counihan (4 October 19135 July 1986) was an Australian social realist painter, printmaker, cartoonist and illustrator active in the 1940s and 1950s in Melbourne. An atheist, communist, and art activist, Counihan made art in response to the politics and social hardships of his times. He is regarded as one of Australia&#x27;s major artists of the 20th century.

==Early life==
Counihan was born on 4 October 1913 in Albert Park, then a working-class suburb of Melbourne. He attended the St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne Choir school (closed in 1929), then Caulfield Grammar School in 1928. He studied part-time under Charles Wheeler at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in Melbourne during 1930–31, where he met the social realists Herbert McClintock and Roy Dalgarno.

==Career==
Social realism, the belief that art should reflect the realities of society under capitalism, was the artistic doctrine of the Communist Party of Australia, and in 1931 Counihan became a confirmed atheist and a member of the Party. He helped found the Workers Art Guild, and began printmaking, producing linocuts and lithographs for Communist magazine covers and pamphlets as well as designing banners.

During the Great Depression Counihan participated in the &quot;free speech&quot; fights in Brunswick, organised by the Communist Party in response to a Victorian state government law banning &quot;subversive&quot; gatherings. Dozens of members of the Unemployed Workers Movement were arrested, and unemployed meetings at the intersection of Phoenix Street and Sydney Road, Brunswick, were dispersed by police. As part of this fight, Counihan addressed a crowd on 19 May 1933 from within a locked cart to prevent arrest. Police had to cut him out, to the jeers of the crowd, as he continued speaking.

From 1934 Counihan worked as a cartoonist for various publications, including &quot;The Bulletin&quot; and the Communist Party&#x27;s paper, the &quot;Guardian&quot;, from 1945 to 1949 and again from 1952 to 1958. He spent extended periods in hospital with tuberculosis during World War II. With the encouragement of the artist Yosl Bergner, he began to paint. He developed a personal style based on the social realist approach, producing compassionate images of workers and their working lives. Counihan maintained that the artist had a duty to &quot;gather information from the political developments of the time&quot;.

His 1955 painting &quot;On Parliament Steps&quot; won the George Crouch Memorial Prize in 1956.

Counihan remained loyal to the Communist Party during its various splits and despite its declining support in the 1970s and 1980s.

His 1973 posthumous portrait of Hugh Gemmell Lamb-Smith – who had taught Counihan at Caulfield Grammar and, as well, had encouraged his artistic endeavours whilst he was there – largely painted from memory, and commissioned by the Caulfield Grammarians&#x27; Association, is on permanent display within the school&#x27;s &quot;Cripps Centre&quot; on its Caulfield Campus.

In 1979, Counihan contributed the entry on footballer Roy Cazaly to volume 7 of the &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot;.

==Death==
On 5 July 1986, Counihan died in Canterbury, Melbourne, aged 72.

==Legacy==
The Counihan Gallery, managed by City of Merri-bek Council, is named in his honour. To mark its tenth anniversary, Edwina Bartlem curated an exhibition in which contemporary artists created works inspired by the art and ideas of Counihan. The artists included George Gittoes and Angela Cavalieri.

A short distance away from the Gallery, outside the Brunswick Mechanics Institute on Sydney Road, a Free Speech memorial has been built by artist Simon Perry to commemorate the free speech fights by the unemployed in 1933 and Noel Counihan&#x27;s part in them.

The Geelong Gallery held an exhibition of his works, titled &quot;A People&#x27;s Press&quot;, from 2 November 2024 to 10 March 2025.

<text>Kix (stylized as KiX) is an American brand of breakfast cereal introduced in 1937 by the General Mills company of Golden Valley, Minnesota. The product is an extruded, expanded puffed-grain cereal made with cornmeal.

== Products ==
General Mills introduced Berry Berry Kix in 1992 and Honey Kix in 2009. In Original Kix, total sugars are about 10% by weight, which is about 3 grams of sugar per serving. Honey Kix has 6 grams, Berry Berry Kix has 7 grams.

== Production ==

The grain is processed and expanded: water is added and the corn is pulverized. Kix are cooked in the &quot;extruder&quot;, when the dough is formed into the desired shape by extrusion through a die. It was the first cereal to be manufactured using this process.

Experimentation with the Kix puffing process led to popular brands like Cheerios (1941). Trix, Cocoa Puffs, and Reese&#x27;s Puffs also utilize this process.

== Promotions ==
In 1947, Kix offered a Lone Ranger atomic bomb ring in exchange for a box top and 15 cents. The ring contained a spinthariscope, so that when the red base (which served as a &quot;secret message compartment&quot;) was taken off, and after a period of time for dark adaptation, you could look through a small plastic lens at scintillations caused by polonium alpha particles striking a zinc sulfide screen.

== Advertising ==

The slogan &quot;Kid Tested. Mother Approved.&quot; was introduced in 1978. During the 1980s, television commercials included the jingle &quot;Kids love Kix for what Kix has got. Moms love Kix for what Kix has not,&quot; the latter a reference to its claims of no added food coloring or flavors. 

In 2018, the slogan was changed to “Kid Tested. Parent Approved.” At the time Mike Siemienas, General Mills spokesperson said “this new slogan is more inclusive as the word ‘parent’ applies to the individuals raising children.”

<doc id="889790" wikidata="Q159569" url="?curid=889790" title="Carl Reinecke">
<text>Carl Heinrich Carsten Reinecke (23 June 182410 March 1910) was a German composer, conductor, and pianist in the mid-Romantic era.

==Biography==

Reinecke was born in what is today the Hamburg district of Altona; technically he was born a Dane, as until 1864 the town was under Danish rule. He received all his musical instruction from his father, (Johann Peter) Rudolf Reinecke (22 November 179514 August 1883), a music teacher and writer on musical subjects. Carl first devoted himself to violin-playing, but later on turned his attention to the piano. He began to compose at the age of seven, and his first public appearance as a pianist was when he was twelve years old.

At the age of 19, he undertook his first concert tour as a pianist in 1843, through Denmark and Sweden, after which he lived for a long time in Leipzig, where he studied under Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann and Franz Liszt; he entered into friendly relations with the former two. After the stay in Leipzig, Reinecke went on tour with Königslöw and Wilhelm Joseph von Wasielewski (later Schumann&#x27;s biographer), in North Germany and Denmark. In 1846, Reinecke was appointed Court Pianist for Christian VIII in Copenhagen. There he remained until 1848, when he resigned and went to Paris. 

Overall, he wrote four concertos for his instrument (and many cadenzas for others&#x27; works, including a large set published as his Opus 87), as well as concertos for violin, cello, harp and flute. In the winter of 1850/51, Carl Schurz reports attending weekly &quot;musical evenings&quot; in Paris where Reinecke was in attendance.

In 1851, Reinecke became a professor at the Cologne Conservatory. In ensuing years he was appointed musical director in Barmen, and became the academic, musical director and conductor of the Singakademie at Breslau.

In 1860, Reinecke was appointed director of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and professor of composition and piano at the Leipzig Conservatory. He led the orchestra for more than three decades, until 1895. He conducted premieres such as the full seven-movement version of Brahms&#x27;s &quot;A German Requiem&quot; (1869). In 1865 the Gewandhaus-Quartett premiered his piano quintet, and in 1892 his D major string quartet.

Reinecke is best known for his flute sonata &quot;Undine&quot;, but he is also remembered as one of the most influential and versatile musicians of his time. He served as a teacher for 35 years, until his retirement in 1902. His students included Edvard Grieg, Basil Harwood, Charles Villiers Stanford, Christian Sinding, Leoš Janáček, Isaac Albéniz, August Max Fiedler, Walter Niemann, Johan Svendsen, Richard Franck, Felix Weingartner, Max Bruch, Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis, Anna Diller Starbuck, Ernest Hutcheson, Felix Fox, Sofie Rohnstock, August Winding, Elisabeth Wintzer, Mykola Lysenko, and many others. 

After retirement from the conservatory, Reinecke devoted his time to composition, resulting in almost three hundred published works. He wrote several operas (none of which are performed today) including &quot;König Manfred&quot;. During this time, he frequently made concert tours to England and elsewhere. His piano playing belonged to a school in which grace and neatness were characteristic, and at one time he was probably unrivaled as a Mozart player and an accompanist. In 1904 at the age of 80, he made recordings of seven works playing on piano roll for the Welte-Mignon company, making him the earliest-born pianist to have his playing preserved in any format. He subsequently made a further 14 for the Aeolian Company&#x27;s &quot;Autograph Metrostyle&quot; piano roll visual marking system and an additional 20 for the Hupfeld DEA reproducing piano roll system.

Reinecke died in Leipzig at age 85.

<text>The Brielse Meer (&quot;Lake Den Briel&quot;) is a long, narrow lake between the Dutch estuary islands of Voorne and Rozenburg in the province of South Holland.

The lake takes its name from Den Briel, a town on its shore. It was formerly a branch of the Meuse known as the Brielse Maas (Den Briel Meuse), which ran from the Botlek strait near Rotterdam into the North Sea. The first stretch, between Botlek and the former confluence with the Het Scheur branch, was alternatively known as (the last stretch of) the Nieuwe Maas.

When the Brielse Maas silted up in the late nineteenth century, the Nieuwe Waterweg ship canal was constructed (1872) and Het Scheur was separated from the Brielse Maas by a dam. As a to the Delta Works sea barrier constructions, the Brielse Maas was closed off at both ends in 1950, becoming the Brielse Meer.</text><links>

<text>Einar Hoidale (August 17, 1870 – December 5, 1952) was an American lawyer, newspaper editor and elected official. He served as a member of the United States House of Representatives during the 1930s.

==Biography==
Einar Hoidale was born at Tromsø in Troms, Norway. He was the son of Andrew Hoidale and Dorthea (Lund) Hoidale. He immigrated to the United States with his family at the age of seven. From 1890, he served as editor of the &quot;Western Guard &quot; newspaper in Madison, Minnesota. He graduated from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1898. He was admitted to the State of Minnesota bar the same year. He commenced practice in New Ulm, Minnesota with Henry Northrup Somsen (1875-1955). He subsequently served as prosecuting attorney for Brown County, Minnesota from 1900 to 1906. From 1900 to 1908, he also served a judge advocate for the Minnesota State Militia.

He was the Democratic Party candidate for the United States Senate from Minnesota in 1930. He was elected at-large to the United States House of Representatives and served in the 73rd Congress from 1933 to 1935. He lost a subsequent election after being nominated again for the U.S. Senate. In both of his Senate campaigns, Hoidale was involved in competitive 3-way races with Republican Party and Farmer Labor Party candidates, and came in second place both times. In 1930, he was barely defeated by Republican incumbent Thomas Schall, ahead of former Congressman and future senator Ernest Lundeen of the Farmer Labor Party. In 1934, he lost to Farmer Labor incumbent Henrik Shipstead.
He died in St. Petersburg, Florida and was buried at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

<doc id="889802" wikidata="Q716827" url="?curid=889802" title="David Berg">
<text>David Brandt Berg (February 18, 1919 – October 1, 1994), also known as King David, Mo, Moses David, Father David, Dad, or Grandpa to followers, was the founder and leader of the cult generally known as the Children of God and subsequently as The Family International. Berg&#x27;s group, founded in 1968 among the counterculture youth in Southern California, gained notoriety for incorporating sexuality into its spiritual message and recruitment methods. Berg and his organization were accused of a broad range of sexual misconduct, including child sexual abuse.

==Life==
=== Family heritage ===
Berg&#x27;s maternal grandfather was John Lincoln Brandt (1860–1946), a Disciples of Christ minister, author, and lecturer of Muskogee, Oklahoma. Brandt had a dramatic conversion in his mid-twenties and immediately entered full-time Christian service. For years he was a Methodist circuit rider. He later became a leader of the Alexander Campbell movement of the Disciples of Christ, a restoration movement that developed into the current Protestant denomination Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).

===Early years (1919–1969)===
Berg was born on February 18, 1919, in Oakland, California. During his early years, he usually lived in or around Florida.

He was the youngest of three children born to Hjalmar Emmanuel Berg and Virginia Lee Brandt, both Christian evangelists. His father was Swedish.

Virginia and Hjalmar were expelled from the Disciples of Christ after publicly testifying of her divine healing, which was contrary to church doctrine. They subsequently joined a new denomination, the Christian and Missionary Alliance, shortly before David&#x27;s birth. In later years, their missionary zeal and disdain for denominational politicking often set them at variance with the conservative faction of that church&#x27;s hierarchy, causing them to work largely as independent pastors and evangelists.

Berg spent his early years traveling with his parents, who pursued their evangelical mission. In 1924, they settled in Miami, Florida, after Virginia successfully led a series of large revivals at the Miami Gospel Tabernacle. This became Berg&#x27;s home for the next 14 years, while his mother and father were pastors at a number of Miami churches. The Berg family depended entirely on the generosity of their parishioners for their support, and often had difficulty making ends meet. This instilled in Berg a lifelong habit of frugality, which he encouraged his followers to adopt.

Berg graduated from Monterey High School in 1935 and later attended Elliott School of Business Administration. Like his father, Berg became a minister in the Christian and Missionary Alliance in the late 1940s, and was placed at Valley Farms, Arizona. Berg was eventually expelled from the organization for differences in teachings and for alleged sexual misconduct with a church employee. In Berg&#x27;s writings he claimed the expulsion was due to his support for greater racial diversity among his congregation.

Fred Jordan, Berg&#x27;s friend and boss, allowed Berg and his personal family to open and run a branch of his Soul Clinic in Miami, Florida, as a missionary training school. After running into trouble with local authorities over his aggressive disapproval of evolution being taught as fact in public schools, Berg moved his family to Fred Jordan&#x27;s Texas Soul Clinic, in Western Texas.

===The Children of God/The Family (1968–1994)===
Berg and his family founded the organization Teens for Christ, operating out of the Light Club coffeehouse in Huntington Beach, California, in 1968. While in California, after receiving strong resistance from local churches due to his followers picketing them, he took the whole group of 40–100 people on the road. It was while they were camped in Lewis and Clark Park that a news reporter first called them &quot;The Children of God&quot;.

In the mid-1970s, Berg began preparing his followers for a &quot;revelation&quot; he had about Flirty Fishing, or winning important, influential men through prostitution. 

In 1978, in an attempt to deflect public concern over some of his more controversial policies, Berg changed the name to the &quot;Family of Love&quot;. In 1991, this was changed to &quot;The Family&quot;, and in 2004 it was changed again to &quot;The Family International&quot;.

Berg lived in seclusion, communicating with his followers and the public via nearly 3,000 &quot;Mo Letters&quot; (&quot;Mo&quot; from his pseudonym &quot;Moses David&quot;) that he wrote on a wide variety of subjects. These typically covered spiritual or practical subjects and were used as a way of disseminating and introducing policy and religious doctrine to his followers. Berg&#x27;s letters admonished the reader to &quot;love the sinner but hate the sin&quot;. His writings were often extreme and uncompromising in their denunciation of what he believed to be evil, such as mainstream churches, pedophilia laws, capitalism, and Jews.

===Death and legacy===
Berg, who had been in hiding since 1971, died in November 1994 in Portugal. He was buried in Costa de Caparica, and his remains were cremated. 

After his death in 1994, his wife led The Family, and there were 6,000 adults and 3,000 children as members of The Family worldwide, in 50 countries. There were investigations of The Family for child abuse and prostitution in Argentina, France, Spain, Australia, Venezuela, and Peru.

==Sexual abuse, antisemitism, and apocalyptic predictions==
Berg has been accused of leading a group which promoted assaults on children and sexual abuse of women and children for decades. Former members have told their stories in widely disseminated media reports, though official inquiries at the time found no evidence of child abuse.

In a child custody case in the United Kingdom, Berg&#x27;s granddaughter, Merry Berg, testified that Berg sexually molested her when she was a young teenager.

The allegations of Berg&#x27;s institutionalization of pedophilia and sexual abuse were also described in &quot;Not Without My Sister&quot;, an autobiographical recount of the sexual abuse of three sisters who eventually escaped The Family.

Berg&#x27;s Jewish ancestry notwithstanding, in 1745, one of his mother&#x27;s forebears, Jewish by birth but a Christian convert, moved to the American colonies and lived as a Mennonite—David Berg was outspokenly antisemitic, believing that the Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus, as well as all persecution of Christians in the world. In support of his views of an international Jewish conspiracy, he cited the forged &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, but disclaimed the label &quot;antisemitic.&quot;

Berg predicted that the state of California would be subject to a massive earthquake in 1969.

==Personal life==
Berg married his first wife, Jane Miller (known as &quot;Mother Eve&quot; in the Children of God), on July 22, 1944, in Glendale, California. They had four children.

Berg married his second wife, Karen Zerby, in 1970. Berg informally adopted Ricky Rodriguez, Zerby&#x27;s son. In the 1970s and 1980s, sexually suggestive photographic depictions of Rodriguez with adult caretakers were disseminated throughout the group by Berg and Zerby in a childrearing handbook known as &quot;The Story of Davidito&quot;. In January 2005, Ricky Rodriguez murdered one of the female caretakers shown in the handbook before taking his own life several hours later.

<doc id="889804" wikidata="Q132329" url="?curid=889804" title="Apple maggot">
<text>The apple maggot (Rhagoletis pomonella), also known as the railroad worm (but distinct from the &quot;Phrixothrix&quot; beetle larva, also called railroad worm), is a species of fruit fly, and a pest of several types of fruits, mostly apples. This species evolved about 150 years ago through a sympatric shift from the native host hawthorn to the domesticated apple species &quot;Malus domestica&quot; in the northeastern United States. This fly is believed to have been accidentally spread to the western United States from the endemic eastern United States region through contaminated apples at multiple points throughout the 20th century. The apple maggot uses Batesian mimicry as a method of defense, with coloration resembling that of the forelegs and pedipalps of a jumping spider (family Salticidae).

The adult form of this insect is about long, slightly smaller than a housefly. The larva, which is the stage of this insect&#x27;s lifecycle that causes the actual damage to the fruit, is similar to a typical fly larva or maggot. Caterpillars, especially the larvae of the codling moth, that infest the insides of apples are often confused with the apple maggot. However, these organisms generally feed in the apple&#x27;s core while apple maggots feed on the fruit flesh. The apple maggot larvae are often difficult to detect in infested fruit due to their pale, cream color and small body size. The adult fly lays its eggs inside the fruit. Larvae consume the fruit and cause it to bruise, decay, and finally drop before ripening. The insect overwinters as a pupa in the soil. It only emerges after metamorphosis into a relatively defenseless fly. Adults emerge from late June through September, with their peak flight times occurring in August.

==Description==
Eggs are fusiform and pearly white when laid in fruit, but after a short period of time in the fruit, they turn a cream color. Developing larvae can be clearly seen within the translucent eggs.

The larva is white or cream-colored, but if it eats green pulp near the fruit skin, the green shows through the skin. Larvae range in length from 7 to 8.5 mm and in width from 1.75 to 2 mm.

The pupa is formed inside the larval skin after the maggot shortens and becomes inactive. During the pupal stage, the larva is initially light yellow, but turns yellow-brown within hours and darkens. The pupae range in length from 4 to 5 mm and in width from 2 to 2.5 mm and are an elongated oval shape.

Adult female &quot;R. pomonella&quot; are shiny black with white markings and an average length of 6.25 mm. Their wingspan averages 12 mm. They have green eyes and a white stripe on each side of the thorax. The abdomen is shiny black with four uniform white bands. When the ovipositor is not in use, it is retracted completely into the abdomen. The ovipositor is horn-like, hard, and chitinous. Male &quot;R. pomonella&quot; have a similar appearance to the females but are smaller with an average length of 4–5 mm; the size of the abdomen is the main difference, with only five of the seven segments visible (the sixth and seventh are retracted under the fifth). The sixth and seventh segments contain a chitinous framework that support a long, spiraling (when coiled) chitinous penis, which is terminated by a spiral brush with numerous stiff hairs.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Rhagoletis pomonella&quot; is prevalent in North America, though endemic only to the eastern United States. The range of the apple race is contained within that of the hawthorn race, including the northeastern and midwestern US as well as eastern Canada. The species has been found as far south as Florida. In 1979, the apple maggot was reported to be found for the first time on a backyard tree in Portland, Oregon. California quarantine inspection records show apple maggot infest fruit have been intercepted at border patrol stations since around 1950. A misidentified apple maggot, originally thought to be the snowberry maggot &quot;Rhagoletis zephyria&quot;, was found in the Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA) tephritid fly collection, and the fly was collected in 1951 in Rowena, Oregon. The ODA conducted a survey in 1980 to measure the distribution of the apple maggot, and traps in southwestern Washington showed apple maggot distribution in and around Vancouver, Washington, a suburb of Portland, Oregon. The apple maggot has spread to the Northwest, including Washington, Oregon, and northern California. They are believed to have been spread through contaminated apples, most likely to have been accidentally introduced to the western United States multiple times over the past few decades. This theory is supported by lack of &quot;R. pomonella&quot; infestation on &quot;C. douglasii&quot; in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, implying that the fly in these regions is not native on hawthorn. There are recorded sightings of &quot;R. pomonella&quot; from Southern Utah and New Mexico, as well as in the Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains and the Altiplano central highlands of Mexico.

The original ancestral host of the apple maggot was the wild hawthorn (&quot;Crataegus&quot; spp.), but in the mid-1800s when the apple (&quot;Malus&quot; spp.) was introduced to North America, &quot;R. pomonella&quot;, able to take advantage of the new host, evolved. Peach, pear, cherry, plum, chokeberry, cranberry, dogwood, and fruits of the Japanese roses &quot;Rosa rugosa and Rosa carolina&quot; can also host apple maggots. However, apple maggots are not usually a serious pest of plums, cherries, and pears; larvae have been found in pears but not adult flies.

==Life history==
Flies emerge in the summer beginning in June and continuing through August and September, and eggs are laid in the apple fruit. The fly cycles through one generation a year with adults living up to four weeks. In Oregon and Washington, apple maggots have been found to emerge in early July with peak times in late August or early September. Flies have been found as late as November, and larvae have been found in late December.

Females deposit eggs one by one via ovipositor in the skin of the fruit. Punctures are difficult to see with the naked eye at first but are visible once the wound darkens. A female can produce 300 to 400 eggs in her lifetime, and eggs develop in succession and are deposited as soon as they mature. Studies show that eggs develop faster at warmer temperatures that they do at cooler temperatures. When the weather is exceptionally warm, eggs may develop just two weeks after emergence. Eggs hatch within two to six days, and larvae feed on the fruit ranging from two weeks to more than two months, depending on temperature and on the hardness of the fruit. Young larvae are difficult to see because they are the same white color as the pulp. Larvae spend the pupal stage in the soil at a depth of one to two inches in the ground or sometimes in decayed fruit. Early-emerging larvae may only spend a month in the pupal stage, but late-emerging larvae remain dormant throughout the winter.

==Feeding behavior==
Haws and crab-apples are the original food source of the flies, but they have moved to feeding on mainly apples, though they have been found feeding on other cultivated fruits. Male and female flies feed constantly from the surface of their food source, primarily apples. The fly extends its proboscis and drops saliva onto the skin of the apple, and the saliva is used as a solvent for substances on the apple. If drier substances are present, the fly dissolves them before sucking up fluid. Larvae use chitinous hooks to cut through pulp just below the skin of the fruit, producing characteristic brown markings, leading to the larvae being called &quot;railroad worms&quot;. If the apples are still growing, larvae burrows are difficult to find because they heal quickly. Softened apples allow larvae to grow rapidly and break down pulp, even to the point of feeding at the core.

==Mating==
&quot;Rhagoletis pomonella&quot; adult flies may begin copulation as early as eight days old. Males attempt copulation when females are in oviposition on fruit. The male springs onto the female and positions his forefeet on her abdomen and his second pair of feet on her wings. The male waits and uncoils his spring-like penis, quickly entering the opening of the ovipositor when the female extends it. Mating occurs on the host plant and averages thirty minutes, during which the flies are attached and can fly about. Then, when the flies separate, the ovipositor and penis are quickly retracted.

The flies undergo multiple matings, which benefits both sexes. Generally, multiple mating is thought to be a more adaptive strategy for males because of male potential to fertilize many females and the trend of greater female parental investment. However, studies have shown increased female fecundity and fertility from multiple matings. Females have long-term sperm storage, and there is little to no parental investment after she lays eggs. A 2000 study by Opp and Prokopy found that male and female apple maggot flies mated up to six times a day in males and eight times in females, thus there is most likely no mating refractory period, unlike other tephritid species like Mediterranean fruit flies, whose females may mate only after stored sperm is depleted.

==Threats==

===Predators===
The apple maggot is not as heavily targeted by predators and parasites as other insects because for most of its lifespan it is inaccessible, living inside apples as larvae and in soil as pupae. Occasionally flies are captured by various species of spiders, such as the &quot;Dendryphantes militaris&quot;, which predates on flies in apple trees. Birds may feed on larvae, pupae, or adults. Some full-grown maggots leaving the apples are taken by ants. The maggot stage has other predators including several braconid wasps: &quot;Utetes canaliculatus&quot;, &quot;Diachasmimorpha mellea&quot;, and &quot;Diachasma alloeum&quot;.

===Egg parasite===
A 1920 study showed that apple maggot eggs were parasitized by &quot;Anaphoidea conotrecheli&quot;, which is a common egg parasite of plum curculio and grape curculio. The study states that the abundance of &quot;Anaphoidea conotrecheli&quot; parasitization of apple maggot eggs would depend on the abundance of the eggs of its principal host, the plum curculio.

===Larval parasite===
&quot;Opius mellus&quot; (&quot;Biosteres rhagoletis&quot;) was bred from puparia of apple maggots in Maine in 1914 and was also found in blueberry barrens. This parasite was also found by other researchers in other parts of Maine and in Nova Scotia. The parasite oviposits in the maggots, which then mature and enter the pupal stage as usual. However, the maggot does not develop normally from here on out; come spring, an adult parasite emerges from the puparium. In a 1922 study, &quot;Opius ferrugineus&quot; was also found to emerge as a parasite from apple maggot puparia.

==Protective mimicry==
The adult fly uses Batesian mimicry for defense. The fly has white markings on its thorax and a characteristic black banding shaped like an &quot;F&quot; on its wings. When threatened, it turns its wings 90° and moves them up and down while walking sideways; the combination mimics the appearance of the jumping spider due to the wing pattern in the new position appearing as additional legs, specifically the forelegs and pedipalps.

==Evolution==
&quot;Rhagoletis pomonella&quot; is representative of adaptive evolution; the race that feeds on apples spontaneously evolved from the hawthorn-feeding race in 1800 to 1850 CE after apples were introduced into North America. The apple-feeding race does not normally feed on hawthorns, and the hawthorn-feeding race does not normally feed on apples. Based on research performed by Guy Bush, Jeffrey Feder, and others, this constitutes a possible example of an early step towards the emergence of a new species, a case of sympatric speciation. In addition, the hawthorn and apple host races of &quot;R. pomonella&quot; are able to produce viable offspring in a lab setting, but in nature, flies maintain their genetic integrity partly because of allochronic premating isolation from differently timed adult eclosion. Flies that infest apples eclose before flies that infest the hawthorn, which fruits later than apples.

The emergence of the apple race of &quot;R. pomonella&quot; also appears to have driven formation of new races among its parasites.

==Interactions with humans==
&quot;Rhagoletis pomonella&quot; is a significant pest for apple crops because the species feeds on apples and lays eggs within the fruit. The hatched maggots burrow tunnels within the apples and cause them to fall prematurely and create unsightly brown spots.

&quot;Rhagoletis mendax&quot; or the blueberry maggot fly is a related species that is a pest of cultivated blueberries.

===Control===
Infestation of maggots damages the fruit through the formation of winding tunnels. There is no external indication of maggots, but brown trails can be seen beneath the skin. Therefore, to manage apple maggot infestation, farmers may destroy infested apples, hawthorn, and abandoned apple trees. Apple maggots may be killed by placing infested fruit in cold storage of 32 degrees Fahrenheit for forty days. Some biological control agents have not been found to be effective because apple maggots are hidden within the fruit. Sprays for control of the codling moth, &quot;Cydia pomonella&quot;, have been able to partially control the apple maggot but cannot be completely depended on for commercially accepted control. Naturally occurring parasitoids have been suggested to be used to manage the apple maggot. &quot;Opius downesi&quot; Gahan and &quot;Opius lectoides&quot; Gahan shifted from the show berry maggot to apple maggots in hawthorn, reducing apple maggot density at two study sites in Oregon, according to a paper published in 1985.

<doc id="889831" wikidata="Q2038371" url="?curid=889831" title="Labyrinthitis">
<text>Labyrinthitis is inflammation of the labyrinth, a maze of fluid-filled channels in the inner ear. Vestibular neuritis is inflammation of the vestibular nerve (the nerve in the ear that sends messages related to motion and position to the brain). Both conditions involve inflammation of the inner ear. Labyrinths that house the vestibular system sense changes in the head&#x27;s position or the head&#x27;s motion. Inflammation of these inner ear parts results in a vertigo (sensation of the world spinning) and also possible hearing loss or tinnitus (ringing in the ears). It can occur as a single attack, a series of attacks, or a persistent condition that diminishes over three to six weeks. It may be associated with nausea, vomiting, and eye nystagmus.
The cause is often not clear. It may be due to a virus, but it can also arise from bacterial infection, head injury, extreme stress, an allergy, or as a reaction to medication. 30% of affected people had a common cold prior to developing the disease. Either bacterial or viral labyrinthitis can cause a permanent hearing loss in rare cases. This appears to result from an imbalance of neuronal input between the left and right inner ears.

==Signs and symptoms==
The main symptoms are severe vertigo and nystagmus. The most common symptom of vestibular neuritis is the onset of vertigo that has formed from an ongoing infection or trauma. The dizziness sensation that is associated with vertigo is thought to be from the inner ear labyrinth. Rapid and undesired eye motion (nystagmus) often results from the improper indication of rotational motion. Nausea, anxiety, and a general ill feeling are common due to the distorted balance signals that the brain receives from the inner ear system. Other common symptoms include tinnitus, ear ache, and a feeling of fullness in the ear.

==Causes==
Some people will report having an upper respiratory infection (common cold) or flu prior to the onset of the symptoms of vestibular neuritis; others will have no viral symptoms prior to the vertigo attack.

Some cases of vestibular neuritis are thought to be caused by an infection of the vestibular ganglion by the herpes simplex type 1 virus. However, the cause of this condition is not fully understood, and in fact, many different viruses may be capable of infecting the vestibular nerve.

Acute localized ischemia of these structures also may be an important cause. Especially in children, vestibular neuritis may be preceded by symptoms of a common cold. However, the causative mechanism remains uncertain.

This can also be brought on by pressure changes such as those experienced while flying or scuba diving.

==Mechanism==
In the vestibular system, there are three canals that are semicircular in shape that input sensory clues. These canals allow the brain to sense rotational motion and linear motion changes. The brain then uses the sensory input clues and the visual input clues from the vestibular system to retain balance. The vestibulo-ocular reflex retains continuous visual focus during motion which is also the vestibular system&#x27;s purpose during activity.

==Treatment==
The treatment for vestibular neuritis depends on the cause. However, symptoms of vertigo can be treated in the same way as other vestibular dysfunctions with vestibular rehabilitation.

===Physical therapy===
Typical treatments include combinations of head and eye movements, postural changes, and walking exercises. Specifically, exercises that may be prescribed include keeping eyes fixated on a specific target while moving the head, moving the head right to left at two targets at a significant distance apart, walking while keeping eyes fixated on a specific target, and walking while keeping eyes fixated on a specific target while also turning the head in different directions.
The main function behind repeating a combination of head and eye movements, postural changes and walking is that through this repetition, compensatory changes for the dysfunctions arising from peripheral vestibular structures may be promoted in the central vestibular system (brainstem and cerebellum).

Vestibular rehabilitation therapy is a highly effective way to substantially reduce or eliminate residual dizziness from labyrinthitis. VRT works by causing the brain to use already existing neural mechanisms for adaptation, neuroplasticity, and compensation. Vestibular neuritis rehabilitation is an effective and safe management to improve symptoms. The vestibular neuritis rehabilitation can improve symptoms or resolve the symptoms which is dependent on each individual.

Rehabilitation strategies most commonly used are:

*Gaze stability exercises – moving the head from side to side while fixated on a stationary object (aimed at assisting the eye to fixate during head rotation without the input from the lost canal vestibulo-ocular reflex). An advanced progression of this exercise would be walking in a straight line while looking side to side by turning the head.
*Habituation exercises – movements designed to provoke symptoms and subsequently reduce the negative vestibular response upon repetition. Examples of these include Brandt–Daroff exercises.
*Functional retraining – including postural control, relaxation, and balance training.

These exercises function by challenging the vestibular system. Progression occurs by increasing the amplitude of the head or focal point movements, increasing the speed of movement, and combining movements such as walking and head turning.

One study found that patients who believed their illness was out of their control showed the slowest progression to full recovery, long after the initial vestibular injury had healed. The study revealed that the patient who compensated well was one who, at the psychological level, was not afraid of the symptoms and had some positive control over them. Notably, a reduction in negative beliefs over time was greater in those patients treated with rehabilitation than in those untreated. &quot;Of utmost importance, baseline beliefs were the only significant predictor of change in a handicap at 6 months follow-up.&quot;

===Medication===
Vestibular neuritis is generally a self-limiting disease. Treatment with drugs is neither effective nor necessary. The effect of glucocorticoids has been studied, but they have not been found to significantly affect long-term outcome.

Symptomatic treatment with antihistaminics such as cinnarizine, however, can be used to suppress the symptoms of vestibular neuritis while it spontaneously regresses. Prochlorperazine is another commonly prescribed medication to help alleviate the symptoms of vertigo and nausea.

===Mental disorders===
Because mood disorders can hamper recovery from labyrinthitis, treatment may also include any co-occurring anxiety disorder or depression. Severe anxiety episodes are usually addressed by short-term benzodiazepine therapy.

==Prognosis==
Recovery from acute labyrinthine inflammation generally takes from one to six weeks, but it is not uncommon for residual symptoms such as dysequilibrium and dizziness to last for a couple of months.

Recovery from a temporarily damaged inner ear typically follows two phases:
# An acute period, which may include severe vertigo and vomiting
# approximately two weeks of sub-acute symptoms and rapid recovery

== Epidemiology ==
Labyrinthitis affects approximately 35 million people per year (approximately 3.5 cases per 100,000 people). It typically occurs in those between 30 and 60 years of age, and there are no significant differences between male and female incidence rates. In 95% of cases, sufferers experience a single attack and fully recover. Vestibular rehabilitation showed a statistically significant increase in controlling symptoms over no intervention in people who have vestibular neuritis.

<text>Star City () is an area in Zvyozdny gorodok, Moscow Oblast, Russia, which has since the 1960s been home to the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC). Officially, the area was known as &quot;closed military townlet No. 1&quot; and at various times had also been designated as Shchyolkovo-14 () and Zvyozdny ().


==Overview==
Members of today’s Roscosmos Cosmonaut Corps and the Soviet space program before it, have lived and trained in Star City since the 1960s. In the Soviet era the location was a highly secret and guarded military installation, access to which was severely restricted. Many Russian cosmonauts, past and present, and Training Centre&#x27;s personnel, live in Star City with their families. The facility has its own post office, high school, shops, child day care/kindergarten, movie theater, sports and recreation facilities, railway station, and a museum of space travel and human exploration. Air transportation is available through nearby Chkalovsky Air Base.

In the summer 1992, American &quot;Youth Science Ambassadors&quot; sponsored by People to People International were hosted at Star City where they were treated to a presentation by cosmonaut Anatoly Artsebarsky. In the mid- to late 1990s, groups of select students from high school in Star City participated in the Russian American Cultural Exchange Program (RACE). Students first hosted, then visited, American counterparts attending five high schools in the United States.

There is a statue of the &quot;space dog&quot; Laika, the first animal to orbit the Earth, in Star City.

==Transportation==
Transportation needs are met by the no. 380 bus route and taxis that stop near the border checkpoints, and by a railway station located at a short walking distance.

==Incorporation==
For most of its history, the space training center was in jurisdiction of the Soviet and then Russian military. However, in August 1996, due to the changes in legislation the center became subordinated both to the Ministry of Defense and to the Roscosmos (Russian Federal Space Agency). This double status remained in effect until October 1, 2008, when the center was re-organized and subordinated directly and solely to the Roscosmos. As a result, the status of the territory of Star City was changed from military to civil, and the territory itself was incorporated as a closed administrative-territorial formation of Zvyozdny gorodok. Within the closed formation, the territory was organized on June 16, 2009 as an inhabited locality with the status of a work settlement. A proposal to officially name the work settlement as Zvyozdny gorodok was submitted to the federal government on October 29, 2009, but as of 2011 had not yet been officially approved.

==NASA in Star City==
The &quot;Prophylactory&quot; (aka the &quot;Prophy&quot;), was a three-floor dormitory built by the Russians to house Americans during the Apollo–Soyuz Project. NASA leased the second floor for team housing and for the office of the Director of Operations, Russia. NASA also built several duplexes for housing, during the Shuttle–Mir program.

NASA flight surgeon Michael Barratt stated during an oral history interview in 1998, &quot;Star City has always been kind of felt as the forbidden city or the hidden city. It wasn&#x27;t on any maps, certainly, by then. It was a secret cosmonaut training base. Of course, everyone knew where it was, but it was considered a closed and secure city&quot;.

<doc id="889841" wikidata="Q1336562" url="?curid=889841" title="Soulmate">
<text>A soulmate is a person with whom one feels a deep or natural affinity. This affinity may involve similarity, love romance, comfort, intimacy, sexuality, sexual activity, spirituality, compatibility, and trust. The idea of &quot;soulmates&quot; is found in Judaism and Hinduism but was popularized in the 19th-century Theosophy religion and modern New Age philosophy.

== Definition ==
In the modern day, &quot;soulmate&quot; typically refers to a romantic or platonic partner, implying an exclusive lifelong bond. It commonly holds the connotation of being the strongest bond that one can achieve with another person. People who believe in soulmates commonly accept that one will feel &quot;complete&quot; once they have found their soulmate, as it is partially in the perceived definition that two souls are meant to unite. The term &quot;soulmate&quot; first appeared in the English language in a letter by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1822.

==Historical usage of the concept==

===Judaism===
The term &quot;soulmate&quot; may have initially been borrowed from the 16th-century poem Yedid Nefesh. This poem became popular due to its customary weekly recital by traditional Jews during their final Shabbos/Shabbat meal, seudah shlishit, as a means of comfort during the day&#x27;s waning moments. The poem opens as a declaration of love and connection to one&#x27;s Creator, stating: &quot;Yedid Nefesh, Av HaRachaman – My Soulmate, Father of Compassion.&quot; This poem was first published in Venice in 1588 in a book titled &quot;Sefer Charedim&quot;. Its composition is commonly attributed to that book&#x27;s publisher, Rabbi Elazar ben Moshe Azikri (1533–1600). However–largely because this poem was missing from the original galleys containing Rabbi Azikri&#x27;s own poems–others posit that it was composed by another of his contemporaries, Rabbi Israel ben Moses Najara and famed kabbalist Rabbi Moses ben Jacob Cordovero being the most commonly offered. Still others assert that this poem, and thereby this term, is far older, dating to the 11th century Rabbi Judah Halevi.

The Hebrew word &quot;Yedid&quot;, meaning close mate or dear friend, is first found in Deuteronomy, chapter 33, verse 12. The Hebrew word &quot;Nefesh&quot;, meaning soul, is first found in Genesis, chapter 2, verse 7. While this poem is known by its opening refrain, Yedid Nefesh/Soulmate, in the 18th-century prayer book of Rabbi Jacob Emden, he records its official title as: &quot;Song of Awakening of the Soul-Toward the Love of Blessed Hashem (the Name)&quot; (translation from his original Hebrew).

In Judaism, &quot;bashert&quot; means destined or intended. This term can refer to any destined incident and is particularly used for one&#x27;s soulmate. According to the Talmud, it is said that forty days before a male child is formed, a voice from heaven announces whose daughter he is going to marry–a match made in heaven. Jewish mysticism speaks of husband and wife as half-souls. It is also said that God takes the soul whose time has come to enter this world and separates it into two halves, placing one half in the male and one half in the female. And when these two halves meet again in matrimony, their original connection and love bond returns. Baal Shem Tov once said, &quot;From every human being there rises a light that reaches straight to heaven, and when two souls that are destined to be together find each other, the streams of light flow together and a single brighter light goes forth from that united being.&quot;

=== Mythology ===

==== Lilith and Eve ====
In Jewish folklore, it is said that Adam had a wife called Lilith created from the ground&#x27;s dust, just as he was. But she remained with him only a short time because she insisted upon enjoying full equality with her husband. She derived her rights from their identical origin.

The woman destined to become the true companion of man, Eve, was taken from Adam&#x27;s body, for only when like is joined unto like the union is indissoluble. The creation of woman from man was possible because Adam originally had two faces, which were separated at the birth of Eve.

==== Cain and Abel ====
It&#x27;s a common belief that before mankind multiplied, each baby boy was born with his soulmate as his twin sister. Cain and Abel&#x27;s soulmates were born with them, and Rachel and Leah were the soulmates of Jacob and Esau, respectively.

==== King Solomon&#x27;s Daughter ====
A lesser-known tale centers on King Solomon, who knows one of his daughters is destined to marry a poor man. To prevent this from happening, he keeps her locked with servants in the tower of a palace deep within a forest. It is said that a bird of prey brought her soulmate to the tower, and they fell in love. The story ends with King Solomon realizing that the young man is a scholar, even though he isn’t rich.

=== Greek Mythology ===
It is said that humans were androgynous. In the Symposium, Plato has Aristophanes present the idea that humans originally had four arms, four legs, and one head made of two faces; Zeus split these creatures in half, leaving each torn creature to search for its missing counterpart. The severed humans were a miserable lot. Aristophanes says, &quot;Each one longed for its other half, and so they would throw their arms about each other, weaving themselves together, wanting to grow together. Love is born into every human being; it calls back the halves of our original nature together; it tries to make one out of two and heal the wound of human nature. Each of us, then, is a ‘matching half’ of a human whole…and each of us is always seeking the half that matches him. When a person meets the half that is his very own, something wonderful happens: the two are struck from their senses by love, by a sense of belonging to one another, and by desire, and they don’t want to be separated from one another, not even for a moment. These are people who finish out their lives together and still cannot say what it is they want from one another.”

=== Hinduism ===
Twin flames are observed in yogic teachings. Humans have seven energy centers, known as chakras, with the lowest being the sex center and the highest being the ‘‘samādhi’’, a state of deep meditation. According to philosopher Osho, two souls are bonded when the seven chakras of a man are in tune and harmony with all seven of a woman, creating a sense of completeness.

The story of a married couple Rāma and Sītā, told in the ancient mythological Indian epic Rāmāyaṇa, depicts the transformative power of love. Demon-king of Lanka, Rāvaṇa, abducts Sītā and keeps her locked within his palace for a year. When Rāma, with the help of his companion Hanumān, locates Sītā, he battles Rāvaṇa to reunite with his wife.

===Theosophy===
According to the esoteric religious movement Theosophy, whose claims were modified by Edgar Cayce, God created androgynous souls—equally male and female. Later theories postulate that the souls split into separate genders, perhaps because they incurred karma while playing around on the Earth, or &quot;separation from God.&quot; Over several reincarnations, each half seeks the other. When all karmic debt is purged, the two will fuse and return to the ultimate.

===New Age===
Mark L. Prophet and Elizabeth Clare Prophet define a soulmate as a separate entity with whom an individual has shared many lifetimes, whether as a friend, lover, co-worker, or partner. Typically, the individual is drawn to this entity to complete a specific mission. They describe a soulmate as one of many potential spiritual brothers or sisters: &quot;Even though there may be a great attraction and bond between soulmates, fundamentally, in the ultimate sense, you could define it more as a brother/sister relationship, even though soulmates have great marriages and a great union of hearts.&quot; According to Mark Prophet: &quot;A soulmate relationship has to do with the seat of the soul Chandra, that Chandra just above the base ... The connection is one of parallel and mutual evolution rather than origin.&quot;

== Soulmates vs Twin Flames ==
Twin Flames and soulmates are often conflated, but they are distinct concepts in spiritual and metaphysical beliefs. A soulmate is generally considered a person with whom one shares a deep and meaningful connection, which can be romantic or platonic, and multiple soulmates may exist throughout a lifetime. Twin Flames, by contrast, are believed to be two expressions of the same soul, created as one unit and designed to be together in a lifelong romantic partnership. This relationship serves a unique spiritual purpose, where both individuals mirror one another’s deepest emotional and spiritual blocks in order to heal and attain harmony. Unlike soulmates, whose relationships may be temporary, Twin Flames are believed to be divinely designed to be together on Earth, but achieving this requires inner healing and the resolution of unconscious barriers to love.

== Practices ==

=== Judaism ===

According to Judaism, all souls destined for the world stand before God in couples. When they arrive in the world, the blessed Holy One matches these couples who are half-souls or twin flames.

==== Prayer ====
It is believed that prayer from the heart helps find the ‘‘bashert’’. Eliezer prayed to God for help in finding a bride for Isaac. In another instance, Leah prayed for another soulmate, or different destiny, upon discovering that her current soulmate, who she was to marry, Esau, was a wicked man. Leah’s prayer was heard, and she married Jacob instead. 

Praying at the tombs of renowned spiritual leaders regularly is also a common prayer practice. Reading the Old Testament book Song of Songs and specific Psalms (31, 32, 70, 72, and 124) for forty days is an ancient practice that has also been used as a method for one to find their ‘‘bashert’’.

==== Working on character traits (Middot) ====
Though Judaism believes in beshert (destined one), destiny is influenced by free choice. If one does not work on their character traits or leads a wicked life, they forfeit their beshert to someone more deserving. It is a common practice to work on one&#x27;s middot.

==== Guarding one&#x27;s eyes (Shmiras Eiynayim) ====
It is a practice amongst Orthodox Jews to avoid looking at things that trigger sexual thoughts or actions. In relation, it is argued that Joseph was deserving of marrying his &quot;bashert&quot; because he did not stare at her or fantasize about her.

==== Charity (Tzedakah) ====
It is encouraged to perform ‘‘tzedakah’’, meaning righteousness or charity work, to find one’s soulmate.

== Criticism ==
Some psychologists state that believing that a soulmate exists specifically for a person is an unrealistic expectation.

Even though Judaism and Hinduism have sources about the existence of soulmates, some leaders think otherwise.

<doc id="889845" wikidata="Q701717" url="?curid=889845" title="Yeon Gaesomun">
<text>Yeon Gaesomun (594–666) was a powerful military dictator in the waning days of the Goguryeo kingdom, which was one of the Three Kingdoms of ancient Korea. He is remembered for his successful resistance against Tang China under Emperor Taizong and his son Emperor Gaozong.

Traditional Korean histories from Joseon painted Yeon Gaesomun as a despotic leader, whose cruel policies and disobedience to his monarch led to the fall of Goguryeo. However, his achievements in defending Goguryeo against Chinese onslaughts have inspired early Korean nationalist historians, most notably the 19th-century Korean historian and intellectual Sin Chaeho, to term Yeon Gaesomun the greatest hero in Korean history. In popular culture Yeon Gaesomun is often remembered as an exceptional soldier-statesman without equal in Korean history.

==Biography==
Yeon Gaesomun was born into the influential and distinguished Yeon family as the first son of Yeon Taejo, &quot;Magniji&quot; (, a position equivalent to a modern era office of prime minister) of Goguryeo during the reigns of King Pyeongwon and King Yeongyang. His grandfather Yeon Ja-yu was also a prime minister.

Information about Yeon Gaesomun comes largely from the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;″s biographical accounts of King Yeongnyu, King Bojang, and Yeon Gaesomun himself, and tomb engravings and biographical accounts, from the New Book of Tang, dedicated to his sons Yeon Namsaeng and Yeon Namsan.

Tang Chinese historical records give Yeon Gaesomun&#x27;s surname as Cheon ( in Chinese, meaning &quot;water spring&quot;), because Yeon ( in Chinese, meaning &quot;riverhead&quot;) was the given name of Emperor Gaozu (), the founding emperor of Tang, and thus subject to the naming taboo by Chinese tradition. Yeon Gaesomun is also sometimes referred to as Gaegeum (). In the Nihon Shoki, he appears as Iri Kasumi (). Since both Yeon Gaesomun and Iri Kasumi are transcriptions intending to approximate the phonetic value of the original pronunciation, his actual name can be reconstructed as &quot;Eol Kasum&quot;.

Very little is known of Yeon Gaesomun&#x27;s early days, until he became the Western Governor (), where he oversaw the building of the Cheolli Jangseong, a network of military garrisons to defend Liaodong from Tang.

Yeon Gaesomun had at least three sons: (eldest to youngest) Yeon Namsaeng, Yeon Namgeon, and Yeon Namsan.

===Overthrow of the throne===
In the winter of 642, King Yeongnyu was apprehensive about Yeon Gaesomun and plotted with his other officials to kill him. When Yeon Gaesomun discovered the plot, he arranged a lavish banquet to celebrate his rise to the position of Eastern Governor () to which one hundred of the opposing politicians of the nation were invited. Yeon Gaesomun ambushed and killed all one hundred politicians present, and then proceeded to the palace and murdered King Yeongnyu. According to traditional Chinese and Korean sources, Yeon Gaesomun&#x27;s men dismembered the king&#x27;s corpse and discarded it without proper ceremony.

After placing King Bojang (),a nephew of King Yeongnyu, on the Goguryeo throne, Yeon Gaesomun appointed himself the &quot;Dae Magniji&quot; (; generalissimo) and assumed absolute de facto control over Goguryeo affairs of state until his death around 666.

Yeon Gaesomun&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état came as the culmination of a lengthy power struggle between those in the government who favored appeasement toward Tang China and those who advocated military confrontation; Yeon Gaesomun belonged to the hard-liners. Traditional Chinese and Korean historians assumed that Yeon Gaseomun&#x27;s motive was simply his thirst for power, but many modern Korean historians assert that his motive was to make Goguryeo assume a tougher stance against Tang China, as opposed to King Yeongnyu who submitted to Tang for a peaceful diplomatic relationship. Yeon Gaesomun&#x27;s role in the murder of King Yeongnyu was taken as the primary pretext for the failed Tang invasion of 645.

===Wars with China===

The series of wars between Goguryeo and Tang China comprise some of the most important events in the ancient history of Northeast Asia, leading to the Tang–Silla alliance, the ultimate demise of powerful Goguryeo, and the unification of the Korean Peninsula under Silla control. Yeon Gaesomun was a central protagonist in this series of conflicts, as well as its primary cause.

At the outset of his rule, Yeon Gaesomun took a brief conciliatory stance toward Tang China. For instance, he supported Taoism at the expense of Buddhism, and to this effect in 643, sent emissaries to the Tang court requesting Taoist sages, eight of whom were brought to Goguryeo. This gesture is considered by some historians as an effort to pacify Tang and buy time to prepare for the Tang invasion Yeon thought inevitable given his ambitions to annex Silla.

Relations with Tang deteriorated when Goguryeo launched new invasions of Silla. In 645, the first conflict of the Goguryeo–Tang War began and Emperor Taizong&#x27;s noted military acumen enabled him to conquer a number of major Goguryeo border fortresses.

Eventually, however, Emperor Taizong&#x27;s invasion was met with two major setbacks. First, his main army was stymied and bogged down for several months at Ansi Fortress due to the resistance of the celebrated commander Yang Manchun. Second, the elite marine force that he sent to take Pyongyang, Goguryeo&#x27;s capital, was defeated by Yeon Gaesomun who, according to the &quot;Joseon Sanggosa&quot;, then immediately marched his legions to relieve Yang Manchun&#x27;s forces at Ansi Fortress.

Emperor Taizong, caught between Yang Manchun&#x27;s army in the front and Yeon Gaesomun&#x27;s counter-attacking forces closing in from behind, as well as suffering from the harsh winter and dangerously low food supplies, was forced to retreat homeward. Before setting off, Emperor Taizong left behind 100 bolts of silk cloth out of respect to Yang Manchun. The retreat was difficult and many of his soldiers died. Emperor Taizong&#x27;s campaign against Goguryeo was unsuccessful. However, he succeeded in inflicting heavy casualties on Goguryeo. Upon returning home, Emperor Taizong founded the Minzhong Temple, the oldest temple in Beijing, to commemorate his soldiers who died in Goguryeo. He invaded Goguryeo again in 647 and 648, but was defeated both times, and thus was unable to accomplish his ambition of conquering Goguryeo in his lifetime.

Conquering Goguryeo had been an obsession with Emperor Taizong, and after his death in 649, his son Emperor Gaozong continued his ambition. After the Tang-Silla alliance conquered Baekje, Emperor Gaozong invaded Goguryeo in 661 and 662. One of Yeon Gaesomun&#x27;s greatest victories came in 662, when his forces defeated Tang general Pang Xiaotai () and his Lingnan army at the Sasu River (, probably Botong River). Pang Xiaotai and all his 13 sons were killed in combat. Famed Tang general Su Dingfang, who was instrumental in conquering Baekje, was unable to overcome Pyongyang&#x27;s defenses and was forced to withdraw due to harsh snowstorms. With increasing domestic turmoil in China, Tang was once again forced to retreat.

However, Goguryeo&#x27;s population and economy were severely damaged due to the long years of continuous warfare. Yeon Gaesomun died in 666 of a natural cause, and Goguryeo was thrown into chaos and further weakened by a succession struggle among his sons and younger brother, with his eldest son defecting to Tang and his younger brother defecting to Silla. Tang mounted a fresh invasion in 667, aided by Silla and the defector Yeon Namsaeng, and was finally able to conquer Goguryeo in 668.

===Death===
The most likely date of Yeon Gaesomun&#x27;s death is that recorded on the tomb stele of his eldest son Yeon Namsaeng on the twenty-fourth year of the reign of King Bojang (665). However, the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; records the year as 666, and the Nihon Shoki gives the year as the twenty-third year of the reign of King Bojang (664).

==Legends==
According to a local Chinese legend in the 19th-century Funing County Annals (): during a campaign, Emperor Taizong was scouting ahead of his army and was almost captured when he discovered Yeon Gaesomun&#x27;s encampment and was recognized by the latter, but narrowly escaped by hiding in a decrepit well; later, Emperor Taizong had a pagoda () erected near the location.

==Historical depictions==
Tang and Silla sources portrayed Yeon Gaesomun as a brutal and arrogant dictator who carried five swords at a time, and had men prostrate themselves so that he could use their backs to mount and dismount his horse.

==In popular culture==
Yeon Gaesomun sometimes appears as a door god in Taoist temples in partnership with the Tang general Xue Rengui. In some Chinese legends, Xue Rengui and Yeon Gaesomun are the reincarnations of the White Tiger&#x27;s Star and Azure Dragon&#x27;s Star, respectively.

===Literature===
Yeon Gaesomun (under the name &quot;Gai Suwen&quot;) appears in Peking opera as the archvillain of the famed Tang general Xue Rengui, who rescues Emperor Taizong from Yeon Gaesomun&#x27;s pursuit.

Yeon Gaesomun appears in numerous classical Chinese literature about Xue Rengui, who rescues Emperor Taizong from certain death at the hands of Yeon Gaesomun himself.

Age of Empires: World Domination, a mobile game produced in collaboration with series owner Microsoft, includes Yeon Gaesomun as a selectable hero of the Korean civilization.

<doc id="889856" wikidata="Q2164304" url="?curid=889856" title="Superheated steam">
<text>Superheated steam is steam at a temperature higher than its vaporization point at the absolute pressure where the temperature is measured.

Superheated steam can therefore cool (lose internal energy) by some amount, resulting in a lowering of its temperature without changing state (i.e., condensing) from a gas to a mixture of saturated vapor and liquid. If unsaturated steam (a mixture which contains both water vapor and liquid water droplets) is heated at constant pressure, its temperature will also remain constant as the vapor quality (think dryness, or percent saturated vapor) increases towards 100%, and becomes dry (i.e., no saturated liquid) saturated steam. Continued heat input will then &quot;super&quot; heat the dry saturated steam. This will occur if saturated steam contacts a surface with a higher temperature.

Superheated steam and liquid water cannot coexist under thermodynamic equilibrium, as any additional heat simply evaporates more water and the steam will become saturated steam. However, this restriction may be violated temporarily in dynamic (non-equilibrium) situations. To produce superheated steam in a power plant or for processes (such as drying paper) the saturated steam drawn from a boiler is passed through a separate heating device (a superheater) which transfers additional heat to the steam by contact or by radiation.

Superheated steam is not suitable for sterilization. This is because the superheated steam is dry. Dry steam must reach much higher temperatures and the materials exposed for a longer time period to have the same effectiveness; or equal F0 kill value. Superheated steam is also not useful for heating; while it has more energy and can do more work than saturated steam, its heat content is much less useful. This is because superheated steam has the same heat transfer coefficient of air, making it an insulator - a poor conductor of heat. Saturated steam has a much higher wall heat transfer coefficient.

Slightly superheated steam may be used for antimicrobial disinfection of biofilms on hard surfaces.

Superheated steam&#x27;s greatest value lies in its tremendous internal energy that can be used for kinetic reaction through mechanical expansion against turbine blades and reciprocating pistons, that produces rotary motion of a shaft. The value of superheated steam in these applications is its ability to release tremendous quantities of internal energy yet remain above the condensation temperature of water vapor; at the pressures at which reaction turbines and reciprocating piston engines operate.

Of prime importance in these applications is the fact that water vapor containing entrained liquid droplets is generally incompressible at those pressures. In a reciprocating engine or turbine, if steam doing work cools to a temperature at which liquid droplets form, then the water droplets entrained in the fluid flow will strike the mechanical parts with enough force to bend, crack or fracture them. Superheating and pressure reduction through expansion ensures that the steam flow remains as a compressible gas throughout its passage through a turbine or an engine, preventing damage of the internal moving parts.

== Saturated steam ==
Saturated steam is steam that is in equilibrium with heated water at the same pressure, i.e., it has not been heated above the boiling point for its pressure. This is in contrast to superheated steam, in which the steam (vapor) has been separated from the water droplets then additional heat has been added.

These condensation droplets are a cause of damage to steam turbine blades, the reason why such turbines rely on a supply of dry, superheated steam.

Dry steam is saturated steam that has been very slightly superheated. This is not sufficient to change its energy appreciably, but is a sufficient rise in temperature to avoid condensation problems, given the average loss in temperature across the steam supply circuit. Towards the end of the 19th century, when superheating was still a less-than-certain technology, such steam-drying gave the condensation-avoiding benefits of superheating without requiring the sophisticated boiler or lubrication techniques of full superheating.

By contrast, water vapor that includes water droplets is described as wet steam. If wet steam is heated further, the droplets evaporate, and at a high enough temperature (which depends on the pressure) all of the water evaporates, the system is in vapor–liquid equilibrium, and it becomes &quot;saturated steam&quot;.

Saturated steam is advantageous in heat transfer due to the high latent heat of vaporization. It is a very efficient mode of heat transfer. In layman&#x27;s terms, saturated steam is at its dew point at the corresponding temperature and pressure. The typical latent heat of vaporization (or condensation) is for saturated steam at atmospheric pressure.

==Uses==

===Steam engine===
Superheated steam was widely used in main line steam locomotives. Saturated steam has three main disadvantages in a steam engine: it contains small droplets of water which have to be periodically drained from the cylinders; being precisely at the boiling point of water for the boiler pressure in use, it inevitably condenses to some extent in the steam pipes and cylinders outside the boiler, causing a disproportionate loss of steam volume as it does so; and it places a heavy demand on the boiler.

Superheating the steam dries it effectively, raises its temperature to a point where condensation is much less likely and increases its volume significantly. Added together, these factors increase the power and economy of the locomotive. The main disadvantages are the added complexity and cost of the superheater tubing and the adverse effect that the &quot;dry&quot; steam has on lubrication of moving components such as the steam valves. Shunting locomotives did not generally use superheating.

The normal arrangement involved taking steam after the regulator valve and passing it through long superheater tubes inside specially large firetubes of the boiler. The superheater tubes had a reverse (&quot;torpedo&quot;) bend at the firebox end so that the steam had to pass the length of the boiler at least twice, picking up heat as it did so.

===Processing===
Other potential uses of superheated steam include: drying, cleaning, layering, reaction engineering, epoxy drying and film use where saturated to highly superheated steam is required at one atmospheric pressure or at high pressure. Ideal for steam drying, steam oxidation and chemical processing. Uses are in surface technologies, cleaning technologies, steam drying, catalysis, chemical reaction processing, surface drying technologies, curing technologies, energy systems and nanotechnologies. 

The application of superheated steam for sanitation of dry food processing plant environment has been reported.

Superheated steam is not usually used in a heat exchanger due to low heat transfer co-efficient. In refining and hydrocarbon industries superheated steam is mainly used for stripping and cleaning purposes.

===Pest control===
Steam has been used for soil steaming since the 1890s. Steam is induced into the soil which causes almost all organic material to deteriorate (the term &quot;sterilization&quot; is used, but it is not strictly correct since all micro-organism are not necessarily killed). Soil steaming is an effective alternative to many chemicals in agriculture, and is used widely by greenhouse growers. Wet steam is primarily used in this process, but if soil temperatures above the boiling point of water are required, superheated steam must be used.

<text>D-A-D (formerly stylized as D:A:D) is a Danish rock band. They were originally named Disneyland After Dark, but changed their name to avoid a lawsuit from The Walt Disney Company.

== History ==
In the early 1980s in Copenhagen, D-A-D started playing together under their original name &quot;Disneyland After Dark&quot;. Pedersen came up with the name based on the idea that when the lights are out in Disneyland, anything can happen. The first lineup of D-A-D consisted of Jesper, Stig, Peter and Stig&#x27;s girlfriend, Lene Glumer. The band&#x27;s debut concert was at the youth club Sundby Algaard. In December 1982, Lene Glumer left the band and the three of them kept playing together and on 3 March 1984, Jesper&#x27;s younger brother, Jacob, joined the band at a concert at Musikcaféen in Copenhagen.

The band released their first album, &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; in 1986.

The group made their international breakthrough in 1989 with the record &quot;No Fuel Left for the Pilgrims&quot; on Warner Records, which was released on the band&#x27;s fifth birthday. They achieved some airplay with the single &quot;Sleeping My Day Away&quot;.

The current lineup is Jesper Binzer, Jacob Binzer, Stig Pedersen and Laust Sonne.

The largest concert the band played as the opening act for the Böhse Onkelz on their farewell festival on 17 June 2005, about 120,000 people on the Euro Speedway Lausitz.

== Band members ==

<text>This is a list of prime ministers of Mali since the country gained independence from France in 1960 to the present day. The prime minister heads the Council of Ministers.

A total of seventeen people have served as Prime Minister of Mali (not counting five acting prime ministers). Additionally, one person, Modibo Keita, served on two non-consecutive occasions.

The current Interim Prime Minister of Mali is Abdoulaye Maïga, since 21 November 2024. He was appointed by the National Committee for the Salvation of the People, which has governed the country since the 2021 Malian coup d&#x27;état.

The 2023 constitutional referendum brought a new constitution into force on July 22, 2023, which reduced the powers of the prime minister significantly. The prime minister and government are now responsible to the president rather than parliament, and the president heads and directs the policy of the government.

<text>Middle Persian, also known by its endonym Pārsīk or Pārsīg (Inscriptional Pahlavi script: , Manichaean script: , Avestan script: ) in its later form, is a Western Middle Iranian language which became the literary language of the Sasanian Empire. For some time after the Sasanian collapse, Middle Persian continued to function as a prestige language. It descended from Old Persian, the language of the Achaemenid Empire and is the linguistic ancestor of Modern Persian, the official language of Iran (also known as Persia), Afghanistan (Dari) and Tajikistan (Tajik).

==Name==

&quot;Middle Iranian&quot; is the name given to the middle stage of development of the numerous Iranian languages and dialects. The middle stage of the Iranian languages begins around 450 BCE and ends around 650 CE. One of those Middle Iranian languages is Middle Persian, i.e. the middle stage of the language of the Persians, an Iranian people of Persia proper, which lies in the south-western Iran highlands on the border with Babylonia. The Persians called their language &quot;Parsig&quot;, meaning &quot;Persian&quot;.

Another Middle Iranian language was Parthian, i.e. the language of the northwestern Iranian peoples of Parthia proper, which lies along the southern/south-eastern edge of the Caspian sea and is adjacent to the boundary between western and eastern Iranian languages. The Parthians called their language &quot;Parthawig&quot;, meaning &quot;Parthian&quot;. Via regular sound changes &quot;Parthawig&quot; became &quot;Pahlawig&quot;, from which the word &#x27;Pahlavi&#x27; eventually evolved. The &quot;-ig&quot; in &quot;parsig&quot; and &quot;parthawig&quot; was a regular Middle Iranian suffix for &quot;pertaining to&quot;. The New Persian equivalent of &quot;-ig&quot; is &quot;-i&quot;.

When the Arsacids (who were Parthians) came to power in the 3rd-century BCE, they inherited the use of written Greek (from the successors of Alexander the Great) as the language of government. Under the cultural influence of the Greeks (Hellenization), some Middle Iranian languages, such as Bactrian, also had begun to be written in Greek script. But yet other Middle Iranian languages began to be written in a script derived from Aramaic. This occurred primarily because &quot;written&quot; Aramaic had previously been the written language of government of the former Achaemenids, and the government scribes had carried that practice all over the empire. This practice had led to others adopting Imperial Aramaic as the language of communications, both between Iranians and non-Iranians. The transition from Imperial Aramaic to Middle Iranian took place very slowly, with a slow increase of more and more Iranian words so that Aramaic with Iranian elements gradually changed into Iranian with Aramaic elements. Under Arsacid hegemony, this Aramaic-derived writing system for Iranian languages came to be associated with the Parthians in particular (it may have originated in the Parthian chancellories), and thus the writing system came to be called &quot;pahlavi&quot; &quot;Parthian&quot; too.

Aside from Parthian, Aramaic-derived writing was adopted for at least four other Middle Iranian languages, one of which was Middle Persian. In the 3rd-century CE, the Parthian Arsacids were overthrown by the Sassanids, who were natives of the south-west and thus spoke Middle Persian as their native language. Under Sassanid hegemony, the Middle Persian language became a prestige dialect and thus also came to be used by non-Persian Iranians. In the 7th-century, the Sassanids were overthrown by the Arabs. Under Arab influence, Iranian languages began to be written in Arabic script (adapted to Iranian phonology), while Middle Persian began to rapidly evolve into New Persian and the name &quot;parsik&quot; became Arabicized &quot;farsi&quot;. Not all Iranians were comfortable with these Arabic-influenced developments, in particular, members of the literate elite, which in Sassanid times consisted primarily of Zoroastrian priests. Those former elites vigorously rejected what they perceived as &#x27;Un-Iranian&#x27;, and continued to use the &quot;old&quot; language (i.e. Middle Persian) and Aramaic-derived writing system. In time, the name of the writing system, &quot;pahlavi&quot; &quot;Parthian&quot;, began to be applied to the &quot;old&quot; Middle Persian language as well, thus distinguishing it from the &quot;new&quot; language, &quot;farsi&quot;. Consequently, &#x27;pahlavi&#x27; came to denote the particularly Zoroastrian, exclusively written, late form of Middle Persian. Since almost all surviving Middle Persian literature is in this particular late form of exclusively written Zoroastrian Middle Persian, in popular imagination the term &#x27;Pahlavi&#x27; became synonymous with Middle Persian itself.

The ISO 639 language code for Middle Persian is &quot;pal&quot;, which reflects the post-Sasanian era use of the term Pahlavi to refer to the language and not only the script.

== History ==

=== Transition from Old Persian ===
In the classification of the Iranian languages, the Middle Period includes those languages which were common in Iran from the fall of the Achaemenid Empire in the fourth century BCE up to the fall of the Sasanian Empire in the seventh century CE.

The most important and distinct development in the structure of Iranian languages of this period is the transformation from the synthetic form of the Old Period (Old Persian and Avestan) to an analytic form:
* nouns, pronouns, and adjectives lost almost all of their case inflections 
* prepositions were used to indicate the different roles of words.
* many tenses began to be formed from a composite form
* the language developed a split ergative morphosyntactic alignment

=== Transition to New Persian ===
The modern-day descendants of Middle Persian are New Persian and Luri. The changes between late Middle and Early New Persian were very gradual, and in the 10th–11th centuries, Middle Persian texts were still intelligible to speakers of Early New Persian. However, there are definite differences that had taken place already by the 10th century:

* sound changes, such as
**the dropping of unstressed initial vowels
**the epenthesis of vowels in initial consonant clusters
**the loss of -g when word final
**change of initial w- to either b- or gw- → g-
* changes in the verbal system, notably the loss of distinctive subjunctive and optative forms, and the increasing use of verbal prefixes to express verbal moods
* a transition from split ergative back to consistent nominative-accusative morphosyntactic alignment
* changes in the vocabulary, particularly the establishment of a superstratum or adstratum of Arabic loanwords replacing many Aramaic loans and native terms.
* the substitution of the Pahlavi script for the Arabic script

==Surviving literature==
Texts in Middle Persian are found in remnants of Sasanian inscriptions and Egyptian papyri, coins and seals, fragments of Manichaean writings, and Zoroastrian literature, most of which was written down after the Sasanian era. The language of Zoroastrian literature (and of the Sasanian inscriptions) is sometimes referred to as Pahlavi – a name that originally referred to the Pahlavi scripts, which were also the preferred writing system for several other Middle Iranian languages. &quot;Pahlavi Middle Persian&quot; is the language of quite a large body of literature which details the traditions and prescriptions of Zoroastrianism, which was the state religion of Sasanian Iran (224 to c. 650) before the Muslim conquest of Persia. The earliest texts in Zoroastrian Middle Persian were probably written down in late Sasanian times (6th–7th centuries), although they represent the codification of earlier oral tradition. However, most texts date from the ninth to the 11th century, when Middle Persian had long ceased to be a spoken language, so they reflect the state of affairs in living Middle Persian only indirectly. The surviving manuscripts are usually 14th-century copies. Other, less abundantly attested varieties are &quot;Manichaean Middle Persian&quot;, used for a sizable amount of Manichaean religious writings, including many theological texts, homilies and hymns (3rd–9th, possibly 13th century), and the Middle Persian of the Church of the East, evidenced in the Pahlavi Psalter (7th century); these were used until the beginning of the second millennium in many places in Central Asia, including Turpan and even localities in South India. All three differ minimally from one another and indeed the less ambiguous and archaizing scripts of the latter two have helped to elucidate some aspects of the Sasanian-era pronunciation of the former.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===

The vowels of Middle Persian were the following:

It has been doubted whether the Middle Persian short mid vowels and were phonemic, since they do not appear to have a unique continuation in later forms of Persian and no minimal pairs have been found. The evidence for them is variation between spelling with and without the matres lectionis &quot;y&quot; and &quot;w&quot;, as well as etymological considerations. They are thought to have arisen from earlier in certain conditions, including, for , the presence of a following , sibilant or front vowel in the next syllable, and for , the presence of a following labial consonant or the vowel in the next syllable. Long and had appeared first in Middle Persian, since they had developed from the Old Persian diphthongs and .

===Consonants===

The consonant phonemes were the following:

A major distinction between the pronunciation of the early Middle Persian of the Arsacid period (until the 3rd century CE) and the Middle Persian of the Sassanid period (3rd – 7th century CE) is due to a process of consonant lenition after voiced sounds that took place during the transition between the two. Its effects were as follows:

1. Voiced stops, when occurring after vowels, became semivowels: 
: &gt; , &gt; , &gt; or (the latter after )

This process may have taken place very early, but it is nevertheless often the old pronunciation or a transitional one that is reflected in the Pahlavi spelling.

:Old Persian &quot;naiba-&quot; &gt; Middle Persian &quot;nēw&quot; (Pahlavi &quot;TB&quot; or &quot;nyw&#x27;&quot;), but:
:Old Persian &quot;asabāra-&quot; &gt; Middle Persian &quot;asvār&quot; &#x27;horseman&#x27; (Pahlavi &quot;PLŠYA&quot;, &quot;ʾswblʾ&quot;).
:Proto-Iranian *&quot;pād-&quot; &gt; Middle Persian &quot;pāy&quot; &#x27;foot&#x27; (Pahlavi &quot;LGLE&quot;, &quot;pʾd&quot;, Manichaean &quot;pʾy&quot;).
:Old Persian &quot;magu-&quot; &gt; Middle Persian &quot;mow-&quot; &#x27;Magian&#x27; (Pahlavi &quot;mgw&quot;-).
:Proto-Iranian *&quot;ni-gauš-&quot; &gt; Middle Persian &quot;niyōš-&quot; &#x27;listen&#x27; (Pahlavi &quot;nydwhš-&quot;, also &quot;nydwk(h)š-&quot;), Manichaean &quot;nywš&quot;).

2. Voiceless stops and affricates, when occurring after vowels as well as other voiced sounds, became voiced: 

This process is thought not to have been taken place before Sassanid Pahlavi, and it generally is not reflected in Pahlavi spelling.

A further stage in this lenition process is expressed in a synchronic alternation: at least at some stage in late Middle Persian (later than the 3rd century), the consonants , , appear to have had, after vowels, the fricative allophones , , . This is slightly more controversial for , since there appears to have been a separate phoneme as well. A parallel development seems to have affected in the same position, possibly earlier; not only was it weakened to a fricative , but it was also depalatalised to . In fact, old Persian and in any position also produced . Unlike the case with the spirantisation of stops, this change is uncontroversially recognised for Sassanid times.

The lenition of voiceless stops and affricates remained largely unexpressed in Pahlavi spelling, which continues to reflect the Arsacid sound values, but is known from the more phonetic Manichaean spelling of texts from Sassanid times.

:Arsacid &quot;šap&quot; &gt; Sassanid &quot;šab&quot; (late ) &#x27;night&#x27; (Pahlavi &quot;LYLYA&quot;, &quot;šp&#x27;&quot;; Manichaean &quot;šb&quot;)

:Arsacid &quot;pit&quot; &gt; Sassanid &quot;pid&quot; (late ) &#x27;father&#x27; (Pahlavi &quot;AB&quot;, &quot;p(y)t&#x27;&quot;, Manichaean &quot;pyd&quot;)

:Arsacid &quot;pārak&quot; &gt; Sassanid &quot;pārag&quot; (late ) &#x27;gift&#x27; (Pahlavi &quot;pʾlk&#x27;&quot;)

:Arsacid &quot;hač&quot; &gt; Sassanid &quot;az&quot; &#x27;from&#x27; (Pahlavi &quot;MN&quot;, &quot;hc&quot;, Manichaean &quot;ʾc&quot; or &quot;ʾz&quot;)

As a result of these changes, the voiceless stops and affricates , , , rarely occurred after vowels – mostly when geminated, which has protected them from the lenition (e.g. &quot;waččag&quot;, sp. &quot;wck&#x27;&quot; &#x27;child&#x27;), and due to some other sound changes.

Another difference between Arsacid and Sassanid-era pronunciation is that Arsacid word-initial produced Sassanid (another change that is not reflected in the Pahlavi spelling). The sound probably passed through the phase , which may have continued until very late Middle Persian, since Manichaean texts did not identify Indic with it and introduced a separate sign for the former instead of using the letter for their native sound. Nonetheless, word-initial was retained/reintroduced in learned borrowings from Avestan.

:Arsacid &quot;yām&quot; &gt; Sassanid &quot;ǰām&quot; &#x27;glass&#x27; (Pahlavi &quot;yʾm&quot;, Manichaean &quot;jʾm&quot;); but:
:Avestan &quot;yazata&quot; &gt; Middle Persian &quot;yazd&quot; &#x27;god&#x27; (Pahlavi &quot;yzdt&#x27;&quot;)

Furthermore, some forms of Middle Persian appear to have preserved &quot;ǰ&quot; (from Proto-Iranian or ) after &quot;n&quot; due to Parthian influence, instead of the usual weakening to &quot;z&quot;. This pronunciation is reflected in Book Pahlavi, but not in Manichaean texts:

:Proto-Iranian *&quot;panča&quot; &gt; &quot;panǰ&quot; (spelt &quot;pnc&quot; in Book Pahlavi) or &quot;panz&quot; (spelt &quot;pnz&quot; in Manichaean)

Judging from the spelling, the consonant may have been pronounced before in certain borrowings from Parthian in Arsacid times (unlike native words, which had for earlier &quot;*θ&quot; in general and for the cluster &quot;*θr&quot; in particular), but it had been replaced by by the Sassanid period:

:Arsacid &quot;miθr&quot; &gt; Sassanid &quot;mihr&quot; &#x27;Mithra, contract&#x27; (Pahlavi &quot;mtr&#x27;&quot;, Manichaean &quot;myhr&quot;).

The phoneme (as opposed to the late allophone of ) is rare and occurs almost only in learned borrowings from Avestan and Parthian, e.g. &quot;moγ&quot; (Pahlavi &quot;mgw&quot; or &quot;mwg&quot; &#x27;Magian&#x27;), &quot;maγ&quot; (Pahlavi &quot;mγ&quot;) &#x27;hole, pit&#x27;.

The sound may also have functioned as a marginal phoneme in borrowings as well.

The phoneme was still relatively rare as well, especially so in Manichaean texts, mostly resulting from Proto-Iranian *rd, *rz and, more rarely, *r. It also occurred in the combination , which was a reflex of Old Persian and (cf. the words &#x27;Pahlavi&#x27; and &#x27;Parthian&#x27;).

The sound may be viewed as a phoneme or merely as a combination of and .
Usually , and are considered to have been velar; a less common view is that and were uvular instead.

Finally, it may be pointed out that most scholars consider the phoneme as being still a labial approximant, but a few regard it as a voiced labial fricative .

The initial clusters of and a stop (, , ) had acquired a prosthetic vowel by the time of the Manichaean Middle Persian texts: &quot;istāyišn&quot; (&quot;ՙst՚yšn&quot;) &#x27;praise&#x27; vs Pahlavi &quot;stāyišn&quot; (&quot;ՙst՚dšn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;praise&#x27;.

===Prosody===

Stress was on the last syllable. That was due to the fact that any Old Persian post-stress syllables had been apocopated:

: Old Persian &quot;pati&quot; &#x27;at&#x27; &gt; Middle Persian &quot;pad&quot;
: Old Persian &quot;martiya-&quot; &#x27;man&#x27; &gt; Middle Persian &quot;mard&quot;
: Old Persian &quot;martiyā́nām&quot; &#x27;man&#x27; (genitive-dative plural) &gt; Middle Persian &quot;mardān&quot;

It has been suggested that words such as &quot;anīy&quot; &#x27;other&#x27; (Pahlavi spelling &quot;AHRN&quot;, &quot;AHRNyd&quot;, Manichaean &quot;՚ny&quot;) and &quot;mahīy&quot; &#x27;bigger&#x27; (Manichaean &quot;mhy&quot;) may have been exceptionally stressed on the first syllable, since the last one was apocopated already in the course of the Middle Persian period: the later forms are &quot;an&quot; (Manichaean &quot;՚n&quot;), and &quot;meh&quot; (Pahlavi &quot;ms&quot; and Manichaean &quot;myh&quot;); indeed, some scholars have reconstructed them as monosyllabic &quot;any&quot;, &quot;mahy&quot; even for Middle Persian.

==Scripts==


Middle Persian has been written in a number of different scripts. The corpora in different scripts also exhibit other linguistic differences that are partly due to their different ages, dialects and scribal traditions.

The Pahlavi scripts are abjads derived from the imperial variety of the Aramaic alphabet used in the chancelleries of the Achaemenid Empire. As is typical of abjads, they express primarily the consonants in a word form. What sets them apart from other abjads, however, is the use of Heterograms, and more specifically Aramaeograms, i.e. words written in Aramaic (sometimes, in later periods, with distortions) but pronounced in Middle Persian: e.g. &quot;LY&quot; (Aramaic &#x27;to me&#x27;) for &quot;man&quot; &#x27;me, I&#x27;. There were about a thousand of these in the Book Pahlavi variety. In addition, their spelling remained very conservative, expressing the pronunciation of the Arsacid period. The two most important subvarieties are:

# Inscriptional Pahlavi, used in the inscriptions of Sassanid kings and officials from the 3rd–4th centuries CE. The 22 letters are written separately and still relatively well distinguished compared to later versions: the only formal coincidences of original Aramaic signs are the pair &quot;m&quot; and &quot;q&quot; and the triplet &quot;w&quot;, &quot;ʿ&quot; and &quot;r&quot;.
# Book Pahlavi, used primarily in Zoroastrian books from the 5th century CE on. Most texts are thought to reflect the stage of the language from the 6th to the 10th centuries CE. (6th–7th centuries for the translations of the Avesta and perhaps some didactic and entertainment literature, 9–10th centuries for the dogmatic and legal texts that form most of the corpus) This is the script that the overwhelming majority of Middle Persian texts is recorded in. It is a cursive script characterised by many ligatures and by the formal coincidence of originally different Aramaic letters, reducing the number to just 14 distinct signs. Now, also &quot;n&quot; coincides with the triplet &quot;w&quot; = &quot;ʿ&quot; = &quot;r&quot;, and in addition, another triplet &quot;g&quot;, &quot;d&quot; and &quot;y&quot; merges too, as does the pair &quot;ʾ&quot; and &quot;ḥ&quot;. Aramaic &quot;ṭ&quot; had also disappeared. In later times, some mergers were disambiguated by means of diacritic signs, following the example of the Arabic abjad: thus, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;d&quot; and &quot;y&quot; were distinguished again; however, this wasn&#x27;t applied consistently.

Other known Pahlavi varieties are the early Pahlavi found in inscriptions on coins issued in the province of Pars from the 2nd century BC to the 3rd century CE; the relatively conservative Psalter Pahlavi (6th–8th centuries CE), used in a Christian Psalter fragment, which still retains all the letter distinctions that Inscriptional Pahlavi had except the one between &quot;t&quot; and &quot;ṭ&quot;; and the Pahlavi found in papyri from the early 7th century CE, which displays even more letter coincidences than Book Pahlavi.

The Manichaean script was an abjad introduced for the writing of Middle Persian by the prophet Mani (216–274 CE), who based it on his native variety of the Aramaic script of Palmyrene origin. Mani used this script to write the known book &quot;Šābuhrāgān&quot; and it continued to be used by Manichaeans until the 9th century to write in Middle Persian, and in various other Iranian languages for even longer. Specifically the Middle Persian Manichaean texts are numerous and thought to reflect mostly the period from the 3rd to the 7th centuries CE. In contrast to the Pahlavi scripts, it is a regular and unambiguous phonetic script that expresses clearly the pronunciation of 3rd century Middle Persian and distinguishes clearly between different letters and sounds, so it provides valuable evidence to modern linguists. Not only did it not display any of the Pahlavi coalescences mentioned above, it also had special letters that enabled it to distinguish and (although it didn&#x27;t always do so), as well as and , unique designations for , , and , and consistent distinctions between the pairs – and – .

Since knowledge of Pahlavi decreased after the Muslim conquest of Iran, the Zoroastrians occasionally transcribed their religious texts into other, more accessible or unambiguous scripts. One approach was to use the Avestan alphabet, a practice known as Pazand; another was to resort to the same Perso-Arabic script that was already being used for New Persian, and that was referred to as Pārsī. Since these methods were used at a relatively late linguistic stage, these transcriptions often reflect a very late pronunciation close to New Persian.

In general, Inscriptional Pahlavi texts have the most archaic linguistic features, Manichaean texts and the Psalter exhibit slightly later, but still relatively early language stages, and while the Pahlavi translations of the Avesta also retain some old features, most other Zoroastrian Book Pahlavi texts (which form the overwhelming majority of the Middle Persian corpus as a whole) are linguistically more innovative.

==Transliteration and transcription==

===Transliteration of Pahlavi script===

In view of the many ambiguities of the Pahlavi script, even its transliteration does not usually limit itself to rendering merely the letters as written; rather, letters are usually transliterated in accordance with their origin regardless of the coinciding forms: thus, even though Book Pahlavi has the same letter shapes for original &quot;n&quot;, &quot;w&quot; and &quot;r&quot;, for original &quot;ʾ&quot; and &quot;ḥ&quot; and for original &quot;d&quot;, &quot;g&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, besides having some ligatures that coincide in shape with certain individual letters, these are all transliterated differently. For instance, the spelling of &quot;gōspand&quot; &#x27;domestic animal&#x27; is transliterated &quot;gwspnd&quot; in spite of the fact that the &quot;w&quot; and &quot;n&quot; have the same graphic appearance.

Furthermore, letters used as part of Aramaic heterograms and not intended to be interpreted phonetically are written in capitals: thus the heterogram for the word &quot;ān&quot; is rendered &quot;ZK&quot;, whereas its phonetic spelling is transliterated as &quot;ʾn&#x27;&quot; (the final vertical line reflects the so-called &#x27;otiose&#x27; stroke, see below). Finally, there is a convention of representing &#x27;distorted/corrupt&#x27; letters, which &#x27;should&#x27; have appeared in a different shape from a historical point of view, by under- or overlining them: e.g. the heterogram for &quot;andar&quot; &#x27;in&#x27; is transliterated &quot;BYN&quot;, since it corresponds to Aramaic &quot;byn&quot;, but the sign that &#x27;should&#x27; have been &quot;b&quot; actually looks like a &quot;g&quot;.

Within Arameograms, scholars have traditionally used the standard Semitological designations of the Aramaic (and generally Semitic) letters, and these include a large number of diacritics and special signs expressing the different Semitic phonemes, which were not distinguished in Middle Persian. In order to reduce the need for these, a different system was introduced by D. N. MacKenzie, which dispenses with diacritics as much as possible, often replacing them with vowel letters: &quot;A&quot; for &quot;ʾ&quot;, &quot;O&quot; for &quot;ʿ&quot;, &quot;E&quot; for &quot;H&quot;, &quot;H&quot; for &quot;Ḥ&quot;, &quot;C&quot; for &quot;Ṣ&quot;, for example &quot;ORHYA&quot; for &quot;ʿRḤYʾ&quot; (&quot;bay&quot; &#x27;god, majesty, lord&#x27;). For &quot;ṭ&quot;, which still occurs in heterograms in Inscriptional Pahlavi, Θ may be used. Within Iranian words, however, both systems use &quot;c&quot; for original Aramaic &quot;ṣ&quot; and &quot;h&quot; for original Aramaic &quot;ḥ&quot;, in accordance with their Iranian pronunciation (see below). The letter &quot;l&quot;, when modified with a special horizontal stroke that shows that the pronunciation is /l/ and not /r/, is rendered in the MacKenzie system as &quot;ɫ&quot;. The traditional system continues to be used by many, especially European scholars. The MacKenzie system is the one used in this article.

===Transliteration of Manichaean script===

As for Pahlavi, &quot;c&quot; is used for the transliteration of original Aramaic &quot;ṣ&quot; and &quot;h&quot; for the transliteration of original &quot;ḥ&quot;. Original Aramaic &quot;h&quot;, on the other hand, is sometimes rendered as &quot;ẖ&quot;. For original &quot;ṭ&quot;, the sign &quot;ṯ&quot; is used. The special Manichaean letters for , , , and are transcribed in accordance with their pronunciation as &quot;x&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, &quot;γ&quot; and &quot;δ&quot;.
Unlike Pahlavi, the Manichaean script uses the letter Ayin also in Iranian words (see below) and it is transliterated in the usual Semitological way as &quot;ՙ&quot;.

===Transcription===

Since, like most abjads, even the Manichaean script and a maximally disambiguated transliterated form of Pahlavi do not provide exhaustive information about the phonemic structure of Middle Persian words, a system of transcription is also necessary. There are two traditions of transcription of Pahlavi Middle Persian texts: one closer to the spelling and reflecting the Arsacid-era pronunciation, as used by Ch. Bartholomae and H. S. Nyberg (1964) and a currently more popular one reflecting the Sassanid-era pronunciation, as used by C. Saleman, W. B. Henning and, in a somewhat revised form, by D. N. MacKenzie (1986).

The less obvious features of the usual transcription are:

# long vowels are marked with a macron: &quot;ā&quot;, &quot;ē&quot;, &quot;ī&quot;, &quot;ō&quot;, &quot;ū&quot; for , , , , .
# The semivowels are marked as follows: &quot;w&quot; for and &quot;y&quot; for .
# The palatal obstruents are marked with carons as follows: &quot;š&quot; for , &quot;č&quot; for , &quot;ǰ&quot; for and &quot;ž&quot; for .
# The voiceless velar fricative is marked as &quot;x&quot;, its labialised counterpart is &quot;xw&quot;, and the (phonemic) voiced velar fricative is &quot;γ&quot;.

==Spelling==

A common feature of Pahlavi as well as Manichaean spelling was that the Aramaic letters &quot;ṣ&quot; and &quot;ḥ&quot; were adapted to express the sounds and , respectively. In addition, both could use the letter &quot;p&quot; to express , and &quot;ṣ&quot; to express &quot;z&quot; after a vowel.

===Pahlavi===

====Arameograms====

The widespread use of Aramaeograms in Pahlavi, often existing in parallel with &#x27;phonetic&#x27; spellings, has already been mentioned: thus, the same word &quot;hašt&quot; &#x27;eight&#x27; can be spelt &quot;hšt&quot; or &quot;TWMNYA&quot;. A curious feature of the system is that simple word stems sometimes have spellings derived from Aramaic inflected forms: the spellings of verb stems include Aramaic inflectional affixes such as &quot;-WN&quot;, &quot;-TWN&quot; or &quot;-N&quot; and &quot;Y-&quot;; the spellings of pronouns are often derived from Aramaic prepositional phrases (&quot;tо̄&quot; &#x27;you&#x27; is &quot;LK&quot;, originally Aramaic &quot;lk&quot; &#x27;to you&#x27;, &quot;о̄y&quot; &#x27;he&#x27; is &quot;OLE&quot;, originally Aramaic &quot;ʿlh&quot; &#x27;onto him&#x27;); and inalienable nouns are often noun phrases with pronominal modifiers (&quot;pidar&quot; &#x27;father&#x27; is &quot;ABYtl&quot;, originally Aramaic &quot;ʾby&quot; &#x27;my father&#x27;, &quot;pāy&quot; &#x27;foot&#x27; is &quot;LGLE&quot;, originally Aramaic &quot;rglh&quot; &#x27;his foot&#x27;). Furthermore, the Aramaic distinctions between &quot;ḥ&quot; and &quot;h&quot; and between &quot;k&quot; and &quot;q&quot; were not always maintained, with the first often replacing the second, and the one between &quot;t&quot; and &quot;ṭ&quot; was lost in all but Inscriptional Pahlavi: thus &quot;YKTLWN&quot; (pronounced &quot;о̄zadan&quot;) for Aramaic &quot;yqṭlwn&quot; &#x27;kill&#x27;, and &quot;YHWWN&quot; (pronounced &quot;būdan&quot;) for Aramaic &quot;yhwwn&quot; &#x27;be&#x27;, even though Aramaic &quot;h&quot; is elsewhere rendered &quot;E&quot;. In the rest of this article, the Pahlavi spellings will be indicated due to their unpredictability, and the Aramaeograms will be given priority over the &#x27;phonetic&#x27; alternatives for the same reason.

If a word expressed by an Arameogram has a grammatical ending or, in many cases, a word-formation suffix, these are generally expressed by phonetic elements: &quot;LYLYAʾn for &quot;šabʾn &#x27;nights&#x27;. However, verbs in Inscriptional Pahlavi are sometimes written as &#x27;bare ideograms&#x27;, whose interpretation is a major difficulty for scholars.

====Historical and ambiguous spelling====

It has also been pointed out that the Pahlavi spelling does not express the 3rd century lenitions, so the letters &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;k&quot; and &quot;c&quot; express , , and after vowels, e.g. &quot;šp&#x27;&quot; for &quot;šab&quot; &#x27;night&#x27; and &quot;hc&quot; for &quot;az&quot; &#x27;from&#x27;. The rare phoneme was also expressed by the same letter shape as &quot;k&quot; (however, this sound value is usually expressed in the transliteration). Similarly, the letter &quot;d&quot; may stand for after a vowel, e.g. &quot;pʾd&quot; for &quot;pāy&quot; &#x27;foot&#x27; – this is no longer apparent in Book Pahlavi due to the coincidence of the shapes of the original letters &quot;y&quot;, &quot;d&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, but is already clearly seen in Inscriptional and Psalter Pahlavi. Indeed, it even appears to have been the general rule word-finally, regardless of the word&#x27;s origins, although modern transliterations of words like &quot;xwadāy&quot; (&quot;xwtʾd&quot;) and &quot;mēnōy&quot; (&quot;mynwd&quot;) do not always reflect this analogical / pseudo-historical spelling. Final &quot;īy&quot; was regularly written &quot;yd&quot;. In the same way, &quot;(w)b&quot; may also correspond to a &quot;w&quot; in the pronunciation after a vowel. The fortition of initial to (or ) is not reflected either, so &quot;y&quot; can express initial , e.g. &quot;yʾm&quot; for &quot;ǰām&quot; &#x27;glass&#x27; (while it still expresses in the learned word &quot;yzdt&#x27;&quot; for &quot;yazd&quot; &#x27;god&#x27;).

Some even earlier sound changes are not consistently reflected either, such as the transition of to in some words (in front of this reflex is due to Parthian influence, since the Middle Persian reflex should have been ). In such words, the spelling may have &quot;s&quot; or, in front of &quot;r&quot; – &quot;t&quot;. For example, &quot;gāh&quot; &#x27;place, time&#x27; is spelt &quot;gʾs&quot; (cf. Old Persian &quot;gāθu&quot;) and &quot;nigāh&quot; &#x27;(a) look&#x27; is spelt &quot;nkʾs&quot;; &quot;šahr&quot; &#x27;country, town&#x27; is spelt &quot;štr&#x27;&quot; (cf. Avestan &quot;xsaθra&quot;) and &quot;mihr&quot; &#x27;Mithra, contract, friendship&#x27; is spelt &quot;mtr&#x27;&quot;. In contrast, the Manichaean spellings are &quot;gʾh&quot;, &quot;ngʾh&quot;, &quot;šhr&quot;, &quot;myhr&quot;. Some other words with earlier are spelt phonetically in Pahlavi, too: e.g. &quot;gēhān&quot;, spelt &quot;gyhʾn&quot; &#x27;material world&#x27;, and &quot;čihr&quot;, spelt &quot;cyhl&quot; &#x27;face&#x27;. There are also some other cases where is spelt after &quot;p&quot;: &quot;ptkʾl&quot; for &quot;pahikār&quot; &#x27;strife&#x27;, and may also stand for in that position: &quot;ptwnd&quot; for &quot;paywand&quot; &#x27;connection&#x27;.

There are some other phoneme pairs besides and that are not distinguished: &quot;h&quot; (the original Aramaic &quot;ḥ&quot;) may stand either for or for (&quot;hm&quot; for &quot;ham&quot; &#x27;also&#x27; as well as &quot;hl&quot; for &quot;xar&quot; &#x27;donkey&#x27;), whereas the use of original Aramaic &quot;h&quot; is restricted to heterograms (transliterated &quot;E&quot; in MacKenzie&#x27;s system, e.g. &quot;LGLE&quot; for pāy &#x27;foot&#x27;). Not only , but also the frequent sound is expressed by the letter &quot;p&quot;, e.g. &quot;plhw&#x27;&quot; for &quot;farrox&quot; &#x27;fortunate&#x27;. While the original letter &quot;r&quot; is retained in some words as an expression of the sound , especially in older frequent words and Aramaeograms (e.g. &quot;štr&#x27;&quot; for &quot;šahr&quot; &#x27;country, town&#x27;, &quot;BRTE&quot; for &quot;duxt&quot; &#x27;daughter&#x27;), it is far more common for the letter &quot;l&quot; to have that function, as in the example &quot;plhw&#x27;&quot; for &quot;farrox&quot;. In the relatively rare cases where &quot;l&quot; does express , it can be marked as &quot;ɫ&quot;.

====Expression of vowels====

Like many abjads, the system may express not only consonants, but also some vowels by means of certain consonant signs, the so-called matres lectionis. This is usually limited to long vowels: thus, original &quot;ʾ&quot; can stand for the vowel (e.g. in &quot;pʾd&quot; for &quot;pād&quot;), &quot;y&quot; can stand for and (e.g.&quot;pym&quot; for &quot;pīm&quot; &#x27;pain&#x27; and &quot;nym&quot; for &quot;nēm&quot; &#x27;half&#x27;), and &quot;w&quot; can stand for or (&quot;swt&#x27;&quot; for &quot;sūd&quot; &#x27;profit&#x27; and &quot;swl&quot; for &quot;sōr&quot; &#x27;salty&#x27;). However, short is also typically expressed like long (e.g. &quot;swd&quot; for &quot;suy&quot; &#x27;hunger&#x27;), whereas short and the assumed and vary between being expressed like their long counterparts or remaining unexpressed: &quot;p(y)t&quot; for &quot;pid&quot; &#x27;father&#x27;, &quot;sl(y)šk&quot; for &quot;srešk&quot; &#x27;tear&#x27;, &quot;nhwm&quot; for &quot;nohom&quot; &#x27;ninth&#x27;. Due to elision of , written &quot;yw&quot; can also correspond to : &quot;nywk&#x27;&quot; &#x27;good&#x27;. Gemination of &quot;consonants&quot; was not expressed, e.g. &quot;waččag&quot;, sp. &quot;wck&#x27;&quot; &#x27;child&#x27;).

In Inscriptional and Psalter Pahlavi, a &quot;-y&quot; that was not pronounced appears word-finally, e.g. &quot;šhpwhry&quot; for &quot;Šahpuhr&quot;. Its origin and function are disputed. In Book Pahlavi, it developed into a peculiar convention, the so-called &#x27;otiose&#x27; stroke, which resembles &quot;w&quot;/&quot;n&quot;/&quot;r&quot; and is added to demarcate the end of the word after those letters that never connect to the left: &quot;mān&#x27;&quot; &#x27;house&#x27;.

Like many abjads, Pahlavi &quot;ʾ&quot; can express simply the fact that a word begins in a vowel, e.g. &quot;ʾp̄ʾyt&#x27;&quot; for &quot;abāyēd&quot; &#x27;it is necessary&#x27; (though two alephs usually aren&#x27;t written in a row to express an initial long vowel).

===Manichaean===

In contrast to the historical and ideographic features of Pahlavi, Manichaean spelling is relatively straightforward. Like Pahlavi, the Manichaean script designates vowel-initial words with &quot;ʾ&quot;, but a further spelling convention in it is that it is the letter &quot;ՙ&quot;, rather than &quot;ʾ&quot;, that is written before initial front vowels, e.g. &quot;ՙym&quot; for &quot;im&quot; &#x27;this&#x27; (in contrast to Pahlavi &quot;ʾm&quot; (or &quot;LZNE&quot;). Vowels are marked by matres lectionis in the Manichaean script in the usual way, and long vowels are more likely to be marked.

In spite of the availability of signs for each sound, Manichaean spelling did not always make perfectly phonetic use of them. In particular, not only in Pahlavi but even in Manichaean, the letter &quot;p&quot; was often used to express , and after vowels was written etymologically as &quot;c&quot;: thus, &quot;frāz&quot; &#x27;forth&#x27; was spelt &quot;prʾc&quot;, just as in Pahlavi. If the voiced fricatives really occurred as allopohones of , , in Middle Persian, the special Manichaean signs for fricatives &quot;β&quot;, &quot;γ&quot; and &quot;δ&quot; usually were not used to express this either. Conversely, the Semitic letters for the consonants &quot;q&quot;, &quot;ṭ&quot; and &quot;h&quot; (transliterated &quot;ẖ&quot; in Manichaean) were retained and used, occasionally, even though they only expressed the same Middle Persian sounds as &quot;k&quot; and &quot;t&quot;, and &quot;ḥ&quot; (transliterated &quot;h&quot; in Manichaean). The Manichaean script also has abbreviation marking double dots for the forms &quot;ʾwd&quot; &#x27;and&#x27;, &quot;ʾw-š&quot; &#x27;and he&#x27; and &quot;ʾw-šʾn&quot; &#x27;and they&#x27;, which may be transcribed as &quot;ẅ&quot;, &quot;š̈&quot; and &quot;š̈ʾn&quot;. Elisions and plural may also be marked with double dots.

==Grammar==

The elision of unstressed word-final syllables during the transition from Old to Middle Persian has eliminated many grammatical endings. As a result, compared to the synthetic grammar of Old Persian, Middle Persian belongs to a much more analytic language type, with relatively little inflection and widespread expression of grammatical meanings through syntactic means instead (specifically, use of prepositions and periphrases).

=== Nominal morphology ===

====Case and number inflection====

Early Middle Persian inflection as found in the Sassanid rock inscriptions (3rd–4th centuries CE) still retained a minimal case system for the nominal parts of speech, i.e. nouns, adjectives, pronouns and numerals. It included a direct or subject case (originating from the old nominative) used for the subject and the predicative nominal and an oblique case used for other functions (indirect object, genitive possessor, complement of a preposition, subject/&#x27;agent&#x27; of the ergative construction). The case distinction was only present in the plural of nouns, in nouns of relationship (family terms) that end in &quot;-tar&quot; or &quot;-dar&quot; in the oblique, and in the first person singular pronoun &quot;az&quot;/&quot;an&quot; (&quot;ANE&quot;). The attested system is shown in the table below, using the words &quot;mard&quot; (&quot;GBRA&quot;) &#x27;man&#x27; and &quot;pid&quot; (&quot;AB&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;father&#x27; as examples.
The endings &quot;-īn&quot; and &quot;-ūn&quot; occur in the place of &quot;-ān&quot; in a decreasing number of exceptions. In Inscriptional Pahlavi, forms such as &quot;frazendīn (&quot;przndyn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;of the children&#x27; and &quot;dušmenūn (&quot;dwšm(y)nwn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;of the enemies&#x27; are still found. In Manichaean Middle Persian, likewise, forms such as &quot;zanīn (spelt &quot;znyn&quot;), &#x27;women&#x27;, &quot;ruwānīn &#x27;souls&#x27; and &quot;dušmenūn (&quot;dwšmynwn&quot;) are preserved. It also has the form &quot;awīn as an equivalent of &quot;awēšān &#x27;they, those&#x27;. In Book Pahlavi, the generalisation of &quot;-ān&quot; has advanced to the point where only &quot;-īn&quot; is preserved, namely in the inflections of the words &quot;harw&quot; (&quot;KRA&quot;) and &quot;harwisp&quot; (&quot;hlwsp̄&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;every, all&#x27; – plural &quot;harwīn and &quot;harwisp-īn or &quot;harwistīn, respectively, as well as optionally of &quot;dō&quot; (&quot;2&quot;, &quot;TLYN&#x27;&quot;), &#x27;two&#x27; – plural &quot;dōwīn or &quot;dōnīn.

There is some disagreement and uncertainty about whether the case of the &quot;direct&quot; object in this early inflectional system was direct or oblique. Originally, it should have been direct in the ergative-absolutive constructions, but possibly oblique in the nominative-accusative ones. It has been claimed that &#x27;the direct object could stand in both cases&#x27; or that it is unclear which case specifically the &quot;plural&quot; direct object took, with a suggested distinction between indefinite and definite direct object taking the direct and the oblique cases, respectively.

For an even more archaic stage, some have claimed that the singular of regular nominals had its own oblique case form, too, and that it was marked by the ending &quot;-ē&quot; (spelt &quot;-y&quot;), which still occurs on nouns in Inscriptional and Psalter Pahlavi, albeit somewhat unsystematically. This would have been expected, assuming that both oblique forms continue the Old Iranian genitives in &quot;*-ahya&quot; and &quot;*-ānam&quot;, respectively. However, this theory has been disputed and rejected by many scholars.

The case system broke down in the course of the Middle Persian period, as the oblique case forms were gradually generalised and displaced the direct ones. First, the oblique plural form in &quot;-ān&quot; (&quot;-īn&quot; and &quot;-ūn&quot;) was generalised as a general plural form; a few instances of this usage are found as early as in the 6th–8th century Pahlavi Psalter, and while the preserved parts of the 3rd century &quot;Shābuhragān&quot; may retain it, most other Manichaean texts use &quot;-ān&quot; as a general plural form and only retain the case distinction in the family terms and the 1st singular pronoun. Finally, even though the Middle Persian translations of the Avesta still retain the old system, most clearly so in the family terms, the other Book Pahlavi Zoroastrian texts display the new system with no case distinctions at all and solely a contrast between singular and plural. At this stage, the old direct and oblique cases of the nouns of relationship such as &quot;pid&quot; and &quot;pidar&quot; were preserved only as free variants. At the same time, even when morphologically unexpressed, the &#x27;underlying&#x27; case of a nominal phrase remains relevant throughout the Middle Persian period for the agreement on the verb and the use of the pronominal enclitics, to be described in the relevant sections.

In addition to the plural ending &quot;-ān&quot;, a new plural suffix &quot;-īhā&quot; is increasingly common both in later Manichaean texts, where also the variant &quot;-īhān&quot; occurs, and especially in Book Pahlavi. It is used with inanimate nouns and has been said to express &#x27;individual plurality&#x27;: &#x27;the various, individual Xs&#x27;. At the same time, &quot;-ān&quot; is still used with inanimate as well as with animate nouns, and is far more common than &quot;-īhā&quot;. Some examples are &quot;šahr-īhā (&quot;štryhʾ&quot;) &#x27;countries&#x27; and &quot;dar-īhā (&quot;BBAyhʾ&quot;) &#x27;doors&#x27;, but also &quot;čiš-ān&quot; (&quot;MNDOMʾn&quot;) &#x27;things&#x27;. The resulting late Middle Persian system looks as follows, as exemplified with the words &quot;mard&quot; &#x27;man&#x27; and &quot;kо̄f&quot; &#x27;mountain&#x27;:
As long as case declension was still preserved, a possessor noun stood in the oblique case. In this older construction, it &quot;preceded&quot; the possessed noun. After the breakdown of the case system, what remained of this construction was a simple juxtaposition between a possessor noun and a possessed noun, and that was indeed preserved as one possible expression of possession: e.g. &quot;dūdag sālār&quot; (&quot;dwtk&#x27; srdʾl&quot;) &#x27;the head of a family&#x27;, &#x27;the family(&#x27;s) head&#x27;, &quot;Ōhrmazd nām&quot; (&quot;ʾwhrmzd ŠM&quot;) &#x27;the name of Ahuramazda&#x27;. However, there was also a more explicit option using the relative particle &quot;ī&quot;, which introduced a &quot;following&quot; possessor nominal phrase (also in the oblique case, as long as the distinction existed): e.g. &quot;sālār ī dūdag&quot; (&quot;srdʾl Y dwtk&#x27;&quot;), &quot;nām ī Ōhrmazd&quot; (&quot;ŠM y ʾwhrmzd&quot;). This is discussed in more detail in the section on the relative particle.

====Definiteness====

Indefiniteness may be expressed by the encliticisation of the word &quot;ē(w)&quot; (spelt &#x27;1&#x27; or &quot;HD&quot;) &#x27;one&#x27; to a noun: &quot;mard-ēw&quot; (&quot;GBRA-1&quot;) &#x27;a (certain) man&#x27;. This usage has been described by certain scholars as an &#x27;indefinite article&#x27;, while others do not regard it as such, since its use is far less common than that of the English word &quot;a(n)&quot;.

====Adjectives====

=====Agreement=====

Originally, adjectives had the same inflectional categories as nouns and took the same endings. When used independently as nouns, they still have number inflection: &quot;weh-ān&quot; (&quot;ŠPYLʾn&quot;) &#x27;the good (people)&#x27;. When they are used as attributive modifers of nouns, however, agreement is optional and, while it remains common in Manichaean Middle Persian, it is increasingly rare in Book Pahlavi, where, e.g. both &quot;abārīgān gyāgān&quot; (&quot;ʾp̄ʾrykʾn gywʾkʾn&quot; ) &#x27;other places&#x27; and &quot;abārīg dēwān&quot; (&quot;ʾp̄ʾryk&#x27; ŠDYAʾn&quot;) &#x27;other demons&#x27; have been attested. When the modifying adjective is introduced by the relative particle &quot;ī&quot;, as well as in predicative position, it never takes the plural suffix: e.g. &quot;mardān ī weh&quot; (&quot;GBRAʾn Y ŠPYL&quot;) &#x27;good men&#x27;.
Some sources also assert that the original singular oblique case ending &quot;-ē&quot; (&quot;-y&quot;) is seen in attributive preposed adjectives in some examples: e.g. &quot;čē-š asar karb az asarē rо̄šnīh frāz brēhēnīd&quot; (&quot;MEš ʾsl klp MN ʾsly lwšnyh prʾc blyhynyt&quot;) &#x27;for he created the eternal form from eternal light&#x27;.

=====Comparison=====

Comparison of adjectives (as well as adverbs) is regularly expressed with the comparative degree suffix &quot;-tar&quot; (spelt &quot;-tl&quot;) and the superlative degree suffix &quot;-tom&quot; (spelt &quot;-twm&quot;), or possibly &quot;-tum&quot;; in Manichaean, they also have the allomorphs &quot;-dar&quot; and &quot;-dom&quot; after voiced consonants. For example, &quot;abēzag&quot; (&quot;ʾp̄yck&#x27;) &#x27;pure&#x27; &quot;is compared &quot;abēzag-tar&quot; &#x27;purer&quot;&#x27; – &quot;abēzag-&quot;tom&quot; &#x27;purest&#x27;&quot;. &quot;

There are also some irregular or relict forms reflecting more ancient suffixes (comparative &quot;-y&quot; or &quot;-īy&quot; or resulting fronting of the preceding vowel, superlative &quot;-ist&quot;) and/or suppletion:

In some cases, only a &#x27;superlative&#x27; form exists without corresponding positive and comparative forms: &quot;bālist&quot; (&quot;bʾlyst&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;supreme, highermost&#x27;, &quot;nidom&quot; (&quot;nytwm&quot;) &#x27;lowermost&#x27;, &quot;bēdom&quot; (&quot;bytwm&quot;) &quot;outermost&quot;, &quot;fradom&quot; (&quot;AWLA&quot;) &#x27;first&#x27;, &quot;abdom&quot; (&quot;ʾp̄dwm&quot;) &#x27;last&#x27;.

The object of comparison for an adjective in the comparative degree is introduced by the preposition &quot;az&quot; (&quot;hc&quot;) &#x27;from&#x27;, the subordinating conjunction &quot;kū&quot; (&quot;AYK&quot;) &#x27;where, that&#x27; or, more rarely, &quot;čiyо̄n&quot; (&quot;cygwn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;as&#x27;: &quot;о̄y az/kū/čiyо̄n tо̄ о̄zо̄mandtar&quot; (&quot;OLE MN/AYK/cygwn&#x27; LK ʾwcʾmndtl&quot;) &#x27;he is stronger than you.&#x27;
The object of comparison for an adjective in the superlative degree is introduced by the preposition &quot;az&quot; (&quot;hc&quot;) or simply by a possessive construction: &quot;о̄y (az) mardʾn о̄zо̄mandtom&quot; (sp. &quot;OLE (MN) GBRAʾn ʾwcʾmndtwm&quot;) &quot;&quot;&#x27;he is the strongest of the men&#x27;.

=====Placement=====

When adjectives modify a noun without the help of any linking particle, they usually precede them, but may occasionally follow them, too. A far more common possibility than either is for the adjective to be introduced by the relative particle &quot;ī&quot;, on which see the relevant section. Thus, e.g. &#x27;a/the big house&#x27; can be expressed as &quot;wazurg mān&quot; (&quot;LBA mʾn&#x27;), mān wazurg&quot; (&quot;mʾn&#x27; LBA&quot;) or &quot;mān ī wazurg&quot; (&quot;mʾn&#x27; Y LBA&quot;).

====Pronouns====

=====Personal pronouns=====

The personal pronouns have a stressed form and an enclitic form. They are as follows:

The enclitic allomorphs with initial (&quot;-im&quot;, etc.) are used after consonants. The vowel or can also appear instead of , albeit rarely (&quot;-um&quot;, &quot;-om&quot;). The spelling variant &quot;LY&quot; of &quot;man&quot; is used before the particle &quot;-iz&quot; (&quot;c&quot;) &#x27;too&#x27;: &quot;man-iz&quot; is spelt &quot;LYc&quot;.

======Case forms and syntactic function======

Of the personal pronouns proper, only the first stressed form has an attested case distinction, but the use of the direct case is already archaic in Book Pahlavi, where the form &quot;man&quot; (&quot;L&quot;) is generalised. The pronunciation of the direct case form is controversial – Manichaean has only &quot;an&quot; (&quot;ʾn&quot;), whereas the form &quot;az&quot; has been said to be due to influence from Parthian and its existence has been questioned. In addition, the third person pronoun is originally a demonstrative pronoun and is declined like a noun, so originally the form with the plural suffix &quot;-ān&quot; – and, presumably, the Manichaean one in &quot;-īn&quot; – appeared only in the oblique case; however, again, the oblique was generalised in Manichaean and Book Pahlavi. Apart from that, the stressed forms can have all the same syntactic functions as a noun: subject (&quot;man wēnēm&quot;, sp. &quot;L HZYTWNym&quot;, &#x27;I see&#x27;), object (&quot;man wēnēd&quot;, sp. &quot;L HZYTWNyt&#x27;&quot;, &#x27;he sees me&#x27;), complement of a preposition (&quot;о̄ man&quot;, sp. &quot;OL L&quot;, &#x27;to me&#x27;), and a modifier expressing a possessor. As with nouns, the last option is possible in two ways. The first one, which is significantly rarer, is for the pronoun to be placed before another noun. Much more frequently, it is postposed and linked to the head noun with the relative particle &quot;ī&quot;. Thus, &#x27;my house&#x27; can be expressed as &quot;man mān&quot; (&quot;L mʾn&#x27;&quot;), but more commonly as &quot;mān ī man&quot; (&quot;mʾn&#x27; Y L&quot;).

In contrast, the enclitic forms can only have oblique functions: i.e., they cannot correspond to the (non-ergative) subject of the sentence, although a few such cases have been attested in late texts, possibly due to New Persian influence. They can, however, express:

# an indirect object, e.g. &quot;u-š guft Ohrmazd ...&quot; (&quot;APš gwpt&#x27;/YMRRWNt&#x27; ʾwhrmzd&quot;), &#x27;and Ohrmazd told him... &#x27;;
# a possessor, e.g. &quot;ka-t čašm о̄ zrēh о̄ftēd&quot; (&quot;AMTt AYNE OL zlyh ʾwptyt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;when your eye (i.e. glance) falls on the sea&#x27;; &quot;u-m mād Spandarmad&quot; (&quot;APm AM spndrmt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;and my mother is Spenta Armaiti&#x27;
# the complement of a preposition, e.g. &quot;čē-š andar&quot; (&quot;MEš BYN&quot;) &#x27;which is in it &#x27;
# the agent in an ergative construction, e.g. &quot;xwamn ī-m dīd&quot; (&quot;hwmn&#x27; ZYm HZYTWN&quot;) &#x27;the dream which I saw&#x27;,
# a direct object in a non-ergative construction, e.g. &quot;u-š о̄zan!&quot; (&quot;APš YKTLWN&quot;) &#x27;and kill it!&#x27;

======Placement of the enclitic pronouns======

The enclitic form is usually attached to a word in the beginning of the clause, typically to the first one, and that is often a conjunction or a particle: specifically it occurs frequently after the conjunctions &quot;ud&quot; &#x27;and&#x27; (which appears before these enclitics as the allomorph &quot;u-&quot; and is spelt &quot;AP&quot;), &quot;ka&quot; (&quot;AMT&quot;) &#x27;when&#x27;, &quot;kū&quot; (&quot;AYK&quot;) &#x27;that, so that&#x27;, &quot;čē&quot; (&quot;ME&quot;) &#x27;because&#x27;, after the relative particle &quot;ī&quot; (then spelt &quot;ZY-&quot;), the relative pronoun &quot;kē&quot; (&quot;MNW&quot;) &#x27;who, which&#x27; and the particle &quot;ā-&quot; (&quot;ʾ&quot;) &#x27;then&#x27;. Two enclitics can occur after each other, in which case the 1st person enclitic comes first, and in the absence of such, the enclitic denoting the agent has priority: e.g. &quot;ān owо̄n-im-iš wahišt nimūd&quot; (&quot;ZK ʾwgwnmš whšt&#x27; nmwt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;in that manner he showed me paradise.&#x27;

When the pronoun is logically the complement of a preposition, it is usually nevertheless &quot;not&quot; attached to it. Still, such examples do occur occasionally and tend then to be written phonetically instead of the usual spelling of the preposition with an Aramaeogram, e.g. &quot;az-iš&quot; &#x27;from her&#x27;, spelt &quot;hcš&quot; rather than &quot;MNš&quot; as usually, and &quot;о̄-mān&quot; &#x27;to us&#x27;, spelt &quot;ʾwmʾn&#x27;&quot; instead of &quot;OLmʾn&quot;. More commonly, however, the enclitic is attached to the first word of the clause, so that the preposition that governs it ends up being placed after it, as in the already adduced example &quot;čē-š andar&quot; &#x27;which is in it&#x27;. The exception are the prepositions &quot;pad&quot; (&quot;PWN&quot;) &#x27;at&#x27;, &quot;о̄&quot; (&quot;OL&quot;) &#x27;to&#x27; and &quot;az&quot; (&quot;MN&quot;) &#x27;from&#x27;, which do accept the 3rd person enclitic &quot;-(i)š&quot;, using it both with a singular and with a plural reference, and &quot;о̄&quot; then appears as the allomorph &quot;aw&quot; before &quot;-iš&quot;: &quot;padiš&quot; (&quot;ptš&quot;), &quot;awiš&quot; (&quot;ʾwbš&quot;), &quot;aziš&quot; (&quot;hcš&quot;). However, if the logical complement is of a non-3rd person, the appropriate enclitic (&quot;-(i)m&quot;, etc.) is attached to the first word in the clause rather than the preposition, and it is &#x27;resumed&#x27; on the preposition itself by the &quot;3rd&quot; person enclitic: e.g. &quot;u-m awiš&quot; (&quot;APm ʾwbm&quot; &#x27;on me&#x27;). A relative pronoun can be &#x27;resumed&#x27; like this, too: &quot;kē ... padiš&quot; &#x27;on ... which&#x27;, and even a noun can, sometimes: &quot;Zardušt ... padiš&quot; &#x27;for... Zarathustra&#x27;.

=====Reflexive pronouns=====

There are two reflexive pronouns – a nominal one &quot;xwad&quot; (&quot;BNPŠE&quot;) &#x27;oneself&#x27; and an adjectival one &quot;xwēš&quot; (&quot;NPŠE&quot;) &#x27;one&#x27;s own&#x27; (earlier &quot;xwēbaš&quot;, hence Manichaean &quot;xw(b)š&quot;.

=====Demonstrative pronouns=====

The demonstrative pronouns can be used with singular and plural referents, with the exception of &quot;о̄y&quot;. They are the following:

# &quot;ēn&quot; (&quot;ZNE&quot;) &#x27;this&#x27;, used deictically as well as preparatively, with a meaning &#x27;the following&#x27;;
# &quot;(h)ān&quot; (&quot;ZK&quot;, Manichaean &quot;hʾn&quot;) &#x27;that&#x27;, with a plural &quot;ānēšān&quot; found only in Manichaean, used anaphorically and in a determinative function to indicate a noun followed by a relative clause;
# &quot;о̄y&quot; (&quot;OLE&quot;) &#x27;that&#x27; with a plural &quot;awēšān&quot; (&quot;OLEšʾn&#x27;&quot;), also used as a 3rd person pronoun;

Some rarer ones are:

# &quot;ēd&quot; (&quot;HNA&quot;) &#x27;this&#x27;, used deictically, but rare;
# &quot;im&quot; (&quot;LZNE&quot;) &#x27;this&#x27; with a plural &quot;imēšān&quot; and &quot;imīn&quot; used in Manichaean, occurring in Book Pahlavi mostly in set phrases such as &quot;im cim rāy&quot; (&quot;LZNE cym lʾd&quot;) &#x27;for this reason&#x27;, &quot;im rо̄z&quot; (&quot;LZNE YWM&quot;) &#x27;today&#x27;).

Some other demonstrative pronouns are &quot;ham&quot; (&quot;hm&quot;) &#x27;the same&#x27; and &quot;and&quot; (&quot;ʾnd&quot;) &#x27;so much&#x27;. Demonstrative adverbs are &quot;ēdо̄n&quot; (&quot;ʾytwn&#x27;&quot;), &quot;о̄wо̄n&quot; (&quot;ʾwgwn&#x27;&quot;) and &quot;о̄h&quot; (&quot;KN&quot;), all three of which mean &#x27;so, thus&#x27;; &quot;ēdar&quot; &#x27;here&#x27; (&quot;LTME&quot;); &quot;awar&quot; &#x27;hither&#x27; (&quot;LPNME&quot;), which is also used as an imperative &#x27;come here!&#x27; and has a plural form &quot;awarēd&quot; (&quot;LPNMEyt&#x27;&quot;), &quot;ōrōn&quot; (&quot;ʾwlwn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;hither&#x27;; &quot;ānо̄h&quot; (&quot;TME&quot;) &#x27;there&#x27;; &quot;nūn&quot; (&quot;KON&quot;) &#x27;now&#x27;; &quot;ēg&quot; (&quot;ADYN&quot;) &#x27;then, thereupon&#x27;; &quot;ā-&quot; (&quot;ʾ&quot;) &#x27;then&#x27; (normally used with a following enclitic pronoun); &quot;hād&quot; (&quot;HWEt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;now, then&#x27;; &quot;pas&quot; (&quot;AHL&quot;) &#x27;afterwards&#x27;; &quot;pēš&quot; &quot;LOYN&#x27;&quot; &#x27;before that, earlier&#x27;.

=====Interrogative pronouns=====

The interrogative pronouns can normally also be used as relative pronouns and introduce dependent clauses, and as well as indefinite pronouns. The main ones are &quot;kē&quot; (&quot;MNW&quot;) &#x27;who&#x27;, &quot;čē&quot; (&quot;ME&quot;) &#x27;what&#x27;, &#x27;what kind of&#x27;, &#x27;which&#x27;, &quot;kadām&quot; (&quot;ktʾm&quot;) &#x27;what kind of, which&#x27;, &quot;kadār&quot; (&quot;ktʾl&quot;) &#x27;which&#x27; and &quot;čand&quot; (&quot;cnd&quot;) &#x27;how much/many&#x27;. The first two and the last one are also used as relative pronouns, i.e. they introduce dependent clauses and mean &#x27;which&#x27;. In that use, they can not be preceded by prepositions, so they are instead resumed in the dependent clause by the 3rd person singular enclitic or a demonstrative pronoun: &#x27;from which&#x27; can be expressed by &quot;kē ... aziš&quot; and &#x27;with which&#x27; can be &quot;kē&#x27; ... abāg&quot;. Interrogative adverbs are &quot;čiyо̄n?&quot; (&quot;cygwn&quot;) &#x27;how&#x27;, &quot;kū?&quot; (&quot;AYK&quot;) &#x27;where&#x27; and &quot;kay?&quot; (&quot;AYMT&quot;) &#x27;when&#x27;. The first two can also introduce dependent clauses as relative pronominal adverbs, meaning &#x27;as&#x27; and &#x27;that&#x27;, respectively. The relative adverb corresponding to &quot;kay?&quot; (&quot;AYMT&quot;) is, however, &quot;ka&quot; (&quot;AYT&quot;) &#x27;when&#x27;.

=====Indefinite pronouns=====

The specialised indefinite pronouns are:

# &quot;ēč&quot; or &quot;hēč&quot; (&quot;ʾyc&quot;) &#x27;any&#x27; (attributive).
# &quot;kas&quot; (&quot;AYŠ&quot;) &#x27;anybody&#x27;. It is also used as a noun: &#x27;a person&#x27;.
# &quot;tis&quot; (a southwestern form) or &quot;čis&quot; (a northwestern form) (sp. &quot;MNDOM&quot;) &#x27;something&#x27;. It is also used as a noun: &#x27;a thing&#x27;.

As already mentioned, the interrogative word &quot;čand&quot; (&quot;cnd&quot;) can also be used as an indefinite one: &#x27;any number/amount&#x27;, whereas &quot;ē(w)-čand&quot; (&quot;ʾy(w)cnd&quot;) is unambiguously indefinite: &#x27;some (number/amount), a few&#x27;. An indefinite adverb is &quot;hagriz&quot; (&quot;hklc&quot;) &#x27;ever&#x27;.
The indefinite meaning can be reinforced by the particle &quot;-iz&quot;, sp. &quot;-(y)c&quot;, meaning &#x27;too&#x27;. Thus &quot;kas-iz&quot; &#x27;whoever&#x27;, etc. The form of &quot;čē&quot; in this case is extended to &quot;čēgām-iz&quot; &#x27;whatever&#x27;.

Together with a negative particle &quot;nē&quot; &#x27;not&#x27; occurring in the same clause, the indefinite pronouns also function as negative ones: &#x27;not ... anybody&#x27; &gt; &#x27;nobody&#x27; etc.: e.g. &quot;kas nē bawēd&quot; (&quot;AYŠ LA YHWWNyt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;there will be nobody.&#x27;

=====Alternative pronouns=====

Pronouns are &quot;anīy&quot; (&quot;AHRN&quot;) &#x27;other&#x27; and &quot;abārīg&quot; (&quot;ʾp̄ʾlyk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;other, further&#x27;; a corresponding pronominal adverb is &quot;enyā&quot; (&quot;ʾynyʾ&quot;) &#x27;otherwise&#x27;.

=====Universal pronouns=====

There are many pronouns with universal meaning, including &quot;har(w)&quot; (&quot;KRA&quot;, &quot;hl&quot;, Manichaean &quot;hrw&quot;) &#x27;every&#x27; (pl. &quot;harwīn&quot;) ; &quot;ham&quot; (&quot;hm&quot;) &#x27;altogether, all, whole&#x27;, &quot;hamāg&quot; (&quot;hmʾk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;whole, entire, all&#x27;, &quot;hāmōyēn&quot; (&quot;hʾmwdyn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;all, the whole&#x27;, &quot;wisp&quot; (&quot;wsp&quot;) &#x27;all, each, every&#x27;, &quot;harwisp&quot; &quot;hlwsp̄&quot; (pl. &quot;harwispīn&quot;) or &quot;harwist&quot; &#x27;all, each, every&#x27;. A pronominal adverb with universal meaning is &quot;hamē(w)&quot; (Book Pahlavi &quot;hmʾy&quot;, Manichaean &quot;hmyw&quot;) &#x27;always&#x27;.

====The relative particle====

Within a nominal phrase, many different kinds of modifiers following the head were introduced by so-called relative particle &quot;ī&quot; (spelt &quot;ZY-&quot; in Inscriptional and Psalter Pahlavi, but &quot;Y&quot; in Book Pahlavi except in front of pronominal enclitics; in Manichaean also &quot;īg&quot;, sp. &quot; ʿyg&quot;), which could be roughly translated as &#x27;which&#x27;. This is the predecessor of the New Persian construction known as Ezāfe. It could introduce:

# adjectives: &quot;kunišn ī nēk&quot; (&quot;kwnšn&#x27; Y nywk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;good deed&#x27;
# &#x27;genitive&#x27; possessor noun or pronoun phrases: &quot;pus ī Ardawān&quot; (&quot;BRE Y ʾldwʾn&quot;) &#x27;son of Ardawan&#x27;
# prepositional phrases: &quot;awīn ī andar diz&quot; &#x27;those in the fortress&#x27;
# dependent clauses: &quot;ēn warzīgar ... ī pad ēn deh mānēd&quot; (&quot;ZNE wlcykl ... Y PWN ZNE MTA KTLWNyt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;that farmer that lives in this village&#x27;

Besides following the head, the modifier can be attached to a demonstrative pronoun, usually &quot;(h)ān&quot; (&quot;ZK&quot;) &#x27;that&#x27;, but also &quot;ēn&quot; (&quot;ZNE&quot;), &quot;ōy&quot; (&quot;OLE&quot;) and &quot;ēd&quot; (&quot;HNA&quot;), which precedes the head of the phrase:

&quot;ān ī ahlaw kas&quot; (&quot;ZK Y ʾhlwb&#x27; AYŠ&quot;) &#x27;the righteous person&#x27;

&quot;ān ī-š pādixšāyīhā zan&quot; (&quot;ZK Yš ŠLYTAyhʾ NYŠE&quot;) &#x27;the wife he is lawfully married to&#x27;, lit. &#x27;the wife he lawfully has&#x27;.

===Adverbs===

Many adjectives can be used adverbially without any change: &quot;Ardawān saxt awištāft&quot; &#x27;Ardawan was in a great hurry&#x27; (&quot;ʾldwn sht&#x27; ʾwštʾp̄t&quot;), lit. &#x27;Ardawan was hurrying greatly&#x27;. However, adverbs can also be formed from adjectives, as well as from nouns and phrases, by adding the suffix &quot;-īhā&quot; (&quot;-yhʾ&quot;): &quot;tuxšāg-īhā&quot; (&quot;twxšʾkyhʾ&quot;) &#x27;diligent-ly&#x27;, &quot;dād-īhā&quot; (&quot;dʾtyhʾ&quot;) &#x27;law-fully&#x27;.

Like adjectives, adverbs can be compared; e.g. &quot;azabar&quot; (&quot;hcpl&quot;) &#x27;above&#x27; – &quot;azabartar&quot; (&quot;hcpltl&quot;) &#x27;farther above&#x27; – &quot;azabartom&quot; (&quot;hcpltwm&quot;) &#x27;farthest above&#x27;. Adverbs in &quot;-īhā&quot; can also be compared: &quot;kam-wināh-īhā-tar&quot; &#x27;with less sin&#x27;, lit. &#x27;more little-sin-fully&#x27;.

Some common locational adverbs are &quot;azabar&quot; (&quot;hcpl&quot;) &#x27;above&#x27; and &quot;azēr&quot; (&quot;hcdl&quot; or &quot;ʾdl&quot;) &#x27;below&#x27;, &quot;andarōn&quot; (&quot;BYNlwn&#x27;&quot; / &quot;ʾndlwn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;inside&#x27;, &quot;bērōn&quot; (&quot;bylwn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;outside&#x27;, &quot;pērāmōn&quot; (&quot;pylʾmwn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;around&#x27; and &quot;parrōn&quot; (&quot;plwn&#x27;&quot; &#x27;away, hence&#x27;). Many of these are formed as compounds with the noun &quot;rōn&quot; (&quot;lwn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;direction&#x27; as a second element.

For pronominal adverbs, see the sections on the pronouns of the respective types. For directional adverbs commonly co-occurring with verbs, see the section of preverbs.

=== Verbal morphology ===
Synthetic forms survive only in the present tense, although it does continue to distinguish to a greater or lesser extent four different moods. The past and perfect tenses are expressed periphrastically, even though there might be a few relicts of a synthetic imperfect in early inscriptions, and there may be a single synthetic imperfect form in Manichaean Middle Persian (see the section on &quot;The preterite&quot; below).

==== Stems ====
A Middle Persian verb has two stems – a present stem and a past stem, which coincides with the past participle. Most other synthetic forms are based on the present stem, but the infinitive uses the past stem (as do a few derivational suffixes, see below). The past stem generally ends in &quot;-d&quot; or &quot;-t&quot; (after voiced and voiceless consonants, respectively). Sometimes this is the only difference between the stems – this is common for roots in -š (&quot;kuš – &quot;kušt, sp. &quot;NKSWN-&quot;, &#x27;to kill&#x27;) and is also found e.g. in the verb &quot;xwardan&quot; (&quot;OŠTENtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;to eat&#x27; (&quot;xwar-&quot; – &quot;xward&quot;). However, much more commonly, there are other differences and the exact relationship between the two stems is often unpredictable. For example:

Some common patterns of alternation between the final consonants of the two stems are:

Other notable alternations are seen in &quot;ward-&quot; – &quot;wašt &#x27;to turn&#x27;, &quot;dār-&quot; – &quot;dāšt (&quot;YHSNN-&quot;) &#x27;to hold&#x27;, &quot;nimāy-&quot; – &quot;nimūd &#x27;to show&#x27;, &quot;zan-&quot; – &quot;zad (&quot;MHYTWN-&quot;) &#x27;to hit&#x27;.

Some verbs also derive the past stem merely by the addition of a suffix, which, however, does not consist solely of the consonant -&quot;t&quot;/&quot;d&quot;. Most commonly it is &quot;-īd&quot; (&quot;-yt&#x27;&quot;), but a number of verbs also take &quot;-ād&quot; (&quot;-ʾt&#x27;&quot;) or &quot;-ist&quot; (&quot;-st&quot;&#x27;):
The past stem formations in &quot;-īd&quot; and &quot;-ist&quot; are typical of denominative verbs, passives in the suffix &quot;-īh-&quot; and causatives.

Finally, a few stem pairs are clearly suppletive:

Another form of suppletion is found in the verb meaning &#x27;to be, exist&#x27;, which has the stem &quot;h-&quot; (spelt &quot;HWE-&quot;) in the present tense, but in the preterite it uses the forms of the verb &quot;būdan&quot; &#x27;to become, to be&#x27;, which has the present stem &quot;baw-&quot; (often contracted simply to &quot;b-&quot;) and the past stem &quot;būd&quot; (spelt &quot;YHWWN-&quot;).

==== Personal endings and present tense of the three moods ====

===== Overview =====
The present-tense forms of the four moods are formed by adding the following endings to the present stem:

For example, the verb &quot;raftan&quot; (&quot;SGYTWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;to go&#x27; will be conjugated as &quot;rawēm (&quot;SGYTWNym&quot;), &quot;rawē (&quot;SGYTWNyd&quot;), &quot;rawēd (&quot;SGYTWNyt&#x27;&quot;), etc. in the indicative, &quot;raw&quot; (&quot;SGYTWN&quot;), etc. in the imperative, &quot;rawān (&quot;SGYTWNʾn&quot;), rawāy (&quot;SGYTWNʾy&quot;), rawād (&quot;SGYTWNʾt&quot;), etc. in the subjunctive, and so on.

===== The vowel of the endings =====
The endings containing alternative vowels to &quot;ē&quot; are not found in Manichaean Middle Persian, except for the 1st person plural &quot;-om&quot;, which has, conversely, been reported to be the only version there. For the 1st person singular ending, most authors list &quot;-ēm&quot; as the normal form, but some consider &quot;-am&quot; to have been the regular ending in non-Manichaean Middle Persian as opposed to the 1st person plural &quot;-ēm&quot;. Thus, sg. &quot;-am&quot; : pl.&quot;-ēm&quot; in Pahlavi would correspond to sg. &quot;-ēm&quot; : pl. &quot;-om&quot; in Manichaean. In general, the apparently random variation of the vowels has been interpreted either as relicts of the inflection of minority stem types or, conversely, as foreshadowings of the New Persian form of the endings.

Furthermore, a small number of verbs had alternative contracted forms for the 3rd singular present with no vowel in the ending at all: e.g. &quot;kund for expected &quot;kunēd of &quot;kardan&quot;. Verbs for which such forms are attested include &quot;daštan&quot; (&quot;YHSNNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;hold&#x27; – &quot;dad (&quot;dt&#x27;&quot;)&quot;, raftan (&quot;SGYTWNtn&#x27;&quot;)&quot; &#x27;go&#x27; &quot;– rawd (lpd), burdan (YBLWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;carry&#x27; – &quot;bard (bld), čāštan (cʾštn&#x27;) &#x27;&quot;teach&#x27; &quot;- čāšt (&quot;čʾšt&#x27;&quot;), &quot;hōšīdan&quot; (&quot;hwšytn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;dry&#x27; &quot;- hōšt (&quot;hwšt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;dries&#x27; and &quot;fragendan&quot; (&quot;plkndn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;lay foundations&#x27; – &quot;fragend (&quot;plknd&quot;)&quot;.&quot; In addition, the present stem of &quot;būdan (YHWWNtn&#x27;)&quot; &#x27;become&#x27;&quot;, baw-,&quot; is often shortened to b-&quot;: b-ēd (byt&#x27;).&quot;

Although the 2nd singular imperative has no ending, a vowel &quot;-ā-&quot;&#x27; appears in it before enclitics in Manichaean and Psalter Pahlavi, e.g. &quot;ahrām-ā-m!&quot; (&quot;ʾhrʾmʾm&quot;) &#x27;raise me up!&#x27;

===== Subjunctive and optative =====
The subjunctive forms for persons other than the third occur in Manichaean Middle Persian, but not in Book Pahlavi. The subjunctive may express a wish (in the present tense) or a hypothetical or conditioned event (the latter mostly in the past tenses) The optative is another way to express a wish. However, the same meaning is expressed by combining the present indicative with separate optative particles: &quot;ē(w)&quot;, sp.&quot;ʾy(w)&quot; in Book Pahlavi (e.g. &quot;ē dārēd&quot;, sp. &quot;ʾy YHSNNyt&#x27;&quot; &#x27;let him possess it&#x27;) and &quot;hēb&quot; in Manichaean (e.h. &quot;hēb dārēd&quot; &quot;hyb dʾryd&quot;, the same) The present indicative and the present subjunctive may also express future tense (the former is used especially for near future).

===== Copula =====
The synthetic forms of the copula verb follow mostly the same pattern as other verbs, the present stem consisting of the consonant &quot;h-&quot; (sp. &quot;HWE-&quot;) alone: thus, 1st sg. ind. &quot;hēm (&quot;HWEym&quot;) or &quot;ham (&quot;HWEm&quot;), subj. &quot;hān&quot;, etc. However, the 3rd person singular of the present indicative is &quot;ast&quot; (sp. &quot;AYT&quot;), and this latter form is used mostly in the meaning &#x27;to exist&#x27;; it is usually (but not always) omitted when the meaning is of pure predication, as in &quot;he is a man&quot; – &quot;ōy mard&quot; (&quot;OLE GBRA&quot;), in contrast to &quot;there is a man&quot; – &quot;mard ast&quot; (&quot;AYT GBRA&quot;). The 3rd plural &quot;hēnd&quot; is often omitted as well, and even a subjunctive &quot;hād&quot; may be absent. Moreover, the existential 3rd person singular also has a special contracted negated form: instead of the regular *&quot;nē ast&quot; (&quot;LA AYT&quot;), it is &quot;nēst&quot; (&quot;LOYT&#x27;&quot;)

The optative proper is regular: &quot;hē (&quot;HWEyd&quot;). The imperative function, however, appears to be performed by an optative form of the verb &quot;būdan&quot; (&quot;YHWWNtn&#x27;&quot;), &#x27;to be, become&#x27;: &quot;bāš&quot; contracted from &quot;bawēš, and in the plural imperative, the same verb is used: &quot;bawēd&quot;.

Finally, the copula could also occur in enclitic form without the initial &quot;h-&quot;, although this is not found very often in written texts: &quot;kōdak-am&quot; (sp. &quot;kwtkm&quot;) &#x27;I am small&#x27;.

===== Imperfect =====
In addition to these endings, P. O. Skjærvø (2009: 219) identifies relicts of the Old Persian imperfect in Inscriptional Pahlavi: the markers, which are added to the present stem, are &quot;-ēn&quot; for the 1st singular, &quot;-ē&quot; or &quot;-ēd&quot; for the 3rd and &quot;-om&quot; for the 1st plural. However, in the synthetic passive formed with the suffixes &quot;-īh-&quot; or &quot;-īy-&quot;, no ending is added at all in the imperfect: &quot;gugānīh-∅&quot; &#x27;was destroyed&#x27;. There is much uncertainty and debate about the exact interpretations of these and similar forms.

===== Number agreement =====
When a plural subject is inanimate, the verb may remain in the singular instead of agreeing with it, unless individuality is specially emphasised.

==== Periphrastic forms ====

===== Past tenses =====
All the past tenses use periphrastic constructions with the main verb in the past participle form; e.g. &quot;raft&quot; from the verb &quot;raftan&quot; (&quot;SGYTWN&quot; &#x27;go&#x27;). The finite auxiliary verb is conjugated for the appropriate person and mood; the rules for person agreement in particular are described in the section on &quot;Ergativity in the past tenses&quot;. The constructions are as follows:

====== The preterite ======
The preterite is formed by combining the past participle of the verb and the copula &quot;h-&quot; (&quot;HWE-&quot;) used as an auxiliary verb conjugated for the appropriate person and mood. The copula is, as usual, dropped in the third singular:

: &quot;(az) raft hēm&quot; (&quot;(ANE) SGYTWNt&#x27; HWEym&quot;) &#x27;I went&#x27;, but:
: &quot;(ōy) raft&quot; (&quot;(OLE) SGYTWNt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;he went&#x27;.

Since the verb &quot;h-&quot; has no corresponding past participle of the same root, it uses suppletively the past participle of &quot;būdan&quot;:

: &quot;(az) būd hēm&quot; (&quot;(ANE) YHWWNt&#x27;&quot; / &quot;bwt&#x27; HWEym&quot;) &#x27;I was&#x27;, but:
: &quot;(ōy) būd&quot; (&quot;(OLE) YHWWNt / bwt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;he was&#x27;. This tense expresses an action in the past.

In addition, a synthetically (and suppletively) formed past tense of the copula appears to be found in Manichaean Middle Persian: 3rd person singular &quot;anād&quot; &#x27;was&#x27; and 3rd person plural &quot;anānd&quot; &#x27;were&#x27;. There is no obvious difference in function between this and the ordinary preterite. This has been said to be a relict of the Old Persian imperfect tense, and it has been conjectured that a mysterious Armaeogram &quot;HWYTN-&quot; occurring in Inscriptional Pahlavi also designates the stem found in this form of the copula.

====== The past preterite ======
The past preterite also uses the past participle, but it differs from the simple preterite in that the copula &quot;itself&quot; is in the preterite rather than the present here:

&quot;(az) raft būd hēm&quot; ((&quot;ANE&quot;) &quot;SGYTWNt&#x27; YHWWNt&#x27;&quot; / &quot;bwt&#x27;&quot; HWEym) &#x27;I had gone&#x27;;

: &quot;(ōy) raft būd&quot; ((&quot;OLE&quot;) &quot;SGYTWNt&#x27; YHWWNt&#x27;&quot; / &quot;bwt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;(he) had gone&#x27;.

Since Manichaean Middle Persian (and possibly Inscriptional Pahlavi) retains synthetic past (imperfect) forms of the copula, it is also able to use them as auxiliaries in the past preterite construction (which has then been called &#x27;past imperfect&#x27;, although it does not seem to have a different function from the other construction):

: &quot;(ōy) raft anād&quot; = &#x27;(he) had gone&#x27;.
: &quot;(awēšān) raft anānd&quot; = &#x27;(they) had gone&#x27;.

The past preterite expresses an action preceding another action in the past.

====== The perfect ======
The perfect also uses the past participle, but it differs from the preterite in that the auxiliary verb uses is not the copula, but &quot;ēstādan&quot; (&quot;YKOYMWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;to stand&#x27; in the present tense. Thus:

: &quot;(az) raft ēstēm&quot; (&quot;(ANE) SGYTWNt&#x27; YKOYMWNym&quot;) &#x27;I have/am gone&#x27;
: &quot;(ōy) raft ēstēd&quot; (&quot;(OLE) SGYTWNt&#x27; YKOYMWNyt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;(he) has/is gone&#x27;.

This tense expresses a past action whose results are still observable in the present.

====== The past perfect ======
The past perfect or pluperfect differs from the simple perfect in that the verb &quot;ēstādan&quot; &quot;itself&quot; is in the preterite rather than the present here:

: &quot;(az) raft ēstād hēm&quot; ((&quot;ANE&quot;) &quot;SGYTWNt&#x27; YKOYMWNʾt&#x27; HWEym&quot;) &#x27;I had/was gone&#x27;;
: &quot;(ōy) raft ēstād&quot; ((&quot;OLE&quot;) &quot;SGYTWNt&#x27; YKOYMWNaʾt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;(he) had/was gone&#x27;.

This tense expresses a past action whose results were still observable at some point in the past.

====== Past pluperfect ======
Some authors identify yet another form, a past pluperfect:

: &quot;(az) raft ēstād būd hēm&quot; ((&quot;ANE&quot;) &quot;SGYTWNt&#x27; YKOYMWNʾt&#x27; YHWWNt&#x27;&quot; / &quot;bwt&#x27; HWEym&quot;) &#x27;I had/was gone&#x27;;
: &quot;(ōy) raft ēstād būd&quot; ((&quot;OLE&quot;) &quot;SGYTWNt&#x27; YKOYMWNʾt&#x27; YHWWNt&#x27;&quot; / &quot;bwt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;(he) had/was gone&#x27;.

====== Omission of the auxiliary verb ======
The auxiliary &quot;būdan&quot; is sometimes omitted not only in the 3rd person singular, but even in the plural: &quot;u-mān ō padīrag āmad awēšān widerdagān ruwān&quot; (&quot;APmʾn&#x27; OL ptyrk&#x27; YATWNt&#x27; OLEšʾn&#x27; wtltkʾn&#x27; lwbʾn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;and the souls of the departed came to meet us.&#x27;

====== Ergativity in the past tenses ======
Like the English and Latin past participles, the Middle Persian past participle describes the logical &quot;subject&quot; of a verb when the verb is intransitive, but the logical object of the verb when the verb is transitive: e.g. &quot;raft&quot; (&quot;SGYTWNt&quot;&#x27;) &#x27;(somebody who is) gone&#x27;, but &quot;dīd&quot; (&quot;HZYTWNt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;(something that is) seen (by somebody)&#x27;. As a result, the construction with the copula (and with the auxiliary &quot;ēstādan&quot;) has &#x27;active&#x27; meaning when the verb is intransitive – &quot;tō raft hē&quot;, sp. &quot;(LK) SGYTWNt&#x27; HWEyd&quot;, lit. &#x27;you are gone&#x27; – but &#x27;passive&#x27; meaning when the verb is transitive – &quot;(tō) mard dīd&quot;, sp. &quot;(LK) GBRA HZYTWNt&#x27;&quot;, lit. &#x27;the man is seen (by you)&#x27;. In other words, the participant that normally would have been the object is treated as the subject here, and the participant that normally would have been the subject is treated as an oblique modifier. Since in these transitive verb constructions, the participant that is treated like the single argument of an intransitive verb is not the more subject-like one, but the more object-like one, the morphosyntactic alignment of these constructions is ergative. Since this alignment is confined to the past tenses, it is further described as split-ergative.

The most obvious consequence of this that while the verb in a past tense agrees with the (logical) subject if it is intransitive (just as it would in the present tense), it agrees with the (logical) object if it is transitive:

: &quot;tō mardān dīd hēnd&quot; (&quot;LK GBRAʾn HZYTWNt&#x27; HWEnd)&quot; = &#x27;you saw the men&#x27;, lit. &#x27;by you the men were seen&#x27;;

Cf. present tense: &quot;tō mardān wēnē&quot; (&quot;LK GBRAʾn HZYTWNyd) = &#x27;&quot;you see the men&#x27;;

Cf. also the past tense of an intransitive verb: &quot;tō raft hē&quot; (&quot;LK SGYTWNt&#x27; HWEyd&quot;) &#x27;you went&#x27;

: &quot;mardān tō dīd hē&quot; (&quot;GBRAʾn LK HZYTWNt&#x27; HWEyd&quot;) = &#x27;The men saw you&#x27;, lit. &#x27;by the men you were seen&#x27;;

Cf. present tense: &quot;mardān tō wēnēnd&quot; (&quot;GBRAʾn LK HZYTWNt&#x27; HWEnd&quot;) = &#x27;the men see you&#x27;;

Cf. also the past tense of an intransitive verb: &quot;mardān raft hēnd&quot; (&quot;GBRAʾn SGYTWNt&#x27; HWEnd&quot;) &#x27;the men went&#x27;

Another consequence is seen in the case inflection of nominals, inasmuch as it is preserved. In contrast to the use of the cases in the present tense, the ergative construction means that it is the logical object that is in the direct case and the logical subject that is in the oblique case. Thus, originally we would have, e.g. &quot;az mardān wēnēm&quot; &#x27;I see the men&#x27; in the present, but &quot;man mard dīd hēnd in the past; &quot;mard man wēnēnd &#x27;the men see me&#x27; in the present, but &quot;mardān az dīd hēm&quot; &#x27;the men saw me&#x27; in the past. Even after the last vestiges of case inflection in nouns and the stressed forms of the pronouns had been lost and so their forms in ergative and nominative constructions had become identical, the fact that the very frequent pronominal enclitics were restricted to the oblique case meant that their use still reflected the alignment difference between the tenses:

: &quot;u-t mard dīd&quot; (&quot;APt GBRA HZYTWNt&#x27;&quot;) = &#x27;and you saw the man&#x27;

Cf. present tense: &quot;u-t mard wēnēd&quot; &quot;APt GBRA HZYTWNyt&#x27;&quot;) = &#x27;and the man sees you&#x27;

In contrast, *&quot;u-t raft hē&quot; &#x27;and you went&#x27; is impossible, as is *&quot;u-t mard dīd hē&quot; &#x27;and the man saw you&#x27;. That is because only the stressed form of the pronoun can function in the direct case.

Finally, it may be pointed out that the possibility of expressing the logical subject at all appears to have developed later in the perfect tenses with &quot;ēstādan&quot; than in the preterites with &quot;būdan&quot;. It is not yet found in Inscriptional and Psalter Pahlavi, nor in Manichaean Middle Persian, where these constructions are impersonal and passive. However, in Book Pahlavi, it is already found regularly, so that clauses like &quot;u-t mard dīd ēstē&quot; are fully possible.

===== Present passive =====
The present tense proper of the verb &quot;būdan&quot;, &quot;bawēm&quot;, is also combined with the past participle to express a kind of present passive: &quot;dād bawēd&quot; (&quot;YHBWNt&#x27; YHWWNyt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;it is, will have been given&#x27;. As in the ergative construction, the agent can occasionally be expressed with an oblique enclitic, e.g. &quot;ā-š kard bawēd&quot; &#x27;then it is done by him&#x27; (&quot;ʾš OBYDWNyt&#x27; YHWWNyt&#x27;&quot;).

===== Future periphrasis =====
Albeit rarely, the verb &quot;kamistan&quot; &#x27;to want&#x27; combined with an infinitive may express future tense: &quot;dušpādixšāyīh ī awēšān sar kāmēd būdan&quot; (&quot;dwšSLYTAyh Y OLEšʾn&#x27; LOYŠE YCBENyt&#x27; YHWWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;their evil rule will end&#x27;, lit. &#x27;wants to end&#x27;.

==== Aspectual verbal particles ====
There are two particles occurring before the verb which may modify its aspectual meaning (apparently in opposite ways), even though their use is not obligatory.

One of them appears in Pahlavi as &quot;be&quot; (&quot;BRA&quot;) and in Manichaean as &quot;ba&quot; (&quot;bʾ&quot;). Its earliest meaning seems to have been directional and specifically andative, i.e. &#x27;away, out&#x27;, and this is still said to be the case in Inscriptional and Psalter Pahlavi as well as in Manichaean, but in Book Pahlavi it also seems to have other meanings, which are less clear and more controversial. It has been argued to express perfective aspect in the past or in the future. For example, &quot;mard ī šahr ka-š kas pad pusīh be padīrēd&quot; (&quot;GBRA y štr&#x27; AMTš AYŠ PWN BREyh BRA MKBLWNyt&#x27;)&quot; &#x27;if somebody adopts a man of the kingdom as his son&#x27;; &quot;Šābuhr be xandīd&quot; (&quot;šʾpwhl GHBHWNyt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;Šābuhr laughed&#x27;. It also occurs relatively frequently with imperatives in Book Pahlavi, but not in Manichaean Middle Persian.

The other particle is &quot;hamē&quot; (&quot;hmʾy&quot;), originally identical to the adverb meaning &#x27;always&#x27;. It expresses imperfective and more specifically durative or iterative aspect: &quot;kanīzag pad sar ī čāh būd ud ... čahārpāyān rāy āb hamē dād&quot; (&quot;knyck&#x27; PWN LOYŠE y cʾh YHWWNt&#x27; ... chʾlpʾdʾn rʾd MYA hmʾy YHBWNt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;the girl was by the side of the well and was giving water to the animals&#x27;. Some have viewed its aspectual use as a late phenomenon indicative of the transition to New Persian.

==== Non-finite verb forms ====

===== Infinitive =====
The infinitive has two versions:

# a &#x27;long&#x27; one that is derived from the past stem by adding &quot;-an&quot;: e.g. &quot;kardan&quot; (&quot;kartn&#x27; / OBYDWNtn&#x27;&quot;)
# a &#x27;short&#x27; one that is identical to the past stem, and thus to the past participle: &quot;kard&quot; (&quot;kart&#x27;&quot; / &quot;OBYDWNt&#x27;)&quot;

It can function syntactically as a (verbal) noun: &quot;pad griftan ī Ardaxšīr&quot; (&quot;PWN OHDWNtn&#x27; Y ʾrthšyr&quot;) &#x27;in order to seize Ardaxšīr&#x27; (lit. &#x27;for the seizing of Ardaxšīr&#x27;), &quot;hangām ī xwarišn xwardan&quot; (&quot;hngʾm y OŠTENšn&#x27; OŠTENtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;the time to eat food&#x27; (lit. the time of food eating&#x27;)&quot;.&quot;

===== Participles =====
The past participle, which coincides with the past stem. It has passive meaning when the verb is transitive, but active meaning when the verb is intransitive: &quot;kard&quot; (&quot;krt&#x27;&quot; or &quot;OBYDWNt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;made&#x27; but &quot;āxist&quot; (&quot;KDMWNt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;risen&#x27;. It is most commonly used predicatively, but it can also be nominalised: &quot;duzīd&quot; (&quot;dwcyd&quot;) &#x27;the stolen (goods)&#x27;. If it is an attribute modifier instead, it is usually introduced by the relative particle: &quot;čiš ī widard&quot; (&quot;MNDOM Y wtlt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;a thing that has passed away, vanished&#x27;.

An extended form of the past participle is produced by the addition of the suffix &quot;-ag&quot; (&quot;-k&quot;) to the past stem. This form is used attributively more often than the previous one: &quot;duxt ī padīriftag&quot; (&quot;BRTE Y MKBLWNtk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;an adopted daughter&#x27; and is also frequently nominalised: &quot;nibištag&quot; (&quot;YKTYBWNtk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;something written, a document&#x27; (cf. Latin &quot;scriptum&quot;, English &quot;writ&quot;).

There is also a present active participle derived from the present stem with the ending in &quot;-ān&quot; (&quot;ʾn&quot;): e.g. &quot;griyān (&quot;BKYWNʾn&quot;), &quot;gldʾn&quot;), &#x27;crying&#x27;. It may occur as a gerund – &quot;zarduxšt griyān passox guft&quot; (&quot;zrtwxšt gldʾn pshw&#x27; gwpt&quot;), &#x27;Zarasthustra answered, weeping.&#x27; and is the usual verb form governed by the verb &quot;niwistan&quot; (&quot;nwystn&quot;) &#x27;to begin&#x27;, which, however, is mostly typical of Manichaean (albeit attested in Psalter Pahlavi). These constructions are rare in Book Pahlavi. Historically, the derivational deverbal suffix &quot;-endag&quot; / &quot;-andag&quot; (-&quot;ndk&#x27;&quot;) as in &quot;sōzendag (&quot;swcndk&#x27;&quot; &#x27;burning&#x27;) contains the Proto-Indo-European present active participle suffix and it does retain such a meaning, so the adjective derived with has also been called a &#x27;participle&#x27;. So have deverbal adjectives formed with the productive suffix &quot;-āg&quot; (-&quot;ʾk&#x27;&quot;) as in &quot;sazāg&quot; (&quot;scʾk&quot;) &#x27;fitting&#x27;, which also have very similar semantics (see the section on &quot;Word formation&quot;). Both of these latter are mostly used attributively.

The suffix &quot;-išn&quot; (&quot;-šn&quot;) generally forms deverbal nouns of action from the present stem of the verb as in &quot;kunišn&quot; (&quot;kwnšn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;doing, deed, action&#x27; from &quot;kardan&quot; (&quot;OBYDWNtn&#x27;&quot; / &quot;krtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;to do&#x27;. However, such formations also function in predicative position as gerundives and have since been referred to as &#x27;participles of necessity&#x27;: &quot;u-š čē kunišn&quot; &#x27;And what is he to do?&#x27;, lit. &#x27;What is an (appropriate) action for him?&#x27;; &quot;mardōmān ... mizd ī mēnōy bē nē hilišn&quot; (&quot;ANŠWTAʾn mzd Y mynwd BRE LA ŠBKWNšn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;people must not relinquish their reward in the spiritual world&#x27;. Indeed, they have come to resemble adjectives in that they can be inflected for degree: &quot;zanišntar (&quot;MHYTWNšntl) &#x27;more worthy of being hit/killed&#x27;.

===== Voice =====
The periphrastic present passive construction with a past participle and &quot;būdan&quot; in the present tense (&quot;dād bawēd&quot;, &#x27;is given&#x27;) has already been mentioned in the section &quot;Present passive&quot;. The corresponding ergative preterite constructions and ergative perfect tense constructions with &quot;ēstādan&quot; &#x27;stand&#x27; are not really passive, since they do not contrast with an active form in the same tense and are the standard and only way of expressing these tenses. Nevertheless, they can still be used without an overt agent, resulting in a passive meaning: &quot;pus ... ōzad&quot; (&quot;BRE YKTLWNt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;the son ... was killed&#x27;, &quot;mardōm ... xwānd hēnd&quot; (&quot;ANŠWTA ... KRYTWNt&#x27; HWEnd&quot;) &#x27;the people ... were called&#x27;.

Another periphrastic way of expressing the passive is by using a third person plural &#x27;they&#x27; as an impersonal subject: &quot;kas pad wēmārīh nē mīrēd bē pad zarmānīh ayāb ōzanēnd&quot; (&quot;AYŠ PWN wymʾryh LA BRE YMYTWNyt&#x27; PWN zlmʾnyh ʾdwp YKTLWNynd&quot;) &#x27;nobody will die of illness, but (only) from of old age or they will be killed (lit. or they kill them)&#x27;.

However, there is also a &quot;synthetic&quot; passive form derived from the present stem with the suffix &quot;-īh-&quot; (&quot;-yh-&quot;), in older texts such as the Pahlavi Psalter also &quot;-īy-&quot; (sp. -&quot;yd&quot;-). The vowel might have been shortened in later Middle Persian pronunciation. The corresponding past stem may end in &quot;-ist&quot; or in &quot;-īd&quot;. Some examples are &quot;dārīhēd&quot; (&quot;YHSNNyhyt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;is held&#x27; (of &quot;dāštan&quot;, present stem &quot;dār-&quot;, &#x27;to hold&#x27;), &quot;yazīhīd&quot; (&quot;YDBHWNyhyt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;was recited&#x27; (of &quot;yaštan&quot;, present stem &quot;yaz-&quot;, &#x27;to recite, celebrate&#x27;). If the base verb has the factitive/causative suffix &quot;-ēn-&quot; (&quot;-yn-&quot;), it is removed before the addition of &quot;-īh-&quot;: &quot;rawāgēnīdan&quot; (&quot;lwbʾkynytn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;propagate&#x27; &gt; &quot;rawāgīhistan&quot; &#x27;be propagated&#x27; (&quot;lwbʾkyhystn&#x27;&quot;)

===== Possession =====
Middle Persian does not have a verb &#x27;to have&#x27;. Instead, possession is expressed by stating the existence of the possessed object using the verb &#x27;to be&#x27; and by treating the possessor as an oblique argument (inflecting it in the oblique case, if possible): &quot;man paygāl ast&quot; (&quot;L pygʾl AYT&#x27;) &#x27;To me, a cup exists&#x27; = &#x27;I have a cup&#x27;;&quot; xwāstag ī-š ast &quot;(&quot;NKSYA Yš AYT&#x27;) &#x27;the property which he has&#x27;, lit. &#x27;which exists to him&#x27;.

=== Preverbs ===
Certain adverbial particles are combined with verbs to express direction, while remaining separate words. The most important ones are the following:

Some of these (&quot;abar&quot; and &quot;andar&quot;) function as prepositions as well.

=== Prepositions ===
The most common simple prepositions are:

The special postposed forms of &quot;pad&quot;, &quot;ō&quot; and &quot;az&quot; with a resumptive pronoun &quot;-(i)š&quot; – &quot;padiš&quot; (&quot;ptš&quot;), &quot;awiš&quot; (&quot;ʾwbš&quot;), &quot;aziš&quot; (&quot;hcš&quot;) – have already been mentioned in the section on pronouns.

Certain adverbs and nouns can be used as prepositions, in which case they usually (but not always) use the relative particle or the preposition &quot;az&quot; to introduce the noun: thus the adverb &quot;pēš&quot; (&quot;LOYN&#x27;&quot;) can be extended as &quot;pēš ī&quot; &#x27;in front of&#x27;, &quot;pēš az&quot; &#x27;before&#x27;. In turn, the adverb may be preceded by a preposition: &quot;ō pēš ī&quot;. A noun does not necessarily require a preceding preposition: &quot;mayān ī&quot; (&quot;mdyʾn Y&quot;) &#x27;(in) the middle of&#x27;. In this way, many prepositional meanings are expressed: &#x27;before&#x27; (&quot;pēš ī,&quot; sp. &quot;LOYN&#x27; Y&quot;), &#x27;after&#x27; (&quot;pas ī&quot; &quot;AHL&quot;), &#x27;around&#x27; (&quot;pērāmōn ī,&quot; sp. &quot;pylʾmwn&#x27; Y&quot;), &#x27;beside&#x27; (&quot;kanārag ī&quot;, sp. &quot;knʾlk&#x27; Y&quot;), &#x27;near, close to&#x27; (&quot;nazdīk ī&quot;, sp. &quot;nzdyk&#x27; Y&quot;), &#x27;beside, around&#x27; (&quot;pad sar ī,&quot; sp. &quot;PWN LOYŠE Y&quot;), &#x27;except, apart from&#x27; &quot;ǰud az&quot; (sp. &quot;ywdt&#x27; MN&#x27;&quot;), etc. Instead of being introduced by &quot;ī&quot;, the component nominal phrase may also be placed before the noun, so it becomes possible to speak of an &#x27;ambiposition&#x27;: &quot;az / ō ... rōn&quot; (&quot;MN / OL ... lwn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;from / in the direction of&#x27; (from &quot;rōn&quot; &#x27;direction&#x27;); a similar structure is seen in &quot;bē ... enyā&quot; (&quot;BRA ... ʾynyʾ&quot;) &#x27;except&#x27;, where &quot;enyā&quot; &#x27;otherwise&#x27; may also be omitted.

While prepositions can remain stranded after their complements because of some syntactic processes mentioned above, there is also a &quot;regular&quot; postposition: &quot;rāy&quot; (&quot;lʾd&quot;), meaning &#x27;for (the sake of)&#x27;, &#x27;because of&#x27;, &#x27;about&#x27;, &#x27;to&#x27;. The postpositional phrase can also be preceded by a preposition: &quot;az ... rāy&quot; &#x27;because of&#x27;, &quot;pad ... rāy&quot; &#x27;concerning, in order to&#x27;. In some other combinations that have been identified as &#x27;ambipositions&#x27;, the first element can also be dropped, causing the second one to occur as a postposition: such is the case in &quot;(az) ... hammis(t)&quot; (&#x27;together with&#x27;) and &quot;(bē) ... tā&quot; &#x27;except&#x27;.

=== Conjunctions ===
The most common coordinating conjunctions are:
The word &quot;ā-&quot; (&quot;ʾ&quot;) &#x27;then&#x27; may be described as a demonstrative adverb, but it, too, operates as a sentence connector or introducing particle much like &quot;u-&quot;, albeit less frequently: an important function of both seems to be to &#x27;support&#x27; a pronominal enclitic, and &quot;ā-&quot; generally occurs with one, e.g. &quot;ā-š dīd&quot; (&quot;ʾš HZYTWNt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;then he saw&#x27;.

The common subordinating conjunctions are:

The conjunction &quot;ud&quot; may be reinforced with the particle &quot;ham&quot; (&quot;hm&quot;): &quot;ham abar ahlawān ud ham abar druwandān&quot; (&quot;hm QDM ʾhlwbʾn W hm QDM dlwndʾn&quot;) &#x27;both for the righteous and for the unrighteous&#x27;.

=== Particles ===
The particles are:

# &quot;nē&quot; (&quot;LA&quot;) &#x27;not&#x27;, a negative particle; e.g. &quot;mardōm ham nē dēw&quot; (&quot;ANŠWTA HWEm LA ŠDYA&quot;) &#x27;I am human, not a demon.&#x27; As already mentioned, it merges with the verb form &quot;ast&quot; (&quot;AYT&quot;) &#x27;exists, there is&#x27; in the contraction &quot;nēst&#x27;&quot; (&quot;LOYT&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;doesn&#x27;t exist, there isn&#x27;t&#x27;.
# &quot;ma&quot; or &quot;mā&quot; (&quot;AL&quot;) &#x27;do not&#x27;, a prohibitative particle preceding verbs in the imperative and the conjunctive: &quot;ān xwāstag ma stan!&quot; (&quot;ZK NKSYA AL YNSBWN&quot;) &#x27;Do not take this thing!&#x27;
# &quot;-(i)z&quot; (-(&quot;y&quot;)&quot;c&quot;) &#x27;also, too, even&#x27;. The vowel-initial version is used after consonants. This particle is enclitic and appended to whatever is being emphasised: &quot;ēn-iz paydāg&quot; (&quot;ZNEc pytʾk&quot;&#x27;) &#x27;This, too, is clear.&#x27;

===Word formation===

====Suffixes that form nouns====

The most productive suffixes that form nouns are

=====Action noun suffixes=====
# &quot;-išn&quot; (&quot;-šn&#x27;&quot;) is by far the most productive suffix that forms action nouns and nouns with related meanings from the present stems of verbs: &quot;menīdan&quot; (&quot;mynytn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;to think&#x27; &gt; &quot;menišn (&quot;mynšn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;thinking, thought&#x27;, &quot;xwardan&quot; (&quot;OŠTENtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;to eat&#x27; &gt; &quot;xwarišn (&quot;OŠTENšn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;food&#x27;. The verbal noun in &quot;-isn&quot; (&quot;-šn&quot;) also functions in predicative position as a gerundive, expressing that the action &#x27;ought to be&#x27; performed: &quot;andar hamahlān ... hučašm bawišn&quot; (&quot;BYN hmʾlʾn ... hwcšm bwšn&quot;) &#x27;among comrades ... one ought to be benevolent&#x27;.
# &quot;-ag&quot; (&quot;-k&quot;) forms nouns (action nouns, but often with various concrete meanings) from verbs (both stems) and numerals: &quot;widardan&quot; (&quot;wtltn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;pass, cross&#x27; &gt; &quot;widarag&quot; (&quot;wtlg&quot;) &#x27;path, passage&#x27;, &quot;čāštan&quot; (&quot;cʾštn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;teach&#x27; &gt; &quot;čāštag (&quot;cʾštk&quot;) &#x27;teaching&#x27;, &quot;haft&quot; (&quot;hp̄t&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;seven&#x27; &gt; &quot;haftag (&quot;hp̄tk&quot;) &#x27;week&#x27;
This suffix is also thought to have had diminutive meaning and appears to have been added to already existing nouns with no change in meaning (&quot;ǰām&quot; &gt; &quot;ǰāmag &#x27;glass&#x27;) or with an unpredictable change (&quot;čašm&quot;, sp. &quot;AYNE&quot;, &#x27;an eye&#x27; &gt; &quot;čašmag, sp. &quot;cšmk&#x27;&quot; &#x27;a spring, well&#x27;). As such, it was a very productive and expanding suffix. It is identical to an adjective-forming suffix, and that it was its original function; on that, see the next section.

=====Abstract noun suffixes=====
# &quot;-īh&quot; (&quot;-yh&quot;) is by far the most productive suffix that forms abstract nouns from adjectives, nouns and rarely from verbs: &quot;tārīg&quot; or &quot;tārīk&quot; (&quot;tʾryk&quot;) &#x27;dark&#x27; &gt; &quot;tārīgīh&quot; (&quot;tʾrykyh) &#x27;darkness&#x27;; &quot;dōst&quot; (&quot;dwst&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;friend&#x27; &gt; &quot;dōstīh (&quot;dwstyh&quot;) &#x27;friendship&#x27;; &quot;ast&quot; (&quot;AYT&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;exists&#x27; &gt; &quot;astīh (&quot;AYTyh&quot;) &#x27;existence&#x27; It can be combined with the action noun suffix &quot;-išn&quot; as &quot;-išnīh&quot; (&quot;-šnyh&quot;): &quot;drō-gōwišnīh (&quot;KDBA YMRRWNšnyh&quot; / &quot;dlwb&#x27; YMRRWNšnyh&quot;) &#x27;speaking lies&#x27;:
# An unproductive suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives is &quot;-āy&quot; (&quot;-ʾd&quot;), most commonly expressing size or degree along a certain dimension: &quot;pahn&quot; (&quot;pʾhn&quot;) &#x27;wide&#x27; &gt; &quot;pahnāy&quot; (&quot;phnʾd&quot;) &#x27;width&#x27;.

=====Agent noun suffixes=====
# &quot;-ār&quot; (&quot;-ʾl&quot;) is a productive suffix that forms agent nouns from the past stems of verbs: &quot;dādan&quot; (&quot;YHBWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;give, create&#x27; &gt; &quot;dādār (&quot;dʾtʾl&quot;) &#x27;creator&#x27;. There are some surprising exceptions where the meaning is passive: &quot;griftan&quot; (&quot;OHDWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;seize&#x27; &gt; &quot;griftār (&quot;glptʾl&quot;) &#x27;prisoner&#x27;.
#: The likewise productive suffix &quot;-āg&quot; (&quot;-ʾk&quot;) has also been said to derive agent nouns from verbs, but they might be seen as adjectives as well and are treated in the section on adjectives. 
# &quot;-gar&quot; (&quot;-kl&quot;) and &quot;-gār&quot; (&quot;-kʾl&quot;), both occasionally appearing with an initial &quot;ī&quot;, productively derive nouns from nouns, expressing the meaning &#x27;doer of something&#x27;, as well as adjectives from nouns meaning &#x27;doing something&#x27;: &quot;warz&quot; (&quot;wlc&quot;) &#x27;work, farming&#x27; &gt; &quot;warzīgar (&quot;wlcykl&quot;) &#x27;worker, farmer&#x27;; &quot;wināh&quot; (&quot;wnʾs&quot;) &#x27;sin&#x27; &gt; &quot;wināhgār &#x27;sinner&#x27; (&quot;wnʾskl&quot;), &quot;ziyān&quot; (&quot;zydʾn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;harm&#x27; &gt; &quot;ziyāngār (&quot;zydʾnkʾl&quot;) &#x27;harmful&#x27;. When the base noun ends in the suffix &quot;-ag&quot;, both the final consonant of the stem and the initial consonant of the suffix appear as &quot;/k/&quot;: &quot;kirbag&quot; (&quot;krpk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;good deed&#x27; &gt; &quot;kirbakkar (&quot;krpkkl&quot;) &#x27;doer of good deeds, beneficent&#x27;.
# &quot;-bān&quot; (&quot;pʾn&#x27;&quot;) productively forms nouns meaning somebody in charge of what the base noun designates, a caretaker: &quot;stōr&quot; (&quot;stwl&quot;) &#x27;horse&#x27; &gt; &quot;stōrbān&quot; (&quot;stwlpʾn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;groom&#x27;.
# &quot;-bed&quot; (&quot;pt&#x27;&quot;) forms titles with a similar meaning to the above suffix, but with a nuance of power and possession rather than caretaking: &quot;spāh&quot; (&quot;spʾh&quot;) &#x27;army&#x27; &gt; &quot;spāhbed&quot; (&quot;spʾhpt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;army commander&#x27;.
# &quot;-yār&quot; (&quot;-dʾl&quot;) is a rare suffix with a somewhat similar meaning to the previous one, as seen in &quot;šahr&quot; (&quot;štr&#x27;&quot;) &gt; &quot;šahryār&quot; (&quot;štr&#x27;dʾl&quot;).
# &quot;-(a)gān&quot; (-&quot;kʾn&#x27;&quot;) is a rare suffix that derives nouns from other nouns; the meaning is of a person or thing connected to what the base noun designates: &quot;wāzār&quot; (&quot;wʾcʾl&quot;) &#x27;market&#x27; &gt; &quot;wāzāragān&quot; (&quot; wʾcʾlkʾn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;merchant&#x27;

=====Place nouns=====
# &quot;-(e/i)stān&quot; (&quot;stʾn&#x27;&quot;) is a productive suffix that forms place nouns: &quot;asp&quot; (&quot;SWSYA&quot;) &#x27;horse&#x27; &gt; &quot;aspestān (&quot;ʾs̄pstʾn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;horse stable&#x27;, &quot;hindūg&quot; (&quot;hndwk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;Indian&#x27; &gt; &quot;hindūstān (&quot;hndwstʾn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;India&#x27;. It is also included in the names of seasons.
# &quot;-dān&quot; (&quot;-dʾn&#x27;&quot;) is a rare suffix forming place nouns: &quot;ast(ag)&quot; (&quot;ʾstk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;bone&#x27; &gt; &quot;astōdān&quot; (&quot;ʾstw&quot;(&quot;k&quot;)&quot;dʾn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;ossuary&#x27;
# &quot;-īgān&quot; (&quot;-ykʾn&#x27;&quot;) apparently forms collective and place nouns: &quot;māh&quot; (&quot;BYRH&quot;) &#x27;moon, month&#x27; &gt; &quot;māhīgān &#x27;month&#x27; (&quot;BYRHykʾn&quot;), &quot;šāh&quot; (&quot;MLKA&quot;) &#x27;king&#x27; &gt; &quot;šāhīgān (&quot;šhykʾn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;palace&#x27;.

=====Diminutive suffix=====

The diminutive suffix is &quot;-īzag&quot; (&quot;-yck&#x27;&quot;). E.g. &quot;murw&quot; (&quot;mwlw&quot;) &#x27;bird&#x27; &gt; &quot;murwīzag&quot; (&quot;mwlwyck&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;birdie&#x27;.

It has been conjectured that also the abovementioned suffix &quot;-ag&quot; (&quot;-k&quot;) had the same meaning, but it is difficult to find unambiguous attestations of this usage. Adjectives have their own diminutive suffix, on which see below.

=====Feminine suffix=====

Feminine gender could be expressed in proper names by &quot;-ag&quot;: &quot;J̌am&quot; &gt; &quot;J̌amag&quot;. It could also be expressed by the Avestan suffixes &quot;-ānīy&quot; / &quot;-ēnīy&quot;: &quot;ahlaw&quot; &#x27;righteous&#x27; &gt; &quot;ahlawēnīy&quot; &#x27;righteous woman&#x27;.

====Suffixes that form adjectives====

=====Adjectives derived from nominals=====
# &quot;-īg&quot; (&quot;-yk&#x27;&quot;), sometimes possibly &quot;-īk&quot;: derives adjectives from nouns, often with a meaning &#x27;belonging to&#x27; and &#x27;originating from&#x27;, but also &#x27;having&#x27;: &quot;āb&quot; (&quot;MYA&quot;) &#x27;water&#x27; &gt; &quot;ābīg (&quot;ʾp̄yk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;aquatic&#x27;; &quot;Pārs&quot; (&quot;pʾls&quot;) &#x27;Fars&#x27; &gt; &quot;pārsīg (&quot;pʾlsyk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;Persian&#x27;; &quot;zōr&quot; (&quot;zʾwl&quot;) &#x27;power&#x27; &gt; &quot;zōrīg (&quot;zʾwlyk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;powerful&#x27;; &quot;nazd&quot; (&quot;nzd&quot;) &#x27;vicinity&#x27; &gt; &quot;nazdīk (&quot;nzdyk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;close, near&#x27;;
# When the adjective is derived from a geographical name, the suffix &quot;-īg&quot; is often preceded by &quot;-āy-&quot; (&quot;-ʾd-&quot;): &quot;hrōm&quot; (&quot;hlwm&quot;) &#x27;Rome&#x27; &gt; &quot;hrōmāyīg (&quot;hlwmʾdyk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;Roman&#x27;; &quot;Asūrestān&quot; &#x27;Assyria&#x27; &gt; &quot;asūrāyīg &#x27;Assyrian&#x27;. That suffix &quot;-āy&quot; also occurs alone in the noun &quot;hrōmāy&quot;, &#x27;a Roman&#x27;.
# &quot;-ōmand&quot;, &quot;-mand&quot; (&quot;-ʾwmnd&quot;, -&quot;mnd&quot;): derives adjectives meaning &#x27;having something&#x27;, &#x27;full of something&#x27;: &quot;ōz&quot; (&quot;ʾwc&quot;) &#x27;strength&#x27; &gt; &quot;ōzōmand (&quot;ʾwc ʾwmnd&quot;) &#x27;strong&#x27;; &quot;xwarrah&quot; (&quot;GDE&quot;) &#x27;fortune, glory&#x27; &gt; &quot;xwarrahōmand (&quot;GDE ʾwmnd&quot;) &#x27;fortunate, glorious&#x27;, &quot;šōy&quot; (&quot;šwd&quot;) &#x27;husband &gt; &quot;šōymand&quot; (&quot;šwdmnd&quot;) &#x27;having a husband&#x27;;
# &quot;-(ā)wand&quot; or &quot;-(ā)wend&quot;, spelt &quot;-(ʾwnd)&quot; (in Manichaean also &quot;-ʾwynd&quot;) is a rare, originally older version of the previous suffix and derives adjectives from nouns, often with the same meaning as &quot;-ōmand&quot;, but sometimes expressing a more general connection as in &quot;xwēš&quot; (&quot;NPŠE&quot;) &#x27;own&#x27; &gt; &quot;xwēšāwand&quot; (&quot;hwyšʾwnd&quot;) &#x27;relative&#x27;.
# &quot;-gen&quot; or &quot;-gēn&quot;, spelt &quot;-k(y)n&#x27;&quot;, is a rare suffix similar in function to &quot;-ōmand&quot;.
# &quot;-war&quot; (-&quot;wl&quot;) and &quot;-wār&quot; (-&quot;wʾl&quot;) derive adjectives from nouns, expressing some kind of connection to what the noun designates, and these adjectives may in turn be converted into nouns. E.g. &quot;kēn&quot; (&quot;kyn&quot;) &#x27;revenge&#x27; &gt; &quot;kēnwar (&quot;kynwl&quot;) &#x27;vengeful&#x27;, &quot;asp&quot; (&quot;ŠWŠYA&quot;) &#x27;horse&#x27; &gt; &quot;aswār (&quot;PLŠYA&quot;, &quot;ʾspwʾl&quot;, &quot;aswbʾl&quot;) &#x27;equestrian &gt; horseman&#x27;.
#: According to some descriptions, &quot;-wār&quot; (-&quot;wʾl&quot;) also derives adverbs from adjectives and nouns: &quot;sazagwār (&quot;sckwʾl&quot;) &#x27;fittingly&#x27;, &quot;xwadāywār (&quot;hwtʾdwʾl&quot;) &#x27;in a lordly manner&#x27;.
# &quot;-ēn&quot; (&quot;-yn&#x27;&quot;) is a productive suffix that derives adjectives expressing the material something is made of: &quot;zarr&quot; (&quot;ZHBA&quot;) &#x27;gold&#x27; &gt; &quot;zarrēn&quot; (&quot;ZHBA-yn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;golden&#x27;
# &quot;-ag&quot; (&quot;-k&#x27;&quot;): besides forming nouns, this suffix also derives adjectives from nouns and the past stem of verbs: &quot;tišn&quot; (&quot;tyšn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;thirst&#x27; &gt; &quot;tišnag (&quot;tyšnk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;thirsty&#x27;. Sometimes it is also productively added to an existing adjective with no apparent change of meaning: &quot;wad&quot;, sp. &quot;SLYA&quot; &gt; &quot;wadag, sp. &quot;wtk&#x27;&quot; &#x27;bad, evil&#x27;
# &quot;-ōg&quot; (&quot;-wk&#x27;&quot;) is a rare suffix which, like the previous one, is added to existing adjectives without a noticeable change in meaning, although they may also be converted into nouns.
# &quot;-ān&quot; (&quot;-ʾn&#x27;&quot;) forms possessive adjectives of names and, in particular, patronymics: &quot;ayādgār ī Zarērān (&quot;ʾbydʾt Y zryrʾn&quot;) &#x27;memoir of Zarēr&#x27;; &quot;Ardaxšīr&quot; (&quot;ʾrthšyr&quot;) &gt; &quot;Ardaxšīrān (&quot;ʾrthšyrʾn&quot;) &#x27;son of Ardaxšīr&#x27;; not to be confused with the present participle suffix;
# The suffix &quot;-agān&quot; (&quot;-kʾn&#x27;&quot;) form patronymics as well: &quot;Pābag&quot; (&quot;pʾpk&#x27;&quot;) &gt; &quot;Pābagān&quot; (&quot;pʾpkʾn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;son of Pābag/Pāpak&#x27;;
# As already mentioned, &quot;-gānag&quot; derives adjectives from numerals with the meaning &#x27;-fold&#x27;. 
# The suffix -&quot;ak&quot; (&quot;-k&#x27;&quot;) formed diminutive adjectives: &quot;and&quot; (&quot;ʾnd&quot;) &#x27;so much&#x27; &gt; &quot;andak&quot; (&quot;ʾndk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;a little&#x27;.

=====Suffixes that derive adjectives from verbs=====
# &quot;-āg&quot; (&quot;-ʾk&#x27;&quot;) is a productive suffix that derives adjectives from the present stems of verbs to describe the performer of the action of the verb; these adjectives are often used as nouns and have been described as agent nouns as well. For example, &quot;dānistan&quot; (&quot;YDOYTWNstn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;to know&#x27; &gt; &quot;dānāg&quot; (&quot;dʾnʾk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;a knowing one, a wise man&#x27;.
# &quot;-(a/e)ndag&quot; (&quot;-ndk&#x27;&quot;, &quot;-yndk&#x27;&quot;) is an unproductive suffix that has the same meaning as the above: &quot;zī(wi)stan&quot; &quot;zywstn&#x27;&quot; &#x27;to live&#x27; &gt; &quot;zīndag&quot; &quot;zywndk&#x27;&quot; &#x27;alive, living&#x27;.
# As already mentioned, there is also a present active participle ending in &quot;-ān&quot; (&quot;-ʾn&#x27;&quot;), with the same meaning as the above two. The boundary between participles and derived adjectives is not clear.

====Suffixes that form verbs====

1. The suffix &quot;-ēn-&quot; (&quot;-yn-&quot;) and less commonly &quot;-ān-&quot;, whose past stem always ends in &quot;-īd&quot; &quot;yt&quot;), has the following functions:

– It transforms nominal parts of speech into verbs with factitive meaning: &quot;pērōz&quot; (&quot;pylwc&quot;) &#x27;victorious&#x27; &gt; &quot;pērōzēnīdan&quot; (&quot;pylwcynytn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;to make victorious&#x27;;

– It makes verbs, to whose present stem it is added, into transitive verbs with causative meaning: &quot;tarsīdan&quot; (&quot;tlsytn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;to be afraid&#x27; &gt; &quot;tarsēnīdan&quot; (&quot;tlsynytn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;to scare&#x27;

Apart from that, factitive verbs could be formed simply by creating a new past stem in &quot;-īdan&quot;: &quot;nām&quot; (&quot;ŠM&quot;) &#x27;name&#x27; &gt; &quot;nāmīdan&quot; &#x27;to name&#x27;. More commonly, phrasal verbs were used instead as in &quot;nām kardan&quot;. On the other hand, there still survived some intransitive-transitive verb pairs with quality and quantity differences in the root, where the transitive one usually has the vowel &quot;ā&quot;: intr. &quot;nibastan&quot; (&quot;ŠKBHWNstn&#x27;&quot;), &quot;nibay-&quot; &#x27;to lie down&#x27; – tr. &quot;nibāstan&quot; (&quot;npʾstn&#x27;&quot;), &quot;nibāy-&quot; &#x27;to lay down&#x27;; intr. &quot;nišastan&quot;, &quot;nišīn-&quot; &#x27;to sit (down) – tr. &quot;nišāstan&quot;, &quot;nišān-&quot; &#x27;to seat&#x27; (both spelt with the Armaeogram &quot;YTYBWNstn&#x27;&quot;, but distinguished in the phonetic spellings &quot;nšstn&#x27;&quot; – &quot;nšʾstn&#x27;&quot;).

2. There is also a suffix that forms intransitive verbs from transitive ones. Specifically, it derives present verb stems from transitive past stems in &quot;-ft&quot; and &quot;-xt&quot;, but apparently leaves the two verbs identical in the past stem. In Manichaean, the suffix is &quot;-s&quot; and removes the preceding dental of the past stem: &quot;buxtan&quot; (present stem &quot;bōz-&quot;) &#x27;save&#x27; &gt; present stem &quot;buxs-&quot; &#x27;be saved&#x27;. In Pahlavi, the suffix is &quot;-t-&quot;; in other words, the new present stem coincides with the past one: &quot;bōxtan&quot;, sp. &quot;bwhtn&#x27;&quot;, (present stem &quot;bōz-&quot;) &#x27;save&#x27; &gt; present stem &quot;bōxt-&quot; &#x27;be saved&#x27;

====Prefixes====

=====Nominal prefixes=====

1. &quot;a(n)-&quot;, sp. &quot;ʾ(n)-&quot;, expresses negation or absence of something. Simple negation is found in examples like &quot;purnāy&quot; (&quot;pwlnʾd&quot;) &#x27;adult&#x27; &gt; &quot;aburnāy&quot; (&quot;ʾpwlnʾd&quot;) &#x27;non-adult&#x27;, &quot;dōstīh&quot; (&quot;dwstyh&quot;) &#x27;friendship, amity&#x27; &gt; &quot;adōstīh&quot; (&quot;ʾdwstyh&quot;) &#x27;enmity&#x27;, &quot;ēr&quot; (&quot;ʾyl&quot;) &#x27;Iranian, Zoroastrian&#x27; &gt; &quot;anēr&quot; (&quot;ʾnyl&quot;), &#x27;non-Iranian&#x27;, &#x27;non-Zoroastrian&#x27;.

However, when added to most nouns, the prefix &quot;a(n)-&quot; converts them into adjectives or nouns meaning &#x27;lacking something&#x27;: &quot;kanārag&quot; (&quot;knʾlk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;border&#x27; &gt; &quot;akanārag&quot; (&quot;ʾknʾlk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;borderless&#x27; It can also produce adjectives when added to present verb stems, indicating non-performance of the action: &quot;dānistan&quot; (&quot;YDOYTWNstn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;to know&#x27; &gt; &quot;adān&quot; (&quot;ʾdʾn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;ignorant&#x27;.

2. &quot;abē-&quot;, sp. &quot;ʾp̄y&quot; is added to nouns to form adjectives expressing the lack of something, which also one of the functions of the previous suffix. Hence, they can even occur with the same stems and more or less the same meanings: &quot;bīm&quot; &#x27;fear&#x27; &gt; &quot;abēbīm&quot; (&quot;ʾp̄ypym&quot;) as well as simply &quot;abīm&quot; (&quot;ʾp̄ym&quot;) &#x27;fearless&#x27;.

3. &quot;ham-&quot; (&quot;hm-&quot;) expresses togetherness and sameness. It, too converts nouns into adjectives or nouns meaning &#x27;having / belonging to the same X&#x27;: e.g. &quot;kār&quot; (&quot;kʾl&quot;) &#x27;deed, labour&#x27; &gt; &quot;hamkār&quot; (&quot;hmkʾl&quot;) &#x27;collaborator&#x27;.

4. &quot;ǰud-&quot; (&quot;ywdt-&quot;) has partly the opposite meaning to &quot;ham-&quot;, transforming nouns into adjectives or nouns meaning &#x27;having / belonging to a different/opposite X&#x27;, e.g. &quot;kāmag&quot; (&quot;kʾmk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;desire&#x27; &gt; &quot;ǰudkāmag&quot; (&quot;ywdt&#x27; kʾmk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;disagreeing&#x27;, lit. &#x27;having a different desire&#x27;. However, it can also have the meaning &#x27;keeping X away&#x27;, as in &quot;dēw&quot; (&quot;ŠDYA&quot; &#x27;demon&#x27;) &gt; &quot;ǰud-dēw&quot; (&quot;ywdtŠDYA&quot;) &#x27;keeping the demons away&#x27;, &#x27;anti-demonic&#x27;. Finally, it has a meaning akin to &quot;abē-&quot; in cases like &quot;ǰud-āb&quot; (&quot;ywdt&#x27;MYA&quot;) &#x27;waterless&#x27;. It is also an independent word meaning &#x27;separate&#x27;, &#x27;different&#x27;, so it can be viewed as the first member of a compound as well.

5. &quot;hu-&quot; (&quot;hw-&quot;) can derive nouns from other nouns to express the meaning &#x27;good X&#x27;, e.g. &quot;pādixšāy&quot; (&quot;ŠLYTA&quot;) &#x27;king&#x27; &gt; &quot;hupādixšāy&quot; (&quot;hwpʾthšʾd&quot;) &#x27;good king&#x27;. Far more commonly, however, it forms adjectives and nouns meaning &#x27;having good X&#x27;: e.g. &quot;bōy&quot; (&quot;bwd&quot;) &#x27;smell&#x27; &gt; &quot;hubōy&quot; (&quot;hwbwd&quot;) &#x27;fragrant&#x27;; &quot;sraw&quot; (&quot;slwb&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;word&#x27; &gt; &quot;husraw&quot; (&quot;hwslwb&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;having good fame&#x27;.

6. &quot;duš-&quot; / &quot;dus&quot; / &quot;duǰ-&quot; (sp. &quot;dwš-&quot;, &quot;dw(s)-&quot;), with the second allomorph occurring before /s/ and the third one before voiced stops, has the opposite meaning to the previous prefix: it forms adjectives and nouns meaning &#x27;having bad X&#x27;, or rarely, simply &#x27;bad X&#x27;. For example, &quot;dušpādixšāy&quot; (&quot;dwšpʾthšʾd&quot;) &#x27;bad king&#x27;, &quot;dusraw&quot; (&quot;dwslwb&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;infamous&#x27;, &quot;dēn&quot; (&quot;dyn&#x27;&quot;) &gt; &quot;duǰdēn&quot; (Pahlavi &quot;dwšdyn&#x27;&quot;, Manichaean &quot;dwjdyn&quot;) &#x27;infidel&#x27;

7. Finally, a few adjectives begin in &quot;pad-&quot; (&quot;PWN-&quot;) and meaning &#x27;having&#x27; or &#x27;associated with&#x27;: e.g. &quot;parrag&quot; (&quot;plk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;wing&#x27; &gt; &quot;pad-parrag&quot; (&quot;PWN plk&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;having wings&#x27;; &quot;drō&quot; (&quot;KDBA&quot;, &quot;dlwb&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;a lie&#x27; &gt; &quot;pad-drō&quot; (&quot;PWN dlwb&quot;) &#x27;lying&#x27;.

=====Verbal prefixes=====

Some adverbial particles can co-occur with verbs, but remain separate words; on these, see the section &quot;Preverbs&quot;. Earlier Indo-European verbal prefixes have coalesced with the following roots and their original meaning is hardly ever discernible, even though they are very frequent. Thus, we have the following elements:

# &quot;ā-&quot; expressing approaching something: &quot;burdan&quot; (&quot;YBLWMtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;carry&#x27; &gt; &quot;āwurdan&quot; (&quot;YHYTYWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;bring&#x27;, &quot;āmadan&quot; (&quot;YATWNtn&#x27;&quot;) and &quot;madan&quot; (&quot;mtn&#x27;&quot;), both meaning &#x27;to come&#x27;.
# &quot;ab(e)/ap-&quot; expressing movement away from something: : &quot;burdan&quot; (&quot;YBLWMtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;carry&#x27; &gt; &quot;appurdan&quot; (&quot;YHNCLWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;steal&#x27;
# &quot;fra-&quot; expressing movement forward: &quot;franaftan&quot; (&quot;plnptn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;go (forth), proceed, depart&#x27;.
# &quot;gu-&quot; expressing togetherness: &quot;gumēxtan&quot; (&quot;gwmyhtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;(co-)mix&#x27;.
# &quot;ham-&quot; and &quot;han-&quot; (the latter variant before non-labial consonants), also expressing togetherness or connection, &#x27;with&#x27;. This prefix still occurs with the same form in nouns, but in verbs its meaning is seldom obvious: &quot;bastan&quot; (&quot;ASLWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;bind, tie&#x27; &gt; &quot;hambastan&quot; (&quot;hnbstn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;bind together, encircle, compose&#x27;, but also &quot;hambastan&quot; (&quot;hnbstn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;collapse&#x27;, &quot;hanǰāftan&quot; (&quot;hncʾptn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;complete, conclude&#x27;.
# &quot;ni-&quot; expressing movement downwards: &quot;nišastan&quot; (&quot;YTYBWNstn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;sit (down)&#x27;, &quot;nibastan&quot; (&quot;ŠKBHWNstn&#x27;&quot;), &#x27;lie (down)&#x27;, &quot;nibištan&quot; (&quot;YKTYBWNstn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;write (down)&#x27;
# &quot;ō-&quot; expressing bringing an action to completion: &quot;zadan&quot; (&quot;MHYTWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;hit&#x27; &gt; &quot;ōzadan&quot; (&quot;YKTLWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;kill&#x27;
# &quot;par-&quot; expressing movement &#x27;around&#x27;: &quot;bastan&quot; (&quot;ASLWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;bind, tie&#x27; &gt; &quot;parwastan&quot; (&quot;plwatn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;surround, enclose&#x27;; &quot;pargandan&quot; (&quot;plkndn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;scatter, disperse&#x27;.
# &quot;pay-&quot; expressing direction towards something: &quot;bastan&quot; (&quot;ASLWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;bind, tie&#x27; &gt; &quot;paywastan&quot; (&quot;ptwstn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;join, connect&#x27;
# &quot;us-&quot;, &quot;uz-&quot; expressing direction upwards or outwards: &quot;uzīdan&quot; (&quot;ʾwcytn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;go out, end, expend&#x27;, &quot;uzmūdan&quot; (ʾzmwtn&#x27;) &#x27;try out, experiment&#x27;
# &quot;wi-&quot; expressing movement away or apart from something: &quot;rēxtan&quot; (&quot;lyhtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;flow&#x27; &gt; &quot;wirēxtan&quot; (&quot;OLYKWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;escape, run away&#x27;.

====Compounds====

Compounding is very productive. The following types are common:

1. bahuvrihi or possessive compound, a compound adjective or noun of the structure Modifier + Noun, designating the possessor of what the second member designates:

* &quot;wad-baxt&quot; (&quot;wt&#x27; bʾxt&#x27;&quot;), lit. &#x27;bad&#x27; (&quot;SLYA&quot;) + &#x27;fortune&#x27; = &#x27;who has ill fortune&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;unfortunate&#x27;;

: &quot;pād-uzwān&quot; (&quot;pʾtʾwzwʾn&#x27;&quot;), lit. &#x27;protected&#x27; (&quot;NTLWNt&#x27;&quot;) + &#x27;tongue&#x27; (&quot;ŠNA&quot;) = &#x27;who has protected tongue&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;reticent&#x27;; 
:&quot;čahār-pāy&quot; (&quot;chʾlpʾd&quot;), lit. &#x27;four&#x27; (&quot;ALBA&quot;) + &#x27;leg&#x27; (&quot;LGLE&quot;), &#x27;which has four legs&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;quadruped, animal&#x27;.

The modifier is usually an adjective or another part of speech that typically modifies nouns.

2. A determinative compound noun of the structure Modifier + Noun, designating a subset of the class that the second member designates:

: &quot;kār-nāmag&quot; (&quot;kʾl nʾmk&#x27;&quot;), lit. &#x27;deed&#x27; + &#x27;book&#x27;, a &#x27;book of deeds&#x27;, i.e. a biography. The modifier is usually a noun, less cderived/ borrowed words from Middle Persian

commonly an adjective as in &quot;weh-dēn&quot; (&quot;ŠPYLdyn&#x27;&quot;), lit. &#x27;good&#x27; + &#x27;religion&#x27; = &#x27;Zoroastrianism&#x27;.

3. A determinative compound adjective or noun of the structure Modifier + Deverbal Noun or Participle:

: &quot;anāg-kerdār&quot; (&quot;ʾnʾk&#x27; kltʾl&quot;), lit. &#x27;evil&#x27; + &#x27;doer&#x27; = &#x27;evildoer&#x27;;
:&quot;Ōhrmazd-dād&quot; (&quot;ʾwhrmzd dʾt&quot;), lit. &#x27;Ahuramazda&#x27; + &#x27;given&#x27; (&quot;YHBWNt&#x27;&quot;) = &#x27;given, created by Ahuramazda&#x27;.

4. A determinative compound adjective or noun of the structure Modifier + Present Verb Stem. The meaning is of an agent noun:

: &quot;axtar&quot; (&quot;ʾhtl&quot;) &#x27;star&#x27;, &quot;āmārdan&quot; (&quot;ʾmʾldn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;calculate&#x27; &gt; &quot;axtar-(ā)mār&quot;, lit. &#x27;star&#x27; + &#x27;calculate&#x27; = &#x27;astrologer&#x27;

An uncommon type is the copulative (dvandva) type that combines two stems on equal terms – some possible examples are:

: &quot;rōz-šabān&quot; (&quot;lwc špʾn&quot;), lit. &#x27;day&#x27; (&quot;YWM&quot;) + &#x27;night&#x27; (&quot;LYLYA&quot;) + &quot;-ān&quot; = &#x27;a 24-hour period&#x27;; and
:&quot;uštar-gāw-palang&quot; (&quot;wštlgʾwp̄plng&quot;), lit. &#x27;camel&#x27; (&quot;GMRA&quot;) + &#x27;ox&#x27; (&quot;TWRA&quot;) + &#x27;leopard&#x27; (&quot;płng&quot;).

===Numerals===

The numeral system is decimal. The numerals usually don&#x27;t inflect, but may take the plural ending when preceding the noun they modify, e.g. Manichaean &quot;sēnān anōšagān&quot; &#x27;the three immortals&#x27;. The numerals are usually spelt in Pahlavi as digits, but there are also Aramaeograms for the cardinals from 1 to 10.

====Cardinal numerals====

The cardinal ones from one to ten are:

The teens are mostly formed by combining the relevant number of units and the word &quot;dah&quot; &#x27;ten&#x27;, but there are some voicings, epentheses of , elisions and unpredictable alternations at the morpheme boundaries.

The tens often bear some resemblance to the correspondent units and sometimes end in -&quot;ād&quot; or -&quot;ad&quot;, but often aren&#x27;t synchronically analysable:
The hundreds combine the relevant unit and the word &quot;sad&quot; &#x27;hundred&#x27; (e.g. &quot;hašt sad&quot; for 800), except for 200, which is &quot;duwēst&quot;. One thousand is &quot;hazār&quot;, and multiples of it are formed again on the pattern &quot;hašt hazār&quot; and so on, but there is also a special numeral for 10 000, &quot;bēwar&quot; (spelt &quot;bywl&quot;). Compound numerals may be formed with or without the conjunction &quot;ud&quot; &#x27;and&#x27;: &quot;čihl ud čahār&quot; or &quot;čihl čahār&quot;.

Fractions simply conjoin the cardinal numerals of the denominator and the numerator: &quot;sē-yak (ī ...)&quot; &#x27;one third (of ...)&#x27;, and may also take the &#x27;indefinite article&#x27; &quot;-ēw&quot;. Another notable derivation is the one in &quot;-gānag&quot; meaning &#x27;-fold&#x27;, e.g. &quot;sēgānag&quot; (&quot;3-kʾnk&quot;) &#x27;triple&#x27;.

Cardinal numerals may precede or follow the noun; the noun is usually in the singular, but may be in the plural, too.

====Ordinal numerals====

Ordinal numerals are formed regularly by adding the ending &quot;-om&quot; (sp. &quot;-wm&quot;) to the corresponding cardinal numeral: e.g. &quot;haft-om&quot; (&quot;7-wm&quot;) &#x27;seven-th&#x27;. After vowels, a semivowel is inserted before &quot;-om&quot;: &quot;-y-&quot; after the front vowels &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot;, and &quot;-w-&quot; after the back vowel &quot;o&quot;: thus, 3rd can be &quot;sē-y-om&quot;, 30th is &quot;sī-y-om&quot;, 2nd is &quot;dō-w-om&quot;.

While this regular pattern can be applied even to the first three numerals, they also have more common irregular variants: &quot;fradom&quot; (&quot;pltwm&quot;) &#x27;first&#x27;, &quot;dudīgar&quot; or &quot;didīgar&quot; (&quot;dtykl&quot;) &#x27;second&#x27;, &quot;sidīgar&quot; (&quot;stykl&quot;) &#x27;third&#x27;. The final &quot;ar&quot; may be absent in Manichaean texts: &quot;dudīg&quot; (&quot;dwdyg&quot;) and &quot;sidīg&quot; (&quot;sdyg&quot;). Furthermore, &#x27;first&#x27; may also occur as &quot;naxust&quot; (&quot;nhwst&#x27;&quot;) and &quot;nazdist&quot; (&quot;nzdst&quot;&#x27;) and &#x27;second&#x27; may also occur as &quot;did&quot; (&quot;TWB&quot;, &quot;dt&#x27;&quot;), which also means &#x27;another&#x27;, and &quot;didom&quot;. &#x27;Fourth&#x27; can also be &quot;tasom&quot; (&quot;tswm&quot;).

Like the cardinal numbers, the ordinal ones can occur before or after the noun, and in the latter case, they may be linked to it by the relative particle &quot;ī&quot;.

===Syntax===

The usual word order is subject – object – verb, although there are deviations from it. As already mentioned, genitive and adjective modifiers usually precede their heads if unmarked as such, but adjectives can also be placed after their heads, and a modifier introduced by the relative particle &quot;ī&quot; is placed after its head, unless appended to a demonstrative pronoun modifying the phrase head (pronoun + &quot;ī&quot; + modifier + head). The language uses prepositions, but they may end up as postpositions if their logical complements are enclitic pronouns or relative pronouns. The enclitic pronouns are normally appended to the first word of the clause. Yes/no questions are only distinguished from statements by means of intonation. Wh-questions do not need to be introduced by the interrogative word either: &quot;war ... kū kard ēstēd?&quot; (&quot;wl ... AYK krt&#x27; YKOYMWNyt&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;Where has the shelter been made?&#x27;

Certain verbs are used impersonally: the logical subject is absent or oblique, and the action is expressed by an infinitive or a dependent clause with a verb in the subjunctive. Thus the present tense of &quot;abāyistan&quot; &#x27;be necessary, fitting&#x27; is used as follows: &quot;abāyēd raftan&quot; (&quot;ʾp̄ʾdt&#x27; SGYTWNtn&#x27;&quot; ), &#x27;it is necessary to go&#x27;. Other verbs used like this, obligatorily or optionally, are &quot;sahistan&quot; (&quot;MDMENstn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;seem&#x27;, &quot;saz-&quot; (&quot;sc&quot;) &#x27;be proper&#x27; (present tense only), &quot;šāyistan&quot; (&quot;šʾdstn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;be possible&#x27;, &quot;kāmistan&quot; (&quot;YCBENstn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;want&#x27; (constructed like &#x27;be desirable to s.o.&#x27;) and &quot;wurrōyistan&quot; (&quot;HYMNN-stn&quot;&#x27;) &#x27;believe&#x27; (constructed like &#x27;seem credible to s.o.&#x27;). So are some nouns such as &quot;tuwān&quot; &#x27;might, power&#x27;: &quot;tuwān raftan&quot; (&quot;twbʾn&#x27; SGYTWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;one can go&#x27;.

There are many phrasal verbs consisting of a nominal part of speech and a relatively abstract verb, most commonly &quot;kardan&quot; (&quot;OBYDWNtn&#x27;&quot; / &quot;krtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;do&#x27;, sometimes also &quot;dādan&quot; (&quot;YHBWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;to give&#x27;, &quot;burdan&quot; (&quot;YBLWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;to bear&#x27;, &quot;zadan&quot; (&quot;MHYTWNtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;to hit&#x27;, etc. Some examples are &quot;duz kardan&quot; (&quot;dwc krtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;to steal&#x27;, lit. &#x27;to do a theft&#x27;, &quot;framān dādan&quot; (&quot;plmʾn&#x27; YHBWNtn&#x27;&quot;), &#x27;to command&#x27;, lit. &#x27;to give a command&#x27;, &quot;āgāh kardan&quot; (&quot;ʾkʾs krtn&#x27;&quot;) &#x27;inform&#x27;, lit. &#x27;make informed&#x27;.

The plural number was used in reference to kings, both in the first person (by the kings themselves), in the second person (when addressing a king) and in the third person (when referring to kings, e.g. &quot;awēšān bayān&quot;, sp. &quot;OLEšʾn&#x27; ORHYAʾn&quot;, &#x27;Their Majesty&#x27;, originally only the oblique case form). An action performed by a superior was introduced by the dummy verb &quot;framūdan&quot; &#x27;order&#x27; governing an infinitive of the main verb: &quot;framāyē xwardan!&quot; (&quot;prmʾdyd OŠTENʾn&quot;) &#x27;deign eat!&#x27;.

===Lexis===

In contrast to the numerous Arameograms in Pahlavi spelling, there aren&#x27;t many actual borrowings from Aramaic in Middle Persian; indeed, the number of borrowings in the language in general is remarkably small. An exception is the Middle Persian Psalter, which is a relatively literal translation of the Peshitta and does contain a sizable number of theology-related loans from Syriac: e.g. &quot;purkānā&quot; &#x27;redemption&#x27;.

Pahlavi often has more forms borrowed from Parthian than Manichaean does: e.g. Pahlavi &quot;zamestān&quot; (&quot;zmstʾn&#x27;&quot;) vs Manichaean &quot;damestān&quot; (&quot;dmstʾn&quot;) &#x27;winter&#x27;. Naturally, theological terms borrowed from Avestan occur in Zoroastrian Pahlavi, sometimes even in the original script, but often in &#x27;Pahlavised&#x27; form or as loan translations:

===Affixes===
There are a number of affixes in Middle Persian:

===Location suffixes===

===Comparison of Middle Persian and Modern Persian vocabulary===

There are some phonological differences between Middle Persian and New Persian. Initial consonant clusters were very common in Middle Persian (e.g. spās &quot;thanks&quot;). However, New Persian does not allow initial consonant clusters, whereas final consonant clusters are common (e.g. asb &quot;horse&quot;).

1 Since some vowels of Middle Persian did not continue in Modern Persian, a number of homophones were created in New Persian. For example, &quot;šir&quot; and &quot;šer&quot;, meaning &quot;milk&quot; and &quot;lion&quot;, respectively, are now both pronounced &quot;šir&quot;. In this case, the older pronunciation is maintained in Kurdish, Dari and Tajiki Persian.

===Middle Persian cognates in other languages===

There is a number of Persian loanwords in English, many of which can be traced to Middle Persian. The lexicon of Classical Arabic also contains many borrowings from Middle Persian. In such borrowings Iranian consonants that sound foreign to Arabic, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;č&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;ž&quot;, have been replaced by &quot;q/k&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;š&quot;, &quot;f/b&quot;, and &quot;s/z&quot;. The exact Arabic renderings of the suffixes &quot;-ik/-ig&quot; and &quot;-ak/-ag&quot; is often used to deduce the different periods of borrowing. The following is a parallel word list of cognates:

<doc id="889890" wikidata="Q260335" url="?curid=889890" title="Endophyte">
<text>An endophyte is an endosymbiont, often a bacterium or fungus, that lives within a plant for at least part of its life cycle without causing apparent disease. Endophytes are ubiquitous and have been found in all species of plants studied to date; however, most of the endophyte/plant relationships are not well understood. Some endophytes may enhance host growth and nutrient acquisition and improve the plant&#x27;s ability to tolerate abiotic stresses, such as drought, and decrease biotic stresses by enhancing plant resistance to insects, pathogens and herbivores. Although endophytic bacteria and fungi are frequently studied, endophytic archaea are increasingly being considered for their role in plant growth promotion as part of the core microbiome of a plant. 

== History ==
Endophytes were first described by the German botanist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link in 1809. They were thought to be plant parasitic fungi and they were later termed as &quot;microzymas&quot; by the French scientist Béchamp. There was a belief that plants were healthy under sterile conditions and it was not until 1887 that Victor Galippe discovered bacteria normally occurring inside plant tissues. Though, most of the endophytic studies reports the mutualistic relationship of bacteria and fungus, Das et al., (2019) reported about endophytic virome and their probable function in plant defense mechanisms.

== Transmission ==
Endophytes may be transmitted either vertically (directly from parent to offspring) or horizontally (among individuals). Vertically transmitted fungal endophytes are typically considered clonal and transmit via fungal hyphae penetrating the embryo within the host&#x27;s seeds, while reproduction of the fungi through asexual conidia or sexual spores leads to horizontal transmission, where endophytes may spread between plants in a population or community.

== Symbiosis ==
Most endophyte-plant relationships are still not well understood. However, recently it was shown that endophytes are transmitted from one generation to another via seeds, in a process called vertical transmission. Endophytes and plants often engage in mutualism, with endophytes primarily aiding in the health and survival of the host plant with issues such as pathogens and disease, water stress, heat stress, nutrient availability and poor soil quality, salinity, and herbivory. In exchange the endophyte receives carbon for energy from the plant host. Plant-microbe interactions are not strictly mutualistic, as endophytic fungi can potentially become pathogens or saprotrophs, usually when the plant is stressed. Endophytes may become active and reproduce under specific environmental conditions or when their host plants are stressed or begin to senesce, thereby limiting the amount of carbon provided to the endophyte.

Endophytes may benefit host plants by preventing other pathogenic or parasitic organisms from colonizing them. Endophytes can extensively colonize plant tissues and competitively exclude other potential pathogens. Some fungal and bacterial endophytes have proven to increase plant growth and improve overall plant hardiness.

Studies have shown that endophytic fungi grow in a very intimate interaction with their host plant cells. Fungal hyphae have been seen growing either flattened or wedged against plant cells. This growth pattern indicates that fungal hyphae are substantially attached to the plant host&#x27;s cell wall, but do not invade plant cells. Endophytic fungal hyphae appear to grow at the same rate as their host leaves, within the intercellular spaces of the plant tissue.

The presence of certain fungal endophytes in host meristems, leaves and reproductive structures has been shown to dramatically enhance the survival of their hosts. This enhanced survivability is largely attributed to endophytic production of secondary metabolites which protect against herbivory as well as increased uptake of nutrients. Studies have also shown that during experimental circumstances endophytes contribute significantly to plant growth and fitness under light-limited conditions, and plants appear to have increased reliance on their endophytic symbiont under these conditions.

There is evidence that plants and endophytes engage in communication with each other that can aid symbiosis. For example, plant chemical signals have been shown to activate gene expression in endophytes. One example of this plant-endosymbiont interaction occurs between dicotyledonous plants in the Convolvulaceae and clavicipitaceous fungi. When the fungus is in the plant it synthesizes ergoline alkaloids at a higher rate, compared to when it is grown apart from the plant. This supports the hypothesis that plant signaling is required in order to induce expression of endophytic secondary metabolites.

=== Effects on plant behavior ===
There are various behaviors that have been studied that resulted from endophyte symbiosis with plants. Through association with fungal endophytes, the root and shoot structures of &quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; (Douglas-fir) saplings in low-nutrient conditions have been shown to be elongated, as well as undergo overall biomass increases. The proposed mechanisms behind this include high inorganic phosphate solubilization ability by the fungi as well as organic phosphate mineralization, increased mycorrhizal associations through root colonization, and enhanced nitrogen and phosphorus uptake. Specific endophyte species can also stimulate root growth by increasing the flux of auxin to where the endophyte is.

Additionally, various reports on endophyte interactions have shown increased photosynthetic capacities of host plants as well as improved water relations. Improvements in water use efficiency were observed in higher concentrations and a further increase was seen in water deficit conditions. In addition, other various physiological pathways were activated upon endophytes interactions with host plants, enabling tighter water control and further water management, which are to be the main reasons behind improved water relations. Specifically, evidence points to endophytes producing ABA to affect stomatal conductance as well as microbial respiration and plants recycling .

However, the specific biochemical mechanisms behind these behavioral changes are still largely unknown and lower-level signal cascades have yet to be discovered. Furthermore, while the benefits of endophyte relations are well-studied, the costs of these relations are less well understood, such as the specific carbon costs, the system of endophyte governance, and the environmental conditions that facilitate a proper plant-endophyte relationship.

In an experiment investigating the interaction between &quot;Miscanthus sinensis&quot; and the plant endophyte &quot;Herbaspirillum frisingense&quot;, a roughly 20% increase in fresh biomass was observed in &quot;M. sinensis&quot; following inoculation with &quot;H. frisingense&quot;. However, unique to this experiment was the mode by which this was thought to happen. Inoculation saw an upregulation in the genes relevant to jasmonate and ethylene production in the plant roots, although the mechanism to this is still unknown. Specifically, &quot;H. frisingense&quot; was shown to upregulate ethylene receptors and repress ethylene response factors, overall leading to an increase in root growth. Additionally, &quot;H. frisingense&quot; is known to produce indoleacetic acid (IAA), and was also shown to manage IAA genes, indicating that there is an intricate balance maintained between ethylene and IAA by &quot;H. frisingense&quot;.

== Diversity ==
Endophytic species are very diverse; only a small minority of existing endophytes have been characterized. Many endophytes are in the phyla Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. Endophytic fungi may be from Hypocreales and Xylariales of the Sordariomycetes (Pyrenomycetes) class or from the class of Loculoascomycetes. One group of fungal endophytes are the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi involving biotrophic Glomeromycota associated with various plant species. As often with other organisms associated with plants such as mycorrhizal fungus, endophytes gain carbon from their association with the plant host. Bacterial endophytes are polyphyletic, belonging to broad range of taxa, including α-Proteobacteria, β-Proteobacteria, γ-Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria.

One or more endophytic organisms are found in nearly every land plant. It is suggested that areas of high plant diversity such as tropical rainforests may also contain the highest diversity of endophytic organisms that possess novel and diverse chemical metabolites. It has been estimated that there could be approximately 1 million endophytic fungi that exist in the world.

A diazotrophic bacterium isolated in lodgepole pines (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot;) in British Columbia, Canada, is &quot;Paenibacillus polymyxa&quot;, which may help its host by fixing nitrogen.

== Classification ==
Endophytes include a wide variety of microorganisms including fungi, bacteria and viruses. There are two different means of classifying endophytes.

=== Systemic and non-systemic ===

The first method divides endophytes into two categories: systemic (true) and nonsystemic (transient). These categories are based on the endophyte&#x27;s genetics, biology, and mechanism of transmission from host to host. Systemic endophytes are defined as organisms that live within plant tissues for the entirety of its life cycle and participate in a symbiotic relationship without causing disease or harm to the plant at any point. Additionally, systemic endophytes concentrations and diversity do not change in a host with changing environmental conditions. Non-systemic or transient endophytes on the other hand vary in number and diversity within their plant hosts under changing environmental conditions. Non-systemic endophytes have also been shown to become pathogenic to their host plants under stressful or resource limited growing conditions. An example of this would be &quot;Colletotrichum fioriniae&quot;, which is an endophyte of many temperate broadleaved trees and shrubs, but can also be a pathogen on many fruits and some leaves.

=== Clavicipitaceous and non-clavicipitaceous ===

The second method divides fungal endophytes into four groups based on taxonomy and six other criteria: host range, host tissues colonized, &quot;in planta&quot; colonization, &quot;in planta&quot; biodiversity, mode of transmission and fitness benefits. These four groups are divided into clavicipitaceous endophytes (Class 1) and non-clavicipitaceous endophytes (Class 2, 3, and 4).

Class 1 endophytes are all phylogenetically related and proliferate within cool and warm season grasses. They typically colonize plant shoots where they form a systemic intercellular infection. Class 1 endophytes are mainly transmitted from host to host by vertical transmission, in which maternal plants pass fungi on to their offspring through seeds. Class 1 endophytes can further be divided into Types I, II and III. Among these three types of clavicipitaceous endophytes are different interactions with their plant hosts. These interaction range from pathogenic to symbiotic and symptomatic to asymptomatic. Type III clavicipitaceous endophytes grow within their plant host without manifesting symptoms of disease or harming their host. Class 1 endophytes typically confer benefits on their plant host such as improving plant biomass, increasing drought tolerance and increasing the production of chemicals that are toxic and unappetizing to animals, thereby decreasing herbivory. These benefits can vary depending on the host and environmental conditions.

Non-clavicipitaceous endophytes represent a polyphyletic group of organisms. Non-clavicipitaceous endophytes are typically Ascomycota fungi. The ecological roles of these fungi are diverse and still poorly understood. These endophyte plant interactions are widespread and have been found in nearly all land plants and ecosystems. Many non-clavicipitaceous endophytes have the ability to switch between endophytic behavior and free-living lifestyles. Non-clavicipitaceous endophytes are divided into class 2, 3 and 4. Class 2 endophytes can grow in plant tissues both above and below ground. This class of non-clavicipitaceous endophytes has been the most extensively researched and has been shown to enhance fitness benefits of their plant host as a result of habitat-specific stresses such as pH, temperature and salinity. Class 3 endophytes are restricted to growth in above ground plant tissues and form in localized areas of plant tissue. Class 4 endophytes are restricted to plant tissues below ground and can colonize much more of the plant tissue. These classes of non-clavicipitaceous endophytes have not been as extensively studied to date.

==Applications ==
Endophytes may have potential future applications in agriculture. Use of endophytes might potentially increase crop yields. Turfgrass seed of &quot;Festuca&quot; and &quot;Lolium perenne&quot; infected with fungal inoculants, &quot;Acremonium coenophialum&quot; and &quot;A. lolii&quot;, is commercially available for use in growing lawns which might require less pesticide use -the grasses are poisonous to cattle and more resistant to some insect damage. As of 1999 this is only available in the afore-mentioned lawn grasses, which are sold as &#x27;low maintenance&#x27; cultivars. The fungi cause the grasses to contain toxic alkaloids. The products provide high resistance to foliar lawn pests such as billbugs, chinch bugs, sod webworms, fall army-worms and Argentine stem weevils, but offer little protection to pests of grass roots such as grubs. The endophytes can survive most pesticides and are even resistant to some fungicides, and are very suitable for use in Integrated Pest Management.

===Biofuel===
A 2008 experiment with an isolate of a fungus called NRRL 50072 found that this strain can produce a small amount of fuel-like hydrocarbon compounds which was promoted as &quot;myco-diesel&quot;. It was hoped that perhaps in the future this might provide a possible source of biofuel. It was first misidentified as the endophyte &quot;Gliocladium roseum&quot;, but later research showed that it was in fact the saprophyte &quot;Ascocoryne sarcoides&quot;.

A strain of endophytic fungi which appeared to be closely related to &quot;Nigrograna mackinnonii&quot; which was isolated from a stem of the plant &quot;Guazuma ulmifolia&quot; collected in Ecuador was found to produce a variety of volatile organic compounds including terpenes and odd chain polyenes. The polyenes isolated from the fungus have properties that are sought in gasoline-surrogate biofuels.

===Phytoremediation===
Phytoremediation is an environmentally sustainable process where plants potentially able to break down or sequester, or stimulate micro-organisms in the soil to break down or sequester, certain organic pollutants and inorganic pollutants such as nickel in degraded ecosystems. In this endophytes may possibly assist plants in converting pollutants into less biologically harmful forms; in one of the few experiments performed a plasmid called TOM from a strain of a bacterium in the &quot;Burkholderia&quot; genus known as G4 which can break down trichloroethylene (TCE) was transferred to endophytes of popular trees; although it did not help the plants remove more of this chemical than non-inoculated plants, the plants transpired less TCE into the air. In another experiment &quot;Burkholderia&quot; bacteria with both the TOM plasmid as well as nickel resistance genes was inoculated into yellow lupine; this increased the root mass of the plants, but the amounts of TCE transpired was not statistically significant. Despite these failures, such techniques might lead to some future improvements.

Two strains of the endophytic fungi &quot;Pestalotiopsis microspora&quot; isolated from stems of plants from the Ecuadorian rainforest were shown in laboratory experiments to be able to digest polyurethane plastic as the fungus&#x27;s sole carbon source in anaerobic conditions, although many other non-endophytic fungi have demonstrated this ability, and most isolates of endophytic fungi in this experiment could perform this to some degree.

===Drug discovery===
Endophytes produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites that might be useful as lead compounds in drug discovery. Endophyte bioprospecting has already yielded compounds with antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, cytotoxic, neuroprotective, antioxidant, insulin-mimetic, α-glucosidase inhibitory, and immunosuppressant properties. Manipulations of a plant&#x27;s endosymbiots can affect plant development, growth and ultimately the quality and quantity of compounds harvested from the plant. Studies have shown endophytic fungi are able to produce secondary metabolites previously thought to be manufactured by their plant hosts. The presence of these metabolites in plants could be attributable to endophyte production alone, or to combined endophyte and plant production following transfer of the corresponding genes from endophyte to plant or vice versa.

A well known example of the discovery of chemicals derived from endophytic fungi is from the fungus &quot;Taxomyces andreanae&quot; isolated from the pacific yew &quot;Taxus brevifolia&quot;. &quot;T. andreanae&quot; produces paclitaxel, also known as taxol. This drug is important for the treatment of cancer. Other endophytes since have been discovered that also produce paclitaxel in other host species, but to date there has been no successful industrial source of paclitaxel created.

Endophytes have been discovered with various anti-tumor properties. Endophytic fungi produce many secondary compounds such as alkaloids, triterpenes and steroids which have been shown to have anti-tumor effects. The alkaloid beauvericin has been isolated from the fungus &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; and has shown cytotoxicity against the tumor cells PC3, PANC-1, and A549. Two fusarubin derivatives: anhydrofusarubin and methyl ether of fusarubin were isolated from endophytic fungus &quot;Cladosporium sp.&quot; and have shown cytotoxicity against human leukemia (K-562). Three triterpenes were found in the endophyte Xylarialean sp., all three of these compounds displayed mild cytotoxic effects on tumor cells.

Some of the antimicrobial compounds produced by endophytic fungi are of interest in their effectiveness against pathogens which have developed resistances to antibiotics. Different fractions of &quot;Cladosporium sp.&quot; including secondary metabolite-methyl ether of fusarubin have shown antibacterial activity against &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;E. coli&quot;, &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot;, and &quot;Bacillus megaterium&quot;. Several isolates from the ascomycota &quot;Pestalotiopsis&quot; sp. have been shown to have a broad range of antimicrobial effects, even against methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. Also, compounds from the marine fungus &quot;Nigrospora&quot; sp. have activity against strains of multi drug-resistant &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;.

An endophytic fungus of the genus &quot;Pseudomassaria&quot; has been found in the rainforest of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This fungus yields a metabolite that shows potential as an antidiabetic, also known as an insulin mimetic. This compound acts like insulin and has been shown to lower blood glucose levels in mouse model experiments.

=== Agriculture===
Among the many promising applications of endophytic microbes are those intended to increase agricultural use of endophytes to produce crops that grow faster and are more resistant and hardier than crops lacking endophytes. &quot;Epichloë&quot; endophytes are being widely used commercially in turf grasses to enhance the performance of the turf and its resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. &quot;Piriformospora indica&quot; is an interesting endophytic fungus of the order Sebacinales, the fungus is capable of colonising roots and forming symbiotic relationship with many plants.

Endophytes appear to enhance the growth of their plant host symbionts. Endophytes also provide their hosts with an increased resilience to both abiotic and biotic stressors such as drought, poor soils and herbivory. The increased growth and resilience is likely caused by the endophytes ability to improve plant nutrition or secondary metabolite production, as in the case of &quot;Phoma eupatorii&quot;″s inhibition of the phytopathogen &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot;. Endophytes accomplish this by increasing the uptake of valuable land limited nutrients from the soil such as phosphorus and making other plant nutrients available to plants such as rock phosphate and atmospheric nitrogen which are normally trapped in forms that are inaccessible to plants.

Many endophytes protect plants from herbivory from both insects and animals by producing secondary metabolites that are either unappetizing or toxic to the herbivore. Increasingly there has been great importance placed on endophytes that protect valuable crops from invasive insects. One example of an endophyte-plant-insect interaction is located in the New Zealand grasslands, where endophytes, known as AR1 and AR37 are utilized to protect valuable ryegrass from the Argentine stem weevil but remain palatable to another important food source, livestock.

There are several endophytes that have been discovered that exhibit insecticidal properties. One such endophyte comes from the &quot;Nodulisporium sp&quot;. which was first harvested from the plant &quot;Bontia daphnoides&quot;. Indole diterpenes, known as nodulisporic acids, have been harvested from this endophyte which have effective insecticidal properties against the blowfly larvae.

There are many obstacles to successfully implementing the use of endophytes in agriculture. Despite the many known benefits that endophytes may confer to their plant hosts, conventional agricultural practices continue to take priority. Current agriculture relies heavily on fungicides and high levels of chemical fertilizers. The use of fungicides has a negative effect on endophytic fungi and fertilizers reduce a plant&#x27;s dependence on its endophytic symbiont. Despite this, the interest and use of bio-insecticides and using endophytes to aid in plant growth is increasing as organic and sustainable agriculture is considered more important. As humans become more aware of the damage that synthetic insecticides cause to the environment and beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies biological insecticides may become more important to the agricultural industry.

<text>Jean Mermoz (9 December 1901 – 7 December 1936) was a French aviator, viewed as a hero by other pilots such as Saint-Exupéry, and in his native France, where many schools bear his name. In Brazil, he also is recognized as a pioneer aviator.

==Career==
In 1920 he met Max Delby, a teacher who helped him develop his career, and in April 1921 he flew as a pilot for the first time.

===French Air Force===
Mermoz joined the French Air Force in 1922, being assigned, as a pilot of the air force&#x27;s 11th regiment, to duty in Syria. In 1924, he returned to France, having arguably been one of the most successful pilots in the Syrian operations. Mermoz relocated to Toulouse.

===Latécoère===
Mermoz went on to become an airmail pilot, with Latécoère&#x27;s company, and almost failed his entry exam by performing dangerous stunts to impress the director. (The director, Didier Daurat had this famous quote: &quot;We don&#x27;t need acrobats here, we need bus drivers.&quot;) He then did a normal, flawless flight and was hired. It was there that Mermoz met Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. At the Compagnie Générale Aéropostale, Mermoz travelled to Morocco, Senegal and other African areas.

In 1926, one of Mermoz&#x27;s flights ended with an accident, when his plane crashed in the Sahara. He was then taken hostage by a group of rebel Tuaregs, but was fortunately found later alive.
In 1927, Latécoère began building his own brand of planes to replace the aging World War I aircraft Breguet 14. The Latécoère 25, (or &quot;Laté 25&quot;) and, later, the Latécoère 26 and Latécoère 28 proved to be efficient aircraft when flying from Morocco to Senegal, and Mermoz himself flew the types on those routes on multiple occasions.

But Africa was only the beginning. Latécoère&#x27;s project was to create a direct airline between France and South America. By 1929, it had become evident that it would be economically viable for France to establish a commercial air route to South America, so Mermoz and others flew over the Andes. Despite Mermoz finding the flying conditions over the Andes to be tough, he became the project&#x27;s main pilot, determined to reach the Pacific Ocean, and he was able, after multiple stops, to reach Santiago, Chile. During that time, to save time, he decided to fly during the night, using light beacons and flares as guides; and his fellow pilots, for once, were a bit reluctant to see him do it, because they knew it would be their turn next.
For some time, as transatlantic flights were not yet possible, steamboats linked both halves of the &quot;Line&quot;.
With a flight from Saint-Louis, Senegal, to Natal, Brazil, on 12–13 May 1930, the line was complete at last. the modified Laté 28 &quot;Comte-de-la-Vaulx&quot;, however, did not prove reliable, and the pilot had to ditch at sea during the return flight. Mermoz, his two companions and the mail were rescued, but the plane sank during the attempt to tow it.

===Air France===
In 1933, Mermoz was appointed general inspector by Air France. That same year, he arrived in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he and Saint-Exupéry became important persons during the infancy of Aeroposta Argentina, which would later become Aerolíneas Argentinas. Mermoz and Saint-Exupéry flew many dangerous flights for the then new air company. They became regarded as two of the most important men in the history of Argentine commercial aviation. From 1934 to 1936, Mermoz would fly private expeditions on Latécoère 300 airplanes. He flew 24 expeditions with that type. In 1935, he also flew de Havilland DH.88 &quot;Comet&quot; airplanes.

==Disappearance at sea==
On 7 December 1936, on a planned flight from Dakar to Natal, Brazil, he turned back shortly after take-off to report a troublesome engine on his Latécoère 300 &quot;Croix-du-Sud&quot; (&quot;Southern Cross&quot;). After learning that he would have to wait for another one to be prepared, he took off again in the same plane after a quick repair, concerned that he would be late in delivering the mail. (His last words before boarding the plane were &quot;Quick, let&#x27;s not waste time anymore.&quot;)

Four hours later, the radio station received a short message, where Mermoz reported that he had to cut the power on the aft starboard engine. The message was interrupted abruptly. No further messages were received, and neither the Laté 300 nor the crew were ever recovered.

It is assumed that the engine they had tried to repair lost its propeller midflight, and being one of the aft engines, the loose propeller either badly damaged or cut the hull entirely, causing the plane to lose its tail and crash instantly. Henri Guillaumet, one of Mermoz&#x27;s fellow pilots, had encountered the same problem a few months before, but as his own engine was on the forward side, airspeed had been sufficient to maintain the propeller in place until the landing.

== Sabotage of the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; ==
In 1941, the Investigative Commission of Anti-National Activities of the Parliament of Uruguay, after denunciations filed before the Deputy Tomas Brena and Julio Iturbide, arrives at the surprising conclusion of the last two airmail flights of Air France, and with result the death of Collenot first and Mermoz later, they were the result of sabotage of the Nazi Fifth Column (National German Socialist Workers Party operating in Uruguay). The air mail bags transported the technical and economic proposals for the bidding of the so-called Obra del Río Negro in Uruguay, the international tender carried out in three calls in 1936, for the construction of the Rincón del Bonete hydroelectric plant. The tender only receives Offers or proposals from the Siemens Bauunion and Philipp Holzmann AG consortium in Germany, and SKODA WORKS from Czechoslovakia. This and other tricks, such as false news and bribes, were used by Nazi Germany, to get rid of the other proposals under way, and force the bidding to be declared void.

The crew of Latécoère 300 &quot;Croix-du-Sud&quot;, F-AKGF, on that day were:
*Jean Mermoz, Pilot
*Alexandre Pichodou, Copilot
*Henri Ezan, Navigator
*Edgar Cruveilher, Radio Officer
*Jean Lavidalie, Mechanic

===An unreliable plane===
Mermoz had grown dissatisfied with the quality of the planes he and his companions had to pilot. In the months before his demise, he had been vocal about the aircraft&#x27;s poor quality in both design and material, and was quoted saying &quot;Ask me to pilot anything, even a wheelbarrow, but at one condition: make sure it is &quot;solid&quot;&quot;. A similar plane, Laté 301 F-AOIK &quot;Ville-de-Buenos-Aires&quot;, had disappeared eight months before his own, causing the death, among others, of his mechanic and friend Collenot. The complicated Hispano-Suiza 12Ner engines thought to be the cause of both crashes were later decommissioned and replaced with older, more reliable ones. His message had been heard too late.

In 1956 writer Jean-Michel Charlier in conjunction with artist Victor Hubinon published the biographical graphic novel &quot;Mermoz&quot; about the exploits of Mermoz. It was reissued in 1990 with title &quot;Mermoz, chevalier du ciel&quot;.

The 1995 docudrama &quot;Wings of Courage&quot; by French director Jean-Jacques Annaud was an account of early airmail pilots including Mermoz (played by Val Kilmer), Henri Guillaumet (played by Craig Sheffer), Saint-Exupéry played by Tom Hulce. The movie was the world&#x27;s first dramatic picture shot in the IMAX-format.

Mermoz was a major character in Antonio Iturbe’s 2017 Spanish language novel &quot;A cielo abierto&quot; which was translated into English and published in 2021 with the title &quot;The Prince of the Skies&quot;.

<text>James Gordon &quot;Bo&quot; Gritz (; born January 18, 1939) is a retired United States Army Special Forces officer who served during the Vietnam War. Following his military career, Gritz became involved in various failed attempts to rescue prisoners of war (POWs) associated with the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue.

In the realm of politics, Gritz ran for the United States presidency in 1992 as a candidate of the Populist Party, advocating an isolationist platform encapsulated in his manifesto, &quot;The Bill of Gritz&quot;. His campaign was characterized by the slogan &quot;God, Guns, and Gritz&quot;.

Gritz&#x27;s life has been marked by controversy, including questions regarding his military awards, his involvement in high-profile standoffs with federal authorities, and his involvement with the Christian Patriot movement and other right-wing militia groups.

Gritz was born in Enid, Oklahoma, and currently resides in Sandy Valley, Nevada. He is the father of four children.

==Early life and education==
Gritz was born on January 18, 1939, in Enid, Oklahoma. His father was a serviceman in the Army Air Force during World War II and was killed in action. In the wake of his father&#x27;s death, Gritz was raised by his maternal grandparents.

Gritz&#x27;s early education was marked by a significant event when he was expelled from his local high school for reasons not specified. This setback, however, did not deter him from pursuing his education. He subsequently attended the Fork Union Military Academy in Virginia, a prestigious military school known for its rigorous academic and physical programs. Gritz graduated from the academy, setting the stage for his future military career.

== Military career ==
Gritz began his military career when he enlisted in the Army on August 20, 1957 and attended Officer Candidate School (OCS). During the Vietnam War, Gritz commanded detachment &quot;B-36&quot; of the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne). This detachment was a mixed American and Cambodian-Vietnamese MIKE Force composed predominantly of local mercenaries. They operated in the III Corps area of southern South Vietnam near the Cambodian border. Among his successful missions was the retrieval of the black box from a downed Lockheed U-2 spy plane in enemy territory in Cambodia in December 1966.

After six years in Vietnam, Gritz served in a variety of assignments, including commanding Special Forces in Latin America from 1975 to 1977, serving as a Desk Officer for the Middle East, and acting as Chief of Congressional Relations for the Defense Security Agency (International Security Affairs) in the Office of the Secretary of Defense from 1977 to 1979. He retired in 1979 at the rank of lieutenant colonel. Following his formal retirement, Gritz claims, with video evidence, to have trained the Afghan mujahideen in America on behalf of the government.

General William Westmoreland, in his memoir &quot;A Soldier Reports&quot;, cites Gritz as &quot;The&quot; American Soldier. Gritz received numerous military awards during his service, although some of these have been called into question. A memo regarding his awards and award recommendations during his time in Vietnam seems to indicate that Gritz was personally involved with the recommendation of some of his medals, including the Legion of Merit, and that some of his award recommendations cited the same missions and incidents, effectively awarding Gritz multiple medals for the same missions, including the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Air Medal and Army Commendation Medal.

== Post-military activities ==
=== POW/MIA activism ===
In the early 1980s, Gritz became involved in the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue, undertaking a series of private missions into Southeast Asia. His goal was to locate U.S. prisoners of war who, according to some beliefs, had been detained since the Vietnam War by the communist governments of Laos and Vietnam, specifically in areas such as Nhommarath.

Gritz&#x27;s missions were initially supported by elements of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 1981, and later financed by high-profile donors like Clint Eastwood and Ross Perot. Operating primarily out of Thailand, Gritz used aliases such as &quot;Richard Patrick Clark&quot; to evade detection. Despite his efforts, Gritz was unable to provide any concrete evidence of the existence of the POWs when he testified as a witness before the House committee headed by Stephen Solarz in 1983.

Gritz&#x27;s activities were heavily publicized and controversial, with critics deeming them haphazard and poorly executed. For instance, some commentators pointed out that supposedly secret missions involved women openly selling commemorative POW-rescue T-shirts in border towns. In his book &quot;Inside Delta Force&quot;, CSM Eric L. Haney, a former Delta Force operator, claims that the unit was twice told to prepare for a mission involving the rescue of American POWs from Vietnam. However, both times the missions were scrubbed, according to Haney, when Gritz suddenly appeared in the spotlight, drawing too much attention to the issue and making the missions too difficult to accomplish.

In 1983, Gritz and four of his associates were tried and convicted in Thailand of illegally importing radio equipment during their &quot;Operation Lazarus Omega&quot;. One of them, a former Navy SEAL David Scott Weekly also known as &quot;Doctor Death&quot;, was also later convicted in America of smuggling explosives. Thai authorities expressed concern that Vietnamese forces in Laos would retaliate against them for cross-border armed intrusions and threatened to jail Gritz for 20 years. Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach called Gritz&#x27;s actions &quot;a flagrant violation of the sovereignty of Laos that everyone should denounce.&quot;

In 1986, Gritz traveled to Burma (now Myanmar) to interview drug kingpin Khun Sa about potential locations of U.S. POWs. He returned with a videotaped interview in which Khun Sa named several officials in the Reagan administration as allegedly involved in narcotics trafficking in Southeast Asia. Among those named was Richard Armitage, who later served as Deputy Secretary of State during George W. Bush&#x27;s first term as president. During this time, Gritz established contacts with the Christic Institute, a progressive group that was then pursuing a lawsuit against the U.S. government over charges of drug trafficking in both Southeast Asia and Central America.

=== Political involvement and conspiracy research ===
In the 1988 election, Gritz was the candidate for Vice President of the United States on the Populist Party ticket. Initially, unbeknownst to him, he was presented as the running mate of former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke. Gritz withdrew early in the race and publicly distanced himself from Duke, opting instead to run for a Nevada Congressional seat. He was subsequently replaced by Floyd Parker on some ballots. Gritz has stated that he accepted the party&#x27;s nomination under the impression that he would be the running mate of James Traficant. After meeting Duke, Gritz described him as &quot;a brash, untraveled, overly opinionated, bigoted young man&quot; and declared, &quot;I will not support anyone that I know to hate any class of Americans.&quot;

In 1989, Gritz established the Center for Action, which focused on various issues, primarily conspiracy theories. He attempted to build bridges among conspiracy theorists and unite activists from both the left and the right, organizing a conference in Las Vegas called &quot;Freedom Call &#x27;90&quot;. Speakers at the conference included 1980 October Surprise theory researcher Barbara Honegger, Bill Davis of the Christic Institute, far-right writer Eustace Mullins, and others.

This shift in focus proved to be almost as controversial as his earlier missions searching for POWs. During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Gritz opposed the war and linked it to a conspiracy theory alleging plans to implement a one-world government, known as the &quot;New World Order&quot;. He appeared on Pacifica Radio stations in California as a guest several times, and for a short period he was sought after as a speaker to left-wing and anti-war audiences. However, during this period, he also became closely associated with the Christian Patriot movement on the right, and spoke at conferences sponsored by Christian Identity pastor Pete Peters. When these associations became known to those on the left, especially after the publication of a report by the Los Angeles-based group People Against Racist Terror labeling Gritz a &quot;front man for fascism&quot;, left-wing audiences lost interest in Gritz, and the Christic Institute and Pacifica Radio ended any further association. He has since distanced himself from the movement.

In the 1992 election, after failing to secure the U.S. Taxpayers&#x27; Party&#x27;s nomination, Gritz ran for President of the United States, again under the Populist Party banner. His campaign slogan was &quot;God, Guns and Gritz&quot;, and he published a political manifesto titled &quot;The Bill of Gritz&quot; (a play on his last name rhyming with &quot;rights&quot;). He advocated for staunch opposition to what he termed &quot;global government&quot; and the &quot;New World Order&quot;, called for an end to all foreign aid, and proposed the abolition of the federal income tax and the Federal Reserve System. During the campaign, Gritz openly declared the United States to be a &quot;Christian Nation&quot;, asserting that the country&#x27;s legal statutes &quot;should reflect unashamed acceptance of Almighty God and His Laws.&quot; He received 106,152 votes nationwide, constituting 0.14 percent of the popular vote. In Utah, he received 3.84 percent of the vote and in Idaho he received 2.13 percent of the vote. In Duchesne County and Oneida County, Idaho, his support exceeded ten percent, while in Franklin County, Idaho, Gritz received over twelve percent of the votes, falling just 23 votes short of pushing Bill Clinton into fourth place – a feat not achieved by a major party nominee in any county nationwide since 1916. As part of his campaign, Gritz proposed an idea to pay off the National debt by minting a coin at the Treasury and sending it to the Federal Reserve, a concept that predates the 2012 trillion-dollar coin idea. Among other proposals, the &quot;Bill of Gritz&quot; called for the complete closure of the border with Mexico, and the dissolution of the Federal Reserve.

===Religious and militia affiliations===
In 1984, Gritz and his wife Claudia joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church, aka the Mormons). Amid allegations of infidelity, Gritz&#x27;s stake president declined to renew his temple recommend until Gritz provided proof of federal income tax payment. Consequently, Gritz resigned from the LDS Church. In 1999, Gritz and his then fourth wife Judy Kirsch became associated with the Church of Israel, a group with origins in the Latter Day Saint movement that later became involved with the Christian Identity movement. Gritz himself, too, became an adherent of what the SPLC described as a &quot;relatively mild version&quot; of Christian Identity; he has since distanced himself from the movement.

In 1994, Gritz, former Arizona State Senator Jerry Gillespie, and other partners established a 200-acre survivalist community and paramilitary training center in Kamiah, Idaho, called Almost Heaven. Gritz left Almost Heaven in late 1998 after a suicide attempt. Almost Heaven was falling apart already before his departure, in part due to conflicts with local authorities and residents as well as between Gritz and an internal radical faction; the community was near defunct by 2003. Influenced by the Church of Israel&#x27;s ideology, Gritz then relocated to Nevada and rebranded his Center for Action as the Fellowship of Eternal Warriors, a group of &quot;warrior-priests&quot; opposing what Gritz defined as the forces of evil.
Gritz has used his influence within the Christian Patriot movement to mediate between legal authorities and far-right activists. In 1992, he mediated during the Ruby Ridge crisis involving fellow veteran Randy Weaver. In 1996, Gritz unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate an end to the standoff involving the Montana Freemen, an anti-government White separatist militia group. After unsuccessful negotiations, Gritz left in frustration, predicting that the FBI would arrest the Freemen.

=== Later activities ===
In 1998, Gritz led an unsuccessful search for the Centennial Olympic Park bomber, Eric Rudolph, with the aim of persuading him to surrender to law enforcement. In 2005, he became an active protester in the Terri Schiavo case. On 19 March 2005, following the removal of Schiavo&#x27;s feeding tube, Gritz was arrested for trespassing after attempting to enter the hospice where she was residing. Starting in 2014, Gritz hosted a radio show on Americanvoiceradio.com titled &quot;Freedom Call&quot;.

=== Writings ===
Gritz has authored three books. His first, &quot;A Nation Betrayed&quot;, published in 1988, contains allegations of drug trafficking and a POW coverup, based on his interview with Khun Sa. His second book, &quot;Called To Serve&quot;, published in 1991, was an autobiography. It expands on the previous book, covering a wide range of conspiracy theories, including the assassination of John F. Kennedy and allegations of a conspiracy to establish a new world order. His third book, &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;, was published in 2003.

== In fiction and documentaries ==
The character of John &quot;Hannibal&quot; Smith from the 1980s television series &quot;The A-Team&quot; was loosely based on Gritz, as were some of Chuck Norris&#x27; film characters. Gritz also reportedly partially inspired several other characters, including Colonel Kurtz in the 1978 film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. Gritz played the character of Lt. Col. Steel, a highly fictionalized version of himself, in the 1990 film &quot;Rescue Force&quot;.

Gritz was portrayed by Bob Gunton in the 1996 CBS television film &quot;The Siege at Ruby Ridge&quot;, and by Vic Browder in the first episode of the 2018 television miniseries &quot;WACO&quot;. In 1983, actor William Shatner purchased the entertainment rights to Gritz&#x27;s life story.

Gritz&#x27;s community, Almost Heaven, was featured in the episode &quot;Survivalists&quot; of &quot;Louis Theroux&#x27;s Weird Weekends&quot; in 1998. The 2017 documentary &quot;Erase and Forget&quot; saw filmmaker Andrea Luka Zimmerman follow Gritz for over a decade, including re-enactments of scenes from his life.

<text>The Velebit mountains of Croatia have several deep caves with some of the world&#x27;s largest subterranean vertical drops.

The &quot;Lukina jama&quot; cave is 1431 m deep (2013), the deepest cave in Croatia and 17th deepest cave in the world and the deepest cave in southeast Europe. At its foot, there are ponds and streams including one of the largest known colonies of subterranean leeches (&quot;Erpobdella mestrovi&quot;), which has been ascertained to represent a new species, genus and also family. Other species discovered in the system, include the air-breathing land snails &quot;Zospeum tholussum&quot;. Like Lukina jama, Slovačka jama, Velebita and Meduza are also located at the &quot;Hajdučki i Rožanski kukovi&quot; special reserve, a dedicated part of the Sjeverni Velebit national park.

Other notable caves include the &quot;Slovačka jama&quot; (&quot;Slovak pit&quot;), (1,320 m deep), &quot;Velebita&quot; (1026 m deep with underground free fall vertical drop of 513 metres ) and &quot;Meduza&quot; (679 m deep).

The vertical shaft &quot;Patkov Gušt&quot;, named after a deceased Croatian speleologist is 553 meters deep and the second deepest pitch in the world .

<text>Velebit (; ; ) is the largest, though not the highest, mountain range in Croatia. The range forms a part of the Dinaric Alps and is located along the Adriatic coast, separating it from Lika in the interior. Velebit begins in the northwest near Senj with the Vratnik mountain pass and ends 145 km to the southeast near the source of the Zrmanja river northwest of Knin.

Its highest peak is the Vaganski vrh at 1,757 m. Major mountain passes on Velebit include the aforementioned Vratnik or Senjsko bilo at 694 m.a.s.l., where the &quot;Josephina&quot; connects Senj with Josipdol; Oštarijska vrata at 928 m.a.s.l. that connects Karlobag and Gospić; and Prezid at 766 m.a.s.l. that connects Obrovac and Gračac.

Velebit is characterized by its simple, solid form, stiff cliffs, the lack of vegetation on the seaward side (towards the Velebit Channel), and the wood-covered slopes of the Lika side. The basic geological characteristic of the mountains is karst; flora and fauna are abundant. The whole mountain range is protected as a nature park. The most popular spots on Velebit are: the peak of Vučjak (1,644 m) above Zavižan, the botanical gardens and caves, Hajdučki and Rožanski kukovi, Štirovača, the Northern Velebit National Park and the Paklenica National Park. The Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service has a permanent measurement station at Zavižan.

==Regions==
Velebit is usually divided into three regions:
* the northern part between the mountain passes Vratnik and Veliki Alan, with the highest peaks including:
** Mali Rajinac (1699 m)
** Veliki Zavižan (1676 m)
** Veliki (Zavižanski) Pivčevac (1676 m)
** Gromovača (1676 m)
* the middle part between Veliki Alan and Baške Oštarije with the highest peaks including:
** Šatorina (1622 m)
** Zečjak (1622 m)
** Laktin vrh (1504 m)
* the southern part between Oštarije and Mali Alan, with the highest peaks including:
** Vaganski vrh (1757 m)
** Sveto brdo (1751 m)
** Visočica (1615 m)
** Crnopac (1402 m) in the far southeastern part
Velebit as a whole is a nature park, from which two national parks have been carved out: Paklenica and Sjeverni Velebit (Northern Velebit)

A further category of even more careful nature preservation exists within Sjeverni Velebit, the special reservation Hajdučki i Rožanski Kukovi, under the highest nature protection available in Croatia. Officially no human activity is allowed there (except research). These are the mostly still unexplored and wild places and probably will stay that way in the future.

A pathway called &quot;Premužićeva staza&quot; (Premužić&#x27;s pathway) leads through the northern and middle parts of Velebit. This pathway was built between 1930 and 1933 and it connects northern and southern Velebit. Its length is . Many parts of Velebit would not be reachable without it. The Velebit mountains are transversed by the A1 through the Sveti Rok Tunnel.

Some 45 peaks exceed 1600 m.

Plješivica or Velebitska Plješivica is a peak in the north of Velebit (1654 m) that hosts a communications tower and a former military facility. There is also a smaller peak of Pljišivica in the north of Velebit (1560 m).

In the categorization of 113 of the highest points of Croatia by professor Vladimir Volenec, first published in 1990 and revised in 2015, there are 76 peaks from the Velebit.

== The caves ==

There are hundreds of &quot;holes&quot; on Velebit. It has the largest and deepest caves in Croatia. The three-part &quot;Lukina jama&quot; cave is 1392 m deep, making it one of the deepest caves in the world, and the deepest in southeast Europe, while the &quot;Slovačka jama&quot; is 1320 m. What makes it unique is that it is completely vertical, steepest in the world. At the bottom of the pothole is a water course or siphon with branches that are still unexplored. A kind of leech was discovered in the pothole, which has been ascertained to represent a new species, genus and family; it has been named &quot;Erpobdella mestrovi&quot;.

List of potholes on Velebit deeper than 500 m:

#Lukina Jama, 1392 m, Hajdučki Kukovi – North Velebit
#Slovačka Jama, 1320 m, Rožanski Kukovi – North Velebit
#Velebita, 941 m, Rožanski Kukovi – North Velebit
#Meduza, 679 m, Rožanski Kukovi – North Velebit
#Patkov Gušt, 553 m, Hajdučki Kukovi – North Velebit
#Ledena Jama, 536 m, Lomska Duliba – North Velebit
#Ponor na Bunovcu, 534 m, Bunovac – South Velebit
#Jama Olimp, 531 m, Hajdučki Kukovi – North Velebit
#Lubuška Jama, 521 m, Hajdučki Kukovi – North Velebit

It is also home to &quot;Degenia velebitica&quot;, an endemic and protected species of plant in the mustard family discovered in 1907 by the Hungarian botanist Árpád von Degen.

The imposing nature of the Velebit mountain has made it something of a national symbol in Croatian folklore. There is a patriotic folk song &quot;Vila Velebita&quot; that personifies a fairy in Velebit.

== Velebit in literature ==

In the Republic of Venice, Velebit was known as Montagna della Morlacca (&quot;Mountain of the Morlach&quot;), named after the Morlachs, an originally Romance ethnic group that eventually got assimilated into the local Croatian population, a generally socio-cultural and professional segment of the Slavic-speaking population rather than a Romance-speaking ethnicity.

&quot;Planine&quot;, the first Croatian novel by Petar Zoranić, was inspired by the Velebit mountain.

<text>Edward James Corbett (25 July 1875 – 19 April 1955) was an Anglo-Indian hunter and author. He gained fame through hunting and killing several man-eating tigers and leopards in Northern India, as detailed in his bestselling 1944 memoir &quot;Man-Eaters of Kumaon&quot;. In his later years, he became an outspoken advocate of the nascent conservation movement.

Born in Naini Tal, Corbett explored and hunted in the jungles of India in childhood. He shot his first man-eater in 1907 and continued to hunt and kill such animals over the next four decades. Animals such as the Champawat Tiger, the Leopard of Rudraprayag, and the Panar Leopard had taken hundreds of victims in the divisions of Kumaon and Garwhal, before their deaths at Corbett&#x27;s hands. &quot;Man-Eaters of Kumaon&quot;, which detailed several such hunts, became an international bestseller; it was followed by several other books and was adapted into a 1948 Hollywood film. Corbett increasingly disdained what he saw as the rapacious extermination of India&#x27;s forests and wildlife, and fervently promoted wildlife photography as an alternative to trophy hunting. He played a major role in the creation of India&#x27;s first wildlife reserve in 1934; it was renamed Jim Corbett National Park after his death. The Indochinese tiger subspecies received the scientific name &quot;Panthera tigris corbetti&quot; in his honour.

For many years, Corbett earned a living working for the railway companies, and for twenty-two years supervised the transport of goods across the Ganges at Mokameh Ghat. During the First World War, he recruited a labour corps and commanded them on the Western Front; he also supervised the logistics of the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919. Returning to his home town during the interwar period, he became a prominent local landowner and businessman who also organised hunts for the elite of British India, including the then-Governor-General Lord Linlithgow, who became a close friend. Corbett served as an instructor in jungle survival for troops of the Burma Campaign during the Second World War. Dismayed by the febrile atmosphere surrounding Indian independence, he emigrated to Kenya in 1947, and died in Nyeri eight years later.

==Ancestry and early life==
The Corbetts descended from several families who had emigrated from the British Isles to the Indian subcontinent over the course of the 19th century. His paternal grandparents Joseph and Harriet Corbett, having eloped together from a monastery and a nunnery in Belfast, had arrived in India on 7 February 1815. They had nine children; the sixth, Christopher William, was born at Meerut in 1822, and followed his father into the army, where he served as a medical officer. He married Mary Anne Morrow in December 1845, and they had three children before her early death. Surviving the Indian Mutiny of 1857, he retired from military service and married Mary Jane Doyle , a 22-year-old widow of Anglo-Irish descent, in 1859. She had had four children with Charles James Doyle of Agra, who had been killed in the rebellion.

In 1862, Christopher William was appointed the postmaster of Naini Tal, a thriving hill station in northern India which had been untouched by the Mutiny. There, he and Mary Jane had nine children, and additionally raised four children of a deceased sister. As Christopher William&#x27;s salary was not large enough to support so many people, they supplemented their income through shrewd property investments, which Mary Jane was especially skilled at—she in effect became the first estate agent in Naini Tal, a valuable position in the rapidly-expanding town. Through his social connections and friendship with Henry Ramsay, the commissioner of the Kumaon division, Christopher William was additionally able to acquire a plot of land in the southern plains near Kaladhungi, on which he built a winter residence he named Arundel.
Edward James Corbett, the eighth and penultimate child of Christopher William and Mary Jane, was born on 25 July 1875 in Naini Tal. His early childhood years were privileged, and he was cared for by his mother, his elder sisters, and local servants; from the latter, he picked up the local languages, the basics of Hindu practices and philosophy, and some of their superstitions. However, the family soon suffered two misfortunes: first, a large landslide on 18 September 1880 which killed 151 people additionally ruined several of the Corbett&#x27;s property investments; and second, Christopher William, who had retired from postmastership in 1878, died on 21 April 1881 after suffering heart problems. Mary Jane built a home on the opposite side of Naini Tal lake to the landslide; named Gurney House, it would be Jim Corbett&#x27;s home for most of his life.

Corbett spent much of his childhood exploring the jungles around Gurney House; from these explorations, and from willing adults such as his eldest brother Tom, and a nearby headman named Kunwar Singh, he gained intimate knowledge of the habits of the local wildlife. He also began hunting, first with projectile weapons such as a catapult and a pellet bow, until being gifted an old muzzle-loading shotgun at the age of eight. With these weapons, he grew more skilled at hunting and tracking animals. After surviving a near-fatal bout of pneumonia at the age of six, he began his formal education in Naini Tal at Oak Openings School; there, training with the local cadet company, the ten-year-old Corbett&#x27;s shooting impressed a group of dignitaries including the future Field Marshal Earl Roberts enough that he was granted a loan of a military-specification Martini-Henry rifle. Not long afterwards, he shot his first big cat—a leopard—with this rifle.

Although Corbett soon became proficient as a young hunter, as a student, first at Oak Openings and then at the Diocesian Boys&#x27; School, he was fairly average. Although he wanted to become an engineer, that required further education and money which the family did not have, as Tom had now married and was supporting his own family. He also knew that it would be his responsibility to look after his mother and two sisters in later years. In turn they, especially his one-year older sister Maggie, were quite devoted to him. Leaving home at the age of seventeen, he took his first job as a temporary fuel inspector in Bihar, with a salary of one hundred rupees per month.

==Work career and WWI service==
Corbett spent the two years of his contract near Bakhtiarpur, in charge of a sizeable labour force which collected timber to be used as locomotive fuel. The gruelling work was slightly eased by the rapport he, unlike most of European descent, could build with his men. In cutting down up to of forest per day, he gained an appreciation for the then-unknown sciences of ecology and conservation. At the end of his contract, Corbett&#x27;s honesty in not keeping excess profits for himself impressed a senior railway agent and earned him a job at the Samastipur office, where he worked for a year on various jobs. He was then appointed, in 1895, to the contract of transporting goods across the Ganges at Mokameh Ghat: by structuring his workforce efficiently and forming strong friendships with his subordinates, Corbett managed to clear the preexisting backlog, to the surprise of his superiors. He would remain in control of shipping goods at Mokhameh Ghat for the following twenty-two years.

His life at Mokameh Ghat was regular and peaceful. Living in a bungalow with three servants, only rarely seeing other Europeans, he began to become an active member of the local community, building a small school; the initial number of twenty students rapidly expanded to over three hundred, and the local government was compelled to take over the institution&#x27;s running. Within a few years, Corbett was promoted to oversee the passenger steamers as well as the cargo shipping. This promotion gave him a large increase in salary, much of which he remitted to his family in Naini Tal, as well as access to the high-ranking travellers who often crossed the Ganges, such as Indian royalty and Chandra Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, the Prime Minister of Nepal. He also trained new arrivals from Britain whom the railways had recruited there.

At Mokameh Ghat, Corbett had come to view himself as more Indian than any other identity, but he retained his patriotism for Britain. He attempted to enlist when the Second Boer War broke out, but the railway authorities refused to release him from his contract, believing he was too valuable in his position at Mokameh Ghat. When the First World War broke out 1914, Corbett travelled to Calcutta to enlist but was rejected as too old at 38. However, as the war of attrition dragged on, the authorities began to recruit more heavily from India and he was commissioned as a captain in 1917, to the displeasure of his superiors. Ordered to raise a labour corps, he easily recruited five thousand men in Kumaon, where he was greatly esteemed because of his hunting of man-eaters; he took a tenth of these as a personal unit, named the 70th Kumaon Company. They set sail from Bombay in late summer 1917.
Landing in Southampton, Corbett and his men were soon transferred to the Western Front, where they were posted to numerous positions including La Chapellette near Péronne. In the difficult conditions, Corbett sought to protect his men and keep their morale high. In addition to being in an unfamiliar land and climate, the Indian troops, often scorned by their British counterparts, faced difficulties like not being able to eat tinned beef stew or pork, both staples of British trench warfare. Corbett conducted himself well. After a visit to La Chapellette in January 1918, Lord Ampthill, who was in charge of the foreign labour corps, noted that Corbett struck him as &quot;competent and resourceful&quot;, having introduced a novel way of heating the troop accommodation and having built, to Ampthill&#x27;s astonishment, a &quot;substantial brick building&quot; containing a bathroom and drying room, both heated by an incinerator. At the conclusion of the war in 1918, only one of the five hundred men in the company had died. Corbett, now promoted to the rank of Major, explored London for a day before departing from Tilbury, visiting the pyramids of Giza on his way back home to India.

While negotiating with the railways on how he would rejoin their workforce, Corbett was unexpectedly called up again by the army for the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919. In late April or early May, he was sent to Peshawar, where he likely was in charge of the supply lines before the Battle of Thal, in which he may have seen action. He was subsequently involved in subduing tribes in Zhob district and Waziristan.

==Businessman and local notable==
After the Third Anglo-Afghan War finished in 1919, Corbett declined to return to the railways, and worked on a Kumaon house agency he had invested in and whose owner had subsequently died. Corbett expanded this business, named F.E.G. Mathews &amp; Co. after its late owner, into hardware and tradesmanship. Around 1915, he had purchased the near-derelict village of Chhoti Haldwani near Kaladhungi. Despite initial difficulties, the village came to prosper: Corbett imported new crops such as bananas, grapes, and maize, and maintained the village to a high standard. A wall he built to protect the villagers remains standing.
Corbett became close friends with , the Kumaon District Commissioner, and with him fought banditry in the jungles; they also invested together in East African coffee. Wyndham retired in 1924 to the farm they had invested in near Majengo, and Corbett travelled to East Africa most years to inspect his investment and see his friend. He also built a house for himself and Maggie in Kaladhungi, although he normally eschewed what was nominally his bedroom and preferred to sleep in a tent in the garden; when the house was later converted into a museum in his honour, staff erected a bust of him on the normal site of his tent.

In 1920, Corbett retook the position of vice-chairman of the Naini Tal municipal board, which he had vacated a decade earlier due to local inactivity. As part of this committee for two decades, he enforced economic standards and improved civil engineering in the town. As chairman of the public works committee, he took a personal interest both in maintaining and renewing the town&#x27;s attractiveness, and in environmental protection. He passed laws against excessive fishing and deforestation, and unsuccessfully campaigned for power lines to be placed underground.

As a more prominent figure in Naini Tal, Corbett began to be accepted into a wider social circle, to whom he had previously been an outcast. He was increaingly called upon to coordinate hunting events. Initially simple partridge shoots, Corbett was soon organising tiger shoots for the elite of British India. This culminated in a close friendship with Lord Linlithgow, Governor-General of India between 1936 and 1943; Corbett organised hunts near Kaladhungi for Linlithgow and his family several times a year, and was often invited to stay in the Viceroy House in Delhi.

===WWII service===
At the outbreak of the Second World War, Corbett, who had retained his rank of major in the reserve army, immediately volunteered again. Unsurprisingly, at well over sixty years old, he was rejected. After initially working for a charity which looked after the families of active servicement, he became a recruitment officer in 1940 after lying about his own age. After two years in this role, he suffered from a serious typhus infection, probably exacerbated by a near-drowning experience he had had when a boat capsised on the Sharda River. During a three-month hospital stay, he lost almost half his weight and came close to becoming a cripple, but overcame his physical challenges with regular exercise.

During Corbett&#x27;s convalescence in 1942/43, Imperial Japan had commenced the Burma campaign in the jungles of Southeast Asia. When he next approached the army in late 1943, they saw his potential as a source of knowledge: by February 1944, he had been appointed senior instructor in junglecraft at Chhindwara and recommissioned as a lieutenant colonel. He inspected the Burmese forests in March 1944 and returned to India on his first flight, courtesy of American airmen he had befriended.

Corbett&#x27;s training, for British and American troops destined for the Burmese jungles, encompassed a wide range of topics. Survival techniques he taught included obtaining fresh water, distinguishing poisonous snakes and edible plants, trapping small animals, creating natural herbal medicines for wounds, fevers, stomach problems, and communicating by blowing through reeds. His students were taught how to orient themselves, how to pinpoint sounds, and how to keep maximum visual awareness. He displayed how tracking skills allowed him to assess how many enemy soldiers passed on a track, how long ago, how fast they were travelling, and even whether their guns were loaded. One of the soldiers he trained later noted that &quot;Corbett appeared to be a cross between a magician and a master detective&quot;.

==Relationship with wildlife==
===Hunting man-eaters===
In 1907, Corbett was approached by the deputy commissioner of Naini Tal, who asked him to hunt the Champawat Tiger. This tigress had allegedly killed two hundred people in Nepal, before a mass beating drove her into India. She established her territory around Lohaghat in early 1903 and doubled her total over the next four years, claiming a victim once every three weeks on average. None of the &quot;shikaris&quot; (hunters), sportsmen, or army infantry deputised to hunt her had come close. Corbett accepted the task, and hunted the tigress for a number of days. After a seventeen-year-old girl was killed, a beat involving 298 men was organised, which drove the tigress from cover and allowed Corbett to shoot her. As a reward, he was presented with a rifle by Sir John Hewett, Lieutenant Governor of the United Provinces. A twelve-guinea .275 Rigby with leaf sights and a French walnut stock, it became Corbett&#x27;s favourite weapon, used in most subsequent man-eater hunts.

In the wake of this success, Corbett was asked to hunt two other man-eaters active in India: a tiger active around Mukteshwar, and the Panar Leopard in the villages in the east of the Almora district. The latter animal had killed over four hundred people. Corbett tackled them both in 1910, tracking and killing the tiger in the spring; he was forced to abort his initial attempt to kill the leopard in April because of his work at Mokameh Ghat, but returned in September and killed the animal in a nighttime hunt.
It was over fifteen years before Corbett hunted another man-eater. In 1925, he was asked by his friend Sir William Ibbotson to hunt the Leopard of Rudraprayag, which since 1918 had been terrorizing the populace of the neighbouring Garhwal division. Although it had only claimed 125 victims, much less than the Panar Leopard, it received far more attention, being mentioned in the newspapers on multiple continents across the Anglosphere, in addition to nearly every publication in India. This notoriety came about because the leopard&#x27;s territory covered the pilgrimage trails to the Hindu shrines of Kedarnath and Badrinath, then visited by 60,000 pilgrims annually.

Corbett&#x27;s sister Maggie tried to dissuade her brother, now fifty years old, but was unsuccessful. He hunted the leopard for ten weeks in the autumn of 1925, sometimes with Ibbotson and sometimes alone, on some occasions coming close and on one terrifying occasion being hunted himself, before reaching the limits of his endurance and returning home. He returned early the next year, and again searched for several weeks. On the final night he was due to spend at Rudraprayag—he had put off urgent business in East Africa for three months already—he baited and fatally shot the leopard.
Over the next several years, Corbett continued hunting man-eating tigers. When shooting the Talla Des man-eater in April 1929, he suffered from an abscess in his ear which almost deafened him permanently. That year, he began hunting the Tigers of Chowgarh, shooting first the cub and subsequently, on 11 April 1930, its mother. These were followed by: the Kanda man-eater in July 1932; the Mohan man-eater, likely around May 1933; the Chuka man-eater in April 1938; and the Thak man-eater in November of that year. He shot his final man-eater at the age of 71 after the Second World War.

===Conservation===

On his trips to East Africa in the 1920s, Corbett began to compare the untouched grasslands there to the increasingly exploited forests in India. This kickstarted his thoughts on what would become known as conservationism, although for the time being he continued to hunt for sport, shipping antelope trophies back to India and killing the famous large tiger called the Bachelor of Powalgarh in 1930. His biographer Martin Booth noted that Corbett never &quot;truly resolved a conflict of ideals&quot; between his love for the forest and animals and some desire to exploit them for himself, such as in his continuing organisation of tiger shoots.

Corbett likely bought his first camera in Britain or Bombay on his way back from the Western Front. He was in possession of one by the time he went on a hike with an Eton College schoolmaster in September 1921. Corbett was fascinated by the photography of his acquaintance Frederick Walter Champion, who devised ways of recording tigers on cine film. He soon came to appreciate that unlike a trophy, which soon loses its colour and elegance, photographs lasted forever, did not result in an animal&#x27;s death, and required somewhat greater skill—because the early cameraman had to get much closer than the rifleman. In a ten-year project, he constructed a &quot;studio&quot; around a jungle stream near his home, where he arranged foliage, hiding places, and hydrology to draw tigers to be filmed. His greatest success came in early 1938, when he filmed seven tigers, including one white, present simultaneously on the bank of the stream.

In the 1930s, Corbett felt increasingly aggrieved at the degradation of the forests. He began writing to newspapers to condemn over-shooting and ruthless deforestation. These letters criticised shooting laws, called for conservation funds to be established, and censured over-eager hunters. In collaboration with Malcolm Hailey, governor of the United Provinces, he established an conservationist association named &quot;The All India Conference for the Preservation of Wild Life&quot;. In 1934, he persuaded Hailey to establish India&#x27;s first national park over of forest in the Ramganga river valley; in 1957, it was renamed the Jim Corbett National Park. The legislation introduced to protect this reserve was far ahead of its time, compared to other parts of India.

==Personal life==
Corbett never married. His biographer Martin Booth dismissed suggestions that he was homosexual, instead citing his personal demeanor and his economic, social, and familial circumstances. As a &quot;domiciled&quot; Anglo-Indian, Corbett was inferior socially to any young women from Britain looking for a husband, especially considering his isolated and somewhat primitive life at Mokameh Ghat. He was also generally quiet and introverted. This lack of social confidence was encouraged by his mother Mary, who was intensely protective of all her sons, perhaps motivated by a desire to be looked after in old age. In 1902, she and Maggie, who was similarly jealous of any potential wife for Jim, managed to obstruct his courtship of a holidaying English girl he had fallen in love with. Within months of Mary Corbett&#x27;s death on 16 May 1924, Jim fell deeply in love with a nineteen-year-old woman named Helen, who was on holiday in India with her parents. While she was flattered by his devoted courtship, but was not certain about the prospect of marriage to him, while her family and Jim&#x27;s friends considered them totally unsuitable for each other. Rebuffed, he withdrew. On a trip to Britain in 1928, he stopped in Edinburgh to make a final bid for Helen&#x27;s hand in marriage, but found she was engaged.
It was common practice for European men to have affairs with Indian women of good standing; it is possible Corbett did so, either at Mokameh Ghat or in Naini Tal. For many years, through love letters and private visits, he conducted an affair with Jean Ibbotson, the wife of his good friend William, who may have known about and condoned the relationship. Jean was extroverted, pretty, a skilled huntress, and a lover of nature; it is likely she played a part in Corbett&#x27;s increasing conservationism.

Corbett formed a number of close friendships with Indians, most notably his , who served as a mix of army batmen and butlers. The two Corbett was closest to were Mothi Singh, who probably served Corbett the longest, and Madho Singh, who was notably present when Corbett killed the Chowgarh tigress. He also forged a close friendship and business relationship with Bahadar Shah Khan, the Muslim headman of Chhoti Haldwani, who was an intermediary between Corbett and the village&#x27;s inhabitants, and who on occasion served as Corbett&#x27;s bearer or even advisor.

Corbett received the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal in the 1928 New Year Honours. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire in the King&#x27;s 1946 Birthday Honours.

==Writing career and later life==

After 1947, Corbett and his sister Maggie retired to Nyeri, Kenya, where he lived in the cottage &#x27;Paxtu&#x27; in the grounds of the Hotel Outspan, which had originally been built for his friend Lord Baden-Powell.

He continued to write and sound the alarm about the declining numbers of wild cats and other wildlife. Corbett was at the Treetops, a hut built on the branches of a giant ficus tree, as the bodyguard of Princess Elizabeth when she stayed there on 5–6 February 1952. That night, her father, King George VI died, and Elizabeth ascended to the throne. Corbett wrote in the hotel&#x27;s visitors&#x27; register:

For the first time in the history of the world, a young girl climbed into a tree one day a Princess, and after having what she described as her most thrilling experience, she climbed down from the tree the next day a Queen—God bless her.

Corbett died of a heart attack a few days after he finished his sixth book, &quot;Tree Tops&quot;, and was buried at St. Peter&#x27;s Anglican Church in Nyeri.

&quot;Man-eaters of Kumaon&quot; was a great success in India, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the first edition of the American Book-of-the-Month Club being 250,000 copies. It was later translated into 27 languages.

In 1968, one of the five remaining subspecies of tigers was named after him: &quot;Panthera tigris corbetti&quot;, the Indochinese tiger, also called Corbett&#x27;s tiger.

In 1948, in the wake of &quot;Man-Eaters of Kumaon&quot;″s success, a Hollywood film, &quot;Man-Eater of Kumaon&quot;, was made, directed by Byron Haskin and starring Sabu, Wendell Corey and Joe Page. The film did not follow any of Corbett&#x27;s stories; a new story was invented. The film was a flop, although some interesting footage of the tiger was filmed. Corbett is known to have said that &quot;the best actor was the tiger&quot;. In 1986, the BBC produced a docudrama titled &quot;Man-Eaters of Kumaon&quot; with Frederick Treves in the role of Corbett. An IMAX movie &quot;&quot;, based on Corbett&#x27;s books, was made in 2002 starring Christopher Heyerdahl as Corbett. A TV movie based on &quot;The Man-Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag&quot; starring Jason Flemyng was made in 2005.

<text>Southern Bashkardi or [[Bashagard County|Bashagerdi]], or simply &quot;Bashkardi&quot;, and also known as southern &quot;Bashaka&quot;, is a Southwestern Iranian language spoken in the southeast of Iran in the provinces of Kerman, Sistan and Baluchestan, and Hormozgan. The language is closely related to Garmsiri, Larestani and Kumzari. It forms a transitional dialect group to northwestern Iranian Balochi, due to intense areal contact. 

Northern Bashkardi, or &quot;Marzi Gāl&quot;, is closer to neighbours than is Southern Bashkardi, or &quot;Molki Gāl&quot;, 
and has been classified as a dialect of the neighboring Garmsiri ( Bandari) language.

The Bashkardi varieties spoken further inland may not all fall into either Northern or Southern Bashkardi.

<text>Adolf Arthur Englander, BSC (15 July 1916 – 29 January 2004) was a British television cinematographer. He was one of the first film cameramen to work seriously in the field of television in the UK, which for much of its early period almost exclusively employed electronic cameras.

Englander was born in London during a First World War Zeppelin raid, and during the 1930s came to be referred to by his initials &quot;AA&quot; due to the unsavory connections between his first name and that of Adolf Hitler, and his dislike for the middle name. He was also often referred to by the nickname &quot;Tubby&quot;.

He began his career after leaving school at the age of fifteen in 1930, and initially worked in the film industry at the Stoll Film Studios in Cricklewood. Here he worked first as a clapper boy, then during the course of the decade worked his way up to become magazine loader and then an assistant cameraman. At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, he joined the Royal Fusiliers, but was quickly seconded to the army&#x27;s film unit, making documentary and propaganda films.

After the end of the war in 1945 he continued working in documentaries until he joined BBC Television in 1952, becoming one of the Corporation&#x27;s few film cameramen. At the time, film was mainly used by the BBC for shooting documentaries, news reports and short external scenes for dramas and other programmes, with the majority of programming being transmitted live from electronic video cameras.

It was the acquisition of staff of Englander&#x27;s talent that increased the use of film at the BBC, and in 1956 the Corporation also acquired the Ealing Studios complex, which it turned into a dedicated studio for making inserts for television programmes, and eventually entire programmes themselves, on film.

Englander worked on film inserts for highly prestigious BBC dramas such as Rudolph Cartier&#x27;s &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1958–59) and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1961), and later programmes such as &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;Colditz&quot; and &quot;Maigret&quot;. Even after the era of live television had passed in the early 1960s, the BBC still shot the majority of its fiction programmes on videotape, with film inserts used only for location material and difficult-to-shoot sequences, until the late 1980s. He also worked on highly prestigious all-film documentary series such as &quot;Civilisation&quot; (1969) and &quot;Alistair Cooke&#x27;s America&quot; (1973).

BBC regulations stipulate that all employees must retire at sixty, and Englander was reluctantly forced to comply with this rule in 1975. Following his retirement from the Corporation he worked for some time as a freelance lighting cameraman. In the early 1970s, he co-wrote the book &quot;Filming for Television&quot; with Paul Petzold (published 1976, Focal Press, London).

He died at the age of eighty-eight of natural causes.

<doc id="889926" wikidata="Q656556" url="?curid=889926" title="Butyl group">
<text>In organic chemistry, butyl is a four-carbon alkyl radical or substituent group with general chemical formula , derived from either of the two isomers (&quot;n&quot;-butane and isobutane) of butane.

The isomer &quot;n&quot;-butane can connect in two ways, giving rise to two &quot;-butyl&quot; groups:

* If it connects at one of the two terminal carbon atoms, it is normal butyl or &quot;n&quot;-butyl: (preferred IUPAC name: butyl)
* If it connects at one of the non-terminal (internal) carbon atoms, it is secondary butyl or &quot;sec&quot;-butyl: (preferred IUPAC name: butan-2-yl)

The second isomer of butane, isobutane, can also connect in two ways, giving rise to two additional groups:

* If it connects at one of the three terminal carbons, it is isobutyl: (preferred IUPAC name: 2-methylpropyl)
* If it connects at the central carbon, it is tertiary butyl, tert&quot;-butylor t&quot;-butyl: (preferred IUPAC name: &quot;tert&quot;-butyl)

== Nomenclature ==

According to IUPAC nomenclature, &quot;isobutyl&quot;, &quot;&quot;sec&quot;-butyl&quot;, and &quot;&quot;tert&quot;-butyl&quot; used to be allowed retained names. The latest guidance changed that: only &quot;tert&quot;-butyl is kept as preferred prefix, all other butyl-names are removed. In the convention of skeletal formulas, every line ending and line intersection specifies a carbon atom (unless otherwise indicated) saturated with single-linked hydrogen atoms (unless otherwise indicated). The &quot;R&quot; symbol indicates any radical or other non-specific functional group.

Butyl is the largest substituent for which trivial names are commonly used for all isomers.

The butyl group&#x27;s carbon that is connected to the rest (R) of the molecule is called the RI or R-prime carbon . The prefixes &quot;sec&quot; (from &quot;secondary&quot;) and &quot;tert&quot; (from &quot;tertiary&quot;) refer to the number of additional side chains (or carbons) connected to the first butyl carbon. The prefix &quot;iso&quot; or &quot;iso&quot; means &quot;isolated&quot; while the prefix &#x27;&quot;n-&quot;&#x27; stands for &quot;normal&quot;.

Butan-2-yl (&quot;sec&quot;-butyl) group is chiral. The carbon atom at position 2 is a stereocenter. It has four different groups attached: , , , and (the R group is not equal to those three groups). The names of the two chiral groups are: (2&quot;S&quot;)-butan-2-yl and (2&quot;R&quot;)-butan-2-yl.

== Example ==

The four isomers (ignoring stereoisomers) of &quot;butyl acetate&quot; demonstrate these four isomeric configurations. Here, the acetate radical appears in each of the positions where the &quot;R&quot; symbol is used in the chart above:

&quot;sec&quot;-Butyl acetate is chiral, and has one stereocenter, and two enantiomers. The names of enantiomers are:
* [(2&quot;S&quot;)-butan-2-yl] acetate, (+)-&quot;sec&quot;-Butyl acetate
* [(2&quot;R&quot;)-butan-2-yl] acetate, (-)-&quot;sec&quot;-Butyl acetate

Therefore, for butyl acetate, the total number of isomers is five, if stereoisomers are included.

== Etymology ==
Alkyl radicals are often considered as a series, a progression sequenced by the number of carbon atoms involved. In that progression, Butyl (containing 4 carbon atoms) is the fourth, and the last with preferred IUPAC name derived from its history. The word &quot;butyl&quot; is derived from butyric acid, a four-carbon carboxylic acid found in rancid butter. The name &quot;butyric acid&quot; comes from Latin &quot;butyrum&quot;, butter. Subsequent preferred IUPAC names for alkyl radicals in the series are simply named from the Greek number that indicates the number of carbon atoms in the group: pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, etc.

== &quot;tert&quot;-Butyl effect ==
The &quot;tert&quot;-butyl substituent is very bulky and is used in chemistry for kinetic stabilization, as are other bulky groups such as the related trimethylsilyl group. The effect of the &quot;tert&quot;-butyl group on the progress of a chemical reaction is called the Thorpe–Ingold effect illustrated in the Diels-Alder reaction below. Compared to a hydrogen substituent, the &quot;tert&quot;-butyl substituent accelerates the reaction rate by a factor of 240.

The &quot;tert&quot;-butyl effect is an example of steric hindrance.

== &quot;tert&quot;-Butyl as protecting group ==
A &quot;tert&quot;-butyl (&quot;t&quot;Bu) ether is an acid-labile protecting group for alcohols.

===Protection===

A traditional way to introduce the &quot;t&quot;Bu group to a hydroxyl group is by treating the compound with isobutylene in the presence of a Brønsted acid or Lewis acid.

===Deprotection===
Various acids can be used to cleave the &quot;t&quot;Bu group, including both Brønsted acids such as trifluoroacetic acid and Lewis acids such as titanium tetrachloride.

<doc id="889928" wikidata="Q386420" url="?curid=889928" title="Khao Yai National Park">
<text>Khao Yai National Park is a national park in Thailand. Established in 1962 as Thailand&#x27;s first national park, it is the third largest national park in Thailand.

==Description==
Khao Yai National Park is in the western part of the Sankamphaeng Mountain Range, at the southwestern boundary of the Khorat Plateau. The highest mountain in the area of the park is high Khao Rom.
This park lies largely in Nakhon Ratchasima Province (Khorat), but also includes parts of Saraburi, Prachinburi and Nakhon Nayok Provinces.

The park is the third largest in Thailand. It covers an area of 1,353,472 rai ~ , including tropical seasonal forests and grasslands. Elevations mostly from . There are 3,000 species of plants, 320 species of birds such as red junglefowl and coral-billed ground cuckoo, and 66 species of mammals, including Asian black bear, Indian elephant, gaur, gibbon, Indian sambar deer, southern pig-tailed macaque, Indian muntjac, Ussuri dhole and wild pigs. There have been no tigers in Khao Yai for at least 20 years. Its waterfalls include the Heo Narok (เหวนรก), and Heo Suwat (หวสุวัต) made famous by the film &quot;The Beach&quot;.

==History==
Around 1922 some people from Ban Tha Dan and Ban Tha Chai villages in Nakhon Nayok Province built a settlement within the forest in the Sankamphaeng mountains. Up to 30 households cultivated the land. The area was formally recognized by the government and classified as Tambon Khao Yai within Pak Phli District.

Due to its remoteness from the authorities it became a refuge for criminals and fugitives. After an attempt to capture the suspects in the area, in 1932 the villagers were relocated into the plains some 30 km away and the tambon status was cancelled.

In 1959 the prime minister, Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, instructed the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of the Interior to create a process whereby national parks could be established.
Khao Yai National Park was then established on 18 September 1962, declared by royal proclamation in the &quot;Government Gazette&quot; (Book 79, Section 89) as the first national park in Thailand. A major role in its establishment was played by Boonsong Lekakul, one of the 20th century&#x27;s most famous Thai conservationists. It was named after the defunct tambon, Khao Yai.

In 1984 the park was made an ASEAN Heritage Park, and on 14 July 2005 the park, together with other parks in the same range and in the Dong Phaya Yen Mountains further north, was proclaimed a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name &quot;Dong Phaya Yen–Khao Yai Forest Complex&quot;. As the lands adjacent to the national park are becoming increasingly developed into luxury hotels and golf courses, acquiring land for future wildlife conservation efforts is becoming problematic. Homes and residential villas have been built illegally within the limits of the protected area of the forest. Illegal logging is also a problem in the area of the park.

==Key mountains==

===Khao Rom (เขาร่ม)===
Khao Rom is the highest mountain in Khao Yai National Park, measuring up to 1,351 meters above sea level.

Reaching the peak of the mountain is only accessible on foot, which few people attempt to, except for forestry officers

===Khao Laem (เขาแหลม)===
Since this mountain is spiral shaped, it is called Khao Laem (เขาแหลม; Lit: Spiky Mountain). Khao Laem is the park&#x27;s 2nd highest mountain, the highest being Khao Rom.

Similar to Khao Rom, reaching the peak of the mountain is also only possible on foot. Reaching the peak of the mountain takes no less than 7 hours. Before reaching the absolute summit, one must also climb up a rope.

With such difficult challenges climbing the mountain, The Lottery Club once awarded a 60,000 baht prize to a woman who would conquer the summit of the peak. The recipient of the award, Catherine B. Buri, conquered the summit in 1972.

The path used to travel to the summit of the mountain is also used as a wildlife corridor by animals, therefore many animal tracks are found here. Ascending the mountain also affords the opportunity of seeing various forms of wildlife.

==Visitors==
According to the Department of National Parks (DNP), which manages the park, visitors to Khao Yai have risen from 671,569 in 2008 to more than 1.2 million in FY2016. From October 2015 to September 2016, 471,514 vehicles entered the park. The congestion has led to demands to close the park to private vehicles. During one of its busiest periods, New Year&#x27;s week from 30 December – 3 January 2016, the park received 156,574 visitors. They left in excess of 23 tonnes of waste behind. As litter was a serious problem at the park, in 2020 the park started mailing litter to the homes of visitors who left it there.

==Climate==
Khao Yai National Park has three main seasons, with an annual mean temperature of 23 °C, though this varies greatly with the seasons.

*Rainy season (May–October): Most days have high rates of precipitation. The atmosphere is humid with average temperatures of 27 °C during the day dropping to 13 °C at night. Streams at peak flow.
*Cool season (November–February): Clear skies, sunny and cool. Average temperatures of 22 °C during the day and 10 °C at night. Good time for hiking.
*Hot season (March–April): Humid with daytime temperatures of 20–30 °C and 17 °C at night.

Limestone is present towards the eastern end close to the Dângrêk Mountains. Sandstone outcrops exist in the south and north of the park. Shales and schist are also present. In the south, steep slopes made of granite and conglomerates are seen.

==Drainage==
There are four drainage areas in the park which are vital catchments for four river systems. The Lam Takhong River drains from the central Khao Yai area and runs in a northeasterly direction to the Mekong. The Sai Yai River system drains from the eastern basin, turning sharply into the southern floodplains and on to the Gulf of Thailand. The Nakhon Nayok River system drains from the southwest watershed into Nakhon Nayok Province to the south. The Saraburi Province drainage system drains westward from the far west of Khao Yai.

==Fauna==
Khao Yai is home to a variety of animals. It is one of the few places in Thailand where wild elephants still survive. Other larger animals include gibbons, pig-tailed macaques, muntjacs and sambar deer. Other large animals include barking deer, porcupine, and civet. Other species that can occasionally be seen include sun bear, Asian black bear, gaur, otter, dhole and jackal. 
In early-2017 it was announced that 18 tigers, including five males, seven female and six cubs, were filmed by surveillance cameras in the Dong Phaya Yen-Khao Yai world heritage site in June 2016 and February 2017 in a joint effort of the Department of National Parks, the Freeland Foundation, and the Panthera Corporation. The last time that tigers were seen by surveillance cameras in Khao Yai National Park was in 2002.

==Tribute==
On 18 September 2017, Google celebrated the 55th anniversary of Khao Yai National Park with a Google Doodle.

<text>William Michael Rossetti (25 September 1829 – 5 February 1919) was an English writer and critic.

==Early life==
Born in London, Rossetti was a son of exiled Italian scholar Gabriele Rossetti and his wife Frances Rossetti &quot;née&quot; Polidori; he was the brother of Maria Francesca Rossetti, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Christina Georgina Rossetti.

==Career==

He was one of the seven founder members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848, and became the movement&#x27;s unofficial organizer and bibliographer. He edited the Brotherhood&#x27;s literary magazine &quot;The Germ&quot; which published four issues in 1850. Rossetti wrote the poetry reviews for this magazine.

It was William Michael Rossetti who recorded the aims of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood at their founding meeting in September 1848:

#To have genuine ideas to express;
#To study Nature attentively, so as to know how to express them;
#To sympathize with what is direct and serious and heartfelt in previous art, to the exclusion of what is conventional and self-parading and learned by rote;
#And most indispensable of all, to produce thoroughly good pictures and statues.

Although Rossetti worked full-time as a civil servant, he maintained a prolific output of criticism and biography across a range of interests from Algernon Swinburne to James McNeill Whistler. He edited the diaries of his maternal uncle John William Polidori (author of &quot;The Vampyre&quot; and physician to Lord Byron), a comprehensive biography of D. G. Rossetti, and edited the collected works of D. G. Rossetti and Christina Rossetti.

Rossetti edited the first British edition of the poetry of Walt Whitman, which was published in 1868; however, this edition was bowdlerized.
Anne Gilchrist, who became one of the first to write about Whitman, first read his poetry from Rossetti&#x27;s edition, and Rossetti helped initiate their correspondence.

William Michael Rossetti was a major contributor to the 1911 edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;; his contributions on artistic subjects were criticised by many reviewers at the time and since, as showing little evidence of having absorbed the mounting body of work by academic art historians, mostly writing in German. Below is a quotation from his article on Fra Angelico demonstrating his literary and art-historical style:
The &quot;pietistic&quot; quality of Fra Angelico&#x27;s work is in fact its predominant characteristic. The faces of his figures have an air of rapt suavity, devotional fervency and beaming esoteric consciousness, which is intensely attractive to some minds ... the faces becoming sleek and prim, with a smirk of sexless religiosity which hardly eludes the artificial or even the hypocritical; because of this, there are some who are not moved by his work. Even so, Fra Angelico is a notable artist within his sphere.

==Personal life==

In 1874 he married Lucy Madox Brown, daughter of the painter Ford Madox Brown. They honeymooned in France and Italy. Their first child, Olivia Frances Madox, was born in September 1875, and her birth was celebrated in an ode of Swinburne&#x27;s. A son, Gabriel Arthur, was born in February 1877, followed by another daughter, Helen Maria, in November 1879, and twins, Mary Elizabeth and Michael Ford, in April 1881. Rossetti and his wife did not have the children baptized, nor were they raised in a Christian household. The children were schooled at home by their mother and governesses.

Their son Michael died in infancy. In 1897, Olivia married an Italian anarchist refugee, Antonio Agresti. They later moved to Italy, where Olivia became a translator and writer. After she was widowed in 1926, she became an associate of Ezra Pound, and the two corresponded frequently. Gabriel Arthur, known as Arthur to the family, became a scientist, married Dora Lewis, and had several children. Helen became a painter of miniatures, and in 1903 married Gastone Angeli. He was in fragile health and died only a few months later. Helen gave birth to his posthumous daughter, Imogen Lucy, in 1904. In 1903, Helen and Olivia also published &quot;A Girl Among the Anarchists&quot; under the pseudonym &#x27;Isabel Meredith&#x27;; the novel is a fictional recounting of their experiences in the anarchist movement.

William Michael Rossetti died on 5 February 1919 aged 89 and is buried in the Rossetti family grave on the west side of Highgate Cemetery. In the grave he joined his father, mother, Elizabeth Siddal (wife of his brother Dante) and his sister Christina. The ashes of his son Gabriel Arthur Maddox were interred in the grave in 1932 and three other members of the Rossetti family have also been buried there subsequently.

<doc id="889936" wikidata="Q245457" url="?curid=889936" title="Circulant matrix">
<text>In linear algebra, a circulant matrix is a square matrix in which all rows are composed of the same elements and each row is rotated one element to the right relative to the preceding row. It is a particular kind of Toeplitz matrix.

In numerical analysis, circulant matrices are important because they are diagonalized by a discrete Fourier transform, and hence linear equations that contain them may be quickly solved using a fast Fourier transform. They can be interpreted analytically as the integral kernel of a convolution operator on the cyclic group formula_1 and hence frequently appear in formal descriptions of spatially invariant linear operations. This property is also critical in modern software defined radios, which utilize Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing to spread the symbols (bits) using a cyclic prefix. This enables the channel to be represented by a circulant matrix, simplifying channel equalization in the frequency domain.

In cryptography, a circulant matrix is used in the MixColumns step of the Advanced Encryption Standard.

==Definition==

An formula_2 circulant matrix formula_3 takes the form
formula_4
or the transpose of this form (by choice of notation). If each formula_5 is a formula_6 square matrix, then the formula_7 matrix formula_3 is called a block-circulant matrix.

A circulant matrix is fully specified by one vector, formula_9, which appears as the first column (or row) of formula_3. The remaining columns (and rows, resp.) of formula_3 are each cyclic permutations of the vector formula_9 with offset equal to the column (or row, resp.) index, if lines are indexed from formula_13 to formula_14. (Cyclic permutation of rows has the same effect as cyclic permutation of columns.) The last row of formula_3 is the vector formula_9 shifted by one in reverse.

Different sources define the circulant matrix in different ways, for example as above, or with the vector formula_9 corresponding to the first row rather than the first column of the matrix; and possibly with a different direction of shift (which is sometimes called an anti-circulant matrix).

The polynomial formula_18 is called the &quot;associated polynomial&quot; of the matrix formula_3.

== Properties ==

=== Eigenvectors and eigenvalues ===

The normalized eigenvectors of a circulant matrix are the Fourier modes, namely,
formula_20
where formula_21 is a primitive formula_22-th root of unity and formula_23 is the imaginary unit.

(This can be understood by realizing that multiplication with a circulant matrix implements a convolution. In Fourier space, convolutions become multiplication. Hence the product of a circulant matrix with a Fourier mode yields a multiple of that Fourier mode, i.e. it is an eigenvector.)

The corresponding eigenvalues are given by
formula_24

=== Determinant ===

As a consequence of the explicit formula for the eigenvalues above, 
the determinant of a circulant matrix can be computed as:
formula_25
Since taking the transpose does not change the eigenvalues of a matrix, an equivalent formulation is
formula_26

=== Rank ===

The rank of a circulant matrix formula_3 is equal to formula_28 where formula_29 is the degree of the polynomial formula_30.

=== Other properties ===

* Any circulant is a matrix polynomial (namely, the associated polynomial) in the cyclic permutation matrix formula_31: formula_32 where formula_31 is given by the companion matrix formula_34
* The set of formula_2 circulant matrices forms an formula_22-dimensional vector space with respect to addition and scalar multiplication. This space can be interpreted as the space of functions on the cyclic group of order formula_22, formula_1, or equivalently as the group ring of formula_1.
* Circulant matrices form a commutative algebra, since for any two given circulant matrices formula_40 and formula_41, the sum formula_42 is circulant, the product formula_43 is circulant, and formula_44.
* For a nonsingular circulant matrix formula_40, its inverse formula_46 is also circulant. For a singular circulant matrix, its Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse formula_47 is circulant.
* The discrete Fourier transform matrix of order formula_22 is defined as by
formula_49
There are important connections between circulant matrices and the DFT matrices. In fact, it can be shown that 
formula_50 where formula_9 is the first column of formula_3. The eigenvalues of formula_3 are given by the product formula_54. This product can be readily calculated by a fast Fourier transform.
*Let formula_55 be the (monic) characteristic polynomial of an formula_2 circulant matrix formula_3. Then the scaled derivative formula_58 is the characteristic polynomial of the following formula_59 submatrix of formula_3: formula_61 (see for the proof).

==Analytic interpretation==
Circulant matrices can be interpreted geometrically, which explains the connection with the discrete Fourier transform.

Consider vectors in formula_62 as functions on the integers with period formula_22, (i.e., as periodic bi-infinite sequences: formula_64) or equivalently, as functions on the cyclic group of order formula_22 (denoted formula_1 or formula_67) geometrically, on (the vertices of) the regular: this is a discrete analog to periodic functions on the real line or circle.

Then, from the perspective of operator theory, a circulant matrix is the kernel of a discrete integral transform, namely the convolution operator for the function formula_68; this is a discrete circular convolution. The formula for the convolution of the functions formula_69 is
: formula_70
(recall that the sequences are periodic)
which is the product of the vector formula_71 by the circulant matrix for formula_72.

The discrete Fourier transform then converts convolution into multiplication, which in the matrix setting corresponds to diagonalization.

The formula_73-algebra of all circulant matrices with complex entries is isomorphic to the group formula_73-algebra of formula_75

==Symmetric circulant matrices==
For a symmetric circulant matrix formula_3 one has the extra condition that formula_77. 
Thus it is determined by formula_78 elements. 
formula_79

The eigenvalues of any real symmetric matrix are real.
The corresponding eigenvalues formula_80 become:
formula_81
for formula_22 even, and
formula_83
for formula_22 odd, where formula_85 denotes the real part of formula_86.
This can be further simplified by using the fact that formula_87 and formula_88 depending on formula_89 even or odd.

Symmetric circulant matrices belong to the class of bisymmetric matrices.

==Hermitian circulant matrices==
The complex version of the circulant matrix, ubiquitous in communications theory, is usually Hermitian. In this case formula_90 and its determinant and all eigenvalues are real.

If &quot;n&quot; is even the first two rows necessarily takes the form
formula_91
in which the first element formula_92 in the top second half-row is real.

If &quot;n&quot; is odd we get
formula_93

Tee has discussed constraints on the eigenvalues for the Hermitian condition.

== Applications ==

===In linear equations===

Given a matrix equation
: formula_94
where formula_3 is a circulant matrix of size formula_22, we can write the equation as the circular convolution
formula_97
where formula_98 is the first column of formula_3, and the vectors formula_98, formula_101 and formula_102 are cyclically extended in each direction. Using the circular convolution theorem, we can use the discrete Fourier transform to transform the cyclic convolution into component-wise multiplication
formula_103
so that
formula_104

This algorithm is much faster than the standard Gaussian elimination, especially if a fast Fourier transform is used.

=== In graph theory ===

In graph theory, a graph or digraph whose adjacency matrix is circulant is called a circulant graph/digraph. Equivalently, a graph is circulant if its automorphism group contains a full-length cycle. The Möbius ladders are examples of circulant graphs, as are the Paley graphs for fields of prime order.

<doc id="889940" wikidata="Q913170" url="?curid=889940" title="Trivial name">
<text>In chemistry, a trivial name is a non-systematic name for a chemical substance. That is, the name is not recognized according to the rules of any formal system of chemical nomenclature such as IUPAC inorganic or IUPAC organic nomenclature. A trivial name is not a formal name and is usually a common name.

Generally, trivial names are not useful in describing the essential properties of the thing being named. Properties such as the molecular structure of a chemical compound are not indicated. And, in some cases, trivial names can be ambiguous or will carry different meanings in different industries or in different geographic regions (for example, a trivial name such as &quot;white metal&quot; can mean various things). Trivial names are simpler. As a result, a limited number of trivial chemical names are retained names, an accepted part of the nomenclature.

Trivial names often arise in the common language; they may come from historic usages in, for example, alchemy. Many trivial names pre-date the institution of formal naming conventions. Names can be based on a property of the chemical, including appearance (color, taste or smell), consistency, and crystal structure; a place where it was found or where the discoverer comes from; the name of a scientist; a mythological figure; an astronomical body; the shape of the molecule; and even fictional figures. All elements that have been isolated have trivial names.

==Definitions==
In scientific documents, international treaties, patents and legal definitions, names for chemicals are needed that
identify them unambiguously. This need is satisfied by systematic names. One such system, established by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), was established in 1950. Other systems have been developed by the American Chemical Society, the International Organization for Standardization, and the World Health Organization. However, chemists still use many names that are not systematic because they are traditional or because they are more convenient than the systematic names. These are called &quot;trivial names&quot;. The word &quot;trivial&quot;, often used in a pejorative sense, was intended to mean &quot;commonplace&quot;.

In addition to trivial names, chemists have constructed &quot;semi-trivial names&quot; by appending a standard symbol to a trivial stem. Some trivial and semi-trivial names are so widely used that they have been officially adopted by IUPAC; these are known as &quot;retained names&quot;.

===Pesticide common names===

The common names used for pesticides did not become commonplace through repeated informal usage, The names are granted by ISO committee (TC81), who approve the common name according to ISO1750.

==Elements==

Traditional names of elements are trivial, some originating in alchemy. IUPAC has accepted these names, but has also defined systematic names of elements that have not yet been prepared. It has adopted a procedure by which the scientists who are credited with preparing an element can propose a new name. Once the IUPAC has accepted such a (trivial) name, it replaces the systematic name.

===Origins===

Nine elements were known by the Middle Ages: gold, silver, tin, mercury, copper, lead, iron, sulfur, and carbon. Mercury was named after the planet, but its symbol was derived from the Latin &quot;hydrargyrum&quot;, which itself comes from the Greek &quot;υδράργυρος&quot;, meaning liquid silver; mercury is also known as quicksilver in English. The symbols for the other eight are derived from their Latin names.

Systematic nomenclature began after Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau stated the need for &quot;a constant method of denomination, which helps the intelligence and relieves the memory&quot;. The resulting system was popularized by Antoine Lavoisier&#x27;s publication of &quot;Méthode de nomenclature chimique&quot; (Method of Chemical Nomenclature) in 1787. Lavoisier proposed that elements be named after their properties. For the next 125 years, most chemists followed this suggestion, using Greek and Latin roots to compose the names; for example, hydrogen (&quot;water-producing&quot;), oxygen (&quot;acid-producing&quot;), nitrogen (&quot;soda-producing&quot;), bromine (&quot;stink&quot;), and argon were based on Greek roots, while the names of iodine and chlorine were derived from the Greek words for their characteristic colors. Indium, rubidium, and thallium were similarly named for the colors of particular lines in their emission spectra. Iridium, which forms compounds of many different colors, takes its name from &quot;iris&quot;, the Latin for &quot;rainbow&quot;. The noble gases have all been named for their origin or properties. Helium comes from the Greek &quot;helios&quot;, meaning &quot;Sun&quot; because it was first detected as a line in the spectrum of the Sun (it is not known why the suffix &quot;-ium&quot;, which is used for metals, was chosen). The other noble gases are neon (&quot;new&quot;), argon (&quot;slow, lazy&quot;), krypton (&quot;hidden&quot;), xenon (&quot;stranger&quot;), and radon (&quot;from radium&quot;).

Many more elements have been given names that have little or nothing to do with their properties. Elements have been named for celestial bodies (helium, selenium, tellurium, for the Sun, Moon, and Earth; cerium and palladium for Ceres and Pallas, two asteroids). They have been named for mythological figures, including Titans in general (titanium) and Prometheus in particular (promethium); Roman and Greek gods (uranium, neptunium, and plutonium) and their descendants (tantalum for Tantalus, a son of Zeus, and niobium for Niobe, a daughter of Tantalus); and Norse deities (vanadium for the goddess Vanadis and thorium for the god Thor).

Some elements were named for aspects of the history of their discovery. In particular, technetium and promethium were so named because the first samples detected were artificially synthesised; neither of the two has any isotope sufficiently stable to occur in nature on Earth in significant quantities. The connection to the Titan Prometheus was that he had been fabled to have stolen fire from the gods for mankind.

Discoverers of some elements named them after their home country or city. Marie Curie named polonium after Poland; ruthenium, gallium, germanium, and lutetium were based on the Latin names for Russia, France, Germany, and Paris. Other elements are named after the place where they were discovered. Four elements — terbium, erbium, ytterbium, and yttrium — were named after the Swedish village Ytterby, where ores containing them were extracted. Other elements named after places are magnesium (after Magnesia), strontium, scandium, europium, thulium (after an old Roman name for an unidentified northern region), holmium, copper (derived from Cyprus, where it was mined in the Roman era), hafnium, rhenium, americium, berkelium, californium, and darmstadtium.

For the elements up to 92 (uranium), naming elements after people was discouraged. The two exceptions are indirect, the elements being named after minerals that were themselves named after people. These were gadolinium (found in gadolinite, named after the Finnish chemist Johan Gadolin) and samarium (the mineral samarskite was named after a Russian mining engineer, Vasili Samarsky-Bykhovets). Among the transuranium elements, this restriction was relaxed; there followed curium (after the Curies), einsteinium (Albert Einstein), fermium (Enrico Fermi), mendelevium (Dmitri Mendeleev), nobelium (Alfred Nobel) and lawrencium (Ernest Lawrence).

===Relation to IUPAC standards===

IUPAC has established international standards for naming elements. The first scientist or laboratory to isolate an element has the right to propose a name; after a review process, a final decision is made by the IUPAC Council. In keeping with tradition, names can be based on a mythological concept or character, astronomical object, mineral, place, property of the element or scientist. For those elements that have not yet been discovered, IUPAC has established a systematic name system. The names combine syllables that represent the digits of the atomic number, followed by &quot;-ium&quot;. For example, &quot;unununium&quot; is element 111 (&quot;un&quot; being the syllable for 1). However, once the element has been found, the systematic name is replaced by a trivial one, in this case roentgenium.

The IUPAC names for elements are intended for use in the official languages. At the time of the first edition of the IUPAC Red Book (which contains the rules for inorganic compounds), those languages were English and French; now English is the sole official language. However, other languages still have their own names for elements. The chemical symbol for tungsten, W, is based on the German name , which is found in wolframite and comes from the German for &quot;wolf&#x27;s foam&quot;, how the mineral was known to Saxon miners. The name &quot;tungsten&quot; means &quot;heavy stone&quot;, a description of scheelite, another mineral in which tungsten is found. Russian names for hydrogen, oxygen and carbon are &quot;vodorod&quot;, &quot;kislorod&quot; and &quot;uglerod&quot; (generating water, acid and coal respectively). The German names for hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are (water substance), (acid substance), and (smothering substance). 
The corresponding Chinese names are &quot;qīngqì&quot; (light gas), &quot;yǎngqì&quot; (nourishing gas), and &quot;dànqì&quot; (diluting gas). A method for translating chemical names into Chinese was developed by John Fryer and Xu Shou in 1871. Where traditional names were well established, they kept them; otherwise, a single character was created.

==Inorganic chemistry==

Early terminology for compound chemicals followed similar rules to the naming of elements. The names could be based on the appearance of the substance, including all five senses. In addition, chemicals were named after the consistency, crystalline form, a person or place, its putative medical properties or method of preparation.

Salt (sodium chloride) is soluble and is used to enhance the taste of food. Substances with similar properties came to be known as salts, in particular &quot;Epsom salt&quot; (magnesium sulfate, found in a bitter saline spring in the English town of Epsom). Ammonium (with the little-used systematic name azanium) was first extracted from sal ammoniac, meaning &quot;salt of Amun&quot;. Ancient Romans noticed crystals of it in Egyptian temples devoted to the god Amun; the crystals had condensed from the smoke of burning camel dung. Lead acetate was called &quot;sugar of lead&quot;. However, other names like &quot;sugar of lead&quot; (lead(II) acetate), &quot;butter of antimony&quot; (antimony trichloride), &quot;oil of vitriol&quot; (sulfuric acid), and &quot;cream of tartar&quot; (potassium bitartrate) borrowed their language from the kitchen. Many more names were based on color; for example, hematite, orpiment, and verdigris come from words meaning &quot;blood-like stone&quot;, &quot;gold pigment&quot;, and &quot;green of Greece&quot;.

Some names are based on their use. Lime is a general name for materials combining calcium with carbonates, oxides or hydroxides; the name comes from a root &quot;sticking or adhering&quot;; its earliest use was as mortar for construction.

Water has several systematic names, including &quot;oxidane&quot; (the IUPAC name), &quot;hydrogen oxide&quot;, and &quot;dihydrogen monoxide&quot; (DHMO). The latter was the basis of the dihydrogen monoxide hoax, a document that was circulated warning readers of the dangers of the chemical (for example, it is fatal if inhaled).
==Organic chemistry==
In organic chemistry, some trivial names derive from a notable property of the thing being named. For instance, lecithin, the common name for phosphatidylcholine, was originally isolated from egg yolk. The word is coined from the Greek λέκιθος (lékithos) for &quot;yolk&quot;.

Many trivial names continue to be used because their sanctioned equivalents are considered too cumbersome for everyday use. For example, &quot;tartaric acid&quot;, a compound found in wine, has a systematic name of 2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic acid. The pigment β-Carotene has an IUPAC name of 1,3,3-trimethyl-2-[(1&quot;E&quot;,3&quot;E&quot;,5&quot;E&quot;,7&quot;E&quot;,9&quot;E&quot;,11&quot;E&quot;,13&quot;E&quot;,15&quot;E&quot;,17&quot;E&quot;)-3,7,12,16-tetramethyl-18-(2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexen-1-yl)octadeca-1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17-nonaenyl]cyclohexene. However, the trivial name can be potentially confusing. Based on its name, one might come to the conclusion that the molecule theobromine contains one or more bromine atoms. In reality it is an alkaloid similar in structure to caffeine.
===Shape-based===
Several organic molecules have semitrivial names where the suffixes &quot;-ane&quot; (for an alkane) or &quot;-ene&quot; (for an alkene) are added to a name based on the shape of the molecule. Some are pictured below. Other examples include barrelene (shaped like a barrel), fenestrane (having a window-pane motif), ladderane (a ladder shape), olympiadane (having a shape with the same topology as the Olympic rings) and quadratic acid (also known as squaric acid).

===Based on fiction===

The bohemic acid complex is a mixture of chemicals obtained through fermentation of a species of actinobacteria. In 1977 the components were isolated and have been found useful as antitumor agents and anthracycline antibiotics. The authors named the complex (and one of its components, bohemamine) after the opera &quot;La bohème&quot; by Puccini, and the remaining components were named after characters in the opera: alcindoromycin (Alcindoro), collinemycin (Colline), marcellomycin (Marcello), mimimycin (Mimi), musettamycin (Musetta), rudolphomycin (Rodolfo) and schaunardimycin (Schaunard). However, the relationships between the characters do not correctly reflect the chemical relationships.

A research lab at Lepetit Pharmaceuticals, led by Piero Sensi, was fond of coining nicknames for chemicals that they discovered, later converting them to a form more acceptable for publication. The antibiotic rifampicin was named after a French movie, &quot;Rififi&quot;, about a jewel heist. They nicknamed another antibiotic &quot;Mata Hari&quot; before changing the name to &quot;matamycin&quot;.

Books

&quot;Dark Disciple&quot;

The Jedi Council meets to discuss the devastation the Clone Wars are wreaking on the galaxy. They come to the conclusion that Count Dooku, the leader of the treasonous Confederacy of Independent Systems, must die, and they devise a plan to assassinate him. The Council selects Asajj Ventress, Dooku&#x27;s former disciple and personal assassin, and team her up with Vos. Even though Ventress has good cause to distrust the Jedi, the Council thinks that if given the right encouragement, her animosity for Dooku, who tried to have her killed once she had outlived her usefulness to him, may lead her to act against her former master.

Dark Horse Republic comics

Quinlan Vos is the main protagonist in the Dark Horse Star Wars: Republic comics set during the Clone Wars. Written by John Ostrander. Illustrated by Jan Duursema.

<text>The Growth of Biological Thought (992 pages, Belknap Press, ) is a book written by Ernst Mayr, first published in 1982. It is subtitled Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance, and is as much a book of philosophy and history as it is of biology.

It is a sweeping, academic study of the first 2,400 years of the science of biology. It focuses largely on how the philosophical assumptions of biologists influenced and limited their understanding. It includes many important general observations about the role of philosophy in scientific inquiry and the place of biology amongst the sciences.

<text>The Chinese High School () was an independent school in Singapore offering secondary education. The school merged with Hwa Chong Junior College on 1 January 2005 to form the integrated Hwa Chong Institution.

Founded on 21 March 1919, The Chinese High School was the first high school in Southeast Asia to cater to different dialect groups among overseas Chinese in the region. After Singapore gained independence in 1965, the school came under the purview of the Ministry of Education and was accorded the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) status in 1979. It has the unique distinction of having the Independent School status in 1988, a scheme that the ministry perceived had proven successful and was extended to other top schools in Singapore. The Chinese High School remained as one of the best performing schools in Singapore, both in academic achievements and extracurricular activities.

==History==
=== Founding ===
As early as May 1913, Tan Kah Kee, a prominent businessman, proposed setting up a secondary school for Chinese boys in Singapore. Tan&#x27;s proposal was supported by the Tung Teh Reading Club and a dance troupe, claiming to have raised S$20,000 as funds for building the school. On 21 March 1919, the Singapore Nanyang Overseas Chinese Middle School was formally opened at Niven Road with an enrolment of 78 students. Six years later, with an additional funding of S$600,000, the school moved to its new campus at Bukit Timah Road, covering an area of , and officially renamed The Chinese High School.

After its founding, the school offered comprehensive secondary level Chinese education. It continued to be funded and supported by Tan Kah Kee until shortly before World War II. The school was temporarily closed in February 1933 when all the teachers resigned. Later in February 1934, the school was reopened with a new principal and staff. In the same year, Lee Kong Chian, son-in-law of Tan Kah Kee, became the chairperson of the school&#x27;s management board, and he held the post until 1957. During Lee&#x27;s tenure, the school almost closed several times due to financial difficulties, but managed to survive due to strong financial support from both Tan and Lee.

=== Turbulent years ===
During the Battle of Singapore, the school&#x27;s clock tower, for its height and vantage point, served as a headquarters for the Allied defenders and later for the Imperial Japanese Army during the Japanese occupation of Singapore. The school also served as a temporary concentration camp to detain people for examination during the Sook Ching massacre. After the war, the school resumed its predominant Chinese education. 

In the 1950s and 1960s, during periods of civil unrest in Singapore, many students, teachers and alumni participated in or led the anti-colonial riots. A number of students were arrested by police during the riots, and some were expelled by the school. On 13 May 1953, TCHS students made an impromptu march to the Singapore city centre in protest over arrests of their fellow schoolmates. They subsequently barricaded themselves at the TCHS campus, and were soon caught in violent confrontations with the police. The situation was finally defused after the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Lee Kong Chian, flew back from London and mediated a resolution between student leaders and the police. 

In 1961, another major demonstration occurred when Secondary Four students refused to sit for government examinations, when it was announced Singapore would switch to the &quot;four-two&quot; system, where the national examination was moved to be after the completion of four years of secondary education. Singapore schools including TCHS had previously utilised the &quot;three-three&quot; system. In 1967, a group of students attacked then-Vice Principal Teh Kim Fatt on the campus, prompting then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew to visit him in the hospital. Teh would later become Principal, but resigned in February 1972 over discourse with the student population.

The national trend in Singapore was that schools began pursuing English as the medium of education. As workplaces switched to English as working language, a Chinese education became greatly devalued. In fact, it was reported that job applicants preferred to show their &#x27;O&#x27; Level certificates, rather than present a university degree from Chinese-medium universities such as Nanyang University. This contributed to a slide in TCHS&#x27; fortunes, and it was reported the school, like many other Chinese-medium schools, had been on the brink of closure. According to Tooh Fee San, then a sitting board member on the Ministry of Education&#x27;s sports board, &quot;nobody bothered to listen...to the reports from Hwa Zhong&quot;. On 12 December 1978, Tooh became TCHS&#x27; new Principal, and he would be in charge for the introduction of the Special Assistance Plan.

=== Transformation ===
Upon the appointment of Tooh as Principal in 1978, The Chinese High School became one of the first nine schools to be part of the Special Assistance Plan. The Ministry of Education conceived the SAP as a means of providing assistance to struggling Chinese-medium schools. Under the SAP, key subjects such as mathematics and science were to be taught in English, in line with the rest of the nation, while some other subjects such as music and art could still be taught in Chinese. 

Tooh also turned his focus on raising school morale, and chose the poem &quot;Whole River Red&quot; (满江红), written by the famed general Yue Fei, to be sung by the school population. During Tooh&#x27;s tenure, TCHS emerged as the dominant force in the school track-and-field scene. In most years, TCHS was able to sweep both the &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;C&#x27; divisions of the track-and-field competition, and was often the only school to send all its students to the National Stadium to support school athletes.

In 1987, the school was granted the status of an independent school by the Ministry of Education and proceeded to implement changes to its curriculum that were unprecedented in other Singapore schools. The changes include the abolition of mid-year examinations in favour of camping trips for the school, as well as the introduction of numerous enrichment programmes in place of lessons.

In the early 1990s, the school underwent an extensive renovation, which saw the construction of a new hall, named after the school&#x27;s founder, a gymnasium, a renovated clock tower block and new classrooms. A Drama Centre was also constructed, catering to the school&#x27;s performing arts groups. In the late 1990s, the school embarked on a consortium scheme to improve the quality of education for students. It started with the establishment of the Quest and Aphelion consortiums, followed by ProEd and Radix. In 2000, the iSpark consortium was set up for students in the Gifted Education Programme (GEP). In 2002, Quest and Radix merged to form the Ortus consortium.

On 19th March 1999, the school&#x27;s clock tower was gazetted as a national monument to mark the significance of the institution as the first Chinese medium school to be built in Southeast Asia to cater to the education of overseas Chinese. Two days later, on 21st March, the school held a large dinner in front of the Clock Tower in celebration of TCHS&#x27; 80th anniversary of founding. At the dinner, which was attended by alumnus and then-President Ong Teng Cheong, a statue of school founder Tan Kah Kee was erected. The same year, Tooh retired as the longest-serving Principal in TCHS history, having been Principal for 21 years. He was succeeded by Koh Yong Chiah, who was then succeeded by Hon Chiew Weng in 2002.

=== Merger ===
On 1 January 2005, The Chinese High School merged with Hwa Chong Junior College to form Hwa Chong Institution. The new institution retains the Chinese name and the logo of The Chinese High School. Along with the merger, a six-year Integrated Programme is introduced in collaboration with Nanyang Girls&#x27; High School. The new scheme, which integrates four years of high school education and two years of pre-university education, allows students to skip the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level examination (typically taken by students in secondary four) and proceed to take the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examination at the end of the programme. 
=== List of Principals ===
==Achievements==
 Each year, the school attracted the best performing 3% of the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) cohort.

The school was also the first one in Singapore to initiate the Integrated Programme. It is the current high-school section in Hwa Chong Institution. The college section of the institution is the former Hwa Chong Junior College, a co-educational sister school.

Other educational institutions that stand on the school&#x27;s grounds include the former Hwa Chong Junior College and the Singapore Institute of Management.

<doc id="889951" wikidata="Q4580264" url="?curid=889951" title="1982, Janine">
<text>1982, Janine is a novel by the Scottish author Alasdair Gray. His second, it was published in 1984, and remains his most controversial work. Its use of pornography as a narrative device attracted much criticism, although others, including Gray himself, consider it his best work.

== Plot summary ==
The novel is narrated by Jock McLeish, a supervisor of the installation of alarm systems. Divorced, alcoholic and approaching fifty, his problems coalesce in a long night of the soul in a hotel room in Peebles or Selkirk.

McLeish attempts to spend the night assembling an intricate pornographic fantasy. His cast of characters includes: Janine, based on a childhood memory of Jane Russell in &quot;The Outlaw&quot;; Superb (short for Superbitch); and Big Momma, an obese lesbian. All of these are submitted to sadomasochistic practices, parts of which are described at some length. However, McLeish constantly returns to reminiscences of his previous life and lovers. These prompt his attempted suicide. Chapter 11 of the novel is a typographical explosion, with the text splitting into several parallel voices on each page (including that of God). The crisis concludes with McLeish vomiting up the pills which he had hoped would kill him, and facing the truth of his actions as morning dawns.

== Literary significance &amp; criticism ==
On the first hardback and paperback editions, Gray wrote that &quot;This already dated novel is set inside the head of an ageing, divorced, alcoholic, insomniac supervisor of security installations who is tippling in the bedroom of a small Scottish hotel. Though full of depressing memories and propaganda for the Conservative Party it is mainly a sadomasochistic fetishistic fantasy. Even the arrival of God in the later chapters fails to elevate the tone. Every stylistic excess and moral defect which critics conspired to ignore in the author&#x27;s first books, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Unlikely Stories, Mostly&quot;, is to be found here in concentrated form.&quot; In a 2000 interview, Gray said &quot;When writing the pornographic parts of &quot;1982, Janine&quot; I was deliberately shocking myself. Though I think it my best novel I cannot now reread it - I&#x27;m back to being as old fashioned as I was before imagining it.&quot;
&quot;1982, Janine&quot; polarised critics like few other novels in modern literary history. The paperback edition of the novel concludes with an appendix of criticism of the work, both for and against. Critics praising the work included Jonathan Baumbach in &quot;The New York Times&quot; (&quot;1982 Janine has a verbal energy, an intensity of vision&quot;) and William Boyd in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; (&quot;His style is limpid and classically elegant&quot;). The Boyd quotation is juxtaposed with one from Paul Ableman in &quot;The Literary Review&quot; criticising the &quot;irritating mannerisms&quot;. Peter Levi on the BBC called the book &quot;Radioactive hogwash&quot;, while Joe Ambrose of the Irish &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; (who has expressed virulently critical views on many of Gray&#x27;s books) called the author &quot;a vainglorious lout&quot; and &quot;a profoundly reactionary penman&quot;. J.A. McArdle, in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; wrote: &quot;I have read reviews of these books which makes me suspect that the commentators had never read them. &quot;1982, Janine&quot; is not pornography but a thoughtful and sad study of the human predicament; to be trapped in a world where the little man, woman or country will always be exploited by the big bullies.&quot;

In an introduction to the 2003 Canongate Classic edition, Will Self argues that the controversial pornographic fantasies illustrate McLeish&#x27;s repression of his past real love affairs, reflect his reactionary political stance, and show the effects of his childhood experiences. McLeish&#x27;s linking of sex with the idea of &quot;homecoming&quot; originates in his difficult relationship with his mother.

Self also notes the significance of the title, 1982 being &quot;a point at which Scotland could be said to have reached just one of its many nadirs&quot;. This lowpoint included the destruction of the coal industry which had employed McLeish&#x27;s father, under a Conservative government of which McLeish is a supporter.

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;1982, Janine&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #55, and stated that &quot;God and several SF themes make guest appearances, and there&#x27;s a chapter of the most boggling typography since early Alfred Bester. This one knocked me flat.&quot;

<doc id="889959" wikidata="Q15069182" url="?curid=889959" title="Hem">
<text>A hem in sewing is a garment finishing method, where the edge of a piece of cloth is folded and sewn to prevent unravelling of the fabric and to adjust the length of the piece in garments, such as at the end of the sleeve or the bottom of the garment.

==Methods==

There are many different styles of hems of varying complexities. The most common hem folds up a cut edge, folds it up again, and then sew it down. The style of hemming thus completely encloses the cut edge in cloth, so that it cannot unravel. Other hem styles use fewer folds. One of the simplest hems encloses the edge of cloth with a stitch without any folds at all, using a method called an overcast stitch, although an overcast stitch may be used to finish a folded &quot;plain hem&quot; as well.

There are even hems that do not call for sewing, instead using iron-on materials, netting, plastic clips, or other fasteners. These threadless hems are not common, and are often used only on a temporary basis.

The hem may be sewn down with a line of invisible stitches or blind stitch, or sewn down by a sewing machine. The term &quot;hem&quot; is also extended to other cloth treatments that prevent unraveling. Hems can be serged (see serger), hand rolled and then sewn down with tiny stitches (still seen as a high-class finish to handkerchiefs), pinked with pinking shears, piped, covered with binding (this is known as a Hong Kong finish), or made with many other inventive treatments.

Most haute couture hems are sewn by hand. Decorative embroidery embellishment is sometimes referred to as a hem-stitch design.

==Types of hems and hem stitches==
A variety of hem types exist because there are so many different fabric types and garment styles. Common types of hems include:
* Double-folded hem
* Overlocked and folded hem
* Rolled hem
* Bias tape hem
* Blind hem

Hems of different depths (which includes the seam allowance) may have a particular style to achieve, which requires more or less fabric depending upon the style. A handkerchief-style edge requires a hem allowance of . A typical skirt or pant hem may be . The hem&#x27;s depth affects the way the fabric of the finished fabric will drape. Heavier fabric requires a relatively shorter hem. An interface fabric sewn to the fabric in the hem has a useful function in some hem styles. A bias strip is sometimes used as a hem interface. This adds fullness to the finished garment and reduce wrinkling.

The hem stitches that are commonly used for hand-sewn hems include: pick stitch; catch stitch (also called a &quot;herringbone stitch&quot;); slip stitch; and blind stitch.

Sewing machines can make a stitch that appears nearly invisible by using a blind-stitch setting and a blind stitch foot. Blind-stitches are commonly used to finish hems of applique designs on fabric. Modern sewing machines designed for home use can make many decorative or functional stitches, so the number of possible hem treatments is large. These home-use machines can also sew a reasonable facsimile of a hem-stitch, though the stitches will usually be larger and more visible.

Clothing factories and professional tailors use a &quot;blind hemmer&quot;, or hemming machine, which sews an invisible stitch quickly and accurately. A blind hemmer sews a chain stitch, using a bent needle, which can be set precisely enough to actually sew through one and a half thicknesses of the hemmed fabric. A rolled hem presser foot on a sewing machine enables quick and easy hemming even by home sewers.

Heavy material with deep hems may be hemmed with what is called a &quot;dressmaker&#x27;s hem&quot;—an extra line of loose running stitch is added in the middle of the hem, so that all the weight of the cloth does not hang from one line of stitching.

==Hem repair==

Hem repair tape is a type of non-woven fusible interfacing available as a continuous, thin length. It is designed for use as an alternative solution to sewing or fixing a hem. To affect a fix, the hem repair tape is laid around the inside of the hem. It is then ironed on a high heat; the heat causes the tape to bond the two surfaces together.

<doc id="889961" wikidata="Q463026" url="?curid=889961" title="Contour crafting">
<text>Contour crafting is a building printing technology being researched by Behrokh Khoshnevis of the University of Southern California&#x27;s Information Sciences Institute (in the Viterbi School of Engineering) that uses a computer-controlled crane or gantry to build edifices rapidly and efficiently with substantially less manual labor. It was originally conceived as a method to construct molds for industrial parts. Khoshnevis decided to adapt the technology for rapid home construction as a way to rebuild after natural disasters, like the devastating earthquakes that have plagued his native Iran.

Using a quick-setting, concrete-like material, contour crafting forms the house&#x27;s walls layer by layer until topped off by floors and ceilings set in place by the crane. The notional concept calls for the insertion of structural components, plumbing, wiring, utilities, and even consumer devices like audiovisual systems as the layers are built.

==History==

Caterpillar Inc. provided funding to help support Viterbi project research in the summer of 2008.

In 2009, Singularity University graduate students established a project with Khoshnevis as the CTO to commercialize Contour Crafting. The project was named &quot;ACASA&quot;.

In 2010, Khoshnevis claimed that his system could build a complete home in a single day, and its electrically powered crane would produce very little construction material waste. 

Construction of a standard wood-framed house is estimated to create an average of 3-7 tons of waste. Use of contour crafting could significantly reduce environmental impact as it wastes no material at all. In addition, contour crafting does not generate noise, dust or make harmful emissions to the environment given the equipment that is used.

Khoshnevis stated in 2010 that NASA was evaluating Contour Crafting for its application in the construction of bases on Mars and the Moon.
After three years, in 2013, NASA funded a small study at the University of Southern California to further develop the &quot;Contour Crafting&quot; 3D printing technique. Potential applications of this technology include constructing lunar structures of a material that could be built of 90-percent lunar material with only ten percent of the material transported from Earth.

In 2017 the Contour Crafting Corporation (of which Khoshnevis is the CEO) announced a partnership with and investment from Doka Ventures. In the press release, they claim that they &quot;will start delivery of the first printers early next year&quot;.

<doc id="889965" wikidata="Q3107910" url="?curid=889965" title="Giuliano Zaccardelli">
<text>Giuliano Zaccardelli (born ) is an Italian-born Canadian retired police officer who served as the 20th commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) from 2000 to 2006. His departure from the RCMP was linked to the force&#x27;s involvement in the Maher Arar affair. Zaccardelli was later impugned during inquiries into irregularities in the management of the RCMP&#x27;s pension and insurance fund. He subsequently became a senior official with Interpol in Lyon, France, heading its OASIS Africa program,
which aims to help African police forces more effectively combat international crime.

== Life and career ==
Zaccardelli was born in Prezza, Italy, and immigrated to Canada at age seven.

He joined the RCMP in 1970 and was posted to St. Paul, Alberta, following recruit training. He was transferred to Toronto in 1974, and then in 1981 to Calgary. He became an officer in 1986 and served in Ottawa and New Brunswick.

In 1993, Zaccardelli became Chief Superintendent in charge of Criminal Operations in Quebec. In 1995, he was promoted to Assistant Commissioner, then to Deputy Commissioner in 1998, responsible for National Headquarters. In 1999, he became the Deputy Commissioner, Organized Crime and Operational Policy. From 2 September 2000 to 15 December 2006, he served as the 20th Commissioner of the RCMP. He presided over the RCMP during changes made to Canada&#x27;s policing, security and military apparatus after 11 September 2001. Prior to his departure, he collected numerous Canadian honours and two foreign honours.

=== Income trust file ===
In late 2005, the status of income trusts was uncertain. After the close of the markets on 23 November 2005, Finance Minister Ralph Goodale made a surprise announcement that the government would not tax the trusts, and would instead cut dividend taxes. This made trusts and dividend paying stocks even from a taxation perspective. The markets rallied in the hours leading up to the announcement by the government allegedly due to leaks. During the following days, the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index reached a new five-year high. The day&#x27;s biggest gainers were income trusts, income-trust candidates, high dividend-paying companies, and the TSX Group itself. The minority Liberal government of Paul Martin fell to a motion of no confidence on 28 November 2005. An election campaign for a 23 January 2006 election began the next day. Near the end of December, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced a criminal investigation into the leaking of news of a federal tax change for income trusts. The announcement came in the form of a letter from Zaccardelli to New Democratic Party Member of Parliament Judy Wasylycia-Leis. The RCMP came under criticism for announcing the probe during the campaign. The matter was investigated by the Commission for Public Complaints Against the RCMP (CPC), the external review body of RCMP members&#x27; conduct. The report of the commissioner concluded that there was no evidence to suggest Zaccardelli deliberately meddled with the electoral process. The chair of the CPC judged Zaccardelli and other RCMP members having acted in an &quot;inappropriate&quot; manner by not cooperating with the external investigation.

=== Maher Arar file ===
Zaccardelli&#x27;s role in the affair of computer engineer, Maher Arar had been the subject of intense speculation and controversy. Arar, a Canadian citizen who was born in Syria, was stopped at a New York airport on his way home from a vacation in September 2002. United States officials accused him of links to al-Qaeda and deported him to Syria, where he was imprisoned and tortured for months. The decision to deport Arar was said to be based on inaccurate and misleading information provided by the RCMP that suggested Arar was linked to the militants. Members of the House of Commons Committee on Public Safety and National Security have called Zaccardelli&#x27;s testimony in this matter &quot;contradictory&quot;, with Liberal MP Mark Holland saying &quot;We&#x27;ve now got Mr. Zaccardelli in my opinion perjuring himself before a parliamentary committee.&quot; The contradictions were with respect to what he knew at the time and what he told government ministers. Zaccardelli resigned from his post as Commissioner on 6 December, effective 15 December 2006. Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced in the House of Commons that Zaccardelli had resigned. &quot;Today, Commissioner Zaccardelli submitted his resignation to me and I have accepted it,&quot; Harper said. &quot;The commissioner has indicated to me that it would be in the best interests of the RCMP to have new leadership as this great organization faces challenges in the future.&quot; Zaccardelli became the first commissioner in the history of the RCMP to be forced to resign because of controversy.

Before Zaccardelli&#x27;s resignation, on 28 September 2006, he issued an apology to Arar and his family during the House of Commons committee on public safety and national security:
Mr. Arar, I wish to take this opportunity to express publicly to you and to your wife and to your children how truly sorry I am for whatever part the actions of the RCMP may have contributed to the terrible injustices that you experienced and the pain that you and your family endured.

Arar thanked Commissioner Zaccardelli for his apology but lamented the lack of concrete disciplinary action against those individuals whose actions led to his detention and subsequent torture.

=== RCMP&#x27;s pension and insurance plans ===
In March 2007, RCMP officers testified before the Public Accounts Committee that they had grave questions about the handling of the funds and that they believed senior officers were to blame. They alleged fund misappropriation and nepotism and that senior RCMP management covered up the problems. In testimony before the committee, Zaccardelli rejected accusations that he was involved in a cover up of alleged irregularities, fraud and abuse involving the RCMP&#x27;s pension and insurance plans.

== Honours ==
Zaccardelli was awarded the following medals and commendations during his policing career:

<text>José Miguel Class Ponce (September 26, 1935 – April 13, 2017) was a Puerto Rican singer who garnered international fame during the 1960s and 1970s.

==Biography==

Nicknamed &quot;El Gallito de Manatí&quot; (&quot;Manati&#x27;s Bantam&quot;), Class achieved fame in Puerto Rico in the 1960s before moving to Mexico, where he achieved wide success. His period as a resident there proved important for his career: He released various Mexican music albums and he was able to achieve fame across Central America, South America and the rest of the Caribbean.

When Class returned to Puerto Rico during the decade of the &#x27;70s, he immediately landed a weekly television show in Rafael Perez Perry&#x27;s Channel 11, which he co-hosted with Awilda (Awilda La Mimosa) Pedrosa. His adopted Mexican accent was noticeable during the run of this show; as a matter of a fact, he kept the Mexican accent for a very long time. His catchphrase was &quot;Yo soy el Gallo!&quot; (&quot;I am the Rooster!&quot;) He retired to his hometown of Manati. He released over 20 albums, many of which have been converted into CD format. 

==Death==
Class died on the morning of April 13, 2017, aged 81 following a long illness at Auxilio Mutuo Hospital in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico.

<text>Pepe de Lucía (born José Sánchez Gomes; 25 September 1945 in Algeciras, Cádiz, Spain) is a Spanish flamenco singer and songwriter.

The son of flamenco guitarist Antonio Sánchez Pecino, and the brother of flamenco guitarists Paco de Lucía and Ramón de Algeciras, he adopted the stage name &quot;Pepe de Lucía&quot; in honor of his Portuguese mother, Lúcia Gomes. He is the father of Spanish pop singer Malú. He released his debut recording, &quot;Los Chiquitos de Algeciras&quot;, with his brother Paco de Lucía in 1961. He continued to sing on his brother&#x27;s albums until 1988, when he was replaced by Duquende. His son, José de Lucía is also a flamenco musician, like his uncles, father and grandfather. 

He is noted to have written many of the lyrics performed by Camarón de la Isla on his albums with Paco de Lucía and Tomatito. An example of one of these songs is Sentao en el Valle on the album Como el Agua.

<text>Vittorio Bottego (; Parma, 29 July 1860 – Dhaga Roba, 17 March 1897) was an Italian army officer and one of the first Western explorers of Jubaland and southern Ethiopia, where he led two expeditions. He was the first European explorer to follow the course of the lower Omo River to its confluence with Lake Turkana and to reach Lake Abaya, which he renamed &quot;Lake Margherita&quot; after Queen Margherita of Savoy wife of King Humbert I of Italy.

==Expeditions==
In his first expedition Bottego concentrated on tracing the channels of the tributaries of the Ganale Doria, that he named after the Italian biologist Giacomo Doria. With Captain Matteo Grixoni, Bottego left Bardera on 30 September 1892, with one hundred and twenty-four men. They reached the Shebeli River at Imi on 7 November. After eight days they crossed the river, entering the country of the Arsi Oromo, who proved hostile to Bottego. He passed through Arkebla and reached the Ganale Guracha (&quot;Black Ganale&quot;) on 11 December, along whose banks he led his men upstream for 20 days.

Concluding that this was not the main stream of the river, Bottego left the river in a west-south-western direction until he reached the Ganale Doria, or the main fork of the Ganale, on 16 January 1893. Sick with fever, here Bottego was left by Grixoni who marched for the coast on 15 February with 30 men. Four days after Grixoni left, Bottego pushed inland as far as Mount Fakes, but unwilling to encounter raiding parties of the Ethiopians, he returned to the camp where Grixoni had left him. Bottego then crossed the tract separating him from the Dawa, and ascended that river until lack of provisions compelled him to retrace his steps. His party reached the Ganale Doria once more after six forced marches, in the course of which eleven men died of hunger. Two more died in camp from exhaustion, and two were drowned while hunting hippopotamuses.

In his second expedition (1895–1897), Bottego ventured into the then unknown region of the upper Juba, Lake Rudolf and the Sobat. He was the first European explorer to follow the course of the lower Omo River to its confluence with Lake Turkana. He reached and first found Lake Abaya, which he renamed &quot;Lake Margherita&quot; after Queen Margherita of Savoy wife of King Humbert I of Italy.

He then tried to return through Ethiopia, unaware that the country was at war with Italy, let alone that there had been a recent Ethiopian victory at Adwa. He was killed in the Ahmar Mountains near Daga Roba when he was attacked by an Oromo tribe. His body was never recovered, and the account of his demise was told years later by two of his companions, Vannutelli and Citerni, who survived but were kept in prison for two years by Menelik II, emperor of Ethiopia.

==Species named after Bottego==
Bottego is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of lizards as well as one subspecies of turtle: &quot;Agama bottegi&quot;, &quot;Chalcides bottegi&quot;, and &quot;Pelusios sinuatus bottegi&quot;.

Bottego is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of fishes: &quot;Neobola bottegoi&quot; and &quot;Labeo bottegi&quot;.

<text>António Manuel Mascarenhas Gomes Monteiro (; 16 February 1944 – 16 September 2016) was the first democratically elected President of Cape Verde from 22 March 1991 to 22 March 2001.

==Early life and education ==
Born in Ribeira da Barca in 1944, Monteiro went to university in Belgium and graduated with his law degree from the Catholic University of Leuven.

== Political career ==
During the PAICV&#x27;s single-party government, Monteiro served in various high level positions. He was the Secretary-General of the National Assembly from 1977 to 1980 and President of the Supreme Court of Justice from 1980 to 1990.

===Presidency of Cape Verde===
Affiliated with the Movement for Democracy, he was the first president elected in a multi-party election in the country, defeating Aristides Pereira in the February 1991 presidential election.

In February 1995, he awarded one of the archipelago&#x27;s greatest writer during the colonial era Eugénio Tavares the Medal of the Ordem do Vulcão.

He was re-elected without opposition in 1996, receiving 80% of the vote. After serving two five year terms, he stepped down in 2001; in the 2001 election, Movement for Democracy candidate Carlos Veiga, who had served as Prime Minister under Monteiro, was defeated by Pedro Pires of the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV).

===East Timor controversy===
On 19 September 2006, it was announced that Monteiro would succeed Sukehiro Hasegawa as head of the United Nations mission in East Timor. The appointment was criticized in East Timor, partly because Monteiro had a poor knowledge of English. It was reported that Timorese president Xanana Gusmão was among those who expressed their concern about the appointment.

On 25 September, Monteiro announced that he had changed his mind and would not be accepting the position. He told journalists that &quot;I told the Deputy Secretary-General that I already knew that there were reservations about my name on the part of parties engaged in East Timor and that I was no longer interested in serving there.&quot; He explained that &quot;the functions of a representative of the UN Secretary-General in East Timor are very broad and must be exercised with the goodwill of all parties involved.&quot; Therefore, &quot;it is better to stand down now than to create problems later on, especially in view of the complexity of the situation in East Timor.&quot;

== Memberships and awards ==
===Honors===
===Global Leadership Foundation===
Monteiro was a Member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an organization which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today&#x27;s national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with Heads of Government on governance-related issues of concern to them.

==Personal life==
Monteiro&#x27;s wife, Antonina Mascarenhas Monteiro, known widely as Tuna Mascarenhas, the former First Lady of Cape Verde, died in Praia on 9 September 2009, at the age of 65. He had three children.

Monteiro died on 16 September 2016 from kidney cancer and was buried in the cemetery in the city of Assomada on 18 September.

<doc id="890008" wikidata="Q325539" url="?curid=890008" title="Romolo Gessi">
<text>Romolo Gessi (30 April 1831 – 1 May 1881), also called Gessi Pasha, was an Italian soldier, governor in the Turkish-Egyptian administration and explorer of north-east Africa, who described the course of the White Nile in 19th-century Sudan and modern Uganda.

Gessi was born to an Italian father and Armenian mother from Istanbul in Ravenna, in Romagna. He acquired his military experience serving in the volunteer corps of Garibaldi in 1859 and 1860. He was one of numerous Garibaldi volunteers who went on to be regular soldiers, not only in the new Italian army, but in several others.

== Service in the British Empire in the Crimea and Sudan ==
Gessi fought with the British forces in the Crimean War (1854–55), where he first met General Charles George Gordon. Gordon later described him as &quot;Italian subject, aged 49 (in 1881). Short, compact figure; cool, most determined man. Born genius for practical ingenuity in mechanics. Ought to have been born in 1560, not 1832. Same disposition as Francis Drake. Had been engaged in many petty political affairs. Was interpreter to Her Majesty&#x27;s Forces in the Crimea, and attached to the headquarters of the Royal Artillery.&quot;

In 1876, while serving under governor-general Gordon in the Turkish Sudan, he explored the course of the White Nile in the area of Bahr El Jebel and mapped its descent from Lake Albert. He then ventured in the territory of the Oromo people, later becoming governor of the Bahr-el-Ghazal province, where he struggled against Sebehr and the slave trade and also was active in the deployment of gum arabic. Gordon regarded him, perhaps unfairly, as a brilliant mercenary –perhaps he did not come up to Gordon&#x27;s standards of noncomformist rectitude.

In 1880, while returning to Khartoum, he found the Nile obstructed and was held up for three months in the Sudd, becoming ill. This illness led to his death, shortly after his return to Suez. In 1881, Muhammad Rauf Pasha, Gordon&#x27;s successor at Khartoum, appointed Frank Lupton governor of the Bahr el Ghazal in place of Gessi.

After his death, his son Felice published his father&#x27;s memoirs in the book, &quot;Sette anni nel Sudan egiziano&quot; (Milano, 1891).

<text>The American Meteorological Society (AMS) is a scientific and professional organization in the United States promoting and disseminating information about the atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrologic sciences. Its mission is to advance the atmospheric and related sciences, technologies, applications, and services for the benefit of society.

== Background ==
Founded on December 29, 1919, by Charles Franklin Brooks at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in St. Louis and incorporated on January 21, 1920, the American Meteorological Society has a membership of more than 13,000 weather, water, and climate scientists, professionals, researchers, educators, students, and enthusiasts.

AMS publishes 12 atmospheric and related oceanic and hydrologic journals (in print and online), sponsors as many as twelve conferences annually, and administers professional certification programs and awards. The AMS Policy and Education programs promote scientific knowledge and work to increase public understanding of science. There is also an network of 94 local and student AMS chapters.

AMS headquarters is located at 45 Beacon Street adjacent to the Boston Common in Boston, Massachusetts. The headquarters building was designed by Charles Bulfinch as the third Harrison Gray Otis House in 1806 and was purchased and renovated by AMS in 1958, with staff moving into the building in 1960. In 2012, AMS purchased the building next door at 44 Beacon Street, also designed by Bulfinch. AMS also maintains an office in Washington, D.C., at 1200 New York Avenue NW inside the AAAS headquarters.

The American Meteorological Society is not to be confused with the American Meteor Society, a group of volunteers who observe and track meteors and fireballs.

== Certification programs ==
AMS maintains five professional certification programs. The Certified Broadcast Meteorologist (CBM) program sets a professional standard in broadcast meteorology. The Certified Consulting Meteorologist (CCM) program establishes high standards of technical competence, character, and experience for consultants who provide advice in meteorology to the public. The Certified Digital Meteorologist Program (CDM) program sets standards for meteorologists who meet criteria for effective communication in all forms of digital media. The AMS Seal of Approval was launched in 1957 to recognize on-air meteorologists for their sound delivery of weather information to the general public. Many seal holders are still active, though the original Seal was succeeded by the CBM. Those looking for an expert can consult the listings of all AMS Certified individuals. A recent addition is the Certified AMS Teacher (CAT), a graduate-level certificate for K-12 teachers.

== Awards ==
AMS recognizes excellent work with over 30 different awards ranging from outstanding research contributions in specific fields to awards for excellence in teaching or broadcasting, outstanding books, exceptional service in forecasting, and more, including its highest honor: the Carl-Gustaf Rossby Medal.

AMS also awards more than $100,000 annually in undergraduate and graduate level scholarships and fellowships.

== Publications ==
AMS publishes twelve peer-reviewed scientific journals, as well as books and monographs, accounting for more than 34,000 pages each year.

* &quot;Artificial Intelligence for the Earth Systems&quot; (AIES)
* &quot;Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society&quot; (BAMS)
* &quot;Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences&quot; (JAS)
* &quot;Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology&quot; (JAMC)
* &quot;Journal of Physical Oceanography&quot; (JPO)
* &quot;Monthly Weather Review&quot; (MWR)
* &quot;Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology&quot; (JTECH)
* &quot;Weather and Forecasting&quot; (WAF)
* &quot;Journal of Climate&quot; (JCLI)
* &quot;Journal of Hydrometeorology&quot; (JHM)
* &quot;Weather, Climate, and Society&quot; (WCAS)
* &quot;Earth Interactions&quot; (EI) (co-published with AGU &amp; AAG)
* &quot;Meteorological Monographs&quot;
In addition, AMS publishes the &quot;Glossary of Meteorology&quot;, a blog called the Front Page, and the scientific database &quot;Meteorological and Geoastrophysical Abstracts&quot;.

AMS is a member of Crossref, Portico, CHORUS, and CLOCKSS.

== Policy Program ==
The AMS Policy Program works to increase public understanding of the role of scientific information in societal advancement and helps policy-makers ground their decisions in the best available scientific knowledge. It carries out research, holds periodic briefings that allow experts to inform policy makers directly on established scientific understanding and the latest policy-relevant research, and hosts an annual Summer Policy Colloquium to introduce Earth scientists to the federal policy process. The Congressional Science Fellowship places an AMS scientist on the staff of a member of Congress for one full year.

== Statements ==
AMS issues and periodically updates four different types of statements on topics that fall within the scope of AMS expertise:
* Information statements aim to provide a trustworthy, objective and scientifically up-to-date explanation of scientific issues of concern to the public at large. They deal with subjects such as climate change and drought.
* Policy statements are aimed at officials of government or international bodies and may articulate the state of scientific understanding, raise awareness of a scientific issue, or make policy recommendations based on the professional and scientific expertise and perspectives of the AMS (examples: Weather, Water, and Climate Priorities; Geoengineering the Climate System; Space Weather)
* Professional guidance statements alert AMS members to urgent or important AMS, professional or scientific matters. (examples: Strengthening Social Sciences in the Weather–Climate Enterprise; Green Meetings)
* Best Practice statements inform AMS members and the public about AMS endorsed best practices across the weather, water, and climate enterprise and promote scientifically based standards and practices (example: Best Practices for Publicly Sharing Weather Information Via Social Media).

== Meetings and events ==
AMS organizes a large number national and international meetings, specialized conferences and workshops. Annually, more than 6,000 people attend AMS meetings covering science, technology and applications in the atmospheric and related oceanographic and hydrologic sciences. In addition to the AMS Annual Meeting, the most recent of which was held in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, during 28 January to 1 February 2024, a number of specialty meetings are held each year. AMS records oral presentations given at its meetings and posts them online for anyone to view free of charge.

Over thirty conferences and symposia are held concurrently during the AMS Annual Meeting, during which more than 2000 Oral Presentations are given, and more than 1000 Posters are presented by both professionals and students. The AMS Annual Meeting also features an exhibits program, where companies, universities, and organizations participate.

== Education Program ==
The AMS Education Program offers training, workshops, and undergraduate course curriculum to educate the next generation and increase scientific literacy. It claims to have trained over 100,000 teachers.

AMS partners with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NASA, National Science Foundation, and U.S. Navy to offer a suite of teacher professional development programs, including three DataStreme courses, Project ATMOSPHERE, and the Maury Project. Textbooks and Investigations Manuals used in AMS DataStreme and Undergraduate Courses are dynamic eBooks with web-based features. Many AMS members contribute to the creation and editing of course materials.

== Membership ==
The American Meteorological Society has more than 13,000 individual members in nearly 100 countries. Membership was initially limited to professionals or scholars in the atmospheric or related sciences, but today an array of membership categories accommodate a wide range of people including students, teachers, corporations and weather enthusiasts.

===Fellows===
Fellows of the AMS are those who &quot;have made outstanding contributions to the atmospheric or related oceanic or hydrologic sciences or their applications during a substantial period of years&quot;. New Fellows are elected annually by the AMS Council of not more than 0.2% of all AMS members. , 1195 members had been appointed as fellows, of whom 327 were deceased and 150 inactive.

<text>Jolie Brise is a gaff-rigged pilot cutter built and launched by the Albert Paumelle Yard in Le Havre in 1913 to a design by Alexandre Pâris. After a short career as a pilot boat, owing to steam replacing sail, she became a fishing boat, a racing yacht and a sail training vessel.

==1923–77 post-pilot history==

Bought by Evelyn George Martin in 1923 she was refitted and won the first Fastnet Race from seven starters in August 1925. In 1927 Martin sold &quot;Jolie Brise&quot;, through an advertisement in &quot;Yachting World&quot; to Captain Warren Ferrier and his partner Dr Brownlow Smith.

An engine and an additional cabin were fitted at Morgan Giles&#x27; yard at Teignmouth. Bobby Somerset, a founder member of the Ocean Racing Club - as was Martin, purchased her in 1928. After competing in the Fastnet, Bermuda and Santander races he sold her four years later to Lt. John Gage, RNR.

His ownership was only for a year and it seems that in 1934 she was purchased by an American, Stanley Mortimer. Alterations, mostly to the living accommodation were made at a yard in Palma, Majorca and a Gardner diesel was fitted in Marseilles. After cruising the Mediterranean, and with war in the offing &quot;Jolie Brise&quot; returned to Southampton and was put up for sale.

She was bought by William Stannard but requisitioned by the Royal Navy which laid her up on a mud berth at Shoreham for the duration of the war. In 1945 she was bought by a syndicate headed by Lillian and Jim Worsdell and her name was changed to &quot;Pleasant Breeze&quot;.

A voyage to New Zealand was aborted and when she put into Lisbon she was acquired by a Portuguese syndicate headed by Luis Lobato. Repaired and refitted, she was once again listed as &quot;Jolie Brise&quot;. For nearly 30 years her home port remained Lisbon but in 1975, partly because of the political situation in Portugal, she returned to the Solent, 50 years after her first Fastnet win.

==1977–present role==
In 1977 she was bought in a collaboration between Dauntsey&#x27;s School, the International Sailing Craft Association and the Science Museum to serve as the flagship of its sailing club and remains in that role.

Between 1977 and 1991 she sailed extensively around European waters crewed by students from the School, including winning Tall Ships Races in 1980 and 1986. The students were also involved heavily in the care and maintenance of her.

In 1991 she entered a major refit at Gloucester Docks, which was completed in 1993.

The same year she entered the Fastnet Race again, sixty years after her first time in 1931. After a circumnavigation of the UK in 1994, she has sailed all over Europe, and beyond with crews from the School, hosting other schools and groups of young people and with commercial trainees. In 1996 she returned to Portugal to visit Luis Lobato, in 1997 she went north, venturing 200 miles inside the Arctic Circle and in 2000, 2009 and 2017 she sailed across the Atlantic to the Bermuda, USA and Canada. In 2019 she visited Iceland and the Faroe Islands for the first time.

In 2003 she was bought by Dauntsey&#x27;s School outright.

The boat is currently skippered by Toby Marris, and has the capacity to carry up to 12 students for local and international cruising and racing trips.

==Fastnet Races==

The Fastnet Race is a biennial offshore yacht race off the south coast of the United Kingdom, named after the Fastnet Rock, which the race course rounds. It is considered one of the classic offshore races.

&quot;Jolie Brise&quot; won the inaugural Fastnet Race (then called the Ocean Race) in 1925 in a time of 6 days, 14 hours and 45 minutes as part of a fleet of seven boats. At the post-race dinner at the Royal Western Yacht Club in Plymouth, the new Ocean Racing Club (later the Royal Ocean Racing Club) was formed and its first commodore appointed, Jolie Brise&#x27;s owner Lt Cmdr Evelyn G Martin.

&quot;Jolie Brise&quot; won the Fastnet again in 1929 and 1930, again skippered by Martin. She is currently the only vessel to have won the race three times.

She also competed in the 2013 Fastnet Race on the centenary of her inaugural win, crewed by students from Dauntsey&#x27;s School and the Ellen MacArthur Cancer Trust, finishing 277th in fleet of 294 boats with a time of 4 days, 19 hours, 11 minutes and 4 seconds.

==Blue Water Medals==
The prestigious Blue Water Medal was inaugurated by the Cruising Club of America in 1923 to reward &quot;meritorious seamanship and adventure upon the sea displayed by amateur sailors of all nationalities, that might otherwise go unrecognized&quot;.

&quot;Jolie Brise&quot;&#x27;s two Blue Water Medals were both awarded for her conduct in the Bermuda Race.

The first, in 1926, was to Evelyn Martin for &quot;Double trans-Atlantic crossing, including Bermuda Race. LeHavre pilot cutter 56 feet oa. April 3, 1926 from Falmouth, July 27 to Plymouth.&quot;

Her second was awarded in 1932 to Robert Somerset &quot;Without Date&quot; for &quot;remarkable feat of seamanship and courage in rescuing all but one of 11-man crew of burning schooner &quot;Adriana&quot; in the 1932 Bermuda Race.&quot;

On the first night of the 1932 Bermuda Race, the schooner &quot;Adriana&quot; was sailing into brisk southwesterly winds when the heat from the coal stove in her cabin ignited some oilskins. The uncontrollable fire spread so rapidly that the decision was made to abandon ship.

Three miles ahead of &quot;Adriana&quot; was &quot;Jolie Brise&quot;, owned and sailed by Henry Robert Somers Fitzroy de Vere Somerset, known afloat as “Bobby.” His crew included Herbert L. Stone and the famous American racing helmsman Sherman Hoyt.

In a feat of seamanship, Somerset, at &quot;Jolie Brise&quot;’s long tiller, turned the engineless, heavy-displacement vessel around toward the burning &quot;Adriana&quot;, whose crew was struggling to launch a small boat and heave the spinnaker pole into the water to serve as an improvised float. As &quot;Adriana&quot;’s helmsman, Clarence Kozaly, held position, Somerset brought &quot;Jolie Brise&quot; alongside under sail. The yachts’ rails banged together, their upper rigging tangled, and &quot;Jolie Brise&quot;’s tarred deadeye lanyards were charred. 
Ten of &quot;Adriana&quot;’s crew of 11 jumped across to the cutter&#x27;s deck.

Only the dutiful Kozaly was left at the helm of &quot;Adriana&quot;. The two yachts were several feet apart when he finally let go the wheel and made his leap, only to tumble into the gap. Sherman Hoyt desperately threw him a line, but Kozaly&#x27;s heavy clothing drew him under. After helping to save 10 lives, he lost his own and is the only fatality in Bermuda Race history.
==Bermuda Post Office stamps==
A part of her participation in the Tall Ships Atlantic Challenge 2009, &quot;Jolie Brise&quot; sailed from Tenerife to Bermuda. To commemorate the event, the Bermuda Post Office Philatelic Department issued a set of stamps depicting six of the ships involved, including the &quot;Jolie Brise&quot;.

==Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant==
&quot;Jolie Brise&quot; was one of a number of prestigious vessels to be moored along the route of the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II on 3 June 2012. Due to her size, she was not part of the flotilla of vessels, and was instead moored with other vessels at St Katharine Docks.

==Jolie Brise Pub==
In May 2018, Wetherspoons opened a pub in Teignmouth and named it The Jolie Brise after the boat which had been refitted in the town before her first Fastnet win in 1923. &quot;Jolie Brise&quot; visited the town for the opening of the pub.

<doc id="890021" wikidata="Q963418" url="?curid=890021" title="AN/FSQ-7 Combat Direction Central">
<text>The AN/FSQ-7 Combat Direction Central, referred to as the Q7 for short, was a computerized air defense command and control system. It was used by the United States Air Force for ground-controlled interception as part of the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment network during the Cold War.

The name “AN/FSQ” derives from &quot;Army-Navy / Fixed Special eQuipment&quot;.

An advancement of the pioneering MIT Whirlwind II digital computer design, and manufactured by IBM as prime contractor, the AN/FSQ-7 was the largest discrete computer system ever built. Each of the 24 installed machines weighed 250 tons. The AN/FSQ-7 used a total of 60,000 vacuum tubes (49,000 in the computers) and up to 3 megawatts of electricity, performing about 75,000 instructions per second for networking regional radars.

==Primary functions==
Installations in the USAF Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air defense network were configured as duplex systems, using a pair of AN/FSQ-7 computers to provide fault tolerance. One was active at any time, the other on standby. The standby system copied data from the active system to minimize switchover time if needed. A scheduled switchover took place every day.

The AN/FSQ-7 calculated one or more predicted interception points for assigning manned aircraft or CIM-10 Bomarc missiles to intercept an intruder using the Automatic Target and Battery Evaluation (ATABE) algorithm. Also used in the Nike AN/FSG-1 system, ATABE automated the Whiz Wheel (Felsenthal CPU-73 A/P Air Navigation Attack Computer) method used in manual command post operations.

The Q7 fire button launched the Bomarc, and an additional Q7 algorithm automatically directed the missile during climb and cruise to the beginning of its supersonic dive on the target when guidance transferred to the missile seeker system for the homing dive. Later improvements allowed transmission of Q7 guidance to autopilots of manned fighters for vectoring to targets via the SAGE Ground to Air Data Link Subsystem (cf. bomber vectoring to a Bomb Release Point in 1965–1973 Vietnam via vacuum-tube &quot;analog&quot; computers.)

==History==
The first United States radar network used voice reporting to the 1939 Twin Lights Station in New Jersey, and the post-World War II experimental Cape Cod System used a Whirlwind I computer at Cambridge, Massachusetts to network long-range and several short-range radars. The key Whirlwind modification for radar netting was the development of magnetic-core memory that vastly improved reliability, doubled operating speed, and quadrupled input speed relative to the original Williams tube memory of the Whirlwind I.

The AN/FSQ-7 was based on the larger and faster (but uncompleted) Whirlwind II design. It proved too much for MIT&#x27;s resources, resulting in IBM being retained as prime contractor – though the MIT Lincoln Laboratory Division 6 still participated in AN/FSQ-7 development.

Similar to the Q7, the smaller AN/FSQ-8 Combat Control Central was produced without an &#x27;Automatic Initiation Area Discriminator&#x27;

A simplex version of the AN/FSQ-7 was located at the premises of the System Development Corporation in Santa Monica, California from 1957 until the premises were vacated some time after 1981.

==Uses==

===SAGE===
The experimental SAGE subsector, located in Lexington, Massachusetts, was completed in 1955, equipped with a prototype AN/FSQ-7 known as XD-1 in Building F. The third evaluation run with the XD-1 was in August and the prototype was complete in October 1955, except for displays.

DC-1 at McGuire Air Force Base was the first operational site of the AN/FSQ-7 with consoles scheduled for delivery Aug–Oct 1956. Groundbreaking at McChord Air Force Base was in 1957 where the &quot;electronic brain&quot; began arriving in November 1958. The Cape Canaveral BOMARC 624-XY1&#x27;s intercept of a target drone in August 1958 used the Kingston, New York, Q7 1500 miles away. By 1959, the 2000th simulated BOMARC intercept had been completed by the Q7.

The SAGE/Missile Master test program conducted large-scale field testing of the ATABE mathematical model using radar tracks of actual Strategic Air Command and Air Defense Command aircraft conducting mock penetrations into defense sectors (cf. Operation Skyshield). The vacuum-tube SAGE network was completed (and obsolete) in 1963, and a system ergonomic test was performed at Luke Air Force Base in 1964. According to Harold Sackman, it &quot;showed conclusively that the wrong timing of human and technical operations was leading to frequent truncation of the flight path tracking system.&quot; Back-Up Interceptor Control Systems (BUIC) were used to replace the AN/FSQ-7s: two remained at SAGE sites until 1983 including McChord AFB, and the Q7 at Luke AFB was demolished in February 1984.

===Sabre===
The SABRE airline reservation system used AN/FSQ-7 technology.

===In popular media===
Q7 components were used as props in numerous films and television series needing futuristic-looking computers, despite the fact they were built in the 1950s. Q7 components were used in &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot;, &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;, &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;, &quot;WarGames&quot;, &quot;Independence Day&quot;, &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; TV series (Season 1, Episode 5, &quot;The Legacy&quot; aired October 1974), and many others.

===Today===
The Computer History Museum displays several AN/FSQ-7 components.

== Equipment ==


MIT selected IBM as the prime contractor for equipment construction.
The Central Computer System of the AN/FSQ-7 had two computers for redundancy each with Arithmetic, Core Memory, Instruction Control, Maintenance Control, Selection &amp; IO Control, and Program elements. The Q7 had input/output devices such as:
* IBM 723 card punch and IBM 713 punched card reader
* IBM 718 line printer (64 print positions)
* drum auxiliary memory (50 &quot;fields&quot; of 2048 words each) and IBM 728 magnetic tape drives (32-bit words)
* Crosstelling Input (XTL) from other AN/FSQ sites
* Display and Warning Light System with dozens of consoles in various rooms having Situation Display Tubes, Digital Display Tubes, and controls (e.g., push buttons and light gun) including:
** Duplex Maintenance Console (two), each DMC operated one of the Central Computer Systems and allowed diagnostics (a speaker was available)
** Tracker Initiator Consoles for designating a &quot;blip&quot; (radar return) to be tracked (assign a track number and to relay speed, direction, and altitude)
** Command Post Digital Display Desk
** Senior Director&#x27;s keyed console with the Bomarc fire button
** LRI Monitor Console for monitoring Long Range Radar data
** Large Board Projection Equipment Operator displays were directly copied on 35 mm film which were projected on the board.

Punched card data was transferred to and from the core memory as binary images. Only the rightmost 64 columns were transferred, with each row containing two 32-bit words. (The left columns could be punched using a special instruction.) Data were transferred to the line printer as a card image as well.

===Core memory element===
The FSQ-7 and -8 used core memory with 32-bit words plus a parity bit, operating at a 6-microsecond cycle time. Both machines had two banks of memory, memory 1 and memory 2 (Commonly referred to as Big Mem and little Mem). On the FSQ 7 memory 1 had 65,536 words and memory 2 had 4096 words. At Luke Air Force Base, the FSQ-7 held 65,536 words at each bank and the FSQ-8 4096 words at each bank.

For data storage, each word was divided into two halves, each half was a 15-bit number with a sign bit. Arithmetic operations were performed on both halves simultaneously. Each number was treated as a fraction between −1 and 1. This restriction is placed on data primarily so that the multiplication of two numbers will always result in a product smaller than either of the numbers, thus positively avoiding overflow. Properly scaling calculations was the responsibility of the programmer.

Instructions used the right half word plus the left sign bit to form addresses, yielding a 17-bit address space. The remainder of the left half word specified the operation. The first three bits after the sign specified an index register. The following bits specified an instruction class, class variation and instruction-dependent auxiliary information. Addresses were written in octal notation, with the two sign bits forming a prefix, so 2.07777 would be the highest word in memory 2.

Arithmetic registers were provided for both halves of the data word and included an accumulator, an A register that held the data value retrieved from memory, and a B register that held the least significant bits of a multiplication, the magnitude of a division, as well as shifted bits. There was also a program counter, four index registers, and a 16-bit real-time clock register which was incremented 32 times a second. Trigonometric sine and cosine functions used 1.4 degree precision (256 values) via look-up tables.

<text>Grappa is an alcoholic beverage: a fragrant, grape-based pomace brandy of Italian origin that contains 35 to 60 percent alcohol by volume (70 to 120 US proof). Grappa is a protected name in the European Union. 

Grappa is made by distilling the skins, pulp, seeds, and stems (i.e., the pomace) left over from winemaking after pressing the grapes. It was originally made to prevent waste by using these leftovers. A similar drink, known as &quot;acquavite d&#x27;uva&quot;, is made by distilling whole must.

In Italy, grappa is primarily served as a &quot;digestivo&quot; or after-dinner drink. Its main purpose is to aid in the digestion of heavy meals. Grappa may also be added to espresso coffee to create a &quot;caffè corretto&quot;, meaning &quot;corrected&quot; coffee. Another variation of this is the &quot;ammazzacaffè&quot;: the espresso is drunk first, followed by a few ounces of grappa served in its own glass. In Veneto, there is &quot;resentin&quot;: after finishing a cup of espresso with sugar, a few drops of grappa are poured into the nearly empty cup, swirled and drunk down in one sip.

Noted producers of grappa include Jacopo Poli, Nardini, and Nonino. These grappas are produced in significant quantities and are exported; there are also many small local or regional grappas.
Most grappa is clear, indicating it is an unaged distillate, although some may retain very faint pigments from their original fruit pomace. Lately, aged grappas have become more common, and these take on a yellow or red-brown hue from the barrels in which they are stored.

Grappa is also well known in Uruguay and Argentina, due to the significant Italian immigration in those countries. It is served as in Italy, after the main meals. In Uruguay, a local version called grappamiel has also been created, which sees honey added to the traditional grappa. It is widely served and mostly drunk in winter because it &quot;warms&quot; the throat.

==History==

Distillation is an ancient practice that can be traced back to the 1st century AD. The distillation of alcohol may have been carried out reliably by al-Kindī ( CE), al-Fārābī (), and al-Zahrāwī (Latin: Abulcasis, 936–1013), as well as by the School of Salerno in the 12th century.

Grappa is traditionally produced in northern Italy and is also widely consumed in places such as Argentina, Bulgaria, Georgia (chacha), Uruguay, Galicia (&quot;orujo&quot; or &quot;aguardiente&quot; in Spanish), and Portugal (known as &quot;bagaço&quot; or &quot;bagaceira&quot;).

There is a legend that tells of a Roman soldier who first distilled grappa in the northern Italian town of Bassano del Grappa using distilling equipment stolen in Egypt (&quot;Crisiopea di Cleopatra&quot;, 2nd century AD). However, the story cannot be considered reliable as such equipment could not produce grappa. Distillation useful for producing beverages was not discovered until the 8th century, and it probably took about two more centuries for the technology to travel from its home in the Levant and Persia to Italy (likely by route of the Crusades).

Around 1300–1400 AD, however, the introduction of water as a coolant in the distilling equipment made it possible to produce a substantially larger amount of distilled wine and to distill pomace. Around 1600 AD, the Jesuits in Spain, Italy, and Germany studied and codified the techniques used to produce brandy or grappa, and their methods were used until recent times.
The Museum of Wine and Grappa shows historical equipment used in the early years of grappa distillation.

The modernisation of grappa distillation is relatively recent, probably in 1979 in northern Italy. Initially it was carried out by direct flame but soon the advantages of a bain-marie or steam distillation to obtain a better product became obvious. Modern refinements included the distillation of pomace under vacuum, the use of varietal grapes and ageing in casks of various types of wood to improve the flavor of the liquor. Oak is the most used, but some more expensive grappas are aged successively in casks of acacia, ash, and cherry-wood, an innovation introduced by the Marzadro Distillery. In Sardinia, Grappa is colloquially known as Filu è Ferru (iron wire), as most of the distillation was illegally home-made to avoid customs and excise taxes. The illegally distilled liquor was bottled, sealed and then buried in orchards, fields, and pastures, awaiting sale. A bit of iron wire was tied around the bottleneck, barely protruding through the soil; after some time the wire would rust and disappear completely save for a faintly brown-red stain to the topsoil on the spot where the bottle was buried. While the peasant distiller could easily recognize the colored spot, the urban-schooled Guardia di Finanza officers were generally unable to tell the difference.

==PGI status==
Grappa is a protected name (PGI) in the European Union. To be called grappa, the following criteria must be met:

# Produced in Italy, or in the Italian part of Switzerland, or in San Marino
# Produced from pomace
# Fermentation and distillation must occur on the pomace—no added water

Criterion 2 rules out the direct fermentation of pure grape juice, which is the method used to produce brandy.

Criterion 3 has two important implications. First, the distillation must occur on solids. Thus, it is carried out not with a direct flame but with a bain-marie or steam distillation; otherwise, the pomace may burn. Second, the woody parts of the grapes (the stems and seeds) are co-fermented with the sugar-rich juice; this produces a very small amount of methanol, which is much more toxic than ethanol. Unlike in the similar process of making red wine, in grappa the methanol must be carefully removed during distillation. That is why there is an Italian law requiring winemakers to sell their pomace to grappa makers; this is a measure that was taken against moonshine operations, which are now very rare in Italy.

Use of the word grappa for product distilled in the United States is still allowed and falls under the Class definition of brandy further classified type as pomace, specifically grappa or grappa brandy.

==Tasting==

Professional tasters distinguish among four categories of grappa: young, cask-conditioned, aromatic, and aromatized. Grappa tastings begin with young grappas, then continue with cask-conditioned and aromatic grappas, and finish with aromatized grappas.

The flavor of grappa, like that of wine, depends on the type and quality of the grapes used, as well as the specifics of the distillation process. 

After each tasting, and before sampling another glass, some tasters recommend drinking half a glass of milk to refresh the taste receptors on the tongue.

Various other food products can help stop taste-characteristics of one grappa from &quot;dragging&quot; or carrying over to the next. Foods that are effective in this role as well as providing an agreeable accompaniment to grappa&#x27;s own flavor include:
* Salted pistachio nuts

With the introduction of &quot;boutique&quot; grappas, elaborate flute glasses have been promoted; traditionalists continue to taste grappa in shot glasses.

<text>Botlek is an industrial port area of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. It specialises in petrochemical logistics.

==History==
Botlek was originally the name of a stretch of the Nieuwe Maas river, part of the Rhine–Meuse delta near the Dutch cities of Vlaardingen and Spijkenisse in the province of South Holland. Specifically, it was the name of the strait that separated the island of Rozenburg from the sand bar of Welplaat. The strait itself was merely the continuation of the Nieuwe Maas, and the stretch of the river south of Rozenburg continued to be called Nieuwe Maas until the confluence with Het Scheur formed the Brielse Maas estuary (now the Brielse Meer).

Major waterway regulation works were carried out in the Netherlands in the 19th and 20th centuries to improve water management and stop the delta from silting up; the Botlek was dammed off at its southern end (connecting Rozenburg and Welplaat) and remodelled into one of the largest of the Rotterdam seaports.

<doc id="890035" wikidata="Q721440" url="?curid=890035" title="Walter V, Count of Brienne">
<text>Walter V of Brienne (; – 15 March 1311) was Duke of Athens from 1308 until his death. Being the only son of Hugh of Brienne and Isabella de la Roche, Walter was the heir to large estates in France, the Kingdom of Naples, and the Peloponnese. He was held in custody in the Sicilian castle of Augusta between 1287 and 1296 or 1297 to secure the payment of his father&#x27;s ransom to the Aragonese admiral Roger of Lauria. When his father died fighting against Lauria in 1296, Walter inherited the County of Brienne in France, and the counties of Lecce and Conversano in southern Italy. He was released, but he was captured during a Neapolitan invasion of Sicily in 1299. His second captivity lasted until the Treaty of Caltabellotta in 1302.

Walter settled in France and married Joanna of Châtillon. After his cousin Duke Guy II of Athens died childless in 1308, Walter laid claim to the Duchy of Athens. Their cousin Eschiva of Ibelin also claimed the duchy, but the High Court of Achaea passed a judgement in Walter&#x27;s favor. Walter came to Athens in 1309. John II Doukas, the Greek lord of Thessaly, made an alliance against him with the Byzantine Empire and the Despotate of Epirus. Walter hired the Catalan Company, a group of mercenaries, to invade Thessaly. The Catalans defeated John, but Walter refused to pay their wages. After the Catalans rose up in open rebellion, Walter assembled a large army from Frankish Greece, but the Catalans inflicted a crushing defeat on the Franks in the Battle of Halmyros. Walter died on the battlefield and the Catalans occupied the Duchy of Athens.

== Early life ==

Born around 1275, Walter was the only son of Hugh of Brienne and Isabella de la Roche. Hugh held important fiefs both in France (the county of Brienne), and in southern Italy (the counties of Lecce and Conversano). He had also claimed Cyprus, but the Cypriots elected his cousin Hugh of Antioch-Lusignan as king. Isabella de la Rochethe younger daughter of Duke Guy I of Athensbrought Peloponnesian estates into the marriage. She died in 1279.

Historian Guy Perry describes Walter as a &quot;veritable child&quot; of the War of the Sicilian Vespers (1282–1302). His father, who was a military commander of King Charles II of Naples, fell into captivity in the Battle of the Counts on 23 June 1287. Hugh was released only after he ceded Walter as a hostage to the Aragonese admiral, Roger of Lauria, to guarantee the payment of his ransom. Walter was kept in the fortress at Augusta for years. He most probably learnt Catalan and became familiar with the Aragonese customs during the years of his captivity.

Walter was still held in custody when his father died fighting against Lauria at Brindisi in the summer of 1296. King Charles II ordered Hugh&#x27;s southern Italian vassals to swear fealty to Walter on 27 August. After being released, Walter went to France and took possession of his father&#x27;s French domains. He was invested with the County of Brienne before May 1297.

== Warlike aristocrat ==

Seeking revenge for his father&#x27;s death, Walter made an alliance with two French noblemen whose fathers had also been murdered in Italy. They hired 300 horsemen, who were known as the &quot;Knights of Death&quot;, and joined the army that Charles II&#x27;s heir, Robert, Duke of Calabria, had mustered to invade Sicily. Robert and his troops landed at Catania and occupied the town. Before long, rumours reached the Neapolitan camp, hinting that the castellan of Gagliano Castelferrato was willing to capitulate without resistance. Robert dispatched Walter and his retainers to the fortress to start negotiations with the castellan. The rumours proved false, deliberately spread to trap Neapolitan troops. After realizing the situation, Walter refused to flee, and in the ensuing Battle of Gagliano he was forced to surrender. Charles II appointed Philip of Toucy to administer Walter&#x27;s southern Italian domains during his captivity. After the Treaty of Caltabellotta was signed in 1302, ending the War of the Sicilian Vespers, Walter was released. He went to France before June 1303. His subsequent marriage to Joanna of Châtillon, the daughter of the constable of France, strengthened his position in France.

== Duke of Athens ==
On 5 October 1308, the duke of Athens, Guy II, died childless. His two cousins, Walter and Eschiva of Ibelin, laid claim to the duchy. Eschiva was the daughter of Alice de la Roche, who was the elder sister of Walter&#x27;s mother, but the High Court of the Principality of Achaea—the feudal suzerain of Athens—ruled in Walter&#x27;s favor, saying that the male claimant was to be preferred against a female if two relatives of equal degree claimed an inheritance. Before departing for Athens, Walter appointed his father-in-law, Gaucher V de Châtillon, to administer the County of Brienne.

Walter landed at Glarentza in Achaea in the summer of 1309. By the time he reached Athens, John II Doukas, ruler of Thessaly, had got rid of Athenian suzerainty. The Byzantine emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos, and the actual ruler of Epirus, Anna Palaiologina Kantakouzene, supported John II, forcing Walter to seek external assistance. The Catalan Companya group of unemployed mercenarieshad made regular raids against Thessaly since 1305. Walter hired the Catalans and their Turkish allies to fight against the Greek rulers. The mercenaries invaded Thessaly and occupied important fortresses. After six months, John II was forced to sue for peace.

Walter owed the mercenaries four months&#x27; salaries, but he did not want to pay the arrears. He selected 200 horsemen and 300 &quot;almogàvars&quot; (lightly-armed foot soldiers) from among the Catalans and promised only to them to pay their wages. He also offered fiefs to them and ordered all other Catalans to leave the duchy. The dismissed mercenaries refused to move and requested Walter to allow them to settle in the newly conquered lands as his vassals. Walter did not trust the Catalans and threatened them with capital punishment if they did not obey his commands. Having nowhere else to go, the disbanded mercenaries rose up in open rebellion. The 500 Catalan mercenaries whom Walter had just hired joined their compatriots, forcing Walter to seek assistance from Achaea and other parts of Frankish Greece.

Walter&#x27;s army met the Catalans in a marshy plain at Halmyros on 15 March 1311. The Catalans were willing to make peace, but Walter was determined to get rid of them. At the ensuing Battle of Halmyros, the Catalans won a devastating victory, killing Walter and almost all of his cavalry. The Catalans occupied the Duchy of Athens, and Walter&#x27;s son, who was taken to Italy after the Catalans&#x27; victory, made unsuccessful attempts to regain it in the following decades. A Turkish soldier decapitated Walter&#x27;s corpse and took his head in triumph from the battlefield. His son seized Walter&#x27;s severed head and buried it in Lecce, most probably in the church of Sant&#x27;Oronzo, in 1348.

== Genealogical table ==

 
 

In the year 1306 he married Jeanne de Châtillon and had two children:
* Walter VI of Brienne (1302–1356), his successor as count of Lecce and Conversano, as well as the titular duke of Athens
* Isabella of Brienne (died 1360), married Gautier III, lord of Enghien, and claimed her brother&#x27;s title to Lecce and Conversano on his death.

<text>The epithet Nazarene was adopted by a group of early 19th-century German Romantic painters who aimed to revive spirituality in art. The name Nazarene came from a term of derision used against them for their affectation of a biblical manner of clothing and hair style.

==History==
In 1809, six students at the Vienna Academy formed an artistic cooperative in Vienna called the Brotherhood of St. Luke or &quot;Lukasbund&quot;, following a common name for medieval guilds of painters. In 1810 four of them, Johann Friedrich Overbeck, Franz Pforr, Ludwig Vogel and Johann Konrad Hottinger (1788–1827) moved to Rome, where they occupied the abandoned monastery of San Isidoro. They were joined by Philipp Veit, Peter von Cornelius, Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld, Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow and a loose grouping of other German-speaking artists. They met up with Austrian romantic landscape artist Joseph Anton Koch (1768–1839) who became an unofficial tutor to the group. In 1827, they were joined by Joseph von Führich (1800–1876).

The principal motivation of the Nazarenes was a reaction against Neoclassicism and the routine art education of the academy system. They hoped to return to art that embodied spiritual values, and sought inspiration in artists of the Late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, rejecting what they saw as the superficial virtuosity of later art.

In Rome, the group lived a semi-monastic existence as a way of re-creating the nature of the medieval artist&#x27;s workshop. Religious subjects dominated their output, and two major commissions allowed them to attempt a revival of the medieval art of fresco painting. The first was a fresco series completed in Rome for the Casa Bartholdy (1816–17; moved to the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin), a collaborative project by the Nazarenes that &quot;marks the beginning of the revival of fresco decoration for private and public buildings&quot;. This, and a second commission to decorate the Casino Massimo (1817–1829), gained international attention for the work of the &quot;Nazarenes&quot;. However, by 1830 all except Overbeck had returned to Germany and the group had disbanded. Many Nazarenes became influential teachers in German art academies.

==Legacy==
The programme of the Nazarenes—the adoption of what they called honest expression in art and the inspiration of artists before Raphael—was to exert considerable influence in Germany upon the Beuron Art School, and in England upon the Pre-Raphaelite movement. They were also direct influences on the British artists William Dyce and Frederick Leighton and Ford Madox Brown.

<text>The American Analog Set (sometimes referred to as AmAnSet) is an Austin-based indie rock band. They have released seven studio albums, on the record labels Emperor Jones, Tiger Style Records, and Arts &amp; Crafts. On October 27, 2023, they released &quot;For Forever&quot;, their first album of new material since 2005. On February 9, 2024, The Numero Group released the &quot;New Drifters&quot; box set, containing the bands first 3 albums and 2 albums worth of unreleased demos, b-sides and outtakes. On April 10, 2024, The Numero Group announced on their Instagram that they were working on a boxset with the Tiger Style era material.

==History==
Forming in 1995, the group&#x27;s early sound was highly influenced by krautrock and post-rock and British shoegaze bands like Cocteau Twins, often featuring long instrumental passages. Over time, their songs became shorter and more pop-influenced. The band has released seven full-length albums, four EPs, and several singles.

The group is led by singer/songwriter/guitarist Andrew Kenny. Additional members include, or have included, Jesse Lee, Mark Smith, Craig McCaffrey, Tom Hoff, Lisa Roschmann, and Sean Ripple. Founding member Roschmann left the band in late 1999; Hoff and Ripple joined in early 2000 and McCaffery replaced Hoff in 2003 for the album &quot;Set Free&quot;. Hoff rejoined the current lineup in 2013.

In October 2005, rumors began spreading across the Internet that the group was on the verge of disbanding. The band quickly refuted such rumors, but added that they may not tour again due to their obligations with other projects.

2005&#x27;s &quot;Set Free&quot;, was released in North America by Canadian record label Arts &amp; Crafts.

&quot;Gone to Earth&quot; from &quot;Know by Heart&quot; was a part of the soundtrack of the 2009 romantic film &quot;The Time Traveler&#x27;s Wife&quot;.

The band released &quot;For Forever&quot;, their first album in 18 years, on October 27, 2023. In September of the following year, they reunited to play their first show in 13 years. The show was played in their hometown of Austin.

<text>The Mississagi River is a river in Algoma and Sudbury Districts, Ontario, Canada, that originates in Sudbury District and flows to Lake Huron at Blind River, Algoma District.

==Etymology==
The river&#x27;s name comes from the Ojibwe &quot;misi-zaagi&quot;, meaning &quot;river with a wide mouth&quot;.

==Geography==
The Mississagi River begins in a small unnamed lake in Sudbury District and flows south from that point to the border of Algoma District, then southeast through a north-east corner of the district, before returning once again to Sudbury District at White Owl Lake, from which it flows into Mississagi Lake at an elevation of .

The river then turns south and heads to Kettle Lake, the furthest point east it reaches, before continuing south and entering Mississagi River Provincial Park at Upper Bark Lake at an elevation of . The river then continues south and crosses back into Algoma District, where it remains for the rest of its journey to Lake Huron, and enters the large L-shaped Bark Lake. It then heads west through Hellgate Rapids, takes in its right tributary the Abinette River at an elevation of , splits into two channels to form an island at , recombines at , and enters the large Rocky Island Lake at an elevation of , where the right tributary Cypress River enters. The Mississagi River then flows into Aubrey Lake, partially formed by the Aubrey Falls Generating Station (hydro) and dam, and where the Wenebegon Rivers joins. Not all the water is funnelled into the station, however; some continues to form the Aubrey Falls.

The river turns south and the right tributary Aubinadong River enters, followed by two left tributaries, the Sharpsand River and the Rapid River in quick succession, and further on, another left tributary, Snowshoe Creek from Wakomata Lake. Then it reaches Tunnel Lake, formed by the George W Rayner Generating Station and Wells Generating Station and associated dams. The river then heads southeast where the left tributary Little White River enters, and continues to Red Rock Lake, created by the Red Rock Falls Generating Station and dam, over the Shino Rapids, takes in the right tributary Bolton River, then reaches the North Channel on Lake Huron.

Over the period 1961 to 2023, the Mississagi River has a mean flow of . Mean minimal flow is and mean maximum flow is . Record maximum flow was in May 1997, while record minimum flow was in December 1976.

The river&#x27;s delta is a &quot;bird&#x27;s foot&quot; delta, a type not commonly found on the Great Lakes. The Mississippi River in Louisiana has a bird&#x27;s foot delta.

==History==

The Ojibwa people used the river to travel between the forests of the interior and Lake Huron. In 1799, the North West Company built a fur trading post at the mouth of the river, which became a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company post in 1821 when these 2 companies merged. In the 1830s, the post was only staffed in the winter. The post (spelled over time as Mississagi, Mississague, Mississagaue, Missasague, Mississagui, Mississaguie, Mississaugie, Mitsisague, Missisaguee, Missisauge, Mississauga, and Mississauguay) was important in blocking competition from trading in the Temiskamingue area. The post was closed in 1900.

During the second half of the 19th century, the river was used to transport logs to sawmills at Blind River.

==Economy==
Ontario Hydro constructed dams and four hydroelectric generating stations on the Mississagi River, Rayner G.S., Wells G.S., Red Rock Falls G.S., and Aubrey Falls G.S. between 1950 and 1970, which today are operated by Brookfield Asset Management. Historically, mining and forestry played a large role, but today tourism is the primary activity along the river.

Highway 129 follows the river from Wharncliffe until the river turns east at Aubrey Falls.

==Ecology==
The lower river is an important spawning ground for lake sturgeon.

Aubrey Falls Provincial Park is on the river at Aubrey Falls. Mississagi River Provincial Park encompasses the upper reaches of the river including Mississagi Lake. Mississagi Provincial Park is on the Boland River, a tributary of the Little White River. Mississagi Delta Provincial Nature Reserve Park encompasses the river&#x27;s delta mouth. The Voyageur Hiking Trail follows the lower portion of the river near Iron Bridge.

<doc id="890069" wikidata="Q408883" url="?curid=890069" title="Thymol">
<text>Thymol (also known as 2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol, IPMP), , is a natural monoterpenoid phenol derivative of &quot;p&quot;-Cymene, isomeric with carvacrol. It occurs naturally in the oil of thyme, and it is extracted from &quot;Thymus vulgaris&quot; (common thyme), ajwain, and various other plants as a white crystalline substance of a pleasant aromatic odor and strong antiseptic properties. Thymol also provides the distinctive, strong flavor of the culinary herb thyme, also produced from &quot;T. vulgaris&quot;. Thymol is only slightly soluble in water at neutral pH, but it is extremely soluble in alcohols and other organic solvents. It is also soluble in strongly alkaline aqueous solutions due to deprotonation of the phenol. Its dissociation constant (p&quot;K&quot;a) is . Thymol absorbs maximum UV radiation at 274 nm.

== Chemical synthesis ==
Thymol is produced by the alkylation of &quot;m&quot;-cresol and propene:

A predicted method of biosynthesis of thymol in thyme and oregano begins with the cyclization of geranyl diphosphate by TvTPS2 to γ-terpinene. Oxidation by a cytochrome P450 in the CYP71D subfamily creates a dienol intermediate, which is then converted into a ketone by short-chain dehydrogenase. Lastly, keto-enol tautomerization gives thymol.

==History==
Ancient Egyptians used thyme for embalming. The ancient Greeks used it in their baths and burned it as incense in their temples, believing it was a source of courage. The spread of thyme throughout Europe was thought to be due to the Romans, as they used it to purify their rooms and to &quot;give an aromatic flavour to cheese and liqueurs&quot;. In the European Middle Ages, the herb was placed beneath pillows to aid sleep and ward off nightmares. In this period, women also often gave knights and warriors gifts that included thyme leaves, because it was believed to bring courage to the bearer. Thyme was also used as incense and placed on coffins during funerals, because it was supposed to ensure passage into the next life.

The bee balms &quot;Monarda fistulosa&quot; and &quot;Monarda didyma&quot;, North American wildflowers, are natural sources of thymol. The Blackfoot Native Americans recognized these plants&#x27; strong antiseptic action and used poultices of the plants for skin infections and minor wounds. A tisane made from them was also used to treat mouth and throat infections caused by dental caries and gingivitis.

Thymol was first isolated by German chemist Caspar Neumann in 1719. In 1853, French chemist Alexandre Lallemand (1816-1886) named thymol and determined its empirical formula. Antiseptic properties of thymol were discovered in 1875, and it was first synthesized by Swedish chemist Oskar Widman (1852-1930) in 1882.

==Extraction==

The conventional method of extracting is hydro-distillation (HD), but can also be extracted with solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME). In 30 minutes, SFME yields similar amounts of thymol with more oxygenated compounds than 4.5 hours of hydro-distillation at atmospheric pressures without the need for solvent.

==Uses==
Thymol during the 1910s was the treatment of choice for hookworm infection in the United States. People of the Middle East continue to use za&#x27;atar, a delicacy made with large amounts of thyme, to reduce and eliminate internal parasites. It is also used as a preservative in halothane, an anaesthetic, and as an antiseptic in mouthwash. When used to reduce plaque and gingivitis, thymol has been found to be more effective when used in combination with chlorhexidine than when used purely by itself. Thymol is also the active antiseptic ingredient in some toothpastes, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Euthymol. Thymol has been used to successfully control varroa mites and prevent fermentation and the growth of mold in bee colonies. Thymol is also used as a rapidly degrading, non-persisting pesticides such as insecticides and fungicides which are leveraged in plant care products, where its environmentally friendly, rapid degradation ensures it doesn’t leave persistent residues while effectively controlling pests and fungal issues. Thymol can also be used as a medical disinfectant and general purpose disinfectant. Thymol is also used in the production of menthol through the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring.

* &quot;Thymus praecox&quot;
* &quot;Thymus vulgaris&quot;

* &quot;Trachyspermum ammi&quot;

==Toxicology and environmental impacts==
In 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reviewed the research literature on the toxicology and environmental impact of thymol and concluded that &quot;thymol has minimal potential toxicity and poses minimal risk&quot;.

===Environmental breakdown and use as a pesticide===
Studies have shown that hydrocarbon monoterpenes and thymol in particular degrade rapidly (DT50 16 days in water, 5 days in soil) in the environment and are, thus, low risks because of rapid dissipation and low bound residues, supporting the use of thymol as a pesticide agent that offers a safe alternative to other more persistent chemical pesticides that can be dispersed in runoff and produce subsequent contamination. Though, there has been recent research into sustained released systems for botanically derived pesticides, such as using natural polysaccharides which would be biodegradable and biocompatible.

<text>Diceros (Greek: &quot;two&quot; (dio), &quot;horn&quot; (keratos)) is a genus of rhinoceros containing the extant black rhinoceros &quot;(Diceros bicornis)&quot; and several extinct species.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Diceros&quot; is more closely related to the genus &quot;Ceratotherium&quot; (which contains the white rhinoceros) than it is to other living rhinoceroses, with the clade containing the two comprising the tribe Dicerotini (also spelled Diceroti) or subtribe Dicerotina.

&quot;Diceros&quot; has been suggested by some authors to have branched off from an early species of &quot;Ceratotherium&quot;, specifically &quot;C. neumayri,&quot; which has also been assigned to &quot;Diceros&quot; in some studies. However, other authors have disputed the close relationship between &quot;Diceros&quot; and &quot;&quot;C&quot;. neumayri.&quot;

The oldest species assigned to the genus is &quot;&quot;Diceros&quot; australis&quot; from the Early Miocene of Namibia, dating to around 17-18 million years ago. It is only known from fragmentary remains, and its assignment to the genus, and even to Dicerotini have been questioned by other authors. Other species assigned to the genus include &quot;Diceros praecox&quot; from the Late Miocene (from about 7 million years ago) and the Pliocene of Sub-Saharan Africa. &quot;D. praecox&quot; has been suggested by some authors to be the ancestor of the modern &quot;D. bicornis&quot;. &quot;Diceros primaevus&quot; is known from the Late Miocene (c. 12-10 million years ago) of Algeria. &quot;Diceros douariensis&quot; is known from the Late Miocene of Tunisia and possibly Ethiopia. Some authors have assigned this species to &quot;Ceratotherium.&quot; The species &quot;Diceros gansuensis&quot; has been reported from the Late Miocene of China, dating to around 10 million years ago. The earliest remains assigned to the modern black rhinoceros are known the Late Miocene (around 7 million years ago) of East Africa, though other authors have considered the earliest remains of the species to date to the earliest Pleistocene around 2.6 million years ago at Koobi Fora, Kenya.

<text>Firewall is a crime novel by Swedish author Henning Mankell.

==Synopsis==
A series of bizarre incidents sweep across Sweden: a man dies in front of an ATM, two young women slaughter an elderly taxi driver, a murder is committed aboard a Baltic Sea ferry, and a sub-station engineer makes a gruesome discovery while investigating the cause of a nationwide power cut. As Wallander investigates, he uncovers a sinister plan to bring the Western world to its knees.

===Theme===

The major background theme around which the action takes place is the dilemma of the Western economic system versus poverty. The criminal mastermind is a persuasive and talented IT specialist who plans to right the wrongs of the world by deleting vast quantities of money from multinational banks&#x27; accounts system, so bringing on a credit and financial panic.

The criminals believe their intended cybercrime is justified; for them the big picture involves the sacrifice of the banking system in order to wipe out third world debt. At a crucial moment Wallander unwittingly manages to persuade a key accomplice that, ethically, there is in fact no big picture, that instead we just have lives that are fragile but also miraculous.

== Adaptations ==
In 2006, Swedish production company Tre Vänner Produktion produced a four-part television miniseries adaptation of &quot;Firewall&quot;, starring Rolf Lassgård as Wallander. In 2008, British broadcaster BBC One broadcast a 90-minute adaptation as part of its &quot;Wallander&quot; television series starring Kenneth Branagh.</text><links>

<text>Dicerorhinus (Greek: &quot;two&quot; (dio), &quot;horn&quot; (keratos), &quot;nose&quot; (rhinos)) is a genus of the family Rhinocerotidae, consisting of a single extant species, the two-horned Sumatran rhinoceros (&quot;D. sumatrensis&quot;), and several extinct species. The genus likely originated from the Late Miocene of central Myanmar. Many species previously placed in this genus probably belong elsewhere&quot;.&quot;

==Taxonomy==
Species provisionally considered valid include:
* †&quot;Dicerorhinus fusuiensis&quot; originally described as &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; &quot;fusuiensis&quot; Early Pleistocene, South China.
* †&quot;Dicerorhinus gwebinensis&quot; Known from a skull of Pliocene-Early Pleistocene age found in Myanmar. Some authors have considered the skull not distinguishable from that of &quot;D. sumatrensis&quot;.

Historically, &quot;Dicerorhinus&quot; was a wastebasket taxon. Revisions by several authors over the years have removed many species:

Transferred to &quot;Stephanorhinus&quot;

<text>The Magic Roundabout in Swindon, England, is a ring junction constructed in 1972 consisting of five mini-roundabouts arranged in a circle. Located near the County Ground, home of Swindon Town F.C., its name comes from the popular children&#x27;s television series &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot;. In 2009, it was voted the fourth-scariest junction in Britain.

==History==

=== Concept ===

The roundabout was constructed according to the design of Frank Blackmore, of the British Transport and Road Research Laboratory. Traffic flow around the inner circle is anticlockwise, and traffic flows in the usual clockwise manner around the five mini-roundabouts on the outer loop.

=== The roundabout ===

The complex junction offers multiple paths between feeder roads. The outer circle carries traffic in a clockwise direction, like a normal roundabout (in places where traffic drives on the left side of the road), and less proficient users may choose to use only the outer circle. The inner circle carries traffic in an anticlockwise direction, and more proficient users may choose to use the alternative paths.

Virtually the same overall configuration has been in place for years.

When the roundabout complex was first opened, the mini-roundabouts were not permanently marked out and could be reconfigured while the layout was fine-tuned. A police officer was stationed at each mini roundabout during this pilot phase to oversee how drivers coped with the unique arrangement.

The roundabout is built over a section of the old Wilts &amp; Berks Canal—Swindon wharf. A narrow, stone bridge built , which is a Grade II listed building, carried the old Saxon way known as Drove Road over the canal half a mile (800 m) east of the town centre. Its site became covered by Drove Roundabout, which was later redeveloped as the Magic Roundabout. A wharf occupied one edge and the area was known as the Marsh. The Wilts &amp; Berks Canal Trust are currently in negotiations with Swindon Council to include in the New Swindon Regeneration Framework plans to restore the canal through the town centre. The restoration would use the route of the North Wilts Canal and not the main West Vale route that the Magic Roundabout sits over. The North Wilts Canal was a separate branch which exited the town northwards through Moredon.

A calendar is produced each year by the UK Roundabout Appreciation Society depicting the town&#x27;s finest examples. The official name of the roundabout used to be County Islands, but it was changed in the late 1980s to match its popular name.

In 2005, it was voted the worst roundabout in a survey of the general public by a UK insurance company. In September 2007, the Magic Roundabout was named as one of the world&#x27;s worst junctions by a UK motoring magazine. In December 2007, BBC News reported a survey identifying The Magic Roundabout as one of the &quot;10 Scariest Junctions in the United Kingdom&quot;; however, the roundabout provides a better throughput of traffic than other designs and has an excellent safety record, since traffic moves too slowly to do serious damage in the event of a collision.

The roundabout in Drove Road is not the only one in Swindon that worked on the same principle; until recently, the roundabout at Bruce Street Bridges had a similar layout, but had only four entry/exit points. It was converted into a conventional roundabout in 2016.

<text>The Royal Engineers Association Football Club is an association football team representing the Corps of Royal Engineers, the &#x27;Sappers&#x27;, of the British Army and based in Chatham, Kent. In the 1870s, it was one of the strongest sides in English football, winning the FA Cup in 1875 and being Cup finalists in three of the first four seasons. The Engineers were pioneers of the combination game, where teammates passed the ball to each other rather than kicking ahead and charging after the ball. With the rise of professional teams, in 1888 the Engineers joined a newly formed Army Football Association.

==History==
The club was founded in 1863, under the leadership of Major Francis Marindin; the earliest game recorded for the Engineers against a non-military side is a 3–0 home win over No Names Club in March 1867. Sir Frederick Wall, who was the secretary of The Football Association 1895–1934, stated in his memoirs that the &quot;combination game&quot; was first used by the Royal Engineers A.F.C. in the early 1870s. Wall states that the &quot;Sappers moved in unison&quot; and showed the &quot;advantages of combination over the old style of individualism&quot;.

Contemporary match reports confirm that passing was a regular feature of the Engineers&#x27; style. An 1869 report says they &quot;worked well together&quot; and &quot;had learned the secret of football success – backing up&quot;; whereas their defeated opponents had &quot;a painful want of cooperation&quot;. In February 1871 against Crystal Palace it is noted that &quot;Lieut. Mitchell made a fine run down the left, passing the ball to Lieut. Rich, who had run up the centre, and who pinched another [goal]&quot; 

By early 1868, a contemporary match report states &quot;For the R.E.s Lieuts Campbell, Johnson and Chambers attracted especial attention by their clever play&quot;

Another contemporary match report clearly shows that by 1870, ball passing was a feature of the Engineers style: &quot;Lieut. Creswell, who having brought it up the side then kicked it into the middle to another of his side, who kicked it through the posts the minute before time was called&quot;

The Engineers used their team playing style with effect against the Wanderers, a side considered as early as 1870 to be the MCC of football. In a match of March 1871 against Wanderers their victory was due to &quot;irreproachable organisation&quot; and in particular that both their attacks and their backing up were both &quot;so well organised&quot; In November 1871 similar passing tactics are described in a contemporary account of a game against the Wanderers in which two goals were scored through tactical passing: &quot;Betts, however, soon seized his opportunity, and by a brilliant run down the left wing turned the ball judiciously to Currie, who as judiciously sent it flying through the strangers&#x27; goal in first rate style&quot; Later in the match it is reported that &quot;Lieut G Barker, turning the ball to Lieut Renny-Tailyour who planted it between the posts&quot; &quot;Turning&quot; the ball clearly points to the short pass.

There is evidence that opponents sometimes adjusted their playing style to counteract the organisation and passing of the Engineers. For example, in February 1872 against Westminster School, a brief contemporary match report states that: &quot;The school captain took the precaution of strengthening his backs, deputizing HDS Vidal to cooperate with Rawson and Jackson and so well did these three play in concert... they succeeded in defying the... RE forwards&quot;. What is most notable about this report is that it confirms that the Royal Engineers &quot;played beautifully together&quot; That the engineers were the first side to break the trend of dribbling is shown in a contemporary account of their victory against Crystal Palace in early 1872. This said that: &quot;very little dribbling was displayed&quot; 

The Engineers played in the first-ever FA Cup Final, losing 1–0 at Kennington Oval on 16 March 1872, to regular rivals Wanderers. They also lost the 1874 Final, to Oxford University A.F.C.

The Royal Engineers were the first football team to go on a tour, to Nottingham, Derby and Sheffield in 1873. Wall&#x27;s memoirs state that this tour introduced the combination game to Sheffield and Nottingham. In 1875 the Engineers won the FA Cup, considered their greatest triumph. In the final against Old Etonians, they drew 1–1 with a goal from Renny-Tailyour and went on to win the replay 2–0 with a further goal from Renny-Tailyour after a goal from a scrimmage.

The winning side was:
* Capt. W. Merriman; Lt. G.H. Sim; Lt. G.C. Onslow; Lt. R.M. Ruck; Lt. P.G. von Donop; Lt. C.K. Wood; Lt. H.E. Rawson; Lt. W.F.H. Stafford; Lt. H. W. Renny-Tailyour; Lt. A. Mein; and Lt. C. Wingfield-Stratford.

Their last FA Cup Final appearance came in 1878, again losing to the Wanderers. The Engineers continued to compete until the introduction of qualifying rounds in 1888–89, but with ever diminishing returns; in the first round in 1884–85, the club lost 10–1 at Great Marlow, the club&#x27;s heaviest competitive defeat. Its final tie in the competition was a 5–1 defeat at the Crusaders of Brentwood in the first qualifying round in 1888–89. 

===Summary of the Royal Engineers early playing style===
The evidence above contains detailed descriptions of passing that are lacking in reports of the 1872 Glasgow international. For example, in a lengthy account the Scotsman newspaper makes no mention of passing or combination by the Scottish team and specifically describes the Scottish attacks in terms of dribbling: &quot;The Scotch now came away with a great rush, Leckie and others dribbling the ball so smartly that the English lines were closely besieged and the ball was soon behind&quot; and &quot;Weir now had a splendid run for Scotland into the heart of his opponents&#x27; territory&quot;. Although the Scottish team are acknowledged to have worked better together during the first half, this contemporary account acknowledges that in the second half England played similarly: &quot;During the first half of the game the English team did not work so well together, but in the second half they left nothing to be desired in this respect.&quot; The Scotsman concludes that the difference in styles in the first half is the advantage the Queens&#x27; Park players had &quot;through knowing each others&#x27; play&quot; as all came from the same club. Unlike the 1872 Glasgow international, the contemporary evidence above shows that the Engineers&#x27; team playing style benefited their team play by winning games. Similarly, the 5 March 1872 match between Wanderers and Queens Park contains no evidence of ball passing.

The early accounts all confirm that the Engineers were the first club to play a passing game of cooperation and organisation with both their forwards and their defence. Although they could also play rough – as would be expected for an army team – The Engineers are the first side to be considered to play the football &quot;beautifully&quot;. All of these developments occurred before and independent of the 1872 match between England and Scotland.

===Ireland===
It was not only in England that the Engineers helped pioneer association football. While stationed in Ireland during the early 1900s the Royal Engineers, together with other British Army regimental teams organised and competed in local competitions. In 1902–03 
the Engineers won the Munster Senior Cup. The regiment also entered teams in the Munster Senior League.

===Later years===
Professionalism arrived in Northern England in the 1880s, with the Football League starting in 1888. In the early years, the Engineers was one of several amateur teams who could defeat the professionals in challenge matches.

The Army Football Association was formed in 1888. Its teams were organised by battalion, and later by regiment.

The Engineers&#x27; Depot Battalion won the FA Amateur Cup in 1908.

On 7 November 2012, the Royal Engineers played against the Wanderers in a rematch of the 1872 FA Cup Final at The Oval. Unlike the actual final, the Engineers won, and by a large margin, 7–1 being the final score.

Ladies team

In 2014, Keith Stubbs founded the REAFC Ladies squad which runs in line with the male squad.

Veterans

REAFC have a serving veterans team that play in exhibition type games. Recently the &quot;Vets&quot; have played games against the House of parliament and invited to some prestigious events.

==Colours==

The club has worn scarlet and blue hoops since its foundation in 1863.

==Ground==

The club plays on the Chatham Lines, originally marking out a pitch where available, but now a formal set of pitches at the barracks.

<doc id="890114" wikidata="Q445633" url="?curid=890114" title="Clunies-Ross family">
<text>The Clunies-Ross family were the original settlers of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, a small archipelago in the Indian Ocean. From 1827 to 1978, the family ruled the previously uninhabited islands as a private fiefdom, initially as &quot;terra nullius&quot; and then later under British (1857–1955) and Australian (1955–1978) sovereignty. The head of the family was usually recognised as the resident magistrate, and was sometimes styled as the &quot;King of the Cocos Islands&quot;; a title given by the press.

==History==
===John Clunies-Ross===
John Clunies-Ross was a merchant born in Weisdale, Shetland on 23 August 1786. In 1813 he was at Timor as Third Mate on board the whaler &quot;Baroness Longueville&quot; when he received the opportunity to become captain of the brig &quot;Olivia&quot;, which he took. He reportedly first cruised the waters of the then uninhabited Cocos (Keeling) Islands in 1825. After surveying them he moved his family to live on one of the islands in 1827. Only Joshua Slocum used different dates, when he wrote that &quot;John Clunis-Ross, who in 1814 touched [the island] in the ship &quot;Borneo&quot; on a voyage to India&quot;, nailed up a Union Jack with plans to settle in the future and &quot;[...] returned 2 years later with his wife and family&quot;. 

In 1823 an English adventurer, Alexander Hare, had settled on another of the islands with some runaway slaves. Hare soon departed, and Clunies-Ross alone obtained permanent rights by settlement. He planted hundreds of coconut palms and brought in Malay workers to the islands to harvest the nuts, building a business by selling copra. In the beginning, Javanese convicts were used as labourers and &quot;crime of all kinds was rife&quot;, before &quot;getting rid of the criminal class and obtaining a better type of Malay coolie.&quot;

According to a 1903 article in &quot;The Timaru Herald&quot;, Ross &quot;[ran] his little colony on model lines and succeeded beyond expectation&quot; and Charles Darwin mentioned after his 1836 visit with HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; that he &quot;found the natives in a state of freedom&quot;. However, the article omitted the sentence that immediately followed: &quot;but in most other points they are considered as slaves&quot;. Ross traded with Dutch vessels en route to Dutch ports on Java and Sumatra, and became a naturalised Dutch subject; he had approached both the British and the Dutch government for annexation but neither had responded. John Clunies-Ross died in 1854.

His life was dramatised in the play &quot;John Ross, King of Cocos Islands&quot;.

===John George Clunies-Ross===
His son John George Clunies-Ross (born 1823) took over from his father under the name of Ross II. In 1857 British Captain Stephen Grenville Fremantle visited aboard who &quot;took possession of the islands in the name of the Britannic Majesty&#x27;s Government&quot;. Fremantle appointed John George as superintendent of the islands and left after a 3-month vacation. The connection to Britain changed nothing in Ross&#x27;s autonomous administration, and it was not until fifteen years later another British ship arrived for a complete survey of the island. Apparently, Fremantle annexed the islands by mistake, thinking he had arrived on the Coco Islands of the Andaman Islands.

John George Clunies-Ross received the Malay title of Tuan Pandai (&#x27;the learned one&#x27;) due to his amateur medical knowledge and research into the natural history of the islands. The head of the family Clunies-Ross kept the title &#x27;Tuan&#x27;, a term that can be translated as &#x27;sir&#x27;. He married S&#x27;pia Dupong, a Malay of high rank, in 1841.

===George Clunies-Ross===
Born on 20 June 1842 in the Cocos Islands to John George Clunies-Ross and S&#x27;pia Dupong, George Clunies-Ross was sent to Scotland where he studied engineering at Glasgow. In 1871, known as Tuan Tinggi, he became superintendent after his father died, then married Inin (1850–1889), a Malay of high-rank like his mother. It was during his administration, in 1885, that the first annual inspection by a representative of the Straits Settlements Government occurred.

In 1886 Queen Victoria granted the islands in perpetuity to the Clunies-Ross family. Representatives of the Government of the Straits Settlements were sent to the island each year and reports reflected that &quot;members of the Clunies-Ross family are to-day in every sense of the word proprietors of the islands, for Mr George Clunies-Ross makes his own laws and interprets them, polices his little domain, provides his own coinage [...] controls the entire trade and acts as &#x27;the universal provider&#x27; to satisfy the wants of the community&quot;. According to &quot;Chambers&#x27; Journal&quot;, there had not been any metallic coins since 1837. Six years after Inin&#x27;s death, George Clunies-Ross married Ayesha, a former &quot;boi&quot; (servant) in 1895.

In 1903, the islands were annexed to the Straits Settlements and incorporated as part of the settlement of Singapore, without affecting the ownership of the territory. George Clunies-Ross died on 7 July 1910 at Ventnor, in the Isle of Wight, after going to England for medical treatment. His body was taken back to the Cocos in 1914.

=== John Sidney Clunies-Ross ===
John Sidney Clunies-Ross was born in the Coco Islands on 13 November 1868, the son of George Clunies-Ross and Inin. Known as Tuan Ross, he inherited an economic disaster after a cyclone destroyed almost every house and coconut palm on Home Island in November 1909.

During the Second World War, the Cocos islands served as a major base for the Royal Air Force. John Sidney Clunies-Ross died of a heart attack during a Japanese bombing on the islands in August 1944. The British military took over control of Home Island until John Cecil Clunies-Ross returned to the Cocos on 6 July 1946.

===John Cecil Clunies-Ross===
The title to the islands was claimed by the Ross family until 1978, when John Cecil Clunies-Ross (born 29 November 1928), known as Tuan John, sold them to the Commonwealth of Australia for £2.5m ($4.75m) under threat of expropriation, with the exception of his house on Home Island, which was eventually purchased by the government in 1993. The Commonwealth had already been administering the islands since November 1955, with the proclamation of the Cocos (Keeling) Island Act 1955.

John C. Clunies-Ross eventually went bankrupt after the Australian government refused to give any business to his shipping line company. He then moved to Perth with his wife. During the 1984 referendum, he campaigned for independence but the majority of the islanders chose integration with Australia.

He died in Perth at the age of 92 on 13 September 2021.

==Legacy==
, John &quot;Johnny&quot; George Clunies-Ross (born 1957), the son of John C. Clunies-Ross, lived on the West Island, breeding clams. He stated that he was initially frustrated with the 1978 transfer of the islands to Australia, but that he had changed his mind since then: &quot;I was 21 and I&#x27;d been brought up to do the job. But even in the old man&#x27;s time, it had become anachronistic. It had to change&quot;.

<doc id="890120" wikidata="Q165674" url="?curid=890120" title="Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein">
<text>Franz Joseph II (Franz Josef Maria Alois Alfred Karl Johannes Heinrich Michael Georg Ignaz Benediktus Gerhardus Majella; 16 August 1906 – 13 November 1989) was the reigning Prince of Liechtenstein from 25 July 1938 until his death in November 1989.

Franz Joseph was the son of Prince Alois of Liechtenstein and Archduchess Elisabeth Amalie of Austria. He succeeded his childless grand-uncle, Prince Franz I, after his father renounced his right of succession in his favour in 1923. He was an extremely popular sovereign in Liechtenstein. He was the first ruling prince to live full-time in the principality. He also oversaw the economic development of Liechtenstein from a poor agricultural backwater into one of the richest countries (per capita) in the world.

== Early life ==

Franz Joseph was born on 16 August 1906 in Schloss Frauenthal, Deutschlandsberg, Austria-Hungary as the first child of Prince Alois of Liechtenstein and Archduchess Elisabeth Amalie of Austria. He had 7 siblings throughout his lifetime. His god-parent was his great-uncle Franz Joseph I of Austria.

He spent most of his youth throughout various family-owned estates in Austria-Hungary (later Czechoslovakia), notably the Groß Ullersdorf castle in Moravia. He attended the Schottengymnasium in Vienna, where he graduated from in 1925 with a passion for mathematics, natural history and the Greek language. He then went on to study forestry at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna, which he received a diploma on forestry engineering in 1930.

Franz Joseph was made heir presumptive of Prince of Liechtenstein on 26 February 1923 when his father renounced his right of succession in his favour as he was concerned about his age should he assume the role. On 17 April 1930 Franz Joseph was appointed to be the deputy of Franz I, in which he frequently travelled between the principality as a representative of him. He also visited several European countries during this time and the United States.

==Reign==

=== Early reign ===

On 31 March 1938, Franz I made Franz Joseph his regent following the Anschluss of Austria. Franz I then moved to Feldsberg (Valtice), Czechoslovakia, and on 25 July, he died while at one of his family&#x27;s castles. Franz Joseph II formally succeeded him as the Prince of Liechtenstein.

Although officially Franz stated that he had given the regency to Franz Joseph due to his old age, it was speculated that he did not wish to remain in control of Liechtenstein if Nazi Germany were to invade, primarily because his wife, Elisabeth von Gutmann was of Jewish relation. Upon becoming Prince of Liechtenstein in 1938, Franz Joseph settled permanently in the principality, making him the first ruling prince to live there full-time.

=== World War II ===

Liechtenstein remained neutral throughout World War II, and its neutrality was not violated by any of the combatants. Franz Joseph supported then Prime Minister of Liechtenstein Josef Hoop&#x27;s policy of non-binding, non-provocative diplomacy towards Nazi Germany while personally tying the country as closely as possible to Switzerland during the war in hopes of retaining Liechtenstein&#x27;s neutrality. He visited the Swiss Federal Council in April 1938 and again in 1943, along with to Victor Emmanuel III of Italy in November 1941.

Franz Joseph oversaw the formation of a coalition government between the Progressive Citizens&#x27; Party and the Patriotic Union that would prevent government deadlock and help retain Liechtenstein&#x27;s neutrality.

In March 1939 he along with Josef Hoop paid an official visit to Berlin where they met Adolf Hitler and Joachim von Ribbentrop where they discussed safeguarding Liechtenstein&#x27;s independence and neutrality while maintaining good relations. Franz Joseph later reminisced on the visit and stated that Hitler showed little interest in them and that it only took place in order to &quot;flatter Hitler&#x27;s ego&quot;.

While this visit was ongoing, the German National Movement in Liechtenstein (VBDL) staged an amateurish coup attempt, first trying to provoke a intervention from Nazi Germany by burning swastikas, followed by declaring an &quot;Anschluß&quot; with Germany. The leaders were almost immediately arrested and the hoped-for German invasion failed to materialise. Despite this, he periodically sent congratulatory letters to Hitler throughout the war, such as the thwarting of the 20 July plot, of which he briefly replied.

During the war, Liechtenstein’s princely family owned land in Austria whose managers hired Nazi forced labour, but a much later inquiry found the family not to have known about this. In 1945 all the family’s estates in Czechoslovakia and Poland were expropriated without compensation by the Third Czechoslovak Republic and the Provisional Government of Poland.

Just before the end of the war, Franz Joseph granted political asylum to First Russian National Army pro-Axis pro-emperor Vladimir White emigres led by General Boris Smyslovsky, who were being cared for by the Liechtenstein Red Cross. On 16 August 1945, the Soviet Union sent a delegation to Liechtenstein in an attempt to repatriate the Russians, which was refused despite increasing Soviet pressure to participate in the repatriation program. Eventually the government of Argentina offered the Russians asylum, and about a hundred people left.

According to Alexander Frick, Prime Minister of Liechtenstein at the time, the Russians were at no point in danger of being extradited. Franz Joseph had explicitly given support for the asylum of the Russians. The general population of Liechtenstein supported the government in providing asylum to the Russians.

=== Later life ===
After losing roughly 80% of their property, Franz Joseph and his family sought to sell artworks from their collection in order to generate income, such as Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s Ginevra de&#x27; Benci in 1967 and Frans Hals&#x27;s Willem van Heythuysen portrait that was sold to the Bavarian State Painting Collections in 1969.

Franz Joseph oversaw a family-owned bank which was run by the House of Liechtenstein with branches in London, Zürich, New York City and Frankfurt. This made the principality an ideal tax haven for wealthy individuals and private foreign companies, allowing Liechtenstein to experience rapid economic growth throughout his reign, transforming the principality into one of the richest countries in the world.

Franz Joseph played a role in maintaining Liechtenstein&#x27;s diplomatic relations. He and Georgina von Wilczek hosted Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Charles III (then Prince of Wales) and Anne, Princess Royal in the Vaduz Castle on 29 December 1965 and again for Prince Philip and Elizabeth II in April 1980. During his reign, women received voting rights for the first time, following a referendum on the topic (among men only) in 1984. That same year, he appointed Maria Foser as the first woman Deputy Government Councillor for Social Affairs. He exercised his veto power just once, in 1985, against a new hunting law that would have granted increased rights to hunters. He explained this by saying “It was a silly law. It would have turned every garden into a shooting ground&quot;.

Franz Joseph handed over most of his powers to his son, Hans-Adam on 26 August 1984. Franz Joseph II had been suffering from poor health and died on 13 November 1989, 26 days after his wife. Ruling Liechtenstein for 51 years, he was among the longest-ruling sovereigns in Europe and the longest-serving national leader in the world at the time of his death. He was succeeded by his son Hans-Adam as Hans-Adam II.

==Marriage and children==

On 7 March 1943, at St. Florin&#x27;s in Vaduz, Franz Joseph II married Countess Georgina of Wilczek (24 October 1921 – 18 October 1989). It was the first time that the wedding of a ruling Prince had taken place in Liechtenstein. They had five children, twelve grandchildren and nineteen great-grandchildren:

<doc id="890125" wikidata="Q7941496" url="?curid=890125" title="Von Neumann programming languages">
<text>A von Neumann language in computing is a programming language that is a high-level abstract isomorphic copy of a von Neumann architecture. , most current programming languages fit into this description, likely as a consequence of the extensive domination of the von Neumann computer architecture during the past 50 years.

The differences between Fortran, C, and even Java, although considerable, are ultimately constrained by all three being based on the programming style of the von Neumann computer. If, for example, Java objects were all executed in parallel with asynchronous message passing and attribute-based declarative addressing, then Java would not be in the group.

The isomorphism between von Neumann programming languages and architectures is in the following manner:

* program variables ↔ computer storage cells
* control statements ↔ computer test-and-jump instructions
* assignment statements ↔ fetching, storing instructions
* expressions ↔ memory reference and arithmetic instructions.

==Criticism==
John Backus asserted that assignment statements in von Neumann languages split programming into two worlds. The first world consists of &quot;expressions&quot;, an orderly mathematical space with potentially useful algebraic properties: most computation takes place here. The second world consists of &quot;statements&quot;, a disorderly mathematical space with few useful mathematical properties (structured programming can be seen as a limited heuristic that does apply in this space, though).

Backus claimed that by 1978 there existed in computer science a vicious cycle where the long-standing emphasis on von Neumann languages has continued the primacy of the von Neumann computer architecture, and dependency on it has made non-von Neumann languages uneconomical and thus limited their further development: the lack of widely available and effective non-von Neumann languages has deprived computer designers of the motivation and the intellectual foundation needed to develop new computer architectures.

==Presence in modern systems==
Many modern processors now contain multiple processing cores, and multi-threaded programming is usually the most efficient way to use more computational power in a single program. Some modern processors are highly optimized with techniques including out-of-order execution, but with complex logic to detect when this can be done without violating the von Neumann semantics of the logical programming model. Separate instruction and data caches are widely used, making the hardware a Modified Harvard architecture, but again with logic to detect cases where the optimization fails, to be able to execute self-modifying code.

Some specialized processors (including GPUs) are very wide multiple instruction, multiple data (MIMD) devices. General-purpose CPUs do commonly have multiple cores, but each one is fast enough that many programs are fast enough without parallelizing single tasks. (Threads are commonly used to deal with asynchronous inputs or outputs, especially in a GUI.) General-purpose CPUs are technically MIMD devices, but usually only hardware designed from the ground up for MIMD programming is referred to as MIMD.

Many widely used programming languages such as C, C++ and Java have ceased to be strictly von Neumann by adding support for parallel processing, in the form of threads. However, most of the categorically &quot;non&quot;-von Neumann languages are also functional languages and have not achieved widespread use.

<doc id="890135" wikidata="Q4835016" url="?curid=890135" title="White City Place">
<text>White City Place is the name given to the collection of buildings formerly known as BBC Media Village (more commonly simply as [[White City, London|White City]] or [[London W12|W12]] within the BBC). White City Place is a collection of six buildings occupying a 17-acre site off Wood Lane, White City in West London, bordered by South Africa Road, Dorando Close and the A40 Westway. The site is a short distance along Wood Lane from BBC Television Centre. All formerly properties of the BBC, only two buildings – Broadcast Centre and the Lighthouse – are currently occupied by BBC staff. 

The BBC sold the majority of buildings on the site in 2015 and it was renamed White City Place by new owners Stanhope and Mitsui Fudosan.

==BBC White City==

The first building on the site, BBC White City, was designed by architects Scott Brownrigg &amp; Turner and was opened in 1990. Built on the site of the 1908 Franco-British Exhibition, White City was constructed on the location of the former White City Stadium (The Great Stadium) used for the 1908 Summer Olympics. The stadium was demolished in 1985 and parts of the Olympic swimming pool were also discovered when the foundations of the new building were laid.

The building was originally intended to be a new home for BBC Radio, replacing Broadcasting House. This plan was scrapped and the building instead became office space with fifty edit suites, various Television production teams, the Digital Switchover team, BBC Academy, the Children in Need charity and parts of Operations and HR, as well as a large restaurant.

It housed most of the BBC&#x27;s current affairs and factual and learning programmes, such as &quot;Panorama&quot;, &quot;Top Gear&quot; (where it featured in a segment about the Peel P50), &quot;Watchdog&quot; and many others. The BBC vacated the building in March 2013 and sold it to developers. It has sometimes been referred to as White City One to distinguish it from the wider site.

Architectural critic Jonathan Glancey wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2002 that by comparison to the &quot;handsome, if timeworn ships of the line&quot; such as Broadcasting House and Bush House, White City was &quot;a tin-pot freighter, inefficient, ugly, and old before its time.&quot; Rachid Errtibi, a facilities coordinator at the BBC reflected that &quot;most staff disliked the White City building for one reason or another [but] the building did have a unique character, and was flexible enough to accommodate any new departments at short notice – achieved simply and quickly by putting up a few glass partition panels and rearranging furniture, at minimum cost.&quot;

==Media Village==

===Development===
Construction of the second phase of the development began in September 2001 and the site was officially opened in May 2004 and was known as the Media Village. It consists of five further buildings in addition to White City One – Media Centre, Broadcast Centre, Energy Centre, Garden House and the Lighthouse. The buildings were designed by Allies and Morrison Architects and Buro Happold and built by Bovis Lend Lease. In addition to BBC offices, the site included a post office, a Tesco Express, a Starbucks, a Davy&#x27;s wine bar and several other retail outlets, many of which have now been replaced. To pay for construction costs, the BBC signed a 30-year deal with Land Securities Trillium, Britain&#x27;s largest property developer.

The rear of Media Centre included gardens designed by Christopher Bradley-Hole. A poem &quot;Voices of White City&quot; by Poet Laureate Andrew Motion was inlaid into the paving in the piazza. The site featured artworks such as Simon Patterson&#x27;s art wall in Broadcast Centre which is based on First World War dazzle camouflage and Yuko Shiraishi&#x27;s mural in Media Centre reception. She was also responsible for the overall colour scheme in both buildings. Energy Centre features the Olympic Rings as a marker of the finishing line of the 1908 Olympic marathon, with a plaque unveiled by IOC president Jacques Rogge in 2005.

A further planned building, the Music Box, designed by Foreign Office Architects was originally scheduled for opening in 2006, but was cancelled in 2008 before construction began. It would have been a concert hall and recording venue for the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, the BBC Concert Orchestra and the BBC Singers.

===Occupants===
In 2004, it was intended that the Garden House and Lighthouse would be leased by independent production companies working with the BBC. 

The Media Centre was the global headquarters for the BBC&#x27;s for-profit publishing subsidiary BBC Worldwide from 2008 until 2015, when it moved into the former BBC News annex of Television Centre. Media Centre also housed non-broadcast divisions of the BBC which had been moved from central London to make way for the redevelopment of Broadcasting House. Media Centre was used for broadcasts of &quot;Watchdog&quot; and &quot;Rogue Traders&quot; as well as a filming location for &quot;The Thick of It&quot;.

Some BBC Television-making departments were located in Media Centre following the vacating of Television Centre in 2013 including Comedy, Entertainment &amp; Events and Factual. The BBC then left Media Centre and Garden House, with staff relocated to Broadcast Centre, Broadcasting House, Grafton House and some to MediaCityUK in Salford. Media Centre and Garden House closed on 10 July 2015 following the sale to Stanhope and Mitsui Fudosan. It was stated that the BBC received £87 million for the sale.

At the time of its closure in July 2015, Garden House was mainly occupied by Atos and associated sub-contractors&#x27; teams following the sale of BBC Technology to Siemens in 2004.

Broadcast Centre continued to house BBC Design &amp; Engineering staff, BBC Global News, BBC Studios production staff and Marketing and Audiences staff until 2020. The majority of the building is now leased to ITV following the closure of The London Studios. 

Red Bee Media broadcasts BBC One, BBC Two, BBC News, Channel 4, Channel 5, BT Sport from Broadcast Centre. 

The Energy Centre provides services to the entire site, and between 2008 and 2018 was the offices for the &quot;Top Gear&quot; television production team and the &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine team. They moved into the main BBC Studios offices in Broadcast Centre in 2018. &quot;The One Show&quot; studio was located in the Energy Centre from 2007 to 2013 before moving to the newly built Peel Wing of Broadcasting House. 

In March 2019, BBC Research &amp; Development moved into the Lighthouse building, having vacated Centre House on Wood Lane.

A new building, Gateway Central, was constructed in 2022 and will be the headquarters of L&#x27;Oréal.

==White City Place==
Under new owners Stanhope and Mitsui Fudosan, the site has been renamed White City Place and an extensive refurbishment and refitting of the vacated properties on the site has taken place. The former Media Centre was renamed to The MediaWorks and a significant renovation of White City One, renamed to The WestWorks, changed its main entrance and introduced a row of shops facing the piazza.

<text>Orgueil (; ) is a commune in the Tarn-et-Garonne department in the Occitanie region in southern France.

==History==
Orgueil has existed for more than 1000 years. It was first mentioned in the 9th century, when Orgueil was part of Saint-Sernin Abbaye in Toulouse.

On 14 May 1864 a rare carbonaceous chondrite meteorite landed there, now known as the Orgueil meteorite. For research purposes, it was split up into several pieces which can now be seen in museums in Europe and the United States. The Museum d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle of Montauban in Tarn-et-Garonne, France has a large piece of the meteorite that weighs eleven kilograms.

==Economy==
Orgueil is also a wine-producing region: the red grape &quot;le frontonnais&quot; is cultivated there.

<doc id="890140" wikidata="Q347013" url="?curid=890140" title="Vratislaus II of Bohemia">
<text>Vratislaus II (or Wratislaus II) () ( 1032 – 14 January 1092), the son of Bretislaus I and Judith of Schweinfurt, was the first King of Bohemia as of 15 June 1085, his royal title granted as a lifetime honorific from Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV that did not establish a hereditary monarchy. Before his elevation to the royal dignity, Vratislaus had ruled Bohemia as duke since 1061.

On his father&#x27;s death in 1055, Vratislaus became duke of Olomouc, whereas his older brother became Duke of Bohemia as Spytihněv II. He fell out with his brother and was exiled to Hungary. Vratislaus regained the ducal throne of Olomouc with Hungarian assistance and eventually reconciled with his brother, then succeeded him as duke of Bohemia when he died in 1061.

==Campaigns of Henry IV==
Both Pope Alexander II and Pope Gregory VII confirmed Vratislaus in the privilege of wearing the mitre and tunic which his predecessors had. Despite this, Vratislaus supported Henry in both the Investiture Controversy against the Popes and the rebellions in Saxony that dominated his long reign. These actions would negate the significance of the mitre.

Vratislaus was often at odds with his brother Jaromír, Bishop of Prague. Jaromír, for his part, ignored the creation of a new Moravian diocese in Olomouc by Vratislaus in 1063. Jaromir even went so far as to retake, by arms, the relics removed from Prague and taken to Moravia. Despite the pope&#x27;s support for Vratislaus&#x27; new see, the Bohemian duke was unswayed in his loyalty to the emperor.

The Saxons revolted under Duke Magnus of Saxony and Otto of Nordheim, Duke of Bavaria, in 1070 and Boleslaus of Poland attacked Bohemia in 1071. In August 1073, Henry responded with an invasion of Poland, but a new Saxon revolt drew him back in 1075. Vratislaus joined him, and they defeated the rebels on 9 June at the First Battle of Langensalza. The Bohemian troops showed conspicuous bravery. Henry then took Jaromír to Germany to be his chancellor under the name of Gebhard and Vratislaus was greatly relieved.

Vratislaus also took part in the wars against the anti-kings who opposed Henry&#x27;s rule and were elected by a faction of the nobility to replace him. At the Battle of Flarchheim, only through the aid of Vratislaus&#x27; contingent was the imperial army capable of overcoming the rebels of the papally-approved claimant Rudolf of Rheinfelden, Duke of Swabia. Vratislaus even succeeded in seizing Rudolf&#x27;s golden lance. The golden lance was then carried in front of Vratislaus on state occasions.

Vratislaus would defeat the rebels again at Mailberg in 1082, and it would be in thanks for this victory that Henry granted Vratislaus the title of king in 1085.

==Relations with the papacy==
Vratislaus requested permission to utilize Slavonic liturgy to the Roman Curia in 1080; the request was denied. This petition may have been made in an effort to save a &quot;Slavonic&quot; Benedictine monastery still in operation that was founded in Sazava, close to Prague, in 1032.

Vratislaus raised an army to serve in Henry&#x27;s Italian campaign of 1081. In 1083, Vratislaus and his Bohemians were with Henry when they entered Rome itself.

==Expansionism==

Vratislaus coveted the largely Slavic marches of Meissen and Lusatia, but, in spite of Henry&#x27;s promises and Bohemian successes against the rebellious margraves, he never received them. He held Lower Lusatia between 1075 and 1086, but in 1088, with the insurrection of Egbert II of Meissen, Henry granted the region to Henry of Ostmark. Vratislaus was thereafter cool to Henry&#x27;s military adventures. He never wavered in his loyalty, but he abstained from giving the emperor martial aid.

==Internal affairs==
It was a Přemyslid tradition that Moravia would be entrusted to the younger brothers of the ruling prince. In Vratislaus&#x27; case, his two younger brothers Conrad and Otto inherited Brno and Olomouc and the youngest, Jaromír, entered the church. However, enmity grew between the brothers. It was then that Vratislaus founded the diocese of Olmütz (diocese of Olomouc), under the Archbishopric of Mainz, to counter Otto&#x27;s authority within his province. Both pope and emperor took a hand in mediating the conflict, which was partially fixed with Henry&#x27;s appointment of Jaromír as chancellor in 1077. In April 1085, a &quot;reichstag&quot; convened in Mainz suppressed the Moravian see, but Vratislaus later re-founded see. Jaromír protested in Rome to Pope Urban II, but died in 1090 before a pope ruled on the matter.

Sadly for Vratislaus, his last years were occupied by dynastic quarrelling. When his brother Otto died in 1086, he gave Olomouc to his son Boleslaus, which was seen to be an act against the interests of Conrad. Vratislaus raised an army against Conrad and sent it out under his other son Bretislaus. This son turned on him. Vratislaus, in keeping with Bohemian custom, designated an heir: Conrad. Thus reconciled, the two attacked Bretislaus, who fled to Hungary.

Vratislaus died of a hunting wound on 14 January 1092 after a reign of thirty years. He was buried in St. Peter and Paul&#x27;s Church, Vyšehrad.

==Legacy==
Vratislaus frequently found himself in conflict with Bishop Jaromír of Prague and sought means to diminish the importance of the Bishop of Prague in domestic Bohemian politics. Among the actions he took were the re-establishment of the Bishopric of Olomouc in 1063 and the creation of the Vyšehrad Chapter in 1070. The latter was richly endowed independently of the Prague bishop, subject instead to the Holy See directly. His success in curbing the power of the Prague bishop helped to strengthen the Bohemian crown and enable later rulers to govern a more unified state. His policy towards the Holy Roman Empire set an example that would be followed in the twelfth century and would ultimately lead to the permanent elevation of Bohemia to the status of a kingdom at the beginning of the thirteenth century. The marriage alliances he was able to conclude with notable foreign princesses reflected the rising position of the Přemyslids among European dynasties. In contrast, Vratislaus&#x27;s father Bretislaus in 1019 had to abduct his wife, the minor noblewoman Judith of Schweinfurt, to secure any suitable consort at all. His successor continued to cultivate dynastic bonds with notable courts in central and eastern Europe.

==Family==
Vratislaus was married three times. His first wife Maria died during premature childbirth. He married the second time in 1057 to Adelaide, daughter of Andrew I of Hungary, who died in 1061. They had:
*Vratislaus (-1061)
*Judith (1056/58-1086), married to Ladislaus I Herman, son of Casimir I of Poland
*Ludmila (-after 1100)
*Bretislaus II of Bohemia (c. 1060–December 22, 1100), Duke of Bohemia

In 1062, Vratislaus married a third time to Swatawa of Poland, a daughter of Casimir I of Poland. They had five children:
*Boleslaus (-1091)
*Bořivoj II of Bohemia (c. 1064-February 2, 1124), Duke of Bohemia
*Vladislaus I of Bohemia (-April 12, 1125), Duke of Bohemia
*Soběslav I of Bohemia (-February 14, 1140), Duke of Bohemia
*Judith (c. 1066-9 December 1108), married to Wiprecht II of Groitzsch
