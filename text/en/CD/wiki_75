<text>Hammarby Fotboll, more commonly known as Hammarby IF or simply Hammarby ( ), is a Swedish professional football club from Stockholm founded in 1915. The club is based at Tele2 Arena in Johanneshov but founded in the neighbouring Södermalm district of Stockholm City Centre, an area that is considered the club&#x27;s heartland.

Competing in Sweden&#x27;s first tier, Allsvenskan, Hammarby are placed eighth in the all-time Allsvenskan table, and has won the league once, in 2001. The club has competed in the Svenska Cupen final five times, winning their first title in 2021.

The club&#x27;s colours are green and white, which are reflected in its crest and kit. Between 1918 and 1978, however, the club played in black-and-yellow striped home shirts, which since often form the club&#x27;s away colors.

It is known for its vociferous fans and for having the highest average attendance in the Nordic countries. Drawing inspiration from England, Hammarby fans introduced football chants to the Swedish terraces in 1970. Hammarby is one of largest football clubs in Europe in terms of the number of active players of all ages – with some 3,500 players in its organisation.

Hammarby is affiliated with the Stockholms Fotbollförbund (Stockholm Football Association).

==History==

In 1889, Hammarby Roddförening (&quot;Hammarby Rowing Association&quot;) was established in Södermalm, with engineer Axel Robert Schönthal, the first chairman, being credited as the founder. By 1897, it had diversified into different sports, and was renamed Hammarby Idrottsförening (&quot;Hammarby Sports Club&quot;), or Hammarby IF for short.

===1915–1940s: Establishment of football club===
In 1915, the sporting ground Hammarby IP was built in Södermalm. Due to a lack of football pitches in Stockholm, several other clubs proposed to merge with Hammarby IF to get access to the stadium. An offer from Klara SK was accepted and Hammarby officially established a football department on 13 August 1915. The club played its first competitive game two days later, and won 5–0 against Västerås SK in the &quot;Östsvenska serien&quot;, a local league, with Ragnar Gunnarsson scoring the inaugural goal. In 1916, Hammarby competed in Svenska Mästerskapet, a cup by then held to decide the Swedish Champions, for the first time. In 1918, Hammarby also merged with Johanneshofs IF, a club from the neighbouring district Johanneshov.

In 1920, Hammarby first competed in the Svenska Serien, by then the highest league in Swedish football, with key players like goalkeeper Victor Olsson, defender Gösta Wihlborg and forward Gustav Björk. During the upcoming years, Hammarby had a strong showing where they went to the finals of Svenska Mästerskapet in 1922, losing 1–3 to GAIS.

Hammarby qualified to compete in Allsvenskan&#x27;s inaugural season in 1924. On 3 August said year, Rikard Larsson became Hammarby&#x27;s first goalscorer in Allsvenskan, and also the first goalscorer in the league&#x27;s history, in a 1–5 loss against Örgryte IS. The club would eventually finish last in the 1924–25 Allsvenskan, and were relegated to Division 2, which was then the second highest league in Sweden.

During the upcoming years, Hammarby failed to produce any sort of challenge in Swedish football. Several star players emigrated to the United States, transferred to other clubs or opted to instead play ice hockey for Hammarby. In 1936–37 and 1937–38, the club won the second division, but lost the playoff matches that would have promoted them to Allsvenskan. Instead, Hammarby got promoted in 1938–39, where they knocked out IFK Norrköping following outstanding performances from goalkeeper and star player Sven Bergqvist.

Hammarby would, however, suffer from another relegation, finishing last in Allsvenskan in 1939–40. Back in Division 2, the club finished in the top four for the next six years. In the 1946–47 season, the club finished at the foot of the table, and because of a restructuring of the league system, the club got relegated to Division 4.

===1950s–1960s: A period of yo-yoing===

Hammarby did not return to the second highest league until the 1950–51 season. In the 1954–55 season, the club returned to Allsvenskan, but this time it finished sixth and managed to stay for another season. However, the club underwent yo-yoing, having been promoted and relegated between Allsvenskan and Division 2 seven times until 1970. Nacka Skoglund, one of the league&#x27;s top players who played for Hammarby from 1944 to 1949, returned to Hammarby to play from 1964 to 1967. In his return debut, he landed a corner kick into the goal minutes into the match; in 1984, the club erected the Nackas Hörna (Nacka&#x27;s corner) statue with his kick as the pose.

===1970s–1980s: Stable Allsvenskan years===
In the 1970 Allsvenskan season, Hammarby had acquired only 3 points in the spring portion of the season, but during the autumn, showed a dramatic improvement. With star players Kenneth Ohlsson and Ronnie Hellström, and with a crowd that tried out supporter songs for the first time, the club went through the autumn half undefeated and finished in fifth place, its best showing in Allsvenskan. The club would stay in Allsvenskan through the rest of the 1970s, attracting large crowds, despite not returning above fifth place. Also in 1978, the club changed from black/yellow to green/white colours.

In the 1982 season, Swedish football introduced a playoff system for the top 8 teams in Allsvenskan to decide a champion. The playoffs consisted of two matches in which the aggregate score would determine who would advance. The club had placed second overall that season and had not lost a home game. After defeating Örgryte in the quarter-finals, and coming back from a 1–3 deficit to beat Elfsborg 4–3 in the semi-finals, Hammarby was in the final against IFK Göteborg. Hammarby won its away match 2–1, but lost 1–3 in its home match to a sold-out crowd.

In the following year, Hammarby finished fifth in the league, but lost to AIK in the play-offs. In the Svenska Cupen tournament, Hammarby reached the finals but lost against IFK. However, since IFK qualified for the UEFA Cup that year, Hammarby qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, its first major international competition, where the club lost to Finland&#x27;s FC Haka in the second round. The Hammarby squads finished consistently in the top six in the league every year through 1987.

In 1988, Hammarby finished last in the standings and were relegated to the second tier. Although the club placed first in 1989, it finished last in 1990.

===1990s–2000s: Tough nineties, restructuring, champions===

Hammarby would stay in the second tier in 1991 and 1992, but in 1993, the team finished in first place and were promoted to Allsvenskan. In 1995 Allsvenskan, the team finished last and were relegated, but returned to the 1998 Allsvenskan with a third-place finish.
Prior to the 2001 Allsvenskan season, the club had financially tough times, leading experts to conclude that the team was weak, and one journalist predicted a last place finish. Halfway through the 2001 season, manager Sören Cratz was informed that his contract would not be extended because the club&#x27;s board wanted Hammarby to play a positive, attacking and fun football, something the board did not think that Cratz did. However, the club took the lead in the standings and in the second-to-last match, which was against Örgryte IS on 21 October, the club won 3–2 and secured its first ever Allsvenskan championship.

Hammarby stayed in Allsvenskan for the rest of the 2000s: In 2003 Allsvenskan the club finished second, and participated in the second qualifying and first rounds of the 2004–05 UEFA Cup. In 2006 Allsvenskan, Hammarby placed third overall and advanced to the UEFA Intertoto Cup, where they won their third round match, which advanced the team to the second qualifying and first rounds of the 2007–08 UEFA Cup.

In 2007, Bajen finished on the sixth place, and didn&#x27;t qualify for any European cups. In 2008, Hammarby finished ninth, but 2009 was a disastrous year where the team finished last in the league and was relegated to the second tier known as Superettan.

===2010–2014: Superettan===
The 2010 Superettan was a letdown for supporters who had hoped to make the visit to Sweden&#x27;s second tier short, as the team finished 8th. In the 2010 Svenska Cupen, Hammarby fared better, winning against multiple Allsvenskan opponents, until the finals where the team lost 0–1 to Helsingborgs IF. In the 2011 Superettan season, the club finished in a tie for 11th, its worst overall ranking in 64 years. The club was almost relegated to the third tier, until a game-winning kick in the season&#x27;s final match against Ängelholm. After the season of 2011, Hammarby dismantled their development team HTFF, which was established in 2003. In 2012 Superettan, the club finished fourth, and in 2013 Superettan the club finished fifth. In 2014, in the last round of the season, Hammarby were promoted to the first tier, Allsvenskan, by finishing first in Superettan.

===2015–: Top-flight comeback and cup title===
The 2015 season started off well, with Hammarby managing an impressive 1–2 away win against local rivals AIK in the 2015 Swedish Cup, which also was the first Stockholm derby involving Hammarby since 2009. This was followed up with a 2–0 win in the season opener against BK Häcken, and in the fourth round Hammarby defeated their other local rivals Djurgårdens IF with 2–1. The summer was, however, tougher for the club, with Hammarby playing 10 consecutive league games without winning, before managing to defeat Falkenbergs FF at home with 3–0. Eventually, Hammarby finished at 11th place in their first Allsvenskan season since 2009.

The 2016 and 2017 seasons showed only a slight improvement for Hammarby, with the team ending in the 11th and 9th position respectively. Hammarby fared better in the local derbys. In 2016 Hammarby defeated the local rival Djurgården in all three fixtures. In 2017 the first encounter ended with a draw and the second with a Hammarby victory. The second local rival, AIK, managed to defeat Hammarby by 3–0 in the first encounter in the league and a draw (0–0) in the second. Hammarby however beat AIK in the Swedish cup, earlier in the year. In 2017 the Hammarby – AIK encounters ended with one Hammarby win and one draw. Both Djurgården and AIK, however, fared much better overall than Hammarby in the league.

The club fared much better in 2018 under the reign of new manager Stefan Billborn, finishing 4th in the league. In 2019, Hammarby started the league play in a mediocre fashion, but made a strong finish to the season (with eight straight wins in the final eight games of the season) and ultimately finished 3rd in Allsvenskan. This meant that the club qualified for the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League, their first continental competition in over ten years.

Hammarby IF won the 2020–21 Svenska Cupen, their first title in the main domestic cup, through a 5–4 win on penalties (0–0 after full-time) against BK Häcken in the final. On 11 June 2021, Hammarby decided to terminate manager Stefan Billborn&#x27;s contract, with the club placed 8th in the 2021 Allsvenskan table after eight rounds. On 13 June, Miloš Milojević, most recently an assistant at Red Star Belgrade, was appointed new head coach. Under the leadership of Milojević, Hammarby nearly reached the group stages of the first edition of the UEFA Conference League, only being defeated on penalties by FC Basel in the playoff. Nevertheless, Milojević was fired following the conclusion of the 2021 Allsvenskan, and Martí Cifuentes was hired as head coach in January 2022.

Cifuentes led the club to a 3rd-place finish in the 2022 Allsvenskan. On 30 October 2023, with two fixtures left of the 2023 season, he left the club for Queens Park Rangers. Hammarby ended the season in 7th place.

==Colours, badge and kit==
===Colours and badge===
When Hammarby Roddförening (Hammarby RF) was founded in 1889, the club&#x27;s crest consisted of a white flag with three green horizontal lines. It drew inspiration from two other competing rowing clubs in Stockholm that used two blue and two red lines respectively on a white flag, but chose the colour green to represent &quot;hope&quot;. Hammarby eventually added a third stripe when it discovered that Göteborgs RF used a similar green-white flag with two stripes.

===Kit===

When Hammarby IF founded its football club in 1915, it determined the kit to be the following: a white hat with a five-pointed green star, a white shirt with &quot;HIF&quot; on its chest, white shorts and black socks. Following the merger with Johanneshovs IF in 1918, the club changed its football team apparel to Johanneshov&#x27;s black-and-yellow striped shirts, blue shorts and black socks with yellow stripes. The first department to use the new kit was Hammarby Bandy, with the football department adopting it soon thereafter.

In the 1960s, the club changed from blue shorts to black. When &quot;Nacka&quot; Skoglund rejoined the club in 1964, he donated the club a set of black shorts because he thought the team&#x27;s blue shorts looked awful.

In 1978, 60 years after the merger with Johanneshov, Hammarby changed its home colours from black and yellow to white shirts, green shorts and white socks. In 1997, the striped shirts returned, but with green and white colours, with green shorts and white socks. The yellow and black colours were retained for the away and third kits. Since 1997, only a few exceptions have been made to the green-and-white-striped home and the black-and-yellow-striped away shirts: In 2002 and 2014–2016, the team wore all-white jerseys, and in 2011 the team wore an all-grey away kit.

===Sponsors===
Craft is Hammarby&#x27;s kit manufacturer. Also visible on the club&#x27;s kit are the logos of the following sponsors: workwear clothing company Projob; automaker Volkswagen; sporting-goods retailer Intersport; solar cell supplier Sesol; Köket &amp; Gården, a vegetable-and-fruit delivery company; BST, a transportation company; pawnbroker Digipant; Clinton, a construction-measurement company; and league sponsors Unibet, a gambling company (whose logo is on the right sleeve of the shirts of all Allsvenskan teams).

==Ownership and finance==
===Ownership===
Hammarby IF was reorganised as an umbrella organisation in 1999, with each of the individual sports departments breaking off to form independent clubs; the football club was then named Hammarby IF Fotbollförening (Hammarby IF FF).

In 2001, the football club split the A team, B team and youth team into separate legal entities. A limited company called Hammarby Fotboll AB was founded, in which the parent football club owns a majority stake. In Sweden, all sport teams in the league systems are regulated to be non-profit associations, which means that a majority of the voting rights, according to the &quot;51 percent-rule&quot;, is controlled by the members of the club.

Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), the founder and owner of Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy, was the biggest external investor and minority shareholder of Hammarby Fotboll AB between 2001 and 2019.

On 27 November 2019, it was announced that Zlatan Ibrahimović, widely regarded to be the greatest Swedish football player of all time, had acquired 23.5 percent of the outstanding shares in Hammarby, which meant that AEG reduced their stake by half.

===Finance===
At the end of 2022, the club held an equity of 115,6 million SEK. The turnover for 2022 was 316,3 million SEK.

The highest transfer fee received by Hammarby for a player was reportedly 50 million SEK for Williot Swedberg who was sold to RC Celta de Vigo in 2022, followed by 46 million SEK for Akinkunmi Amoo who left for F.C. Copenhagen in 2022, 44 million SEK for Odilon Kossounou who transferred to Club Brugge in 2019, and 30 million SEK for Aziz Ouattara Mohammed who was signed by Genk in 2022.

==Supporters==

The club&#x27;s nickname is &quot;Bajen&quot; (). A fan of Hammarby is referred to as a &quot;bajare&quot; or a &quot;hammarbyare&quot;.

Hammarby has historically been regarded as a club with a mainly working-class fan base, due to its connection with the formerly working-class (but today gentrified) Södermalm district of Stockholm. Nowadays the club attracts fans from all parts of society. According to a 2016 poll, a large part of the club&#x27;s fan base tends to support left-wing politics compared to those of their local rivals AIK and Djurgården.

Hammarby has strong ties to Söderort, the southern part of Stockholm urban area. A 2012 poll showed that Hammarby was the most popular club in Söderort; 40 percent of the area&#x27;s residents who had a favourite club chose Hammarby.

Hammarby&#x27;s training ground, Årsta Idrottsplats, is located in the district of Johanneshov, while some of the older youth teams still play at Hammarby IP in Södermalm.

===Rivalries===
The club&#x27;s main rivals are Djurgårdens IF and AIK, also from the Stockholm urban area. Hammarby and Djurgården have been tenants at the same arena, Tele2 Arena, since 2013.

===Attendances===
Since 2014, Hammarby has had the highest average attendance in Scandinavia, except for in 2020 and 2021 when matches were partly played behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The club&#x27;s average attendance for the 2015 season was 25,507, a new record high for Swedish top-division football. The former record was set back in 1959, when Örgryte IS had an average home attendance of 25,490. In 2022, Hammarby broke a new Allsvenskan record, drawing an average attendance of 26,372.

===Notable supporters===

Hammarby has had a slew of celebrity fans throughout the years, mostly cultural professionals living in Södermalm. In 1942, the popular recording artist Alice Babs released a version of the song &quot;Vårat gäng&quot; (&quot;Our Gang&quot;) with new, Hammarby-related lyrics. Critically acclaimed author Per Anders Fogelström, who rose to fame with his 1960 novel &quot;Mina drömmars stad&quot; (&quot;City of My Dreams&quot;), with a narrative that follows a group of working-class people in Södermalm between 1860 and 1880, was also a supporter of Hammarby. In 1962, writer and illustrator Stig &quot;Slas&quot; Claesson penned a short story, &quot;Supportern&quot; (&quot;The Supporter&quot;), about his love for the club.

Hollywood actors Alexander Skarsgård and Joel Kinnaman are supporters of Hammarby, and have acted in several skits to promote the club.

===Club culture===

The club&#x27;s unofficial hymn is &quot;Just idag är jag stark&quot;. Released in 1979, it was performed and co-written by Kenta Gustafsson, who was a notable Hammarby fan. The recording has been the team&#x27;s entrance music since 2004.

Hammarby has several supporter clubs, the largest of which, Bajen Fans, had over 6,000 members in 2012 and is one of the largest in Scandinavia. Hammarby also has a number of ultras such as Hammarby Ultras, Ultra Boys, Söder Bröder, and E1 Ultras – who together organize the club&#x27;s terrace choreography. Hammarby Ultras won &quot;tifo of the year&quot; in both 2000 and 2005, an award handed out by the Swedish Football Association.

The club is known for its vociferous fans. Drawing inspiration from England, Hammarby fans introduced football chants to the Swedish terraces in 1970. In the 1982 finals against IFK Göteborg, Hammarby supporters attracted much attention for bringing a live samba band to the stands to accompany their chants, inspired by supporters in South America. In 2008, sports broadcaster Setanta Sports listed Söderstadion, Hammarby&#x27;s home ground at the time, as the 11th noisiest stadium in the world.

Before the first league home game of the season, Hammarby fans gather at Medborgarplatsen in Södermalm. They then march together along Götgatan and cross the Skanstullsbron bridge before arriving at the stadium in Johanneshov. This tradition has taken place since 1998 and annually attracts between 15,000 and 20,000 supporters.

<text>Hincmar (; ; ; 806 – 21 December 882), archbishop of Reims, was a Frankish jurist and theologian, as well as the friend, advisor and propagandist of Charles the Bald. He belonged to a noble family of northern Francia.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hincmar was born in 806 to a distinguished family of the West Franks. Destined to the monastic life, he was brought up at Saint-Denis under the direction of the abbot Hilduin (died 844), who, when appointed court chaplain in 822, brought him to the court of the emperor Louis the Pious. There he became acquainted with the political as well as the ecclesiastical administration of the empire. When Hilduin was disgraced in 830 for having joined the party of Lothair I, Hincmar accompanied him into exile at Corvey in Saxony. Hincmar used his influence with the emperor on behalf of the banished abbot, and not without success: for he stood in high favour with Louis the Pious, having always been a faithful and loyal adherent. He returned with Hilduin to Saint-Denis when the abbot was reconciled with the emperor and remained faithful to the Louis during his struggle with his sons.

===840–877: reign of Charles the Bald===
After the death of Louis the Pious (840) Hincmar supported Charles the Bald (see Capitularies of Charles the Bald), and received from him the abbacies of Nôtre-Dame at Compiègne and Saint-Germer-de-Fly.

====Archbishop of Reims (845)====
Archbishop Ebbo had been deposed in 835 at the synod of Thionville (Diedenhofen) for having broken his oath of fidelity to the emperor Louis, whom he had deserted to join the party of Lothair. After the death of Louis, Ebbo succeeded in regaining possession of his see for some years (840-844), but in 844 Pope Sergius II confirmed his deposition. In 845 Hincmar obtained through the king&#x27;s support the archbishopric of Reims, and this choice was confirmed at the Synod of Beauvais (April 845). He was consecrated archbishop on 3 May 845; in 847 Pope Leo IV sent him the pallium.

One of the first cares of the new prelate was the restitution to his metropolitan see of the domains that had been alienated under Ebbo and given as benefices to laymen. From the beginning of his episcopate Hincmar was in constant conflict with the clerks who had been ordained by Ebbo during his reappearance. These clerks, whose ordination was regarded as invalid by Hincmar and his adherents, were condemned in 853 at the Council of Soissons, and the decisions of that council were confirmed in 855 by Pope Benedict III.

This conflict, however, bred an antagonism of which Hincmar was later to feel the effects. During the next thirty years the archbishop of Reims played a very prominent part in church and state. His authoritative and energetic will inspired, and in great measure directed, the policy of the West Frankish kingdom until his death.

As a participant in government and court ceremony and an aggressive advocate of ecclesiastical privilege, Hincmar took an active part in all the great political and religious affairs of his time, and was especially energetic in defending and extending the rights of the church and of the metropolitans in general, and of his own metropolitan of the church of Reims in particular. In the resulting conflicts, in which his personal interest was in question, he displayed great activity and a wide knowledge of canon law, but was not so scrupulous that he would not resort to disingenuous interpretation of texts.

====Gottschalk and predestinarianism====
His first encounter was with Gottschalk, whose predestinarian doctrines claimed to be modelled on those of St Augustine. Hincmar placed himself at the head of the party that regarded Gottschalk&#x27;s doctrines as heretical, and succeeded in procuring the arrest and imprisonment of his adversary (849). For a part at least of his doctrines Gottschalk found ardent defenders, such as Lupus of Ferrières, Prudentius of Troyes, the deacon Florus, and Amolo of Lyons. Through the energy and activity of Hincmar the theories of Gottschalk were condemned at the second council of Quierzy (853) and Valence (855), and the decisions of these two synods were confirmed at the synods of Langres and Savonnières, near Toul (859).

To refute the predestinarian heresy, Hincmar composed his &quot;De praedestinatione Dei et libero arbitrio&quot;, and against certain propositions advanced by Gottschalk on the Trinity he wrote a treatise called &quot;De una et non trina deitate&quot;. Gottschalk died in prison in 868.

====Lothar II of Lorraine====
The question of the divorce of Lothair II, king of Lorraine (r. 855–869), who had repudiated his wife Theutberga to marry his concubine Waldrada, engaged Hincmar&#x27;s literary activities in another direction. At the request of a number of great personages in Lorraine he composed in 860 his &quot;De divortio Lotharii regis et Theutbergae reginae&quot;, in which he vigorously attacked, both from the moral and the legal standpoints, the condemnation pronounced against the queen by the Synod of Aix-la-Chapelle (February 860).

Hincmar energetically supported the policy of Charles the Bald in Lorraine, less perhaps from devotion to the king&#x27;s interests than from a desire to see the whole of the ecclesiastical province of Reims united under the authority of a single, sympathetic sovereign, and in 869 it was he who consecrated Charles at Metz as king of Lorraine.

====Episcopal conflicts====
In the middle of the ninth century there appeared in Gaul the collection of &#x27;false decretals&#x27; commonly known as the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals. The exact date and the circumstances of the composition of the collection are still an open question, but it is certain that Hincmar was one of the first to know of their existence, and apparently he was not aware that the documents were forged. The importance assigned by these decretals to the bishops and the provincial councils, as well as to the direct intervention of the Holy See, tended to curtail the rights of the metropolitans.

Rothad, bishop of Soissons, one of the most active members of the party in favour of the pseudo-Isidorian theories, immediately came into collision with his archbishop. Deposed in 863 at the council of Soissons that was presided over by Hincmar, Rothad appealed to Rome. Pope Nicholas I, supported him zealously, and in 865, in spite of the protests of the archbishop of Reims, Arsenius, bishop of Orte and legate of the Holy See, was instructed to restore Rothad to his episcopal see.

Hincmar experienced another check when he endeavoured to prevent Wulfad, one of the deposed clerics ordained by Ebbo, from obtaining the archbishopric of Bourges with the support of Charles the Bald. After a synod held at Soissons, Pope Nicholas I pronounced himself in favour of the deposed clerics, and Hincmar was constrained to submit (866).

He was more successful in his contest with his nephew Hincmar, bishop of Laon, who was at first supported both by the king and by his uncle, the archbishop of Reims, but soon quarrelled with both. Hincmar of Laon refused to recognize the authority of his metropolitan, and entered into an open struggle with his uncle, who exposed his errors in a treatise called &quot;Opusculum LV capitulorum&quot;, and procured his condemnation and deposition at the Synod of Douzy (871). The bishop of Laon was sent into exile, probably to Aquitaine, where his eyes were put out by order of Count Boso. Pope Adrian protested against his deposition, but it was confirmed in 876 by Pope John VIII, and it was not until 878, at the council of Troyes, that the unfortunate prelate was reconciled with the Church.

A serious conflict arose between archbishop Hincmar on the one side and Charles and the pope on the other in 876, when Pope John VIII, at the king&#x27;s request, entrusted Ansegisus, archbishop of Sens, with the primacy of the Gauls and of Germany, and created him vicar apostolic. In Hincmar&#x27;s eyes this was an encroachment on the jurisdiction of the archbishops, and it was against this primacy that he directed his treatise &quot;De iure metropolitanorum&quot;. At the same time he wrote a life of St Remigius, in which he endeavoured by audacious falsifications to prove the supremacy of the church of Reims over the other churches. Charles the Bald, however, upheld the rights of Ansegisus at the synod of Ponthion.

===877–882: reigns of Louis the Stammerer, Louis III and Carloman===

Although Hincmar had been very hostile to Charles&#x27; expedition into Italy, he figured among his testamentary executors and helped to secure the submission of the nobles to Louis the Stammerer, whom he crowned at Compiègne (December 8, 877). During the reign of Louis, Hincmar played an obscure part. He supported the accession of Louis III and Carloman, but had a dispute with Louis, who wished to install a candidate in the episcopal see of Beauvais without the archbishop&#x27;s assent.

To Carloman, on his accession in 882, Hincmar addressed his &quot;De ordine palatii&quot;, partly based on a treatise (now lost) by Adalard, abbot of Corbie (c. 814), in which he set forth his system of government and his opinion of the duties of a sovereign, a subject he had already touched in his &quot;De regis persona et regio ministerio&quot;, dedicated to Charles the Bald at an unknown date, and in his &quot;Instructio ad Ludovicum regem&quot;, addressed to Louis the Stammerer on his accession in 877. In the autumn of 882 an irruption of the Normans forced the old archbishop to take refuge at Épernay, where he died on 21 December 882.

==Works==
Hincmar was a prolific writer. Besides the works already mentioned, he was the author of several theological tracts; of the &quot;De villa Noviliaco&quot;, concerning the claiming of a domain of his church; and he continued from 861 the &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot;, of which the first part was written by Prudentius, bishop of Troyes, the best source for the history of Charles the Bald. He also wrote a great number of letters, some of which are extant, and others embodied in the chronicles of Flodoard.

Hincmar&#x27;s works, which are the principal source for the history of his life, were collected by Jacques Sirmond (Paris, 1645), and reprinted by Migne, &quot;Patrol. Latina&quot;, vol. cxxv and cxxvi. See also Carl von Noorden, &quot;Hinkmar, Erzbischof von Reims&quot; (Bonn, 1863), and, especially, Heinrich Schrörs&#x27;, &quot;Hinkmar, Erzbischof von Reims&quot; (Freiburg im Breisgau, 1884). For Hincmar&#x27;s political and ecclesiastical theories see preface to Maurice Prou&#x27;s edition of the &quot;De ordine palatii&quot; (Paris, 1885), and the abbé Émile Lesne, &quot;La hiérarchie épiscopale en Gaule et en Germanie&quot; (Paris, 1905).

Hincmar may be the author of the anonymous &quot;Gesta Dagoberti&quot;, a biography of Dagobert I written in the early 830s.

In one of his letters Hincmar recommended that a copy of Gregory the Great&#x27;s work called Pastoral Care should be given together with the Book of Canons into the hands of bishops before the altar at their consecration (Schaff).

<text>Parliament is an American brand of cigarettes, currently owned and manufactured by Philip Morris USA in the United States and Philip Morris International outside of the United States.

==History==
The brand was launched in 1931 and is distinctive for its recessed paper filters. It was originally used as an advertising gimmick when cigarettes did not have filters. The first commercial cigarette filters came into use in 1935.

Until the late 1950s, Parliament was packaged in a two-layer &quot;hard&quot; pack. That packaging continued under the Benson &amp; Hedges brand after Parliament adopted a conventional paper pack.

Parliament is one of few brands of cigarettes on the mainstream market to feature a recessed paper filter. Cigarette filters became common in most cigarettes in the 1950s. In the 1940s and 1950s, the brand was marketed for its unique filters, with advertisements reading, &quot;Only the flavor touches your lips&quot;, and &quot;Tobacco tastes best when the filter&#x27;s recessed&quot;. The brand also claimed that the recessed filter prevented tar from making contact with the smoker&#x27;s mouth, unlike standard filters.

In Korea, brands like Marlboro, Philip Morris, Dunhill, Parliament, and various other Western cigarettes were sold in 1987 as imports opening to prepare for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.

Parliament makes up 1.9% of U.S. cigarette sales, in contrast to Marlboro, which represents 41.1% of U.S. cigarette sales. From the 1950s on, the cigarette had a reputation for being popular among affluent smokers.

It is the 12th best-selling international brand and the 4th largest PMI brand. In 2016, the volume of produced Parliament cigarettes was 46 billion. The brand is sold in more than 30 countries.

==Advertising==
In the television commercials that were once broadcast in Japan, the image of New York was strongly issued. From the early to the mid-1980s, things like CG animation, which had been the package designs of Parliament, ranged from the cityscape of New York to roads and bridges, etc. From around the end of the 1980s, the aerial photographs of New York by live action turned into things to be used. Since entering the 1990s, under the image strategy of being even more expensive, BGM was shedding the number of AOR artists such as Bobby Caldwell with beautiful images. Among them were included a self-cover version by Bobby of &quot;Stay With Me&quot; for KA, GU, YA (the theme song of the movie Bamboo Story) that was offered to Peter Cetera. Kyōzō Nagatsuka was in charge of the narration at that time.

Actor Charlie Sheen appeared in ads for Parliament in Japan in the 1990s.

<doc id="896174" wikidata="Q2656522" url="?curid=896174" title="Incompressible surface">
<text>In mathematics, an incompressible surface is a surface properly embedded in a 3-manifold, which, in intuitive terms, is a &quot;nontrivial&quot; surface that cannot be simplified. In non-mathematical terms, the surface of a suitcase is compressible, because we could cut the handle and shrink it into the surface. But a Conway sphere (a sphere with four holes) is incompressible, because there are essential parts of a knot or link both inside and out, so there is no way to move the entire knot or link to one side of the punctured sphere. The mathematical definition is as follows. There are two cases to consider. A sphere is incompressible if both inside and outside the sphere there are some obstructions that prevent the sphere from shrinking to a point and also prevent the sphere from expanding to encompass all of space. A surface other than a sphere is incompressible if any disk with its boundary on the surface spans a disk in the surface.

Incompressible surfaces are used for decomposition of Haken manifolds, in normal surface theory, and in the study of the fundamental groups of 3-manifolds.

== Formal definition ==

Let be a compact surface properly embedded in a smooth or PL 3-manifold . A compressing disk is a disk embedded in such that

:formula_1

and the intersection is transverse. If the curve does not bound a disk inside of , then is called a nontrivial compressing disk. If has a nontrivial compressing disk, then we call a compressible surface in .

If is neither the 2-sphere nor a compressible surface, then we call the surface (geometrically) incompressible.

Note that 2-spheres are excluded since they have no nontrivial compressing disks by the Jordan-Schoenflies theorem, and 3-manifolds have abundant embedded 2-spheres. Sometimes one alters the definition so that an incompressible sphere is a 2-sphere embedded in a 3-manifold that does not bound an embedded 3-ball. Such spheres arise exactly when a 3-manifold is not irreducible. Since this notion of incompressibility for a sphere is quite different from the above definition for surfaces, often an incompressible sphere is instead referred to as an essential sphere or a reducing sphere.

== Compression ==

Given a compressible surface with a compressing disk that we may assume lies in the interior of and intersects transversely, one may perform embedded 1-surgery on to get a surface that is obtained by compressing along . There is a tubular neighborhood of whose closure is an embedding of &quot;D&quot; × [-1,1] with &quot;D&quot; × 0 being identified with &quot;D&quot; and with
:formula_2
Then
:formula_3
is a new properly embedded surface obtained by compressing along .

A non-negative complexity measure on compact surfaces without 2-sphere components is , where is the zeroth Betti number (the number of connected components) and is the Euler characteristic of . When compressing a compressible surface along a nontrivial compressing disk, the Euler characteristic increases by two, while might remain the same or increase by 1. Thus, every properly embedded compact surface without 2-sphere components is related to an incompressible surface through a sequence of compressions.

Sometimes we drop the condition that be compressible. If were to bound a disk inside (which is always the case if is incompressible, for example), then compressing along would result in a disjoint union of a sphere and a surface homeomorphic to . The resulting surface with the sphere deleted might or might not be isotopic to , and it will be if is incompressible and is irreducible.

== Algebraically incompressible surfaces ==

There is also an algebraic version of incompressibility. Suppose formula_4 is a proper embedding of a compact surface in a 3-manifold. Then is -injective (or algebraically incompressible) if the induced map
:formula_5 
on fundamental groups is injective.

In general, every -injective surface is incompressible, but the reverse implication is not always true. For instance, the Lens space contains an incompressible Klein bottle that is not -injective.

However, if is two-sided, the loop theorem implies Kneser&#x27;s lemma, that if is incompressible, then it is -injective.

==Seifert surfaces==

A Seifert surface for an oriented link is an oriented surface whose boundary is with the same induced orientation. If is not -injective in , where is a tubular neighborhood of &quot;L&quot;, then the loop theorem gives a compressing disk that one may use to compress along, providing another Seifert surface of reduced complexity. Hence, there are incompressible Seifert surfaces.

Every Seifert surface of a link is related to one another through compressions in the sense that the equivalence relation generated by compression has one equivalence class. The inverse of a compression is sometimes called embedded arc surgery (an embedded 0-surgery).

The genus of a link is the minimal genus of all Seifert surfaces of a link. A Seifert surface of minimal genus is incompressible. However, it is not in general the case that an incompressible Seifert surface is of minimal genus, so alone cannot certify the genus of a link. David Gabai proved in particular that a genus-minimizing Seifert surface is a leaf of some taut, transversely oriented foliation of the knot complement, which can be certified with a taut sutured manifold hierarchy.

Given an incompressible Seifert surface &#x27; for a knot , then the fundamental group of splits as an HNN extension over , which is a free group. The two maps from into given by pushing loops off the surface to the positive or negative side of are both injections.

<doc id="896182" wikidata="Q910887" url="?curid=896182" title="Magic (1978 film)">
<text>Magic is a 1978 American psychological horror drama film directed by Richard Attenborough and starring Anthony Hopkins, Ann-Margret and Burgess Meredith. The screenplay is by William Goldman, who adapted his novel of the same title. The score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith.

== Plot ==
After Charles &quot;Corky&quot; Withers fails in his first attempt at professional magic, his mentor Merlin says that he needs a better gimmick. Corky comes back as a combination magician and ventriloquist with a foul-mouthed dummy named Fats, becoming a huge success. Corky&#x27;s agent, Ben Greene, is on the verge of signing him for his own television show, but Corky bails for the Catskills, where he grew up, since he does not want to take the TV network&#x27;s medical examination because the doctors might find out that he suffers from severe mental issues and cannot control Fats (a manifestation of Corky&#x27;s id).

In the Catskills, Corky reunites with his high-school crush, Peggy Ann Snow, who is stuck in a passionless marriage with Duke, Corky&#x27;s friend from high school. A magic trick with a deck of cards charms Peggy into thinking they are soulmates, and the pair make love. This sparks jealousy in both Duke and Fats.

In the midst of an argument &quot;between&quot; Corky and Fats, Greene confronts Corky, discovering the truth about his state of mind. Greene leaves to contact doctors, but Fats convinces Corky to kill him. Corky bludgeons Greene with Fats&#x27; wooden head and then drowns him.

The next morning, Corky says that he plans to elope with Peggy and leave the dummy behind. Suspecting his wife has cheated on him, Duke talks with Corky by the lake and confides that he loves Peggy and is worried about losing her. Duke suddenly spots the unconscious body of a man on the edge of the lake and goes to check him for an ID. Believing he could still be alive, Corky is sent to get help while Duke administers the &quot;kiss of life&quot;.

Curious, Duke searches Corky&#x27;s cabin. He discovers that the drowned man was Corky&#x27;s agent, Greene, and is stabbed to death by Fats with &quot;help&quot; from Corky.

Corky composes himself and persuades Peggy to run away with him, but she insists on waiting to tell Duke. Fats then &quot;comes alive&quot; and reveals that Corky&#x27;s card trick is a ruse he uses to seduce women. Peggy sees it as Corky humiliating her and rejects him, locking herself in her bedroom. Fats orders Corky to kill Peggy.

Corky, using Fats&#x27; voice, apologizes to Peggy through her locked door and leaves her a wooden heart that he carved. A short while later, he returns with a bloodstained knife. Fats seems pleased until he learns that Corky fatally stabbed himself to prevent further murders by Fats. Corky and Fats each feel faint, wondering which of them will die first. Moments later, Peggy returns to the cabin, happily calling out that she has changed her mind and decided to run away with Corky. As she speaks, she playfully changes her voice to impersonate Fats, tossing the wooden heart in the air.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
In March 1976, Joseph E. Levine had purchased the film rights to Goldman&#x27;s novel for $1 million, with Goldman hired to write the screenplay. By June 1976, Norman Jewison had been hired to direct the film. Jewison wanted Jack Nicholson to star, but Nicholson turned it down, claiming he did not want to wear a hairpiece. Steven Spielberg expressed interest in directing the film and considered casting Robert De Niro for Corky. Richard Attenborough, who had directed &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; with Goldman and Levine, then agreed to direct.

Laurence Olivier was offered the role of the agent but was unable to do it, and then Burgess Meredith was cast. Meredith landed the role after walking into the 21 Club one night when Levine was there – Levine cast him on the spot. Meredith modelled his performance on the agent Swifty Lazar, even shaving his head to look like Lazar. &quot;I tried to get his cool, understated manner, his sharp clothes, and most of all, his way of speaking softly so that you&#x27;ve got to lean over to hear what he&#x27;s saying&quot;, said Meredith. Goldman later wrote about the film that &quot;Burgess Meredith was perfect and Tony Hopkins...was so wonderful here. But running stride for stride with him was Miss Olsson. I think Ann-Margret is the least appreciated emotional actress anywhere.&quot;

Ann-Margret and Anthony Hopkins were each paid around $300,000 for their performances.

=== Filming ===
Exteriors were shot in Ukiah, California. Most of the exterior shots were shot at Le Trianon resort on the Blue Lake in Upper Lake, California.

== Music ==
The score was composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith. The complete soundtrack was released on CD through Varèse Sarabande in April 2003 and features 22 tracks score at a running time of 42 minutes. It was subsequently reissued by La-La Land Records.

== Home media==
Because Disney via 20th Century Studios never owned complete rights to this film, other companies (especially Embassy and, currently MGM) have been able to release home video versions of &quot;Magic&quot; under different licenses. However, legal complications kept the film from being formally reissued on VHS and DVD in the last decade due in part to Embassy Pictures&#x27; corporate holdings being split among different entities. Recently, the rights were acquired by the American Movie Classics division of AMC Film Holdings, LLC, and the TV rights are handled for syndication by Trifecta Entertainment &amp; Media (under Paramount Television Studios). An unedited version is available on widescreen DVD and Blu-ray.

== Reception ==
Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film a complete four-star review, explaining it was because &quot;[the film] scared me, because I admired Hopkins&#x27; performance as much as any in this year, and because it would have been so easy for a film such as this to fail.&quot; He later ranked it at number 9 on his list of the 10 best films of 1978. On the syndicated film review program &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;, Roger Ebert admired Hopkins&#x27; and Burgess Meredith&#x27;s performances, and Attenborough&#x27;s direction but expressed disappointment at the final act, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t think the screenplay does justice to the talent of the people who get into the picture.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Magic&quot; is neither eerie nor effective. It is, however, very heavy of hand.&quot; He praised Hopkins&#x27; performance, but criticized the screenplay for spending &quot;too much time on irrelevant details, including flashbacks and jumps forward that neither inform nor amuse but simply look trendy in the dated fashion of that word.&quot; Similarly, Dale Pollock of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;The dilemma of &#x27;Magic&#x27; is that the results never live up to the standards established in the film&#x27;s opening half-hour. Through flashbacks and claustrophobic editing by John Booth, the relationship between Hopkins and his eerily-realistic dummy, Fats, is well-documented. So is the introduction of Burgess Meredith, well cast as a Swifty Lazar-type of superagent ...It&#x27;s this stereotyped plotting and conclusion that robs &#x27;Magic&#x27; of its initial, special quality&quot;. Judith Martin, reviewing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, ended her review, writing &quot;the thrills of a conventional horror story have been blown up so pretentiously that they&#x27;re no more scary than balloon monsters.&quot;

However, &quot;The Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review&quot; 1990 writeup of the film remarks that Hopkins appears stiff in the lead role, but praised the supporting cast: &quot;Ann-Margret...invests her role with a considerable sparkle. Particularly good is the great and underrated Burgess Meredith whose sharp and alert Hollywood agent is a real plum of a performance. Jerry Goldsmith also adds a fine nervy carnivalesque score.&quot; The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that of critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Thanks in large part to Anthony Hopkins&#x27; layered performance, &quot;Magic&quot; is an unusual albeit creepily effective experience&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100 based on 10 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

== Awards and nominations ==
Goldman received a 1979 Edgar Award, from the Mystery Writers of America, for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Hopkins received both Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for his role as the tragically disturbed Corky. Meredith received the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor.

<text>Bnei Sakhnin F.C. (, , ) is an Israeli professional football club based at the Doha Stadium in Sakhnin. They are the most successful club among the Arab-Israeli clubs in the country, having won the State Cup in 2004.

==History==
===Early years===
Bnei Sakhnin was formed in 1991 by a merger of Maccabi Sakhnin and Hapoel Sakhnin. They were promoted to Liga Artzit (then the second tier) in 1997. In 1998–99 they finished in the relegation zone, but were reprieved when Maccabi Jaffa, who had finished bottom of the top division, were relegated three leagues due to financial problems.

In 2002–03 the club finished as runners-up and promoted alongside fellow Israeli-Arab club Maccabi Ahi Nazareth, becoming the joint-second Israeli-Arab club to play in the top flight after Hapoel Tayibe. Promotion was only won on the last day of the season, the club overtaking Hapoel Jerusalem when they won 1–0 away to Maccabi Kiryat Gat, whilst Hapoel were held to a 0–0 draw at Hapoel Ra&#x27;anana.

Prior to their first season in the top division, Sakhnin were favourites to be relegated, and it was thought that Nazareth had a better chance of survival. Questions remained as to whether the squad that gained promotion would be able to compete at the top level, along with the added pressures not to become the next Hapoel Taibe (who were relegated in their first season in the top flight, and subsequently suffered financial problems leading to repeated relegations thereafter). They also lost manager Momy Zafran who resigned shortly after the club won promotion, replacing him with Eyal Lahman. In addition, the club had to play games in Haifa&#x27;s Kiryat Eliezer Stadium, as their home ground in Sakhnin was deemed unfit for the Premier League.

===Later successes===

The club signed former Maccabi Haifa striker Raffi Cohen and loaned another striker, Lior Asulin from Maccabi Herzliya. Sagi Strauss was brought in to mind the nets from Maccabi Petah Tikva. Despite the gloomy predictions, the club defied the odds, eventually finishing 10th, four points clear of relegation, whilst Nazareth finished bottom. However, the highlight of the season was the State Cup victory, also a first by an Israeli-Arab club. In the final, Sakhnin beat surprise finalists, second division side Hapoel Haifa 4–1. The team gained a reputation for being a tough, combative outfit, similar in style to the Crazy Gang period at English club Wimbledon. Captain and club stalwart Abbas Suan (he had been at the club since its formation, having been part of the Hapoel Sakhnin team since 1994) won particular acclaim, gaining a call-up to the Israel squad, and winning his first cap in February 2004.

The cup win meant that the club became the first Arab team to play in Europe, entering the UEFA Cup. After beating Partizani Tirana 6–1 on aggregate in the second qualifying round, the club faced Newcastle United in the first round. However, Sakhnin were beaten 7–1 on aggregate, including a 5–1 home defeat in a match played at the Ramat Gan Stadium in Tel Aviv District due to security concerns.

During the 2004–05 season, with its stadium still under development the club played many of its home matches at Hapoel Nazareth Illit&#x27;s Municipal Stadium.
During their spell in the top flight, several Sakhnin games were plagued by hooliganism. Palestinians were viewed as inferior during the time, and faced hardships both inside and outside of the soccer stadium. At the annual Land Day ceremony in Sakhnin in the year of 2000, a large crowd of Palestinians were unexplainably tear gassed. Political power controlled not only the population, but the atmosphere at soccer games as well. Studies have shown that Arab males who attended soccer games were less likely to be proud of their Palestinian descent. In 2000, Sakhnin&#x27;s first game was delayed for weeks, though when the game did come about, the visiting Jewish team received flowers. Though events (such as this) coated by such turmoil aggravated those who resided in Sakhnin, their people still attempted to use the soccer stadium as an outlet to ease the relations with those who brought political unrest and corruption.

Despite chairman Ghnaim&#x27;s stated mission to create a &quot;cultural rainbow&quot; from his football club, games against Beitar Jerusalem were particularly violent, at least partially due to the presence of notoriously anti-Arab supporters of Beitar; when Sakhnin won the State Cup, Beitar fans paid for an obituary to be printed in Israel&#x27;s leading daily Yediot Aharonot, claiming that Israeli football was dead. On 29 January 2005 Sakhnin fans rioted during a home match (played at Kiryat Eliezer) against Hapoel Tel Aviv after a violent incident on the field between a team official and a referee, who had earlier had sent off two Sakhnin players. As a punishment, the IFA ordered the club to play two games behind closed doors.

Despite a large cash injection made by Israeli businessman Arcadi Gaydamak ($400,000) in the hope of promoting peace and harmony among the citizens of Israel, and a return to their rebuilt home stadium (largely financed by the Emir of Qatar, hence the renaming to Doha Stadium), Sakhnin were relegated at the end of 2005–06 season, finishing nine points from safety.

However, with one of the largest budgets in the division (around five and a half million shekels), the club were amongst the favourites to return quickly to the Premier League, and did so by finishing as runners-up to Kiryat Shmona. In their first season back in the Premier League, they finished fourth, their highest ever league position, qualifying for the Intertoto Cup.
Problems due to political unrest in the region caused the club&#x27;s leadership to ask for the postponement of Intertoto cup matches in the Summer of 2008, Most of the stars of the team were sold, most notably Maor Buzaglo who signed for Maccabi Tel Aviv.

In the 2018–19 season the club ended dead last. After repromotion one year later the club&#x27;s 2020–21 season started off painfully, with the first match ending in a 3–0 home loss to Bnei Yehuda. The next week, some of the team&#x27;s players and management team had to quarantine as a result of COVID-19 pandemic precautions, and they played their away match against Maccabi Netanya with several absent players and no coach. After suffering a 7–0 loss, the greatest defeat in the club&#x27;s history, the Sakhnin chairman left the administrative division of Ligat Ha&#x27;al. Despite a horrible start with just one point after the first six matches and closing the season with four more losses the club could avoid relegation by being one point better than Bnei Yehuda.

==In popular culture==

The rise of the Bnei Sakhnin F.C. was the subject of a popular documentary film by noted Israeli director Ram Loevy.

The team is also the subject of the critically acclaimed 2010 documentary film &quot;After The Cup: Sons of Sakhnin United&quot; directed by American Christopher Browne, which follows the team after they win the Israel State Cup.

Bnei Sakhnin is also mentioned in the popular Israeli rap song ״רעל עכברים״ (rat poison) by popular Israeli rapper mc fitusi where he says ״הסיכוי שהם ידעו מה בשקיות נמוך כמו בני סכנין בליגת האלופות״ (the chance they’ll realise what’s in the bags is as low as Bnei Sakhnin in the premier league) this reference was met with some backlash and fans noted that it was racist towards Arabs, he later apologised and changed the line.

==Sponsorship==
During the 2005–06 season, the club signed a shirt sponsorship deal with Israeli mobile phone company Cellcom. 

The club&#x27;s budget was bolstered on 15 June 2006 when Gaydamak announced that he would donate two million shekels to the club in hope that they will make a return to Israel&#x27;s top league.

==Support==
The majority of fans of Bnei Sakhnin are Israeli Arabs. The Bnei Sakhnin fan club is called Ultras Sakhnin 2003 (US03) or Duha Gate 4–5 (named due to the gate numbers that leads to their stand), it was established in 2003 after they got promoted to the top division. Other fan clubs that they have friendship with is Ultras Hapoel 99 fans of Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C., Ultrà Sankt Pauli 2002 of FC St. Pauli and Ultras Winners 2005 of Wydad Casablanca.

Big matches (especially those against rival club Beitar Jerusalem) can attract large crowds but toward the end of the 2005–06 season when the club was set to be relegated, the attendance at matches declined dramatically. The highest attendance ever to be in a match of Sakhnin was at the 2004 Israel State Cup Final when Ramat Gan Stadium was filled with Arab supporters from Galilee to the far Negev which all of them came to support the club.

On 1 September 2024, violent clashes broke out during a match between Bnei Sakhnin and Hapoel Beersheba after Arab-Israeli fans of Bnei Sakhnin turned their backs during the national anthem &quot;Hatikvah&quot;. Twelve people were arrested, and the match was cancelled. When the two teams matched up in the previous season, Bnei Sakhnin fans also whistled and booed during the national anthem.

<text>Golan Cipel (; born 1968) is an Israeli consultant most known for his role in a scandal surrounding American former politician Jim McGreevey.

==Biography==
Cipel was born in Tel Aviv in 1968 and grew up in the city of Rishon LeZion. 

Cipel served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for five years as a naval officer, eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant. Following his service in the Israeli Navy, Cipel held several positions in government. He began his career in 1992 as parliamentary aide in the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, where he was responsible for policy formation, as well as the drafting of legislation. In 1994, he joined the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs as chief information officer at the Consulate General of Israel in New York, where he was responsible for presenting the Israeli government perspective to the American media and public. In 1999, Cipel was appointed the spokesperson for the municipality of Rishon LeZion, Israel.

Cipel holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree and a master&#x27;s degree in communications arts from the New York Institute of Technology.

===Jim McGreevey===
Cipel met American politician Jim McGreevey in Israel in 2000. Cipel relocated to the United States to work for McGreevey&#x27;s 2001 campaign for governor of New Jersey as a liaison to the Jewish community.

In 2002, following his election as governor of New Jersey, McGreevey appointed Cipel as homeland security adviser at a salary of $110,000. Members of the New Jersey Legislature questioned the appointment, and the appointment was criticized because Cipel appeared unqualified for the position. In addition, Cipel could not obtain a security approval from the federal government, as he was Israeli and not a U.S. citizen; therefore, the FBI and the Secret Service would not provide him with intelligence. (In a 2004 interview, Cipel stated that his situation had been intentionally misrepresented by the governor&#x27;s office and asserted that he had never actually been responsible for internal security under the governor.)

McGreevey assisted Cipel in obtaining a townhouse near McGreevey&#x27;s home. Cipel reportedly stated that he needed to live near the governor because his job involved being on call on a 24-hour basis. &quot;According to the &quot;Star-Ledger&quot; newspaper, McGreevey even accompanied Cipel on a final walk-through of the townhouse, which the real estate agent said she found odd&quot;.

In March 2002, Cipel stepped down from his Homeland Security position and was reassigned to an advisor position regarding government operations. In August 2002, Cipel resigned from the McGreevey administration.

On the afternoon of August 12, 2004, faced with threats from Cipel&#x27;s lawyer, Allen Lowy, that Cipel would file a sexual harassment lawsuit against him in Mercer County Court, McGreevey held a press conference announcing that he had &quot;engaged in an adult consensual affair with another man&quot; (whom his aides immediately named as Cipel) and that he would resign effective November 15, 2004. New Jersey political circles had speculated about McGreevey&#x27;s sexual orientation and questions about his relationship with Cipel had been alluded to in the media. For his part, Cipel later asserted that he was heterosexual and denied having had an affair with McGreevey; Cipel has contended that McGreevey subjected him to sexual harassment and sexual assault and then fired him when his advances were rejected. In his own words, Cipel claims he was one of many victims of McGreevey&#x27;s sexual harassment, that he had &quot;no romantic affair&quot; with the governor, but rather was taken advantage of.

<doc id="896196" wikidata="Q1627684" url="?curid=896196" title="Naval Station Norfolk">
<text>Naval Station Norfolk is a United States Navy base in Norfolk, Virginia, that is the headquarters and home port of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Fleet Forces Command. The installation occupies about of waterfront space and of pier and wharf space of the Hampton Roads peninsula known as Sewell&#x27;s Point. It is the world&#x27;s largest naval station, with the largest concentration of U.S. Navy forces through 75 ships alongside 14 piers and with 134 aircraft and 11 aircraft hangars at the adjacently operated Chambers Field. Port Services controls more than 3,100 ships&#x27; movements annually as they arrive and depart their berths.

Air Operations conducts over 100,000 flight operations each year, an average of 275 flights per day or one every six minutes. Over 150,000 passengers and 264,000 tons of mail and cargo depart annually on Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft and other AMC-chartered flights from the airfield&#x27;s AMC Terminal.

==History==

The area where the base is located was the site of the original 1907 Jamestown Exposition.

In 1915, the Headquarters of the 5th Naval District was established. In April 1917, shortly after the United States entered World War I, a bill was passed for the purchase of the land, and money was set aside in the amount of $1.6 million for the development of the base. The Naval Operating Base (NOB) and other facilities were established. By 1918, there were 34,000 enlisted men at the base. However, by the war&#x27;s end, the base was reduced in personnel and put into a &quot;standby mode.&quot;
When World War II began in Europe in 1939, the base became more active again. New facilities were built, including new runways for aircraft, part of Naval Air Station Norfolk. It also had ramps built to be used by seaplanes to be operated by the Navy during the war. About 400 acres was acquired and, by 1943, the air station had become a central airfield for operations. It trained naval air units for the rest of the war.

In March 1946, the Chief of Naval Operations ordered the Commandant of the 5th Naval District to place NOB Norfolk and NAS Norfolk as separate installations under the command of Commandant Naval Base, whose title was soon changed to Commander, Navy Region, Mid-Atlantic.

Following World War II, NOB Norfolk became the primary base of the Atlantic Fleet. It was one of the largest naval bases in the world.

On 1 January 1953, the name of the naval base was officially changed to Naval Station Norfolk (NS Norfolk), after being known as the NOB.

In 1968, the Naval Air Station was given a major role in John F. Kennedy&#x27;s vision of putting a man on the moon. The air station became Recovery Control Center Atlantic, which provided command, control, and communications for the ships and aircraft that participated in the recovery operations of Apollo 7.

Due to the end of the Cold War, a drawdown began in the 1990s, and the Navy began reducing shore installations to help with operating costs. Due to this, the Navy merged the separate Naval Station Norfolk and Naval Air Station Norfolk into a single installation to be called Naval Station Norfolk, which became official on 5 February 1999.

Following the attack on USS &quot;Cole&quot; in October 2000 and the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, the base had some major upgrades to its security gates, costing more than $12.5 million.

On 26 January 2017, Naval Station Norfolk celebrated its centennial at the Pennsylvania House, a historical building built for the Jamestown Exposition, located on the base.

==Incidents==
On Easter (3 April) of 1988, members of the anti-nuclear group Plowshares boarded the battleship with visitors for a ship&#x27;s tour and left their group to do symbolic damage to the ship&#x27;s empty Tomahawk missile launchers, using hammers and their own blood.

On March 24, 2014, a shooting at NS Norfolk resulted in the death of a sailor and a civilian. The shooting occurred around 11:20 p.m. EDT aboard . Security forces shot and killed the civilian who had allegedly shot the sailor aboard the vessel. The base was closed for a short time after the shooting on USS &quot;Mahan&quot;.

On 26 July 2022, a severe thunderstorm with winds of and over caused nine helicopters assigned to Naval Station Norfolk to be damaged. Damaged aircraft include the MH-60 Seahawk and MH-53E Sea Dragon, according to the Navy.

==Operational units==
Naval Station Norfolk is home port of four carrier strike groups and their assigned ships. In addition, the Naval Station plays host to several Military Sealift Command ships, as well as the submarines of the Atlantic Fleet.

As of October 2022, the following operational units are headquartered or homeported at Naval Station Norfolk:

<text>George Caley (10 June 1770 – 23 May 1829) was an English botanist and explorer, active in Australia for the majority of his career.

==Early life==
Caley was born in Craven, Yorkshire, England, the son of a horse-dealer. He was educated at the Free Grammar School at Manchester for around four years and was then taken into his father&#x27;s stables. According to a letter which was sent to William Withering on 15 June 1798, he started teaching himself botany after he coming across a volume of book about farriery which was written by William Gibson cause he became interested in the herbs mentioned in prescriptions. He started learning botany by studying Botanical arrangement (1787–92) by William Withering. He changed his job to that of a weaver in order to allow himself to spend more time with his associate in Manchester School of Botanists which consist of John Mellor, James Crowther, and John Dewhurst. This school was also attended by John Horsefield on 1808. In March 1795 he wrote to Sir Joseph Banks who, after warning him about the small financial rewards to be expected by a botanist for his labour, suggested that he might be able to obtain work for him as a gardener&#x27;s labourer, which would give opportunities of increasing his knowledge. He worked in Kew Gardens and other gardens.

==Australia==

Banks appointed Caley as a botanical collector in New South Wales in 1798. He was given a free passage to Sydney aboard the &quot;Speedy&quot;, where he arrived on 15 April 1800. He was paid weekly wage of 15 shillings, was allowed rations by the government and he was also given a cottage at Parramatta. Governor King, writing to Banks in September 1800, expressed his intention to establish a botanical garden near the cottage. Caley was assisted by Daniel Moowattin an Aboriginal man of the Darug people. Daniel was Caley&#x27;s interpreter, bush guide, gatherer of plant and animal specimens, bird-trapper, servant and companion on expeditions around Sydney.

Caley sent many botanical and other specimens to Banks and his letters also kept Banks informed of the general conditions of the colony as well as scientific matters. Caley was the first to make a serious effort to study the Eucalyptus. In 1801 Caley went with Lieutenant James Grant to Western Port and in 1804 he gave King a long report on &quot;A journey to ascertain the Limits or Boundaries of Vaccary Forest&quot; (the Cowpastures). Caley was able to report on the wild cattle, which he found considerably increased in numbers. In November 1804 Caley, with three convict assistants, attempted to cross the Blue Mountains along the northern edge of the Grose Valley. He managed to reach and ascend a mountain he named Mount Banks. However, upon being struck by the awe-inspiring views of the sheer cliffs of the Grose Valley stretching away to the south, he decided to turn back, unaware he was only a day&#x27;s walk away from the western escarpment and the open country lying beyond. In October 1805 he visited Norfolk Island and went to Hobart at the end of November that year.

In August 1808 Banks wrote to Caley offering him an annuity of £50 a year and to release him from all services beyond what he voluntarily wished to perform and to remain in New South Wales if he desired. Caley was homesick for England, however, and decided to return to England.

==Later life==
Caley returned to England in 1810 and in 1816 was appointed curator of the botanic gardens in St Vincent, West Indies. He resigned from this position in December 1822 and was back in England in the following May. He died on 23 May 1829. He had married in 1816 but his wife predeceased him without children.

Governor King found Caley &#x27;eccentric and morose&#x27;, both Banks and King found Caley difficult and at times tactless and unreasonable. He was, however, a good worker, a skilful and accurate botanist and he was thoroughly honest. He did not publish any works, but his collections did much to spread a knowledge of Australian plants in the early years of the nineteenth century. This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Caley when citing a botanical name. He is recognised in several place names, including a Reserve name and bushland pavilion name at Ku-ring-gai Wildflower Garden in St Ives, and in the orchid genus &quot;Caleana&quot; and the species &quot;Grevillea caleyi&quot;, &quot;Viola caleyana&quot;, &quot;Banksia caleyi&quot;, and &quot;Eucalyptus caleyi&quot;. A George Caley Society was formed in Saint Ives (New South Wales) in 2019.

<text>Jacques Sirmond (12 October 1559 – 7 October 1651), pseudonym Jacobus Cosmas Fabricius, was a French scholar and Jesuit.

Simond was born at Riom, Auvergne, France on 12 October 1559. He was educated at the Jesuit College of Billom. After having been a novice at Verdun and then at Pont-Mousson, he entered into the order on 26 July 1576. After having taught rhetoric at Paris he resided for a long time in Rome as secretary to Claudio Acquaviva (1590–1608). In 1637 he was confessor to Louis XIII. He died on 7 October 1651 in Paris.

==Works==
He brought out many editions of Latin and Byzantine chroniclers of the Middle Ages:
*Ennodius and Flodoard (1611)
*Sidonius Apollinaris (1614)
*the life of St Leo IX by the archdeacon Wibert (1615)
*Marcellinus and Idatius (1619)
*Anastasius the Librarian (1620)
*Eusebius of Caesarea (1643)
*Hincmar (1645)
*Theodulf of Orléans (1646)
*Hrabanus Maurus (1647)
*Rufinus and Loup de Ferrières (1650)
*his edition of the capitularies of Charles the Bald (&quot;Karoli Calvi et successorum aliquot Franciae regum capitula&quot;, 1623)
*edition of the councils of ancient France (&quot;Concilia antiquae Galliae&quot;, 1629, 3 vols., new ed. incomplete, 1789).

An essay in which he denied the identity of St Denis of Paris and St Denis the Areopagite (1641), caused a controversy. His &quot;Opera varia&quot;, where this essay is to be found, as well as a description in Latin verse of his voyage from Paris to Rome in 1590, have appeared in 5 vols (1696; new ed. Venice, 1728). To him is attributed &quot;Elogio di cardinale Baronio&quot; (1607).

<text>Visbur or Wisbur (Old Norse &quot;Certain/Undoubted Son&quot;) was a legendary Swedish king of the House of Ynglings and the son of Vanlandi. He was burned to death inside his hall by the arson of two of his own sons in revenge for rejecting their mother and denying them their heritage. He was succeeded by his son Dómaldi.

==Attestations==
Snorri Sturluson wrote of Visbur in his &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; (1225):

Snorri included a piece from &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; (9th century) in his account in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;:

The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; presents a Latin summary of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, older than Snorri&#x27;s quotation:

The even earlier source &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; cites the line of descent in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; and also gives Visburr as the successor of Vanlandi and the predecessor of Dómaldr: &quot;vi Vanlandi. vii Visburr. viii Dómaldr&quot;.

<text>In Norwegian knitting, a selburose () is a knitted rose pattern in the shape of a regular octagram. It is traditionally used for winter clothing such as the Selbu mitten (&quot;selbuvott&quot;) and sweaters (&quot;lusekofte, lopapeysa&quot; and &quot;mariusgenser&quot;). Of ancient origin, the pattern is associated with Selbu Municipality in Norway, and has become an international symbol of Norway (or Scandinavia generally), Christmas and winter.

== History ==
The design now known as the &quot;selburose&quot; has a long history. It appears in textiles across European history, and in knitting pattern books from Italy, France, Switzerland and Germany in the 16th to 18th century. It appears to combine designs of Islamic and Christian tradition based on Coptic and Byzantine art, or even the Sumerian Star of Ishtar. In Norway, the pattern was already in use prior to 1857 on sweaters from Western Norway based on Danish designs.

Marit Guldsetbrua Emstad (born 1841), a girl from Selbu, popularized the design in 1857 when she knitted three pairs of mittens with an eight-petalled rose design (&quot;åttebladrose&quot;) and brought them to church. She may have been inspired by stockings knitted by Marit Sessenggjerdet, a woman working for the same employer. The design became immediately popular in Selbu. The Norwegian Arts and Craft Club (&quot;Husflidslag&quot;) spread the &quot;selburose&quot; mitten fad across the country after 1910. By the 1930s, 100,000 pairs were made in Selbu every year, and by 1960, much of the town&#x27;s economy depended on the trade.

The popularity of the design in Norway may have been helped by the desire to establish a Norwegian national identity as the decades-long process of Norwegian independence from Sweden had thought leaders searching for the country&#x27;s &quot;true spirit&quot;. The bold, &quot;uniquely &quot;Norsk&quot;&quot; design of the &quot;selburose&quot; fit these aspirations. Norwegian girls were taught to knit the pattern, as a pair of &quot;selbuvotter&quot; became the traditional gift of a girl to her fiancé and his friends. The home industry of Selbu mitten knitting helped make Norwegian farming life economically feasible and gave women a measure of economic independence. Norwegian emigration and international trade spread the symbol across the world, where it is often interpreted as a snowflake or a star instead of a flower. This helped cement the association between the &quot;selburose&quot; and winter clothing and therefore winter itself.

<text>The 1996–97 United States network television schedule for the six major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers the primetime hours from September 1996 to August 1997. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series canceled after the 1995–96 season.

PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows released in May 1997 is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.

New series highlighted in bold.

Repeat airings or same-day rebroadcasts are indicated by .

All times are U.S. Eastern and Pacific Time (except for some live sports or events). Subtract one hour for Central, Mountain, Alaska and Hawaii–Aleutian times.

All sporting events air live in all time zones in U.S. Eastern time, with local and/or late-night programming (including Fox affiliates during the 10 p.m. ET/PT hour) by affiliates after game completion.

==Legend==
: Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.
: Cyan indicates the programs in the top 20 for the season.
: Magenta indicates the programs in the top 30 for the season.
Other Legend
* Light blue indicates local programming.
* Gray indicates encore programming.
* Blue-gray indicates news programming.
* Light green indicates sporting events.
* Light Purple indicates movies. 
* Red indicates series being burned off and other scheduled programs, including specials.

==Sunday==
==Monday==
Note: On CBS, the debut of Ink was delayed by a month due to production problems, resulting in another new sitcom, Pearl, which aired temporarily in its slot before moving to its own originally designated Wednesday time period in late October.

==Tuesday==
==Wednesday==
Note: On CBS, due to the effect of the debut delay of Ink on Monday, the first month of the new season on this night aired &quot;Almost Perfect&quot; at 8:30 p.m., followed by &quot;CBS Wednesday Movies&quot; at 9 p.m. The originally planned fall Wednesday lineup took shape at the end of October with Pearl taking over at 8:30 p.m., &quot;Almost Perfect&quot; moving to 9 p.m., Public Morals debuting at 9:30 p.m., and EZ Streets debuting at 10 p.m. This lasted for only one week in late October. CBS cancelled Public Morals after it aired the 1st, and only, episode. This meant Almost
Perfect would soon be cancelled. EZ Streets would be given a 2nd chance in the spring.

==Thursday==
==Friday==
Note: CBS picked up &quot;JAG&quot; after NBC cancelled it due to low ratings and it became a success afterwards.

This is the last season of &quot;Family Matters&quot; and &quot;Step by Step&quot; and the only season of &quot;Clueless&quot; to air on ABC&#x27;s TGIF block, until the following season, the former two shows were picked up by CBS and &quot;Clueless&quot; moved to UPN on Tuesdays.

==Saturday==
Note: &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; would return in November at 9:00 on Fox. &quot;Married... with Children&quot; moved to Sundays at 7-8pm in November, Mondays at 9:30 in January, and Mondays at 9pm in February. Lawless which aired on March 27, 1997, replacing the second half of America&#x27;s Most Wanted was canceled after one episode.

<text>Le Soir (, ) is a French-language Belgian daily newspaper. Founded in 1887 by Émile Rossel, it was intended as a politically independent source of news. Together with &quot;La Libre Belgique&quot;, it is one of the most popular Francophone newspapers in both Brussels and Wallonia, and since 2005 has been published in Berliner format. It is owned by Rossel &amp; Cie, which also owns several Belgian news outlets, as well as the French paper &quot;La Voix du Nord&quot;.

==History and profile==
&quot;Le Soir&quot; was founded as a free advertising newspaper in 1887. Later it became a paying paper.

When Belgium was occupied during the Second World War, &quot;Le Soir&quot; continued to be published under German censorship, unlike many Belgian newspapers which went underground. The paper, which became known as &quot;Le Soir Volé&quot; (or &quot;Stolen Le Soir&quot;), was parodied by the resistance group, the &quot;Front de l&#x27;Indépendance&quot; which in 1943 published a satirical pro-Allied edition of the paper, dubbed the &quot;Faux Soir&quot; (or &quot;Fake Soir&quot;), which was mixed with official copies of the paper and distributed to news kiosks in Brussels. The &quot;Stolen &quot;Le Soir&quot;&quot; was notable for including Hergé&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; cartoons in serialized form during the war.

The renewed production of the &quot;Free &quot;Le Soir&quot;&quot;, under Lucien Fuss, restarted on 6 September 1944, just days after the Allied Liberation of Brussels. The publisher of the paper is Rossel company.

==Circulation==
In the period of 1995–96 &quot;Le Soir&quot; had a circulation of 182,798 copies. Its 2002 circulation was 130,495 copies with a market share of 20.3%. The circulation of the paper was 104,000 copies in 2003 and 101,000 copies in 2004.

==Editorial stance==
Compared to its centre-right Catholic competitor, &quot;La Libre Belgique&quot;, &quot;Le Soir&quot; is seen as liberal and progressive with politically federalist leanings.

Reaffirmed on the occasion of the release of the new format on 15 November 2005, &quot;Le Soir&quot; describes its editorial stance as &quot;a progressive and independent daily newspaper.&quot; It describes its aims to be a &quot;counterweight&quot; and &quot;always alert, in line with society&quot;.

It describes its role as:
==Google controversy==
The newspaper gained some notoriety on the internet after it successfully sued the search engine Google for copyright infringement. The case was built on the fact that Google made parts of the newspaper&#x27;s website available through its search engine and its Google News service, even after the articles in question had been removed from the newspaper&#x27;s website. A Belgian judge ruled that this did not conform to Belgian regulations and ordered Google to remove all &quot;copyright violations&quot; from its websites. Google responded by removing all links to the newspaper not only from its news service but also from its search index.

==&quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; bomb threat==
In response to the terrorist attack on &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; in which 12 people died on 7 January 2015, some international organizations such as Reporters Without Borders and the Index on Censorship called for controversial &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; cartoons to be re-published in solidarity with the French satirical magazine and in defense of free speech. The &quot;Hamburger Morgenpost&quot; included &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; cartoons on its front cover on 8 January and was subsequently firebombed.

&quot;Le Soir&quot; faced bomb threats for republishing &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; cartoons, including many satirising religion.

<doc id="896218" wikidata="Q776205" url="?curid=896218" title="Vanlandi">
<text>Vanlandi or &quot;Vanlande&quot; (Old Norse &quot;Man from the Land of the Vanir&quot;) according to mythology was a Swedish king at Uppsala of the House of Yngling in Norse mythology. He was the son of Sveigðir whom he succeeded as king. He married a girl from &quot;Finnland&quot;, but forgot about her. In revenge, the girl arranged so that Vanlandi was hag ridden to death. He was succeeded by his son Visbur.

==Attestations==
Snorri Sturluson wrote of Vanlandi in his &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; (1225) (note that the translator has rendered &quot;Finnland&quot; as Finland):

Snorri also quoted some lines from &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; composed in the 9th century:

The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; presents a Latin summary of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, older than Snorri&#x27;s quotation:
The even earlier source &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; cites the line of descent in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; and also gives Vanlandi as the successor of Svegðir and the predecessor of Visbur: &quot;v Svegðir. vi Vanlandi. vii Visburr. viii Dómaldr&quot;.

==Geography==
&quot;Geographical note&quot;: According to the article &quot;Skuttunge&quot; in &quot;Nationalencyklopedin&quot;, the creek &quot;skutá&quot; passed its name onto the village of Skuttunge and the parish of &quot;Skuttunge&quot; (&quot;sv&quot;). The area does not only contain raised stones, but also 45 grave fields (most from the Iron Age), including a dolmen. The creek is today named after the village.

The area has undergone considerable Post-glacial rebound. Rising about 0.5 m each 100 years. This has significantly changed the position of the seashore, lakes, rivers and human settlements over time.

<doc id="896220" wikidata="Q122960575" url="?curid=896220" title="Political drama">
<text>A political drama can describe a play, film or TV program that has a political component, whether reflecting the author&#x27;s political opinion, or describing a politician or series of political events.

Dramatists who have written political dramas include Aaron Sorkin, Robert Penn Warren, Sergei Eisenstein, Bertolt Brecht, Jean-Paul Sartre, Howard Brenton, Caryl Churchill, and Federico García Lorca.

==Theatre==
In the history of theatre, there is long tradition of performances addressing issues of current events, especially those central to society itself. The political satire performed by the comic poets at the theatres had considerable influence on public opinion in the Athenian democracy. Those earlier Western dramas, arising out of the polis, or democratic city-state of Greek society, were performed in amphitheaters, central arenas used for theatrical performances, religious ceremonies and political gatherings; these dramas had a ritualistic and social significance that enhanced the relevance of the political issues being examined.

Shakespeare is an author of political theatre according to some academic scholars, who observe that his history plays examine the machinations of personal drives and passions determining political activity and that many of the tragedies such as &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot; dramatize political leadership and complexity subterfuges of human beings driven by the lust for power. For example, they observe that class struggle in the Roman Republic is central to &quot;Coriolanus&quot;.

Historically in Soviet Russia, the term political theatre was sometimes referred to as agitprop theatre or simply agitprop, after the Soviet term agitprop.

===Recent political drama===
In later centuries, political theatre has sometimes taken a different form. Sometimes associated with cabaret and folk theatre, it has offered itself as a theatre &#x27;of, by, and for the people&#x27;. In this guise, political theatre has developed within the civil societies under oppressive governments as a means of actual underground communication and the spreading of critical thought. Following the war there was an influx of political theatre, as people needed to discuss the losses of the war.

Often political theatre has been used to promote specific political theories or ideals, for example in the way agitprop theatre has been used to further Marxism and the development of communist sympathies. Russian agitprop theater was noted for its cardboard characters of perfect virtue and complete evil, and its coarse ridicule.

===Realism in theatre===
Less radical versions of political theatre have become established within the mainstream modern repertory - such as the realist dramas of Arthur Miller (&quot;The Crucible&quot; and &quot;All My Sons&quot;), which probe the behavior of human beings as social and political animals.

===Feminist theatre===
A new form of political theatre emerged in the twentieth century with feminist authors like Elfriede Jelinek or Caryl Churchill, who often make use of the non-realistic techniques detailed above.. During the 1960s and 1970s, new theatres emerged addressing women&#x27;s issues. These theatres went beyond producing feminist plays, but also sought to give women opportunities and work experience in all areas of theatrical production which had heretofore been dominated by men. In addition to playwright, producers, and actors, there were opportunities for women electricians, set designers, musical director, stage managers, etc.

===Brechtian theatre===
The Living Theatre, created by Judith Malina and her husband Julian Beck in 1947, which had its heyday in the 1960s, during the Vietnam War, is a primary example of politically oriented Brechtian performance art in the United States. Their original productions of Kenneth Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Brig&quot; (c. 1964), also filmed, and of Jack Gelber&#x27;s controversial play &quot;The Connection&quot; and its 1961 film rely upon and illustrate the dramaturgy of Brechtian alienation effect (&quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot;) that most political theatre uses to some extent, forcing the audience to take a &quot;critical perspective&quot; on events being dramatized or projected on screen(s) and building on aspects of the Theatre of Cruelty, which developed from the theory and practice of French early surrealist and proto-absurdist Antonin Artaud.

===American regional theatre===
In American regional theatre, a politically oriented social orientation occurs in Street theatre, such as that produced by the San Francisco Mime Troupe and ROiL. The Detroit Repertory Theatre has been among those regional theaters at the forefront of political comedy, staging plays like Jacob M. Appel&#x27;s Arborophilia, in which a lifelong Democrat prefers that her daughter fall in love with a poplar tree instead of a Republican activist. In 2014, Chicago&#x27;s Annoyance Theater produced Good Morning Gitmo: a one-act play by Mishu Hilmy and Eric Simon which lampoons the US Detention Center at Guantanamo Bay.

David Hare&#x27;s play &quot;Straight Line Crazy&quot; focuses on the life of Robert Moses, played by Ralph Fiennes, the controversial urban planner who worked in New York.

===English political theatre===
Kitchen sink realism or kitchen sink drama was a movement that developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s in theatre, art, novels, film, and television plays, whose protagonists usually could be described as &quot;angry young men&quot; who were disillusioned with modern society. It used a style of social realism to depict the lives of working class Britons, and to explore controversial social and political issues ranging from abortion to homelessness. The film &quot;It Always Rains on Sunday&quot; (1947) is a precursor of the genre, and John Osborne&#x27;s play &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1956) is an example of an early play in this genre.

The Iraq War is the focus of some recent British political drama; for example, &quot;Stuff Happens&quot;, by David Hare. David Edgar and Mark Ravenhill also satirize contemporary socio-political realities in their recent dramatic works.

Banner Theatre in Birmingham, England, in the United Kingdom, is an example of a specific kind of political theatre called documentary theatre.

===Scottish political theatre===
John McGrath, founder of the Scottish popular theatre company 7:84, argued that &quot;the theatre can never &#x27;cause&#x27; a social change. It can articulate pressure towards one, help people celebrate their strengths and maybe build their self-confidence… Above all, it can be the way people find their voice, their solidarity and their collective determination.&quot;

==Television==
The television series &quot;The West Wing&quot; created by Aaron Sorkin which focuses on the fictional Democratic administration of President Josiah Bartlet is widely considered one of the best TV shows of all time, having won three Golden Globe Awards and 26 Primetime Emmy Awards, including the award for Outstanding Drama Series, which it won four consecutive times from 2000 to 2003.

&quot;Yes, Minister&quot; and its sequel &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; were British political satire sitcoms.

Other television series that have been classified as political dramas include &quot;Borgen&quot;, &quot;Boss&quot;, &quot;Jack &amp; Bobby&quot;, &quot;The Bold Ones: The Senator&quot;, &quot;Commander in Chief&quot;, &quot;House of Cards&quot; (British and American versions), &quot;Madam Secretary&quot;, &quot;Designated Survivor&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;Ingobernable&quot;, &quot;Scandal&quot;, &quot;Billions&quot;, &quot;The Looming Tower&quot;, and &quot;The Mechanism&quot;.

&quot;The Good Wife&quot; can also be considered a political drama, especially in its critically acclaimed second season and fifth season. Races for political office, including state&#x27;s attorney, governor, and even a Presidential run, move in and out of the show&#x27;s narrative and the story of its main character, Alicia Florrick. However, Alicia&#x27;s primary profession as a litigator for the most part takes precedence in the narrative, and so the show more often focuses on her cases and related office politics, making it primarily a legal drama.

==Film==
There have been notables films that have been labeled as political dramas such as &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; and &quot;The Ides of March&quot;. A famous literary political drama which later made the transition to film was Robert Penn Warren&#x27;s &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot;.

<text>The Lipps–Meyer law, named for Theodor Lipps (1851–1914) and Max Friedrich Meyer (1873–1967), hypothesizes that the closure of melodic intervals is determined by &quot;whether or not the end tone of the interval can be represented by the number two or a power of two&quot;, in the frequency ratio between notes (see octave).

&quot;The &#x27;Lipps–Meyer&#x27; Law predicts an &#x27;effect of finality&#x27; for a melodic interval that ends on a tone which, in terms of an idealized frequency ratio, can be represented as a power of two.&quot;

Thus the interval order matters — a perfect fifth, for instance (C,G), ordered , 2:3, gives an &quot;effect of indicated continuation&quot;, while , 3:2, gives an &quot;effect of finality&quot;.

This is a measure of interval strength or stability and finality. Notice that it is similar to the more common measure of interval strength, which is determined by its approximation to a lower, stronger, or higher, weaker, position in the harmonic series.

The reason for the effect of finality of such interval ratios may be seen as follows. If formula_1 is the interval ratio in consideration, where formula_2 is a positive integer and formula_3 is the higher harmonic number of the ratio, then its interval can be determined by taking the base-2 logarithm formula_4 (3/2=7.02 and 4/3=4.98). The difference of these terms is the harmonic series representation of the interval in question (using harmonic numbers), whose bottom note formula_5 is a transposition of the tonic by &quot;n&quot; octaves. This suggests why descending interval ratios with denominator a power of two are final. A similar situation is seen if the term in the numerator is a power of two.

<text>Sveigðir, &quot;Sveigder&quot; or &quot;Swegde&quot; (Old Norse &quot;Waving One&quot;) was a Swedish king of the House of Yngling in Norse mythology. He was the son of Fjölner, whom he succeeded as king, and he married Vana of Vanaheimr, probably one of the Vanir. Lured by a dwarf, Sveigðir disappeared into a stone and never came back. He was succeeded by his son Vanlandi.

==Attestations==
Snorri Sturluson wrote of Sveigðir in his &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; (1225):

Snorri also quoted some lines from &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; composed in the 9th century:

The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; presents a Latin summary of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; written in the late 12th century and consequently older than Snorri&#x27;s quotation:
The even earlier source &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; from the early 12th century, cites the line of descent in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; and also gives Svegðir as the successor of Fjölnir and the predecessor of Vanlandi: &quot;iiii Fjölnir. sá er dó at Friðfróða. v Svegðir. vi Vanlandi&quot;.

<text>Jerry Allen Hausman (born May 5, 1946) is the John and Jennie S. MacDonald Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a notable econometrician. He has published numerous influential papers in microeconometrics. Hausman is the recipient of several prestigious awards including the John Bates Clark Medal in 1985 and the Frisch Medal in 1980.

He is perhaps most well known for his development of the Durbin–Wu–Hausman test.

He has done extensive work in the field of telecommunications, and is also recognized as an expert on antitrust and mergers, public finance and taxation, and regulation. Hausman also serves as the director of the MIT Telecommunications Economics Research Program.

His recent applied papers are on topics including the effect of new goods on economic welfare and their measurement in the CPI, new telecommunications technologies including cellular 3G and broadband, regulation of telecommunications and railroads, and competition in network markets. His recent econometrics papers include estimation of difference in difference models, semi-parametric duration models, mixed logit model, weak instruments, and errors in variables in non-standard situations.

Hausman received his B.A. from Brown University summa cum laude in 1968, and his Ph.D. from Nuffield College, Oxford University, where he was a Marshall Scholar, in 1973, with thesis titled &quot;Theoretical and empirical aspects of vintage capital models&quot;.

<text>Fjölnir ( ) is a legendary king in Norse mythology said to have been the son of Freyr (Frey) and his consort Gerðr (Gertha). The name appears in a variety of forms, including Fiolnir, Fjölner, Fjolner, and Fjolne. He was claimed as the progenitor of the Swedish Yngling dynasty, reigning from Gamla Uppsala. According to the &quot;Grottasöngr&quot;, Fjölnir lived from the 1st century BC to the early 1st century AD.

Fjölnir was said to have drowned in a vat of mead while visiting Peace-Fróði, a similarly legendary king of Zealand, the Danish island. Fjölnir was then succeeded by his son Sveigðir.

== Name ==
The etymology of the Old Norse name &quot;Fjǫlnir&quot; is unclear. It could stem from the verb &quot;fela&quot; (&#x27;to hide&#x27;), with &quot;Fjǫlnir&quot; as &#x27;the concealer [of the mead of poetry]&#x27;, or it may have emerged as an abbreviation of &quot;fjǫlviðr&quot; (&#x27;the very wise&#x27;). A derivation from &quot;fjǫl&quot; (&#x27;crowd&#x27;) has also been proposed, with &quot;Fjǫlnir&quot; as the &#x27;manifold&#x27; or the &#x27;multiplier&#x27;, although such an adverbial formation has no attested parallel. According to Lindow, the second etymology may be more fitting for a name of Odin, but the meaning remains uncertain in any case.

&quot;Fjölnir&quot; is indeed also frequently mentioned as a name of Odin. In &quot;Grímnismál&quot; (&#x27;The Lay of Grímnir&#x27;), Odin mentions it to Geirröðr as one of his many names that constitute the beginning of his epiphany. In &quot;Reginsmál&quot; (&#x27;The Lay of Reginn&#x27;), a man who is clearly Odin uses &quot;Fjölnir&quot; to refer to himself as he is standing on a mountain addressing Sigurd and Regin. In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; (&#x27;The Beguiling of Gylfi&#x27;), &quot;Fjölnir&quot; appears among the 12 names given for &quot;Alfödr&quot;, another name of Odin.

==Attestations==
===&quot;Grottasöngr&quot;===
&quot;Grottasöngr&quot; informs that Fjölnir was the contemporary of Caesar Augustus (63 BC – AD 14). He was a mighty king and the crops were bountiful and peace was maintained. At his time, King Fróði, the son of Friðleifr, ruled in Lejre in Zealand. &quot;Grottasöngr&quot; relates that when Fróði once visited Uppsala he brought two giantesses, Fenja and Menja:
:Fróði konungr sótti heimboð í Svíþjóð til þess konungs, er Fjölnir er nefndr. Þá keypti hann ambáttir tvær, er hétu Fenja ok Menja. Þær váru miklar ok sterkar.
However, the two giantesses were to be his undoing (see &quot;Grottasöngr&quot;).

===&quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;===
The &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; tells that Fjölnir was the son of Freyr himself and his wife Gerd, but he was the first of his house who was not to be deified.


Then Snorri tells that after Freyr&#x27;s death, Fjölnir became the king of Sweden. However, he drowned in a vat of mead visiting Peace-Fróði (&quot;Friðfróði&quot;), the king of Zealand.


===&quot;Ynglingatal&quot;===
Snorri also quoted some lines of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, composed in the 9th century:

:Translation: ‘The word of doom that fell upon Fjǫlnir was fulfilled where Fróði lived. And the windless wave of the spears of the bull [HORNS &gt; BEER] was to destroy the prince.’

The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; provides a Latin summary of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, which precedes Snorri&#x27;s quotation. It also informs that Fjölnir was the son of Freyr, the father of Svegder and that he drowned in a vat of mead:

The even earlier source &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; cites the line of descent in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; and also gives Fjölnir as the successor of Freyr and the predecessor of Svegðir. In addition to this it summarizes that Fjölnir died at Friðfróði&#x27;s (i.e. Peace-Fróði): &quot;iii Freyr. iiii Fjölnir. sá er dó at Friðfróða. v Svegðir&quot;:.

===&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;===
In &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, Book 1, Frodi corresponds to Hadingus and Fjölnir to Hundingus, but the story is a little different. It relates how King Hundingus of Sweden believed a rumor that King Hadingus of Denmark had died and held his obsequies with ceremony, including an enormous vat of ale. Hundingus himself served the ale, but accidentally stumbled and fell into the vat, choked, and drowned. When word came to King Hadingus of this unfortunate death, King Hadingus publicly hanged himself (see Freyr).

===&quot;Ballad of Veraldur&quot;===
Dumézil (1973, Appendix I) cites a Faroese ballad recorded in 1840 about Odin and his son Veraldur. It is believed that this Veraldur is related to Fjölnir and Freyr, as per Snorri&#x27;s statement that Freyr was &quot;veraldar goð&quot; (&quot;god of the world&quot;).

In this ballad Veraldur sets off to Zealand to seek the king&#x27;s daughter in marriage despite Odin&#x27;s warnings. The king of Zealand dislikes Veraldur and tricks him into falling into a brewing vat in a &quot;hall of stone&quot; where Veraldur drowns. When Odin hears the news, he decides to die and go to Asgard where his followers will also be welcomed after death.

The tale is similar to that of the death of Fjölnir, son of Freyr, who accidentally fell into a vat of mead and drowned while paying a friendly visit to Fridfródi the ruler of Zealand.

<doc id="896237" wikidata="Q1969617" url="?curid=896237" title="The Wrong Trousers">
<text>The Wrong Trousers is a 1993 British stop-motion animated short film directed and co-written by Nick Park. It was produced by Aardman Animations in association with Wallace and Gromit Ltd., BBC Bristol, Lionheart Television and BBC Children&#x27;s International. It is the second film featuring the eccentric inventor Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) and his dog Gromit, following &quot;A Grand Day Out&quot; (1989). In the film, a villainous penguin, Feathers McGraw, uses a pair of robotic trousers to steal a diamond from the city museum.

&quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot; debuted in the UK on 26 December 1993 on BBC Two. Like the previous film, it received critical acclaim. It won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1994. It was followed by &quot;A Close Shave&quot; (1995), &quot;The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot; (2005), &quot;A Matter of Loaf and Death&quot; (2008) and &quot;Vengeance Most Fowl&quot; (2024).

==Plot==

For his birthday, Wallace gives his dog, Gromit, a pair of robotic &quot;techno-trousers&quot; to take him on walks. To pay his debts, Wallace lets a room to a penguin, who befriends Wallace and drives Gromit out of the house. The penguin takes an interest in the trousers, which can walk on walls and ceilings, and secretly rewires them for remote control. Gromit discovers the penguin is Feathers McGraw, a criminal who disguises himself as a chicken by donning a red rubber glove on his head.

Feathers forces Wallace into the trousers, sends him through town to tire him out, then sends him to bed. Gromit spies on Feathers as he takes measurements of the city museum, and discovers his plans to steal a diamond. While Wallace sleeps, Feathers marches him to the museum in the trousers. He infiltrates the building and captures the diamond, but triggers the alarm, waking Wallace. Feathers marches him back to the house and traps him and Gromit in a wardrobe at gunpoint. 

Gromit rewires the trousers to break open the wardrobe, and he and Wallace pursue Feathers aboard their model train set. Wallace disarms Feathers and frees himself from the trousers. After Feathers&#x27; train collides with the trousers, Gromit captures him in a milk bottle. Feathers is imprisoned in the city zoo, and Wallace pays his debts with the reward money. The discarded techno trousers reactivate and walk off into the sunset. 

==Production==

Production began in 1990. Peter Sallis, who voiced Wallace, said &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot; was based loosely on the 1964 film &quot;Topkapi&quot;, and said it was his favourite &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot; film. David Sproxton, the co-founder of Aardman and the producer of the &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot; films, said that &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot; was &quot;a whole league higher up the food chain in terms of production values and storytelling&quot; compared to &quot;A Grand Day Out&quot;. 

Whereas Park wrote most of &quot;A Grand Day Out&quot;, for &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot; he worked with the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; writer Bob Baker. Baker took ideas from Park&#x27;s sketchbooks, suggesting they make a drawing of a penguin the villain. Park wanted to include a chase on a model railway, feeling it would be funny to stage a Hollywood-style action sequence in a living room, so Baker suggested they make a heist film with the train as the denouement. Sproxton described it as film noir, likening the alley scenes to Alfred Hitchcock. Feeling that most stop-motion animation used bland lighting, the animators tried to light the sets as if they were making a live-action thriller. The animators could not review their footage until it was developed in a separate studio in London. The first cut was 38 minutes long.

==Reception==
&quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot; was voted as the eighteenth-best British television show by the British Film Institute. The film has an approval rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 26 reviews, and an average score of 9.1/10. The critical consensus reads, &quot;An endearing and meticulous showcase of stop motion animation, &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot; also happens to be laugh-out-loud funny.&quot;

The film was awarded the Grand Prix at the Tampere Film Festival, and the Grand Prix at the World Festival of Animated film – Animafest Zagreb in 1994. &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1994. In 2024, Michael Hogan in &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s list of greatest Kid&#x27;s TV villains ranked Feathers McGraw number one, writing, &quot;The definitive screen villain of our age is a penguin with a red rubber glove on its head. The gun-toting, 3ft tall criminal mastermind first terrorised viewers in 1993 Oscar-winning short &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot;. [...] The fact that he&#x27;s mute with expressionless beady eyes only makes him more terrifying.&quot;

During a 2016 directors&#x27; roundtable interview conducted by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, the American filmmaker David O. Russell cited the climactic train sequence as an influence on his direction of the action in &quot;Three Kings&quot; (1999). The British filmmaker Danny Boyle said it was one of the greatest action sequences.

<text>Virginia Slims is an American brand of cigarettes owned by Altria. It is manufactured by Philip Morris USA (in the United States) and Philip Morris International (outside the United States).

Virginia Slims are narrower ( circumference) than standard cigarettes (hence, &quot;Slims&quot;), and are also longer than normal &quot;king-sized&quot; cigarettes (which are ). They are sold only in longer lengths, to afford the cigarettes a more &quot;elegant&quot; appearance and ostensibly to reduce the amount of smoke that they produce. They are also sold in &quot;Superslims&quot;, &quot;Lights&quot; (now called &quot;Gold&quot;), and &quot;Ultra Lights&quot; (now called &quot;Silver&quot;) varieties. All varieties are available in both menthol and non-menthol flavors. The original packaging was designed by Walter Landor and was white with colored stripes running lengthwise along the left side. In 2016, the packaging design was updated to replace the stripes with a more floral, mottled appearance.

==History==
Philip Morris introduced Virginia Slims on July 22, 1968 and marketed the brand as a female-oriented spinoff of the company&#x27;s Benson &amp; Hedges brand. The blends, flavorings, color scheme and overall marketing concepts closely followed the Benson &amp; Hedges model. Early packs (1968-1978) read &quot;Benson and Hedges Park Avenue New York&quot; near the bottom. 

The first test market was San Francisco. Originally scheduled for six months, it was cut short after seven weeks because of the success of the introduction. Distribution and marketing was implemented nationwide, and by September 30, 1968, the entire U.S. was covered. Then, in 1976, a full-flavor packing was test-marketed in Fresno, California. Designed to compete with R. J. Reynolds&#x27; More brand, the test ultimately failed and the product was withdrawn.

Virginia Slims Lights were successfully introduced in 1978. Although early marketing concepts depicted soft packs, Philip Morris decided to use a box-pack design only. During the 1970s and early 1980s, Virginia Slims Lights&#x27; sales were so significant that competitors began introducing their own slim, female-oriented brands (such as American Tobacco Company&#x27;s Misty, Brown &amp; Williamson&#x27;s Capri, Liggett&#x27;s Eve, and R. J. Reynolds&#x27; Dawn). In 1984, Virginia Slims Ovals were test-marketed in Rochester, Birmingham and Las Vegas, but were unsuccessful and withdrawn. Ovals were light and had an oval-shaped cross section.

In 1985, Virginia Slims Luxury Lights 120&#x27;s were introduced - a length packaging intended to better compete with R. J. Reynolds&#x27; More brand, as well as other 120&#x27;s on the market. After successfully test marketing in Portland, Oregon and Nashville, the new style was rolled out nationally. While there was initial concern that 120&#x27;s might cannibalize customers from other packings (especially Lights), this proved to be unfounded, as the 120&#x27;s appeared to attract a slightly older demographic. The packing has since become a mainstay of the smoking glamour community. It is arguable as to whether Virginia Slims Luxury Lights 120&#x27;s are truly &quot;light,&quot; as their strength compares closely with that of full-flavor cigarettes.
In 1987, Ultra Lights 100&#x27;s were introduced, in keeping with changing consumer tastes, other competitive entries and the Benson &amp; Hedges model. Marginally successful, this packing remains on the market today.

In 1989, Superslims 100&#x27;s (both menthol and non-menthol) were introduced in response to ultra-thin ( circumference) competition and consumer demand for an &quot;ultra low-tar&quot; and &quot;low-smoke&quot; product entry. These were also marginally successful, and remain on the market today. 

In 1993, a 10-pack version of Lights 100&#x27;s was introduced, with 10 cigarettes per pack, costing approximately half the price of a 20-pack. This entry had limited success and came under attack from critics; it was ultimately withdrawn.

In 1994, Virginia Slims Kings ( length) were designed as a discount entry and possibly to compete with other king-size entries such as R. J. Reynolds&#x27; Camel brand. It is not clear whether Kings were ever test-marketed, but they were never introduced on a nationwide basis.

In 2003, a box pack was introduced for full flavor 100&#x27;s in response to consumer demand. This packing is steadily displacing the classic soft pack. Also in 2003, the package graphics were slightly altered, changing the colors and striping along the edge.

In 2004, Luxury Ultra Lights 120&#x27;s (both menthol and non-menthol) were introduced with marginal success. It is likely that this packing will continue to be supported.

In 2008, Virginia Slims Superslims were introduced in a smaller-sized &quot;Purse Pack.&quot;

In 2016, the package graphics for all styles were slightly altered, changing the stripes along the edge to a more mottled and floral-like appearance.

All packings were simultaneously introduced in both menthol and non-menthol varieties. Unlike with most other brands, menthol represents 40–55% of the total sales of Virginia Slims (vs. 25–35% for other brands).

In all, there have been 11 packings introduced or test marketed in the U.S., of which seven remain on the market. There are other varieties marketed in the Asia-Pacific region (including the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Vietnam), Russia and South Africa. Virginia Slims has never had a significant European or South American presence.

==Marketing==
From inception, Virginia Slims have been designed and marketed as a female-oriented fashion brand, generally targeted to a younger demographic (18- to 35-year-olds). While various themes emerged in the marketing campaigns over the years, the basic threads have been independence, liberation, slimness, attractiveness, glamour, style, taste and a contrast to men&#x27;s cigarettes. Thus, Virginia Slims functioned to implement a female-centered marketing strategy, also known as &quot;femvertising&quot;.

A report by the Surgeon General of the United States has interpreted these marketing strategies as attempting to link smoking &quot;to women&#x27;s freedom, emancipation, and empowerment.&quot; This report also tied the increase of smoking among teenage girls to rises in sales of Virginia Slims and other &quot;niche&quot; brands marketed directly to women.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the themes of feminism and women&#x27;s liberation, with the &quot;You&#x27;ve Come a Long Way, Baby&quot; slogan, were often used in advertising for Virginia Slims. These ads often featured anecdotes about women in the early 20th century who were punished for smoking, usually by their husbands or other men, as compared to the present day when women had equal rights such as the right to vote. Later campaigns have used the slogan &quot;It&#x27;s a Woman Thing&quot; in the 1990s and &quot;Find Your Voice&quot; in the 2000s.

Television and print ads often featured well-known models and designer fashions. Print ads were generally placed in women&#x27;s magazines, and formed the mainstay of the marketing campaign, supplemented with billboards and point-of-purchase displays. From 1969 until cigarette advertising on television was prohibited in 1971, television advertising was an important component. The commercials would begin with actors in period costumes reenacting the early 20th century anecdotes in comedic fashion, followed by a glamorous modern-day model smoking the product while dressed in the latest fashions, accompanied by &quot;You&#x27;ve Come a Long Way, Baby,&quot; an up-tempo, catchy pop-rock jingle:

&lt;poem&gt;You&#x27;ve come a long way, baby
To get where you&#x27;ve got to today
You&#x27;ve got your own cigarette now, baby
You&#x27;ve come a long, long way
&lt;/poem&gt;

On January 1, 1971 at 11:59 p.m, an ad for Virginia Slims was aired during &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; that became notable as the final cigarette advertisement to air on television before the implementation of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act, which prohibited the radio and television advertising of all cigarettes in the United States.

Several other, less important, marketing vehicles were employed, such as the Virginia Slims Book of Days (a day timer/calendar book), fashion shows and an extensive line of products, apparel and accessories.

The &quot;Find Your Voice&quot; ad campaign was criticized as offensive to those who have lost their voices to throat cancer from smoking, especially in light of the well-publicized laryngectomy of Janet Sackman, a former model for another cigarette brand who developed throat and lung cancer. The campaign was an attempt to associate the brand with themes of empowerment, independence, women&#x27;s rights and sexual allure. The campaign was also criticized for targeting minority women. The campaign was also criticized for the slogan &quot;NEVER let the goody two shoes get you down,&quot; which uses reactance to promote product use. It has also been suggested that it urges smokers to disregard health warnings. The campaign also featured a model using a throat-touching gesture, which echoes earlier ads that made more explicit claims of voice box benefits.

The Leo Burnett advertising agency handled the Virginia Slims account throughout most of the product lifetime.

==Market share==
From its inception until 1978, Virginia Slims saw a steady increase in market share to 1.75% (3.9% of all female smokers). With the introduction of Lights in 1978, the market share increased to 2.5%. Other packings, including 120&#x27;s, Ultra Lights, and Superslims helped push the market share to a peak of 3.1% (nearly 7% of female smokers) in 1989. With increased competition from other brands, notably Capri and Misty, the brand lost ground but stabilized at around 2.4% though 2003. Since then, it has lost about 0.1% per year, and was 2.0% in 2007 and 1.8% in 2009. This slow but steady decline is expected to continue, since the brand is no longer heavily promoted. Despite this, brand loyalty is well above average, and is still one of the highest in the industry.

==Markets==
Virginia Slims are mainly sold in the United States, but also were or still are sold in the British Virgin Islands, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, France, Switzerland, Portugal, Poland, Hungary, Cyprus, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and Australia.

==Sponsorship==
===Women&#x27;s tennis===
Virginia Slims sponsored the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) Tour from 1971 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1994. This sponsorship is sometimes credited for the growth and success of women&#x27;s tennis during the 1970s and early 1980s.

Virginia Slims also sponsored the Virginia Slims Circuit, a tennis tour consisting of a group of originally nine female professional players. Formed in 1970, the Virginia Slims Circuit eventually became the basis for the later WTA Tour. The players, dubbed the Original 9, rebelled against the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) because of the wide inequality between the prize money paid to male and female tennis players.

Magazine publisher and former tennis pro Gladys Heldman, with the assistance of Joe Cullman of Philip Morris, paid $5,000 out of her own pocket to allow the &quot;Original 9&quot; to sign token $1 contracts and set up their own tour of eight professional tournaments in 1970, sponsored by Virginia Slims. This independent women&#x27;s professional tennis circuit provided more prize money than had been provided previously by the USLTA and other organizations. Despite the USLTA&#x27;s suspension of the &quot;Original 9&quot; from its tournaments, by the end of the year, the Virginia Slims Circuit was able to boost its numbers from nine to 40 members, which helped pave the way for the first full year season of the circuit in 1971. In the aftermath of the creation of the WTA in 1973, the Virginia Slims Circuit would eventually absorb the ILTF&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Grand Prix circuit and become the WTA Tour.

==In popular culture==
===Music===
&quot;You&#x27;ve Come a Long Way, Baby&quot; is the name of the second album of the electronic musician Fatboy Slim, released in 1998. The Black Lips&#x27; song &quot;Dog Years&quot; references Virginia Slims Ultra Lights. Greyson Chance references Virginia Slims as his mother&#x27;s favorite brand and mentions it multiple times on his &#x27;Portraits&#x27; album.

Outkast’s “Elevators (Me and You)” makes specific references to the cigarette and its famous tag line in the last verse, when André 3000 raps, “ Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes. From Virginia...”

Singer Britney Spears admits in her book “The Woman in Me” that this is the brand of cigarettes she usually smokes. In chapter 4 of the book she says: &quot;My mom was a typical young Southern mom, often gossiping, always smoking cigarettes with her friends at the bar (she smoked Virginia Slims, the same cigarettes I smoke now) or talking with them on the phone.&quot;

===Television===
Episode 66 of the animated television show &quot;Duckman&quot; is titled &quot;You&#x27;ve Come a Wrong Way, Baby&quot; and its plot involves the tobacco industry.

<doc id="896239" wikidata="Q122279" url="?curid=896239" title="Hermann Rorschach">
<text>Hermann Rorschach (; 8 November 1884 – 2 April 1922) was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst. His education in art helped to spur the development of a set of inkblots that were used experimentally to measure various unconscious parts of the subject&#x27;s personality. His method has come to be referred to as the Rorschach test, iterations of which have continued to be used over the years to help identify personality, psychotic, and neurological disorders. Rorschach continued to refine the test until his premature death at age 37.

==Early life==
Rorschach was born in Zürich, Switzerland, the eldest of three children born to Ulrich and Philippine Rorschach. He had one sister, Anna, and one brother, Paul. He spent his childhood and youth in Schaffhausen, in northern Switzerland. He was known to his school friends and in his fraternity () as &quot;Klex&quot;, or &quot;inkblot&quot; since he enjoyed klecksography, the making of fanciful inkblot &quot;pictures&quot;. By the time of Rorschach&#x27;s youth, consideration of the projective significance of inkblots already had some historical context. For example, in 1857, German doctor Justinus Kerner had published a popular book of poems, each of which was inspired by an accidental inkblot. It has been speculated that the book was known to Rorschach. French psychologist Alfred Binet had also experimented with inkblots as a creativity test.

Rorschach&#x27;s father, an art teacher, encouraged him to express himself creatively through painting and drawing conventional pictures. As the time of Rorschach&#x27;s high school graduation approached, he could not decide between a career in art and one in science. He wrote a letter to the German biologist Ernst Haeckel asking his advice. A major factor that led Rorschach to differ from his father and not pursue art was that his father died while he was still trying to decide what to study.

==Education and career==

Rorschach, in his early years, attended Schaffhausen Cantonal School in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Rorschach was a bright student from the beginning, and he often tutored other students at his school. After Ernst Haeckel suggested a career in science, Rorschach attended Académie de Neuchâtel in 1904 studying geology and botany. After just a single term, he transferred to the Université de Dijon to take French classes. The same year he enrolled in medical school at the University of Zurich. While studying, Rorschach began learning Russian, and in 1906, while studying in Berlin, he traveled to Russia for a holiday.

Travel was a large part of his life after medical school. On a trip to Dijon, in France, he met a man who taught him about Russian culture. Torn by the decision of whether to stay in Switzerland or move to Russia, he eventually took a job as first assistant at a Cantonal Mental Hospital. While working at the hospital, Rorschach finished his doctoral dissertation in 1912 under the psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, who had taught Carl Jung. The excitement in intellectual circles over psychoanalysis constantly reminded Rorschach of his childhood inkblots. Wondering why different people often saw entirely different things in the same inkblots, he began, while still a medical student, showing inkblots to schoolchildren and analyzing their responses. This dissertation contained the origins for his ink blot experiment.

All the while, Rorschach remained fascinated by Russian culture. In 1913, he obtained a fellowship opportunity in Russia, where he continued to study contemporary psychiatric methods. Rorschach spent some time in the village of Kryukovo outside of Moscow, and in 1914 he returned to Switzerland to work at the Waldau University Hospital in Bern, part of the . In 1915, Rorschach took the position of assistant director at the regional psychiatric hospital at Herisau, and in 1921 he wrote his book &quot;Psychodiagnostik&quot;, which was to form the basis of the inkblot test.

==Personal life==
Rorschach graduated in medicine at Zurich in 1909 and at the same time became engaged to Olga Stempelin, a girl from Kazan (in the present-day Russia). The couple were married in 1913 and lived in Russia until their return to Switzerland, for Rorschach&#x27;s work, in 1915. They had two children, a daughter Elizabeth (called &quot;Lisa&quot;, 1917–2006) and a son, Ulrich Wadin (called &quot;Wadim&quot;, 1919–2010). Neither Lisa nor Wadim had children.

One year after writing &quot;Psychodiagnostik&quot;, Rorschach died of peritonitis, probably resulting from a ruptured appendix. He was still associate director of the Herisau Hospital when he died, aged 37, on 2 April 1922.

==Legacy==
In 2001 the inkblot test was criticised as pseudoscience and its use was declared controversial by &quot;Scientific American&quot;, as different psychologists drew different findings from the same data, suggesting their results were subjective rather than objective. In 2013 and 2015 two systemic reviews and meta-analyses were published that resulted in the criticism as pseudoscience being lifted. In November 2013, Google celebrated the 129th anniversary of Rorschach&#x27;s birth with a Google Doodle showing an interpretation of his inkblot test. Aside from the MMPI, the Rorschach Inkblot Method has generated more published research than any other psychological personality measure.

The cover of &quot;The Essentials of Psycho-analysis&quot; by Sigmund Freud, published in the &quot;Vintage Freud&quot; series by Vintage Books in 2005, features artwork by Michael Salu based on a Rorschach Inkblot.

In 2016, the Phobrain website began showing dynamically generated pairs of photos, which the author dubs &#x27;Rorschach pairs&#x27; when labelled accept/reject by a user. Unlike descriptions of inkblots and their characterizations, this instantiation of the Rorschach concept is numerically/topologically analysable, with neural nets and latent space geometries capable of predicting preference to as much as 90% accuracy. The immediate application is a workbench for studying perception, generating novelty, and self-reflection. Open source release was in 2023, under the AGPL license.

In recent years, Rorschach&#x27;s facial resemblance to the American actor Brad Pitt has been noted.

<text>Jan Swafford (born September 10, 1946) is an American author and composer. He earned his Bachelor of Arts &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Harvard College and his M.M.A. and D.M.A. from the Yale School of Music. His teachers included Earl Kim at Harvard, Jacob Druckman at Yale, and Betsy Jolas at Tanglewood. He has written respected musical biographies of Charles Ives, Johannes Brahms, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart as well as the &quot;Vintage Guide to Classical Music&quot;. He appeared in the award-winning 2018 German documentary &quot;The Unanswered Ives&quot;.

==Works==
Swafford has written columns on music and other subjects in &quot;Slate&quot;, and is heard as a commentator on NPR and the BBC. He is a regular program annotator for orchestras and venues including the Boston Symphony, Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony, San Francisco Symphony, the Metropolitan Opera, and Carnegie Hall.

His writing honors include a 2012 Deems Taylor Award for internet writing and a Mellon Fellowship at Harvard. His Brahms and Ives biographies were end-of-year Critics&#x27; Choices in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The Ives biography was nominated for a National Book Critics Circle award in biography and won the Pen-Winship prize for a book on a New England subject. His biography &quot;Beethoven: Anguish and Triumph&quot; in its first week appeared on the New York Times bestseller list.

He has taught at schools including Boston University, Amherst College, Tufts, and Boston Conservatory.

Swafford&#x27;s music, which is highly lyrical and moves freely between tonality and atonality, has been called New Romantic in style. There are equal if less overt contributions from world music, especially Indian and Balinese, and from jazz and blues. The titles of his works reveal a steady inspiration from nature and landscape. The composer views his own work as a kind of classicism: a concern with clarity, directness, and expression, or as he puts it, &quot;music that sounds familiar though it is new, works that sound like they wrote themselves.&quot;

Notable are his orchestral works &quot;Landscape with Traveler&quot; (1979–80), &quot;After Spring Rain&quot; (1981–82) and &quot;From the Shadow of the Mountain&quot; (2001), the piano quintet &quot;Midsummer Variations&quot; (1985), the piano quartet &quot;They Who Hunger&quot; (1989), and the piano trio &quot;They That Mourn&quot; (2002), the last in memoriam 9/11. In 2012 cellist Rhonda Rider premiered his solo cello work &quot;The Silence at Yuma Point&quot;, part of a commissioning project of pieces inspired by the Grand Canyon (where Swafford has been a frequent hiker). His compositional awards include a National Endowment for the Arts Composer Grant, two Massachusetts Artists Foundation Fellowships, and a Tanglewood Fellowship. His work is published by Peermusic Classical and Meridian Records.

<text>Tyrannius Rufinus, also called Rufinus of Aquileia (; 344/345–411), was an early Christian monk, philosopher, historian, and theologian who worked to translate Greek patristic material, especially the work of Origen, into Latin.

==Life==

Rufinus was born in 344 or 345 in the Roman city of Julia Concordia (now Concordia Sagittaria), near Aquileia (in modern-day Italy) at the head of the Adriatic Sea. It appears that both of his parents were Christians.

Around 370, he was living in a monastic community in Aquileia when he met Jerome. In about 372, Rufinus followed Jerome to the eastern Mediterranean, where he studied in Alexandria under Didymus the Blind for some time, and became friends with Macarius the elder and other ascetics in the desert. In Egypt, if not even before leaving Italy, he had become intimately acquainted with Melania the Elder, a wealthy and devout Roman widow. When she moved to Palestine, taking with her a number of clergy and monks on whom the persecutions of the Arian Valens had borne heavily, Rufinus followed her, moving to Jerusalem in 380. There, while his patroness lived in a convent of her own in Jerusalem, Rufinus, at her expense, gathered together a number of monks to form a new monastery on the Mount of Olives, devoting himself to the study of Greek theology. This combination of the contemplative life and the life of learning had already developed in the Egyptian monasteries. When Jerome came to Bethlehem in 386, the friendship formed at Aquileia was renewed. Jerome, along with his patroness Paula, set up a similar community in Bethlehem a few years later. Another of the intimates of Rufinus was John II, Bishop of Jerusalem, and formerly a monk of the Natrun desert, by whom he was ordained to the priesthood in 390.

In 394, as a result of the attacks by Epiphanius of Salamis upon the doctrines of Origen made during a visit to Jerusalem, a fierce quarrel broke out, which found Rufinus and Jerome on different sides. Although both Jerome and Rufinus had previously been great admirers of Origen&#x27;s work, in the light of Epiphanius&#x27; criticism of Origen, Jerome felt that Rufinus was not fierce enough in attacking the works of Origen. Three years afterwards a formal reconciliation was brought about between Jerome and Bishop John, with whom Rufinus sided, but this was to prove only temporary.

In the autumn of 397 Rufinus embarked for Rome, where, finding that the theological controversies of the East were exciting much interest and curiosity, he published a Latin translation of the &quot;Apology of Pamphilus for Origen&quot;. In an appendix, he claimed that many of the controversial features in Origen&#x27;s teaching arose from interpolations and falsifications of the genuine text. In his somewhat free translation of Origen&#x27;s &quot;De Principiis&quot; (&quot;Περὶ Αρχῶν&quot;), published 398/399, Rufinus downplayed these controversial passages. In the preface to &quot;De Principiis&quot;, Rufinus referred to Jerome as an admirer of Origen, and as having already translated some of his works with modifications of ambiguous doctrinal expressions. This allusion annoyed Jerome, who was exceedingly sensitive as to his theological and scholarly reputation. The consequence was a bitter pamphlet war, with Rufinus&#x27;s &quot;Against Jerome&quot; and Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Against Rufinus&quot;.

At the instigation of Theophilus of Alexandria, Pope Anastasius I (399-401) summoned Rufinus from Aquileia to Rome to vindicate his orthodoxy, but he excused himself from a personal attendance in a written &quot;Apologia pro fide sua&quot;. The pope in his reply expressly condemned Origen, but left the question of Rufinus&#x27;s orthodoxy to his own conscience. He was, however, regarded with suspicion in orthodox circles (cf. the &quot;Decretum Gelasii&quot;, 20).

Rufinus spent most of the first decade of the fifth century translating Origen. He translated Origen&#x27;s homilies for the whole Heptateuch except Deuteronomy, and others on selected Psalms, the Song of Songs, and 1 Samuel. Rufinus&#x27;s translation of Origen&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on Romans&quot; (c. 405-6) gave fresh stimulus to discussions of destiny and free will that had been going on in Roman circles since the mid-390s and would shortly become an issue in Augustine&#x27;s clash with Pelagius.

Rufinus also translated other works. These include Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, translated in 401 at the request of Bishop Chromatius of Aquileia as an antidote to the terror caused by the Gothic incursions into Italy. Rufinus omits much of Eusebius&#x27; tenth book, and compresses what remains of it into book 9; he also retouches the narrative in several places and adds two books of his own to bring the account down to the death of Theodosius the Great (395).

Such translations often appear to have been done as a result of a commission or with a local readership in mind, and so it seems likely that Rufinus worked with the support of friends and patrons. Between 397 and 408 he lived in Italy, probably mainly in Rome and Aquileia; in 408 Rufinus was at the monastery of Pinetum (in the Campagna?), having been driven there by the arrival of Alaric in northern Italy. He fled to Sicily when Alaric moved south and pillaged Rome in 410. He was in the company of Melania the Younger in his flight. He died in Sicily in 411.

==Works==

===Original works===
* &quot;Commentarius in symbolum apostolorum&quot;: a commentary on the Apostles&#x27; Creed which gives evidence of its use and interpretation in 4th-century Italy. (Commentary on the Apostles&#x27; Creed, at New Advent)
* The Church History of Rufinus of Aquileia.
Many of his extant works are defences of himself against attacks by Jerome.
* &quot;De Adulteratione Librorum Origenis&quot; – an appendix to his translation of the &quot;Apology&quot; of Pamphilus, and intended to show that many of the features in Origen&#x27;s teaching which were then held to be objectionable arise from interpolations and falsifications of the genuine text
* &quot;De Benedictionibus XII Patriarcharum Libri II&quot; – an exposition of Gen. xlix.
* &quot;Apologia s. Invectivarum in Hieronymum Libri II&quot;
* &quot;Apologia pro Fide Sua ad Anastasium Pontificem&quot; (Apology, Sent to Anastasius, Bishop of the City of Rome, at New Advent)
* &quot;Historia Eremitica&quot; – consisting of the lives of thirty-three monks of the Nitrian desert

The anti-Origenist &quot;Liber de fide&quot; was in the past sometimes attributed to Rufinus of Aquileia, but now it is more often assigned to Rufinus the Syrian.

===Translations from Greek to Latin===
Rufinus translated the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; of Eusebius of Caesarea and continued the work from the reign of Constantine I to the death of Theodosius I (395). It was published in 402 or 403.

Origen&#x27;s commentary on the New Testament Epistle to the Romans, along with many of his sermons on the Old Testament, survive only in versions by Rufinus. The full text of Origen&#x27;s &quot;De principiis&quot; (&quot;On first principals&quot;) also survives only in Rufinus&#x27;s translation. Jerome, earlier a friend of Rufinus, fell out with him and wrote at least three works opposing his opinions and condemning his translations as flawed. For instance, Jerome prepared a (now lost) translation of Origen&#x27;s &quot;De principiis&quot; to replace Rufinus&#x27;s translation, which Jerome said was inadequate.

Other translations by Rufinus include:
# the &quot;Instituta Monachorum&quot; and some of the &quot;Homilies&quot; of Basil of Caesarea
# the &quot;Apology&quot; of Pamphilus, referred to above
# Origen&#x27;s &quot;Homilies&quot; (Gen. Lev. Num. Josh. Kings, also Cant, and Rom.)
# &quot;De recta in Deum fide&quot; by Pseudo-Origen (Adamantius)
# &quot;Opuscula&quot; of Gregory of Nazianzus
# the &quot;Sententiae&quot; of Sixtus, an unknown Greek philosopher
# the &quot;Sententiae&quot; of Evagrius
# the &quot;Clementine Recognitions&quot; (the only form in which that work is now extant)
# the &quot;Canon Paschalis&quot; of Anatolius Alexandrinus.
# Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities&quot; and &quot;The Jewish War&quot; (Josephus de antiquitatibus ac de bello judaico.)

===Quotes from Rufinus===

He said;

&quot;[The Incarnation] was that the divine nature of the Son of God might be like a kind of hook hidden beneath the form of human flesh… to lure on the prince of this world to a contest; that the Son might offer him his human flesh as a bait and that the divinity which lay underneath might catch him and hold him fast with its hook… then, just as a fish when it seizes a baited hook not only fails to drag off the bait but is itself dragged out of the water to serve as food for others; so he that had the power of death sees the body of Jesus in death, unaware of the hook of divinity which lay hidden inside. Having swallowed it, he was immediately caught. The gates of hell were broken, and he was, as it were, drawn up from the pit, to become food for others.&quot; — &quot;Christian Theology, an Introduction&quot;, Chapter 13, The Doctrine of Salvation in Christ.

==Influence==
Rufinus exerted considerable influence on Western theologians by thus putting the great Greek fathers into the Latin tongue. Dominic Vallarsi&#x27;s uncompleted edition of Rufinus (vol. i. folio. Verona, 1745) contains the &quot;De Benedictionibus&quot;, the &quot;Apologies&quot;, the &quot;Expositio Symboli&quot;, the &quot;Historia Eremitica&quot; and the two original books of the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;. Vallarsi intended to collect the translations in vol. ii., but it was never published. See also Migne, &quot;Patrologia Latina&quot; (vol. xxi). For the translations, see the various editions of Origen, Eusebius, etc.

<text>Laysan (; ) is one of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, located northwest of Honolulu. It has one land mass of , about in size. It is an atoll of sorts, although the land completely surrounds Laysan Lake, some above sea level, that has a salinity approximately three times greater than the ocean. Laysan&#x27;s Hawaiian name, &quot;Kauō&quot;, means &quot;egg&quot;.

It was mined for guano in the late 19th century and early 1900s, which resulted in the release of rabbits who had been brought in for food. After mining ceased, the rabbits ate up the natural vegetation causing a couple dozen plant and one bird species to go extinct. The rabbits were removed by 1923, and from then on until modern times it has been a nature reserve.

The island is the home of the rarest duck in the world, the Laysan Duck.

==Geology==

Laysan is the second largest single landmass in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, after Sand Island at Midway Atoll. Laysan was created by coral growth and geologic upshift. The fringing reefs surrounding the island cover about . The tallest point on the island is above sea level, on a large dune that covers much of the northern portion of the island.

Lake Laysan, a , brown, hypersaline lake in the island&#x27;s interior, has varied in depth over the decades. In the 1860s, the lake was at most deep, but by the 1920s it averaged only in depth, because of the build-up of sand that had been blown into it by sandstorms. The best way to find fresh water on Laysan is to observe where the finches are drinking, because fresh water floats on the saltier water and accumulates around the shore. 

A U.S. Geological Survey study found that Laysan, Midway Atoll, and Pacific islands like them, could become inundated and unfit to live on during the 21st century.


==History==
===Discovery and early expeditions===
Native Hawaiians may have known about Kauō before Americans and Europeans sailed their ships into the region in the early 19th century (see below). The first reported sightings of the island were by Massachusetts-based whalers in the 1820s. &quot;The Nantucket Enquirer&quot; reported a sighting in 1825, which is probably the first reference to the name &quot;Laysan&quot; in print. The whalers were among many who took advantage of the newly discovered whaling grounds off the coast of Japan, making the waters around the Northwest Hawaiian archipelago an increasingly popular commercial route.

A United States government survey of Pacific Ocean geography in 1828 included the earlier whalers&#x27; reports, as well as a sighting of an island fitting Laysan&#x27;s description by a Captain &quot;Brigs&quot;. That might refer to Captain John Briggs of New Bedford, who could have come across the island as early as 1822. Various publications name Captain Stanyukovich, of the Russian ship &quot;Moller&quot;, as the discoverer of Laysan. Although he mapped the island in 1828, and attempted to name it for his ship, he was clearly there after the New Englanders, at least.

In 1857, Captain John Paty, of the &quot;Manuokawai&quot;, annexed Laysan to the Kingdom of Hawaii.

The island had an economic value due to the presence of guano. In 1859, Captain Brooks, of the ship &quot;Gambia&quot;, traveled to the island and wrote that there was guano there, but &quot;not of sufficient quantity to warrant any attempts to get it&quot;. Despite that, in 1890, George D. Freeth and Charles N. Spencer successfully petitioned the Kingdom of Hawaii for permission to mine guano on Laysan and agreed to make royalty payments to the Kingdom. Around were extracted per day. Given that, towards the end of the guano mining era, iron-hulled sailing ships had a capacity of , Laysan produced a shipload every two months.

Working conditions at the guano mine were grueling. In August 1900, Japanese workers mutinied against the American management. The strike action turned to violence because of a language barrier. As a result, there were two deaths and two injuries.

The publicity about Laysan attracted scientists and, in the next decade, many of the island&#x27;s unique species were scientifically examined for the first time. However, the guano mining affected the island&#x27;s ecosystem dramatically. Professor William Alanson Bryan of the Bernice P. Bishop Museum estimated that there were 10 million seabirds on Laysan in 1903 but, eight years later, the estimate was that there were little more than a million. In those eight years, the &quot;Pritchardia&quot; palms that were unique to Laysan, and the island&#x27;s sandalwood trees (&quot;Santalum ellipticum&quot;), both became extinct.

1894 marked the arrival of Laysan&#x27;s most notorious inhabitant, German immigrant Max Schlemmer, who was the superintendent of the guano mining operation. He released domestic rabbits, Belgian hares, English hares and guinea pigs on the island, expecting them to multiply and provide supplies for a future meat-canning business. That had a disastrous effect on Laysan&#x27;s indigenous flora and fauna. 

===Period of extinction===

The rabbits reproduced rapidly, and their appetite soon far exceeded the available vegetation on the island. Complaints about that, and about Japanese poachers of the bird population, led President Theodore Roosevelt to declare the Northwestern Hawaiian chain a bird sanctuary in 1909. Schlemmer continued to allow the Japanese to export bird wings illegally and so was removed from the island. However, without plant cover, much of the soil and sand became loose and blew about in dust storms. By 1918, the rabbits had eaten so much that the remaining vegetation was only enough to sustain 100 of them. Twenty-six plant species had been eradicated, and the Laysan millerbird had become extinct.

In 1923, the Tanager Expedition arrived and achieved its aim of exterminating the last rabbits. The bird population had been reduced to about a tenth of its former size. Three endemic taxa had become extinct, as had numerous other plant species. Two other endemic species, the Laysan duck and the Laysan finch, still survive, but are endangered.

===Recent history===

Like most of the Northwestern Hawaiian islands, Laysan is currently uninhabited. It is protected by the Hawaiian Natural Life Act of 1961 and is under the stewardship of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who have had success in eliminating pests, restoring the island&#x27;s vegetation, and boosting the populations of species considered endangered.

Garbage from passing ships often washes ashore on Laysan. That poses a danger to birds because they can swallow plastic waste, which remains undigested and crowds their stomachs, leaving no room for their normal food. According to observations in her 2006 mission log, Patricia Greene, a NOAA Teacher-at-Sea, found that most of the plastic was of Japanese origin. Additionally, in the 1990s, biologists found that a container of poisonous carbofuran had floated ashore and burst open above the high tide line, creating a &quot;dead zone&quot; in which any living thing was killed.

====Sandbur eradication====
In 1991, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service began an effort to eradicate sandbur, an alien grass, which was first introduced in the 1960s by US Armed Forces personnel. Sandbur crowds out the native bunchgrass, which is habitat for birds. At a cost of almost one million dollars, the sandbur had been almost was completely removed by 2000. With that threat gone, the USFWS hoped to restore Laysan to its condition prior to European discovery.

To replace the native &quot;Pritchardia&quot; palms that had become extinct, the FWS wanted to bring in &quot;Pritchardia remota&quot; from Nihoa, a similar species to Laysan&#x27;s lost fan palm. The next step was to be introducing Nihoa millerbirds, to replace the extinct Laysan millerbirds that are closely related. Those transfers were to accomplish a two-fold goal: to restore Laysan to an ecology similar to its pre-industrial one, and to protect those two species from extinction by maintaining a second population on Laysan. That way, if diseases, fires, or hurricanes obliterate the Nihoa population, the population can be revived by translocation from Laysan.

====&quot;Laysan fever&quot;====
In 1991, several workers on Laysan contracted a feverish illness previously unknown there or anywhere else. It affected workers on Laysan in varying levels of severity: one woman was evacuated for persistent fever, but others exhibited very mild symptoms. Cedric Yoshimoto, of the University of Hawaii at Mānoa School of Public Health, wrote that &quot;surveillance has identified a newly-described illness of humans termed &#x27;Laysan fever (LF)&#x27; It is associated with bites of the seabird tick &quot;Ornithodoros capensis&quot;... [and] joins a short list of human illnesses associated with seabird colonies...&quot; The symptoms of Q fever overlap significantly with those of Laysan fever, and scientists have speculated as to their possible common causes.

==Possible ancient Hawaiian presence==
In 2003, an archaeologist examining sediment cores found pollen from coconut palms deep below the bottom of the central lagoon. That unexpected find raised several questions. Before that, no evidence existed that the coconut ever reached any of the Hawaiian Islands before the arrival of the Polynesian voyagers. Further, there has never been any physical evidence that the ancient Hawaiians extended their exploration of the Hawaiian chain beyond Nihoa and Mokumanamana (Necker). Dating the sediment containing the &quot;Cocos&quot; pollen is imprecise, but appears to have been deposited some time between 5,500 years ago and the arrival of Europeans in Hawaiian waters in the late 18th century. The full length of the core was and is thought to represent a record spanning 7,000 years. Coconut pollen was not found in the deeper (older) part of the core. However, cores from Guam in the western Pacific show the presence of coconut trees there as early as 9,000 years ago, well before human habitation. Hawaiian traditions suggest that the Hawaiians were aware that islands existed to the north-west, and the pollen evidence could be interpreted as proof of early Hawaiian visits to Laysan. More precise dating of the sediment layers will be needed to better interpret the find.

==Distinctive species of Laysan==

Laysan is generally regarded as the &quot;gem&quot; of the NWHI, with the most biodiversity. It is home to the Laysan duck, the rarest duck in the world. The other native land bird of Laysan is the Laysan finch, an opportunistic hunter. Eighteen other bird species nest there and use Lake Laysan, the only lake in the NWHI, as a rest stop or breeding ground. Laysan also has its share of native plants, many of which, such as &quot;Eragrostis variabilis&quot;, were extirpated from Laysan during its &quot;extinction period&quot; and then reintroduced from other leeward islands by scientists. Like most other of the NWHI, Laysan is home to Hawaiian monk seals and green sea turtles.

<text>Friedrich Adolf Ebert (July 9, 1791 – November 13, 1834) was a German bibliographer and librarian.

==Biography==
Ebert was born at Taucha, near Leipzig, the son of a Lutheran pastor.

At the age of fifteen, Friedrich was appointed to a subordinate post in the municipal library of Leipzig. He studied theology for a short time at Leipzig, and afterwards philology at Wittenberg, where he received a PhD in 1812. While still a student in 1811, he had already published a work on public libraries. In 1812, he published another work entitled &quot;Hierarchiae in religionem ac literas commoda&quot;, which roughly translates to &quot;Hierarchy in religion and letters advantages.&quot;

In 1813, he was attached to the Leipzig University library, and in 1814 was appointed secretary to the Royal Library of Dresden. The same year, he published &quot;F. Taubmanns Leben und Verdienste&quot; and in 1819 &quot;Torquato Tasso&quot;, a translation from Pierre Louis Ginguené with annotations.

The rich resources open to him in the Dresden library enabled him to undertake the work on which his reputation chiefly rests, the &quot;Allgemeines bibliographisches Lexikon&quot;, the first volume of which appeared in 1821 and the second in 1830. This was the first work of the kind produced in Germany, and the most scientific published anywhere.

From 1823 to 1825, Ebert was librarian to the Duke of Brunswick at Wolfenbüttel. He returned to Dresden in 1827 and was made chief librarian of the Dresden Royal library. Among his other works are:
*&quot;Die Bildung des Bibliothekars&quot; (1820) (&quot;The Education of the Librarian&quot;) 
*&quot;Geschichte und Beschreibung der königlichen Bibliothek in Dresden&quot; (1822) (&quot;History and Description of the Royal Library in Dresden&quot;) 
*&quot;Zur Handschriftenkunde&quot; (1825–1827)
*&quot;Culturperioden des obersächsischen Mittelalters&quot; (1825) (&quot;Cultural Periods of Medieval Upper Saxony&quot;)
*&quot;A general bibliographical dictionary, Volume 4&quot; (1837)

Ebert was a contributor to various journals and took part in the editing of Ersch and Gruber&#x27;s great encyclopedia. He died in Dresden on November 13, 1834, due to a fall from a ladder in his library.

<doc id="896285" wikidata="Q1783701" url="?curid=896285" title="A Grand Day Out">
<text>A Grand Day Out is a 1989 British stop-motion animated short film and the first installment in the &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot; series. It was directed, animated and co-written by Nick Park at the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield and Aardman Animations in Bristol.

&quot;A Grand Day Out&quot; debuted on 4 November 1989, at an animation festival at the Arnolfini Gallery, Bristol. It was first broadcast on Christmas Eve 1990 on Channel 4. The film received critical acclaim and was followed by 1993&#x27;s &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot;, 1995&#x27;s &quot;A Close Shave&quot;, 2005&#x27;s &quot;The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot;, 2008&#x27;s &quot;A Matter of Loaf and Death&quot;, and 2024&#x27;s &quot;Vengeance Most Fowl&quot;. It was a Best Animated Short Film nominee for the 63rd Academy Awards.

==Plot==

While deciding on where to go on their bank holiday, the cheese-loving inventor Wallace (Peter Sallis) and his dog, Gromit, find their fridge empty. Reasoning that the moon is made of cheese, they build a rocket and fly to the Moon. After landing, they set up a picnic and sample some of the moon&#x27;s rock. They encounter a coin-operated robot; Wallace inserts a coin, but nothing happens. After he and Gromit leave, the robot comes to life and gathers the dirty plates left at the picnic spot.

The robot discovers a skiing magazine, and yearns to travel to Earth to ski there. It repairs a broken piece of landscape, issues a parking ticket for the rocket, and is annoyed by an oil leak from the craft. The robot sneaks up on Wallace and prepares to strike him, but the money Wallace inserted runs out, and it freezes. Wallace takes the robot&#x27;s truncheon as a souvenir, inserts another coin, and prepares to leave with Gromit.

Returning to life, the robot follows Wallace and Gromit. Wallace panics, and he and Gromit retreat into the rocket. Unable to climb the ladder, the robot cuts into the fuselage with a can opener and accidentally ignites some fuel. The explosion throws it off the rocket and Wallace and Gromit lift off. Although initially dejected, the robot fashions twisted and buckled bits of rocket fuselage into skis, and begins skiing over the moon&#x27;s slopes, waving goodbye to Wallace and Gromit as they return home.

==Production==
Nick Park started creating &quot;A Grand Day Out&quot; in 1982 as a graduation project for the National Film and Television School. In 1985, Aardman Animations took him on before he finished the piece, allowing him to work on it part-time while still being funded by the school.

To make the film, Park wrote to William Harbutt&#x27;s company, requesting of Plasticine. The block he received had ten colours, one of which was called &quot;stone&quot;; this was used for Gromit. Park himself had wanted to voice Gromit, but he ultimately realized that the voice he had in mind – that of Peter Hawkins – would have been difficult to animate. Park wrote to Peter Sallis asking him to voice Wallace, and Sallis agreed in return for a donation of £50 to a charity of Sallis&#x27; choice.

Park wanted Wallace to have a Lancashire accent like his own, but Sallis could only do a Yorkshire accent. Inspired by how Sallis drew out the word &quot;cheese&quot;, Park chose to give Wallace large cheeks. When Park called Sallis six years later to explain he had completed his film, Sallis swore in surprise.

Gromit was named after grommets, because Park&#x27;s brother, an electrician, often mentioned them, and Park liked the sound of the word. Wallace was originally a postman named Jerry, but Park felt the name did not pair well with Gromit. Park saw an overweight Labrador Retriever named Wallace belonging to an old woman boarding a bus in Preston. Park commented it was a &quot;funny name, a very northern name to give a dog&quot;.

According to the book &quot;The World of Wallace and Gromit&quot;, Park originally planned the film to be forty minutes long and to spoof &quot;Star Wars&quot; with numerous characters and a fast food restaurant on the Moon. However, he shrank the story when he realized it would take him several more years to complete.

==Home media==
The short film was released on VHS in the 1990s by BBC Video. It was also reissued as a DreamWorks Pictures release along with &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot; and &quot;A Close Shave&quot; on the &quot;Wallace and Gromit in 3 Amazing Adventures&quot; DVD by DreamWorks Home Entertainment on 20 September 2005. In the United States, it was released on DVD on 10 February 2009 by Lionsgate Home Entertainment and HIT Entertainment. In the United Kingdom, it was again released on DVD in the 2000s.

The short was released on Blu-ray by Lionsgate Home Entertainment as part of &quot;Wallace and Gromit: The Complete Collection&quot; on 22 September 2009, in time for the 20th anniversary of the franchise. A remastered version was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray by Shout! Studios on &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Complete Cracking Collection&quot; on 10 December 2024.

==Release==
The short debuted on 4 November 1989 at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol, UK, and debuted in the United States on 18 May 1990. It was also shown on Channel 4 on 24 December 1990 in the UK. It aired on BBC Two on 25 December 1993 to promote &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot;.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;A Grand Day Out&quot; has a  approval rating based on reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. It won the inaugural Best Short Animation award at the 43rd BAFTAs in 1990 and was nominated for Best Animated Short Film at the 63rd Academy Awards in 1991. &quot;Creature Comforts&quot;, another Park short, was also nominated for both awards and beat &quot;A Grand Day Out&quot; for the Academy Award.

<text>Seitseminen National Park () is located in the municipalities of Ikaalinen and Ylöjärvi in Finland. The national park was established in 1982 and later expanded in 1989. It now covers . The park is a typical mix of upland and lowland coniferous boreal forests of the Suomenselkä watershed region. Upland areas are dominated by closed productive stands of Norway spruce and Scots pine while lowland areas are covered by sphagnum swamp and bog areas that also contain stunted (Scots pine) and shrublike (Norway spruce). These swamp and bog areas appear to be barren due to the sparse tree densities. Parts of the park contain some of the most ancient and oldest forests that are accessible to public in Finland.

The Kovero Farm (), a tenant farm established in 1859, is part of the cultural heritage area of the park.

Seitseminen National Park received the European Diploma of Protected Areas on 19 June 1996. It was valid until June 2011.

==Fauna==
The mires – that cover more than half of the park&#x27;s area – are inhabited by black grouses, common cranes, whooper swans, wood sandpipers and northern willow grouses. The old-growth forests house hole nesters such as Eurasian pygmy owls, Ural owls, three-toed woodpeckers, red-breasted flycatchers and the Siberian flying squirrel. The emblem species and the most common species in the park is the pine marten.

<doc id="896294" wikidata="Q309979" url="?curid=896294" title="Paul Greengard">
<text>Paul Greengard (December 11, 1925 – April 13, 2019) was an American neuroscientist best known for his work on the molecular and cellular function of neurons. In 2000, Greengard, Arvid Carlsson and Eric Kandel were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning signal transduction in the nervous system. He was Vincent Astor Professor at Rockefeller University, and served on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Cure Alzheimer&#x27;s Fund, as well as the Scientific Council of the Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation. He was married to artist Ursula von Rydingsvard.

==Biography==
Greengard was born in New York City, the son of Pearl (née Meister) and Benjamin Greengard, a vaudeville comedian. His older sister was actress Irene Kane, who later became a writer by the name of Chris Chase; she died in 2013, aged 89. Their mother died in childbirth and their father remarried in 1927. The Greengard siblings&#x27; parents were Jewish, but their stepmother was Episcopalian. He and his sister were &quot;brought up in the Christian tradition&quot;.

During World War II, he served in the United States Navy as an electronics technician at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology working on an early warning system against Japanese kamikaze planes. After World War II, he attended Hamilton College where he graduated in 1948 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics and physics. He decided against graduate school in physics because most post-war physics research was focusing on nuclear weapons, and instead became interested in biophysics.

Greengard began his graduate studies at Johns Hopkins University in the lab of Haldan Keffer Hartline. Inspired by a lecture by Alan Hodgkin, Greengard began work on the molecular and cellular function of neurons. He received his PhD in 1953 and began postdoctoral work at the University of London, Cambridge University, and the University of Amsterdam. Greengard then became director of the Department of Biochemistry at the Geigy Research Laboratories.

After leaving Geigy in 1967, he worked briefly at Yeshiva University&#x27;s Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Vanderbilt University before taking a position as Professor in the Department of Pharmacology at Yale University. In 1983 he joined the faculty of The Rockefeller University. Greengard was a member of the Board of Scientific Governors at The Scripps Research Institute. He was the acting chairman of the Fisher Center for Alzheimer&#x27;s Research Foundation and served on the board of the Michael Stern Parkinson&#x27;s Research Foundation, which later merged with The Michael J. Fox Foundation. Both internationally renowned foundations support the research conducted in the Greengard laboratory at The Rockefeller University.

He died on April 13, 2019.

==Research==
Greengard&#x27;s research focused on events inside the neuron caused by neurotransmitters. Specifically, Greengard and his fellow researchers studied the behavior of second messenger cascades that transform the docking of a neurotransmitter with a receptor into permanent changes in the neuron. In a series of experiments, Greengard and his colleagues showed that when dopamine interacts with a receptor on the cell membrane of a neuron, it causes an increase in cyclic AMP inside the cell. This increase of cyclic AMP, in turn activates a protein called protein kinase A, which turns other proteins on or off by adding phosphate groups in a reaction known as phosphorylation. The proteins activated by phosphorylation can then perform a number of changes in the cell: transcribing DNA to make new proteins, moving more receptors to the synapse (and thus increasing the neuron&#x27;s sensitivity), or moving ion channels to the cell surface (and thus increasing the cell&#x27;s excitability). He shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Arvid Carlsson and Eric Kandel for his work on the central regulatory protein DARPP-32.

==Family==
Greengard had two sons from his first marriage, Claude and Leslie. Claude Greengard holds a PhD in mathematics from UC Berkeley, and is the Founder of Foss Hill Partners. Leslie holds an MD from the Yale School of Medicine and a PhD in computer science from Yale University, and is a professor of mathematics and computer science at and former director of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU, a winner of the Steele Prize for a seminal contribution to research, a recipient of both a Packard Foundation Fellowship and an NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award, and a member of both the U.S. National Academy of Engineering and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. 

In 1985, Greengard married sculptor Ursula von Rydingsvard.

==Discrimination complaints==
In February 2018, a federal jury in the Southern District of New York found The Rockefeller University liable for discrimination based on race and national origin that occurred in 2007 in the lab of, and under the supervision of, Greengard.

==Pearl Meister Greengard Prize==
Paul Greengard used his Nobel Prize honorarium to help fund the Pearl Meister Greengard Prize, an award for women scientists. The award is named after his mother, who died during childbirth. It was established in 2004 to shine a spotlight on exceptional women in science, since, as Greengard observed, &quot;[women] are not yet receiving awards and honors at a level commensurate with their achievements.&quot; The annual prize is awarded to an outstanding woman conducting biomedical research.

<doc id="896326" wikidata="Q1759977" url="?curid=896326" title="Revelation Space">
<text>Revelation Space is a 2000 science fiction novel by Welsh author Alastair Reynolds. It was the first novel (but not first published work of fiction) set in Reynolds&#x27;s eponymous universe. The novel reflects Reynolds&#x27;s professional background: he has a PhD in astronomy and worked for many years for the European Space Agency. It was short listed for the 2000 BSFA and Arthur C. Clarke Awards.

==Summary==
&quot;Revelation Space&quot; begins with three seemingly unrelated narrative strands that merge as the novel progresses. This plot structure is characteristic of many of Reynolds&#x27;s works.

The first strand centres around Dan Sylveste, beginning in the year 2551. Sylveste is an archaeologist excavating the remains of the long-dead Amarantin race that lived on a planet in the Delta Pavonis system. Over the course of decades, Sylveste learns that the Amarantin may have become technologically sophisticated before their sun destroyed life on the planet Resurgam nearly a million years prior.

The next strand centres around Ilia Volyova aboard the &quot;Nostalgia for Infinity&quot;, a large ship capable of interstellar travel. Volyova and the other members of her skeleton crew wish to find Sylveste because they believe he can help them with their captain, who has been infected with the Melding Plague, a nanotech virus that attacks human cells and machine implants to pervert them into grotesque combinations.

The third strand focuses on Ana Khouri, an assassin living on the planet Yellowstone (in the Epsilon Eridani system). Khouri is hired by a mysterious figure known as the Mademoiselle to assassinate Sylveste.

With help from the Mademoiselle, Khouri infiltrates the crew of the &quot;Nostalgia for Infinity&quot; as it reaches orbit around Yellowstone, knowing that they will then travel to Resurgam. The &quot;Nostalgia for Infinity&quot; arrives in orbit around Resurgam in 2566. Desperate to secure Sylveste&#x27;s expertise to help cure her captain, Volyova and the other two members of the ship&#x27;s ruling triumvirate (Sajaki and Hegazi) threaten the defenceless Resurgam civilisation, prompting its rulers to turn Sylveste over to them.

Once aboard, however, Sylveste informs the triumvirs that he has antimatter bombs hidden inside the implants in his artificial eyes that could destroy the &quot;Nostalgia for Infinity&quot;. He then agrees to attempt to cure their captain in exchange for a trip to Cerberus, a mysterious nearby planet orbiting a neutron star that he believes holds the secret to the truth of Amarantin civilisation. They soon discover that Cerberus is actually a massive beacon aimed at alerting a machine sentience of the appearance of new star-faring cultures so that it can destroy them. It is that sentience, Sylveste belatedly realises, that caused the demise of the Amarantin.

==Publication history==
This was Alastair Reynolds&#x27;s first published novel, and was published in a relatively small initial print run in the United Kingdom. It subsequently became a collectible first edition.

==Reception==
Thomas M. Wagner of SF Reviews wrote that &quot;despite my disappointment, images and bits and pieces of the novel simply would not get out of my head. This is saying something, since, with the volume of SF and fantasy I read, I do not exactly retain an eidetic memory of everything I&#x27;ve read that I can call up in a second or two unless the book literally bowled me over. But in the case of &quot;Revelation Space&quot;, two and three years later I still could remember the opening scene in the archaeological dig on the lonely planet of Resurgam with remarkable clarity. The dark, eerie corridors of the vast starship &quot;Nostalgia for Infinity&quot; still brought haunting images to mind.&quot;

A Dragonsworn review notes &quot;there&#x27;s plenty of beautifully scripted action sequences, and gorgeous descriptions—especially where the &quot;Nostalgia for Infinity&quot; is concerned. Reynolds paints a vivid picture of a haunting machine in decline, and a crew that may as well be ghosts.&quot; while observing the lack of character development.

The &quot;Revelation Space&quot; Trilogy was listed in Damien Broderick&#x27;s book &quot;Science Fiction: The 101 Best Novels 1985-2010&quot;.

<text>Chasm City is a 2001 science fiction novel by British writer Alastair Reynolds, set in the &quot;Revelation Space&quot; universe. It deals with themes of identity, memory, and immortality, and many of its scenes are concerned primarily with describing the unusual societal and physical structure of the titular city, a major nexus of Reynolds&#x27;s universe. It won the 2002 British Science Fiction Association award.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Chasm City&quot; is framed and largely written in the voice of Tanner Mirabel, a security expert who has come to Chasm City to avenge the death of his former client&#x27;s wife at the hands of a &quot;postmortal&quot; noble named Argent Reivich.

Tanner arrives to find that Yellowstone, the most advanced civilization in human history, has descended into squalor; an alien nanotech virus known as the Melding Plague has wreaked havoc throughout the system. Chasm City, a dense forest of mile-high shapeshifting skyscrapers, has melted into a slum. The Glitter Band, a sparkling diorama of ten thousand orbital habitats, has been reduced to a &quot;Rust Belt&quot; of a few hundred survivors, mostly primitive and pre-nanotech antiques.

In this chaos of plague and desolation, Tanner seeks his prey, only to discover that Reivich is more clever than he originally thought. In the midst of his hunt, he begins experiencing virus-induced flashbacks from the life of Sky Haussmann, the founder of his home world, Sky&#x27;s Edge, who is both revered and reviled for the crimes he committed for his people.

From the depths of the gas plume at the heart of Chasm City, to the aristocratic canopy spanning what remains of the skyscrapers, Mirabel begins to unravel the mystery of the Melding Plague.

==Awards and nominations==
&quot;Chasm City&quot; won the 2002 British Science Fiction Association award.

<doc id="896333" wikidata="Q661708" url="?curid=896333" title="Lisianski Island">
<text>Lisianski Island (Hawaiian: &quot;Papa‘āpoho&quot;) is one of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, with a land area of and a maximum elevation of above sea level. It is a low, flat sand and coral island about northwest of Honolulu, Hawaii. The island is surrounded by reefs and shoals, including the extensive Neva Shoals. Access to the island is possible only by helicopter or by boat via a narrow sandy inlet on the southeastern side of the island.

==Administration==

Politically, Lisianski Island is part of the City and County of Honolulu in the State of Hawaii. However, as part of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, it is administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. It has no resident human population.

==Geology and topography==
Lisianski Island is made of limestone that caps the submerged summit of an extinct shield volcano that was active about 20 million years ago. Lisianski Island is undergoing the slow process of erosion, and features a depression between two tall sand dunes, that is thought to once have been a lagoon like the one on Laysan, its nearest neighbor. For this reason, the island&#x27;s selected Hawaiian name, &quot;Papa‘āpoho&quot;, means &quot;island with a depression&quot;. Over three-quarters of the Bonin petrels that nest in Hawaii nest here. Recent discovery of subfossils on the island indicate that Laysan duck populations once occurred on the island, possibly inhabiting the former lagoon.

==History==

Lisianski Island is named after Yuri Lisyansky, a Russian Imperial explorer and an officer in the Imperial Russian Navy. Lisyansky was the commanding officer of the Russian-American Company&#x27;s merchant sloop &quot;Neva&quot;, which was on an exploration mission as part of the first Russian circumnavigation of the world when she ran aground on the island in 1805. Lisyansky reported the island to be of little interest, except insofar as its surrounding reefs and shoals posed a threat to passing vessels.

King Kamehameha IV claimed the island for the Kingdom of Hawaii on 10 May 1857. In 1890, the North Pacific Phosphate and Fertilizer Company acquired a twenty-year lease on the island from the Kingdom of Hawaii.

After the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1893, Lisianski Island became part of the Republic of Hawaii in 1894. On August 12, 1898, the United States annexed Hawaii, including Lisianski Island, and Lisianski Island was included in the Territory of Hawaii upon its creation on April 30, 1900. In 1909, Lisianski Island became part of the new Hawaiian Islands Bird Reservation — which later became the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge — established by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. Prior to this, there had been concern about the poaching of birds on the island.

When Hawaii became a U.S. state in August 1959, Lisianski Island became part of the new State of Hawaii. On June 15, 2006, it was included in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument.

==Neva Shoals==
Neva Shoals is a shallow reef directly southeast of Lisianski Island covering , more than half the size of Oahu. Lisiansky named Neva Shoals after his ship, &quot;Neva&quot;. The shoal is shallow and makes access to the island difficult. The reef has been described by divers as a &quot;coral garden&quot;  because of the great variety of coral. Twenty-four types of coral have been identified at the reefs surrounding Lisianski. Reef fish are abundant, including predators.

<doc id="896334" wikidata="Q2738660" url="?curid=896334" title="Diary (novel)">
<text>Diary is a 2003 novel by Chuck Palahniuk. The book is written like a diary. Its protagonist is Misty Wilmot, a once-promising young artist who works as a waitress in a hotel. Her husband, a contractor, is in a coma after a suicide attempt. According to the description on the back of &quot;Diary&quot;, Misty &quot;soon finds herself a pawn in a larger conspiracy that threatens to cost hundreds of lives.&quot;

&quot;Diary&quot; is an example of the modern horror genre, employing psychological elements and dark humor.

The audio version of &quot;Diary&quot; is narrated by actress Martha Plimpton.

==Plot summary==

As a &quot;coma diary&quot;, the reader learns of Misty Marie Wilmot as her husband lies senseless in a hospital after a suicide attempt. The story is not exactly told by Misty but through a second-person perspective. Once she was an art student, dreaming of creativity and freedom, but after marrying Peter while they were both still at school and then giving birth to their daughter shortly after, she is eventually brought back to Waytansea Island. It was once quaint, but it has become overrun with tourists. Misty has been reduced to the lowly condition of a mere waitress within a common resort hotel. Peter, before falling into his coma, was building hidden rooms within the houses he was remodeling and scrawling vile messages all over the walls; this is an old habit of builders but it was dramatically overdone in Peter&#x27;s case. Angry homeowners are suing Misty, and her dreams of artistic greatness have been ruined. But then, as if she was possessed by the spirit of the fabled Waytansea artist Maura Kincaid, Misty begins painting again, excessively and compulsively.

Misty discovers that the islanders, including her father-in-law (previously thought to be dead) are involved in a conspiracy which repeats every four generations. A young artist (in this case Misty) is lured to the island by an old piece of jewelry, she becomes pregnant and has her child within the community. It is implied that this old jewelry works to lure and entrap Misty because it was hers in a past life, during which these same events occur again. During middle age, her husband dies, followed by all her children, resulting in a wave of great artistic creativity, the product of which is mesmerizing to the observing audience. 

The islanders create an exhibition of Misty&#x27;s art work at the local hotel where a fire is started by Misty&#x27;s daughter, who is revealed to be alive after a previous point in the book when she was thought to have drowned, and all the hotel&#x27;s occupants are burned to death due to their being mesmerized by her painting. The result is a huge insurance claim which leaves the remaining island citizens wealthy enough to support their luxurious lifestyles for the next four generations, at which point a new young artist will be found to repeat the cycle. Peter attempted to warn her of this plot using his hidden writing, and it is revealed that his suicide attempt was in fact a murder attempt. It is never revealed whether Peter recovered from his coma, but from Misty&#x27;s descriptions of his state of health, he more than likely died.

==Characters==
The names of the main characters are taken from fans&#x27; names selected at random in an official contest held by &quot;The Cult&quot; on the ChuckPalaniuk.net website prior to publication.

; Misty Marie Wilmot : The protagonist. Her maiden name is Kleinman. Misty was raised in a trailer park in Tecumseh Lake, Georgia by her hippie mother. She is an aspiring artist and attends art school where she eventually meets and begins going out with Peter Wilmot. Peter does everything in his power to get her pregnant, and they eventually go live with his family on Waytansea Island after his father, Harrow Wilmot, dies. Misty puts off her artistic aspirations to raise Tabitha. Misty eventually discovers that she is the reincarnation of past artists, including Maura Kincaid and Constance Burton.
; Peter Wilmot : After moving back to Waytansea Island, Peter takes up the job of contractor. He is found in the family car by Misty, supposedly having attempted suicide. It eventually turns out that he was the victim of attempted murder by his own father, whom Misty had thought was dead and who was trying to stop him from spoiling the islanders&#x27; plan to use Misty&#x27;s artwork to get rich. The murder attempt was a failure, and Peter now lies comatose in a hospital bed.
; Tabitha Wilmot : Referred to throughout most of the book as Tabbi, Tabitha is the daughter of Misty and Peter. She plays the part of a loving child throughout most of the story, eventually faking her death so as to cause her mother emotional pain which would help Misty to create art. After it is revealed to Misty that Tabitha is still alive, she learns that Tabitha smokes, flirts with boys, and is not as loving, sweet, or innocent a child as she&#x27;d previously thought.
; Grace Wilmot : Grace is the mother of Peter and &quot;Granmy&quot; to Tabitha. Misty is often annoyed by her, whether it&#x27;s the way she wastes Misty&#x27;s money, or the way she&#x27;s influencing Tabitha. Grace is often found with a diary, which it turns out is not of Grace&#x27;s writings, but rather that of a dead artist from a century back by the name of Constance Burton. Grace eventually dies in a fire in the hotel along with more than a hundred other persons on the night of the unveiling of Misty&#x27;s artwork.
; Harrow Wilmot : Referred to most often by the nickname Harry, Harrow was the father of Peter and husband of Grace. Misty uses him to judge in advance what Peter will eventually look like. Although Misty loved him, throughout most of the book, Misty believes he is dead, as that is what Peter, Grace, and the doctor have all told her (despite none of them telling her the same thing as his cause-of-death). Toward the end of the book, it is discovered that Harrow is actually alive, and that his death has been faked. But he dies not long after, along with Grace in the burning hotel.
; Angel Delaporte : Angel is a wealthy man who comes to live on the island. He is quite interested in graphology, and he and Misty go around to the various houses in which Peter has done construction work to see what sort of messages Peter has painted on the walls of these houses. It is eventually revealed that Peter was actually bisexual and in love with Angel. Angel is killed by the island-folk, stabbed to death by Harry while he slept.
; Detective Clark Stilton : Stilton is the only member of the Seaview County Hate Crimes Task Force. He is investigating the acts of an anti-tourist terrorist group known as the Ocean Alliance for Freedom (OAFF). He arrests Misty under suspicion of murder and arson. That night, he dies in the hotel fire.
; Daniel Touchet, M.D. : Dr. Touchet (pron: &quot;tü-ˈshā&quot;) is the main, if not only, doctor on the island. He has delivered most of the younger residents of the island, including Peter, Tabitha, Paulette Hyland (then Paulette Petersen), Will Tupper, Matt Hyland, and Brett Petersen. He also prepares the bodies of the dead for funeral, and performs cremations. When Misty has a migraine, she goes to Dr. Touchet, who tells her about the Jain Buddhists, the Essene Jews, and the early Christians, and gives her some capsules which he claims contain &quot;green algae mostly, some white willow bark, [and] a little bee pollen.&quot; When Misty trips, the doctor tells her she has injured her knee and that she must stay in her room for three weeks, affording her the opportunity to paint. When Angel tries to help her escape, he tells her he had the pill tested, and that it contained powdered lead with trace amounts of arsenic and mercury, each of which are traditional ingredients in artistry paints linked to accidental self-poisoning.

===Other characters===
; Mrs. Burton, Mrs. Seymour, and Mrs. Perry : These three islanders are referred to in Misty&#x27;s diary as &quot;local sea turtles.&quot;
; Raymon : A busboy at the hotel.
; Maura Kincaid and Constance Burton : Two dead artists, both female, who had come to live on Waytansea Island in much the same manner as Misty. The islanders believe that Misty is the reincarnation of these artists, as well as others, and Misty herself comes to believe this. Both Maura and Constance have left clues around the island for their future incarnations, including little messages written in the island&#x27;s library books.
; Mrs. Terrymore : The old librarian, who diligently erases messages from Maura and Constance when she finds them in the books.
; Paulette Hyland : The desk clerk at the hotel, whose maiden name is Petersen.
; Will Tupper : A friend of Peter who now is bald and runs the ferryboat between the island and the mainland. Back in college, he had blonde hair, and had ripped an earring from his ear to give to Misty. He still has scar-tissue from this incident.
; The Ocean Alliance for Freedom : OAFF for short, this was the name Harrow (and possibly other islanders) gave himself when he committed murder and arson so that the police would suspect the murders and arsonry were the act of militant radical leftists, rather than an act of conspiracy with the whole island. Stilton, a member of the Seaview County Hate Crimes Task Force, is brought onto the case as it is noticed that OAFF only attacks mainlanders. On page 155, Stilton says &quot;The white supremacy movement and the Green Party have connections going way back. It&#x27;s not a long stretch from protecting nature to preserving racial purity.&quot;
; Nora Adams : Nora appears on the last page of the book in a letter form. Towards the end of the book, Misty states that she and Tabbi will change their names (hence the Nora Adams) and move to Tecumseh Lake, GA. The address where the letter is sent is from Tecumseh, GA.

==Cover==
The dust jacket of the first edition of &quot;Diary&quot; contains a hidden printed message. The inside of the jacket is printed black, with white letters printed vertically across the jacket from bottom to top, in the same style of writing as the title on the cover. They read &quot;WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR INSPIRATION?&quot;

<text>The Västerbotten Regiment (), designations I 19, I XIX, I 20 and I 20/Fo 61, was a Swedish Army infantry regiment that traced its origins back to the 16th century. The regiment&#x27;s soldiers were originally recruited from the province of Västerbotten, where it was later garrisoned. The unit was disbanded as a result of the disarmament policies set forward in the Defence Act of 2000.

== History ==
The regiment has its origins in fänikor (companies) raised in Västerbotten in the 1550s and 1560s. In 1615, these units—along with fänikor from the nearby provinces of Ångermanland, Medelpad, Hälsingland and Gästrikland—were organised by Gustav II Adolf into Norrlands storregemente, of which seven of the total 24 companies were recruited in Västerbotten. Norrlands storregemente consisted of three field regiments, of which Västerbotten Regiment was one. Sometime around 1624, the grand regiment was permanently split into three smaller regiments, of which Västerbotten Regiment was one.

Västerbotten Regiment was one of the original 20 Swedish infantry regiments mentioned in the Swedish constitution of 1634. The regiment was allotted in 1696. It changed name to Västerbotten Ranger Regiment in 1829, and was split into two corps units of battalion size in 1841, one of them being Västerbotten Ranger Corps, the other being Norrbotten Ranger Corps. The unit was upgraded to regimental size and renamed back to Västerbotten Regiment in 1892. The regiment had its training grounds at various places in Västerbotten, but was eventually garrisoned in Umeå in 1909.

The regiment was given the designation I 19 (19th Infantry Regiment) in a general order in 1816, but that designation was given to Norrbotten Ranger Corps when the unit split, and Västerbotten Ranger Corps was instead given the designation I XIX (XIXth Infantry Regiment, XIX which in the Roman numeral system equals 19). When the unit regained its old name and size in 1892, the designation was changed to I 20 (20th Infantry Regiment).

==Heraldry and traditions==

===Colours, standards and guidons===
The regiment has presented several colours. On 20 June 1952, the regiment was presented with its last colour by His Majesty King Gustaf VI Adolf in Umeå. It then replaced the 1902 colour. The new one was used as regimental colour until 1 July 2000. The colour is drawn by Sven Sköld. It has not been possible to discover who has manufactured the colour. It was embroidered by hand in insertion technique. Blazon: &quot;On white cloth the provincial badge of Lappland; a red savage with green garlands of birch leaves around head and loins, a yellow club on the right shoulder. On a red border at the upper side of the colour, battle honours (Landskrona 1677, Düna 1701, Kliszów 1702, Fraustadt 1706, Malatitze 1708, Strömstad 1717) in white.&quot;

===Coat of arms===
The coat of the arms of the Västerbotten Regiment (I 20/Fo 61) 1977–1994 and the Lapland Brigade (&#x27;, NB 20) 1994–1997. Blazon: &quot;Argent, the provincial badge of Lapland, a savage gules, garlands of birch leaves vert around head and loins, holding a club or on his right shoulder. The shield surmounted two muskets in saltire or.&quot; The coat of arms of the Västerbotten Regiment (I 20/Fo 61) 1994–2000 and the Västerbotten Group (&#x27;) since 2000. Blazon: &quot;Argent, the provincial badge of Lapland, a savage gules, gar-lands of birch leaves vert around head and loins, holding a club or on his right shoulder. The shield surmounted two swords in saltire or.&quot;

===Medals===
In 2000, the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Västerbotten Regiment (I 20) Commemorative Medal&quot;) in silver (VbottenregSMM) of the 8th size was established. The medal ribbon is divided in white, red and white moiré.

===Heritage===
After the regiment was disbanded on 30 June 2000, the colour and the regiment&#x27;s traditions was passed on to Västerbotten Group (&quot;&quot;). From 1 July 2013, the traditions of the regiment will be kept by the Västerbotten Battalion, included in the Västerbotten Group.

===Other===
The regiment had several anniversaries, but the 3 February, however, was the one that was celebrated the longest, which commemorated the Battle of Fraustadt. Furthermore, anniversaries were held on 28 June, 4 July, 5 July, 8 July, 9 July, 14 July, 23 August, 31 August and 8 October. These were anniversaries of battles that which the regiment participated in. The 8 October, was the anniversary of the last united Swedish-Finnish army division&#x27;s dissolution in Umeå in 1809.

The history of the &#x27; (&quot;Lieutenant Colonel&#x27;s Company&quot;) continues today through &#x27; (&quot;Royal Västerbotten Regiment&quot;), a historical reenactment of the Association of Interactive History (&quot;&quot;) in Sävar, seeking to revive the last battle on Swedish soil, as part of the Year 1809.

<doc id="896352" wikidata="Q1213076" url="?curid=896352" title="The Global Trap">
<text>Die Globalisierungsfalle: Der Angriff auf Demokratie und Wohlstand is a 1996 non-fiction book by Hans-Peter Martin (born 1957 in Bregenz, Austria), and Harald Schumann (born 1957 in Kassel, Germany), that describes possible implications of current trends in globalization. It was published in English as The Global Trap: Globalization and the Assault on Democracy and Prosperity in 1997. At this time, both authors were editors of the news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;. From 1999 to 2014, Hans-Peter Martin, who is stated in the book to be one of just three journalists to be allowed to take part in all activities at the Fairmont convention, was a member of the European Parliament.

The book was a best-seller in the authors‘ native Austria and Germany and went on to be a worldwide bestseller with over 800,000 copies sold and translated into 27 languages.

In particular, the book is known for defining a possible &quot;20/80 society&quot;. In this possible society of the 21st century, 20 percent of the working age population will be enough to keep the world economy going. The other 80 percent live on some form of welfare and are entertained with a concept called &quot;&quot;, which aims at keeping the 80 percent of frustrated citizens happy with a mixture of deadeningly predictable, entertainment for the soul and nourishment for the body.

==Contents==

The book deals mainly with the effects of globalization. It describes a growing social divide as a result of &quot;delimitation&quot; of the economy and a loss of political control by the state over the economic development, which is increasingly controlled by global corporations. The authors warn of a so-called &quot;20-to-80-society&quot;. They describe how a global 80:20 distribution already exists in many aspects, and illustrate possible economic, social and political consequences of free trade and deregulated financial markets.

In the beginning, they describe how at a conference at the invitation of Mikhail Gorbachev with 500 leading politicians, business leaders and academics from all continents from September 27 - October 1, 1995 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, the term &quot;one-fifth-society&quot; arose. The authors describe an increase in productivity caused by the decrease in the amount of work, so this could be done by one-fifth of the global labor force and leave four-fifths of the working age people out of work. The authors predict huge number of unemployed, perhaps finding themselves in low-paid voluntary community services to boost their morale.

<doc id="896356" wikidata="Q1364527" url="?curid=896356" title="Magnetic storage">
<text>Magnetic storage or magnetic recording is the storage of data on a magnetized medium. Magnetic storage uses different patterns of magnetisation in a magnetizable material to store data and is a form of non-volatile memory. The information is accessed using one or more read/write heads.

Magnetic storage media, primarily hard disks, are widely used to store computer data as well as audio and video signals. In the field of computing, the term &quot;magnetic storage&quot; is preferred and in the field of audio and video production, the term &quot;magnetic recording&quot; is more commonly used. The distinction is less technical and more a matter of preference. Other examples of magnetic storage media include floppy disks, magnetic tape, and magnetic stripes on credit cards.

== History ==

Magnetic storage in the form of wire recording—audio recording on a wire—was publicized by Oberlin Smith in the Sept 8, 1888 issue of &quot;Electrical World&quot;. Smith had previously filed a patent in September, 1878 but found no opportunity to pursue the idea as his business was machine tools. The first publicly demonstrated (Paris Exposition of 1900) magnetic recorder was invented by Valdemar Poulsen in 1898. Poulsen&#x27;s device recorded a signal on a wire wrapped around a drum. In 1928, Fritz Pfleumer developed the first magnetic tape recorder. Early magnetic storage devices were designed to record analog audio signals. Computers and now most audio and video magnetic storage devices record digital data.

In computers, magnetic storage was also used for primary storage in a form of magnetic drum, or core memory, core rope memory, thin film memory, twistor memory or bubble memory. Unlike modern computers, magnetic tape was also often used for secondary storage.

== Design ==

Information is written to and read from the storage medium as it moves past devices called read-and-write heads that operate very close (often tens of nanometers) over the magnetic surface. The read-and-write head is used to detect and modify the magnetisation of the material immediately under it. There are two magnetic polarities, each of which is used to represent either 0 or 1.

The magnetic surface is conceptually divided into many small sub-micrometer-sized magnetic regions, referred to as magnetic domains, (although these are not magnetic domains in a rigorous physical sense), each of which has a mostly uniform magnetisation. Due to the polycrystalline nature of the magnetic material, each of these magnetic regions is composed of a few hundred magnetic grains. Magnetic grains are typically 10 nm in size and each form a single true magnetic domain. Each magnetic region in total forms a magnetic dipole which generates a magnetic field. In older hard disk drive (HDD) designs the regions were oriented horizontally and parallel to the disk surface, but beginning about 2005, the orientation was changed to perpendicular to allow for closer magnetic domain spacing.

Older hard disk drives used iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) as the magnetic material, but current disks use a cobalt-based alloy.

For reliable storage of data, the recording material needs to resist self-demagnetisation, which occurs when the magnetic domains repel each other. Magnetic domains written too close together in a weakly magnetisable material will degrade over time due to rotation of the magnetic moment of one or more domains to cancel out these forces. The domains rotate sideways to a halfway position that weakens the readability of the domain and relieves the magnetic stresses.

A write head magnetises a region by generating a strong local magnetic field, and a read head detects the magnetisation of the regions. Early HDDs used an electromagnet both to magnetise the region and to then read its magnetic field by using electromagnetic induction. Later versions of inductive heads included Metal In Gap (MIG) heads and thin film heads. As data density increased, read heads using magnetoresistance (MR) came into use; the electrical resistance of the head changed according to the strength of the magnetism from the platter. Later development made use of spintronics; in read heads, the magnetoresistive effect was much greater than in earlier types, and was dubbed &quot;giant&quot; magnetoresistance (GMR). In today&#x27;s heads, the read and write elements are separate, but in close proximity, on the head portion of an actuator arm. The read element is typically magneto-resistive while the write element is typically thin-film inductive.

The heads are kept from contacting the platter surface by the air that is extremely close to the platter; that air moves at or near the platter speed. The record and playback head are mounted on a block called a slider, and the surface next to the platter is shaped to keep it just barely out of contact. This forms a type of air bearing.

== Magnetic recording classes ==
=== Analog recording ===
Analog recording is based on the fact that remnant magnetisation of a given material depends on the magnitude of the applied field. The magnetic material is normally in the form of tape, with the tape in its blank form being initially demagnetised. When recording, the tape runs at a constant speed. The writing head magnetises the tape with current proportional to the signal. A magnetisation distribution is achieved along the magnetic tape. Finally, the distribution of the magnetisation can be read out, reproducing the original signal. The magnetic tape is typically made by embedding magnetic particles (approximately 0.5 micrometers in size) in a plastic binder on polyester film tape. The most commonly-used of these was ferric oxide, though chromium dioxide, cobalt, and later pure metal particles were also used. Analog recording was the most popular method of audio and video recording. Since the late 1990s, however, tape recording has declined in popularity due to digital recording.

=== Digital recording ===
Instead of creating a magnetisation distribution in analog recording, digital recording only needs two stable magnetic states, which are the +Ms and −Ms on the hysteresis loop. Examples of digital recording are floppy disks, hard disk drives (HDDs), and tape drives. HDDs offer large capacities at reasonable prices; , consumer-grade HDDs offer data storage at about per terabyte.

=== Magneto-optical recording ===
Magneto-optical recording writes/reads optically. When writing, the magnetic medium is heated locally by a laser, which induces a rapid decrease of coercive field. Then, a small magnetic field can be used to switch the magnetisation. The reading process is based on magneto-optical Kerr effect. The magnetic medium are typically amorphous R-Fe-Co thin film (R being a rare earth element). Magneto-optical recording is not very popular. One famous example is Minidisc developed by Sony.

=== Domain propagation memory ===
Domain propagation memory is also called bubble memory. The basic idea is to control domain wall motion in a magnetic medium that is free of microstructure. Bubble refers to a stable cylindrical domain. Data is then recorded by the presence/absence of a bubble domain. Domain propagation memory has high insensitivity to shock and vibration, so its application is usually in space and aeronautics.

== Technical details ==
=== Access method ===
Magnetic storage media can be classified as either sequential access memory or random access memory, although in some cases the distinction is not perfectly clear. The access time can be defined as the average time needed to gain access to stored records. In the case of magnetic wire, the read/write head only covers a very small part of the recording surface at any given time. Accessing different parts of the wire involves winding the wire forward or backward until the point of interest is found. The time to access this point depends on how far away it is from the starting point. The case of ferrite-core memory is the opposite. Every core location is immediately accessible at any given time.

Hard disks and modern linear serpentine tape drives do not precisely fit into either category. Both have many parallel tracks across the width of the media and the read/write heads take time to switch between tracks and to scan within tracks. Different spots on the storage media take different amounts of time to access. For a hard disk this time is typically less than 10 ms, but tapes might take as much as 100 s.

== Coding schemes ==
Magnetic disk heads and magnetic tape heads cannot pass DC (direct current), so the coding schemes for both tape and disk data are designed to minimize the DC offset. Most magnetic storage devices use error correction.

Many magnetic disks internally use some form of run-length limited coding and partial-response maximum-likelihood.

==Current usage==
, common uses of magnetic storage media are for computer data mass storage on hard disks and the recording of analog audio and video works on analog tape. Since much of audio and video production is moving to digital systems, the usage of hard disks is expected to increase at the expense of analog tape. Digital tape and tape libraries are popular for the high capacity data storage of archives and backups. Floppy disks see some marginal usage, particularly in dealing with older computer systems and software. Magnetic storage is also widely used in some specific applications, such as bank cheques (MICR) and credit/debit cards (mag stripes).

== Future ==
A new type of magnetic storage, called magnetoresistive random-access memory or MRAM, is being produced that stores data in magnetic bits based on the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. Its advantage is non-volatility, low power usage, and good shock robustness. The first generation that was developed was produced by Everspin Technologies, and utilized field induced writing. The second generation is being developed through two approaches: thermal-assisted switching (TAS) which is currently being developed by Crocus Technology, and spin-transfer torque (STT) on which Crocus, Hynix, IBM, and several other companies are working. However, with storage density and capacity orders of magnitude smaller than a hard disk, MRAM is useful in applications where moderate amounts of storage with a need for very frequent updates are required, which flash memory cannot support due to its limited write endurance. Six state MRAM is also being developed, echoing four bit multi level flash memory cells, that have six different bits, as opposed to two.

Research is also being done by Aleksei Kimel at Radboud University in the Netherlands towards the possibility of using terahertz radiation rather than using standard electropulses for writing data on magnetic storage media. By using terahertz radiation, writing time can be reduced considerably (50x faster than when using standard electropulses). Another advantage is that terahertz radiation generates almost no heat, thus reducing cooling requirements.

<doc id="896360" wikidata="Q529984" url="?curid=896360" title="Eric Anundsson">
<text>Eric Anundsson or Eymundsson was a semi-legendary Swedish king who supposedly ruled during the 9th century. The Norse sagas describe him as successful in extending his realm over the Baltic Sea, but unsuccessful in his attempts of westward expansion. There is no near-contemporary evidence for his existence, the sources for his reign dating from the 13th and 14th centuries. These sources, Icelandic sagas, are generally not considered reliable sources for the periods and events they describe.

Controversially, older Swedish historians have identified Eric with another legendary Swedish king, &quot;Erik Weatherhat&quot;, who is mentioned in some medieval king-lists as the predecessor of Eric the Victorious. However, Saxo Grammaticus identifies Erik Weatherhat with another figure, a son of the legendary Viking Ragnar Lodbrok.

==Eric&#x27;s reign==

He is given as the son of Anund Uppsale in the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; (13th century):

:&quot;Eiríkr hét sonr Önundar konungs, er ríki tók eptir föður sinn at Uppsölum; hann var ríkr konungr. Á hans dögum hófst til ríkis í Noregi Haraldr hárfagri, er fyrstr kom einvaldi í Noreg sinna ættmanna.&quot;

:&quot;Eric was the son of king Anund, and he succeeded his father at Uppsala; he was a rich king. During his reign, Harald Fairhair came to power in Norway, Harald was the first of his kin to reign as a monarch in Norway.&quot;

However, the Eric who was contemporary with Harald Fairhair is called &quot;Eymundsson&quot; by Snorri Sturluson. Since the preceding king Anund is often identified with an Anund who flourished in the 840s and is mentioned by other sources (Rimbert and Adam of Bremen), &quot;Anundsson&quot; is probably the correct form of the patronym. The names &quot;Eymund&quot; and &quot;Anund&quot; were equivalent enough for the later king Anund Jacob to be called &quot;Emund&quot; (Eymund), in the &quot;Westrogothic law&quot;. Consequently, Eric&#x27;s patronym would not be the only instance where the two names were confused.

According to &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, he was preceded by his father Anund Uppsale and uncle Björn at Hauge, and later on succeeded by Björn (the father of Eric the Victorious and Olof Björnsson). &quot;Landnámabók&quot; informs that Eric and his son Björn ruled during the time of the Pope Adrian II and Pope John VIII, i.e. in the period 867–883, the time of the first settlement of Iceland. &quot;Harald Fairhair&#x27;s saga&quot; relates that Erik died when Harald Fairhair had been king of all Norway for ten years. Traditionally this would indicate 882, but Harald&#x27;s ascent to power is nowadays believed to have occurred later, in the 880s or c. 900.

Erik is mentioned in several places in the Heimskringla. In the &quot;saga of Olaf Haraldsson&quot;, Thorgny Lawspeaker relates:
:&quot;My grandfather Thorgny could well remember the Uppsala king Eirik Eymundson, and used to say of him that when he was in his best years he went out every summer on expeditions to different countries, and conquered for himself Finland, Kirjalaland, Courland, Estonia, and the eastern countries all around; and at the present day the earth-bulwarks, ramparts, and other great works which he made are to be seen. And, moreover, he was not so proud that he would not listen to people who had anything to say to him.&quot;

==Conflict with Harald Fairhair==

In &quot;Harald Fairhair&#x27;s saga&quot;, Snorri Sturluson relates that Eric also wanted to extend Sweden westwards and to make a kingdom for himself as large as that of the Swedish king Sigurd Hring and his son Ragnar Lodbrok (i.e. Raumarike, Vingulmark and Westfold all the way to the island of Grenmar). Thus he conquered Värmland and all the land south of Svinesund (modern Bohuslän) and claimed the shores of Viken as his own, naming it all West Götaland. He placed Hrane Gautske (Hrane the as Jarl of the land between Svinesund and Göta älv. In these territories the people accepted Erik as their king.

When King Harald Fairhair arrived at Tønsberg (in Viken, and at the time a trading town) from Trondheim, he learnt of this and became very angry. He assembled the ting at Fold and accused the people of treason, after which some had to accept his rule, while others were punished. He then spent the summer forcing Viken and Raumarike to accept his rule.

When the winter arrived, Harald learnt that the Swedish king was in Värmland, after which he crossed the Ed forest and ordered the people to arrange feasts for him and his entourage. The most powerful man in the province was a man named Åke, who had formerly been one of Halfdan the Black&#x27;s men, and he invited both the Norwegian king and the Swedish king to his halls. Åke had built a new hall instead of his old one, which was ornamented in the same splendid manner, but the old hall only had old ornaments and hangings. When the kings arrived, the Swedish king was placed in the old hall, whereas the Norwegian king was placed in the new one. The Norwegian king found himself in a hall with new gilded vessels carved with figures and shining like glass, full of the best liquor.

The next day, the kings prepared to leave. Bidding his farewell Åke gave to Harald&#x27;s service his own twelve-year-old son Ubbe. Harald thanked Åke and promised him his friendship. Then Åke talked to the Swedish king, who was in a bad mood. Åke gave him valuable gifts and followed the king on the road until they came to the woods. Eric asked Åke why he, who was his man, had made such a difference between him and the Norwegian king. Åke answered that there was nothing to blame Erik for but that he had got the old things and the old hall because he was old whereas the Norwegian king was in the bloom of his youth. Åke also answered that he was no less the Swedish king&#x27;s man than the Swedish king was his man. Hearing the words of treason, Eric drew his sword and slew the impudent Åke.

When Harald learnt of this, he and his retainers mounted their horses and chased after the Swedish king until they spotted him. When Eric and his men became aware that they were pursued, they rode as hard as they could until they had reached the wood that divided Värmland and Götaland. At this point Harald considered it best to return. He then spent the rest of the autumn killing all the Swedish king&#x27;s men in Värmland.

In the winter, Harald plundered and burnt in Rånrike. In the meantime the Geats gathered an army, preparing to resist the Norwegians. When the ice broke up they drove stakes into the Göta älv to stop ships from entering. Nevertheless, the Norwegians invaded Götaland and laid their ships alongside the stakes. The Geats came down to the shore with a sizeable army and gave battle. A lot of people fell, but King Harald gained the victory. He then travelled far and wide in Götaland, winning most of the battles. In one of the battles, Hrane Gautske fell. Harald then proclaimed himself the ruler of all land north of Göta älv and north and west of lake Vänern and placed Guttorm Haraldsson to defend the region with a large force. There were disturbances between Harald and the Geats until King Eric died, ten years after Harald&#x27;s ascension to power. He was succeeded by his son Björn (III) Eriksson who ruled the Swedes for 50 years.

==Contemporary references to the period==

The only possibly contemporary sources for the war are three scaldic verses said to be composed by King Harald&#x27;s skald Þorbjörn Hornklofi. One of them states that Harald was the enemy of the Geats and apparently won a victory over them. Another says that Harald subdued land and people south of the sea, and tied his ship to the stakes by the shore, without further specification. The verses mention neither Eric nor any Swedes. The historian Curt Weibull has characterised Eric as historically problematic, and doubted that the Swedes had anything to do with Värmland or West Götaland in the late 9th century. A late 9th-century geographical account preserved in an Anglo-Saxon manuscript, by Ohthere of Hålogaland, vaguely says that Norway borders &quot;to Sweoland at the other side of the mountains, until the southern part of the country, and far up to the north&quot;. Another account in the same manuscript, by Wulfstan of Hedeby, says that Blekinge, Möre, Öland and Gotland belonged to the Swedes (hyrað to Sweon).

==Other accounts==

The Flateyjarbók (late 14th century) has a different account about Eric Anundsson. It says that Björn at Haugi was king when Harald Fairhair became king in Norway. His successor Anund then ruled for at least 40 years, being succeeded by his son Eric who ruled for 47 years. Eric married Ingigerd, a daughter of Harald Fairhair. After some time she was to be sacrificed to the gods for unspecified reasons. The Swedes, therefore, brought the queen to an island where the blót would take place. She was however rescued by her brother Halfdan the Black (Junior) and brought to safety. This incident provoked long-time hostilities between Harald and Eric. Later on, Harald&#x27;s trustee Hauk Håbrok went to Holmgard in Kievan Rus&#x27; to make purchases but had an adventurous confrontation with two champions of Eric who stayed there. A saga about Harald Fairhair&#x27;s skalds also mentions a Swedish King Eric who was Harald&#x27;s enemy; he is however given the patronym &quot;Björnsson&quot;.

<doc id="896369" wikidata="Q1038586" url="?curid=896369" title="Ring of Sweden">
<text>Ring was a Swedish monarch or local ruler who ruled at Uppsala, an important early Swedish political center, around or before the year 936. He either ruled before or together with his two sons Eric and Emund. Virtually nothing is known about him beyond his name.

==Bishop Unni&#x27;s visit==

The Archbishopric of Bremen had conducted Christian mission in Central Sweden during the 9th century, but the effort lapsed in the second half of the century for various reasons. The German Kingdom came into closer contact with Scandinavia when King Henry the Fowler defeated the Danes in 934 and gained influence in the important emporium Hedeby in South Jutland. The German ecclesiastic chronicler Adam of Bremen, writing in c. 1075, relates that the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen, Unni, arrived to Denmark to appoint priests for the churches in the realm. From Denmark he traveled over the Baltic Sea and arrived, with some discomfort, to Birka in the Swedish kingdom. This happened in 935 or 936. According to Adam, almost no Christian teachers had visited Birka for seventy years. &quot;The believer in the Lord went ashore in this port and proceeded to make contact with the population for his unusual purpose. For the Swedes and Geats, or to put it better, the Norsemen, had, during the period of barbaric raids of conquest, when many kings exercised a bloody rule during a few consecutive years, entirely forgotten the Christian religion and could not now be easily persuaded to believe in it. I have heard from the often-quoted King Sweyn (of Denmark, ruled 1047-1076), that the Swedes at this time were ruled by a certain Ring together with his sons Eric and Emund. This is the same Ring who was preceded by Anund, Björn and Olof, about whom one may read in the biography of Ansgar, and others who are not mentioned. And it is likely that the warrior of God, Unni, turned to these kings although they were not believers, and preached the word of God in the land of the Swedes with their permission ... Swedes and Geats, among whom the Holy Ansgar had first spread the seeds of faith, but reverted to paganism, were once again called to faith by the Holy Father Unni ... When the messenger of God had completed his missionary task and eventually decided to go home, he fell ill in Birka and left his tired body there.&quot;

==Name and place==

Unni died on 17 September 936, though it is unclear if Adam&#x27;s assertion of him and King Ring being contemporaries is the author&#x27;s guesswork. King Ring is not mentioned in the Norse king lists and sagas, such as Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks. The name is however borne by the Swedish ruler who was victorious in the legendary Battle of Bråvalla, Sigurd Ring. It is not otherwise attested among the members of the Viking Age royal family. It has sometimes been speculated that his true name was Olof (Anlaufr), represented in Latin chronicles as Anulo, which could have been misinterpreted as Latin &quot;annulus&quot;, meaning &quot;ring&quot;. There has also been some speculation about the location of Birka where Unni died. A runic inscription on a cross at the church of Sund in Åland has been interpreted by local scholars as &quot;Wini&quot; (Unni), which would call for a radical reinterpretation of the historical geography of Viking Age Sweden. The dominating view among historians and archaeologists is nevertheless that Birka was situated on Björkö in Lake Mälaren.

The German encroachment on Scandinavia, which resulted in Unni&#x27;s visit, may also have alerted the rulers of Birka. The family of Danish rulers who were defeated in 934 is said to have come from Sweden, although this statement has been much-disputed by modern scholars. At any rate Birka apparently had strong commercial relations with Hedeby. The fortifications of Birka were strengthened around 940 as the gravel walls were heightened, and palisades seem to have been erected.

<doc id="896372" wikidata="Q7309247" url="?curid=896372" title="American English regional vocabulary">
<text>Regional vocabulary within American English varies. Below is a list of lexical differences in vocabulary that are generally associated with a region. A term featured on a list may or may not be found throughout the region concerned, and may or may not be recognized by speakers outside that region. Some terms appear on more than one list.

== Regionalisms ==

Historically, a number of everyday words and expressions used to be characteristic of different dialect areas of the United States, especially the North, the Midland, and the South; many of these terms spread from their area of origin and came to be used throughout the nation. Today many people use these different words for the same object interchangeably, or to distinguish between variations of an object. Such traditional lexical variables include:
* &quot;faucet&quot; (North) and &quot;spigot&quot; (South)
* &quot;frying pan&quot; (North and South, but not Midland), &quot;spider&quot; (obsolete New England), and &quot;skillet&quot; (Midland and South)
* &quot;gutter&quot; (Northeast, South, and West), &quot;eaves trough&quot; (West and Inland North), and &quot;rainspouting&quot; (Maryland and Pennsylvania)
* &quot;pit&quot; (North) and &quot;seed&quot; (elsewhere)
* &quot;teeter-totter&quot; (North; widespread), &quot;seesaw&quot; (South and Midland; now widespread), and &quot;dandle&quot; (Rhode Island)
* &quot;firefly&quot; (more Northern and Western) and &quot;lightning bug&quot; (widespread)
* &quot;pail&quot; (North, north Midland) and &quot;bucket&quot; (Midland and South; now widespread)
*&quot;sneakers&quot; (Northeast and fairly widespread), &quot;tennis shoes&quot; (widespread outside the Northeast) and &quot;gym shoes&quot; (Chicago and Cincinnati)
* &quot;soda&quot; (Northeast, Greater Milwaukee, Great St. Louis, California, and Florida), &quot;pop&quot; (Inland North, Upper Midwest, and Northwest), &quot;coke&quot; (South), and &quot;tonic&quot; (Eastern New England possibility) &quot;See also&quot;: &quot;Names for soft drinks in the United States&quot;
* &quot;you guys&quot; (widespread), &quot;y&#x27;all&quot; (Southern and South Midland), &quot;you&#x27;uns&quot; and &quot; yins&quot; (Western Pennsylvania), and &quot;yous&quot; or &quot;youse&quot; (New York City, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and Northeastern Pennsylvania)

However many differences still hold and mark boundaries between different dialect areas, as shown below. From 2000 to 2005, for instance, &quot;The Dialect Survey&quot; queried North American English speakers&#x27; usage of a variety of linguistic items, including vocabulary items that vary by region. These include:

* generic term for a sweetened carbonated beverage
* drink made with milk and ice cream
* long sandwich that contains cold cuts, lettuce, and so on
* rubber-soled shoes worn in physical education class, for athletic activities, etc.

Below are lists outlining regional vocabularies in the main dialect areas of the United States.

<text>Kirsten Malfrid Flagstad (12 July 1895 – 7 December 1962) was a Norwegian opera singer, who was the outstanding Wagnerian soprano of her era. Her triumphant debut in New York on 2 February 1935 is one of the legends of opera. Giulio Gatti-Casazza, the longstanding General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera said, “I have given America two great gifts — Caruso and Flagstad.”

Called &quot;the voice of the century&quot;, she ranks among the greatest singers of the 20th century. Desmond Shawe-Taylor wrote of her in the &quot;New Grove Dictionary of Opera&quot;: &quot;No one within living memory surpassed her in sheer beauty and consistency of line and tone.&quot;

==Early life and career==

Flagstad was born in Hamar, Norway, in her grandparents&#x27; home, now the Kirsten Flagstad Museum. Though she never actually lived in Hamar, she always considered it her home town. She was raised in Oslo within a musical family; her father Michael Flagstad was a conductor and her mother Maja Flagstad a pianist. Their other children were also musicians: the conductor Ole Flagstad, pianist Lasse Flagstad, and soprano Karen-Marie Flagstad.

She received her early musical training in Oslo and made her stage debut at the National Theatre, as Nuri in Eugen d&#x27;Albert&#x27;s &quot;Tiefland&quot; in 1913. Her first recordings were made between 1913 and 1915.
After further study in Stockholm with Dr. Gillis Bratt, she pursued a career in opera and operetta in Norway. In 1919, she married her first husband Sigurd Hall and a year later gave birth to her only child, a daughter, Else Marie Hall. Later that year she signed up with the newly created Opera Comique in Oslo, under the direction of Alexander Varnay and Benno Singer. Varnay was the father of the famous soprano Astrid Varnay. Flagstad&#x27;s ability to learn roles quickly was noted, as it often took her only a few days to do so. She sang Desdemona opposite Leo Slezak, Minnie, Amelia and other lesser roles at the Opera Comique.

She sang at the Stora Teatern of Gothenburg, Sweden, between 1928 and 1934, and made her debut there singing Agathe in &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; by Weber. In 1930, a revival of Nielsen&#x27;s &quot;Saul and David&quot; featured Flagstad singing the role of Michal. On 31 May 1930 she married her second husband, the Norwegian industrialist and lumber merchant Henry Johansen, who subsequently helped her in expanding her career. In 1932 she made her debut in &quot;Rodelinda&quot; by Handel.

After singing operetta and lyric roles such as Marguerite in &quot;Faust&quot; for over a decade, Flagstad decided to take on heavier operatic roles such as &quot;Tosca&quot; and &quot;Aida&quot;. The part of Aida helped to unleash Flagstad&#x27;s dramatic abilities. In 1932, she took on the role of Isolde in Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and appeared to have found her true voice. Ellen Gulbranson, a Swedish soprano at Bayreuth, persuaded Winifred Wagner to audition Flagstad for the Bayreuth Festival. Flagstad sang minor roles in 1933, but at the next season in 1934, she sang the roles of Sieglinde in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; and Gutrune in &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; at the Festival, opposite Frida Leider as Brünnhilde.

==Debut at the Metropolitan Opera==
Flagstad was first noticed by Otto Hermann Kahn, then chairman of the board of the Metropolitan Opera, on a trip to Scandinavia in 1929, and Met management made overtures soon after. Their letters were never answered, however. At the time, Flagstad had just met her soon to be second husband and had even briefly considered giving up opera altogether. Then, in the summer of 1934, when the Met needed a replacement for Frida Leider, Flagstad agreed to audition for conductor Artur Bodanzky and Met general manager Giulio Gatti-Casazza in St Moritz in August 1934, and she was engaged immediately. Upon leaving St Moritz, Bodanzky&#x27;s parting words for Flagstad were &quot;Come to New York as soon as you know these roles (Isolde, the three Brünnhildes, Leonore in &quot;Fidelio&quot;, and the Marschallin in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;). And above all do not go and get fat! Your slender, youthful figure is not the least reason you were engaged.&quot;

At the Met Flagstad became a pupil of vocal coach Hermann Weigert, who prepared her for all her roles with the company. Her debut at the Met, as Sieglinde in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; on the afternoon of 2 February 1935, created a sensation, though it was not planned as a special event. By this time, after weeks of rehearsals, Met management already knew what they had, but they nonetheless decided on a low key debut. Flagstad was unknown in the United States at the time. The performance was, however, broadcast nationwide on the Met&#x27;s weekly syndicated radio program, and the first inkling of the deluge of critical praise to come was given when intermission host and former Met star Geraldine Farrar discarded her prepared notes, overwhelmed by what she had just heard, and breathlessly announced that a new star had just been born. Days later, Flagstad sang Isolde, and later that month, she performed Brünnhilde in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; and &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; for the first time. Before the end of the season, Flagstad sang Elsa in &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, Elisabeth in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, and her first Kundry in &quot;Parsifal&quot;.

==Further career in America and elsewhere==

Almost overnight, she had established herself as the pre-eminent Wagnerian soprano of the era. It has been said that she saved the Metropolitan Opera from looming bankruptcy. Her performances, sometimes three or four a week in her early days at the Met, quickly sold out at the box office as soon as they went on sale. Her services to the Met were not from box office receipts alone; her nationwide personal appeals to radio listeners during Saturday matinee intermissions brought thousands of dollars in donations to the Met&#x27;s coffers. &quot;Fidelio&quot; (1936 and later) was her only non-Wagnerian role at the Met before the war. In 1935, she performed all three Brünnhildes in the San Francisco Opera&#x27;s Ring cycle. In 1937, she first appeared at the Chicago City Opera Company.
In 1936 and 1937, Flagstad performed the roles of Isolde, Brünnhilde, and Senta at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, under Sir Thomas Beecham, Fritz Reiner and Wilhelm Furtwängler, arousing as much enthusiasm there as she had in New York. She also toured Australia in 1938. Hollywood also tried to cash in on Flagstad fever, after her sudden popularity in the US in the mid-1930s, with her many appearances on NBC Radio, The Kraft Music Hall with Bing Crosby, and regular appearances on CBS&#x27;s The Ford Sunday Evening Hour. Though Flagstad was not interested in stardom or Hollywood contracts per se, she did make trips to Hollywood during the late 1930s for publicity photo shoots, public appearances, concerts at the Hollywood Bowl, and she filmed a rendition of Brünnhilde&#x27;s Battle Cry from &quot;Die Walküre&quot; for the Hollywood variety show anthology &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1938&quot;, in which she was introduced to American film audiences by Bob Hope. Flagstad and Sonja Henie are the only two Norwegians to have their own stars on Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;Walk of Fame&quot;.

Her career at the Met, however, was not without its ups-and-downs. Flagstad got involved in a long-running feud with tenor co-star Lauritz Melchior after Melchior took offense to some comments Flagstad made about &quot;stupid publicity photos&quot; during a game of bridge in Flagstad&#x27;s hotel suite while the two were on tour together in Rochester, NY. Present during the infamous bridge game were Flagstad, Melchior and his wife, and Edwin McArthur. Afterwards, Melchior fanned the flames further by insisting that there be no solo curtain calls for Flagstad when the two performed together. Audiences had no clue that, despite the marvelous and sometimes historic performances, the two never said a word to each other off stage for the next two years. It was Flagstad&#x27;s husband Henry Johansen who finally brought the two together to make peace.

Flagstad also feuded with the Met&#x27;s general manager, Edward Johnson, after conductor Artur Bodanzky&#x27;s death, when she asked to be conducted for a few performances by her accompanist, Edwin McArthur, rather than by the Met&#x27;s new conductor Erich Leinsdorf. Flagstad had wanted this for McArthur, whom she had taken under her wing. Johnson refused and would not hear of it any further. Flagstad did get her way, though; she went over Johnson&#x27;s head and discussed the matter with the Met&#x27;s board of directors, particularly David Sarnoff, RCA and NBC founder and chairman. It was Sarnoff who made the arrangements for McArthur to begin conducting Met productions on a limited basis. Her relationship with Johnson improved, however; just before Flagstad left the Met in 1941, on the night of her 100th performance of Isolde, she received 100 roses, courtesy of Melchior and Johnson.

==Return to Norway==
Having received repeated and cryptic cablegrams from her husband, who had returned to Norway a year and a half earlier, Flagstad was forced to consider leaving the United States in 1941. Though dismissing the political implications of the departure of someone of her fame from the United States to German-occupied Norway, it was nonetheless a difficult decision for her. She had many friends, colleagues, and of course many fans all over the US. Even more importantly, her 20-year-old daughter Else had married an American named Arthur Dusenberry and was living with her new husband on a dude ranch in Bozeman, Montana. It was Edwin McArthur who gave the bride away at the wedding in Bozeman a year earlier. Nonetheless, against the best advice of her friends and colleagues, including former president Herbert Hoover, who pleaded with her to stay out of Europe, she returned to Norway via Lisbon, Madrid, Barcelona, Marseille, and Berlin in April, 1941.

Though during the war she performed only in Sweden and Switzerland, countries not occupied by German forces, this fact did not temper the storm of public opinion that hurt her personally and professionally for the next several years. Her husband was arrested after the war for profiteering during the occupation that involved his lumber business. This arrest, together with her decision to remain in occupied Norway, made her unpopular, particularly in the United States. Both the Norwegian ambassador and columnist Walter Winchell spoke out against her. In 1948, she performed several benefit concerts for the United Jewish Appeal. In defense of Flagstad&#x27;s husband, Henry Johansen, after his death it was revealed that during the occupation he was arrested by the Gestapo and held for eight days. Also, one of Johansen&#x27;s sons by his first marriage, Henry Jr, had been a member of the Norwegian underground throughout the war.

==Post-war career==
Flagstad eventually returned to the Metropolitan Opera, invited by its new general manager, Rudolf Bing, who was furiously criticized for this choice: &quot;The greatest soprano of this century must sing in the world&#x27;s greatest opera house&quot;, he replied. She also returned to Covent Garden following its reopening in 1947 (a rare exception – the Opera House, in acute financial straits following the war-time closure, was attempting to build up a house company of English nationals, principally singing in English, in preference to expensive guest stars). In four consecutive seasons from 1948 to 1952, she sang in all her regular Wagnerian roles, including Kundry and Sieglinde. She toured South America in 1948 and returned to San Francisco in 1949, and finally returned to the Met. In the 1950–1951 season, although she was aged well into her 50s, Flagstad showed herself still in remarkable form as Isolde, Brünnhilde and Leonore.
Despite the great fanfare surrounding her return to the Met in early 1951, and her success in resuming her roles there, Flagstad decided that it would be her final year singing Wagner on the stage. She had gained quite a bit of weight since her pre-war years at the Met when she sang those long and physically demanding roles night after night. In 1950, when she accepted Bing&#x27;s invitation, she felt she did not have the stamina she had had as a younger woman. She had also developed an arthritic hip in mid-1951 (and had to consult doctors in New York); this further made the operatic stage difficult for her, especially when singing Wagner. She gave her farewell operatic performance at the Met on 1 April 1952, not as Brünnhilde or Isolde but in the title role of Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Alceste&quot;, a role she had learnt in the war years in Norway. In London she appeared as Dido (another recently learnt role) in Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; at the Mermaid Theatre. To celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, in July 1953 Madam Flagstad appeared as Dido in Bernard Miles reconstructed &#x27;Globe Theatre&#x27; which was erected inside the Royal Exchange building in the City of London. I - Desmond Flanagan and another LAMDA student - Bill Horsley acted as stage-hands for the production, and actually pushed &#x27;Queen Dido&#x27;s Throne on to and off the stage area with the use of ropes and a pole): the portrayal was recorded (in studio), and issued by EMI in January 1953 (see: Recordings). Her last operatic appearance was as Dido in Oslo on June 5, 1953.

She was a guest on the BBC radio show &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on 29 April 1952.

==Four Last Songs==
During the post-war years, Flagstad was also responsible for the world premiere of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Four Last Songs&quot;. Strauss had written the pieces during his exile in Switzerland following the war (like Flagstad, he had been vilified as a collaborator with the Nazis). He intended them to be premiered by Flagstad, though not because he had her voice in mind. (The songs are better suited to the lyric soprano voice he idealised throughout his life, as exemplified by Elisabeth Schumann and ultimately his wife Pauline de Ahna. Strauss, moreover, had heard praise for Flagstad over the years, but had not heard her sing in person since casting her as the soprano soloist in the 1933 Bayreuth Festival performance of the Beethoven Choral Symphony.) It was, rather, out of sympathy for her difficulties. He sent Flagstad a letter, accompanied by a collection of his own works which he desired her to consider adding to her repertoire, and requested that she give the premiere – together with &quot;a first-class conductor and ensemble&quot; – of these four new orchestral lieder, at that point still in the publication process.

Flagstad accepted the commission, although Strauss did not live to see the premiere. As a conductor, she chose not McArthur (who, though an excellent piano accompanist, was not considered a ‘first-class’ orchestral conductor) but Wilhelm Furtwängler (also experiencing the repercussions of suspect wartime conduct), and the pair chose Walter Legge&#x27;s Philharmonia Orchestra, with which they both worked well, to provide the accompaniment. By the time of the premiere on 22 May 1950 at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, Flagstad was almost 55 years old. Her voice by this point was darker, heavier, and more inflexible than when she had sung for Strauss at Bayreuth, and she was becoming reluctant to venture above the staff, as would be notoriously demonstrated in the recording of &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; two years later; the Strauss songs, particularly the Hesse settings, were thus not ideally suited to her resources, and she found herself tested to her limits. &quot;Frühling&quot; indeed, gave such trouble that Legge, in promoting the concert, was two days before the event advertising the Strauss as &quot;three songs with orchestra&quot;. In the event, Flagstad rose to the occasion and included &quot;Frühling&quot; (excluding, however, the highest note), and the close of &quot;Im Abendrot&quot; was followed by a respectful silence in memory of Strauss. The concert, which aside from the Strauss songs consisted of Wagner (including Isolde&#x27;s &quot;Liebestod&quot; and Brünnhilde&#x27;s Immolation), received favorable reviews; recordings of Flagstad&#x27;s contributions were made from the radio broadcast, and are today commercially available. Flagstad added &quot;September&quot;, &quot;Beim Schlafengehen&quot;, and &quot;Im Abendrot&quot; to her repertoire, and recordings (technologically superior to those taken at the premiere) exist of these performed in concert; she did not, however, sing &quot;Frühling&quot; again.

==Retirement==
After her retirement from the stage, she continued to give concert performances and record – first for EMI setting down her definitive account of Isolde in the first commercially released account of &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, and then for Decca Records. She even made some stereophonic recordings, including excerpts from Wagner&#x27;s operas with Hans Knappertsbusch and Sir Georg Solti conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1958, she sang the part of Fricka in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, the first instalment in Solti&#x27;s complete stereophonic set of the Ring Cycle, released by Decca on LP and reel-to-reel tape. She also spent time mentoring young singers in her native country, including contralto Eva Gustavson.

From around 1952, when she gave her Met farewell, until her death 10 years later, Flagstad&#x27;s health steadily deteriorated. She was in and out of hospitals on an increasing basis both in the number and the length of her stays for a variety of ailments. She even joked with an interviewer in 1958 that Oslo hospital had become her home away from home. From 1958 to 1960, Flagstad was the first Director of the Norwegian National Opera. In her last years she gave many benefit concerts throughout Norway. She was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer in 1960 and died of the disease on 7 December 1962. At her request she was buried in an unmarked grave in Vestre Gravlund Cemetery in the Frogner borough of Oslo. The largest floral arrangement at her funeral was sent by Lauritz Melchior.

==Legacy==

The Kirsten Flagstad Museum in Hamar, Norway, contains a private collection of opera artifacts. Her costumes draw special attention, and include several examples on loan from the Metropolitan Opera Archives. Her portrait appeared on the Norwegian 100 kroner bill and on the tail section of Norwegian Air Shuttle planes.

&quot;That voice! How can one describe it?&quot; wrote opera critic Harold C. Schonberg in his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary of Flagstad. &quot;It was enormous, but did not sound enormous because it was never pushed or out of placement. It had a rather cool silvery quality, and was handled instrumentally, almost as though a huge violin was emitting legato phrases.&quot; Incredibly, Flagstad sang the role of Isolde 70 times on the Met stage from 1935 to 1941, making &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; one of the greatest box office attractions in Metropolitan Opera history. Nine of those performances were Saturday matinee radio broadcasts.

==Recordings==

A comprehensive survey of her recordings was released in several volumes on the Simax label.

Her pre-war recordings, which show her voice in its freshest brilliance and clarity, include studio recordings of Wagner arias, Beethoven arias, and Grieg songs, as well as duets from &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, &quot;Parsifal&quot;, and &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; with Lauritz Melchior. These have been reissued on compact disc by RCA Victor, as well as on Naxos, Preiser and Romophone.

Many Metropolitan Opera broadcasts also survive and have circulated among collectors and more recently on CD. These include:
*&quot;Die Walküre&quot;, Act I and fragments from Act II from her 1935 début broadcast; 1937 (as Sieglinde); 1940.
*&quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, performances from 1935, 1937, and 1940 all readily available.
*&quot;Tannhäuser&quot;: 1936, with Melchior and Tibbett, 1939, and 1941 (the latter having an official release on Metropolitan Opera LPs).
*&quot;Siegfried&quot;: 1937, with Lauritz Melchior and Friedrich Schorr (available on Naxos and Guild labels).
*&quot;Lohengrin&quot;: 1937, with René Maison
*&quot;Fidelio&quot;: 1941 with Bruno Walter (available on Naxos)
*&quot;Alceste&quot;: 1952 (available on Walhall)

After World War II, many important studio recordings followed including:
*Wagner Scenes including the final duet from &quot;Siegfried&quot; (Testament CDs, licensed from EMI)
*&quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;: Final Scene, with Furtwängler - EMI
*&quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;: Complete opera with Furtwängler - EMI
*Norwegian Songs: EMI
*&quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;: with Fjeldstad and Bjoner and Set Svanholm. 1956 - Urania and Walhall.
*&quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;: Gebhard. From Teatro alla Scala with Furtwängler, Lorenz, Svanholm, Frantz. 1950

Perhaps her most famous operatic recording is the 1952 &quot;Tristan&quot; with Furtwängler, which has never been out of print. It is available from EMI and Naxos, among others. Because she was aged 57, she was unsure of her capacity to reach the top Cs in Act II, and agreed to Elisabeth Schwarzkopf providing her voice for this purpose. Another two &quot;Tristan&quot;s of note are two live performances: from London on 18 May and 2 June 1936, with Lauritz Melchior as Tristan, Emanuel List as Marke, Sabine Kalter as Brangäne, and Herbert Janssen as Kurwenal, conducted by Fritz Reiner leading the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and from the Teatro Colón (Buenos Aires) on 20 August 1948, with Set Svanholm as Tristan, Viorica Ursuleac as Brangäne, Hans Hotter as Kurwenal, and Ludwig Weber as Marke, conducted by Erich Kleiber.

Two live concerts are of particular historical significance:
*&quot;Four Last Songs&quot; (Richard Strauss, world premiere), with excerpts from &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, (Philharmonia Orchestra, cond. Wilhelm Furtwängler), London 22 May 1950. (Testament)
*Carnegie Hall American farewell concert (Symphony of the Air, cond. McArthur), 20 March 1955. (Includes &quot;Die Walküre&quot; Act I excerpts; &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; final scene, &quot;Tristan&quot; Liebestod, and Wesendonck Lieder (orchestral version).) (World Records LP T-366-7.)
*Flagstad&#x27;s celebrated 1951 appearance at the Mermaid Theatre, London in Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; is represented by a cast recording in which the Mermaid &quot;Belinda&quot; (Maggie Teyte) was replaced by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, but under the original direction of Geraint Jones. (HMV ALP 1026, EMG review January 1953). A live performance with Teyte is available on the Walhall label.
*The &quot;Alceste&quot; (original Italian version edited by Geraint Jones) in which she also made a farewell was recorded with Raoul Jobin, Alexander Young, Marion Lowe, Thomas Hemsley, Joan Clark, Rosemary Thayer, Geraint Jones Orchestra and singers, Geraint Jones (Decca LP LXT 5273–5276). (Her part was recorded April 28, April 30, and May 1, 1956.)

In 1956, she moved to Decca where in the autumn of her career further important studio recordings followed:
*Several albums of Grieg, Sibelius, Brahms, etc., with orchestra and piano
*Hymns (traditional Norwegian language hymns)
*Wagner arias with Knappertsbusch (stereo)
*Acts I and III of &quot;Die Walküre&quot; (as Sieglinde and Brünnhilde, respectively) as well as the Brünnhilde/Siegmund duet from Act II (these conducted variously by Knappertsbusch and Solti, as a sort of preparation for Decca&#x27;s complete Ring project).
*Her great valedictory as Fricka in the Decca &quot;Rheingold&quot; of 1958.
Almost to the end of her life, Flagstad continued to sing in fine voice, although she increasingly sang mezzo-soprano material or in a mezzo range: besides the &quot;Rheingold&quot; Fricka (a mezzo role), Decca planned to cast her also as the &quot;Walkure&quot; Fricka and the &quot;Gotterdammerung&quot; Waltraute for its complete Ring (in the event, both roles were sung by Christa Ludwig), and also to record her in Brahms’ &quot;Four Serious Songs&quot; and &quot;Alto Rhapsody&quot;; that these plans were shelved only by her final illness and death stands as a testament to her superbly consistent vocal abilities, and to the respect and affection in which she was held to the end by record companies and the public.

<text>Erik Ringsson was a Swedish king and the son of Ring, according to the German ecclesiastic chronicler Adam of Bremen. He is said to have ruled together with his father and his brother Emund in about 936, and later presumably reigned in his own name.

==Reign==

The name of this king is only known from Adam&#x27;s work Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum from c. 1075. The Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen, Unni, was able to arrange church matters in Denmark after the defeat of the Danes at the hands of King Henry the Fowler of Germany in 934. From Denmark he proceeded to the Swedish trading port Birka in 935 or 936. Referring to information from the Danish King Sweyn Estridsen, Adam states that the Swedes at this time were ruled by a certain Ring and his sons Erik and Emund. Adam finds it likely that Unni approached these heathen kings and obtained permission to propagate Christianity, which by this time was long forgotten in the region. After his mission was over, Unni prepared to return but fell ill and died in Birka in 936. Later on Adam mentions an Emund Eriksson as ruling in Sweden at the height of Harald Bluetooth&#x27;s reign in Denmark (around the 970s). From his name he appears to have been a son of Erik Ringsson.

==Place in the Swedish king list==

The reign of Erik Ringsson has been tentatively dated in the 940s and 950s. He is not mentioned in any Norse sagas or king lists. 13th century sagas, such as Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks and Heimskringla, mention a Björn Eriksson as ruling for a long time in the 10th century, being the father of the historical ruler Eric the Victorious (c. 980–995). Referring to Erik Ringsson as King Eric IV or V is later inventions, counting backwards from Eric XIV (1560–68). He and his brother Charles IX (1604–1611) adopted numerals according to a fictitious history of Sweden. The number of Swedish monarchs named Eric before Eric XIV (at least seven) is unknown, going back into prehistory, and none of them used numerals. It would be speculative to try to affix a mathematically accurate one to this king.

<text>The Cathedral of Saint Paul is a Roman Catholic cathedral in the city of Saint Paul, Minnesota. It is the co-cathedral of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, along with the Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis. One of the most distinctive cathedrals in the United States, it sits on Cathedral Hill overlooking downtown Saint Paul and features a distinctive copper-clad dome. It is dedicated to Paul the Apostle, who is also the namesake of the City of Saint Paul. The current building opened in 1915 as the fourth cathedral of the archdiocese to bear this name. On March 25, 2009, it was designated as the National Shrine of the Apostle Paul by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. It is the third-largest Catholic cathedral and sixth-largest church in the United States.

== Background ==
The first church building in what became the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis was a small log chapel built at the urging of Father Lucien Galtier. He came to the area when the settlement was still known as &quot;Pig&#x27;s Eye&quot; (after Pierre &quot;Pig&#x27;s Eye&quot; Parrant). The chapel, measuring by , was dedicated on November 1, 1841. Father Augustin Ravoux later enlarged the structure, and when Joseph Crétin was appointed as the bishop of the newly established Diocese of St. Paul in July 1851, the log chapel became the first cathedral. Crétin immediately started to build a larger church to serve the fast-growing population of St. Paul. The second church building had three stories, with a library, kitchen, and school facilities on the first floor; the church itself on the second floor; and offices and living quarters for Crétin and his staff. The second building still proved to be too small for the needs of the diocese, so he started plans for a third cathedral in 1853. Construction of the building, at the corner of St. Peter and Sixth Streets in Downtown St. Paul, started in 1854 and was completed in 1858, having been delayed by the Panic of 1857 and Crétin&#x27;s death. The third cathedral was built of stone, measured long and wide, but had practically no ornamentation in an effort to cut costs. Thomas Grace was the bishop at the time the cathedral was completed.

== Current building ==

The building of the current cathedral was instigated by Archbishop John Ireland in 1904. The site was formerly occupied by the deteriorating mansion of entrepreneur Norman Kittson. Charles H.F. Smith (the head of the Finance Committee) and Alpheus Beede Stickney, two businessmen in St. Paul, purchased the land and donated it to the archdiocese. At Ireland&#x27;s direction, the archdiocese commissioned well-known French Beaux-Arts architect Emmanuel Louis Masqueray, who was also the chief architect of the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair in St. Louis, Missouri, and construction began in 1906. He had a budget of $1 million, and he based the cathedral on the designs of French churches of Périgueux Cathedral at Périgueux and Sacre-Coeur basilica in Paris, as well as French Renaissance and Classical themes.

Masqueray&#x27;s open design allows visitors unobstructed views of the altar and pulpit. Masqueray died in 1917, having completed only a few designs for the interior, which included three of the cathedral&#x27;s major chapels: Saint Peter&#x27;s, Saint Joseph&#x27;s and the Blessed Virgin Mary&#x27;s.

In 1987 the cathedral acquired five bronze bells cast in France. The copper dome was renovated in 2002.

In 2013, in conjunction with the restoration of the cathedral&#x27;s Æolian-Skinner organ by Quimby Pipe Organs, a new organ case was completed by architect Duncan G Stroik. The hand-carved walnut organ case preserves the view of the cathedral&#x27;s rose window. Human-sized carved angels stand on both sides of the organ case and a statue of Saint Cecilia, patron saint of music, stands on top of the central organ case dome, directly below the rose window.
The cathedral is normally open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. seven days a week. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It is also a contributing property to the Historic Hill District. On March 25, 2009, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops declared the Cathedral of Saint Paul to be a National shrine – the first in Minnesota and the only one in North America dedicated to the Apostle Paul. The cathedral is now also known as the National Shrine of the Apostle Paul.

The cathedral was visited by Eugenio Pacelli two years before his election to the Papacy in 1939.

Nearby Catholic high schools Saint Thomas Academy, Cretin-Derham Hall, and Hill-Murray School use the Cathedral every year for their graduation services.

=== Design ===

The dome of the cathedral is in diameter and high. Warm-colored paint and gold leaf were added during a major renovation of the dome in the 1950s. The exterior walls of the cathedral are Rockville granite from St. Cloud, Minnesota (from the Clark quarry). The interior walls are American Travertine from Mankato, Minnesota. The interior columns are made of several types of marble.

The interior is illuminated by twenty-four stained glass windows featuring angelic choirs. There is also a rose window in the transept designed by Charles Connick. Electric lighting was installed in 1940.

Heroic size marble statues of the four evangelists, sculpted by John Angel, are set into the niches of the piers in the four corners of the church. This placement was not coincidental, according to Msgr. Lawrence Ryan (Historical Sketch of the Cathedral of St. Paul, 1904–1937), for as the piers hold up the church of stone, so the Word recorded by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John sustains that Church not made by human hands. Each statue rises to a height of 11’6” and weighs eight tons. The life of Saint Paul is honored by a bronze baldachin, as well as massive bronze Te Deum and Magnificat grilles. The cathedral also has six chapels dedicated to the patron saints of the European ethnic groups that settled the area around the city: St. Anthony for the Italians, St. John the Baptist for the French Canadians, St. Patrick for the Irish, St. Boniface for the Germans, Saints Cyril and Methodius for the Slavs; and St. Therese of Lisieux for the missionaries.

There are also chapels dedicated to the Sacred Heart, to Mary, the mother of Jesus, and to Saint Joseph, her husband, as well as to Saint Peter.

<text>Mark Alan Butcher (born 23 August 1972) is an English cricket commentator and former English Test cricketer, who played county cricket for Surrey from 1992 until his retirement in 2009. He was a left-handed batsman, and occasional right-arm medium-pace bowler who was also capable of bowling off spin.

== Biography ==
He went to Cumnor House School in Purley from the age of five to thirteen before moving to Trinity School in Croydon. He first played for his school&#x27;s U-11 side at the age of seven. He was also picked up by the Surrey U-11 side and also was selected in Surrey&#x27;s U-19 team.

He married Alec Stewart&#x27;s sister Judy but the marriage did not last. He dealt with various personal issues especially in 2000 following the break up of his marriage and his axing from the England side at the end of 2000. He also had issues with alcohol and depression.

==Cricket career==
Butcher played all his county cricket for Surrey, for whom he made his first-class debut in 1992. He made his Test match debut in the first Test of the 1997 Ashes series at Edgbaston. He opened the batting on his debut test but did not produce the kind of scores that he would have liked but England managed to win that match by nine wickets albeit off a double century from Nasser Hussain. His last Test match was in December 2004, when he had played 71 Tests, making eight centuries and averaging over 34.

Butcher captained England once, in a draw with New Zealand in 1999 when Nasser Hussain was injured. He never appeared in a One Day International (ODI). Of players who have started in international cricket since the first ODI in 1970–71, Butcher is the &quot;runaway leader&quot; in terms of playing the most Test matches without appearing in an ODI. Butcher played in 71 Tests, but as of April 2004 no other player in the ODI era had played in more than 30 Tests without playing in an ODI.

Butcher enjoyed a reasonably good start to his Test career, hitting two half-centuries in five matches against a powerful Australian side. He then struggled (along with the rest of the England side) against the West Indies that winter, averaging just 15. However, in the next series he did very well, scoring two fifties and a century against South Africa. Though he followed that with another impressive hundred against Australia in the first Ashes Test that winter, he then failed for the rest of that series. A poor run of form followed, as he failed to score a half-century in twelve consecutive matches. Despite being appointed stand-in captain for one Test against New Zealand, he was dropped from the side in the winter of 2000. He subsequently lost his place in the Test side to Marcus Trescothick.

Butcher&#x27;s domestic form then suffered a dramatic decline, and he found himself languishing in the Surrey second eleven at the start of the 2001 English domestic season. However, hard work and coaching from his father, Alan, himself a former Surrey and England player, sorted out his form. He was drafted into the Test side to play the Australians and strong showings throughout that series culminated in a superb innings of 173 not out at Headingley, as England successfully chased 315 to win (although the series was by then lost).

After that series, Butcher continued to prosper until a run of injuries saw him lose his place. Consistent performances had made him an essential component of the England batting line-up, to be relied upon in a crisis. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the series in the West Indies in 2003–04, when he always batted well irrespective of the sometimes poor showing by various partners at the other end, and he passed fifty in four out of seven innings. He was the top runscorer for England in England&#x27;s emphatic series win in Caribbean by smacking 296 runs in four matches. A series of serious injuries kept Butcher out of the game for most of 2005, and his last Test was the first Test in South Africa in December 2004. The series of injury setbacks also subsequently put a dramatic end to his run of 42 successive test match appearances for England. During his illustrious yet volatile test career, he was regarded as one of the worst overnight resumers in test cricket as he often gets out quickly without adding much runs to his overnight score as he averages just 26.93 in 31 innings when it comes to starting the proceedings from overnight scores.

Thereafter, he struggled to recover properly from numerous injury set-backs, and although he retained the official captaincy of Surrey his appearances for the team became sporadic. In August 2009, Butcher announced his retirement from all first-class cricket after a troubling knee injury.

Since his retirement as a player, he has commentated on cricket for Sky Sports and has appeared as an expert summariser on Test Match Special, for Star Sports and ESPN Cricinfo. He appeared in Sky Sports documentary titled &quot;You Guys Are History&quot; where he explores and examines why there is a massive decline in black cricketers in England since the turn of the century.

He was awarded Honorary Life Membership of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in January 2010.

===Test centuries===

==Music career==

Butcher is also a guitar player and singer – he sang a ballad at Surrey and England teammate Ben Hollioake&#x27;s funeral. Previously, in 2001, he appeared on the &#x27;Jamie Theakston Cricket Show&#x27; on BBC Radio 5 Live, where he played a live acoustic version of &quot;(Get A) Grip (On Yourself)&quot; by The Stranglers with the former Stranglers&#x27; frontman Hugh Cornwell. In early 2008, Butcher started recording his debut album, &quot;Songs from the Sun House&quot;. Released in 2010, it includes &quot;You&#x27;re Never Gone&quot;, the song he wrote in tribute to Hollioake.

Mark Butcher partnered Sarah Brightman on the second series of &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot; aired on BBC One in January 2007; they came third overall.

==Personal life==

He was born to a Jamaican mother and an English father.

Butcher attended Cumnor House Prep School, Trinity School and Archbishop Tenison&#x27;s School in Croydon, and supports the local football team, Crystal Palace.

At one time during his playing career, Butcher was married to former England and Surrey teammate Alec Stewart&#x27;s sister Judy. Surrey&#x27;s former coach and player, Alan Butcher, is his father, and his brother, Gary, played for Glamorgan and Surrey.

<doc id="896392" wikidata="Q678379" url="?curid=896392" title="Mark Boucher">
<text>Mark Verdon Boucher (born 3 December 1976) is a South African cricket coach and former cricketer who played all three formats of the game. Boucher is regarded as one of the best wicket-keeper batsmen of all time, and holds the record for the most Test dismissals by a wicket-keeper, with 532 catches and 555 total dismissals. Boucher was a member of the South Africa team that won the 1998 ICC KnockOut Trophy, the only time the country has won an ICC trophy till date.

He has represented Border, Warriors, South Africa, Africa XI, ICC World XI and Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League.

He had been a regular feature of the South African side since the 1997/1998 tour to Australia, until his retirement from international cricket in July 2012 after a serious eye injury against Somerset.

In 2021, during the Cricket South Africa&#x27;s (CSA) Social Justice and Nation Building (SJN) transformation public hearings, Paul Adams claimed under oath that Mark Boucher and other teammates racially abused him by calling him a &quot;brown shit&quot; in a team song.

==Early life==
Born in East London, Boucher was educated at Selborne College where he was coached by Richard Pybus.

==International career==
===Wicket-keeping role===
From the time he replaced Dave Richardson until his retirement, Boucher was South Africa&#x27;s first-choice wicketkeeper and is widely regarded as one of, if not the, greatest wicketkeepers South Africa has ever had. He holds the record for the most dismissals (catches and stumpings) in Test cricket. He reached the record originally when he overtook the former Australian wicketkeeper Ian Healy in the first test of the Bank Alfalah Test Series versus Pakistan in Karachi on 3 October 2007 when he stumped Umar Gul off the bowling of Paul Harris. He then lost the record to Adam Gilchrist before regaining it when he caught Mushfiqur Rahim of Bangladesh in February 2008.

Boucher is also third on the all-time list in One Day Internationals.

===Batting credentials===
He once held the record for the highest score by a nightwatchman in Test cricket with 125 for South Africa v Zimbabwe at Harare in November 1999. On 12 March 2006 he hit the winning runs for South Africa against Australia in what had been the Greatest One Day International ever played.

Later in 2006, on 20 September, he made his maiden ODI century, hitting an unbeaten 147 against Zimbabwe from a mere 68 balls. His hundred came up off just 44 balls, the second-fastest ODI century ever by a South African after AB de Villiers. Boucher did benefit, however, from some very poor Zimbabwean fielding, being dropped no fewer than six times during his innings. He played over one hundred consecutive ODIs for his country and is one of only eleven players, including Hansie Cronjé and Shaun Pollock, to achieve this.

In February 2007 he and Jacques Kallis combined to hit Mohammad Asif for 28 runs off an over in an ODI at SuperSport Park in Centurion. It broke the South African record for most runs off an over which was previously held by both Shaun Pollock and Graeme Smith with 27. However, this was later broken by Herschelle Gibbs with 36 runs off one over, the most possible without no-balls or wides.

===Vice captaincy===
In the period while the team was under Shaun Pollock&#x27;s leadership, Boucher was the regular vice-captain of the team and lead the team in tests four times. These matches include a victory over Australia, an achievement which Pollock could not manage.

===Breaking records===
Boucher started his 2007 Cricket World Cup campaign in good form with a 21-ball half-century, the then fastest in World Cup history (before being beaten by Brendon McCullum&#x27;s 20-ball effort six days later) – scoring 75 not out against the Netherlands as South Africa scored 353 for 4 wickets in a rain-shortened World Cup match. However, this was overshadowed by Herschelle Gibbs&#x27;s six sixes in an over, the 3rd time ever in world cricket and the first time in a One Day International match, and thus in the World Cup.

He became the first wicketkeeper in the history of test cricket to reach the milestone of 400 dismissals when he caught Danish Kaneria off the bowling of Makhaya Ntini on 10 October 2007 in the second test of the Bank Alfalah Test Series against Pakistan at Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore.

Despite being South Africa&#x27;s consistent wicket-keeper for a long time, age meant that batsman AB de Villiers was given a chance with the gloves and he impressed. However, de Villiers is one of the team&#x27;s best outfielders and therefore Boucher continued to feature in the team.

He participated in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 and the South African coach Corrie van Zyl said that both Boucher and Herschelle Gibbs have the chance to get back in the team. He stated that Boucher will get his chance in the team provided that he performs in the domestic ODI tournament and that both of them had a good chance in playing for the 2011 Cricket World Cup He was however still selected for the Test series against Pakistan and continues to be South Africa&#x27;s number one test wicket-keeper Also during that time Boucher recovered from his six-week shoulder injury and stated that he is desperate for a return to international cricket. He stated that his main aim was to participate in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.

===Eye injury and subsequent retirement===
Boucher suffered a serious eye injury on 9 July 2012, after being struck on his left eye by a bail. He was not wearing a protective helmet or glasses when he was struck by the bail after leg-spinner Imran Tahir bowled Somerset&#x27;s Gemaal Hussain. Following surgery to the eyeball, Boucher was ruled out of the rest of the tour. Due to the severity of the injury, Boucher—who had planned to retire at the end of the tour—retired from International Cricket on 10 July.

There was no damage to the retina, so it was felt that there was a chance for Boucher to recover some vision in the damaged eye. After undergoing two operations on his injured eye, surgeons announced that they were &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot;.

==Coaching==
Boucher was appointed head coach of the Titans in August 2016, despite having no prior coaching experience. He led the Titans to five domestic titles - two One Day Cups, two T20 Challenge titles and one four-day Sunfoil Series trophy.

In December 2019, Boucher was appointed as head coach of the South Africa national cricket team.

In September 2022, Boucher was appointed as head coach of Mumbai Indians. He was replaced as head coach after the 2024 Indian Premier League season in which Mumbai finished bottom of the table.

==Honours==
Tributes included comments from Shaun Pollock and Kevin Pietersen. Pollock congratulated him on a great career, while Pietersen called for more support from fans and those involved in sports, saying &quot;Let’s keep it going! Bouch is a fighter!&quot;.

In May 2017, he was named Coach of the Year at Cricket South Africa&#x27;s annual awards.

* South Africa Player of the Year 1998
* South Africa Player of the Year 2000
* South Africa Player of the Year 2006
* Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2009

==Achievements==
* Holds the record for the most dismissals as wicketkeeper in all forms of international cricket (998).
* Holds the record for the most catches taken by a wicketkeeper in all forms of international cricket (952).
* Holds the record for playing the most T20 innings without a career duck (76).
* Most byes conceded by a wicketkeeper in a T20I innings (15).
* He along with Justin Kemp set the record for the highest 6th wicket stand in ICC Champions Trophy history (131).

==Controversy==
On 23 August 2021, Boucher issued an apology for past racist behaviour, admitting to having participated in activities that were discriminatory and racially offensive. Boucher admitted to having been part of a group that sang offensive songs and used racial nicknames for non-Caucasian teammates. In the wake of the admission and apology, there were calls for Boucher to resign or be sacked as head coach of the South African Cricket team. Despite handing over a written submission as an apology for his conduct, some say that Boucher lacks common sense, lacks sensitivity and has a &quot;lack of understanding of South Africa&#x27;s racial history&quot;. The allegations regarding his racist conduct have also raised eyebrows over his coaching tenure with the South African side in the future, due to the possibility of the CSA terminating his contract.

Further investigations revealed that Boucher influenced the team&#x27;s culture by dealing only with white players concerns regarding the Black Lives Matter movement and it was evident during the course of the 2021 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup, with a minor few players on the South African side refusing to take a knee before the start of play. Boucher was also accused of having maintained poor player management during his coaching tenure with the assistant coach Enoch Nkwe. He was accused in the charge sheet for not delegating tasks to Nkwe as well as for not giving proper clarification to Nkwe which made it impossible for Nkwe to work with Boucher. In May 2022, Cricket South Africa (CSA) withdrew charges against him.

<doc id="896394" wikidata="Q3377878" url="?curid=896394" title="Peyton Place (novel)">
<text>Peyton Place is a 1956 novel by the American author Grace Metalious. Set in New England in the time periods before and after World War II, the novel tells the story of three women who are forced to come to terms with their identity, both as women and as sexual beings, in a small, conservative, gossipy town. Metalious included recurring themes of hypocrisy, social inequities and class privilege in a tale that also includes incest, abortion, adultery, lust and murder. The novel sold 60,000 copies within the first ten days of its release, and it remained on &quot;The New York Times&quot; best seller list for 59 weeks.

The novel spawned a franchise that would run through four decades. 20th Century-Fox adapted it as a movie in 1957, and Metalious wrote a follow-up novel that was published in 1959, titled &quot;Return to Peyton Place,&quot; which became a film in 1961 using the same name. The original 1956 novel was adapted again in 1964, in what became a prime time television series for 20th Century Fox Television that ran until 1969, and the term &quot;Peyton Place&quot; entered the American lexicon describing any small town or group that holds scandalous secrets.

A daytime soap opera titled &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot; ran from 1972 to 1974, and the franchise had two made-for-television movies: &quot;Murder in Peyton Place&quot; and &quot;Peyton Place: The Next Generation&quot; in 1977 and 1985 respectively.

==Background==
Grace Metalious and her husband George first considered Potter Place, the name of a real community near Andover, New Hampshire. Realizing their town should have a fictional name, they looked through an atlas and discovered the community of Payton, Texas. They combined that with Place and changed the &quot;a&quot; to an &quot;e&quot;. Thus, &quot;Peyton Place&quot; was created, prompting her comment, &quot;Wonderful—that&#x27;s it, George. Peyton Place. Peyton Place, New Hampshire. Peyton Place, New England. Peyton Place, USA. Truly a composite of all small towns where ugliness rears its head, and where the people try to hide all the skeletons in their closets.&quot; Novelist Barbara Delinsky, author of the fictional &quot;Looking for Peyton Place&quot; (2006), noted that, &quot;The town is a character itself, a seductively beautiful facade that hides a plethora of ills...&quot;

Several characters and events were drawn from events in nearby towns and people that Metalious actually knew. Selena Cross was based on Barbara Roberts, a 20-year-old girl from the village of Gilmanton Ironworks, who murdered her father Sylvester after years of sexual abuse and buried his body under a sheep pen. In the novel, Selena kills her stepfather because incest was considered too taboo for readers at the time. Metalious&#x27; editor Kitty Messner made the change, much to the author&#x27;s dismay and disapproval.

==Plot==
The story starts in 1937 and continues through the years following World War II.

Lonely and repressed Constance MacKenzie leaves Peyton Place for New York City at a young age and meets a man in the fabrics business named Allison MacKenzie, who already is married with children. Constance becomes pregnant with MacKenzie&#x27;s child. MacKenzie dies a few years after his daughter, also named Allison, is born. Constance and her daughter adopt Allison&#x27;s last name before returning to Peyton Place as a &quot;widow&quot; and child, and Constance alters her daughter&#x27;s birth date to make her appear legitimate. With the money she&#x27;s saved as well as what she received from her late lover&#x27;s will, she opens up an apparel store called the Thrifty Corner. Allison grows up lonely and isolated, idealizing the father she never had and dreaming of a future as a published author.

The poorer side of Peyton Place is represented by the Cross family, Nellie and Lucas Cross and their daughter Selena, who is Nellie&#x27;s biological daughter, but not Lucas&#x27;s. Paul, Lucas&#x27;s son and Selena&#x27;s stepbrother, left Peyton Place after accusing Lucas of stealing his money. Nellie and Lucas later have a child together: Joey, who lives with the couple and Selena in &quot;the shacks&quot;, a poor section of town being targeted for redevelopment. Selena and Allison become friends, but the drastic difference in their socioeconomic situations ensures the friendship does not last long.&quot;While Allison wants Selena to share her love of bucolic little spots like Road&#x27;s End, Selena wants only to spend time at Allison&#x27;s mother&#x27;s dress shop and, increasingly, to talk with boys. Moreover, when Allison finally gets a look inside the shack where Selena lives, she is horrified by the squalor and the violence she sees in Lucas. Eventually, Allison and Selena grow distant because of Selena&#x27;s closeness with Ted Carter.&quot;When Selena turns 14 years old, Lucas begins to abuse her, impregnating her and leaving local doctor Matthew Swain in a troublesome situation in which he decides to perform an abortion. The doctor makes Lucas leave town, and after she discovers this, Nellie commits suicide by hanging.

Other storylines follow Leslie Harrington, owner of the local woolen mills, whose son Rodney dies in a car accident, as well as newspaper man Seth Buswell.

==Adaptations and character portrayals==
&quot;Peyton Place&quot; was first adapted as a film in 1957 and entirely recast for its 1961 sequel &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot;. It was followed by the soap operas &quot;Peyton Place&quot; (1964–1969) and &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot; (1972–1974), and the made-for-television movies &quot;Murder in Peyton Place&quot; (1977) and &quot;Peyton Place: The Next Generation&quot; (1985).

<text>Peyton Place is a 1957 American drama film starring Lana Turner, Hope Lange, Lee Philips, Lloyd Nolan, Diane Varsi, Arthur Kennedy, Russ Tamblyn, and Terry Moore. Directed by Mark Robson, it follows the residents of a small fictional New England mill town in the years surrounding World War II, where scandal, homicide, suicide, incest, and moral hypocrisy belie its tranquil façade. It is based on Grace Metalious&#x27;s bestselling 1956 novel of the same name.

Released in December 1957, &quot;Peyton Place&quot; was a major box-office success, though its omission of the novel&#x27;s sexually explicit material was widely criticized. The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It won none, tying the record set by &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; for most nominations with no wins.

==Plot==

In the New England town of Peyton Place, Paul Cross, fed up with his alcoholic stepfather, Lucas Cross, for his stealing, leaves town. Lucas is the school custodian and his downtrodden wife, Nellie, works as housekeeper for Constance &quot;Connie&quot; MacKenzie, a widow who owns a clothing shop. The daughters of both families, Allison MacKenzie and Selena Cross, are best friends and about to graduate from high school. While the MacKenzies live a comfortable life, the Cross family lives in poverty.

At Peyton Place High School, town newcomer Michael Rossi has been hired as the new principal by school board president Leslie Harrington; the students had favored veteran teacher Elsie Thornton. Rossi wins Ms. Thornton over by offering to work with her.

Connie allows Allison to have an unchaperoned birthday party. She invites her classmates, including the overtly sexual Betty Anderson and her boyfriend, Rodney Harrington. Connie is horrified to arrive home and find the teens, including Allison, making out. The next morning, Allison goes to meet Selena for church. She witnesses and then intervenes during an altercation between Lucas and Selena.

Allison is named class valedictorian, and Rossi asks Connie to help chaperone the graduation dance; the two gradually develop a romantic relationship. Meanwhile, Harrington disapproves of his son, Rodney, dating Betty. Rodney then invites Allison to the dance, though she likes Norman Page, a shy, bookish boy raised by an emotionally abusive mother. During the dance, Rodney takes Betty to his car and tries to make out with her, but she remains angry that Rodney broke up with her. Rossi asks Ms. Thornton to give a short speech and lead the song &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;. This annoys Marion Partridge, a member of the school board and a malicious gossip.

Shortly after, Lucas rapes and impregnates Selena. She goes to Dr. Matthew Swain. He assumes Selena&#x27;s boyfriend, Ted, is the father, but Selena breaks down and admits Lucas raped her. Furious, Dr. Swain forces Lucas to sign a confession that he will keep secret if Lucas permanently leaves town. Unknown to either, Nellie overhears their conversation. A vengeful Lucas chases Selena when she returns home. Selena escapes but falls, starting a miscarriage. Dr. Swain records it as an appendectomy to protect Selena from scandal.

At the Labor Day parade, Rodney and Betty make up and go skinny dipping; nearby, Allison and Norman are also swimming, wearing bathing suits. When Marion and Charles Partridge see a naked couple, they believe it is Allison and Norman and tell Connie. During an ensuing argument with Allison, Connie angrily blurts out that Allison is illegitimate, the result of an affair she had with Allison&#x27;s still living and already-married father. Upset, Allison runs upstairs, only to find that Nellie, distraught over Lucas, has committed suicide. Some time later, Rodney and Betty elope, infuriating Rodney&#x27;s father, who nevertheless offers his son a job at the mill. Bitter at her mother, Allison leaves home for New York City.

When World War II breaks out, many of Peyton Place&#x27;s young men enlist. When Rodney is killed in action, his bereaved father finally accepts Betty as family after she explains she only acted racy to attract Rodney. During Christmas 1942, Connie visits Rossi and admits her affair. Rossi still wants to marry her.

A drunken Lucas returns to town and attempts to rape Selena again. She bludgeons him to death in self-defense, then she and her younger brother, Joey, hide the body. After Easter 1943, Selena breaks down and tells Connie that she killed Lucas. After Connie reports Selena to the police, Selena is arrested and tried. Allison returns for the trial, as does Norman. The truth about Selena killing Lucas in self-defense, his physical and sexual abuse, and Dr. Swain&#x27;s false medical report all come to light. Dr. Swain openly berates the townspeople for their constant vicious gossip and rumors. Selena is acquitted and the town sympathetically reaches out to her; she and Ted are free to marry. Allison approaches Connie, wanting to reconcile; Norman is welcomed into the house.

==Cast==

Cast notes
* Both Diane Varsi and Lee Philips made their film debuts in &quot;Peyton Place&quot;.
* The film marked the first time that David Nelson had appeared separately from his family, Ozzie, Harriet, and Ricky.
* Erin O&#x27;Brien-Moore, who played Mrs. Evelyn Page, played Nurse Esther Choate in the 1960s &quot;Peyton Place&quot; TV series.

==Production==
===Development===
Less than a month after the novel&#x27;s release in October 1956, producer Jerry Wald bought the rights from author Grace Metalious for $250,000 and hired her as a story consultant on the film, though he had no intention of allowing her to contribute anything to the production. Her presence in Hollywood ensured the project additional publicity, but Metalious soon felt out of place there. &quot;I regarded the men who made &quot;Peyton Place&quot; as workers in a gigantic flesh factory,&quot; she recalled, &quot;and they looked upon me as a nut who should go back to the farm.&quot;

The screenplay, by John Michael Hayes, omits many of the novel&#x27;s sexually explicit moments, because Hayes was working under the Hays Code, which restricted depictions of content the U.S. Motion Picture Production Code deemed explicit.

Mark Robson said the script &quot;went through at least eleven drafts. The first one I read was about two hundred and sixty pages. While it was imperfect, and structurally wrong, still one could see that it was possible—with hard work—to pull it together. Jerry was tireless, and John Michael Hayes worked extremely hard; on a weekend he would rewrite a whole script. The final screenplay was written on the stage as the film was actually being made.&quot;

Metalious was horrified by what she deemed a sanitized version of her novel, and was also displeased with the thought of the casting of Pat Boone as Norman Page (the role was eventually given to Russ Tamblyn). She returned to her home in Gilmanton, New Hampshire, and publicly derided the film, though she eventually earned a total of $400,000 in exhibition profits from it.

===Filming===
Principal photography of &quot;Peyton Place&quot; began on June 4, 1957. The film&#x27;s exterior sequences were shot primarily in mid-coastal Maine, mostly in Camden, Maine, with additional exteriors filmed in Belfast, Maine; Rockland, Maine; Thomaston, Maine; and Lake Placid, New York. Additional interior photography was completed on film sets in Los Angeles. All of Turner&#x27;s scenes were shot in California.

===Musical score===
The film&#x27;s score is by Franz Waxman, and was recorded by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. The score was released on CD for the first time in 1999. In 2016, journalist Graydon Carter praised the score as &quot;haunting&quot; and &quot;instantly recognizable even today.&quot; In 2005, the American Film Institute recognized the score in its 100 Years of Film Scores, for which it received a nomination.

;Track listing
==Release==
===Box office===
The film premiered in Camden one day before opening in 24 cities across the U.S. on December 12, 1957.

&quot;Peyton Place&quot; was the second highest-grossing film released in the United States in 1957, and received significant public interest in April 1958, after Lana Turner&#x27;s daughter, Cheryl, killed Turner&#x27;s abusive boyfriend, Johnny Stompanato, during a domestic struggle. Though Cheryl was acquitted on the grounds of justifiable homicide, the press coverage boosted ticket sales for &quot;Peyton Place&quot; by 32% in April 1958. The film ultimately earned $11 million in domestic rentals ().

===Critical reception===
&quot;Peyton Place&quot; was a commercial hit, but many critics noted that the most salacious elements of Metalious&#x27;s novel had been whitewashed or excised completely. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther wrote, &quot;There is no sense of massive corruption here&quot;, but he did like the film overall, praising Hope Lange&#x27;s &quot;gentle and sensitive performance&quot; and finding Lloyd Nolan &quot;excellent.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;impressively acted by an excellent cast&quot; but noted that &quot;in leaning backwards not to offend, Wald and Hayes have gone acrobatic ... On the screen is not the unpleasant sex-secret little town against which Grace Metalious set her story. These aren&#x27;t the gossiping, spiteful, immoral people she portrayed. There are hints of this in the film, but only hints.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;While the four-letter words of the Grace Metalious novel have been adroitly erased, it&#x27;s easy for one of the apparent few who didn&#x27;t read the book to see why so many did. There are several strong stories and the characters are sharply drawn. Without these two characteristics the best written novels remain unread.&quot; Edwin Schallert of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;probably the most powerful small-town picture ever produced&quot; and &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; praised it as &quot;an absorbing adult drama&quot; that &quot;grips one&#x27;s attention the whole time it is on the screen, thanks to the sensitive direction and the effective acting of the capable cast.&quot; Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic wrote, &quot;The film is better than the book.&quot;

John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that the film &quot;makes no attempt to exploit the sensational aspects of the tale it has to tell; on the contrary, it is woefully diffuse, and before it&#x27;s over—roughly, three hours—boredom has set in like the grippe.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;Slick and passionless, the film is an expensive and heavily bowdlerised adaptation of Grace Metalious&#x27; best-seller&quot;, adding that &quot;the film never quite makes up its mind whether to extol small-town America or castigate it.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; wrote, &quot;This is the kind of hypertensive trash that gives melodrama a bad name, cynically tempering its naughty bits with smug moralizing. The fact that the film won an &#x27;A&#x27; rating from the Catholic Legion of Decency, meaning it was deemed &#x27;acceptable to all,&#x27; is a dead giveaway.&quot; (In actuality, it was given an &quot;A-III&quot; rating, meaning appropriate only for adults.)

In the years since its release, critics have continued to comment on the film&#x27;s sterilized screenplay, though Graydon Carter wrote in 2016, &quot;Despite the movie&#x27;s almost picture-postcard tone of whimsy, it did manage to retain some of Grace&#x27;s finger-pointingmost notably in a stunning montage of duplicitous citizens filing into a myriad of churches, all dressed in their Sunday best.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film received nine Academy Award nominations and no wins, tying a record set by &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;. This was later surpassed by &quot;The Turning Point&quot; and &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, both of which received 11 nominations and no wins.

===Home media===
20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released &quot;Peyton Place&quot; on DVD in 2004, featuring an audio commentary by Terry Moore and Russ Tamblyn, an AMC-produced documentary on the film, and vintage newsreel footage. The film had its debut on Blu-ray in 2017 by Twilight Time, in an edition limited to 3,000 copies. The Blu-ray repurposes the bonus materials from the 20th Century Fox DVD, and adds a new commentary by filmmaker and historian Willard Carroll.

==Sequels and spin-offs==
&quot;Peyton Place&quot; was followed up with a movie sequel, &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot;, then a TV series in 1961. A follow-up TV series, &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot;, was broadcast in 1972 but this was a follow-up to the earlier TV series and only loosely connected to the two movies.

<doc id="896396" wikidata="Q4756511" url="?curid=896396" title="Andy Caddick">
<text>Andrew Richard Caddick (born 21 November 1968) is a former cricketer who played for England as a fast bowler in Tests and ODIs. At 6 ft 5in, Caddick was a successful bowler for England for a decade, taking 13 five-wicket hauls in Test matches. He spent his entire English domestic first-class cricket career at Somerset County Cricket Club, and then played one Minor Counties match for Wiltshire in 2009.

==Early life==
Caddick was born in Christchurch, New Zealand to English parents, and educated at Papanui High School. As a youngster, he modelled his bowling action on that of Richard Hadlee. He appeared three times for New Zealand Young Cricketers, all of his appearances coming in February 1988.

His performances were unremarkable, the highlight being an unbeaten 20 with the bat and bowling figures of 1/16 off three overs in the first One Day International (ODI) against the touring India Under 19 team. In spite of his modest figures in the two matches against the Indians, he retained his place for the first match of the McDonald&#x27;s Bicentennial Youth World Cup. However, after struggling with 0/39 he lost his place, and did not appear for New Zealand again.

==Opportunity in England==
Frustration at what he saw as a lack of opportunities to be selected for the New Zealand Test side drove him to try his luck in England, something New Zealand captain Ken Rutherford would later rue, commenting that &quot;he slipped through the net and given our lack of depth we can ill afford to lose players like him&quot;. He played a handful of games for Middlesex Second XI in late 1988 and early 1989, taking 17 wickets in four matches for them at 26.71. On his Somerset Second XI debut in June 1989, Caddick took 8/46 in Surrey Second XI&#x27;s first innings.

He was restricted to playing in the Second XI Championship for the 1990 and 1991 seasons, as Jimmy Cook was the club&#x27;s overseas player and Caddick had yet to serve his four years to qualify as an English player. In spite of this, he made his first-class debut for Somerset against the West Indians in May 1991, but his only further match of the season was against the touring Sri Lankans in the August.

==Domestic career==
His County Championship debut and breakthrough came in the 1992 season, with Caddick immediately amongst the wickets, taking 4/96 against Gloucestershire. Later in the season, he took his maiden 10 wicket haul against Kent, and finished the season with a respectable 71 wickets at 27.01. He impressed the right people and was rewarded with his county cap, and a place in the England A squad touring Australia. He shone on the tour, finishing with a first-class bowling average of 28.60, by far the best on the England team. A strong start to the following season, including a career best 9/32 in the second innings of a match against Lancashire, saw him called up to the Test and one-day squads for the 1993 Ashes series.

===Period of uncertainty===

Injuries plagued Caddick through the 1994 and 1995 seasons, limiting his appearances for Somerset and keeping him out of the England squad altogether. He was initially hampered with a shoulder injury, and then with recurring shin issues that for a time threatened to finish his career completely. When he did play, he showed his class, taking 6/70 against Nottinghamshire, and 6/51 against Durham in the space of a few weeks. In his final match of the 1995 season, he hit his highest total with the bat, 92 against Worcestershire.

The start of the 1996 season saw him back to full fitness and in irresistible form. He claimed a five-fer in each innings against Warwickshire to take his first of three 10 wicket hauls for the season, the next coming only two matches later against Worcestershire. These figures, along with his general good form saw him recalled to the England team for the second Test against Pakistan. He took three wickets in each innings to give him match figures of 6/165, and could consider himself unlucky to be dropped immediately after. He finished off his season with 10 wickets against Sussex, once again claiming a five-fer in each innings.

===Later county career===
In 2007 Caddick, at the age of thirty-eight, finished the season as the leading English wicket-taker with 75 wickets at 23.10 as Somerset gained promotion from Division Two of the County Championship. That Christmas, Caddick underwent surgery on his back to correct pain he had felt during the final games of the season, and he rejoined training with Somerset in February 2008.

Somerset awarded Caddick benefit seasons in 1999 and in 2009. Also, in June 2009, he played one match for Wiltshire against Wales Minor Counties. In early August 2009, Caddick announced that he would be retiring from first-class cricket at the end of the season.

==International career==
===Debut years===
Making his debut in the first ODI of the 1993 Texaco Trophy series at Old Trafford, after an average display with the ball in which he took 1/50, Caddick arrived at the crease with 11 runs required to win. Four runs were added to the score prior to the final over, leaving Caddick and Richard Illingworth needing to score seven runs off the last over to secure the match for England. A leg bye reduced the target, but they still needed six from the last two balls. Facing the penultimate ball, Caddick stroked the ball to long leg and launched himself off for the single, turned and sprinted back for the second, only to find that Illingworth had remained in his crease. Illingworth was run out, and England lost by four runs. Caddick had no such excitement in the second ODI, as he was not required to bat, and failed to take any wickets on a batting track at Edgbaston. With the series already lost, Caddick found more joy in the third ODI, taking three wickets and helping to restrict the Australians to 230; a total England must have felt they could chase down. A batting collapse ensured that this would not be the case, and Australia took the series 3–0.

He found it difficult to penetrate the Australians batting line up through the Test series and, in a tough series for England, he flourished only through one session at Trent Bridge. He was eventually dropped for the fifth and sixth Ashes Tests. Returning to Somerset, he took three five-fers in the final two months of the season.

Caddick was not to be out of the England side for long, as he was named in the squad to tour the West Indies. He shone in the third Test at Queen&#x27;s Park Oval, where he took 6/65 in the West Indies second innings, although this was overshadowed when England were bowled out for just 46 in their second innings, with Curtly Ambrose taking 11 wickets in the match. He also managed 5/63 in the second innings of the fourth Test at Kensington Oval, although he was yet again overshadowed, this time by Alec Stewart scoring centuries in both England innings&#x27; and Angus Fraser&#x27;s 8/75 in the first innings. Caddick did however finish the series as England&#x27;s leading Test wicket taker, with 18 wickets to his name.

===Second international spell===
In the winter of 1996–97, Caddick found himself rather more permanently back in the England set-up, touring Zimbabwe and New Zealand. Caddick&#x27;s involvement in Zimbabwe was limited to two warm up matches, with his performances described by one newspaper as akin to &quot;a camel loping into one of the hot dry harmattans that blow off the Kalahari&quot;. He thus travelled to his native New Zealand with a point to prove. He again failed to shine during the warm up matches, and was left out again for the first Test. His chance to prove his critics wrong came in the second Test, and he seemed to take it with a menacing streak to his game, snatching four wickets in the first innings and a further two in the second. He retained his place for the third Test and the majority of the One Day International series, and along with Darren Gough was one of the stand out bowlers of the tour.

Caddick took 24 wickets in five tests in the 1997 Ashes series. As of 2022, since 1985 only Graeme Swann has taken more wickets for England in an Ashes series. However, like most England players of his generation, Caddick would never play for a team that won the Ashes.

Playing against the West Indies in 2000, Caddick became one of only four bowlers ever to take four wickets in a single six-ball over, as England beat the West Indies in a series for the first time since 1969.

Caddick took his first Test match ten-wicket haul in the Test at Sydney in 2003. However, due to injury and falling out of favour, this proved to be last Test match. He would not appear for England again after the Cricket World Cup 2002–3.

==Post-retirement life==
Caddick is a qualified pilot, and works in aviation sales for a Devon based company.

<doc id="896399" wikidata="Q215250" url="?curid=896399" title="Gray fox">
<text>The gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), or grey fox, is an omnivorous mammal of the family Canidae, widespread throughout North America and Central America. This species and its only congener, the diminutive island fox (&quot;Urocyon littoralis&quot;) of the California Channel Islands, are the only living members of the genus &quot;Urocyon&quot;, which is considered to be genetically sister to all other living canids. Its species name &quot;cinereoargenteus&quot; means &quot;ashen silver&quot;.

It was once the most common fox in the eastern United States, and though still found there, human advancement and deforestation allowed the red fox to become the predominant fox-like canid. Despite this post-colonial competition, the gray fox has been able to thrive in urban and suburban environments, one of the best examples being southern Florida. The Pacific States and Great Lakes region still have the gray fox as their prevalent fox.

==Etymology==
The genus &quot;Urocyon&quot; comes from Ancient Greek οὐρά (ourá, “tail”) + κύων (kúōn, “dog”). The species epithet &quot;cinereoargenteus&quot; is a combination of &#x27;cinereo&#x27; (from &#x27;cinereus&#x27;) meaning ashen, and &#x27;argenteus&#x27; (from argentum), meaning &#x27;silver&#x27;, referencing the color of the tail.

==Description==
The gray fox is mainly distinguished from most other canids by its grizzled upper parts, black stripe down its tail and strong neck, ending in a black-tipped tail, while the skull can be easily distinguished from all other North American canids by its widely separated temporal ridges that form a &#x27;U&#x27;-shape. Like other canids, the fox&#x27;s ears and muzzle are angular and pointed. Its claws tend to be lengthier and curved.

There is little sexual dimorphism, save for the females being slightly smaller than males. The gray fox ranges from in total length. The tail measures of that length and its hind feet measure . The gray fox typically weighs , though exceptionally large individuals can weigh as much as . The gray fox is readily distinguished from the red fox by its obvious lack of the &quot;black stockings&quot; that stand out on the red fox. The grey fox has a stripe of black hair that runs along the middle of its tail, and individual guard hairs that are banded with white, gray, and black. The gray fox displays white on the ears, throat, chest, belly, and hind legs. Gray foxes also have black around their eyes, on the lips, and on their noses.
In contrast to the species in genus &quot;Vulpes&quot;, such as the red fox, the gray fox has oval (instead of slit-like) pupils. The gray fox also has reddish coloration on parts of its body, including the legs, sides, feet, chest, and back and sides of the head and neck. The stripe on the fox&#x27;s tail ends in a black tip as well. Its weight can be similar to that of a red fox, but the gray fox appears smaller because its fur is not as long and it has shorter limbs.

The dental formula of &quot;U. cinereoargenteus&quot; is = 42.

==Origin and genetics==

The gray fox appeared in North America during the mid-Pliocene (Hemphillian land animal age) epoch ago (AEO) with the first fossil evidence found at the lower 111 Ranch site, Graham County, Arizona with contemporary mammals like the giant sloth, the elephant-like &quot;Cuvieronius&quot;, the large-headed llama, and the early small horses of &quot;Nannippus&quot; and &quot;Equus.&quot; Faunal remains at two northern California cave sites confirm the presence of the gray fox during the late Pleistocene. Genetic analysis has shown that the gray fox migrated into the northeastern United States post-Pleistocene in association with the Medieval Climate Anomaly warming trend.

Genetic analyses of the fox-like canids confirmed that the gray fox is a distinct genus from the red foxes (&quot;Vulpes&quot; spp.). The genus &quot;Urocyon&quot; is considered to be sister to the other living canid taxa. Genetically, the gray fox often clusters with two other ancient lineages: The east Asian raccoon dog (&quot;Nyctereutes procyonoides&quot;) and the African bat-eared fox (&quot;Otocyon megalotis&quot;).

The chromosome number is 66 (diploid) with a fundamental number of 70. The autosomes include 31 pairs of sub-graded subacrocentrics, but one only pair of metacentrics.

Recent mitochondrial genetic studies suggests divergence of North American eastern and western gray foxes in the Irvingtonian mid-Pleistocene into separate sister taxa.
The gray fox&#x27;s dwarf relative, the island fox, is likely descended from mainland gray foxes. These foxes apparently were transported by humans to the islands and from island to island, and are descended from a minimum of 3–4 matrilineal founders.

==Distribution and habitat==

The species occurs throughout most rocky, wooded, brushy regions of the southern half of North America from southern Canada (Manitoba through southeastern Quebec) to the northern part of South America (Venezuela and Colombia), excluding the mountains of northwestern United States. The species prefers a mix of wooded and agricultural land in the Midwest, juniper forests as well as ponderosa pine in the west, and deciduous forests in the east. It is the only canid whose natural range spans both North and South America. In some areas, high population densities exist near brush-covered bluffs. The species prefers a mix of forest and agricultural land towards the southern part of their range (Belize ). In southeastern Mexico, the species prefers areas with a human presence such as near roads.

==Behavior==
The gray fox is specifically adapted to climb trees. Its strong, hooked claws allow it to scramble up trees to escape many predators, such as the domestic dog or the coyote, or to reach tree-bound or arboreal food sources. It can climb branchless, vertical trunks to heights of and jump from branch to branch. It descends primarily by jumping from branch to branch, or by descending slowly backwards like a domestic cat. The gray fox is primarily nocturnal or crepuscular and makes its den in hollow trees, stumps or appropriated burrows during the day. Such gray fox tree dens may be located above the ground. For the most part, they rest on the ground rather than higher up in trees.

Prior to European colonization of North America, the red fox was found primarily in boreal forest and the gray fox in deciduous forest. With the increase in human populations in North America, their habitat selection has adapted: Gray foxes that live near human populations tend to choose areas near hardwood trees, locations used primarily by humans, or roads to utilize as their habitat.

The increase of coyote populations around North America has reduced certain fox populations, so gray foxes have to choose a habitat that will allow them to escape the coyote threat as much as possible, hence the choice of habitat nearer to areas where humans are active. The larger predators of the gray fox, like coyotes and bobcats, tend to avoid human-use areas and paved roads, making this habitat useful for the gray fox. They heavily utilize the edges of forests as a travel corridor, which is used for primary movement from place to place. Their choices do not change based on sex, the season, or the time of day. They also do the majority of their hunting in edges, and use them to escape from predators as well. Gray foxes are thus known as an &quot;edge species&quot;.
== Interspecies competition ==

Gray foxes often hunt for the same prey as bobcats and coyotes who occupy the same region. To avoid interspecific competition, the gray fox has developed certain behaviors and habits to increase their survival chances. In regions where gray foxes and coyotes hunt for the same food, the gray fox has been observed to give space to the coyote, staying within its own established range for hunting. Gray foxes might also avoid their competitors by occupying different habitats from them. In California, gray foxes do this by living in chaparral where their competitors are fewer and the low shrubbery provides them a greater chance to escape from a dangerous encounter. It also has been suggested that gray foxes could be more active at night than during the day to avoid their larger, diurnal competitors.

Still, gray foxes frequently fall victim to bobcats and coyotes. When killed, the carcasses are often unconsumed, suggesting they are victims of intraguild predation. These gray foxes are often killed on or near the boundary of their established range, when they begin to interfere with their competitors. Gray foxes are known as mesopredators because they are mid-tier predators and their prey consists mostly of smaller mammals, while coyotes are known as de facto apex predators due to the removal of other apex predators, like wolves, in North America. This explains the gray fox&#x27;s tendency to change behavior in response to the coyote threat, as they are essentially lower on the food chain.

== Reproduction ==
The gray fox is assumed to be monogamous, like other foxes. The breeding season of the gray fox varies geographically; in Michigan, the gray fox mates in early March, in Alabama, breeding peaks occur in February. The gestation period lasts approximately 53 days. Litter size ranges from 1–7, with a mean of 3.8 young per female.
The sexual maturity of females is around 10 months of age. Kits begin to hunt with their parents at the age of 3 months. By the time that they are 4 months old, the kits will have developed their permanent dentition and can now easily forage on their own. The family group remains together until the autumn, when the young males reach sexual maturity, then they disperse. In a study of 9 juvenile gray foxes, only the males dispersed, moving up to . The juvenile females stayed within proximity of the den within and always returned. Adult gray foxes showed no signs of dispersion for either sex. The gray fox will typically live between six and ten years.

The annual reproductive cycle of males has been described through epididymal smears. They become fertile earlier and remain fertile longer than females.

Logs, trees, rocks, burrows, or abandoned dwellings serve as suitable den sites. Dens are used at any time during the year but mostly during whelping season. Dens are built in brushy or wooded regions and are better concealed than the dens of the red fox.

== Diet ==
The gray fox is an omnivorous, solitary hunter. It frequently preys on the eastern cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus floridanus&quot;) in the eastern U.S., though it will readily catch voles, shrews, and birds. In California, the gray fox primarily eats rodents (such as deer mice, woodrats, and cotton rats), followed by lagomorphs, e.g. jackrabbit, brush rabbit, etc. When it is available, gray foxes may also feed on carrion. In some parts of the Western United States (such as in the Zion National Park in Utah), the gray fox is primarily insectivorous and herbivorous. Fruit is an important component of the diet of the gray fox, and they seek whatever fruits are readily available, generally eating more vegetable matter than does the red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;). Generally, there is an increase in fruits and invertebrates (such as grasshoppers, beetles, butterflies, and moths) within the gray fox&#x27;s diet in the transition from winter to spring. As nuts, grains, and fruits become more numerous, they are cached by foxes. Typically, they attempt to cover the area with their scent either through their scent glands or urine. This marking serves the dual purpose of allowing them to find the food again later and preventing other animals from taking it.

== Ecosystem role ==
Since woodrats, cotton rats, and mice make up a large part of the gray fox&#x27;s diet, they serve as important regulators of small rodent populations.

In addition to their beneficial predation on rodents, gray foxes are also less welcome hosts to some external and internal parasites, which include fleas, lice, nematodes, and tapeworms. In the United States, the most common parasite of the gray fox is a flea (&quot;Pulex simulans&quot;); however, several new parasitic arthropods were found in populations in central Mexico, and a warming climate may encourage them to migrate north.

== Hunting ==
Gray foxes are hunted in the U.S. The intensity of the hunting has correlated with the value of their pelts. Between the 1970–1971 and 1975–1976 hunting seasons, the price of gray fox pelts greatly increased and the number of individuals hunted jumped over six-fold from 26,109 to 163,458. It has been recently reported that over 500,000 gray foxes are killed every year for their fur.

== Subspecies ==
There are 16 subspecies recognized for the gray fox.

==Parasites==
Parasites of gray fox include trematode &quot;Metorchis conjunctus&quot;. Other common parasites that were collected on gray foxes in Texas were a variety of tapeworms (&quot;Mesocestoides litteratus&quot;, &quot;Taenia pisiformis&quot;, &quot;Taenia serialis&quot;) and roundworms (&quot;Ancylostoma caninum&quot;, &quot;Ancylostoma braziliense&quot;, &quot;Haemonchus similis&quot;, &quot;Spirocerca lupi&quot;, &quot;Physaloptera rara&quot;, &quot;Eucoleus aerophilus&quot;). &quot;T. pisiformis&quot; was the most common parasite species and was associated with frequent impacts on health.

<text>Syed Inzamam-ul-Haq SI (; born 3 March 1970), also known as Inzi, is a former Pakistan cricketer and captain of Pakistan national cricket team. He is regarded as one of the greatest players Pakistan has produced and one of the best middle-order batsmen of all time. He was the former chief selector of the Pakistan cricket team before resigning in 2023. He was a part of the Pakistani squad which won the 1992 Cricket World Cup.

He was the leading run scorer for Pakistan in one-day internationals, and the third-highest run scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket. He is the only Pakistani batsman to score 20,000 runs in international cricket arena. He was the captain of the Pakistan national cricket team from 2003 to 2007. As well as being a prolific batsman, he also occasionally bowled gentle left-arm spin.

Inzamam rose to fame in the semi-final of the 1992 Cricket World Cup. He remained one of the team&#x27;s leading batsmen throughout the decade in both Test and ODI cricket. In 2003, he was appointed captain of the team. His tenure as captain ended after Pakistan&#x27;s early exit from the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Inzamam retired from international cricket in 2007, following the second Test match against South Africa, falling three runs short of Javed Miandad as Pakistan&#x27;s leading run scorer in Test cricket at the time. Following his retirement, he joined the Indian Cricket League, captaining the Hyderabad Heroes in the inaugural edition of the Twenty20 competition. In the ICL&#x27;s second edition, he captained the Lahore Badshahs, a team composed entirely of Pakistani cricketers.

Inzamam-ul-Haq is a prominent member of the Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic missionary organisation, and remains an influential personality in Pakistan cricket.

In April 2016, he was appointed the chief selector of the Pakistan national cricket team. In August 2023, he was again appointed chief selector of the Pakistan cricket team.

== Early and personal life ==

=== Family background ===
Inzamam-ul-Haq was born in Multan, Punjab, Pakistan, on 3 March 1970 into a Syed Sunni Muslim family. His family had moved from the city of Hansi in Punjab Province, British India (now in Haryana, India) during the partition of India.

The youngest of five siblings (four brothers and one sister), his Syed family was called pir for its historical involvement in Sufism and the preaching of Islam, descending from Jamal-ud-Din Hansvi, a scholar and poet who was from the lineage of Abu Hanifa and a direct disciple of the famous 12th-century Sufi poet Baba Farid. Inzamam&#x27;s grandfather, Pir Zia-ul-Haq, was also a famed religious figure. This background led him to embrace the Islamic way of life quite early in his own life.

His nephew Imam-ul-Haq also plays cricket for Pakistan.

=== Business ===
In 2010, Inzamam and Saeed Anwar started &quot;Meat One&quot;, a chain of specialty meat shops.

In 2017, Inzamam launched &quot;Legends of Inzamam ul Haq&quot;, a clothing store in Lahore.

== Domestic career ==

=== First-class cricket in Pakistan ===
Inzamam started his career playing for his hometown club, Multan, in 1985. He went on to represent United Bank Limited, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, National Bank of Pakistan, and Water and Power Development Authority in his homeland.

=== County cricket in England ===

Inzamam made his debut in English county cricket in August 2007 at the age of 37. He joined Yorkshire County Cricket Club as a replacement for Younus Khan who left to play for Pakistan in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20. He was disappointing on the whole, making eight on debut at Scarborough&#x27;s North Marine Road against Warwickshire before making nine and seven in his opening Pro40 games. He failed to transfer his international form into English county cricket.

=== ICL in India ===

In 2007, Inzamam joined the unsanctioned Indian Cricket League (ICL) which was highly controversial. In the inaugural competition, Inzamam captained the Hyderabad Heroes and scored 141 runs in 5 matches. In the 2008 competition in March, Inzamam captained the Lahore Badshahs, composed entirely of Pakistani cricketers.

The move to the ICL had proved to be a controversial one for Inzamam. The Pakistan Cricket Board&#x27;s stance on players joining unsanctioned leagues meant that he had been banned from playing in any domestic competitions in Pakistan or any involvement with the international team. However, given Inzamam had recently retired, it was unlikely to have affected him.

It is reported that he was paid Pakistani Rs. 100 million (US$1,100,000) which was the highest salary for any player participating in the league along with the likes of Brian Lara.

== International career ==
=== One Day International ===
Inzamam made his ODI debut in a home series against West Indies in 1991, and made a good start to his career by scoring 20 and 60 runs in two matches against West Indies. This was followed by 48, 60, 101, and 117 runs against Sri Lanka. Inzamam also had his name in record books early on when he took wicket of his 1st ball in ODI cricket when he got Brian Lara caught behind.

Handpicked by former Pakistan captain Imran Khan for the 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, 22-year-old Inzamam was relatively unheard of before the tournament. To the surprise of many he was persevered with throughout the tournament, coming in at various positions in the batting line-up, despite not being very successful early on. Yet it was his performances at the most crucial stage of the competition that made fans and summarisers take note. Inzamam rose to fame in Pakistan&#x27;s dramatic semi-final against New Zealand at Auckland. With his side in a precarious position, chasing 262 against an impressive New Zealand side, he hit a fiery 60 run innings from just 37 balls to rescue his side and guide them into the final. The innings was regarded as one of the finest World Cup performances. He hit a massive six in that match which was described by David Lloyd as the shot of the tournament.

Inzamam made an equally vital contribution in the final of the World Cup, scoring 42 runs off just 35 balls, helping Pakistan reach a score of 249 after a sluggish start. These innings established Inzamam&#x27;s billing as a big-game player, although he was unable to replicate his World Cup success in later tournaments.

Inzamam regard his best least highlighted innings of 90 not out against West Indies when Pakistan won their first ODI in the West Indies on 27 March 1993.

In total, Inzamam set a record for scoring the most half centuries in One Day Internationals, 83 – though this is now surpassed by Sachin Tendulkar, Jacques Kallis and Kumar Sangakkara. He also became the second batsman to score 10,000 runs in One-day Internationals (again after Tendulkar) and was named in the ICC World XI for both Tests and One-day Internationals in the 2005 ICC Awards. In his final ODI for Pakistan, playing against Zimbabwe in the 2007 Cricket World Cup, he took three catches whilst fielding, including the last one of the match, ending his One Day career.

=== Test ===

Inzamam made his Test debut in 1992 against England at Edgbaston. He had little opportunity to make an impact in that match – he was not out with a score of 8. However, in subsequent matches he demonstrated vulnerability against swing bowling which resulted in his being dropped for the final Test of the series after averaging a lowly 13.20 runs per innings. Pakistan went on to secure a famous win in the match, taking the series 2–1.

After the England series, Inzamam aimed to establish himself in the Test side and he achieved this brilliantly, helping his side to many memorable victories. One of particular note came against Australia in Karachi, 1994, when he made 58 not out with the tail and helped Pakistan to a one-wicket victory and a 1–0 series win. As well as helping his side to become the top-ranked side in the world for a brief period, he achieved personal success by becoming International Cricket Council&#x27;s number one ranked batsman in 1995. He later went on to reclaim top spot in the rankings in 1997. He remained amongst the top 20 ranked batsmen up until his retirement. He was the number one batsman in the world three times and held the title of the 3rd best batsman several times in his career including a long run from 2004 to 2006, the last time being after his twin fifties at Lords against England in 2006. The tour of England in 1996 was a particular success for both Inzamam and Pakistan, where Inzamam transformed his batting against seam bowling, averaging 64 runs per innings, with scores of 148, 70, 65, and 5.

His Test career highlights include 329 against New Zealand in Lahore in the 2001–02 season, which is the second highest Test score by a Pakistani and the twelfth highest overall. He also scored a century (184 runs) in his 100th Test, becoming only the fifth player to do so (after Colin Cowdrey, Alec Stewart, Gordon Greenidge and Javed Miandad; Ricky Ponting and Joe Root have subsequently emulated the feat). Inzamam made a century in each innings of the second Test match against England in 2005, to become Pakistan&#x27;s leading centurion with 24 centuries, breaking Javed Miandad&#x27;s record. His 25th century in the 2nd Test against India on 22 January 2006 made him the 10th player to score 25 or more centuries. He also managed 138 not out when the team was on the brink of a humiliating defeat against Bangladesh, eventually saving the Test match and leading his team to victory. His 92 not out against South Africa in late 2006 again showed his ability to bat in a crisis in a match winning manner. He scored twin half centuries when all appeared lost to draw the first test in Mohali against India in 2005, and also scored 184 runs in his 100th test match in the same away series causing the series to be drawn. He still holds the record for most consecutive half centuries against a country with nine in nine innings against England. This streak started from 31 May 2001 and lasted till 13 July 2006. He scored a century and a half century at Lords in 1996. His 118 against Australia in Hobart almost won the test for Pakistan but Adam Gilchrist&#x27;s match winning 149 not out made the difference. His average in matches won is second only to Donald Bradman and Kumar Sangakkara.

After announcing that he would retire after the second Test against South Africa, at the stadium where he made his international debut, Inzamam needed 20 runs to surpass Javed Miandad for the record of most runs for a Pakistani Test cricketer. After falling for 14 in the first innings, he was dismissed for 3 in his final innings by Paul Harris, out stumped, leaving him three runs shy of the record. He needed only 70 more career runs for a batting average of 50.

== Playing style ==

Helped by his 6&#x27;3&quot; frame, Inzamam was a very destructive batsman in both One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Test matches. He had the ability to pick the length of a delivery very early and play very late. His footwork was generally considered to be fast, enabling him to position himself early for shots. He averaged just under 50 runs per innings in Tests and nearly 40 runs in ODIs, with a strike rate of 54.03 and 74.23 respectively. Inzamam was especially strong when playing shots off his legs and was considered to be amongst the best exponents of the pull-shot in world cricket.&quot;&quot;

His batting style brought him fans from all over the world. He was called &quot;the best batsmen in the world against pace&quot; by Imran Khan, because &quot;he seems to have so much time on his hands before the ball reaches him&quot;.

Inzamam gained a reputation for being a rather poor runner between the wickets, having been involved in a number of comical run outs. He has the dubious distinction of being run out the second-highest number of times in ODIs, having been run out 40 times [behind Marvan Atapattu (41 times)].

== Captaincy ==

Inzamam captained Pakistan in 31 Tests, winning 11, drawing nine and losing ten. Only three players have captained Pakistan in more Test matches, but all have better win–loss records and only Imran Khan has a lower win percentage than Inzamam. The Oval Test match in 2006 was poised as a victory for Pakistan before the controversy took place, and had it not occurred it is likely that Inzamam&#x27;s record would have had one more win and one fewer loss. Notwithstanding his win–loss record, Inzamam held the captaincy until March 2007, the longest captaincy tenure since 1992 (when Imran Khan retired).

Captaincy had a positive effect on Inzamam&#x27;s batting, and he often led by example in pressure situations, averaging more as a captain (52) than when not (50). Inzamam also held the highest average as captain in ODIs and is currently third on that list behind the former Australian skipper Ricky Ponting and the Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. After early failures in Australia, he took a depleted Pakistan side to India in 2005 and played an important role in securing a draw by winning the final test match from an unlikely position with an innings of 184 runs. He subsequently led his side to an ODI success against West Indies (away), England (home) and Sri Lanka (away) as well as Test Series victories against England (home), India (home), Sri Lanka (away). Inzamam had seemed to have united the Pakistan side and victories led them to 2nd place in the ICC Test Rankings and 3rd place in the ICC ODI Ranking. The latter part of Inzamam&#x27;s tenure as Pakistan captain was less successful and the team was embroiled in many controversies culminating in a disappointingly early exit from the 2007 Cricket World Cup at the hands of lowly ranked Ireland.

In the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Inzamam captained the Pakistani team to its first loss to associate ICC member Ireland (on St Patrick&#x27;s Day). This result and their previous loss to West Indies, led to them being knocked out of the tournament. A day later he announced his retirement from One Day International Cricket and resignation as Test captain. The announcement was made the same day that Bob Woolmer, Pakistan&#x27;s coach, died in his hotel room in Kingston, Jamaica. He dedicated his final ODI to Woolmer to whom he shared a good relationship with for three years and affectionately called him &#x27;The Bob&#x27;.

In December 2012, Inzamam was appointed as a batting consultant to Pakistan&#x27;s national team on a short-term basis in preparation for the 2013 tour of India. In October 2015, he was appointed as the temporary head coach of the Afghanistan national cricket team for their tour of Zimbabwe in October 2015. His contract was then renewed until December 2016 after the successful tour of Zimbabwe where they won both the ODIs and T20Is which was Afghanistan&#x27;s first series win against a Test playing nation. However, in April 2016 with almost eight months in his contract remaining, he resigned as Afghanistan coach to become Pakistan chief selector.

As the coach of the Afghanistan cricket team, Afghanistan beat Zimbabwe again in the Group Stage of ICC World Twenty20, which helped them progress to the Super 10 stage. His team battled hard against Sri Lanka and South Africa but were unable to pull off a victory. In their final game of the tournament, they secured a victory against the table-topping West Indies.

On 7 August 2023, Inzamam was appointed chief selector of the Pakistan cricket team.

== Controversies ==

=== Toronto incident ===

In a 1997 Sahara Cup match against India in Toronto, Inzamam assaulted a member of the crowd, Shiv Kumar Thind, a Canadian-based Indian, who had been comparing Inzamam to several kinds of potato over a megaphone. According to eyewitnesses a cricket bat was brought out by the Pakistan team&#x27;s 12th man, Mohammad Hussain, who then waited at the boundary with the bat. Television replays confirmed those statements. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper quoted another eyewitness as saying &quot;If not for the spectators and security staff curbing him, he would have broken the head of that guy. The guy with the megaphone was no match for Inzamam and got mauled. Even when Canadian police took Inzamam back on to the field, he was trying to get back to the stands.&quot;

=== Oval Test incident ===

On Pakistan&#x27;s 2006 tour of England, Inzamam captained a team that refused to re-enter the field after tea, on 20 August 2006 at The Oval after allegations of ball tampering from umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove. The umpires had awarded England five penalty runs and the choice of a replacement ball, after ruling that Pakistan had illegally altered the ball.

Inzamam and his team staged a protest at the decision. During the protest the umpires, having tried to persuade Inzamam to come out of the dressing room, decided that the match could not continue. Later, Inzamam returned to the field with his team, only to find both the umpires and the English team absent. After further discussions between both teams, umpires and cricket board officials it was eventually agreed that the match could not be restarted. Thus, Inzamam became the first captain in history to forfeit a Test match. Inzamam was later charged with tampering with the ball and bringing the game into disrepute (the latter charge associated with the teatime protest). He strenuously denied the charges. On 28 September 2006 the allegations of ball-tampering were dismissed, however he was found guilty of bringing cricket into disrepute and given a four match One-Day International ban with immediate effect.

=== Religious influence ===
In 2006–07, controversy arose that Inzamam and other players who were members of the Tablighi Jamaat Islamic missionary group, were coercing other players and giving preferential treatment to those players who grew beards and prayed regularly. The then-Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf expressed his concerns to the then-PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf, who warned Inzamam and told the players to stop public displays of religious beliefs. Late Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer also stated that while religion fostered a degree of unity, it also interfered in the team&#x27;s training and practice sessions. Inzamam publicly denied accusations of forcing Islam on other players.

=== Yazoo International ===
In October 2023, it was reported that Inzamam was serving as a director of the UK-based Yazoo International Ltd. He was alongside three others: Mohammad Rizwan, a member of the Pakistan national cricket team; Talha Rehmani, managing director of Saya Corporation; and Intisar-ul-Haq, Inzamam&#x27;s brother, who serves as the company secretary. They were all appointed to their respective positions on 7 December 2020. The association of a national cricket selector with both a player and an agency representative raised concerns over potential conflict of interest. Consequently, Inzamam-ul-Haq resigned from his role as the chief selector on 30 October 2023.

== Honours ==
The Pakistani Government, in 2005, awarded Inzamam ul Haq with the Sitara-e-Imtiaz.

<doc id="896404" wikidata="Q3342871" url="?curid=896404" title="Nolan Richardson">
<text>Nolan Richardson Jr. (born December 27, 1941) is an American former basketball head coach best known for his tenure at the University of Arkansas, where he won the 1994 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament and led the Razorbacks to three Final Fours. Elected to the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008 and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2014, Richardson coached teams to winning a Division I Basketball National Championship, an NIT championship, and a Junior College National Championship, making him the only coach to win all three championships. During his 22 seasons of coaching in NCAA Division I, Richardson made a post-season tournament appearance 20 times.

==Early life==
Richardson was born in El Segundo Barrio in El Paso, Texas, United States to Nolan Richardson Sr. and Clareast (Mims) Richardson. Clareast died from miliary tuberculosis in 1945, leaving behind three children: Shirley, age 5, Nolan Jr., age 3, and Helen, six months. Eventually they moved in with the children&#x27;s grandmother, Rose Richardson or Ol&#x27; Mama. Ol&#x27; Mama had a profound impact on Nolan by helping instill the drive and determination to succeed. Nolan&#x27;s father would visit, but often did not live with the family, battling alcoholism for much of his adult life.

Nolan Richardson played college basketball at Eastern Arizona Junior College during the 1959-1960 season. He then returned home to play for Texas Western College (now the University of Texas at El Paso), playing his junior and senior years under Hall of Fame coach Don Haskins for the Miners.

==Coaching career==

===Early years===
Richardson began his coaching career at Bowie High School in El Paso, Texas. He coached at Bowie for ten years then moved to Western Texas Junior College for three seasons, posting a record there of 101-13. In 1979-80, his third and last season at Western Texas, he led the team to a 37-0 record and the 1980 National Junior College championship.

===University of Tulsa===
Richardson was the head coach at Tulsa from 1980 to 1985, leading Tulsa to the NIT championship in 1981. This was the first time an African American coach won an NIT championship. Richardson is credited with bringing the Tulsa program to national prominence when hired in 1980, and led the school to season conference championships in 1984 and 1985 and conference tournament titles in 1982 and 1984 to go with the previously mentioned 1981 NIT championship. Richardson had a .763 winning percentage at Tulsa, and became the first coach in NCAA history to win 50 games in his first two seasons. While coaching at Tulsa, Richardson became known for wearing an assortment of polka dot ties. This trademark eventually led Tulsa students to don polka dots during home games.

===University of Arkansas===
In 1985, Richardson became the head coach at the University of Arkansas after Eddie Sutton left for Kentucky. Richardson became the first African-American coach at a major university in the South, and the first African-American head coach of a men&#x27;s program in the Southwest Conference. He inherited a team and program that was used to Sutton&#x27;s halfcourt-oriented, walk-it-up-the-court style. Richardson&#x27;s frenetic, up-tempo system was new to Arkansas, and many fans questioned his coaching style after finishing 12-16 his first season. However, by year two he had Arkansas back in the post-season with an NIT berth. By year three, he had Arkansas in the NCAA Tournament. The Hogs would make the tournament in 13 of the next 15 seasons. In all, Arkansas under Richardson enjoyed 15 post-season appearances during the 17 seasons of his tenure.

He led Arkansas to three Final Fours—losing to Duke in the semifinals in 1990, winning the National Championship in 1994 against Duke, and losing in the Championship game to UCLA in 1995. He was named the National Coach of the Year in 1994. Richardson&#x27;s Arkansas teams averaged 27 wins per season during the 1990s, and they were the winningest team of the decade until 1997. The Razorbacks&#x27; 270 wins from 1990 to 1999 were more than all but four programs in the NCAA. Nolan&#x27;s Arkansas teams won at least 20 games 12 times, as well as four 30-win seasons during his 17 years.

His teams typically played an up-tempo game with intense pressure defense - a style that was known as &quot;40 Minutes of Hell.&quot; In 2012, his coaching philosophy was featured in the documentary &quot;40 Minutes of Hell&quot; on ESPN as part of the network&#x27;s &quot;SEC&quot; &quot;Storied &quot;series&quot;. &quot;Richardson is the winningest basketball coach in Arkansas history, compiling a 389-169 () record in 17 seasons. He is the only head coach to win a Junior College National Championship, the NIT Championship, and the NCAA Championship. Richardson is also among an elite group including Roy Williams, Denny Crum, Jim Boeheim, John Calipari and Tubby Smith as the only head coaches to win 365 games in 15 seasons or fewer.

====University of Arkansas controversy====
While at Arkansas, Richardson frequently spoke out about the negative stereotypes that he and other black coaches faced. His most controversial statement occurred in a post-game press conference in February 2002, when he spoke out against the athletic administration at the University of Arkansas. He claimed that he was being mistreated because of his race, and challenged Athletic Director Frank Broyles to ruffle feathers by declaring, &quot;If they go ahead and pay me my money, they can take my job tomorrow.&quot; Shortly thereafter, Arkansas dismissed Richardson as head coach. In December 2002, Richardson filed a lawsuit against the university, the board of trustees, and the Razorback Foundation, citing a racially discriminatory environment; the lawsuit was dismissed in July 2004.

Richardson&#x27;s former long-time assistant, Mike Anderson, was hired as Arkansas&#x27; head coach in March 2011. Anderson led Arkansas to three NCAA Tournament appearances in eight seasons as head coach. Richardson attended numerous Arkansas home games during Anderson&#x27;s tenure. On March 26, 2019, Anderson was terminated as head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks after a lackluster 2018–19 season and was replaced by former Nevada head coach Eric Musselman.

====Nolan Richardson Court====
On March 28, 2019, two days after the termination of Nolan Richardson&#x27;s protege Mike Anderson, the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees voted unanimously to name the court in Arkansas&#x27; Bud Walton Arena in honor of Nolan Richardson and his contributions to the University of Arkansas and the state of Arkansas. The honor became official in the wake of growing public support to honor Richardson in this way, including a resolution proposed during the 2019 regular session of the Arkansas General Assembly.

===International===
From 2005 to 2007, Richardson, (who speaks fluent Spanish) served as the head coach of the Panama national team. In March 2007, Richardson was named head coach of the Mexico national basketball team.

===WNBA===
In the middle of 2009, Richardson was named as head coach and general manager of a prospective WNBA expansion team in Tulsa. While it seemed unusual to hire a coach before securing an actual berth in the league, the investors behind the expansion effort claimed this proved they were serious about wanting a team. On October 20, 2009, the Tulsa group bought the Detroit Shock and moved it to Tulsa as the Tulsa Shock. It was Richardson&#x27;s first time as a professional head coach, as well as his first time coaching women.

Richardson&#x27;s tenure with the Shock was far from successful. His first season ended before it began when key players who had led the Shock to three WNBA titles opted, for various reasons, not to make the move to Tulsa. This forced Richardson to try to build the team around disgraced Olympic track star Marion Jones, who hadn&#x27;t played a meaningful basketball game since her college days 13 years earlier. The players also found it difficult to adjust to Richardson&#x27;s frenetic style. A lack of continuity plagued the team as well; all of the players who had come from Detroit had left the team by the middle of the season, and Richardson seemingly juggled the roster on a game-by-game basis. The final result was a dreadful 6-28 record, last in the league. Richardson tried to rebuild the team by coaxing Sheryl Swoopes out of retirement, but after a 1-10 start, Richardson resigned on July 8, 2011.

<doc id="896405" wikidata="Q3528074" url="?curid=896405" title="Mushtaq Ahmed (cricketer)">
<text>Mushtaq Ahmed (Urdu:مشتاق احمد ; born 28 June 1970) is a Pakistani cricket coach and former cricketer who currently acts as the spin bowling coach for the Bangladesh national cricket team. A leg break googly bowler, at his peak he was described as being one of the best three wrist-spinners in the world. In an international career that spanned from 1990 until 2003, he claimed 185 wickets in Test cricket and 161 in One Day Internationals. He was at his most prolific internationally between 1995 and 1998, but his most successful years were as a domestic player for Sussex in the early 2000s.

Mushtaq was part of the Pakistan team that won the 1992 Cricket World Cup, and five years later, he was named as one of the &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketers of the Year. During his time with Sussex, he was the leading wicket-taker in the County Championship for five successive seasons, and helped the county win the competition in 2003, 2006, and 2007.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Mushtaq Ahmed made his first-class cricket debut in January 1987, at the age of 16. Playing for Multan, he claimed four wickets in the second innings of the match against Sukkur. He claimed his maiden recorded five-wicket haul in the format the following season, playing for the Punjab Chief Minister&#x27;s XI against the touring England cricket team. Shortly thereafter, he competed in the 1988 Under-19 World Cup, where he was the joint leading wicket-taker, claiming 19 wickets at an average of 16.21. Pakistan reached the final of the tournament, in which they lost to Australia by five wickets. Early the following season, Mushtaq took the first ten-wicket haul of his career, collecting six wickets in the first innings and eight in the second innings of a match against Peshawar. He continued to impress that season, and took 52 wickets at an average of 22.84. He continued to appear for Pakistan Under-19s, and took 26 wickets in their series against India under-19s, more than double any other Pakistani player. His strong performances resulted in a call-up to the Pakistan national cricket team in March 1989.

===International bowler===
He made his full international debut on 23 March 1989, playing a One Day International (ODI) against Sri Lanka. He took two wickets for 33 runs in the match, which Pakistan won by 30 runs. He retained his place in the Pakistan side for the subsequent tri-series with India and the West Indies, and made his Test cricket debut in January 1990 against Australia at the Adelaide Oval. His only wicket of the match was that of Mark Taylor. A year later, took fourteen wickets in a match against Peshawar, collecting five in the first innings, followed by nine in the second, finishing the match with figures of 14 for 130.

In 1992, Mushtaq was part of the Pakistan team which won the Cricket World Cup. He was joint-second amongst bowlers by wickets taken, having claimed 16 during the tournament, trailing only his compatriot Wasim Akram. He struggled to make a significant impact in Test cricket for a number of years after his debut: between 1990 and 1994, he only claimed ten or more wickets in a Test series on one occasion, against England in 1992. However, between November 1995 and March 1998, he took at least ten wickets in every Test series, and claimed ten five-wicket hauls. The first occasion on which he claimed five wickets in an innings in Test cricket was the second Test against Australia in November 1995. He repeated the feat in the third Test of that series, and then in the only Test of the subsequent series against New Zealand, in which he recorded his best figures in a Test match, seven for 56. His only five-wicket haul in ODI cricket occurred in the fifth ODI of the Sahara &#x27;Friendship&#x27; Cup, a series played between India and Pakistan in Toronto, Canada. He took five wickets for 36 runs to help Pakistan win the match by 52 runs, and thus clinch the series 3–2.

During his most prolific years of Test cricket, he played his first spell of county cricket, appearing for Somerset between 1993 and 1998. In his book &quot;Somerset County Cricket Club (100 Greats)&quot;, Eddie Lawrence describes Mushtaq as &quot;one of Somerset&#x27;s best-ever &quot;overseas&quot; signings.&quot; He played 62 first-class matches for the county, and claimed 289 wickets at an average of 26.32. In 1997, he was named as one of the five &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketers of the Year, in which he was described as being a member of &quot;a glittering triumvirate of wrist-spinners who adorn the modern game.&quot;

In the late 1990s, Mushtaq was one of a number of Pakistan cricketers who were suspected of match-fixing. Saleem Pervez alleged that he had given Mushtaq, along with Salim Malik, £100,000 to intentionally lose a match against Australia in September 1994. After an inquiry, Mushtaq was fined £3,500, and banned from captaining Pakistan. The judge presiding over the inquiry stated that: &quot;There are sufficient grounds to cast strong doubt on Mushtaq Ahmed.&quot;

===Later career===
After losing his place in the Pakistan national cricket team, Mushtaq played one season of county cricket for Surrey in 2002, having appeared in the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition for Northop Hall the previous year. He failed to impress for Surrey, claiming eight wickets at an average of 38.12. The following season, he joined Sussex, where he became the leading county wicket taker for five seasons in a row, playing a major role in Sussex&#x27;s first ever County Championship title.

His form for the county prompted a recall to international duty, but it was short-lived: he played two Tests and one ODI before being dropped for the final time. He helped Sussex to win the County Championship twice more before persistent knee injuries forced him to retire at the end of the 2008 season. In 85 matches with Sussex, Mushtaq claimed 478 wickets at an average of 25.34.

<doc id="896410" wikidata="Q3521135" url="?curid=896410" title="Hashan Tillakaratne">
<text>Deshabandu Hashan Prasantha Tillakaratne (born 14 July 1967) is a former Sri Lankan cricketer and a former Test captain for Sri Lanka. He was a key member for 1996 Cricket World Cup winning team for Sri Lanka. He is currently a politician and also involved in many aspects of cricket within the country. His twin sons Ravindu Tillakaratne and Duvindu Tillakaratne also play domestic cricket in Sri Lanka.

==International career==
Hashan started playing cricket at Isipathana College, Colombo &amp; D. S. Senanayake College, Colombo. As a schoolboy in 1986, he was selected to play against England B at Galle, scoring a century to save the match. He made his One Day International debut in November 1986 at Sharjah against India during the 1986–87 Champions Trophy. He subsequently made his test debut in the Sri Lankan cricket team as a wicketkeeper-batsman in December 1989 against Australia and scored a duck on test debut. He continued as a specialist batsman from December 1992 and decided to quit the glovework in 1994.

He was part of the Sri Lankan cricket team that won the 1996 Cricket World Cup. He was dropped from the Sri Lankan Test and ODI teams after the 1999 Cricket World Cup, but returned to the Test team in 2001 following success in domestic first-class cricket, where he played for Nondescripts Cricket Club. He also returned to the ODI team in 2002–03. In November 2002, he scored a magnificent test century against South Africa at Centurion Park in difficult conditions and with that century he went onto become the first Sri Lankan to have scored a test century in South African soil. He also became the first and only Sri Lankan to have scored a test century at Centurion SuperSport Park. He became captain of the Sri Lanka Test team in April 2003, but won only one of his ten matches in charge. After losing 3–0 to Australia at home, he resigned from captaincy in March 2004 and was not selected for Sri Lanka again. He announced his retirement from international cricket in 2004 and retired from all forms of cricket in 2006 to pursue his career in coaching.

During a group stage match against West Indies as part of the 1995–96 Singer Champions Trophy at Sharjah chasing a mammoth 334, Hashan Tillekaratne coming in at seven had an uphill task to rescue the Sri Lankan batting singlehandedly in the run chase when they were reduced to 103/5 at one stage. He nearly pulled off a Javed Miandad type masterclass innings of his own by scoring a century coming into bat at seven giving Sri Lanka a fair chance of getting closer to the winning target from nowhere. However, his valiant knock was in vain as Sri Lanka lost only by four runs in the end being bowled out for 329. He went to become the first batsman in the world to score an ODI century when batting at number 7 position. Up to date, he remains the only Sri Lankan to have scored an ODI century when batting at number 7 position and still has the highest ODI score for Sri Lanka when batting at no 7 positions.
==Post-retirement==
On 1 February 2005, the Sri Lankan cricket board appointed him executive director of Cricket-Aid, a body formed to provide relief following the December 2004 tsunami, but he was suspended amid recriminations later that year.

Following this he entered politics, joining the United National Party, and was appointed as the party&#x27;s organiser for Avissawella constituency in Colombo. He continued his association with cricket serving on various SLC committees at the invitation of the newly appointed president, Arjuna Ranatunga. He was also granted honorary life membership of the MCC in March 2008. In May, he was appointed the president of the Association of Cricket Umpires and Scorers of Sri Lanka (ACUSSL) and the Sri Lankan cricket board appointed him as National Cricket Team Manager in July 2008. This appointment was subsequently vetoed by Sports Minister Gamini Lokuge on the grounds that the SLC had failed to obtain his prior permission on the appointment and Hashan was replaced by Charith Senanayake.

In April 2011, he caused a furore by making public allegations that match-fixing had been taking place in Sri Lankan cricket since 1992 and stated that he was prepared to divulge the information that he had about this to the ICC. His claims were also supported by former Sri Lankan Test captain Arjuna Ranatunga who claimed that there was corruption within the administration of the game. In 2012, he made allegations that there were political interference during the 2012 Sri Lanka Cricket Board elections. He joined the Sri Lanka Cricket selection panel in 2013.

He was appointed as a temporary batting coach of Sri Lankan cricket team in 2017. He became the coach of the Sri Lanka national under-19 cricket team in 2018 and up until 2020 on a two-year agreement with the 2020 Under-19 Cricket World Cup being his last assignment as U19 coach. He also served as batting coach of Sri Lanka Emerging Team for a brief stint. In 2019, there were reports that the test cap of Hashan Tillekaratne was to be sold in an online auction. However, Hashan himself refused such reports and insisted that he would never sell his national pride for money.

He was appointed as the coach of the Kandy Tuskers franchise for the inaugural edition of the Lanka Premier League in 2020. In June 2021, he was appointed as the head coach of the Sri Lanka women&#x27;s national cricket team on a six-month contract up until December 2021. In 2021, he was also appointed as a part of coach restructuring program at the High Performance Centre.

<doc id="896414" wikidata="Q3526035" url="?curid=896414" title="Alec Stewart">
<text>Alec James Stewart (born 8 April 1963) is an English former cricketer, and former captain of the England cricket team, who played Test cricket and One Day Internationals as a right-handed wicket-keeper-batsman. He is the fifth-most-capped English cricketer ever in Test matches and third-most-capped in One Day Internationals (ODIs), having played in 133 Tests and 170 ODIs. An attacking batsman in tests against the new ball, Stewart is regarded as one of England&#x27;s greatest openers. Pakistani fast bowler Wasim Akram considers him one of the most difficult batsmen he ever bowled to. He was a part of the English squad which finished as runners-up at the 1992 Cricket World Cup.

==Domestic career==
The younger son of former English Test cricketer Micky Stewart, Stewart was educated at Coombe Hill Infants&#x27; School, Coombe Hill Junior School and Tiffin School in Kingston upon Thames. He made his debut for Surrey in 1981, earning a reputation as an aggressive opening batsman and occasional wicketkeeper.

Stewart is a well-known supporter of Surrey County Cricket Club and Chelsea Football Club. When shirt numbers were introduced for One Day International cricket, Stewart chose the number 4 shirt in honour of his favourite Chelsea player when growing up, John Hollins, and kept that shirt number throughout his career.

==International career==
Stewart made his England debut in the first Test of the 1989/90 tour of the West Indies, along with Nasser Hussain, who would eventually replace him as England captain.

At the start of his career, Stewart was a specialist opening batsman for England, with wicketkeeping duties being retained by Jack Russell, who was generally recognised as the superior gloveman and who batted down the order. However, Russell, the inferior batsman, would often be dropped to improve the balance of the side (i.e. to accommodate an extra bowler or batsman), in which case Stewart would don the gloves. After enduring years of selection and deselection, Russell retired from international cricket in 1998, leaving Stewart unrivalled as England&#x27;s keeper-batsman until his own retirement in 2003.
===Prominence===
His highest Test score, 190, was against Pakistan in the drawn first Edgbaston Test on 4 June 1992; it was his fourth century in five Tests. In 1994 at the Kensington Oval he became only the seventh Englishman to score centuries in both innings of a Test match, scoring 118 and 143 as the West Indies were beaten at their Bridgetown &quot;fortress&quot; for the first time since 1935.

Stewart&#x27;s batting average (39.54) is the lowest of any player to have scored 8000 or more runs in Test cricket: he is the only player to have scored over 8000 runs despite an average of under 40. However, when played as a specialist batsman in Test cricket, Stewart averaged 46.90 in 51 games with 9 centuries. Since World War II, only Len Hutton, Geoff Boycott, Dennis Amiss and Alastair Cook have bettered Stewart&#x27;s average of 46 as a specialist opening batsman for England. As wicketkeeper-batsman he averaged 34.92 from 82 tests, higher than many of his contemporaries. He was unlucky enough to be on the losing side in a record 54 Test Matches.

Stewart holds the record for scoring the most test runs without a career double century in test history (8463).

===Captaincy===
Stewart was groomed for the England captaincy under Graham Gooch, deputising for him in four tests in India and Sri Lanka in 1993, but when Gooch retired from the captaincy later that year Mike Atherton was chosen to succeed him. Stewart was asked to captain England in 1998 when Mike Atherton resigned. Despite being the age of 35 at the time, Stewart&#x27;s level of fitness was impeccable, especially bearing in mind that most players do not continue beyond 37. As it was Stewart went on to play for England beyond his 40th birthday – but as events were to transpire, his captaincy of England barely lasted 12 months.

In his first series as captain, against South Africa, Stewart scored an outstanding 164 in the third Test at Old Trafford to salvage a draw, a result which eventually enabled England to overturn a 1–0 deficit to win the series 2–1. Nonetheless, failures against Australia and in the 1999 Cricket World Cup saw him sacked from the captaincy to be replaced by Hussain. During his captaincy, he dropped down the order and did not open the batting. He continued to deputise occasionally as captain of England&#x27;s one-day side, and became the second international captain to concede a match in 2001, after a pitch invasion during a One Day International against Pakistan rendered the continuation of play impossible. He continued as an England player for five more seasons, and became only the fourth player to score a century in his 100th Test, scoring 105 against the West Indies at Old Trafford in 2000.

Stewart also set a record for playing the most number of ODI matches(28) as a captain who has kept wicket and opened the batting.

==After cricket==
In 2004, Stewart became a founding director of Arundel Promotions with specific responsibility for player management and representation. Cricket playing clients include Paul Collingwood, Ian Bell, Ashley Giles and Matt Prior.

In 2009, Stewart rejoined Surrey as a part-time consultant to the coaching staff specialising in batting, wicket keeping and mentoring.

Since retiring from playing Stewart has taken on the role as the Club Ambassador for Surrey County Cricket Club and was made an executive director in 2011.

On 17 June 2013, it was announced by Surrey County Cricket Club that Stewart would take charge of first team affairs following the sacking of Chris Adams, until a long term successor was found. In October 2013 the club announced that Graham Ford would become head coach in February 2014, with Stewart becoming Director of Cricket, a new position. In March 2024, he announced that he would be stepping down from this role at the end of the year. In October 2024 it was announced that Stewart would remain at the club as a part-time high-performance cricket advisor.

<text>Taufeeq Umar (Punjabi: توفیق عمر, born 20 June 1981) is a Pakistani former cricketer who played for the Pakistan national cricket team between 2001 and 2014. Umar was a regular Test opening batsman for three seasons, before being dropped ahead of the 2004–05 season. On 23 May 2020, he tested positive for COVID-19 and he insisted that he didn&#x27;t develop cautious symptoms. He recovered successfully from the coronavirus in June 2020.

==International career==
Unusually for a Pakistani player, Umar has played more Tests than ODIs, as he was not given a prolonged run in the ODI side until 2003, when he played eight ODIs in a row. However, he only missed two of 24 Tests Pakistan played between August 2001 and April 2004, and after 17 Tests his batting average had reached 48.03 after he made four scores above 50 in the two-Test series with South Africa.

Possessing excellent temperament, he remains unique amongst Pakistani openers in his ability to concentrate for long periods and his ability to build innings. With exquisite drives either side of the wicket, a formidable cut and pull shot in the armoury and possessing the natural gift of timing, he seemed the very answer to Pakistan&#x27;s opening problem especially against a full strength South African attack in South Africa (2003). A loss of form against India (2004) resulted in Taufeeq losing his place in the team and a subsequent loss of batting confidence.

He was recalled into the Pakistani side for the South Africa Series in 2010. He made his comeback against South Africa with some good scores. Against West Indies, he scored a century and then a brilliant double hundred against Sri Lanka at UAE. He has again become a regular part of Test squad as an opener. he continued to play for Pakistan until Sri Lanka in 2012. After the series, he was dropped from the squad, until his later comeback for a single test match in 2014 against New Zealand. He scored only 16 and 4 in the two innings and was dropped from the squad.

==Domestic career==
He played for Pakistan A against a touring England XI in 2005–06, and continued to play for Lahore Ravi and Habib Bank Limited in Pakistani domestic competitions.

In 2008 he was briefly banned from playing domestic cricket in Pakistan after he joined the rebel Indian Cricket League and represented the Lahore Badshahs. Taufeeq spent a summer in the UK playing Professional League cricket for Lancaster Cricket Club in the Northern League.

<text>Olof Björnsson, in legend, was a Swedish king who was referenced in several Old Norse Sagas including &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, &quot;Saga of Harald Fairhair&quot; and the &quot;Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa&quot;. Reconstructions that place him as a historical king date his reign to c. 970 – c. 975.

Olof was the son of Björn Eriksson who ruled as king of Sweden. After the death of their father, Olof ruled jointly with his brother Eric the Victorious (Swedish: &quot;Erik Segersäll&quot;). By his queen Ingeborg Thrandsdotter, he was the father of Styrbjörn Starke and Gyrid, queen consort of King Harald Bluetooth. He died of poison during a meal. Eric, instead of proclaiming his nephew Styrbjörn co-ruler, proclaimed his own unborn son to be co-ruler. This son ruled as the historical king Olof Skötkonung.

<text>Michael Jonathon Slater (born 21 February 1970) is an Australian former professional cricketer and former television presenter. He played in 74 Test matches and 42 One Day Internationals for the Australia national cricket team. He was a part of the Australian squad which finished as runners-up at the 1996 Cricket World Cup.

==Early life==

=== Family life and education ===
Slater was born in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, and lived in both Wagga and Junee for his childhood. His parents, Peter and Carole and two older siblings had emigrated from the north-eastern coast of England in 1966 to Launceston, Tasmania, Australia where his father taught high school agriculture and science.

After three years, the family moved and his father became a teacher in agriculture at Wagga Wagga Agricultural College. Slater&#x27;s mother left the family in 1983, when he was just 12 years old. He later wrote about tough personal times that followed, claiming that his education standards slipped after his mother left the family and that sport became the &quot;only thing [he] could focus on properly&quot;. However, it was later revealed that Slater suffers from manic depression (bipolar disorder). He has claimed that school bullying accentuated his academic difficulties in Years 9 and 10 and claimed that he once ran home after it was suggested that some bullies &quot;were planning to get [him] after school&quot;.

=== Early cricket career ===
Slater wrote: &quot;My family was always involved in sport, so from an early age it just seemed natural for me to play any game that was on offer.&quot; When aged 11, Slater was selected in the New South Wales Primary School Sports Association cricket and hockey teams. He also made the state under-12 hockey team in 1981 and went on to be selected in the Under-13, -15 and -17 hockey teams. Slater wrote that, in his early teenage years, he turned towards cricket.

Slater joined an inner-western Sydney Under-16 side over a Christmas holiday to further develop his cricketing career. After topping the batting averages in the Under-17s, in the following season, he was chosen as captain of the New South Wales Under—16 team. The carnival was not a success for him but his team performed &quot;well&quot;. Slater claimed that he hurt his Achilles tendon in an accident at school when he was seventeen and played a couple of hockey games following the accident but limped off the field and subsequently had surgery in the lead-up to the Under-17 national cricket carnival. Slater claimed he was informed that, because of his injury, his &quot;dream of playing cricket for Australia was over&quot;. However, after an operation, he returned to cricket and was selected in the Under-19 state team for the national championships in Brisbane. He attended the Australian Institute of Sport Australian Cricket Academy in 1989.

After an injury to the captain, Slater captained the state under-19 team but he and his team under-performed. The following year, he was vice-captain for the Under-19 carnival in Canberra and scored a century in the opening match. In a victorious final against Victoria, Slater scored another century, becoming one of the leading run-scorers in the series.
==Cricket career==
A specialist right-handed batter as well as a very occasional right-arm medium-pace bowler, Slater represented the New South Wales Blues in Australian domestic cricket and played English county cricket with Derbyshire. His Australian club was the University of NSW Cricket Club, for whom he scored 3873 runs in 77 first-grade innings, with a high score of 213 not out. Slater went on to Test cricket, opening the batting with mixed success, scoring 5,312 runs and 14 centuries at an average of 42. He was generally unsuccessful in One-Day International games, averaging a lowly 24.07 and, after a string of failures, was eventually dropped from the national limited-overs side for good in 1997.

Throughout his career, Slater was susceptible to the &quot;nervous nineties&quot;: of the 23 times he reached a score of 90 in a Test innings, he was dismissed nine times before reaching 100.

Slater played for New South Wales in the 1991/92 Sheffield Shield season. He made quick progress to the Australian side, being selected for the Ashes tour of England in 1993, when he was 23 years of age, narrowly beating Queenslander Matthew Hayden to the opening berth alongside vice/captain Mark Taylor, who also grew up in Wagga Wagga. In his debut match, he scored a half-century, before compiling his maiden century in the following Test match at Lord&#x27;s, famously kissing the Australian coat of arms on his helmet to celebrate achieving the milestone. He continued his good form into the subsequent home series against New Zealand in 1993–94, netting 305 runs at an average of 76.25. In the 1994–95 return Ashes series in Australia, Slater was the leading run-scorer in the series with 623. The following season saw him notch his first double-century, against Sri Lanka at the WACA in Perth.

Slater&#x27;s match-winning 123 against England at Sydney in the 1998–99 Ashes series comprised 66.84 per cent of his team&#x27;s entire total. This remains the greatest proportion since Charles Bannerman made 165 not out (67.34 per cent) in the very first Test innings of all, in 1877.

Slater was dropped from the Australian Test side in late 1996 after some poor form. It took him two years to get back into the national team and things went well for a couple of years, although this period coincided with a split from his first wife and accusations of drug-taking by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB). His Ashes tour to England in 2001 was his last international series. He started off with a quick-fire 77 in his first innings of the series, including four boundaries off the first four balls he faced from Darren Gough. However, as the series went on, Slater’s form started to decline dramatically, ultimately leading to Justin Langer replacing him as opening batter. It was subsequently reported that Slater felt animosity towards Langer over this decision and became reclusive. It was later revealed that he suffered from manic depression (bipolar disorder). Unable to rebuild a career in limited-overs cricket, his prolonged form slump forced him out of professional cricket after 74 Test matches.

== Legal issues ==
Since his retirement from cricket and the end of his media work, Slater has faced many legal issues, including multiple arrests and charges.

On 20 October, 2021, Slater was arrested on charges of domestic violence, stalking and using a carrier service to harass, relating to his ex-wife.

On 15 December, 2021, New South Wales Police arrested Slater for allegedly breaching an apprehended violence order (AVO). He was then released on police bail.

On 27 April, 2022, Slater came under a fresh police investigation over an alleged domestic violence incident, just hours before he had similar charges dismissed on mental health grounds.

On 27 May, 2022, Slater was arrested and charged with assault and stalking/intimidating after police were called to a unit in Manly on April 26, 2022
On 18 July 2022, Slater was escorted to Manly Police Station and charged with breach of bail. Magistrate Megan Greenwood granted Slater bail and again ordered him to abide by the strict conditions of the arrangement.
On 31 August 2022, Slater was charged with two new counts of common assault and one count of attempting to stalk or intimidate intending fear of physical or mental harm after he allegedly assaulted a man at Frenchs Forest on Sydney&#x27;s northern beaches.

On 22 September, 2022, Slater was arrested for allegedly breaching bail. New South Wales Police applied for an interim apprehended violence order to protect the woman he was with at the time of his arrest.

On 9 November, 2022, Slater was convicted of domestic violence charges, using a carriage service to harass, stalking or intimidating and common assault at Manly Local Court. Slater also had two counts of common assault and one count of attempting to stalk or intimidate, relating to an incident at a northern beaches hospital in July, dismissed on mental health grounds. 
The magistrate described the convictions as &quot;warranted&quot; and &quot;expected by the community&quot;, saying that repeated domestic violence offending cannot go unpunished. Slater was sentenced to a two-year jail sentence to be served in the community.

On 31 March, 2023, Slater was arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer and two counts of obstructing police following a confrontation at Noosa Heads.

On 21 November, 2023, Slater was sentenced over the police altercation in Noosa Heads. The judge fined Slater $600 but did not record a conviction. 

On 14 April, 2024, Slater was arrested and charged 19 times, the alleged charges including domestic violence offences of unlawful stalking or intimidation, breaking into a dwelling with intent at night, common assault, assault occasioning bodily harm, choking or suffocation, and breaching bail. He was subsequently denied bail to appear again in late May 

==Media work==
===Television===
After commentating for Channel 4 in the United Kingdom during the 2005 Ashes series, Slater joined Nine&#x27;s Wide World of Sports cricket commentary team in January 2006. He later appeared as a reporter on Channel Nine&#x27;s health and lifestyle programme, &quot;What&#x27;s Good For You?&quot;. He also appeared as a contestant on the Australian version of &quot;Torvill and Dean&#x27;s Dancing on Ice&quot;in 2006, becoming the fourth contestant to be eliminated.

In 2009 to 2010, he was the sports presenter for the Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Today&quot; alongside co-hosts Cameron Williams and Leila McKinnon. In 2009, he also hosted &quot;Australia&#x27;s Greatest Athlete&quot; (alongside Andrew Voss), which aired on Saturday afternoons in January and February. He was co-host of &quot;The Footy Show&quot; a rugby league-based television variety programme, alongside Paul Vautin, Darryl Brohman, Erin Molan and Beau Ryan and host of &quot;The Cricket Show&quot;, both on Channel 9. In 2012, Slater called the diving at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England for Channel 9 and Fox Sports alongside dual Australian Olympic diver Michael Murphy.

In 2018, he joined the Seven Network to commentate its coverage of the Test Cricket and Big Bash League. In 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Slater travelled to India to commentate on Indian Premier League cricket during a continued uncontrolled outbreak of the virus in India. He attracted a backlash for his criticisms of the Australian COVID-19 travel restrictions and claims that the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, had &quot;blood on his hands&quot; over the handling of the pandemic. Slater was subsequently axed by the Seven Network, which chose to not renew his contract, citing &quot;budget restraints&quot;

===Radio===
Slater was a regular contributor to the Triple M Sydney radio sports panel program &quot;Dead Set Legends&quot; and was a replacement co-host for Richard Freedman on Sky Sports Radio&#x27;s Big Sports Breakfast with Terry Kennedy.

<doc id="896426" wikidata="Q1428440" url="?curid=896426" title="Michael Clarke (cricketer)">
<text>Michael John Clarke (born 2 April 1981) is an Australian former cricketer. He was captain of the Australian cricket team in both Test and One Day International (ODI) between 2011 and 2015, leading Australia to victory in the 2015 Cricket World Cup. He also served as captain of the Twenty20 International (T20I) side between 2007 and 2010. With his time representing Australia, Clarke won multiple ICC titles with the team: the 2007 Cricket World Cup, the 2015 Cricket World Cup which he was the winning captain, and the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy.

Nicknamed &quot;Pup&quot;, Clarke was a right-handed middle-order batsman, an occasional left-arm orthodox spin bowler and also a slip catcher. He represented New South Wales at a domestic level.

Clarke retired from all forms of cricket after the final Test of the 2015 Ashes series.

==Early life and career==
Clarke was born and raised in Liverpool, New South Wales. He attended Marsden Road Public School and cultivated his batting skills at his father&#x27;s indoor cricket centre in Liverpool after school. Despite being a left handed person who writes and bowls with his left hand, Clarke trained to bat right handed . His junior club was the Western Suburbs District Cricket Club.

When Clarke was 17, scans revealed that he had three degenerative discs in his lower back, a condition that would restrict his back movement through his career. Clarke underwent core strengthening exercises to ease this condition.

Clarke made his first-class debut for New South Wales as a seventeen-year-old in a game against the touring Indian side at the Sydney Cricket Ground in December 1999. He was an AIS Australian Cricket Academy scholarship holder in 1999–2000. In 2002, Clarke played for Ramsbottom Cricket Club in English club cricket. He became the first player to hit a double century in the history of the Lancashire League.

==International career==
===Early years===
Clarke made his One Day International debut in January 2003 against England at Adelaide Oval.

Clarke made his Test debut at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore in October 2004, in the first Test match of Australia&#x27;s 2004 tour of India. In his first innings, Clarke batted with good footwork against India&#x27;s bowlers. He was not confident that he could read India&#x27;s spin bowler Anil Kumble&#x27;s deliveries, so he moved to the pitch of the ball to eliminate the spin. He scored 151 runs and was named the player of the match in Australia&#x27;s win. He continued to play well for the rest of the tour. Despite not being considered a strong bowler, he bowled in fourth Test match at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai and took six wickets for nine runs. This remained the best bowling performance of his Test career until he retired.

The Australian team returned home in November 2004 and Clarke played his first home Test match against New Zealand at The Gabba in Brisbane. He scored another century, finishing with 141 runs, and was again named player of the match. After his early success in the team, Clarke began to struggle and didn&#x27;t score another century in the following six Test series he played. His struggles began in the 2005 Ashes series in England. He played a strong innings in the 1st Test match at Lord&#x27;s in July 2005, reaching 91 quickly. England responded with defensive bowling tactics to slow him down, and Clarke tried to improvise with aggressive shots and was dismissed. Clarke&#x27;s form dropped after this innings, and he struggled to score runs for the rest of the year. He stayed in the team until November 2005, during Australia&#x27;s series against the West Indies. In the first Test match at Bellerive Oval in Hobart, Clarke was dismissed for 5 runs while playing a loose stroke in the first innings, and he did not bat in the second innings. He was dropped from the team following this match.

===Return to international cricket===
After being dropped from the national team at the end of 2005, Clarke focused on changing his batting technique to tighten his defence and play with a straighter bat. He performed well in Australian domestic cricket and returned to the national team in 2006. His initial return came in Australia&#x27;s first ever tour of Bangladesh in April 2006, but after this tour he was dropped again. He next returned to the team for the 2006–07 Ashes series when Shane Watson was injured and unable to play. He scored centuries in the second and third matches at Adelaide Oval and the WACA, he scored back-to-back centuries to cement his place in the team.

Clarke then helped Australia retain the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies where they did not lose a game. After Damien Martyn&#x27;s retirement he was elevated to number five in the batting line up. He had a superb tournament making four 50s including a 92 and a 93* against the Netherlands and South Africa. He also made an unbeaten 60 against South Africa in the semi-final to guide Australia into the final at Barbados, against Sri Lanka. He was named as 12th man in the &#x27;Team of the Tournament&#x27; by ESPNcricinfo for the 2007 World Cup.

===Struggle in form===
Clarke faced only four balls for three runs in the ICC World Twenty20, when Australia were knocked out by India in the semi-final. Two weeks later he made 130 against India in the first of a seven-match ODI series. He did not maintain that form in the remaining 6 matches mustering up just one fifty. He opened the batting in the final two games after a hip injury ruled out Matthew Hayden and he made two golden ducks. In the tour-ending Twenty20 match Clarke dropped back down the order with the return of Hayden, and scored 25 not out in a heavy defeat.
On 9 November 2007, Clarke notched up his fifth Test century against Sri Lanka in a two Test series. Clarke shared a 245 run partnership with Mike Hussey at the Gabba in Brisbane, Hussey departed on 133 but Clarke went on and had a partnership with Symonds who made 53*, the pair were unbeaten when Ricky Ponting declared the innings, Clarke top scoring with 145 not out.

On 6 January 2008, Clarke dismissed Harbhajan Singh, RP Singh and Ishant Sharma in the second last over of the day, with just six minutes remaining, to claim the final three wickets and win the Test match for Australia (at one stage he was on a hat trick, dismissing Harbhajan Singh and RP Singh on consecutive deliveries). His innings figures were 3 for 5 in 1.5 overs. Australian captain Ricky Ponting had declared that morning, setting India a total of 333 to chase and allowing Australia arguably too little time to bowl out the visitors. Clarke&#x27;s wickets ensured that Australia retained the Border–Gavaskar Trophy in 2008 and kept their world record equalling 16 match win streak alive.

===Vice captaincy===

After the retirement of Adam Gilchrist, in April 2008 Clarke was named vice-captain of the Australian side. Clarke missed the start of Australia&#x27;s 2008 tour of the West Indies following the death of Bingle&#x27;s father, meaning Hussey took over as vice-captain for the start of the tour. Soon after Clarke joined up with the squad, he scored a century in the second Test in Antigua, going on to captain the side in the final two One Day Internationals, both of which were won, in the absence through injury of Ponting.

He was named man of the series in the two-Test series against New Zealand in Australia with scores of 110, 98 and 10, as well as being the top run-scorer in the three-Test series against South Africa in Australia. Clarke won the 2009 Allan Border Medal in a tie with Ricky Ponting both scoring 41 points, and was named Test Cricketer of the Year.
 For his performances in 2009, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC.

===Captaincy===
On 5 December 2007, Cricket Australia named Clarke as captain of Australia for their one-off Twenty20 game against New Zealand in Perth, after deciding to rest Ponting and Hayden.

Clarke was named as captain of Australia&#x27;s Twenty20 side in October 2009, taking over from Ricky Ponting, who retired from Twenty20 International cricket to prolong his career. In January 2011, Clarke was named as stand-in captain for the fifth Test of the 2010–11 Ashes Series at the SCG, replacing the injured Ricky Ponting. He announced his retirement from Twenty20 International cricket on 7 January 2011, to concentrate on the longer forms of the game. When Ponting stood down from the captaincy of the Australian Test and ODI sides after the 2011 World Cup, Clarke was appointed as his permanent replacement in both roles.

His knock of 151 against South Africa at Cape Town was nominated to be one of the best Test batting performance of the year 2011 by ESPNcricinfo.

In January 2012, in the second Test of Australia&#x27;s home series against India and after a string of Test centuries since becoming captain, Clarke became the first Australian batsman since Matthew Hayden in 2003 to score a triple hundred. He joined with Ricky Ponting (134) in a partnership of 288, then added 334 with Michael Hussey (150*) before declaring on 329*, having started his innings with the score at 37/3. This match against India was the 100th Test to be played at the Sydney Cricket Ground, and Clarke&#x27;s score was both the highest ever made in an Australia-India Test (surpassing V. V. S. Laxman&#x27;s 281 from the 2000/01 season) and the highest ever achieved at the ground. The ground high score record had been held for more than a century by Englishman Reg &quot;Tip&quot; Foster&#x27;s 287 scored in the 1903/04 season. Clarke led Australia to a 4–0 win and was named the player of the series, having scored 626 runs at an average of 125.20. His knock was nominated to be one of the best Test batting performance of the year by ESPNcricinfo. He joined his triple century in Sydney with a double-century (210) in the first innings of the fourth Test in Adelaide. His 386-run partnership with Ponting (who scored 221) was the fourth-highest in Australian Test history. Following the Frank Worrell Trophy 2012, Ian Chappell said Clarke &quot;is quickly establishing a well-deserved reputation for brave and aggressive captaincy. His entertaining approach is based on one premise: trying to win the match from the opening delivery. This should be the aim of all international captains, but sadly it isn&#x27;t.&quot;

On 22 November 2012, Clarke scored a double century against South Africa at the Adelaide Oval.

Three weeks before the 2013 Ashes series, Clarke requested to stand down from his role as a selector, which also coincided with the sacking of coach Mickey Arthur and the naming of Darren Lehmann as his successor. After losing the 2013 Ashes in England, Clarke led Australia to a 5–0 victory in the 2013–14 Ashes series. Australia later gained the No. 1 Test ranking from South Africa after a long span of 4 years and 9 months (from August 2009 to April 2014), when Australia defeated South Africa 2–1 in a 3 match Test series, during Australia&#x27;s tour of South Africa in 2014.

Under his captaincy, Australia made their lowest Test score (47 all out) in 109 years, and shortest first innings (18.3 overs, 60 all out) in Test cricket history, and their worst-ever series defeat against India in Test history, which is also the first 4–0 whitewash for Australia against any side since 1969. Several of his teammates have criticised his captaincy. Mitchell Johnson described the team atmosphere as &#x27;toxic&#x27; under his captaincy, while Michael Hussey described the dressing room was stressful and tense. Several former players including John Buchanan Andrew Symonds, Matthew Hayden, and Simon Katich spoke against his captaincy. Katich, a former team mainstay, blamed Clarke for effectively ending his career once he became captain in revenge for a post-match incident several years earlier which saw Katich grab Clarke by the throat following a row about the singing of Australia&#x27;s team song in the dressing room.

===Late career===
Clarke suffered a hamstring injury on 14 November 2014, which put him in doubt to play at the beginning of the 2014–15 Border–Gavaskar Trophy. The series was rescheduled after the death of Phillip Hughes on 27 November, and Clarke was able to recover in time for the first Test at Adelaide Oval, for which Hughes was named as Australia&#x27;s honorary 13th man. On the first day of the match, Clarke scored 60 runs before suffering a back injury (a flare-up of his degenerative back condition). He retired hurt from the innings, but returned to batting the next day. Because of his injury, Clarke couldn&#x27;t play in his usual style and focused on wrist-work. He scored a century, finishing his innings with 128 runs. This was the last century he scored in his career.

Clarke captained the Australian team for 2015 Cricket World Cup. Clarke starred in the final against New Zealand, top scoring with a score of 74 off 72 balls, as Australia won their fifth World Cup title. He was bowled when nine runs were required to win.

Clarke announced that he would retire from One Day Cricket at the conclusion of the 2015 Cricket World Cup. Clarke played 244 ODIs, made 7907 runs at an average of 44.42 with 8 centuries and 58 half-centuries. He led his country in 73 matches, of which Australia won 49.

Clarke captained Australia for the last time in the 2015 Ashes series. Clarke batted poorly during the series, failing to score above 50 in any innings. Australia lost the series after the fourth Test match at Trent Bridge with one match remaining. Following the match, Clarke announced that he would retire from international cricket at the end of the series.

==Twenty20 leagues==

On 1 May 2012, Clarke made his debut in the Indian Premier League for Pune Warriors India.

In 2013, Clarke was named captain of the Sydney Thunder in Australia&#x27;s Twenty20 Big Bash League; however, due to injury and international team commitments, he never actually played a game for the Thunder.

==Statistics and achievements==
===Honours===
Clarke won the Allan Border Medal, considered to be the most prestigious individual prize in Australian cricket, four times, in 2005, 2009 (jointly with Ricky Ponting), 2012 and 2013. Only Ponting had won it as many times. He was also awarded the Men&#x27;s Test Player of the Year at the Allan Border Medal ceremony by the CA in 2009, 2012, 2013 and 2014.

He won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, thereby winning the Cricketer of the Year 2013 and also the Test Cricketer of the Year 2013. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 2010 Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack. He was named Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for the year 2012 in 2013 Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack. For his performances in 2012, he was named as captain of the World Test XI and ODI XI by the ICC. He was also named in the World Test XI by the ICC in 2013. He was also named in the Test XI of the year by ESPNcricinfo for 2012 and 2013.

In June 2020, Clarke was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, &quot;for distinguished service to cricket as a player at the national and international level, through leadership roles, and to the community.&quot; Three months later, he was inducted as a Cricket NSW Life Member.

===Career best performances===
==Personal life==
Clarke was in a relationship with model Lara Bingle until March 2010. Clarke and Bingle became engaged in early 2008, and in May 2008, Clarke withdrew from the Australian cricket team&#x27;s 2008 tour of the West Indies due to the death of Bingle&#x27;s father. The pair never married, and they ended their relationship in March 2010, with Clarke leaving the Australian cricket team&#x27;s ongoing tour of New Zealand to call off their engagement.

Clarke married business owner and model Kyly Boldy on 15 May 2012. The couple went to school together at Westfield Sports High School in Sydney and have one daughter. They announced their separation on 12 February 2020 and said that they had officially separated 5 months earlier. In 2020, Clarke dated fashion business owner Pip Edwards, but their relationship ended in early 2021.

He was very close to former Australian Test opener Phillip Hughes, and was distraught at the 25-year-old&#x27;s unexpected death after being hit in the neck by a short-pitched delivery during a Sheffield Shield match at the SCG in November 2014. Clarke gave an emotional speech at Hughes&#x27;s funeral. He requested Cricket Australia to retire Hughes&#x27;s shirt number, 64, which was accepted.

In 2016, Clarke published an autobiography, &quot;My Story&quot;.

In September 2019, Clarke had a skin cancer removed from his forehead. He was first diagnosed with skin cancer in 2006 and became an ambassador for the Cancer Council in 2010.

In January 2023, Clarke and his partner Jade Yarbrough were involved in a public dispute in Noosa. The incident, which was caught on camera, appears to show Yarbrough slap Clarke and accuse him of cheating on her. Yarbrough&#x27;s brother-in-law and &quot;Today Show&quot; host Karl Stefanovic was also involved in the incident.

==Media career==

Between 2016 and 2018, Clarke was a cricket commentator for Nine&#x27;s Wide World of Sports. In 2020, Clarke began co-hosting the &quot;Big Sports Breakfast&quot; radio show.

<text>Adam Craig Gilchrist (; born 14 November 1971) is an Australian cricket commentator and former international cricketer and captain of the Australia national cricket team. He was an attacking left-handed batsman and record-breaking wicket-keeper, who redefined the role for the Australia national team through his aggressive batting. Widely regarded as the greatest wicket-keeper-batsman in the history of the game, Gilchrist held the world record for the most dismissals by a wicket-keeper in One Day International (ODI) cricket until it was surpassed by Kumar Sangakkara in 2015 and the most by an Australian in Test cricket. Gilchrist was a member of the Australian team that won three consecutive world titles in a row: the 1999 Cricket World Cup, the 2003 Cricket World Cup, and the 2007 Cricket World Cup, along with winning the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy.

His strike rate is amongst the highest in the history of both ODI and Test cricket; his 57 ball century against England at Perth in December 2006 is the fourth-fastest century in all Test cricket. He was the first player to have hit 100 sixes in Test cricket. His 17 Test centuries and 16 in ODIs are both second only to Sangakkara by a wicket-keeper. He holds the unique record of scoring at least 50 runs in successive World Cup finals (in 1999, 2003 and 2007). His 149 off 101 balls against Sri Lanka in the 2007 World Cup final is rated one of the greatest World Cup innings of all time. He is one of only three players to have won three World Cup titles.

Gilchrist was renowned for walking when he considered himself to be out, sometimes contrary to the decision of the umpire. He made his first-class debut in 1992, his first One-Day International appearance in 1996 in India and his Test debut in 1999. During his career, he played for Australia in 96 Test matches and over 270 One-day internationals. He was Australia&#x27;s regular vice-captain in both forms of the game, captaining the team when regular captains Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting were unavailable. He retired from international cricket in March 2008, though he continued to play domestic tournaments until 2013.

==Early and personal life==
Adam Gilchrist was born in 1971 at Bellingen Hospital, in Bellingen, New South Wales, the youngest of four children. He and his family lived in Dorrigo, Junee and then Deniliquin where, playing for his school, Deniliquin South Public School, he won the Brian Taber Shield (named after New South Wales cricketer Brian Taber). When Adam was 13, his parents, Stan and June, moved the family to Lismore where he captained the Kadina High School cricket team.

Gilchrist was selected for the state under-17 team, and in 1989 he was offered a scholarship by London-based Richmond Cricket Club, a scheme he now supports himself. During his year at Richmond, he also played junior cricket for Old Actonians Cricket Club&#x27;s under-17 team, with whom he won the Middlesex League and Cup double. He moved to Sydney and joined the Gordon District Cricket Club in Sydney Grade Cricket, later moving to Northern Districts.

Gilchrist is married to his high school sweetheart Melinda ( Sharpe), a dietitian, and they have three sons and a daughter. His family came under the spotlight in the months leading up to the 2007 Cricket World Cup as one impending birth threatened his presence in the squad; the child was born in February and Gilchrist was able to take part in the tournament.

==Domestic career==
In 1991, Gilchrist was selected for the Australia Young Cricketers, a national youth team that toured England and played in youth ODIs and Tests. Gilchrist scored a century and a fifty in the three Tests. Upon his return to Australia late in the year, Gilchrist was accepted into the Australian Cricket Academy. Over the next year, Gilchrist represented the ACA as they played matches against the Second XI of Australia&#x27;s state teams, and toured South Africa to play provincial youth teams.

Upon returning to Australia, Gilchrist scored two centuries in four matches for the state Colts and Second XI teams, and was rewarded with selection to make his first-class debut for New South Wales during the 1992–93 season, although he played purely as a batsman, due to the presence of incumbent wicketkeeper Phil Emery.

In his first season, the side won the Sheffield Shield, Gilchrist scoring an unbeaten 20 in the second innings to secure an easy win over Queensland in the final. Gilchrist made 274 runs at an average of 30.44 in his debut season, a score of 75 being his only effort beyond fifty. He also made his debut in Mercantile Mutual limited overs competition. He struggled to keep his place in the side, playing only three first-class matches in the following season. He scored on 43 runs at 8.60; New South Wales won both competitions, but Gilchrist was overlooked for both finals and did not play a single limited overs match.

Due to a lack of opportunities in the dominant New South Wales outfit, Gilchrist joined Western Australia at the start of the 1994–95, where he had to compete with former Test player Tim Zoehrer for the wicket-keeper&#x27;s berth. Gilchrist had no guarantee of selection. However, he made a century in a pre-season trial match and seized Zoehrer&#x27;s place. The local fans were initially hostile to the move, but Gilchrist won them over. He made 55 first-class dismissals in his first season, the most by any wicketkeeper in Australian domestic cricket in 1994–95. However, he struggled with the bat, scoring 398 runs at 26.53 with seven single figure scores, although he recorded his maiden first-class century in the latter stages of the season, with 126 against South Australia. Gilchrist was rewarded with selection in the Young Australia team that toured England in 1995 and played matches against the English counties. Gilchrist starred with bat, scoring 490 runs at 70.00 with two centuries.

His second season based in Perth saw him top of the dismissals again, with 58 catches and four stumpings, but, significantly, 835 runs at an impressive batting average of 50.52.

The Warriors made it to the final of the Sheffield Shield, at the Adelaide Oval, where Gilchrist scored 189 not out in the first innings, from only 187 balls, including five sixes. The innings brought Gilchrist national prominence. The match ended in a thrilling draw as South Australia&#x27;s last-wicket pair held on to fend off the visitors. The hosts thus took the title, having scored more points in the qualifying matches. Gilchrist also scored an unbeaten 76 to help Western Australia secure a narrow three-wicket victory over New South Wales in the penultimate limited overs match of the season, which saw them into the final against Queensland, which was lost.

Gilchrist&#x27;s form saw him selected for Australia A, a team comprising players close to national selection. At the start of the 1996–97 season, sections of the media advocated that he replace Ian Healy as the national wicket-keeper, but Healy struck 161 in the First Test and maintained his position. Gilchrist continued to perform strongly on the domestic circuit he topped the dismissals count once again, with 62, along with a batting average of just under 40, although he failed to post a century.

Team success came in the Mercantile Mutual Cup, where the Warriors won by eight wickets against Queensland in the March 1997 final; Gilchrist was not required to bat.

The 1997–98 season ended with Gilchrist top of the dismissals chart for the fourth season in a row with an improved batting average of 47.66, despite playing in only six of the ten qualifying Shield matches due to his becoming a regular member of the national limited overs team. Gilchrist registered his maiden–first-class double century with an unbeaten 203 against South Australia early in the season, before returning late in the season after his international commitments were over. He added 109 against Victoria, and played in the Sheffield Shield final victory over Tasmania, although he scored only eight. There was disappointment for the team in the Mercantile Mutual Cup, losing the semi-final to Queensland.

The following season saw Gilchrist&#x27;s domestic appearances diminish due to his international commitments: he made only a single appearance in the Mercantile Mutual Cup, but still managed to help Western Australia defend the Sheffield Shield, scoring a century in the qualifying rounds.

Gilchrist&#x27;s regular selection for Australia meant that he was rarely available for domestic selection after he became the Test wicket-keeper in late-1999; between 1999 and 2005, he made only seven first-class appearances for his state.

He did not play in the 2005–06 Pura Cup and only appeared three times in the limited-overs ING Cup.

===Indian Premier League===
Gilchrist played a total of six seasons in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the major Twenty20 franchise league in India, three for Deccan Chargers and three for Kings XI Punjab. He was signed by Deccan for the 2008 season, the inaugural season of the competition, having been purchased for US$700,000 in the player auction a few months after his retirement from international cricket.

Before the fourth season of the IPL Gilchrist was bought at the 2011 player auction by Kings XI Punjab for US$900,000 and was, again, appointed as captain, taking over from Kumar Sangakkara who had moved to Deccan. In March 2012 he was named player-coach of the side for the following season, replacing his friend and former Australia teammate Michael Bevan, whose contract as head coach was not renewed. After the team failed to make the play-offs, Gilchrist speculated that he may choose to retire from cricket.

Following the appointment of Darren Lehmann, who had previously worked with Gilchrist at Deccan, as head coach, Gilchrist chose to play one more IPL season for Kings XI, once again as captain. In May 2013, Gilchrist announced his retirement from the IPL. A planned appearance in the first season of the Caribbean Premier League had to be cancelled after an ankle injury and the match proved to be Gilchrist&#x27;s last in top-class cricket. In that fixture, Gilchrist took the wicket of Harbhajan Singh, from his one and only ball he ever bowled in a T20 match.

Over his six seasons in the IPL Gilchrist played a total of 82 matches, 48 for Deccan and 34 for Kings XI. He scored more than 2,000 runs, including two centuries. He was also the first cricketer to score 1000 runs in IPL.

===Middlesex===
Gilchrist signed a short-term contract in November 2009 to play Twenty20 cricket for Middlesex County Cricket Club in England during 2010. He was appointed interim captain of the T20 side on 11 June following the sudden resignation of Shaun Udal. He played in seven matches for the side during the 2010 Twenty20 Cup, scoring 212 runs at an average of 30.28, including a century made against Kent at Canterbury, as well as captaining the county against the touring Australians in a one-day match ahead of their ODI series against England. The season was Gilchrist&#x27;s only one spent playing county cricket.

==International career==
===Early one-day seasons===

Gilchrist was called up for the Australian One Day International (ODI) team in 1996, his debut coming against South Africa at Faridabad on 25 October 1996 as the 129th Australian ODI cap, after an injury to incumbent Ian Healy. While not particularly impressive with the bat on his debut, scoring 18 before being bowled by Allan Donald, Gilchrist took his first catch as an international wicketkeeper, Hansie Cronje departing for a golden duck from the bowling of Paul Reiffel. He was run out for a duck in his only other ODI on the tour. Healy resumed his place during the 1996–97 season. Gilchrist replaced Healy for the first two ODIs in the 1997 Australian tour of South Africa, after Healy was suspended for dissent. When Healy returned Gilchrist maintained his position in the team as a specialist batsman after Mark Waugh sustained a hand injury.

It was during this series that Gilchrist made his first ODI half-century, with an innings of 77 in Durban. He totalled 127 runs at 31.75 for the series. Gilchrist went on to play in the Texaco Trophy later in 1997 in the 3–0 series loss against England, scoring 53 and 33 in two innings.

At the start of the 1997–98 Australian season, Healy and captain Mark Taylor were omitted from the ODI squad as the Australian selectors opted for Gilchrist and Michael di Venuto. Gilchrist&#x27;s elevation was made possible by a change in policy by selectors, who announced that selection for ODI and Test teams would be separate, with Test and ODI specialists selected accordingly, while Healy remained the preferred Test wicket-keeper. This came after Australia failed to qualify for the previous season&#x27;s ODI triangular series final for the first time in 17 years. The new team was initially unconvincing, losing all four round robin matches against South Africa in the 1997–98 Carlton &amp; United Series, with multiple players filling Taylor&#x27;s role as Mark Waugh&#x27;s opening partner without success. Gilchrist also struggled batting in the lower order at number seven, the conventional wicket-keeper&#x27;s batting position, scoring 148 runs at 24.66 in the eight qualifying matches.

In the first final against South Africa at the Melbourne Cricket Ground Gilchrist was selected as Waugh&#x27;s opening partner. In a particularly poor start to the new combination, Waugh was run out after a mix-up with Gilchrist. However, in the second final, Gilchrist struck his maiden ODI century, spearheading Australia&#x27;s successful run chase at the Sydney Cricket Ground, securing his position as an opening batsman. Australia won the third final to claim the title.

Touring New Zealand in February 1998, Gilchrist topped the Australia averages with 200 runs at 50.00, including a match-winning 118 in the first match. He also effected his first ODI stumping, the wicket of Nathan Astle in the Second ODI in Wellington. Australia then played two triangular tournaments in Asia. Gilchrist struggled in India, scoring 86 runs at 17.20. He went on to play in the Coca-Cola Cup in Sharjah in April 1998, a triangular tournament between Australia, India and New Zealand. Australia finished runners-up in the tournament, with Gilchrist taking nine dismissals as wicketkeeper and averaging 37.13 with the bat.

Gilchrist won a silver medal at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, the only time men&#x27;s cricket has been in the Commonwealth Games. The matches did not have ODI status, and after winning their first four fixtures, Australia lost the final to South Africa, Gilchrist making 15. He then scored 103 and ended with 190 runs at 63.33 as Australia took a rare 3–0 whitewash on Pakistani soil.

Gilchrist was in fine form ahead of the 1999 Cricket World Cup with a productive individual performance in the Carlton &amp; United Series in January and February 1999 against Sri Lanka and England. He finished with 525 runs at a batting average of 43.75 with two centuries—both against Sri Lanka—and a fifty, and a total of 27 dismissals in 12 matches. His 131 helped Australia set a successful run-chase at the SCG, and he followed this with 154 at the MCG.
The 1999 tour of the West Indies was Australia&#x27;s last campaign before the World Cup and continued to prove Gilchrist&#x27;s ability as a wicketkeeper-batsman. Gilchrist, with a batting average of 28.71 and a strike rate of nearly 90.00, and seven fielding dismissals in a seven-match series which ended 3–3 with one tie.

===First World Cup success===

Gilchrist played in every match of Australia&#x27;s successful World Cup campaign, but struggled at first, with scores of 6, 14 and 0 in the first three matches against Scotland, New Zealand and Pakistan. Australia lost the latter two matches and had to avoid defeat for six consecutive matches to reach the final. Gilchrist&#x27;s quick-fire 63 runs in 39 balls against Bangladesh helped the Australians into the Super Six stage of the tournament, which was secured with a win over the West Indies, although Gilchrist made only 21. Gilchrist continued to struggle in the Super Six phase, scoring 31, 10 and 5 against India, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Australia won all three matches, the last in the final over, to scrape into the semifinals. Gilchrist made only 20 in the semifinal against South Africa, but completed the final act of the match. With the scores tied, South Africa were going for the winning run when Gilchrist broke the stumps to complete the run out of Allan Donald; the match was tied, and Australia proceeded to the final as they had won the group stage match against South Africa. Gilchrist&#x27;s 54 in the final helped secure Australia&#x27;s first world title since 1987 with an eight wicket victory over Pakistan. It was a happy ending for Gilchrist, who had struggled through the tournament, with 237 runs at 21.54.

Success at the World Cup was followed by a defeat by Sri Lanka in the final of the Aiwa Cup in August 1999. Gilchrist was the most successful batsman and wicket-keeper of the tournament, with 231 runs at 46.20. While the Test players battled against Sri Lanka, Gilchrist led Australia A in a limited overs series against India A in Los Angeles. He then scored 60 runs at 20.00 as the Australians completed a 3–0 whitewash of Zimbabwe in October.

===Test debut===
Gilchrist made his Test match debut in the First Test against Pakistan at the Gabba in Brisbane in November 1999 becoming the 381st Australian Test cricketer. He replaced Healy, who was dropped after a run of poor form, despite the incumbent&#x27;s entreaties to the selectors to allow him a farewell game in front of his home crowd. Gilchrist&#x27;s entry into the Test arena coincided with a dramatic rise in Australia&#x27;s fortunes. Up to this point, they had played eight Tests in 1999, winning and losing three.

Gilchrist&#x27;s icy reception at the Gabba did not faze him; he took five catches, stumped Azhar Mahmood off Shane Warne&#x27;s bowling and scored a rapid 81, mostly in partnership with ODI partner Waugh, in a match that Australia won comfortably by ten wickets. In his second Test match he made an unbeaten 149 to help guide Australia to victory in a game that looked well beyond their reach. Australia were struggling at 5/126 in pursuit of 369 for victory as he joined his Western Australian teammate, Justin Langer, but the pair put on a record-breaking partnership of 238 to seal an Australian win. Gilchrist continued his strong run throughout his debut Test season, and ended the summer with 485 runs at 69.28 in six matches, three each against Pakistan and India, adding two fifties against the latter.

Gilchrist was moderately successful in the following ODIs, the Carlton &amp; United Series; Australia defeated Pakistan 2–0 in a best-of-three final. Gilchrist scored 272 runs at 27.20; his best effort was 92 in a 152-run victory over India on Australia Day. Gilchrist then scored 251 runs at 41.66 in the ODIs during a tour of New Zealand. The highlight was a 128 in Christchurch that propelled Australia to a score of 6/349. Gilchrist was named man of the match in two of the games.

In the Third Test against New Zealand in 2000, Gilchrist recorded the third best Test performance ever by a wicketkeeper, and the best by an Australian, taking ten catches in the match. Although Gilchrist&#x27;s batting was modest, yielding 144 runs at 36.00, Australia took a 3–0 clean sweep. In two home and away ODI series against South Africa, Gilchrist had a quiet time, scoring 170 runs at 26.66. South Africa won three of the six matches, with one tie.

Later that year, he was handed the vice-captaincy of the Australian team in place of Shane Warne, who had been plagued by a number of off-field controversies, including an altercation with some teenage boys, and a sex scandal with a British nurse.

The 2000–01 season saw a West Indian touring party and Gilchrist warmed up with consecutive first-class centuries for Western Australia. Captaining his Test team for the first time in place of the injured Steve Waugh in the Third Test in Adelaide. Gilchrist scored only 9 and 10 not out, but a ten-wicket haul from Colin Miller resulted in a hard-fought five-wicket victory for Australia. Gilchrist described the match as &quot;the proudest moment of my career&quot;. Waugh resumed the captaincy on his return to the team for the Fourth and Fifth Tests, with the series finishing in a 5–0 whitewash. Gilchrist scored 241 runs at 48.20 with two fifties. In the ensuing ODI tournament, Gilchrist scored 326 runs at 36.22 with a top-score of 98 as the Australians won all ten matches.

Up to this point, Gilchrist had played in 14 Tests, all in Australasia, and all of which had been won. Australia&#x27;s run of 15 consecutive Test wins faced a steep challenge on the tour of India, where they had not won a Test series since 1969–70.

Australia&#x27;s streak looked in danger during the First Test in Mumbai when they fell to 5/99 in reply to India&#x27;s 171 when Gilchrist came to the crease. He counterattacked savagely, scoring 122 in just 112 balls, and featuring in a 197-run partnership with Matthew Hayden in only 32 overs. This swung the momentum back to Australia, who reached 349. Gilchrist took six catches and was named Man of the Match in a ten wicket victory, extending the world record run to 16.

Gilchrist&#x27;s form dipped momentarily, with a rare &quot;king pair&quot; (two golden ducks in the same match) in the Second Test in Kolkata and just two runs in his two innings in Chennai. He was out LBW four consecutive times in the last two Tests, three of these to Harbhajan Singh, who took 32 wickets in the series to end Australia&#x27;s run by inflicting a 2–1 series loss. His one-day form remained strong, with 172 runs at 43.00 in the ODI series in India, as Australia bounced back to win the series 3–2. During this series he captained the ODI team for the first time, winning all three of the matches under his captaincy.

===2001 Ashes===

Gilchrist played a pivotal role in the 2001 Ashes series which Australia won 4–1, with 340 runs at a batting average of 68.00 and 26 dismissals in the five-match series.

Gilchrist warmed up by putting his ODI struggles on English soil in 1999 behind him, scoring 248 runs at 49.60 in the triangular tournament preceding the Tests, scoring an unbeaten 76 in the final win over Pakistan.

Gilchrist put the disappointment of India behind him in the First Test at Edgbaston, scoring 152 from only 143 balls. The allowed Australia to reach 576 in only 545 minutes, and set up an innings victory that set the tone for the series. Gilchrist then added 90 in the eight-wicket win in the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s, before turning the tide in the Third Test at Trent Bridge. Australia slumped to 7/105 in reply to the hosts&#x27; 185, but Gilchrist&#x27;s 54 took the tourists to 190 before a seven-wicket win resulted in the retention of the Ashes.

Gilchrist captained the team in the Fourth Test at Headingley after an injury to Steve Waugh. After persistent rain interruptions, Gilchrist declared with Australia four down at tea on the fourth day, leaving England with a target of 315, which, despite losing two early wickets, they reached with six wickets to spare, (Mark Butcher scoring an unbeaten 173, including 24 boundaries). Gilchrist failed to pass 25 in the last two Tests, but it had been a productive season; he scored centuries in both of Australia&#x27;s county matches.

Two home series followed in the 2001–02 season, a fully drawn (0–0) three match series against New Zealand and a whitewash over South Africa 3–0. Gilchrist scored 118 in the First Test against New Zealand and an unbeaten 83 in the Third Test in Perth as the Australians held on for a draw with three wickets intact. However, Gilchrist did little in the triumph over South Africa, failing to pass 35. He ended the summer Tests with 353 runs at 50.42.

In the ensuing ODIs, Gilchrist scored only 97 runs at 16.16. The Australian selectors sought to accommodate Hayden, who had been successful as a Test opener, into the ODI team by rotating him with Gilchrist and Waugh, but this appeared to unsettle the team. With a newly fragile top order, Australia failed to qualify for the finals, and the Waugh brothers were dropped from the team, ending Gilchrist&#x27;s four-year partnership with Mark. Ricky Ponting was promoted to the captaincy ahead of vice captain Gilchrist.

The Australians then toured South Africa the next month and it was during the First Test in Johannesburg that Gilchrist broke the record for the fastest double century in Tests on 23 February, requiring 212 balls for the feat. This was eight balls quicker than Ian Botham&#x27;s innings against India at The Oval in 1982. He ended unbeaten on 204, having featured in a partnership of 317 with Damien Martyn at a run rate of 5.5. South Africa were demoralised and lost by an innings after being forced to follow on. The record lasted only one month, however, with New Zealand&#x27;s Nathan Astle taking 59 balls less to reach the milestone during an innings in March 2002.

In the Second Test at Cape Town, Gilchrist struck 138 from 108 balls to set up a first innings lead and eventual four-wicket win. He then top-scored with 91 in the Third Test, and although Australia lost the match, Gilchrist ended the series with an astonishing 473 at 157.66 from just 474 balls, in addition to 14 dismissals.

Gilchrist captained the ODI team, once again for a single match, against Kenya in Nairobi during the PSO Tri-Nation Tournament. Despite Australia&#x27;s unbeaten run in the competition, the final, against Pakistan was abandoned due to rain, so the teams shared the trophy. During the six middle months of 2002, Gilchrist played in 18 ODIs, scoring 562 runs at 31.22, including a century, recovering from his slump.

After scoring 122 runs at 40.66 in the 3–0 Test series clean sweep over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, Gilchrist went on to help the Australians retain The Ashes 4–1 in 2002–03, playing in all five matches of the series, finishing with 330 runs at 55.50 and taking 25 dismissals as wicket-keeper. After scoring fifties in the first two Tests, Gilchrist scored a counter-attacking 133 from 121 balls in the Fifth Test at the SCG, but was unable to prevent Australia&#x27;s only loss of the series.

From the time of his debut up to the 2003 World Cup, Gilchrist&#x27;s played in 40 Tests in series. With the exception of the 2001 tour of India, when he averaged 24.80 (he made 124 runs in the series; 122 of them came in one innings), his performances with the bat were such that he was described at the time as the &quot;finest batsman-wicketkeeper to have graced the game&quot;. At one point in March 2002, Gilchrist&#x27;s Test average was over 60; the second-highest for any established player in Test history, and he topped the ICC Test batting rankings in May 2002.

Gilchrist warmed up for the World Cup in South Africa by scoring 310 runs at 44.28 in the triangular tournament in Australia against England and Sri Lanka. His performances over the past year were recognised with the Allan Border Medal.

===2003 World Cup===

Gilchrist played in all but one of the matches in Australia&#x27;s successful defence of their World Cup title; he was rested for the group match against the Netherlands. He finished the tournament with 408 runs at an average of 40.80 at a strike rate of 105. He scored four half-centuries, and was run out against Sri Lanka in the Super Six stage just a single run short of a century. In the semi-final, he scored 22 before being caught off an inside-edge onto pad off the bowling of Aravinda de Silva. The umpire gave no reaction, however Gilchrist walked off the pitch after a moment&#x27;s pause. In 2009 it was described as an &quot;astonishing moment&quot; drawing criticism from England&#x27;s Angus Fraser, who &quot;objected to him being canonised simply for not cheating&quot;, and from others who &quot;thought that he walked almost by accident; that having played his shot he overbalanced in the direction of the pavilion.&quot; His actions nevertheless drew praise from the majority. In the final, India elected to field first and Gilchrist hammered 57 from 48 balls, featuring in a century opening stand with Hayden to seize the initiative. This laid the foundation for Australia&#x27;s 2/359 and a crushing 125-run win, ending an unbeaten campaign. Gilchrist was also the competition&#x27;s most successful wicketkeeper, making 21 dismissals.

Success in the World Cup was followed up by a tour of the West Indies where Gilchrist was part of a side that won both the ODI and Test series. He scored 282 runs at 70.50 with one century in the four Tests, and 212 runs at 35.33 in the ODIs. The Australians then defeated a touring Bangladeshi cricket team in short series in both forms of the game. Gilchrist was only sporadically required with the bat.

===Decline and revival===
After scoring his first Test century at his home ground in Perth, an unbeaten 113 against Zimbabwe, Gilchrist&#x27;s Test form dipped again during the 2003–04 season, with only 120 runs coming in the next 10 innings, during the home series against India (drawn 1–1) and the away series in Sri Lanka (won 3–0). However, he returned to form in the Second Test Kandy, scoring a quickfire 144 in the second innings to set up a 27-run win after Australia conceded a 91-run first innings lead.

However, he maintained high standards in ODIs during this period, including 111 against India in Bangalore, 172 against Zimbabwe, just one run short of Mark Waugh&#x27;s Australian record, and two further half-centuries in the VB Series in Australia. His success in One-day cricket was underlined by his rise to the top of the ICC ODI batting rankings in February 2004. However, he was unable to maintain this form on the 2004 tours of Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and the Champions Trophy in England, accumulating 253 runs at 28.11 in 11 innings.

Gilchrist then scored 115 runs at 28.75 in two Tests at home to Sri Lanka in mid-2004, and captained in the First Test win in Darwin with Ponting absent. Australia won the series 1–0.

A 104 in the First Test against India in October 2004 proved to be a false renaissance; he scored only 104 runs in the remaining seven innings on the Indian tour and 139 runs in eight ODI innings towards the end of the 2004–05 season, which formed the lowest average period of Gilchrist&#x27;s career until 2007. He took the captaincy of the Test team once again, in place of the injured Ricky Ponting, and led the Australian side to a historic 2–1 series victory in India, a feat last achieved in 1969. Ponting recovered to lead the team in the Fourth Test, Australia&#x27;s only loss.

Gilchrist returned to form when New Zealand toured Australia at the start of southern hemisphere season. He scored 126 and 50 in the 2–0 Test series clean sweep and scored fifties in both ODIs. He then scored 230 runs at 76.66 in three Tests against Pakistan, including a rapid 113 in the Third Test at the SCG as Australia won all five Tests during the summer. He made it three successive Test centuries with 121 and 162 in the first two Tests on the tour of New Zealand, before ending with an unbeaten 60 in the Third Test; he totalled 343 runs at 114.33 for the series. His ODI form in the early part of 2005 remained moderate, with 308 runs at 28.00 during the southern summer.

Gilchrist was in strong form ahead of the Tests, scoring 393 runs at 49.13 in the ODIs in England. The highlight was the 121 not out in the final game of the one-day NatWest Series, Gilchrist being awarded the man-of-the-match award. However, he performed poorly in the five Tests, with 204 runs at 25.50. Just as in India in 2001, Australia lost 2–1.

Australia and Gilchrist returned to form after the Ashes in the series against the ICC World XI. Gilchrist scored 45, 103 and 32 as Australia swept the ODIs 3–0, and top-scored with 94 in the first innings of the one-off Test, which Australia won. However, this did not transfer into the regular international matches. In six home Tests against the West Indies and South Africa in 2005–06, Gilchrist managed only 190 runs at 23.75, but Australia was unhindered, winning 3–0 and 2–0 respectively.
His one-day form also began to suffer, scoring only 11 runs in three ODIs in New Zealand and 13 in the first two matches of the VB Series. He was rested for two games and returned to form against Sri Lanka on 29 January 2006 on his home ground, the WACA, hitting 116 runs off 105 balls to lead Australia to victory. He continued in this vein with the fastest ever century by an Australian in just 67 balls against Sri Lanka at the Gabba, ending with 122 as Australia won the deciding third final by nine wickets. After a slow start, he ended the series with 432 runs at 48.00.

The purple patch ended on the tour of South Africa and then Bangladesh. He scored 206 runs at 29.42 in five Tests and 248 runs at 35.42 in eight ODIs, inflated by a 144 in the First Test against Bangladesh. Despite this, Australia won all five Tests. Gilchrist scored 130 runs at 26.00, including a 92 against the West Indies as Australia won the 2006 Champions Trophy in India.

On 16 December 2006, during the Third Ashes Test at the WACA, Gilchrist scored a century in 57 balls, including twelve fours and four sixes, which at the time was the second fastest recorded Test century. At 97 runs from 54 balls, Gilchrist needed three runs from the next delivery to better Viv Richards&#x27; record set in 1986. The ball delivered by Matthew Hoggard was wide and Gilchrist was unable to score from it.
He later claimed that the &quot;batting pyrotechnics&quot; had been the result of a miscommunication between Michael Clarke and him with the Australian captain Ricky Ponting; Gilchrist had actually been told &quot;not&quot; to score quick runs with a view to declaring the innings.

He ended the 2006–07 Ashes with a century and two fifties, totalling 229 runs at 45.80 at a strike rate of over 100 as Australia regained the Ashes with a 5–0 whitewash. It was an inconsistent series; aside from three scores mentioned, Gilchrist failed to pass one in his other three innings. Between Ashes series, Gilchrist had averaged only 25 with one Test century.

However, both he and Australia suffered a surprising string of poor results in the 2006–07 Commonwealth Bank Series, Gilchrist managing an average of only 22.20 during the tournament. Australia won seven of their eight qualifying matches, but England won with two finals victories over the Australians. Gilchrist scored 60 and 61 in the first two matches but did not pass 30 thereafter. He was then rested for Australia&#x27;s winless three-match ODI tour of New Zealand, before his selection for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Having previously indicated that it was highly likely that he would retire after the 2007 World Cup, he then stated a desire to play on afterwards.

===2007 World Cup===

Gilchrist and Australia started their 2007 World Cup campaign by winning all three of their matches in Group A, against Scotland, the Netherlands and South Africa. Australia won all seven of their matches in the Super8 stage with little difficulty—the margins of victory exceeded 80 runs or six wickets in every instance. They topped the table and thus qualifying for a semi-final rematch against fourth-placed South Africa. Gilchrist opened the Australian batting in each match, taking a pinch-hitting role in the opening powerplays. Initially successful in the group matches, scoring 46, 57 and 42, he failed in the first Super8 match against West Indies (7), but bounced back to score a second half-century (59 not out) in a ten-wicket victory against Bangladesh in a match drastically shortened due to rain. After a run of middling scores, he failed again in the final Super8 match against New Zealand.

As a batsman, Gilchrist was dismissed for a single run in the semi-final against South Africa, despite which Australia won by seven wickets. Gilchrist opened the batting against Sri Lanka in the final. This was Gilchrist&#x27;s third successive World Cup final, and the third time he scored at least 50 runs in a World Cup final and he went on to make his only ever century in a world cup match (his previous best World Cup score having been 99 against Sri Lanka in the 2003 tournament). Gilchrist went on to score 149 runs off 104 balls with thirteen fours and eight sixes, the highest individual score in a World Cup final, eclipsing his captain Ricky Ponting&#x27;s score of 140 in the 2003 final. Australia won and he was named the man of the match. Subsequently there has been some controversy over Gilchrist&#x27;s use of a squash ball inside his glove during this innings.
The MCC stated that Gilchrist had not acted against the laws or the spirit of the game, since there is no restriction against the external or internal form of batting gloves.
In September 2007, Gilchrist played in the inaugural World Twenty20. He scored 169 runs at 33.80 as Australia were knocked out by India in the semifinals. Gilchrist then scored 208 runs at 34.66 as Australia took an away ODI series against India 4–2. In November, Gilchrist&#x27;s peers voted him the greatest Australian ODI cricketer ever, for which he was awarded an honour at an ACA function before Australia&#x27;s second Test against Sri Lanka. He was only required to bat once in the Tests, and made 67 not out as Australia swept Sri Lanka aside 2–0.

===Retirement===
On 26 January 2008 during the 4th and final Test of the 2007–08 series against India, Gilchrist announced that he would retire from international cricket at the end of the season. A back injury kept Ricky Ponting off the field for sections of the Indian&#x27;s second innings, resulting in Gilchrist captaining the team for part of the final two days of his Test cricket career. India batted out the match for a draw, so Gilchrist&#x27;s 14 in the first innings was his final Test innings; he took his 379th and final catch when Virender Sehwag was caught behind. Gilchrist had scored only 150 runs at 21.42 in his final Test series.

John Buchanan, who coached Australia during most of Gilchrist&#x27;s international career, predicted that Gilchrist&#x27;s retirement would have more impact than the previous year&#x27;s retirements of Damien Martyn, Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne and Justin Langer and Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd asked Gilchrist to reconsider. Gilchrist later revealed that he chose to retire after dropping VVS Laxman during the first innings, and realising that he had lost his &quot;competitive edge.&quot; He played out the summer&#x27;s ODI series, before ending in disappointment when India beat Australia 2–0 in the 2007–08 Commonwealth Bank Series finals. Gilchrist managed only seven and two in the finals. His highlight of the series was his scoring 118 and being named Man of the Match in his final match at his adopted home in Perth on 15 February 2008, against Sri Lanka. He ended his final series with 322 runs at 32.20.

==Playing style==

Gilchrist&#x27;s attacking batting was a key part of Australia&#x27;s one-day success, as he usually opened the batting. He was a part of the successful 1999, 2003 and 2007 Cricket World Cup campaigns. Gilchrist&#x27;s Test batting average in the upper 40s is unusually high for a wicket-keeper. He retired from Test cricket at 45th on the all–time list of highest batting averages. At the end of his Test career he had established a Test strike-rate of 82 runs per hundred balls, at the time the third highest since balls were recorded in full. His combination of attack and consistency create one of the most dynamic world cricketers ever, playing shots to all areas of the field with uncommon timing. He was second on the all-time list of most sixes in Tests at 100 with only Brendon McCullum ahead of him with 107. Gilchrist&#x27;s skills as a wicket-keeper were sometimes questioned; some claimed that he was the best keeper in Australia whilst others that Victorian wicket-keeper Darren Berry was the best Australian wicket-keeper of the 1990s and early 2000s. Gilchrist attributed his batting techniques from early training with his father, where he would defend shots, sometimes only gripping the bat with his top (right) hand, and would end a session to simply play attacking shots with tennis balls to end on a positive and fun note. He also adopted a naturally high grip where both hands were closer to the end of the handle for more top hand control.

Gilchrist successfully kept wicket for fast bowlers Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee for most of his international career. His partnerships with McGrath and Lee are second and fourth respectively in both test and ODI history for the number of wickets taken. With Alec Stewart and Mark Boucher, he shares the record for most catches (6) by a wicketkeeper in a ODI match, having achieved this feat five times. In 2007 he took six dismissals and scored a half century in the same ODI for the second time; he remains the only player to do so even once. At Old Trafford in August 2005, he passed Alec Stewart&#x27;s world record of 4,540 runs as a Test wicketkeeper, and at his retirement in 2008, he was the most successful ODI wicket-keeper with 472 dismissals (417 catches and 55 stumpings), more than 80 dismissals ahead of his closest rival, Mark Boucher. This record was surpassed seven years later by Kumar Sangakkara.

==Walking and discipline==
It is unusual for professional batsmen to &quot;walk&quot;; that is, to agree that they have been dismissed and leave the field of play without waiting for (or contrary to) an umpire&#x27;s decision. Gilchrist reignited this debate by walking during a high-profile match, the 2003 World Cup semi-final against Sri Lanka, after the umpire ruled him to be not out. He has since proclaimed himself to be &quot;a walker&quot;, or a batsman who will consistently walk, and has done so on numerous occasions. On one occasion against Bangladesh, Gilchrist walked but TV replays failed to suggest any contact between his bat and the ball. Without such contact, he could not have been caught out. Ricky Ponting has declared on several occasions that he is not a walker but will leave it to each player to decide whether they wish to walk or not. While no other Australian top-order batsmen have expressly declared themselves to be walkers, lower-order batsmen Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz both walked during Test matches in India in 2004. In 2004, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming accused Gilchrist of conducting a &quot;walking crusade&quot; when Craig McMillan refused to walk after Gilchrist had caught him off an edge from the bowling of Jason Gillespie in the First Test in Brisbane. After the appeal was turned down by the umpire, who did not hear the edge, Gilchrist goaded McMillan about the edge, and McMillan&#x27;s angry response was picked up by the stump microphone: &quot;...not everyone is walking, Gilly ... not everyone has to walk, mate...&quot;. The taunt was arguably effective, however, as McMillan, perhaps distracted, missed the next ball and was given out leg before wicket. Gilchrist said in his autobiography that he had &quot;zero support in the team&quot; for his stance and that he felt that the topic made the dressing room uncomfortable. He added that he &quot;felt isolated&quot; and &quot;silently accused of betraying the team. Implicitly I was made to feel selfish, as if I was walking for the sake of my own clean image, thereby making everyone else look dishonest.&quot;

Gilchrist has been noted for his emotional outbursts on the cricket field, and has been fined multiple times for dissent against umpiring decisions. In January 2006, he was fined 40% of his match fee in an ODI against South Africa. In another instance, in early 2004 in Sri Lanka, Gilchrist audibly argued with umpire Peter Manuel after batting partner Andrew Symonds was given out. After the argument concluded, Manuel consulted umpiring partner Billy Bowden and reversed his decision, recalling Symonds to the crease. Gilchrist was also reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board for publicly questioning the legality of Muttiah Muralitharan&#x27;s bowling action in 2002, as his comments were found to be in breach of the clause in the player code of conduct relating to &quot;detrimental public comment&quot;.

During the 2003 World Cup, Gilchrist accused Pakistani wicket-keeper Rashid Latif of making a racist remark towards him while the latter was batting in their group match. Latif who was cleared by match referee Clive Lloyd, threatened to sue Gilchrist for this claim.

==Achievements==
===Awards===
Gilchrist was one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 2002, and Australia&#x27;s One-day International Player of the Year in 2003 and 2004. He was awarded the Allan Border Medal in 2003, and was the only Australian cricketer who was a current player at the time to have been named in &quot;Richie Benaud&#x27;s Greatest XI&quot; in 2004. He was selected in the ICC World XI for the charity series against the ACC Asian XI, 2004–05, was voted as &quot;World&#x27;s Scariest Batsman&quot; in a poll of international bowlers, and was named as wicket-keeper and opening batsman in Australia&#x27;s &quot;greatest ever ODI team.&quot; In a poll of over ten thousand people hosted in 2007 by ESPNcricinfo, he was voted the ninth greatest all-rounder of the last one hundred years. A panel of prominent cricket writers selected him in Australia&#x27;s all-time best XI for ESPNcricinfo.
Gilchrist has not only left his mark on Australian cricket but the whole cricketing world.
In 2010, Gilchrist was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for his services to cricket and the community. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2012. On 9-December-2013, ICC announced that they had inducted Gilchrist in the prestigious ICC Hall of Fame. He was named an Australia Post Legend of Cricket in 2021.

==Autobiography==
Gilchrist&#x27;s autobiography &quot;True Colours&quot;, published in 2008, was the subject of much controversy. Gilchrist questioned the integrity of leading Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar in relation to the evidence he presented in the Monkeygate dispute, which was about allegations of racism against Harbhajan Singh. The autobiography said that Tendulkar told the first hearing that he could not hear what Harbhajan said to Andrew Symonds; Gilchrist said that he was &quot;certain he &quot;Tendulkar&quot; was telling the truth&quot; because he was &quot;a fair way away&quot;. Gilchrist then questioned why Tendulkar then agreed with Harbhajan&#x27;s claim at the second hearing that the exchange was an obscenity, and concluded that the process was &quot;a joke&quot;. He also raised questions over Tendulkar&#x27;s sportsmanship and said he was &quot;hard to find for a changing-room handshake after we have beaten India&quot;.

There was a backlash in India, which forced Gilchrist to clarify his position. Gilchrist later insisted that he did not accuse Tendulkar of lying in his testimony. He also denied calling the Indian a &quot;bad sport&quot; in regards to the handshake issue. Tendulkar responded by saying that &quot;those remarks came from someone who doesn&#x27;t know me enough. I think he made loose statements...I reminded him that I was the first person to shake hands after the Sydney defeat.&quot; The autobiography also blamed the ICC for allowing Sri Lankan cricketer Muralitharan to bowl; Gilchrist believes that ICC changed the throwing law to legitimise a bowling action that he regards as illegitimate. The law change was described as &quot;a load of horse crap. That&#x27;s rubbish.&quot; Gilchrist claimed that Muralitharan threw the ball and alleged that the ICC protected him because Sri Lankan cricket authorities portrayed any criticism of the bowler&#x27;s legitimacy as racism and a witch-hunt conducted by whites. In response to these comments, former Sri Lankan captain Marvan Atapattu said that by questioning the credentials of players like Muralitharan and Tendulkar, Gilchrist had done no good to his own reputation.

==Charity, media, business career and political work==

Outside cricket, Gilchrist is an ambassador for the charity World Vision in India, a country in which he is popular due to his cricketing achievements, and sponsors a boy whose father has died. He was approached in early 2005 by the US baseball franchise, the Boston Red Sox, with a view to him playing for them when his cricket career ended. However, he was selected for the 2007 Cricket World Cup and announced his retirement from Test and One-Day cricket in early 2008.

In March 2008, Gilchrist joined the Nine Network. Gilchrist has appeared as one of a panel of revolving co-hosts for the revived &quot;Wide World of Sports Weekend Edition&quot;. He made his debut on the program in March 2008, and commentates on Fox Sport&#x27;s cricket coverage during the Australian summer. In 2013 Gilchrist joined Ricky Ponting and various other names in cricket to commentate for Channel Ten in the third series of the Big Bash League.

As Amway Australia Ambassador, Gilchrist has played a role in many of their charity events. In August 2010, he presented the Freedom Wheels program, an initiative to provide modified bikes to kids with disabilities, a cheque for $20,000.

Gilchrist was the chair of the National Australia Day Council from 2008 to 2014. In 2008, Gilchrist supported debate on whether Australia Day should be moved to a new date because the current date marks British settlement of New South Wales and is offensive to many Aboriginal Australians.

Gilchrist has had a number of company directorships outside of cricket. His appointment to the board of ASX listed sandalwood company TFS Corporation, committee member of Commonwealth Business Forum in Perth and director of Travelex. The appointment to TFS Corporation was not without controversy when as a board member of TFS he was named as a plaintiff suing his own TFS shareholders for defamation

Gilchrist also plays himself on the Australian comedy series &quot;How to Stay Married&quot;.

<text>Simon Matthew Katich (born 21 August 1975) is an Australian cricket coach and former cricketer. He captained New South Wales and also, until the end of the 2007 season, Derbyshire County Cricket Club. Katich also played for Lancashire, represented his birth state of Western Australia and played in Indian Premier League for Kings XI Punjab. Katich was also a member of the Australian team that won the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy.

He played primarily as a left-handed opening batsman and part-time left-arm unorthodox spin bowler. He played 56 Test matches for Australia from 2001 to 2011. On 12 June 2012 Katich retired from first-class cricket in Australia, but returned to play for Western Australia in 2013. In August 2019, Katich was appointed as the head coach for Royal Challengers Bangalore, and was present at the 2020 IPL Player Auction in Kolkata in December 2019.

==International selection==
He was selected to tour Sri Lanka with the national team the following season but suffered greatly from illness, including a debilitating bout of chicken pox.

He recovered to contribute further for his state, highlighted in the 2000–01 domestic season where he helped himself to 1,282 first-class runs. He later switched from Western Australia to New South Wales where he currently lives.

Katich made his Test debut in the fourth Test of the 2001 Ashes tour of England. He failed to capitalize making only 15 and was not out 0. In only his second match he bowled for the first time in Test cricket, and in the second innings took 6/65 against Zimbabwe at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Following Steve Waugh&#x27;s retirement in 2004, Katich established himself in the Australian team. His best Test batting performance came against India at Sydney in January 2004, when his 125 and unbeaten 77 saved Australia the Test, series, and a decade long unbeaten record at home. Despite this, he was dropped in favour of Andrew Symonds for Australia&#x27;s next Test, in Sri Lanka, when Symonds was dropped after the first two Tests, Katich was picked for the third Test and made a patient 86. He regained his place and enjoyed a good Test series in India in October 2004, where he made good scores of 81 and 99. His good form continued with 118 against New Zealand in March 2005.

However, he had a poor Ashes tour of England later that year batting at number 6, and after scoring only two runs in the following two Tests (against the ICC World XI and the West Indies), he was dropped from the Test side. Katich was fined for showing dissent during the fourth Test to umpire Aleem Dar along with captain Ricky Ponting.

Since the commencement of the 2005–06 season, Katich attempted to cement his place in the Australian one day cricket side, having lost his Test place. Australia persisted with him throughout the VB Series and in South Africa, as Katich scored runs fairly consistently. However, he struggled in the DLF Cup in September 2006; the next month he lost his place at the top of the order to Shane Watson, who impressed Ponting with some attacking displays against the West Indies and an Indian state team. Katich was not picked in the 15 man squad to play in the World Cup in the West Indies. Katich played a total of 45 One day Internationals.

Selected for the 2008 Australian team&#x27;s tour of India he found himself opening the batting with the injury to Phil Jaques.

He retained his spot for the home series against New Zealand. In the first Test, at the Gabba, Brisbane, he made 10 in the first innings (in which Australia was all out for 214 on a tough batting deck). However, in the second innings, Katich carried his bat through the innings; the first cricketer to do so at Test level since Mark Taylor in the late 1990s. He made 131 not out, 48.88% of Australia&#x27;s total of 268, in an innings in which the next highest score was 31 (by Mitchell Johnson batting at no. 10). Katich&#x27;s batting allowed Australia to post a victory target of 327, which it ultimately defended.
Katich was selected for the 2009 tour to England and he played in all five Ashes Tests, scoring 341 runs in 8 innings at an average of 42.62. Katich opened the batting with Phillip Hughes for the first two Tests at Cardiff and Lord&#x27;s but Hughes was dropped for the Third Test at Edgbaston due to poor form, so Katich was then partnered by Shane Watson for the final three Tests. This proved successful as Watson and Katich scored more runs at the top of the order than the previous Hughes-Katich combination. Katich scored his eighth Test century in the First Test with 122. This was backed up later in the series with a half century. Katich scored these runs at a strike rate of 53.87. He also took six catches in the field and effected two direct hit run outs in the Fifth Test.

===2007–08 domestic season===
The 2007–08 domestic season could only be described as a triumph for Katich. He scored 1,506 runs to break Michael Bevan&#x27;s all-time Pura Cup/Sheffield Shield record for runs in a season as NSW romped home undefeated to claim their 45th title. Aside from being given the honour of captaining NSW in the Pura Cup final against Victoria, Katich also contributed scores of 86 and 92 to lead the match on run aggregate as he had done for the season overall. He was also crowned the Pura Cup player of the year for his 1506 runs at an average of 94.12. The highlight of Katich&#x27;s season was undoubtedly his 306 against QLD at the SCG, an innings in which the last 200 runs came at better than a run a ball. It was the first time since Sir Donald Bradman that a player had scored 300 at the SCG, and an innings which the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; called &quot;superb&quot;. Peter Roebuck later claimed Katich should be the Australian cricket captain after Ricky Ponting came under fire during the January 2008 SCG Test. During the coverage of the final, Damien Fleming described Katich as a left-handed V. V. S. Laxman for his dominant bottom hand and willingness to hit through the on-side. Katich&#x27;s season culminated with his recall to the national side for May tour of the West Indies. He cemented his place in the Test team with scores of 113 and 157 in the second and third Tests respectively.

For his performances in 2010, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC.

He was also awarded the Men&#x27;s Test Player of the Year at the Allan Border Medal ceremony by the CA in 2010.

Despite his heroics, Katich, a former team mainstay, blamed Michael Clarke for effectively ending his career once he became captain in revenge for a post-match incident several years earlier which saw Katich grab Clarke by the throat following a row about the singing of Australia&#x27;s team song in the dressing room.

==Coaching career==
In October 2015, Katich was appointed as an assistant coach of Indian Premier League side Kolkata Knight Riders. In 2019 he was appointed as head coach for Royal Challengers Bangalore. He was replaced during the 2021 IPL and in December 2021, Katich was named as assistant coach of Sunrisers Hyderabad for IPL 2022 season. On 18 February 2022, he resigned from the assistant coach role of Sunrisers Hyderabad due to differences with the franchise&#x27;s auction strategy. In September 2022, he was named as the head coach for MI Cape Town in the upcoming SA20 League.

==Personal life==
Katich attended Trinity College in Perth, Western Australia, where there is a cricket pavilion named after him. He married Georgie Willis in May 2006. He holds a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Western Australia.

Katich is of Croatian descent. His father&#x27;s parents were born in Croatia and emigrated to Australia in the 1920s, eventually settling in Perth. His father, Vince, was a police detective who helped play a part in the capture of serial killers David and Catherine Birnie.
Katich and his wife Georgie became parents in 2011 when their son was born.

Katich formerly held the role of football operations manager of the Greater Western Sydney Giants AFL club. 

Katich is Catholic and is quoted as saying, &quot;My faith gives me a focus in how I lead my life and go about my cricket.&quot;

<doc id="896434" wikidata="Q3520028" url="?curid=896434" title="Upul Chandana">
<text>Deshabandu Umagiliya Durage Upul Chandana (born 7 May 1972), popularly known as Upul Chandana, is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who played both Tests and ODIs. He was more specifically a leg spin bowler and was also an outstanding fielder. He was a part of the Sri Lankan squad which won the 1996 Cricket World Cup, however he did not play any matches during the tournament. Chandana is considered to be one of the best leg spinners who ever played for Sri Lanka. He was also a competent lower-order batsman, having scored a total of seven half-centuries at international level.

==School times==
Upul Chandana started his cricketing career as a teenager at Mahinda College, Galle.

==Domestic career==
Chandana has played county cricket in England for Gloucestershire County Cricket Club and represented Nondescripts in Sri Lankan. He made his Twenty20 debut on 17 August 2004, for Nondescripts Cricket Club in the 2004 SLC Twenty20 Tournament.

Chandana joined the Indian Cricket League, playing for the Kolkata Tigers and ICL World XI, and with four other Sri Lankan cricketers was banned, but the decision was lifted on 2009.

==International career==
Despite making his ODI debut in 1994 aged 21, Chandana had to wait for five years to be included in the Test team. It came in the Asian Test Championship Final in March 1999 against Pakistan. Chandana bowled 47.5 overs in the first innings and finished with 6 for 179.

Over the next few years he made sporadic appearances for Sri Lanka and in 2002 he was named as captain of Sri Lanka A, when they played an unofficial Test series against Kenya and Chandana topped both the batting and bowling averages. This helped him work his way back into the side in 2003 and after a match-winning innings against West Indies at Bridgetown, Chasing 313 for victory, he was promoted up the order to 5 and smashed 89 off just 71 deliveries with 6 sixes. Since then he was a regular player in the one day team for the next few years.

When Muttiah Muralitharan withdrew from the 2004 tour to Australia, Chandana came into the Test side as the main spin bowler. Despite being expensive, he took a ten wicket haul in the 2nd Test at Cazalys Stadium in Cairns and is the only Sri Lankan bowler to take ten wickets in a test match in Australia.

Upul Chandana has the record for the highest test score when batting at number 9 for Sri Lanka(92).

Chandana retired from international cricket on 15 October 2007 after Bangladesh tour. In an emotional press conference, he said that he was forced to take the retirement decision because of the politics that existed in the team selections.

<doc id="896435" wikidata="Q2662047" url="?curid=896435" title="Mediahuis Ireland">
<text>Mediahuis Ireland (formerly Independent News and Media, or INM) is a Belgian/Dutch-owned media organisation that is based in Dublin and publishes national daily newspapers, Sunday newspapers, regional newspapers and operates multiple websites including Independent.. Mediahuis Ireland operates throughout Ireland. Its titles include the highest circulation daily and Sunday papers in Ireland. Mediahuis Ireland is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mediahuis.

The INM group of companies was dominated by Tony O&#x27;Reilly and his family between 1973 and 2012. Thereafter Denis O&#x27;Brien was the largest shareholder in Independent News &amp; Media until April 2019.

==History==
===Early history===
The company was formed as Independent Newspapers Limited in 1904 by William Martin Murphy, as the publisher of the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;.

===The O&#x27;Reilly years===
In 1973, (Sir) Tony O&#x27;Reilly acquired 100% of the &quot;A&quot; shares of the company from the Murphy and Chance families, and was later forced to bid for the &quot;B&quot; (non-voting) shares. The company was subsequently floated on the Irish Stock Exchange and London Stock Exchange. The group expanded overseas, acquiring interests in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.

In 1999, the company name was changed to Independent News and Media plc.

O&#x27;Reilly was CEO until early 2009, one of his sons, formerly COO, Gavin O&#x27;Reilly, became CEO in early 2009, and two others were non-executive directors for many years. O&#x27;Reilly himself resigned as CEO on 19 April 2012 and was replaced by Vincent Crowley. O&#x27;Reilly had come under pressure in recent months from two of INM&#x27;s largest shareholders, billionaire Denis O&#x27;Brien and financier Dermot Desmond.

===The O&#x27;Brien and Desmond years===
In May 2012, Irish entrepreneur Denis O&#x27;Brien held a 29.9% stake in the company, making him the largest shareholder at the time. This compared to O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s family stake of around 13% (June 2012). Five per cent of the holding company was held by Clear Channel Communications, transferred in return for control of a South African outdoor advertising firm.

On 26 April 2013, INM announced it had concluded a deal with its bankers to exchange part of its debt for up to 20 percent of equity. The deal was subject to the sale of its South African newspapers, a reduction in staff levels of 10%, a capital raising, and the restructuring of the company&#x27;s pension plan.

===2019 change of ownership===
In 2019, it was reported that INM was up for sale. According to reports, suitors include Schibsted, Sanoma Media and a private equity firm.

In April 2019, it was reported that INM had accepted an ownership bid of €145.6 million from Belgian media group Mediahuis. The offer was subject to acceptance by shareholders at an EGM, competition authority approval and government approval.

In May 2019, Mediahuis increased their stake to 29.9%.

An EGM held on 26 June 2019 approved the Mediahuis offer.

==Former assets==
===Ireland===
In 1993, the group bought into the now defunct &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot;, in which it owned 98% of the issued share capital and over which it has considerable influence. As INM technically only held 29.9% of voting shares and so lacked management control, it did not consolidate the results of the &quot;Tribune&quot;, which is loss-making, with accumulated losses of around €45 million since acquisition. The &quot;Tribune&quot; went in to administration and closed in February 2011.

The group launched Independent Colleges, which has its base on Dublin&#x27;s Dawson Street, in 2007, and sold its education division in 2014.

The Irish Daily Star, formerly 50% owned by INM, was sold to Reach plc, parent of the &quot;Daily Star&quot; in the UK, in 2020.

In 2022, the Fingal Independent was closed. 

===United Kingdom===
&quot;The Independent&quot; (of London) was bought for around €100 million in 1997 and up until March 2010 the title had made cumulative losses of least €150 million. &quot;The Independent&quot; and the &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; newspapers were sold to a company controlled by Alexander Lebedev in March 2010.

During 2007, INM opened a new full-colour Goss printing press facility in Newry, County Down. The press the Goss Flexible Printing System known as the FPS was the first FPS sold by Goss Preston.

*&quot;Ireland&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot; (closed in 2008)

===South Africa===
Until 2013, the group was the second biggest newspaper publisher in South Africa, owning 14 newspapers including &quot;The Star&quot; and &quot;Pretoria News&quot; in Gauteng, the &quot;Daily Voice&quot;, &quot;Cape Times&quot;, &quot;Cape Argus&quot; and &quot;Weekend Argus&quot; in Cape Town, &quot;The Mercury&quot;, &quot;Post&quot;, &quot;Isolezwe&quot;, &quot;Daily News&quot;, &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; and &quot;Independent on Saturday&quot; in Durban, the &quot;Diamond Fields Advertiser&quot; in Kimberley, as well as the national &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; and 13 community newspapers in Cape Town. The group&#x27;s titles account for 48% of the total advertising spend in paid newspapers, 22% of all newspapers sold in the country, and 63% of the English language market.

In mid-2012, speculation began that INM would sell their South African operation. This was later confirmed. INM had initially hoped for 250 million EUR for INM SA, however bids came in at around 150 million EUR. Cape Town businessman Iqbal Surve&#x27;s Sekunjalo Investments consortium were the frontrunners to purchase INM SA. Initially Sekunjalo was set to take a 75% stake in the consortium, but this was changed to 55%, with the remainder going to two government entities. The first of these is the investment arm of the SA government, and the second, an investment arm of the Chinese government. Commenting on the deal University of the Witwatersrand journalism professor Anton Harber said that &quot;the ANC is working with their Chinese allies—ruling party to ruling party, in the way the Chinese government so often works—to increase their influence in our local media and counter what they view as a hostile media sector.&quot;

Bloomberg reported that Denis O&#x27;Brien met Jacob Zuma, president of South Africa, during a private meeting at the hotel on 24 January 2013. He also met the broker negotiating the sale of INM SA.

===Australia and New Zealand===
The company owned a stake in APN News &amp; Media Limited, a large newspaper publisher in Australia and New Zealand, which owns &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; and other newspapers, and is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.

On 12 February 2007, INM announced that the board of APN had recommended an all-cash revised offer of A$6.10 per share for the entire issued share capital of APN.
The subsequent bid to take APN News &amp; Media Ltd private in May 2007 was unsuccessful.

INL owned approximately 30% of APN at mid-2012 and sold it by March 2015.

===India===
INM previously entered into the Indian market, purchasing 20% of Dainik Jagran, the publishing company behind India&#x27;s best-selling paper. This market has been identified by INM as being a key element of its move into non-English speaking media markets with huge growth opportunities and potential for advancement. Since the initial investment INM deepened its involvement by buying 20% of the radio business of Dainik Jagran. The intention is to establish eight radio stations in the so-called &quot;Hindi Belt&quot;.

In August 2010, INM sold its entire stake in Dainik Jagran. INM no longer have any Indian interests.

===Other interests===
INM also held stakes in the Unison ISP and the iTouch electronic payments and premium rate telecoms operator, the controlling stake in the latter later being sold to a Japanese firm.

====Cable====
The company formerly held a 50% stake in Chorus Communications, the second largest cable television and MMDS operator in Ireland, having acquired this with a merger between Cable Management Ireland, and their own Irish Multichannel. However this was sold in 2004.

==The group==
The chief executive is Marc Vangeel having succeeded Michael Doorly in the role on 1 August 2019. The chairman is Murdoch MacLennan. The group website is inm..

==Controversies==
There have been questions about the policy of not consolidating the 98%-owned but loss-making &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot;, and on the other hand the practice of consolidating entirely the massively profitable APN News &amp; Media, which was less than 41%-owned. In the half-year to June 2007, for example, the group reported operating profits of €155 million—but this excluded €1.5 million of losses from the &quot;Tribune&quot;, and included €85 million from APN (whereas a proportionate share of profit would have been, at that time, €32 million).

There have also been questions about APN, which was acquired in transactions involving both the group and the O&#x27;Reilly family, and profited the latter greatly, and about the massive level of group debt (over €1.3 billion). Furthermore, there have been complaints about the level of power of the O&#x27;Reilly family, the independence or otherwise of the board, and about the costs of O&#x27;Reilly as CEO, with second-largest shareholder Denis O&#x27;Brien and others having noted travel costs from O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s primary home in the Bahamas, company payments towards his now second home in Kilcullen, near Dublin, on top of large salary and other contributions.

The groups&#x27; failure to cover the controversy surrounding INM director Brian Mulroney has also been criticised. Mulroney was the subject of an inquiry by Canadian Privy Council because of his part in a scandal involving the purchase of Airbus by Air Canada, and also his relationship to German arms dealer Karlheinz Schreiber.

The group&#x27;s relationship with a variety of entertainment and public relationships firms via Clear Channel Independent has also been seen as problematic.

Independent News and Media was identified by the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) as an employer where &quot;bullying&quot; and &quot;lack of support&quot; was rampant. The survey said 93% of the respondent claimed they didn&#x27;t receive proper support from the management and 20% of them complained of bullying at work. The survey also claimed 96% of the respondent complained that they had to work overtime and 55% of them said they were forced to do so. INM declined to comment on the survey.

<doc id="896444" wikidata="Q30526462" url="?curid=896444" title="Rodgers">
<text>Rodgers is a patronymic surname deriving from the given name of &quot;Rodger&quot; commonly used by the Normans and meaning &quot;son of Rodger&quot;. Variant form of Rogers.
The name Rodger is of Old German origin and is likely derived from the Germanic name Hrodger meaning &quot;famous spear&quot;, composed of the elements hruod &quot;fame&quot; and ger &quot;spear&quot;.

In England, the name Rodger could’ve derived from the pre-7th century Old English name Hrothgar, which means &#x27;fame spear&#x27; (&quot;hroð&quot; fame or renown, &quot;gari&quot; spear), the first reference to which is in Beowulf, the Anglo-Saxon epic poem. The name was probably first introduced into England during the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.

However, it is more likely that the name Rodger was introduced to England after the Norman Conquest of 1066. In Normandy, the name &quot;Rodger&quot; was reinforced by the Old Norse cognate Hróðgeirr and was very popular with the Norsemen. It was they who &quot;borrowed&quot; it from the Gauls they conquered, as they swept through on their long march from Scandinavia to their home in Normandy. According to a 2020 study, those with the surname are more likely to have Viking ancestors.

The Normans brought the name to England, where it replaced the name &quot;Hroðgar&quot; (Old Norse: Hróarr). The name of a legendary Danish king, living in the early 6th century mentioned in Beowulf, Widsith, and also in Norse sagas.

From the Old Norse, Hroð-geirr; from the Danish, Roedeger, Rodgers; from the Flemish, Roger; from the French, Rogier; from the German, Roger; from the Latin, Rodegerus, Rodeghiero; in the Domesday Book, Roger.

It was introduced to Ireland when the Anglo-Normans invaded in the 1170s and then later in the Cromwellian invasions. However, many occurrences of it in Ireland represent an Anglicisation of Mac Ruaidhrí and Mac Ruairí in the newer and current standard spelling.

The surname Rodgers was first found in the Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 as Adam filius Rogeri in Lincolnshire; and Robert filius Rogeri in Norfolk. Kirby&#x27;s Quest of Somerset listed Waltero Rogero in Somerset, 1 Edward III (during the first year of Edward III&#x27;s reign.) Over 100 years later, the name had evolved from the early Latin versions that held either the vowel &quot;i&quot; or &quot;o&quot; to the more recent spellings we understand today. The Yorkshire Poll Tax Rolls of 1379 listed Willelmus Rogerson and as a personal name Rogerus Smyth.

The name was &quot;rare or absent in England north of a line drawn from the River Humber to the River Mersey. Scattered over the rest of England and also Wales, but generally infrequent in the eastern counties, being by far the most numerous in the western half of its area. It is most common in Herefordshire and Shropshire, and also in Cornwall.&quot; This author continues &quot;Rodger is the Scotch form, it has no definite distribution. In England we only find it occasionally, as in the case of Rodgers in Derbyshire.&quot;

From this vantage, we explored the aforementioned &quot;Scotch&quot; (Scottish) origin further. In this case, many of the records were recorded in the Anglo-Saxon or English version rather than the previous entries that had the Latin form. &quot;Roger was appointed abbot of Dryburgh in 1152. Roger, son of Oggou, attested a deed of middle of thirteenth century. William Roger was tenant of the abbot of Coupar-Angus in 1468.&quot; Black continues &quot;Rodgers is the more common form with Scots. Rogers, in some parts of central Scotland, is pronounced Rodgie, and some Gaelic-speaking people in Perthshire pronounce it Rougie and sometimes Royger. John Rodgers, born in Maryland, 1771, son of a Scots colonel of militia, fired with his own hand the first shot in the war with Great Britain in 1812.&quot;

&quot;The family of Rogers of Home, in Shropshire, are a cadet of the Norburys of Norbury in that county. In 7. Edward II., (seventh year of Edward II&#x27;s reign) Roger de Norbury, son of Philip, and grandson of Roger de Norbury, had a grant of the estate of Home. His son took the name of Rogers, and his posterity under that appellation have ever since resided at Home.&quot;

Roger of Salisbury (died 1139), &quot;also called Roger the Great, bishop of Salisbury and justiciar, was of humble origin, and originally priest of a little chapel near Caen. The future king, Henry I, chanced, while riding out from Caen, to turn aside to this chapel to hear mass. Roger, guessing the temper of his audience, went through the service with such speed that they declared him the very man for a soldier&#x27;s chaplain, and Henry took him into his service.&quot;

<text>Muhsin Musa Matwalli Atwah () (June 19, 1964 – April 12, 2006) was an Egyptian national wanted by the United States government.

Also known as Abdul Rahman, Abu Abdul Rahman al-Muhajir, Abdel Rahman, Abu Turab, Ibrahim al-Muhajir al-Masri, and Mohammed K.A. al-Namer, he was wanted by the United States government in connection to the August 7, 1998 American embassy bombings in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya. Atwah built both of the bombs used in the attacks. For his role in the attacks, he was indicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Consequently, on October 10, 2001, Atwah was placed on the initial list of the FBI&#x27;s top 22 Most Wanted Terrorists, which was released to the public by President Bush. Atwah had been a member of al-Qaeda since at least 1990 and provided explosives training in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sudan, according to his indictment. The indictment also charged that Atwah had been part of an al Qaeda cell operating in Somalia in the early 1990s that provided training to Somali tribesmen who attacked U.S. forces in that country. By early 2006, he was suspected as a key supplier of arms to terrorists battling Pakistani forces in North and South Waziristan.

On April 12, 2006, Atwah was reported by an anonymous Pakistani Cabinet minister to have been killed along with six other militants, by Pakistani forces in a helicopter gunship raid on the village of Naghar Kalai near the Afghan border. Villagers reported that armed men removed the bodies. Atwah&#x27;s death was confirmed by US officials on October 24, 2006, following DNA testing. His profile was then removed from the FBI&#x27;s Most Wanted Terrorists website.

<doc id="896452" wikidata="Q381145" url="?curid=896452" title="Aermacchi AM.3">
<text>The Aermacchi AM.3 was the result of a joint venture between Aermacchi and Aeritalia (then Aerfer Industrie Aerospaziali Meridionali) in response to an Italian Army requirement for an aircraft to replace the Cessna L-19, and was initially designated the MB-335.

==Design and development==
The AM.3 used the wing design of the Aermacchi AL-60 utility aircraft, strengthened to incorporate two hardpoints. The fuselage was a new design.
The first prototype, constructed by Aermacchi, flew on 12 May 1967, and it was displayed at the Paris air show in June that year. The second prototype, constructed by AERFER, flew on 22 August 1968, but the aircraft lost the Italian Army contract to the SIAI Marchetti SM.1019. Nevertheless, Aeritalia continued development.

The third prototype used a more powerful Piaggio-built Lycoming GSO-480-B1B6 in place of the original Continental GTSIO-520-C, and this variant was designated AM.3C

Pilot and observer are accommodated in tandem positions, and the craft features dual controls. Aft space is utilitarian, providing space for two stretchers or seat space for additional passengers. Additional configurations include freight transport.

Armament configurations are diverse, as well. Two standard underwing pylons were able to carry 170 kg (375 lb) of stores each. Typical armament includes machine guns, rockets, bombs and missiles. Reconnaissance packs could be fitted to, or inside of, the fuselage. Additional pylons were often added by customers.

==Bosbok==

In September 1970, the South African Air Force ordered 40 AM.3Cs, designating the aircraft the AM.3CM Bosbok (Bush-buck). The first aircraft was taken on charge in March 1973, with deliveries continuing until December 1975, equipping 41 Squadron and 42 Squadron.

The Bosbok saw extensive action during the South African military operations in Angola between 1975 and 1989, during which it wore an olive-drab/dark earth camouflage instead of the light-grey paint scheme in which it was delivered.

The SAAF&#x27;s Bosboks had four underwing hardpoints from which a variety of ordnance could be hung, including machine-gun pods, light bombs, and smoke-rocket pods. Each of the two inner hardpoints was stressed for a 170 kg (375 lb) load, with the two outer points being stressed for a 91 kg (200 lb) load.

Roles performed by the Bosbok in SAAF service include:
* Forward air control
* Radio relay (referred to as &quot;Telstar duty&quot; by the SAAF)
* Target marking (using smoke-rockets)
* Reconnaissance/observation (including artillery spotting)
* Casevac
* Liaison

The Bosbok really excelled in the dangerous role of target-marking, in which it used this technique - the aircraft would approach the target at tree-top height, pull up to around 92 m (300 ft) when nearly overhead the target, line up the nose on the target, and release the rockets, before quickly turning away and diving back to tree-top level to avoid ground fire.

Using this method, a Bosbok was once credited with destroying an entire 37 mm anti-aircraft gun position with a lucky direct hit from one of its smoke marker rockets.

Following the end of South Africa&#x27;s involvement in the Angolan War in 1989 and the subsequent downsizing of the SAAF, the Bosbok was retired from service in 1992.

==Operators==

* Rwandan Air Force (3)
*South African Air Force (40)
**41 Squadron SAAF
**42 Squadron SAAF
*National Test Pilot School (1)

<doc id="896455" wikidata="Q13591602" url="?curid=896455" title="Washingtonian movement">
<text>The Washingtonian movement (Washingtonians, Washingtonian Temperance Society or Washingtonian Total Abstinence Society) was a 19th-century temperance fellowship founded on Thursday, April 2, 1840, by six alcoholics (William K. Mitchell, John F. Hoss, David Anderson, George Steers, James McCurley, and Archibald Campbell) at Chase&#x27;s Tavern on Liberty Street in Baltimore, Maryland. 

The idea was that by relying on each other, sharing their alcoholic experiences, and creating an atmosphere of conviviality, they could keep each other sober. Total abstinence from alcohol (teetotalism) was their goal. The group taught sobriety and preceded Alcoholics Anonymous by almost a century. Members sought out other &quot;drunkards&quot; (the term alcoholic had not yet been created), told them their experiences with excessive alcohol use, and how the Society had helped them achieve sobriety. With the passage of time the Society became a prohibitionist organization in that it promoted the legal and mandatory prohibition of alcoholic beverages. The Society was the inspiration for Timothy Shay Arthur&#x27;s &quot;Six Nights with the Washingtonians&quot; and his &quot;Ten Nights in a Bar-Room&quot;.

The Washingtonians differed from other organizations in the temperance movement in that they focused on the individual alcoholic rather than on society&#x27;s greater relationship with liquor. In the mid-19th century, a temperance movement was in full sway across the United States and temperance workers advanced their anti-alcohol views on every front. Public temperance meetings were frequent and the main thread was prohibition of alcohol and pledges of sobriety to be made by the individual.
Concurrent with this movement, a loose network of facilities both public and private offered treatment to drunkards. Referred to as inebriate asylums and reformatory homes, they included the New York State Inebriate Asylum, The Inebriate Home of Long Island, N.Y., the Home for Incurables in San Francisco, the Franklin Reformatory Home in Philadelphia and the Washingtonian Homes which opened in Boston and Chicago in 1857.

Washingtonians at their peak numbered in the tens of thousands, possibly as high as 600,000. However, in the space of just a few years, this society almost disappeared because they became fragmented in their primary purpose, becoming involved with all manner of controversial social reforms including prohibition, sectarian religion, politics and abolition of slavery. It is believed that Abraham Lincoln attended and spoke at one of the great revivals, presumably not for treatment, but out of interest in various issues being discussed.

As the Washingtonians drifted away from their initial purpose in helping the individual alcoholic; disagreements, infighting, and controversies over Prohibition in the United States eventually destroyed the group. The Washingtonians became so thoroughly extinct that by 1935, when William Griffith Wilson (&quot;Bill&quot;) and Dr. Robert Smith (&quot;Dr. Bob&quot;) joined together in forming Alcoholics Anonymous, neither of them had ever heard of the Washingtonians . Although comparisons are made between the Washingtonians and Alcoholics Anonymous, they also have much in common with modern secular drug addiction recovery groups. The Washingtonians were accused by contemporary religious critics of humanism heresy, or &quot;placing their own power above the power of God&quot;
