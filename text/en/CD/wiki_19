<text>The Vanguard rocket was intended to be the first launch vehicle the United States would use to place a satellite into orbit. Instead, the Sputnik crisis caused by the surprise launch of Sputnik 1 led the U.S., after the failure of Vanguard TV-3, to quickly orbit the Explorer 1 satellite using a Juno I rocket, making Vanguard 1 the second successful U.S. orbital launch.

Vanguard rockets were used by Project Vanguard from 1957 to 1959. Of the eleven Vanguard rockets which the project attempted to launch, three successfully placed satellites into orbit. Vanguard rockets were an important part of the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union.

==Overview==
In 1955, the United States announced plans to put a scientific satellite in orbit for the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957–1958. The goal was to track the satellite as it performed experiments. At that time, there were three candidates for the launch vehicle: The Air Force&#x27;s SM-65 Atlas, a derivative of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency&#x27;s SSM-A-14 Redstone, and a Navy proposal for a three-stage rocket based on the RTV-N-12a Viking sounding rocket.

The RAND Corporation, Air Force and CIA had long pursued the idea of a reconnaissance satellite. Such a program was under way, Weapon System 117L, which was top secret compartmented. One problem with reconnaissance was the question of legality: Was there &quot;freedom of space&quot; or did a nation&#x27;s airspace end when space is entered? The National Security Council backed the IGY satellite because it would make good cover for WS117L and set a precedent of freedom of space peaceful civilian satellite. At the same time the NSC stressed that the IGY satellite must not interfere with military programs. The Army&#x27;s Redstone-based proposal would likely be the first one ready for a satellite launch. Its connection with German-born scientist Wernher von Braun, however, was a public-relations risk. In any case, the Atlas and Redstone ballistic missiles were top-priority military projects, which were not to be hindered by pursuing a secondary space launch mission. Milton Rosen&#x27;s Vanguard was a project at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), which was regarded more as a scientific than a military organization. Rosen and Richard Porter (IGY satellite chief and head of the American Rocket Society) both lobbied for the Vanguard and against using the Atlas or von Braun&#x27;s rockets. They emphasized the non-military goals of the satellite program. Besides the public-relations aspect, a non-military satellite was considered important, because a discussion of whether overflights of foreign countries by satellites were legal or illegal was to be avoided.

In August or September 1955, the DOD Committee on Special Capabilities chose the NRL proposal, named Vanguard, for the IGY project. The Martin company, which had also built the Viking, became prime contractor for the launch vehicle. The Vanguard rocket was designed as a three-stage vehicle. The first stage was a General Electric X-405 liquid-fueled engine (designated XLR50-GE-2 by the Navy), derived from the engine of the RTV-N-12a Viking. The second stage was the Aerojet General AJ10-37 (XLR52-AJ-2) liquid-fueled engine, a variant of the engine in the RTV-N-10 Aerobee. Finally, the third stage was a solid-propellant rocket motor. All three-stage Vanguard flights except the last one used a motor built by the Grand Central Rocket Company. Vanguard had no fins, and the first and second stages were steered by gimbaled engines. The second stage housed the vehicle&#x27;s telemetry system, the inertial guidance system and the autopilot. The third stage was spin-stabilized, with the spin imparted by a turntable on the second stage before separation.

The Vanguard&#x27;s second stage served for decades as the Able and Delta second stage for satellite launch vehicles. The AJ10 engine which made up those stages was adapted into the AJ10-137, which was used as the Apollo Service Module engine. The AJ10-190, adapted from the Apollo spacecraft was used on the Space Shuttle for orbital maneuvers. The AJ10-160 is to be repurposed for use on NASA&#x27;s upcoming Orion spacecraft.

==Launch summary==
The first two flights of the Vanguard program, designated Vanguard TV-0 and Vanguard TV-1, were actually the last two remaining RTV-N-12a Viking rockets modified. Vanguard TV-0, launched on 8 December 1956, primarily tested new telemetry systems, while Vanguard TV-1 on 1 May 1957, was a two-stage vehicle testing separation and ignition of the solid-fueled upper stage of Vanguard. Vanguard TV-2, launched on 23 October 1957, after several abortive attempts, was the first real Vanguard rocket. The second and third stages were inert, but the flight successfully tested first/second-stage separation and spin-up of the third stage. However, by that time, the Soviet Union had already placed the Sputnik 1 satellite into orbit, and so project Vanguard was more or less forced to launch its own satellite as soon as possible. Therefore, a very small experimental satellite (derisively called the &quot;grapefruit&quot; by Nikita Khrushchev, and weighing only ) was added to Vanguard TV-3, which was to be the first test of an all-up Vanguard rocket. Although the NRL and Glenn L. Martin Company tried to emphasize that the Vanguard TV-3 mission was a pure test flight (and one with several &quot;firsts&quot;), everyone else saw it as the first satellite launch of the Western world, billed as &quot;America&#x27;s answer to Sputnik&quot;. Wernher von Braun angrily said about the Sputnik launch: &quot;We knew they were going to do it. Vanguard will never make it. We have the hardware on the shelf. We can put up a satellite in 60 days&quot;.

On 6 December 1957, the US Navy launched Vanguard TV-3 rocket, carrying a satellite, from Cape Canaveral. It only reached an altitude of before it fell and exploded. The satellite was exploded from the top of the rocket, landed in bushes near the pad, and began transmitting signals, leading &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; columnist Dorothy Kilgallen to remark &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t somebody go out there, find it, and shoot it?&quot; The American press called it &quot;Kaputnik&quot;.

Investigation into the accident concluded that inadequate fuel tank pressure had allowed hot exhaust gases to back up into the injector head and destroy it, causing complete loss of engine thrust. After the failure of Vanguard TV-3, the backup vehicle, Vanguard TV-3BU (&quot;BU&quot; for backup), was prepared for another attempt. Pad crews hastened to repair the damage done to LC-18A by Vanguard TV-3&#x27;s explosion, and in the third week of January 1958, the job was completed. Vanguard TV-3BU was erected on the pad, but continuous delays frustrated the launch attempt. Heavy rains shorted some electrical cables on the ground and necessitated their replacement. The second stage had also been sitting on the pad with a full load of nitric acid for several weeks, which eventually corroded the fuel tank and valves. It had to be removed and replaced by a different stage. Finally, the launch got under way on the night of 5 February 1958. The Vanguard lifted smoothly into the sky and performed well until 57 seconds into launch, when the booster pitched over almost 40°. The skinny second stage broke in half from aerodynamic stress four seconds later, causing the Vanguard to tumble end-over-end before range safety officer sent the destruct command. Cause of the failure was attributed to a spurious guidance signal that caused the first stage to perform unintended pitch maneuvers. The guidance system was modified to have greater redundancy, and efforts were made to improve quality control. On 17 March 1958, Vanguard TV-4 finally succeeded in orbiting the Vanguard 1 satellite. By that time, however, the Army&#x27;s Juno (Jupiter-C) had already launched the United States&#x27; first satellite, Explorer 1. The Vanguard TV-4 rocket had put the satellite Vanguard 1, to a relatively high orbit of (). Vanguard 1 and its third stage remain in orbit as the oldest man-made artifacts in space. The following four flights, TV-5 and SLV (Satellite Launch Vehicle) Vanguard SLV-1, Vanguard SLV-2 and Vanguard SLV-3 all failed, but on 17 February 1959, Vanguard SLV-4 launched Vanguard 2, weighing , into orbit. The SLVs were the &quot;production&quot; Vanguard rockets. Vanguard SLV-5 and Vanguard SLV-6 also failed, but the final flight on 18 September 1959, successfully orbited the Vanguard 3 satellite. That last mission was designated Vanguard TV-4BU, because it used a remaining test vehicle, which had been upgraded with a new third stage, the Allegany Ballistics Laboratory X-248A2 Altair. This more powerful motor enabled the launch of the heavier payload. The combination of the AJ10 liquid engine and X-248 solid motor was also used, under the name Able, as an upper stage combination for Thor and Atlas space launch vehicles.

<doc id="878817" wikidata="Q820410" url="?curid=878817" title="Hill tribe (Thailand)">
<text>Hill tribe (, ; Northern Thai: จาวดอย, คนดอย, ; &#x27;mountain people/folk&#x27;) is a term used in Thailand for all of the various ethnic groups who mostly inhabit the high mountainous northern and western regions of Thailand, including both sides of the border areas between northern Thailand, Laos and Burma, the Phi Pan Nam Range, the Thanon Range, the latter a southern prolongation of the Shan Hills, as well as the Tenasserim Hills in Western Thailand. These areas exhibit mountainous terrain which is in some areas covered by thick forests, while in others it has been heavily affected by deforestation.

In 1959, the government of Thailand established the Hill Tribe Welfare Committee under the Ministry of the Interior; nine ethnic groups (Akha, Hmong, Htin, Iu-Mien, Karen, Khamu, Lahu, Lisu and Lua) were officially recognized as &quot;Chao Khao&quot; or “Hill Tribes” at that time. By 2004, these groups and other ethnic minorities like Kachin, Dara’ang, Mlabri and Shan came to be called &quot;Klum chatiphan Chao khao&quot; or “Ethnic Hill tribes”.

The hill dwelling peoples have traditionally been primarily subsistence farmers who use slash-and-burn agricultural techniques to farm their heavily forested communities. Popular perceptions that slash and burn practices are environmentally destructive, governmental concerns over borderland security, and population pressure has caused the government to forcibly relocate many hill tribe peoples. Traditionally, hill tribes were a migratory people, leaving land as it became depleted of resources. Cultural and adventure travel tourism resulting in visiting the tribal villages is an increasing source of income for the hill tribes.

The mountain peoples are severely disadvantaged by comparison with the dominant Thai ethnic group. A 2013 article in the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; said that &quot;Nearly a million hill peoples and forest dwellers are still treated as outsiders—criminals even, since most live in protected forests. Viewed as national security threats, hundreds of thousands of them are refused citizenship although many are natives to the land&quot;. The Ministry of Social Development and Human Security&#x27;s 2015 &quot;Master Plan for the Development of Ethnic Groups in Thailand 2015-2017&quot; listed 13 mountain peoples and recognized problems in five areas, namely a lack of rights and uncertainty in housing, a lack of rights in legal status, a lack of stability in life, and weaknesses in bureaucratic planning. It sought to provide a planning framework to address these issues. The &quot;Master Plan&quot; was not renewed after 2017; it was &#x27;subsumed&#x27; into planning by the Office of the National Security Council and by the Ministry of Culture.

==The term &quot;hill tribe&quot;==
In the 19th century, the tribes living in the mountain ranges were the largest non-Buddhist group in Thailand. Their mountain locations were then considered remote and difficult to access. In Thai official documents, the term &quot;hill tribe&quot; (&quot;chao khao&quot;) began to appear in the 1960s. This term highlights a &quot;hill and valley&quot; dichotomy that is based on ancient social relationships existing in most of northern and western Thailand, as well as in Sipsongpanna and Northern Vietnam. For the most part, the Dai/Tai/Thai people occupied the more fertile intermontane basins and the valleys, while the less powerful groups lived in the poorer, higher elevations. This dichotomy was often also characterized by a master/serf relationship.

&quot;Highland Thais&quot; is a more recent term also used to designate groups living in the mountainous areas.

==Main groups==


The seven major hill tribes in Thailand are the Akha, Lahu, Karen, Hmong/Miao, Mien/Yao, Lisu, and Palaung, each having a distinct language and culture.

===Akha===

The Akha are closely related to the Hani of China&#x27;s Yunnan province. They are also known derogatorily in Thai as the &quot;Gaw&quot; or the &quot;E-gaw&quot;. The Akha are one of the dominant cultural influences in the area. There are two to three million Akha and Akha-Hani in total, 70,000 of whom live in Thailand. The Akha speak a language in the Lolo/Yi branch of the Tibeto-Burman language group but have no traditional written language.

Although many Akha, especially the younger people, profess Christianity, &quot;Akha Zang&quot; (&#x27;The Akha Way&#x27;) still runs deep in their consciousness. The Akha are a shamanic group that share the ancient universal archetype that the Goddess spins a universe where nature is not distinguished from humankind. They embody the essence of its consciousness into a holistic continuum where there is no dichotomy between themselves and the natural world. The Akha Way, a prescribed lifestyle derived from religious chants, combines animism, ancestor worship, shamanism and a deep relationship with the land. The Akha Way emphasizes rituals in everyday life and stresses strong family ties and the hymn of creation; every Akha male can recount his genealogy back over fifty generations to the first Akha, Sm Mi O.

===Lahu===
===The Hmong===
===Yao===

The Yao are composed of several different groups and they speak different languages which are used to differentiate them. The &quot;Iu Mien&quot; make up 70% of the Yao population.

The Yao were said to be the first civilization in China according to the chanting song story, Iu Mien Elders, a shaman&#x27;s worship book written by Iu Mien elders in ancient Chinese characters. The Iu Mien nation was located in the southern part of China today known as Guangdong, Guangxi and Hunan provinces and was ruled by the king of the Iu Mien people. The last Iu Mien king was King Pan, the namesake of the modern Iu Mien surnames: Phan, Saephanh, Saephan, Phanh, Pharn, Pan, Pham. King Pan and the Chinese emperor declared war against each other 800 years ago over disputed territory. The Iu Mien, led by King Pan, were fighting to protect their people and their territory. King Pan and the Iu Mien were decimated. King Pan lost countless soldiers and civilian casualties as well as territory to the Chinese emperor. The Chinese emperor captured most of the Iu Mien&#x27;s territory. Iu Mien and King Pan were left unable to resist, which forced King Pan to negotiate with the Chinese emperor. The Chinese emperor gave two options to King Pan and Iu Mien people: Surrender to the Chinese emperor and sign a treaty to give all territory to the Chinese emperor, or continue to fight until the Chinese wiped out Iu Mien society utterly.

King Pan and his government chose to give up all territories to China and signed the treaty &quot;Passport to travel in the hill&quot; or &quot;Passport to cross the mountain&quot;. The document contained relevant information and had been written by the Chinese emperor in Chinese characters.

&quot;Iu Mien people have rights to maintain their identity, language, culture, and worship system and live on the hill side or in the mountain to cultivate land for farming and crops and raise their family. The Iu Mien would not be allowed to form their own government and have no rights to pursue their own nation. Iu Mien who possess this document have the legal right to cross all territories and borders to settle and to build their village in the hill/mountain to make a living by farming without hindrance by government. The governments of that country are responsible for their well-being and educating them to follow the rules of laws of the country that Iu Mien are living in.&quot;

After the loss of their nation, the 12 existing clans of Iu Mien people had to separate into small villages due to the mountainous area and foot hill land. Each village consisted of 15 to 20 families. The majority of people in each village were related. In some cases, they kept their clan together. They practiced slash-and-burn agriculture. Hunting and fishing were their primary means of acquiring food. Iu Mien women minded the household chores and children. Iu Mien&#x27;s written language is similar to Chinese characters which is for religious and chant only songs. There was no written language for daily speaking. When their soil was exhausted, they moved to a new place in the tropical forest to start a new life and a new village all over again. Iu Mien people were scattered all over the mountains in China. The mountains where they lived became deserts because of the slash and burn farming. They sought new places in mountainous areas. They searched further south and eventually moved into Vietnam.

===Karen===

The K’nyaw (), known to many as Karen and to others as Kariang or Yang, are one of the largest hill tribes in Southeast Asia. The total number of Karen people is unknown as they are spread throughout Burma, Laos, and Thailand, and no reliable census has been conducted in Burma since the 1930s. Population estimates range from 7.5 million to 14 million people. The more conservative estimate would make their population equivalent to that of Switzerland. The approximately 320,000 Karen in Thailand comprise half of the country&#x27;s total hill tribe population.

While the Karen still practice slash-and-burn agriculture like other hill tribes, they differ in that they live in permanent villages at lower elevations and have been aggressive in developing environmentally-sustainable terraced rice fields. Those factors have allowed the Karen to better integrate themselves into Thai society.

<doc id="878832" wikidata="Q732356" url="?curid=878832" title="Erik Weihenmayer">
<text>Erik Weihenmayer (born September 23, 1968) is an American athlete, adventurer, author, activist and motivational speaker. He was the first blind person to reach the summit of Mount Everest, on May 25, 2001. Due to this accomplishment he was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. He completed the Seven Summits in September 2002, one of only 150 mountaineers at the time to do so, but the only climber to achieve this while blind. In 2008, he also added the Carstensz Pyramid thus completing the Eight Summits. Weihenmayer has also made noteworthy climbs up the Nose of El Capitan in Yosemite in 1996, and ascended Losar, a vertical ice face in the Himalayas in 2008.

In 2005, he co-founded No Barriers, a nonprofit organization that helps people of diverse backgrounds and abilities to attack challenges head on, problem solve, build winning teams, and serve others. In September 2014, Weihenmayer and blinded Navy veteran Lonnie Bedwell kayaked the entire of the Grand Canyon, considered one of the most formidable whitewater locations in the world. Today, while still adventuring, he is a prominent worldwide speaker, focusing on the topic of living a &quot;No Barriers Life.&quot;

== Early life and education ==
Weihenmayer was born September 23, 1968, in Princeton, New Jersey. At 15 months old, he was diagnosed with juvenile retinoschisis, with blindness the expected outcome by age 13. At age 4, Weihenmayer and his family moved to Coral Gables, Florida, and, in 1975, to Hong Kong, where Weihenmayer attended the Hong Kong International School for grades 2–6. As he was going blind, Weihenmayer fought against using canes and learning Braille. He wanted to hang on to his life in the sighted world. Upon returning to America, Weihenmayer and his family settled in Connecticut, where he attended Weston High School. He eventually turned to wrestling and became a prominent force in high school, captaining his team and representing Connecticut in the National Junior Freestyle Wrestling Championship in Iowa.

At age 16, he started using a guide dog. He tried rock climbing, and found he was a natural at scrambling up a face using his hands and feet to find holds. Then he attended Boston College and graduated with a double major in English and communications. He did his student-teaching at Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols School in Massachusetts, became a middle-school teacher at Phoenix Country Day School, where he met his fellow teacher and future wife, Ellie Reeves. He also coached wrestling in Phoenix.

Weihenmayer has been granted honorary degrees from Lehigh University, Lafayette College, Babson College, Colorado Mountain College, the University of Vermont and Lesley University.

== Adventure career ==

=== Seven Summits ===
Weihenmayer&#x27;s first big mountain was Denali, in 1995, and in 2004, with Jeff Evans, Sabriye Tenberken and six blind Tibetan teenagers, he climbed on the north side of Everest to 21,500 feet, higher than any group of blind people have ever stood. A documentary based on the project, &quot;Blindsight&quot;, was released in 2006.

On May 25, 2001, Weihenmayer became the first blind person to reach the summit of Mount Everest. For this feat, he was honored with a &quot;Time Magazine&quot; cover story. Of his Everest ascent, &quot;Time&quot; stated, &quot;There is no way to put what Erik has done in perspective because no one has ever done anything like it. It is a unique achievement, one that in the truest sense pushes the limits of what man is capable of.&quot;

He completed the Seven Summits in September 2002, joining 150 mountaineers at the time who had accomplished that feat, but as the only blind climber. In 2008, he also added Carstensz Pyramid in Indonesia, the tallest peak in Australasia, thus completing the more respected Eight Summits.

=== Climbing ===
Weihenmayer has climbed rock and ice faces around the world. These include the first blind ascent of the 3,000-foot Nose of El Capitan in Yosemite, a difficult alpine climb of spectacular Alpamayo in Peru, and an ascent of a rarely-climbed 700-meter frozen waterfall in Nepal.

=== Kayaking ===
In September 2014, Weihenmayer and blinded Navy veteran, Lonnie Bedwell, kayaked the entire 277-miles of the Grand Canyon.

=== Other adventures ===
In 2006, Weihenmayer created the Adventure Team Challenge, a first-of-its-kind adventure race in which teams of disabled and non-disabled athletes compete; his team won five years in a row. In 2010, he completed the Leadville 100 mountain bike race, with elevations all above 10,000 feet, on a tandem, once again becoming the first blind person to complete a world-class competition. And in 2011, Weihenmayer&#x27;s Team No Limits raced across the deserts and mountains of Morocco for a month, finishing in second place on the ABC reality show &quot;Expedition Impossible&quot;.

He has also completed the Primal Quest, an adventure race over 460 miles with 60,000 feet of elevation gain.

== Books ==
In addition to being an adventurer and speaker, Weihenmayer is also the author of the book, &quot;Touch the Top of the World: A Blind Man&#x27;s Journey to Climb Farther Than the Eye can See&quot;, which has been published in twelve countries and nine languages. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described Weihenmayer&#x27;s memoir as &quot;moving and adventure packed, Weihenmayer tells his extraordinary story with humor, honesty and vivid detail, and his fortitude and enthusiasm are deeply inspiring.&quot; The book was made into an A&amp;E movie and released on DVD by Sony.

Weihenmayer&#x27;s second book, &quot;The Adversity Advantage: Turning Everyday Struggles Into Everyday Greatness,&quot; shares hard-earned lessons and practical advice for using adversity as fuel for growth and innovation. Stephen Covey, author of &quot;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&quot;, stated, &quot;This book led me to look carefully at myself with an awareness of how the challenges of my life can be the fuel that will enable me to swim against the stream, against cultural currents, against all forms of adversity inherent in my most important goals.&quot;

Weihenmayer&#x27;s latest release, &quot;No Barriers: A Blind Man&#x27;s Journey to Kayak the Grand Canyon&quot;, was published in 2017. The book is Weihenmayer&#x27;s second memoir, and chronicles his descent of the Grand Canyon aimed to encourage those who have encountered obstacles to their goals. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, a leading literary trade magazine, wrote: &quot;Weihenmayer presents an exhilarating adventure story of arduous mountain climbing and whitewater kayaking, but he also offers broader life lessons. A wonderful tribute to the greatness of the human spirit.&quot;

== Media and film appearances ==

Weihenmayer&#x27;s adventures have earned him dozens of awards, recognitions, and TV interviews. He&#x27;s received the ESPY, Nike&#x27;s Casey Martin award, and the Helen Keller Lifetime Achievement award. He&#x27;s appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot; and &quot;Nightly News&quot;, &quot;Oprah&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;,welcome to earth,&quot;Nightline&quot;, and the &quot;Tonight Show&quot;. He was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Outside&quot;, and &quot;Climbing&quot; magazines. Weihenmayer has also carried torches for both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games.

&quot;Farther Than the Eye Can See&quot;, the documentary of his Everest ascent, is ranked by &quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot; as one of the top 20 adventure films of all time. The film won first prize at 21 international film festivals and was nominated for two Emmy awards. In 2004, Weihenmayer and six Everest team members trained a group of blind Tibetan students and then lead them to 22,000 feet on the north side of Everest. &quot;Blindsight&quot;, the documentary of the ascent, won People&#x27;s Choice Awards at the Los Angeles, London, and Berlin Film Festivals, and was released in theaters in 2007 to major accolades from film critics.

Weihenmayer was featured in the 2012 award-winning film, &quot;High Ground&quot;. This film documents a team of injured veterans; led by Weihenmayer and his Everest team, as they embark on a Himalayan climbing expedition, and along the trail, struggle to heal mentally and spiritually from the devastating wounds of war.

In 2017, Weihenmayer was named one of &quot;The 25 Most Adventurous Men of the Past 25 Years&quot; by &quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot;.

In 2023, Weihenmayer was featured in the movie &quot;Life is Climbing&quot; about blind climber Koichiro Kobayashi.

<text>The Kumeyaay, also known as &#x27;Iipai-Tiipai or by the historical Spanish name Diegueño, is a tribe of Indigenous peoples of the Americas who live at the northern border of Baja California in Mexico and the southern border of California in the United States. They are an indigenous people of California. 

The Kumeyaay language belongs to the Yuman–Cochimí language family. The Kumeyaay consist of three related groups, the [[Ipai language|&#x27;Iipai]], [[Tiipai language|Tiipai]], and Kamia. The San Diego River loosely divided the &#x27;Iipay and the Tiipai historical homelands, while the Kamia lived in the eastern desert areas. The &#x27;Iipai lived to the north, from Escondido to Lake Henshaw, while the Tiipai lived to the south, in lands including the Laguna Mountains, Ensenada, and Tecate. The Kamia lived to the east in an area that included Mexicali and bordered the Salton Sea.

==Name==

The Kumeyaay or &#x27;Iipai-Tiipai were formerly known as the Diegueños, the former Spanish name applied to the Mission Indians living along the San Diego River. They are referred to as Kumiai in Mexico.

The term &quot;Kumeyaay&quot; translates as &quot;People of the west&quot;, with the word &quot;meyaay&quot; meaning &quot;steep&quot; or &quot;cliff&quot;.

==Language==
All languages and dialects spoken by the Kumeyaay belong to the Delta–California branch of the Yuman language family, to which several other linguistically distinct, but related, groups also belong (including the Cocopa, Quechan, Paipai, and Kiliwa). Native speakers contend that, within their territory, all Kumeyaay (&#x27;Iipay/Tiipay) can understand and speak to each other, if even after a brief familiarization.

Nomenclature and tribal distinctions are not widely agreed upon. According to Margaret Langdon, who is credited with doing much of the early work on documenting the language, the general scholarly consensus recognized three separate languages: 

* &#x27;Iipai (Northern Digueño)
* Kumeyaay proper (Kamia)
* Tiipay (Southern Digueño) in northern Baja California

Katherine Luomala considered that the wide range of dialect variations reflected only two distinct languages, &#x27;Iipai and Tiipai, a view mostly supported by other researchers.

==History==
=== Pre-European contact ===
Evidence of the settlement in what is today considered Kumeyaay territory may go back twelve millennia. Circa 7000 B.C. marked the emergence of two cultural traditions: the California Coast and Valley tradition and the Desert tradition. The Kumeyaay had land along the Pacific Ocean from present Oceanside, California, in the north to south of Ensenada, Mexico, and extending east to the Colorado River. The Cuyamaca complex, a late Holocene complex in San Diego County is related to the Kumeyaay peoples. The Kumeyaay tribe also used to inhabit what is now a popular state park, known as Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve.

One view holds that historic &#x27;Iipai-Tiipai emerged around one millennium ago, though a &quot;proto-&#x27;Iipai-Tiipai culture&quot; had been established by about 5000 B.C. Katherine Luomola suggests that the &quot;nucleus of later Tipai-Ipai groups&quot; came together around A.D. 1000. The Kumeyaay themselves traditionally hold that they have lived in San Diego since 10,000 B.C. At the time of European contact, Kumeyaay comprised several autonomous bands with thirty patrilineal clans.

=== Spanish exploration and colonization ===
The first European to visit the region was Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo in 1542. He had initially met with the Kumeyaay, but this did not lead to any colonial settlement. Sebastián Vizcaíno also visited in 1602 and met with a band of Kumeyaay during the feast of &quot;San Diego de Alcalá&quot;, thus giving the region of San Diego its name; however, this also did not lead to colonial settlement.
==== Missionization period ====
In 1769, the Portolá expedition anchored in San Diego Bay and, once on land, traveled to the Kumeyaay village of Cosoy (Kosa&#x27;aay) to recover and resupply. After their recovery, the Spanish established a presidio over the village and the Misión San Diego de Alcalá, incorporating the village into the settlement of San Diego. In 1769, under the Spanish Mission system, bands living near Misión San Diego de Alcalá (overlooking the San Diego River, in present-day Mission Valley), were called Diegueños; later bands, living near Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, were called the Luiseño. The Spaniards brought with them new, non-native, invasive flora and domestic animals, which brought about some level of degradation to local ecology. This included grazing and foraging livestock animals such as pigs, goats, sheep, cattle, horses, donkeys, and various birds, like chickens, pheasants and ducks; the latter dirtying local water sources considerably.

After years of sexual assaults from the Spanish soldiers in the Presidio, and physical torture of Mission Indians using metal-tipped whips (by Mission staff), the Tiipay-Kumeyaay villages led a revolt against the Spanish, burning down Mission San Diego and killing Father Luis Jayme along with two others. Missionaries and church leaders “apologized” and forgave the Kumeyaay, rebuilding their mission closer to the Kumeyaay village of Nipaquay or &quot;Nipawai&quot;. Ultimately, the Spanish solidified their control over the area until the end of the mission era.

==== Colorado River conflict ====
In the east, the Kamia-Kumeyaay were engaged in an armed regional conflict in the Colorado River region against a coalition of Yuman speaking tribes east of the Colorado River and the Cahuilla led by the Maricopa. The Kumeyaay aligned with Quechan-led coalition, along with the Mohave, Yavapai, Chemehuevi, and other smaller groups on the Colorado River. The Spanish mediated peace talks between the two warring factions in the mid-1770s, largely siding with the Quechan-aligned alliance. However, increased tensions between the Spanish and the Quechan led to resumed conflict in 1781, but with the Spanish being denied overland access to Alta California and siding with the Maricopa-aligned coalition. The Spanish would then refocus their attention westwards to secure their maritime access to Alta California on &#x27;Iipay-Tiipay-Kumeyaay lands.

===Early Mexican rancho era===

====First Mexican Empire and First Mexican Republic period====
The Mexican Empire assumed ownership of Kumeyaay lands after defeating Spain in the Mexican War of Independence in 1821. The following year, Mexican troops confiscated all coastal lands from the Kumeyaay in 1822, granting much of the land to Mexican settlers, who became known as Californios, to develop the land for agriculture, beginning the California rancho era.

Kumeyaay fell victim to smallpox and malaria epidemics in 1827 and 1832, reducing their population.

Various disputes culminated to a skirmish between the Kumeyaay and Mexican soldiers stationed in San Diego in 1826, killing 26 Kumeyaay. This provoked Lt. Juan M. Ibarra to lead several attacks on Kumeyaay-controlled lands, and killed 28 people in his attack on Santa Ysabel on April 5th of that year. In retaliation, the Kamia-Kumeyaay attacked Fort Romualdo Pacheco on April 26th with the support of the Quechan, resulting in three dead Mexican soldiers and a fort that would never return to service.

After decades of debates and delays, the missions in Alta California were secularized in 1833, and Ipai and Tipais lost their lands; band members had to choose between becoming serfs, trespassers, rebels, or fugitives. This increased tensions between the Kumeyaay and the Mexican settlers as the economic instability threatened the security of Mexican and American merchants transiting through the area.

====Centralist Republic of Mexico period====
Under territorial governor José Figueroa, some of the Kumeyaay from Mission San Diego were allowed to resettle and establish San Pasqual pueblo in 1835, who would later become the San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians. The Kumeyaay pueblo fought against hostile bands and protected Mexican settlers, with a decisive victory over an anti-Christian uprising and capturing its leader, Claudio.

With conditions worsening, the Kumeyaay led an attack on Rancho Tecate in 1836, forcing the alcalde of San Diego to send an expedition to suppress the Kumeyaay, but returned unsuccessfully. Because of the failed venture, Mexico failed to adequately suppress talk of Californian secession from American settlers in northern Alta California.

Further Kumeyaay raids on El Cajon (1836) and Rancho Jamul (1837) threatened the security of San Diego, as many residents of San Diego fled the city. The Kumeyaay were able to attack San Diego in the late 1830s. Kumeyaay advancements into Rancho Bernardo in the north and San Ysidro and Tijuana to the south at the end of the decade threatened to cut off San Diego from the rest of the Centralist Republic of Mexico. The Kumeyaay made preparations to lay siege on San Diego in the early 1840s and launched a second attack on San Diego in June 1842. However, San Diego managed to defend itself once more. While the siege failed, the Kumeyaay managed to control much of the south, east, and most of the north of the settlement, with the town becoming dependent on sea access maintain connections to the rest of Mexico. Together with Quechan resistance in the east, the Kumeyaay cut off Alta California of all land routes to the rest of the Mexican republic between the Colorado River and the Pacific Ocean up until the Mexican–American War, further threatening Mexican control of the southern Alta California coast. The Kumeyaay prevented Mexican usage of the ranchos around San Diego and evicted most of the Californios in the area by 1844, and continued launching raids deep into the Mexican controlled coast up until the start of the Mexican–American War. The Mexican settlers became refugees on Point Loma as they waited for ships, hoping to evacuate from San Diego as Kumeyaay victories challenged their ability to hold the pueblo.

====Mexican-American War====
During the Mexican–American War, the Kumeyaay were initially neutral. The Kumeyaay of the San Pasqual pueblo were evacuated as the Americans approached the town. The Mexicans and the Californios were victorious over the Americans at the Battle of San Pasqual. A Kumeyaay leader, Panto, called on the Mexicans to cease hostilities with the Americans so that the Kumeyaay could tend to the wounded Americans, to which provided Panto and the San Pasqual Kumeyaay resupplied the Americans and helped ensure the American capture of the Pueblo de Los Ángeles and San Diego.

===Late modern era===
After the Mexican–American War, Kumeyaay lands were split between the U.S. and Mexico through the Mexican Cession resulting from the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

====Yuma War and California genocide====

In 1851, San Diego County unilaterally charged property taxes on Native American tribes in the county and threatened to confiscate land and property should they fail to pay up. This led to the San Diego Tax Rebellion of 1851 or &quot;Garra&#x27;s Revolt&quot;, with the destruction of Warner&#x27;s Ranch led by the Cupeño, opening up a new western front of the Yuma War. The Kumeyaay agreed to join the revolt alongside Cahuilla, Cocopah, and Quechan warriors, but made no military commitments to attack San Diego or capture Fort Yuma.

However, not all Kumeyaay bands fought on the same side of the Yuma war; the San Pasqual Band of Kumeyaay fought against the Quechan campaign to attack San Diego and defeated the Quechan in the San Pasqual Valley.

The Kumeyaay withdrew from the war after the capitulation of the Cahuilla to the US and the failed attempt to capture Fort Yuma.

Compared to other California tribes, the Kumeyaay did not face the same magnitude of destruction and exploitation under the California genocide. This was due to the strategic positioning of the Kumeyaay and the lack of gold in the mountains. Additionally, Mexican officials in Baja California Territory threatened to intervene in the conflict if they committed any atrocities on tribes along the border, due to a mix of Mexican sympathies towards the Native Californians and a fear of refugees coming across the border.

====Establishment of Kumeyaay reservations in the U.S.====
On January 7, 1852, representatives of a number of Kumeyaay clans, including Panto, met with Commissioner Oliver M. Wozencraft and negotiated the Treaty of Santa Ysabel. The agreement was part of the &quot;18 Treaties&quot; of California, negotiated to protect Indian land rights. After the 18 Treaties were completed, the documents were sent to the United States Senate for approval. Under pressure from white settlers and the California Senate delegation, the treaties were all rejected.

From 1870 to 1910, American settlers seized lands, including arable and native gathering lands. In 1875, President Ulysses S. Grant created reservations in the area, and additional lands were placed under trust patent status after the passage of the 1891 Act for the Relief of Mission Indians. The reservations tended to be small and lacked adequate water supplies. The situation was made worse during the famine of 1880–1881, which forced many Kumeyaay to survive by accepting charity from whites, as they faced diseases, starvation and attacks from white settlers.

Some Kumeyaay chose not to establish a reservation inland and sought work in San Diego, many of whom migrated to the Kumeyaay village in what is now Balboa Park led by the Florida Canyon Kumeyaay Band. The village experienced growth after receiving immigrants from other Kumeyaay bands as well as from other indigenous Californian and Bajeno tribes, who sought work in the city, transforming the village into a neighborhood integrated into the city fabric. The village was then demolished in the early 1900s in preparation for the 1915 Panama–California Exposition, displacing the residents of the village.
In 1932, the Coapan Kumeyaay living and farming on the San Diego River were removed to make way for El Capitan Dam and El Capitan Reservoir and relocated their inhabitants at the Barona Reservation and the Viejas Reservation, further cutting down the agricultural capacity of the Kumeyaay reservations.

====Kumeyaay in the Mexican Revolution (1910–1911)====
During the Mexican Revolution, the Magonistas gained the support of the Kumeyaay with an enthusiastic base, particularly in the Tecate region; many Kumeyaay from both sides of the border were enticed by their anarcho-syndicalist message of indigenous liberation from the Mexican and American colonial nation-states starting with the end of the Porfirio Díaz dictatorship. The Kumeyaay supported the Magonistas as guides throughout the land, whose aid allowed them to control Mexicali, Tecate, and Tijuana during the Magonista rebellion of 1911. However, the Kumeyaay did not participate in much of the active fighting in the Magonista Rebellion, and did not participate with Cocopah, Kiliwa, and Paipai tribes in raiding on small towns or looting Chinese-Mexican businesses in the region, and may have even smuggled Chinese-Mexican refugees to the American side of the border. By the end of June, the rebellion was suppressed by the Madero administration.

After the revolution, the ban on Ejidos and other forms of communal living were lifted and the Kumeyaay were able to resume their traditional communal way of life legitimately with their communities in Valle de Las Palmas, Peña Blanca, and their five other reservations.

===Contemporary era===

====Kumeyaay-American economy and casino industry====
Kumeyaay people supported themselves by farming and agricultural wage labor; however, a 20-year drought in the mid-20th century crippled the region&#x27;s dry farming economy. For their common welfare, several reservations in the US formed the non-profit Kumeyaay, Inc.

Cuts in Native American welfare programs under the Reagan and Bush Sr. administrations forced the reservation to find other means of income and capitalize on industries not possible off-reservation.
In 1982, the Barona Band won its case in &quot;Barona Group of the Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians v. Duffy&quot; (1982) to operate high-stakes bingo games, leading to the expansion of many Kumeyaay bingo operators into the casino industry. This helped establish Las Vegas-style gaming operations in the reservations in the region, evaporating reservation unemployment and poverty in a short time. In total, the Kumeyaay operate six casinos: Barona Valley Ranch Resort and Casino, Sycuan Resort and Casino, Viejas Casino &amp; Resort, Valley View Casino and Hotel, Golden Acorn Casino and Travel Center, and Jamul Casino.

In response to the casino construction boom, the San Diego County government maintained a policy of opposition to any growth in tribal expansion under any circumstance in fears that land would be used to build more casinos, which broke down relations between the County and the Kumeyaay, Payomkawichum (Luiseño), and Kuupangaxwichem (Cupeño) tribal reservation governments. This San Diego County Board of Supervisors repealed these policies in May 2021.

The relative success of gaming operations on many reservations has allowed them to buy naming rights of infrastructure around the San Diego region, such as the Sycuan Green Line of the San Diego Trolley and the SDSU Viejas Arena. Some reservations have also diversified their economic profile such as Campo Reservation-based Muht Hei inc which oversees the reservation&#x27;s wind farm or Sycuan Band&#x27;s acquisition of the U.S. Grant Hotel. Additionally, Sycuan also became the first Native American tribe to own part of a professional soccer franchise by becoming the co-owner of San Diego FC, a Major League Soccer expansion team, and the second to have an ownership stake in any professional sports team.

====Kumeyaay-Mexican economy and the wine tourism industry====
On the Mexican side of the border, Kumeyaay reservations manufacture traditional craftwork to sell on the American side of the border with partnering Kumeyaay souvenir gift shops and casinos.

Many Kumeyaay there have moved into urban areas to seek better employment opportunities compared to their agrarian employment on the reservation. The depopulation of their reservations has allowed neighboring non-native Ejidos to encroach on their lands.

The Kumeyaay reservations on the Mexican side of the border have largely retained their traditional heritage. Some reservations faced water shortages, making it difficult to continue agricultural operation. This led many communities to enter wine-tasting and tourism industries in the Guadalupe Valley. Many bands began launching wine tours and festivals to attract tourists and foreign visitors from southern California and cruise passengers stopping at the Port of Ensenada.

====Kumeyaay and the US-Mexican border====

In 1998, the Kumeyaay established the Kumeyaay Border task force to work with federal immigration officials to secure free passage of Baja Kumeyaay bands to visit the US Kumeyaay bands and ensure their rights to protected graves and artifacts protected by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990.

However, border wall construction accelerated in 2020 and Kumeyaay representatives at the border to protect and preserve Kumeyaay artifacts were turned away from the construction area. This sparked protests among the bands and Kumeyaay women organized to lead a protest at the border in July. The La Posta Band filed a lawsuit in August against the Trump administration seeking to block further construction of the border wall through their sacred cemetery (burial sites).

==Society==

===Social structure===

Prior to Western assimilation, the Kumeyaay were organized into bands or clans called &quot;sibs&quot; or &quot;shiimull,&quot; which were grounded in family lineages with each sib home for 5 to 15 families. Each sib had their own territory and had the right to enforce land property rights in punishing thieves and trespassers. However, Kumeyaay did recognize the right to water and were also obligated to share food with visitors.

The Kumeyaay had a patriarchal society where the position of chief, or &quot;Kwaapaay&quot;, was inherited from the father to son, although widows were sometimes permitted to assume the position. It was the Kwaapaay&#x27;s role to protect traditions, hold ceremonies, and resolve disputes and was responsible for political, religious, and economic activities of the sib. Future Kwaapaays were often selected by a Kwaapaay of another with no family relations to ensure impartiality.

Kwaapaays were also accompanied by assistants and had a council of &quot;Kuseyaays&quot;. &quot;Kuseyaays&quot; were made up of male or female priests, doctors, and other specialists in the fields of health, ecology, resource management, tradition, and religion. Kuseyaays could be called by the kwaapaay to provide information or to make decisions for the sib&#x27;s welfare. Each family in the sib was allowed to follow and participate in the decision making, or could leave the sib and pursue their own decision.

The Kumeyaay practiced arranged marriage made by parents of different sibs. The future husband was expected to demonstrate his ability to hunt and needed to present the future bride the game he had killed. The bride would move into the husband&#x27;s sib once they were married. Marriage relations were also made between sibs and other neighboring tribal groups as a gesture of peace between warring groups or as part of a trade relationship.

===Shelter===
Kumeyaay generally lived in dome-shaped homes made from branches and covered with leaves of willow or tule, called &#x27;ewaa. These structures had a hole at the top to let smoke out and rocks along its base to keep out wind and small animals. Some Kumeyaay who lived in the mountains made their home out of slabs of bark.

These structures were often temporary. When families moved or if someone died in the house, they were often burned down.

===Clothing===
During warm seasons, men wore nothing except for a hide breechcloth to hold tools while women wore an apron or a skirt made from willow or elderberry bark. In the colder months, they would wear blankets made from willow bark or rabbit skins.

They wore agave sandals made from yucca and agave fibers when going over long distances, over sharp rocks, or hot sand. Some would wear bead necklaces as jewelry, with beads made of clam, abalone, or olivella shells. Additionally, men could get their nose pierced and women might have their chins tattooed.

The Kumeyaay started to abandon much of their traditional clothing after coming in contact with the Spanish, and adopted European-style clothing, wearing clothes that were normal in Latin America.

===Diet===
Acorns were a staple of the Kumeyaay diet, and made acorn mush they called &quot;shawii,&quot; which could be used in dough to make bread by grinding with a mano and a metate. Other grains like pinon nuts or chia seeds were also stone-ground and consumed. The Kumeyaay stored these grains in basket granaries made of willow leaves. They also consumed the leaves and fruits of the prickly pear and copal cactus, as well as cherries, plums, elderberries, and Manzanita berries. They also fermented many of these plants with water and honey to create alcohol.

They hunted for animals such as birds, rabbits, squirrels, and woodrats, as well as larger animals like antelope, deer, and mountain sheep. The Kumeyaay also ate more nutrient-rich insects such as crickets, grubs and grasshoppers.

Kamia Kumeyaay in the Imperial Valley practiced some forms of agriculture, producing maize, beans, and teparies. Like other Kumeyaay, though, they largely relied on gathering.

===Economy and communication===
The Ipai-Tipai Kumeyaay traded with the Kamia Kumeyaay to obtain obsidian from an area south of the Salton Sea. Within the Tipai-Ipai, the coastal Kumeyaay traded salt, seaweed, and abalone shells for acorns, agave, mesquite beans, and gourds from the mountain Kumeyaay. They also traded along the Pacific coast to obtain Olivella shell beads from the Chumash, as well as tribes along the Gulf of California and in the American Southwest as far east as to trade with the Zuni. Granite was also plentiful in Kumeyaay lands, which was used to trade for pestles, steatite, eagle feathers, and colored minerals for paint.

The Kumeyaay&#x27;s maritime economy relied on shell fishing, and they built fishing boats, either balsa rafts made of reeds or dugout canoes. To support their maritime economy, they manufactured fishing spears, hooks, and nets made of agave fiber.

Upon Spanish arrival, woven baskets were highly prized by the Europeans, as these baskets were so well made that they could hold water and it was possible to cook food with these baskets in an open fire. The strong demand for Californian woven baskets in Mexican and European markets strengthened the basket weaving economy among the Kumeyaay.

The Kumeyaay had a system of trail runners who carried messages and announcements between bands, which notified the presence of the Spaniards prior to Cabrillo&#x27;s arrival in San Diego.

===Weaponry===
The Kumeyaay used archery in order to hunt prey. The arrows were made of wood, reeds, or cane, as well as chamise or greasewood plant for larger animals. Bows were made of mesquite or ash, as well as animal hides. They also equipped with throwing sticks better known as rabbit sticks, which were used to knock out small animals and were sometimes used in war.

===Culture===
The Kumeyaay has a continuous song and dance culture, of which many are still passed on to the next generation during special occasions. Occasions like the mourning of an important figure was honored by an Eagle Dance, and a War Dance accompanied those heading for battle. Men often sang songs with a rattle, while women supported the song through dance. Through the Mission, the Kumeyaay picked up skills in Western musical instruments, and joined the Mission choirs and orchestras.

They also had animal companions and domesticated mockingbirds and roadrunners as pets.

=== Stories ===
One Kumeyaay creation story involves the original state of the world as being covered with salt water and tule, without land. The older brother Tuchaipa (also known as Tu-chai-pai, Tcaipakomat) and the younger twin brother Yokomatis (Yo-ko-mat-is) make the world. Tuchaipa rubs tobacco in his hand and blows it three times, causing the heavens to rise up and form the sky. He draws a line from east to west, named Y-nak and A-uk. He draws a line from north to south, named Ka-tulk and Ya-wak. He tells Yo-ko-mat-is that from the east three or four men are coming from the east, and from the east three or four Indians are coming, and he makes hills and valleys with hollows of water so the humans will not die of dehydration. He makes forests so humans will not die of cold. Then he makes humans out of mud, who can walk but never get tired, and tells them that they must walk to the east towards the light. When the humans reach the Sun, he makes the Moon, and tells the men they must run races when the Moon is small. Later, when there is less food and water, Tuchaipa calls together the men without the women and gives them three choices; to die forever; to live for a time and return; or to live forever. The men are divided over what to choose, and talk and talk without knowing what to do. Then the fly comes and says to choose to die forever, and so the men choose to be done with life and die forever. This is the reason why the fly rubs his hands together, to beg the forgiveness of humans. 

In another story, Tcaipakomat and Yokomatis have their eyes closed from the blinding salt water. Yokomatis tries to see atop the water, but opens his eyes and is blinded. Tcaipakomat goes on top of the water and sees nothing, so he makes little red ants (miskiluiw, ciracir) which fill the water with their bodies to make land. Then Tcaipakomat makes a type of black bird with a flat bill (xanyil) to come into being, but they were lost without their roosts, so Tcaipakomat takes red clay, yellow clay, and black clay to make a round flat object, and throws it into the sky to make a dimly-shining moon (halya). Tcaipakomat tries again with another piece of clay to make the brighter sun (inyau). Then he takes a light colored piece of clay (mutakwic), and splits it up, making a man, and the a woman (Sinyaxau, First Woman). The children of this man and this woman are people (ipai). 

===Reservation era Kumeyaay institutions===
The Kumeyaay Community College was created by the Sycuan Band to serve the Kumeyaay-Diegueño Nation, and describes its mission as &quot;to support cultural identity, sovereignty, and self-determination while meeting the needs of native and non-native students&quot;. The college&#x27;s focus is on &quot;Kumeyaay History, Kumeyaay Ethnobotany and traditional Indigenous arts&quot; It &quot;serves and relies on resources from the thirteen reservations of the Kumeyaay Nation situated in San Diego county&quot;. In the fall of 2016, Cuyamaca College began offering an associate degree in Kumeyaay Studies with courses at its Rancho San Diego campus, as well as at Kumeyaay Community College on the Sycuan reservation.

The Sycuan Institute on Tribal Gaming was also established at SDSU by the Sycuan Band with the focus on research and policy related to the tribal gaming industry.

==Population==

Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. In 1925, Alfred L. Kroeber proposed that the population of the Kumeyaay in the San Diego region in 1770 had been about 3,000. More recently, Katharine Luomala points out that this estimate depended on calculations of rates of baptisms at the Mission, and as such &quot;ignores the unbaptized&quot;. She suggests that the region could have supported 6,000–9,000 people. Florence C. Shipek goes further, estimating 16,000–19,000 inhabitants.

In the late eighteenth century, it is estimated that the Kumeyaay population was between 3,000 and 9,000. In 1828, 1,711 Kumeyaay were recorded by the missions. The 1860 federal census recorded 1,571 Kumeyaay living in 24 villages. The Bureau of Indian Affairs recorded 1,322 Kumeyaay in 1968, with 435 living on reservations. By 1990, an estimated 1,200 lived on reservation lands, while 2,000 lived elsewhere.

<doc id="878842" wikidata="Q880829" url="?curid=878842" title="Blackfriars, London">
<text>Blackfriars is in central London, specifically the south-west corner of the City of London.

==Blackfriars Priory==

The name first occurs in records of 1317 in many orthographies. Friar evolved from as has, meaning &#x27;brother&#x27;. Black refers to the black cappa worn by Dominican Friars. They moved their 1220s-founded priory from just west of Holborn bridge at the top of Shoe Lane (modern Holborn Circus) a few hundred metres south to be between the tidal Thames and the west of Ludgate Hill, a modest rise, but the highest in the city proper, in about 1276. Edward I gave permission to rebuild London&#x27;s city wall, against the Fleet brook and Ludgate Hill, north and west of their precinct. The site hosted great occasions of state, including meetings of Parliament and the Privy Council, state visits, such as of Emperor Charles V in 1522, then, seven years later, a divorce hearing of Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII. The priory was by legal process dissolved in 1538 under Henry&#x27;s dissolution of the monasteries. Katherine Parr, Henry&#x27;s sixth and final wife, was born in an associated parish.

==Local wharves of Puddle Dock==

Until the early 20th century the local wharves were linked to the main street by the formerly narrow street Puddle Dock. These stood by an often dredged up to, pier- and mooring post-lined, substantial mudbank of the City – in the south-east of modern Blackfriars. Among these were Wheatsheaf Wharf. Paul&#x27;s Stairs is east of the modern floating pier, leading to the much narrowed, wholly tidal foreshore (meaning immersed for much of the tidal phases).

==Amenities==
Some of the buildings were later leased to a group of entrepreneurs who created the Blackfriars Theatre on the site, near Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre which stood almost directly across the river. In 1632, the Society of Apothecaries (a livery company), acquired the late medieval guesthouse which they converted as their base. This was destroyed in the Great Fire of London of 1666 but the Society rebuilt it, becoming today&#x27;s Apothecaries&#x27; Hall due north of the station.

At the very centre of the zone, in typical London equidistance from stations post-pariochial terms, is Blackfriars station on a large wholly built-up roundabout. Southwest of this is Blackfriars Bridge and south, the railway bridge. A notably long road, Blackfriars Road, in Bankside, Southwark – a main approach to the road bridge – hosts near its northern extreme skyscraper One Blackfriars. For a short arc north-west of the small gyratory around the large station complex (with Bridge House, office and retail buildings) stretches back the Crowne Plaza London – The City hotel, a conversion from Spicers Brothers papermakers headquarters, of 1916 facing a few mature trees on a hardscaped small &quot;square&quot; or piazza. Southeast of this circle is Blackfriars Millennium Pier, a stop for river-bus services on London River Services.

The Victoria Embankment stretches along the north bank of the river west from Blackfriars to Westminster Bridge. Notable buildings include the large Art Deco Unilever House, and also facing the station&#x27;s gyratory, the Art Nouveau Black Friar pub. Further clockwise, facing, are the Bank of New York/Mellon building and the Mermaid Theatre, now a conference centre.

The forerunner station stood south of the river, Blackfriars Bridge railway station, no major trace of which remains. It was closed to passengers in 1885 when the current station opened, as &quot;St Pauls&quot; for some decades.

==Listed buildings==
One or two elaborate streets of Blackfriars were well repaired after the City was heavily bombed in the Blitz (1940 to 1945). These, of genuine Victorian or city Georgian architecture, are frequently sets for film and television series. These include &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; and &quot;David Copperfield&quot;.

== Burials at Blackfriars, London ==
* Elizabeth de Badlesmere, Countess of Northampton
* Edward Hastings, 2nd Baron Hastings
* Robert St. Lawrence 3rd Baron Howth
* Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent
*John Cornwall, 1st Baron Fanhope

==Neighbouring parts of London==

**Ludgate Hill/City Thameslink
**St Paul&#x27;s
***Mansion House (south-east of above)

In 2011, Hay commented on his early solo career, stating, &quot;After Men at Work, for the better part of a decade, I was stumbling around being unfocused. It was pre-internet; I really had to try to find my audiences by going out on tour. Men at Work really didn&#x27;t build a foundational audience. We came in as a pop band with enormous radio success; once that goes away and the band breaks up the audience tends to go away with it. You&#x27;re left with what you want to make of it. When you start out doing those tours, you start again [and] you tend not to attract a very big number of people. I&#x27;d play to a hundred people or sometimes less&quot;.

In December 2013, Hay announced on his website that he was done touring &quot;for the time being&quot; and would spend 2014 writing and recording.

In February 2015, Hay released his twelfth studio album, &quot;Next Year People&quot;. The album was preceded by the single &quot;Trying to Get to You&quot;.

On 4 August 2015, &quot;Colin Hay: Waiting for my Real Life&quot;, a documentary film about Hay, debuted at the Melbourne International Film Festival.

On 27 January 2017, he released the first single, &quot;A Thousand Million Reasons&quot;, from his thirteenth studio album &quot;Fierce Mercy&quot;, released in March 2017. &quot;Fierce Mercy&quot; debuted at number 44 on the ARIA chart, becoming his second solo chart entry in Australia. The album was promoted with his segments on &quot;Julia Zemiro&#x27;s Home Delivery&quot; and &quot;Sunday Night&quot;.

Also in 2017, Hay released his first audiobook, &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables with Colin Hay&quot;, published by Devault-Graves Digital Editions, for which he narrated 24 of Aesop&#x27;s Fables written by author Tom Graves.

===2021–present: &quot;Down Under&quot; remix success===
In August 2021, Hay released his fourteenth studio album, &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Know What to Do with Myself&quot;. The album features 10 versions of some of Hay&#x27;s favourite songs from the Beatles (Norwegian Wood, Across the Universe) Blind Faith, Del Amitri, Dusty Springfield, Faces, Gerry and the Pacemakers, Glen Campbell (Wichita Lineman), Jimmy Cliff (Many Rivers to Cross) and the Kinks (Waterloo Sunset).

In late 2021, Australian producer Christian &quot;Luude&quot; Benson (from the Tasmanian electronic dance music duo Choomba) remixed Men at Work&#x27;s &quot;Down Under&quot; as a drum and bass track, with Hay re-recording the vocal for the track&#x27;s release on the Sweat It Out record label. &quot;Down Under&quot; by Luude featuring Colin Hay charted at number 32 on the UK Singles chart on 7 January 2022 and at number 48 in Australia (ARIA Top 50 Singles for
week of 10 January 2022).

Hay&#x27;s fifteenth studio album, &quot;Now and the Evermore&quot;, was released on 18 March 2022.

In 2024 band Lime Cordiale released their song &quot;Colin&quot; from their album &quot;Enough Of The Sweet Talk&quot;. Hays lends vocals to the song and part of the music video was filmed at his house. 

==Personal life==
Hay is married to singer Cecilia Noël, who often provides backing vocals at his shows. Noël has also helped with production on Hay&#x27;s solo studio albums. Hay said of his ninth solo studio album, &quot;Are You Lookin&#x27; at Me?&quot; (2007) that &quot;She was really crucial. She was a really great sounding board for me. She&#x27;s a really good producer in the sense that she&#x27;s very musical and has a great sense of song structure and so forth. So she was great to bounce ideas off. And she sang on nearly all the songs. So she was really a great part of this record&quot;. Hay and Noël live in Topanga Canyon in the Los Angeles area.

On 13 February 2009, former Men at Work band member Ron Strykert was arrested for allegedly making death threats against Hay.

Hay became an American citizen in 2016. He also has a residence in St Kilda, Melbourne.

<doc id="878851" wikidata="Q571579" url="?curid=878851" title="Please Save My Earth">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Saki Hiwatari. It was published by Hakusensha from December 1986 to May 1994 in the magazine &quot;Hana to Yume&quot; and collected in 21 &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. It is about six young people and a seven-year-old boy who share common dreams about their past lives as alien scientists who observed the Earth from the Moon.

The series was adapted as a six-part original video animation (OVA) in 1993. A sequel manga, &quot;Embraced by the Moonlight&quot;, was serialized in the bimonthly &quot;Hana to Yume&quot; as well as the special edition magazine, &quot;Hana to Yume Plus&quot;. It has since been followed by &quot;I Sing with the Earth&quot;. Both the anime OVA and manga are licensed for distribution in North America by Viz Media.

By May 2006, &quot;Please Save My Earth&quot; had over 15 million copies in circulation.

==Plot==

The story centers around high-school student Alice Sakaguchi, her seven-year-old next door neighbor, Rin Kobayashi who attends elementary school, and five other students who have recurring collective dreams about a group of alien scientists stationed on the Moon observing and collecting data about the Earth. Initially, when Alice learns that her classmates Jinpachi and Issei have been having common recurring dreams since middle school, she thinks nothing of it until one day she has one of these &quot;Moon dreams&quot; herself. Because of the nature of these dreams, the way Issei always dreams as the same person, and Jinpachi as well, now that Alice has provided a third perspective, they start to believe that people who dream as the other four scientists in their &quot;Moon dreams&quot; can each be found. Almost like playing a simple game, the three make plans to seek these other people out in the hopes of making sense of these dreams. After a suggestion from Issei, and a little bit of time and luck, they are finally able to make contact with the other four people. But as the six people and one child start to piece together the chronology and content of their dreams, they began to realize that their &quot;dreams&quot; are not simply dreams, but rather suppressed memories of their past incarnations that ended tragically. And now, as their &quot;game&quot; begins to unravel, the kids must strive to come to terms with what happened in their past lives, as they struggle to prevent their past incarnations&#x27; rivalries, jealousies, and dubious actions from taking over their new ones.

==Production==
Before starting to work on &quot;Please Save My Earth&quot;, Saki Hiwatari was exhausted by drawing her previous series Akuma-kun and wanted to create something that would feel &quot;healing&quot; for her to draw. She observed the magnolia tree at her workplace and started off from there. However, when working on the script, she added more suspense. She described working on the series as a result of her fighting with herself over whether she should draw something serious or something funny. Initially, the series was only supposed to last one year. The series mixes dramatic storytelling with comic relief. Many of the jokes in early volumes of the series refer to 1980s anime and manga. Critic Jason Thompson notes that the story becomes more dark and adult-themed from volume 9 on. The visual style, for example of the character design, changes throughout the series. The character design of Issei&#x27;s sister Kyoko was influenced by Osamu Tezuka and is a homage to classic style of manga artists such as Miyako Maki, Makoto Takahashi, Hideko Mizuno, and Shotaro Ishinomori.

==Media==
===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Saki Hiwatari, &quot;Please Save My Earth&quot; was serialized by Hakusensha in the monthly magazine &quot;Hana to Yume&quot; from December 20, 1986 to May 20, 1994, with its chapters collected in 21 &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. The series was later reissued in 12 &quot;bunkoban&quot; volumes in 1998; and again in an A5 format edition (&quot;wide-ban&quot;) of 10 volumes in 2004.

It is licensed in English in North America by Viz Media, with all volumes translated. The series has also been translated into French; German; and Spanish.

&quot;Please Save My Earth&quot; was adapted as an original video animation (OVA) directed by Kazuo Yamazaki and produced by Production I.G. The six-episode OVA anime covers the first 8 volumes in condensed form. It is licensed in English by Viz Media. is a 100-minute compilation movie narrated by Alice, reminiscing on the events of the main OVA as she is on her way to meet with Rin in a park. contains six music videos with footage not seen in the main OVA and scenes taken from the manga, as well as a slightly different version of the OVA ending sequence, and the ending credits for the image videos.

==Reception==
By May 2006, &quot;Please Save My Earth&quot; had over 15 million copies in circulation.

Starting in volume 8 of the manga, a disclaimer appeared at the bottom of the first page of every compilation volume, stating that the story was entirely fictional. This was, because Hiwatari received letters from people who were convinced that they had been part of the Moon scientist&#x27;s society or even one of the Moon scientists themselves, and had been sent on Earth. These disclaimers have since appeared in her others works, most notably on the first pages of each volume of &quot;Global Garden&quot;.

Several manga artists have cited &quot;Please Save My Earth&quot; as an influence on them, including Naoko Takeuchi and Bisco Hatori. Jason Thompson called &quot;Please Save My Earth&quot; in &quot;&quot; a &quot;masterpiece of young-adult science fiction&quot; and praised Hiwatari&#x27;s &quot;slow-paced&quot; as well as &quot;consistently rewarding and unpredictable&quot; storytelling.

<text>Heather Farr (March 10, 1965 – November 20, 1993) was an American professional golfer on the 

==Early years==
Born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona, Farr was the elder of two daughters of Gerald D. (Jerry) and Sharon Farr. She and her sister Missy were introduced to golf by their father, a former rodeo cowboy and Air Force veteran, and the family spent countless hours together at the public Papago Golf Course in east Phoenix.

Farr won three state high school championships while at the all-girls Xavier College Preparatory, and is a member of the National High School Sports Hall of Fame and the azcentral.com Arizona High School Sports Hall of Fame. At a diminutive , she was nicknamed &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; during her teenage years.

==Golf career==
===College===
Farr graduated from high school a year early in 1982 and was a top recruit with many scholarship offers. She chose to stay close and enrolled at Arizona State University in adjacent Tempe, where she played for the Sun Devils women&#x27;s golf team. At ASU she became a well-known golfer, both in Arizona and nationwide, winning the 1982 U.S. Girls&#x27; Junior and 1984 U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur Public Links.

At the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open, Farr tied for eleventh and was low amateur as an 18-year-old in 1983 in Oklahoma, then tied for fortieth in Massachusetts in 1984. Farr played on the U.S. teams in the 1984 Curtis Cup and Espirito Santo Trophy. She was an All-American and was inducted into the ASU Sun Devils&#x27; Hall of Fame in 1990.

===LPGA Tour===
After three years at ASU, Farr turned pro in June 1985; she tied for eighth at the LPGA Tour&#x27;s qualifying tournament near Houston in October to earn her tour card, and began play in early 1986.

Farr&#x27;s best finish on tour was a tie for third at the Mazda Classic at Boca Raton, Florida in early 1988, and she had six top ten finishes that season.

==Breast cancer==
With her pro career on the rise, Farr was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 24 in July 1989. Her battle with cancer became national news for the next four years. She played on tour on a limited basis in the fall of 1990, but more cancer was found in her spine and the base of her skull. In March 1991, Farr underwent a 13-hour operation to rebuild her vertebrae and stabilize her back with a metal rod. That August, she began working on her putting stroke, with hopes to return to the tour. In 1992, she married Goran Lingmerth in March, and played six holes of a skins game at the Sara Lee Classic in April, but in May more cancer was found on her pelvis and skull.

Through 1993, &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; newspaper of Phoenix kept a daily column which updated Farr&#x27;s health condition. She became admired by many Arizonans because she kept hope of returning to the golf links soon, despite her ordeal. Beginning in August, she had numerous surgeries to relieve internal bleeding, and underwent surgery at Scottsdale Memorial Hospital-North on November 11 to relieve a brain hemorrhage; she died nine days later at age 28, surrounded by her family and many LPGA tour pros.

==Legacy==
Farr was posthumously named an &quot;ambassador&quot; of the Grayhawk Golf Club in Arizona, and her family established the Heather Farr Foundation. In addition to that numerous golf awards have been named after her.

In 1994, the LPGA established the Heather Farr Player Award to celebrate the life of Farr. The award &quot;recognizes an LPGA Tour player who, through her hard work, dedication and love of the game of golf, has demonstrated determination, perseverance and spirit in fulfilling her goals as a player, qualities for which Farr is so fondly remembered&quot;.

Farr is buried at St. Francis Cemetery in Phoenix, beside her father Jerry (1939–2014).

Her younger sister Missy Farr-Kaye became the head coach of the women&#x27;s golf team at Arizona State in June 2015, after many years as an assistant at their alma mater. Also diagnosed with breast cancer at age 30, she is a two-time cancer survivor (1998, 2008) and leads her sister&#x27;s foundation.

<doc id="878854" wikidata="Q6771397" url="?curid=878854" title="Marksmanship badges (United States)">
<text>In the United States (U.S.), a marksmanship badge is a U.S. military badge or a civilian badge which is awarded to personnel upon successful completion of a weapons qualification course (known as marksmanship qualification badges) or high achievement in an official marksmanship competition (known as marksmanship competition badges). The U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps are the only military services that award marksmanship qualification badges. However, marksmanship medals and/or marksmanship ribbons are awarded by the U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Air Force for weapons qualifications. For non-military personnel, different U.S. law enforcement organizations and the National Rifle Association (NRA) award marksmanship qualification badges to those involved in law enforcement. Additionally, the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP) and the NRA award marksmanship qualification badges to U.S. civilians. Most of these organizations and the U.S. National Guard award marksmanship competition badges to the people they support who succeed in official competitions.

The U.S. Army awards their marksmanship qualification badges for a variety of weapons while the U.S. Marine Corps only awards theirs for the service rifle and service pistol. For civilians, the CMP awards the Army Marksmanship Qualification Badges for rifle, small bore rifle, pistol, and small bore pistol as well as its own air rifle badges. Of those U.S. law enforcement organizations that award marksmanship qualification badges, most award them for their service pistols while others will also award them for rifle and/or shotgun. The NRA awards marksmanship qualification badges for air rifles, rifles, pistols, and shotguns; however the NRA focuses on different rifles and pistols than the CMP. For marksmanship competition badges, the U.S. military award rifle and pistol competition badges; however, the U.S. National Guard also awards marksmanship competition badges for machine gun and sniper rifle. The CMP awards marksmanship competition badges for air rifle, rifle, pistol, and .22 rimfire pistol while the NRA awards them for air rifle, small bore rifle, revolver, and semi-automatic pistol.

The U.S. military and CMP marksmanship qualification badges are awarded in three grades (highest to lowest): expert, sharpshooter, and marksman while their marksmanship competition badges are awarded in three to four grades (highest to lowest): distinguished, silver, and bronze for the U.S. Army, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. civilians; distinguished, gold, silver, and bronze for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps; and distinguished, silver with wreath, bronze with wreath, and bronze for the U.S. Air Force. The NRA marksmanship qualification badges are awarded in five to six grades (highest to lowest): distinguished expert, expert, sharpshooter, marksman first-class &quot;(Winchester/NRA Marksmanship Qualification Program only)&quot;, marksman, and pro-marksman. U.S. law enforcement marksmanship qualification badges tend to follow NRA guidelines for marksmanship qualification badges or have their own criteria and badge structure. The NRA and the U.S. National Guard marksmanship competition badges are only awarded at one grade with the exception of the NRA&#x27;s Law Enforcement Distinguished Program, which awards a Law Enforcement Excellence-in-Competition Badge for those officers who earn their first points towards one of the law enforcement distinguished badges.

==Marksmanship qualification badges==
Starting in the late 19th century, the U.S. Army began awarding marksmanship qualification badges to its soldiers who met specific weapon qualification standards. In the early 20th century, the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy began awarding marksmanship qualification badges as well. The Marine Corps began by awarding Army Marksmanship Qualification Badges but eventually developed its own badge design, based on the original Army designs from the early 1900s. The Navy developed its own marksmanship qualification badge but retired it after only ten years in lieu of awarding marksmanship ribbons and medals.

For U.S. civilians, the Office of the Director of Civilian Marksmanship—now known as the Corporation for the Promotion of Rifle Practice and Firearm Safety (CPRPFS)—and the NRA began promoting civilian marksmanship in 1903. The CPRPFS&#x27;s CMP awards Army Marksmanship Qualification Badges to civilians who meet U.S. Army weapon qualification standards as well as its own badges to youth for air rifle marksmanship. The NRA began awarding its own marksmanship qualification badges to civilians in 1918 and today has two primary marksmanship proficiency programs, the Winchester/NRA Marksmanship Qualification Program and the Explorer Service Handgun Qualification Program. Additionally, the NRA supports numerous other firearm proficiency programs throughout the United States, such as those found within various U.S. law enforcement organizations.

===U.S. Army===

The U.S. Army awards Army Marksmanship Qualification Badges to its soldiers, U.S. Army uniformed civilian guards, and foreign military personnel, while the CMP awards these same badges to U.S. civilians who qualify at three different qualification levels (highest to lowest): expert, sharpshooter, and marksman. Suspended from the badge are Army Weapon Qualification Clasps that indicate the type of weapon the individual has qualified to use. The following list of Army Weapon Qualification Clasps are currently authorized under U.S. Army Pamphlet 670-1:

The level at which one qualifies is dependent on the weapon, firing range, and the course of fire. For example, to earn an Army Marksmanship Qualification Badge for Pistol at the Combat Pistol Qualification Course, one must have a combined hit count of 26 out of 30 for expert, 21 out of 30 for sharpshooter, and 16 out of 30 for marksman on firing tables one through five. Regardless of the soldier&#x27;s overall score, everyone must have a minimum hit count of three out of five while wearing a gas mask for the chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear firing table and two out of four while shooting at night for the night firing table. Each of these firing tables test the shooter on different aspects of combat pistol shooting (shooting from a concealed position, speed loading, shooting on the move, etc.) while engaging human silhouettes at varying distances within an allotted time.

Army Marksmanship Qualification Badges are not permanent awards. When a soldier re-qualifies with their weapon at a different level, the soldier replaces their qualification badge with a new badge that reflects their current level. Only three Army Marksmanship Qualification Badges are authorized for wear on U.S. Army service uniforms and each may have no more than three Army Weapon Qualification Clasps. Although these badges are awarded to both officers and enlisted soldiers alike, as a matter of U.S. Army tradition, only non-commissioned officers and enlisted soldiers are expected to wear these badges on their service uniforms in most units, although policy is set by the commander of each unit.

====Former Army qualification badges====

The Army began using marksmanship qualification badges in 1881 starting with the Marksman Button. That led to a variety of different U.S. Army branch specific marksmanship badges until 1897 when the Rifle Marksmanship Badges were implemented Army wide. The U.S. Army&#x27;s Pistol Marksmanship Badges were implemented ten years later in 1907. Clasps were added to the Sharpshooter Marksmanship Badge and Expert Marksmanship Badge to indicate the year(s) a soldier requalified as a sharpshooter or expert. Up to three years were denoted on a single clasp. Upon earning the badge a fourth time, another clasp was added and that new clasp was used to denote up to three additional years of requalification; there was no limit to the number of clasps that could be hung from these badges. In 1915, the U.S. Army changed the design of the Expert Pistol Qualification Badge&#x27;s pendant by replacing the revolvers with M1911s; this pendant lives on in today&#x27;s Marine Corps Expert Pistol Qualification Badge. Additionally, the U.S. Army had a short-lived series of Artillery Qualification Badges from 1891 through 1913. In 1921, the pistol and artillery badges were combined into today&#x27;s Army Marksmanship Qualification Badges through the addition of the Pistol Clasp and Field Artillery Clasp. Prior to 1951, the names of the qualification levels for the current Army Marksmanship Qualification Badges were known as (highest to lowest) expert, sharpshooter or first-class gunner, and marksman or second-class gunner. Also, prior to 1972, the Army Marksmanship Qualification Badges had many different types of weapon qualification clasps. According to The Institute of Heraldry, the following is a list of previously awarded Army Weapon Qualification Clasps:
===U.S. Marine Corps===

The U.S. Marine Corps award two types of Marine Corps Marksmanship Qualification Badges, one for the service rifle and one for the service pistol, to all Marines who qualify at three different qualification levels (highest to lowest): expert, sharpshooter, and marksman. These qualification badges are suspended beneath a brooch which bears the name of the type of weapon (rifle or pistol) and the qualification level earned. Some of these badges are different in appearance, depending on the type of weapon and qualification level.
For a Marine to earn a marksmanship qualification badge, they must obtain a passing score at an annual weapons qualification event. To earn a Marine Corps Rifle Qualification Badge, a Marine must successfully complete multiple tables of fire to include the Fundamental Rifle Marksmanship Table, the Basic Combat Rifle Marksmanship Table, the Intermediate Combat Rifle Marksmanship Table, and the Advanced Combat Rifle Marksmanship Table. These tables require a Marine to engage human silhouettes at varying distances, positions, and scenarios within an allotted time. To earn a Marine Corps Pistol Qualification Badge, a Marine must successfully complete four phases of fire which include weapons handling, operator maintenance, stationary target engagement, and scenario based target engagements. Similar to the rifle tables, the pistol phases require a Marine to engage human silhouettes at varying distances and scenarios within an allotted time. After qualifying, a Marine will receive a marksmanship badge commensurate with the score they obtained. For annual qualification with the service rifle, scores range from 305 to 350 for expert, 280–304 for sharpshooter, and 250–279 for marksman. For annual qualification with the service pistol, the scores range from 364 to 400 for expert, 324–363 for sharpshooter, and 264–323 for marksman.

U.S. Marine Corps Marksmanship Qualification Badges may be worn on U.S. Marine Corps dress and service uniforms for the remainder of a Marine&#x27;s military career, or until a different level of qualification (higher or lower) is achieved. Typically, all Marines qualify with the rifle on an annual basis. The most recent qualification score determines the badge that is worn. If a Marine achieves the qualification of expert multiple times, a clasp is hung between the brooch and the pendant of the appropriate badge denoting the number of subsequent awards.

====Former Marine Corps qualification badges====

According to the Marine Corps History Division, the Marine Corps used to award three different styles/types of marksmanship qualification badges. Starting in 1912, the Marine Corps began awarding the Army Rifle Marksmanship Badges to Marines who qualified with the service rifle. As with the U.S. Army, the Marine Corps awarded these rifle badges at three qualification levels (highest to lowest): expert, sharpshooter, and marksman. Just like the U.S. Army, year clasps were added to the Expert Rifle Marksmanship Badge and Sharpshooter Rifle Marksmanship Badge to indicate the year(s) a Marine requalified at that level. The former Army Expert Rifle Marksmanship Badge is almost identical to the current version of the Marine Corps Expert Rifle Qualification Badge, but uses crossed M1903 Springfield Rifles vs. M1 Garands with slings. In 1924, the Marine Corps replaced these badges with the Army Marksmanship Qualification Badges, which are still in use by the U.S. Army. However, the Marine Corps decided to bring back the older Army Rifle Marksmanship Badges in 1937. That same year, the Marine Corps introduced the Marine Corps Basic Badge for marksmanship qualifications with other weapon systems. Clasps were hung from the Marine Corps Basic Badge&#x27;s brooch indicating the type of weapon and level of qualification. The clasps indicated the degree of proficiency by using the letters &quot;SS&quot; for sharpshooter or &quot;EX&quot; for expert, followed by the name of the weapon. The exception to this rule was a U.S. Marine Corps Reserve clasps for the .30 Caliber Rifle Course D (&quot;RIFLE-D&quot;) which included &quot;MM&quot; for marksman. Much like the Army Weapon Qualification Clasps, the clasps of the Marine Corps Basic Badge fluctuated with additions and deletions in 1949 and again in 1954. The following clasps were authorized for wear on the Marine Corps Basic Badge under the 1937 Marine Corps Uniform Regulation:

The Army Rifle Marksmanship Badges were replaced by the current Marine Corps Rifle Marksmanship Qualification Badges in 1958. That same year, the U.S. Marine Corps adopted the U.S. Army&#x27;s 1915 design of the Army Expert Pistol Qualification Badge and created its own Marine Corps Pistol Qualification Badges, which is still in use today. The Marine Corps Basic Badge remained in use until 1968 when it was declared obsolete.

===U.S. Navy (historical)===

For a decade, from 1910 to 1920, the U.S. Navy awarded a marksmanship badge, called the Navy Sharpshooter&#x27;s Badge, to sailors who qualified with the service rifle and/or service pistol. Today, sailors are awarded marksmanship ribbons and medals to denote service weapon qualification.

The Navy Sharpshooter&#x27;s Badge was awarded at two qualification levels, expert (highest qualification level) and sharpshooter. Despite this, the 1913 Uniform Regulations for the U.S. Navy stated that the Navy Sharpshooter&#x27;s Badge outranked all other marksmanship badges on the U.S. Navy uniform, including marksmanship competition badges.

The Navy Sharpshooter&#x27;s Badge was made of antique bronze with a rectangular brooch that had the word &quot;SHARPSHOOTER&quot; embossed in its center with circling serpent bookends. Below the brooch hung two types of clasps, an Expert Qualification Clasp and a Qualification Year Clasp. From those clasps hung the badge&#x27;s pendant. The Expert Qualification Clasp is identical in design to the brooch but with the word(s) &quot;EXPERT,&quot; for the service rifle, or &quot;EXPERT PISTOL SHOT,&quot; for the service pistol. Each time a shooter requalified as expert, another Expert Qualification Clasp was hung from the badge. If no Expert Qualification Clasp was suspended from the badge, then the shooter qualified as a sharpshooter with the service rifle and/or service pistol. The Qualification Year Clasp is different in design from the brooch which incorporated three ovals along its length for the placement of Year Disks. The Year Disk was made of silver and embossed with the year the shooter qualified/requalified. On the fourth requalification year, another Qualification Year Clasp was hung from the badge with a fourth Year Disk embossed with the year of requalification. There was no limit to the number of clasps that could be hung from the badge. Hanging from the clasp(s) was the badge&#x27;s pendant, which was the design basis for today&#x27;s U.S. Navy marksmanship medals. The only difference between the pendant of the Navy Sharpshooter&#x27;s Badge and the Navy Expert Rifleman Medal or Expert Pistol Shot Medal is the metal color (from antique bronze to gold), the deletion of the crossed rifles from behind a replica of a rifle target, and the addition of the words &quot;EXPERT RIFLEMAN&quot; or &quot;EXPERT PISTOL SHOT&quot; embossed above the rifle target.

Starting in 1920, U.S. Navy marksmanship ribbons replaced the Navy Sharpshooter&#x27;s Badge. There are two types of U.S. Navy marksmanship ribbons, one for the service rifle ( ) and one for the service pistol ( ). Each can be embellished with a marksmanship device to denote the shooter&#x27;s qualification level. A silver &quot;E&quot; Device ( ) is awarded to those who qualify as an expert (the highest qualification level) while a bronze &quot;S&quot; Device ( ) is awarded to those who qualify as a sharpshooter (second highest qualification). If no marksmanship device is displayed, the shooter qualified as a marksman (lowest qualification level). For an unknown period of time, a bronze &quot;E&quot; Device was awarded to those who initially qualified as expert; after three consecutive expert qualifications, the device turned to silver with a permanent award status. Starting in 1969, the Expert Rifleman Medal and Expert Pistol Shot Medal were introduced and are awarded to sailors who qualify as expert along with the appropriate U.S. Navy marksmanship ribbon with silver &quot;E&quot; Device. Sailors who qualify on a small arms qualification course with another military service may wear the appropriate Navy ribbon or medal corresponding to that service qualification.
===Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps===

The Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (JROTC) and the CMP have established a JROTC Rifle Marksmanship Training and Award Program to increase a cadet&#x27;s knowledge and skill in handling rifles safely and proficiently. JROTC cadets who participate in rifle marksmanship training are eligible to earn a JROTC Rifle Qualification Badge, representative of one of three qualification levels (in ascending order): Marksman, Sharpshooter, and Expert. These badges signify that the cadets who wear them, have demonstrated the knowledge and skill necessary to handle rifles safely, and to achieve their required scores in the relevant qualification firing tests.

The CMP have set standards that apply to the conduct of weapon qualification events. All qualification events must be done with sporter-class air rifles, such as the Daisy M853/9753/953 pneumatic rifles or Daisy M887/888 rifles, that were awarded through the military supply system. Qualification tests must be conducted at a distance of ten meters (33 feet). Qualification tests may be done on either the basic marksmanship course (BMC) targets or AR-1 competition targets. During qualification tests, a sling, glove, and kneeling roll may be used. To receive a qualification badge, cadets must attain the following scores that is supervised or observed by a qualified instructor:
*Expert: 220-300 (AR-1 Target), 290-300 (BMC Target)
**10 shots standing, 10 shots prone, and 10 shots kneeling
*Sharpshooter: 130-200 (AR-1 Target), 188-200 (BMC Target)
**10 shots standing, 10 shots prone
*Marksman: 110-129 (AR-1 Target), 175-187 (BMC Target)
**10 shots standing, 10 shots prone

JROTC cadets are authorized to wear the JROTC Air Rifle Marksmanship Qualification Badge, as well as other CMP or NRA awarded badges, on their service uniforms. Cadets may earn more than one badge, but may only wear the highest-ranking badge earned for a given weapon.

===U.S. law enforcement===
Each U.S. law enforcement organization, such as the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), New York City Police Department (NYPD), have established various law enforcement marksmanship qualification badges for their officers to highlight their proficiency with their service firearms and encourage their peers to strive for excellence with their sidearm.
Some organizations, such as the LAPD, follow the NRA&#x27;s marksmanship guidelines and award unique LAPD Marksmanship Badges to their officers at four distinct levels: (from lowest to highest) Marksman, Sharpshooter, Expert, and Distinguished Expert. To earn the LAPD Marksman Marksmanship Badge, an officer must score 300–339 out of 400 points at the voluntary bonus qualification shoot. For the LAPD Sharpshooter Marksmanship Badge, an officer must score 340–379 and 380–400 for the LAPD Expert Marksmanship Badge. To earn the LAPD Distinguished Expert Marksmanship Badge, an officer must score 2,310 out of 2,400 points in a consecutive six‑month period.
Other organizations, such as the NYPD, award only two marksmanship badges, known as the NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bars, to their officers who certify or recertify as either a (lowest to highest) Pistol Shot or Pistol Expert with their service weapon.
The NRA&#x27;s Explorer Service Handgun Qualification Program is designed exclusively for the Law Enforcement Exploring program and is used as a development tool to help potential law enforcement officers (called Explorers) establish safe shooting habits and increase their shooting proficiency with a handgun. Performance is measured against established par scores and any Explorer who meets or exceeds those scores can be awarded the appropriate badge by the law enforcement post to which the Explorer belongs. These Explorer Service Handgun Qualification Bars are awarded in five levels (lowest to highest): pro-marksman, marksman, sharpshooter, expert, and distinguished expert.

Prior to participating in NRA&#x27;s Explorer Service Handgun Qualification Program, Explorer&#x27;s are required to complete an eight-hour firearm safety course. Only a law enforcement service handgun, authorized by the sponsoring law enforcement agency, is to be used against standard NRA B-8 targets. The courses of fire are conducted from either a benchrest or standing position, from ranges of 5 to 25 yards, with 20 to 30 shots, and has 2 or 3 phases of fire (slow fire, timed fire, and rapid fire). A course of fire must be completed in the same session and must be witnessed by the range supervisor or the officer-in-charge of the law enforcement explorer post in order to qualify. The following courses of fire must be achieved to be awarded the corresponding Explorer Service Handgun Qualification Badge:
*Pro-Marksman: From a benchrest, achieve a 50% hit count in slow fire against five and seven yard targets
*Marksman: From a standing position, achieve a 60% hit count in slow fire and 50% hit count in timed fire against a seven-yard target
*Sharpshooter: From a standing position, achieve a 75% hit count in slow fire, 65% hit count in timed fire, and 50% hit count in rapid fire against a 15-yard target
*Expert: From a standing position, achieve an 85% hit count in slow fire, 75% hit count in timed fire, and 65% hit count in rapid fire against a 20-yard target
*Distinguished Expert: Aggregate course of fire shot five times with a score of 201/300 or better in each aggregate.

These Explorer Service Handgun Qualification Badges are authorized for wear on the Law Enforcement Explorer uniform.

===U.S. civilians===
Although the CMP awards Army Marksmanship Qualification Badges to qualified U.S. civilians, there are different organizations throughout the U.S. that have established marksmanship programs and awards to encourage marksmanship amongst their members. The NRA is one organization that has national level programs that are recognized and used by various U.S. entities. One such program is the Winchester/NRA Marksmanship Qualification Program which is designed to encourage firearms safety and develop civilian marksmanship through the awarding of Winchester/NRA Marksmanship Qualification Badges. The program is also designed to help marksmanship instructors and coaches train their shooters through a published set of guidelines that apply to both juniors and adults. Despite its similarities, the NRA&#x27;s marksmanship program does not compete with the CMP. The NRA awards marksmanship qualification badges for air rifle, light rifle, rifle, high-power rifle, air pistol, pistol, and shotgun. Performance is measured against established par scores and any shooters who meet or exceed those scores are entitled to a corresponding marksmanship qualification badge. The courses of fire in the qualification program are designed to take shooters from beginning skill levels (pro-marksman and marksman) through intermediate levels (marksman first-class, sharpshooter, and expert) up to a nationally recognized skill level (distinguished expert). Qualification tests can be conducted anywhere and is based on the honor system. However, to earn the NRA Distinguished Expert Badge, an NRA Certified Instructor or Coach must witness and officially record the course of fire. Those who participate in formal competition can use the tournament results bulletin as validation for the NRA Distinguished Expert Badge. Each skill level requires that a shooter achieve a score more than once to earn a specific marksmanship qualification badge. However, they do not have to be fired consecutively or in the same session.

When the shooter reaches marksman first-class, a rectangular clasp embossed with the words &quot;FIRST CLASS&quot; is added to the NRA Marksman Badge, suspended between the brooch and the pendant. When the shooter reaches sharpshooter, the shooter will begin to earn gold rectangular clasps that represent different courses of fire that are suspended between the brooch and the pendant of the NRA Sharpshooter Badge. Between one and nine small black vertical rectangles are etched onto the gold clasps representing a specific course of fire successfully completed by the shooter. Likewise, the NRA Distinguished Expert Badge uses gold rectangular weapon clasps which are suspended in the same manner as the marksman first-class and sharpshooter clasps to identify the type of firearm for which the badge has been earned. Each firearm clasp is black with raised gold trim; in the center of the clasps are raised gold capital letters spelling rifle, shotgun, or pistol. If the shooter has earned the NRA Distinguished Expert Badge for more than one type of firearm, multiple clasps denoting each firearm are suspended between the badge&#x27;s brooch and its pendant.

====History of the Winchester/NRA badges====
The Winchester/NRA Marksmanship Qualification Program was established in 1926 when the Winchester Junior Rifle Corps and the NRA Junior Marksmanship Program were combined. American youth remained the target audience focusing on firearm safety and marksmanship. The newly combined program used the original Winchester Junior Rifle Corps qualification levels until 2002 when the NRA added the marksman first-class qualification, increasing the number of qualification levels to six. In the early 21st century, the pendant of the original NRA marksmanship qualification badges changed from a circular wreathed pendant to a unique shield design with the words &quot;Junior Division&quot; removed from the pendant; the same was done with the original design of the NRA Distinguished Expert Badge but both the brooch and pendant were completely redesigned. These changes likely occurred when the NRA revamped the Winchester/NRA Marksmanship Qualification Program to be more inclusive; the program now includes 11 different courses of fire for both youths and adults.

==Marksmanship competition badges==

The 1996 U.S. federal law established the CPRPFS with the authority to promote practice and safety in the use of firearms through the conduct of competitions and the awarding of prizes, trophies, badges, and other insignia to high performing competitors, which it carries out through the CMP. This authorization carries with it the responsibility to administer the CPRPFS&#x27;s distinguished marksmanship programs. The CMP maintains records of points earned by shooters and presents appropriate prizes to those who earn them while the U.S. armed forces award service specific competition marksmanship badges to serviceman based on the CMP&#x27;s records for points earned.

The CMP has a point system that competitors use to work their way towards &quot;distinguished status.&quot; Starting in 2015, the CMP began awarding achievement pins based on the score one earns at a given match. For example, to earn a bronze, silver, or gold CMP .22 Rimfire Pistol Achievement Pin, one must achieve a score of 235–249, 250–264, or 265+ respectively in the authorized excellence category of competition. Also in 2015, the CMP established minimum cut scores that must be achieved for a given weapon in the authorized excellence category of competition before one can earn credit points (also referred to as &quot;leg points&quot;) towards a distinguished marksmanship badge. Once the minimum cut score has been achieved or exceeded (260-300 for .22 rimfire pistol, 250-300 for service pistol, and 455-500 for service rifle), the shooter becomes eligible to earn leg points. The number of leg points that can be earned are based on the number of competitors, one&#x27;s score, one&#x27;s ranking, and you must fall within the top 10% of all match shooters regardless of your minimum cut score. Typically, the highest one-sixth of the top 10% earn ten leg points, the next highest two-sixths earn eight, and the remaining three-sixths earn six. Depending on the awarding organization, competitors must earn between one and six leg points to be awarded their first excellence-in-competition (EIC) badge. Everyone must earn at least 30 leg points to reach &quot;distinguished status&quot; and be awarded one of the distinguished marksmanship badges. Leg points accumulate throughout a competitor&#x27;s lifetime until &quot;distinguished status&quot; is attained. Thus, leg points earned as a member of the U.S. armed forces will transfer toward &quot;distinguished status&quot; as a civilian, and vice versa.

Similarly, the NRA has like programs which use similar ranking systems as the CPRPFS&#x27;s distinguished marksmanship programs where a shooter must work their way up to &quot;distinguished status&quot; by demonstrating repeated excellence in marksmanship. The NRA&#x27;s distinguished marksmanship programs focus on areas not covered by the CPRPF. However, the NRA&#x27;s newest program, the NRA Distinguished Air Gun Program, is in competition with the CPRPFS&#x27;s Junior Distinguished Program as they both focus on air gun proficiency among American youth.

In addition to the CMP&#x27;s leg point driven system of marksmanship awards, the U.S. military and certain states award marksmanship tabs, brassards, and badges for high placement in official marksmanship competitions, such as the President&#x27;s Pistol and Rifle Matches, the National Guard Small Arms Championships, the Army Interservice Competition Badges, the U.S. Marine Corps&#x27;s trophy matches, and some state marksmanship competitions, just to name a few.

===Distinguished marksmanship programs===
====EIC badges====

The U.S. armed forces award EIC badges to their members based on the CMP&#x27;s records of leg points earned at a rifle and/or pistol match and in accordance with that member&#x27;s service regulation(s). For example, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps awards their Bronze EIC Badges when a sailor/Marine earns six leg points when competing in an authorized excellence category of competition, their Silver EIC Badges when eight leg points have been earned, and their Gold EIC Badges when ten leg points are earned. The U.S. Army and U.S. Coast Guard award their Bronze EIC Badges when a soldier/Coast Guardsman earns their first leg points when competing in an authorized excellence category of competition. However, the Army Silver EIC Badges and Coast Guard Silver EIC Badges are awarded differently; the U.S. Army will award their Silver EIC Badges when 20 leg points have been earned and the U.S. Coast Guard will award their Silver EIC Badges when a Coast Guardsman has earned their second set of leg points regardless of the number of points earned. The U.S. Air Force awards Bronze EIC Badges (without wreath) to airman who rank in the top 10% of competitors at a U.S. Air Force-approved competition; these competitions do not have to be CMP sanctioned. The Air Force Bronze EIC Badges with Wreath are awarded when six leg points have been earned in an authorized excellence category of competition and their Silver EIC Badges with Wreath when 20 leg points have been earned.

Within the armed forces, there are three levels of EIC competition, installation or unit level competitions (level 1), region or command level competitions (level 2), and service, interservice, or national competitions (level 3). All five of the military services have uniquely designed EIC badges that are awarded to their members. EIC badges awarded at these different levels of competition are the same with a few exceptions. For EIC badges awarded at national competitions, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard emboss the word &quot;NATIONAL&quot; at the top or bottom of their EIC badges respectively to distinguish them from other U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard EIC badges. Also, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps award slightly modified EIC badges at U.S. Navy Fleet or U.S. Marine Corps Division level (level 1) EIC matches. For example, U.S. Navy emboss the word &quot;FLEET&quot; at the top of their U.S. Navy EIC badges while the eagle, globe, and anchor on the Marine Corps EIC badges are replaced with the word &quot;DIVISION&quot; to distinguish these EIC badges from those earned and higher level competitions.
Just like the U.S. armed forces, the NRA has an EIC badge which is awarded to law enforcement officers that have earned their first leg point(s) toward NRA&#x27;s &quot;distinguished status&quot; with the revolver or semi-automatic pistol. Law enforcement officers can only earn these leg points during NRA police pistol combat tournaments or during the NRA National Police Shooting Championship. Since the NRA Law Enforcement EIC Badge is awarded at only one level (silver), letters are presented to competitors indicating the total number of leg points they have earned as they work towards &quot;distinguished status.&quot;

The CMP&#x27;s civilian EIC badges are awarded to adult civilian competitors who achieve sufficient points in a CMP authorized excellence category of rifle and/or pistol competition. The CMP&#x27;s bronze EIC badges are awarded with six leg points have been earned and the CMP&#x27;s silver EIC badges are awarded when 20 leg points have been achieved. The CPRPFS&#x27;s Junior Air Rifle Program leg point system is identical to its rifle and pistol program; however the CMP will award their bronze Junior EIC Air Rifle Badge when junior competitors earn three leg points when competing in an authorized excellence category of competition and their silver Junior EIC Air Rifle Badge when 15 leg points have been earned.

The following is a list of current EIC badges that are awarded by the CMP and the U.S. armed forces to their members; these EIC badges are listed in order of precedence by organization:

These badges are onetime decorations and the military EIC badges may be worn on U.S. armed forces&#x27; service uniforms for the remainder of an individual&#x27;s career. These badges may be worn simultaneously with the U.S. Army&#x27;s and U.S. Marine Corps&#x27;s Marksmanship qualification badges, and other authorized marksmanship competition badges, on service uniforms not to exceed a total of three badges. The U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps authorize the wearing of up to two EIC badges for a given weapon while the other military services authorize the wearing of only the highest ranking EIC badge for a given weapon on their service uniforms. Subdued versions of these badges are not authorized. With the exception of the U.S. Coast Guard, miniature versions of these badges are also not authorized. The U.S. Coast Guard has authorized the wear of special marksmanship devices on top of their marksmanship ribbons ( ) to denote the awarding of an EIC badge and is used when wearing the badge is not desired.

=====Changes in EIC badge design=====

From 1903 to 1958, the U.S. Army EIC badges were known as Team Marksmanship Badges. Prior to that, the Army awarded a variety of large unique marksmanship prize badges that went by a variety of names from 1880 to 1903. The original Team Marksmanship Badges were awarded in gold, silver, and bronze consisting of oval pendants with enameled targets in the center that were superimposed over crossed rifles with bayonets, crossed carbines with slings, a heavy machine gun, or placed between two revolvers. Above the enameled target was the letters &quot;U.S.&quot;; but for a short time, the word &quot;INFANTRY&quot; or &quot;CAVALRY&quot; (unit dependent) appeared above the target while the letters U.S. were embossed beneath the target. The pendant hung from two different brooch designs. From 1903 to 1906 the brooch had rounded arrowhead ends (seen today in the U.S. Marine Corps&#x27;s EIC badges) bearing the name &quot;ARMY,&quot; &quot;DEPARTMENT,&quot; or &quot;DIVISION&quot; reflecting the level of competition for which the badge was earned. In 1906 the brooch was redesigned with swallow-tail ends bearing the name of the Army corps marksmanship team flanked by the words &quot;ARMY,&quot; on the left, and &quot;TEAM,&quot; on the right. In 1923, the Army updated the Team Marksmanship Badges with a new three piece design which was awarded in three grades; gold, silver, and bronze for pistol, rifle, and automatic rifle. There were four components to this new badge; the brooch, clasp, Team Disk, and pendant. A plain brooch with a circular center device was used to identify an Army corps or department level award. A wreath laden brooch was used to identify a national or Army level award. A gold, silver, or bronze (score dependent) replica of either crossed Flintlock Pistols, Muskets, or M1918 Browning Automatic Rifles (BARs) hung from the brooch which supported the badge&#x27;s bronze pendant. The pendant had a bow with two crossed arrows at its center surrounded by a ring of 13 stars which was encircled by an oak wreath. For national and Army level awards, an enameled ring, known as the Team Disk, was placed behind the pendant&#x27;s ring of 13 stars and was colored to match the branch of service color of the awarded team. Today&#x27;s Army EIC badges, which began in 1958, are almost identical to the Team Marksmanship Badges with the following exceptions: only one version of the brooch exists and bears the name &quot;U.S. ARMY;&quot; the crossed BARs, Team Disks, and gold version of the crossed weapons have been deleted. Also, the entire EIC badge is now cast in either bronze or silver, vise having just the crossed weapons being cast in the medal earned by the shooter.
When the U.S. Marine Corps authorized their first Marine Corps marksmanship competition badges in 1908, they used the pendant of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 1907 designed Team Marksmanship Badges; however, the Marines used a unique brooch that had the name &quot;MARINE CORPS&quot; etch within it to help set it apart from the U.S. Army&#x27;s 1907 version. Slowly, the Marine Corps&#x27;s marksmanship competition badges took on their own distinctive characteristics. Between 1910 and 1930, the pendants started to be modified with the word &quot;DIVISION&quot; or the eagle, globe, and anchor replacing the letters &quot;U.S.&quot; to signify winners of unit or service/national level competitions respectively. These marksmanship competition badges live on as the Marine Corps&#x27;s EIC badges.

The U.S. Air Force used to award Silver and Gold Elementary EIC Rifle and Pistol Badges and Gold National EIC Rifle and Pistol Badges to its competition shooters. The EIC badges without wreaths were originally known as `non-national EIC badges&#x27; while those with wreaths were known as `national EIC badges&#x27;. With changes in U.S. Air Force instructions (AFI), the term non-national was replaced with elementary. In today&#x27;s AFI, the elementary EIC badges are formally known as Bronze EIC Badges while the national EIC badges are formally known as either Bronze or Silver EIC Badges with Wreath. However, U.S. Air Force competitors still refer to these badges using their old designations (Elementary and National).

====Distinguished marksmanship badges====

In 1884, the United States Secretary of War authorized the establishment of the &quot;distinguished class&quot; of marksman. In 1887, the Secretary authorized the first Distinguished Marksman Badge to recognize the shooters who achieved this distinguished class of marksman with the rifle, carbine, revolver, or any combination of the three. This continued until the establishment of the Distinguished Pistol Shot Badge in 1903 and the Distinguished Rifleman Badge in 1959. However, the Distinguished Marksman Badge is still awarded to distinguished rifle shooters of the sea services (U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard). These two badges were the U.S. armed forces&#x27; highest awards for rifle and pistol marksmanship until 1962 when the CMP established the Distinguished International Shooter Badge. In 2001, the Junior Distinguished Badge was established for junior air rifle competitors while the CMP&#x27;s newest distinguished program, the .22 Rimfire Pistol Distinguished Badge (authorized in 2015), has been established for adult and junior shooters alike. Today, the Distinguished International Shooter Badge is the highest award for marksmanship within the U.S. followed by the Distinguished Rifleman/Marksman Badge, the Distinguished Pistol Shot Badge, the .22 Rimfire Pistol Distinguished Badge, and the Junior Distinguished Badge.

As with all distinguished badges, a shooter must earn 30 leg points to be awarded the Distinguished International Shooter Badge. However the means by which one earns these leg points is very different. International leg points are awarded based on a shooter&#x27;s placement at international marksmanship competitions; specifically the Olympic Games, the World Championships, the World Clay Target Championships, the World Cup Finals, the World Cup, the Pan American Games, the Championship of the Americas, the World Junior Championships, and the Americas Junior Championships. Depending on where a shooter places in these games, individually or as a team, will dictate the number of international leg points earned.

The Distinguished International Shooter Badge consists of a gold brooch that is 1.8 inches in length inscribed with the words &quot;United States;&quot; perched above the words is a small modified shield from the Great Seal of the United States flanked by oak leaves. The pendant that hangs from this brooch is a gold disk 1.5 inches in diameter with a relief of the Earth, centered on the Western Hemisphere. Laurel leaves inscribed with the words &quot;Distinguished International Shooter&quot; surround the globe.

Each of the U.S. armed forces&#x27; and the CMP&#x27;s distinguished Rifleman/Marksman and Pistol Shot Badges hangs from a service specific brooch. As with the Distinguished International Shooter Badge, the civilian brooch incorporates a modified shield from the Great Seal of the United States but has the letters &quot;US&quot; embossed on its face. The U.S. Army&#x27;s brooch also incorporates this modified shield but has it perched above the words &quot;U.S. ARMY&quot; in the same manner as the Distinguished International Shooter Badge. The other military services have a plain rectangular brooch embossed with the name of their service. The rifle badge pendant of the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, and civilians is a gold shield inches in height and 1 13/32 inches in width, in the center of which is an enameled replica of a rifle target. Around the target are the words &quot;DISTINGUISHED&quot; and &quot;RIFLEMAN,&quot; which is arched above and stretched below the target respectively. The sea service&#x27;s pendant displays the word &quot;MARKSMAN&quot; vs. RIFLEMAN underneath the target. The pistol badge pendant is similar in design to the rifle pendant but is inches in height and 1 3/64 inches in width and has the words &quot;PISTOL SHOT&quot; stretched below an enameled replica of a pistol target. The exception to this rule is the Air Force Distinguished Pistol Shot pendant, which is identical to the rifle badge pendant but with the words &quot;PISTOL SHOT&quot; stretched under the enameled replica of a rifle target. This larger pistol pendant was also awarded to U.S. Coast Guard shooters between 1993 and 1996, but was rescinded in favor of the more traditional pistol pendant.

These badges are onetime decorations and may be worn on U.S. Armed Forces&#x27; service uniforms for the remainder of an individual&#x27;s career. These badges may be worn simultaneously with the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps marksmanship qualification badges as well as other authorized marksmanship competition badges not to exceed a total of three badges. However once a Distinguished Rifleman/Marksman or Pistol Shot Badge has been awarded, the EIC badge for that weapon is no longer worn on military service uniforms. Subdued versions of these badges are not authorized. With the exception of the U.S. Coast Guard, miniature versions of these badges are also not authorized. The U.S. Coast Guard has authorized the wear of special marksmanship devices on top of their marksmanship ribbons ( ) to denote the awarding of a Distinguished Marksman or Pistol Shot Badge and is used when wearing of badges is not desired.
The NRA&#x27;s Distinguished Smallbore Rifleman Badge (Prone) and Distinguished Smallbore Rifleman Badge (Position) were established in 1965 while the Double Distinguished Smallbore Rifleman Badge was established in 2009. The distinguished smallbore awards are considered more difficult to earn than the CMP&#x27;s equivalent badge because shooters who have already achieved NRA&#x27;s &quot;distinguished status&quot; are allowed to compete against those that have not yet achieved the award, thus raising the bar for the would-be smallbore distinguished rifleman. Four step certificates must be earned in order to be awarded one of these badges. A step certificate is earned by placing in the top ten percent at an Open Regional or National Championship, and only two step certificates per year will count towards &quot;distinguished status.&quot; At least one step must be earned at the National Outdoor Championship. Therefore, it takes a minimum of two years to earn one of the distinguished smallbore rifleman badges.

NRA&#x27;s newest distinguished program is their Distinguished Air Gun Program which was established in 2010. This program mirrors the NRA Distinguished Smallbore Rifle Program where four step certificates must be earned in order to be awarded the Three Position Precision Air Rifle Badge or the Three Position Sporter Air Rifle Badge. The Double Distinguished Air Rifle Badge is awarded when a shooter has earned four step certificates in both precision and sporter matches.
The NRA established the Law Enforcement Distinguished Marksmanship Program in 1973 with the introduction of the Law Enforcement Distinguished Revolver Badge. In 1990, the NRA amended the program by introducing the Law Enforcement Distinguished Semi-Automatic Pistol Badge. The Distinguished Action Pistol Badge and Conventional Pistol Distinguished Badge were established for U.S. civilian competitors in 1985 and 2005 respectively. Just like the CPRPFS programs, a 30 leg point system is used to earn these NRA distinguished badges and similar rules apply for how leg points are earned.
=====Former distinguished badges=====

According to articles from American Rifleman Magazine and the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Firing Regulations for Small Arms from the early 1900s, the U.S. Navy use to award a Navy Expert Team Rifleman Badge to U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps personnel who qualified as expert rifleman numerous times and excelled in official rifle marksmanship competitions. The badge was designed &quot;to encourage team competitions and to distinguish a class of officers and men who have shown superior skill in team competitions.&quot; To earn the Expert Team Rifleman Badge, a shooter must have qualified as expert with the service rifle four times and have high placement at three official rifle marksmanship competitions. In the U.S. Marine Corps&#x27;s uniform regulation of 1922, the Navy Expert Team Rifleman Badge ranked between the Distinguished Marksman Badge and the Distinguished Pistol Shot Badge in precedence. It is not known when this badge was retired, but the badge did appear in the October 1943 edition of National Geographic Magazine, suggesting it was still an authorized decoration during World War II.

From 1930 through the late 1940s, the U.S. Army awarded the Distinguished Automatic Rifleman Badge to those who had earned the U.S. Army&#x27;s Team Marksmanship Badge for BAR with sufficient points to qualify for &quot;distinguished status.&quot; When marksmanship competitions resumed after World War II, the U.S. Army limited competitions to the rifle and pistol. Thus, the Distinguished Automatic Rifleman Badge was retired, along with the U.S. Army&#x27;s Automatic Rifle Team Marksmanship Badge.
===Competition ranking badges===
====President&#x27;s Hundred Tab and Brassard====
The President&#x27;s Hundred Tab and/or Brassard are presented to the 100 top-scoring U.S. military and U.S. civilian shooters at the President&#x27;s Pistol Match and President&#x27;s Rifle Match. The President&#x27;s hundred award started in 1878 by the NRA at the American Military Rifle Championship Match, which was patterned after an event for British volunteers called The Queen&#x27;s Match. In 1977, the event was turned over to the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice, which later became the CPRPFS, and is managed by the CMP. All U.S. military and U.S. civilian personnel who earn this award are presented with a bronze metallic President&#x27;s Hundred Brassard. However, only the U.S. Navy has authorized the wear of the metallic brassard, on the upper-left sleeve of enlisted service uniforms, as a permanent award. A cloth tab, with the words &quot;President&#x27;s Hundred,&quot; is worn by soldiers, airmen, and enlisted Coast Guardsman who have earned the brassard. An olive-drab version of the tab is worn on the upper-left sleeve of the U.S. Army combat uniform and airman battle uniform while a black and white version of the tab is worn on the upper-left sleeve of U.S. Coast Guard enlisted uniforms as a permanent award. A smaller gold metal replica of the tab, with green lettering, is worn on the left breast of the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force service uniforms above or below ribbons and above medals.
====U.S. Marine Corps specific competition badges====

When the U.S. Marine Corps began its marksmanship qualification program in the early 20th century, it also establish a marksmanship competition program to help further advance the skills of its expert shooters. In the summer of 1908, the U.S. Marine Corps instituted the Distinguished Marksman Badge to recognition winners at the national marksmanship matches. That same year, the Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps authorized the first U.S. Marine Corps-wide match by providing for four division matches. As a result of these early matches, the U.S. Marine Corps began to award competition specific marksmanship badges. Today, these badges are awarded alongside trophies and other prizes that are presented to the top performing Marines at U.S. Marine Corps competitions. The following are U.S. Marine Corps competition badges not associated with the CMP:
* Lauchheimer Trophy Badges (Gold, Silver, and Bronze)
* Marine Corps Rifle Championship Badge (McDougal Trophy)
* Marine Corps Pistol Championship Badge (Walsh Trophy)
* Inter-Division Rifle Competition Badge
* Inter-Division Pistol Competition Badge
* Fleet Marine Force (FMF) Combat Infantry Trophy Match Badge
* Annual Rifle Squad Combat Practice Competition Badges (Gold, Silver, and Bronze)
* Rifle Team Match Badges (San Diego, Wharton, Elliott, Wirgman, Lloyd, and Smith Trophies)
* Pistol Team Match Badges (Holcomb, Edson, Shively, and Pacific Trophies)

Of the 24 Marine Corps competition badges (not counting metal color/level), seven are part of the CMP while the 17 listed above are awarded for high placement at Marine Corps specific competitions. Of those 17 badges, one is truly unique as it is not solely focused on marksmanship but on a Marine Corps rifle squad&#x27;s proficiency by demonstrating their capability for employment in combat. The Annual Rifle Squad Combat Practice Competition Badge is awarded to the top performing rifle squads within each Marine Corps infantry regiment or division. Each rifle squad is evaluated on their offensive tactics, defensive tactics, patrolling, marksmanship, and physical fitness. Each rifle squad can be accompanied by a U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman, making this badge awardable to U.S. Navy personnel.

These badges are onetime decorations and may be worn on service uniforms for the remainder of a Marine&#x27;s or sailor&#x27;s military career. These badges may be worn simultaneously with Marine Corps marksmanship qualification badges as well as other authorized marksmanship competition badges not to exceed a total of three badges. Subdued and miniature versions are not authorized.
====U.S. Army Interservice Competition Badges====

Unlike the other marksmanship competition badges, unique Army Interservice Competition Badges are awarded to soldiers and U.S. Army marksmanship teams that place in the top three positions of an interservice match. These badges are separate awards from the CPRPFS&#x27;s distinguished marksmanship programs, where a competitor earns leg points towards &quot;distinguished status.&quot; The pentagon shaped multicolored pendant centerpiece of the Army Interservice Competition Badge incorporates the emblems of the five military services which surround a modified shield from the Great Seal of the United States flanked by gold stars on a white enameled background. This pendent centerpiece is placed in a pentagon shaped decorative metal frame. This elaborate two piece pendant hangs from an equally elaborate brooch made of the same metal as the pendant&#x27;s frame and bears the name of the event (in the top arch), the match (in the bottom bar), and the competitor&#x27;s or team&#x27;s ranking at that match (in the center half-circle). The brooch, the pendant&#x27;s frame, and each of the service&#x27;s emblems are cast in either gold (for 1st place), silver (for 2nd place), or bronze (for 3rd place).

The Army Interservice Competition Badges are onetime decorations and may be worn on U.S. Army service uniforms for the remainder of a soldier&#x27;s military career. These badges may be worn simultaneously with the Army Marksmanship Qualification Badges as well as other authorized marksmanship competition badges not to exceed a total of three badges. However, only one Army Interservice Competition Badge can be worn at a time. Subdued and miniature versions are not authorized.
====U.S. National Guard/state competition badges====

Once a year, thousands of U.S. Army and U.S. Air National Guard shooters (champion marksmanship teams from each state) compete against each other at the Winston P. Wilson Rifle and Pistol Championships (a.k.a. the National Guard Small Arms Championships or the WPW Matches), held at the National Guard Marksmanship Training Center at Camp Joseph T. Robinson, Arkansas. Guardsman compete as teams and/or individuals with combat rifles, combat pistols, machine guns, and sniper rifles for top honors within the National Guard. At the conclusion of the WPW Matches, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau awards the Chief&#x27;s Fifty Marksmanship Badge to the top twenty-one combat rifle, top twenty-one combat pistol, top two machine gun teams, and top two sniper teams.

The Chief&#x27;s Fifty Marksmanship Badge is a gold-plated circular medal, 1 1/8th inches in diameter suspended from a gold-plated multi-tiered rectangular brooch embossed with the words &quot;NATIONAL GUARD.&quot; The medal is embossed with the words &quot;Winston P. Wilson Rifle and Pistol Championships,&quot; the National Guard Bureau Branch Insignia, and the Minuteman on its face. At the base of the medal is a gold scroll embossed with the words &quot;CHIEF&quot;S 50.&quot; The Chief&#x27;s Fifty Marksmanship Badge was made official in 1978 and made retroactive to 1971.

Guardsmen are authorized to wear the Chief&#x27;s Fifty Marksmanship Badge as a permanent decoration on service uniforms, to the left of federal marksmanship badges and awards, when operating under Title 32 (state control) status. When federalized (Title 10), Guardsman cannot wear the badge on U.S. Army or U.S. Air Force service uniforms until they return to Title 32 status.
The NRA sponsors a Law Enforcement Governor&#x27;s Twenty Badge which is designed to recognize the top Twenty law enforcement officers from each state for excellence in police combat pistol competition. Each state&#x27;s program is administered by their respective league or association. Typically, the top three scores of each officer is averaged and the top twenty officers are recognized with the Governor&#x27;s Twenty Badge. Although sponsored by the NRA, each state&#x27;s badge has its own unique design.
Some states have marksmanship badges that are awarded by their State Adjutant General, such as the Missouri National Guard Adjutant General&#x27;s Twenty Combat Badge. This circular badge is awarded to those guardsmen who place in the top twenty competitors at the state&#x27;s annual combat matches for the rifle/pistol championships. Some 100 shooters compete in the annual state matches and participants compete against other Guardsman who have already received the award; thus there might only be one or two new recipients of the badge each year.

The Missouri Adjutant General&#x27;s Twenty Combat Badge was created in the 1980s to recognize the top eight rifle, eight pistol, two machine gun, and two sniper shooters at the state&#x27;s annual combat matches. As those matches changed, the award shifted to the top twenty competitors at the state&#x27;s rifle/pistol championships.

The badge is worn centered on the right breast pocket of the U.S. Army combat uniform and airman battle uniform. Also, recipients of this badge are awarded the Missouri Adjutant General&#x27;s Twenty Ribbon ( ) for wear on U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force service uniforms. Just like the Chief&#x27;s Fifty and Governor&#x27;s Twenty awards, the Adjutant General&#x27;s Twenty Combat Badge and Ribbon are state-level awards and can only be worn on U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force uniforms when operating under Title 32 of the U.S. Code.
====Former competition ranking badges====

Starting in 1926, the U.S. Army Air Corps began awarding distinguished aerial badges. The Air Corps held three gunnery matches; one for pursuit pilots, one for observation and attack pilots, and one for observers. They also held two bombing matches, one for heavier-than-air craft and one for balloons. Winners of these matches received either the Distinguished Aerial Gunner Badge or the Distinguished Aerial Bomber Badge. These matches were suspended in 1932; thus, it is assumed these badges were retired sometime after that date.
In 1903, the 57th U.S. Congress created the National Marksmanship Competition Matches which provided for the creation of the National Match (Dogs of War) Trophy. Winners of the National Match (Dogs of War) Trophy were also awarded an antique bronze National Trophy Match (Dogs of War) Badge along with the top 15% of the teams that competed in these matches.

The pendant of the National Trophy Match (Dogs of War) Badge replicated the bronze shield of the national trophy which had the names of the four military services, at that time, (the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and National Guard) embossed on small rectangles below a small replica of the Great Seal of the United States on the left side of the badge&#x27;s pendant. To the right of this was a prominent design of an ancient warrior with four dogs on leashes (the dogs of war). To the right of the warrior was the following embossed phrase: &quot;National Trophy Presented by the Congress of the United States for Excellence in Team Marksmanship.&quot; Below the leashed dogs, at the base of the pendant, is a short embossed statement reflecting why the badge was awarded. This pendant hung from a plain rectangular brooch embossed with the words &quot;THE NATIONAL MATCH TEAM,&quot; with the exception of the 1913 badge which was embossed with &quot;NATIONAL TEAM MATCH 1913.&quot;

As with today&#x27;s Army Interservice Competition Badges, the awarding of the National Trophy Match (Dogs of War) Badge was separate from the leg points used towered &quot;distinguished status,&quot; but did count towards a now defunct requirement whereby an individual must earn a certain number of marksmanship awards, in addition to the required 30 leg points, to achieve &quot;distinguished status.&quot; In 1919 this badge gave way to National Trophy Match (Dogs of War) Medals. Although this historic badge is still authorized for wear on U.S. Army service uniforms, today teams that win this prestigious trophy are presented with a National Trophy Match (Dogs of War) Plaque.

<text>Naga fireballs (; ), also known as &quot;bung fai phaya nak&quot; or &quot;Mekong lights&quot; and formerly &quot;ghost lights&quot;, are a phenomenon said to be seen annually on the Mekong River. Glowing balls are alleged to naturally rise from the water high into the air. The balls are said to be reddish and to range in size from smaller sparkles up to the size of basketballs. They quickly rise up to a couple of hundred metres before disappearing. The number of fireballs reported varies between tens and thousands per night. The phenomenon is locally attributed to &quot;phaya nak&quot;, a giant serpent (Nāga) said to live in the Mekong.

==Description==
The fireballs are most often reported around the night of Wan Ok Phansa at the end of Buddhist Lent in late-October. Naga fireballs have been reported over an approximately long section of the Mekong River centered approximately on Phon Phisai in the Phon Phisai District. Fireballs have also been reported rising from smaller rivers, lakes and ponds in the region. The fireballs were called &quot;ghost lights&quot; by locals until the mid-1980s, when the local council officially named them &quot;phaya nak lights&quot;. In 2018, one observer noted that while the light phenomenon is &quot;hundreds of years old&quot;, the new name Phaya Nak lights is only about 35 years old.&quot;

== Explanations ==
Although the fireballs are regularly seen on the river during the Phayanak Festival, a 2002 iTV documentary showed Lao soldiers firing tracer rounds into the air across the river from the festival. Skeptic Brian Dunning suggests that it would be impossible for anyone across the half-mile river to hear a gunshot because it would take 2.5 seconds for the sound to travel to the spectators, and by then the crowd watching would have already noticed the light and started cheering, drowning out any sound to reach them. Thai biologist Jessada Denduangboripant analysed footage of a Naga fireball event and concluded that the effect was caused by the firing of flare guns from the other side of the river. A 2021 official investigation by Lao authorities during a COVID-19 lockdown and curfew, concluded &quot;In response to the news in foreign media, I would like to state that it is extremely unlikely that anyone could have fired weapons or flare ammunition without our knowledge on that night. We ensured a heavy police presence through the night and did not encounter any incidents&quot;.

Some individuals have attempted to explain the phenomenon scientifically. One explanation is that the fireball is a result of flammable phosphine gas generated by the marshy environment. Dunning writes that such fireballs are very unlikely to spontaneously ignite, and would not stay lit when at the speeds the fireballs travel, and that there is no science that can explain &quot;the Naga Fireballs to be naturally produced burning gas bubbles.&quot;

A similar explanation involves a phenomenon seen in plasma physics: free-floating plasma orbs created when surface electricity (e.g., from a capacitor) is discharged into a solution. However, these are produced under controlled conditions during plasma ball experiments using high voltage capacitors, microwave oscillators, or microwave ovens, rather than naturally occurring.

<text>The Nikon FM is a mechanically operated, interchangeable lens, 35 mm film, single-lens reflex (SLR) camera. It was made in Japan between 1977 and 1982 by Nippon Kogaku K. K. (now Nikon Corporation). 

==History==
Released in 1977, the FM was the replacement for Nikkormat FT3, which had been introduced only a few months prior. It introduced an entirely new compact, but rugged, copper-aluminum alloy (duralumin) chassis that would become the basis for Nikon&#x27;s highly successful range of compact semi-professional SLR cameras.

These cameras were intended to provide a more reasonably priced alternative to Nikon&#x27;s professional F-series cameras, such as the Nikon F2. They were all-new successors to the Nikkormat F- and EL-series of amateur-level SLRs, but despite the lower price-point they continued Nikon&#x27;s reputation for high-quality construction, impressive durability and measured technical innovation.

The FM has proven to be a remarkably long-lived and reliable camera. Over the next twenty-nine years Nippon Kogaku would use the same chassis and basic design philosophy (with some modifications) for the FE (introduced in 1978), FM2 (1982), FE2 (1983), FA (1983) and the limited production FM3A of 2001.

==Design and construction==
The FM is manufactured almost entirely from metal and uses a mechanical shutter. It is manual-focus-only, with manual exposure control. Being mechanical, the FM needs no batteries to operate (though two 1.5 volt 357 or 76A or LR44 or SR44 cells are required to operate the light meter). The metering system comprises a gallium photodiode (with 60/40% center-weighting) that meters through-the-lens at maximum aperture. Its reading is displayed by a &quot;center-the-LED&quot; system using vertically arranged light-emitting diodes (LEDs) next to +/O/- markers on the right side of the viewfinder that indicate overexposure, correct, or underexposure, respectively. The photographer adjusts the aperture or shutter-speed until the &quot;O&quot; LED illuminated to indicate correct exposure. This system can be traced back to the Nikkormat FT of 1965 and its &quot;center-the-needle&quot; system. The succeeding Nikon FM2 uses an improved center-the-LED system.

For its time, the FM used a modern titanium-bladed, vertical-travel focal plane shutter capable of speeds from 1 second to 1/1000 of a second, plus bulb. Flash X-sync was at speeds up to 1/125th second.

The body has dimensions of 89.5 mm height, 142 mm width, 60.5 mm depth and 590 g weight. It was available in two finishes; silver with black trim and all black.

==Lens compatibility==
The FM accepts all Nikon F bayonet mount lenses, with certain limitations or exceptions. Full compatibility requires lenses that support the Automatic Maximum-Aperture Indexing (AI) specification. This includes most Nikon lenses manufactured after 1977. Pre-AI lenses can be used, but only with stop-down metering.

Many newer Nikon and third-party F-mount lenses are also compatible. The only major exceptions are G-type Nikkor lenses, which have no aperture ring and thus no way of properly controlling exposure, and DX Nikkors, which do not resolve an image large enough to cover the 135 frame. All other AF Nikkor lenses will mount and be usable, but autofocus and Vibration Reduction (VR) will not be supported.

Both IX Nikkor lenses, for Nikon&#x27;s Advanced Photo System (APS) SLRs, and very old &quot;invasive&quot; Fisheye-Nikkor lenses from the 1960s must not be mounted on the FM, as their rear elements will damage the FM&#x27;s reflex mirror.

==Other features==

The FM has a &quot;full information&quot; viewfinder. In addition to the metering LEDs; the viewfinder also displays the set shutter speed and lens aperture to give context to the LEDs. A fixed K-type focus screen with 3 mm split-image rangefinder and 1 mm microprism collar is fitted.

Major system accessories for the FM include the MD-11 and MD-12 motor drives; which enables continuous film advance at 3.5 frames per second, the Data Back MF-12; enabling the imprinting of date and time data on the film, and the Speedlight SB-8E electronic flash; guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100.

Note that there were two distinct versions of the FM, depending on how the FM&#x27;s light meter (see below) was activated when a motor drive was mounted. The original FM had a rotary switch shutter button collar to lock the shutter, or switch to motor drive mode when the MD-11 was mounted. The MD-12 activated the meter automatically and the switch was omitted on late (1979 or after) FMs. Nippon Kogaku also took the opportunity to construct late FMs more strongly internally than early FMs.

==Design history==

Due to advances in technology, the 1970s and 1980s saw increasing competition between the major SLR brands: Nikon, Canon, Minolta, Pentax and Olympus. The industry sought to meet increasing consumer demand for entry-level SLR cameras that were more capable than 35mm rangefinder (RF) cameras at the time, such as the Nikon S. From 1975 to 1985, there was a dramatic shift from heavy all-metal manual mechanical camera bodies to more compact bodies with microprocessor electronic automation.

Both Nikon&#x27;s F2 and the Nikkormats were noted for their toughness and reliability. Nippon Kogaku wanted to instill these qualities into a new smaller and lighter design, and incorporate their high standard of workmanship into entry-level SLRs. For the FM, this meant the use of high-strength machined metal parts, hardened metal gears, a bearing-mounted film and shutter transport, and a camera assembled to precise tolerances. As a result, the Nikon FM is considered one of the most reliable 35mm SLR designs ever built.

The Nikon FM sold very well compared to the competing mechanical Pentax MX (released 1977) and Olympus OM-1N (1979) cameras. It was also a very popular backup camera among professional photographers using the Nikon F2 and F3. Because of its durability and access to the Nikkor lens line, the FM saw success in its market niche and brought the introduction of an improved successor, the Nikon FM2, in 1982.

<text>The bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) is a char of the family Salmonidae native to northwestern North America. Historically, &quot;S. confluentus&quot; has been known as the &quot;Dolly Varden&quot; (&quot;S. malma&quot;), but was reclassified as a separate species in 1980. Populations of bull trout in the lower 48 states are listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and bull trout overall are listed as vulnerable to extinction on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The Saskatchewan-Nelson Rivers population in Alberta, Canada is listed as threatened under the Species at Risk Act.

==Description==
Like other species of char, the fins of a bull trout have white leading edges. Its head and mouth are unusually large for salmonids, giving it its name. Bull trout have been recorded measuring up to in length and weighing . Bull trout may be either migratory, moving throughout large river systems, lakes, and the ocean, or they may be resident, remaining in the same stream their entire lives. Migratory bull trout are typically much larger than resident bull trout, which rarely exceed . Bull trout can be differentiated from brook trout (&quot;S. fontinalis&quot;) by the absence of distinct spots on the dorsal fin, as well as yellow, orange, or salmon-colored spots on the back as opposed to red spots with blue halos on the brook trout. Bull trout lack the deeply forked tail fin of lake trout (&quot;S. namaycush&quot;, another char).

==Distribution and habitat==

&quot;S. confluentus&quot; is found in the cold, clear waters of the high mountains and coastal rivers of northwestern North America, including Yukon, Alberta, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and western Montana, as well as the Jarbidge River of northern Nevada and perhaps Alaska. A population of bull trout exists east of the Continental Divide in Alberta, where it is the provincial fish. The historical range of bull trout also included northern California, but they are likely extirpated.

Bull trout have exacting habitat demands, requiring water temperatures generally below 55 °F (13 °C), clean gravel beds, deep pools, complex cover such as snags and cut banks, and large systems of interconnected waterways to accommodate spawning migrations. Thus, they favor the deep pools of cold lakes and large rivers, as well as high, cold mountain headwaters. Bull trout may be anadromous in coastal rivers, and individual bull trout have been found to have migrated from one coastal river to another by the ocean.

== Dispersal ==
Bull trout are known for their extensive movements within river systems. They exhibit short-distance and long-distance movements, which are crucial in maintaining healthy populations and genetic diversity. During the early life stages, bull trout are often found in small, low-gradient streams or near the shores of larger rivers and lakes. As they grow and mature, they start to disperse in search of suitable spawning grounds and feeding habitats.

One of the primary reasons for bull trout dispersal is the need to find appropriate spawning areas. Bull trout rely on clean, cold water and gravels of specific sizes for successful reproduction. Once mature, they migrate upstream to spawn in the same streams where they were born. This behavior ensures that the population remains connected and allows for the exchange of genetic material. The dispersal distances can vary greatly, with some individuals traveling only a few miles while others undertake extensive migrations of over a hundred miles.

Long-distance dispersal is also an essential aspect of bull trout ecology. These movements often occur during the non-spawning season when the fish search for suitable feeding grounds or escape unfavorable conditions such as high water temperatures or low oxygen levels. In some cases, bull trout have been observed moving between different river basins, crossing over mountain ranges, and even traversing large lakes. These long-distance dispersal events contribute to gene flow between isolated populations, maintaining genetic diversity and increasing the species’ resilience.

Understanding bull trout dispersal patterns is crucial for effective conservation and management strategies. Conservation efforts can be focused on protecting critical habitats and maintaining connectivity between populations. Conservation biologists use various techniques to study bull trout dispersal, including radio telemetry, genetic analysis, and mark-recapture studies. By tracking the movements of individual fish and analyzing their genetic makeup, researchers can gain valuable insights into dispersal patterns, population dynamics, and potential barriers to migration.

Bull trout dispersal is a complex and vital aspect of their life history. Their movements are critical to maintaining population connectivity, genetic diversity, and ecosystem health. Protecting and restoring essential habitats, ensuring the connectivity of river systems, and managing anthropogenic influences in bull trout habitats are all crucial steps in conserving this iconic species.

==Feeding==
Young bull trout feed on zooplankton and zoobenthos, especially chironomids. As they grow larger, they begin to feed heavily upon other fish. In coastal Washington, some of the southernmost populations of bull trout feed heavily on salmon eggs and fry, as well as fish.

==Conservation==

The bull trout is listed as a threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act throughout its range in the contiguous United States. In 1998, the Klamath River distinct population segment (DPS) and Columbia River DPS were federally listed as threatened. This finding followed a legal challenge to the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service&#x27;s (USFWS) decision in 1994 to assign a lower priority to the species&#x27; listing. The Jarbidge River DPS was listed as endangered under an emergency rule in 1998, and was subsequently downgraded to threatened in 1999. Finally, in determining that the Coastal-Puget Sound and St. Mary-Belly River DPS were threatened, the USFWS issued a threatened listing for all bull trout in the lower 48 states in 1999.

In the United States, bull trout are used as a management indicator species for several national forests, including Boise National Forest and Sawtooth National Forest (Sawtooth National Recreation Area). They can also be found in the Glacier National Park. Bull trout reproduction requires cold water and very low amounts of silt, both of which are negatively impacted by road building and logging. Additionally, its need to migrate throughout river systems may be hindered by impassible fish barriers, such as dams. Bull trout populations are also in danger from hybridization with non-native brook trout. Several of these issues were raised in a long-running lawsuit where in 2003, the Oregon Natural Desert Association and the Center for Biological Diversity sued the U.S. Forest Service claiming they violated the National Forest Management Act and Wild and Scenic Rivers Act by approving grazing plans in Oregon&#x27;s Malheur National Forest. In April 2018, U.S. District Judge Michael W. Mosman dismissed the complaint.

They are a prized game fish in northern Canada. It was once maligned out of fear they threatened populations of other native species more prized by anglers. Some jurisdictions publicize the requirement to release with the slogan &quot;No black, put it back&quot;.

Within Canada, bull trout have been designated as a &quot;species of Special Concern&quot; by both the Government of Alberta and the Government of British Columbia. By the recommendation of COSEWIC, the Saskatchewan-Nelson Rivers population in Alberta was listed as threatened under the Species at Risk Act in 2019.

==Historical names==


===&quot;Dolly Varden&quot; in California===
Historically, confusion has existed between &quot;S. confluentus&quot; and &quot;Salvelinus malma malma&quot;, today commonly called the Dolly Varden trout. This was likely due to overlapping ranges and similar appearances among members of the two species.

The first recorded use of the name &quot;Dolly Varden&quot; for a fish species was applied to members of &quot;S. confluentus&quot; caught in the McCloud River in northern California in the early 1870s. In his book &quot;Inland Fishes of California&quot;, Peter Moyle recounted a letter from Mrs. Valerie Masson Gomez:
In 1874, Livingston Stone, a naturalist working for the U.S. government, wrote of this fish: 

It is currently unknown whether the name &quot;Dolly Varden&quot; was later applied to &quot;S. m. malma&quot; because of its similar appearance to &quot;S. confluentus&quot;; the two may have even been believed to be the same species. The name &quot;Dolly Varden&quot; may have also been given to &quot;S. m. malma&quot; independent of the McCloud River fish.

Ironically, the original &quot;Dolly Varden&quot; trout (i.e., &quot;S. confluentus&quot;) apparently likely became extirpated in the McCloud River in the 1970s, although reports continue of its being caught. Other fish species, typically introduced trout, outcompete &quot;S. confluentus&quot;, and can interbreed with them, resulting in sterile hybrids. An attempt to reintroduce &quot;S. confluentus&quot; to the McCloud was unsuccessful, and no additional attempts are expected.

===Other uses of &quot;Dolly Varden&quot;===
The &quot;Dolly Varden&quot; name is also applied to the other subspecies of &quot;S. malma&quot;, the &quot;S. m. krascheninnikova&quot;, and &quot;S. m. miyabei&quot;, found in Lake Shikaribetsu on the island of Hokkaidō in Japan.

The name has also been applied to &quot;S. alpinus&quot;, today more commonly known as Arctic char.

===&quot;Bull trout&quot; in Europe===
The name &quot;bull trout&quot; was also given in the past to some of the large sea trout that run the River Tweed and other rivers in Scotland and North East England. Victorian anglers and others classified these as a separate race, but today they are biologically classified along with all other UK brown and sea trout as &quot;Salmo trutta&quot;. This does not deny that populations of &quot;S. trutta&quot; can differ appreciably in habits, size, and appearance from place to place, or indeed in the same river or lake.

<doc id="878867" wikidata="Q771392" url="?curid=878867" title="Anonymous IV">
<text>Anonymous IV is the designation given to the writer of an important treatise of medieval music theory. He was probably an English student working at Notre Dame de Paris, most likely in the 1270s or 1280s. Nothing is known about his life. His writings survive in two partial copies from Bury St Edmunds; one from the 13th century, and one from the 14th.

Along with Johannes de Garlandia and Franco of Cologne, whose work precedes his, Anonymous IV&#x27;s writings are the main source for understanding the Notre Dame school of polyphony. He wrote about Léonin and Pérotin, thereby assigning names to two of the composers of the music of the Notre Dame school who otherwise would have been anonymous. Léonin and Pérotin are among the earliest European composers whose names are known. Although they probably died at least fifty years earlier, he described them as still famous and part of the living tradition.

Anonymous IV mentions Léonin and Pérotin as the best composers of organum and discant respectively. He also mentions specific compositions as being by Pérotin (or Perotinus), including the four-part organa quadrupla &quot;Viderunt&quot; and &quot;Sederunt&quot;. Anonymous IV also mentions the work of the theorist Franco of Cologne; describes organum, discantus, rhythmic modes, and genres of composition; and gives rules for the use of notation and of consonance and dissonance.

==Editions and translations==
The standard edition of the treatise of Anonymous IV is that of Fritz Reckow. Two translations into English have been made. The most recent, still in print, is by Jeremy Yudkin. Although the older translation by Luther Dittmer has long been unavailable, it has recently been released online by the Institute of Medieval Music.

<text>Leonard Freel Woodcock (February 15, 1911 – January 16, 2001) was President of the United Auto Workers (UAW) and the first US ambassador to the People&#x27;s Republic of China after being the last Chief of the US Liaison Office in Beijing.

== Early life ==
Woodcock was born in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1911. He was the son of Ernest Woodcock and Margaret Freel. At the outbreak of World War I, the family was living in Germany, and Ernest was interned. While Leonard had been born in the United States, his parents were British. Both mother and son returned to the United Kingdom for the duration of the war, where he attended school.

The family members were eventually reunited and sought a new life in North America. Originally settled in Canada, they relocating a few years later, to Detroit, Michigan.

== Early career ==
The pressures of the Great Depression led Woodcock to drop out of College of the City of Detroit in 1933. He found work as a machine assembler in Detroit, and both he and his father became involved in the union movement. Woodcock became International Vice President in 1955.

==UAW president==
In 1970, he became UAW president, succeeding Walter Reuther, who died in a plane crash.

Woodcock was an active participant in the Civil Rights Movement, marching with Martin Luther King Jr. and adding his voice and political clout to the cause. He was a champion of both minority and women&#x27;s rights, pushing for comprehensive nondiscrimination rules and introducing the first union-wide contracted maternity leave in the United States.

Woodcock appeared on Nixon&#x27;s enemies list at #9 while he was UAW president with the annotation &quot;No comments necessary.&quot;

== China ==
In 1977, Woodcock retired from the union and was named by President Jimmy Carter as head of the United States Liaison Office in Beijing, which, in the absence of full diplomatic relations, served as the &quot;de facto&quot; U.S. embassy in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. During the same period, Woodcock was charged with leading a special delegation to Laos and Vietnam in search of US soldiers who were prisoners-of-war or missing in action.

After leading negotiations to establish full diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1979, Woodcock was appointed the first US ambassador there. He was the first ambassador to Mainland China since 1949, when Leighton Stuart served as ambassador to the Republic of China. Though some questioned appointing a labor leader to head the delicate diplomatic mission, Carter insisted that he needed a negotiator.

In a 2000 speech at the White House to celebrate 20 years of Most Favored Nation status, Carter said:

One of the choices I had to make was whom to send to China to begin the secret negotiations with Deng Xiaoping; he was the unquestioned ruler of the nation. And I chose a man who was the senior statesman of the American labor movement, Leonard Woodcock—respected by, I guess, every working man and woman who was a member of a union or not in this country, and he was also respected by all those who had dealt with him from the management side. And he was my personal representative in Beijing.
Leonard Woodcock, working directly with me from the White House, negotiated successfully the terms for normalization of diplomatic relations. And on the first day of January, 1979, we formed those relationships. That year, Leonard Woodcock, still highly conversant with, and whose heart was attuned to, the labor movement of America, negotiated the first trade agreement, Most Favored Nations agreement, with China, in 1979. And now for 20 years, each year the Congress has confirmed his decision, and mine.

== Personal life ==
Woodcock married Loula Martin, with whom he had three children, in 1941. He was remarried in 1978, to Sharon Tuohy, a nurse working with the American delegation in China. He later taught political science at the University of Michigan, living in Ann Arbor with Sharon until his death on January 16, 2001.

Woodcock had three children, Leslie Woodcock Tentler (professor of history), Janet Woodcock (photographer) and John Woodcock (ret. Lt Col, USAF); two daughters-in-law (Carol, framer, partner of Janet and Susan, married to John) and a son-in-law (Thomas Tentler, professor of history); and three grandchildren, Sarah Tentler (speechwriter and political advisor), Daniel Tentler (lawyer) and Gregory Tentler (professor of art history).

==Archival records==
The archival records of Woodcock can be found mostly at the Walter P. Reuther Library of Labor and Urban Affairs. Notable are the &quot;UAW President&#x27;s Office: Leonard Woodcock Records&quot; and &quot;UAW Vice-President’s Office: Leonard Woodcock Records&quot;, two extensive collections that document his time as an executive with the UAW. The materials include Woodcock’s personal correspondence, photographs, official memorandum, and other various record types. Additional repositories with historical materials chronicling Woodcock are the Bentley Historical Library and the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum.

<text>Rubab Raza (; born January 15, 1991) is an Olympic and national-record-holding swimmer from Pakistan. She became Pakistan&#x27;s first female Olympic swimmer when she swam at the 2004 Olympics.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics, she swam the 50m Freestyle, though unable to progress through the first round she undoubtedly opened up the opportunity for future female Pakistani swimmers. She became the third Pakistani female to compete at the Olympics—following Shabana Akhtar at the 1996 Olympics and Shazia Hidayat at the 2000 Olympics—shortly before the country&#x27;s fourth female competitor, Sumaira Zahoor, who ran the 1500m at the 2004 Games a few days after Raza swam. At the age of 13 at the time of her Olympic race, Raza was the youngest Pakistani female ever to compete at an Olympics.

The Pakistani Swimming Federation funded her with only $30 a month, but she was fortunate to have support from her father who is a retired army major and her mother who is a doctor.

She has won a number of national titles, and has seen success at Asian swimming tournaments. She also won a gold medal in 50m freestyle at Islamic Women&#x27;s Solidarity Games in Tehran, Iran.

She has also swum for Pakistan at the:
* 2006 South Asian Games
* 2006 Commonwealth Games

<doc id="878883" wikidata="Q1013617" url="?curid=878883" title="Channel-Port aux Basques">
<text>Channel-Port aux Basques is a town at the extreme southwestern tip of Newfoundland fronting on the western end of the Cabot Strait. A Marine Atlantic ferry terminal is located in the town which is the primary entry point onto the island of Newfoundland and the western terminus of the Newfoundland and Labrador Route 1 (Trans-Canada Highway) in the province. The town was incorporated in 1945 and its population in the 2021 census was 3,547.

Port aux Basques is the oldest of the collection of villages that make up the present-day town, which consists of Port aux Basques, Channel, Grand Bay and Mouse Island. The town is called &quot;Siinalk&quot; in the Miꞌkmaq language.

==History==
Channel was settled by fisher-folk from the Channel Islands in the early 1700s. Port aux Basques refers to the harbour that was a favoured sheltering and watering place for Basque whalers who hailed from the Basque region of Spain during the early 16th century. After leaving the harbour the whalers either proceeded to the main whaling grounds off southern Labrador, or headed home to the Basque country. They almost certainly took on fresh water from Dead Man&#x27;s Brook, which flows into Port aux Basques harbour, during their stopovers.

Port aux Basques is first seen on a 1687 Johannes van Keulen map of the area. Permanent settlement came from French fishermen who overwintered on this, the French Shore, using rights given under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht which saw France cede its claims in Newfoundland to Great Britain in exchange for right of use of coastal lands for the fishery. With the fishery being the economic mainstay for both French and British settlers in the area, Channel-Port aux Basques appeared destined to remain a collection of small fishing villages.

In 1856, an underwater telegraph cable was successfully laid between Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island, making landfall nearby. This was the first step in the race to complete a trans-Atlantic telegraph cable. A telegraph station was opened in Port aux Basques in 1857.

In the 1880s, the Government of Canada erected a lighthouse at nearby Cape Ray which, despite being in the then-separate British colony of Newfoundland, was considered a navigation hazard for vessels bound for Canadian ports in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.

In 1893, it was decided to extend the western terminus of the Newfoundland Railway (then under construction west from the Avalon Peninsula by Robert G. Reid) from St. George&#x27;s to Port aux Basques harbour. By 1897 the tracks reached Port aux Basques, although the harbour facilities had not been built at that time to handle the steamer &quot;Bruce&quot;, which had been built in Scotland and had arrived in Newfoundland several months earlier. While the required docks were constructed, the &quot;Bruce&quot; operated between Little Placentia Sound and North Sydney, Nova Scotia from October, 1897 until June, 1898.
On June 30, 1898, the first passenger train arrived in Port aux Basques, and &quot;Bruce&quot; departed for North Sydney shortly afterward. Over the years, the narrow gauge Newfoundland Railway expanded both the number of trains and vessels which called at Port Aux Basques. In 1925 the steamer SS &quot;Caribou&quot; began service. She was attacked and sunk by the German submarine U-69 (1940) on 14 October 1942 with a loss of 137 lives, some from the Port aux Basques area. There were 20 widows from &quot;Caribou&quot; sinking in the Port aux Basques area.

The town of Channel-Port aux Basques was incorporated in 1945 with Samuel (Sam) Walters as the first mayor. In 1964 the community of Mouse Island was annexed.

On March 31, 1949, Newfoundland entered into Confederation and the railway was transferred to Canadian National Railway. Under Term 32 of the Terms of Union between Canada and Newfoundland (1949), the ferry service between North Sydney, Nova Scotia and Port aux Basques, Newfoundland was guaranteed, first under the British North America Act and after 1982 under the Constitution of Canada.

Upon CNR&#x27;s assumption of the railway and ferry service, the 1950s saw extensive construction at Port aux Basques with expansion of new dock facilities and the arrival of newer and larger ships such as the MV &quot;William Carson&quot;. Extensive blasting of rock created space for large rail yards with extensive dual gauge trackage. The excess rock was then used as fill to create the required docks. By the mid-1960s, new railcar-capable ferries such as the MV &quot;Frederick Carter&quot; permitted the exchange of standard gauge railcars, requiring further expansion at the Port aux Basques terminal facilities.

The mid-1960s also saw the completion of the Trans-Canada Highway across Newfoundland, an event which eventually led to the closure of the railway by 1988, but which made Port aux Basques into an even more important gateway to the island of Newfoundland, given the increased number of tourists visiting the province, and the rising amount of truck traffic. New Ro-Pax-capable vessels were commissioned and/or chartered during the 1960s–1980s to meet the growing demand, such as &quot;Marine Nautica&quot;, &quot;Marine Atlantica&quot;, &quot;Marine Evangeline&quot;, &quot;Ambrose Shea&quot;, and &quot;John Hamilton Gray&quot;.

With the abandonment of the railway, extensive rebuilding of Port aux Basques terminal resulted in expansive marshaling areas for waiting motor vehicle traffic. A plant disease inspection station operated by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency is located on site, as well as a modern rebuilt railway station now used as a passenger terminal for the ferry service operated by Marine Atlantic, which was renamed from CN Marine in 1986. Port aux Basques harbour used to host the arrival of the two largest icebreaking ferries in Canada at the time, the and both of which were retired and decommissioned in 2011.

===Hurricane Fiona===
In September 2022, the town was partially evacuated due to Hurricane Fiona. Over 100 homes were reportedly washed away from the wind and storm surge in Newfoundland with a bulk of the homes being from the town. Many locals of the town claimed that it was the worst storm they’ve ever seen, and a community changing event. The town declared a state of emergency on September 24, 2022. On September 26, 2022, RCMP confirmed a 73-year-old Port aux Basques woman was killed after being swept out into the ocean. Newfoundland and Labrador is the only province with a confirmed loss of life directly related to the storm.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Channel-Port aux Basques had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of −12.8% from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Transportation==
Both the Trans-Canada Highway and the Trans Canada Trail have their Newfoundland and Labrador start and end points in Port aux Basques.

===Ferries===
In 2009, a larger and more modern vessel, the , was added to the fleet. With a larger carrying capacity and an equivalent ice class to the MV &quot;Caribou&quot;, the MV &quot;Atlantic Vision&quot; was introduced as the new flagship for Marine Atlantic. Following the retirement of the MV &quot;Caribou&quot; and the MV &quot;Joseph and Clara Smallwood&quot;, two more new ships were acquired on a 5-year charter from Stena Line. These two new ships, the and currently round out the Marine Atlantic fleet. Marine Atlantic announced in May 2015 that it would be purchasing both ships for C$100 Million each.

==College of the North Atlantic==
The Port aux Basques campus of the College of the North Atlantic first opened as the District Vocational School in September 1963. The school was constructed by MR Chappell of Nova Scotia because Lundrigans Ltd of Corner Brook who was constructing the other District Vocational Schools in Newfoundland couldn&#x27;t move their equipment and supplies over the uncompleted road from Corner Brook to Port aux Basques. The Trans-Canada Highway from Corner Brook to Port aux Basques was completed in 1965.

==Climate==
Channel-Port aux Basques experiences a maritime-influenced subarctic climate that has the Köppen climate classification code of &quot;(Dfc)&quot;. The location has strong seasonal lag as well as being cold for the latitude. This is since it is being influenced by the Icelandic Low and the Labrador Current, which renders a rare combination of cold and snowy winters along a seacoast at 47°N. In summer the warmup is strongly delayed by the cold waters and westerly winds from the interior of Canada are very cold in winter, further delaying the warming of the water. As a result, August is clearly warmer than July, and even September is more than warmer than June is. Winter precipitation often falls as snow, for a high annual yield, but rainfall even in the coldest of February is still quite common, which lowers the snow cover to average about at its annual peak.
==Sports==
Port aux Basques placed second in the top five communities for Kraft Hockeyville 2008, and won $20,000 for its local arena. Its sports arena, Bruce I, burned down in 1995, just prior to the hockey season. It was located on top of Army Hill on a road named Stadium Road down in Channel. The new arena, Bruce II Sports Centre, was opened on November 23, 1996.

<doc id="878885" wikidata="Q2561704" url="?curid=878885" title="St. Lunatics">
<text>St. Lunatics were an American hip hop group formed in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1993. The group consisted of childhood friends Nelly, Ali, Murphy Lee, Kyjuan, City Spud, and Slo Down.

Their first hit, &quot;Gimme What U Got&quot;, gained popularity in 1996. In 2000, the group signed with Universal Records. Their debut album, &quot;Free City&quot;, was released after Nelly&#x27;s solo breakthrough, achieving Platinum status in the U.S. Members of St. Lunatics pursued solo careers, and Nelly opened a music production school. An anticipated album in 2009, &quot;City Free&quot;, was never released. City Spud served a prison term for a robbery-related crime and later performed with Nelly at the 2023 Grammy Awards.

==History==
After graduating from high school, the band members were working day jobs in the service industry or attending college. St. Lunatics&#x27; first local independent hit was &quot;Gimme What U Got&quot;, released in 1996. In 1997, DJ Kut on the Beat FM started playing the single locally, generating interest in the group. In 2000, Nelly was signed to Universal Records, followed by the rest of the group. While Nelly was working on his solo album &quot;Country Grammar&quot;, City Spud was arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison for robbery. After Nelly&#x27;s breakthrough success in 2000, St. Lunatics released their debut album, &quot;Free City&quot;. In 2001, the singles &quot;Summer in the City&quot; and &quot;Midwest Swing&quot; were released. &quot;Free City&quot; was certified Platinum in the United States and Gold in Canada.

In 2002, Ali issued his solo album &quot;Heavy Starch&quot; while Murphy Lee published &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Law&quot; in 2003. Murphy later launched his own label, UC ME Entertainment. Nelly went on to have a successful solo career and in 2011, he partnered with St. Louis-based Vatterott College to open a music production school in downtown St. Louis, called Ex&#x27;treme Institute (E.I.).

In 2009, St. Lunatics were reportedly working on a new album, &quot;City Free&quot;, to be released that summer. The record was later postponed until 2011. A song titled &quot;St. Lunatics&quot; was leaked in early March 2009, along with &quot;Get Low 2 Da Flo&quot;, which was produced by Play-N-Skillz. The first official single released from the album was &quot;Money Talks&quot;, featuring rapper Birdman. The second single was &quot;Polo&quot;. The record was never released, however.

After his release from prison, City Spud issued the solo mixtape &quot;Twelve-12&quot;, in 2010.

In 2023, City Spud performed &quot;Hot in Herre&quot; with Nelly at the 2023 Grammy Awards for the 50 Years of Hip-Hop&#x27; showcase.

On September 19, 2024, the group filed a copyright infringement suit against Nelly for unpaid royalties and lack of credit on two albums—Nelly&#x27;s &quot;Country Grammar&quot; and the group&#x27;s &quot;Free City&quot;—seeking $50 million from the defendant.

===City Spud&#x27;s legal issues===
Lavell Webb, known as City Spud, was a small-time marijuana dealer as a young adult. After quitting his job at a McDonald&#x27;s in St. Louis County, he had little money. Webb and a conspirator came up with the plan to pretend to sell marijuana to someone, intending to rob them instead.

On the night of April 15, 1999, during a robbery, their victim ended up getting shot five times in the back, though he survived. Webb was charged with first-degree robbery, one count of first-degree assault, and two counts of armed criminal action. Despite only being a first-time offender, he was sentenced to ten years in prison.

<doc id="878892" wikidata="Q2303163" url="?curid=878892" title="Escaflowne (film)">
<text>is a 2000 Japanese animated adventure dark fantasy film produced by Sunrise and animated by studio Bones. Directed by Kazuki Akane, the film is a re-telling of the 26-episode anime television series &quot;The Vision of Escaflowne&quot;. The film was licensed for Region 1 release by Bandai Entertainment, which gave the film a theatrical release in January 2002.

A soundtrack and two drama CDs have also been released in Japan by Victor Entertainment in relation to the series. There was also a novelization written by Ryota Yamaguchi published in 2000 by Kadaokawa Sneaker Bunko.

==Plot==
Hitomi Kanzaki is in crisis. Her life has lost its meaning, and she is plagued by unusual dreams. She is depressed and wants nothing more than to disappear. After falling out with her only friend, she is mysteriously summoned to another world, Gaea, where she finds herself inside Escaflowne, a doomsday weapon destined to come to life at the appearance of a prophesied &quot;wing goddess&quot;. The world of Gaea is facing its own crisis: relentless conquest by the Black Dragon Clan, the rebels against which become convinced that Hitomi is the prophesied goddess who will revive Escaflowne. Never certain of her identity in Gaea, Hitomi finds her destiny as she becomes closer to the rebel leader, Lord Van, and helps to bring about the fall of his vengeful brother Lord Folken, the master of the Black Dragon Clan.

==Voice cast==
==Production==
&quot;Escaflowne&quot; varies greatly from the original &quot;The Vision of Escaflowne&quot; series. With character re-designs by Nobuteru Yūki, the film focuses on the relationship between Van and Hitomi and their personal issues. The characters themselves are also given different personalities, with the film Hitomi changing from a cheerful girl in love to a depressed, suicidal schoolgirl who is suffering from self-induced feelings of loneliness and alienation. Van is also depicted as being more lonely and emotionally reserved, as well as being far more aggressive and willing to slay any perceived enemies than his more pacifistic series counterpart. Although the &quot;Vision of Escaflowne&quot; series had been produced by Sunrise, the animation for the film was handled primarily by studio Bones, a company founded by a number of ex-Sunrise staff. It was the first Bones feature film production. Studio co-founder Hiroshi Ōsaka and character designer Nobuteru Yūki split the animation director duties, with Ōsaka heading up production at Bones. Some of the film&#x27;s action sequences were assigned to the studio&#x27;s animators as talent showcases, notably including Yutaka Nakamura (who animated nearly a minute and a half of the opening sword fight without assistance). The soundtrack was, as with the &quot;Vision of Escaflowne&quot; series, composed mostly by Yoko Kanno in collaboration with Hajime Mizoguchi.

While the plot of the film has some similar elements to the original television series, the characters differ in varying degrees from the television counterparts, with many completely redesigned and bearing little resemblance to the originals. The world of Gaea has a more Asian design than the heavily European influenced television series.

==Release==
&quot;Escaflowne&quot; was released in Japan on June 24, 2000; while the first European presentation was on January 19, 2001, during the Future Film Festival in Bologna. The North American theatrical premiere was on January 25, 2002, in select cities, including Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Dallas, Chicago, and Vancouver. The North American television premiere was on September 10, 2005, on the programming block Adult Swim, after airing on [adult swim] on demand.

==Home media==
Bandai Visual released the film to DVD in a two-disc limited edition set on April 25, 2001. Packed in a limited edition art box, the release included a 36-page booklet on history of the film, as well as on-disc interviews with staff and cast and the theatrical trailers and television commercials. The film was released to Blu-ray disc on January 28, 2008. Formerly licensed by Bandai Entertainment, &quot;Escaflowne&quot; was first released to Region 1 DVD on July 23, 2002, in &quot;Standard&quot; and &quot;Ultimate&quot; editions. The Ultimate Edition included premium packaging, the CD soundtrack, an exclusive Maaya Sakamoto music video, interviews from the theatrical premiere events, and interviews with the staff and cast. On September 13, 2005, the film was re-released as part of Bandai&#x27;s &quot;Anime Legends&quot; line, including many of the extras from the Ultimate Edition, including the CD soundtrack and interviews. The film was given another re-release on February 6, 2007 under Bandai&#x27;s &quot;Anime Movie Classics&quot; label. Unlike the &quot;Anime Legends&quot; release, this version uses the same cover art and CD as the original standard DVD release. Bandai Entertainment also included the Ultimate Edition release of the movie in its 2004 &quot;Perfect Collection&quot; DVD set of the original &quot;Vision of Escaflowne&quot; anime series. Bandai released a Blu-ray version of the film on October 20, 2009. At Otakon 2013, Funimation Entertainment had announced that they have rescued both &quot;The Vision of Escaflowne&quot; and the movie. Both the movie and &quot;The Vision of Escaflowne&quot; were re-released in 2016 with a new English dub.

===Soundtrack===
The &quot;Escaflowne OST&quot; was released on July 5, 2000 and contains twenty-six tracks, including the movie&#x27;s full opening and ending themes. Yoko Kanno and Hajime Mizoguchi composed and produced the movie&#x27;s musical themes and backgrounds. Vocal performers include Maaya Sakamoto, Shanti Snyder, Midori, Children of Adom — Vocals and the Warsaw Chorus.

In North America, the soundtrack was released with the Ultimate Edition Region 1 DVD release on July 23, 2002 and with the &quot;Anime Legends&quot; re-release on September 13, 2005. The CD has not, however, been given an individual release.

===Drama CDs===
Victor Entertainment released two drama CDs: &quot;Escaflowne Prologue 1: Earth&quot; and &quot;Escaflowne Prologue 2: Gaea&quot; were both released on October 21, 2000 and originally broadcast as part of the Bunka Hoso radio show. Both drama CDs are out-of-print in Japan.

<doc id="878898" wikidata="Q2886899" url="?curid=878898" title="Oral candidiasis">
<text>Oral candidiasis (Acute pseudomembranous candidiasis), which is also known as oral thrush, among other names, is candidiasis that occurs in the mouth. That is, oral candidiasis is a mycosis (yeast/fungal infection) of &quot;Candida&quot; species on the mucous membranes of the mouth.

&quot;Candida albicans&quot; is the most commonly implicated organism in this condition. &quot;C. albicans&quot; is carried in the mouths of about 50% of the world&#x27;s population as a normal component of the oral microbiota. This candidal carriage state is not considered a disease, but when &quot;Candida&quot; species become pathogenic and invade host tissues, oral candidiasis can occur. This change usually constitutes an opportunistic infection by normally harmless micro-organisms because of local (i.e., mucosal) or systemic factors altering host immunity.

==Classification==

Oral candidiasis is a mycosis (fungal infection). Traditionally, oral candidiasis is classified using the Lehner system, originally described in the 1960s, into acute and chronic forms (see table). Some of the subtypes almost always occur as acute (e.g., acute pseudomembranous candidiasis), and others chronic. However, these typical presentations do not always hold true, which created problems with this system. A more recently proposed classification of oral candidiasis distinguishes &quot;primary oral candidiasis&quot;, where the condition is confined to the mouth and perioral tissues, and &quot;secondary oral candidiasis&quot;, where there is involvement of other parts of the body in addition to the mouth. The global human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) pandemic has been an important factor in the move away from the traditional classification since it has led to the formation of a new group of patients who present with atypical forms of oral candidiasis.

===By appearance===
Three main clinical appearances of candidiasis are generally recognized: pseudomembranous, erythematous (atrophic) and hyperplastic. Most often, affected individuals display one clear type or another, but sometimes there can be more than one clinical variant in the same person.
====Pseudomembranous====
Acute pseudomembranous candidiasis is a classic form of oral candidiasis, commonly referred to as thrush. Overall, this is the most common type of oral candidiasis, accounting for about 35% of oral candidiasis cases.

It is characterized by a coating or individual patches of pseudomembranous white slough that can be easily wiped away to reveal erythematous (reddened), and sometimes minimally bleeding, mucosa beneath. These areas of pseudomembrane are sometimes described as &quot;curdled milk&quot;, or &quot;cottage cheese&quot;. The white material is made up of debris, fibrin, and desquamated epithelium that has been invaded by yeast cells and hyphae that invade to the depth of the stratum spinosum. As an erythematous surface is revealed beneath the pseudomembranes, some consider pseudomembranous candidiasis and erythematous candidiasis stages of the same entity. Some sources state that if there is bleeding when the pseudomembrane is removed, then the mucosa has likely been affected by an underlying process such as lichen planus or chemotherapy. Pseudomembraneous candidiasis can involve any part of the mouth, but usually it appears on the tongue, buccal mucosae or palate.

It is classically an acute condition, appearing in infants, people taking antibiotics or immunosuppressant medications, or immunocompromising diseases. However, sometimes it can be chronic and intermittent, even lasting for many years. Chronicity of this subtype generally occurs in immunocompromised states, (e.g., leukemia, HIV) or in persons who use corticosteroids topically or by aerosol. Acute and chronic pseudomembranous candidiasis are indistinguishable in appearance.

====Erythematous====
Erythematous (atrophic) candidiasis is when the condition appears as a red, raw-looking lesion. Some sources consider denture-related stomatitis, angular stomatitis, median rhomboid glossitis, and antibiotic-induced stomatitis as subtypes of erythematous candidiasis, since these lesions are commonly erythematous/atrophic. It may precede the formation of a pseudomembrane, be left when the membrane is removed, or arise without prior pseudomembranes. Some sources state that erythematous candidiasis accounts for 60% of oral candidiasis cases. Where it is associated with inhalation steroids (often used for treatment of asthma), erythematous candidiasis commonly appears on the palate or the dorsum of the tongue. On the tongue, there is loss of the lingual papillae (depapillation), leaving a smooth area.

Acute erythematous candidiasis usually occurs on the dorsum of the tongue in persons taking long term corticosteroids or antibiotics, but occasionally it can occur after only a few days of using a topical antibiotic. This is usually termed &quot;antibiotic sore mouth&quot;, &quot;antibiotic sore tongue&quot;, or &quot;antibiotic-induced stomatitis&quot; because it is commonly painful as well as red.

Chronic erythematous candidiasis is more usually associated with denture wearing (see denture-related stomatitis).

====Hyperplastic====
This variant is also sometimes termed &quot;plaque-like candidiasis&quot; or &quot;nodular candidiasis&quot;. The most common appearance of hyperplastic candidiasis is a persistent white plaque that does not rub off. The lesion may be rough or nodular in texture. Hyperplastic candidiasis is uncommon, accounting for about 5% of oral candidiasis cases, and is usually chronic and found in adults. The most common site of involvement is the commissural region of the buccal mucosa, usually on both sides of the mouth.

Another term for hyperplastic candidiasis is &quot;candidal leukoplakia&quot;. This term is a largely historical synonym for this subtype of candidiasis, rather than a true leukoplakia. Indeed, it can be clinically indistinguishable from true leukoplakia, but tissue biopsy shows candidal hyphae invading the epithelium. Some sources use this term to describe leukoplakia lesions that become colonized secondarily by &quot;Candida&quot; species, thereby distinguishing it from hyperplastic candidiasis. It is known that &quot;Candida&quot; resides more readily in mucosa that is altered, such as may occur with dysplasia and hyperkeratosis in an area of leukoplakia.

===Associated lesions===
&quot;Candida&quot;-associated lesions are primary oral candidiases (confined to the mouth), where the causes are thought to be multiple. For example, bacteria as well as &quot;Candida&quot; species may be involved in these lesions. Frequently, antifungal therapy alone does not permanently resolve these lesions, but rather the underlying predisposing factors must be addressed, in addition to treating the candidiasis.

====Angular cheilitis====
Angular cheilitis is inflammation at the corners (angles) of the mouth, very commonly involving &quot;Candida&quot; species, when sometimes the terms &quot;&quot;Candida&quot;-associated angular cheilitis&quot;, or less commonly &quot;monilial perlèche&quot; are used. &quot;Candida&quot; organisms alone are responsible for about 20% of cases, and a mixed infection of &quot;C. albicans&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; for about 60% of cases. Signs and symptoms include soreness, erythema (redness), and fissuring of one, or more commonly both the angles of the mouth, with edema (swelling) seen intraorally on the commissures (inside the corners of the mouth). Angular cheilitis generally occurs in elderly people and is associated with denture related stomatitis.

====Denture-related stomatitis====

This term refers to a mild inflammation and erythema of the mucosa beneath a denture, usually an upper denture in elderly edentulous individuals (with no natural teeth remaining). Some report that up to 65% of denture wearers have this condition to some degree. About 90% of cases are associated with &quot;Candida&quot; species, where sometimes the terms &quot;&quot;Candida&quot;-associated denture stomatitis&quot;, or &quot;&quot;Candida&quot;-associated denture-induced stomatitis&quot; (CADIS), are used. Some sources state that this is by far the most common form of oral candidiasis. Although this condition is also known as &quot;denture sore mouth&quot;, there is rarely any pain. &quot;Candida&quot; is associated with about 90% of cases of denture related stomatitis.

====Median rhomboid glossitis====
This is an elliptical or rhomboid lesion in the center of the dorsal tongue, just anterior (in front) of the circumvallate papillae. The area is depapillated, reddened (or red and white) and rarely painful. There is frequently &quot;Candida&quot; species in the lesion, sometimes mixed with bacteria.

====Linear gingival erythema====

This is a localized or generalized, linear band of erythematous gingivitis (inflammation of the gums). It was first observed in HIV infected individuals and termed &quot;HIV-gingivitis&quot;, but the condition is not confined to this group. &quot;Candida&quot; species are involved, and in some cases the lesion responds to antifungal therapy, but it is thought that other factors exist, such as oral hygiene and human herpesviruses. This condition can develop into necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis.

===Others===

====Chronic multifocal oral candidiasis====
This is an uncommon form of chronic (more than one month in duration) candidal infection involving multiple areas in the mouth, without signs of candidiasis on other mucosal or cutaneous sites. The lesions are variably red and/or white. Unusually for candidal infections, there is an absence of predisposing factors such as immunosuppression, and it occurs in apparently healthy individuals, normally elderly males. Smoking is a known risk factor.

====Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis====

This refers to a group of rare syndromes characterized by chronic candidal lesions on the skin, in the mouth and on other mucous membranes (i.e., a secondary oral candidiasis). These include Localized chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, diffuse mucocutaneous candidiasis (Candida granuloma), candidiasis–endocrinopathy syndrome and candidiasis thymoma syndrome. About 90% of people with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis have candidiasis in the mouth.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms are dependent upon the type of oral candidiasis. Often, apart from the appearance of the lesions, there are usually no other signs or symptoms. Most types of oral candidiasis are painless, but a burning sensation may occur in some cases. Candidiasis can, therefore, sometimes be misdiagnosed as burning mouth syndrome. A burning sensation is more likely with erythematous (atrophic) candidiasis, whilst hyperplastic candidiasis is normally entirely asymptomatic. Acute atrophic candidiasis may feel like the mouth has been scalded with a hot liquid. Another potential symptom is a metallic, acidic, salty or bitter taste in the mouth. The pseudomembranous type rarely causes any symptoms apart from possibly some discomfort or bad taste due to the presence of the membranes. Sometimes the patient describes the raised pseudomembranes as &quot;blisters.&quot; Occasionally there can be dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), which indicates that the candidiasis involves the oropharynx or the esophagus, as well as the mouth. The trachea and the larynx may also be involved where there is oral candidiasis, and this may cause hoarseness of the voice.

==Causes==

===Species===
The causative organism is usually &quot;Candida albicans&quot;, or less commonly other Candida species such as (in decreasing order of frequency) &quot;Candida tropicalis&quot;, &quot;Candida glabrata&quot;, &quot;Candida parapsilosis&quot;, &quot;Candida krusei&quot;, or other species (&quot;Candida stellatoidea&quot;, &quot;Candida pseudotropicalis&quot;, &quot;Candida famata&quot;, &quot;Candida rugosa&quot;, &quot;Candida geotrichium&quot;, &quot;Candida dubliniensis&quot;, and &quot;Candida guilliermondii&quot;). &quot;C. albicans&quot; accounts for about 50% of oral candidiasis cases, and together &quot;C. albicans&quot;, &quot;C. tropicalis&quot; and &quot;C. glabrata&quot; account for over 80% of cases. Candidiasis caused by non-&quot;C. albicans&quot; Candida (NCAC) species is associated more with immunodeficiency. For example, in HIV/AIDS, &quot;C. dubliniensis&quot; and &quot;C. geotrichium&quot; can become pathogenic.

About 35-50% of humans possess &quot;C. albicans&quot; as part of their normal oral microbiota. With more sensitive detection techniques, this figure is reported to rise to 90%. This candidal carrier state is not considered a disease, since there are no lesions or symptoms of any kind. Oral carriage of &quot;Candida&quot; is pre-requisite for the development of oral candidiasis. For &quot;Candida&quot; species to colonize and survive as a normal component of the oral microbiota, the organisms must be capable of adhering to the epithelial surface of the mucous membrane lining the mouth. This adhesion involves adhesins (e.g., hyphal wall protein 1), and extracellular polymeric materials (e.g., mannoprotein). Therefore, strains of &quot;Candida&quot; with more adhesion capability have more pathogenic potential than other strains. The prevalence of &quot;Candida&quot; carriage varies with geographic location, and many other factors. Higher carriage is reported during the summer months, in females, in hospitalized individuals, in persons with blood group O and in non-secretors of blood group antigens in saliva. Increased rates of &quot;Candida&quot; carriage are also found in people who eat a diet high in carbohydrates, people who wear dentures, people with xerostomia (dry mouth), in people taking broad spectrum antibiotics, smokers, and in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., due to HIV/AIDS, diabetes, cancer, Down syndrome or malnutrition). Age also influences oral carriage, with the lowest levels occurring in newborns, increasing dramatically in infants, and then decreasing again in adults. Investigations have quantified oral carriage of &quot;Candida albicans&quot; at 300-500 colony forming units in healthy persons. More &quot;Candida&quot; is detected in the early morning and the late afternoon. The greatest quantity of &quot;Candida&quot; species are harbored on the posterior dorsal tongue, followed by the palatal and the buccal mucosae. Mucosa covered by an oral appliance such as a denture harbors significantly more candida species than uncovered mucosa.

When &quot;Candida&quot; species cause lesions - the result of invasion of the host tissues - this is termed candidiasis. Some consider oral candidiasis a change in the normal oral environment rather than an exposure or true &quot;infection&quot; as such. The exact process by which &quot;Candida&quot; species switch from acting as normal oral commensals (saprophytic) state in the carrier to acting as a pathogenic organism (parasitic state) is not completely understood.

Several &quot;Candida&quot; species are polymorphogenic, that is, capable of growing in different forms depending on the environmental conditions. &quot;C. albicans&quot; can appear as a yeast form (blastospores), which is thought to be relatively harmless; and a hyphal form associated with invasion of host tissues. Apart from true hyphae, &quot;Candida&quot; can also form pseudohyphae — elongated filamentous cells, lined end to end. As a general rule, candidiasis presenting with white lesions is mainly caused by &quot;Candida&quot; species in the hyphal form and red lesions by yeast forms. &quot;C. albicans&quot; and &quot;C. dubliniensis&quot; are also capable of forming germ tubes (incipient hyphae) and chlamydospores under the right conditions. &quot;C. albicans&quot; is categorized serologically into A or B serotypes. The prevalence is roughly equal in healthy individuals, but type B is more prevalent in immunocompromised individuals.

===Predisposing factors===

The host defenses against opportunistic infection of candida species are
* The oral epithelium, which acts both as a physical barrier preventing micro-organisms from entering the tissues, and is the site of cell mediated immune reactions.
* Competition and inhibition interactions between candida species and other micro-organisms in the mouth, such as the many hundreds of different kinds of bacteria.
* Saliva, which possesses both mechanical cleansing action and immunologic action, including salivary immunoglobulin A antibodies, which aggregate candida organisms and prevent them adhering to the epithelial surface; and enzymatic components such as lysozyme, lactoperoxidase and antileukoprotease.

Disruption to any of these local and systemic host defense mechanisms constitutes a potential susceptibility to oral candidiasis, which rarely occurs without predisposing factors. It is often described as being &quot;a disease of the diseased&quot;, occurring in the very young, the very old, or the very sick.

====Immunodeficiency====
Immunodeficiency is a state of reduced function of the immune system, which can be caused by medical conditions or treatments.

Acute pseudomembranous candidiasis occurs in about 5% of newborn infants. Candida species are acquired from the mother&#x27;s vaginal canal during birth. At very young ages, the immune system is yet to develop fully and there is no individual immune response to candida species, an infants antibodies to the fungus are normally supplied by the mother&#x27;s breast milk.

Other forms of immunodeficiency which may cause oral candidiasis include HIV/AIDS, active cancer and treatment, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

Corticosteroid medications may contribute to the appearance of oral candidiasis, as they cause suppression of immune function either systemically or on a local/mucosal level, depending on the route of administration. Topically administered corticosteroids in the mouth may take the form of mouthwashes, dissolving lozenges or mucosal gels; sometimes being used to treat various forms of stomatitis. Systemic corticosteroids may also result in candidiasis.

Inhaled corticosteroids (e.g., for treatment of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), are not intended to be administered topically in the mouth, but inevitably there is contact with the oral and oropharyngeal mucousa as it is inhaled. In asthmatics treated with inhaled steroids, clinically detectable oral candidiasis may occur in about 5-10% of adults and 1% of children. Where inhaled steroids are the cause, the candidal lesions are usually of the erythematous variety. Candidiasis appears at the sites where the steroid has contacted the mucosa, typically the dorsum of the tongue (median rhomboid glossitis) and sometimes also on the palate. Candidal lesions on both sites are sometimes termed &quot;kissing lesions&quot; because they approximate when the tongue is in contact with the palate.

====Denture wearing====
Denture wearing and poor denture hygiene, particularly wearing the denture continually rather than removing it during sleep, is another risk factor for both candidal carriage and oral candidiasis. Dentures provide a relative acidic, moist and anaerobic environment because the mucosa covered by the denture is sheltered from oxygen and saliva. Loose, poorly fitting dentures may also cause minor trauma to the mucosa, which is thought to increase the permeability of the mucosa and increase the ability of &quot;C. albicans&quot; to invade the tissues. These conditions all favor the growth of &quot;C. albicans&quot;. Sometimes dentures become very worn, or they have been constructed to allow insufficient lower facial height (occlusal vertical dimension), leading to over-closure of the mouth (an appearance sometimes described as &quot;collapse of the jaws&quot;). This causes deepening of the skin folds at the corners of the mouth (nasolabial crease), in effect creating intertriginous areas where another form of candidiasis, angular cheilitis, can develop. Candida species are capable of adhering to the surface of dentures, most of which are made from polymethylacrylate. They exploit micro-fissures and cracks in the surface of dentures to aid their retention. Dentures may therefore become covered in a biofilm, and act as reservoirs of infection, continually re-infecting the mucosa. For this reason, disinfecting the denture is a vital part of treatment of oral candidiasis in persons who wear dentures, as well as correcting other factors like inadequate lower facial height and fit of the dentures.

====Dry mouth====
Both the quantity and quality of saliva are important oral defenses against candida. Decreased salivary flow rate or a change in the composition of saliva, collectively termed salivary hypofunction or hyposalivation is an important predisposing factor. Xerostomia is frequently listed as a cause of candidiasis, but xerostomia can be subjective or objective, i.e., a symptom present with or without actual changes in the saliva consistency or flow rate.

====Diet====
Malnutrition, whether by malabsorption, or poor diet, especially hematinic deficiencies (iron, vitamin B12, folic acid) can predispose to oral candidiasis, by causing diminished host defense and epithelial integrity. For example, iron deficiency anemia is thought to cause depressed cell-mediated immunity. Some sources state that deficiencies of vitamin A or pyridoxine are also linked.

There is limited evidence that a diet high in carbohydrates predisposes to oral candidiasis. &quot;In vitro&quot; and studies show that Candidal growth, adhesion and biofilm formation is enhanced by the presence of carbohydrates such as glucose, galactose and sucrose.

====Smoking====
Smoking, especially heavy smoking, is an important predisposing factor but the reasons for this relationship are unknown. One hypothesis is that cigarette smoke contains nutritional factors for &quot;C. albicans&quot;, or that local epithelial alterations occur that facilitate colonization of candida species.

====Antibiotics====
Broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g. tetracycline) eliminate the competing bacteria and disrupt the normally balanced ecology of oral microorganisms, which can cause antibiotic-induced candidiasis.

====Other factors====
Several other factors can contribute to infection, including endocrine disorders (e.g. diabetes when poorly controlled), and/or the presence of certain other mucosal lesions, especially those that cause hyperkeratosis and/or dysplasia (e.g. lichen planus). Such changes in the mucosa predispose it to secondary infection with candidiasis. Other physical mucosal alterations are sometimes associated with candida overgrowth, such as fissured tongue (rarely), tongue piercing, atopy, and/or hospitalization.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis can typically be made from the clinical appearance alone, but not always. As candidiasis can be variable in appearance, and present with white, red or combined white and red lesions, the differential diagnosis can be extensive. In pseudomembraneous candidiasis, the membranous slough can be wiped away to reveal an erythematous surface underneath. This is helpful in distinguishing pseudomembraneous candidiasis from other white lesions in the mouth that cannot be wiped away, such as lichen planus, oral hairy leukoplakia. Erythematous candidiasis can mimic geographic tongue. Erythematous candidiasis usually has a diffuse border that helps distinguish it from erythroplakia, which normally has a sharply defined border.

Special investigations to detect the presence of candida species include oral swabs, oral rinse or oral smears. Smears are collected by gentle scraping of the lesion with a spatula or tongue blade and the resulting debris directly applied to a glass slide. Oral swabs are taken if culture is required. Some recommend that swabs be taken from 3 different oral sites. Oral rinse involves rinsing the mouth with phosphate-buffered saline for 1 minute and then spitting the solution into a vessel that examined in a pathology laboratory. Oral rinse technique can distinguish between commensal candidal carriage and candidiasis. If candidal leukoplakia is suspected, a biopsy may be indicated. Smears and biopsies are usually stained with periodic acid-Schiff, which stains carbohydrates in fungal cell walls in magenta. Gram staining is also used as Candida stains are strongly Gram positive.

Sometimes an underlying medical condition is sought, and this may include blood tests for full blood count and hematinics.

If a biopsy is taken, the histopathologic appearance can be variable depending upon the clinical type of candidiasis. Pseudomembranous candidiasis shows hyperplastic epithelium with a superficial parakeratotic desquamating (i.e., separating) layer. Hyphae penetrate to the depth of the stratum spinosum, and appear as weakly basophilic structures. Polymorphonuclear cells also infiltrate the epithelium, and chronic inflammatory cells infiltrate the lamina propria.

Atrophic candidiasis appears as thin, atrophic epithelium, which is non-keratinized. Hyphae are sparse, and inflammatory cell infiltration of the epithelium and the lamina propria. In essence, atrophic candidiasis appears like pseudomembranous candidiasis without the superficial desquamating layer.

Hyperplastic candidiasis is variable. Usually there is hyperplastic and acanthotic epithelium with parakeratosis. There is an inflammatory cell infiltrate and hyphae are visible. Unlike other forms of candidiasis, hyperplastic candidiasis may show dysplasia.

==Treatment==
Oral candidiasis can be treated with topical anti-fungal drugs, such as nystatin, miconazole, Gentian violet or amphotericin B. Surgical excision of the lesions may be required in cases that do not respond to anti-fungal medications.

Underlying immunosuppression may be medically manageable once it is identified, and this helps prevent recurrence of candidal infections.

Patients who are immunocompromised, either with HIV/AIDS or as a result of chemotherapy, may require systemic prevention or treatment with oral or intravenous administered anti-fungals. However, there is strong evidence that drugs that are absorbed or partially absorbed from the GI tract can prevent candidiasis more effectively than drugs that are not absorbed in the same way.

If candidiasis is secondary to corticosteroid or antibiotic use, then use may be stopped, although this is not always a feasible option. Candidiasis secondary to the use of inhaled steroids may be treated by rinsing out the mouth with water after taking the steroid. Use of a spacer device to reduce the contact with the oral mucosa may greatly reduce the risk of oral candidiasis.

In recurrent oral candidiasis, the use of azole antifungals risks selection and enrichment of drug-resistant strains of candida organisms. Drug resistance is increasingly more common and presents a serious problem in persons who are immunocompromised.

Prophylactic use of antifungals is sometimes employed in persons with HIV disease, during radiotherapy, during immunosuppressive or prolonged antibiotic therapy as the development of candidal infection in these groups may be more serious.

The candidal load in the mouth can be reduced by improving oral hygiene measures, such as regular toothbrushing and use of anti-microbial mouthwashes. Since smoking is associated with many forms of oral candidiasis, cessation may be beneficial.

===Denture hygiene===

Good denture hygiene involves regular cleaning of the dentures, and leaving them out of the mouth during sleep. This gives the mucosa a chance to recover, while wearing a denture during sleep is often likened to sleeping in one&#x27;s shoes. In oral candidiasis, the dentures may act as a reservoir of Candida species known as denture stomatitis which continually reinfects the mucosa once antifungal medication is stopped. Therefore, they must be disinfected as part of the treatment for oral candidiasis. There are commercial denture cleaner preparations for this purpose, but it is readily accomplished by soaking the denture overnight in a 1:10 solution of sodium hypochlorite (Milton, or household bleach). Bleach may corrode metal components, so if the denture contains metal, soaking it twice daily in chlorhexidine solution can be carried out instead. An alternative method of disinfection is to use a 10% solution of acetic acid (vinegar) as an overnight soak, or to microwave the dentures in 200mL water for 3 minutes at 650 watts. Microwave sterilization is only suitable if no metal components are present in the denture. Antifungal medication can also be applied to the fitting surface of the denture before it is put back in the mouth. Other problems with the dentures, such as inadequate occlusal vertical dimension may also need to be corrected in the case of angular cheilitis.

==Prognosis==

The severity of oral candidiasis is subject to great variability from one person to another and in the same person from one occasion to the next. The prognosis of such infection is usually excellent after the application of topical or systemic treatments. However, oral candidiasis can be recurrent. Individuals continue to be at risk of the condition if underlying factors such as reduced salivary flow rate or immunosuppression are not rectifiable.

Candidiasis can be a marker for underlying disease, so the overall prognosis may also be dependent upon this. For example, a transient erythematous candidiasis that developed after antibiotic therapy usually resolves after antibiotics are stopped (but not always immediately), and therefore carries an excellent prognosis—but candidiasis may occasionally be a sign of more sinister undiagnosed pathology, such as HIV/AIDS or leukemia.

It is possible for candidiasis to spread to/from the mouth, from sites such as the pharynx, esophagus, lungs, liver, anogenital region, skin or the nails. The spread of oral candidiasis to other sites usually occurs in debilitated individuals. It is also possible that candidiasis is spread by sexual contact. Rarely, a superficial candidal infection such as oral candidiasis can cause invasive candidiasis, and even prove fatal. The observation that Candida species are normally harmless commensals on the one hand, but are also occasionally capable of causing fatal invasive candidiases, has led to the description &quot;Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;.

The role of thrush in the hospital and ventilated patients is not entirely clear, however, there is a theoretical risk of positive interaction of candida with topical bacteria.

==Epidemiology==
In humans, oral candidiasis is the most common form of candidiasis, by far the most common fungal infection of the mouth, and it also represents the most common opportunistic oral infection in humans with lesions only occurring when the environment favors pathogenic behavior.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis is common during cancer care, and it is a very common oral sign in individuals with HIV. Oral candidiasis occurs in about two thirds of people with concomitant AIDS and esophageal candidiasis.

The incidence of all forms of candidiasis have increased in recent decades. This is due to developments in medicine, with more invasive medical procedures and surgeries, more widespread use of broad spectrum antibiotics and immunosuppression therapies. The HIV/AIDs global pandemic has been the greatest factor in the increased incidence of oral candidiasis since the 1980s. The incidence of candidiasis caused by NCAC species is also increasing, again thought to be due to changes in medical practise (e.g., organ transplantation and use of indwelling catheters).

==History==
Oral candidiasis has been recognized throughout recorded history. The first description of this condition is thought to have occurred in the 4th century B.C. in &quot;Epidemics&quot; (a treatise that is part of the hippocratic corpus), where descriptions of what sounds like oral candidiasis are stated to occur with severe underlying disease.

The colloquial term &quot;thrush&quot; is of unknown origin but may stem from an unrecorded Old English word *þrusc or from a Scandinavian root. The term is not related to the bird of the same name.

==Society and culture==
Many pseudoscientific claims by proponents of alternative medicine surround the topic of candidiasis. Oral candidiasis is sometimes presented in this manner as a symptom of a widely prevalent &quot;systemic candidiasis&quot;, &quot;candida hypersensitivity syndrome&quot;, &quot;yeast allergy&quot;, or &quot;gastrointestinal candida overgrowth&quot;, which are medically unrecognized conditions.

<doc id="878899" wikidata="Q738550" url="?curid=878899" title="USNS Comfort">
<text>USNS &quot;Comfort&quot; (T-AH-20) is a of the United States Navy.

&quot;Comfort&quot;″s duties include providing emergency, on-site care for U.S. combatant forces deployed in war or other operations. Operated by the Military Sealift Command, &quot;Comfort&quot; provides rapid, flexible, and mobile medical and surgical services to support Marine Corps Air-Ground Task Forces and Army and Air Force units deployed ashore, and naval amphibious task forces and battle forces afloat. Secondarily, she provides mobile surgical hospital service for use by appropriate U.S. government agencies in disaster or humanitarian relief or limited humanitarian care incident to these missions or peacetime military operations. &quot;Comfort&quot; is more advanced than a field hospital but less capable than a traditional hospital on land.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert Little / The Baltimore Sun&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

From 30 March to 30 April 2020, &quot;Comfort&quot; was stationed in New York City to help combat the city&#x27;s coronavirus pandemic by treating non-coronavirus, and later on, coronavirus-positive patients. She had been stationed there previously following the attacks of 9/11 in 2001, to bolster the city&#x27;s civilian medical services in the aftermath.

== Complement ==
The USNS prefix identifies &quot;Comfort&quot; as a non-commissioned ship owned by the U.S. Navy and operationally crewed by civilians from the Military Sealift Command (MSC). A uniformed naval hospital staff and naval support staff is embarked when the &quot;Comfort&quot; is deployed, consisting primarily of naval officers from the Navy&#x27;s Medical Corps, Dental Corps, Medical Service Corps, Nurse Corps, and Chaplain Corps, and naval enlisted personnel from the Hospital Corpsman rating and various administrative and technical support ratings (e.g., Yeoman, Personnel Specialist, Information Systems Technician, Religious Program Specialist, etc.).

In accordance with the Geneva Conventions, &quot;Comfort&quot; and her crew carry no offensive weapons. Firing upon &quot;Comfort&quot; would be considered a war crime as the ship only carries weapons for self-defense. In keeping with her status as a non-combatant vessel, naval personnel from the combat specialties are not assigned as regular crew or staff. Underway embarks by Navy Unrestricted Line officers (e.g., warfare qualified combat specialties), enlisted Naval Aviation, Surface Warfare, Submarine Warfare, Special Operations or Special Warfare/SEAL personnel, or any Marine Corps officers or enlisted personnel, are typically limited to official visits, helicopter or tilt-rotor flight operations or as patients.

==Construction and conversion==

Like her sister ship , &quot;Comfort&quot; was built as a oil tanker in 1976 by the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company. Her original name was SS &quot;Rose City&quot; and she was launched from San Diego, California. She is the third United States Navy ship to bear the name &quot;Comfort,&quot; and the second &quot;Mercy&quot;-class hospital ship. Her career as an oil tanker ended when she was delivered to the U.S. Navy on 1 December 1987.

After a quarter-century in Baltimore, Maryland, &quot;Comfort&quot; changed her homeport to Naval Station Norfolk in Norfolk, Virginia in March 2013. The move placed the ship closer to supplies, much of which come from Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, and to medical crew. Savings to the U.S. Navy are estimated at $2 million per year.

==Deployments==
===Persian Gulf War (1990–91)===

During the Gulf War, &quot;Comfort&quot; received a call to activate for Desert Shield/Desert Storm 9 August 1990 and left Baltimore on 11 August. &quot;Comfort&quot; took station just off the coast of Saudi Arabia near Khafji and Kuwait. On 12 March 1991, &quot;Comfort&quot; headed home, arriving in Baltimore on 15 April 1991. She had traveled more than and consumed almost of fuel. More than 8,000 outpatients were seen, and 700 inpatients were admitted, including four sailors injured in a high-pressure steam leak on . 337 surgical procedures were performed. Other notable benchmarks include: more than 2,100 safe helicopter activities; 7,000 prescriptions filled; 17,000 laboratory tests completed; 1,600 eyeglasses made; 800,000 meals served and 1,340 radiographic studies, including 141 CT scans.

===Operation Sea Signal (1994)===
In 1994, &quot;Comfort&quot; was ordered to serve as a processing center for Haitian migrants, the first ship to act as such a center. She set out for the Caribbean with 928 military and civilian personnel from various federal government and international agencies. On 16 June 1994 the first Haitian migrants were taken aboard. Over the months, her population swelled to 1,100. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Comfort&quot; sailed for Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, to drop off the remaining 400 migrants.

===Operation Uphold Democracy (1994)===

On 2 September 1994, &quot;Comfort&quot; was directed to activate for an unprecedented second deployment in a year. &quot;Comfort&quot; was tasked to provide a 250-bed medically intensive patient capability for the 35,000 Cuban and Haitian migrants supported by Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. &quot;Comfort&quot; departed Naval Base Norfolk, Virginia, with a specially configured crew of 566 personnel. Following the diplomatic agreement reached between the United States and Haiti, &quot;Comfort&quot; took up a position off Port-au-Prince ready to receive casualties that might result from the transfer of U.S. and allied forces ashore. From 16 September through 2 October 1994, &quot;Comfort&quot; personnel provided both medical and surgical support to U.S. and allied forces ashore and afloat, emergency humanitarian care to injured Haitian citizens, and participated in various aspects of the Civil Affairs Program in an effort to aid the rebuilding effort of the local healthcare system. She returned to Norfolk on 14 October 1994.

===Operation Noble Eagle (2001)===
&quot;Comfort&quot; was activated the afternoon of 11 September 2001, in response to the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and sailed the next afternoon to serve as a 250-bed hospital facility at Pier 92 in midtown Manhattan. The ship arrived at Pier 92 in Manhattan about 8:30 p.m. 14 September. That evening a small number of relief workers arrived aboard the ship. As word about the ship spread, more workers began arriving over the next few days. The ship&#x27;s clinic saw 561 guests for cuts, respiratory ailments, fractures, and other minor injuries, and &quot;Comfort&quot;″s team of Navy psychology personnel provided 500 mental health consultations to relief workers. &quot;Comfort&quot; also hosted a group of volunteer New York area massage therapists who gave 1,359 therapeutic medical massages to ship guests.

===Iraq War (2002–03)===

&quot;Comfort&quot; was ordered to activate on 26 December 2002, and set sail for the U.S. Central Command area of operations on 6 January 2003. After stopping in Diego Garcia to embark additional medical personnel flown in from the National Naval Medical Center, the ship proceeded to the Persian Gulf to serve as an afloat trauma center in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. &quot;Comfort&quot; remained in the Persian Gulf for 56 days providing expert medical care to wounded U.S. military personnel as well as injured Iraqi civilians and enemy prisoners of war. When &quot;Comfort&quot; returned to Baltimore on 12 June 2003, it marked the completion of a nearly six-month activation. During this time, the ship conducted more than 800 helicopter deck landings to bring aboard personnel, patients, and cargo. &quot;Comfort&quot;″s Medical Treatment Facility had also performed 590 surgical procedures, transfused more than 600 units of blood, developed more than 8,000 radiographic images, and treated nearly 700 patients, including almost 200 Iraqi civilians and enemy prisoners of war.

===Hurricane Katrina (2005)===

&quot;Comfort&quot; deployed on 2 September 2005, after only a two-day preparation, to assist in Gulf Coast recovery efforts after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. Starting in Pascagoula, Mississippi and then sailing to New Orleans, &quot;Comfort&quot; personnel saw 1,956 patients total. She returned on 13 October 2005 after a 7-week deployment.

===Partnership for the Americas (2007)===
&quot;Comfort&quot;″s Partnership for the Americas humanitarian mission, which began on 15 June 2007, was a major component of the President&#x27;s &quot;Advancing the Cause of Social Justice in the Western Hemisphere&quot; initiative. &quot;Comfort&quot; visited 12 Central American, South American, and Caribbean nations where her embarked medical crew provided free health care services to communities in need. The missions objective was to offer valuable training to U.S. military personnel while promoting U.S. goodwill in the region. In all, the civilian and military medical team treated more than 98,000 patients, provided 386,000 patient encounters and performed 1,100 surgeries.
The embarked medical crew was made up of more than 500 military and non-governmental organization (Project Hope and Operation Smile) doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals. Their primary focus was to support medical humanitarian assistance efforts ashore. A secondary mission was outpatient shipboard health service support.
Also supporting &quot;Comfort&quot;″s medical mission was a SEABEE detachment from the East Coast-based Mobile Construction Battalion Maintenance Unit 202, which performed civic action repair and minor construction projects in the host countries. Also on the deployment was the U.S. Navy Showband from Norfolk, Virginia, which performed in each port.

&quot;Comfort&quot; was operated and navigated by a crew of 68 civil service mariners (CIVMARS) from the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Military Sealift Command (MSC).
This mission incorporated various non-government organizations and government agencies, such as Operation Smile, Project Hope, LDS Humanitarian Services, the Atlanta Rotary Club, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army, U.S. Health and Human Services and the Canadian Armed Forces.
Patient encounters included a single patient receiving multiple treatments, students in training sessions, and even veterinary care services.
Dentists and staff treated 25,000 patients, extracting 300 teeth, and performing 4,000 fillings, 7,000 sealings, and 20,000 fluoride applications. In addition to treating patients, bio-medical professionals fixed about a thousand pieces of medical equipment at local health facilities. The ship&#x27;s crew also delivered nearly $200,000 worth of donated humanitarian aid.

===Operation Unified Response (2010)===
On 13 January 2010, &quot;Comfort&quot; was ordered to assist in the humanitarian relief efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake as part of Operation Unified Response. Three days later on 16 January &quot;Comfort&quot; left the Port of Baltimore bound for Haiti. She arrived Wednesday, 20 January 2010 and began medical treatment early that day. The deployment marks the first time the ship has reached full operational capacity, utilizing all 12 operating rooms and 1,000 beds, since she was delivered to the Navy in 1987. The mission also saw the ship&#x27;s first on-board delivery, of a 4-pound, 5-ounce premature baby named Esther. Although the ship is less capable than a traditional hospital on land, she offered the most advanced medical care available in Haiti following the earthquake.
Between 19 January and 28 February 2010 the ship&#x27;s staff treated 1,000 Haitian patients and performed 850 surgeries. By 8 March 2010, &quot;Comfort&quot; had discharged the last patient. On 10 March 2010, the ship ended her mission in the Joint Task Force Haiti area as part of Operation Unified Response, and returned to her home port.

===Operation Continuing Promise (2011)===
In 2011, the ship deployed on Operation Continuing Promise. The ship deployed for five months providing medical and surgical services to nine locations in the Caribbean and Latin America – Jamaica, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Haiti. The ship&#x27;s crew set up medical and surgical civil action program sites. These temporary medical clinics included primary care, internal medicine, obstetrics, and pediatric physicians as well as optometry, physical therapy, dental, radiology, laboratory, and pharmacy services. On board the ship general surgery, ophthalmology, oral and maxillofacial, and orthopedic surgeries were performed on pre-screened patients.

The mission included a Navy SeaBee (Construction Battalion) Unit, a Navy helo squadron, the United States Navy Band and a Navy Security Force unit. US Army veterinarians and veterinary technicians, US Air Force biomedical repair technicians, and dentists and dental technicians from the Canadian Navy also participated.

Although it was primarily a medical/humanitarian mission, several programs and projects, commonly referred to as Community Relations (COMREL) projects were also provided to the local populace throughout the mission. Veterinarians worked with local farmers on pest control and vaccinations, SeaBees completed building improvements in local schools and other facilities, Navy Band was a staple in all programs involving US military personnel and local government officials.

===Hurricane Maria (2017)===
On 29 September 2017, the ship set sail for Puerto Rico to bring assistance to the island after Hurricane Maria had hit it nine days earlier. She arrived the evening of 3 October 2017. While in San Juan, &quot;Comfort&quot; hosted a summit with key stakeholders to synchronize efforts for the ship&#x27;s mission throughout the area. The ship&#x27;s 835 personnel partnered with Federal DMAT teams DMAT/&quot;COMFORT&quot; partnership and evaluated 6,003 patients, 1,912 patients were sent to &quot;Comfort&quot; 290 patients admitted, and 192 surgeries performed. She provided over 40,000 lab tests, over 16,000 prescriptions, 343 CT scans, and 1,169 radiology studies. Dental services provided acute dental care for 312 patients. However, she was there to support the sickest patients on the island. &quot;Comfort&quot;″s 50-bed ICU had the highest acuity patients of any military hospital in the world. The ship acted as a support structure for all the islands hospitals taking their sickest ICU patients, the only oxygen producing plant on the island, she filled every hospital&#x27;s oxygen tanks to help them support their patients. Additionally her sterilizers were used to sterilize, clean, and wrap surgery kits for multiple hospitals, using her ability to be a force multiplier allowing other hospitals to continue to provide care, and surgeries while they stabilized their power and facilities. She provided life saving care, including dialysis as well as fixed dialysis shunts and placed portacath shunts as the only working interventional radiology capability. This along with partnering with Puerto Rico&#x27;s Health Department was able to diagnose cancers and assist in getting patients started on cancer therapy. She even had two births on board after receiving mothers who had been in labor in hallways for days. Her skilled providers provided necessary orthopedic surgeries, provided CT scans for her patients or ones referred from one of the other over 60 hospitals on island. This was at a cost of about $180,000 a day. As the island infrastructure improved the admission rate to the ship declined to 1% of patients presenting, she was ordered home on 17 November.

=== Operation Enduring Promise (2018) ===
In October 2018, &quot;Comfort&quot; departed for an eleven-week operation in Latin America, with a primary mission being to assist countries that received refugees who fled the crisis in Venezuela. The main goal was to relieve health systems in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Honduras, which faced the arrival of thousands of Venezuelan migrants. She provided care for nearly 27,000 patients and performed 599 surgeries in 23 clinical days in five stops in four countries.

=== New York COVID-19 response (2020) ===
&quot;Comfort&quot; began deployment from Norfolk, Virginia, to New York Harbor on 28 March to help deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. &quot;Comfort&quot; arrived in New York on 30 March 2020. Initially, her mission was to treat patients who did not have the virus, freeing up land-based hospitals to focus on patients with COVID-19. But later half of the ship&#x27;s 1000 beds were removed so that she could isolate and treat coronavirus patients. On 6 April 2020, COVID-19 patients were allowed onto the ship. One day later, the Navy announced that one crew member aboard &quot;Comfort&quot; had tested positive for the coronavirus and that several other crew members were put into isolation.

On 17 April the U.S. Northern Command announced that &quot;the USNS &quot;COMFORT&quot; is prepared to admit patients within a one-hour traveling radius from the ship&quot;, and preparations were made to receive coronavirus patients from the Philadelphia area. On 21 April, Governor Andrew Cuomo told President Donald Trump that the ship was no longer needed in New York. &quot;Comfort&quot; departed on 30 April, having treated 179 patients.

<text>Oral leukoplakia is a potentially malignant disorder affecting the oral mucosa. It is defined as &quot;essentially an oral mucosal white/gray lesion that cannot be considered as any other definable lesion.&quot; Oral leukoplakia is a gray patch or plaque that develops in the oral cavity and is strongly associated with smoking. Leukoplakia is a firmly attached white patch on a mucous membrane which is associated with increased risk of cancer. The edges of the lesion are typically abrupt and the lesion changes with time. Advanced forms may develop red patches. There are generally no other symptoms. It usually occurs within the mouth, although sometimes mucosa in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, or genitals may be affected.
The cause of leukoplakia is unknown. Risk factors for formation inside the mouth include smoking, chewing tobacco, excessive alcohol, and use of betel nuts. One specific type is common in HIV/AIDS. It is a precancerous lesion, a tissue alteration in which cancer is more likely to develop. The chance of cancer formation depends on the type, with between 3–15% of localized leukoplakia and 70–100% of proliferative leukoplakia developing into squamous cell carcinoma.
Leukoplakia is a descriptive term that should only be applied after other possible causes are ruled out. Tissue biopsy generally shows increased keratin build up with or without abnormal cells, but is not diagnostic. Other conditions that can appear similar include yeast infections, lichen planus, and keratosis due to repeated minor trauma. The lesions from a yeast infection can typically be rubbed off while those of leukoplakia cannot.
Treatment recommendations depend on features of the lesion. If abnormal cells are present or the lesion is small surgical removal is often recommended; otherwise close follow up at three to six month intervals may be sufficient. People are generally advised to stop smoking and limit the drinking of alcohol. In potentially half of cases leukoplakia will shrink with stopping smoking; however, if smoking is continued up to 66% of cases will become more white and thick. The percentage of people affected is estimated at 1–3%. Leukoplakia becomes more common with age, typically not occurring until after 30. Rates may be as high as 8% in men over the age of 70.
==Classification==


Leukoplakia could be classified as mucosal disease, and also as a premalignant condition. Although the white color in leukoplakia is a result of hyperkeratosis (or acanthosis), similarly appearing white lesions that are caused by reactive keratosis (smoker&#x27;s keratosis or frictional keratoses e.g. morsicatio buccarum) are not considered to be leukoplakias. Leukoplakia could also be considered according to the affected site, e.g. oral leukoplakia, leukoplakia of the urinary tract, including bladder leukoplakia or leukoplakia of the penis, vulvae, cervix or vagina. Leukoplakia may also occur in the larynx, possibly in association with gastro-esophageal reflux disease. Oropharyngeal leukoplakia is linked to the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and sometimes this is associated with tylosis, which is thickening of the skin on the palms and soles of the feet (see: Leukoplakia with tylosis and esophageal carcinoma). Dyskeratosis congenita may be associated with leukoplakia of the oral mucosa and of the anal mucosa.

===Mouth===
Within the mouth, leukoplakia is sometimes further classified according to the site involved, e.g. leukoplakia buccalis (leukoplakia of the buccal mucosa) or leukoplakia lingualis (leukoplakia of the lingual mucosa). There are two main clinical variants of oral leukoplakia, namely homogeneous leukoplakia and non-homogeneous (heterogenous) leukoplakia, which are described below. The word leukoplakia is also included within the nomenclature of other oral conditions which present as white patches, however, these are specific diagnoses that are generally considered separate from leukoplakia, with the notable exception of proliferative verrucous leukoplakia, which is a recognized sub-type of leukoplakia.

====Homogeneous leukoplakia====
Homogeneous leukoplakia (also termed &quot;thick leukoplakia&quot;) is usually well defined white patch of uniform, flat appearance and texture, although there may be superficial irregularities. Homogeneous leukoplakia is usually slightly elevated compared to surrounding mucosa, and often has a fissured, wrinkled or corrugated surface texture, with the texture generally consistent throughout the whole lesion. This term has no implications on the size of the lesion, which may be localized or extensive. When homogeneous leukoplakia is palpated, it may feel leathery, dry, or like cracked mud.

====Non-homogeneous leukoplakia====
Non-homogeneous leukoplakia is a lesion of non-uniform appearance. The color may be predominantly white or a mixed white and red. The surface texture is irregular compared to homogeneous leukoplakia, and may be flat (papular), nodular or . &quot;Verrucous leukoplakia&quot; (or &quot;verruciform leukoplakia&quot;) is a descriptive term used for thick, white, papillary lesions. Verrucous leukoplakias are usually heavily keratinized and are often seen in elderly people. Some verrucous leukoplakias may have an exophytic growth pattern, and some may slowly invade surrounding mucosa, when the term proliferative verrucous leukoplakia may be used. Non-homogeneous leukoplakias have a greater risk of cancerous changes than homogeneous leukoplakias.

=====Proliferative verrucous leukoplakia=====
Proliferative verrucous leukoplakia (PVL) is a recognized high risk subtype of non-homogeneous leukoplakia. It is uncommon, and usually involves the buccal mucosa and the gingiva (the gums). This condition is characterized by (usually) extensive, papillary or verrucoid keratotic plaques that tends to slowly enlarge into adjacent mucosal sites. An established PVL lesion is usually thick and exophytic (prominent), but initially it may be flat. Smoking does not seem to be as strongly related as it is to leukoplakia generally, and another dissimilarity is the preponderance for women over 50. There is a very high risk of dysplasia, transformation to squamous cell carcinoma with high mortality (PVL does not transform into verrucous carcinoma, which is a lesion with a good prognosis usually; the similarity of names does not reflect the common origin, but only the resemblance of their appearance).

=====Erythroleukoplakia=====

Erythroleukoplakia (also termed speckled leukoplakia, erythroleukoplasia or leukoerythroplasia) is a non-homogeneous lesion of mixed white (keratotic) and red (atrophic) color. Erythroplakia (erythroplasia) is an entirely red patch that cannot be attributed to any other cause. Erythroleukoplakia can therefore be considered a variant of either leukoplakia or erythroplakia since its appearance is midway between. Erythroleukoplakia frequently occurs on the buccal mucosa in the commissural area (just inside the cheek at the corners of the mouth) as a mixed lesion of white nodular patches on an erythematous background, although any part of the mouth may be affected. Erythroleukoplakia and erythroplakia have a higher risk of cancerous changes than homogeneous leukoplakia.

====Sublingual keratosis====

Sometimes leukoplakia of the floor of mouth or under the tongue is called &quot;sublingual keratosis&quot;. though this is not universally accepted to be a distinct clinical entity from idiopathic leukoplakia generally, as it is distinguished from the latter by location only. Usually sublingual keratoses are bilateral and possess a parallel-corrugated, wrinkled surface texture described as &quot;ebbing tide&quot;.

====Candidal leukoplakia====
Candidal leukoplakia is usually considered to be a largely historical synonym for a type of oral candidiasis, now more commonly termed &quot;chronic hyperplastic candidiasis&quot;, rather than a subtype of true leukoplakia. However, some sources use this term to refer to leukoplakia lesions that become colonized secondarily by Candida species, thereby distinguishing it from hyperplastic candidiasis.

====Oral hairy leukoplakia====
Oral hairy leukoplakia is a corrugated (&quot;hairy&quot;) white lesion on the sides of the tongue caused by opportunistic infection with Epstein-Barr virus on a systemic background of immunodeficiency, almost always human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This condition is not considered to be a true idiopathic leukoplakia since the causative agent has been identified. It is one of the most common oral lesions associated with HIV infection, along with pseudomembraneous candidiasis. The appearance of the lesion often heralds the transition from HIV to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

====Syphilitic leukoplakia====
This term refers to a white lesion associated with syphilis, specifically in the tertiary stage of the infection. It is not considered to be a type of idiopathic leukoplakia, since the causative agent &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; is known. It is now rare, but when syphilis was more common, this white patch usually appeared on the top surface of the tongue and carried a high risk of cancerous changes. It is unclear if this lesion was related to the condition itself or whether it was caused by the treatments for syphilis at the time.

===Esophagus===
Leukoplakia of the esophagus is rare compared to oral leukoplakia. The relationship with esophageal cancer is unclear because the incidence of esophageal leukoplakia is so low. It usually appears as a small, nearly opaque white lesion that may resemble early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The histologic appearance is similar to oral leukoplakia, with hyperkeratosis and possible dysplasia.

===Bladder===
In the context of lesions of the mucous membrane lining of the bladder, &quot;leukoplakia&quot; is a historic term for a visualized white patch which histologically represents keratinization in an area of squamous metaplasia. The symptoms may include frequency, suprapubic pain (pain felt above the pubis), hematuria (blood in the urine), dysuria (difficult urination or pain during urination), urgency, and urge incontinence. The white lesion may be seen during cystoscopy, where it appears as a whitish-gray or yellow lesion, on a background of inflamed urothelium and there may be floating debris in the bladder. Leukoplakia of the bladder may undergo cancerous changes, so biopsy and long term follow up are usually indicated.

===Anal canal===

Leukoplakia of the anal canal is rare. It may extend up to the anorectal junction. On digital examination it feels hard and granular, and at proctoscopy, it appears as white plaques which may be diffuse, circumferential, or circumscribed. The histologic appearance is similar to oral leukoplakia, with hyperkeratosis and acanthosis. It may be asymptomatic, with symptoms due to other lesions such as hemorrhoids or fissures. Progression to anal stenosis has been described. The malignant potential is seemingly low, and few cases of anal carcinoma have been reported associated with anal leukoplaka.

==Signs and symptoms==
Most cases of leukoplakia cause no symptoms, but infrequently there may be discomfort or pain. The exact appearance of the lesion is variable. Leukoplakia may be white, whitish yellow or grey. The size can range from a small area to much larger lesions. The most common sites affected are the buccal mucosa, the labial mucosa and the alveolar mucosa, although any mucosal surface in the mouth may be involved. The clinical appearance, including the surface texture and color, may be homogeneous or non-homogeneous (see: classification). Some signs are generally associated with a higher risk of cancerous changes (see: prognosis).

Leukoplakia may rarely be associated with esophageal carcinoma.

==Causes==
The exact underlying cause of leukoplakia is largely unknown, but it is likely multifactorial, with the main factor being the use of tobacco. Tobacco use and other suggested causes are discussed below. The mechanism of the white appearance is thickening of the keratin layer, called hyperkeratosis. The abnormal keratin appears white when it becomes hydrated by saliva, and light reflects off the surface evenly. This hides the normal pink-red color of mucosae (the result of underlying vasculature showing through the epithelium). A similar situation can be seen on areas of thick skin such as the soles of the feet or the fingers after prolonged immersion in water. Another possible mechanism is thickening of the stratum spinosum, called acanthosis.

===Tobacco===
Tobacco smoking or chewing is the most common causative factor, with more than 80% of persons with leukoplakia having a positive smoking history. Smokers are much more likely to develop leukoplakia than non-smokers. The size and number of leukoplakia lesions in an individual is also correlated with the level of smoking and how long the habit has lasted for. Other sources argue that there is no evidence for a direct causative link between smoking and oral leukoplakia. Cigarette smoking may produce a diffuse leukoplakia of the buccal mucosa, lips, tongue and rarely the floor of mouth. Reverse smoking, where the lit end of the cigarette is held in the mouth is also associated with mucosal changes. Tobacco chewing, e.g. betel leaf and areca nut, called paan, tends to produce a distinctive white patch in a buccal sulcus termed &quot;tobacco pouch keratosis&quot;. In the majority of persons, cessation triggers shrinkage or disappearance of the lesion, usually within the first year after stopping.

===Alcohol===
Although the synergistic effect of alcohol with smoking in the development of oral cancer is beyond doubt, there is no clear evidence that alcohol is involved in the development of leukoplakia, but it does appear to have some influence. Excessive use of a high alcohol-containing mouth wash (&gt; 25%) may cause a grey plaque to form on the buccal mucosa, but these lesions are not considered true leukoplakia.

===Sanguinaria===
Sanguinaria (Bloodroot) is a herbal extract that is included in some toothpastes and mouthwashes. Its use is strongly associated with development of leukoplakia, usually in the buccal sulcus. This type of leukoplakia has been termed &quot;sanguinaria associated keratosis&quot; and more than 80% of people with leukoplakia in the vestibule of the mouth have used this substance. Upon stopping contact with the causative substance, the lesions may persist for many years. Although this type of leukoplakia may show dysplasia, the potential for malignant transformation is unknown.

===Ultraviolet radiation===
Ultraviolet radiation is believed to be a factor in the development of some leukoplakia lesions of the lower lip, usually in association with actinic cheilitis.

===Micro-organisms===
Candida in its pathogenic hyphal form is occasionally seen in biopsies of idiopathic leukoplakia. It is debated whether candida infection is a primary cause of leukoplakia with or without dysplasia, or a superimposed (secondary) infection that occurs after the development of the lesion. It is known that Candida species thrive in altered tissues. Some leukoplakias with dysplasia reduce or disappear entirely following use of antifungal medication. Smoking, which as discussed above can lead to the development of leukoplakia, can also promote oral candidiasis. Candida in association with leukoplakia should not be confused with white patches which are primarily caused by candida infection, such as chronic hyperplastic candidiasis (&quot;candidal leukoplakia&quot;).

The involvement of viruses in the formation of some oral white lesions is well established, e.g. Epstein-Barr virus in oral hairy leukoplakia (which is not a true leukoplakia). Human papilloma virus (HPV), especially HPV 16 and 18, is sometimes found in areas of leukoplakia, however, since this virus can be coincidentally found on normal, healthy mucosal surfaces in the mouth, it is unknown if this virus is involved in the development of some leukoplakias. &quot;In vitro &quot;experimentation has demonstrated that HPV 16 is capable of inducing dysplastic changes in previously normal squamous epithelium.

===Epithelial atrophy===
Leukoplakia is more likely to develop in areas of epithelial atrophy. Conditions associated with mucosal atrophy include iron deficiency, some vitamin deficiencies, oral submucous fibrosis, syphilis and sideropenic dysphagia.

===Trauma===
Another very common cause of white patches in the mouth is frictional or irritational trauma leading to keratosis. Examples include nicotine stomatitis, which is keratosis in response to heat from tobacco smoking (rather than a response to the carcinogens in tobacco smoke). The risk of malignant transformation is similar to normal mucosa. Mechanical trauma, e.g. caused by a sharp edge on a denture, or a broken tooth, may cause white patches which appear very similar to leukoplakia. However, these white patches represent a normal hyperkeratotic reaction, similar to a callus on the skin, and will resolve when the cause is removed. Where there is a demonstrable cause such as mechanical or thermal trauma, the term idiopathic leukoplakia should not be used.

==Pathophysiology==
===Tumor suppressor genes===
Tumor suppressor genes are genes involved in the regulation of normal cell turnover and apoptosis (programmed cell death). One of the most studied tumor suppressor genes is p53, which is found on the short arm of chromosome 17. Mutation of p53 can disrupt its regulatory function and lead to uncontrolled cell growth. Mutations of p53 have been demonstrated in the cells from areas of some leukoplakias, especially those with dysplasia and in individuals who smoke and drink heavily.

===DNA damage===
DNA damage was measured in oral leukoplakia patients using single cell gel electrophoresis (also called the “comet assay”) applied to peripheral blood samples. The level of DNA damage was found to increase in a stepwise manner from healthy controls, through patients with non-dysplastic epithelium to patients with varying grades of dysplasia. In another study, DNA damage, also measured by the comet assay, was found to be greater in oral leukoplakia and squamous-cell carcinoma than in control subjects.

==Diagnosis==
===Definition===
Leukoplakia is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that which lesions are included depends upon what diagnoses are currently considered acceptable. Accepted definitions of leukoplakia have changed over time and are still controversial. It is possible that the definition will be further revised as new knowledge becomes available.
In 1984 an international symposium agreed upon the following definition: &quot;a whitish patch or plaque, which cannot be characterized clinically or pathologically as any other disease, and is not associated with any physical or chemical agent except the use of tobacco.&quot; There were, however, problems and confusion in applying this definition. At a second international symposium held in 1994, it was argued that whilst tobacco was a likely causative factor in the development of leukoplakia, some white patches could be linked directly to the local effects of tobacco by virtue of their disappearance following smoking cessation, suggesting that this kind of white patch represents a reactive lesion to local tissue irritation rather than a lesion caused by carcinogens in cigarette smoke, and could be better termed to reflect this etiology, e.g. smokers&#x27; keratosis. The second international symposium, therefore, revised the definition of leukoplakia to: &quot;a predominantly white lesion of the oral mucosa that cannot be characterized as any other definable lesion.&quot;

In the mouth, the current definition of oral leukoplakia adopted by the World Health Organization is &quot;white plaques of questionable risk having excluded (other) known diseases or disorders that carry no increased risk for cancer&quot;. However, this definition is inconsistently applied in the medical literature, and some refer to any oral white patch as &quot;leukoplakia&quot;.

The term has been incorrectly used for white patches of any cause (rather than specifically referring to idiopathic white patches) and also to refer only to white patches which have a risk of cancerous changes. It has been suggested that &quot;leukoplakia&quot; is an unhelpful term since there is so much inconsistency surrounding its use, and some clinicians now avoid using it at all.

===Biopsy===

Tissue biopsy is usually indicated to rule out other causes of white patches and also to enable a detailed histologic examination to grade the presence of any epithelial dysplasia. This is an indicator of malignant potential and usually determines the management and recall interval. The sites of a leukoplakia lesion that are preferentially biopsied are the areas that show induration (hardening) and erythroplasia (redness), and erosive or ulcerated areas. These areas are more likely to show any dysplasia than homogeneous white areas.

Brush biopsy/exfoliative cytology is an alternative to incisional biopsy, where a stiff brush is scraped against the lining of the mouth to remove a sample of cells. This is then made into a smear which can be examined microscopically. Sometimes the biopsy site can be selected with adjunct methods which aim to highlight areas of dysplasia. Toluidine blue staining, where the dye is preferentially retained by dysplastic tissue, is sometimes used, but there is high false positive rate. Other methods involve the use of luminescence, relying on either the property of normal autoflorescent molecules in mucosa such as collagen and keratin which is lost from areas of dysplasia or carcinoma under blue light or by initially staining of the mucosa with toluidine blue or dilute acetic acid and examination under white light.

===Histologic appearance===
Leukoplakia has a wide range of possible histologic appearances. The degree of hyperkeratosis, epithelial thickness (acanthosis/), dysplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration in the underlying lamina propria are variable. In mucous membranes, hyperkeratosis can be defined as &quot;an increase in the thickness of the keratin layer of the epithelium, or the presence of such a layer in a site where none would normally be expected.&quot; In leukoplakia, the hyperkeratosis varies in thickness and may be either ortho- or para-keratosis, (depending upon whether cell nuclei are lost or retained in the superficial layers respectively), or a mixture of both in different areas of the lesion.

The epithelium may show hypertrophy (e.g. acanthosis) or atrophy. Red areas within leukoplakia represent atrophic or immature epithelium which has lost the ability to keratinize. The transition between the lesion and normal surrounding mucosa may be well-demarcated, or poorly defined. Melanin, a pigment naturally produced in oral mucosa, can leak from cells and give a grey color to some leukoplakia lesions.

Hyperkeratosis and altered epithelial thickness may be the only histologic features of a leukoplakia lesion, but some show dysplasia. The word &quot;dysplasia&quot; generally means &quot;abnormal growth&quot;, and specifically, in the context of oral red or white lesions, refers to microscopic changes (&quot;cellular atypia&quot;) in the mucosa that indicate a risk of malignant transformation. When dysplasia is present, there is generally an inflammatory cell infiltration in the lamina propria. The following are commonly cited as being possible features of epithelial dysplasia in leukoplakia specimens:
* Cellular pleomorphism, in which cells are of abnormal and different shapes.
* Nuclear atypia, in which the nuclei of cells varies in size, any may be increased in size relative to the cytoplasm, shape, and may stain more intensely. There may also be more prominent nucleoli.
* Increased number of cells seen undergoing mitosis, including both normal and abnormal mitoses. Abnormal mitosis may be abnormally located, e.g. occurring in suprabasal cells (cell layers more superficial to the basal cell layer) or of abnormal form, e.g. &quot;tri-radiate mitoses&quot; (a cell splitting into 3 daughter cells rather than only 2)
* Loss the normal organization of the epithelial layers. The distinction between the epithelial layers may be lost. Normally stratified squamous epithelium shows progressive changes in the form of cells from the basal to the superficial layers, with cells becoming more flat (&quot;squames&quot;) towards the surface as a continuous maturation process. In dysplastic epithelium, cells may become vertically orientated rather than becoming flat towards the surface.
* There may be abnormal keratinization, where keratin is formed below the normal keratin layer. This can occur in individual cells or groups of cells, forming an intraepithelial keratin pearl. There may be an increase in the number of basal cells, and they may lose their cellular orientation (losing their polarity and long axis).
* Alteration of the normal epithelial-connective tissue architecture - the rete pegs may become &quot;drop shaped&quot;. wider at their base than more superficially.

Generally, dysplasia is subjectively graded by pathologists into mild, moderate or severe dysplasia. This requires experience as it is a difficult skill to learn. It has been shown that there is high degree of inter-observer variation and poor reproducibility in how dysplasia is graded. Severe dysplasia is synonymous with the term carcinoma in situ, denoting the presence of neoplastic cells which have not yet penetrated the basement membrane and invaded other tissues.

===Differential diagnosis===

There are many known conditions that present with a white lesion of the oral mucosa, but the majority of oral white patches have no known cause. These are termed leukoplakia once other likely possibilities have been ruled out. There are also few recognized subtypes of leukoplakia, described according to the clinical appearance of the lesion.

Almost all oral white patches are usually the result of keratosis. For this reason, oral white patches are sometimes generally described as keratoses, although a minority of oral white lesions are not related to hyperkeratosis, e.g. epithelial necrosis and ulceration caused by a chemical burn (see: Oral ulceration#Chemical injury). In keratosis, the thickened keratin layer absorbs water from saliva in the mouth and appears white in comparison with normal mucosa. Normal oral mucosa is a red-pink color due to the underlying vasculature in the lamina propria showing through the thin layer of epithelium. Melanin produced in the oral mucosa also influences the color, with a darker appearance being created by higher levels of melanin in the tissues (associated with racial/physiologic pigmentation, or with disorders causing melanin overproduction such as Addison&#x27;s disease). Other endogenous pigments can be overproduced to influence the color, e.g. bilirubin in hyperbilirubinemia or hemosiderin in hemochromatosis, or exogenous pigments such as heavy metals can be introduced into the mucosa, e.g. in an amalgam tattoo.

Almost all white patches are benign, i.e. non-malignant. The differential diagnosis of a white lesion in the mouth can be considered according to a surgical sieve (see table).

Leukoplakia cannot be rubbed off the mucosa, distinguishing it readily from white patches such as pseudomembraneous candidiasis, where a white layer can be removed to reveal an erythematous, sometimes bleeding surface underneath. The white color associated with leukoedema disappears when the mucosa is stretched. A frictional keratosis will generally be adjacent to a sharp surface such as a broken tooth or rough area on a denture and will disappear when the causative factor is removed. Some have a suggested as general rule that any lesion that does not show signs of healing within 2 weeks should be biopsied. Morsicatio buccarum and linea alba are located at the level of the occlusal plane (the level at which the teeth meet). A chemical burn has a clear history of placing an aspirin tablet (or other caustic substance such as eugenol) against the mucosa in an attempt to relieve toothache. Developmental white patches usually are present from birth or become apparent earlier in life, whilst leukoplakia generally affects middle aged or elderly people. Other causes of white patches generally require pathologic examination of a biopsy specimen to distinguish with certainty from leukoplakia.

==Management==
A systematic review found that no treatments commonly used for leukoplakia have been shown to be effective in preventing malignant transformation. Some treatments may lead to healing of leukoplakia, but do not prevent relapse of the lesion or malignant change. Regardless of the treatment used, a diagnosis of leukoplakia almost always leads to a recommendation that possible causative factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption be stopped, and also involves long term review of the lesion, to detect any malignant change early and thereby improve the prognosis significantly.

===Predisposing factors and review===
Beyond advising smoking cessation, many clinicians will employ watchful waiting rather than intervene. Recommended recall intervals vary. One suggested program is every 3 months initially, and if there is no change in the lesion, then annual recall thereafter. Some clinicians use clinical photographs of the lesion to help demonstrate any changes between visits. Watchful waiting does not rule out the possibility of repeated biopsies. If the lesion changes in appearance repeat biopsies are especially indicated. Since smoking and alcohol consumption also places individuals at higher risk of tumors occurring in the respiratory tract and pharynx, &quot;red flag&quot; symptoms (e.g. hemoptysis - coughing blood) often trigger medical investigation by other specialties.

===Surgery===
Surgical removal of the lesion is the first choice of treatment for many clinicians. However, the efficacy of this treatment modality cannot be assessed due to insufficient available evidence. This can be carried out by traditional surgical excision with a scalpel, with lasers, or with eletrocautery or cryotherapy. Often, if biopsy demonstrates moderate or severe dysplasia then the decision to excise them is taken more readily. Sometimes, white patches are too large to remove completely and instead they are monitored closely. Even if the lesion is completely removed, long term review is still usually indicated since leukoplakia can recur, especially if predisposing factors such as smoking are not stopped.

===Medications===
Many different topical and systemic medications have been studied, including anti-inflammatories, antimycotics (target Candida species), carotenoids (precursors to vitamin A, e.g. beta carotene), retinoids (drugs similar to vitamin A), and cytotoxics, but none have evidence that they prevent malignant transformation in an area of leukoplakia. Vitamins C and E have also been studied with regards a therapy for leukoplakia. Some of this research is carried out based upon the hypothesis that antioxidant nutrients, vitamins and cell growth suppressor proteins (e.g. p53) are antagonistic to oncogenesis. High doses of retinoids may cause toxic effects. Other treatments that have been studied include photodynamic therapy.

==Prognosis==
The annual malignant transformation rate of leukoplakia rarely exceeds 1%, i.e. the vast majority of oral leukoplakia lesions will remain benign. A number of clinical and histopathologic features are associated with varying degrees of increased risk of malignant transformation, although other sources argue that there are no universally accepted and validated factors which can reliably predict malignant change. It is also unpredictable to an extent if an area of leukoplakia will disappear, shrink or remain stable.
* Presence and degree of dysplasia (mild, moderate or severe/carcinoma in situ). While the degree of dysplasia has been shown to be an important predictor of malignant change, many have challenged its use due to the low predictive value from the lack of objectivity of grading dysplasia. While 10% of leukoplakia lesions show dysplasia when biopsied, as many as 18% of oral lesions undergo malignant change in the absence of dysplasia.
* Leukoplakia located on the floor of the mouth, the posterior and lateral tongue, and the retromolar areas (the region behind the wisdom teeth) have higher risk, whereas white patches in areas such as the top surface of the tongue and the hard palate do not have significant risk. Although these &quot;high risk&quot; sites are recognized, statistically, leukoplakia is more common on the buccal mucosa, alveolar mucosa, and the lower labial mucosa. Leukoplakia of the floor of the mouth and tongue accounts for over 90% of leukoplakias showing dysplasia or carcinoma on biopsy. This is thought to be due to pooling of saliva in the lower part of the mouth, exposing these areas to more carcinogens held in suspension.
* Red lesions (erythroplasia) and mixed red and white lesions (erythroleukoplakia/&quot;speckled leukoplakia&quot;) have a higher risk of malignant change than homogeneous leukoplakia.
* Verrucous or nodular areas have a higher risk.
* Although smoking increases risk of malignant transformation, smoking also causes many white patches with no dysplasia. This means that statistically, white patches in non-smokers have a higher risk.
* Older people with white patches are at higher risk.
* Larger white patches are more likely to undergo malignant transformation than smaller lesions.
* White patches which have been present for a long period of time have a higher risk.
* Persons with a positive family history of cancer in the mouth.
* Candida infection in the presence of dysplasia has a small increased risk.
* A change in the appearance of the white patch, apart from a change in the color, has a higher risk. Changes in the lesion such as becoming fixed to underlying tissues, ulceration, cervical lymphadenopathy (enlargement of lymph nodes in the neck), and bone destruction may herald the appearance of malignancy.
* White patches present in combination with other conditions that carry a higher risk (e.g. oral submucous fibrosis), are more likely to turn malignant.
* Although overall, oral cancer is more common in males, females with white patches are at higher risk than men.

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence of oral leukoplakia varies around the world, but generally speaking it is not an uncommon condition. Reported prevalence estimates range from less than 1% to more than 5% in the general population. Leukoplakia is, therefore, the most common premalignant lesion that occurs in the mouth. Leukoplakia is more common in middle-aged and elderly males. The prevalence increases with increasing age. In areas of the world where smokeless tobacco use is common, there is a higher prevalence. In the Middle East region, the prevalence of leukoplakia is less than 1% (0.48%).

==Etymology==
The word leukoplakia means &quot;white patch&quot;, and is derived from the Greek words λευκός - &quot;white&quot; and πλάξ - &quot;plate&quot;.

==History==
The term &quot;leukoplakia&quot; was coined in 1861 by Karl Freiherr von Rokitansky, who used it to refer to white lesions of the urinary tract. In 1877, Schwimmer first used the term for an oral white lesion. It is now thought that this white lesion on the tongue represented syphilitic glossitis, a condition not included in the modern definitions of oral leukoplakia. Since then, the word &quot;leukoplakia&quot; has been incorporated into the names for several other oral lesions (e.g. &quot;candidal leukoplakia&quot;, now more usually termed &quot;hyperplastic candidiasis&quot;). In 1930, it was shown experimentally that leukoplakia could be induced in rabbits that were subjected to tobacco smoke for 3 minutes per day. According to one source from 1961, leukoplakia can occur on multiple different mucous membranes of the body, including in the urinary tract, rectum, vagina, uterus, vulva, paranasal sinuses, gallbladder, esophagus, eardrums, and pharynx. Generally, oral leukoplakia is the only context where the term is in common usage in modern medicine. In 1988, a case report used the term &quot;acquired dyskeratotic leukoplakia&quot; to refer to an acquired condition in a female where dyskeratotic cells were present in the epithelia of the mouth and genitalia.

<text>The &quot;Mercy&quot; class of hospital ships are converted supertankers used by the United States Navy. Originally built in the 1970s by the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company, they were acquired by the Navy and converted into hospital ships, coming into service in 1986 and 1987.

&quot;Mercy&quot; class replaced the s.

The ships are operated by Military Sealift Command and are designed to provide emergency, on-site care for American combatant forces, and also for use in support of disaster relief and humanitarian operations. Each ship contains twelve fully equipped operating rooms, a 1,000-bed hospital facility, radiological services, a medical laboratory, pharmacy, optometry lab, CT scan equipment, and two oxygen-producing plants.

==Ships==
Two ships of the class were put into service:

* (ex SS &quot;Worth&quot;)
* (ex SS &quot;Rose City&quot;)

== Missions ==
Stationed in San Diego, California, &quot;Mercy&quot; primarily operates in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Her inaugural mission in 1987, was a humanitarian cruise to the Philippines and South Pacific. Her first military mission was serving coalition troops in the First Gulf War. The first disaster relief came in the wake of the 2004 tsunami as Operation Unified Assistance. Her latest was in 2013, when she came to the aid of the Philippines, and other nations in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan.

Stationed out of Norfolk, Virginia, &quot;Comfort&quot; operates primarily in the Caribbean and Latin America. Her first mission was a combat one: serving coalition troops off the coast of Kuwait, during Operation Desert Storm. Her first humanitarian missions both happened in 1994, helping Haitian and Cuban immigrants looking to come to America. In the aftermath of September 11 attacks, &quot;Comfort&quot; was activated and sent to Manhattan, to provide medical and mental health services. &quot;Comfort&quot; headed into combat again for Operation Iraqi Freedom. In 2005, she was back saving American citizens following the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. In 2010, she undertook another disaster relief mission, in response to an earthquake in Haiti. In May 2015, &quot;Comfort&quot; was in Kingston, Jamaica. Once again in 2017, &quot;Comfort&quot; was deployed to aid American citizens in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.

In March 2020, the ships were deployed to aid in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Both ships were to function as trauma centers at erstwhile-disused cruise ship terminals in San Pedro and Manhattan. This, at that time, would have been expected to have enabled nearby hospitals to have freed up beds for coronavirus patients. On 21 April, Governor Cuomo told President Trump that &quot;Comfort&quot; was no longer needed in New York. While docked in the city, she treated 182 patients.

==Criticism==
The &quot;Mercy&quot;-class ships&#x27; size gives them a substantial radar signature that, combined with lack of maneuverability, makes them vulnerable to attack. In theory, this should never occur, as attacking a hospital ship is a war crime under the Hague Convention of 1907, but the ships are left vulnerable to terrorist organizations and other entities that do not follow such established warfare conventions, due to the fact that both ships are outfitted only with defensive weapons. If within a battle fleet they could be vulnerable to missile strikes aimed at the fleet as a whole, and their radar signature could be confused with troop ships, landing ships, helicopter carriers or become a target for weapons that miss or are decoyed away from combatant ships.

In mid-2004 Vice Admiral Michael L. Cowan, the Surgeon General and chief of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, said that &quot;Comfort&quot; and &quot;Mercy&quot; should be retired and that &quot;They&#x27;re wonderful ships, but they&#x27;re dinosaurs. They were designed in the &#x27;70s, built in the &#x27;80s, and frankly, they&#x27;re obsolete.&quot;

<text>Newsboys (sometimes stylised as newsboys) are a Christian rock band founded in 1985 in Mooloolaba, Queensland, Australia, by Peter Furler and George Perdikis. Now based in Nashville, Tennessee, the band has released 17 studio albums, 6 of which have been certified gold. As of 2025, the band consists of bassist and vocalist Adam Agee (formerly of Stellar Kart and Audio Adrenaline), electric guitarist Jody Davis, keyboardist Jeff Frankenstein, and drummer Duncan Phillips; no founding members are featured in the lineup. In addition to performing music, the band has appeared in the films &quot;God&#x27;s Not Dead&quot;, &quot;God&#x27;s Not Dead 2&quot;, and &quot;God&#x27;s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness&quot;.

== History ==

=== 1980s ===

The band was formed in Mooloolaba, Queensland, Australia in 1985 by two young men: Peter Furler and his school mate George Perdikis. Furler and Perdikis practiced in a garage on the Sunshine Coast, well known for being a &quot;surfer&#x27;s paradise&quot;. Two other teens were added soon after: Furler&#x27;s best friend, John James, and bassist Sean Taylor. Newsboys came to the United States in late 1987 after getting signed with Refuge Communications and released the album &quot;Read All About It&quot; in 1988 in the United States.

=== 1990s ===

After signing with Star Song Communications, they released two more albums in 1990 and 1991: &quot;Hell Is for Wimps&quot; and &quot;Boys Will Be Boyz&quot;, with its first self-titled video. None of the band&#x27;s first three albums garnered much attention and the band&#x27;s line-up changed with every release.

It wasn&#x27;t until their 1992 album, &quot;Not Ashamed&quot; (containing a cover of the DeGarmo &amp; Key song &quot;Boycott Hell&quot;), that the band gained notice in the Christian music scene with its second self-titled video that followed a year later. Steve Taylor, a singer-songwriter and producer, began a partnership with the band, producing the band&#x27;s record and writing most of the lyrics for their songs. Furler remained the band&#x27;s primary songwriter and beginning with this album began sharing lead vocal duties with James and continued to do so until James&#x27; departure.

In 1994 amidst continued line-up changes (which included the addition of mainstays Jody Davis and Duncan Phillips), the band released &quot;Going Public&quot;, their fifth album and first real success. The record proved to be a watershed for the group, winning a 1995 Dove Award for &quot;Rock Album of the Year&quot;. It also produced four No. 1 hits: &quot;Spirit Thing&quot;, &quot;Real Good Thing&quot;, &quot;Truth and Consequences&quot;, and, most notably, &quot;Shine&quot;. &quot;Shine&quot; won the 1995 Dove for &quot;Rock Recorded Song of the Year&quot;, and in 2006, CCM Magazine listed &quot;Shine&quot; in the top 10 in its ranking of the 100 Greatest Songs in Christian music. Shine is considered by fans to be the band&#x27;s signature song.

The 1996 follow-up album &quot;Take Me to Your Leader&quot; was recorded with an expanded line up with new additions bassist Phil Joel and keyboardist Jeff Frankenstein. The album produced three more pop No. 1 hits: &quot;Reality&quot;, &quot;Let It Go&quot;, and the title track, two rock No. 1 hits: &quot;Cup O&#x27; Tea&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot;, as well as fan favourite and concert staple &quot;Breakfast&quot;. This album also won the group&#x27;s third Dove, this time for &quot;Recorded Music Packaging of the Year&quot;. This album spawned the Newsboys&#x27; first movie, &quot;Down Under the Big Top&quot; (1996), which was based on the song &quot;Reality&quot;.

In late 1997 just after completing the Take Me To Your Leader Tour, lead singer John James announced he would be leaving the band to start a preaching ministry. In 2007 he revealed the actual reason was due to a drug and alcohol addiction. With his departure, Furler moved from drums to vocals and auditions were held for the now-vacant drum position. Eventually, Duncan Phillips, who had previously played keyboards and percussion for the band moved over to the drum kit. From 1998 to 2003, the band&#x27;s line-up of Furler, bassist Phil Joel, guitarist Jody Davis, keyboardist Jeff Frankenstein and Phillips stayed constant and in 1997 Newsboys hit the studio to record &quot;Step Up to the Microphone&quot;.

The first post-James record, &quot;Step Up to the Microphone&quot;, sold well and produced four No. 1 hits: &quot;Entertaining Angels&quot;, &quot;WooHoo&quot;, &quot;Believe&quot;, and the title track. It also spawned the Newsboys&#x27; live video, &quot;Live One Night In Pennsylvania&quot; and a year later. &quot;Entertaining Angels&quot; won the 1999 Dove for &quot;Short Form Music Video of the Year&quot;. 
and 
in Late 1998 they went into the studio to record Love Liberty Disco

The band returned in 1999 with &quot;Love Liberty Disco&quot;, the band&#x27;s only album to significantly deviate from their pop rock sound. Instead, this particular album featured more of a disco sound. Still, it produced several hits, including the No. 1 hits &quot;Beautiful Sound&quot; and &quot;Good Stuff&quot; as well as the title track. The LLD tour was significantly more popular than the album. This tour featured an inflatable arena, called the Air Dome.

In 1999, Furler co-founded Inpop Records with Wes Campbell as an independent contemporary Christian music record label.

=== 2000s ===

In 2000, Newsboys headlined the annual, travelling CCM concert, Festival Con Dios, with Audio Adrenaline and The O.C. Supertones. That same year, Newsboys released a greatest hits compilation, &quot;&quot;, which did not include any songs from the &quot;Love Liberty Disco&quot; album, but included four new songs, two of which (&quot;Joy&quot; and &quot;Who?&quot;) went to No. 1. After this album the band did not release any new material until the 2002 release of &quot;Thrive&quot;, a record that produced two No. 1 singles: &quot;Million Pieces (Kissin&#x27; Your Cares Goodbye)&quot; and the praise and worship-driven &quot;It Is You&quot;, which proved to be the biggest hit of their career up to that point also with its video, &quot;Thrive: From The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame&quot;. Also in 2002, The Newsboys recorded the track &quot;In the Belly of the Whale&quot; for the end credits of the 2002 movie &quot;&quot;.

After the success of &quot;It Is You&quot;, the Newsboys then followed with two praise and worship albums: &quot;&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Devotion&quot; in 2004. Late in 2003, Davis departed and was replaced by Bryan Olesen on guitar. In 2005, The Newsboys co-authored a book of devotions with Jim Laffoon entitled &quot;Our Daily Blog&quot; which was published by Inspiro and released on 1 November. They also recorded their Creation 2005 set for a live DVD to be released with their upcoming album. In 2006, Olesen left the band to focus on his own band Casting Pearls and was replaced by Paul Colman, formerly of Paul Colman Trio.

More radio hits came in 2006 with a live version of &quot;I Am Free&quot; (originally written by Jon Egan of the Desperation Band), and &quot;Wherever We Go&quot;. On 31 October 2006, The Newsboys released a pop/rock record entitled &quot;GO&quot;. &quot;GO&quot; featured David Eri as a co-writer and the songs &quot;Something Beautiful&quot; and &quot;In Wonder&quot; were big hits on Christian Radio. That December, Joel announced that he would leave the band to pursue his own projects and albums. On 8 May 2007, the band released &quot;GO Remixed&quot; which was made up of new versions of the songs from &quot;GO&quot; and featured remixes by Tedd T., Jeff Frankenstein, Max Hsu of Superchick and Lee Bridges.

On 20 November 2007 the Newsboys released their second greatest hits compilation, &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot;. The eighteen-song CD also features two new songs &quot;I Fought the La...&quot; and &quot;Stay Strong&quot;. This album was followed by &quot;Newsboys Live: Houston We Are GO&quot;, a CD/DVD combo recording package of a show from the GO Tour, which was released on 30 September 2008. Also in 2008, the band, with Steve Taylor providing vocals, recorded the song &quot;Yo Ho Hero&quot; for &quot;The Pirates Who Don&#x27;t Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie&quot;. In 2007, the band&#x27;s co-founder George Perdikis renounced Christianity and declared himself an atheist. He had not been involved with the band for seventeen years, nor was he in any way involved with their commercially and critically successful singles or albums.

On 5 January 2009, Colman announced he would be leaving The Newsboys to return to his solo projects. At the same time, it was announced that Davis would return to the band, after a five-year hiatus. &quot;I am thrilled to be returning to the band and back with my bandmates, who are some of my best friends,&quot; says Davis, &quot;this is a big change in my life, and I&#x27;m looking forward to the tour and new record with excitement.&quot;

In 2009, it was announced that Furler, having toured with The Newsboys since the band&#x27;s inception, had decided to step back into a support role and would continue as the band&#x27;s primary songwriter and producer. Because of this, a replacement lead vocalist was required so the band could continue touring. On 9 March 2009, it was announced that Michael Tait, formerly of dc Talk, would be the new lead singer. &quot;Michael Tait will be touring with the band as lead singer with Furler making special appearances throughout the year. Furler will continue with the band and his trademark songwriting and production will remain as he focuses his professional career toward future Newsboys recordings.&quot; On 17 March, Tait performed his first full concert as lead singer in Highlands Ranch, Colorado.

The Newsboys released the studio album &quot;In the Hands of God&quot; on 5 May on Inpop Records with Max Hsu producing the album. Long-time collaborator Steve Taylor co-wrote all the songs and sang on one song. During their concert of 11 September in Orlando, Furler announced that this would be his final guest appearance with the band. His full departure left no original members remaining in the band.

=== 2010s ===
The Newsboys&#x27; first studio album featuring lead singer Michael Tait, &quot;Born Again&quot;, was released on 13 July 2010 and debuted at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, their highest debut position, and sold over 45,000 copies in its first week. On 12 October 2010 they released the Christmas album, &quot;Christmas! A Newsboys Holiday&quot; featuring &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; by Tait. In 2011, the song &quot;City to City&quot; from &quot;GO Remixed&quot; was featured in the trailer for the Disney Pixar movie, &quot;Cars 2&quot;.

&quot;God&#x27;s Not Dead&quot; was released 15 November 2011. Their newest live album, title &quot;Live in Concert: God&#x27;s Not Dead&quot;, came out on 22 October 2012. In the same year they released their single &quot;The League of Incredible Vegetables&quot; for the &quot;VeggieTales&quot; video of the same name. The band released their 16th studio album &quot;Restart&quot; on 10 September 2013. The &quot;Restart Tour&quot; ran from 20 September to 27 October 2013. The band is also a part of the Winter Jam Tour 2013 from November 2013 through March 2014.

The band appeared in a sequence for the film &quot;God&#x27;s Not Dead&quot;, released in 2014. Michael Tait expressed excitement about the film to The Global Dispatch during an interview, saying that &quot;The movie is powerful because of the whole stance of it…just trying to prove God&#x27;s existence…sharing the gospel, living the lifestyle, changing the mindset of people around them in this college, in this university.&quot; Duncan Phillips added in a similar interview that &quot;Disney&#x27;s Shane Harper plays a college student whose faith is challenged by his professor, played by Kevin Sorbo from Hercules. Dean Cain from Superman is in it, too. So we got to hang out with a bunch of superheroes. The movie raises a lot of questions and a lot of eyebrows from a culture that questions if there is a God.&quot;

The band then embarked on the &quot;We Believe Tour&quot;. They performed at the BigChurchDayOut 2014 and again in 2017. In 2015, the Newsboys started the &quot;We Believe God&#x27;s Not Dead Tour&quot;. &quot;Love Riot&quot; was released in 2016 and a tour followed. The band also appeared in the 2016 film &quot;God&#x27;s Not Dead 2&quot;.

It was announced in late 2017 that Peter Furler and Phil Joel would participate with Newsboys on the Newsboys United Tour in 2018. Along with the tour, it was announced that the band is doing an album, &quot;United&quot;, with Furler and Joel, which was released 10 May 2019. The last tour date with Furler and Joel was in August 2021.

===2020s===
The band subsequently released their twentieth album &quot;Stand&quot; on 1 October 2021.

On 29 March 2023, it was announced that Adam Agee, formerly of Stellar Kart and Audio Adrenaline would be joining the band as the fifth member. The band also announced &quot;He Lives&quot; as a digital single marking the first single with Agee, which was released on 31 March 2023.

In 2024, Newsboys are releasing a two-part album: &quot;World Wide Revival&quot;. &quot;World Wide Revival Part 1&quot; was released on July 19, 2024. Its first single, &quot;How Many Times&quot; and its music video were released the same day as well.

On January 16, 2025, Michael Tait released a statement on social media saying he will be stepping down as lead singer of Newsboys. Adam Agee stepped up to the lead vocalist spot.

<text>A permalink or permanent link is a URL that is intended to remain unchanged for many years into the future, yielding a hyperlink that is less susceptible to link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as clean URLs, to be easier to type and remember. Most modern blogging and content-syndication software systems support such links. Sometimes URL shortening is used to create them.

A permalink is a type of persistent identifier and the word &quot;permalink&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym of &quot;persistent identifier.&quot; More often, though, &quot;permalink&quot; is applied to persistent identifiers which are generated by a content management system for pages served by that system. This usage is especially common in the blogosphere. Such links are not maintained by an outside authority, and their persistence is dependent on the durability of the content management system itself.

==History==

In the early years of the web, all content was static, and thus all hyperlinks pointed at a filename. Soon, though, many web pages became dynamic, and many URLs began to include query terms.

One cited early use of the term &quot;permalink&quot; in its current sense was by Jason Kottke on March 5, 2000, in a post titled: &quot;Finally. Did you notice the&quot;. Matthew Haughey had discussed a permalink-style feature with Blogger co-founders Evan Williams and Paul Bausch the previous weekend, and Bausch had pointed out that it was technically feasible to produce permanent links in Blogger, using a feature (written by him) that allowed the ID of a post to be placed in a Blogger template. In response to Kottke&#x27;s blog, on March 6, 2000, Haughey posted the technical details on his own weblog, which helped open the way to widespread adoption.

==Purpose==
Permanence in links is desirable when content items are likely to be linked to, from, or cited by a source outside the originating organization. Before the advent of large-scale dynamic websites built on database-backed content management systems, it was more common for URLs of specific pieces of content to be static and human-readable, as URL structure and naming were dictated by the entity creating that content. Increased volume of content and difficulty of management led to the rise of database-driven systems, and the resulting unwieldy and often-changing URLs necessitated deliberate policies with regard to URL design and link permanence.

For example, Wikipedia&#x27;s internal Common Gateway Interface-based URLs are made more readable by simplifying them. The internal URI for a Wikipedia article named Example, which is codice_1, is generated via URL rewriting from the more human-readable external URL, codice_2.

An entry in a blog with many entries is accessible from the site&#x27;s front page for only a short time. Visitors who store the URL for a particular entry often find upon their return that the desired content has been replaced by something new. Prominently posting permalinks is a method employed by bloggers to encourage visitors to store a more long-lived URL (the permalink) for reference.

Permalinks frequently consist of a string of characters that represent the date and time of posting, and an identifier that denotes the author who initially authored the item or its subject. Crucially, if an item is changed, renamed, or moved within the internal database, its permalink remains unaltered, as it functions as a magic cookie that references an internal database identifier. If an item is deleted altogether, its permalink can frequently not be reused.

Permalinks have subsequently been exploited for a number of innovations, including link tracing and link trackback in weblogs, and referring to specific weblog entries in RSS or Atom syndication streams.

===Comparing with PURL===
Both &quot;permalink&quot; and PURL (persistent uniform resource locator) are used as a persistent URL, and redirect to the location of the requested web resource. The main differences in the concepts are about domain name and time scale: PURL uses an independent dedicated domain name, and is intended to last for decades; permalinks usually do not change the URL&#x27;s domain, and are intended for use on timescales of years.

==Permalinks and versions==

Many blogging and content management systems do not support versioning of content, that is, if an entry is updated, a uniquely accessible version is not created. Thus, in the context of these systems, a permalink may refer to different content over time. In the context of systems that support versioning, such as most wikis, a permalink is commonly understood as a link to a &quot;specific version&quot;. Here, both the link itself and the resource it refers to should not change over time.

MediaWiki, the software that runs Wikipedia, supports this type of permanent link. In its current implementation, old versions of specific articles, images, and templates are referenceable by unique unchanging URLs, though current entries may not use old versions of images and templates. Permanent links to specific versions are recommended for citing articles from sources such as Wikipedia and Wikinews, to ensure that the content remains unchanged for review. A reviewer can then view the cited revision, the current revision, and the differences between the two.

==Presentation==
Blog entries are usually laid out as follows:
*Title
*Date
*Body
*Comments, permalink, and what category the entry was posted to (known as metadata)

Permalinks are usually denoted by text link (i.e. &quot;Permalink&quot; or &quot;Link to this Entry&quot;), but sometimes a symbol may be used. The most common symbol used is the hash sign, or #. However, certain websites employ their own symbol to represent a permalink such as an asterisk, a dash, a pilcrow (¶), a section sign (§), or a unique icon.

==Permalink detection==
Permalinks can be indicated within the HTML of a page to allow automated browsing tools to detect the permalink and use it for linking instead of the stated URL. The link element should include the following attributes:

&lt;link rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; href=&quot;http://example.com/bookmark/123/&quot; /&gt;

<text>Stern is the name of two different but related arcade gaming companies. Stern Electronics, Inc. manufactured arcade video games and pinball machines from 1977 until 1985, and was best known for &quot;Berzerk&quot;. Stern Pinball, Inc., founded in 1986 as Data East Pinball, is a manufacturer of pinball machines in North America.

==Stern Electronics, Inc.==

Stern Electronics was formed when Sam and Gary Stern bought the financially troubled Chicago Coin in 1977. Sam had previously owned the amusements manufacturer Williams, purchasing half of the company in 1947 and selling it to the Seeburg Corporation in 1964. Gary had trained under his father at Williams, and from 1973-1977 the two ran the company. Stern Electronics, Inc. acquired their core inventory by purchasing Chicago Coin&#x27;s assets at bankruptcy sales; as a separate company, they did not assume any of the debt Chicago Coin had amassed.

The first two games made by Stern were &quot;Stampede&quot; and &quot;Rawhide&quot;, both originally made by Chicago Coin, which only had changes made to their branding and logos. After a weak start, Stern Electronics&#x27; sales started picking up by the end of 1977. They produced the first solid-state pinball machine, called &quot;Pinball&quot; that year. By 1978, they had switched over to fully solid-state electronics for their games. In 1979, Stern acquired the jukebox production assets of the bankrupt Seeburg Corporation, and the company became known as Stern / Seeburg.

When arcade video games became popular in 1980, Stern Electronics produced &quot;Berzerk&quot;. They largely stopped producing pinball machines. In 1983, Stern became one of many victims of the amusement industry economic shakeout that occurred. In 1984, Sam Stern died and Stern Electronics closed in 1985. From 1985 to 1986, personnel from Stern Electronics formed a venture known as Pinstar that produced conversion kits for old Bally and Stern machines, with Gary Stern continuing to function as president. He then went on to help found Data East&#x27;s pinball division and continued to lead there when the it was acquired by Sega in 1994. While DataEast did operate out of the old Stern Electronics property, sources differ on whether they acquired the company or just the facilities.

On March 16, 2023, Atari announced that it had acquired the intellectual property rights to 12 Stern Electronics titles, including &quot;Berzerk&quot; and &quot;Frenzy&quot;.

==Stern Pinball, Inc.==

By 1999, the pinball industry was virtually dead. Sega left the pinball industry by spinning off their pinball division and selling it to Gary Stern, and Stern Pinball was born. Stern Pinball became the only pinball manufacturer left, but continued to struggle in the 2000s, producing just 10,000 machines per year and selling the majority of them overseas.

As of 2023, longtime designers Brian Eddy, John Borg, and George Gomez are designing pinball games at Stern Pinball, alongside top-ranking competitive player Keith Elwin and popular pinball streamer Jack Danger. Stern Pinball, Inc. is based in Elk Grove Village, Illinois.

Some Stern pinball tables were also digitally released through &quot;The Pinball Arcade&quot; and &quot;Stern Pinball Arcade&quot;.

<doc id="878932" wikidata="Q719639" url="?curid=878932" title="Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt">
<text>The Twelfth Dynasty of ancient Egypt (Dynasty XII) is a series of rulers reigning from 1991–1802 BC (190 years), at what is often considered to be the apex of the Middle Kingdom (Dynasties XI–XIV). The dynasty periodically expanded its territory from the Nile delta and valley South beyond the second cataract and East into Canaan. 

The Twelfth Dynasty was marked by relative stability and development. It has a notably well recorded history for the period. Its first pharaoh was Amenemhat I and its final was Sobekneferu.

==History==
The chronology of the Twelfth Dynasty is the most stable of any period before the New Kingdom. The Turin Royal Canon gives 213 years (1991–1778 BC). Manetho stated that it was based in Thebes, but from contemporary records it is clear that the first king of this dynasty, Amenemhat I, moved its capital to a new city named &quot;Amenemhat-itj-tawy&quot; (&quot;Amenemhat the Seizer of the Two Lands&quot;), more simply called, Itjtawy. The location of Itjtawy has not been discovered yet, but it is thought to be near the Fayyum, probably near the royal graveyards at el-Lisht.

The order of its rulers of the Twelfth Dynasty is well known from several sources: two lists recorded at temples in Abydos and one at Saqqara, as well as lists derived from Manetho&#x27;s work. A recorded date during the reign of Senusret III can be correlated to the Sothic cycle, consequently, many events during this dynasty frequently can be assigned to a specific year. However, scholars now have expressed skepticism in the usefulness of the referred date, due to the fact that location affects observation of the Sothic cycle.

Egypt underwent various developments under the Twelfth Dynasty, including the reorganization of the kingdom&#x27;s administration and agricultural developments in the Fayyum. The Twelfth Dynasty was also responsible for significant expansion of Egyptian borders, with campaigns pushing into Nubia and the Levant.

The Twelfth Dynasty is often considered the apex of Egypt&#x27;s Middle Kingdom. The Middle Kingdom spans the Eleventh, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth dynasties, but some scholars only consider the 11th and 12th dynasties to be part of the Middle Kingdom.

==Rulers==
Known rulers of the Twelfth Dynasty are as follows:

=== Amenemhat I ===
This dynasty was founded by Amenemhat I, who may have been vizier to the last king of Dynasty XI, Mentuhotep IV. His armies campaigned south as far as the Second Cataract of the Nile and into southern Canaan. As a part of his militaristic expansion of Egypt, Amenemhat I ordered the construction of multiple military forts in Nubia. He also reestablished diplomatic relations with the Canaanite state of Byblos and Hellenic rulers in the Aegean Sea. He was the father of Senusret I.

===Senusret I===
For the first ten years of his reign, Senusret I possibly ruled as a coregent alongside his father, Amenemhat I. He continued his fathers campaigns into Nubia, expanding Egyptian control to the Third Cataract of the Nile. In addition to pursuing militaristic expansion, Senusret I was also responsible for internal growth within Egypt. As king, he initiated a considerable amount of building projects across Egypt, including pyramids in Lisht, a temple at Karnak and oversaw the renovation of the kingdom&#x27;s major temples.

===Amenemhat II===

Unlike his predecessors, Amenemhat II was king during a time of peace. Under his reign, trade boomed with other states in Asia, the Mediterranean, and Africa. He built his mortuary complex near Memphis at Dahshur.

===Senusret II===

Senusret II also reigned during a time of peace. He was the first king to develop the Fayyum Basin for agricultural production. This development was complex, requiring the digging of several canals and the draining of a lake in order to maximize the Fayyum’s agricultural output. The Middle Kingdom development of the Fayyum later became the basis for the Ptolemaic and Roman efforts that turned the region into the bread basket of the Mediterranean.


===Senusret III===
Finding Nubia had grown restive under the previous rulers, Senusret sent punitive expeditions into that land. As a part of his effort to subdue Nubia, he ordered the construction of several new fortresses as well as the expansion of existing ones along the border with Nubia. He also sent an expedition into the Levant. Senusret III&#x27;s military career contributed to his prestige during the New Kingdom, as he was regarded as a warrior king and even revered as a god in Nubia. One of Senusret III’s significant internal developments was the centralization of administrative power in the kingdom, which replaced the nome system with three large administrative districts that encompassed all of Egypt.

===Amenemhat III===
Senusret&#x27;s successor Amenemhat III reaffirmed his predecessor&#x27;s foreign policy. However, after Amenemhat, the energies of this dynasty were largely spent, and the growing troubles of government were left to the dynasty&#x27;s last ruler, Sobekneferu, to resolve. Amenemhat was remembered for the mortuary temple at Hawara that he built.

===Amenemhat IV===
Amenemhat IV succeeded his father, Amenemhat III, and ruled for approximately nine years. At the time of his death, Amenemhat IV had no apparent heir, leading to Sobekneferu’s ascension to the throne.
===Sobekneferu===
Sobekneferu, a daughter of Amenemhat III, was the first known woman to become king of Egypt. She was left with the unresolved governmental issues that are noted as arising during her father&#x27;s reign when she succeeded Amenemhat IV, thought to be her brother, half brother, or step brother. Upon his death, she became the heir to the throne because her older sister, Neferuptah, who would have been the next in line to rule, died at an early age. Sobekneferu was the last king of the twelfth dynasty. There is no record of her having an heir. She also had a relatively short nearly four year reign and the next dynasty began with a shift in succession, possibly to unrelated heirs of Amenemhat IV.

==Ancient Egyptian literature refined==

Several famous works of Egyptian literature originated from the 12th Dynasty. Perhaps the best known work from this period is &quot;The Story of Sinuhe&quot;, of which papyrus copies dating as late as the New Kingdom have been recovered.

Some of the existing literature pertaining to the 12th Dynasty are propagandistic in nature. The &quot;Prophecy of Neferti&quot; establishes a revisionist account of history that legitimizes Amenemhat I’s rule. Written during the reign of Amenemhat I, described a sage’s prophecy given to the 4th Dynasty King Snefru that predicted a destructive civil war. It writes that the sage, Neferti, prophesied that a great king named Ameny (Amenemhat I) would lead a united Egypt out of this tumultuous period. The work also mentions Amenemhat I&#x27;s mother being from the Elephantine Egyptian nome Ta-Seti. Many scholars in recent years have argued that Amenemhat I&#x27;s mother was of Nubian origin.

Other known works attributed to the 12th Dynasty include:

* &quot;Dispute Between a Man and his Ba&quot;
* &quot;Complaints of Khakheperre-sonb&quot;
* &quot;Instructions of Amenemhat&quot;
* &quot;The Eloquent Peasant&quot;

<text>The Anniversary is an American band formed in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1997 by Josh Berwanger, James David, Christian Jankowski, Adrianne Verhoeven and Justin Roelofs. The Anniversary was the solidification of a line-up that had been in flux for a year. After two years of playing shows across with the Midwest with bands that included The Get Up Kids, Braid and Superchunk, The Anniversary signed to Vagrant Records.

Originally perceived as a poppy, keyboard-driven emo band with the release of their debut album &quot;Designing a Nervous Breakdown&quot; in 2000, they developed a stronger, classic rock-influenced sound with the release of a split CD with Superdrag in 2001 and their second full length, 2002’s &quot;Your Majesty&quot;. After touring heavily throughout 2002 and 2003, The Anniversary began demoing tracks for what would be their third full length. But four years of constant touring and personal strains within the group led to the band’s demise in early 2004.

Four and a half years after their breakup, &quot;Devil on Our Side&quot; — a compilation of b-sides and unreleased tracks — was released by Vagrant Records.

==History==
===Formation (1997–1999)===
In 1997 Anniversary formed as a five-piece band in Lawrence, Kansas. Josh Berwanger, Justin Roelofs and Adrianne Verhoeven began playing together in 1996 as The Broadcast. In January 1997, the band recorded a few songs including &quot;Crazy Makes Us Sane&quot;. After struggling to keep a permanent rhythm section, Chris &quot;Janko&quot; Jankowski and Jim David solidified the line-up later that year as the band changed their name to The Anniversary, partly because a British group already had the rights to the name The Broadcast.

Featuring Justin and Josh on guitar and vocals, Adrianne on keyboard and vocals, Jim on bass and Janko on drums, The Anniversary developed and refined their signature sound – sentimental guy/girl vocals, complemented by dueling guitar lines, with synth pop overlays and catchy choruses – with heavy touring throughout the Midwestern United States in 1997–1999. In January 1998 six songs were recorded at Kingsize Studios in Chicago. In October of that year six more songs were recorded for a debut EP on Kansas City-based Urinine Records. The Get Up Kids approached them in the spring of 1999 with a deal to record a full-length album on their new Heroes &amp; Villains imprint on Vagrant Records which they accepted.

===&quot;Designing a Nervous Breakdown&quot; (1999–2001)===
During ten days in July 1999 The Anniversary returned to Kingsize to record their debut full length, &quot;Designing a Nervous Breakdown&quot;. Later that July, at Red House Studios in Eudora, Kansas two more songs were recorded, one of which appeared in November 1999 on a split 7-inch with The Get Up Kids entitled Central Standard Time/Vasil + Bluey to precede the debut and help to build a national fan base.

&quot;Designing a Nervous Breakdown&quot; was released on January 20, 2000, and The Anniversary soon after departed on their first national tour with fellow band The Get Up Kids on January 26, currently popular for their album Something to Write Home About Touring relentlessly throughout 2000 and 2001, the band still found time to break away and record new songs. In March 2000 The Anniversary returned to Red House Studios to record a song later released on a split 7” with Hot Rod Circuit. In August three more songs were recorded at Red House – one released on the &quot;Another Year on the Streets&quot; Vagrant sampler, and two that were featured in the January 2001 Sub Pop Singles Club.

===&quot;Your Majesty&quot; (2001–2003)===
As they continued to tour and write new songs they gradually developed a more mature, classic rock influenced sound. In June 2001 The Anniversary recorded their second full-length album, &quot;Your Majesty&quot;, at Sonora Records in Los Feliz, California. &quot;Your Majesty&quot; marked a departure for the band, leaving the poppy, catchy melodies behind in favor of a more polished riff-driven classic rock sound.

Originally slated for a September 2001 release, the album was delayed because of a legal matter between Vagrant Records and their distributor. During this time, The Anniversary recorded three new songs in September 2001 for a split CD with Superdrag, the first in a series of split releases from Vagrant bands. The Superdrag split was released on November 13, 2001, to coincide with a national tour together, and &quot;Your Majesty&quot; followed shortly thereafter on January 22, 2002.

In between tours, a few tracks were demoed in Rob Pope’s basement in the fall of 2002. However, rather than re-signing a new contract, Vagrant Records dropped The Anniversary in early 2003 because of personal tensions with the label and other bands on the roster. But picking up right where they left off, through extensive touring with the likes of Cheap Trick and Guided by Voices, The Anniversary continued to develop their live sound as shows incorporated new songs and re-visited and re-worked past crowd favorites, transforming them into a psychedelic jam loaded with classic rock riffs and gutter rock swagger.

===Breakup (2003–2004)===
During the spring and summer of 2003 the band began producing demos for songs intended for their third full-length album. Around this time, they had signed to new management and received an offer from DreamWorks Records. The Anniversary continued to explore their songwriting prowess as they incorporated elements of reggae, blues, and even country. Before embarking on an October–November tour, they headed to Hideaway Studios in Sedalia, Colorado to record two tracks for the album. However, tensions within the band had been growing for some time, and The Anniversary played what would become their final show in San Antonio, Texas on November 23, 2003.

The band officially broke up in January 2004, and posted the following message on their website on February 6:
Hello everyone. Due to a number of reasons, The Anniversary has broken up. This may take some of you by surprise, but it was a long time coming. We&#x27;ll be selling stuff online a little longer so buy it up now because their [sic] collector&#x27;s items. Thank you all for your support in our efforts to make the music world a better place. We just weren&#x27;t prepared for it. Please feel free to check out this website www.theholyghosts.com. It&#x27;s another project that Josh, Jim, myself, Casey from Hot Rod Circuit, and T.K. Webb are working on. Justin is working on some solo stuff right now. Here&#x27;s a link to some of his new songs, click. Those of you on the e-mail list will receive updates from The Holy Ghosts from now on. Take care all and pleasant thoughts. Questions or comments may be addressed to theanniversary@hotmail.com.Peace out, Janko
===Solo projects (2004-2007)===
Justin Roelofs formed a solo project called White Flight and released his debut album on Range Life Records on March 6, 2007.

Adrianne Verhoeven played in Fourth Of July and Art In Manila before recording (as &quot;Dri&quot;) a solo record called &quot;Smoke Rings&quot;, which came out on Range Life Records on November 6, 2007.

Josh Berwanger formed a band called The Only Children, which released &quot;Change Of Living&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Keeper of Youth&quot; in 2007.

===&quot;Devil on Our Side&quot; and possible reformation (2008–present)===
Nearly four years after the farewell messages were sent, a new blog was posted on The Anniversary&#x27;s MySpace page on January 1, 2008, the first official communication from the band since the breakup. The band announced &quot;Devil on Our Side&quot;, a double disc compilation of unreleased songs, B-sides and rarities, released by Vagrant Records on June 24, 2008.

In 2008, Justin Roelofs recorded a sophomore White Flight record called &quot;White Ark&quot;, which was never officially released. The &quot;White Ark&quot; singles &quot;Panther&quot; and &quot;Children of the Light&quot; were released in 2010, digitally on Range Life Records and as a 7-inch in the UK on Make Mine., In 2014 Justin and co-producer E*vax of Ratatat released a single as ABUELA on the label Canvasback.

In 2009 Adrianne and husband/producer Alex deLanda, formed a band based out of San Francisco called Extra Classic. Extra Classic has released two albums: 2011&#x27;s &quot;Your Light Like White Lightning, Your Light Like A Laser Beam&quot;, released by Manimal Vinyl and Burger Records and 2014&#x27;s &quot;Showcase&quot;, released on their own imprint, Nopal Records.

Berwanger released the album &quot;Strange Stains&quot; (as Josh Berwanger) in 2013 on Good Land Records and the EP &quot;Demonios&quot; (as Berwanger) in 2015 on High Dive Records.

On March 22, 2016, the band created separate Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts each with a profile picture that simply showed the band&#x27;s logo and the year 2016, apparently teasing something on the horizon.

On March 28, 2016, it was announced that The Anniversary would join headliners Dashboard Confessional and Taking Back Sunday at the Taste of Chaos Festival on July 16, 2016, in San Bernardino, CA.

On September 8, 2016, the band kicked off its reunion tour in Boston, Massachusetts, at The Brighton Music Hall.

<doc id="878942" wikidata="Q3495736" url="?curid=878942" title="McNeil Island">
<text>McNeil Island is an island in the Northwestern United States, in south Puget Sound southwest of Tacoma, Washington. With a land area of , it lies in an area of many inhabited small islands, including Anderson Island to the south across Balch Passage, and Fox Island to the north across Carr Inlet. To the west, McNeil Island is separated from Key Peninsula by Pitt Passage. The Washington mainland lies to the east, across the south basin of Puget Sound.

The island has been owned by the government for many years; it was the location of a federal penitentiary for over a from 1875 turned over to the Washington State Department of Corrections and became the McNeil Island Corrections Center, until it closed It was the last remaining island prison in the country to be accessible only by air and sea.

In November 2010, the state announced closure plans for 2011, saving for violent sexual offenders remains on the island.

The McNeil Island Historical Society was chartered in 2010 shortly after the closing of the prison for the purpose of educating the public about, and preserving, the rich history of McNeil Island.

==History==
The island was part of the territory of the Steilacoom people, a Coast Salish tribe.

It was named in 1841 by Charles Wilkes in honor of Captain William Henry McNeill of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, who greeted Wilkes upon the arrival of the United States Exploring Expedition at Fort Nisqually in southern Puget Sound. Wilkes’ misspelling was never corrected.

The Robert A. Inskip expedition of 1846 named the island Duntze, after Captain John A. Duntze of the Royal Navy. In 1847, during the British map reorganization project, Henry Kellett restored the earlier name &quot;McNeil&quot;.

The U.S. government bought land on McNeil Island in 1870 and opened a federal penitentiary there in 1875. The federal government accumulated parcels of land adjacent to the penitentiary, and by 1937, it had purchased all the land on the island and compelled its last residents to leave.

The federal penitentiary&#x27;s most famous inmates were probably Robert Stroud, the &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot;, who was held there from 1909 to 1912; Charles Manson, who before inspiring &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; in killing Sharon Tate and others in 1969, was an inmate from 1961 to 1966 for trying to cash a forged government check; and Alvin Karpis, who was transferred to McNeil Island in 1962, from Alcatraz as a result of its impending closure, to complete his sentence. Karpis, who was labeled the FBI&#x27;s Public Enemy #1 at the time of his capture in 1936, was the point man for the that committed kidnappings and numerous bank robberies while operating throughout the Midwest in the early 1930s. Northwest bootlegger Roy Olmstead was also an inmate for four years until his release on May 12, 1931.

During World War II, eighty-five Japanese Americans who had resisted the draft to protest their wartime confinement, including civil rights activist Gordon Hirabayashi, were sentenced to prison terms at McNeil; all were pardoned by President Harry S. Truman in 1947.

The state of Washington acquired the penitentiary from the federal government in 1981. It was called McNeil Island Corrections Center (MICC) until 2011, when it became the Special Commitment Center for violent sexual criminals.

A post office called Bee was established in 1895 and remained in operation until 1919. Local beekeeping operations caused the name to be selected.

A post office called Gertrude was established on the island in 1900 and remained in operation until 1936. The community takes its name from nearby Gertrude Island.

A video posted to YouTube channel Vagrant Holiday in 2020 shows him exploring the island along with commentary.

===McNeil Island Cemetery and Prison===

Land for the McNeil Island Cemetery was donated by island pioneers, Eric Nyberg and his wife Martha. The first of many burials was in October 1905. When the island&#x27;s residents were forced to leave in 1936, the cemetery was closed; all remains were exhumed and reburied in cemeteries on the mainland.

At the time of its closing, McNeil was the only prison left in North America that was accessible only by boat or air. It remains the site of the state&#x27;s primary Special Commitment Center (SCC), where sexually violent predators are indefinitely committed for treatment after completing their standard prison sentences. In addition to the main building that held the majority of inmates, an annex on the opposite side of the island housed low-risk inmates, and those who were scheduled for release. During the 1800s, it was once a military encampment as well as a military prison for a short time. At one point, the prison was almost self-sustaining in terms of agricultural products, including its dairy farm; all these elements were manned and operated by the inmates.

McNeil was long threatened with closing due to the high cost of operating the prison; an announcement in late 2010 said the prison would close in 2011. The prison&#x27;s remaining 500 low-risk inmates were integrated into other state prisons. The prison officially closed on April 1, 2011.

==Population==
 the population was 214, all civilly committed former prison inmates.

While the prison was operational, the island had a population well over a thousand residents (1,516 as of the 2000 census) The majority of which were incarcerated in MICC prison. There were about 100 non-prisoners living on the island composing about 40 families, each with at least one family member employed at MICC. The homes were subsidized by the DOC at a greatly reduced rent.

==Transportation==

A small passenger-only ferry was for registered visitors, departing Steilacoom Dock every two hours. The state also supplies emergency speed-boat services for the civilly committed.

In 1934, McNeil Island was linked by ferry service with Steilacoom, Anderson Island and Longbranch, Washington. Separate federal or state-owned ferries under the prison administration connected McNeil Island with Steilacoom. The Washington State Department of Corrections continues to operate passenger ferry and barge service to McNeil Island to service DSHS&#x27;s Special Commitment Center.

The Heaphy Track is a popular tramping and mountain biking track in the north west of the South Island of New Zealand. It is located within the Kahurangi National Park and classified as one of New Zealand&#x27;s ten Great Walks by the Department of Conservation. Named after Charles Heaphy, the track is long and is usually walked in four or five days. The track is open for shared use with mountain bikers in the winter season from 1 May to 30 September each year. The southern end of the track is at Kōhaihai, north of Karamea on the northern West Coast, and the northern end is in the upper valley of the Aorere River, Golden Bay.

Floods in February 2022 caused major damage to three bridges on the West Coast end of the track, leading to the closure of the section between James Mackay Hut and Heaphy Hut, and preventing walkers and cyclists from completing the full distance. The damaged section of track re-opened in October 2023, after the replacement of bridges and restoration of tracks damaged in the 2022 floods.

==History==
Māori iwi are known to have settled along the lower course of the Heaphy River as early as the 14th century. There is a significant archaeological site near the existing Heaphy Hut that has been the subject of significant investigations. The evidence from these investigations suggests that at least some of the area crossed by today&#x27;s Heaphy Track had been explored and settled by Māori in pre-European times. No evidence has yet been found of middens in the Gouland Downs area, however middens have been found at all the main river-mouths south of the Heaphy River. This suggests that the route along the coast had been used regularly by Māori.

The first visit to the area by European persons whose names were recorded took place in 1846, when Charles Heaphy, Thomas Brunner and their Māori guide Kehu , supported by another guide , explored the coastal sector of the track.

In October 1856, James Mackay and a colleague John Clark explored the headwaters of the Aorere River, in search of a large grassy plan that had been reported by Māori to lie between the Aorere and the West Coast. They found a large scrub-covered area that was later named the Gouland Downs, but did not travel across it or mark out a route to the West Coast at that time.

The first recorded crossing approximately along today&#x27;s route was by a European gold miner named Aldrige in 1859. Another crossing by James Mackay took place in 1860. At the time, Mackay was returning from leading the Crown purchase from Māori of all the land on the West Coast within the Nelson province. His party turned inland at the Heaphy River, and then travelled up the Lewis River to the saddle. From there they crossed the Gouland Downs and descended via the Aorere River back to Collingwood.

The discovery of gold at Karamea in 1861 led to increased interest in the route between Nelson and the West Coast. In December 1861, Mackay, along with John and Arthur Knyvett, created a rough track between the upper Aorere River and the Heaphy River mouth. The Nelson Provincial Council allocated funding for work on the track in 1866 and 1867, but there is no record of further work on the track until 1885, when the Public Works Department asked the Collingwood County Council to initiate a survey. The Council engaged James Saxon a surveyor from Nelson, and he laid out a route suitable for horse carts from the Brown river to the Gouland Downs, with a grade of 1 in 16. His plans were approved by the Public Works Department in 1886.

During and after the West Coast gold rush of the 1860s the area was extensively visited for gold and the track was definitely laid out by various prospectors and surveyors, among them John Saxon in 1888. No gold was found in the area and, after thirty years, prospecting came to an end. By 1900, the track was virtually forgotten and had become overgrown and seldom used except by an occasional hunter.

The creation of the North-west Nelson Forest Park in 1965, which became Kahurangi National Park in 1996, led to the rediscovery and improvement of the track.

The track is now tramped by thousands of people every year.

=== Partial track closure in 2022 ===

In early February 2022, heavy rain in the Buller District caused severe flooding and damage to the track and to three bridges on the final section of the track between James Mackay and Heaphy Huts. The suspension bridge over the Gunner River was damaged and the Pitt Creek bridge was swept away. The suspension bridge over the Heaphy River was destroyed. The bridge across the Heaphy was the longest suspended deck bridge in the country when it was built in 2013. Although the bridge deck was above normal river level, the bridge was damaged beyond repair in the floods. In addition to the damage to bridges, the severe weather also caused slips and windfall on the track from James Mackay Hut down to the river valley. The section of the track between James Mackay and Heaphy Huts was closed because of the extensive damage, although the rest of the track and huts were re-opened during February for return trips from the two road ends. The rest of the track and all the huts remained open, and the track could be accessed for return trips from either road-end. A helicopter shuttle service was established as an option to take walkers between Lewis Shelter and Heaphy Hut.

The track re-opened in October 2023, after the replacement of bridges and restoration of tracks damaged in the 2022 floods. Prior to the re-opening, 12,000 people had booked accommodation on the track over the next eight months.

==Road access==

From the south, the road from Karamea to the Kōhaihai River is unsealed for the last , .

From the north, the road from Collingwood to Brown Hut is sealed as far as Bainham, then unsealed for the final . The road access was originally via three fords, but after ongoing concern about drivers taking risks in crossing the fords to get to the track, and some becoming stranded in swollen streams, DOC took the unusual step of providing funding to Tasman District Council for three bridges to be built; these were finished in 2014.

The road ends of the Heaphy Track are , hence travel logistics are challenging. Various companies provide travel options, one of which is car transfer from one end to the other. Derry Kingston provided car transfer services until his retirement in 2018, driving a vehicle from one end to the other and then walking back. He probably holds the record of having walked the track the most times, with over 400 crossings.

== Route ==
The track can be travelled in either direction but the route from Golden Bay to Karamea is described here.

=== Brown Hut to Perry Saddle Hut ===

Brown Hut is located only five minutes walk from the carpark at the end of Aorere Valley road. There is a campsite located close to the hut. The track from Brown Hut crosses Brown River and a grassy flat before climbing through regenerating forest. The route to Perry Saddle is almost entirely uphill, and has a consistent gradient. The zigzag path follows the route of a bridle track surveyed and built in 1886 by John Saxon. The track climbs steadily through mature beech forest, mostly red beech (&quot;Nothofagus fusca&quot;) and hard beech (&quot;Nothofagus truncata&quot;) trees, but there are also podocarps including rimu and miro, southern rātā and other species such as kāmahi. Birds that may be seen in the forest on the climb to Perry Saddle Hut include tomtits, robins and bellbird. Kākā may also be seen or heard near the top. There is a side branch of the track reached after about 90 minutes climbing. This leads down to Shakespeare Flat on the Aorere River. After 3–4 hours climb, the Aorere shelter and campsite at about elevation provides a place to rest. The highest point on the Heaphy Track, at , is reached after another hour. There is a lookout point nearby. From here, it is another 30 minutes walk to Perry Saddle Hut. The hut has 28 bunks.

=== Perry Saddle Hut to Gouland Downs Hut ===
From the Perry Saddle Hut, the track passes over the saddle and follows the true left of the Perry Creek. There is a side-trip route up to the peak of Mount Perry, at elevation that in suitable conditions provides panoramic views over the Aorere Valley and Golden Bay towards the North Island, and inland over the Gouland Downs and the rest of the Kahurangi National Park. The main track re-enters forest for about an hour until reaching the edge of the Gouland Downs. The route then descends gradually to the Cave Brook and then reaches the historic Gouland Downs Hut. The existing hut was built by the Collingwood County Council in 1936. There are many limestone arches, caves and small waterfalls that can be accessed near the hut.

==== Geology of the Gouland Downs ====
This area is a peneplain, a low-relief plain formed from prolonged erosion. Beneath the tussock in the Gouland Downs are sandstone and mudstone sedimentary rocks that were formed in the Lower Palaeozoic era around 400 to 500 million years ago. They are some of the oldest rocks in New Zealand. These rocks were worn down by erosion to form the peneplain around 100 million years ago. They were then submerged beneath a shallow sea, and limestone was deposited on top of the older sedimentary rocks. The land was subsequently uplifted, and erosion removed most of the limestone, leaving isolated outcrops that now appear like tree-covered islands in the tussock landscape. The remaining areas of the Gouland Downs have shallow and infertile soil where the only plants that thrive are tussocks and rushes.

==== Introduction of takahē ====
In 2018, the Department of Conservation translocated 30 endangered takahē to the Gouland Downs, from the breeding facility at Burwood Takahē Centre in Southland. This release is part of a programme to ensure the survival of the species. The Gouland Downs area was chosen for the release partly because the Kahurangi National Park has had intensive pest control over many years, and along with natural barriers, this has kept down the population of predators such as cats and ferrets. Takahē can now be regularly seen near Gouland Downs Hut.

=== Gouland Downs Hut to Saxon Hut ===
The track from Gouland Downs Hut continues across the northern part of the Gouland Downs, crossing Shiner Brook, Big River and Weka Creek over swing bridges before descending into the headwaters of the Saxon River and reaching Saxon Hut. The hut is named after John Saxon who surveyed the track in 1886. The endangered blue duck (or whio) may be seen in this section of the route. Great spotted kiwi can often be heard calling in the area around Saxon Hut, and are occasionally seen at night.

=== Saxon Hut to James Mackay Hut ===
The route descends gently through forest to the Saxon River, and then over a flat to Blue Duck Creek. It then climbs through forest in a long sidle around the slopes of Mt Teddy before reaching the Mackay Downs. The James Mackay Hut is on the edge of the downs, and is situated on a terrace above the track. It has views of the Heaphy River mouth and the Tasman Sea to the south-west.

=== James Mackay Hut to Heaphy Hut ===
The track descends through forest along a spur between Deception Creek to the south and the Lewis River to the north. The type of vegetation changes markedly as the track descends towards the Heaphy River. Stunted manuka and beech trees seen at the top become taller, and the sub-canopy and ground vegetation becomes more dense. At the bottom of the descent, there is typical West Coast rainforest, and the first nīkau palms can be seen. There is a shelter near the junction of the Lewis and Heaphy Rivers.

The route then crosses the Heaphy River and the track then follows a large bend in the river under limestone bluffs. The track follows the true left of the Heaphy River and crosses the Gunner River near its junction with the Heaphy. The vegetation along this part of the route is lowland podcarp forest, with an increasing number of nīkau palms closer to Heaphy Hut, where they dominate the forest. The Heaphy Hut and campsite is around back from the beach, overlooking the Heaphy River mouth, with a view of surf and the Tasman Sea.

=== Heaphy Hut to Kōhaihai River mouth ===
This final section of the track is all close to the coastline, with the route partly in forest and partly on the beach or beach margins. There are several stream crossings along the route. The Katipo Creek shelter is located at the mid-point of this section of the track. The landscape of the coastline with its pounding surf and the coastal forest with groves of nīkau palms is described by some as the highlight of the track. Towards the end of this section of the track there is a climb from Scotts Beach to around over a saddle set back from Kōhaihai Bluff. The track then descends to a crossing of the Kōhaihai River and the end of the track at the car park.

==Mountain biking==
Prior to the establishment of Kahurangi National Park in 1996, mountainbiking was a popular activity on the Heaphy Track. In the final 12 months before the North West Nelson Forest Park became a National Park, around 2000 mountain bikers completed the route. At the time, the National Parks Act 1980 did not permit mountain biking in National Parks, other than on formed roads. Lobbying activities to allow the return of mountain biking on the Heaphy track continued through until 2011, when a three-year trial began. The trial permitted mountain biking during the winter season from 1 May to 30 September.

The mountain bike trial period ended in 2016 and mountain biking became a permanent option over the colder part of the year. Mountain biking is now allowed each year from 1 May to 30 November for groups not exceeding six riders.

==Incidents==
The route of the Heaphy Track is subject to high rainfall, and is prone to flooding. Until the 1970s there were significant streams across the track that were not bridged, leading to the risk of trampers becoming stranded, or being swept away while trying to cross a flooded stream.

There was a fatality of a track worker at Kohaihai Bluff in 1919, but there are no recorded deaths from then until the 1960s.

In October 1965, a school teacher from Rockville in the Aorere Valley went missing on the Heaphy Track while attempting to travel on his horse from Karamea back to Rockville. Despite several searches, his body was never found. In March 1972, a visitor from the United States, went missing on the climb up from Brown Hut in poor weather when she became separated from her tramping companion. Despite extensive searches, no trace of her was found. In April 1973, a member of a party from the University of Canterbury Tramping Club was swept away while attempting to cross the flooded Cave Creek. His body was never found. In the report from the subsequent Coroner&#x27;s enquiry, the Coroner said: &quot;Only fit and well-equipped people should attempt to walk the Heaphy Track&quot;.

Controversies in the 1970s about the proposal for a road through Heaphy Track led to increased interest in the track and a large increase in the number of trampers. On one night, there were 82 staying overnight at the Gouland Downs Hut. Around the same time, four people had to be rescued from the track over a period of only two days: one girl with asthma, another girl with glandular fever, a young girl with exposure and a boy with a broken bone in his foot. There had been continual rain for three days with around in one 24 hour period, and the huts had become overcrowded.

In March 1976, a tramper was swept away while attempting to cross the flooded Weka Creek on the Gouland Downs. Her body was never found.

An unusual incident with a happy ending began on 19 January 1980, when a tramper from Palmerston North became disoriented on the descent from Perry Saddle Hut to the end of the track in poor weather and went missing for almost 30 days. His abandoned campsite at Shakespeare Flat on the upper Aorere River was discovered by searchers but he was not found until 18 February – the final day of planned searches. He had travelled upstream when searchers had been expecting he would have moved downstream. He was flown to hospital, and made a good recovery, being discharged in five days. Only a few weeks later, on 17 March 1980 three young trampers from Auckland died when they were swept off rocks at Crayfish Point, just from the end of the track at Kōhaihai.

In March 1982, a solo tramper from Canterbury went missing on the track. He had wandered off the path and become lost after leaving Perry Saddle Hut on the way south. He was eventually found by search parties after he had spent nine days lost in the bush. There was another large search in April 1988 for a nurse from Auckland who had started on the track on her own from the Karamea end in mid March, and was last seen at Heaphy Hut. She was reported missing when she did not arrive home after the end of her holiday. The route was in poor condition at the time after a period of heavy rain, and rivers were swollen. A large search failed to find any sign of the missing woman.

==Through-road controversy==

As early as the 1880s, there was demand for a road to connect Karamea with the Nelson area. In October 1931, the government indicated a willingness to proceed with a road through the route of the Heaphy Track. However, in 1934 government declined to fund further work. In October 1936, Bob Semple, the Minister for Public Works, questioned whether the proposed road was economically viable.

Proposals to build a road became the subject of public controversy in March 1973. The local West Coast and Collingwood population and councils largely supported the road, believing that a complete &quot;tourist circuit&quot; of the South Island would increase the access and popularity of their area. A lobby group called “The Organisation to Preserve the Heaphy”, was formed in April 1973. Other groups opposed to a road through the Heaphy Track included the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society, Federated Mountain Clubs and the Nature Conservation Council.

The Ministry of Works investigated routes for a road between Karamea and Collingwood. Three options were outlined to government in September 1973:

# Along the route of the Heaphy Track from Karamea to Bainham
# Along the route of the Heaphy Track to the Mackay Downs and then north west to the coast at the mouth of the Big River and then along the coast to join the existing road at Turimawiwi
# From Karamea to Tadmor, over the route of the Wangapeka Track

The first option was ruled out because of the impact on the North-west Nelson Forest Park and the effects on the Heaphy Track. The third option was rejected because of the difficulty and cost of building a road through steep and unstable earthquake-shattered terrain. The second “coastal” route was endorsed in principle, but was not an immediate priority. Opposition groups criticised the plan for the destruction of up to of the Heaphy Track, including the unique sub-tropical coastal section. Lobbying from those supporting and opposing the road continued into 1975. In 1976, the Government announced that work on the environmental impact report for the proposed road would not proceed.

In December 1995, just prior to the formal establishment of Kahurangi National Park, the Minister of Lands, Denis Marshall, withdrew the designations of unformed legal road that had been put in place to enable a road between Karamea and Collingwood. In response to further lobbying in 1996 by Buller Mayor Garry Howard, a commentator described the Karamea to Collingwood road as an “idea whose time has gone”.

<doc id="878951" wikidata="Q7969950" url="?curid=878951" title="Warrant of Fitness">
<text>A Warrant of Fitness (WoF) is an official New Zealand document certifying that a light motor vehicle has passed a compulsory periodic inspection of safety and roadworthiness. Most vehicles with a gross mass under that are used on public roads are required to undergo a WoF test, with the frequency depending on the age of the vehicle. Since 1 January 2014, vehicles first registered on or after 1 January 2000 must undergo a WoF test annually; older vehicles must undergo a WoF test every six months. From 1 July 2014, vehicles first registered on or after 1 January 2000 must undergo a WoF test at first registration, at three years, and then annually after that; older vehicles must undergo a WoF test every six months.
Vehicles over , passenger service vehicles (taxis, buses, shuttles, etc.), and rental vehicles do not have a Warrant of Fitness. Instead, these vehicles must possess a Certificate of Fitness (CoF). The CoF test is similar to the WoF test, but must be undergone every six months regardless of the age of the vehicle.

A WoF test checks tyre condition, brake condition, structural condition, lights, glazing, windscreen wipers and washers, doors, seat belts, airbags (if fitted), speedometer, steering and suspension, exhaust, and fuel system. A vehicle must meet certain criteria in each category to pass the Warrant of Fitness. Many local car repair garages throughout New Zealand are authorised to perform testing and to issue Warrants of Fitness.

Each vehicle used on public roads must display a Warrant of Fitness sticker in the top right corner of its windscreen (as viewed from inside the vehicle). The sticker indicates that the vehicle passed its last WoF inspection, and shows when the next inspection is due. The current stickers display on the outside 2 holes punched, one through a number on the side indicating the month due (e.g. a hole through the number 4 indicates the next test is due in April) and one punched though the number on the bottom indicating the year due (e.g. a hole through the numbers 18 indicates the next test is due in 2018). On the inside, the sticker shows the full date of when the next inspection is due, the vehicle registration number, and the issuing agent stamp.

A vehicle with a current WoF can still be inspected by a police officer and ordered unroadworthy. If a vehicle lacks a WOF sticker, or its WOF is expired, the driver is liable for a NZ$200 fine. If a vehicle is found parked on a public road without a valid WoF sticker, the fine may be also issued by a parking warden.

<doc id="878952" wikidata="Q7455979" url="?curid=878952" title="Sesame Place Philadelphia">
<text>Sesame Place Philadelphia is a children&#x27;s theme park and water park based on the children&#x27;s educational television program &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. It is one of the two Sesame Place theme parks owned and operated by United Parks &amp; Resorts under an exclusive license from Sesame Workshop, the non-profit owner of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Located outside of Philadelphia in Middletown Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania (with a Langhorne mailing address), it is the older of the two &quot;Sesame Street&quot; theme parks in the United States (the other being Sesame Place San Diego). Sesame Place Philadelphia includes a variety of rides, shows and water attractions suited for young children, and is the first theme park in the world to become a certified autism center.

== History ==
Sesame Place first opened in 1980 near the Oxford Valley Mall and initiated the expansion of the commercial complex in the vicinity. It was designed by Eric McMillan, a Canadian designer, Sandra Hanna of Lambertville, New Jersey and several other designers.

The park is open from early May through Halloween for The Count&#x27;s Halloween &quot;Spooktacular&quot;, and mid-November through December for &quot;A Very Furry Christmas&quot;. The original park was and featured play areas and large computer labs where kids could color their favorite Sesame Street characters. Since then, it has expanded to with rides and water attractions. The expansions included the construction of Cookie&#x27;s Monster Land in 2014 – the park&#x27;s largest renovation to date.

The theme park is described as having implemented features to make it accessible to children with autism, and on World Autism Awareness Day in 2018 was announced to be the first theme park that is a Certified Autism Center. Certified Autism Centers &quot;[help] businesses better serve guests and clients with cognitive disorders, including autism&quot;.

In 2007, it became the first theme park in Pennsylvania to become completely smoke-free.

Beginning in January 2021, the park began its year-round operation. The park&#x27;s previous operating season ran from April through early January; however, 2021 was the first time the park has ever been open during the winter months. Each weekend was a limited capacity event that featured rides, dance parties, and a parade. In 2023, Sesame Place did not continue year-round operation but only closed between mid-January to mid-February.

In July 2022, a family claimed in an Instagram post that the character Rosita snubbed their two young black children by ignoring them as they waved to her. The video went viral as other users posted similar incidents of costumed characters and black children, with those on social media calling for a boycott of the park. The park released a statement that the costume had made it difficult for the performer to see the girls. They later followed with another statement that the performer had not intentionally snubbed the girls, but instead rejected a request &quot;from someone in the crowd who asked Rosita to hold their child for a photo, which is not permitted.&quot; On July 19, Sesame Place Philadelphia formally apologized to the family and invited the family back for a personal meet-and-greet with the characters. They also announced that their employees will undergo racial bias training to ensure park guests have an &quot;inclusive, equitable and entertaining&quot; experience.

==Attractions==

Sesame Place features dry rides and water rides. Dry rides are open during Elmo&#x27;s Springtacular, the summer season, The Count&#x27;s Halloween Spooktacular and A Very Furry Christmas. Water rides are open only in the summer season (Memorial Day-Labor Day). Other rides are only operated during Elmo&#x27;s Springtacular, The Count&#x27;s Halloween Spooktacular, or A Very Furry Christmas.

<doc id="878955" wikidata="Q2241355" url="?curid=878955" title="United States Lighthouse Service">
<text>The United States Lighthouse Service, also known as the Bureau of Lighthouses, was the agency of the United States Government and the general lighthouse authority for the United States from the time of its creation in 1910 as the successor of the United States Lighthouse Board until 1939 when it was merged into the United States Coast Guard. It was responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of all lighthouses and lightvessels in the United States.

==History==
===1789–1910===
In 1789, the United States Lighthouse Establishment (USLHE) was created and operated under the Department of the Treasury. All U.S. lighthouse ownership was transferred to the government which became the general lighthouse authority (GLA). In 1792, the Cape Henry Lighthouse was the first lighthouse built by the USLHE. In 1822, French physicist, Augustin Fresnel designed the Fresnel lens. In 1841 the Fresnel lens was first used in the United States and installed on the Navesink Lighthouse. In 1852 the Lighthouse Board was created. In 1871, the Duxbury Pier Light became the first caisson lighthouse built in the United States. In 1877, kerosene became the primary fuel for lighthouses, replacing various fuels such as sperm oil, Colza oil, rapeseed oil, and lard oil. In 1884, uniforms came into use by all members of the Lighthouse Board. In 1886, the Statue of Liberty was the first lighthouse to use electricity. In 1898, all coastal lighthouses were extinguished, for the first time in U.S. history, as a precaution during the Spanish–American War. In 1904, the Lightship Nantucket became first U.S. vessel to have radio communication. In 1910, the Bureau of Lighthouses was created and operated as the United States Lighthouse Service (USLHS).

===1910–1917===
In 1910, 11,713 aids to navigation of all types were around the country. Congress abolished the U.S. Light-House Board and created the Bureau of Lighthouses under the Department of Commerce.

The Board had hired a number of civilians and many of these experienced people took over the roles that the military officers had been playing. Though initially called inspectors, the civilian heads of the districts changed their titles to superintendent. Also at this time, the placement of aids to navigation along rivers had become the responsibility of the Lighthouse Service, and many of these aids were tended on a part-time basis by local citizens called lamp lighters and lamp attendants.

President William Taft selected George R. Putnam to head the new bureau and he gained the title &quot;Commissioner of Lighthouses.&quot; For 25 years, Putnam headed the bureau and during his administration, navigational aids saw a substantial increase. New technology was incorporated into the bureau&#x27;s work, particularly in the area of electric aids and some automation using electricity. Though the number of aids to navigation increased substantially during Putnam&#x27;s reign from 11,713 to 24,000, mostly buoys and small lights, arguably two of his most significant achievements were the passage of the Retirement Act for lighthouse personnel in 1918 and the introduction in 1921 of the radiobeacon as an aid to navigation. This new technology permitted a reduction of over 800 employees during Putnam&#x27;s 25 years as head of the bureau.

===World War I===
During World War I and the period following, several technological advances contributed to the automation of lighthouses, rendering human occupancy unnecessary. A device for automatically replacing burned-out electric lamps in lighthouses was developed and placed in several light stations in 1916. A bell alarm warning keepers of fluctuations in the burning efficiency of oil-vapor lamps was developed in 1917. In the same year, the first experimental radiobeacon was installed in a lighthouse. The only lightvessel of the service sunk by enemy action was the &quot;LV-71&quot; on August 6, 1918. After the sinking of the SS &quot;Merak&quot; by the near Diamond Shoals, North Carolina &quot;LV-71&quot; rescued the survivors but was sunk as well shortly thereafter. Nobody was hurt in the action because the German commander allowed the Americans to evacuate the ship before firing.

===1919–1939===
The first automatic radiobeacon in the United States began service in 1928. Radiobeacons are still in use today, although most have recently been decommissioned as improved electronic navigational aids have become available. An automatic time clock for operating electric range lights came into use in 1926, and by 1933, a photo electric-controlled alarm device had been developed to check the operation of the unwatched electric light. A lightship staffed by remote control was equipped by the Lighthouse Bureau in 1934. It included a light, fog signal, and radiobeacon, all controlled by radio signals. A battery-powered buoy which gradually replaced the older acetylene buoys, was introduced in 1935. Because of the technological improvements mentioned above, and in particular the radio beacon direction finder, the United States rose from sixth in shipping safety in 1920 to second in 1935, with only the Netherlands holding a better safety record.

Improvements in the road and highway systems provided better and more rapid means of transportation during the 1920s and 1930s. As a result of the improved roadways, the Bureau was able to better maintain aids to navigation, benefiting the service economically. The extension of electric lines into remote sections of the country provided a reliable power source for operating aids to navigation. By the 1920s and 1930s, the majority of light stations had electric service, reducing the number of staff necessary to operate the station. As ancillary buildings at many stations, especially shore stations, were rendered useless, the makeup of the light station began to change.

In 1935, Putnam was followed in the Commissioner&#x27;s position by a career Lighthouse Service employee, H. D. King, a former district superintendent.

On 1 July 1939, the Service merged with the United States Coast Guard, which has since taken over the maintenance and operation of all U.S. lighthouses and lightships.

==World War II==
On March 15, 1942, the U.S. Lighthouse Service/U.S. Coast Guard tender &quot;Acacia&quot; was sunk by the German submarine .

==Flags==
All of the Lighthouse Service″s lightships and lighthouse tenders flew the United States Lighthouse Service flag, a triangular flag with a red border featuring a blue lighthouse on a white background. Any Lighthouse Service ship upon which the Superintendent of Lighthouses was embarked also flew the Superintendent of Lighthouses flag, a rectangular flag with a blue border featuring the same blue lighthouse on a white background.

==Rank insignia==
Rank insignia of officers were as follows in 1918:

Rank insignia of lighthouse and depot keepers were as follows in 1884:

<doc id="878957" wikidata="Q60867" url="?curid=878957" title="Gospel of Philip">
<text>The Gospel of Philip is a non-canonical Gnostic Gospel dated to around the 3rd century but lost in medieval times until rediscovered by accident, buried with other texts near Nag Hammadi in Egypt, in 1945.

The Gospel is not accepted as canonical by the Christian church. Although it may have some relationship to the beliefs expressed in the Gospel of Thomas, scholars are divided as to whether it should be read as a single discourse or as a collection of otherwise unrelated Valentinian sayings. Sacraments, in particular the sacrament of marriage, are a major theme. As in other texts often associated with what has been referred to as &quot;Gnosticism,&quot; such as the Gospel of Thomas and Gospel of Mary, the Gospel of Philip defends a tradition that gives Mary Magdalene a special relationship and insight into Jesus&#x27;s teaching. The text contains fifteen sayings of Jesus. Seven of these sayings are also found in the canonical gospels, and two are closely related to sayings in the Gospel of Thomas.

== Date of composition ==

The gospel&#x27;s title appears at the end of the Coptic manuscript in a colophon. The text proper makes no claim to be from Philip; the only connection with Philip the Apostle within the text is that he is the only apostle mentioned (at 73,8). Most scholars hold a 3rd-century date of composition.

== History and context ==
A single manuscript of the &quot;Gospel of Philip&quot;, in Coptic (CG II), was found in the Nag Hammadi library, a cache of documents that was secreted in a jar and buried in the Egyptian desert at the end of the 4th century. The text was bound in the same codex that contained the better-known Gospel of Thomas.

From the mix of aphorisms, parables, brief polemics, narrative dialogue, biblical exegesis (especially of &quot;Genesis&quot;), and dogmatic propositions, Wesley W. Isenberg, the editor and translator of the text, has attributed seventeen sayings (&quot;logia&quot;) to Jesus, nine of which characterizes as citations and interpretations of those found in the canonical gospels The new sayings, &quot;identified by the formula introducing them (&#x27;he said&#x27;, &#x27;the Lord said&#x27;, or &#x27;the Saviour said&#x27;) are brief and enigmatic and are best interpreted from a Gnostic perspective.

Much of the Gospel of Philip is concerned with Gnostic views of the origin and nature of mankind and the sacraments it refers to as baptism, unction and marriage. It is not always clear whether these are the same literal rituals known in other parts of the early Christian movement and since, or ideal and heavenly realities. The Gospel emphasizes the sacramental nature of the embrace between man and woman (or ideas represented by these as types) in the &quot;nuptial chamber,&quot; which is an archetype of spiritual unity. Many of the sayings are identifiably related to other texts referred to by scholars as Gnostic, and often appear quite mysterious and enigmatic (these are from the translation by ):





One saying in particular appears to identify the levels of initiation in Gnosticism, although what exactly the &quot;bridal chamber&quot; represented in gnostic thought is a matter of debate:

One possibility is that the bridal chamber refers symbolically to the relationship of trust and singular devotion that should exist between God (bridegroom) and humankind or believer (bride) – just as the marriage relationship (bedchamber) implies a devotion of husband and wife to each other that is expected to exclude all other parties. This symbolic meaning is found for example in the Parable of the Ten Virgins – , &quot;Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom&quot;.

Another interpretation of the Gospel of Philip supported by scholar Marvin W. Meyer, emphasizes Jesus as central focus of the text. Some quotations from the gospel could be inferred as placing Jesus in a central position:



According to Meyer, without Jesus, the rituals and mysteries mentioned in this gospel would have no context.

Furthermore, this text seems to be related to others connected with the Valentinian Christian sect, who worshipped a Christ interpreted through &quot;Gnostic&quot; ideas, and is often linked to what is sometimes thought to be Valentinius&#x27; own composition, the Gospel of Truth. If it was indeed composed in or near Antioch -- as is sometimes suggested by scholars -- it may be that this text was associated with Axionicus of Antioch and his community.

The Gospel of Philip ends with its promise:

=== Mary Magdalene ===
Much of the Gospel of Philip is dedicated to a discussion of marriage as a sacred mystery, and two passages directly refer to Mary Magdalene and her close relationship with Jesus:

In different places in the Gospel of Philip, Mary Magdalene is called Jesus&#x27;s companion, partner or consort, using Coptic variants of the word &quot;koinōnos&quot; (κοινωνός), of Greek origin, or the word &quot;hōtre&quot;, of Egyptian origin. In this passage &quot;koinōnos&quot; is used. &quot;Koinōnos&quot; has a range of possible meanings: at root, it denotes a &quot;person engaged in fellowship or sharing with someone or in something&quot;, but what exactly a &quot;koinōnos&quot; &quot;can share with his or her partner can take many forms, ranging from a common enterprise or experience to a shared business&quot;. In the Bible, &quot;koinōnos&quot; is sometimes used to refer to a spouse (; cf. ), but is also used to refer to a &quot;companion&quot; in faith (), a co-worker in proclaiming the Gospel (), or a business associate (). The Gospel of Philip uses cognates of &quot;koinōnos&quot; and Coptic equivalents to refer to the literal pairing of men and women in marriage and sexual intercourse, but also metaphorically, referring to a spiritual partnership, and the reunification of the Gnostic Christian with the divine realm. And importantly, there are occasions in the Gospel of Philip when the regular Coptic word for &quot;wife&quot; is used directly in reference to people who are clearly spouses, suggesting that the term &quot;koinōnos&quot; is &quot;reserved for a more specific usage&quot; in the Gospel of Philip.

That passage is also interesting for its mention of Jesus&#x27;s sister (Jesus&#x27;s unnamed sisters are mentioned in the New Testament at ), although the text is confusing on that point: she appears to be described first as the sister of Jesus&#x27;s mother Mary (also mentioned in the Gospel of John, possibly the same person as Mary of Clopas), then as the sister of Jesus, although this may be a translation problem.

The other passage, purportedly referring to Jesus kissing Mary Magdalene, is incomplete because of damage to the original manuscript. Several words are missing. Guesses as to what they were are shown below in brackets. Most notably there is a hole in the manuscript after the phrase &quot;and used to kiss her [often] on her...&quot; But the passage appears to describe Jesus kissing Magdalene, apparently described as &quot;barren&quot; and &quot;the mother of the angels&quot; at the beginning of the relevant paragraph and using a parable to explain to the disciples why he loved her more than he loved them:

Some scholars speculate that &quot;hand&quot; is the word after &quot;kiss her... on her&quot;. But it may have been cheek, forehead or feet to simply show respect. translates it as &quot;on her mouth&quot;.

== Problems concerning the text ==
The &quot;Gospel of Philip&quot; is a text that reveals some connections with Early Christian writings of the Gnostic traditions. It is a series of &quot;logia&quot; or aphoristic utterances, most of them apparently quotations and excerpts of lost writings, without any attempt at a narrative context. The main theme concerns the value of sacraments. Scholars debate whether the original language was Syriac or Greek. Wesley W. Isenberg, the text&#x27;s translator, places the date &quot;perhaps as late as the 2nd half of the 3rd century&quot; and places its probable origin in Syria due to its references to Syriac words and eastern baptismal practices as well as its ascetic outlook. The online Early Christian Writings site gives it a date c. 180–250. Meyer gives its date as &quot;2nd or 3rd century&quot;.

== Interpretation ==
The text has been interpreted by as a Christian Gnostic sacramental catechesis. Bentley Layton identified it as a Valentinian anthology of excerpts, and Elaine Pagels and Martha Lee Turner have seen it as possessing a consistent and Valentinian theology. It is dismissed by Catholic author Ian Wilson who argues that it &quot;has no special claim to an early date, and seems to be merely a Mills and Boon-style fantasy of a type not uncommon among Christian apocryphal literature of the 3rd and 4th centuries&quot;.

Latter-day Saint scholar Richard O. Cowan sees a parallel between the &quot;bridal chamber&quot; that is a central theme in the Gospel and the Mormon doctrine of &quot;the new and everlasting covenant of marriage&quot;, or &quot;eternal marriage&quot;.

<doc id="878958" wikidata="Q4470191" url="?curid=878958" title="Leon Wieseltier">
<text>Leon Wieseltier (; born June 14, 1952) is an American critic and magazine editor. From 1983 to 2014, he was the literary editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;. He was a contributing editor and critic at &quot;The Atlantic&quot; until 2017, when the magazine fired him following allegations and an admission by Wieseltier of multiple instances of sexual harassment. In 2020, he became the editor of &quot;Liberties&quot;, a quarterly literary review.

==Early life and education==
Wieseltier was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Stella (Backenroth) and Mark Wieseltier, who were Holocaust survivors from Poland. He attended the Yeshiva of Flatbush, Columbia University, Oxford University, and Harvard University. He was a member of the Harvard Society of Fellows (1979–82).

== Career ==
During his tenure as literary editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Wieseltier played a central role in editing its &quot;back of the book&quot; or literary, cultural, and arts pages. The magazine&#x27;s owner, Marty Peretz, discovered Wieseltier, then working at Harvard&#x27;s Society of Fellows, and installed him in charge of the section.

Wieseltier has published several fiction and nonfiction books. &quot;Kaddish&quot;, a National Book Award finalist in 2000, and a National Jewish Book Award winner in the Nonfiction category in 1998, is a genre-blending meditation on the Jewish prayers of mourning. &quot;Against Identity&quot; is a collection of thoughts about the modern notion of identity.

Wieseltier also edited and introduced a volume of works by Lionel Trilling entitled &quot;The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent&quot; and wrote the foreword to Ann Weiss&#x27;s &quot;The Last Album: Eyes from the Ashes of Auschwitz-Birkenau&quot;, a collection of personal photographs that serves as a paean to pre-Shoah innocence.

Wieseltier&#x27;s translations of the works of Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai have appeared in &quot;The New Republic&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

Wieseltier served on the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq and was an outspoken advocate of the 
George W. Bush administration&#x27;s invasion of Iraq and the Iraq War. &quot;I am in no sense a neoconservative, as many of my neoconservative adversaries will attest,&quot; Wieseltier wrote in a May 2007 letter to Judge Reggie Walton, seeking leniency for his friend Scooter Libby.

In 2013, he was the recipient of the Dan David Prize for being &quot;a foremost writer and thinker who confronts and engages with the central issues of our times, setting the standard for serious cultural discussion in the United States&quot;.

In January 2016, it was announced that Wieseltier would be joining Laurene Powell Jobs to form a new publication devoted to exploring the effects of technology on people&#x27;s lives. But on October 24, 2017, Jobs withdrew funding for the journal after Wieseltier admitted to sexual harassment and inappropriate advances with several former female employees of &quot;The New Republic&quot;. 

In 2020, Wieseltier launched a quarterly journal called &quot;Liberties&quot;, which was described as being dedicated to &quot;the rehabilitation of liberalism&quot;.

=== Sexual harassment acknowledgment (2017)===
In the immediate aftermath of Harvey Weinstein allegations and the #MeToo movement, a list of &quot;Shitty Media Men&quot; that featured men in the media industry who were accused of sexual misconduct was widely shared on the internet. Wieseltier&#x27;s name was on the list.

After it was revealed on October 24, 2017, that several former women employees of &quot;The New Republic&quot; had accused Wieseltier of sexual harassment and inappropriate advances, he admitted to &quot;offenses against some of my colleagues in the past.&quot; In a statement he made after the allegations became public, Wieseltier said: “I am ashamed to know that I made [anyone]... feel demeaned and disrespected. I assure them that I will not waste this reckoning.”

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Several women... said they were humiliated when Mr. Wieseltier sloppily kissed them on the mouth, sometimes in front of other staff members. Others said he discussed his sex life, once describing the breasts of a former girlfriend in detail. Mr. Wieseltier made passes at female staffers, they said, and pressed them for details about their own sexual encounters. Mr. Wieseltier often commented on what women wore to the office... telling them that their dresses were not tight enough. One woman said he left a note on her desk thanking her for the miniskirt she wore to the office that day. She said she never wore a skirt to the office again&quot;.

Another woman who Wieseltier harassed, Sarah Wildman, a former assistant editor of the magazine, later wrote that she was fired for complaining: &quot;In disclosing this incident to my superiors, the outcome was, in many ways, far worse than the act itself. It’s not exactly that I was disbelieved; it’s that in the end, I was dismissed,&quot; she wrote in &quot;Vox&quot;.

Wildman further wrote that the sexual harassment went hand in hand with gender discrimination at the magazine during Peretz&#x27;s and Wieseltier&#x27;s tenure: &quot;The women knew we had a far shallower chance of rising up the masthead than our male counterparts; all of us hoped we’d be the exception. To do so, we entered into a game in which the rules were rigged against us, sometimes pushing us well past our point of comfort in order to remain in play.&quot;

In 2014, an investigation by outside counsel retained by &quot;The New Republic&quot; substantiated allegations Wieseltier had subjected an employee of the magazine’s office building to unwanted sexual advances and harassment. &quot;We directed Mr. Wieseltier to immediately cease any communication with her, and I made sure he knew &quot;The New Republic&quot; had a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment of any kind,&quot; the magazine&#x27;s then owner, Christopher Hughes, said.

On October 24, 2017, Laurene Powell Jobs withdrew funding for the journal Wieseltier had been working to establish after Wieseltier admitted to sexual harassment and inappropriate advances with several former female employees.

On October 27, 2017, Wieseltier was fired by &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.

He was also fired by the Brookings Institution, where he had been the Isaiah Berlin Senior Fellow in Culture and Policy.

==Criticism==
Wieseltier was a frequent target of the satirical monthly &quot;Spy&quot; magazine. It often derided his analyses of pop culture as comically pretentious and mocked him as &quot;Leon Vee-ZEL-tee-AY&quot; who &quot;jealously guards his highbrow credentials while wearing a lowbrow heart on his sleeve&quot;.

In reference to being called a &quot;Jew-baiter&quot; by Wieseltier, Andrew Sullivan has said, &quot;Wieseltier is a connoisseur and cultivator of personal hatred&quot;—referring to a dislike based on &quot;tedious&quot; causes that Wieseltier allegedly has held regarding him for a long time.

Wiesltier was the subject of a 2017 essay, &quot;The Tzaddik of the Intellectuals&quot; written by Joseph Epstein that appeared in &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; (November 3, 2017) and was included in &quot;Gallimaufry&quot;, a collection of Epstein&#x27;s essays published in 2020. See also Tzadik.

==Personal life==
Wieseltier and Mahnaz Ispahani married in 1985, and divorced in 1994. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg officiated at their wedding in 1985.

After a long-term relationship with choreographer Twyla Tharp, he married his second wife, Jennifer Bradley, who worked on urban-development issues at the Brookings Institution. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg would also officiate at their October 2000 wedding. As of 2020, the couple was in the midst of a divorce.

Wieseltier is a fluent Hebrew speaker, and when interviewed in Israel, he said &quot;I feel perfectly at home here.&quot;

==In popular culture==

Wieseltier appeared in one episode of the fifth season of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, playing Stewart Silverman, a character whom Wieseltier described as &quot;a derangingly materialistic co-religionist who dreams frantically of &#x27;Wedding of the Week&#x27; and waits a whole year for some stupid car in which he can idle for endless hours in traffic east of Quogue every weekend of every summer, the vulgar Zegna-swaddled brother of a Goldman Sachs mandarin whose son&#x27;s &quot;siman tov u&#x27;mazel tov&quot; is provided by a pulchritudinous and racially diverse bunch of shellfish-eating chicks in tight off-the-shoulder gowns&quot;.

<doc id="878962" wikidata="Q622506" url="?curid=878962" title="Cycle graph">
<text>In graph theory, a cycle graph or circular graph is a graph that consists of a single cycle, or in other words, some number of vertices (at least 3, if the graph is simple) connected in a closed chain. The cycle graph with vertices is called . The number of vertices in equals the number of edges, and every vertex has degree 2; that is, every vertex has exactly two edges incident with it.

If formula_1, it is an isolated loop.

==Terminology==
There are many synonyms for &quot;cycle graph&quot;. These include simple cycle graph and cyclic graph, although the latter term is less often used, because it can also refer to graphs which are merely not acyclic. Among graph theorists, cycle, polygon, or n&quot;-gon are also often used. The term n&quot;-cycle is sometimes used in other settings. 

A cycle with an even number of vertices is called an even cycle; a cycle with an odd number of vertices is called an odd cycle.

==Properties==
A cycle graph is:
* 2-edge colorable, if and only if it has an even number of vertices
* 2-regular
* 2-vertex colorable, if and only if it has an even number of vertices. More generally, a graph is bipartite if and only if it has no odd cycles (Kőnig, 1936).
* Connected
* Eulerian
* Hamiltonian
* A unit distance graph

In addition: 
*As cycle graphs can be drawn as regular polygons, the symmetries of an &quot;n&quot;-cycle are the same as those of a regular polygon with &quot;n&quot; sides, the dihedral group of order 2&quot;n&quot;. In particular, there exist symmetries taking any vertex to any other vertex, and any edge to any other edge, so the &quot;n&quot;-cycle is a symmetric graph.

Similarly to the Platonic graphs, the cycle graphs form the skeletons of the dihedra. Their duals are the dipole graphs, which form the skeletons of the hosohedra.

==Directed cycle graph==

A directed cycle graph is a directed version of a cycle graph, with all the edges being oriented in the same direction.

In a directed graph, a set of edges which contains at least one edge (or &quot;arc&quot;) from each directed cycle is called a feedback arc set. Similarly, a set of vertices containing at least one vertex from each directed cycle is called a feedback vertex set.

A directed cycle graph has uniform in-degree 1 and uniform out-degree 1.

Directed cycle graphs are Cayley graphs for cyclic groups (see e.g. Trevisan).

<doc id="878968" wikidata="Q1050152" url="?curid=878968" title="Sleepover">
<text>A sleepover (also known as a slumber party or pajama party) is a social occasion in which a young person stays at the home of a friend. Multiple people and/or friends may sleepover at the friend&#x27;s home. Typically a younger person will partake in a sleepover; however, an adult or older person may sleep at a friend&#x27;s home.

== Characteristics ==
A sleepover is an event when a child, without adult presence, spends the night in the presence of other children. The sleepover is often seen as a rite of passage for a young child or teenager, as they begin to assert independence and to develop social connections outside the immediate family.
== Teen sleepovers ==
Beginning in the 1990s, commentators wrote about a perceived new trend of parents endorsing sleepovers for teenagers, with both boys and girls staying overnight together. While some writers decried the trend, others defended it as a safer alternative to teenage dating outside the house.

<doc id="878974" wikidata="Q3817140" url="?curid=878974" title="Kronos (film)">
<text>Kronos (a.k.a. Kronos, Destroyer of the Universe or Kronos, Ravager of Planets) is a 1957 American black-and-white science fiction film from Regal Films, a division of 20th Century-Fox. It was produced by Irving Block, Louis DeWitt, Kurt Neumann, and Jack Rabin, directed by Kurt Neumann, and stars Jeff Morrow and Barbara Lawrence. &quot;Kronos&quot; was distributed as a double feature with &quot;She Devil&quot;.

Since the film&#x27;s release, it has been widely praised for its above-average storyline and its farsighted portrayal of the consequences of over-consumption of both natural and man-made resources; it has achieved minor cult status as a result.

==Plot==
A huge, blinking flying object from deep space emits a glowing ball of electrical energy, which races to Earth. It intercepts a man driving his pickup along an isolated road in the American Southwest desert late at night. It takes over the man&#x27;s mind, directing him to LabCentral, a U.S. research facility, where a pair of scientists have been tracking the flying object, thinking it to be an asteroid.

The possessed man knocks out LabCentral&#x27;s security guard, then proceeds into the main building where the entity leaves the pickup driver and enters the mind of Dr. Hubbell Eliot, the LabCentral chief. Meanwhile, in a research lab below, astrophysicist Dr. Leslie Gaskell and his computer science associate, Dr. Arnold Culver, have been tracking the flying object. They realize that it is not only headed toward Earth but is moving under intelligent guidance. They order three nuclear missiles fired, but they fail to destroy the object, which dives into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Mexico.

The two scientists, along with Vera Hunter, LabCentral&#x27;s staff photographer and Gaskell&#x27;s girlfriend, rush to Mexico. After their arrival, they see an enormous dome, glowing and steaming, appear on the ocean horizon. The next morning, on the beach outside their room, they find that a very tall machine has appeared; its four-legged body has two mobile antennae.

They use a small helicopter to land atop the machine, glimpsing its complex inner workings before being forced to leave and fly back to LabCentral when the machine begins to move. The possessed Dr. Eliot, using lists of power stations and atom-bomb arsenals around the world, telepathically directs the machine. Now named Kronos by the news media, it methodically attacks power plants in Mexico, draining all their energy. In doing so, Kronos grows larger, consuming more and more power as it moves from one power source to the next. Four Mexican Air Force fighter planes attack, but the ever-growing alien machine easily destroys them and continues on its rampage.

Meanwhile, when Kronos is absorbing energy, Eliot is momentarily freed from the influence of the energy force controlling him. Eliot tells his returned colleagues that Kronos is an energy accumulator, sent by an alien race that has exhausted its own natural resources; they have sent their giant machine to drain &quot;all&quot; the Earth&#x27;s available power and then return it to their dying world.

On Eliot&#x27;s recommendation, the United States Air Force sends a B-47 bomber to drop an atomic bomb on Kronos. Gaskell warns the Air Force general in charge that an atomic explosion will simply supply the alien machine with more massive amounts of energy. The general attempts to abort the mission, but Kronos, aware of the plan by way of Dr. Eliot&#x27;s mind, magnetically draws the jet to crash into it, absorbing the bomb&#x27;s nuclear blast. The alien machine, now grown to an immense size, appears unstoppable, harvesting all forms of energy at will.

In another uncontrolled moment, Dr. Eliot locks himself in an hermetically sealed room and smashes the only electronic keypad for the door; he and the energy force which has possessed him expire. As Kronos draws near Los Angeles, Gaskell realizes that reversing the machine&#x27;s polarity will force it to feed upon itself, until it is destroyed in a gigantic implosion. Gaskell, Culver, and Vera convince the Air Force to bombard Kronos with nuclear ions, which will cause the polarity to reverse; the experiment works, and Kronos is completely obliterated in the resulting implosion.

==Cast==

* Jeff Morrow as Dr. Leslie Gaskell
* Barbara Lawrence as Vera Hunter
* George O&#x27;Hanlon as Dr. Arnold Culver
* John Emery as Dr. Hubbell Eliot
* Morris Ankrum as Dr. Albert Stern
* Kenneth Alton as The Pickup Driver (Script name: McCrary)
* Jose Gonzales-Gonzales as Manuel Ramirez
* John Halloran as Lab Central Security Guard
* John Parrish as Gen. Perry
* Marjorie Stapp as The Nurse
* Robert Shayne as Air Force General
* Rosa Turich as Senora Ramirez
* Don Eitner as USAF Meteorology Sergeant
* Ron Kennedy as USAF Control Tower Sergeant
* Gordon Mills as A Sergeant
* Richard Harrison as A Pilot
==Production==

&quot;Kronos&quot; was filmed in a little more than two weeks (mid-January to late January 1957) in California; special effects were created by Jack Rabin, Irving Block, and Louis DeWitt.

The idea of an alien machine absorbing energy is similar to the giant alien machine from the later (1966) &quot;Star Trek&quot; television episode &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot; which destroys planets and uses them to fuel itself.
George O&#x27;Hanlon, who plays Dr. Arnold Culver in the film, had just finished his popular series of Joe McDoakes comedy shorts and would be later known as the voice of George Jetson in the popular cartoon series &quot;The Jetsons&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
When the film was first released in 1957, &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a favorable review: &quot;&quot;Kronos&quot; is a well-made, moderate budget science-fictioner which boasts quality special effects that would do credit to a much higher-budgeted film ... John Emery is convincing as the lab head forced by the outer-space intelligence to direct the monster. Barbara Lawrence is in strictly for distaff interest, but pretty&quot;.

Film critic Dennis Schwartz was disappointed in the film&#x27;s screenplay and acting. He wrote, &quot;German emigre to Hollywood, Kurt Neumann (&quot;Tarzan and the Amazons&quot;/&quot;Son of Ali Baba&quot;/&quot;She Devil&quot;), directs this b/w shot, dull, so-so sci-fi film, that&#x27;s played straight-forward, is humorless and all the thespians are wooden. It&#x27;s based on the story by Irving Block and the weak script is written by Lawrence Louis Goldman&quot;.

<text>Phi Ta Khon (; phǐi taa khǒn; ) is a festival held in Dan Sai, Loei province, Isan, Thailand. The events take place over three days sometime between March and July, the dates being selected annually by the town’s mediums. 

The whole event is called &quot;Bun Luang&quot;, part of a Buddhist merit-making holiday also known as &quot;Bun Phawet&quot; (assembly day). The town’s residents invite protection from &quot;Phra U-pakut&quot;, the spirit of the Mun river. They then hold a series of games and take part in a procession wearing masks made of the sheaths or bottom part of thick palm leaf stems. Bamboo sticky rice steaming baskets are stitched onto the tops of the sheaths to make the top section of the mask. Artists paint the masks with very creative and intricate designs and add carved wooden noses and ear-like appendages. The dancers wear loose and colorful patchwork pants and shirts, with strings of bells hanging down from their belts, in the back. They tease the spectators with big wooden phalluses.

The origins of this part of the festival are traditionally ascribed to a story of the Vessantara Jataka in which the Buddha in one of his past lives as a prince made a long journey and was presumed dead. The celebrations on his return were so raucous as to wake the dead. 

The second day of the festival incorporates elements of the Rocket Festival, plus costume and dance contests and more parades.

On the third and final day, the villagers listen to sermons from Buddhist monks.

<text>Michael Groß (; born 17 June 1964), usually spelled Michael Gross in English, is a former competitive swimmer from Germany. He is tall, and received the nickname &quot;The Albatross&quot; for his especially long arms that gave him a total span of 2.13 meters. Gross, competing for West Germany, won three Olympic gold medals, two in 1984 and one in 1988 in the freestyle and butterfly events, in addition to two World Championship titles in 1982, two in 1986 and one in 1991.

== Career ==
Gross was born in Frankfurt am Main, West Germany, and trained as a member of the swimming club EOSC Offenbach. He was probably the finest swimmer in the world in the 200-meter butterfly race from 1981 to 1988. In this period he set four world records, won two world titles, four European titles and two Olympic gold medals.

At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Gross was one of the great athletes of the games. Gross easily won gold in the 200-meter freestyle, dominating the field. In the 100-meter butterfly, however, Gross pulled off a bit of an upset, winning over the favorite in the event, American Pablo Morales. However, in the 200-meter butterfly, Gross himself was upset by a relative unknown, Australian Jon Sieben. The men&#x27;s 4×200-meter freestyle relay race became one of the marquee events of the games, with Gross leading the German relay against the underdog American squad. Despite the fact that Gross swam the fastest relay leg in the event&#x27;s history, the American team pulled off the upset, earning the title of the &quot;Grossbusters.&quot;

Gross won a total of thirteen medals at the World Championships (including five gold), thirteen gold medals at the European Championships and was elected German &quot;Athlete of the Year&quot; four times (1982, 1983, 1984 and 1988). He retired from professional swimming in 1991.

He is featured in Bud Greenspan&#x27;s &quot;16 Days of Glory&quot;, the documentary film of the 1984 Summer Olympics.

American gold medalist swimmer John Naber remarked to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 1984 that if Michael Gross were an American, he would have won six or seven medals and that Gross was better than Mark Spitz.

Gross was named Male World Swimmer of the Year by &quot;Swimming World Magazine&quot; in 1985 and inducted to the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1995.

Gross studied German and media studies as well as political science at the Goethe University Frankfurt and holds a PhD in philology. He married in 1995 and has a daughter (born 1996) and a son (born 1998).

<text>Michael Edward Gross (born June 21, 1947) is an American television, film, and stage actor. He is notable for playing Steven Keaton on the sitcom &quot;Family Ties&quot; (1982–1989) and survivalist Burt Gummer in the &quot;Tremors&quot; film franchise, being the only actor to appear in all the films and the television show.

==Early life==
Gross was born in Chicago, the son of Virginia Ruth Gross, a telephone operator, and William Oscar Gross, a tool designer. Gross and his younger sister, Mary, were raised Catholic. He attended St. Francis Xavier and St. Genevieve schools in Chicago in his early years, graduating from the latter in 1961.

He attended Kelvyn Park High School on the north side of Chicago, graduating in 1965. He received his drama degree at the University of Illinois Chicago before attending Yale University for his Master of Fine Arts degree. His sister, Mary, a former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member, is an actress. The siblings are first cousins to actor Ron Masak.

== Career ==
Gross was first seen by a broad audience in his role as Steven Keaton in the 1980s sitcom &quot;Family Ties&quot;; he and his co-star Meredith Baxter, who played his wife Elyse Keaton, were born on the exact same day: June 21, 1947. However, his longest-running role has been Burt Gummer in the &quot;Tremors&quot; franchise, having played the role for 30 years from the release of the original &quot;Tremors&quot; in 1990 to &quot;&quot; in 2020. His performance in &quot;Tremors 3: Back to Perfection&quot; earned him a Best Actor award from the DVD Exclusive Awards, formerly known as the Video Premiere Awards.

Gross guest-starred in an episode of the sitcom &quot;Night Court&quot;, in which he played a sexual predator of Markie Post&#x27;s character, Christine Sullivan. In 1988, he portrayed a murderous bank robber in the true life film &quot;In the Line of Duty: The F.B.I. Murders&quot;. His other television credits include &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; (Episode: &quot;Summer Catalog&quot;), &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and two of its spin-offs: &quot;SVU&quot; and &quot;Criminal Intent&quot;. From August 2008 to January 2009, Gross appeared on the CBS soap &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as River Baldwin. Gross appeared in 2000 on &quot;Spin City&quot; as a therapist to Michael J. Fox&#x27;s character on Fox&#x27;s final show as a regular on that program. In November 1979, Gross originated the role of Greta in the Broadway production of Martin Sherman&#x27;s &quot;Bent.&quot;

==Personal life==
Gross has been married to casting director Elza Bergeron since June 2, 1984, and he is the stepfather to her two children.

Gross remains close friends with his Family Ties co-star Meredith Baxter.

Gross is a passionate railfan with an extensive collection of railroad antiques. He is an amateur railroad historian, photographer, modeler, and part-owner in a working railroad, the Santa Fe Southern Railway, a former branch line of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway which operates between Lamy and Santa Fe, New Mexico. He is also the spokesman for the &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Hobby&quot; campaign sponsored by the Model Railroad Industry Association that promotes the hobby of model railroading. He has also been a spokesperson for &quot;Operation Lifesaver&quot;, a campaign promoting safety at railroad grade crossings.

Since 2009, Gross has been the &quot;celebrity spokesman&quot; for the B&amp;O Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. He is also the host of the B&amp;O Railroad Museum Television Network on YouTube and a member of the Santa Fe Railway Historical Society.

Gross is a fan of the Chicago Cubs baseball team. After the Cubs won the 2016 World Series, Gross suggested his character Burt Gummer switch to a Cubs cap for &quot;&quot;, replacing the Atlanta Hawks cap he had worn in the first five films of the series.

<text>This is a collection of temperature conversion formulas and comparisons among eight different temperature scales, several of which have long been obsolete.

Temperatures on scales that either do not share a numeric zero or are nonlinearly related cannot correctly be mathematically equated (related using the symbol =), and thus temperatures on different scales are more correctly described as corresponding (related using the symbol ≘).

* Normal human body temperature is 36.8 °C ±0.7 °C, or 98.2 °F ±1.3 °F. The commonly given value 98.6 °F is simply the exact conversion of the nineteenth-century German standard of 37 °C. Since it does not list an acceptable range, it could therefore be said to have excess (invalid) precision.

Some numbers in this table have been rounded.

== Converting units of temperature differences ==
Converting units of temperature differences (also referred to as temperature deltas) is not the same as converting absolute temperature values, and different formulae must be used.

To convert a delta temperature from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius, the formula is 

To convert a delta temperature from degrees Celsius to kelvin, it is 1:1

<doc id="878979" wikidata="Q941717" url="?curid=878979" title="Maryknoll Sisters">
<text>The Maryknoll Sisters, (formerly the Maryknoll Sisters of St. Dominic/Teresians) are an institute of Catholic religious sisters founded in the village of Ossining, Westchester County, New York, in 1912, six months after the 1911 creation of the Maryknoll community of missionary brothers and fathers. Until 1954, when they became a pontifical institute, the religious institute was known as the Foreign Mission Sisters of St. Dominic. The sisters use the suffix &quot;M.M.&quot; after their names.

==History==
The institute was founded in 1912 by Mother Mary Joseph (née Mary Josephine &quot;Mollie&quot; Rogers), from Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, a graduate of Smith College (1905). In 1914 one of the Teresians&#x27; earliest benefactors, Julia Ward, took Rogers to Europe. They visited Our Lady of Lourdes in France and Vatican City. This was Roger&#x27;s first experience of the European Catholic approach religious congregation devoted specifically to foreign mission work. Having only been exposed to Protestant missionary attitudes at Smith College, Rogers had patterned the Teresians on that model: active, practical, and pious. 

The first group of sisters went to Los Angeles and Seattle in 1914 to work among the children of Japanese immigrants. In 1920, Patrick Joseph Hayes, Archbishop of New York, granted the sisters canonical approval as a diocesan religious community; they became known as &quot;the Foreign Mission Sisters of St. Dominic&quot; in recognition of the religious formation they have received from the Dominican Sisters of Sinsinawa. 

The early missionaries concentrated in East Asia, particularly China (1921) and Korea (1922). World War II interrupted their work. Many Sisters were detained and deported, and two lost their lives. However, numerous South American countries were added as mission sites. Maryknoll Sisters also responded to the needs of refugees in Central America, Africa and Asia.

In 1954, the community became a congregation of pontifical right and changed its name to the &quot;Maryknoll Sisters of St. Dominic&quot;. During the 1950s, the sisters produced &quot;Crusade - The Story of the Bible Retold for Catholic&quot;, a soft covered series of Bible stories for children.

==Present day==
As of 2023, approximately 300 women serve in 18 countries. The sisters profess the evangelical counsels and devote their lives in service overseas. They continue to serve in Hong Kong.

They work in a variety of fields including medicine, communications, education, agriculture, social services and spiritual formation. In North Carolina they operate Helping Hand Developmental Center for pre-schoolers, and St. Gerard House for people affected by autism.

In 1930, at the invitation of Archbishop John Joseph Cantwell, the order purchased a tuberculosis sanatorium in Monrovia, California in order to treat Asian tuberculosis victims within the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. The sanatorium was replaced with a modern hospital during the 1950s. In the 1970s the campus was converted into a residence for the order&#x27;s retirees during the 1970s. The sisters remain active in a variety of ministries. As of 2021, a portion of the six acre site has been put to use by a local non-profit to start a tree-nursery and community garden.

In 2012 the Maryknoll Sisters set aside 42 acres of their 67-acre campus in Ossining, New York as a conservation easement which includes both native woodlands and wetlands.

==Martyrs==

* Maura Clarke, Maryknoll martyr in the 1980 murders of U.S. missionaries in El Salvador
* Ita Ford, Maryknoll martyr in the 1980 murders of U.S. missionaries in El Salvador

== Schools==
Some of the schools the sisters founded are Maryknoll Convent School in Kowloon, Hong Kong; and Holy Spirit School (later Maryknoll Sisters&#x27; School, now Marymount Secondary School) in Happy Valley, Hong Kong.

* Maryknoll School opened in 1927 in Honolulu, Hawaii. 
* Maryknoll College, (now Miriam College) primarily a women&#x27;s school, was founded in 1953 in the eastern edge of Diliman (now Loyola Heights), in Quezon city, Philippines. It evolved from the original Malabon Normal School.
* Maryknoll Academy, (now Maryhill College) a co-educational primary and secondary school, was founded in 1938 initially name as Lucena Catholic School in the heart of Lucena (near St. Ferdinand Cathedral Parish), in Quezon Province, Philippines. Management of the school was handed over to the lay administration in 1976 and later renamed as Maryhill Academy and in 1996 the status of the school changed from Academy to College upon the opening of Higher Education Department now owned and managed by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lucena
* Maryknoll Convent School in Baguio City which was renamed to Marishan School in 1977 was a co-educational primary school since 1933. (reference: )

<text>The Torcuato Di Tella University () is a non-profit private university in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Founded in 1991, the university focused primarily on social sciences.

The undergraduate majors available are economics, business economics, digital technologies, business administration, law, political science, international relations, social sciences, history, architecture and design. The university also offers over 34 graduate programs.

The faculty comprises 98 full-time research professors, most of whom hold PhDs from universities in North America and Europe. The university provides more than 50 exchange programs with universities in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, Africa and Asia. There is also a sizable number of international students who study in the university for a semester or two. The university&#x27;s President is Juan José Cruces. 

==History==

===Background and foundation===
The concept of the new university was developed by the university&#x27;s first dean, Gerardo della Paolera, and the then Argentine ambassador to the United States, Guido di Tella. They decided to adopt an American university model, and to create a research-based university with small class sizes and professors with international studies and recognition.

Universidad Torcuato Di Tella was founded in 1991, with the mission of educating new generations of academic, business, social and political leaders. It was founded by the Torcuato di Tella Foundation, making use of the experience and resources of the Torcuato di Tella Institute. The latter, a non-profit institute founded in 1958 to promote research in the scientific, cultural and artistic development of Argentina, became a leading local center for avant-garde art during the 1960s. The establishments&#x27; namesake, Torcuato di Tella, had been a leading Argentine industrialist through his Siam di Tella conglomerate founded in 1911.

It began offering undergraduate studies in economics in 1992, but has since expanded and started offering undergraduate courses in business economics, political sciences, international studies, law, history, architecture and business administration, as well as numerous graduate degrees.

Gerardo della Paolera was president of Universidad Torcuato Di Tella from its foundation until 2001, when he was replaced by the economist Juan Pablo Nicolini. Nicolini was reelected to the presidency in 2005, and continued in the position until September 2010, as he was ineligible for reelection to the post due to term limits established by the university&#x27;s charter. The reputed sociologist and political analyst Manuel Mora y Araujo became president in 2009 and continued in that role until his resignation in May 2011 for personal reasons. Ernesto Schargrodsky, dean of the Business School, was subsequently named president. He was re-elected in 2014 to serve a full four-year term.

In May 2019, after his two four-year terms, Schargrodsky was replaced by the economist Juan José Cruces, director of the Research on Finance Center and former dean of the Business School; he was reelected for a second four-year term.

===Move to the Figueroa Alcorta campus===
In March 2013, Universidad Torcuato di Tella moved to a new building on Avenue Figueroa Alcorta. The 13,700 m2 building is a redeveloped waterworks building was constructed between 1937 and 1942. It was put up for a tender in 1998 after &quot;Obras Sanitarias de la Nación&quot; was privatized, for which the university submitted the winning bid. The winning design was by a group of architects led by architects Clorindo Testa, Juan Fontana, Juan Barros Tomé and Horacio Rodrigo.

Works on the building had begun in 2002 and the business school had been working from this campus since 2004 on 1,200m2.

The university in its entirety runs from this campus since 2013, and it has been extended twice and a green terrace was opened on its roof with views of the Rio de La Plata. From 2011 to 2018, the number of students has tripled, putting pressure on the university&#x27;s infrastructure. In order to cater for the continued growth of the university, plans were made to construct a new building, which would be able to house an additional 1,000 students.

In December 2015, a competition was held to select the design of the building, which was won by Spanish architect Josep Ferrando, who proposed a modern building with an industrial style and allows for a flexible use of its space. The nine-floor building, with 11,646 m2 of surface space and an LEED certification, was inaugurated in March 2019 with Argentine vice-president Gabriela Michetti and the deputy mayor of Buenos Aires, Diego Santilli in attendance.

In 2022, due to the continued growth of the university, a new international architectural competition was held for the New Parque Building and a new Central Piazza. The winning design was by the BRUTHER studio in Paris. Construction of the 27,600 m2 building began in December 2023 and is expected to be completed by 2026. 

===Notable graduates===
Javier Milei, Marcos Peña, Nicolás Dujovne, Hernán Lacunza, Nicolás Massot, Carlos Melconian, Santiago Cafiero, Hernán Lorenzino, Esteban Matic, Paula Forteza, and Iván Werning are some of the university&#x27;s most important graduates.

<doc id="879000" wikidata="Q1245160" url="?curid=879000" title="Destination Moon (film)">
<text>Destination Moon (a.k.a. Operation Moon) is a 1950 American Technicolor science fiction film, independently produced by George Pal and directed by Irving Pichel, that stars John Archer, Warner Anderson, Tom Powers, and Dick Wesson. The film was distributed in the United States and the United Kingdom by Eagle-Lion Classics.

&quot;Destination Moon&quot; was the first major U.S. science fiction film to deal with the practical scientific and engineering challenges of space travel and to speculate on what a crewed expedition to the Moon would look like. Noted science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein contributed to the screenplay.

The film&#x27;s premise is that private industry will mobilize, finance, and manufacture the first spacecraft to the Moon, and that the U.S. government will be forced to purchase or lease the technology to remain the dominant power in space. Different industrialists cooperate to support the private venture.

In the final scene, as the crew approaches the Earth, the traditional &quot;The End&quot; title card heralds the dawn of the coming Space Age: &quot;This is THE END...of the Beginning&quot;.
==Plot==
When their latest rocket test fails and government funding collapses, rocket scientist Dr. Charles Cargraves and space enthusiast General Thayer enlist the aid of aircraft magnate Jim Barnes. With the necessary millions raised privately from a group of patriotic U.S. industrialists, Cargraves, Thayer, and Barnes build an advanced single-stage-to-orbit atomic powered spaceship, named &quot;Luna&quot;, at their desert manufacturing and launch facility.

The project is soon threatened by a ginned-up public uproar over &quot;radiation safety&quot; but the three circumvent legal efforts to stop their expedition by launching the world&#x27;s first Moon mission ahead of schedule. As a result, they must quickly substitute Joe Sweeney as their expedition&#x27;s radar and radio operator, a replacement for Brown, now in the hospital with appendicitis.

En route to the Moon they are forced to spacewalk outside. They stay firmly attached to &quot;Luna&quot; with their magnetic boots so they can easily walk up to and free the frozen piloting radar antenna that the inexperienced Sweeney innocently greased before launch. In the process, Cargraves becomes untethered in free fall and is lost overboard. He is retrieved by Barnes, who cleverly uses a large oxygen cylinder with nozzle, retrieved by General Thayer, as an improvised propulsion unit to return them to &quot;Luna&quot;.

After achieving lunar orbit, the crew begins the complex landing procedure, but expedition leader Barnes uses too much fuel during the descent. Safely on the Moon, they explore the lunar surface and describe by radio their view of the Earth, as contrasted against the star-filled lunar night sky. Using forced perspective, Barnes photographs Sweeney pretending to &quot;hold up&quot; the Earth like a modern Atlas. Events take a serious turn for the crew, however, when they realize that with their limited remaining fuel they must lighten &quot;Luna&quot; in order to achieve lunar escape velocity.

No matter how much non-critical equipment they strip and discard on the lunar surface, the hard numbers radioed from Earth continue to point to one conclusion: one of them will have to remain on the Moon if the others are to safely return to Earth. With time running out for their return launch window, the crew continues to engineer their way home. They finally jettison the ship&#x27;s radio, losing contact with Earth. In addition, a spent oxygen cylinder is used as a tethered, suspended weight to pull their sole remaining space suit outside through the open airlock, which is then remotely closed and resealed. With the critical take-off weight finally achieved, and with all her crew safely aboard, &quot;Luna&quot; blasts off from the Moon for home.

==Production==
Before &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, there were very few serious science fiction films: 1929&#x27;s &quot;Frau im Mond&quot; (English &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot;), 1931&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, and 1936&#x27;s &quot;Things to Come&quot; are antecedents (though containing fantasy elements). However, the more juvenile-oriented Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers stories of the 1930s syndicated science fiction newspaper comic strips that were both adapted into radio serials and Universal Pictures film serials.

George Pal was a Hungarian who made commercials that played as short subjects with feature films in Europe. He later advanced into animated cartoon-like short features that were made using carefully hand-manipulated tiny sculptures instead of drawings; these shorts were called “Puppetoons”, and they became popular in Europe. Pal was in the U.S. when Hitler invaded Poland. He was offered a contract to produce his Puppetoons for Paramount Pictures, some of which were later nominated for Academy Awards.

===Development===
By 1949, Pal wanted to get into feature film production. He convinced the independent Eagle-Lion Films to co-finance his own two-picture deal, with him putting up half of the money. Part of the finance came from Peter Rathvorn and Floyd Odlum, who used to run RKO. The first of the two films, &quot;The Great Rupert&quot;, about a Puppetoon-like dancing squirrel, starring popular comic Jimmy Durante, flopped at the box office. But his second feature, &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, was a major hit.

Eagle-Lion&#x27;s publicity department saw the promotional possibilities for a film about a rocket expedition to the Moon. They promoted the film heavily in both general family magazines and in many science fiction digest magazines, emphasizing its Technicolor visuals and expert consultants. &quot;Destination Moon&quot; was constantly in the limelight of the era&#x27;s popular press, including the high-profile &quot;Life magazine&quot;; by the time the film was shown in theaters, its success seemed a foregone conclusion.

Pal commissioned an initial screenplay from screenwriters James O&#x27;Hanlon and Rip Van Ronkel, but science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein contributed significantly to &quot;Destination Moon&quot;&#x27;s final screenplay, and also served as the film&#x27;s technical adviser. Certain story elements from Heinlein&#x27;s 1947 juvenile novel &quot;Rocket Ship Galileo&quot; were adapted for use in the film, and in September, 1950, he published a tie-in novella, &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, based on the screenplay. The film&#x27;s storyline also resembles portions of Heinlein&#x27;s novel &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon&quot;, which he wrote in 1949 but did not publish until 1951, a year after the Pal film opened.

===Matte paintings by Bonestell===
&quot;Destination Moon&quot; uses matte paintings by noted astronomical artist Chesley Bonestell. These were used for the departure of the &quot;Luna&quot; from Earth; its approach to the Moon; the spaceship&#x27;s landing on the lunar surface; and a panorama of the lunar landscape. An oft-noted criticism of the film is the fact that the lunar surface is crisscrossed with gaping cracks. Mudcracks would imply that the surface was once mud, which requires water, and the Moon does not have water. Bonestell, who painted the large backdrop that mimicked lunar crags and mountains, was unhappy with the cracks, which were designed by art director Ernst Fegté. “That was a mistake”, he insisted to Gail Morgan Hickman, author of &quot;The Films of George Pal&quot;. But Pal explained to Hickman, “Chesley was right, of course ... but we were shooting on a small sound stage because of our limited budget. We had to make the set look bigger. Chesley designed a beautiful backdrop, but it needed something to give it depth. That’s why we made the cracks. The cracks in the foreground were big and those in the distance were small, so it gave a real feeling of perspective. For some scenes we even used midgets in small spacesuits to add to the feeling of depth”.

===Director===
Irving Pichel began his Hollywood career as an actor during the 1920s and early 1930s, in such films as &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and &quot;The Story of Temple Drake&quot;. He began directing in 1932; &quot;Destination Moon&quot; was his 30th film. Pichel was blacklisted after he was subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947, despite having never been called to testify. He directed five more films after &quot;Destination Moon&quot; before his death in 1954.

===Woody Woodpecker===
George Pal and Walter Lantz, who created the cartoon character Woody Woodpecker, had been close friends ever since Pal left Europe and arrived in Hollywood. Out of friendship and for good luck, Pal always tried to include Woody in all his films. (On the commentary track of the Special Collector&#x27;s DVD Edition of George Pal&#x27;s science fiction film &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1953), actors Ann Robinson and Gene Barry point out that Woody can be seen in a tree top, center screen, near the beginning of their film.)

Pal incorporates Woody (voiced by Grace Stafford) in a cartoon shown within the film that explains, in layman&#x27;s terms to a 1950 movie theater audience, the scientific principles behind space travel and how a trip to the Moon might be accomplished. The cartoon is shown to a gathering of U.S. industrialists who, it is hoped, will patriotically finance such a daring venture before an unnamed, non-western power can do so successfully.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack music, written by composer Leith Stevens, is noteworthy for its atmospheric themes and musical motifs, all of which add subtle but important detail and emotion to the various dramatic moments in the film. According to George Pal biographer Gail Morgan Hickman, &quot;Stevens ... consulted with numerous scientists, including Wernher von Braun, to get an idea of what space was like in order to create it musically.&quot; The Stevens &quot;Destination Moon&quot; film score had its first U.S. release in 1950 on a 10-inch 33 rpm Monaural LP by Columbia Records (#CL 6151):

Later in the 1950s, the score was re-released on a 12-inch high-fidelity mono LP by Omega Disk (#1003). Omega Disk re-released it in 1960 as a stereophonic 33 1/3 LP (#OLS-3). In 1980, the score was re-released on stereo LP by Varèse Sarabande (#STV 81130) and again in 1995 on stereo LP by Citadel Records (#STC 77101). An expanded and complete 56.32 minute version of Steven&#x27;s original film score, limited to 1,000 copies, was released on CD in 2012 by Monstrous Movie Music (#MMM-1967); also on the CD is Clarence Wheeler&#x27;s incidental music used for the film&#x27;s Woody Woodpecker cartoon. An illustrated 20-page booklet of liner notes is also included.

==Reception==
===Release===
Despite a budget of approximately $500,000 and a large national print media and radio publicity campaign preceding its delayed release, &quot;Destination Moon&quot; ultimately became the &quot;second&quot; space adventure film of the post-World War II era. Piggybacking on the growing publicity and expectation surrounding the Pal film, Lippert Pictures quickly shot &quot;Rocketship X-M&quot; in 18 days on a $94,000 budget. The film, about the first spaceship to land on Mars, opened theatrically 25 days before the Pal feature. Nevertheless, despite the fact that &quot;Destination Moon&quot; was indeed the second space film of the era to be released to theaters, its two years of production, hefty budget, its use of Technicolor, its significant influence in the film industry, and the technical consultation by important scientists and engineers during production—the ultimate value of the picture, also its priority, transcends the mere physical fact that it was second in the marketplace. Certainly, &quot;Rocketship X-M&quot; itself would never have been made if the highly probable success of &quot;Destination Moon&quot; had not caught Robert Lippert&#x27;s attention.

===Critical reaction===
The film has had numerous admirers and detractors over the years.

====Contemporary reviews====
Bosley Crowther in his review of &quot;Destination Moon&quot; for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, opined, &quot;... we&#x27;ve got to say this for Mr. Pal and his film: they make a lunar expedition a most intriguing and picturesque event. Even the solemn preparations for this unique exploratory trip, though the lesser phase of the adventure, are profoundly impressive to observe&quot;.

Science writer, science fiction novelist, and early space enthusiast Arthur C. Clarke wrote: &quot;[T]his [is a] remarkable exciting and often very beautiful film, the first Technicolor expedition into space. After years of comic strip treatment of interplanetary travel, Hollywood has at last made a serious and scientifically accurate film on the subject, with full cooperation of astronomers and rocket experts. The result is worthy of the enormous pains that have obviously been taken, and it is a tribute to the equally obvious enthusiasm of those responsible&quot;.

====Later 20th century reviews====
“Trivial in plot ... viewed today &quot;Destination Moon&quot; is less than impressive; the rocket journey is ploddingly consistent with the scientific standards of 1950... &quot;Destination Moon&quot; makes rather dull viewing nowadays”. —John Baxter in &quot;Science Fiction in the Cinema&quot; (1970)

In his 1979 autobiography, science writer and science fiction novelist Isaac Asimov called the Pal film &quot;the first intelligent science-fiction movie made&quot;.

&quot;Today it seems dated and slow-moving with flat characters&quot;. —John Brosnan in &quot;The Science Fiction Encyclopedia&quot; (1979)

Peter Nicholls in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; (1993) said, “&quot;Destination Moon&quot; is a film with considerable dignity and, in a quiet way, a genuine sense of wonder”.

“The &quot;Destination Moon&quot; script seems colorless and wooden”. —Phil Hardy in &quot;The Overlook Film Encyclopedia: Science Fiction&quot; (1994)

====21st century reviews====
“&quot;Destination Moon&quot; now seems tame”. —John Stanley in &quot;Creature Features: The Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Movie Guide&quot; (2000)

“The visual effects in Pal’s [&quot;Destination Moon&quot;] were art. They are aesthetically stunning ... they bear the imprint of gifted artists’ hands... The Luna rocket of &quot;Destination Moon&quot; still [has] the capacity to astonish”. —Justin Humphreys in “A Cinema of Miracles: Remembering George Pal”, from the memorial program notes for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ &quot;George Pal: Discovering the Fantastic: A Centennial Celebration&quot;, August 27, 2008

In 2010, author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film two-and-a-half out of four stars, calling it &quot;modestly mounted but still effective&quot;. He also praised Bonestell&#x27;s lunar paintings as being visually striking.

“&quot;Destination Moon&quot; has aged badly ... [it] seems old hat and pedestrian to today’s viewers... But make no mistake about it, this picture, flaws and all, is a very important step in the evolution of the serious, special effects-laden science fiction motion picture that reached its peak with ... &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;”. — Barry Atkinson in &quot;Atomic Age Cinema&quot; (2014)

===Awards and honors===
&quot;Destination Moon&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Special Effects in the name of the effects director, Lee Zavitz. The film was also nominated for the Art Direction Academy Award, by Ernst Fegté and George Sawley.

At the 1st Berlin International Film Festival it won the Bronze Berlin Bear Award, for &quot;Thrillers and Adventure Films&quot;.

Retro Hugo Awards: A special 1951 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation was retroactively awarded to &quot;Destination Moon&quot; by the 59th World Science Fiction Convention (2001) exactly 50 years later for being one of the science fiction films eligible in calendar year 1950. (50 years, 75 years, or 100 years govern the time periods when a Retro Hugo can be awarded by a Worldcon for the years prior to 1953 when the Hugos were established and first awarded.)

==Adaptations==
Episode 12 of the &quot;Dimension X&quot; radio series was called &quot;Destination Moon&quot; and was based on Heinlein&#x27;s final draft of the film&#x27;s shooting script. During the broadcast on June 24, 1950, the program was interrupted by a news bulletin announcing that North Korea had declared war on South Korea, marking the beginning of the Korean War.

Robert A. Heinlein published a short story adaptation of his screenplay in the September 1950 issue of &quot;Short Stories&quot; magazine.

A highly condensed version of the Dimension X &quot;Destination Moon&quot; radio play was adapted by Charles Palmer and was released by Capitol Records for children, who had become familiar with their recordings through a Bozo the Clown-approved record series. The series featured 7-inch, 78-rpm recordings and full-color booklets which children could follow as they listened to the stories. The &quot;Destination Moon&quot; record was narrated by Tom Reddy, and Billy May composed the incidental and background music. The record&#x27;s storyline took considerable liberties with the film&#x27;s plot and characters, although the general shape of the film story remained.

In 1950, Fawcett Publications released a 10-cent &quot;Destination Moon&quot; film tie-in comic book. DC Comics also published a comic book preview on the Pal film; it was the cover feature of DC&#x27;s brand new science fiction anthology comic book &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; # 1 (September 1950).

<doc id="879001" wikidata="Q1555065" url="?curid=879001" title="House of Scindia">
<text>House of Scindia or earlier known as the Sendrak was a Hindu Maratha Royal House that ruled the erstwhile Gwalior State in central India. It had the Patil-ship of Kanherkhed in the district of Satara and was founded by Ranoji Scindia, who was sardar of maratha empire and real maratha warrior clan appointed by chattrapati shahuji maharaj-1&#x27;s servant family from kokan worked as prime minister also known as Peshwa Bajirao I. Ranoji and his descendants, along with their rivals the Holkars, played a leading role during the Maratha ascendancy in northern India in the 18th-century. The Gwalior State became a princely state during the British Raj in the 19th and the 20th-centuries. After India&#x27;s independence in 1947 and the abolition of princely states, several members of the Scindia Dynasty went on to enter Indian politics.

==Foundation==

The Scindia dynasty was founded by Ranoji Scindia, a personal servant and soldier of Peshwa Bajirao I. Ranoji prospered early under Bajirao because of the favorable circumstances created by the appointment of Bajirao as the Peshwa at the age of twenty. This had evoked jealousy from senior officials like Anant Ram Sumant, Shripatrao Pant Pratinidhi, Khanderao Dabhade and Kanhoji Bhosle.This led Baji Rao to promote as commanders of his troops, talented young men who were barely out of teens such as Malhar Rao Holkar, the Pawar (Puar) brothers, Pilaji Jadhav, Fateh Singh Bhosale and of course, Ranoji. None of these men belonged to families that held hereditary Deshmukhi rights under earlier rulers such as the Deccan Sultanates. The Shindes or Scindias had served as shiledars (cavalrymen) under the Bahmani Sultanate and played an important role in the state of affairs and held Patilki of Kumberkerrab.

There are otherwise several anecdotes about the origin of the Scindhias (Shindes), especially those recorded by Sir John Malcolm. Stewart Gordon states the cultivator, etc. origin of other Marathas.

==History==
===Maratha Period===

The Scindia dynasty was founded by Ranoji Scindia, who was the son of Jankojirao Scindia, the Patil of Kanherkhed, a village in Satara District, Maharashtra. Peshwa Baji Rao&#x27;s career saw the strengthening of the Maratha Empire. Ranoji was in charge of the Maratha conquests in Malwa in 1726. Ranoji established his capital at Ujjain in 1731. His successors included Jayajirao, Jyotibarao, Dattajirao, Jankojirao, Mahadji Shinde and Daulatrao Scindia.The Scindias became a major regional power in the latter half of the 18th century, and figured prominently in the three Anglo-Maratha Wars.They held sway over many of the Rajput states, and conquered north India. In 1818, after accepting the terms of a subsidiary alliance with the British, the family shifted their base from Ujjain to Gwalior.

===Rulers of Gwalior state under the British===
After the defeat of the allied Maratha states by the British in the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1818, Daulatrao Shinde was forced to accept local autonomy as a princely state within British-occupied India and to give up Ajmer to the British. After the death of Daulatrao, Maharani Baiza Bai ruled the empire, saving it from the British power, till the adopted child Jankoji Rao took over the charge. Jankoji died in 1843, and his widow Tarabai Raje Scindia successfully maintained the position and adopted a child from close lineage named Jayajirao.

===Accession of Gwalior state into Independent India===
The Scindia family ruled Gwalior until India&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom in 1947, when the Maharaja Jivajirao Scindia acceded to the Government of India. Gwalior was merged with a number of other princely states to become the new Indian state of Madhya Bharat. Jiwajirao Scindia served as the state&#x27;s rajpramukh, or appointed governor, from 28 May 1948 to 31 October 1956, when Madhya Bharat was merged into Madhya Pradesh.

===Political careers of family members===
In 1962, Vijayraje Scindia, the widow of Maharaja Jiwajirao, was elected to the Lok Sabha, beginning the family&#x27;s career in electoral politics. She was first a member of the Congress Party, and later became an influential member of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Her son Madhavrao Scindia was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1971 representing the Jansangh Party, he joined Congress in 1980 and served until his death in 2001. His son, Jyotiraditya Scindia, joined the Congress Party and was elected to the seat formerly held by his father in 2004. He later joined the Bharatiya Janata Party on 11 March 2020.

Vijayaraje&#x27;s daughters have supported the Bharatiya Janata Party. Vasundhara Raje Scindia contested and won five parliamentary elections from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Under the Vajpayee government from 1998 onwards, Vasundhara was in charge of several different ministries. In 2003 she led the Bharatiya Janata Party to its largest majority in Rajasthan, and became the state&#x27;s Chief Minister. In 2013 again, she led Bharatiya Janata Party to a thumping win in the state of Rajasthan, winning over 160 out of the 200 seats in the assembly elections. Her other daughter, Yashodhara Raje Scindia, contested assembly elections from Shivpuri in Madhya Pradesh and won in 1998, 2003 and 2013 and also lok sabha 2004, 2009 from Gwalior. Upon the BJP&#x27;s win in the state, she became the state&#x27;s Minister for Tourism, Sports and Youth Affairs. Vasundhara&#x27;s son Dushyant Singh entered the Lok Sabha in 2004 from Rajasthan.

<text>Philippine English (similar and related to American English) is a variety of English native to the Philippines, including those used by the media and the vast majority of educated Filipinos and English learners in the Philippines from adjacent Asian countries. English is taught in schools as one of the two official languages of the country, the other being Filipino, a standardized form of Tagalog. Due to the influx of Philippine English teachers overseas, Philippine English is also becoming the prevalent variety of English being learned in the Far East as taught by Filipino teachers in various Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and Thailand among others. Due to the highly multilingual and bilingual nature of the Philippines, code-switching such as Taglish (Tagalog-infused English) and Bislish (English infused with any of the Bisayan languages) is prevalent across domains from casual settings to formal situations.

==History==
Filipinos were first introduced to English when the British invaded and occupied Manila and Cavite in 1762 as part of the Seven Years&#x27; War. Still, this occupation had no lasting effect on English in the country. A national variety called Philippine English evolved as a result of American colonization and was arguably one of the fastest to develop in the postcolonial world. Its origins as an English language spoken by a large segment of the Philippine population can be traced to the American introduction of public education, taught in the English medium of instruction. This was marked by the arrival of the Thomasites in 1901, immediately during re-colonization after the Philippine Revolution in the late 19th century up to early 1900. After a tumultuous period of colonial transition, Filipino leaders and elites, and the American colonial government alike began discussing the formation of a Philippine national language. The retained high ethnolinguistic diversity of the new colony was due to a low penetration of Spanish under Spain&#x27;s rule. Spanish was limited to a medium of instruction for the landed elites and gentry. By the end of Spanish colonization and the Philippine–American War in 1903, only 10% of the colonial population could speak Spanish. The lingering effects of Spanish amongst the general population nevertheless had notable effects on the lexical development of many Philippine languages, and even Philippine English, in the form of Hispanisms. Tagalog was selected as the basis for a national language in 1937, and has since remained so. It was re-labelled as &quot;Pilipino&quot; in 1959, and &quot;Filipino&quot; in 1987. With the successful establishment of American-style public education with English as a consequential medium, more than 20% of the Philippine population was reported to be able to understand and speak English just before the turn of the mid-20th century. This meteoric growth was sustained post-World War II, much further through Philippine mass media (e.g., newsprint, radio, television), where English also became the dominant language, and by the ratification into the current Philippine Constitution in 1987, both Filipino and English were declared co-official languages, while removing Spanish as an official language. In 2020, the Philippines was ranked 27th worldwide (among 100 countries ranked) in the EF English Proficiency Index. In the same report, it was ranked 2nd in Asia next only to Singapore.

Today Philippine English, as formally called based on the World Englishes framework of linguist Braj Kachru, is a recognized variety of English with its distinct lexical, phonological, and grammatical features (with considerable variations across socioeconomic groups and level of education being predictors of English proficiency in the Philippines). As the English language became highly embedded in Philippine society, it was only a matter of time before the language was indigenized to the point that it became differentiated from English varieties found in the United States, United Kingdom, or elsewhere. This, along with the formal introduction of the World Englishes (WE) framework to English language scholars in the Philippines, opened the floodgates to research on this new emerging English, which has since been branded as such as Philippine English.

===Philippine English in the services sector===
The abundant supply of English speakers and competitive labor costs enabled the Philippines to become a choice destination for foreign companies wishing to establish call centers and other outsourcing. English proficiency sustains a major call center industry and in 2005, America Online had 1,000 people in what used to be the US Air Force&#x27;s Clark Air Base in Angeles City answering ninety percent of their global e-mail inquiries. Citibank does its global ATM programming in the country, and Procter &amp; Gamble has over 400 employees in Makati, a central Manila neighborhood, doing back office work for their Asian operations including finance, accounting, human resources and payments processing.

An influx of foreign students, principally from South Korea, has also led to growth in the number of English language learning centers, especially in Metro Manila, Baguio, Metro Cebu and Metro Bacolod.

==Positioning==
In 2003, Edgar W. Schneider defined a Dynamic Model of the evolution of Postcolonial Englishes, positioning Philippine English in Phase 3, &quot;Nativization&quot;. In 2016, Ariane Macalinga Borlongan argued in a research article that Philippine English had met the parameters set for repositioning into Phase 4, &quot;Endonormative stabilization&quot;.

==Orthography==
Philippine laws and court decisions, with extremely rare exceptions, are written solely in English. English is also used in higher education, religious affairs, print and broadcast media, and business. Most well-educated Filipinos are bilingual and speak English as one of their languages. For highly technical subjects such as nursing, medicine, computing and mathematics, English is the preferred medium for textbooks and communication. Very few would prefer highly technical books in either Filipino or the regional language. Movies and TV shows in English are usually not dubbed in most cable channels except a few such as Tagalized Movie Channel.

Because English is part of the curricula from primary to secondary education, many Filipinos write and speak in fluent Philippine English, although there might be differences in pronunciation. Most schools in the Philippines, however, are staffed by teachers who are speakers of Philippine English and hence notable differences from the American English from which it was derived are observable.
==Grammar==
Philippine English traditionally follows American English spelling and grammar while it shares some similarity to Commonwealth English. Philippine English follows the latter when it comes to punctuation as well as date notations. For example, a comma almost never precedes the final item in an enumeration (much like the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; and other style guides in English-language journalism generally).
* Dates are often read with a cardinal instead of an ordinal number. (Example: January 1 is pronounced as &quot;January one&quot; instead of &quot;January first&quot; or &quot;the first of January&quot;.)
* Tautologies like redundancy and pleonasm are common despite the emphasis on avoiding them, stressing brevity and simplicity in making sentences; they are common to many speakers, especially among the older generations. The possible explanation is that the English language teachers who came to the Philippines were taught old-fashioned grammar, thus they spread that style to the students they served.
** Examples are &quot;At this point in time&quot; and &quot;.. will be the one ...&quot; (or &quot;... will be the one who will ...&quot;) instead of &quot;now&quot; and &quot;... will ...&quot; respectively - e.g., &quot;I will be the one who will go ...&quot;, rather than &quot;I will go ...&quot;.
* Collective nouns are generally singular in construction, e.g., &quot;my family is doing well&quot; as opposed to &quot;my family are doing well&quot; or &quot;the group was walking&quot; as opposed to &quot;the group were walking&quot; following American English.
* The past tense and past participles of the verbs &quot;learn&quot;, &quot;spell&quot; and &quot;smell&quot; are often regular (&quot;learned&quot;, &quot;spelled&quot;, &quot;smelled&quot;) in Philippine English. These are also the case in American English.
* &quot;River&quot; follows the name of the river in question following American English, e.g., &quot;Pasig River&quot;, rather than the British convention of coming before the name, e.g., &quot;River Thames&quot;.
* Abbreviations such as &quot;Mr&quot; and &quot;Mrs&quot; are spelled with a final period (cf. &quot;Mr., Mrs.&quot;) following American spelling.
* While prepositions before days may be omitted in American English, e.g., &quot;She resigned Thursday&quot;, they are usually retained in Philippine English: &quot;She resigned on Thursday&quot;. However, those prepositions are usually omitted in journalistic writing.
* The institutional nouns &quot;hospital&quot; and &quot;university&quot; sometimes do not take the definite article, e.g. &quot;He&#x27;s in hospital&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s at university&quot;, while sometimes they do, e.g. &quot;He&#x27;s in the hospital&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s at the university&quot;.
* Ranges of dates use &quot;to&quot;, e.g., &quot;Monday to Friday&quot;, rather than &quot;Monday through Friday&quot;. This is shared with British English and is in contrast to American English.
* When speaking or writing out numbers, &quot;and&quot; is not inserted before the tens, i.e., &quot;five hundred sixty-nine&quot; rather than &quot;five hundred and sixty-nine&quot;. This is in contrast to British English. Additionally, the insertion of &quot;and&quot; is also common in American English.
* The preposition &quot;to&quot; in &quot;write to&quot; (e.g. &quot;I&#x27;ll write to you [something]&quot;) is always retained, as opposed to American usage where it may be dropped.
* When referring to time, Filipinos refer to 12:30 as &quot;half past twelve&quot; or, alternatively, &quot;twelve thirty&quot; and do not use the British &quot;half twelve&quot;. Similarly, &quot;(a) quarter to twelve&quot; is used for 11:45 rather than &quot;(a) quarter of twelve&quot;, which is found in American English.
* To &quot;take a shower&quot; or &quot;take a bath&quot; are the most common usages in Philippine English, following American English, whereas British English uses &quot;have a shower&quot; and &quot;have a bath&quot;. However, &quot;bathe&quot; is as often as similar to American or British usage, but not widespread.
* Directional suffix &quot;-ward(s)&quot; generally found in British English is the primary usage in Philippine English, therefore &quot;towards&quot;, &quot;afterwards&quot; and &quot;upwards&quot; over the American &quot;toward&quot;, &quot;afterward&quot; and &quot;upward&quot;. However, &quot;forward&quot; is more prevalent than the chiefly British &quot;forwards&quot;. Philippine English speakers drop the -s when using phrasal verbs such as &quot;look forward to&quot;.
* When reading decimal numerals that are usually two or three digits, each numeral is read like a whole number rather than by each digit, e.g. (0).99 is &quot;(zero) point ninety-nine&quot;, instead of &quot;(zero) point nine nine&quot; or, especially in schools, &quot;ninety-nine hundredths&quot; in both British and American English. Additionally, four-digit decimals are also treated similar to how Americans read four-digit numbers with non-zero tens and ones as pairs of two-digit numbers without saying &quot;hundred&quot; and inserting &quot;oh&quot;; 3.1416 is thus &quot;three point fourteen sixteen&quot; and not &quot;three point one four one six&quot; as pronounced.

=== Education ===
* The word &quot;course&quot; in the Philippines generally means the entire program of study, which may extend over several years and be made up of any number of &quot;modules&quot;, hence it is also practically synonymous to a degree program. This usage is due to indirect influence from Spanish &quot;curso&quot; and its borrowed forms in Philippine languages. The usage is shared with British English.
* In the Philippines, a student &quot;studies&quot; or &quot;majors in&quot; a subject (although a student&#x27;s &quot;major&quot;, &quot;concentration&quot; or, less commonly, &quot;emphasis&quot; is also used in Philippine colleges or universities to refer to the major subject of study). &quot;To major in&quot; something refers to the student&#x27;s principal course of study; &quot;to study&quot; may refer to any class being taken.
* Grade levels in the Philippines are named &quot;grade one&quot; and &quot;grade two&quot; as opposed to &quot;first grade&quot; and &quot;second grade&quot; like in Canadian English.
* Graduating classes in the Philippines are called &quot;batches&quot;. Thus, A student in the same &quot;batch&quot; is called a &quot;batchmate&quot;.
* In the Philippines, a group of students in a regularly scheduled meeting in a classroom with a teacher in a certain school year or semester or school quarter year is called a &quot;section&quot;. The teacher in charge of a specific &quot;section&quot; in a grade level where the students for each class in a certain school year or semester does not typically change per class in a system where each subject is taught by different teachers is called a &quot;class adviser&quot; or simply, an &quot;adviser&quot;.
* A school where primary and secondary students study together is called an &quot;integrated school&quot;.

=== Religion ===
* The name of a Catholic cardinal is almost always in the pattern &quot;[first name] Cardinal [last name]&quot;, for example, Juan Cardinal de la Cruz, similar to the syntax in German and Latin, unlike &quot;Cardinal [first name] [last name]&quot; in non-Philippine English.
* Catholic priests, both diocesan and those of a religious order, are titled &quot;Reverend Father&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;Rev. Fr.&quot; before their first and then last names, in contrast to practice in some other English-speaking nations. By contrast, &quot;Reverend&quot; or &quot;Rev.&quot; before a personal name is only for deacons, for example, &quot;Reverend Juan de la Cruz&quot;, unlike their counterparts in the United States. &quot;The Rev.&quot; alone before priests&#x27; names is usually found in articles sourced from non-Philippine media, like the Associated Press (AP), in Philippine newspapers.
* A pastor goes by &quot;Ptr.&quot; rather than the international &quot;Ps.&quot;

=== Monetary units ===
* Philippine English speakers often say &quot;two hundred fifty or two fifty&quot; over the British and alternatively American &quot;two hundred and fifty&quot;. In British and sometimes American English, the &quot;and&quot; comes after the hundreds (one thousand, two hundred and thirty dollars). Philippine English does not observe this.
* Philippine English speakers often say &quot;one hundred fifty&quot; instead of the American &quot;a hundred (and) fifty&quot;.
* In Philippine English, particularly in television or radio advertisements, integers can be pronounced individually in the expression of amounts. For example, &quot;on sale for ₱399&quot; might be expressed &quot;on sale for three nine nine&quot;, though the full &quot;three hundred and ninety-nine pesos&quot; is also common. Philippine English follows the American English &quot;on sale for three ninety-nine&quot;, which is understood as ₱399; In the past this may have been understood as ₱3.99, however due to inflation, ₱3.99 is no longer a common price for goods.

==Vocabulary==
==Spelling and style==
Philippine spelling usually follows American spellings, following the reforms promulgated in Noah Webster&#x27;s 1828 Dictionary.
* Words which in British English (except in Oxford spelling) end with ise, such as &quot;realise, &quot;recognise and &quot;organise are spelt with ize following American English: &quot;realize, &quot;recognize and &quot;organize (&quot;exercise&quot;, however, is universal in all varieties).
* Words which in British English are spelled with &quot;-ae-/-oe-&quot; such as oestrogen&quot; and &quot;mediaeval&quot; are spelled with e alone as in American English as estrogen&quot; and &quot;medieval&quot;. Exceptions are &quot;aesthetic&quot;, &quot;amoeba&quot; and &quot;archaeology&quot; which follow common usage in American English, but can be spelled with just an &quot;e&quot;.
* French-derived words which in British English end with our, such as &quot;colour, &quot;honour and &quot;labour, are spelled with or following American English: &quot;color, &quot;honor and &quot;labor. British -our spellings are sometimes used as an affectation.
* French-derived words which in British English end with re, such as &quot;fibre, &quot;centre and &quot;metre are usually spelled with er as in American English as &quot;fiber, &quot;center and &quot;meter. The word &quot;theater&quot; (American spelling) is also often spelled &quot;theatre&quot; (British spelling), with no preference in spelling. The British spelling &quot;centre&quot; is also used, but it is rarely used and not accepted in many settings such as schools.
* Words which in British English end with yse, such as &quot;analyse, &quot;paralyse and &quot;catalyse are spelled with yze following American English as &quot;analyze, &quot;paralyze and &quot;catalyze.
* There is no preference for words spelled with -log in American English or -logue in British English in Philippine English. Some words are usually spelled with -log, like &quot;catalog and &quot;analog, while others are typically spelled with -logue, like &quot;monologue or &quot;dialogue.
* A double-consonant l (primarily used in British and Commonwealth English) is usually retained in Philippine English when adding suffixes to words ending in l where the consonant is unstressed, contrary to common American practice. Therefore, Philippine English favors &quot;cancelled&quot; and &quot;travelling&quot; over the American &quot;canceled&quot; and &quot;traveling&quot;.
* Where British English uses a single-consonant l in the words &quot;skilful&quot;, &quot;wilful&quot;, &quot;enrol, &quot;distil, &quot;enthral, &quot;fulfil and &quot;instalment&quot;, Philippine English typically uses a double consonant following American English: &quot;skillful&quot;, &quot;willful&quot;, &quot;enroll, &quot;distill, &quot;enthrall, &quot;fulfill and &quot;installment&quot;.
* The Commonwealth English &quot;defence and &quot;offence are spelled &quot;defense and &quot;offense following American English.
* Philippine English uses &quot;practice and &quot;license for both nouns and verbs, following American English, rather than &quot;licence for the second noun and &quot;practise for the first verb as in Commonwealth English.
* Philippine English prefers spellings with silent &quot;e&quot; in some words such as &quot;acknowledgement&quot;, &quot;judgement&quot; and &quot;loveable&quot;, as opposed to &quot;acknowledgment&quot;, &quot;judgment&quot; and &quot;lovable&quot;.
* In all other cases, Philippine English prefers the American English spelling where it differs from current British spelling, as in &quot;program (in all contexts) for British English &quot;programme, and &quot;guerrilla&quot; for British English &quot;guerilla&quot;. However, &quot;programme&quot; is often used in the sense of a leaflet listing information about a play, game or other activity for distinguishment.
* Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr are mostly spelled without the hyphen and the first A is replaced with an apostrophe as Eid&#x27;l Adha and Eid&#x27;l Fitr respectively as opposed to the rest of the world. 
* The abbreviations &quot;natl&quot; and &quot;govt&quot; are often written with an apostrophe before the last letter (as nat&#x27;l and gov&#x27;t) in Philippine English.
* The elements &quot;aluminium&quot; and &quot;caesium&quot; are spelled as &quot;aluminum&quot; and &quot;cesium&quot; following American English.

===Date and time notation===
The MM/DD/YYYY and DD/MM/YYYY date format are used in the Philippines for date notation and the 12-hour clock for time notation.

===Keyboard layout===
There are two major English language keyboard layouts, the United States layout and the United Kingdom layout. Keyboards and keyboard software for the Philippine market universally use the US keyboard layout. Common special characters such as Ñ (used in proper nouns and Spanish loanwords) or the Philippine peso sign (₱, used in prices), however, are not indicated on Philippine keyboards; these are usually entered through dead keys, keyboard shortcuts or character input aids.

==Phonology==
Philippine English is a rhotic accent mainly due to the influence of Philippine languages, which are the first language of most of its speakers. Another influence is the rhotic characteristic of American English, which has been a standard in the archipelago since the language was introduced through American public education. This is contrary to the majority of Commonwealth English varieties spoken in neighboring countries such as Malaysia or Singapore. The only exception to this rule is the word &quot;&quot;, which is frequently read as &quot;Malboro&quot;. Therefore, phonemes are pronounced in all positions. However, some children of Overseas Filipinos who are educated in Commonwealth countries (such as Australia, New Zealand, or the United Kingdom) may speak in a non-rhotic accent unless taught otherwise. Native and well-educated speakers (also called acrolectal speakers) may also feature flapping and vowel sounds resembling the California vowel shift due to the influence of Hollywood movies and call center culture mostly pegged towards the American market.

For non-native speakers, Philippine English phonological features are heavily dependent on the speaker&#x27;s mother tongue, although foreign languages such as Spanish have also influenced the pronunciation of English words. This is why approximations are very common, along with hypercorrections and hyperforeignisms. The most distinguishable feature of Philippine English is a lack of fricative consonants, including , , , , , and often . Another feature is a general absence of the schwa ; it is instead pronounced by its respective equivalent full vowel, although the r-colored variant has become increasingly popular in recent years.

===Consonants===
The following consonant changes apply for many non-native speakers of the dialect:
* The rhotic consonant may vary between a trill , a flap and an approximant . The English approximant is pronounced by many speakers in the final letters of the word or before consonants, while the standard dialect prefers to pronounce the approximant in all positions of .
* The fricatives and are approximated into the stop consonants and , respectively.
* Th-stopping: The dental fricatives and become the stop consonants and , respectively. This can be also observed from speakers of Hiberno-English dialects and a number of American English speakers.
* Yod-coalescence: Like most Commonwealth English variants outside Canada and sometimes in Irish English, the , and clusters become , and respectively. This makes the words &quot;dew&quot;, &quot;tune&quot; and &quot;pharmaceutical&quot; become pronounced as , and , respectively. Yod-coalescence also occurs in some other words where other English variants either resist it or do not call for it, e.g. &quot;Calcium&quot; and &quot;celsius&quot; are respectively and . Because of these, the use of yod-coalescence is another case of approximation for aspirated consonants which Philippine languages lack in general in words such as &quot;twelve&quot; and &quot;top&quot; and the influence of the phonology of the mother tongues of many speaks of it.
* Yod-retention is usually practiced selectively, similar to the historical Irish or British and Commonwealth English, and to a lesser extent, some speakers of English in Canada, in certain words such as &quot;new(s)&quot; but not &quot;student&quot;. For that reason, &quot;maneuver&quot; is mainly pronounced also with the yod, in a somewhat hyperforeign manner, whereas all other accents drop it intrinsically. The yod is also retained in &quot;figure(d/s)&quot;, thus not rhyming with &quot;bigger&quot;. However, yod-dropping is often common due to the influence of modern General American. The yod is also dropped in many words with an unstressed U, e.g. &quot;(ir)regular&quot; and &quot;municipal(ity)&quot;. It, as retained in many words, is sometimes coalesced. More at &quot;Yod-coalescence&quot; above.
* The fricative may be devoiced into in words such as &quot;measure&quot;. Alternatively, it can be affricated into in words such as &quot;beige&quot;.
* The phoneme is devoiced into an . This also includes intervocalic and the in examples such as &quot;dissolve&quot;, &quot;possess&quot; and their derivatives, &quot;brassiere&quot;, &quot;dessert&quot;, &quot;dissolution&quot;, &quot;Missouri(an)&quot;, &quot;possession&quot; and &quot;scissors&quot;, which are usually pronounced as a in most other accents of English. However, &quot;Aussie&quot; is usually pronounced with as in the United States.
* Older speakers tend to add an &quot;i&quot; or &quot;e&quot; sound before the syllable-initial clusters &quot;sl-&quot;, &quot;sm-&quot;, &quot;sn-&quot;, &quot;sp-&quot; and &quot;st-&quot; due to Spanish influence, so the words &quot;star&quot; and &quot;lipstick&quot; sounds like &quot;(i/e)star&quot; and &quot;lip(i/e)stick&quot; respectively.
* Like most non-native speakers of English elsewhere, the &quot;dark &quot;l&quot;&quot; () is merged into the usual &quot;light&quot; equivalent.
* The compound is pronounced as a palatal lateral approximant in between vowels (e.g. &quot;gorilla&quot;), especially to those who were exposed to Spanish orthography. This is negligible among younger well-educated speakers.
* The letter &quot;z&quot; is usually pronounced (and sometimes spelled) as &quot;zey&quot; like in Jamaican English. However, in standard Philippine English, it is pronounced and spelled as the American &quot;zee&quot; .

===Vowels===
Vowels in Philippine English are pronounced according to the letter representing each, so that are generally pronounced as , respectively. The schwa —although a phonological feature across numerous Philippine languages such as Karay-a, Maranao, Kapampangan, or the &quot;Abagatan&quot; (Southern) dialect of Ilocano—is absent as a separate phoneme.
* The following are the various approximations of the schwa:
** Words that end in &quot;-le&quot; that succeeds a consonant (such as &quot;Google&quot; and &quot;castle&quot;) are generally pronounced with an , except for words that end &quot;-ple&quot;, &quot;-fle&quot; or &quot;-ble&quot; (&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;waffle&quot; and &quot;humble&quot;), which are pronounced with an .
** The in words such as &quot;knowledge&quot; or &quot;college&quot;, it is pronounced as a diphthong , making it rhyme with &quot;age&quot;, &quot;cage&quot;, &quot;rage&quot;, &quot;page&quot;, and &quot;beige&quot;.
** The rhotic vowels and may be pronounced as an (command&quot;er&quot;), (c&quot;ir&quot;cle) or an (doct&quot;or&quot;), usually by non-native speakers outside urban areas or the elderly.
* The pronunciations are pronounced as central vowels and . In the standard dialect, the open front vowel may be pronounced as an allophone of .
** For the above reason, words subject to the trap–bath split, e.g. &quot;basket(ball)&quot;, &quot;bath&quot;, &quot;example&quot;, &quot;laugh&quot;, &quot;master&quot; and &quot;sample&quot; can be pronounced with but often not for e.g. &quot;answer(able)&quot;, &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;chance&quot; and &quot;France&quot;. Also, the &quot;mary–marry–merry&quot; merger is partial; &quot;Harry&quot; and &quot;hairy&quot; are distinct but sometimes not &quot;carry&quot; and &quot;Kerry&quot;.
** The first in some words such as &quot;patronage&quot;, &quot;patriot(ic/ism)&quot;, &quot;(ex/re)patriate(d/s)&quot; and &quot;(ex/re)patriation&quot; usually have the sound of either , like in British/non-Canadian Commonwealth or Irish English, or sometimes , rather than in the United States and Canada. Moreover, the in the unstressed &quot;-ative&quot; suffix is reduced to either the schwa or , becoming as in Britain and Ireland, for words stressed on the second syllable such as &quot;administrative&quot;, &quot;investigative&quot;, &quot;qualitative&quot;, sometimes &quot;innovative&quot;, and usually &quot;legislative&quot;. &quot;Administrative&quot; is also erroneously stressed on the third syllable. This does not apply to &quot;negative&quot;, &quot;alternative&quot; or &quot;initiative&quot;. as the unstressed &quot;a-&quot; prefix, called alpha privative, is also the schwa or before stems that begin with consonants, e.g. &quot;apolitical&quot;, &quot;asymmetric&quot; or &quot;asymmetry&quot;, &quot;asymptomatic&quot;, &quot;atypical&quot;, etc.
* The phoneme may be merged or replaced by the longer for some speakers. The words &quot;peel&quot; and &quot;pill&quot; might sound the same.
* The may be enunciated as an (&quot;color&quot; or even &quot;tomorrow&quot;, &quot;sorry&quot;, &quot;sorrow&quot;, etc. like in Canada) or an (&quot;not&quot;).
* The &quot;u&quot; sound from the digraph &quot;qu&quot; may be dropped before &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot; in some words such as &quot;tranquilize(r)&quot; and &quot;colloquial&quot; likely due to Spanish influence.
* The in namely &quot;couple&quot; and &quot;double&quot; may also be enunciated as an or, rarely, as an .
* The in namely &quot;culture&quot; and &quot;ultimate&quot; is sometimes enunciated as an , partly similar to accents in the United Kingdom (except Scotland) without the &quot;foot–strut&quot; split.

===Emphasis===
* Distinct non-native emphasis or stress is common. For example, the words &quot;ceremony&quot; and &quot;Arabic&quot; are emphasized on the second syllable (as and respectively) as another result of indirect Spanish influence. Additionally, words ending in -ary such as &quot;beneficiary&quot;, &quot;complementary&quot;, &quot;elementary&quot;, &quot;judiciary&quot; and &quot;supplementary&quot; are treated as paroxytones or stressed on the /a/, rather than as proparoxytones or the preceding syllable, a hyperforeignism from the Spanish-derived &quot;-aria&quot;/&quot;-arya&quot; and &quot;-ario&quot;/&quot;-aryo&quot;.

===Pronunciation===
Many Filipinos often have distinct non-native English pronunciation, and many fall under different &quot;lectal&quot; variations (i.e. basilectal, mesolectal, acrolectal). Some Philippine languages (e.g. Ibanag, Itawis, Surigaonon, Tausug) feature certain unique phonemes such as , , , and , which are also present in English. However, Filipinos&#x27; first languages (such as Tagalog) have generally different phonological repertoires (if not more simplified compared to English), and this leads to mis- or distinct pronunciations particularly among basilectal and to some extent mesolectal speakers.

<text>John Cho (born Cho Yo-Han; June 16, 1972) is an American actor known for his roles as Harold Lee in the &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar&quot; films, and Hikaru Sulu in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; rebooted film series, &quot;Better Luck Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Columbus&quot;, and &quot;Searching&quot;, which made him the first Asian American actor in history to headline a mainstream thriller film in Hollywood. He was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead for his performance in &quot;Searching&quot;.

He also made history in American television in the 21st century as the first Asian American actor cast as a romantic lead in a romantic comedy series when he starred as Henry Higgs in the 2014 sitcom &quot;Selfie&quot;. In addition to his role in &quot;Selfie&quot;, Cho has had lead roles in series such as &quot;FlashForward&quot;, &quot;Off Centre&quot;, and &quot;The Afterparty&quot;, and recurring roles in &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; and &quot;Difficult People&quot;. In his early career, Cho attained recognition for his guest starring role in the fantasy television series &quot;Charmed&quot;.

== Early life ==
Born in Seoul, South Korea, Cho moved to the United States when he was 6 years old in 1978. He was raised in Los Angeles, where his family settled after living in Houston, Seattle, Daly City, California, and Monterey Park, California. His father was a minister in the Church of Christ and was originally from North Korea. He grew up with one younger brother. At the time, his father believed in order to survive and assimilate in the U.S., Cho and his brother would need to stop speaking Korean and speak English instead. They would also watch American television as much as they could to absorb the new culture. Cho graduated from Herbert Hoover High School in Glendale, California, in 1990.

Cho attended the University of California, Berkeley. In 1994, he toured nationally for a stage production of Maxine Hong Kingston&#x27;s &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot; by the Berkeley Repertory Theatre. He graduated in 1996 with a Bachelor of Arts in English literature.

== Career ==
=== Acting ===
After graduation, Cho taught English literature at Pacific Hills School in West Hollywood, California, while acting at East West Players in downtown Los Angeles. There, he appeared in Edward Sakamoto&#x27;s &quot;The Taste of Kona Coffee&quot; in 1996 and in Euijoon Kim&#x27;s film &quot;My Tired Broke Ass Pontificating Slapstick Funk&quot; in 2000.

Cho gained attention with a small role as &quot;MILF guy #2&quot; in the 1999 comedy &quot;American Pie&quot;, in which he popularized the slang term MILF. Cho reprised the role in three sequels: &quot;American Pie 2&quot;, &quot;American Wedding&quot;, and the latest installment &quot;American Reunion&quot; in which he has a much larger role. His character initially had no name, but he was given the name &quot;John&quot; in the third film, named after Cho himself.

Cho guest-starred on &quot;Charmed&quot; as the ghost of Mark Chao, one of leading character Piper Halliwell&#x27;s most prominent love interests, in the episode &quot;Dead Man Dating&quot; in 1998; he indicated in 2024 that it was a role that he &quot;gets asked about... all the time&quot;. He was one of the stars of the short-lived situation comedy &quot;Off Centre&quot; from 2001 to 2002; his character, Chau Presley, became the series&#x27; breakout character.

He was a costar on the Fox sitcom &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot;, based on Anthony Bourdain&#x27;s best-selling book. He had supporting roles in the science fiction comedy &quot;Evolution&quot;, directed by Ivan Reitman; &quot;Down to Earth&quot;; and &quot;Bowfinger&quot;.

In 2002, Cho had a starring role in the ensemble cast of Justin Lin&#x27;s &quot;Better Luck Tomorrow&quot;, a drama focusing on the travails of a group of Asian Americans living in Southern California who are academically successful but socially discontented, and as a result engage in wantonly violent, criminal behavior. It was well received by critics, with Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; describing Cho&#x27;s character&#x27;s &quot;lazy magnetism of which he is charmingly aware&quot;. Later that year, the movie &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot; was released, in which Cho played a Hong Kong-based film director. He refused to do the accent scripted for his character. The director worked with him to re-develop the role.

Cho had a successful starring role as Harold Lee in 2004&#x27;s &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle&quot; and reprised the role in 2008&#x27;s &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay&quot; which earned $38million at the box office, and again in 2011&#x27;s &quot;A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas&quot; which made $35million. Cho&#x27;s role in the popular franchise was written specifically for him by Hayden Schlossberg, and Cho has recounted that when Schlossberg first approached him with the role, he was initially suspicious.

Cho appeared in the July 2004 issue of &quot;KoreAm Journal&quot; and, in September 2006, was cast in NBC&#x27;s new comedy &quot;The Singles Table&quot;, but the series never aired due to changes in scheduling and production. In 2006 and again in 2009, Cho was selected as one of the sexiest men alive in &quot;People&quot; magazine.
In 2007, Cho was added to the cast of &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; as a recurring character. Cho plays Kenny, a best friend of accountant Henry Grubstick. Cho played helmsman Hikaru Sulu in J. J. Abrams&#x27;s feature film &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised him for making his role &quot;ultimately and rather wonderfully [his] own&quot;.

Cho appeared in Nas&#x27;s &quot;Be a Nigger Too&quot; music video along with various celebrities and had a guest appearance on the sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, in the episode &quot;I&#x27;m Not That Guy&quot; where he played a partner in an evil law firm. Of the latter, Staci Krause of IGN, wrote that Cho was &quot;the scene stealer in this episode&quot; and that she would &quot;definitely like to see more of him&quot; in the series.

From 2009 to 2010, Cho starred in the television series &quot;FlashForward&quot; as FBI Special Agent Demetri Noh. His character was originally slated to be killed off during what turned out to be the show&#x27;s only season, but after his turn as Sulu in &quot;Star Trek&quot; boosted his popularity, the producers revised the show&#x27;s storyline so that he survived, in an attempt to boost declining ratings.

In 2012, he was part of the cast ensemble of &quot;Go On&quot; as Steven.

Cho starred as Henry Higgs in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Selfie&quot;, a retooling of the play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; by George Bernard Shaw, becoming the first Asian American man to play a romantic lead on a U.S. romantic comedy television series in 2014. At the time, Keli Lee was the executive vice president of Talent and Casting at ABC who selected Cho as a candidate and also previously cast Cho in &quot;Flashforward&quot;. Julie Anne Robinson, one of the directors and executive producers of &quot;Selfie&quot;, revealed in 2021 interviews that she strongly supported casting Cho and had to persuade &quot;top to bottom of everybody in that chain&quot; that he was the perfect choice for the role, which took considerable time. Robinson fought for Cho and won, saying, &quot;That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m most proud of about that whole pilot.&quot; The show continued to have a dedicated fan following after its broadcast. In July 2022, when Cho was asked about his thoughts on the show&#x27;s cancellation, he answered, &quot;I&#x27;m still stunned to see how many people still love that series. And yeah, I was bummed when it got canceled. I just thought that was a good show.&quot; In January 2023, Cho mentioned he had not received many offers for romantic comedy roles since &quot;Selfie&quot;.

In 2016, he was a series regular for the television show as Andy Kim in the second season of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; television series. In 2017, he starred in the film &quot;Columbus&quot;, which received critical acclaim. In 2018, Cho starred in the film &quot;Searching&quot;, playing a man combing social media for clues to his daughter&#x27;s disappearance. He was the first Asian American actor to headline a mainstream thriller in Hollywood. Also in 2018, he was presented with the Spotlight Award at the San Diego International Film Festival.

In April 2019, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Cho had been cast as Spike Spiegel in a live-action version of the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; series. However, production shut down when Cho suffered a knee injury in October and remained shut down until late September 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; premiered on Netflix on November 19, 2021.

Cho wrote a middle school novel for younger readers called &quot;Troublemaker&quot;, which was released on March 22, 2022. Also in 2022, Cho was cast in the second season of Apple TV+&#x27;s comedy series &quot;The Afterparty&quot; as &quot;Funcle&quot; Ulysses Zhu. The new season premiered in July 2023.

In May 2024, he had a cameo in the television adaptation of &quot;The Sympathizer&quot;. In early August 2024, Cho voiced in the audiobook version of the romantic comedy book, &quot;Drop Dead&quot;, written by Lily Chu. Cho starred in a sci-fi horror film, &quot;Afraid&quot;, released on August 30, 2024. He will make his Korean drama debut in &quot;Tempest&quot;, which will be released on Disney+ and Hulu in 2025.

In February 2025, Cho was cast in the second season in &quot;Poker Face&quot;.
===Music===
Cho is the lead singer for Viva La Union (formerly known as Left of Zed), a Los Angeles garage rock band composed of former Berkeley and USC students. They have one album, self-titled, while their song &quot;Chinese Baby&quot; is on the &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay&quot; soundtrack.

==Personal life==
Cho married actress Kerri Higuchi in 2006. They met at UC Berkeley and later dated when they moved to Los Angeles. They have a son, born in 2008, and a daughter, born in 2013. As of 2015, he and his family reside in Los Angeles, California. He is close to his father, a former preacher, and would like to play a role in the story of his father&#x27;s generation, growing up in North Korea through the Korean War.

Cho has indicated he has found freedom in being Harold in the &quot;Harold and Kumar&quot; films because the stoner character goes against the grain of Asian Americans onscreen. He has said he has experienced racism throughout his career in Hollywood and that he tries to take roles that do not perpetuate Asian stereotypes. When asked to do an Asian accent for &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot;, Cho refused. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to do this role in a kid&#x27;s comedy, with an accent, because I don&#x27;t want young people laughing at an accent inadvertently&quot;, he wrote. In a 2015 tweet he said, &quot;Stop turning Asian roles white. It&#x27;s bullshit and we all know it.&quot; On being the first Asian to play a romantic lead on a U.S. romantic comedy television series, he described his casting in &quot;Selfie&quot; as being &quot;revolutionary&quot; and a &quot;personal revolution&quot; for him because of its uniqueness in Hollywood. &quot;Asians narratively in shows are insignificant. They&#x27;re the cop, or waitress, or whatever it is. You see them in the background. So to be in this position ... is bit of a landmark&quot;, he has said on the inability of Asians getting offered such roles.

In 2016, Cho was the face of the &quot;#StarringJohnCho&quot; social movement and hashtag campaign, created by William Yu, wherein Cho is Photoshopped onto existing movie posters as the male lead. The purpose of the project was to call attention to the lack of opportunities for Asian American actors in Hollywood.

Cho supported the 2012 re-election campaign of Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama. He supported the Democratic nominee Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Cho also supported the 2024 election campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.

<text>María Elena Holly (née Santiago; born December 20, 1932) is the widow of American rock and roll pioneer Buddy Holly. As a receptionist at Peermusic, she met with Holly and his band the Crickets on June 19, 1958, and Holly proposed to her after five hours on their first date. Less than two months later, the couple married on August 15, 1958, in Lubbock, Texas. On February 3, 1959, Buddy Holly died in a plane crash along with fellow musicians Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper outside Clear Lake, Iowa. After learning of her husband&#x27;s death from the television news, she suffered a miscarriage the following day and could not attend Holly&#x27;s funeral in Lubbock.

In the following years, María Elena Holly married Puerto Rican government official Joe Diaz, with whom she had three children. In the 1978 film &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot;, she is portrayed by actress Maria Richwine. As Buddy Holly&#x27;s widow, she owns the rights to his name, image, trademarks, and other intellectual property. In 2010, Santiago-Holly co-founded The Buddy Holly Educational Foundation with Peter Bradley.

==Early life==
María Elena Santiago was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her mother died when she was 6 years old, and in 1953, her father sent her to live with her aunt (Provi Garcia) in New York City. Santiago worked as a receptionist for music publisher Peermusic.

==Marriage to Buddy Holly==
As a receptionist at Peermusic, Maria Elena is believed to have met musician Buddy Holly in August 1957 when as rising stars he and the Crickets first visited Peer Southern Music in the Brill Building at 1619 Broadway to meet their publishing manager Murray Deutch, who was Maria&#x27;s boss. On June 19, 1958, just before recording a cover of the Bobby Darin song &quot;Early in the Morning&quot; in New York&#x27;s Pythian Temple, Holly asked her out on a date. Santiago had never been out on a date and told Holly he would have to ask her aunt for permission, which he received promptly. Five hours into their first date, Buddy handed a rose to Maria and asked her to marry him.

On August 15, 1958, less than two months after their first date, she married Holly at Tabernacle Baptist Church in his hometown of Lubbock, Texas. They settled down in Lubbock until Buddy broke up with the Crickets, and they moved to New York. Santiago-Holly went on one tour (October 1958) with her husband and took on promotional duties. Buddy Holly also formed the Maria Music publishing company with which &quot;Stay Close to Me&quot; was filed. Holly produced Lou Giordano&#x27;s version of the song, which was issued on Brunswick 55115 on January 27, 1959.

According to Santiago, before she agreed to marry Holly, she insisted he resolve the issues he was having with his manager and producer, Norman Petty, who was in control of the Crickets&#x27; finances and allegedly withholding royalty payments. Santiago told Holly: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to sit around all the time, waiting for handouts from Norman Petty.&quot; Eventually, the two of them &quot;visited Petty at the studio to end their partnership, and seek his unpaid royalties.&quot; Santiago &quot;recounted that Petty told his young protege, &quot;You know what, Buddy? I&#x27;m gonna say this to you. I&#x27;d rather see you dead than to give you the money now.&quot; Santiago also claimed that Petty &quot;tried to break us up [...] He told Buddy not to marry me because I was a whoreish kind of woman, that I&#x27;d slept with all kinds of other men who&#x27;d come in to Peer-Southern. Buddy knew that wasn&#x27;t true, of course. He got so mad, he wanted to leave Norman right there and then.&quot; According to Petty&#x27;s recollection of the meeting, &quot;Elena did all the talking. She said, &#x27;Buddy and I have decided that Buddy can do better — that you&#x27;re not fit for Buddy&#x27;s manager.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;What&#x27;s this — is it something I&#x27;ve done?&#x27; She said, &#x27;It&#x27;s what you haven&#x27;t done — you haven&#x27;t done near enough for him.&#x27;&quot;

In the early morning hours of February 3, 1959, Buddy Holly was on tour when he and fellow musicians Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper died in an airplane crash along with pilot Roger Peterson outside Clear Lake, Iowa. At the time, Holly and Santiago had been married for only five months, and she learned of his death from the reports on television. As a result of psychological trauma from the incident, Santiago miscarried with her husband&#x27;s child on February 4. Her husband was interred in Lubbock.

Santiago-Holly did not attend the funeral and has never visited the grave site. In a February 7, 1959, interview with the &quot;Lubbock Avalanche-Journal&quot;, she said, &quot;In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour. It was the only time I wasn&#x27;t with him. And I blame myself because I know that, if only I had gone along, Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane.&quot;

Following the miscarriage suffered by Santiago-Holly and the circumstances in which she was informed of his death, a policy was later adopted by authorities not to disclose victims&#x27; names until after their families have been informed.

==Later years==
Santiago-Holly later married Joe Diaz, a Puerto Rican government official. Together, they had three children. Now divorced, she is a grandmother living in Dallas, Texas, and promotes her first husband&#x27;s legacy. In 1989, The Smithereens paid honor to her with the song &quot;Maria Elena&quot; on their album &quot;11&quot;. Actress Maria Richwine played Santiago-Holly&#x27;s role in the 1978 movie &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot;. Jill Hennessy portrayed her in the Broadway production of &quot;&quot;.

In 1999, Santiago-Holly, along with Holly&#x27;s siblings, filed a lawsuit against MCA, contending that the company was &quot;defrauding them of royalties by using void contracts and forged signatures&quot;, had &quot;grossly underpaid the fair market value of royalties&quot; and had &quot;stolen certain recordings and sold them.&quot; Santiago-Holly had raised concerns in the 1970s and 1980s &quot;because the amount paid to her appeared &quot;so miniscule&quot; in comparison to what the market indicated they should be. However, she did not investigate based on her suspicions because she did not have the money to pursue the matter&quot;, and claimed that she &quot;was ignored and stonewalled&quot;. The suit also named Joe B. Mauldin and Jerry Allison, Holly&#x27;s fellow bandmates in the Crickets, and accused them &quot;of unjustified claims to royalty rights for recording sessions they didn&#x27;t take part in&quot;, Norman Petty was alleged to have &quot;conspired with MCA to defraud the Holly heirs.&quot; On 11 April 2007, &quot;the parties came to an agreement regarding the amount of royalties due&quot;, with the court declaring that &quot;MCA owed the Petty estate and the Holly heirs a combined $251,325 in additional royalties&quot;.

In 2008, Santiago-Holly threatened legal action against Peggy Sue Gerron, the subject of the song &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;, after the publication of Gerron&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Whatever Happened to Peggy Sue?&quot;

While visiting New York City in May 2008, Santiago-Holly visited Washington Square Park, where Holly often played his guitar. She observed musicians singing there, and later told the &quot;Avalanche-Journal&quot;: &quot;I gave one musician $9 because 9 was Buddy&#x27;s favorite number.&quot; She also visited the apartment building where she and Holly had lived. Santiago-Holly remarked it was the first time she had been back to the building since Holly&#x27;s death.

===The Buddy Holly Educational Foundation===
In 2010, Santiago-Holly co-founded, with Peter Bradley, the Buddy Holly Educational Foundation. The foundation is a charitable corporation whose mission is to keep Buddy Holly&#x27;s legacy alive by providing musical education to new generations regardless of income, ethnicity or educational limitations. Among the areas in the musical education provided are songwriting, production, arranging, orchestration and performance education. The Buddy Holly Educational Foundation co-hosts worldwide songwriting retreats with Chris Difford. They are organized by Peter Bradley Jr, board Director of the Buddy Holly Educational Foundation.

<doc id="879006" wikidata="Q6878292" url="?curid=879006" title="Missile to the Moon">
<text>Missile to the Moon is a 1958 independently made American black-and-white science fiction film drama, produced by Marc Frederic, directed by Richard E. Cunha, that stars Richard Travis, Cathy Downs, and K. T. Stevens. The film was distributed by Astor Pictures and is a remake of an earlier Astor Pictures-distributed film, &quot;Cat-Women of the Moon&quot; (1953). &quot;Missile to the Moon&quot; was released in late 1958 as a double feature with Cunha&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

A spaceship blasts off from Earth with five aboard, but one of them is secretly a Moon man returning home. He dies by accident during the trip to Luna. What the remaining four find waiting for them when they arrive on the Moon is well beyond their expectations: huge rock creatures, giant lunar spiders, and a cave-dwelling civilization made up of beautiful women. 
==Plot==
Two escaped convicts, Gary and Lon, are discovered hiding aboard a rocket by scientist Dirk Green, who then forces them to pilot the spaceship to the Moon. Dirk, who is secretly a Moon man, wants to return home.

Dirk&#x27;s partner Steve Dayton and Steve&#x27;s fiancée June are accidentally trapped aboard just before the rocketship blasts off from Earth.

Moon man Dirk is later accidentally killed in a meteor storm during the lunar trip. Once they land on the Moon, the spaceship&#x27;s reluctant crew encounter deception and intrigue when they discover an underground kingdom made up of beautiful women and their sinister female ruler, the Lido.

While on the Moon, the Earthers encounter surface-dwelling, slow-moving, bipedal large rock creatures that try to crush them. They must also contend with a cave-dwelling, not-so-giant spider that attacks them.

==Cast==
* Richard Travis as Steve Dayton
* Cathy Downs as June Saxton 
* K. T. Stevens as the Lido

==Production==
&quot;Missile to the Moon&quot; was an even lower-budget remake of the low-budget science fiction film drama &quot;Cat-Women of the Moon&quot; (1953) and closely follows the plot details of that earlier feature. That film offered 3D as its big attraction, but all its male characters were middle-aged. The 1958 remake opted to better appeal to a teenage audience by adding a pair of youthful escaped convicts, one a good kid who had made a mistake, the other an incorrigible crook, and providing them with lunar love interests in due course. In the 1953 film, the bit players portraying the minor Moon maidens are described as &quot;Hollywood cover girls&quot;; in the remake, they are credited as &quot;international beauty contest winners&quot;.

A red camera filter was used to make the blue sky photograph very dark on the black-and-white film, but the result was still far from the ideal starry black. Bits of scrubby vegetation could be seen in the background of some shots. No attempt is made to convince the viewer that the Moon is an airless void where humans would weigh one-sixth their normal Earth weight. When one of the space-suited astronauts is forced into direct sunlight, unshielded from its intensity, he bursts into flames, despite the lack of an external oxygen atmosphere; in seconds he is reduced to a skeleton.

The large, slow-moving rock creatures have a passing resemblance to the shape of Gumby, the popular stop motion clay animation children&#x27;s television character introduced in 1955.

The giant spider prop was wire-controlled from above; it is exactly the same &quot;Moon spider&quot; used five years earlier in &quot;Cat-Women of the Moon&quot;.

Nina Bara, in the role of the evil, scheming, back-stabbing Alpha, was familiar to genre audiences from her role as Tonga on the television series &quot;Space Patrol&quot; (1950-1955). Popular 1960s/1970s television and film star Leslie Parrish also co-stars, billed under her real name Marjorie Hellen.

==Reception and legacy==
The film is regarded as a drive-in camp classic. Film historians Kim R. Holston and Tom Winchester noted that the film was &quot;... (a) low-budget, scientifically inaccurate hoot ...&quot; Film reviewer Glenn Erickson commented on DVD Talk that the film &quot;is nobody&#x27;s idea of a good movie ... a hoot, a real knee-slapper,&quot; but added &quot;how can the worst space movie ever made, &quot;be&quot; the worst space movie ever made, if it&#x27;s such a delight?&quot; Writing in AllMovie, critic Paula Gaita described the film as &quot;woefully cheap and naïve,&quot; but noted that it &quot;offers a wealth of juvenile delights, with its improbable monsters, wonky science, and serial-style hidden civilization.&quot; A review of the film in &quot;TV Guide&quot; described it as &quot;a third-rate science fiction picture&quot; that is &quot;bad enough for a laugh.&quot;

The film was twice spoofed on RiffTrax (first by Michael J. Nelson of &quot;Mystery Science Theater&quot; and Fred Willard, then by Nelson, Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy who were also &quot;MST3K&quot; alumni).

<doc id="879009" wikidata="Q3331891" url="?curid=879009" title="Mythopoeia">
<text>Mythopoeia (), or mythopoesis, is a subgenre of speculative fiction, and a theme in modern literature and film, where an artificial or fictionalized mythology is created by the writer of prose, poetry, or other literary forms. The concept was widely popularised by J. R. R. Tolkien in the 1930s, although it long predated him. The authors in this genre integrate traditional mythological themes and archetypes into fiction. Mythopoeia is also the act of creating a mythology.

== Genre ==

The term &quot;mythopoeia&quot; comes from Hellenistic Greek (), meaning &#x27;myth-making&#x27;; an alternative is &quot;mythopoesis&quot; () of similar meaning. The definition of &quot;mythopoeia&quot; as &quot;a creating of myth&quot; is first recorded from 1846. In early use, it meant the making of myths in ancient times. 

While many literary works carry mythic themes, only a few approach the dense self-referentiality and purpose of mythopoesis. Mythopoeic authors include William Blake, H. P. Lovecraft, Lord Dunsany, J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Mervyn Peake, and Robert E. Howard.
Tolkien used the word as the title of one of his poems, written in 1931 and published in &quot;Tree and Leaf&quot;.

Works of mythopoeia are often categorized as fantasy or science fiction but fill a niche for mythology in the modern world, according to Joseph Campbell, a famous student of world mythology. Campbell spoke of a Nietzschean world which has today outlived much of the mythology of the past. He claimed that new myths must be created, but he believed that present culture is changing too rapidly for society to be completely described by any such mythological framework until a later age.

The philosopher Phillip Stambovsky argues that mythopoeia provides relief from the existential dread that comes with a rational world, and that it can serve as a way to link different cultures and societies.

Mythopoeia is sometimes called &quot;artificial mythology&quot;, which emphasizes that it did not evolve naturally and is an artifice comparable with artificial language, and therefore should not be taken seriously as mythology. For example, the noted folklorist Alan Dundes argued that &quot;any novel cannot meet the cultural criteria of myth. A work of art, or artifice, cannot be said to be the narrative of a culture&#x27;s sacred tradition...[it is] at most, artificial myth.&quot;

== In literature ==

=== Antecedents ===

William Blake set out his mythology in his &quot;prophetic works&quot; such as &quot;Vala, or The Four Zoas&quot;. These name several original gods, such as Urizen, Orc, Los, Albion, Rintrah, Ahania and Enitharmon. 
Later in the 19th century, stories by George MacDonald and H. Rider Haggard created fictional worlds; C. S. Lewis praised both for their &quot;mythopoeic&quot; gifts.

Lord Dunsany&#x27;s 1905 book of short stories, &quot;The Gods of Pegana&quot;, is linked by Dunsany&#x27;s invented pantheon of deities who dwell in Pegāna. It was followed by &quot;Time and the Gods&quot;, by some stories in &quot;The Sword of Welleran and Other Stories&quot;, and by &quot;Tales of Three Hemispheres&quot;. In 1919, Dunsany told an American interviewer, &quot;In &quot;The Gods of Pegana&quot; I tried to account for the ocean and the moon. I don&#x27;t know whether anyone else has ever tried that before.&quot; Dunsany&#x27;s work influenced J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s later writings.

T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (1922) was a deliberate attempt to model a 20th-century mythology patterned after the birth-rebirth motif described by the anthropologist and folklorist James George Frazer.

===J. R. R. Tolkien===


J. R. R. Tolkien wrote a poem titled &quot;Mythopoeia&quot; following a discussion on the night of 19 September 1931 at Magdalen College, Oxford with C. S. Lewis and Hugo Dyson, in which he intended to explain and defend creative myth-making. The poem describes the creative human author as &quot;the little maker&quot; wielding his &quot;own small golden sceptre&quot; and ruling his &quot;subcreation&quot; (understood as a creation of Man within God&#x27;s primary creation).
Tolkien&#x27;s wider legendarium includes not only origin myths, creation myths, and an epic poetry cycle, but also fictive linguistics, geology and geography. He more succinctly explores the function of such myth-making, &quot;subcreation&quot; and &quot;Faery&quot; in the short story &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; (1945)&quot;,&quot; the novella &quot;Smith of Wootton Major&quot; (1967), and the essays &quot;&quot; (1936) and &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot; (1939). Written in 1939 for presentation by Tolkien at the Andrew Lang lecture at the University of St Andrews and published in print in 1947, &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot; explains &quot;Faery&quot; as both a fictitious realm and an archetypal plane in the psyche or soul from whence Man derives his &quot;subcreative&quot; capacity. Tolkien emphasizes the importance of language in the act of channeling &quot;subcreation&quot;, speaking of the human linguistic faculty in general as well as the specifics of the language used in a given tradition, particularly in the form of story and song:

Tolkien scholars have likened his views on the creation of myth to the Christian concept of Logos or &quot;The Word&quot;, which is said to act as both &quot;the [...] language of nature&quot; spoken into being by God, and &quot;a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite I AM&quot;.

Verlyn Flieger wrote that Elias Lönnrot intentionally created the &quot;Kalevala&quot; as a mythology for Finland, giving it &quot;a world of magic and mystery, a heroic age of story that may never have existed in precisely the form he gave it, but nevertheless fired Finland with a sense of its own independent worth.&quot; In her view, Tolkien, who had read the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, &quot;envisioned himself&quot; doing exactly the same thing, except that the mythology would be entirely fictive. Lönnrot had travelled the backwoods of Finland for 20 years, collecting stories and songs &quot;from unlettered peasants&quot;. Tolkien meant to invent both the collectors and the storytellers, in his case Elves: &quot;he would be at once the singer and the compiler, the performer and the audience.&quot;

=== C. S. Lewis ===

At the time that Tolkien debated the usefulness of myth and mythopoeia with C. S. Lewis in 1931, Lewis was a theist and liked but was skeptical of mythology, taking the position that myths were &quot;lies and therefore worthless, even though &#x27;breathed through silver. However Lewis later began to speak of Christianity as the one &quot;true myth&quot;. Lewis wrote, &quot;The story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened.&quot; Subsequently, his &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; is regarded as mythopoeia, with storylines referencing that Christian mythology, namely the narrative of a great king who is sacrificed to save his people and is resurrected. Lewis&#x27;s mythopoeic intent is often confused with allegory, where the characters and world of Narnia would stand in direct equivalence with concepts and events from Christian theology and history, but Lewis repeatedly emphasized that an allegorical reading misses the point (the mythopoeia) of the Narnia stories. He shares this skepticism toward allegory with Tolkien, who disliked &quot;conscious and intentional&quot; allegory as it stood in opposition the broad and &quot;inevitable&quot; allegory of themes like &quot;Fall&quot; and &quot;Mortality&quot;.

=== Superheroes of comic books ===

In &quot;The Mythos of the Superheroes and the Mythos of the Saints&quot;, Thomas Roberts observes that:

The 1938-debuting Superman, for example, sent from the &quot;heavens&quot; by his father to save humanity, is a messiah-type of character in the Biblical tradition. Furthermore, along with the rest of DC Comic&#x27;s Justice League of America, Superman watches over humanity from the Watchtower in the skies; just as the Greek gods do from Mount Olympus.

== In film ==

Frank McConnell, author of &quot;Storytelling and Mythmaking&quot; and professor of English at the University of California, called film another &quot;mythmaking&quot; art, stating: &quot;Film and literature matter as much as they do because they are versions of mythmaking.&quot; In his view, film is a perfect vehicle for mythmaking: &quot;FILM...strives toward the fulfillment of its own projected reality in an ideally associative, personal world.&quot; In a broad analysis, McConnell associates the American western movies and romance movies with the Arthurian mythology, adventure and action movies with the &quot;epic world&quot; mythologies of founding societies, and many romance movies where the hero is allegorically playing the role of a knight, with &quot;quest&quot; mythologies like &quot;Sir Gawain&quot; and the &quot;Quest for the Holy Grail&quot;.

=== &quot;Star Wars&quot; ===

Filmmaker George Lucas speaks of the cinematic storyline of &quot;Star Wars&quot; as an example of modern myth-making. In 1999 he told Bill Moyers, &quot;With &quot;Star Wars&quot; I consciously set about to re-create myths and the classic mythological motifs.&quot; McConnell writes that &quot;it has passed, quicker than anyone could have imagined, from the status of film to that of legitimate and deeply embedded popular mythology.&quot; John Lyden, the Professor and Chair of the Religion Department at Dana College, argues that &quot;Star Wars&quot; does indeed reproduce religious and mythical themes; specifically, he argues that the work is apocalyptic in concept and scope. Steven D. Greydanus of &quot;The Decent Film Guide&quot; agrees, calling &quot;Star Wars&quot; a &quot;work of epic mythopoeia.&quot; In fact, Greydanus argues that &quot;Star Wars&quot; is &quot;the&quot; primary example of American mythopoeia:

Roger Ebert has observed of &quot;Star Wars&quot; that &quot;It is not by accident that George Lucas worked with Joseph Campbell, an expert on the world&#x27;s basic myths, in fashioning a screenplay that owes much to man&#x27;s oldest stories.&quot; The &quot;mythical&quot; aspects of the Star Wars franchise have been challenged by other film critics. Regarding claims by Lucas himself, Steven Hart observes that Lucas didn&#x27;t mention Joseph Campbell at the time of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot;; evidently they met only in the 1980s. Their mutual admiration &quot;did wonders for [Campbell&#x27;s] visibility&quot; and obscured the tracks of Lucas in the &quot;despised genre&quot; science fiction; &quot;&quot;the epics&quot; make for an infinitely classier set of influences.&quot;

== In music ==

In classical music, Richard Wagner&#x27;s operas were a deliberate attempt to create a new kind of &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; (&#x27;total work of art&#x27;), transforming the legends of the Teutonic past nearly out of recognition into a new monument to the Romantic project.

While ostensibly known for improvised jamming, the rock group Phish first cemented as a group while producing leading member Trey Anastasio&#x27;s senior project in college, called &quot;The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday&quot;. The song cycle features narration of major events in a mythical land called Gamehendge, containing types of imaginary creatures and primarily populated by a race called the &quot;Lizards&quot;. It is essentially a postmodern pastiche, drawing from Anastasio&#x27;s interest in musicals or rock operas as much as from reading philosophy and fiction. The creation of the myth is considered by many fans the thesis statement of the group, musically and philosophically, as Gamehendge&#x27;s book of lost secrets (called the &quot;Helping Friendly Book&quot;) is summarized as an encouragement to improvisation in any part of life: &quot;the trick was to surrender to the flow.&quot;

The black metal band Immortal&#x27;s lyricist Harald Nævdal has created a mythological realm called Blashyrkh filled with demons, battles, winter landscapes, woods, and darkness, described by the band as a northern &quot;Frostdemon&quot; realm.

<doc id="879011" wikidata="Q1253693" url="?curid=879011" title="Price gouging">
<text>Price gouging is a pejorative term for the practice of increasing the prices of goods, services, or commodities to a level much higher than is considered reasonable or fair by some. This commonly applies to price increases of basic necessities after natural disasters. Usually, this event occurs after a demand or supply shock. The term can also be used to refer to profits obtained by practices inconsistent with a competitive free market, or to windfall profits. In some jurisdictions of the United States during civil emergencies, price gouging is a specific crime. Price gouging is considered by some to be exploitative and unethical and by others to be a simple result of supply and demand.

Price gouging is similar to profiteering but can be distinguished by being short-term and localized and by being restricted to essentials such as food, clothing, shelter, medicine, and equipment needed to preserve life and property. In jurisdictions where there is no such crime, the term may still be used to pressure firms to refrain from such behavior. The term is used directly in laws and regulations in the United States and Canada, but legislation exists internationally with similar regulatory purpose under existing competition laws.

It is sometimes used to refer to practices of a coercive monopoly that prices above the market rate by deliberately curtailing production. Alternatively, it may refer to suppliers&#x27; benefiting to excess from a short-term change in the demand curve.

Price gouging became highly prevalent in news media in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, when state price gouging regulations went into effect due to the national emergency. The rise in public discourse was associated with increased shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting inflation after the pandemic has also been blamed, at least in part, by some on price gouging. During the pandemic, the idea of &#x27;greedflation&#x27; or &#x27;seller&#x27;s inflation&#x27; also moved out of the progressive economics fringe by 2023 to be embraced by some mainstream economists, policymakers and business press.

==Laws against price gouging==

=== United States ===
As of March 2021, Proskauer Rose counted 42 states that have emergency regulations or price-gouging statutes. Price-gouging is often defined in terms of the three criteria listed below:

# Period of emergency: The majority of laws apply only to price shifts during a declared state of emergency or disaster.
# Necessary items: Most laws apply exclusively to items essential to survival, such as food, water, and housing.
# Price ceilings: Laws limit the maximum price that can be charged for given goods.

Washington state does not have a specific statute addressing price gouging, can nevertheless have sought to apply its consumer protection act to argue that high prices during COVID-19 for PPE was an &quot;unfair&quot; or &quot;deceptive&quot; practice.
==== When the law goes into effect ====
Statutory prohibitions on price gouging become effective once a state of emergency has been declared. States have legislated different requirements for who must declare a state of emergency for the law to go into effect. Some state statutes that prohibit price gouging—including those of Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, and Ohio—prohibit price increases only once the President of the United States or the state&#x27;s governor has declared a state of emergency in the impacted region. California permits emergency proclamations by officials, boards, and other governing bodies of cities and counties to trigger the state&#x27;s price gouging law.

==== What the law prohibits ====
State laws vary on what price increases are permitted during a declared disaster. California has set a 10 percent ceiling on price increases. The law includes exceptions for price increases that can be justified in terms of the increased cost of supply, transportation, demand, or storage. Florida prohibits a price increase &quot;that grossly exceeds the average price&quot; of that same item in the 30 days leading up to the emergency declaration. Alabama state law does not define what constitutes a &quot;gross disparity,&quot; making it difficult for either affected residents or law enforcement to determine when price gouging has occurred, while others merely limit vendors and landlords to price increases of less than 25 percent. 

==== Enforcement ====
Enforcement of anti-price gouging statutes can be difficult because of the exceptions often contained within the statutes and the lack of oversight mechanisms. Statutes generally give wide discretion not to prosecute. In 2004, Florida determined that one-third of complaints were unfounded, and a large fraction of the remainder was handled by consent decrees, rather than prosecution.

==== California ====
California Penal Code 396 prohibits price gouging, generally defined as anything greater than a 10 percent increase in price on items such as rent, hotel lodging, gasoline, food, and other essentials, once a state of emergency has been declared. Unlike other states that require the President of the United States or the state&#x27;s governor to declare a state of emergency, California allows emergency proclamations by officials, boards, and other governing bodies of cities and counties to trigger C.P.C. § 396.  The prohibition lasts for up to 30 days at a time and may be renewed as necessary.

In the wake of the 2017 California wildfires and the 2018 California wildfires, Governor Jerry Brown repeatedly extended the price-gouging ban for impacted counties. One of his last acts as governor was to extend the prohibitions until May 31, 2019.

Until 2018, the state had no limitations on the rent that could be charged for housing that was not on the market until after a disaster. Due to complaints from the district attorney that she could not prosecute high priced new rentals which came on the market after the Tubbs Fire, the legislature amended C.P.C. § 396. 

The above 2018 price gouging law makes it illegal to offer a previously unrented property for more than about $10,000 per month during an emergency. It also prohibits landlords from increasing rent prices by more than 10% when an emergency is declared. Landlords are also prohibited from accepting fees above this amount even if the tenant submits an offer well above the asking price. In the wake of the January 2025 Palisades Fire, this price cap has made it harder for displaced people to find housing, because many comparable properties normally rent for more than this, and this rent cap discourages owners of high-end vacation homes from making their homes available for rent. One expert estimated that hundreds to thousands more homes might be available for rent if this rent cap did not exist.

====Florida====

Florida&#x27;s &quot;state of emergency&quot; law criminalizes price gouging. A supplier of essential goods and services may be charged when it sharply raises prices in anticipation of or during a civil emergency or when it cancels or dishonors contracts in order to take advantage of an increase in prices related to such an emergency. The model case is a retailer who increases the price of existing stocks of milk and bread when a hurricane is imminent. Though the effect of such laws have been proven to actually increase the risk of extreme shortages since the absence of increased prices replaces higher prices with an incentive for the earliest person to market to obtain all of a product about to imminently experience a period of very high demand.

In Florida, it is a defense to show that the price increase mostly reflects increased costs, such as running an emergency generator or hazard pay for workers, while California places a ten percent cap on any increases.

=== United Kingdom ===
Laws and regulations in the United Kingdom do not use the phrase &quot;price gouging&quot; in consumer protection regulation but are similar to U.S. laws. Chapter II of the UK Competition Act 1998 prohibits businesses with market dominance from engaging in &quot;abusive&quot; conduct, including &quot;unfair&quot; pricing. Market dominance is considered when a business has greater than 40% of the market share within their respective industry. In the case of a violation of Chapter II, a business can be forced to pay up to 10% of global revenues.

=== European Union ===
Similar to UK regulations, the EU does not include &quot;price gouging&quot; explicitly in regulation. Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is &quot;aimed at preventing undertakings who hold a dominant position in a market from abusing that position.&quot; As stated, &quot;such abuse may, in particular, consist in: (a) directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions...&quot; In 2016, the EU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager stated that the EU Commission will &quot;intervene directly to correct excessively high prices&quot; specifically within the gas industry, pharmaceutical industry and in cases of abuse of standard-essential patents.

== Price gouging and COVID-19 ==

On March 13, 2020, a national emergency was declared in the United States by President Trump in response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic; the declaration allowed for an initial $50 billion to be used to support states. As studied by the National Institutes of Health, the COVID-19 pandemic induced a panic as mandates were put in place for Americans to stay at home, quarantine, and wear masks. The declared COVID-19 emergency made state-level price gouging laws and regulations go into effect. Demand for certain products increased while supply decreased. Such products in short supply included surgical masks, N95 respirators, hand sanitizer, and toilet paper. More than 30 states&#x27; attorneys general urged Facebook, Amazon, Craigslist, eBay, and Walmart to restrict the selling of necessary products at &quot;unconscionable&quot; prices.

=== Online price gouging ===

A 2018 appeals court overturned a lower court ruling, arguing that the dormant commerce clause of the U.S. constitution meant Maryland&#x27;s anti-price gouging statute was unconstitutional.

==== &quot;Online Merchants Guild v. Cameron&quot;, 2020 ====
This complaint relates to online merchants selling necessary products on Amazon during the US national state of emergency invoked in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Online Merchants Guild, a trade association for online merchants, filed a case in Kentucky on the basis that state regulations against price gouging are unconstitutional in the online marketplace since online merchants are unable to control pricing by state. Judge Gregory Van Tatenhove sided with the Online Merchants Guild on June 23, 2020, saying that the Kentucky Attorney General cannot enforce the price gouging regulations on Amazon sellers. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously overturned that ruling in April of 2021.

=== Price gouging-related lawsuits during the COVID-19 pandemic ===

In response to the issuance of emergency price gouging regulations, multiple state attorneys general and federal agencies have investigated potential cases of price gouging impacting consumers and agencies. Since regulatory measures vary by state, there is no uniform interpretation of price gouging violations, and it is left to state courts to decide.

==== Eggs ====

On August 11, 2020, New York Attorney General Letitia James sued Hillandale Farms, one of the largest U.S. egg producers, for allegedly price gouging more than four million cartons of eggs by increasing prices by almost five times during the pandemic. The lawsuit alleges that the price increases were an effort to profit off of higher consumer demand during the pandemic. To settle the lawsuit, Hillandale Farms agreed to donate 1.2 million eggs to New York food banks.
==== Personal protective equipment ====

A Mississippi businessman purchased scarce personal protective equipment (PPE) including gowns, face shields, and masks through his pharmaceutical wholesale company. An indictment alleges that the business then solicited health care providers, including the U.S. Veteran&#x27;s Association, to purchase the PPE at excessively inflated prices as part of a $1.8 million scheme. This case was investigated by the FBI, Veteran&#x27;s Association, and Fraud Section of the United States Department of Justice. The charges brought were conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to commit hoarding of designated scarce materials, and hoarding of designated scarce materials.

==Economic analysis==
Allocative efficiency holds that when prices function properly, markets tend to allocate resources to their most valued uses. In turn, those who value the good the most and are able to afford it will pay a higher price than those who do not value the good as much or who are unable to afford it. According to Friedrich Hayek in &quot;The Use of Knowledge in Society&quot; (1945), prices can act to coordinate the separate actions of different people as they seek to satisfy their desires. 

Economists such as Thomas Sowell (Chicago School of economics) in 2004, Donald J. Boudreaux in 2005, and Raymond Niles (Senior Fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research) in 2020 argue that laws prohibiting price gouging worsen emergencies for both buyers and sellers.

In a 2012 survey of leading American economists by the Initiative on Global Markets, only 8 percent agreed with a proposal in Connecticut to prohibit &quot;unconscionably excessive&quot; price increases during severe weather events. Those who disagreed stated that the wording was vague or unenforceable, and that restricting price increases leads to misallocation of resources.

===2020 to present===
In 2022, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis economist Christopher J. Neely said that &quot;most economists believe broad price controls to be costly and ineffective in most situations&quot; because high prices function to &quot;allocate scarce goods and services to buyers who are most willing and able to pay for them, [and] they signal that a good is valued and that producers can profit by increasing the quantity supplied.&quot;

A 2022 Working Paper by the International Monetary Fund explores the implementation of windfall profit taxes, which have gained renewed interest following the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and subsequent surges in energy and food prices. The paper discusses the potential of such taxes as a tool for efficiently taxing economic rents, which are often a result of monopolistic power or unexpected events like pandemics, war, or natural disasters, and contribute to windfall profits. Such profits have raised public and policy concerns about price gouging, where firms are perceived to be profiting excessively from unforeseen circumstances.

In Australia in 2023 and 2024, major supermarket chains Coles and Woolworths received criticism as price gouging, especially in less competitive markets. Coles and Woolworths control 65% of Australia&#x27;s grocery market.

In March 2024, the Federal Trade Commission accused grocery chains in the U.S. of price gouging. The Commission also sued to block the proposed acquisition of Albertsons by Kroger citing the need for more competition to keep prices down. 

A study from 2024 showed that oftentimes when allegations of &quot;price gouging&quot; are made, the profit margins of sellers and vendors is substantially lower than critics believe, such as in the case of grocers recently accused of &quot;price gouging&quot; who actually had a 1.2% profit margin after expenses; with Kroger having their highest profits in the previous 15 years occurring in 2018 at 3%.

<text>Kalpen Suresh Modi ( born April 23, 1977), known professionally as Kal Penn, is an American actor, author, and former White House staff member in the Barack Obama administration. 

As an actor he is known for his portrayals of Lawrence Kutner on the television program &quot;House&quot;, White House staffer Seth Wright on &quot;Designated Survivor&quot;, Kevin, a psychologist and boyfriend to Robin in &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, and Kumar Patel in the &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar&quot; film series. He is also recognized for his performance in the film &quot;The Namesake&quot;. Penn once taught at the University of Pennsylvania in the Cinema Studies Program as a visiting lecturer.

In April 2009, Penn joined the Obama administration as an associate director in the White House Office of Public Engagement as liaison for outreach to Asian Pacific Americans and arts communities. This necessitated that his TV character, Lawrence Kutner, be written out of &quot;House&quot;. Penn briefly left his post in June 2010 to film the third installment of the &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar&quot; series, &quot;A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas&quot;, returning to his White House job upon the film&#x27;s completion. In July 2011, he again left the White House to accept a role in the television series &quot;How I Met Your Mother.&quot;

From 2016 to 2019, he played Seth Wright in the political drama &quot;Designated Survivor&quot;, where he also worked as a consultant on the show. He also hosted the game show &quot;Superhuman&quot;. In 2019, Penn portrayed Garrett Modi in the NBC sitcom series &quot;Sunnyside&quot;. The following year, he hosted a political talk miniseries on Freeform, &quot;Kal Penn Approves This Message&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Penn was born as Kalpen Suresh Modi in Montclair, New Jersey on April 23, 1977, to Indian Hindu immigrant parents from Gujarat. His mother, Asmita Bhatt, is a fragrance evaluator for a perfume company, and his father, Suresh Modi, () is an engineer. His father is from Kheda and his mother was born in Vadodara. Kal Penn regularly visited Gujarat as a child during vacations, and he can speak some Gujarati as well as some Hindi. He has stated that stories of his grandparents marching with Mahatma Gandhi during the Indian independence movement were a significant influence on his interest in politics.

Kal Penn attended Marlboro Middle School in Marlboro Township, New Jersey, where he played baritone saxophone in the jazz band. For high school he attended Freehold Township High School for all four years where he was enrolled in the International Studies Program the first two years. His Junior and Senior years he attended The Fine and Performing Arts Center (a magnet program) at Howell High School in the Acting program (FPAC is a part time program, so he was bused between schools). Both schools are part of the Freehold Regional High School District in New Jersey. He was active in the schools&#x27; theater productions and competed on the Freehold Township National Honor Society Speech and Debate team (formerly known as Forensics). He then attended UCLA, where he double majored in film and sociology, graduating with a B.A. in 2000.

==Career==

===Acting career===
Penn&#x27;s film debut came in 1998 in &quot;&quot;. He has since appeared in &quot;American Desi&quot;, &quot;Van Wilder&quot;, the final episode of &quot;The Lonely Island&quot;, &quot;Malibu&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, &quot;A Lot Like Love&quot;, &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s the Party?&quot;, &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Cost a Thing&quot;, &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, &quot;Epic Movie&quot;, &quot;The Namesake&quot;, the &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar&quot; series, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot; and an uncredited appearance in &quot;Deck the Halls&quot;.

Penn says that he derived his acting name, Kal Penn, as a lark: &quot;Almost as a joke to prove friends wrong, and half as an attempt to see if what I was told would work (that anglicized names appeal more to a white-dominated industry), I put &#x27;Kal Penn&#x27; on my resume and photos.&quot; His audition callbacks rose by 50 percent. He has stated that he prefers his birth name and uses &quot;Kal Penn&quot; only for professional purposes. 

In January 2007, Penn appeared in the first four episodes of the sixth season of &quot;24&quot; as Ahmed Amar, a teenage terrorist. Penn says he nearly turned down the role due to personal ethics:

I have a huge political problem with the role. It was essentially accepting a form of racial profiling. I think it&#x27;s repulsive. But it was the first time I had a chance to blow stuff up and take a family hostage. As an actor, why shouldn&#x27;t I have that opportunity? Because I&#x27;m brown and I should be scared about the connection between media images and people&#x27;s thought processes?

Also in January 2007, he appeared in the spoof comedy &quot;Epic Movie&quot; as well as the television show &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. In May 2007, Penn received the Asian Excellence Award for Outstanding Actor for his performance in &quot;The Namesake&quot;. In fall 2007, Penn joined the cast of the Fox medical drama &quot;House&quot; as a fellowship applicant. 

&quot;E!&quot; reported that Penn had signed on as a regular on the show along with Olivia Wilde and Peter Jacobson and this was confirmed in the plot of the episode &quot;Games&quot;. Penn continued with the series through to the episode &quot;Simple Explanation&quot;, which aired April 6, 2009. He made an additional appearance as Lawrence Kutner on the fifth-season finale, &quot;Both Sides Now&quot;, that aired on May 11, 2009. However, due to his new job at the White House, Penn could not be present for the filming of this episode. The clip of him saying &quot;Too bad it isn&#x27;t true&quot; was taken from a previous filming. Penn returned to the show for the series finale.

In addition to his role on the TV series &quot;House&quot;, he is best known for his role in &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar&quot;, as Kumar Patel, a pothead who goes with Harold Lee (John Cho) to White Castle for hamburgers. Unlike his character, he does not smoke marijuana, saying it is not for him, nor does he eat meat.

Penn had a recurring role on &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; for the seventh season of the show, in which he played Kevin, a therapist and later boyfriend of Robin Scherbatsky. Starting May 1, 2013, Penn hosted &quot;Big Brain Theory: Pure Genius&quot; on the Discovery Channel. In 2013, Penn joined the cast of &quot;We Are Men&quot;.

In 2014, he was cast in Ravi Kumar&#x27;s film &quot;&quot;, a film about the Bhopal gas tragedy, considered by many to be the world&#x27;s worst industrial disaster. Penn played Detective Fontanelle White on the CBS comedy-drama &quot;Battle Creek&quot;, which was canceled during its first season.

In October 2016, Penn began a regular role in the ABC drama series &quot;Designated Survivor&quot; as Seth Wright, a White House speech writer who originally worked under the previous president&#x27;s administration. Following the death of the White House Press Secretary in the pilot episode and the acting press secretary walking out on the job, his character gets promoted to Press Secretary. Penn also served as a political consultant for the series. The show was renewed by Netflix for a third season which was released on June 7, 2019.

Penn has expressed some interest in working in Indian cinema, particularly in Gujarati cinema.

On March 7, 2019, Penn was cast in the main role of Garrett Modi on the NBC comedy &quot;Sunnyside&quot; and the series was ordered on May 6, 2019. The show was cancelled after eight episodes were produced.

On May 9, 2020, Penn was cast as a lead on the 2021 CBS thriller drama series &quot;Clarice,&quot; a sequel to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;.

On December 2, 2021, Penn was set to produce and star in the biopic &quot;Superfan&quot; which depicts the story of Nav Bhatia.

In 2022, he was cast as Simon Choksi/Santa on &quot;The Santa Clauses&quot;, for which he received a nominations for the Outstanding Supporting Performance at the 2nd Children&#x27;s and Family Emmy Awards.

In 2023, Penn guest starred in the Netflix animated series &quot;Scott Pilgrim Takes Off&quot;.

Penn was an advocate for Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign in 2007 and 2008 and a member of Obama&#x27;s National Arts Policy Committee. He appears in the Barack Obama-supporting video &quot;Sí Se Puede Cambiar&quot; by Andres Useche and appeared with comedian George Lopez on January 18, 2009, at &quot;We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial&quot;.

In early 2009, Penn was offered the position of Associate Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs, which he accepted. This necessitated his character Lawrence Kutner being written out of the TV series &quot;House&quot;. In his new role with the Obama administration, Penn served as a liaison with the Asian-American and Pacific Islander communities. He went back to using his birth name, Kalpen Modi.

Having made a commitment before his employment at the White House, Penn left his post as Obama&#x27;s associate director of public engagement on June 1, 2010, to return to his acting career. He returned to office on November 15, 2010, following completion of &quot;A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas&quot;.

Penn was a co-chair of Obama&#x27;s reelection campaign. On September 3, 2012, he hosted coverage of the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. Penn&#x27;s speech at the convention encouraged young people to register to vote and defended Obama&#x27;s record.

On November 18, 2013, Obama appointed Penn to serve on the President&#x27;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities. On February 28, 2014, Penn served as the Master of Ceremonies for the White House Student Film Festival.

Penn publicly supported Bernie Sanders for the 2016 Democratic nomination. He campaigned for Hillary Clinton after she became the nominee.

In August 2017, Penn and the other members of the President&#x27;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities resigned in protest of President Donald Trump&#x27;s remarks about the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

During the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, Penn expressed interest in the messages of Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren. He later expressed support for Joe Biden after he became the nominee. Penn also supported the 2024 presidential election campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.

===Other ventures===
In 2008, Penn served as a visiting lecturer in Asian American Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. His course was titled &quot;Images of Asian Americans in the Media&quot;.

In 2014, Penn was working on a graduate certificate in international security from Stanford University.

On January 2, 2017, Penn won the &quot;MasterChef Celebrity Showdown&quot; and donated the $25,000 cash prize to UNRWA, a United Nations relief and human development agency that supports Palestinian refugees. On January 28, 2017, following a racist comment from a user on Penn&#x27;s Twitter feed, Penn crowd-funded a fundraiser for refugees of the Syrian Civil War and raised $813,533. This occurred during President Donald Trump&#x27;s Executive Order 13769, which banned immigration to the United States from Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Somalia regardless of visa status.

==Personal life==
Penn is Hindu. 

In October 2021, while promoting his memoir, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Be Serious,&quot; Penn announced that he and his boyfriend of 11 years, named Josh, were engaged. In regard to his sexual orientation, Penn said that he had &quot;discovered [his] own sexuality relatively late in life compared to many other people.&quot; However, he feels that &quot;there&#x27;s no timeline on this stuff. People figure their shit out at different times in their lives, so I&#x27;m glad I did when I did.&quot;

<doc id="879024" wikidata="Q421648" url="?curid=879024" title="Aksu City">
<text>Aksu (, ; ) is a city in and the seat of Aksu Prefecture, Xinjiang, lying at the northern edge of the Tarim Basin. The name Aksu literally means &quot;white water&quot; (in Turkic) and is used for both the oasis town and the Aksu River.

The economy of Aksu is mostly agricultural, with cotton, in particular long-staple cotton (&quot;Gossypium hirsutum&quot;), as the main product. Also produced are grain, fruits, oils and beets. The industry mostly consists of weaving, cement and chemical industries.

The land currently under the administration of the Aksu City is divided in two parts, separated by the Aral City. The northern part hosts the city center, while the southern part is occupied by the Taklamakan Desert.

Aksu airport is considered a military airport in China (although also available for civil usage). Only aircraft registered in China can land in Aksu. This means if you are flying to Aksu from international origins you have to land in a major airport in China like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and change to China registered aircraft which tail number starts with B.

==Etymology==
The name Aksu comes from the name of the Aksu River which is the Uyghur word for &quot;white water&quot;. It is transliterated as Akesu in Chinese Pinyin.

==History==

=== Gumo ===
From the Former Han dynasty (125 BCE to 23 CE) at least until the early Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), Aksu was known as Gumo [Ku-mo]. The ancient capital town of Nan (&quot;Southern Town&quot;) was likely well south of the present town.

During the Han dynasty, Gumo is described as a &quot;kingdom&quot; (&quot;guo&quot;) containing 3,500 households and 24,500 individuals, including 4,500 people able to bear arms. It is said to have produced copper, iron and orpiment. The territory of Gumo was roughly situated in the counties of Baicheng and Wensu and the city of Aksu of nowadays.

=== Baluka ===
During the Buddhist era, it was known as Bharuka, Bohuan and Baluka, Bolujia (in pinyin), Po-lu-chia (in Wade–Giles).

The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang visited this &quot;kingdom&quot; in 629 CE and referred to it as Baluka. He recorded that there were tens of Sarvastivadin vihāras in the kingdom and over 1000 Buddhist monks. He said the kingdom was 600 &quot;li&quot; from east to west, and 300 &quot;li&quot; from north to south. Its capital was said to be six &quot;li&quot; in circumference. Xuanzang reported that the &quot;native products, climate, temperament of the people, customs, written language and law are the same as in the country of Kuci or modern Kucha&quot;, some to the east, &quot;but the spoken language is somewhat different&quot; from the Kuchean language, which is also known as Tocharian B and West Tocharian. He also stated that fine cotton and hemp cloth made in the area was traded in neighbouring countries.

=== Contested period ===
In the 7th, 8th, and early 9th centuries, control of the entire region was often contested by Tang China, the Tibetan Empire, and the Uyghur Khaganate; cities frequently changed hands. Tibet seized Aksu in 670, but Tang forces reconquered the region in 692.

The Tang general Tang Jiahui led the Chinese to defeat an Arab-Tibetan attack in the Battle of Aksu (717). The attack on Aksu was joined by Türgesh Khan Suluk. Both Uch Turfan and Aksu were attacked by the Turgesh, Arab, and Tibetan force on 15 August 717. Qarluqs serving under Chinese command, under Arsila Xian, a Western Turkic Qaghan serving under the Chinese Assistant Grand Protector General Tang Jiahui defeated the attack. Al-Yashkuri, the Arab commander and his army fled to Tashkent after they were defeated.

Tibet regained the Tarim Basin in the late 720s, and the Tang dynasty again annexed the region in the 740s. The Battle of Talas led to the gradual withdrawal of Chinese forces, and the region was then contested between the Uyghurs and Tibetans.

Aksu was positioned on a junction of trade routes: the northern Tarim route Silk Road, and the dangerous route north via the Tian Shan&#x27;s Muzart Pass to the fertile Ili Valley.

=== Mongol era ===

In 1207–1208, Aksu submitted to Genghis Khan who founded the Mongol Empire. The area had been part of the whole Mongol Empire before it was occupied by the independent-minded Chagatai Khanate under the House of Ögedei in 1286 from the hands of Kublai&#x27;s Yuan dynasty. After the decline of the Yuan dynasty and the split of the Chagatai Khanate in the mid-14th century, Aksu became a territory of the khanate of Moghulistan. Later Aksu fell under the power of Turkic and Mongol warlords. Like most of Xinjiang, Aksu fell under the control of the Khojas and the Dzungar Khanate. Along with Kashgar, Asku played an important role in east–west exchange.

=== Qing era ===
The Qing dynasty of China conquered the Dzungar Khanate during the final stage of the Dzungar–Qing Wars in the late 1750s. By 1760, the whole Xinjiang including Aksu became the territory of the Qing dynasty. The Aksu region was given immediate legitimacy by the Qing government, which also gave it the name Wensu Independent Department (溫宿直隸州) and appointed an imperial agent to supervise its activity.

Aksu was seized by Yaqub Beg during the Dungan Revolt of 1864–1877. Yakub Beg seized Aksu from Chinese Muslim forces. After the reconquest of Xinjiang, the Qing dynasty formed Aksu Prefecture as part of the new Xinjiang Province in 1884. After the fall of Yakub Beg, a learned cleric named Musa Sayrami (1836–1917), who had occupied positions of importance in Aksu under both rebel regimes, authored &quot;Tārīkh-i amniyya&quot; (History of Peace), which is considered by modern historians as one of the most important historical sources on the period.
British Army officer Francis Younghusband visited Aksu in 1887 on his overland journey from Beijing to British India. He described it as being the largest town he had seen on his way from the Chinese capital, with a population of about 20,000, besides other inhabitants of the district and a garrison of about 2,000 soldiers. &quot;There were large bazaars and several inns—some for travellers, others for merchants wishing to make a prolonged stay to sell goods.&quot;

=== Modern era ===
After the fall of the Qing dynasty, Aksu County () was established by the Republic of China In 1913.

The Battle of Aksu occurred here on 31 May 1933. Isma&#x27;il Beg, a Uighur, became the rebel Tao-yin of Aksu. After the outbreak of the Ili Rebellion, the Ili National Army forces led by Abdulkerim Abbas attempting to take Aksu were repelled by National Revolutionary Army defenders commanded by Zhao Hanqi after two bitter sieges in September 1945.

On 19 August 1983, Aksu County became Aksu City (). The city government began operation on 7 May 1984. Aksu was the site of a bombing in 2010. On 23 January 2013, of territory was transferred from Aksu city to Aral city.

<text>David Whitmer (January 7, 1805 – January 25, 1888) was an early leader of the Latter Day Saint Movement and one of the Three Witnesses to the gold plates of the Book of Mormon. Whitmer later distanced himself from Joseph Smith and was excommunicated from the church in 1838, but continued to affirm his testimony of the Book of Mormon. He was the most interviewed Book of Mormon witness.

==Early life==
Whitmer was born near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on January 7, 1805, the fourth of nine children of Peter Whitmer Sr. and Mary Musselman. Whitmer&#x27;s ancestry on both sides of his family was German, and the family spoke with a German accent. His grandfather was George Witmer, who was born in Prussia, and his great-grandfather was born in Switzerland. Whitmer had five brothers and three sisters, one of which died in 1813 in her infancy. He grew up attending a Presbyterian church. By the 1820s, the Whitmer family had moved to a farm in Fayette, in New York&#x27;s Finger Lakes area. On March 12, 1825, Whitmer was elected sergeant in a newly organized militia called the Seneca Grenadiers.

==Role in the early Latter Day Saint movement==

Whitmer and his family were among the earliest adherents to the Latter Day Saint movement. Whitmer first heard of Mormonism and the golden plates in 1828 when he made a business trip to Palmyra, New York, and talked with his friend Oliver Cowdery, who believed that there &quot;must be some truth to the matter&quot;. Cowdery continued to write Whitmer letters concerning the matter, which Whitmer then shared with his parents and siblings. One of Cowdery&#x27;s letters inquired as to whether the Whitmers would be willing to provide the Smiths with lodging and a place to complete the translation of the Book of Mormon. The family agreed, and Joseph Smith, his wife, Emma Smith, and Cowdery came to the Whitmer farm to live on June 1, 1829. The translation was completed about a month later.

===Book of Mormon witness===

Whitmer was baptized in June 1829, nearly a year prior to the formal organization of the Church of Christ. During that same month, Whitmer said that he, along with Smith and Cowdery, saw an angel present the golden plates in a vision. Martin Harris reported that he experienced a similar vision with Smith later in the day. Evidence places this event near Whitmer&#x27;s father&#x27;s home in Fayette, New York, on June 28, 1829. Later, in an 1878 testimony, Whitmer claimed to have seen a light, &quot;not like the light of the sun, nor like that of a fire, but more glorious and beautiful&quot;. He then went on to describe a table appearing with the golden plates, the Urim and Thummim, and other objects referenced in the Book of Mormon narrative. Whitmer continued: &quot;I heard the voice of the Lord, as distinctly as I ever heard anything in my life, declaring that the records of the plates of the Book of Mormon were translated by the gift and power of God.&quot; Whitmer, Cowdery, and Harris signed a joint statement declaring their testimony to the reality of the vision. The statement was published in the first edition of the Book of Mormon and has been included in nearly every subsequent edition.

===Founding church member===
When Smith organized the Church of Christ on April 6, 1830, Whitmer was one of six original members. In 1835, Whitmer assisted Cowdery and Harris in selecting and ordaining the first Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the church. He also participated in some of the earliest missionary trips, accompanying Joseph Smith and baptizing new converts.

===Church offices===
Whitmer had been ordained an elder of the church by June 9, 1830, and he was ordained to the office of high priest by Cowdery on October 5, 1831. Soon after the organization of the church, Smith specified Jackson County, Missouri, as a &quot;gathering place&quot; for Latter Day Saints. According to Smith, the area would be the &quot;center place&quot; of the City of Zion, the New Jerusalem. On July 7, 1834, Smith ordained Whitmer to be the president of the church in Missouri and his own successor, should Smith &quot;not live to God&quot;.
By virtue of his position as President of the High Council in Zion, David Whitmer was sustained as &quot;the president of the church in Zion,&quot; not merely as a Stake President. Since the Quorum of the Twelve and the First Quorum of the Seventy had not yet been organized, this meant that there was a short period of time—from July 3, 1834, until February 14, 1835—when the High Council in Zion stood in an administrative position next to the First Presidency. It also meant that from July 3, 1834, until December 5, 1834, at which time Oliver Cowdery was made the Associate President of the Church, David Whitmer, as President of the High Council in Zion, was the Prophet&#x27;s rightful successor.&quot;
Cowdery and Whitmer were also called to &quot;search out&quot; twelve &quot;disciples&quot;, who would become the Quorum of the Twelve.

==Separation from the church==

Whitmer continued to live in Kirtland, Ohio, and his counselors, W. W. Phelps and John Whitmer (Whitmer&#x27;s brother) presided over the church in Missouri until the summer of 1837. After the collapse of the Kirtland Safety Society bank, Smith and his counselor Sidney Rigdon, battered by creditors, moved to Far West, Missouri, to evade arrest. The ensuing leadership struggle led to the dissolution of the presidency of the church in Missouri. Whitmer resigned and separated from the church. He was formally excommunicated from the church on the grounds of breaking the Word of Wisdom, neglecting his leadership duties, meeting with the other &quot;Kirtland apostates&quot;, and circulating unfavorable information about Joseph Smith.

Whitmer and the other excommunicated Latter Day Saints became known as the &quot;dissenters&quot;. Some of the dissenters owned land in Caldwell County, Missouri, which they wanted to retain. The church presidency and other members looked unfavorably upon them. Rigdon preached his &quot;Salt Sermon&quot;, which called for their expulsion from the county. A number of Latter Day Saints formed a secret society known as the Danites, whose stated goal was removal of the dissenters. Eighty prominent Mormons signed the so-called Danite Manifesto, which warned the dissenters to &quot;depart or a more fatal calamity shall befall you.&quot; Shortly afterward, Whitmer and his family fled to nearby Richmond, Missouri.

Whitmer, other dissenters, and Mormons loyal to Smith complained to the non-Mormons in northwestern Missouri about their forcible expulsion and the loss of their properties and began to file lawsuits to recover them.

Tensions escalated, bringing about the 1838 Mormon War, after which Governor Boggs issued the Mormon Extermination Order in October 1838, authorizing deadly force in the removal of Mormons. Consequently, most of the Latter Day Saints were expelled from Missouri by early 1839.

In 1887, Whitmer used his position as one of the Three Witnesses to condemn the church in response to these 1838 &quot;persecutions&quot; from a &quot;secret organization&quot; formed within the church that denounced &quot;dissenters&quot;: &quot;If you believe my testimony to the Book of Mormon&quot;, wrote Whitmer, &quot;if you believe that God spake to us three witnesses by his own voice, then I tell you that in June, 1838, God spake to me again by his own voice from the heavens and told me to &#x27;separate myself from among the Latter Day Saints, for as they sought to do unto me, so it should be done unto them.&#x27;&quot; Whitmer interpreted God&#x27;s command to include both the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, (RLDS Church, now known as the Community Of Christ): &quot;God commanded me by his voice to stand apart from you.&quot;

Whitmer continued to live in Richmond, where he operated a livery stable and was elected mayor, a position he held from 1867 to 1868.

==President of the Church of Christ (Whitmerite)==

After the killing of Smith in 1844, several rival leaders claimed to be Smith&#x27;s successor, including Brigham Young, Sidney Rigdon, and James Strang. Many of Rigdon&#x27;s followers became disillusioned by 1847 and some, including apostle William E. McLellin and Benjamin Winchester, remembered Whitmer&#x27;s 1834 ordination to be Smith&#x27;s successor. At McLellin&#x27;s urging, Whitmer exercised his claim to be Smith&#x27;s successor and the Church of Christ (Whitmerite) was formed in Kirtland, Ohio. However, Whitmer never joined the body of the new church and it dissolved relatively quickly.

Around this time, fellow Book of Mormon witness Oliver Cowdery began to correspond with Whitmer. After traveling from Ohio to Kanesville (Council Bluffs), Iowa Cowdery attended the Kanesville Tabernacle meeting, called to sustain Brigham Young as the new President of the Church. Cowdery bore, with conviction, his testimony of the truthfulness of everything that had happened spiritually regarding Smith and the Book of Mormon. Meeting with Young at Winter Quarters, Nebraska, he requested readmission into the church, and he was re-baptized into the church there. Cowdery then traveled to meet with Whitmer in Richmond to persuade him to move west and rejoin the Saints in Utah Territory. Cowdery, however, succumbed to tuberculosis and died March 3, 1850.

In January 1876, Whitmer resurrected the Church of Christ (Whitmerite) by ordaining his nephew, John C. Whitmer, an elder, and giving him the title &quot;First Elder&quot;.

In 1887, Whitmer published a pamphlet entitled &quot;&quot;, in which he affirmed his testimony of the Book of Mormon, but denounced the other branches of the Latter Day Saint movement. Whitmer died in Richmond. The Whitmerite church survived until the 1960s.

==Religious views==

Whitmer stated his religious views in three publications: &quot;&quot; published March 24, 1881, &quot;&quot; published April 1887, and &quot;&quot; also published April 1887.

===Polygamy===
===High Priests===
===Name change===
==The most interviewed Book of Mormon witness==
Because Cowdery died in 1850 at age 43 and Martin Harris died in 1875 at age 92, Whitmer was the only survivor of the Three Witnesses for 13 years. At Richmond, Missouri, he sometimes received several inquirers daily asking about his connection to the Book of Mormon, including missionaries of the LDS Church who were traveling from Utah Territory to the eastern United States and Europe. Despite his hostility toward the LDS Church, Whitmer always stood by his claim that he had actually seen the golden plates.

Some of the 71 recorded interviews he gave between 1838 and 1888 contained different details than others. Recounting the vision to Orson Pratt in 1878, Whitmer claimed to have seen not only the golden plates but the &quot;Brass Plates, the plates containing the record of the wickedness of the people of the world[...] the sword of Laban, the Directors (i.e. the ball which Lehi had) and the Interpreters. I saw them just as plain as I see this bed&quot;.

In 1880, John Murphy interviewed Whitmer and later published an account suggesting that perhaps Whitmer&#x27;s experience was a &quot;delusion or perhaps a cunning scheme&quot;. Murphy&#x27;s account said that Whitmer had not been able to describe the appearance of an angel and had likened Whitmer&#x27;s experience to the &quot;impressions as the quaker [receives] when the spirit moves, or as a good Methodist in giving a happy experience.&quot; Whitmer responded by publishing &quot;&quot;, reaffirming his testimony and saying:

To the &quot;Proclamation&quot; Whitmer attached an affidavit attesting to his honesty and standing in the community. Whitmer ordered that his testimony to the Book of Mormon be placed on his tombstone.

In response to a question by Anthony Metcalf, Whitmer attempted to clarify the &quot;spiritual&quot; versus &quot;natural&quot; viewing of the plates:

<doc id="879037" wikidata="Q957627" url="?curid=879037" title="Luis Alberto Spinetta">
<text>Luis Alberto Spinetta (23 January 1950 – 8 February 2012), nicknamed &quot;El Flaco&quot; (Spanish for &quot;skinny&quot;), was an Argentine singer, guitarist, composer, writer and poet. One of the most influential rock musicians of Argentina, he is widely regarded as one of the founders of Argentine rock, which is considered as the first incarnation of Spanish-language rock. Born in Buenos Aires in the residential neighbourhood of Belgrano, he was the founder of iconic rock bands including Almendra, Pescado Rabioso, Invisible, Spinetta Jade, and Spinetta y Los Socios del Desierto. In Argentina, January 23rd is celebrated as &quot;Día Nacional del Músico&quot; (National Musician&#x27;s Day) in honor of Spinetta&#x27;s birth.

Spinetta devoted himself fully to his own music. In his lyrics, there are influences of multiple writers, poets and artists like Arthur Rimbaud, Vincent van Gogh, Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud, Friedrich Nietzsche, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Carlos Castañeda and Antonin Artaud, whom the album &quot;Artaud&quot; (1973) is named after.

In December 2011 he announced that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer. He died on 8 February 2012 at the age of 62. His ashes were scattered in Buenos Aires in the waters of the Río de la Plata, according to his last wish.

==Music==
===The late 1960s and the 1970s===
In the late 1960s, against the backdrop of the reactionary and authoritarian government of General Juan Carlos Onganía, Buenos Aires was undergoing a cultural blossoming of new artistic expressions; the new generation of the middle class was immersed in an effervescence that would not reappear in Argentina until the return to democracy in 1983.

In 1969, Spinetta&#x27;s band, Almendra, recorded their self-titled first album. They started recording and playing intensively, becoming successful almost overnight. Almendra composed their own songs and their lyrics were written in Spanish, something which was still new for Argentine rock music. After two albums that were received with critical acclaim and continuous radio exposure, the band split.

After a lengthy stay in Europe, Spinetta returned to Argentina and afterwards formed a new band, named Pescado Rabioso. With a far more powerful sound and expressing through their songs the tension of the streets in an increasingly violent Argentina, Pescado made their album debut in 1972. It was both a continuation of the creative stream of Spinetta and a drastic change in the style of his own music and lyrics. Later, the band recorded a second album named Pescado 2. Although a third album, released in 1973 and called &quot;Artaud,&quot; carried the band&#x27;s name, the band had actually already dissolved. Therefore, it was mostly a solo album by Spinetta himself. Partly inspired by the writings of Theatre of Cruelty creator Antonin Artaud, particularly his essays &quot;Van Gogh, le suicidé de la société&quot; (&quot;Van Gogh, the suicide by society&quot;) and &quot;Héliogabale ou l&#x27;Anarchiste couronné&quot; (&quot;Heliogabalus, or the anarchist crowned&quot;), Spinetta exorcised many of the demons of his past in this album. He simultaneously released a manifesto entitled &quot;Rock: música dura, la suicidada por la sociedad&quot; (&quot;Rock: tough music, suicided by society&quot;), a reference to Artaud&#x27;s essay, in which he denounced the nihilistic hedonism and commercialisation he saw as having corrupted rock music. This process would open the door to a new era in his music.

In 1974, Spinetta formed a new band, Invisible, whose music was based in progressive rock and psychedelia. With his new band he recorded three albums: &quot;Invisible&quot;, &quot;Durazno Sangrando&quot; and &quot;El jardín de los presentes&quot;. In the latter, Spinetta took a novel approach, incorporating elements of tango and jazz into his sound.

After recording and editing a failed album in the United States in 1979, with lyrics in English and destined to the U.S. market, Spinetta returned to Argentina to record two albums with a short-lived Almendra revival (one with original songs and the other live), and embarked on a new project, Spinetta Jade. 

===The 1980s and beyond===

Spinetta Jade would prove to be a successful and innovative band; Spinetta was joined by some of the most acclaimed Argentine musicians to help him build the new sound he was building since Invisible. The product: a blend of jazz and rock that was unseen in Argentina drawing away from the symphonic rock that dominated the middle 70s, and escaping the boom of new wave, punk, reggae, glam pop etc that reached both the world and Argentina in the 1980s. These four albums, &quot;Alma de Diamante&quot; (1980), &quot;Los Niños que Escriben en el Cielo&quot; (1981), &quot;Bajo Belgrano&quot; (1983) and &quot;Madre en Años Luz&quot; (1984), represent a defined style as well as the footprints of Spinetta&#x27;s evolution. Spinetta and Charly García (with their respective bands at the moment, Jade and Serú Giran) joined efforts and gave what was considered amongst the most important shows in the history of Argentine rock. After dissolving Spinetta Jade in 1984, Spinetta worked on an album with Charly, but eventually they abandoned their efforts. Only two songs remain of the ill-fated effort, &quot;Rezo por Vos&quot; and &quot;Total Interferencia&quot;.

By 1982, Spinetta had restarted his solo projects. &quot;Kamikaze&quot; (1982) puts together a number of previously unreleased songs (one gem is an early song he composed in 1965 called &quot;Barro Tal Vez&quot;). In &quot;Mondo Di Cromo&quot; (1983) Spinetta&#x27;s new production, from 1986 to 1993, would include four solo albums (&quot;Privé&quot;, 1986), &quot;Téster de Violencia&quot; (1988), &quot;Don Lucero&quot; (1989), &quot;Pelusón of Milk &quot;(1991), a joint album with Fito Páez, another Argentine great (&quot;La La La&quot;, 1986), and the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Fuego Gris&quot; (named after the film, 1993).

After a long hiatus, largely due to Spinetta&#x27;s conflicts with recording companies, he finally opened a new period in his music with his new band: Spinetta y los Socios del Desierto. Over three years (1997–1999) the band released four albums. Two studio albums, the double &quot;Socios del Desierto&quot; (1997) and &quot;Los Ojos&quot; (1999) would bring a new sound. The band made an MTV Unplugged live album, &quot;Estrelicia&quot; (1998), which, because of its soft acoustics, contrasts with their live album, &quot;San Cristóforo&quot; (1998). As Spinetta said at the beginning of the first concert, &quot;Fans de lo acústico, abstenerse&quot; (&quot;Fans of acoustic music, refrain&quot;). In 1998, he selected the featured songs and artwork of a greatest hits album called &quot;Elija y Gane&quot;, which was released the same year. 

The band dissolved quietly towards the end of 1999. Spinetta started a solo career, including &quot;Silver Sorgo&quot; (2001), &quot;Obras en Vivo&quot; (2002), a live album, &quot;Para Los Árboles&quot; (2003), &quot;Camalotus&quot; (2004), a single of three unreleased songs and one remix, &quot;Pan&quot; (2006) and &quot;Un Mañana&quot; (2008). In 2005, he received the Platinum Konex Award for best rock soloist of the 1995–2005 decade. A number of books and TV documentaries have been devoted to him, like Argentine writer Eduardo Berti&#x27;s, which includes a long conversation with Spinetta, among many others 

Spinetta celebrated his 40 years in music with a five-and-a-half-hour concert called &quot;Spinetta y las Bandas Eternas&quot; (Spinetta and The Eternal Bands) in front of 40 thousand fans at Vélez Sarsfield Stadium in Buenos Aires. It was later considered by Argentine music critics as &quot;the greatest gig of the decade&quot;.

==Death==
Spinetta died of lung cancer at 62 years of age on 8 February 2012.

==Family==
Spinetta had four children: Dante (born 1976), Catarina (b. 1979), Valentino (b. 1983) and Vera (b. 1991).
