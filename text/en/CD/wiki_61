<text>Celebrity is a 1998 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Woody Allen, and features an ensemble cast. The screenplay describes the divergent paths taken by a couple following their divorce.

The film received lukewarm reviews from critics and was a commercial disappointment.

==Plot==
Lee Simon is an unsuccessful novelist turned travel writer who immerses himself in celebrity journalism following a midlife crisis and subsequent divorce from his insecure wife, Robin, a former English teacher, after sixteen years of marriage.

As he stumbles his way through both professional encounters and sexual escapades with performers, models, and other players in the world of entertainment, Lee increasingly questions his purpose in life. He ruins numerous opportunities due to his fame-seeking, insecurities and neuroses.

Meanwhile, Robin trades her many neuroses for a makeover and a job with television producer Tony Gardella that leads to her own celebrity interview program. She takes advantage of numerous opportunities and ends up happy and successful.

==Cast==
== Production ==
The film was shot in black-and-white on location in New York City by cinematographer Sven Nykvist. &quot;Celebrity&quot; was the last of four films shot by Nykvist for Allen. It also marks the end of Allen&#x27;s long collaboration with editor Susan E. Morse, who had edited the previous twenty of Allen&#x27;s films beginning with &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979).

==Release==
The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival and was shown at the New York Film Festival before going into general release in the US on November 20, 1998. It opened on 493 screens, grossing $1,588,013 and ranking #10 on its opening weekend. It eventually earned $5,078,660 in the US.

== Critical reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has 42% rating based on reviews from 43 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus calls it &quot;Entertaining, but too scattered.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 42% based on reviews from 25 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed, &quot;Lee Simon is one of the filmmaker&#x27;s wearier creations, in ways that deny &quot;Celebrity&quot; the bracing audacity of recent, better Allen films like &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; and &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot;. And even with Branagh as his younger alter ego, Allen finds no way to revitalize the character&#x27;s predictable worries about advancing his career and chasing beautiful women ... Though &quot;Celebrity&quot; is filled with beautiful and famous faces, it has plenty of opportunity to bog down between star turns, and some of the episodes about the Simons are astonishingly flat.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said the film &quot;plays oddly like the loose ends and unused inspirations of other Woody Allen movies; it&#x27;s sort of a revue format in which a lot of famous people appear onscreen, perform in the sketch Woody devises for them and disappear. Some of the moments are very funny. More are only smile material, and a few don&#x27;t work at all. Like all of Allen&#x27;s films, it&#x27;s smart and quirky enough that we&#x27;re not bored, but we&#x27;re not much delighted, either ... Branagh has all the Allen vocal mannerisms and the body language of comic uncertainty. He does Allen so carefully, indeed, that you wonder why Allen didn&#x27;t just play the character himself.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt the film &quot;suffers from lulls and lapses and one lulu of a casting gaffe, but this keenly observant spoof of the fame game is hardly the work of a burnout. At sixty-two, the Woodman can still mine caustic laughter from the darkest corners of his psyche. In &quot;Celebrity&quot;, he cracks his ringmaster&#x27;s whip on a circus of rude, cathartic fun ... Branagh, whether by his choice or his director&#x27;s, plays Lee like a Woody impressionist, down to the nervous gestures and the stuttering whine ... Lee should emerge as flawed but real in a world of gorgeous poseurs. Instead, Branagh&#x27;s party-trick performance keeps audiences at a distance. What saves the day is the steady march of scintillating cameos from actors who bring out the best in Allen&#x27;s barbed dialogue.&quot;

Edward Guthmann of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; stated, &quot;Branagh stammers, bobs his head and runs the gamut of other established Woody tics and mannerisms – delivering nervous shtick where a performance would have sufficed. His novelty act belongs in the same bin with his hammy histrionics in &quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot; ... The irony of &quot;Celebrity&quot; is that so much of it is admirably acted, written and directed. Despite his one-note obsessions, Allen is a fine director whose stories clip along, whose dialogue sparkles and whose actors look grateful for the luxury of his words.&quot;

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a once-over-lightly rehash of mostly stale Allen themes and motifs&quot; and added, &quot;The spectacle of Kenneth Branagh and Judy Davis doing over-the-top Woody Allen impersonations creates a neurotic energy meltdown ... Branagh is simply embarrassing as he flails, stammers and gesticulates in a manner that suggests a direct imitation of Allen himself ... For her part, Davis was brilliant in &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; and has appeared effectively in other Allen films, but she not only overdoes the neurotic posturing this time but is essentially miscast ... Annoyingly mannered in performance as well as tiresomely familiar in the way it trots out its angst-ridden urban characters&#x27; problems, [the picture] has a hastily conceived, patchwork feel that is occasionally leavened by some lively supporting turns and the presence of so many attractive people onscreen.&quot;

Neil Norman of the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; noted that &quot;many scenes, and indeed personalities, lack the credence of similar shots in &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, &quot;Manhattan&quot; or even &quot;Stardust Memories&quot;. Judy Davis&#x27;s doorstepping television interviews in the Jean-Georges restaurant where she encounters several well-heeled New Yorkers, including Donald Trump (who is planning to buy St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral and knock it down) are frankly risible; a rehearsal scene in the Ziegfeld Theatre where [Winona Ryder] is being coached in the art of seducing a woman (gasp!) smacks of old-fashioned prurience. Fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi&#x27;s turn as a lionised New York artist complaining at his opening at the Serge Sorokko Gallery in SoHo that fame will ruin him, is simply banal. Even the opening shot, of a film crew on the streets attempting to catch a reaction shot of Melanie Griffith&#x27; walking from a limo, is peopled with a veteran film-maker&#x27;s notion of what young hip film-makers are like (shavenheaded, natch) rather than an identifiable reality.&quot;

The film drew comparisons to Federico Fellini″s film &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;. Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; graded the film B− and called it a &quot;big, muddled, contemporary variation on &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;. She added, &quot;[I]n every minute of DiCaprio&#x27;s participation ... he juices &quot;Celebrity&quot; with a power surge that subsides as soon as he exits.&quot;

<text>Corydon McAlmont Wassell (July 4, 1884 – May 12, 1958) was a medical doctor best known for his work as a United States Navy physician. He was born in Little Rock, Arkansas.

Wassell graduated with an M.D. from the University of Arkansas in 1909 and began his practice in Tillar, Arkansas. In 1913, he left his practice to serve as a medical missionary in Wuchang, China.

Wassell resumed regular duties with the United States Navy Reserve in 1936. In 1942, during World War II, he was a lieutenant commander, U.S.N.R., and acted as liaison officer for about forty wounded American servicemen from the USS &quot;Marblehead&quot; in a Dutch hospital in Java. He was awarded the Navy Cross for saving twelve of the most severely wounded from certain capture by the Japanese on Java, and accompanying them to Fremantle and safety.

Wassell&#x27;s Navy Cross citations reads:

For especially meritorious conduct, devotion to duty, and utter disregard of personal safety, while in imminent contact with enemy forces and under attack from enemy aircraft, in caring for and evacuating the wounded of the United States Navy under his charge in Java, Netherlands East Indies, about March 1, 1942.
A radio speech by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt inspired Cecil B. DeMille to make a movie about Wassell, starring Gary Cooper. Titled &quot;The Story of Dr. Wassell&quot;, it was based on a biographical novel written by James Hilton. Wassell served as an uncredited technical adviser to the movie. According to his great-grandson, all of the proceeds that Wassell received from the movie were donated to a hospital for the deaf and blind in Little Rock.

Wassell died on May 12, 1958, in Little Rock and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His Little Rock home is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>The Ballard Terminal Railroad Company LLC operates two Class III short line terminal railroads in western Washington, United States. Founded in 1997 to operate a three-mile spur through Seattle&#x27;s Ballard neighborhood, the Ballard Terminal Railroad has expanded to operate two additional lines in the Puget Sound area, including Eastside Freight Railroad from Snohomish to Woodinville, Washington, and Meeker Southern Railroad , a segment from East Puyallup (&quot;Meeker&quot;) to McMillin, Washington. Eastside Freight Railroad has ceased operation as of mid 2020.

==Foundation==
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway stopped offering service on a three-mile spur through Seattle&#x27;s Ballard neighborhood in January 1997 because only three companies were buying rail shipments, a traffic volume too low to sustain the line according to BNSF. To ensure continued rail service, the three previous customers served by the spur and a fourth company joined with other investors to form the Ballard Terminal Railroad Company, LLC in 1997. The Ballard Terminal Railroad refurbished two locomotives and approached the state of Washington seeking approximately $300,000 in financing to refurbish the track. The railroad began operation in early 1998 with a 1940s-era locomotive formerly belonging to the Milwaukee Road.

==Locomotives==
 Ballard Terminal Railroad operates one locomotive, an EMD SW1 locomotive numbered 98 formerly owned by Milwaukee Road. The locomotive&#x27;s black, red and silver livery and nickname, &quot;Li&#x27;l Beaver&quot;, pay tribute to the colors and mascot of nearby Ballard High School.

Eastside Freight Railroad once operated an EMD SW1200 locomotive now numbered MSN 109 built in 1963 for the Missouri Pacific. Eastside Freight purchased the locomotive from Tacoma Rail in 2009, which had it listed as surplus property.

Meeker Southern Railroad operates an EMD SW9 locomotive numbered 103.

==Routes==
The Ballard Terminal Railroad operates three rail lines in the greater Seattle area.

===Ballard Terminal===

The Ballard Terminal Railroad spur begins at its connection to the BNSF mainline at the Shilshole yard just north of NW 68th Street. The line follows a route along Seaview Avenue NW toward Shilshole Ave NW which the line parallels until NW 45th Street. The line follows NW 45th Street until Leary Way NW, which the line then parallels, passing the Bright Street Yard, then reaching its terminus at NW 40th Street and 6th Avenue NW near the border between the Ballard and Fremont neighborhoods. This route runs parallel to and has multiple crossings with the Burke–Gilman Trail. The Ballard Terminal Railroad owns its tracks outright, but has a 30-year lease on the land underneath, which belongs to the city of Seattle. Most of the railroad was originally part of the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s main line, moved to the west when the Lake Washington Ship Canal was built. In October 2023, a short stretch of the tracks was paved over, just east of the Ballard Bridge at the intersection of Shilshole Avenue NW and NW 45th Street, thereby cutting the spur in two. Operations continue west of the bridge.

===Meeker Southern===
Meeker Southern Railroad&#x27;s segment runs from East Puyallup (&quot;Meeker&quot;) to McMillin, Washington. 

===Eastside Freight===
Eastside Freight Railroad, which started operation in 2009 on the former BNSF Railway&#x27;s Woodinville Subdivision, is a segment from Snohomish to Woodinville. Eastside Freight Railroad has ceased operation as of mid 2020. 

====Eastside Rail Corridor====

On April 1, 2013, Ballard Terminal Railroad filed a federal lawsuit aimed at preventing the City of Kirkland from converting the section of the Eastside Rail Corridor which passes through the city into a trail. On May 3, 2013, Federal District Court Judge Marsha Pechman granted the City of Kirkland&#x27;s motion to dismiss the case filed by Ballard Terminal Railroad Company seeking to prevent rail salvage on the Cross Kirkland Corridor. In her oral ruling, Judge Pechman stated the Federal District Court did not have jurisdiction to consider Ballard&#x27;s temporary restraining order (TRO) and that the Surface Transportation Board was the proper forum for adjudicating Ballard&#x27;s claims. On August 1, 2013, the Surface Transportation Board denied the request by Ballard Terminal Railroad Company to block rail removal along the Cross Kirkland Corridor.

==Operations==
As of 2008, the Ballard Terminal Railroad serves only one customer on the Ballard Spur, Salmon Bay Sand and Gravel. BNSF delivers cars containing cement, fly ash, stucco and mortar to the Shilshole Yard; the Ballard Terminal Railroad then delivers these cars to Salmon Bay Sand and Gravel two to three times per week, typically at night.

===Awards===
In 2007 the Ballard Terminal Railroad received the Jake Award With Distinction, a safety award given by the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association to railroads with no reportable injuries.

<text>Kohala is the oldest of five volcanoes that make up the island of Hawaii. Kohala is an estimated one million years old—so old that it experienced, and recorded, the reversal of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field 780,000 years ago. It is believed to have breached sea level more than 500,000 years ago and to have last erupted 120,000 years ago. Kohala is in area and in volume, and thus constitutes just under 6% of the island of Hawaii.

Kohala is a shield volcano cut by multiple deep gorges, which are the product of thousands of years of erosion. Unlike the typical symmetry of other Hawaiian volcanoes, Kohala is shaped like a foot. Toward the end of its shield-building stage 250,000 to 300,000 years ago, a landslide destroyed the northeast flank of the volcano, reducing its height by over and traveling across the sea floor. This huge landslide may be partially responsible for the volcano&#x27;s foot-like shape. Marine fossils have been found on the flank of the volcano, far too high to have been deposited by standard ocean waves. Analysis indicated that the fossils had been deposited by a massive tsunami approximately 120,000 years ago.

Because it is so far from the nearest major landmass, the ecosystem of Kohala has experienced geographic isolation, resulting in a unique ecosystem. There are several initiatives to preserve this ecosystem against invasive species. Crops, especially sweet potato &quot;(Ipomoea batatas)&quot;, have been cultivated on the Leeward side of the volcano for centuries. The northern part of the island is named after the mountain, with two districts named North and South Kohala. King Kamehameha I, the first King of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was born in North Kohala, near Hawi.

==Geology==

===History===
Studies of the volcano&#x27;s lava accumulation rate have put the volcano&#x27;s age at somewhere near one million years. It is believed to have breached sea level more than 500,000 years ago. Beginning 300,000 years ago, the rate of eruption slowly decreased over a long period of time to a point where erosion wore the volcano down faster than Kohala rebuilt itself through volcanic activity. Decreasing eruptions combined with increasing erosion caused Kohala to slowly weather away and subside into the ocean. The oldest lava flows that are still exposed at the surface are just under 780,000 years old. It is difficult to determine the original size and shape of the volcano, as the southeast flank has been buried by volcanic lava flows from nearby Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa. However, based on a sharp increase of incline on the submarine slope of the volcano at a depth of , scientists estimate that in its prime the portion of Kohala that was above the water was more than wide. Geologists estimate that the volcano was once about twice its current size.

The volcano is so old that it experienced, and recorded, a reversal of magnetic polarity (a change in the orientation of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field so that the positions of the North and South poles interchange) that happened 780,000 years ago. Fifty flow units in the top of exposed strata in the Pololu section are of normal polarity, indicating that they were deposited within the last 780,000 years. Radiometric dating ranged mostly from 450,000 to 320,000 years ago, although several pieces strayed lower; this indicated a period of eruptive history at the time.
Kohala was devastated by a massive landslide between 250,000 and 300,000 years before present. Debris from the slide was found on the ocean floor up to away from the volcano. Twenty kilometers wide at the shoreline, the landslide cut back to the summit of the volcano, and is partially, if not largely, responsible for the volcano losing in height since then. The famous sea cliffs of the windward Kohala shoreline stand as evidence of the massive geologic disaster, and mark the topmost part of the debris from this ancient landslide. There are also several other unique features found on the volcano, all marks made by the decimating collapse.

Kohala is thought to have last erupted 120,000 years ago. However, several samples of a more recent date have been obtained. Two samples collected about apart, obtained from Waipio Valley on the volcano&#x27;s east flank in 1977, were dated reliably to 60,000 years. Another double set of samples, collected from the western part in 1996, was measured to be 80,000 years in age. The samples have been treated with skepticism by the scientific community, and their ages have been directly challenged. The rocks collected from the west site have not been tested by subsequent experiments. The lava samples collected from the eastern site were allegedly found under a Mauna Loa lava flow, which had been previously dated to 187,000 years. The Kohala lava flows could be as young as 120,000 years although they may be even younger.

In 2004, unidentified marine fossils were found at the base of the volcano inshore. A research team led by University of Hawaii&#x27;s Gary McMurtry and Dave Tappin of the British Geological Survey found that the fossils had been deposited by a massive tsunami, above the current sea level. The team dated the fossils and nearby volcanic rock at about 120,000 years old. Based on the rate of Kohala&#x27;s subsidence over the past 475,000 years, it was estimated that the fossils were deposited at a height of about , well out of reach of storms and far above the normal sea level at the time. The timing corresponds with the last great landslide of nearby Mauna Loa. Researchers hypothesize that the underwater landslide from the nearby volcano triggered a gigantic tsunami, which swept up coral and other small marine organisms, depositing them on the western face of Kohala. Mauna Loa, an active volcano, has since repaired its flank. Marine geologist Tappin believes that a &quot;future collapse on this volcano, with the potential for mega-tsunami generation, is almost certain.&quot;

===Structure===
Kohala had two active rift zones, a characteristic common to Hawaiian volcanoes. The double ridge, shaped axially, was active in both the shield and postshield stages. The southeast rift zone passes under the nearby Mauna Kea and reappears further southeast in the Hilo Ridge, as indicated by the relationship between collected lava samples. In addition, the two features align to one another more closely than does the ridge to Mauna Kea, of which it was once thought to constitute a part. The bulk of the ridge is built of volcanic rock with reverse magnetic polarity, evidence that the volcano is at least 780,000 years old. Older lava dated from the toe of the ridge was estimated to be roughly between 1.1 and 1.2 million years old.

Geologists have classified the volcano&#x27;s lava flows into two units. The Hawi Volcanic layers were deposited in the postshield stage of the volcano&#x27;s life, and the younger Pololu Volcanics were deposited in the volcano&#x27;s shield-building stage. The rock in the younger Hawi section, which overlies the older Pololu flows, is mostly 260,000 to 140,000 years old, and composed mainly of hawaiite and trachyte. The separation between the two layers is not clear; the lowest layers may actually be in the Pololu section, based on their depositional patterns and low phosphorus content. The time intervals separating the two periods of volcanic evolution were extremely brief, something first noted in 1988.

The forest-covered summit of the volcano consists of many cones which generated lava from its two rift zones between 240,000 and 120,000 years ago. Kohala completed its shield-building stage 245,000 years ago and has been in decline ever since. Potassium-argon dating indicates that the volcano last erupted about 120,000 years ago in the late Pleistocene. Kohala is currently in transition between the postshield and erosional Hawaiian volcanic stages in the life cycle of Hawaiian volcanoes.

The United States Geological Survey has assessed the extinct Kohala as a low-risk area. The volcano is in zone 9 (bottom risk), while the border of the volcano with Mauna Kea is zone 8 (second lowest), as Mauna Kea has not produced lava flows for 4,500 years.

Kohala, like other shield volcanoes, has a shallow surface slope due to the low viscosity of the lava flows that formed it; however, the northwest shoreline boasts some of the highest seacliffs on Earth. Events during and after its eruptions give the volcano several unique geomorphic features, some possibly resulting from the ancient collapse and landslide. The volcano is shaped like a foot; the northeast coast is prominently indented across of shoreline.

There is a small string of faults on and near the main summit caldera, arranged parallel to the northern coast. The faults were originally regarded to be a direct result of the collapse; however scientists note the fault lines do not go all the way to the coast but are arranged tightly clustered around the caldera. This indicates that the fault lines may have been caused indirectly, possibly due to the sudden release of stress during the event.

==Hydrology==

Mauna Kea causes the trade winds to divert around it, increasing wind to super-enhanced flow over the Kohala ridge and orographic lift brings most of the rainfall to the northeastern slope of Kohala. The windward side of Kohala mountain is dissected by multiple, deeply eroded stream valleys in a southwest–northeast alignment, cutting into the flanks of the volcano. North of Kohala&#x27;s summit the volcano&#x27;s northwest–southeast trending rift zone separates rainfall into two streams, going southeast, into Waipio Valley, or northwest, into Honokane Nui Valley. When the volcano was still active, vertical sheets of magma, arranged in what is known as dikes, forced their way out of the magma reservoir and intruded into the rift zone, which was weakened by the collapse. As the dikes forced their way up, they formed fractures and faults parallel to the rift zone. The exertion caused by the dikes produced a series of faults along its length, forming horsts and grabens (fault blocks). Northeast of the Kohala summit, where the most rainfall occurs, the faulted structure prevents summit rainwater from naturally flowing northeast down the mountain slope. Instead, the rainwater flows down laterally and empties into the back of what have thus become the largest valleys (Waipio and Honokane Nui).
The leeward northwestern slope of Kohala has few stream valleys cut into it, the result of the rain shadow effect, as the dominant trade winds bring most of the rainfall to the northeastern slope of the volcano. The seven windward valleys of Kohala are, from southeast to northwest, Waipio, Waimanu, Honopue, Honokea, Honokane Iki, Honokane Nui, and Pololu. The size of the valleys reflects the amount of drainage they have been able to capture; Waipio, the largest, at some point drained Waimanu Valley as well, and the former headwaters of Waimanu are now one of its branches. Waimanu valley, cut off from its headwaters to the summit and left with Wai&#x27;ilikahi as its main tributary, still had managed to form a substantial floodplain, although less than half the size of Waipio. Honokane Nui, the third largest valley, has its drainage almost exclusively from the north side of the summit, and as a result is a deep, long, narrow bottomed valley with little habitable floodplain.

The remaining valleys derive all their water from the lower northeastern slopes of the volcano, and as a result are smaller. In addition, there are innumerable gulches of various depths which have not yet reached sea level and began to form flood plains, becoming valleys. Still, some of these are more than in depth. The depth of the actual valley walls at the seashore range from at the Waipio Valley Lookout at the southeastern corner of Kohala mountain, to a high of over in Honopue, then diminishing to less than at Pololu Lookout at the northern end of the valleys. In the back, deeper in the mountain, all of the valleys have sheer walls well in excess of . Numerous spectacular waterfalls cascade or fall over these cliffs. Some, such as Hi&#x27;ilawe Falls in Waipi&#x27;o valley, have single drops exceeding .

The volcano stayed active well into the formation of these mountainside valleys, as illustrated by later Pololu lava flows, which covered the north and northwestern end of Kohala volcano and often flowed into Pololu Valley. Recent seafloor mapping seems to show that the valley extends a short way beyond the seashore, then terminates at what may be the headwall of the great landslide found off the northeast coast of Kohala.

In addition to being a primary factor in the development of the largest valleys, the dike complex plays another important role —that of creating and maintaining the water table. Hawaiian lava is extremely permeable and porous. Rainwater easily seeps into the lava, creating a large lens of fresh water below the island surface. In most places, the top of the water table is just a few feet from sea level, as the fresh water lens is floating on salt water. Unlike porous lava flows, however, dikes cool underground into dense rock with few cracks and vesicles. The dikes act as impermeable vertical walls through which groundwater cannot flow. Deep layers of ash compact into impermeable layers between lava flows, preventing percolation of the rainwater. Rainwater that would ordinarily seep right through the ground gets trapped in the dike &quot;reservoirs,&quot; located well above sea level. The groundwater is confined to a flow along the dike until it finds a means to escape.

In Kohala, the numerous dikes near the summit inhibit groundwater from seeping downslope to the northeast, where it naturally wants to go. Rather, the Kohala dike complex guides it northwest or southeast, down the axis of the rift zones, just like the surface water. On the other hand, the three smaller valleys between the large ones - Honopue, Honokea, and Honokane Iki - as well as the many smaller gulches which are not yet valleys, are deprived of groundwater by the orientation of the rift zone and its dikes. Without the large amount of water that is received by the bigger valleys, these valleys grow far more slowly. Due to its topography as essentially a flat crater floor surrounded by cones and fault scarps, the main caldera is affected relatively little by erosion from water.

Most of Kohala&#x27;s summit groundwater ends up in either Waipi&#x27;o or Honokane Nui; the enormous amount of water routed through these valleys results in a large amount of water erosion, which causes the valley walls to frequently collapse, accelerating valley development. This abundance of surface water inspired the first of Kohala&#x27;s three massive irrigation diversion &quot;ditches&quot;, the Upper Hamakua Ditch, although the water was initially used for transporting (&quot;fluming&quot;) sugarcane to the mills rather than irrigation. Surface water supplies, however, were not stable enough for the large scale plantation economy developing in Hamakua and North Kohala, so later ditches tapped the spring fed base flows of the valleys and larger gulches. Only Waimanu Valley escaped with none of its tributaries tapped, along with the 16 smaller streams between Waikoloa Stream and the Wailoa river in Waipi&#x27;o Valley.

==Ecology==
The natural habitats in the Kohala district range across a wide rainfall gradient in a very short distance—from less than a year on the coast near Kawaihae, to more than a year near the summit of Kohala Mountain, a distance of just . At the coast are remnants of dry forests, and near the summit lies a cloud forest, a type of rainforest that obtains much of its moisture from &quot;cloud drip&quot; in addition to precipitation. These large cloud forests dominate its slopes. This biome is rare, and contains a disproportionate percentage of the world&#x27;s rare and endemic species. The soil at Kohala is nitrogen-rich, facilitating root growth.

The forest lies perpendicular to the prevailing trade winds, a characteristic that leads to frequent cloud formation and abundant rainfall. Thus the rain forests carpeting Kohala are vital to the supply of groundwater on the island. The role of Kohala&#x27;s ecosystem in supporting water flow has long been recognized. As early as 1902, US Forester E. M. Griffith wrote &quot;Forest protection means not only increasing the rainfall, but more important still, conserving the water supply. The future welfare and agricultural prosperity of the Hawaiian Islands depends upon the preservation of the forest.&quot;

Before humans arrived, the wildlife population at Kohala and on the rest of the island was isolated from other species, as it was separated from the nearest major landmass by over of open water. The early colonizers of Kohala came by wind, storm or floating on the ocean. Successful colonizations occur on the magnitude of once every 35,000 years. The 2,000 successful ancestors that arrived at Kohala evolved into about 8,500 to 12,500 unique species, resulting in a very high ratio of the species present being found nowhere else on Earth. Only about 2.5% of the world&#x27;s rainforest is cloud rainforest, making it a unique habitat as well.

The mountain supports approximately 155 native species of vertebrates, crustaceans, mollusks, and plants. A diverse complexion of fungi, liverwort, and mosses further add to the variety. In fact, up to a quarter of the plants in the forest are mosses and ferns. These work to capture the water from clouds, in turn providing microhabitats for invertebrates and amphibians, and their predators. Estimates on the water capacity of the forest range from .

The mountain is also home to several bogs, which exist as breaks in the cloud forests. It is believed that bogs form in low-lying areas where clay in the soil prevents proper water drainage, resulting in an accumulation of water that impedes the root systems of woody plants. Kohala&#x27;s bogs are characterized by sedges, mosses of the genus &quot;Sphagnum&quot;, and oha wai, native members of the bellflower family. Other habitats include rain forest and mesophytic (wet) forests.

The same isolation that produced Kohala&#x27;s unique ecosystem also makes it very vulnerable to invasive species. Alien plants and feral animals are among the greatest threats to the local ecology. Plants like the kahili ginger &quot;(Hedychium gardnerianum)&quot; and the strawberry guava &quot;(Psidium cattleinum)&quot; displace native species. Prior to human settlement, many major organisms such as conifers and rodents never made it onto the island, so the ecosystem never developed defenses against them, leaving Hawaii vulnerable to damage by hoofed animals, rodents, and predation.

Kohala&#x27;s native Hawaiian rain forest has a thick layer of ferns and mosses carpeting the floor, which act as sponges, absorbing water from rain and passing much of it through to the groundwater in aquifers below; when feral animals like pigs trample the covering, the forest loses its ability to hold in water effectively, and instead of recharging the aquifer, it results in a severe loss of topsoil, much of which ends up being dumped by streams into the ocean.

==Human history==
There is evidence of pre-modern agriculture on the leeward slopes of Kohala. From 1400 to 1800, the principal crop grown at Kohala was sweet potato &quot;(Ipomoea batatas)&quot;, although there is also evidence of yams &quot;(Dioscorea sp.)&quot;, taro &quot;(Colocasia esculenta)&quot;, bananas &quot;(Musa hybrids)&quot;, sugarcane &quot;(Saccharum officinarum)&quot;, and gourds of the family Cucurbitaceae. The optimal rainfall level for the sweet potato lies between per year. A combination of factors makes the rainfall at Kohala variable both from location to location and from year to year. In addition, Kohala is buffeted by strong winds, which are directly correlated to soil erosion; ancient farmers utilized a series of earthen embarkments and stone walls to protect their crops. This technique has been shown to reduce wind by at least 20–30 percent.

In addition to walls, there are a series of stone paths that divided the farmed area into plots of variable size. These structures are unique because although many people used such systems at the time, Kohala has some of the few to survive. The leeward slopes of Kohala were used for sugarcane plantations in the late 19th century. The trip from the fields to the mills and then boats was mechanized by steam locomotive in 1883. Several plantations on the mountain were consolidated into the Kohala Sugar Company by 1937. At the peak of its production, the company had 600 employees, of land, and a capacity of of raw sugar per year. In 1975 the company finally closed down.
Kohala supports a very complex hydrological cycle. In the early part of the 20th century, this was exploited by building surface irrigational channels designed to capture water at the higher elevations and distribute it to the then-extensive sugarcane industry. In 1905, after 18 months and the loss of 17 lives, the Kohala Ditch, a vast network of flumes and ditches, measuring in length, was completed. It has since come into use by ranches, farms, and homes. A portion of the ditch became a tourist attraction until it was damaged by the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake, centered just southwest of the mountain. The Hawaii County Department of Water Supply relies on streams from Kohala to supply water to the population of the island. With increasing demand, the original surface channels have been supplemented by deep wells designed to channel groundwater for domestic use. In 2003 the &quot;Kohala Watershed Partnership&quot; was formed, a voluntary group of private land owners and state managers, designed to help manage the Kohala watershed and to protect it from threats, most especially invasive species.

Another project to raise awareness of Kohala&#x27;s ecosystem is &quot;The Kohala Center&quot;, an independent, not-for-profit, community-based organization for research and education. It was established as a response to requests by island residents to create an educational and employment opportunity related to Hawaii&#x27;s natural and cultural significance. The center&#x27;s mission is &quot;to respectfully engage the Island of Hawaii as an extraordinary and vibrant research and learning laboratory for humanity.&quot; The land around Kohala is administered as two districts, North Kohala and South Kohala, of the County of Hawaii. The beaches, parks, golf courses, and resorts in South Kohala are called &quot;the Kohala Coast.&quot;

King Kamehameha I, the first King of the unified Hawaiian Islands, was born near Upolu Point, the northern tip of Kohala. The site is within Kohala Historical Sites State Monument. The original Kamehameha Statue stands in front of the community center in Kapaau, and replicas of the statue are found at Aliiōlani Hale in Honolulu, and in Emancipation Hall at the United States Capitol Visitor Center in Washington, D.C.

His young son Laczi is also a violinist, but has chosen to forsake his father&#x27;s playing style and study classical violin at the Academy of Music. Pali wants to marry his niece, Juliska, as a companion in his old age, but she prefers his son, Laczi, and Laczi, in turn, loves her. Pali criticizes Laczi&#x27;s musical talent so much, and Laczi yearns so for Juliska, that he leaves home. Reunited in Paris, father and son reconcile after Countess Irini, an old admirer, convinces Pali not to interfere with the course of Laczi and Juliska&#x27;s relationship.

<text>Overprinting refers to the process of printing one colour on top of another in reprographics. This is closely linked to the reprographic technique of &#x27;trapping&#x27;. Another use of overprinting is to create a rich black (often regarded as a colour that is &quot;blacker than black&quot;) by printing black over another dark colour.

It is also the term used in the production of envelopes customised to order by printing images (such as logos) and texts (such as slogans) on mass-produced machine-made envelopes; the alternative way of producing such envelopes is to print &quot;on the flat&quot; and then cut out the individual shapes and fold them to form the envelopes. However the latter method is generally only economically viable for large print runs offering returns to scale.

Overprinting also refers to the printing of additional information onto self-adhesive labels and product packaging. &quot;Best Before&quot;, &quot;Use By&quot; dates and batch codes are printed in situ onto product
packaging as the items are packed. Generally thermal printers, ink jet printers or laser printers are used.

<text>Tenochtitlán is a municipality in the Mexican state of Veracruz, and the name of the main township which serves as the seat of the municipal government. It is located in the foothills of the Sierra Madre, with the township lying at an altitude of approximately 900 m (2953 ft) above mean sea level.

In the year 2000 census, the municipality reported a total population of slightly over 5600 people. 
The same census also revealed that the municipality had no hotels, no restaurants, no cafeterias, no bars, and no discothèques or night-clubs. 

The town and the municipality are both named after Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire prior to the Spanish conquest.

<text>Andrew Watson Myles (February 18, 1884 – May 9, 1970) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1915 to 1920 as a Liberal, and made an unsuccessful bid for the leadership of the Manitoba Liberal Party in 1927.

Myles was born in Rathwell, Manitoba, and was educated at Manitoba College and Northwestern University in Chicago. He received a D.D.S. degree, and worked as a dentist after 1908. In religion, Myles was a Presbyterian.

On December 13, 1913, Myles ran for the Liberal Party of Canada in a federal by-election in the riding of Macdonald. He lost to Conservative candidate Alex Morrison, 3855 votes to 2939.

Myles became one of several Liberal candidates elected to the provincial legislature in the provincial election of 1915, as premier Tobias Norris led the Liberal Party to a landslide victory of 40 seats out of 47. Myles defeated Conservative incumbent George Steel in Cypress, 851 votes to 789. He did not seek re-election in 1920.

He ran for the leadership of the Manitoba Liberal Party in 1927, but was defeated by Hugh Robson, a respected judge with no prior political experience. He also ran in the provincial election of 1927 in Assiniboia, but finished a distant fourth out of five candidates.

<text>This is a survey of the [[postage stamps]] and [[postal history]] of [[German East Africa]].

German East Africa was a German colony in East Africa, including what is now Burundi, Rwanda and Tanganyika (the mainland part of present Tanzania). It came into existence during the 1880s and ended during World War I, when the area was taken over by the British and Belgians, and later as League of Nations mandate territories.


==German postal agency==
A German postal agency was established on 27 February 1885 in Lamu using German stamps for mail. Following the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty in 1890 Germany created the colony of German East Africa. Initially German stamps were used. The first postage stamps for German East Africa were German stamps surcharged in pesa values in 1893, followed by stamps overprinted &quot;Deutsch-Ostafrika&quot; in 1896. In 1900, Germany issued the &quot;Yachts,&quot; a common design used for all of Germany&#x27;s colonies, featuring the Kaiser&#x27;s yacht &quot;Hohenzollern&quot;. In German East Africa they were denominated in pesas and rupees (64 pesas to a rupee), and inscribed &quot;DEUTSCH-OSTAFRIKA&quot;. In 1905 new stamps were denominated in &quot;hellers,&quot; 100 hellers to a rupee. Germany continued to print stamps during the war, issuing a 1-rupee watermarked Yacht in 1916 (genuine uses of this stamp are extremely rare, worth US$20,000 or more).

== Occupation ==

After the colony was occupied by Belgian and British troops, each issued its own provisional stamps. In 1916, the Belgians overprinted stamps of Belgian Congo in several ways, first with &quot;RUANDA&quot; and &quot;URUNDI,&quot; although these were never actually used. A second series was overprinted with the dual-language &quot;EST AFRICAIN ALLEMAND / OCCUPATION BELGE / DUITSCH OOST AFRIKA / BELGISCHE BEZETTING.&quot; In 1922 these stamps received surcharges ranging from 5c to 50c.
In 1916, at the request of Brigadier General Edward Northey, to the Governor of Nyasaland, Nyasaland stamps were overprinted &quot;N.F.&quot;. The overprint was intended to be &quot;N.F.F.&quot;, for &quot;Nyasaland Field Force&quot;, but the telegraph operator omitted one “F.” when sending the request to the Governor. The stamps could only be used by troops of the Nyasaland Rhodesian Field Force. Although they were primarily intended for use in German East Africa, they were also used from field post offices in Nyasaland and Mozambique. They were not issued to any civilian post office nor could they be used by any civilians.
The civilian population were able to send mail through the Indian Army postal service field post offices using Indian Expeditionary Forces stamps (Indian stamps overprinted &quot;I.E.F.&quot;). When civilian post offices were opened in 1917, stamps of East Africa and Uganda Protectorates were issued overprinted with &quot;G.E.A.&quot;. The same overprint on stamps of East Africa and Uganda Protectorates issued in 1921 after the establishment of Tanganyika are considered part of Tanganyika&#x27;s postal history.
=== Mafia Island ===
On January 12, 1915, Mafia was taken by British troops as a base for the air and sea assault on the light cruiser &quot;Königsberg&quot;. Stamps were issued by the British occupation forces on the island of Mafia in 1915 and 1916.

<doc id="891854" wikidata="Q2268227" url="?curid=891854" title="Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry">
<text>Charles William Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry, (born Charles William Stewart; 1778–1854), was an Anglo-Irish nobleman, a British soldier and a politician. He served in the French Revolutionary Wars, in the suppression of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and in the Napoleonic wars. He excelled as a cavalry commander in the Peninsular War (1807–1814) under John Moore and Arthur Wellesley (became Wellington in 1809).

On resigning from his post under Wellington in 1812, his half-brother Lord Castlereagh helped him to launch a diplomatic career. He was posted to Berlin in 1813, and then as ambassador to Austria, where his half-brother was the British plenipotentiary at the Congress of Vienna.

He married Lady Catherine Bligh in 1804 and then, in 1819, Lady Frances Anne Vane, a rich heiress, changing his surname to hers, thus becoming Charles Vane instead of Charles Stewart. In 1822 he succeeded his half-brother as 3rd Marquess of Londonderry, inheriting estates in the north of Ireland where, as an unyielding landlord, his reputation suffered in the Great Famine. It was a reputation he matched as a coal operator on his wife&#x27;s land in County Durham. In opposition to the Mines and Collieries Act 1842, he insisted on his right to use child labour.

== Birth and origins ==
Charles was born on 18 May 1778 in Dublin as the second son of Robert Stewart and the first son by his second wife Frances Pratt. His father&#x27;s family was Ulster-Scots and Presbyterian. His father was then a wealthy member of the Irish landed gentry but would later be created a Marquess.

Charles&#x27;s mother was English, a daughter of Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden, a leading English jurist. His parents had married on 7 June 1775. Charles was brought up as an Anglican, a member of the Church of Ireland.

Charles had a half-brother from his father&#x27;s first marriage who played an important role in his life:
* Robert (1769–1822), known as &quot;Lord Castlereagh&quot;, who achieved prominence as Foreign Secretary

In addition Charles had 11 full siblings, who are listed in his father&#x27;s article.








== Early life and parliamentary career ==
In 1789, when he was 11, his father, Robert Stewart, was created Baron Londonderry.

On 3 April 1791, at the age of 12, Charles Stewart entered the British Army as an ensign in the 108th Regiment. He was commissioned a lieutenant on 8 January 1793 in this same unit. He saw service in 1794 in the Flanders Campaign of the French Revolutionary Wars, and on the Rhine and Danube in 1795.

He was lieutenant-colonel of the 5th Royal Irish Dragoons by the time he helped put down the Irish Rebellion of 1798. In 1803, Stewart was appointed &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to King George III.

In 1795 his father was created Viscount Castlereagh and in 1796 Marquess of Londonderry in the Irish peerage.

In 1800, Charles Stewart was elected in the Tory interest to the Irish House of Commons as member of parliament for Thomastown borough, County Kilkenny, in place of George Dunbar, and after only two months exchanged this seat for that of County Londonderry, being replaced at Thomastown by John Cradock. After the abolition of the Irish Parliament with the Act of Union in 1801, In July and August 1802 Stewart was re-elected for the country in the first general election of the United Kingdom and sat until the parliament&#x27;s dissolution in 1806. He was reelected again in 1806, in 1807, after which he became Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, and again in 1812. In July 1814 he was summoned to the House of Lords and replaced as MP for Londonderry by his uncle Alexander Stewart of Ards.

== First marriage and son ==
On 8 August 1804 at the church of St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, London, Charles Stewart married Lady Catherine Bligh. She was the 4th and youngest daughter of the 3rd Earl of Darnley. She was three years older than he. On 7 July 1805 the couple had a son, named Frederick, who was to become the 4th Marquess of Londonderry. She died during the night of 10–11 February 1812, of fever following a minor operation, while her husband was on his way home from Spain.
Son by Catherine Bligh:
# Frederick William Robert Stewart, 4th Marquess of Londonderry (1805–1872)

== Peninsular War ==
The remainder of his military career developed during the Napoleonic Wars, more exactly in the Peninsular War.

=== Corunna ===
The war started with the Corunna Campaign (1808–1809), in which the British troops were commanded by Sir John Moore. In this campaign Charles Stewart commanded a brigade of cavalry, and played, together with Lord Paget, a prominent role in the cavalry clash of Benavente where the French General Lefebvre-Desnouettes was taken prisoner. He suffered from ophthalmia during the latter stages of the retreat. Moore sent him back to London carrying dispatches for Castlereagh and other leading figures and he missed the climactic battle where British forces successfully managed to evacuate in the face of Marshal Soult&#x27;s army at which Moore was killed in action.

=== Wellesley&#x27;s Spanish campaign ===
When British troops returned to the Iberian Peninsula after the Corunna Campaign, they were commanded by Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington). Charles Stewart was appointed, in April 1809, Adjutant General to Wellesley. This was an administrative job and not much to his liking, especially as Wellesley never discussed his decisions with subordinates. Nevertheless, he sometimes managed to see action and distinguished himself, for example spontaneously leading a squadron cavalry charge at the Second Battle of Porto (May 1809), and further distinguishing himself at the battle of Talavera (July 1809), for which he received the thanks of the Parliament on 2 February 1810, when he returned to England due to illness. He also excelled at Bussaco in September 1810 and at Fuentes de Oñoro (May 1811) where he took a French Colonel prisoner in single combat.

He resigned his position as Adjutant General in February 1812. Some say due to bad health, but others say that Wellington fired him. Wellington apparently appreciated him as a soldier but judged him a &quot;sad brouillon and mischief-maker&quot; among his staff.

On 30 January 1813 he became a Knight Companion of the Bath, which made him Sir Charles Stewart. On 20 November 1813, he was made Colonel of the 25th Light Dragoons, an honorary position.

== Diplomatic career ==
His half-brother Robert had made a brilliant diplomatic and political career. Charles and his half-brother remained lifelong friends and wrote each other many letters. Robert helped Charles to start a diplomatic career.

=== Berlin ===
From May 1813 until the end of the war, Sir Charles was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Berlin, and was also Military Commissioner with the allied armies, being wounded at the Battle of Kulm in August 1813.

=== Vienna ===
In 1814 he was also appointed Ambassador to Austria, a post he held for nine years (1814–1823). On 18 June 1814, to make him more acceptable in Vienna, Stewart was ennobled as Baron Stewart, of Stewart&#x27;s Court and Ballylawn in County Donegal, by the Prince Regent. In the same year, he received honorary degrees from Oxford and Cambridge, was admitted to the Privy Council, and was appointed a Lord of the Bedchamber to the king.

Lord Stewart, as he now was, attended the Congress of Vienna with his half-brother Lord Castlereagh as one of the British plenipotentiaries. He was not well regarded as he made a spectacle of himself with his loutish behaviour, was apparently rather often inebriated, and frequented prostitutes quite openly. He earned himself the sobriquet of Lord Pumpernickel after a loutish character in a play in fashion.

In the following years he also served as British observer at the congresses of Troppau, Laibach and Verona. As the great powers were taking an increasingly reactionary approach, the British government sent Lord Stewart to observe, but not participate in the decisions.

=== Second marriage and children ===
Before the end of his diplomatic career Lord Stewart had, on 3 April 1819, married his second wife, Lady Frances Anne Vane-Tempest, daughter and heiress of Sir Henry Vane-Tempest, at her mother&#x27;s house in Bruton Street, Mayfair, and took her surname of Vane, by Royal licence, as had been stipulated in her father&#x27;s will. He was henceforth known as Charles William Vane, whereas his son out of his first marriage stayed Frederick Stewart.
Children by Frances Anne Emily Vane-Tempest:
# George Henry Robert Charles William Vane-Tempest, 5th Marquess of Londonderry (1821–1884)
# Lady Frances Anne Emily Vane (1822–1899); married John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough.
# Lady Alexandrina Octavia Maria Vane (1823–1874), godchild of Alexander I of Russia; married Henry Dawson-Damer, 3rd Earl of Portarlington.
# Lord Adolphus Frederick Charles William Vane-Tempest (1825–1864), politician; became insane, and had to be medically restrained.
# Lady Adelaide Emelina Caroline Vane (c. 1830–1882); disgraced the family by eloping with her brother&#x27;s tutor, Rev. Frederick Henry Law.
# Lord Ernest McDonnell Vane-Tempest (1836–1885), fell in with a press-gang and had to be bought a commission in the army, from which he was subsequently cashiered.

Through his daughter Lady Frances, Lord Londonderry is the maternal grandfather of Lord Randolph Churchill, and consequently a great-grandfather of Winston Churchill.

=== Castlereagh&#x27;s suicide ===

On 12 August 1822, his half-brother committed suicide. He succeeded his half-brother as 3rd Marquess of Londonderry in 1822. The following year Lord Londonderry was also created Earl Vane and Viscount Seaham, of Seaham in the County Palatine of Durham, with remainder to the heirs male of the body of his second wife.

His half-brother&#x27;s death also meant the end of his diplomatic career. He quit the diplomatic service in 1823. Queen Victoria had a low esteem of Londonderry&#x27;s abilities as a civil servant. She said that he should, in her opinion, not be given any post of importance.

=== Residences ===
Lord Londonderry used his new bride&#x27;s immense wealth to acquire the Seaham Hall estate in County Durham, developing the coalfields there. He also built the harbour at Seaham, to rival nearby Sunderland. He commissioned Benjamin Wyatt to build a mansion at Wynyard Park. It was completed by Philip Wyatt in 1841 and cost £130,000 (equivalent to £10,772,000 in 2016) to build and furnish. Unfortunately, just as the mansion was being completed, a fire broke out and gutted the house; it was later restored and remodelled by Ignatius Bonomi.

The family also used their newfound wealth to redecorate their country seat in Ireland, Mount Stewart, and bought Holdernesse House on London&#x27;s Park Lane, which they renamed Londonderry House.

== Declines Orange invitation ==
In 1836 the Orange Order was accused of plotting to place Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Imperial Grand Master of the Orange Order, on the throne in place of Victoria when his brother King William IV died. Once the plot was revealed, the House of Commons called upon the King to disband the Order. Under pressure from Joseph Hume, William Molesworth and Lord John Russell, the King indicated measures would have to be taken and the Duke of Cumberland was forced to dissolve the Orange lodges.

Hume laid evidence before the House of Commons that the plotters had approached Londonderry. In July 1832, the Marquess had received a letter from Lieutenant-Colonel W. B. Fairman, the Deputy Grand Secretary of the Orange Institution of Great Britain, advising him that following &quot;a death of importance&quot; (the passing of the King) the Orangemen would abandon their policy of &quot;non-resistance&quot; to the present &quot;Popish Cabinet, and democratical Ministry&quot; (the parliamentary reform ministry of Earl Grey) and that &quot;it might be political&quot; for the Marquess to join them. Noting that there were already Orange lodges in Newcastle, South Shields, and Darlington, Fairman also suggested to Londonderry that to assume the role in Durham of County Grand Master might be advantageous to him &quot;in a personal sense&quot;: his &quot;pitmen&quot; (the miners employed in his collieries) might be induced to organise lodges among themselves which would &quot;prove a partial check against their entering into cabals [i.e. trade unions] hereafter&quot;.

While he conceded that he wished the government should do more to check &quot;the baneful influence of the Liberal and Radical associations&quot;, including trade unions, Londonderry went to some length in the House of Lords to deny any possible connection between himself and &quot;the alleged project for altering the succession to the throne&quot;. To Fairman he had replied: &quot;the present state of liberal Whig feeling in this very Whig county, and the very refractory and insubordinate state of the pitmen, entirely preclude the possibility of successful efforts at this juncture&quot;. He had also spoken with Lord Kenyon (his then house guest, who had led opposition to Catholic Emancipation) and had &quot;no doubt&quot; he would &quot;convince his Royal Highness&quot; (the Duke of Cumberland), as well as Fairman, &quot;that the present moment is not the time when the object can be forwarded.&quot;

== Industrialist and landlord ==
=== Mines and Collieries Act ===

Londonderry led the opposition to the Mines and Collieries Act of 1842 in the House of Lords. He is reported to have raged furiously against any attempt to deny the collieries the use of child labour. Speaking on behalf of the Yorkshire Coal-Owners Association, Londonderry said &quot;With respect to the age at which males should be admitted into mines, the members of this association have unanimously agreed to fix it at eight years... In the thin coal mines it is more especially requisite that boys, varying in age from eight to fourteen, should be employed; as the underground roads could not be made of sufficient height for taller persons without incurring an outlay so great as to render the working of such mines unprofitable&quot;.

=== Irish famine ===

By the time of the outbreak of the Great Irish Famine in 1845, Londonderry was one of the ten richest men in the United Kingdom. While many landlords made efforts to mitigate the worst effects of the famine on their tenants, Londonderry was criticised for meanness: he and his wife gave only £30 to the local relief committee but spent £15,000 renovating Mount Stewart, their Irish home.

In contrast to his neighbour, the Marquess of Downshire, he rejected rent reductions (for which he was excoriated by James MacKnight in the Presbyterian weekly, the &quot;Banner of Ulster&quot;). Invoking the admonitions of the Prime Minister Lord Russell and of his predecessor Sir Robert Peel, he advised his tenants &quot;to help themselves and heaven will help them&quot;: only the most &quot;supine and inert&quot; among them could be &quot;suffering in any serious degree under the failure of the potato&quot;.

During the tenant right campaign of the early 1850s, Londonderry insisted on his full rights and this alienated many of his tenants. He was in disagreement over this question with his eldest son and heir Frederick, who was more liberally inclined.

=== Napoleon and Abd-el-Kader ===
Back in England, Londonderry befriended Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (later Napoleon III) while the latter was exiled in London between 1836 and 1840. After Bonaparte had been elected president of France in 1851, Londonderry asked him to free Abd-el-Kader.

=== Late honours ===
Governor of County Londonderry from 1823, Londonderry was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Durham in 1842 and the following year became Colonel of the 2nd Regiment of Life Guards. When Wellington, whom he admired greatly, died in 1852, his place as Knight of the Garter was given to Londonderry, who was officially invested on 19 June 1853.

== Death, memorials, and succession ==
He died on 6 March 1854 at Londonderry House and was buried in Longnewton, County Durham. His widow honoured him by the Londonderry Equestrian Statue in Durham.

Frederick built Scrabo Tower near Newtownards as a monument to the memory of his father. Of the 730 subscribers to the cost, just 450 were connected to the Stewart estate on which there were 1,200 tenants farmers and many associated employees (in 1850, organised in the all-Ireland Tenant Right League, 700 of these tenants had signed an address demanding tenant right and lower rents). Two-thirds of the cost of the tower was met by 98 subscribers (in a list headed by Emperor Napoleon III) most of whom were fellow gentry.*

He was succeeded as Marquess of Londonderry by his eldest son, Frederick Stewart, the only child from his first marriage, and as Earl Vane by George Vane, the eldest son from his second marriage. At Charles&#x27;s death Frederick, therefore, became the 4th Marquess of Londonderry, whereas George became the 2nd Earl Vane. George was later to become the 5th Marquess after his half-brother had died childless.


=== Styles ===
Charles was styled:
# The Honourable Charles Stewart from 1789 until 1813 (because his father was created Baron Londonderry in 1789), 
# The Honourable Sir Charles Stewart from 1813 to 1814 (because he was made a Knight of the Bath), 
# The Right Honourable The Lord Stewart from 1814 to 1822 (because he was made a baron in his own right)
# The Most Honourable The Marquess of Londonderry.

== Works ==
The 3rd Marquess was a prolific writer and editor. He wrote books about his own military and diplomatic career and published many of his half-brother&#x27;s papers.

=== War memoirs ===
The following two books describe the Napoleonic War as he saw them happen. The first describes his experience of the Peninsular War. The second the War of the Sixth Coalition, which forced Napoleon to abdicate:
* &quot;Narrative of the Peninsular War&quot; (London: Henry Colburn, 1828) online at Internet Archive
* &quot;Narrative of the War in Germany and France: In 1813 and 1814&quot; (London: Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley, 1830) online at Internet Archive

=== Castlereagh papers ===
The 3rd Marquess also compiled, edited, and published many of the papers left by his half-brother and published them in the following twelve volumes, divided in three series.

The first series, consisting of four volumes, numbered 1 – 4, appeared in 1848 and 1849 under the title &quot;Memoirs and Correspondence&quot;. The volumes are not marked &quot;first series on the title pages. They are:
* &quot;Memoirs and Correspondence of Viscount Castlereagh, Second Marquess of Londonderry&quot;, Volume 1 (London: Henry Colburn, 1848) online at Internet Archive - The Irish Rebellion
* &quot;Memoirs and Correspondence of Viscount Castlereagh, Second Marquess of Londonderry&quot;, Volume 2 (London: Henry Colburn, 1848) online at Internet Archive - Arrangements for a Union
* &quot;Memoirs and Correspondence of Viscount Castlereagh, Second Marquess of Londonderry&quot;, Volume 3 (London: Henry Colburn, 1849) online at Internet Archive - Completion of the Legislative Union 
* &quot;Memoirs and Correspondence of Viscount Castlereagh, Second Marquess of Londonderry&quot;, Volume 4 (London, Henry Colburn, 1849) online at Internet Archive - Concessions to Catholics and Dissenters: Emmett&#x27;s Insurrection

The second series, consisting of four volumes, appeared in 1851 under the title &quot;Correspondence, Despatches and Other Papers&quot;. The volume numbers continue, despite being marked &quot;2nd series&quot; and are therefore 4 to 8. They are:
* &quot;Correspondence Despatches and Other Papers of Viscount Castlereagh, Second Marquess of Londonderry&quot;, Series 2, Volume 5 (London: William Shoberl, 1851) online at Internet Archive - Military and Miscellaneous
* &quot;Correspondence Despatches and Other Papers of Viscount Castlereagh, Second Marquess of Londonderry&quot;, Series 2, Volume 6 (London: William Shoberl, 1851) online at Internet Archive - Military and Miscellaneous
* &quot;Correspondence Despatches and Other Papers of Viscount Castlereagh, Second Marquess of Londonderry&quot;, Series 2, Volume 7 (London: William Shoberl, 1851) online at Internet Archive - Military and Miscellaneous
* &quot;Correspondence Despatches and Other Papers of Viscount Castlereagh, Second Marquess of Londonderry&quot;, Series 2, Volume 8 (London: William Shoberl, 1851) online at Internet Archive - Military and Miscellaneous

The third series appeared in 1853. The four volumes have the same title as the second series. The volume numbering is irregular. They are:
* &quot;Correspondence Despatches and Other Papers of Viscount Castlereagh, Second Marquess of Londonderry&quot;, Volume 9 (London: John Murray, 1853) online at Internet Archive - Military and Diplomatic
* &quot;Correspondence Despatches and Other Papers of Viscount Castlereagh, Second Marquess of Londonderry&quot;, Volume 11 (London: John Murray, 1853) online at Hathi Trust

<text>Christopher Newport University (CNU) is a public university in Newport News, Virginia, United States. It was founded in 1960 as Christopher Newport College, an extension school of the College of William and Mary for mid-career working professionals, members of the military, and non-traditional students in and around the Newport News area of the Hampton Roads region. The university has since expanded into a residential college for traditional students. 

It is named after Christopher Newport, captain of one of the ships which carried settlers of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America. 

==History==
In 1960, the city of Newport News joined with the Commonwealth of Virginia to create Christopher Newport College (CNC), which opened its doors in 1961 and at the time was located in the old John W. Daniel School building. The college was founded as an extension of the College of William &amp; Mary and offered extension courses that had already been available in the area for some time.

In 1964, the college was moved to its current location, a tract of land seized by the city via eminent domain. That same year, the college&#x27;s first permanent building was dedicated as Christopher Newport Hall.

The site chosen was very controversial. Since at least the early 1900s, it had been home to an African-American community that had, over time, prospered and grown more middle-class. In the 1950s and 1960s, white city leaders used eminent domain to seize stable Black neighborhoods for whites-only schools three times. As a local Black surgeon wrote to the local &quot;Daily Press&quot; newspaper: &quot;Does it not seem more than coincidental that, with the hundreds of undeveloped acres in the city, the sites recently chosen by the city for condemnation are sites owned by Negroes?&quot;

The future site of CNC, known as Shoe Lane, was located adjacent to the whites-only James River Country Club, whose members included much of the city&#x27;s powerful elite. At a council hearing on the proposed site, civil rights attorney W. Hale Thompson testified that the city&#x27;s goal &quot;was to eliminate the possibility of Negroes building homes in that area.&quot; University president Anthony Santoro later called the choice of the site an &quot;egregious wrong&quot; and said &quot;the city has to own up to the fact that this was a deliberate attempt to get rid of a Black community, because there were many places that the school could have been built.&quot;

Originally, CNC was treated as an off-site department of William &amp; Mary, and its chief executive was called a director. By 1970, the title had been changed to president. In 1971, CNC became a four-year college; however, it remained an extension of William &amp; Mary until 1977 when it became an autonomous four-year institution. In 1992, CNC was granted university status under the leadership of its fourth president, Anthony R. Santoro, who oversaw the building of the first residence hall. In 1996, CNU made plans to become more competitive. Those plans included the expansion of university property, several new buildings, and residence halls, as well as overhauling academic programs and the admission process.

==Academics==
===Admissions===
In 2022, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; found that Christopher Newport University admissions were &quot;selective&quot; with an acceptance rate of 89%. For over a decade, the university has not required submission of SAT, ACT or CLT scores, but for the many students who still chose to submit scores, the middle 50% of applicants admitted had an SAT score between 1110 and 1320 or an ACT score between 25 and 29. There are minimum GPA and rank-in-class requirements for test-optional consideration, but the university uses a holistic review process in admissions that takes many other factors into consideration.

===Rankings===
For 2023–2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Christopher Newport University among 136 Regional Universities in the South to be #7 overall, #43 for Best Value, #13 for Best Undergraduate Teaching, #109 in Top Performers on Social Mobility, and #3 in Top Public Schools.

==Athletics==
CNU participates mainly in the NCAA Division III Coast to Coast Athletic Conference (C2C, which was known as the Capital Athletic Conference before November 2020), having moved from the USA South Athletic Conference in July 2013. Their athletic teams are known as the Captains. The football team participates in the New Jersey Athletic Conference (NJAC) due to the C2C not sponsoring football. CNU fields a wide variety of college level teams on the Division III level. The Freeman Center houses the basketball, volleyball, and indoor track teams, while the lacrosse, soccer, baseball, softball, and field hockey teams play at a complex called &quot;Captain&#x27;s Field.&quot; The football and outdoor track teams compete at TowneBank Stadium. Ratcliffe Hall was expanded in 2012 and now includes various athletic offices as well as the varsity gym. A sailing center is also located close to the campus along the James River.

Christopher Newport University&#x27;s athletics have achieved notable milestones. The women&#x27;s soccer program made history by clinching the school&#x27;s first-ever NCAA Division III national championship on December 12, 2021. Following suit, the softball program secured their own NCAA Division III national championship on May 31, 2022.

==Campus==
===Residence halls===
Residence halls on campus are usually segregated into the class of student living in them. In the recent years, new policies have been enacted that require all freshman and sophomore students to live in an on campus housing facility, unless they live in the commuting zone. Starting with the class of 2014, all students must live on campus during the junior year in addition to their freshman and sophomore years.

=== David Student Union===
The David Student Union (DSU) is a $36 million, facility whose construction began in 2003 and opened September 9, 2006. Constructed in a &quot;Neo-Georgian&quot; architectural style, the first floor contains the campus Convenience Store, parallel the DSU dining facilities: The Discovery Bistro, Discovery Cafe, Chick-fil-A, Discovery Pizza, and Regatta&#x27;s. The campus Bookstore and Convenience Store closed during the Fall 2010 semester in favor of an online bookstore and instead contains a student lounge, admissions office, and apparel store. All on-campus students receive a mailbox and access to a full-service Post Office located on the second floor of the DSU. Four large conference rooms named for past U.S. Presidents are located around a central lobby area at the top of the steps. The Ballroom is also located on the second floor. The building provides offices for Student Life, The Captain&#x27;s Log, Auxiliary Services, Study Abroad, and others. Private desks with computers are provided for students as well as quiet study sections and recreational areas. The building was named in honor of William R. and Goldie R. David.

===Academic buildings===
For the opening of the Spring 2010 semester, Christopher Newport University opened the Lewis Archer McMurran Jr. Hall. This building has neo-Georgian architecture. The building is 85,000 square feet and frames the university&#x27;s Great Lawn on its western side. McMurran Hall houses the Departments of Modern and Classical Languages and Literatures, History, English, and Government. It has a 150-person lecture hall, two 50-person lecture halls, and over 25 other classrooms.

To the north of McMurran Hall is Ratcliffe Hall, the former home of the Departments of English and Government. Once CNU&#x27;s gymnasium, the building was renovated to include classroom and office space for students and faculty. Other academic buildings on campus include Gosnold Hall, Forbes Hall, and the Business and Technology Center (BTC Building), located across Prince Drew Lane. The Ferguson Center for the Arts is home to the Departments of Music and Theater &amp; Dance. The most recent addition to the academic buildings is the Mary M. Torggler Fine Arts Center, which became home to the Department of Fine Art and Art History upon its opening in 2021.

Wingfield Hall, the former home of the Departments of Psychology and Language, was demolished in 2011 to make way for the Joseph W. Luter Hall, home of the school of business.

The Joseph W. Luter III Hall is the house of the Luter School of Business. The building, following the Neo-Georgian architecture of surrounding new structures, has a new 100-seat tiered lecture hall, 14 traditional classrooms, teachings labs, research labs and faculty offices.

The Mary Brock Forbes Integrated Science Building is a academic hall situated on the north edge of the great lawn, and houses the College of Natural and Behavioral Science as well as the Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science and Psychology departments. It also includes spaces for students to interact, 50 faculty offices, a large lecture hall, 50 classrooms, and research labs.

=== Paul and Rosemary Trible Library===
The university&#x27;s library, renamed for Rosemary and Paul S. Trible Jr., had a multimillion-dollar addition completed in early 2008. The new 
 facility houses most of its collection in the original section. The new library was dedicated January 24, 2008, and fully opened at the start of the Spring 2008 semester. The Trible Library boasts a new Einstein&#x27;s Cafe, a 24-hour study lounge, and an IT help desk.

In early 2009, the Mariners&#x27; Museum Library relocated to the Trible Library, providing students and the community with convenient access to the largest maritime history collection in the Western Hemisphere. The Paul and Rosemary Trible Library expanded beginning in 2016 to add another floor to the back portion of the facility. Due to the renovations, the Mariners&#x27; Museum Library moved back to the Mariners&#x27; Museum and reopened in Fall 2017.

In August 2018, the library expansion opened adding 3 floors of new space. Additions included a 100-seat theater, expanded Media Center, a two-story reading room, and 44 group study rooms.

===Ferguson Center for the Arts===
In 1996 the university acquired the Ferguson High School building and property, which was adjacent to campus. This building was used for classrooms until it was extensively renovated to become the Ferguson Center for the Arts, which opened in fall of 2005. Many features of the original high school, which was located between what is now the concert hall and the music and theatre hall, can still be seen throughout the current building. It houses a 1,725-seat concert hall which is acoustically engineered so that anyone on stage can be heard from any seat without a microphone, A 453-seat music and theatre hall, and a 200-seat studio theatre. It also contains two art galleries, a dance studio, and several classrooms.

=== Mary M. Torggler Fine Arts Center ===
First open in fall 2021, the Mary M. Torggler Fine Arts Center serves not only as Christopher Newport University&#x27;s Department of Fine Art and Art History academic building, but also as a fine arts center for the surrounding area of Hampton Roads, Virginia. According to their website, the Torggler Center, &quot;seeks to enrich the cultural landscape of the commonwealth of Virginia by presenting exceptional visual arts programming that empowers creative expression, critical thinking, lifelong learning and cultural dialogue&quot;. The Torggler Center hosts rotating exhibitions, community classes, university classes, and alumni centered galleries. 

===Pope Chapel===
Opened in early 2013, the Pope Chapel, named for Larry Pope of Smithfield Foods, is a gathering place for various on campus religious organizations located at the campus entrance across from York River Hall and the Trible Library.

===Christopher Newport Hall===
In the fall of 2015 a new administration building was opened and named Christopher Newport Hall. The structure houses the Office of Admission, Office of the Registrar, Financial Aid, Housing, the Center for Academic Success, the President&#x27;s Leadership Program and the Center for Career Planning, among others. The $42 million facility serves as a new landmark on campus and is at the head of the Great Lawn opposite Lewis Archer McMurran Jr. Hall. In May 2015, towards the end of construction, Newport Hall served as the backdrop for commencement ceremonies.

<text>Herman Davis (January 3, 1888 – January 5, 1923) was a decorated American sniper of World War I. He was a United States Infantry Private Company I, 113th Infantry Regiment, 29th Division.

Born in Manila, Arkansas, Davis was drafted into the Army in March 1918. On October 10, 1918, he achieved distinction by killing four German machine gunners, using a standard-issue 1903 Springfield with open sights, near Verdun during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The gunners had pinned his platoon down, and his actions secured safety to advance for the platoon. In another instance, Davis shot and killed five enemy crew members that were setting up a machine gun 1,000 yards away in an area they thought was out of range of American troops. Being told the distance was too great, he said, &quot;Why, that is just a good shootin&#x27; distance.&quot; His marksmanship was attributed to the skill he had developed as a youngster hunting small game in the Big Lake area.

General Pershing named Davis fourth among the 100 greatest heroes of World War I. He received the Distinguished Service Cross, the Croix de Guerre with palm, the Croix de Guerre with Gilt Star, and the Médaille Militaire awards from the American and French governments. Davis was honorably discharged from the Army on May 29, 1919. After the war, he returned home and died four years later, on January 5, 1923, during an operation related to tuberculosis that he possibly contracted from exposure to poison gas during the war.

Herman Davis State Park, in his hometown of Manila, a monument located in the park and a street in Manila, honors him. Other streets in Davis&#x27; hometown of Manila are named after another military honoree, Admiral George Perry.

<text>William Burnett Benton (April 1, 1900 – March 18, 1973) was an American senator from Connecticut (1949–1953) and publisher of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (1943–1973).

==Early life==

Benton was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was educated at Shattuck Military Academy, Faribault, Minnesota, and Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota until 1918, at which point he matriculated at Yale University, where he contributed to campus humor magazine &quot;The Yale Record&quot; and was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity.

==Advertising and civic life==

He graduated in 1921 and began work for advertising agencies in New York City and Chicago until 1929, after which he co-founded Benton &amp; Bowles with Chester Bowles in New York. He moved to Norwalk, Connecticut in 1932, and served as the part-time vice president of the University of Chicago from 1937 to 1945. In 1944, he had entered into unsuccessful negotiations with Walt Disney to make six to twelve educational films annually.

==Public and elected office life==

He was appointed Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs and held the position from August 31, 1945 to September 30, 1947, during which time he was active in organizing the United Nations. He was appointed to the United States Senate on 17 December 1949 by his old partner Chester Bowles (who had been elected Governor in 1948), and subsequently elected in the general election on 7 November 1950 as a Democrat to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Raymond E. Baldwin in December 1949 for the remainder of the term ending 3 January 1953.

In the November 1950 election, he defeated Republican party candidate Prescott Sheldon Bush, father of U.S. President George Herbert Walker Bush and grandfather of U.S. President George W. Bush. In 1951 he introduced a resolution to expel Joseph McCarthy from the Senate. Benton provided 30,000 words of testimony on Sept. 28, 1951 in support of Senate Resolution 187. Due to Benton&#x27;s resolution and McCarthy&#x27;s response, the Senate Rules committee investigated and criticized both of them but punished neither.

On television, when asked if he would take any action against Benton&#x27;s reelection bid, McCarthy replied, &quot;I think it will be unnecessary. Little Willie Benton, Connecticut&#x27;s mental midget keeps on... it will be unnecessary for me or anyone else to do any campaigning against him. He&#x27;s doing his campaigning against himself.&quot; Benton lost in the general election for the full term in 1952 to William A. Purtell. Benton&#x27;s comeback bid failed in 1958 when, running against Bowles and Thomas Dodd he failed to win the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate. He was later appointed United States Ambassador to UNESCO in Paris and served from 1963 to 1968.

Benton served on the board of trustees of the University of Connecticut from 1957 to 1972. Converted to a museum in 1966, the William Benton Museum of Art on the university&#x27;s main campus in Storrs was named in his honor in 1972. Benton had donated his personal collection of works by Reginald Marsh to the museum.

==Encyclopædia Britannica and further civic life==

For much of his life, from 1943 to his death in 1973, he was chairman of the board and publisher of the Encyclopædia Britannica, was a member of and delegate to numerous United Nations and international conferences and commissions, and trustee of several schools and colleges. In 1943 Benton asked Mortimer J. Adler and Robert Hutchins to edit a set of great books to be published by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.; the 52-volume set of &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot; was published in 1952.

Benton established the Benton Foundation. The William Benton Museum of Art is named in his honor.

He died in New York City on March 18, 1973, aged 72, and was survived by his widow, Helen Hemingway Benton, who died in 1974.

<doc id="891867" wikidata="Q4204951" url="?curid=891867" title="Postage stamps and postal history of Madeira">
<text>On 1 January 1868, Portugal issued postage stamps for the islands of Madeira, consisting of the current stamps of Portugal overprinted &quot;MADEIRA&quot;. Subsequent stamps were also overprinted, through 1881.

Unoverprinted Portuguese stamps were used from 1881 to 1892. From 1892 to 1905, while the administrative title of Madeira was changed to the District of Funchal, definitive stamps were issued with the inscription &quot;Funchal&quot;. 

In 1898 a series of stamps commemorating Vasco da Gama was issued with the inscription &quot;Madeira&quot;. Subsequently Madeira used stamps of Portugal from 1905, with two exceptions; the first was the Pombal Issue of postal tax stamps in 1925, and a variant on the Ceres design, issued 1 May 1928.
The 21 values of Ceres stamps were obligatory on all mail for eight days – 1 May, 5 June, 1 July, and 31 December 1928, and 1 January, 31 January, 1 May, and 5 June 1929. The funds raised went to help build a museum.

The Ceres stamps were the last to be produced for Madeira until 1980, when Portugal began issuing stamps inscribed &quot;Portugal Madeira&quot; that were valid in both Madeira and continental Portugal, similar to those issued for the Azores.

==Funchal==
Postage stamps for Funchal inscribed with the city&#x27;s name were issued for use in the archipelago of Madeira from 1892 to 1905 by the postal authorities of Portugal. During this time Madeira was administratively referred to as the District of Funchal. From 1868 to 1881 Madeira had used overprinted stamps of Portugal.

Beginning in 1868, postage stamps for Madeira were issued for the postal needs of the island group with its capital Funchal. Unoverprinted Portuguese stamps were used from 1881 to 1892. From 1892 to 1905, while the administrative title of Madeira was changed to the District of Funchal, definitive stamps were issued with the inscription &quot;Funchal&quot;. These were valid all over the island. While in 1898 a series of stamps commemorating Vasco da Gama was issued with the inscription &quot;Madeira&quot;, unoverprinted stamps of Portugal were used in the archipelago again from 1905.

===Issues===
The first series of eight stamps inscribed &quot;Funchal&quot; was produced in 1892. The typographed stamps, engraved by Manuel Diogo Neto, had face values ranging from 5 reis to 80 reis. Four more stamps with higher face values from 100 reis to 300 reis were issued in the following year, as well as a 5 reis stamp. In 1896 the 100 reis stamp was officially bisected in order to frank newspaper wrappers and letters.
A new series of stamps, engraved by Louis-Eugène Mouchon, was issued in 1897 and supplemented by additional values in 1898, 1899 and 1905. It comprised 19 nominals ranging from 2½ reis to 500 reis. Again, the 100 reis stamp was officially bisected for use on letters. These stamps were of the general single-colour design for Portuguese stamps at the time, but with the name &quot;Funchal&quot; and the value figure printed in black (on two values, in red). The 25 reis value was issued in 1899 in booklets containing six stamps each.

Not counting perforation varieties, bisects, and booklets, 34 different stamps were issued for Funchal, all of them showing the portrait of King Carlos I.

<text>St Thomas was a hub of the West Indies packet service from 1851 to 1885. Initially mail was transported by a Spanish packet to and from Puerto Rico; but in July 1867 the British picked up the mail contract, and packet letters are known using British stamps as late as 1879.

==First stamps==
The first postage stamp of the Danish West Indies was issued in 1856. It had the same square coat of arms design as the contemporary stamps of Denmark, but it was denominated 3 cents and of a dark carmine color on yellowish paper. A yellow burelage of wavy lines covered the stamp. (In the illustration at right, it is most easily seen along the bottom edge of the larger version.) An 1866 printing was on white paper, with the direction of the burelage lines changed, and in 1872 the stamps were perforated. In 1873 a 4c value in dull blue was issued.

1874 saw the first numeral issues of the same sort as used in Denmark. Values ranged from 1c to 50c; all were bi-colored. Inverted frames are common for several of the lower values.

As usual for small colonies far away, the Danish West Indies ran out of popular values periodically, and the colonial administration had to improvise. A 1c surcharge was printed on 7c stamps in 1887, and a 10c surcharge on 50c in 1895. An additional supply of numeral types in new colors came out between 1896 and 1901.

Single-color 1c and 5c stamps were issued in 1900 to meet UPU regulations. Shortages of 2c and 8c values led to more surcharges in 1902, rectified in the following year by an issue of those values using the arms design of 1900. Postage due stamps first appeared in 1902 also.

==Currency reform==

As a result of the currency reform, in 1905, new stamps were issued. Values from 5b to 50b had a silhouette of King Christian IX, while 1fr, 2fr, and 5fr depicted the sailing ship &quot;Ingolf&quot; in St. Thomas harbor. New postage dues were required as well. Additional 5b stamps were produced by surcharging older stamps.

A definitive series of 1907 depicted Frederik VIII, followed in 1915 by a series for Christian X.

A few types are cheaply available today, such as the low values of the 1907 issue, but most fall into the US$10-20 range. Because the letter-writing population was very small, perhaps just a few hundred persons, used copies are often valued more highly by collectors, and both forged and favor cancellations are known to have been made.

When the islands were sold to the United States in 1917 and renamed the United States Virgin Islands, the colony ceased producing its own postage stamps.

<text>In 1920 a plebiscite was held to determine whether the populace of the Region of Allenstein wished to remain in East Prussia and that in parts of the Region of Marienwerder to become part of that province in reconfined borders, or become part of Poland. In order to advertise the plebiscite, special postage stamps were produced by overprinting German stamps and sold from 3 April. One kind of overprint read , while the other read inside an oval whose border gave the full name of the plebiscite commission. Each overprint was applied to 14 denominations ranging from 5 Pf to 3 M.

The plebiscite was held on 11 July, and produced 362,209 votes (97.8%) for East Prussia and 7,980 votes (2.2%) for Poland. The stamps became invalid on 20 August. Despite the short period of use, almost all of the stamps are cheaply available both used and unused.

After the Second World War, on 2 August 1945, the city became part of Poland under terms of the Potsdam Agreement) and officially renamed as Olsztyn.</text><links>

<doc id="891886" wikidata="Q4204954" url="?curid=891886" title="Postage stamps and postal history of Manchukuo">
<text>Manchukuo (Japanese for &quot;Manchu State&quot;) was a constitutional monarchy in Manchuria and eastern Inner Mongolia, the region being the historical homeland of the Manchus who founded the Qing dynasty of China. In 1931, it was seized by Imperial Japan following the Mukden Incident and in 1932, a puppet government was created. This was abolished in 1945 after the defeat of Imperial Japan at the end of World War II.

Manchukuo issued its first postage stamps on 26 July 1932. A number of denominations existed, with two designs: the pagoda at Liaoyang and a portrait of Puyi. Originally the inscription read (in Chinese) &quot;Manchu State Postal Administration&quot;; in 1934, a new issue read &quot;Manchu Empire Postal Administration&quot;. An orchid crest design appeared in 1935, and a design featuring the &quot;Sacred White Mountains&quot; in 1936.

The year 1936 also saw a new regular series featuring various scenes and surmounted by the orchid crest. Between 1937 and 1945, the government issued a variety of commemoratives: for anniversaries of its own existence, to note the passing of new laws, and to honor Japan in various ways, for instance, on the 2600th anniversary of the Japanese Empire in 1940. The last issue of Manchukuo came on 2 May 1945, commemorating the 10th anniversary of an edict.

After the dissolution of the government, successor postal authorities locally handstamped many of the remaining stamp stocks with &quot;Republic of China&quot; in Chinese and so forth. In addition, the Port Arthur and Dairen Postal Administration overprinted many Manchukuo postage stamps between 1946 and 1949.

<text>Giorgio Borg Olivier () (5 July 1911 – 29 October 1980) was a Maltese politician. He twice served as Prime Minister of Malta (1950–1955 and 1962–1971) as the Leader of the Nationalist Party. He was also Leader of the Opposition between 1955–1958, and again between 1971–1977.

Borg Olivier was elected as one of the three Nationalist members of the Council of Government in 1939. In May 1940, when the leader of the Nationalist party, Enrico Mizzi, was first interned by the British and deported, Borg Olivier became interim leader. After his return, Mizzi made Borg Olivier his deputy. Rising to office as a protégé of Mizzi and Sir Ugo P. Mifsud, Borg Olivier believed in the economic and social development of Malta as a viable independent state and in the necessity of a mixed economy. During his premiership, he pursued corporatist policies to develop the tourism industry and construction as the engine of growth. Under his leadership, average living standards rose steadily as Malta began to decouple from a fortress economy purely dependent on the British military establishment.

Near the end of his rule as prime minister, his government was rocked by various political and personal scandals, which seemed to symbolise the moral decay of the Maltese political establishment. Resigning from Leader of the Nationalist Party in 1977, Borg Olivier retained his parliamentary seat until his death in 1980. He was succeeded as leader of the party by Eddie Fenech Adami.

==Early life==

===Family===
George Borg Olivier was born in Valletta, the son of Olivier Borg Olivier and Rosa (née Amato), and had had a sheltered childhood lived in the Valletta of the 1920s and 1930s.

Borg Olivier grew up in a family steeped in Nationalist politics. His uncle Salvatore was speaker of the house and then a senator, and led the opposition to Lord Strickland&#x27;s Constitutional Party in the 1920s before becoming a cabinet minister during the premiership of Ugo P. Mifsud in the early 1930s. Borg Olivier followed in this uncle&#x27;s footsteps by becoming a notary.

===Education===
He was educated at the Lyceum, Malta, and the Royal University of Malta, where he graduated Doctor of Laws in 1937. As a university student, Borg Olivier was elected President of the &quot;Comitato Permanente Universitario&quot; until it was suppressed by the British colonial government in March 1935.

==Personal life==

===Family===
Borg Olivier married Alexandra Mattei in 1943. They had one daughter, Angela, and two sons, Alexander and Peter. Alexandra Borg Olivier died on 25 February 2009, aged 87. Peter Borg Olivier died 19 April 2012, aged 62.

==Political career==

===Private member (1939–1950) ===
The 1930s were particularly trying for Maltese society. War on the continent caused social and cultural tension on the islands. The alignment of local culture with Italy by elements of the social elite appeared to be lackey behaviour towards Fascist Italy. The Partito Nazionale of Enrico Mizzi and Sir Ugo P. Mifsud, the party chosen by Borg Olivier, came under strict scrutiny once war broke out in Europe in 1939. The war led to the exile of Nationalists supporters, including Enrico Mizzi, one of the main leaders of the Partito Nazionale. On 25 June 1939, Borg Olivier addressed his first mass-meeting in Siġġiewi, a village which also hosted his office as notary public:

Borg Olivier played an active role in this election, addressing political meetings in various villages, such as Birkirkara and Bormla. He was one of the three party candidates, together with Mizzi and Mifsud, who made it to the Council of Government in 1939. The Nationalist members&#x27; line in the 1939 Council of Government was not obstructionist, however the three members believed that &quot;the nation is mature, and quite mature from now to administer the government. It has sufficient talent, sufficient capacity for work and sufficient patriotism.&quot;

Borg Olivier was also chosen by Lieutenant governor William Dobbie as one of eight Protection Officers. Following the illegal internment and deportation of Maltese citizens, Borg Olivier offered a sustained opposition to the Council&#x27;s deportations, talking at length and in many occasions against these actions, famously observing that:

The internees were returned to Malta in May 1945, and the three Nationalist members of the Council resigned in July, with the Nationalists refusing to participate in the 1945 elections. This was a protest against the imposition of non-administrative government. In 1947, Borġ Olivier was elected to the Legislative Assembly and was later Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The Boffa Government of 1947 was soon in crisis following Paul Boffa&#x27;s disagreements with Dom Mintoff.

===From Minister to Prime Minister (1950–1955) ===
Following the general elections of 1950, Borg Olivier held the post of Minister for Public Works and Reconstruction and Minister of Education in a Nationalist Minority Government led by Enrico Mizzi. Borg Olivier became prime minister and Minister of Justice in a Minority Government upon Mizzi&#x27;s death in December 1950. He was also confirmed leader of the Nationalist Party by the Party&#x27;s Executive Committee. The obstructionist strategies of the parties in opposition made Borġ Olivier bid the Governor, Sir Gerald Creasy, to call for fresh elections. These were held in May 1951, and as a result of them, Borg Olivier formed a coalition Government with the Malta Workers&#x27; Party, which was led by erstwhile PM Paul Boffa. Borg Olivier was head of the new government, retaining the Ministry for Public Works and Reconstruction. Re-elected in 1953, the coalition remained in office till 1955.

On the political front, these years were marked with the attempt for a proper definition of Malta&#x27;s constitutional status and relationship with the United Kingdom. One such attempt related to an incident with respect to the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. Borġ Olivier was invited for the ceremony, but refused to attend unless Malta was granted special precedence over other colonies. The difficulties were overcome when the British government agreed to treat the Prime Minister of Malta on an equal basis to the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia and Northern Ireland. This was a diplomatic victory for Borġ Olivier, winning him unanimous approval in Parliament.

During his stay in London, Borġ Olivier presented a memorandum to the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs, Henry Hopkinson, explaining the Maltese government&#x27;s position that Malta ought be transferred from the Colonial Office to the Commonwealth Relations Office, as an independent dominion within the Commonwealth. This was a counter-proposal to the British Government&#x27;s offer to move Malta under Home Office responsibility. Discussions by a Maltese delegation in May 1953 focused on the legal, constitutional and economic aspects of this question. This was a prelude to the political struggle with Mintoff&#x27;s Malta Labour Party, which favoured integration with Britain.

===Leader of the Opposition (1955–1958)===

The general elections of 1955, which were lost by the Nationalist party, were linked with the two competing proposals of integration with Britain and dominion status. The imperial authorities on the islands were accused of exerting undue pressure on the electorate by the Nationalist party, with the Governor, Major General Sir Robert Laycock, taking the unheard of step of addressing the electorate over the rediffusion at the start of the electoral campaign. The Nationalist Congress, held 24 April 1955, passed a resolution deploring the &quot;scandalous and unconstitutional interference of the Governor.&quot;

From 1955–58, Borg Olivier served as Leader of Opposition. He led the Nationalist Party delegations in June and September 1955 for the &quot;Malta Round Table Conference&quot;. In these meetings, the Nationalist members reiterated that &quot;Malta ought be given full autonomy within the Commonwealth, autonomous in its relationship with the United Kingdom, but not with the rest of the Commonwealth and other independent nations. The matters dealing with defense, the Commonwealth and international relationships should be the equal responsibility of the governments of the United Kingdom and Malta.&quot;

These constitutional demands were not met by the British government, which moved to agree in principle with Mintoff&#x27;s demands for integration with Britain. A referendum was called, with Borg Olivier calling a boycott of the vote. Although the votes cast showed a substantial majority for integration, the outcome clearly showed that the nation did not approve of the proposals. Coupled with Borġ Olivier&#x27;s attempts to expose British intrusions, and that &quot;the Secretary of State for the Colonies is determined to bulldoze integration on the Island,&quot; support for the Malta Labour Party&#x27;s proposal for full integration began to wane.

With the decrease in British defence spending, and the British government&#x27;s unwillingness to set dates for full equality between the Maltese and British people, the integration proposal was effectively dead.
At this point, Mintoff resigned and declared a national day of protest. Riots broke out 28 April 1958. The governor declared a state of emergency with troops placed on standby to help the civil police. After Borg Olivier&#x27;s refusal to form a government, the governor was forced to declare a state of public emergency in Malta, suspending the 1947 Constitution.

===Prime Minister (1962–1971)===

====Road to Independence====
Following the February 1962 election, Borg Olivier agreed to form a Government after obtaining important amendments to the Constitution. In addition to being prime minister, he assumed the portfolio of Minister of Economic Planning and Finance. In the 1962 elections, 76% of the electorate voted for the principal parties which were demanding Independence. The Nationalist Party had suffered an internal split, with Herbert Ganado founding the more populist Democratic Nationalist Party.

The Nationalists gained a majority and therefore Borg Olivier became prime minister. Shortly afterwards, amendments to the Constitution were made. Borg Olivier proceeded to London to ask for a financial agreement and demand Independence with full membership within the Commonwealth. At the time unemployment had risen to 6% and there were fears of discharges from the Naval Arsenal. On 20 August 1962, Dr Borg Olivier presented a formal request for Independence. It was soon made known that the Attorney General Prof John J. Cremona, was working on a draft constitution while it was announced that a Malta Independence Conference was to be held at Marlborough House, London. The Conference started on 16 July 1963. Delegates from all the political parties led by Borg Olivier, Dom Mintoff, Toni Pellegrini, Herbert Ganado and Mabel Strickland attended. The Conference was chaired by Duncan Sandys. Discussions went on right through July. The Maltese Government was asking for a monarchical state with a Governor General representing the Queen. The Secretary of State proposed a referendum about the constitution.

Borg Olivier&#x27;s shrewdness as a politician enabled him to use the ongoing religious conflict between the Labour Party and the Maltese church, headed by Archbishop Mikiel Gonzi, to his advantage. This was a particular achievement given Borg Olivier&#x27;s relationship with the Bishop were very strained. However, Borg Olivier was still able to gain a reduction in the clerical and episcopal influence on Maltese politics.

This was the tail end of the Maltese Politico-religious dispute, comparable in some ways to the questions arising thirty years earlier, in Strickland&#x27;s time. Although there was a personality clash between Archbishop Gonzi and Mintoff, other issues of power and jurisdiction were clearly becoming evident in the growing tension between the ecclesiastical sphere and the state. Mass hysteria and campaigns of almost sectarian proportions ensued, with Mintoff and several of his Labour Party colleagues being denied the sacraments and demonised. Borg Olivier was no religious fanatic, and took the politically correct side against his main adversary, riding on the wave of religious sentiment. Privately he argued that the Church&#x27;s efforts to rally third parties to enter the political fray was damaging his chances. This referred in particular to a second, Church-supported right-wing party led by Herbert Ganado, which had returned four MPs in the 1962 elections. Ganado, along with three other &#x27;pro-church&#x27; small parties, two of which with returned MPs, were opposed to independence.

Gonzi wanted to check both Mintoff and Borġ Olivier, to prevent the loss of the Church&#x27;s guarded status under a new political system. Both the main political parties, the PN and the MLP, had independence from Britain prominently included in their electoral campaigns. On taking office in 1962, the demand for independence was put on the table quickly enough and preliminary discussions began almost immediately. Borġ Olivier tried rather unsuccessfully to get Britain to increase its aid to Malta, to protect against the consequences of the planned &#x27;run down&#x27; of British service establishments in Malta. After unsuccessful talks, Borg Olivier retorted that he had not gone to London &quot;to make a silver collection&quot;.

From his London hotel on 20 August 1962, Borg Olivier addressed to the secretary of state for the colonies a formal and urgent request for Malta&#x27;s independence. The main British concern was of course defence, but also security. The violence of 1958 and subsequent events, including manifestations of support for &#x27;neutrality and non-alignment&#x27;, had rather dented regard for Mintoff and his party generally, not only among the British Conservative Party. The Malta Labour Party tended to be perceived now as departing from or sidelining the Western camp. It was the Nationalists under Borg Olivier who were now seen by the British as the better able to reassure the West, and to offer the best chances for democracy, security, and stability in an independent state.

After a controversial referendum in May 1964, in which a majority of the votes cast approved the proposed independence constitution, in July a full round of talks with all the five political parties concerned, led by Borg Olivier as prime minister, was held at Marlborough House in London. The minority view against immediate independence was dismissed. The majority view was hindered by disagreements as to constitutional form, mainly concerning civil and secular entitlements against traditional Roman Catholic presumptions and fears, but one of Mintoff&#x27;s six points also endorsed the potential justification of violence. The MLP also seemed unenthusiastic about Malta&#x27;s staying in the Commonwealth, or retaining the George Cross in the national colours.

On 13 July 1963, Borg Olivier headed a Government delegation for the Malta Independence Conference at the end of which it was announced that Malta would become independent. On 25 January 1964, Borg Olivier was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Sylvester, Pope, by Pope Paul VI. After having had a series of talks with the British Government and after preparing a Constitution for an independent Malta, which was endorsed by Parliament and approved by the people in a referendum held in February 1964, Borg Olivier set 21 September as Malta&#x27;s Independence Day. Independence was part of a package which included retaining British defence facilities for ten years and financial aid to the tune of £51 million. NATO&#x27;s Mediterranean branch headquarters, just outside Valletta, was also retained, ensuring that Malta would remain in the Western sphere of influence, while British and NATO forces would continue to benefit from the islands&#x27; strategic location.

On Independence Day, 21 September 1964, the degree of Doctor of Literature (Honoris Causa) was conferred on Borg Olivier by the Royal University of Malta. In November 1964, he was received by Pope Paul VI and made Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Pius IX.

====Independent Malta====

In March 1965, he became Minister of Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in addition to his duties as prime minister and Minister of Economic Planning and Finance. In the General Elections held in March 1966, the Nationalist Party was again returned to power with Borg Olivier as prime minister and Minister of Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. On 14 June 1968, Borg Olivier was decorated with the Grand Cross of Merit of the Order of Malta by the Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta.

Borg Olivier&#x27;s family affairs, which were somewhat disturbed, soon fell under public scrutiny. The marital relationship of the Borg Olivier couple began to be used by all his political opponents as a source of criticism. These scandals were part of the political rhetoric of the 1960s. The Maltese church&#x27;s teachings still played a cardinal role in local politics. Borg Olivier had jumped on the Church&#x27;s bandwagon, grasping a substantial political advantage from the Church&#x27;s excommunication of the Maltese Labour Party.

Borg Olivier did not agree with the Church&#x27;s position, yet he still capitalised on the situation and gave sterling support to the Church&#x27;s authorities. The introduction of Labour newspapers in public hospitals was banned, a decision later revoked by the courts, while excommunicated citizens were forbidden from being buried in their family graves in public cemeteries. The abuse of Maltese children who had been sent to Australia on the initiative of the Maltese church was another scandal which rocked the country.

===Leader of the Opposition (1971–1977)===

As the 1960s came to a close, an economy reeling from over-reliance on construction and labour troubles at the Dockyards endangered Borg Olivier&#x27;s administration. Above all, the common belief was that Borg Olivier and his cabinet had no initiative, preferring to react rather than to act.

In the 1971 election campaign, the Labour Party claimed that the government was lazy and out of touch, especially compared with the aggressive and determined Mintoff. However, the Borg Olivier Cabinet was incredibly active meeting, in all, 766 times from 27 August 1962 to 1 June 1971, just before the elections which were to unseat it; the cabinet met even on Boxing Day, sometimes morning and evening, and even on the feast day of St Paul&#x27;s Shipwreck. This effort did Borg Olivier no good; Mintoff and Labour regained power.

Having led the Nationalists to defeat in the 1971 election and also the next election five years later, Borg Olivier incurred increasing censure within as well as outside his own party. His approach seemed lightweight and passive compared with Mintoff&#x27;s vehement rule. Borġ Olivier opposed, but without success, the growing tendency of Mintoff&#x27;s most extreme supporters to resort to violence as a political weapon.

Among Borg Olivier&#x27;s fellow party members, a younger generation had emerged by this time which considered him physically and politically incapable of winning back popular support from Mintoff. His growing tendency to procrastinate rather than to take tough decisions attracted particular criticism.

During January 1974, eighteen Nationalist parliamentarians signed a declaration of no confidence in Borġ Olivier&#x27;s leadership. Three others who could not attend signed later. Out of 27 MPs, only five supported the party leader. These five MPs were Paulo Borg Olivier (George&#x27;s brother), Albert Borg Olivier de Puget (George&#x27;s nephew), Alfred Bonnici (who had been appointed speaker in the previous parliament by George), J. Cassar Galea (an old friend of Borġ Olivier) and Alexander Cachia Zammit (a former minister in Borg Olivier&#x27;s cabinet). Borg Olivier could still count on the support of his relatives in the party, as well as on those politicians who, like Cachia Zammit, had been members of his 1962-1971 cabinets and were still in the legislature. For a while, that backing was enough to enable Borg Olivier to retain the party leadership. Yet when Borg Olivier loyalists proved incapable of opposing Mintoff&#x27;s proposal to change Malta from a constitutional monarchy to a republic (with a parliamentary majority of two-thirds, but without the referendum which Borg Olivier wanted), his position was fatally weakened.

After Mintoff&#x27;s re-election in 1976, the general feeling among most Nationalists was that the party could succeed only if it acquired a young, genuinely devout, dynamic Catholic as a new leader. In other words, the Nationalist Party wanted to adopt a populist approach. Ironically enough, it was a position which had been advocated by Ganado, but which Borg Olivier had strongly resisted in the sixties. Undercurrents began to form within the higher ranks of the party with the aim of removing Borg Olivier. Eddie Fenech Adami, a comparative newcomer among Nationalist parliamentarians, became the party&#x27;s leader in 1977. At 44 years of age he was much younger and more determined than Borg Olivier. His tenure as Opposition Leader reinvigorated an ailing party, which achieved an actual majority of the popular vote in 1981.

After stepping down from party leader, Borg Olivier became a recluse, alone, friendless and detached from the local political scene. A sense of betrayal marked his attitude, given that Fenech Adami had been encouraged by Borg Olivier to remain in politics after suffering two personal electoral defeats.

==Death and state funeral==
Despite his increasingly worsening health, Borġ Olivier still tried to remain active in public life. By 1980, Borg Olivier had been battling lung cancer for a number of years. Less than four years after he had resigned from the leadership of the Nationalist Party, he died at his Sliema home, at age 69, on Wednesday 29 October 1980.

Prime Minister Mintoff expressed his intention to organise a state funeral for Borg Olivier. His funeral was the largest state funeral in Maltese history up to that point in time, and it was followed by thousands who went to Valletta to pay their last respects. He was buried at Addolorata cemetery, Paola, Malta.

A monument in honour of Borġ Olivier was erected in Castille Square, Valletta in 1989, as part of the events commemorating the 25th anniversary of independence.

<doc id="891891" wikidata="Q16203502" url="?curid=891891" title="United States congressional delegations from Utah">
<text>Since Utah became a U.S. state in 1896, it has sent congressional delegations to the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives. Each state elects two senators to serve for six years. Before the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, senators were elected by the Utah State Legislature. Members of the House of Representatives are elected to two-year terms, one from each of Utah&#x27;s four congressional districts. Before becoming a state, the Territory of Utah elected a non-voting delegate at-large to Congress from 1850 to 1896.

58 people have served either the Territory or State of Utah: 14 in the Senate, 42 in the House, and 2 in both houses. The average term for senators has been 15.3 years and the average term for representatives has been 6.7 years. The longest-serving senator was Orrin Hatch, from 1977 to 2019. The longest-serving representative is James V. Hansen, in office for 22 years from 1981 to 2003. No Utah women have served in the Senate, but five women - Reva Beck Bosone, Karen Shepherd, Enid Greene, Mia Love, and Celeste Maloy - have been Representatives.

The current dean of the Utah delegation is Senator Mike Lee, having served in Congress since 2011.

==U.S. Senate==


Each state elects two senators by statewide popular vote every six years. The terms of the two senators are staggered so that they are not elected in the same year. Utah&#x27;s senators are elected in the years from classes 1 and 3. Senators were originally chosen by the Utah House of Representatives until the Seventeenth Amendment came into force in 1913.

There have been eighteen senators elected from Utah, of whom five have been Democrats and thirteen have been Republicans. Utah&#x27;s current senators are Republicans Mike Lee, in office since 2011, and John Curtis, in office since 2025.




==U.S. House of Representatives==
=== Current representatives ===
&lt;section end=&quot;Current representatives&quot;/&gt;

===Delegates from Utah Territory===
The Territory of Utah was an organized incorporated territory of the United States formed on September 9, 1850. The territory initially consisted of present-day Utah, most of Nevada, and portions of Colorado and Wyoming. On February 28, 1861, the creation of Colorado Territory took land from the eastern side of Utah Territory. Nevada Territory was organized from the western section of Utah Territory on March 2, 1861. Also on that date, Nebraska Territory gained area from the northeastern part of Utah Territory. Nevada Territory gained area from Utah Territory on July 14, 1862, and again on May 5, 1866, after becoming a state. Wyoming Territory was created on July 25, 1868, from Nebraska Territory, taking more area from the northeast corner and giving Utah Territory its final borders.

The territorial delegates were elected to two-year terms. Delegates were allowed to serve on committees, debate, and submit legislation, but were not permitted to vote on bills. Delegates only served in the House of Representatives as there was no representation in the Senate until Utah became a state.



===Representatives from the State of Utah===
Members of the House of Representatives are elected every two years by popular vote within a congressional district. From 1895 till 1913, Utah had an at-large congressional district that represented the entire state. Every ten years, the number of congressional districts is reapportioned based on the state&#x27;s population as determined by the United States census; Utah has had four districts since 2013.

<text>Nuance Communications, Inc. is an American multinational computer software technology corporation, headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts, that markets speech recognition and artificial intelligence software.

Nuance merged with its competitor in the commercial large-scale speech application business, ScanSoft, in October 2005. ScanSoft was a Xerox spin-off that was bought in 1999 by Visioneer, a hardware and software scanner company, which adopted ScanSoft as the new merged company name. The original ScanSoft had its roots in Kurzweil Computer Products.

In April 2021, Microsoft announced it would buy Nuance Communications. The deal is an all-cash transaction of $19.7 billion, including company debt, or $56 per share. The acquisition was completed in March 2022.

==History==
The company that would become Nuance was incorporated in 1992 as Visioneer. In 1999, Visioneer acquired ScanSoft, Inc. (SSFT), and the combined company became known as ScanSoft. In September 2005, ScanSoft Inc. acquired and merged with Nuance Communications, a natural language spinoff from SRI International. The resulting company adopted the Nuance name. During the prior decade, the two companies competed in the commercial large-scale speech application business.

=== ScanSoft origins ===
In 1974, Raymond Kurzweil founded Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. to develop the first omni-font optical character-recognition systema computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font. In 1980, Kurzweil sold his company to Xerox. The company became known as Xerox Imaging Systems (XIS), and later ScanSoft.

In March 1992, a new company called Visioneer, Inc. was founded to develop scanner hardware and software products, such as a sheetfed scanner called PaperMax and the document management software PaperPort. Visioneer eventually sold its hardware division to Primax Electronics, Ltd. in January 1999. Two months later, in March, Visioneer acquired ScanSoft from Xerox to form a new public company with ScanSoft as the new company-wide name.

Prior to 2001, ScanSoft focused primarily on desktop imaging software such as TextBridge, PaperPort and OmniPage. Beginning with the December 2001 acquisition of Lernout &amp; Hauspie assets, the company moved into the speech recognition business and began to compete with Nuance. Lernout &amp; Hauspie had acquired speech recognition company Dragon Systems in June 2001, shortly before becoming bankrupt in October. Scansoft acquired speech recognition company SpeechWorks in 2003.

=== Partnership with Siri and Apple Inc. ===
In 2013, Nuance confirmed that its natural language processing algorithms supported Apple&#x27;s Siri voice assistant.

=== Focus on health care ===

In 2019, Nuance spun off its automotive division as the company Cerence, allowing it to focus on health care applications.

=== Acquisition by Microsoft ===
On April 12, 2021, Microsoft announced that it will buy Nuance Communications for $19.7 billion, or $56 a share, a 22% increase over the previous closing price. Nuance&#x27;s CEO, Mark Benjamin, stayed with the company. This was Microsoft&#x27;s second-biggest acquisition up to that point, after its purchase of LinkedIn for $24 billion (~$ in ) in 2016. Shortly after the deal, the Competition and Markets Authority, a UK regulatory body, stated it was looking into the deal on the basis of antitrust concerns. In December 2021, it was reported that the deal would be approved by the European Union. The acquisition was completed on March 4, 2022.

In May 2023, Nuance announced an unspecified number of layoffs.

<text>Actaea, commonly called baneberry, bugbane and cohosh, is a genus of flowering plants of the family Ranunculaceae, native to subtropical, temperate and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia and North America.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus was redefined to include &quot;Cimicifuga&quot; and &quot;Souliea&quot; in the 1990s (Compton et al. 1998, Compton &amp; Culham 2002, Gao et al. 2006, RHS Plant Finder, 2007) based on combined evidence from DNA sequence data, similarity in biochemical constituents and on morphology returning it to the original Linnean concept of the genus. The number of species in &quot;Actaea&quot; is to 25–30 using this concept. Other botanists (e.g., Hoffman 1999, Wang et al. 1999, Lee &amp; Park 2004, Wang et al. 2009) reject this merger because only one group (&quot;Actaea&quot;) have fleshy fruit while the remainder have dry fruit. However, this narrower generic concept works for only a single morphological character and other characters such as number of carpels moves the generic boundary. The genus is treated here in its broader sense.

# &quot;Actaea taiwanensis&quot; 
# &quot;Actaea vaginata&quot; 
# &quot;Actaea yunnanensis&quot; 

=== Etymology ===
&quot;Actaea&quot; is derived from the Greek name for elder (&quot;Sambucus&quot;); it was named by Pliny because the leaves of &quot;Actaea&quot; and &quot;Sambucus&quot; are similar in appearance.

The name &quot;Actaea alba&quot; (L.) Mill. is a confused one (Fernald 1940); although described as an American species (now named &quot;A. pachypoda&quot;), the illustration on which the description was based was actually a picture of the European &quot;A. spicata&quot;, and strictly, the name is therefore a synonym of the European species. Some texts, however, still treat &quot;A. pachypoda&quot; under this name.

== Use and toxicity ==

Baneberry contains cardiac toxins that can have an immediate sedative effect on human cardiac muscle. The berries are the most poisonous part of the plant (hence the name baneberry). Children have been poisoned by eating the waxy, shiny red or white berries. Ingestion of the berries can lead to cardiac arrest and death. It is toxic to rabbits. The berries are harmless to birds, the plant&#x27;s primary seed disperser. 

The synonym &quot;Cimicifuga&quot;, meaning &#x27;bed bug repellent&#x27;, has traditional uses: for example, in pharmacology, &quot;Cimicifugae rhizoma&quot; is a herbal medicine &quot;Sheng ma&quot;, a Chinese preparation which may be extracted from the roots of &quot;A. dahurica&quot; and &quot;A. heracleifolia&quot;. The roots of &quot;A. rubra&quot; contain β-sitosterol glucoside.

&quot;Actaea&quot; species are in the same subfamily as plants in the genus &quot;Aconitum&quot;, a highly toxic plant genus which contains &quot;wolfbane&quot; and several varieties of &quot;monkshood&quot;.

<text>Cullen Montgomery Baker (June 23, 1835 – January 1869) was a Tennessee-born desperado whose gang terrorized Union soldiers and civilians in Northeast Texas, Southwest Arkansas, and Northwest Louisiana during the early days of the American Old West. His gang is alleged to have killed hundreds of people in the years following the American Civil War, though these numbers are probably inaccurate, and the actual number is between fifty and sixty.

Baker was notorious for his fiery temper and for fighting in saloon brawls. During one fight, he was knocked unconscious by a man named Morgan Culp, who hit him in the head with a tomahawk. This seemed to have shocked him into behaving, and it calmed his temper at least for a while. Baker has also been described as a gunfighter, though his preferred weapon was a double-barreled shotgun.

==Early life==
Baker was born in Weakley County, Tennessee, a son of John Baker and his wife. Soon afterward his family moved to Clarksville, Arkansas, and as Cullen matured he spent much of his time in the saloons and bars of what are now Lafayette and Miller Counties. His father was an honest farmer and owned cattle as well as working in the fields. Even when young, Cullen is said to have had a quick temper, which was further revealed as he got older, as he drank heavily and often.

On January 11, 1854, in Cass County, Texas, Baker married Martha Jane Petty, the daughter of Hubbard and Nancy Petty, and for a time he settled. However, eight months into his marriage, while out drinking with friends, he became involved in a verbal altercation with a youth named Stallcup. Baker became enraged, grabbed a whip, and beat the boy to near death. There were several witnesses to the incident, and Baker was soon charged with the crime. One of the witnesses, Wesley Bailey, was confronted by Baker at Bailey&#x27;s home. Baker shot him in both legs with a shotgun, then left him lying in front of his house. Bailey died a few days later. Before he could be arrested for the murder, Baker fled to Arkansas, where he stayed with an uncle.

On May 24, 1857, Martha Jane Baker gave birth to a baby girl, Louisa Jane. On June 2, 1860, Martha Jane died. Cullen Baker then returned to Texas, where he left his daughter with his in-laws.

Baker returned to Arkansas, but word of his crimes had spread, and a local woman named Beth Warthom was openly critical of him. He took several hickory switches to her house and threatened to beat her. Her husband, David Warthom, began to fight with Baker, and overwhelmed him in front of the house. Beth screamed, and as her husband looked her way, he was stabbed once with a knife Baker had in his possession. Warthom died on the spot. Baker fled back to Texas, and in July 1862, he married his second wife Martha Foster, who was unaware that he was wanted for murder. She was a daughter of William and Elizabeth Young Foster.

==American Civil War and after==
Baker served with the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, joining shortly after his second marriage. It is claimed he shot and killed at least three African Americans, killing a black woman in an immigrant train and later shooting a black boy six times with a pistol after taking the Oath of Allegiance and becoming an overseer of Freemen. By 1864 he had either been discharged or deserted, and he joined a group called the &quot;Independent Rangers&quot;, loosely associated with the Confederate Home Guard. It was intended to pursue and capture deserters from the Confederate Army, but more often than not took advantage of most of the men being away at war, leaving mostly elderly men, women and children. This left the door open for acts of intimidation, rape, theft and violence for groups of well-armed men like the &quot;Independent Rangers&quot;. Shortly after Baker joined the &quot;Independent Rangers&quot; they began an ongoing feud with another band called the &quot;Mountain Boomers&quot;, but by the end of that year the &quot;Boomers&quot; had been driven out or forced to disperse due to several of their members having been killed by the &quot;Rangers&quot;.

In November 1864, Baker led a group of &quot;Rangers&quot; to intercept a band of Arkansas settlers, mostly older men, women and children, who had fled Perry County, Arkansas for a better life out west. Baker allegedly considered this &quot;un-patriotic&quot;, but more likely than not his motives were simple robbery. The &quot;Rangers&quot; caught up with these fleeing settlers as they were crossing the Saline River somewhere in the Ouachita Mountains, but when the settlers refused to return Baker drew his pistol and shot and killed the group&#x27;s leader. With assurances from Baker that he would not kill anyone else, the remaining settlers returned to Baker&#x27;s side of the river, where he quickly led his &quot;Rangers&quot; in shooting and killing nine other men. The event became known locally as the &quot;Massacre of Saline&quot;.

By that stage of the war the Union Army occupied most of Arkansas, with several troops under the command of Captain F. S. Dodge enforcing the law in the area of Lafayette County. Most of these Union troops were African American and despised by Baker. Toward the end of 1864 Baker was in a saloon in the small town of Spanish Bluff, Bowie County, Texas, when he was approached by four African-American Union soldiers and asked for identification. Baker turned to face them with his pistol drawn, shooting and killing one sergeant and the three other soldiers.

After the war ended, Baker organized a gang with outlaw Lee Rames, which operated out of the Sulphur River bottoms near Brightstar, Arkansas, committing acts of robbery and murder. Authorities credit Baker officially with killing at least 30 people, though many of these no doubt were killed by his fellow gang members. Unlike the romanticized versions of his exploits, the reality was that he killed most of his victims from ambush or from behind, many with a shotgun, and he almost always had his victims outnumbered. Like many of the ex-Confederates who became criminals after the war, Baker was regarded as a hero by some because he opposed the Federal occupation, but his record shows a merciless killer who killed anyone who angered him, regardless of their loyalties.

In March 1866, Baker traveled back to Texas. Now on the run from Union authorities, he went on a killing spree during which he killed two men, W. G. Kirkman and John Salmons. Salmons had previously killed one of Baker&#x27;s gang members, Seth Rames, brother to gang member Lee Rames. Baker also killed a local man named George W. Barron, who had previously taken part as a member of a posse hunting Baker. The gang was active in the areas of Queen City, Texas and Texarkana, Arkansas during this time.

On June 1, 1867, having returned to Cass County, Baker entered the Rowden general store where he found the store kept by Mrs. Rowden, after which he simply helped himself to whatever he wanted and left without paying. When the store&#x27;s owner, John Rowden, discovered this he armed himself with a shotgun and rode out to Baker&#x27;s house. He demanded that Baker pay him, to which Baker replied that he would come back to the store in a few days with the money. On June 5, 1867, Baker returned, but instead of paying his debt stood in front of the store yelling for Mr. Rowden to come out and face him. Rowden armed himself with a shotgun and stepped out only to be shot in the chest and killed by Baker. Baker fled back into Arkansas, and a few days later he was confronted by a U.S. Army sergeant and one private as he boarded a ferry. When he was accused of being Cullen Baker, after having told them his name was Johnson, Baker went for his gun, as did the sergeant. Baker shot the sergeant four times, killing him, with the private fleeing on horseback and reporting the murder to a Captain Kirkham. Following this murder, Baker was pursued relentlessly by U.S. forces in the area.

While in New Boston, Texas, on July 25, 1867, Baker became involved in an argument with several U.S. Army soldiers. A shootout ensued and Baker was shot in the arm, though he killed Private Albert E. Titus of the U.S. 20th Infantry Regiment. This resulted in a $1,000 reward being placed on Baker for his capture or death.

He returned to Arkansas, and while in a saloon in Brightstar he agreed to join a mob intending to raid the farm of a local farmer named Howell Smith. Smith had hired several recently freed slaves, which was considered inappropriate by much of the local population. During the raid, one of Smith&#x27;s daughters was stabbed and another clubbed, and a black man was shot and killed. Smith resisted and a shootout ensued, resulting in several mob members being wounded, including Baker being shot in the leg.

On October 24, 1868, Baker and his gang were reported to have been involved in the killings of Major P. J. Andrews, Lt. H. F. Willis, and an unnamed negro, as well as the wounding of Sheriff Standel of Little Rock, Arkansas.

==Death==
Although Baker was feared by his own men, Lee Rames, who was recognized as the co-leader and co-founder of Baker&#x27;s gang, also had a substantial and deadly reputation. Rames began to doubt Baker&#x27;s leadership, and believed that eventually Baker would lead the entire gang to its downfall. Rames defied Baker and Baker backed down, leading to the gang breaking up. All but one gang member, &quot;Dummy&quot; Kirby, sided with Rames.

Baker and Kirby rode to Bloomburg, Texas and the home of Baker&#x27;s in-laws in January 1869. It was there that Cullen Baker and &quot;Dummy&quot; Kirby were killed. The exact circumstances of their deaths, however, remain unclear. There are at least two conflicting accounts:

*First version: Unknown to Baker, his wife Martha Foster&#x27;s father and friends had laced a bottle of whiskey and some food with strychnine. Kirby and Baker drank and ate it, and both died from poisoning. Their bodies were then shot several times by Foster and some friends.

*Second version: A local schoolteacher named Thomas Orr had become involved romantically with Baker&#x27;s second wife Martha, and led a small band of men who ambushed Baker and Kirby at the Foster home, shooting and killing them near to the chimney of the house. It is known that a schoolteacher named Thomas Orr was a friend of the in-laws who took part in the killing of Baker; whether the story of the affair is true is unknown.

What both versions share is the outcome. Baker and Kirby were killed at the Foster home, with both shot numerous times, and then the bodies were dragged through the town of Bloomburg. The bodies were taken to the U.S. Army outpost near Jefferson, where they were placed on public display. Baker is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Jefferson, Texas.

The town of Bloomburg, Texas continues to commemorate the event with the annual Cullen Baker Country Fair, held the first weekend in November. Proceeds benefit the Bloomburg City’s efforts to build a city park and revive tourism since the COVID-19 pandemic. 

===Possible eyewitness to Baker&#x27;s death===
A reference to Cullen (Col) Baker is made by former slave Doc Quinn in the &quot;Slave Narratives: a Folk History of Slavery in the United States - From Interviews with Former Slaves - Arkansas Narratives, Part 6&quot;. Doc Quinn provides a somewhat different perspective on Cullen Baker throughout. The statements of Doc Quinn are recorded as follows:

&quot;He wuz mah frien&#x27; as long as he lib, and he wuz a good frien&#x27; ob de South &#x27;cause he saved lots ob white folks frum de wrath ob de mean niggers.&quot; (sic)

Doc Quinn provides an account of Cullen Baker&#x27;s death at which he claims to have been present:

&quot;I saw Colonel Baker killed. We had just arrived at his father-in-law&#x27;s
house and I wuz in the horse lot, about 50 yards from de house, when Joe
Davis. Thomas Orr and some more men rode up.&quot;

&quot;De Colonel wuz standin&#x27; by de chimney an did not see dem come aroun&#x27; de
house. Dey killed him befo&#x27; he knew dey wuz aroun&#x27;.&quot;

Whilst Doc Quinn refers to Cullen Baker as &quot;Colonel&quot; Baker, the text from which Doc Quinn is quoted has the following inclusion, presumably included by the editor of the publication to clarify any confusion:
&quot;Note: The Col. Baker referred to was Cullen Baker, the leader of a ruthless gang of bushwhackers that operated in this [Texarkana, Arkansas] section shortly after the Civil War.&quot;

Louis L&#x27;Amour, author of many western novels, wrote about Cullen Baker in several of his books. Baker only starred in one of these, however, that being &quot;The First Fast Draw&quot;, a highly fictionalized account of Baker&#x27;s origin and subsequent years. Other books by L&#x27;Amour that reference Baker include &quot;Lando&quot;, one of L&#x27;Amour&#x27;s many novels about a feuding Tennessee family. Baker was also the subject of the book &quot;Cullen Baker; Reconstruction Desperado&quot;, authored by Barry A. Crouch and Donally E. Brice.

<doc id="891906" wikidata="Q7233961" url="?curid=891906" title="Postage stamps and postal history of the Orange Free State">
<text>The Orange Free State was an independent Boer republic in southern Africa during the second half of the 19th century.

The Orange Free State was annexed to the British Crown and renamed the Orange River Colony on 28 May 1900. In 1910 this colony along with Cape of Good Hope, Natal and Transvaal formed the Union of South Africa.

== Postage stamps==
The first Orange Free State stamps were issued in 1868. The sole design used was an orange tree, with the inscription &quot;Oranje Vrij Staat&quot; in the margin. The stamps were typographed by De La Rue and Company, and came in denominations from one penny to five shillings, in various colours. Periodic shortages forced the use of overprints, in 1877, 1881, 1882, 1888, 1890, 1892, 1896, and 1897. The stamps of the republic are generally common today, but some of the overprints are scarce. Many kinds of overprint errors are known (inverted, double, etc.), and some of them command high prices.

In 1900, the British occupied the Republic and the previous stamps were overprinted &quot;V.R.I.&quot; (Victoria Regina Imperatrix, Latin for Victoria, Queen and Empress) and the same value of the original stamps. The colony was renamed in August 1900 and used Cape of Good Hope stamps overprinted with the new name &quot;ORANGE/RIVER/COLONY.&quot; In 1902 a single 6d stamp was overprinted as the original occupation issues but with &quot;E.R.I.&quot; (Edward Rex Imperator, for Edward VII) instead of &quot;V.R.I.&quot;. In 1903 a set was issued portraying King Edward VII, a springbok and a gnu. This set was printed again in 1905–1909, and is the last set of the colony.

== Revenue stamps ==
A variety of revenue stamps were issued both for the Orange Free State and the Orange River Colony. The Orange Free State revenues were also postally used.

<doc id="891911" wikidata="Q5625339" url="?curid=891911" title="Gypsy Boots">
<text>Gypsy Boots (August 19, 1915 – August 8, 2004), born Robert Bootzin (also known as Boots Bootzin), was an American fitness pioneer, actor and writer. He is credited with laying the foundation for the acceptance by mainstream America of &quot;alternative&quot; lifestyles incorporating elements such as yoga and health food. He is also known for his vegetarian guide &quot;Bare Feet and Good Things to Eat&quot; and his memoir &quot;The Gypsy in Me&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Bootzin was born in San Francisco, California, to Russian Jewish immigrants. His father, Max, worked as a broom salesman. His mother, Mushka, raised Bootzin and his four siblings in a vegetarian household, while also leading the family on hikes in the hills, performing Russian folk dances and feeding the homeless with her home-baked black bread.

Bootzin&#x27;s older brother, John, died of tuberculosis as a young man; this led to Bootzin&#x27;s decision to grow his hair long and pursue healthful, natural living.

By 1933, he had dropped out of high school and left home to wander California with a group of self-styled vagabonds. In the 1940s, Bootzin, along with ten to fifteen other &quot;tribesmen,&quot; lived off the land in Tahquitz Canyon near Palm Springs, slept in caves and trees, and bathed in waterfalls. Decades ahead of the Hippie movement, Bootzin and his companions had long hair and beards, lived a carefree existence, and were seasonal fruit pickers. The group became known as &quot;Nature Boys.&quot; A combination of the philosophy of the Nature Boys and growing counterculture of the 1950s and 1960s in California may have been responsible for the emergence of California spirituality in the 1960s.

The 1948 Nat King Cole hit &quot;Nature Boy&quot; was inspired by Bootzin and his fellow &quot;tribesmen&quot; and was composed by eden ahbez.

In 1958, Bootzin married Lois Bloemker, a conservative, academic woman from Fort Wayne, Indiana, and settled in the Los Feliz – East Hollywood area (Cumberland Ave). They had three children: Daniel, Alex and Freddie (who died in 2001). The two divorced in the late 1990s.

His health food store and organic restaurant &quot;Health Hut&quot; was one of the first of its kind and was patronized by dozens of Hollywood celebrities in the early 1960s.

The original Health Hut, located on Beverly Blvd. just west of La Cienega Blvd., had an authentic &quot;tiki&quot; style to it, being made with leaves and bamboo.

Bootzin personally advocated never eating meat, drinking alcohol, or smoking tobacco. He was an early believer in the health properties of organic foods. One of these organic foods was garlic—and he later became a spokesperson for the &quot;Kyolic&quot; variety. He also did work for a Sonoma cheese factory. He would often have a garlic-spiced cheese, &quot;Sonoma Jack&quot;, at his booth at health festivals and fairs in Sonoma Valley, along with his all-natural, sugar-free &quot;Boots Bars&quot;, wheat grass, spirulina, and kyolic garlic, as well as &quot;honey-sweet&quot; Medjool dates from his grove.

His childhood vegetarian lifestyle was something Bootzin continued with his own family, as his son Daniel Bootzin corroborated:

Bootzin died in Camarillo, California, just 11 days short of his 90th birthday. He was survived by his former wife, Lois Bootzin, a Lutheran, two of his sons (Daniel and Alexander), three grandchildren, and a sister. His son Freddie died in 2001.

== Appearances ==
Bootzin received national exposure in 1955 when he appeared as a contestant on Groucho Marx&#x27;s network TV show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; (September 30, 1955, Season 5 Episode 3). Introduced as &quot;Robert Bootzin,&quot; he cheerfully espoused his philosophy of clean living, exercise, and healthy eating. Even though he was over 40, he acted like a gangling, goofy, but polite teenager, causing mildly sensational reactions from the audience. When asked by Groucho to demonstrate how he sold figs, he stepped toward the edge of the stage, shouted an attention-getting sales pitch for a few seconds, and then performed a perfect pratfall (the type where one falls sideways after swinging one leg to knock the other one out from underneath). In the game portion of the show, he spelled the word &quot;intelligible&quot; incorrectly before his partner overruled him. Groucho, who usually displayed little tolerance for extremists, admired Bootzin&#x27;s rugged individualism and said so, on camera. He also seemed to appreciate the perfect execution of one of vaudeville&#x27;s classic bits.

His wife appeared on the same programme a few years later with a man who worked as an organ grinder with 13 children who had a monkey that looked and walked like Groucho. She appeared very conservative and polite and nothing like her former husband&#x27;s appearance, who was as described above. She recalled how she met him while she practiced her ballet on a beach. Bootzin was standing on his head. She found his antics interesting enough to approach him, and the relationship developed from there. Her connection with him was not mentioned on the show and, perhaps because of the organ grinder, may have been overlooked due to time and Groucho&#x27;s interest in the monkey act.

Bootzin made personal appearances with the Spike Jones musical-comedy troupe, speaking about health foods. He was a regular guest on American television talk shows in the 1960s, appearing 25 times on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;. On the Allen show he would often play up his role as a health advocate by swinging from a vine on stage as a &quot;Nature Boy&quot;, and persuade Steve to drink one of &quot;Gypsy Boots&#x27;&quot; concocted fruit health drinks. He referred to this drink as a &quot;smoothie&quot;, giving credence to Gypsy Boots as one of the originators of the popular style of blended natural fruit health drinks. He also made frequent appearances on &quot;George Putnam&#x27;s Talk Back&quot;, which came at the tail end of the popular KTLA &quot;George Putnam News&quot; in Los Angeles, California.

He released a record album, &quot;Unpredictable&quot;, on Sidewalk Records in 1968.

Gypsy loved to participate in parades, including the annual, wildly creative and noncommercial Santa Barbara Summer Solstice Parade. Boots appeared at the Annual Calabasas Pumpkin Festival in 1973. Even in his late 80s he would energetically dance, make music, and holler all the way up the parade route for a couple of miles. He would show up for weekly farmers&#x27; markets in his wildly painted van promoting kyolic garlic, and would always be a showman with the gift of gab, giving out free garlic samples. Bootzin also participated in several Fourth of July parades in the town of Sonoma, California, in the late 1990s and/or early 2000s, throwing a football to a fellow participant.

Bootzin was an avid fan of the USC Trojans football team and was known for eccentric clothes and an ever-present cowbell. He also regularly attended Los Angeles Dodgers, Lakers and Raiders games with spirited cheers, noisemakers and streamers. At age 86, he was still able to throw an American football at least 40 yards.

In movies, Bootzin appears sitting in the diner scene in Michael Douglas&#x27;s film &quot;The Game&quot;. Other movie appearances include &quot;Mondo Hollywood&quot;, &quot;A Swingin&#x27; Summer,&quot; and &quot;Confessions of Tom Harris&quot;, and he can be seen quite frequently at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. Bootzin also appeared as a guest emcee at the Newport Pop Festival in August 1968. The Newport Pop was the first festival to draw over 100,000 in attendance. Bootzin also helped with the promotion of the two-day event at the Orange County Fairgrounds. Bootzin enjoyed mingling with the performers, including Sonny and Cher, The Jefferson Airplane, The Grateful Dead, Tiny Tim, Eric Burdon and the Animals, Canned Heat, and a dozen other great acts of the day.

Bootzin&#x27;s son, Dan, appeared on Dan Harmon&#x27;s &quot;Harmontown&quot; podcast with his wife Beth, discussing the status of their beloved eucalyptus trees.

Bootzin was warmly remembered by comedian Billy Saluga (whose comic character was named Raymond J. Johnson, Jr.: &quot;You can call me Ray! Or you can call me Jay!&quot;) on the December 11, 2017, episode of &quot;Gilbert Gottfried&#x27;s Amazing Colossal Podcast&quot;.

<text>Early mail sent to and from the Caroline Islands was occasional and dependent on visiting ships.

==German control==

The Spanish authorities issued no postage stamps or postmarks for the islands. Germany rapidly set up a postal system once awarded the islands; having received the Carolines on 1 June 1899 as part of the German–Spanish Treaty (1899), on 12 October German stamps overprinted &quot;Karolinen&quot; were issued. At first, the overprint was angled at 48 degrees, then a few months later the angle of the text was changed to 56 degrees. Few examples of these, at either angle, survive today, especially in cancelled condition.

By 1900, Yap and Ponape were stops on a regular mail run between German New Guinea and Hong Kong. Initially, the service was operated by the Reich Mail Steamer Lines, with the help of government subsidies, then in 1902 the Jaluit Company took over.

These stamps are the subject of a fictional discussion between Erwin Rommel and one of the other characters in the movie Raid on Rommel

==Yacht stamps==

In January 1901, Germany issued its Yacht stamps with a common design for all of Germany&#x27;s colonies, featuring the Kaiser&#x27;s yacht &quot;Hohenzollern&quot;. The issues for the Carolines featured the inscription &quot;KAROLINEN&quot;, all with mark and pfennig denominations. Many unused copies of the low values still exist today, left over after the Japanese occupation, but as one might expect from the short period of German rule and the very small numbers of letter-writers living in the Carolines, genuinely used stamps are uncommon, typically priced 5–20 times higher than unused.

In 1905 the stock of 5pf stamps was destroyed in a typhoon, and 10pf stamps were bisected. Another shortage in 1910 resulted in bisects of 20pf stamps, and 3pf stamps surcharged to 5pf.

==Japanese occupation==
Japan occupied the islands in October 1914, after which Japanese stamps were used until the end of World War II. Germany printed Yacht stamps for the Carolines as late as 1919, on paper with lozenge watermarks, but none were ever used on mail.

The islands became part of the U.S. Trust Territory of the Pacific in 1944 and used U.S. stamps until 1983.

<doc id="891916" wikidata="Q7233915" url="?curid=891916" title="Postage stamps and postal history of Tanganyika">
<text>This is a survey of the [[postage stamp]]s and [[postal history]] of [[Tanganyika Territory|Tanganyika]] under British mandate.

==First stamps==
The first postage stamps of Tanganyika were stamps of the East Africa and Uganda Protectorates overprinted &quot;&quot; (for German East Africa), used in 1921 and 1922. These are superficially identical to the last occupation issues of German East Africa, but the presence of the &quot;Crown and Script CA&quot; watermark shows they were issued after the civil administration took over from the military, and are thus properly considered the first issues of Tanganyika.

==Later issues==
In 1922, the government issued a series of 19 stamps inscribed &quot;&quot;, featuring the head of a giraffe, denominated in cents, shillings and pounds (100 cents to a shilling, 20 shillings to a pound), with several colour changes in 1925. The changes were because there were many power changes, with each leader wanting a different color.

This was followed in 1927 by a second series of 16 values in a more conventional design with a profile of King George V and inscribed &quot;&quot;.

In 1927, Tanganyika entered the Customs Union of Kenya and Uganda, as well as the East African Postal Union. Between 1935 and 1963, stamps of the combined postal administration (East African Posts and Telecommunications Administration) inscribed &quot;Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika&quot; were in use.

==Independence==
Shortly after independence in 1961, the new state of Tanganyika issued a series of commemorative stamps inscribed &quot;&quot;.

This was followed by a final commemorative issue on December 9, 1962, with four stamps inscribed &quot;&quot; (&quot;Republic of Tanganyika&quot;) to commemorate the founding of the republic.

Tanganyika ceased to exist as a nation in 1964, when it was loosely united with Zanzibar, to form the nation of Tanzania. Stamps of the East African postal administration remained valid until well after the formation of Tanzania.

<doc id="891923" wikidata="Q12915" url="?curid=891923" title="Amata Kabua">
<text>[[Iroijlaplap]] Amata Kabua (November 17, 1928 – December 19, 1996) was the first President of the Marshall Islands from 1979 until his death in 1996 (five consecutive terms).

==Background==
Amata Kabua was a scion of Marshallese Royalty. Amata Kabua is the son of high chiefess Tarjikit of the Eastern (Ratak chain) and rumoured to be a Japanese administrator by his political opponents. This was disputed by his father Lejolan Kabua. However, by Marshallese custom of &quot;kujen loje&quot; (nobleman of birth), High Chief Lojelañ of the Ralik (Western) chain claimed Amata as his own in the same manner Loeak the Great adopted Lajore and Litilinej, probably because Laelan of Arno who is Dorothy Kabua&#x27;s father was Kabua&#x27;s biological child however, under &quot;kujen loje&quot;, Laelan of Arno was adopted by Takto just as Laelan Kabua of the Erroja clan was adopted by Kabua (Lebon) under the same tradition as was Leit who was claimed by Iroij Bwio Jiba. Ironically, the &quot;kujen loe&quot; concept applied to Albert Loeak who was not the biological son of Lobokkij Loeak despite what many are led to believe as it also applied to Imata Kabua, Manini Kabua, Anjojo Kabua, Mike Kabua, Kabua Kabua, Laelan Kabua, Anjua Loeak, etc. but despite Amata&#x27;s political visibility, he is more referenced, it is possible that racism is to blame as is political jealousy which is common in Marshallese politics.

Amata&#x27;s father Chief (Iroij) Lejolañ Kabua was the son of Paramount Chief Iroij Bwio Jeimata Kabua of Northern Ralik (Western) Chain. Jeimata Kabua was the son of King Kabua the Great (nicknamed King John) with Leroij Bwio LiWodin. Kabua is also known as King John, who, on behalf of his father Iroij Bwio Jiba, led diplomatic relations between Germany and the Marshall Islands in 1885 through the Treaty of Friendship.

Amata Kabua&#x27;s mother, Leroij Dorothy Tarjikit, was a paramount chieftain of Majuro with royal connections to the Rimwejoor and Raano clans who ruled the entire Ratak (eastern) chain but later lost Mejit. Tarjikit was regarded as a pure-blooded royal in equal rank to Jeimata Kabua and his father Kabua the Great because of her Bwio status. Tarjikit&#x27;s father was a paramount chieftain named Laelañ of the Rimwejoor Clan in Arno and her mother was Leroij Bwio Maria of the Raano Clan of Majuro. Tarjikit&#x27;s father High Chief Laelañ of the Ratak/Eastern chain is not to be confused with Bwirak Laelañ from the Erroja clan who was the stepson of Kabua the Great as liBwirak Neimekua was already pregnant with son Laelan Kabua when entering the Kabua household. The rule of incest was prevalent within this family and it was a key marriage alliance structure that allowed continued dominance through familial loyalties under the plain basis of existential circumstance. Jeimata&#x27;s parents Leroij Pwieo Worin and Iroij Bwio Kabua were first cousins as were Tarjikit&#x27;s parents Laelañ and Maria. And by extension, Tarjikit and Lejolan were first cousins also.

While Kabua the Great welcomed the Protestant missionaries safely on Ebon by offering his protection in 1850s under the guidance of his uncle Kaibuke thereby solidifying a royal connection to the Protestant faith, Tarjikit helped found the Catholic church in the Capital of the Marshall Islands thereby solidifying a royal connection to the Catholic faith.

Tarjikit was also the first indigenous Micronesian of the Trust Territory ever to attend a United Nations Trusteeship Council meeting in 1953 with her son Amata as interpreter. While Amata&#x27;s mother became the first indigenous Micronesian to visit the United Nations, his father Lejolañ was the first Marshallese to visit the White House when he met with President Lyndon B. Johnson.

==Career==
Amata began his career as a school teacher then as a Superintendent to Schools along with Chief Clerk for the House of Iroij in the 1950s. He was elected to the Council of Micronesia as a Representative and later as Senator to the Congress of Micronesia in 1963 where he also served one term as president for the Congress of Micronesia. Amata Kabua was the first president of the Marshall Islands in 1979 when its first constitution was implemented. That day was his 51st birthday. After his older brother Joba Kabua died in 1982, Amata Kabua inherited the Iroijlaplap title for Majuro Atoll in the domain of Kaibuke Tobinwa and certain parts of the Ralik Chain of the Marshall Islands in the domain of Jeimata Kabua. He later became the first president of the Marshall Islands when the nation received full independence in free association with the United States through the compact. He had been a principal participant in the negotiations to gain independence for the Marshall Islands and is regarded as the founding father of the modern nation by Marshallese. He wrote the words for the national anthem, &quot;Forever Marshall Islands&quot;.

Amata Kabua was the son of a paramount chief of the Ralik Chain and a paramount chieftain of the Ratak Chain. He died in office after a long illness, on December 19, 1996, in Hawaii. He chose to be buried in his family property in Long Island going against royal burial traditions of Ralik &amp; Ratak Chains as his Ralik family wanted him to be buried in the royal cemetery in Bouj, Ailinglaplap while his Majuro Kin wanted him to be buried in the royal cemetery in Laura. He chose to be buried in his family property in Long Island so his wife Emlain Kabua who is a commoner of the Ijidrik clan can be buried next to him because as a commoner, she will never be allowed to be buried in the royal cemetery in Laura, but her great-grandmother Limurelok (Kabua&#x27;s wife) was buried in Bouj, Ailinglaplap in the Kabua cemetery. (Amata&#x27;s older brother Joba Kabua also permitted his wife Jauni to be buried in the royal cemetery in Laura. However, due to certain restrictions, Jauni was not allowed her own space and thus shared the same burial spot with Joba Kabua having been buried on top of each other).

<text>William Doolin (1858–August 24, 1896) was an American bandit outlaw and founder of the Wild Bunch, sometimes known as the Doolin-Dalton Gang. Like the earlier Dalton Gang alone, it specialized in robbing banks, trains, and stagecoaches in Arkansas, Kansas, Indiana, and Oklahoma during the 1890s.

==Early life==

Doolin was born in 1858 in Johnson County, Arkansas, to Michael Doolin and the former Artemina Beller. Doolin left home in 1881 to become a cowboy in Indian Territory, where he worked for cattleman Oscar Halsell, a Texas native. During this time, Doolin worked with other cowboy and outlaw names of the day, including George Newcomb (known as &quot;Bitter Creek&quot;), Charley Pierce, Bill Power, Dick Broadwell, Bill &quot;Tulsa Jack&quot; Blake, Dan &quot;Dynamite Dick&quot; Clifton, Billie &quot;Little Bill&quot; Raidler and the better-known Emmett Dalton.

Doolin&#x27;s first encounter with the law came on July 4, 1891, in Coffeyville in southeastern Kansas. Doolin and some friends were drunk in public, and lawmen attempted to confiscate their alcohol. A shootout ensued, and two of the lawmen were wounded. Doolin escaped capture by fleeing. 

== Dalton Gang ==
Shortly thereafter, Doolin became a member of the Dalton Gang. On October 5, 1892, the Dalton Gang tried to rob two banks simultaneously in Coffeyville. It was an utter failure. Coffeyville residents and lawmen rallied in a shootout against the outlaws, resulting in four of the five gang members being killed. Emmett Dalton was captured and convicted at trial, and imprisoned. Historians have speculated that a sixth gang member was in town, holding the horses in an alley, and escaped. The sixth man has never been identified. Some speculate that he may have been Bill Doolin.

== Wild Bunch ==

In late 1892, Doolin formed his own gang, the Wild Bunch. On November 1, 1892, the gang robbed a bank in Spearville, Kansas. After the robbery, the gang fled with gang member Oliver Yantis to Oklahoma Territory, where they hid out at the house of Yantis&#x27;s sister. Less than a month later, the gang was tracked to that location. In a shootout, Yantis was killed, but the rest of the gang escaped.

Two teenaged girls, known as Little Britches and Cattle Annie, also followed the gang as bandits. They warned the men whenever law-enforcement officers were in pursuit. Sources indicate that Doolin gave bandit Jennie Stevens her nickname of Little Britches.

Following the Spearville robbery, the gang embarked on a spree of successful bank and train robberies. In March 1893, Doolin married Edith Ellsworth in Ingalls, Oklahoma. Shortly thereafter, Doolin and his gang robbed a train near Cimarron, Kansas. During a shootout with lawmen, Doolin was shot and seriously wounded in the foot. He retreated to Ingalls.

On September 1, 1893, 14 deputy U.S. marshals entered Ingalls to apprehend the gang. The armed confrontation became known as the Battle of Ingalls. During the shootout, three marshals and two bystanders were killed, one bystander was wounded, three of the gang members were wounded, and gang member &quot;Arkansas Tom Jones&quot; was wounded and captured. Doolin shot and killed Deputy Marshal Richard Speed during that shootout.

For a time, the Wild Bunch was the most powerful outlaw group in the Old West. Because of the relentless pursuit by the deputy marshals known as the Three Guardsmen (lawmen Bill Tilghman, Chris Madsen, and Heck Thomas), by the end of 1894, they had either captured or killed many of the gang. In late 1894, gang member Bill Dalton was killed by U.S. marshals. Rewards were offered for the capture or death of remaining gang members, a lure that sometimes turned friends into foes to collect the money. On May 1, 1895, gang members Charlie Pierce and George &quot;Bittercreek&quot; Newcomb were shot and killed by bounty hunters known as the Dunn brothers. They were the older brothers of Rose Dunn, the teenaged girlfriend of Newcomb. Allegedly, she had betrayed Newcomb, but her brothers may have trailed her to the outlaws&#x27; hideout.

Doolin fled to New Mexico Territory, where he hid with outlaw Richard &quot;Little Dick&quot; West during the summer of 1895. In late 1895, Doolin and his wife hid out near Burden, Kansas. They went over the border to visit the resort community of Eureka Springs in northwestern Arkansas. There, Doolin soaked in the sulfur springs in the bathhouses; the waters relieved the rheumatism in his foot that set in after an earlier gunshot. In early 1896, Doolin was captured in a bathhouse by deputy marshal Bill Tilghman.
Doolin escaped from jail on July 5, and took refuge with his wife in Lawson in the Oklahoma Territory. There, on August 24, Doolin was killed by a shotgun blast in a confrontation with Deputy U.S. Marshal Heck Thomas.

Bill Doolin is buried next to outlaw Elmer McCurdy, in the Boot Hill section of Summit View Cemetery in Guthrie, Oklahoma. 

By the end of 1898, all but one of the remaining former Wild Bunch gang were dead, having been killed in various shootouts with lawmen. Heck Thomas had tracked most of them; the remainder were tracked down and eliminated by lawmen Madsen and Tilghman, or other posses. The only survivor of the Wild Bunch was &quot;Little Bill&quot; Raidler (aka Radler) who had been shot and captured by Tilghman in Osage territory near Caney Creek on September 6, 1895. Little Billie had split from the gang after the Rock Island robbery near Dover. Near death, Billie was nursed back to health and stood trial in Kingfisher, Ok. He was permanently crippled, but sent to the Ohio Penitentiary near Columbus. He was released for poor health in 1892 and returned to western Oklahoma where he married his girlfriend, Blanch Whitenack on Nov.19, 1902 in Taloga, Oklahoma. He died an early, natural death in about 1910. 
== In popular media ==
* Burt Lancaster portrayed Doolin in the film &quot;Cattle Annie and Little Britches&quot; (1981). Lancaster was 65 during the shooting of the film, but was playing Doolin in his 30s. 
* In the film &quot;Return of the Bad Men&quot; (1948), Robert Armstrong plays Doolin as the leader of a gang more powerful than the Wild Bunch. This fictional account added the Sundance Kid, Billy the Kid, and two of the Younger brothers to the known members of Doolin&#x27;s gang. Randolph Scott, as Marshal Vance Cordrell, is a fictional composite of the many lawmen who pursued Doolin. 
* Randolph Scott portrayed Bill Doolin in the film &quot;The Doolins of Oklahoma&quot; (1949)
* War hero Audie Murphy played a fictionalized Bill Doolin in the film &quot;The Cimarron Kid&quot; (1952).
* Leo Gordon portrayed Doolin in a 1954 episode of Jim Davis&#x27;s syndicated television series, &quot;Stories of the Century&quot;. The dramatization concludes with Doolin being shot to death after an earlier escape. Heck Thomas in &quot;Stories of the Century&quot; is referred to as Deputy Marshal Gleason, played by Kenneth MacDonald.
* In the TV movie &quot;You Know My Name&quot;, Marshal Bill Tilghman, played by Sam Elliott, tells his sons how he arrested Doolin, who is played by James Baker.
* The Eagles album &quot;Desperado&quot; contains two tracks titled &quot;Doolin-Dalton&quot; and one named &quot;Bitter Creek&quot;. The album is loosely themed around the Dalton Gang.

<text>In computer software, a general-purpose programming language (GPL) is a programming language for building software in a wide variety of application domains. Conversely, a domain-specific programming language (DSL) is used within a specific area. For example, Python is a GPL, while SQL is a DSL for querying relational databases.

==History==

Early programming languages were designed for scientific computing (numerical calculations) or commercial data processing, as was computer hardware. Scientific languages such as Fortran and Algol supported floating-point calculations and multidimensional arrays, while business languages such as COBOL supported fixed-field file formats and data records. Much less widely used were specialized languages such as IPL-V and LISP for symbolic list processing; COMIT for string manipulation; APT for numerically controlled machines. Systems programming requiring pointer manipulation was typically done in assembly language, though JOVIAL was used for some military applications.

IBM&#x27;s System/360, announced in 1964, was designed as a unified hardware architecture supporting both scientific and commercial applications, and IBM developed PL/I for it as a single, general-purpose language that supported scientific, commercial, and systems programming. Indeed, a subset of PL/I was used as the standard systems programming language for the Multics operating system.

Since PL/I, the distinction between scientific and commercial programming languages has diminished, with most languages supporting the basic features required by both, and much of the special file format handling delegated to specialized database management systems.

Many specialized languages were also developed starting in the 1960s: GPSS and Simula for discrete event simulation; MAD, BASIC, Logo, and Pascal for teaching programming; C for systems programming; JOSS and APL\360 for interactive programming.

== GPL vs. DSL ==
The distinction between general-purpose programming languages and domain-specific programming languages is not always clear. A programming language may be created for a specific task, but used beyond that original domain and thus be considered a general purpose programming language. For example, COBOL, Fortran, and Lisp were created as DSLs (for business processing, numeric computation, and symbolic processing), but became GPL&#x27;s over time. Inversely, a language may be designed for general use but only applied in a specific area in practice. A programming language that is well suited for a problem, whether it be general-purpose language or DSL, should minimize the level of detail required while still being expressive enough in the problem domain. As the name suggests, general-purpose language is &quot;general&quot; in that it cannot provide support for domain-specific notation while DSLs can be designed in diverse problem domains to handle this problem. General-purpose languages are preferred to DSLs when an application domain is not well understood enough to warrant its own language. In this case, a general-purpose language with an appropriate library of data types and functions for the domain may be used instead. While DSLs are usually smaller than GPL in that they offer a smaller range of notations of abstractions, some DSLs actually contain an entire GPL as a sublanguage. In these instances, the DSLs are able to offer domain-specific expressive power along with the expressive power of GPL.

General Purpose programming languages are all Turing complete, meaning that they can theoretically solve any computational problem. Domain-specific languages are often similarly Turing complete but are not exclusively so.

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
General-purpose programming languages are more commonly used by programmers. According to a study, C, Python, and Java were the most commonly used programming languages in 2021. One argument in favor of using general-purpose programming languages over domain-specific languages is that more people will be familiar with these languages, overcoming the need to learn a new language.

Additionally, for many tasks (e.g., statistical analysis, machine learning, etc.) there are libraries that are extensively tested and optimized. Theoretically, the presence of these libraries should bridge the gap between general-purpose and domain-specific languages.

An empirical study in 2010 sought to measure problem-solving and productivity between GPLs and DSLs by giving users problems who were familiar with the GPL (C#) and unfamiliar with the DSL (XAML). Ultimately, users of this specific domain-specific language performed better by a factor of 15%, even though they were more familiar with GPL, warranting further research.
== Examples ==

=== C ===
The predecessor to C, B, was developed largely for a specific purpose: systems programming. By contrast, C has found use in a variety of computational domains, such as operating systems, device drivers, application software, and embedded systems.

C is suitable for use in a variety of areas because of its generality. It provides economy of expression, flow control, data structures, and a rich set of operators, but does not constrain its users to use it in any one context. As a result, though it was first used by its creators to rewrite the kernel of the Unix operating system, it was easily adapted for use in application development, embedded systems (e.g., microprocessor programming), video games (e.g., Doom), and so on. Today, C remains one of the most popular and widely-used programming languages.

=== C++ ===
Conceived as an extension to C, C++ introduced object-oriented features, as well as other conveniences like references, operator overloading, and default arguments. Like C, C++&#x27;s generality allowed it to be used in a wide range of areas. While its C++&#x27;s core area of application is in systems programming (because of C++&#x27;s ability to grant access to low-level architecture), it has been used extensively to build desktop applications, video games, databases, financial systems, and much more. Major software and finance companies, such as Microsoft, Apple, Bloomberg, and Morgan Stanley, still widely use C++ in their internal and external applications.

=== Python ===
Python was conceived as a language that emphasized code readability and extensibility. The former allowed non-software engineers to easily learn and write computer programs, while the latter allowed domain specialists to easily create libraries suited to their own use cases. For these reasons, Python has been used across a wide range of domains.

Below are some of the areas where Python is used:

* Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask have allowed web developers to create robust web servers that can also take advantage of the wider Python ecosystem.
* Science and Academia: Scientific and data libraries, like SciPy and Pandas, have enabled Python&#x27;s use in scientific research.
* Machine Learning: Libraries like scikit-learn and Tensorflow have increased the accessibility of machine learning to developers.
* General Software Development: Developing user applications, web scraping programs, games, and other general software.

<text>A privately run packet service for mail existed in British Guiana in 1796, and continued for a number of years. Postage stamps of Britain were used in those days at Georgetown (Demerara) and Berbice. The first adhesive stamps produced by British Guiana were issued in 1850.

British Guiana is famous among philatelists for its early postage stamps, some of them considered to be among the rarest, most expensive stamps in the world. These include the unique British Guiana 1c magenta from 1856, which sold in 1980 for close to $1 million.

In June 2014 the 1856 British Guiana one-cent magenta stamp was sold at auction in New York, to an anonymous bidder, for $9.5m (£5.6m) at auction in New York, a world record.

== Independence ==

In 1966 the country achieved independence from the United Kingdom, and changed its name to Guyana. Later stamps were issued by Guyana.

<text>This is a survey of the [[postage stamps]] and [[postal history]] of [[British East Africa]].

Britain had interests in this area as early as 1824. Missionaries are known to have settled in the area in 1844. The Imperial British East Africa Company obtained a concession in 1887 to administer this area, from Sultan Bargash of the Sultanate of Zanzibar. The company started to experience financial difficulties in 1891. The situation was made more difficult in 1892 when Britain declared the Sultanate of Zanzibar part of the Congo Free Trade Zone and thus depriving the company of import duties. On 1 July 1895, the British government took over the administration of this area when the company was facing bankruptcy.

== Pre-stamp era ==
The early missionaries in British East Africa sent letters by runner to forwarding agents in Zanzibar. Letters are known from as early as 1848. From 1875 mail was sent via the Indian post office which had been opened in Zanzibar.

== Imperial British East Africa Company administration ==

The Imperial British East Africa Company was the first company holding a Royal Charter allowing operation of a postal system, for both local and international mail, to use their company name on their stamps. They were also the first to create a series of surcharged stamps with authorizing initials. Both of these led to the adoption of these practices by other countries such as the British South Africa Company and the Mozambique Company in 1892 and the surcharged Uganda typewritten stamps in 1895.

The Imperial British East Africa Company set up post offices at Mombasa and Lamu in May 1890. The first stamps issued, on 23 May 1890, were surcharges on British postage stamps with values of ½, 1 and 4 annas and .

During an acute shortage of stamps in August and September, 1890 stamps of India were used and are known postmarked &#x27;MOMBASA&#x27; or &#x27;LAMU&#x27;. It is alleged that an agent of stamp dealer Whitfield King bought up all the stocks in the post offices.

The British East Africa Company issued stamps, on 14 October 1890, using a symbolic sun and crown design and inscribed , all valued in annas and rupees.

Shortages, of some values, between 1891 and 1895 resulted in a variety of surcharges being produced.

== British administration ==
On 9 July 1895 stamps of Imperial British East Africa Company were overprinted reading and overprints of &#x27;British / East / Africa&#x27; on stamps of India were also issued. The protectorate joined the Universal Postal Union at this time.

In 1896 a series of stamps depicting Queen Victoria was issued, inscribed , these ran short in 1897 and stamps of Zanzibar were overprinted as the stamps of India had been previously. A number of additional post offices were opened along the Uganda Railway, which was started in 1896 at Mombasa and reached Kisumu on Lake Victoria in 1902.

In 1901 the postal administration was merged with that of Uganda, and in 1904 stamps issued for the combined East Africa and Uganda Protectorates came into use.

== Postal stationery ==
Imperial British East Africa Company Administration
All postal stationery items were inscribed . Two different sizes of registration envelopes were issued in 1891; produced by Bradbury, Wilkinson &amp; Co. Three different sizes of pre paid 2½ annas envelopes were issued in 1893. Two postcards were made available in 1893; ½ anna and 1 anna.

British administration

In 1895 one of the sizes of Imperial British East Africa Company envelopes was overprinted . In 1896 Two different envelopes were produced by overprinting envelopes from India with &#x27;British East Africa&#x27;; 2½ annas on 4½ annas envelope and 2 annas 6 pies. Also in 1896 2½ annas envelopes were printed by De la Rue and inscribed .

In 1895 Imperial British East Africa Company registration envelopes was overprinted . These were followed by 2 annas registration envelopes, in two different sizes, from India being overprinted &#x27;British East Africa&#x27;. Finally, two sizes of registration envelopes, printed by De la Rue, were made available.

Four different newspaper wrappers were issued during 1896. Two were produced by overprinting Indian ½ anna and 1 anna wrappers with &#x27;British East Africa&#x27; and two, ½ anna and 1 anna, were printed by De la Rue.

A total of eight different postcards were produced with a face value of ½ anna or 1 anna. Two were by overprinting Imperial British East Africa Company postcards, two were by overprinting Indian postcards and the remaining ones were printed by De la Rue.

<text>Gilberto François &quot;Betico&quot; Croes (; 25 January 1938 – 26 November 1986) was an Aruban political activist who was a proponent for Aruba&#x27;s separation from the Netherlands Antilles. This eventually occurred in 1986, but following a car accident on 31 December 1985 (the night of &quot;status aparte&quot;), Croes lapsed into a coma and 
never became conscious to see his accomplishment. He is best remembered as &quot;Libertador&quot; (liberator) and as the father of the Aruban people.

==Biography and career==
Croes was born on 25 January 1938, in Santa Cruz. After finishing high school, he studied in the Netherlands at the Teacher&#x27;s Training College in Hilversum and received his headmaster&#x27;s certificate in 1959.

In 1967, Croes first participated in the island council of Aruba as a member of the Aruban People&#x27;s Party (AVP) and was elected. He resigned in July 1970 after the AVP had decided not to give a seat to the UNA.

In February 1971, Croes founded the political party People&#x27;s Electoral Movement (Movimiento Electoral di Pueblo), and was elected to the island council. In 1973, the MEP won 5 of the 8 seats for Aruba in the Estates of the Netherlands Antilles. In 1976 he was the person responsible for the Seal Flag and National Anthem of the island of Aruba. It was co-written by renowned Padu Del Caribe (Padu Lampe), and Rufo Wever, who also composed the anthem.

===Background===
In 1954, the Netherlands Antilles became a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and was given self-government. Aruba is the second most populous island, however, Curaçao is the largest and most populous island. Aruba had 8 seats in the Estates of the Netherlands Antilles, Curaçao had 12 seats, Bonaire had one seat, and Saba, Sint Eustatius, and Sint Maarten shared a single seat. The Capital of the Netherlands Antilles was Willemstad, Curaçao.

===Struggle for independence===
In 1977, Croes organized a referendum regarding Aruba&#x27;s independence. The Aruban Patriotic Party (PPA) announced a boycott of the referendum, and the Government of the Netherlands Antilles declared the referendum illegal, and announced, prior to the referendum, that it was not willing to accept the results. In the March 1977 referendum, 95% of the voters were in favor of independence.

In June 1977, Boy Rozendal of the Democratic Party of Curaçao won a clear victory in the elections in the Netherlands Antilles. No former was assigned to create a new cabinet instead Rozendal, who was an opponent of Aruban autonomy, installed his coalition without consulting the MEP. Croes announced demonstrations and a boycott of Curaçaoan products.

On 11 August 1977, a general strike (1977 Aruba general strike) shut down the island during which the riot police made multiple charges. On 18 August, the union leaders were arrested and the strike ended, however, Prime Minister Joop den Uyl of the Netherlands started a dialogue because the situation had spun out of control.
In February 1981, at the Round Table Conference, Croes formally set Aruba&#x27;s Independence for 1991, however the Round Table Conference of 1983, resulted in a proposed new Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands in which Aruba would have a &quot;Status Aparte&quot; making it a constituent country within the Kingdom in 1986, and possible independence in 1996.

On 24 April 1983, Croes was shot in the stomach by police officer Libier. Libier was transferred to Bonaire in June, In November, the Public Prosecution Service decided not to charge him, because there was no proof that he had aimed at Croes.

In July 1985 the charter, as agreed in March 1983, in Aruba&#x27;s Decolonization and Independence Agreement, was unanimously approved by the island council of Aruba, however, the PPA boycotted the vote. The &quot;Status Aparte&quot; would take effect on 1 January 1986.

In the 1980s Croes recommended that Aruba should target tourism in order to diversify the economy since it depended mainly on the refinery. He was also responsible for major projects for the people of Aruba, like the housing company FCCA, and the transportation company Arubus,

=== 1985 elections and death ===
In November 1985, the MEP lost the election, and Henny Eman of the Aruban People&#x27;s Party (AVP) would become the first Prime Minister of Aruba.

On 31 December 1985, Croes was in a traffic accident and lapsed into a coma. Croes died on 26 November 1986 in a reactivation and nursing center in Utrecht, Netherlands. His remains were flown to Aruba for burial. An estimated 40,000 people attended his funeral (Aruba had an estimated 65,000 inhabitants in 1985).

A famous quote from him is &quot;Si mi cai na caminda, gara e bandera y sigui cu e lucha&quot; (If I fall along the way, grab the flag and continue the battle).

==Personal life==
Croes had four children: two sons—Glenbert Croes and Gilberto Junior Croes and two daughters—Glendeline Croes and Guisette Croes.

Both of Croes&#x27; sons served as Ministers and Glenbert is as of 2021 in office as Minister of Labor, Integration and Energy.

==Legacy==
* is celebrated on his birthday of 25 January as a national holiday.
*The 18 Maart Plein in Oranjestad was renamed Plaza Betico Croes.
*&quot;Caya G. F. Betico Croes&quot; is named after him and is the main shopping street of Oranjestad, the Aruban capital.

<text>This is a survey of the [[postage stamps]] and [[postal history]] of Zululand under British rule.

The Zulu Kingdom was defeated by Britain in the Anglo-Zulu War and was annexed as a British territory in 1887. For a brief period, it operated its own postal system and had its own postage stamps.

==First post office==
A Natal postal agency was established in Eshowe in 1876 (closed between 1879 and 1885), but an official postal system was not started until 1 May 1888, at which time both Zululand and neighbouring Natal became members of the Universal Postal Union. At first, the territory used postage stamps of Great Britain and Natal overprinted &quot;ZULULAND&quot;.

==Key type stamps==
A series of ten definitive issues in the key plate style with a profile of Queen Victoria, inscribed &quot;ZULULAND&quot; appeared in 1894 and were in use at 21 post offices. These stamps ranged in denomination from 1/2 penny to five pounds.

==Annexation==
Zululand was annexed by Natal on 31 December 1897, and separate stamps were discontinued on 30 June 1898.

<text>The Kionga Triangle was a tiny territory on the border between German East Africa (present-day United Republic of Tanzania) and the Portuguese colony of Mozambique (present day Republic of Mozambique), originally Portuguese, but occupied by German forces in 1894, and recaptured by the Portuguese forces in 1916. The triangle was the only German territory that the post-war Treaty of Versailles awarded to Portugal.

On May 29, 1916, 100-reis postage stamps from Lourenço Marques were overprinted with &quot;KIONGA&quot; and one of the denominations ½c, 1c, 2½c, and 5c. These were the only stamps issued for Kionga. Most of the stock of the Marques stamps lacked gum, and in 2013, the Scott Catalogue listed the average purchase price of a high-quality set without gum at US$ 97.50. Examples with original gum will command a premium.

<doc id="891942" wikidata="Q1502023" url="?curid=891942" title="Soundex">
<text>Soundex is a phonetic algorithm for indexing names by sound, as pronounced in English. The goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling. The algorithm mainly encodes consonants; a vowel will not be encoded unless it is the first letter. Soundex is the most widely known of all phonetic algorithms (in part because it is a standard feature of popular database software such as IBM Db2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Ingres, MS SQL Server, Oracle, ClickHouse, Snowflake and SAP ASE.) Improvements to Soundex are the basis for many modern phonetic algorithms.

==History==
Soundex was developed by Robert C. Russell and Margaret King Odell and patented in 1918 and 1922. A variation, American Soundex, was used in the 1930s for a retrospective analysis of the US censuses from 1890 through 1920. The Soundex code came to prominence in the 1960s when it was the subject of several articles in the &quot;Communications&quot; and &quot;Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery&quot;, and especially when described in Donald Knuth&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;.

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) maintains the current rule set for the official implementation of Soundex used by the U.S. government. These encoding rules are available from NARA, upon request, in the form of General Information Leaflet 55, &quot;Using the Census Soundex&quot;.

==American Soundex==
The Soundex code for a name consists of a letter followed by three numerical digits: the letter is the first letter of the name, and the digits encode the remaining consonants. Consonants at a similar place of articulation share the same digit so, for example, the labial consonants B, F, P, and V are each encoded as the number 1.

The correct value can be found as follows:
#Retain the first letter of the name and drop all other occurrences of a, e, i, o, u, y, h, w.
# Replace consonants with digits as follows (after the first letter):
#* b, f, p, v → 1
#* c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z → 2
#* d, t → 3
#* l → 4
#* m, n → 5
#* r → 6
# If two or more letters with the same number are adjacent in the original name (before step 1), only retain the first letter; also two letters with the same number separated by &#x27;h&#x27;, &#x27;w&#x27; or &#x27;y&#x27; are coded as a single number, whereas such letters separated by a vowel are coded twice. This rule also applies to the first letter.
# If there are too few letters in the word to assign three numbers, append zeros until there are three numbers. If there are four or more numbers, retain only the first three.

Using this algorithm, both &quot;Robert&quot; and &quot;Rupert&quot; return the same string &quot;R163&quot; while &quot;Rubin&quot; yields &quot;R150&quot;. &quot;Ashcraft&quot; and &quot;Ashcroft&quot; both yield &quot;A261&quot;. &quot;Tymczak&quot; yields &quot;T522&quot; not &quot;T520&quot; (the chars &#x27;z&#x27; and &#x27;k&#x27; in the name are coded as 2 twice since a vowel lies in between them). &quot;Pfister&quot; yields &quot;P236&quot; not &quot;P123&quot; (the first two letters have the same number and are coded once as &#x27;P&#x27;), and &quot;Honeyman&quot; yields &quot;H555&quot;.

The following algorithm is followed by most SQL languages (excluding PostgreSQL):
# Save the first letter. Map all occurrences of a, e, i, o, u, y, h, w. to zero(0)
# Replace all consonants (include the first letter) with digits as in [2.] above.
# Replace all adjacent same digits with one digit, and then remove all the zero (0) digits 
# If the saved letter&#x27;s digit is the same as the resulting first digit, remove the digit (keep the letter).
# Append 3 zeros if result contains less than 3 digits. Remove all except the first letter and 3 digits after it (This step is the same as [4.] in explanation above).

The two algorithms above do not return the same results in all cases primarily because of the difference between when the vowels are removed. The first algorithm is used by most programming languages and the second is used by SQL. For example, &quot;Tymczak&quot; yields &quot;T522&quot; in the first algorithm, but &quot;T520&quot; in the algorithm used by SQL. Often, both algorithms generate the same code. As examples, both &quot;Robert&quot; and &quot;Rupert&quot; yield &quot;R163&quot; and &quot;Honeyman&quot; yields &quot;H555&quot;. In designing an application, which combines SQL and a programming language, the architect must decide whether to do all of the Soundex encoding in the SQL server or all in the programming language. The MySQL implementation can return more than 4 characters.

==Variants==
A similar algorithm called &quot;Reverse Soundex&quot; prefixes the last letter of the name instead of the first.

The New York State Identification and Intelligence System (NYSIIS) algorithm was introduced in 1970 as an improvement to the Soundex algorithm. NYSIIS handles some multi-character n-grams and maintains relative vowel positioning, whereas Soundex does not.

Daitch–Mokotoff Soundex (D–M Soundex) was developed in 1985 by genealogist Gary Mokotoff and later improved by genealogist Randy Daitch because of problems they encountered while trying to apply the Russell Soundex to Jews with Germanic or Slavic surnames (such as Moskowitz vs. Moskovitz or Levine vs. Lewin). D–M Soundex is sometimes referred to as &quot;Jewish Soundex&quot; or &quot;Eastern European Soundex&quot;, although the authors discourage the use of those names. The D–M Soundex algorithm can return as many as 32 individual phonetic encodings for a single name. Results of D-M Soundex are returned in an all-numeric format between 100000 and 999999. This algorithm is much more complex than Russell Soundex.

As a response to deficiencies in the Soundex algorithm, Lawrence Philips developed the Metaphone algorithm in 1990. Philips developed an improvement to Metaphone in 2000, which he called Double Metaphone. Double Metaphone includes a much larger encoding rule set than its predecessor, handles a subset of non-Latin characters, and returns a primary and a secondary encoding to account for different pronunciations of a single word in English. Philips created Metaphone 3 as a further revision in 2009 to provide a professional version that provides a much higher percentage of correct encodings for English words, non-English words familiar to Americans, and first and last names found in the United States. It also provides settings that allow more exact consonant and internal vowel matching to allow the programmer to focus the precision of matches more closely.

<text>Henry Starr (December 2, 1873 – February 22, 1921) was an American outlaw of the frontier and an actor of the silent film era.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Starr&#x27;s parents were Mary Scott Starr and George Starr. Distantly related to Sam Starr, husband of Belle Starr, he was the last in a long line of Starr family criminals.

During Starr&#x27;s childhood in Indian Territory, he spent his time around gangs in their hideouts. In 1886, Starr&#x27;s father passed away. Starr&#x27;s widowed mother had to watch three children after that. Later on in life, she married a man named C. N. Walker. Starr disliked him, so he left to become a cowboy at a ranch.

=== Criminal activity ===
Starr was first arrested and fined for &quot;Introducing spirits into the territory&quot;. Starr was repeatedly arrested for crimes he did not commit. After a while, Starr thought that if he was going to be fined for those crimes, he should just commit a real crime while making a lot of money. That&#x27;s when he started to rob banks.

Starr was tried for the murder of Deputy U.S. Marshal Floyd Wilson in 1893. Twice sentenced by Judge Isaac C. Parker to hang for murder, following a series of appeals and Starr&#x27;s confrontation with Cherokee Bill, who was attempting a prison break, his sentence was reduced to a sentence of imprisonment for manslaughter. Starr was eventually granted a presidential pardon and released.

Starr went on to form a notorious gang that terrorized and robbed throughout northwest Arkansas around the start of the 20th century. They were on a crime spree, and the reward if Starr was caught would be $5,000.

=== Later life ===
He was imprisoned again in 1915 in Arizona, wrote his autobiography, &quot;Thrilling Events, Life of Henry Starr&quot; and, released on parole. In 1919, he joined the Pan American Motion Picture Corporation and starred in a silent film, &quot;A Debtor to the Law&quot; (1919), playing a dramatized version of himself. While attempting to rob a bank in Harrison, Arkansas, on February 18, 1921, he was shot by the bank president W. J. Myers with a .38 caliber rifle, and later died of his wounds. Starr is buried at Dewey Cemetery in Dewey, Oklahoma.

<text>As with several other districts of colonial Mozambique, the Portuguese government printed postage stamps specifically for Inhambane for several years. The first issue was for the 700th anniversary of St. Anthony of Padua in 1895, the stamps being those of Mozambique overprinted &quot;CENTENARIO / DE / S. ANTONIO / Inhambane / MDCCCXCV&quot;. This was followed up in 1903 by a regular set featuring a portrait of King Carlos and inscribed &quot;IMHAMBANE&quot;. The replacement of the monarchy by a republican regime in Portugal in 1910 resulted in a variety of &quot;REPUBLICA&quot; overprints until 1917. Subsequently, Inhambane reverted to the use of the stamps of Mozambique.

<text>This is a survey of the [[postage stamps]] and [[postal history]] of [[Bahawalpur (princely state)|Bahawalpur]].

== First stamps ==
Bahawalpur used the postage stamps of British India until 1945. On 1 January 1945, it issued its own stamps, for official use only, a set of pictorials inscribed entirely in Arabic.

== Commemorative stamps ==
On 1 December 1947 the state issued its first regular stamp, a commemorative stamp for the 200th anniversary of the ruling family, depicting Mohammad Bahawal Khan I, and inscribed &quot;BAHAWALPUR&quot;. A series of 14 values appeared 1 April 1948, depicting various Nawabs and buildings. A handful of additional commemoratives ended with an October 1949 issue commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Universal Postal Union. After this the state adopted Pakistani stamps for external mail. Bahawalpur stamps continued to be valid for internal mail until 1953.

<doc id="891968" wikidata="Q34169" url="?curid=891968" title="Adoxa moschatellina">
<text>Adoxa moschatellina, moschatel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Adoxaceae which has a highly distinctive inflorescence. This herbaceous perennial grows in relatively sunny places in old woodland, such as the edges of streams, and in shady places in open habitats such as rock crevices in limestone pavements. It has a limited ability to spread by seed, but expands vegetatively via its long stolons. It is a widespread but generally uncommon plant which is not considered to be threatened within its natural range.

==Description==
Moschatel is a patch-forming perennial about 10-15 cm (6 in.) tall, with pale green foliage and a delicate appearance. It has swollen, fleshy rhizomes as well as long, slender stolons. The aerial stems are produced in early spring (typically around the end of February in England), long before the woodland canopy forms. They are slender, erect and unbranched, typically with two basal leaves on long petioles, which are almost as long as the stem, and two opposite leaves at the top, which have short petioles that are expanded towards the base. There are no stipules. The whole plant is entirely glabrous (hairless).

The basal leaves are a dull green above, silvery and succulent below, and dotted with stomata only on the undersides. The basal leaves are ternate (i.e. divided into 3 lobes) or twice ternate, and up to 5 cm long, whereas the stem leaves have 2 or 3 lobes, with blades up to 3 cm long.

At the top of the stem, on a peduncle which is at least as long as the stem itself, at flowering, is an inflorescence that is unique to this genus and highly distinctive. It consists of a cubical cluster of 5 green flowers, about 0.5 cm in diameter, with four 5-petalled flowers on the sides of the cube and one 4-petalled flower at the top. They are said to smell faintly of musk, especially &quot;towards the evening when the dew falls.&quot; The lateral flowers each have 5 stamens (which are deeply divided so it looks as if there are 10) and 2-5 styles. The terminal flower has only 4, similarly divided, stamens. Below the corolla, the calyx consists of 3 lobes in the lateral flowers and just 2 in the terminal one.
Fruits are formed in April to May in England. Each flower can develop 2-5 fruits, which are rather dry drupes, 4.5 - 5.55 mm in diameter, partially encased by the expanded, fleshy calyx. At this time the peduncle expands and spirals, bending towards to ground to deposit the fruits close to the parent plant. Fruiting is uncommon, as reproduction is mainly vegetative, through the stolons and rhizomes.

==Taxonomy==
Moschatel is a highly distinctive plant, owing to its curious arrangement of flowers. For many years it had been considered the only species in its plant family, the Adoxaceae. However, in 2018 a second species of &quot;Adoxa&quot; was discovered in China and, meanwhile, cytological and genetics studies have shown that family should include the elders and viburnums.
Its name was given by Linnaeus in 1753, in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; (p. 367) and it has received a few synonyms since then, including &quot;Moscatella adoxa&quot; (Scop., 1771) and &quot;Moschatellina fumariifolia&quot; (Bubani, 1899), but these have not stuck.

Its chromosome number is 2n = 36.

Several varieties and subspecies have been described: var. &quot;insularis&quot; occurs in eastern Russia; and subsp. &quot;cescae&quot; is found in southern Italy. It is a triploid (2n = 54) with smaller pollen and stomata. Other plants are, by default, subsp. &quot;moschatellina&quot;, although this name has not been formally published. It is not known to hybridise with any other species.

The word &quot;Adoxa&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek δόξᾰ (doxa), meaning glory or splendour and the Latin prefix a-, which means &quot;not&quot; or &quot;without&quot;, and refers to its humble size and appearance. The specific epithet &quot;moschatellina&quot; and the common name moschatel come from the for musk, which refers to the scent produced by male musk deer, as it is apparently similar to the smell of the flowers.

Other common names include five-faced bishop, hollowroot, muskroot, townhall clock, tuberous crowfoot and Good Friday plant. The name hollowroot presumably comes from the way the stolons (not actually the roots) have a dark core and so have the appearance, in a cut section, of being hollow.

==Distribution and status==
&quot;Adoxa moschatellina&quot; has a boreal, circumpolar distribution in Europe, Asia and North America, and just extending into Morocco in North Africa. It is not established as an introduced species beyond its natural range, except possibly in Ireland. It is generally not considered to be rare or threatened: in the United States it is classified as &quot;secure&quot; and, while it has not been assessed internationally by the IUCN, many European countries classify it as &quot;Least Concern&quot;.

It is widespread in most parts of Britain but not common, being generally restricted to small patches in areas of ancient woodland. It becomes scarce in the north and west, where the soils are too acid for it, and parts of eastern England where there has been little woodland cover. It is absent from Ireland except in a couple of places where it was probably introduced, deliberately or accidentally.

==Habitat and ecology==
Moschatel grows in woodland and scrub, typically in places with fairly light shade, such as the edges of paths or alongside streams and rivers. Its Ellenberg values in Britain are L = 4, F = 5, R = 6, N = 5, and S = 0, which show that it favours lower than average levels of light and nutrients, and higher than average moisture and alkalinity. It is found in deciduous woods under ash, pedunculate oak, sessile oak, hornbeam or beech trees, typically towards the bottom of any slope, where the soil is damper and more base-rich, amongst dog&#x27;s mercury and wood anemone. This habitat is, under the British National Vegetation Classification, considered to be ash wood, W8 in the lowlands and W9 in the uplands. It is also recorded in elder scrub (W6d) along riverbanks. In the Scottish Highlands and Snowdonia, it occurs in juniper scrub (W19), and in shady nooks amongst boulders in upland heaths and pillow lavas (on Cadair Idris).

It is a spring-flowering species which dies back after flowering in May or June. The seeds are deposited on the ground close to the parent plant, thus limiting its ability to spread. This lack of dispersal capacity helps to account for it being largely restricted to ancient woodland, although it is known to establish well in new sites if transported there manually. Spread is more facilitated more by the rhizomes and stolons than by seed production.

In Scotland it is recorded as high as 1065 m on Ben Lawers, and in England up to 760 m at Knock Fell.

The rather plain flowers are pollinated by flies and nocturnal moths which do not rely on colour to pollinate plants.
Insect associations with moschatel appear to be rare. The larvae of two species of sawfly are known to feed on this plant in Britain: &quot;Paracharactus gracilicornis&quot; and &quot;Sciapteryx consobrina&quot; .

In Europe, moschatel is often infected with the smut &quot;Puccinia adoxae&quot; , which produces small black telia (blisters) on the stems and leaves. &quot;Puccinia albescens&quot; and &quot;P. argentata&quot; (syn. &quot;P. impatientis&quot;) make whitish galls as well as black telia. More rarely, it can be parasitized by &quot;Melanotaenium adoxae&quot;, which produces yellow-white blisters.

<text>One of the functions of the North German Confederation was to handle the mail and issue postage stamps, which it began doing, by means of the North German Postal Union &quot;(Norddeutscher Postbezirk)&quot;, on 1 January 1868. 

To accommodate the different monetary systems in use by the various states, it issued a series valued in groschen for the Northern District, and another using kreuzer for the Southern District, distinguishing them by framing the value number in a circle for the groschen stamps, and in an oval for the kreuzers. All of these stamps were inscribed &quot;NORDDEUTSCHER POSTBEZIRK&quot;.

In addition, there was a special quarter-schilling stamp for Hamburg, with the additional inscription &quot;STADTPOSTBRIEF HAMBURG&quot;.

Early in 1869 the stamps were issued with perforations, the previous issues having been rouletted. On 1 March, 10 gr and 30 gr values were issued, notable for being printed on goldbeater&#x27;s skin, a scheme to prevent reuse of these high-value stamps.

Confederation stamps were superseded on 1 January 1872 by the first issues of the German Empire.

== Coverage ==
The coverage of the North German Postal Union was described as follows:

:The federal territories comprise Anhalt, Bremen, Brunswick, Hamburg, Lippe, Lübeck, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Oldenburg, Prussia together with Lauenburg, Reuss senior line, Reuss junior line, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Saxe-Meiningen, Grand Duchy of Saxony, Kingdom of Saxony, Schaumburg-Lippe, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Upper Hesse (part of Hesse north of the Main), and Waldeck.

Upper Hesse was administered as part of the postal union even though the Grand Duchy of Hesse was not a member of the North German Confederation.

<text>The [[British Central Africa|British Central Africa Protectorate]] existed in the area of present-day Malawi between 1891 and 1907.

== First stamps ==
The first postage stamps of the protectorate were issued in April 1891, produced by overprinting the Rhodesian stamps of the British South Africa Company with . A number of new post offices opened during the year, including Blantyre, Zomba, Chiromo, Port Herald, Fort Mlange, Fort Johnston at the southern end of the lake, and Karonga at the northern end of the lake. Chiromo was the main sorting office until after the Shire Highlands Railway was opened in 1908, when Limbe became the postal hub.

== Surcharges ==
Surcharged BSAC stamps were necessary in 1892, 1893, and 1895. 1895 also saw the introduction of stamps printed for the protectorate, featuring the protectorate&#x27;s coat of arms and inscribed . The 1895 issue was printed by De La Rue on unwatermarked paper, but from February 1896 on the paper had either the Crown over CC or Crown over CA watermarks.

In August 1897 a new design was introduced, still using the coat of arms, but with a clear instead of a lined background.

In 1898 the supply of one-penny stamps ran out. Initially the 3-shilling postage stamp was surcharged, but on 11 March the government began to use embossed revenue stamps overprinted with .

== Twentieth century ==
In 1901, the 1d, 4d, and 6d values of the 1897 stamps were printed in different colours. In 1903 a new series of stamps was issued, featuring the profile of King Edward VII and inscribed , with denominations from one penny to ten pounds.

From 1908 stamps were issued by the Nyasaland Protectorate, and from 1964 Malawi.

==Postal stationery==
The first items of postal stationery, for the British Central Africa Protectorate, were registration envelopes in 1892. Between 1892 and 1895 a total of 14 different registration envelopes have been identified as having been produced by overprinting British South Africa Company registration envelopes with . During 1895 and 1896 three registration envelopes were designed and printed for the protectorate.

In 1893 two different postcards were issued using British South Africa Company postcards overprinted in an ornamental frame. New postcards designed for the protectorate were issued in 1896 (3 postcards), 1898 (2 postcards) and 1904 (2 postcards).

One newspaper wrapper was made available for use in 1899.

When the protectorate&#x27;s name was changed to Nyasaland Protectorate all items of postal stationery continued to be valid.

<doc id="891982" wikidata="Q723656" url="?curid=891982" title="Dhampir">
<text>In Balkan folklore, a dhampir () is a mythical creature that is the result of a union between a vampire and a human. This union was usually between male vampires and female humans, with stories of female vampires mating with male humans being rare.

== Name ==
=== Etymology ===
The word is an Albanian word which in turn is borrowed from Serbo-Croat &quot;vampír&quot; or its Bulgarian equivalent. The shift &quot;v &gt; dh&quot; is a feature of Gheg Albanian, but it could also have been encouraged by a folk etymology, connecting it with the Albanian words &#x27;tooth&#x27; and &#x27;to drink&#x27;.

=== Variants ===
Mythical creatures like dhampirs are widely associated with Balkan folklore. In the rest of the region, terms such as Serbian &quot;vampirović&quot;, &quot;vampijerović&quot;, &quot;vampirić&quot; (thus, Bosnian &quot;lampijerović&quot;, etc.) literally meaning &quot;vampire&#x27;s son&quot;, are used.

In other regions, the child is named &quot;Vampir&quot; if a boy and &quot;Vampirica&quot; if a girl, or &quot;Dhampir&quot; if a boy and &quot;Dhampirica&quot; if a girl. In Bulgarian folklore, numerous terms such as &quot;glog&quot; (lit. &quot;hawthorn&quot;), &quot;vampirdzhiya&quot; (&quot;vampire&quot; + &quot;nomen agentis&quot; suffix), &quot;vampirar&quot; (&quot;vampire&quot; + &quot;nomen agentis&quot; suffix), &quot;dzhadadzhiya&quot; and &quot;svetocher&quot; are used to refer to vampire children and descendants, as well as to other specialized vampire hunters. Dhampiraj is also an Albanian surname.

==Origin==
In the Balkans, it was believed that male vampires have a great desire for human women, so a vampire will return to have intercourse with his wife or with a woman to whom he was attracted in life. In one case, a Serbian widow tried to blame her pregnancy on her late husband, who had supposedly become a vampire, and there were cases of Serbian men pretending to be vampires in order to reach the women they desired. In Bulgarian folklore, vampires were sometimes said to deflower virgins as well. The sexual activity of the vampire seems to be a peculiarity of South Slavic vampire belief as opposed to other Slavs, although a similar motif also occurs in Belarusian legends.

==Features==
Legends state that dhampirs were, for the most part, normal members of the community. But dhampirs, especially male, of paternal vampire descent could see invisible vampires and practice sorcery, often starting careers as vampire hunters, which would be practiced for generations from father to son. Some traditions specify signs by which the children of a vampire can be recognized. Albanian legends state they have untamed dark or black hair and are very cunning or courageous in nature. They are not attracted to blood and can eat normally like other human beings, though the option to bite other living beings in order to extend one&#x27;s life is always an open choice.

When being compared to a vampire, dhampirs are said to be very lethal towards the blood drinkers, since a dhampir&#x27;s blood and spit is like an acid for the vampires, making them impossible to be bitten. Due to having mixed blood, a dhampir will not be burned by the sun.

In Bulgarian folklore, possible indications include being &quot;very dirty&quot;, having a soft body, no nails or bones (the latter physical peculiarity is also ascribed to the vampire itself), and &quot;a deep mark on the back, like a tail.&quot; In contrast, a pronounced nose was often a sign, as were larger than normal ears, teeth or eyes. According to J. Gordon Melton, from his book, &quot;The Vampire Book: The Encyclopedia of the Undead&quot;, in some areas, a true dhampir possessed a &quot;slippery, jelly-like body and lived only a short life—a belief... that vampires have no bones.&quot;

== In modern culture ==
Examples of modern dhampir characters include Blade, a vampire-slaying hero in the Marvel comics and films; Alucard from the &quot;Castlevania&quot; video games and TV series; Rayne, the red-headed anti-heroine protagonist of the &quot;BloodRayne&quot; franchise; D from the &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; novels and their adaptations; and Kagura from &quot;OneChanbara Z: Kagura&quot;.

Dhampirs also appear in the works of Scott Baker, Nancy A. Collins, Millie Devon, Barb and J. C. Hendee, Rebecca York, and Stephenie Meyer.

<text>Larache () is a city in northwestern Morocco. It is on the Moroccan coast, where the Loukkos River meets the Atlantic Ocean. Larache is one of the most important cities of the Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region.

Many civilisations and cultures have influenced the history of Larache, starting in the ancient city of Lixus during the 12th centuryBCE. Between the period of being a strategic Berber town and then a Phoenician trading centre to Morocco&#x27;s independence era around the 1950s, Larache was a nexus for many cultures.

==History==
The city is not mentioned in Arabic historical sources until the 13th century. It was founded by the Idrisite Banu &#x27;Arus. Because of the abundant vines in the area, they named it &quot;al-&#x27;Ara&#x27;ish&quot;, meaning &quot;trellis of grape vines&quot;, or &quot;al-&#x27;Arīsh mtā&#x27; Bnī &#x27;Arūs&quot; (&quot;grape vine trellis of the Banu &#x27;Arus&quot;) in longer form. The Almohad caliph Ya&#x27;qub al-Mansur (r. 1184–1199) built a fortress here in the late 12th century. In 1270, the Spanish led a successful raid on the city.

In 1471, the Portuguese settlers from Asilah and Tangier drove the inhabitants out of Larache, and again it remained uninhabited until the Saadi Sultan Mohammed ash-Sheikh decided to repopulate it and build a stronghold on the plateau above river Loukos. He constructed a fortress at the entrance to the port as a means of controlling access to the river.

For a long time, attempts by the Portuguese, Spanish and French to take it met with no success. The Portuguese established the nearby Graciosa fortress in 1489. The Kasbah, which was built in 1491 by Moulay en Nasser, later became a pirate stronghold. 

In 1610, the town passed to the Spanish, who stayed there until 1689, but who mainly used the ports as trading stops and never really administered the town. Moulay Ismail finally conquered Larache in 1689.

Attacks on Larache continued, but it still remained in Muslim hands. In 1765, a French fleet failed in the Larache expedition. In 1829, the Austrians punitively bombarded the city due to Moroccan piracy. Due to the colonisation era, Spain took Larache in 1911 and held it for 45 years until 1956.

On 7 March 2023, Moroccan archaeologists discovered an ancient tomb dating back over 2,000 years to the Mauretanian period.

== Geography ==
The city is located on the northwestern coast of Morocco, on the south bank at the mouth of the Loukkos River. It is roughly southwest of Tangier. The city consists of a compact medina (historic old town), situated next to the river, and a larger &quot;new town&quot;, established outside the old medina by the Spanish colonial administration after 1911 and stretching southwards over the coastal plateau.

=== Climate ===
Larache has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;) with heavy rainfall. The summers are moderately hot and sunny and the winters are wet and cool. The record high temperature of was registered on July 10, 2021.
== Demographics ==
In the 2024 Moroccan census, the commune of Larache recorded a population of 133,731 inhabitants.

== Economy ==
The economy of Larache, Morocco, is influenced by its strategic location along the Atlantic coast. Key aspects include:

=== Lixus ===

Lixus is the site of an ancient city located in Morocco just north of the modern seaport of Larache on the bank of the Loukkos River. It was built by the Phoenicians in 1180 BC. Lixus was part of a chain of Phoenician/Carthaginian settlements; other major settlements further to the south are Chellah and Mogador. When Carthage fell to Ancient Rome, Lixus, Chellah and Mogador were annexed to the Kingdom of Mauretania.

This ancient Mauritanian city gradually grew in importance, later coming under Carthaginian domination. After the destruction of Carthage, Lixus fell to Amazigh (Berber) control, reaching its zenith during the reign of the Mauritanian king Juba II.

Some ancient Greek writers located at Lixus the mythological garden of the Hesperides, the keepers of the golden apples. The name of the city which was often mentioned by writers from Hanno the Navigator to the Geographer of Ravenna and confirmed by the legend on its coins and by an inscription. The ancients believed this to be the site of the Garden of the Hesperides and of a sanctuary of Hercules, where Hercules gathered gold apples, more ancient than the one at Cadiz, Spain. However, there are no grounds for the claim that Lixus was founded at the end of the second millennium BC. Life was maintained there nevertheless until the Islamic conquest of North Africa by the presence of a mosque and a house with a patio with walls covered with painted stuccos.

<doc id="891988" wikidata="Q7233802" url="?curid=891988" title="Postage stamps and postal history of Cape Juby">
<text>[[Cape Juby]] is the name of the former southern part of the spanish protectorate of Morocco (1912–1956). Its on the coast of southern Morocco, near its border with Western Sahara, directly east of the Canary Islands.

In 1912, Spain negotiated with France (who controlled the affairs of Morocco at the time) for concessions on the southern edge of Morocco. The final Spanish protectorate included a southern strip centred on Cape Juby. On July 29, 1916, Francisco Bens officially occupied Cape Juby. The location was used as a staging post for airmail flights.

When Morocco became independent in 1956, it asked for the cession of Moroccan areas controlled by Spain. After some resistance and some fighting in 1957 during the Ifni War, Cape Juby was ceded to Morocco in 1958. The region is now also known as the Tarfaya Strip.

== Overprinted stamps ==
Spain issued a large number of overprinted postage stamps for Cape Juby. The first set, in 1916, were surcharges reading on stamps of Río de Oro. Thereafter overprints read &quot;Cabo Jubi&quot; in various forms, on stamps of Spain from 1919 to 1929, and then on stamps of Spanish Morocco. Overprinted sets of Spanish Moroccan stamps were issued in 1934 through 1940, 1942, 1944, 1946 and 1948.

Most of the issues were printed in larger quantities than the residents of Cape Juby could ever possibly use, were sold to collectors, and are today still quite common, with minimal value. The 1916 issue and the highest values of later issues command prices in the US$50 range.

From 1950, Cape Juby used stamps of Spanish Sahara.

<text>New Era University (NEU) is a private educational institution in the Philippines, run by the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC). Although it is associated with the INC, it is a non-sectarian university. Its main campus is at New Era, Quezon City, within the Central Office Complex of the INC. Aside from its flagship Quezon City campus, it has four other campuses around the Philippines, including one in San Fernando City (Pampanga), in Lipa City (Batangas), in General Santos, and in Baras (Rizal).

Founded on June 17, 1975, it was known as the New Era Educational Institute, and was located in Echague, Quiapo, Manila, along Carlos Palanca St. It initially offered only secondary education (high school) but later expanded in 1977 to serve technical and vocational courses under its Center for Livelihood and Skills Training (CLST). It also offers graduate programs.

In 1981, it was renamed New Era College after the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (MECS) granted collegiate status, and later in June 1995, to its present name, New Era University, when the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) granted university status.

It is run by the INC for the educational needs of INC members, although it accepts enrollments from non-INC members as well. Formerly, under the university umbrella, it ran the College of Evangelical Ministry (now Iglesia Ni Cristo (Church of Christ) School for Ministers), where the Church teaches its male members to become ministers.

Other colleges include College of Engineering and Technology, College of Nursing, College of Business Administration, College of Arts and Sciences, College of Education, College of Music, College of Law, College of Computer Studies, College of Accountancy, School of Graduate Studies, and the then new College of Communication, College of Medicine, and Center for Medical and Health Allied Sciences. It offers new courses in the Philippines, including BS Real Estate Management and BS Criminology.

NEU is the legal owner of the Philippine Arena, which is the largest indoor arena in the world with a seating capacity of over 50,000.

It annually hosts its graduation ceremonies at the Philippine Arena in Ciudad de Victoria, which is being developed because there is a proposal to move the main campus of NEU to this location.

==Integrated School==
New Era University also provides K-12 education through its New Era University Integrated School (NEUIS).

==Networks==


The University is a member of National Athletic Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (NAASCU), an athletic association of colleges and universities in the Philippines, established in 2001. It is a member of Philippine Association for Technological Education (PATE) and is affiliated with Eagle Broadcasting Corporation.

==Developments==
New Era University submitted itself to voluntary accreditation. Today, four programs of the University enjoy Level II step 1 reaccreditation with the benefit of full curricular deregulation (Master of Arts in Education, Business Education and Administration courses, Arts and Sciences Courses, and Education Courses).

The students, faculty and staff members, and administration conduct community extension services.
The Balik-Aral Program for out-of-school youths is conducted by NEU in coordination with the Department of Education Culture and Sports, now the Department of Education (DepEd) and the Iglesia ni Cristo Social Services Department. This programme brings classes for the out-of-school youth right in their own vicinity using the local facilities of the Church, the expertise of NEU-trained teachers and the teaching-learning modules from DepEd.

With the CHED implementation of the National Service Training Program (NSTP) in June 2002, NEU received commendations from town mayors and community leaders for its implementation of all three NSTP components: Literacy Training Service, Community Welfare Service Training, and Reserved Officers Training Corps.

New Era University will soon have its Bocaue/Santa Maria Campus being built as part of Philippine Arena complex in Ciudad de Victoria at Bocaue, Bulacan. It has also established two more colleges – College of Medicine and College of Architecture.

<doc id="891992" wikidata="Q1659827" url="?curid=891992" title="John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott">
<text>John Clarke MacDermott, Baron MacDermott, , PC (NI) (12 April 1896 – 13 July 1979), was a Northern Irish politician, barrister, and judge who served as Attorney-General for Northern Ireland, a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, and Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. He was the first law lord to be appointed from Northern Ireland.

The son of a Belfast Presbyterian clergyman, MacDermott served with distinction with the British Army on the Western Front during the First World War, winning a Military Cross, before reading Law at the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast. After being called to the bar in both Dublin and Belfast, he acquired a busy practice in Northern Ireland, taking silk in 1936. In 1938, he was elected to the Northern Ireland House of Commons as an Ulster Unionist member, rejoined the British Army the following year on the outbreak of the Second World War, and was released from military service in 1941 to enable him to become Minister of Public Security in the Government of Northern Ireland. In 1941, he became Attorney-General for Northern Ireland, serving until his elevation to the Northern Irish High Court in 1944.

In 1947, MacDermott was appointed a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and was elevated to the House of Lords. In 1951, he returned to Belfast to become Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, though he continued to sit occasionally in London. He retired in 1977, and in the same year was severely wounded in a terrorist attack whilst delivering a lecture. He died two years later. His son, also John Clarke MacDermott, was a Lord Justice of Appeal in Northern Ireland.

== Biography ==
John Clarke MacDermott was born in Belfast in 1896, the third surviving son and sixth of seven children of the Reverend John MacDermott DD, a Presbyterian clergyman who was minister of Belmont and moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, and of his wife Lydia Allen MacDermott (&quot;née&quot; Wilson), the daughter of a Strabane solicitor. He was educated at Campbell College, Belfast, from where he won a scholarship to read Law at the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast in 1914.

During the First World War, he served with the machine gun battalion of the 51st (Highland) Division in France, winning the Military Cross in 1918.

After serving with the Machine Guns Corps in France, Belgium and Germany during the First World War, for which he was awarded the Military Cross and reached the rank of Lieutenant, MacDermott was called to the Bar of Ireland in 1921.

Eight years later he was appointed to determine industrial assurance disputes in Northern Ireland, and in 1931 he became a lecturer in Jurisprudence at Queen&#x27;s University, teaching for four years. 

In 1936 he was made a King&#x27;s Counsel, and two years later he was elected to the Northern Ireland House of Commons as an Ulster Unionist member for Queen&#x27;s University.

In 1940, MacDermott was appointed Minister of Public Security in the Government of Northern Ireland, and the following year became the Attorney General for Northern Ireland. He was succeeded in this post by William Lowry, whose son, Lord Lowry, would eventually succeed MacDermott as Lord Chief Justice. In 1944 he resigned his parliamentary seat on appointment as a High Court Judge for Northern Ireland, and three years later, on 23 April 1947 was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, becoming a life peer as Baron MacDermott, of Belmont in the City of Belfast.

Lord MacDermott returned from the House of Lords to take up his appointment as Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland; his successors to the latter office have become Law Lords subsequently. Whilst LCJ, he was affectionately known as &quot;the Baron&quot;.

In 1977, aged over eighty, Lord MacDermott offered to redeliver a lecture at the Ulster College, which had been interrupted by a bomb meant for him and which had severely wounded him.

Having been made a Northern Ireland Privy Counsellor seven years earlier, Lord MacDermott was sworn of the British Privy Council in 1947.

Four years later, in 1951, he was appointed Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, a post he held for twenty years. He was also Pro-Chancellor of his alma mater from 1951 to 1969. In 1958, he chaired the commission on the Isle of Man Constitution. He died in 1979.

In 1926, he wed Louise Palmer Johnston, later Lady MacDermott. Their son, Sir John MacDermott, was also sworn into the British Privy Council in 1987, as a Lord Justice of Appeal in Northern Ireland. He later became a Surveillance Commissioner for Northern Ireland.

<doc id="891993" wikidata="Q4204923" url="?curid=891993" title="Postage stamps and postal history of Eastern Rumelia">
<text>Eastern Rumelia or Eastern Roumelia was an autonomous province (vilayet) in the Ottoman Empire from 1878 to 1908; however, it was under Bulgarian control beginning in 1885 (see Bulgarian unification). The province is remembered today by philatelists for having issued postage stamps from 1881 on, although a postcard was issued locally for internal use in 1880. 
The 1878 Treaty of Berlin provided for the Ottoman Empire to issue special stamps for Eastern Rumelia. However, they were slow to do so. In 1880, in part a reaction to the local postcard, the Turkish government sent some 50,000 piasters worth of Turkish stamps overprinted with &quot;ROUMELIE / ORIENTALE&quot; in an oval. The Eastern Rumelian government found these to be unsatisfactory in presenting the province as an autonomous region, and refused to issue them. A compromise was reached, new stamps specifically printed for Eastern Rumelia were sent from Constantinople and both versions were issued on 16 January 1881. 

Overprints on stamps of Turkey were made locally. First was an &quot;R.O.&quot; that was stamped both on regular Turkish stamps and the oval overprinted ones. This was done in Philippopolis. In addition, a pattern of bars was sometimes used. All of these overprints are uncommon and extensively counterfeited.

The stamps that were specifically printed for Eastern Rumelia used design elements from the existing Ottoman postage stamps, differing from them by having the Greek inscription Ανατολική Ρωμυλία (&quot;Anatolian (i.e. Eastern) Rumelia&quot;) above the &quot;Emp. Ottoman&quot; and with French and Bulgarian inscriptions of the name in small letters along the left and right sides. In 1884, a 5 paras stamp and a ten paras stamp of a second issue of this design, with changed colors, were issued. Higher denominations for the 1884 issue were prepared, but not issued. Both of these sets, 1881 and 1884, were printed in Constantinople. Most of these types are quite common, but perforation variations can be scare.

On September 10, 1885, the existing Rumelian issues were overprinted with two different images of the Bulgarian lion, and then with the lion in a frame and &quot;Bulgarian Post&quot; in Bulgarian (Cyrillic letters). As with the first overprints, these are uncommon, with prices ranging from US$6–200, and counterfeits are widespread. From 1886 on, the province used Bulgarian stamps.

<doc id="891997" wikidata="Q7233950" url="?curid=891997" title="Postage stamps and postal history of the Leeward Islands">
<text>The British Leeward Islands – Antigua, Dominica, Montserrat, Nevis, St. Christopher (St. Kitts), and the Virgin Islands – all used postage stamps inscribed &quot;LEEWARD ISLANDS&quot; between 1890 and 1 July 1956, often concurrently with stamps inscribed with the colony&#x27;s name.

The issue of 1890 was a key plate stamp design with the usual profile of Queen Victoria, eight values ranging from 1/2d to 5 shillings. In 1897 they were overprinted with a logo commemorating Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee, and in 1902 the 4, 6, and 7d were surcharged with a value of 1d.

The 1890 issue design was also used for stamps of King Edward VII, as well as for King George V and George VI, with several changes of watermark and colours. In 1928 a large one-pound stamp was introduced, and updated for the new monarch when George VI took the throne.

The common design commemorative stamps of the Commonwealth between 1946 and 1949 included stamps inscribed &quot;LEEWARD ISLANDS&quot;. In 1951 the West Indies University issue reflected the changeover to cents and dollars, as did the Queen Elizabeth II definitive series of 1954.

<text>This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands.

The islands in the South Pacific Ocean were a British protectorate from 1892 and colony from 1916.

==First stamps==
The first mail service to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands was ad hoc, depending on which ships were calling at the various islands. A regular service began in 1911; Edward VII postage stamps of Fiji were overprinted and put on sale on 1 January of that year, followed in March by a set of four stamps depicting a &quot;Pandanus&quot; tree, inscribed .

==George V and George VI==
These were followed in 1912 by George V stamps of the common type, inscribed . A new definitive series came out starting 14 January 1939, featuring local scenery and a profile of George VI. These were updated in 1956 with a profile of Elizabeth II.

==Queen Elizabeth II==
A set of four stamps on 1 May 1960 commemorated the 60th anniversary of the discovery of phosphate at Ocean Island. The definitive series of 1965 depicted daily activities of the natives, but a decimal currency conversion necessitated surcharges in 1966 and a reissue of the stamps in 1968. The colony issued about 10-15 stamps per year thereafter, usually as sets of four, until the end of 1975.

==Establishment of Kiribati and Tuvalu==
In 1976, the islands became two separate colonies and later independent as Kiribati and Tuvalu.

The Gilbert Islands issued stamps under that name before attaining independence on 12 July 1979 as the Republic of Kiribati. The first stamps of Kiribati were a pair issued on 19 November 1979 to mark the independence of the country.

The Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau was established on 1 January 1976, which was the day the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony was dissolved and Tuvalu established as a separate British dependency. The first stamp issue was a set of provisional overprinted definitive stamps and a commemorative set of three stamps. The first postage stamp cancellation devices were put into use the same day.

From 1894 to 1902, the colony of French Sudan used the general issues of the French colonies (Alphée Dubois and Group types) with the name of the colony. In 1903, the group-type stamps were marked &quot;SENEGAMBIA AND NIGER&quot;, the new name of the colony. In 1906, new stamps were issued marked &quot;Upper Senegal and Niger&quot;, a state which came into existence in 1904, with varied illustrations including colonial personalities: General Louis Faidherbe and Governor-General Noël Ballay in 1906 and a Tuareg horseman in 1914. All the above stamps of this colony with its successive names became uncommon for letters until 1920.

In 1920, Upper Senegal and Niger became French Sudan and some of its regions became Upper Volta and Niger. The Tuareg horseman stamps were widely used in these three colonies until the late 1920s. From 1931 to 1944, the subjects were the Colonial Exhibition of 1931, Pierre and Marie Curie, the explorer René Caillié or the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. But the subjects of the issues from 1931 became the most common. They include a Fulani milkmaid, the door of the Djenne residence, and a boatman on the river Niger.

== French West Africa ==

From 1944 to 1959, the French West Africa issues were used in the French Sudan.

Various territories were joined in 1895 by the French colonial authorities in a federation known as French West Africa (AOF). These territories included Mauritania, Senegal, French Sudan (now Mali), French Guinea (now Guinea), Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Niger, Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) and Dahomey (now Benin). The French colonial territories in the federation issued their own postage stamps until 1943. In many cases, the stamps were inscribed with the name of the federation &quot;Afrique Occidentale Française&quot; as well as the colony&#x27;s own name.

In 1943 and 1944, stamps of Senegal and Mauritania were overprinted with new values and valid throughout French West Africa.

The first issues printed specifically for the federation were the Eboue common design type and a definitive series depicting colonial soldiers, both in 1945. A series of 1947 featured 19 scenes and people of the various colonies, then during the 1950s, there were about 30 various commemoratives. The last issue inscribed &quot;Afrique occidentale française&quot; and &quot;RF&quot; was the Human Rights issue of December 1958.

It was followed by a Stamp Day issue on March 21, 1959, which omitted the federation&#x27;s name and was inscribed &quot;CF&quot; along with &quot;Dakar-Abidjan&quot; for use in Ivory Coast and Senegal.

== Independence ==
French Sudan joined in a short-lived federation with Senegal in 1959, but ties to both countries quickly weakened. In 1960, French Sudan formally became the Republic of Mali.

<doc id="892004" wikidata="Q4767426" url="?curid=892004" title="Anna Quindlen">
<text>Anna Marie Quindlen (born July 8, 1952) is an American author, journalist, and opinion columnist.

Her &quot;New York Times&quot; column, Public and Private, won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1992. Quindlen began her journalism career in 1974 as a reporter for the &quot;New York Post&quot;. Between 1977 and 1994 she held several posts at &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Her semi-autobiographical novel &quot;One True Thing&quot; (1994) served as the basis for the 1998 film starring Meryl Streep and Renée Zellweger.

==Life and career==

Anna Quindlen was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 8, 1952, the daughter of Prudence (née Pantano, 1928–1972) and Robert Quindlen. Her father was Irish American and her mother was Italian American. Quindlen graduated in 1970 from South Brunswick High School in South Brunswick, New Jersey, and then attended Barnard College, from which she graduated in 1974. She was married to New Jersey attorney Gerald Krovatin, whom she met while in college. Their sons Quindlen Krovatin and Christopher Krovatin are published authors, and daughter Maria is an actress, comedian and writer.

Anna Quindlen left journalism in 1995 to become a full-time novelist.

In 1999, she joined &quot;Newsweek&quot;, writing a bi-weekly column until she announced her semi-retirement in the May 18, 2009, issue of the magazine. Quindlen is known as a critic of what she perceives to be the fast-paced and increasingly materialistic nature of modern American life. Much of her personal writing centers on her mother, who died from ovarian cancer, when Quindlen was 19 years old.

She has written ten novels, several of which have been adapted into motion pictures. &quot;One True Thing&quot; was made into a feature film in 1998. It starred Meryl Streep, who received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for the role. &quot;Black and Blue&quot; and &quot;Blessings&quot; were made into television movies in 1999 and 2003, respectively.

==&quot;One True Thing&quot;==
In 1994, her semi-autobiographical novel, titled &quot;One True Thing&quot;, was published. The book focuses on the relationship between a young woman and her mother, who is dying from cancer. Quindlen&#x27;s own mother, Prudence Quindlen, died in 1972 while in her 40s from ovarian cancer. At the time Quindlen was a college student, but came home to take care of her mother. In 1998, a film of the same name was released. The movie starred Meryl Streep and Renée Zellweger as Kate and Ellen Gulden, fictionalized versions of Prudence and Anna Quindlen. Streep was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.

==Criticism==
Writing in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, critic Lee Siegel cited Quindlen as an example of the &quot;monsters of empathy&quot; who &quot;self subjugate and domesticate and assimilate every distant tragedy.&quot; He coined the term &quot;The Quindlen Effect&quot; to describe this phenomenon and suggested that it began with her &quot;Times&quot; column of December 13, 1992, in which Quindlen assailed the four alleged perpetrators of the Glen Ridge rape. &quot;True to her niche,&quot; Siegel wrote, &quot;Quindlen attacked with scathing indignation actions that no sane &quot;Times&quot; reader would ever defend.&quot; Siegel also referred to Barbara Kingsolver in the same essay, along with Quindlen, derisively as &quot;Nice Queens&quot;.

In 1999, Villanova University invited Anna Quindlen to deliver the annual commencement address. But once the announcement was made, a group of anti-abortion students planned a protest against Quindlen&#x27;s positions on reproductive rights, and she withdrew as speaker. The following year, however, she spoke at Villanova&#x27;s graduation.

<doc id="892008" wikidata="Q7233817" url="?curid=892008" title="Postage stamps and postal history of French Congo">
<text>The [[French Congo]] was a French colony established in the present-day area of the Republic of the Congo, Gabon, and the Central African Republic. It began in 1880 as a protectorate, and its borders with Cabinda, Cameroons, and the Congo Free State were established by treaties over the next decade. French Congo was temporarily divided between Gabon and Middle Congo in 1906, before being reunited as French Equatorial Africa in 1910 in an attempt to copy the relative success of French West Africa.

The first postage stamps for the colony were overprints issued in 1891 on the generic issue for the French colonies. They read &quot;Congo français&quot; followed by the value; either 5c, 10c, or 15c. In 1892 the omnibus Navigation and Commerce issue included stamps inscribed &quot;CONGO FRANCAIS&quot;. A pictorial series followed in 1900; its images included a leopard, Bakalois woman, and a coconut grove, printed in pairs of colors, some rather garish. A couple of provisional surcharges on the Navigation and Commerce stamps proved necessary in 1900, and two more were needed on the pictorials in 1903.

The watermarks of the pictorials of 1900 are unlike any other watermarks used in the French area: they are plant branches, with thistle for the low values (up to 15c), rose for middle values (up to 75c), and an olive branch for the three franc values.

Stamps of French Congo were replaced by the issues of Gabon and Middle Congo in 1904.

<text>Bergedorf&#x27;s postal authority issued only five stamps between 1861 and 1867. Bergedorf is the smallest field of German stamp collecting.

== Historical development ==
Due to its good geographic location, Bergedorf and environs (the Bi-Urban Condominium of the sovereign city states of Lübeck and Hamburg to be precise) had already received postal services from the Hanseatic league early on. The city&#x27;s postal connections to neighbouring Hamburg were especially well developed at an early stage.

Since the 1420 Treaty of Perleberg, Bergedorf with Geesthacht and the Vierlande municipalities (Altengamme, Curslack, Kirchwerder and Neuengamme) had belonged to both of the Hanseatic cities of Hamburg and Lübeck, therefore named &quot;Beiderstädtischer Besitz&quot; (Bi-Urban Condominium). Because the condominium belonged to both cities, the curious condition arose where the condominium&#x27;s post could not be administered by either Hamburg or Lübeck. Therefore, the condominium formed its own tiny autonomous postal jurisdiction. Several other principalities also established postal departments in the condominium&#x27;s capital Bergedorf city. In 1746, Electoral Hanover set up its own postal department in Bergedorf city, which lasted as Royal Hanoverian post until 1846. In 1785, the dynasty of Thurn und Taxis succeeded Hanover and established its own postal department, which was not closed until 1851. In 1839, Prussia finally opened a postal department in Bergedorf city as well.

From 1806 to 1813, the condominium was first occupied, and as of 1811 annexed by the First French Empire during the Napoleonic Wars. During this time, the postal system was taken over by the Imperial French Post.

Finally on 1 April 1847, the &quot;Beiderstädtisches Postamt&quot; (Bi-Urban Mail) or &quot;Lübeck-Hamburgisches Postamt&quot; (Postal Department of Lübeck and Hamburg) emerged from the Prussian postal department. In the following years, this arrangement was extended. In 1856, further departments opened in the condominial territory, namely in the Geesthacht exclave (since 1937 no part of the region any more) and in Kirchwerder.

From 1855 to 1856, the Bi-Urban Mail signed several postal agreements modelled on the German-Austrian Postal Treaty, including agreements with Prussia and Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

After Hamburg and Lübeck had already issued their first stamps in 1859, Bergedorf followed in 1861. However, Hamburg&#x27;s stamps were officially sold beside those from the Bi-Urban Mail at the post office counters.

== Stamp issues by the Bergedorf Bi-Urban Mail ==
On 1 November 1861, five definitive stamps with values of ½, 1, 1½, 3, and 4 &quot;Hamburg Schillings&quot; (16 schillings made up 1 Hamburg mark) were issued in Bergedorf. These five values could satisfy the postal tariffs for all distance and weight needs of the time. At that time (1863), only 12,468 people lived in the whole postal region. The imperforated definitive stamps were printed when required and were valid until 31 December 1867. The stamps are square in shape. Besides the value, the country&#x27;s name and the term &quot;Postmarke&quot;, the centre of each stamp depicted one half of the coat of arms of each of Hamburg and Lübeck.

The Bergedorf stamp series is often referred to as a &quot;growing series&quot; because each value is a little bit larger than its predecessor. Thus, the 4 &quot;Schilling&quot; value looks twice as large as the ½ &quot;Schilling&quot; value. Together with the different paper colours of the values, the sizing helped to distinguish between the various stamps.

== Unification with Hamburg ==
Effective 1 January 1868, the Free and Hanseatic city of Hamburg bought Lübeck&#x27;s share in the Bi-Urban Condominium which passed completely into the former&#x27;s ownership. On this date, the joint entry into the North German Confederation (the predecessor of the 1871 German Empire) took place. Since that time, the postal history of Bergedorf shares that of the North German Confederation. Bergedorf&#x27;s five stamps were only valid until that day.

<text>State Route 518 (SR 518) is a state highway located entirely within King County in the U.S. state of Washington. The freeway begins in Burien at an interchange with SR 509 and travels east to serve Seattle–Tacoma International Airport and intersect SR 99 in SeaTac. SR 518 continues east into Tukwila and ends at an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5), as the freeway becomes I-405. The highway was codified in 1937 as the western segment of Secondary State Highway 1L (SSH 1L) and designated as SR 518 during the 1964 highway renumbering. During the 1970s, the roadway was widened into a freeway to serve the airport and serves over 100,000 vehicles per day.

==Route description==
SR 518 begins at a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 509 east of Burien and travels east as a divided freeway, passing north of Highline High School. The freeway intersects Des Moines Memorial Drive and 154th Street north of Seattle–Tacoma International Airport and continues east into SeaTac. SR 518 intersects the Airport Expressway and International Boulevard, signed as SR 99, south of the Tukwila International Boulevard station. The freeway follows the Central Link light rail line into Tukwila and intersects 51st Avenue before an interchange with I-5. At the interchange, located northwest of the Westfield Southcenter Mall, the Central Link turns north along I-5 and SR 518 ends as the roadway continues east as I-405 towards Renton.

Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 38,000 and 102,000 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly between Seattle–Tacoma International Airport and I-5. SR 518 is designated as part of the National Highway System and as a Highway of Statewide Significance for serving Seattle–Tacoma International Airport.

==History==
A highway between Burien and Tukwila has existed since the 1890s and was first codified in 1937 as a segment of SSH 1L, which extended from PSH 5 in Renton west to intersect PSH 1 and US 99 in Tukwila and end at SSH 1K south of Sunnydale, later renamed Burien. The section between PSH 5 in Renton and PSH 1 in Tukwila was removed in 1957 after the construction of the Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, located on PSH 1 and US 99. The remaining highway was later re-designated as SR 518 during the 1964 highway renumbering, being codified as such in 1970. The western terminus of SR 518, an interchange with SR 509, was opened to traffic in November 1968, while the Airport Expressway was opened in 1970 and widened in the 1990s by the Port of Seattle. The freeway segment between SR 99 and I-5 was built in the 1970s. No major revisions to the route of SR 518 have occurred since the 1990s,&lt;ref name=&quot;wsdot2011/12-map&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; however SR 99 from SR 518 to SR 599 was removed to the highway system in 2003.

Beginning in 2005, an elevated light rail guideway was constructed on the north side of SR 518, for Sound Transit&#x27;s Central Link line serving Downtown Seattle, the Rainier Valley and Sea-Tac Airport. The construction led to nighttime closures of the highway and other interruptions until construction finished in 2007. Tukwila International Boulevard station was built to the north of SR 518 at its interchange with SR 99 (International Boulevard) near Sea-Tac Airport.

<doc id="892014" wikidata="Q2471737" url="?curid=892014" title="Carathéodory's theorem (convex hull)">
<text>Carathéodory&#x27;s theorem is a theorem in convex geometry. It states that if a point formula_1 lies in the convex hull formula_2 of a set formula_3, then formula_1 lies in some &quot;formula_5&quot;-dimensional simplex with vertices in formula_6. Equivalently, formula_1 can be written as the convex combination of formula_8 or fewer points in formula_6. Additionally, formula_1 can be written as the convex combination of at most formula_8 &quot;extremal&quot; points in formula_6, as non-extremal points can be removed from formula_6 without changing the membership of &quot;formula_1&quot; in the convex hull.

An equivalent theorem for conical combinations states that if a point formula_1 lies in the conical hull formula_16 of a set formula_3, then formula_1 can be written as the conical combination of at most formula_5 points in formula_6. 

Two other theorems of Helly and Radon are closely related to Carathéodory&#x27;s theorem: the latter theorem can be used to prove the former theorems and vice versa.

The result is named for Constantin Carathéodory, who proved the theorem in 1911 for the case when formula_6 is compact. In 1914 Ernst Steinitz expanded Carathéodory&#x27;s theorem for arbitrary sets.

== Example ==

Carathéodory&#x27;s theorem in 2 dimensions states that we can construct a triangle consisting of points from &quot;P&quot; that encloses any point in the convex hull of &quot;P&quot;.

For example, let &quot;P&quot; = {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)}. The convex hull of this set is a square. Let &quot;x&quot; = (1/4, 1/4) in the convex hull of &quot;P&quot;. We can then construct a set {(0,0),(0,1),(1,0)} = ′, the convex hull of which is a triangle and encloses &quot;x.&quot;

==Proof== 
Note: We will only use the fact that formula_22 is an ordered field, so the theorem and proof works even when formula_22 is replaced by any field formula_24, together with a total order.
We first formally state Carathéodory&#x27;s theorem:

The essence of Carathéodory&#x27;s theorem is in the finite case. This reduction to the finite case is possible because formula_25 is the set of &quot;finite&quot; convex combination of elements of formula_26 (see the convex hull page for details).

With the lemma, Carathéodory&#x27;s theorem is a simple extension:


Alternative proofs use Helly&#x27;s theorem or the Perron–Frobenius theorem.

== Variants ==

=== Carathéodory&#x27;s number ===
For any nonempty formula_3, define its Carathéodory&#x27;s number to be the smallest integer formula_28, such that for any formula_29, there exists a representation of formula_1 as a convex sum of up to formula_28 elements in formula_6.

Carathéodory&#x27;s theorem simply states that any nonempty subset of formula_33 has Carathéodory&#x27;s number formula_34. This upper bound is not necessarily reached. For example, the unit sphere in formula_33 has Carathéodory&#x27;s number equal to 2, since any point inside the sphere is the convex sum of two points on the sphere.

With additional assumptions on formula_3, upper bounds strictly lower than formula_8 can be obtained.
=== Dimensionless variant ===
Recently, Adiprasito, Barany, Mustafa and Terpai proved a variant of Caratheodory&#x27;s theorem that does not depend on the dimension of the space.

=== Colorful Carathéodory theorem ===
Let &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;d&quot;+1 be sets in R&quot;d&quot; and let &quot;x&quot; be a point contained in the intersection of the convex hulls of all these &quot;d&quot;+1 sets.

Then there is a set &quot;T&quot; = {&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;d&quot;+1}, where , such that the convex hull of &quot;T&quot; contains the point &quot;x&quot;.

By viewing the sets &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;d&quot;+1 as different colors, the set &quot;T&quot; is made by points of all colors, hence the &quot;colorful&quot; in the theorem&#x27;s name. The set &quot;T&quot; is also called a &quot;rainbow simplex&quot;, since it is a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional simplex in which each corner has a different color.

This theorem has a variant in which the convex hull is replaced by the conical hull. Let &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;d&quot; be sets in Rd and let &quot;x&quot; be a point contained in the intersection of the &quot;conical hulls&quot; of all these &quot;d&quot; sets. Then there is a set &quot;T&quot; = {&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;d&quot;}, where , such that the &quot;conical hull&quot; of &quot;T&quot; contains the point &quot;x&quot;.

Mustafa and Ray extended this colorful theorem from points to convex bodies.

The computational problem of finding the colorful set lies in the intersection of the complexity classes PPAD and PLS.

<doc id="892017" wikidata="Q2414216" url="?curid=892017" title="The Shubert Organization">
<text>The Shubert Organization is a theatrical producing organization and a major owner of theatres based in Manhattan, New York City. It was founded by the three Shubert brothers — Lee, Sam, and Jacob J. Shubert — in the late 19th century. They steadily expanded, owning many theaters in New York and across the United States. Since then it has gone through changes of ownership, but it is still a major theater chain.

==History==
The Shubert Organization was founded by the Shubert brothers, Sam S. Shubert, Lee Shubert, and Jacob J. Shubert of Syracuse, New York – colloquially and collectively known as &quot;The Shuberts&quot; – in the late 19th century in upstate New York, entering into New York City productions in 1900. The organization produced a large number of shows and began acquiring theaters. Sam Shubert died in 1905; by 1916 the two remaining brothers had become powerful theater moguls with a nationwide presence.

In 1907, the Shuberts tried to enter vaudeville with the United States Amusement Co. In the spring of 1920 they made another attempt, establishing the Shubert Advanced Vaudeville with Lee Shubert as President and playing two shows per day in Boston, Dayton, Detroit, Cleveland, Chicago, Philadelphia and in September 1921 opening in New York.

In April 1922, the Shuberts teamed with Isidore Herk and E. Thomas Beatty formed the Affiliated Theatres Corporation, which would book shows for the chain. Faced with fierce competition from the B. F. Keith Circuit, the Shuberts closed their vaudeville operation in February 1923.

By 1929, the Shubert Theatre chain included Broadway&#x27;s most important venues, the Winter Garden, the Sam S. Shubert, and the Imperial theaters, and owned, managed, operated, or booked nearly a thousand theaters nationwide. The company continued to produce stage productions in New York until the 1940s, returning to producing Broadway productions in the 1970s after a hiatus.

The company was reorganized in 1973, and as of 2016 owned or operated seventeen Broadway theaters in New York City, two off-Broadway theaters — Stage 42 and New World Stages — and the Forrest Theatre in Philadelphia. It leases Boston&#x27;s Shubert Theatre to the Citi Performing Arts Center. Shubert Ticketing, which includes Telecharge, handles tickets for 70 theaters.

Several former Shubert-owned theaters across the United States are still referred to by the Shubert name. One of the most famous is the New Haven Shubert, the second theater ever built by the Shubert Organization. Until the 1970s, major Broadway producers often premiered shows there before opening in New York. It was immortalized in many mid-20th century films, such as &quot;All About Eve&quot;.

Another important regional theater was the Shubert in Chicago, Illinois, located within the Majestic Building at 22 West Monroe Street. Originally known as the Majestic Theatre, the Shubert Organization purchased it in 1945 and rechristened it the &quot;Sam Shubert Theatre&quot;. The Shuberts sold the theatre to the Nederlander Organization in 1991 and is now known as the CIBC Theatre.

In 2016, it sold its longtime headquarters at 1700 Broadway to Ruben Cos for $280 million.

<doc id="892020" wikidata="Q4204927" url="?curid=892020" title="Postage stamps and postal history of the Far Eastern Republic">
<text>The [[Far Eastern Republic]], sometimes called the Chita Republic, existed from April 1920 to November 1922 in the easternmost part of Siberia. It was formed from the Amur, Transbaikal, Kamchatka, Sakhalin, and Primorye regions. In theory, it extended from Lake Baikal to Vladivostok but, in May 1921, the Priamur and Maritime Provinces seceded. Although nominally independent, it was largely controlled by the RSFSR and its main purpose was to be a democratic buffer state between the RSFSR and the territories occupied by Japan during the Russian Civil War to avoid war with Japan. Initially, its capital was Verkhneudinsk (now Ulan-Ude), but from October 1920 it was Chita. On 15 November 1922, after the war ended and the Japanese withdrew from Vladivostok, the Far Eastern Republic was annexed by Soviet Russia.

==Postage stamps==

===Coalition Government===
In 1920 the RSFSR, by agreement with the communists, social revolutionists and social democrats, formed a three-party coalition government called the &quot;Far Eastern Republic&quot; (F.E.R.). The first Chairman of the F.E.R. was Alexander Krasnochekoff. In September 1920 this government ordered its Central Postal Administration to collect all stocks of the remaining tsarist postage stamps from all post offices in the area of the F.E.R. Large supplies of the Imperial Russian 1909–1917 &#x27;Arms&#x27; issue were on hand at the main post office of Khabarovsk and also at Vladivostok. At first mail was franked with these &#x27;Arms&#x27; stamps and the still-current Kolchak (Siberia) overprinted stamps. This introduced the danger of revenue loss due to imported &#x27;Arms&#x27; stamps. The decision was hence made to overprint all the &#x27;Arms&#x27; stamps with the Russian initials &#x27;DBP&#x27; meaning &quot;Far Eastern Republic&quot; (), and to accept only overprinted stamps for franking within the F.E.R. The exact issue date remains uncertain; sources mention November 23 as well as December 12, 1920.

After the &#x27;DBP&#x27; or DVR overprinted stamps were exhausted, four different new stamps modelled on the Tsarist &#x27;Arms&#x27; type of 1909–1917 were printed in 1921 in Vladivostok. The exact issue date is unknown; estimates of production numbers range from 600,000 to 1,000,000.

===Priamur Provisional Government, Merkulov===
In May 1921 a White movement coup d&#x27;état took place in Vladivostok. The new authorities there declared the abolition of the F.E.R. government and formed the Priamur Provisional Government (; VPP).
headed by the brothers Spiridon Merkulov and . On May 22, 1922, an overprint was applied by the Vladivostok State Bank to four of the 1921 definitive issues consisting of an oval and &#x27;26.V.1921–1922&#x27;. It commemorated the first anniversary of the Merkulov government. The stamps were to be used in the Southern Primorsk Oblast. Issue numbers were low, about 2,000.

In addition to these overprints a representative of the Merkulov government had the Tsarist &#x27;Arms&#x27; type of 1909–1917 overprinted in 1921 at Nikolayevsk-on-Amur. The overprint bears the letters &#x27;N na A/PVP&#x27;, and the new gold-kopeck values. It was done by handstamp since all the printing works in Nikolayevsk-on-Amur had been destroyed. 
===Priamur Rural Area Government, Diterikhs===
The local population administered by the rural assembly (&#x27;Zemskoe Sobranie&#x27;) was discontented with the Merkulov government. The rural assembly appointed General Mikhail Konstantinovich Diterikhs () as Governor and military commander of the rural armed forces (&quot;Zemskaya Rat&quot;) of the Priamur Zemstvo territory. Shortly after his appointment, Diterikhs overthrew the Merkulov government, and renamed the area &#x27;Priamurskii Zemskii Krai&#x27; (Priamur Rural Area). Diterikhs did not recognize the F.E.R. and had the &#x27;DVR&#x27;, the 1921 regular issues and Imperial Russian 1909–1917 &#x27;Arms&#x27; issue overprinted &#x27;Priamurskii Zemskii Krai&#x27;. The stamps were overprinted by the Vladivostok State Bank between August and September 1922, and used in the Southern Primorsk Oblast between September and December 1922.

===Military Revolutionary Committee===
In October 1922 the Japanese evacuated the Maritime Province and Diterikhs, defeated by the F.E.R. army on 14 October 1922, fled abroad. The Bolsheviks took Vladivostok on 25 October 1922 and set up a Military Revolutionary Committee. 10,000 Sets definitive stamps of the F.E.R. were overprinted &#x27;1917.7.XI.1922&#x27;, commemorating the fifth anniversary of the October Revolution, and issued on November 7, 1922. These stamps were used until early 1923.

The F.E.R. ceased to exist as an independent state on November 15, 1922. During 1923 and early 1924 various Siberian stamp issues remained in circulation, mostly the Chita issues.
==Postal stationery==

In 1920 the Coalition Government had Postal stationery produced by overprinting Tsarist Russian postal cards and newspaper wrappers which already had different designs of impressed stamp applied to show that postage had been pre-paid. Similar to the stamps the overprint consisted of the Russian initials &#x27;DBP&#x27; meaning Far Eastern Republic (Dalne-Vostochnaya Respublika), and was placed horizontally on the imprinted stamp.

Four different postal cards were used. Postal cards of 3 kopeks (1909), 4 kopeks (Romanov card of 1913) 5 kopeks brown (Kerensky card of 1917) and 5 kopeks reply card (Kerensky card of 1917) were overprinted.

Tsarist wrappers of 1890 and 1891, the 1 kopek orange and 2 kopek green were used. Four different wrappers can be distinguished although some catalogues subdivide each 2 kopek wrapper into two types with differences in size, making a total of six different wrappers.

==Collecting stamps and postal stationery of the Republic of the Far East==
Several of the above stamps were produced in large numbers, and are readily available today, while others are very rare. Genuine usages on cover are seldom seen for some issues, and are somewhat scarce for most. Some alleged stamp issues of the Far Eastern Republic should be treated with caution, as there is no evidence they were ever postally used. These include the so-called Nikolaevsk-on-Amur issue and the 1923 Vladivostok Airmail issue. Fantasy issues also exist, such as the &quot;Pribaikal&quot; overprints.

The stamps and postal stationery of the Russian civil war period are a complex topic giving an advanced collector a great philatelic challenge.

<doc id="892026" wikidata="Q2200977" url="?curid=892026" title="Miller–Dieker syndrome">
<text>Miller–Dieker syndrome, also called Miller–Dieker lissencephaly syndrome (MDLS) or chromosome 17p13.3 deletion syndrome, is a micro deletion syndrome characterized by congenital malformations. Congenital malformations are physical defects detectable in an infant at birth which can involve many different parts of the body, including the brain, heart, lungs, liver, bones, or intestinal tract.
MDS is a contiguous gene syndrome – a disorder due to the deletion of multiple gene loci adjacent to one another. The disorder arises from the deletion of part of the small arm of chromosome 17p (which includes both the &quot;LIS1&quot; and &quot;14-3-3 epsilon&quot; genes), leading to partial monosomy. There may be unbalanced translocations (e.g., 17q:17p or 12q:17p), or the presence of a ring chromosome 17.

This syndrome is unrelated to Miller syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, or Miller Fisher syndrome, a form of Guillain–Barré syndrome.

==Presentation==
The brain is abnormally smooth, with fewer folds and grooves. The face, especially in children, has distinct characteristics including a short nose with upturned nares, thickened upper lip with a thin vermilion upper border, frontal bossing, small jaw, low-set posteriorly rotated ears, sunken appearance in the middle of the face, and hypertelorism of eyes. The forehead is prominent with bitemporal hollowing. Children typically also have microcephaly, a wide upper lip, and midface hypoplasia.

Characteristics that are not visual include intellectual disabilities, pre- and postnatal growth retardation, epilepsy, and reduced lifespan. Children may also experience breathing problems, dysphagia, feeding problems, hypotonia, spasticity, and muscle stiffness. Failure to thrive, feeding difficulties, seizures and decreased spontaneous activity are often seen. Death usually occurs in infancy and childhood.
Multiple abnormalities of the brain, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract (the stomach and intestines) may occur.

==Cause==
MDS is a microdeletion syndrome involving loss of the gene PAFAH1B1 on chromosome 17 which is responsible for the syndrome&#x27;s characteristic sign of lissencephaly. The loss of another gene, YWHAE, in the same region of chromosome 17 increases the severity of the lissencephaly in patients with Miller–Dieker syndrome. Additional genes in the deleted region are likely to contribute to the varied features of Miller–Dieker syndrome.

It may be a random event during the formation of reproductive cells or in early fetal development or due to familial chromosomal rearrangement called chromosomal translocation. In less than 20% of cases an unaffected parent carries a particular chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. Increased rate of unexplained fetal loss may be observed in those who have these suspectible balanced translocations although they may be otherwise asymptomatic. However, these translocations can become also unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Miller–Dieker syndrome is usually not inherited. The deletion event occurs randomly during gametogenesis (formation of eggs or sperm) or in early foetal development. Therefore, no history of the disorder is usually seen in their families.

==Diagnosis==
The disease may be diagnosed by cytogenetic techniques like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), testing for a microdeletion at LIS1.

===Early detection===
With the use of prenatal ultrasonographic imaging, early detection of abnormal brain development in the fetus with MDS can be seen. At birth, facial dysmorphism can be present in the infant. Young children, when affected, can have feeding difficulties, severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, and seizures. MRI facilitates early detection of this syndrome in children by revealing a &quot;smooth brain&quot; image, also called lissencephaly.
Children with this syndrome may remain underdiagnosed because of rarity and the prevalence of facial features that appear to be dysmorphic. The syndrome shares distinct external features (phenotype) similar to more common syndromes. Lack of relevant family history may delay diagnosis.
FDNA provides a service that in turn increases the chances of detecting these distinct characteristics, which, when shown to a geneticist, can assist in reaching the right medical diagnosis.
If a couple has had one child with MDS, they can be offered prenatal screening in future pregnancies. This option is particularly important for the few (less than 20%) MDS families where one parent carries a balanced chromosome rearrangement. The risk of these couples having another child with MDS depends on the exact type of chromosomal rearrangement present and may be as high as 25–33%. For families in which both parents&#x27; chromosomes are normal, the risk of having another child with MDS is low (1% or less). Either chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis can be used early in a pregnancy to obtain a small sample of cells from the developing embryo for chromosome studies. Early prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound is not reliable because the brain is normally smooth until later in pregnancy. Couples who are considering prenatal diagnosis are usually advised to discuss the risks and benefits of this type of testing with a geneticist or genetic counselor.

===Visuals of the brain===
The brain is usually grossly abnormal in outline when someone is diagnosed with Miller–Dieker syndrome. Only a few shallow sulci and shallow Sylvian fissures are seen; this takes on an hourglass or figure-8 appearance on the axial imaging. The thickness and measurement for a person without MDS is 3–4 mm. With MDS, a person&#x27;s cortex is measured at 12–20 mm.

==Treatment==
While no cure for MDS is available yet, many complications associated with this condition can be treated, and a great deal can be done to support or compensate for functional disabilities. Because of the diversity of the symptoms, it can be necessary to see a number of different specialists and undergo various examinations, including:
* Developmental evaluation
* Cardiologists evaluation
* Otolaryngology
* Treatment of seizures
* Urologic evaluation
* Genetic counseling: though MDS is usually random and without a family history, a balanced chromosomal translocation in one of the parents can greatly raise the chances of a child of theirs being affected. If parents with an affected child are planning another pregnancy, they are usually advised to visit a genetic counselor for further information.

This disease is fairly uncommon, and treatment is scarce.

==Prognosis==
Most individuals with this condition do not survive beyond childhood. Individuals with MDS usually die in infancy and therefore do not live to the age where they can reproduce and transmit MDS to their offspring.
Due to more accurate diagnosis by MRI and improved management of symptoms with medical treatments including gastrostomy (feeding tubes), suction machines, seizure medications, tracheostomy, and management of secretions, more children are surviving into adulthood and have a better quality of life. Development of skills and core strength may be improved with physical therapy, but improvement is limited by the severity of the condition. Some children may be able to sit up, crawl, or say a few basic words, but most are severely developmentally delayed and remain at the level of infants for their lifetime. At all ages the most common cause of death is pneumonia, often after multiple cases have weakened the respiratory function.

==Epidemiology==
Miller-Dieker occurs in less than one in 100,000 people and can occur in all races.
Given this statistic, it is conclusive that roughly 75000 people worldwide are affected by MDS.

==History==
MDS was named for the two physicians, James Q. Miller and H. Dieker., who independently described the condition in the 1960s. The hallmark of MDS is lissencephaly, a condition in which the outer layer of the brain, the cerebral cortex, is abnormally thick and lacks the normal convolutions (gyri). In some areas of the brain, gyri are fewer in number but wider than normal (pachygyri). Other areas lack gyri entirely (agyri). Normally, during the third and fourth months of pregnancy, the brain cells in the baby multiply and move to the surface of the brain to form the cortex. Lissencephaly is caused by a failure of this nerve cell migration. MDS is often called Miller-Dieker lissencephaly syndrome.

JQ Miller described the disease and in 1969 H Dieker emphasized that it should also take the name lissencephaly syndrome because several malformations occur beyond the brain itself. When MDS was initially described, geneticists assumed it followed an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. In the early 1990s, several patients with Miller–Dieker syndrome were found to be missing a small portion of chromosome 17. (17p13.3) (a partial deletion).

<text>Senegambia and Niger was a short-lived administrative unit of the French possessions in Africa, formed in 1902 and reorganized in 1904 into Upper Senegal and Niger.

<doc id="892031" wikidata="Q466533" url="?curid=892031" title="American Psycho 2">
<text>American Psycho 2 (also known as American Psycho II: All American Girl) is a 2002 American slasher film directed by Morgan J. Freeman from a screenplay by Alex Sanger and Karen Craig. Starring Mila Kunis and William Shatner, it is a stand-alone sequel to the film &quot;American Psycho&quot;. Kunis portrays a criminology student who seeks to advance her career by murdering her classmates.

The screenplay for the film, entitled &quot;The Girl Who Wouldn&#x27;t Die&quot;, originally had no association with &quot;American Psycho&quot;. After production began, the script was altered to connect the film with the original. &quot;American Psycho 2&quot; was released direct-to-video on June 18, 2002. The film was panned by critics; the script was also denounced by Bret Easton Ellis, the author of the original novel, and Kunis later expressed regret for working on the film.

==Plot==
In early 1988, a twelve-year-old girl accompanies her babysitter on a date with serial killer Patrick Bateman. After Bateman kills and starts to dissect the babysitter, the girl kills him with an ice pick.

In 1993, the young girl, Rachael Newman, is now a college student studying criminology at a Washington university under Professor Starkman, a former FBI agent. Rachael aspires to join the FBI and is determined to get the coveted teaching assistant position under Starkman, which would make her a shoo-in for the FBI training program in Quantico, Virginia.

After secretary Gertrude Fleck rudely dismisses Rachael&#x27;s application for the teaching assistant position on the basis that she is a freshman, Rachael follows her home and bludgeons her to death. Determined to succeed, Rachael proceeds to kill off any of her peers who stand as competition, starting with Brian Leads, whom she drugs and murders during a proposed sexual encounter. During her killing spree, Rachael decides to see the school psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Daniels.

Realizing that Rachael is a textbook sociopath who is obsessed with Starkman, Daniels tries to warn Starkman without revealing Rachael&#x27;s name due to patient confidentiality. Starkman mistakenly assumes that the student obsessed with him is Cassandra Blaire, with whom he carries on an extramarital affair. When Cassandra reveals that her affair with Professor Starkman has guaranteed her the teaching assistant position, Rachael decides to murder her as well, staging her death as a suicide. Next, she murders Keith Lawson, a bookish classmate, while he is studying late one night in the university library.

Professor Starkman discovers Cassandra&#x27;s body and calls Daniels to tell him that &quot;she&#x27;s dead&quot;. He does not identify the victim and Daniels assumes it must be Rachael. Distraught, Professor Starkman withdraws from the university, which incenses the obsessed Rachael. That night, Rachael locates an intoxicated Starkman in his office, impaired by the effects of Valium and alcohol, and tries to seduce him. However, Starkman sees she is wearing a dress and necklace he had given to Cassandra. She then confesses her crimes to him, her &quot;crush&quot; on him, and that she knows about his affairs with various women (which included her former babysitter that Bateman murdered), as he backs up towards the window in a state of confusion and fear. Rachael blows him a kiss, and he falls out the window to his death. As she leaves, Rachael also murders a janitor and a security guard because they witnessed Starkman&#x27;s death.

On the last day of classes before spring break, Rachael&#x27;s parents make a surprise visit to her at her dormitory. She quickly ushers them out, agreeing to meet them for dinner later that night. That same night, while treating his elderly mother to a night out, Daniels observes Rachael with her parents at a local restaurant. Daniels becomes suspicious since he believes Rachael is dead, and after dinner goes to the local police station to ask the police officers about any recent missing persons cases. Through a flashback, it is revealed that &#x27;Rachael&#x27; is, in fact, an imposter who killed the real Rachael at the beginning of the semester and assumed her identity, storing the real Rachael&#x27;s corpse in a garment bag in her dormitory closet. The real Rachael was an orphan; so when Rachael claimed to be her, there was no one to disprove her claim. Daniels and two cops pursue Rachael in a car chase, which ends with Rachael driving off a cliff, resulting in the car exploding. At this point, she is presumed dead.

Two years later, Dr. Daniels is giving a lecture on Rachael&#x27;s mind and how he wrote a book about her. When he looks up from speaking with a student, he sees Rachael, who has not died after all; she indirectly reveals that she killed Starkman&#x27;s last assistant, Elizabeth McGuire, and stole her identity to get into Quantico FBI Academy. She allows Dr. Daniels to know because she believes there is no point in committing the perfect crime if no one knows about it and she is confident he will not divulge this information because it would make a farce of his best-selling book in which he claimed to completely understand her and witness her death in the fiery car.

It is revealed the dead body in the car was the real Rachael, whose decaying body had been kept in the killer&#x27;s dorm closet. It was revealed by another student that Elizabeth is the youngest agent to be drafted to the Bureau in her sophomore year. As Elizabeth aka Rachael walks out of his class, Dr. Daniels is visibly shaken by what he had just learned.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
The screenplay for the film, entitled &quot;The Girl Who Wouldn&#x27;t Die&quot;, originally had no association with Mary Harron&#x27;s &quot;American Psycho&quot; (2000). After production began, the script was altered to connect the film with the original.

===Casting===
In April 2001, it was announced that Mila Kunis and William Shatner had been cast in the film.

Lionsgate president Michael Paseornek commented on the project: &quot;Morgan J. Freeman is a talented director who we are convinced will make a film that will appeal to audiences from the late teens on up. And Mila Kunis is about to really break out. She has great timing for a dark comedy like this.&quot;

===Filming===
Filming began in Toronto in May 2001 on a budget of approximately $10 million. The production was noted as having completed in late-June 2001. Bret Easton Ellis, author of the novel &quot;American Psycho&quot;, expressed confusion about the film&#x27;s billing as a sequel to Harron&#x27;s 2000 film adaptation, though he noted at the time that he had sold the rights to the story, commenting: &quot;I&#x27;ve even heard that [Lionsgate] were thinking about doing &quot;American Psycho in L.A.&quot;, &quot;American Psycho in Las Vegas&quot;, and making a whole franchise out of it.&quot;

Marketing

&quot;American Psycho 2&quot; catered to the new and increasing demand for DVDs, as evident by the direct-to-disc promotional tool used after the release.

==Release==
===Critical response===
&quot;American Psycho 2&quot; was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 11% based on reviews from 9 critics, with an average score of 3.00/10.

Film critic Rob Gonsalves wrote, &quot;&quot;American Psycho 2&quot; wasn&#x27;t even supposed to be an &quot;American Psycho&quot; sequel, for Christ&#x27;s sake! Lions Gate noticed that the first film got critical acclaim and didn&#x27;t do too poorly in theaters, so they dusted off an unrelated script and modified it to link it (tenuously) to the first film.&quot; Almar Haflidason of the BBC awarded the film a two out of five star-rating, writing: &quot;Imagine if the characters of the animated series &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; were to turn on one another, and you&#x27;ll be close to imagining the freakish &quot;American Psycho II&quot;. Resembling a &quot;Scream&quot;-styled take on serial killer thrillers, this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Scott Brown similarly criticized the film, writing: &quot;Unscary and unfunny, [it] still manages to inspire homicidal fantasies—most involving the slow dismemberment of once-promising indie director Morgan J. Freeman.&quot;

The film was denounced by &quot;American Psycho&quot; author Bret Easton Ellis the year before its release. In 2005, Kunis expressed embarrassment over the film and spoke out against the idea of a third entry. &quot;Please—somebody stop this&quot;, she said. &quot;Write a petition. When I did the second one, I didn&#x27;t know it would be &quot;American Psycho II&quot;. It was supposed to be a different project, and it was re-edited, but, ooh … I don&#x27;t know. Bad.&quot;

Chris Alexander of &quot;ComingSoon.net&quot; defended the film in a 2017 retrospective, deeming it &quot;a strange, entertaining and surprising little film. Bloody and funny and twisty and turny and Kunis pulls it all off. We like Rachel, despite her streak of remorseless and lethal evil. And the men and women who end up on the end of her knives, very often deserve it. Or at least are undone by their own unsavory antics.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s published review described the film as &quot;occasionally amusing&quot; and compared its structure to that of the similarly themed black comedy &quot;Getting In&quot; (1994), adding, &quot;this horror lampoon; directed by indie up-and-comer Morgan J. Freeman; blithely ridicules FBI profiling, psychoanalysis and professorial sexual misconduct. It&#x27;s less successful in its efforts to paint serial killers and their trackers as soul mates, and in the end, this campy chiller crucifies the American success ethic with more vigor than elan.&quot;

===Home media===
Though intended for a theatrical release, &quot;American Psycho 2&quot; was released direct-to-video on VHS and DVD by Lions Gate Home Entertainment on June 18, 2002. DVD extras included a feature commentary with director Freeman, star Kunis, deleted scenes, and a trailer. The film made its Blu-ray debut on September 5, 2017. It includes all of the DVD extras along with a digital copy.

<doc id="892033" wikidata="Q7233924" url="?curid=892033" title="Postage stamps and postal history of Upper Senegal and Niger">
<text>[[Upper Senegal and Niger]] was a colony in French West Africa created in 1904 from Senegambia and Niger. Niger became a separate military district in 1911 and a separate colony in 1922, Upper Volta was split off in 1919, and the remainder reorganized as French Sudan in 1920. The capital was Bamako.

The colony issued a number of postage stamps during its short existence. The first issue was part of the 1906 omnibus issue of the French West Africa, consisting of 17 stamps in three designs: portraits of Louis Faidherbe, Eugene Ballay, and an oil palm, with values ranging from 1 centime to 5 francs. Another series of 17 followed in 1914, all of same design—a camel with its rider—but each printed in a different pair of colours.

In addition, in 1915 the 10c stamp of 1914 was surcharged an additional 5c and sold as a semi-postal stamp. Sets of postage due stamps were also issued in 1906 and 1914. Stamps of French Sudan superseded all of these in 1921.

<doc id="892044" wikidata="Q834892" url="?curid=892044" title="Washington State Route 104">
<text>State Route 104 (SR 104) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Washington, serving four counties: Jefferson on the Olympic Peninsula, Kitsap on the Kitsap Peninsula, and Snohomish and King in the Puget Sound region. It begins south of Discovery Bay at U.S. Route 101 (US 101) and crosses the Hood Canal Bridge over Hood Canal to the terminus of SR 3 near Port Gamble. SR 104 continues southeast onto the Edmonds–Kingston Ferry to cross the Puget Sound and intersects SR 99 and Interstate 5 (I-5) before ending at SR 522 in Lake Forest Park. SR 104 also has a short spur route that connects the highway to SR 99 at an at-grade signal on the Snohomish–King county line.

Established during the 1964 state highway renumbering, SR 104 was formed out of four highways, themselves created in 1937: Secondary State Highway 9E (SSH 9E) from Discovery Bay to Port Gamble, Primary State Highway 21 (PSH 21) from Port Gamble to Kingston, SSH 1W within Edmonds, and SSH 2B from Edmonds to Lake Forest Park. PSH 21 was originally part of State Road 21, added to the state highway system in 1915 to connect the Port Gamble–Shine ferry to the Kingston ferry landing. The Edmonds–Kingston ferry at the end of State Road 21 has been in operation under various companies since 1923 and was served by the 14-car &quot;City of Edmonds&quot;. SSH 9E extended from Discovery Bay to Port Ludlow initially and was moved south and extended to the South Point ferry landing in the late 1940s. The bridge replaced the South Point–Lofall ferry when it opened in 1961, but the ferry was re-used during the construction of the second Hood Canal Bridge after the first bridge sank in 1979 and before the new bridge opened in 1982. The Edmonds–Kingston ferry was added to the state ferry system in 1951 before it was incorporated into SR 104 in 1994.

==Route description==
SR 104 begins at an intersection with US 101, located south of Discovery Bay on the Olympic Peninsula. The highway travels south through rural Jefferson County towards Crocker Lake and turns southeast, intersecting SR 19 south of Port Ludlow. SR 104 continues east along the northern shore of Squamish Harbor, part of the Hood Canal, and crosses into Kitsap County on the Hood Canal Bridge, the third longest floating bridge in the world. The highway serves as the northern terminus of SR 3 east of the bridge and turns northeast towards Port Gamble, located on the Kitsap Peninsula. SR 104 turns south along the western shore of Port Gamble, the bay the community is named after, and turns southeast to intersect SR 307. The highway continues east from the intersection to Kingston, where it splits into a one-way pair before the designation travels onto the Edmonds–Kingston Ferry.

The ferry, operated by Washington State Ferries (WSF), takes approximately 30 minutes to cross across Puget Sound. It departs from Kingston on Appletree Cove and arrives in Edmonds in Snohomish County. WSF operates thirteen round-trip crossings every day. Westbound passengers must pay a $7.70 toll or they may alternately pay with a prepaid Wave2Go card.

SR 104 resumes in Edmonds on Main Street and crosses a BNSF rail line south of Edmonds Station. The highway turns south at an intersection with SR 524 onto Sunset Avenue towards Woodway. The roadway travels southeast along Edmonds Way towards the Snohomish–King county line, intersecting SR 524 Spur and 5th Street at a grade-separated interchange. Edmonds Way travels through a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 99 before SR 104 intersects its spur route, which travels west towards an at-grade signal with SR 99. The highway continues east along Ballinger Way to a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-5 southeast of Lake Ballinger. The highway travels southeast into Lake Forest Park, where SR 104 ends at SR 522 on the north shore of Lake Washington.

SR 104 is considered, by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), an auxiliary route of US 101, part of a numbering system established during the 1964 state highway renumbering. Every year, WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 3,800 and 44,000 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly in the Shoreline area. The Edmonds–Kingston ferry carried 3.808 million passengers and 2.025 million vehicles in 2012, according to WSF statistics. The segments of the highway between Discovery Bay and Kingston and SR 99 and I-5 in Edmonds and Shoreline are designated as part of the National Highway System, while the whole route is designated by WSDOT as a Highway of Statewide Significance because it connects major communities in the state of Washington.

==History==
SR 104 was established during the 1964 state highway renumbering as the successor to several state highways: SSH 9E between Discovery Bay and Port Gamble, PSH 21 between Port Gamble and Kingston, SSH 1W in Edmonds, and SSH 2B between Edmonds and Lake Forest Park. The highway between Port Gamble and Kingston was established in 1915 as part of State Road 21, which extended south to Bremerton. During the creation of the Primary and secondary state highways in 1937, State Road 21 was re-designated as PSH 21 and extended south to Gorst. SSH 9E was also established, connecting US 101 and PSH 9 in Discovery Bay to Port Ludlow, along with SSH 1W from US 99 and PSH 1 in Lynnwood through Edmonds to US 99 and PSH 1 in Woodway, following the route of an unpaved road built in the 1890s. SSH 2B was created in 1937 to serve as a connector between US 99 and PSH 1 in Shoreline to a branch of PSH 2 in Lake Forest Park.

SSH 9E was extended southeast to the South Point ferry over Hood Canal in 1947, as the ferry traveled east to a branch of PSH 21 at Lofall created in 1949. The highway was moved south from Discovery Bay to intersect US 101 near Crocker Lake in 1957 and was extended across the floating Hood Canal Bridge in 1959 to PSH 21 west of Port Gamble prior to the bridge opening on August 12, 1961. The westernmost section of the highway was straightened and redirected to an interchange with US 101 in November 1965.

SR 104 was designated over the highways in 1964 and was signed into law in 1970. The highway was widened and relocated onto a limited-access bypass between downtown Edmonds and Aurora Village in 1974, at a cost of $8 million. The bypass, which included an interchange at SR 99, was proposed in the 1960s and required several years of right-of-way acquisition. That same year, the state government studied a realignment of SR 104 east of I-5 to generally continue along the King–Snohomish county line to a junction with SR 527. The study concluded that an extension would likely be subject to litigation from local residents based on feedback from earlier meetings and would not provide major benefits.

The Hood Canal Bridge, officially named after highways director William A. Bugge, sank during the February 13, 1979 windstorm and was replaced by a ferry operating between Lofall and South Point until the west span was re-opened on October 23, 1982. The east span of the bridge was replaced between 1997 and 2010, closing the bridge to traffic in May 2009 and re-opening the South Point–Lofall ferry. The route of the highway has not been revised significantly since the 1994 inclusion of ferry routes.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsdot2011/12-map&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Edmonds–Kingston ferry, added to SR 104 in 1994, was first served by the 14-car and 76-passenger &quot;City of Edmonds&quot; in 1923. The ferry ran three crossings on weekdays and six on weekends and a toll of $1.50 for vehicles and $0.25 for passengers was later charged. After the establishment of Washington State Ferries in 1951, the 59-car was assigned to the Edmonds–Kingston route. Between 1968 and 2005, the Evergreen State class and were used on the route, while the Steel Electric class and were used on extra summer runs. The Jumbo class and began serving the route in 2005, but sometimes are replaced by other ferries, especially during maintenance.

==Spur route==

SR 104 Spur begins its short, route as 244th Street at SR 104 on the Snohomish–King county line between Edmonds and Shoreline. 244th Street travels west on the 5-lane roadway (including a center turning lane) north of the Aurora Village shopping center to end at an intersection with Aurora Avenue, signed as SR 99. The highway was originally part of SSH 2B from 1937 to 1964 and SR 104 after the 1964 highway renumbering and was created in 2009 after SR 104 was realigned onto a new divided highway. WSDOT estimated that between 18,000 and 19,000 vehicles per day used the spur route, according to AADT data in 2011.

<doc id="892047" wikidata="Q2554670" url="?curid=892047" title="Conscription in Australia">
<text>Conscription in Australia, also known as National Service following the Second World War, has a controversial history which dates back to the implementation of compulsory military training and service in the first years of Australia&#x27;s nationhood. Military conscription for peacetime service was abolished in 1972.

However, in times of war, the &quot;Defence Act 1903&quot; allows the Governor-General of Australia to authorise conscription for service in the Defence Force, provided it is approved by the Parliament of Australia within 90 days.

== History ==

=== Universal Training Scheme ===
In 1909, the Deakin government introduced an amendment to the &quot;Defence Act 1903&quot;, the &quot;Defence Act 1909&quot;, which allowed for a form of conscription for boys from 12 to 14 years of age and for youths of 18 to 20 years of age for the purposes of home defence. The Act, which passed with the combined support of the Protectionist Party and the Australian Labor Party, did not allow soldiers to be conscripted for overseas service. 

Following recommendations arising from a visit to Australia by Field Marshal Kitchener to report on the country&#x27;s defence readiness, the Australian Labor Party government instituted a system of compulsory military training for all males aged between 12 and 26 from 1 January 1911.

John Barrett, in his study of boyhood conscription, &quot;Falling In&quot;, noted:
In 1911 there were approximately 350,000 boys of an age (10–17 years) to register for compulsory training up to the end of 1915. Since &#x27;universal&#x27; was a misnomer, about half that number were exempted from training, or perhaps never registered, reducing the group to 175,000.

There was quite extensive opposition to the so-called &quot;boy conscription&quot;. By July 1915, there had been about 34,000 prosecutions and 7,000 detentions of trainees, parents, employers or other persons required to register.

=== World War I ===


Under Labor Prime Minister Billy Hughes, full conscription for overseas service was attempted during the First World War in two referendums.

The first referendum was held on 28 October 1916 and narrowly rejected conscription with a margin of 49% for and 51% against. The referendum of 28 October 1916 asked Australians:

Are you in favour of the Government having, in this grave emergency, the same compulsory powers over citizens in regard to requiring their military service, for the term of this War, outside the Commonwealth, as it now has in regard to military service within the Commonwealth?

A second referendum was held on 20 December 1917 and defeated by 46% for and 54% against. This question was put to Australians:

Are you in favour of the proposal of the Commonwealth Government for reinforcing the Commonwealth Forces overseas?

After the failure of the first referendum, Billy Hughes and his supporters left the Australian Labor Party parliamentary caucus and took with them a good deal of the parliamentary party&#x27;s talent. They created a new National Labor Party, and Hughes survived as prime minister by forming a conservative Nationalist government, which was dependent for survival on the Commonwealth Liberal Party. The remainder of the Labor Party, under the new leader, Frank Tudor, then expelled Hughes and all of those who had followed him. Following the split, Labor stayed out of office for ten years.
After the first referendum, the government used the &quot;War Precautions Act&quot; and the &quot;Unlawful Associations Act&quot; to arrest and prosecute anti-conscriptionists such as Tom Barker, the editor of &quot;Direct Action&quot; and many other members of the Industrial Workers of the World and E. H. Coombe, who had three sons at the front, of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;. The young John Curtin, then a member of the Victorian Socialist Party, was also arrested. Anti-conscriptionist publications, in one case, even when it was read into Hansard, were seized by government censors in police raids.
Other notable opponents to Conscription included the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne Daniel Mannix, Queensland Labor Premier T. J. Ryan, Vida Goldstein and the Women&#x27;s Peace Army. Most trade unions actively opposed conscription. Archbishop Mannix, born in County Clare, stated that Ireland had been more wronged by Great Britain than Belgium had been by Germany.

Many people thought positively of conscription as a sign of loyalty to Britain and thought that it would also support those men who were already fighting. However, trade unions feared that their members might be replaced by cheaper foreign or female labour and so opposed conscription. Some groups argued that the whole war was immoral, and it was unjust to force people to fight.

South Africa and India were the only other participating countries not to introduce conscription during the First World War.

==== Divided nation ====
The conscription issue deeply divided Australia with large meetings held both for and against. The women&#x27;s vote was seen as important, with large women&#x27;s meetings and campaign information from both sides aimed at women voters. The campaigning for the first referendum was launched by Hughes at a huge overflow meeting at the Sydney Town Hall, where he outlined the government&#x27;s proposals. That was followed by a huge pro-conscription meeting at the Melbourne Town Hall on 21 September.

Anti-conscriptionists, especially in Melbourne, were also able to mobilise large crowds, with a meeting filling the Exhibition Building on 20 September 1916; 30,000 people on the Yarra bank on Sunday, 15 October, and 25,000 the following week; a &quot;parade of women promoted by the United Women&#x27;s No-Conscription Committee – an immense crowd of about 60,000 people gathered at Swanston St between Guild Hall and Princes Bridge, and for upwards of an hour the street was a surging area of humanity&quot;. An anti-conscription stop work meeting called by five trade unions held on the Yarra Bank mid-week on 4 October attracted 15,000 people. It was passed on 21 September 1916, and mandatory registration and enrolment commenced while the first referendum campaign was underway. By 5 October, &quot;The Age&quot; reported that of 11607 men examined, 4581 were found fit, approximately 40 percent.

&quot;The Age&quot; noted in the article &quot;Influence of the IWW&quot; that &quot;the great bulk of the opposition to conscription is centred in Victoria&quot;. Many meetings in inner Melbourne and Sydney were disrupted by anti-conscriptionists with speakers being howled down from the audience in what &quot;The Age&quot; described as &quot;disgraceful exhibition&quot; and &quot;disorderly scenes&quot;.

The issue deeply divided the Labor Party, with ministers such as Hughes and George Pearce vigorously arguing the need for conscription for Australia to help the Allies win the war. They were supported by many within the party, including Labor&#x27;s first prime minister, Chris Watson and NSW Labor Premier William Holman. Hughes denounced anti-conscriptionists as traitors and a climate of bitter sectarianism developed since most Roman Catholics opposed conscription and most others supported it.

By the end of the war in November 1918, a total of 416,809 men had voluntarily enlisted in the Army, representing 38.7 percent of the white male population aged between 18 and 44.

On 1 November 1929, the mandatory service provisions of the &quot;Defence Act&quot; were suspended, ending 18 years of conscription for home defence.

=== World War II ===
In 1939, at the start of World War II, all unmarried men aged 21 were to be called up for three months&#x27; military training. The men could serve only in Australia or its territories. Conscription was effectively introduced in mid-1942, when all men aged 18–35 and single men aged 35–45 were required to join the Citizen Military Forces (CMF). Volunteers with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) scorned CMF conscripts as &quot;chocolate soldiers&quot;, or &quot;chockos&quot;, because they were believed to melt under the conditions of battle, or it might be an allusion to George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; in which Bluntschli filled his backpack with chocolate bars, rather than ammunition. However, several CMF Militia units fought under difficult conditions, suffered extremely high casualties in 1942 and slowed the Japanese advance on the Kokoda Track in New Guinea, then an Australian territory.

The Papuan campaign of 1942 led to a significant reform in the composition of the Australian Army. During the campaign, the restriction banning CMF personnel from serving outside Australian territory hampered military planning and caused tensions between the AIF and CMF. In late 1942 and early 1943, Prime Minister John Curtin overcame opposition within the Australian Labor Party to extending the geographic boundaries in which conscripts could serve to include most of the South West Pacific, and the necessary legislation was passed in January 1943. The 11th Brigade was the only CMF formation to serve outside Australian territory, however, when it formed part of Merauke Force in the Dutch East Indies in 1943 and 1944.

=== Korean War ===
In 1951, during the Korean War, national service was introduced under the &quot;National Service Act 1951&quot;. All Australian males aged 18 had to register for 176 days training (99 days full-time) and two years in the CMF. Later, the obligation was 140 days of training (77 days full-time) and three years&#x27; service in the CMF. In 1957 the system was changed to emphasise skill rather than numbers, then ended in 1959. The regular military forces remained voluntary.

=== Vietnam War ===

In 1964, compulsory national service for 20-year-old males was introduced under the &quot;National Service Act 1964&quot;. The selection of conscripts was made by a sortition or lottery draw based on date of birth, and conscripts were obligated to give two years of continuous full-time service, followed by a further three years on the active reserve list. The full-time service requirement was reduced to 18 months in October 1971.

The &quot;Defence Act&quot; was amended May 1964 to provide that national servicemen could be obliged to serve overseas, a provision that had been applied only once before, during World War II. The 1964 amendments applied only to the permanent military forces and excluded the Citizen Military Forces. In 1965, the &quot;Defence Act&quot; was again amended to require the CMF to serve overseas, which had not been included in the 1964 amendments. In March 1966, the government announced that national servicemen would be sent to South Vietnam to fight in units of the Australian Regular Army and for secondment to American forces. Requirements for overseas service were detailed by the Minister for the Army, Malcolm Fraser, on 13 May 1966. Men who wished to avoid national service could join the Citizen Military Forces and serve only inside Australia, claim a student deferment or attempt a conscientious objection application. To be exempted on the basis of conscientious objection, an applicant needed to demonstrate his moral objection to &quot;all&quot; wars in court and to be legalised as a pacifist. That meant that the rate of success for conscientious objection applications was generally low.

==== Opposition ====
During the late 1960s, domestic opposition to the Vietnam War and conscription grew in Australia. In 1965, a group of concerned Australian women formed the anti-conscription organisation Save Our Sons, which was established in Sydney with other branches later formed in Wollongong, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Newcastle and Adelaide. The movement protested against conscription of Australians to fight in the Vietnam War and made the plight of men under 21, who were not yet eligible to vote, a focus of their campaign. In 1970, five Save-Our-Sons women were jailed in Melbourne for handing out anti-conscription pamphlets on government property. The group, which included Jean McLean (politician), Irene Miller and Jo Maclaine-Ross, was dubbed &quot;The Fairlea Five&quot; after Fairlea women&#x27;s prison in which they were incarcerated. Barbara Miller is understood to be related to the decorated conscript Simon Anderson, who mysteriously disappeared in 1970.
Young men who were subject to the conscription lottery also formed their own anti-conscription organisation, the Youth Campaign Against Conscription. Like Save Our Sons, it spread to other states: New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. It was the YCAC that imported the concept of draft-card burning from the United States and ushered in a new form of resistance to conscription, active non-compliance. Instead of merely not registering (passive non-compliance with the National Service Scheme), the young conscripts actively demonstrated their distaste for the government&#x27;s actions by destroying their registration cards. Unlike in the United States, that was not legal and so its importance remained symbolic.

There were several high-profile controversies caused by the government&#x27;s heavy-handed treatment of conscientious objectors, including William White and Simon Townsend (who later became a well-known television personality). In 1969 the Gorton administration was severely embarrassed by a renowned &quot;This Day Tonight&quot; story in which a conscientious objector, who had been on the run from police for several months, was interviewed live in the studio by the journalist Richard Carleton, who then posed awkward questions to the Army Minister about why &quot;TDT&quot; had been able to locate the man within hours and bring him to the studio when the federal police had been unable to capture him, and the event was made even more embarrassing for the government because the man was able to leave the studio before the police had arrived to arrest him.

By 1969, public opinion was turning against the war. A Gallup Poll in August showed that 55 percent of those surveyed favoured bringing Australian troops home, and only 40 percent favoured them staying. That was the first poll to show less than 50% approval for the government&#x27;s policy, and all polls after August 1969 were to reveal a majority in favour of bringing the troops home. In October, during his policy speech for the 1969 federal elections, the opposition leader, Gough Whitlam, declared that if elected, the ALP would make sure that all Australian troops in Vietnam would be home &#x27;by Christmas&#x27;.

Around then, opposition to conscription became more radical. Active non-compliers began to call themselves &quot;draft resisters&quot;. Instead of waiting to be called up, draft resisters wrote letters to the Minister for National Service detailing their intention not to comply with conscription. Under law, that immediately rendered them liable for service. A number of these young men formed a draft resisters&#x27; union, active in at least two states: New South Wales and Victoria. They included men such as Bob Scates and Michael Hamel-Green. They went underground while maintaining a public presence, appeared at protests and were spirited away by the crowd before they could be arrested. In December 1972, while &#x27;underground&#x27; as a draft resister, Barry Johnson stood as the Australian Labor Party (ALP) candidate in the seat of Hotham against Minister Don Chipp.

Australian government cabinet documents released by Australian National Archives in 2001 show that in 1970, the conservative government was initially concerned about the growth of conscientious objection and of outright opposition to the &quot;National Service Act&quot;. Reportedly, the cabinet considered instituting an option of alternative civilian work program for conscientious objectors in an attempt to reduce the numbers of objectors going to jail. That was never instituted but was widely rumoured at the time. Such work would have been menial labouring jobs in remote locations such as north and western Queensland, western New South Wales and northern South Australia.

In Cabinet Submission Number 200 for 1970, Appendix 1, case studies of 17 men awaiting prosecution for failure to undertake service show a broad spectrum of opposition to conscription including:
* Religious opposition such as Christadelphians, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses
* Moral opposition to wars
* Moral opposition to the Vietnam War in particular
* Opposition based upon the compulsion and authoritarian nature of conscription and its conflict with democratic processes and ideals.

The documents reveal that draft resistance and draft dodging never posed a threat to the number of conscripts required, but the public opposition by draft resisters such as John Zarb, Michael Matteson and Robert Martin had an increasingly-political effect. Conscription ended in December 1972, and the remaining seven men in Australian prisons for refusing conscription were freed in mid-to-late December 1972.ef 63,735 national servicemen served in the Army, of whom 15,381 were deployed to Vietnam. Approximately 200 were killed.

<text>[[North Borneo]], located in the northern part of the island of Borneo, was a British protectorate from 1888 and a British Crown colony after 1946.

==First stamps==
Initially, mail from the British protectorate of North Borneo was sent via Labuan or Singapore, using postage stamps of the Straits Settlements. After the North Borneo Chartered Company was founded to administer the territory, it issued its own stamps in 1883. These used a design incorporating the coat of arms (a dhow and a lion), inscribed &quot;NORTH BORNEO&quot;, and with the value written in English, Jawi, and Chinese. Initial values included 2c, 4c, and 8c, followed by large 50c and $1 stamps of a more elaborate design with the arms flanked by two natives.

==Later issues==

In 1886 ½c, 1c, and 10c values were added, and there was a demand for 3c and 5c stamps, resolved by overprinting existing types. At the same time, the printers (Blades, East, and Blades of London) produced a new design, largely the same but inscribed &quot;BRITISH NORTH BORNEO&quot;, and joined by 25c and $2 values, also with elaborate frames. The stamps were redesigned again in 1888, to say &quot;POSTAGE &amp; REVENUE&quot; instead of just &quot;POSTAGE&quot;, at which time the 25c to $2 values also received minor changes. These were followed up in 1889 by even larger and more elaborate $5 and $10 stamps. Between 1883 and 1890, postage stamps of North Borneo were valid to nearby countries only if sent by direct steamer at 8¢ rate, otherwise additional adhesives of either Hong Kong, Labuan or Strait Settlements had to be affixed.

Shortages in 1890, 1891, and 1892 necessitated more surcharges. In 1894, the protectorate issued a new definitive series engraved by Waterlow and Sons, comprising nine pictorials featuring natives plants, animals, and scenes, and inscribed &quot;STATE OF NORTH BORNEO&quot;.

North Borneo was made a British protectorate on 12 May 1888. In 1901, stamps were overprinted &quot;British Protectorate.&quot;.

==World War II==

North Borneo was occupied by Japanese forces in 1942. During the occupation, overprinted stamps of North Borneo and Japan were used. In 1943, two stamps of Japanese design were issued for North Borneo. Following liberation, stamps of North Borneo were overprinted &quot;BMA&quot; by the British Military Administration.

==Post-war==
The Crown Colony of North Borneo was established in 1946 after the North Borneo Chartered Company ceded the territory to the British Government. The Colony issued stamps until 1963 when North Borneo (as Sabah) joined Malaya, Sarawak and Singapore to form the Federation of Malaysia.

<text>This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Bechuanaland Protectorate.

==First stamps==

The first Bechuanaland Protectorate postage stamps were produced in 1888 by overprinting stamps of British Bechuanaland (some overprints of British stamps and some issued specifically for the colony) with &quot;Protectorate&quot;. In 1889 a -penny stamp of Cape of Good Hope was overprinted &quot;Bechuanaland / Protectorate&quot;.

From 1897 to 1925 more British stamps were overprinted using the protectorate&#x27;s name in various layouts. In 1910 a 6-pence stamp of Transvaal was also overprinted; although it was intended for fiscal use, postal uses are known.

==George V==

The first stamps inscribed Bechuanaland Protectorate appeared in 1932. The 12 values, ranging from d to 10 shillings, all used the same design; a group of cattle next to a baobab tree, surmounted by a portrait for King George V. The usual Silver Jubilee issue appeared in 1935.

==George VI==
A Coronation issue appeared in 1937 and a definitive series in 1938 with King George VI replacing his father on the 1932 series.

The protectorate&#x27;s Peace issue of 1945 was produced by overprinting &quot;Bechuanaland&quot; on South Africa&#x27;s Peace stamps. Stamps were issued for the Royal visit in 1947, and for the usual omnibus sets of the period.

== Queen Elizabeth ==

Queen Elizabeth II replaced her father in a definitive series of 1955, the rest of the design matching the previous definitives.

Three stamps in 1960 commemorated the 75th anniversary of the protectorate, then in 1961 Bechuanaland converted to the South African rand, necessitating surcharges on the existing definitives in February, followed by a new definitive series in October that was mostly pictures of birds, with some showing people at work.

Standard Commonwealth omnibus issues appeared up until independence, along with a 1 June 1966 issue commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Bechuanaland Pioneers and Gunners.

From 30 September 1966 the Bechuanaland Protectorate became the Republic of Botswana and stamps from that time were marked Botswana.

<text>The postal history of Portuguese India goes back to the earlier days of the colony. The postal history begins with communication between the Viceroy and the Court at Lisbon soon after the conquest of Old Goa by Afonso de Albuquerque in 1510. Letters, written in triplicate, were carried by separate ships because of the hazards of the voyage. Mail was carried by an overland route, as well. The early communications of Portuguese India had an official character and the correspondence is now to be found in museums and governmental and ecclesiastical archives.

==Early mails==

Regular mail is known to have been exchanged with Lisbon from 1825 on. Portuguese Indian postmarks are known from 1854, when a post office opened in Goa and an extraterritorial British East India Company post office opened in Damaun. A Portuguese Indian post office opened at Diu, also, in 1880.

The British East India Company post office in Damaun, selling British Indian stamps, was maintained between 1854 and November 1883. The Damaun cancellation showed &quot;13&quot; within downward sloping diagonal bars, a &quot;used abroad&quot; Renouf &quot;Type 4&quot; cancellation. British India postage stamps were also available at the Portuguese post office at Goa from 1854 until 1877.

Before the Universal Postal Union was established in 1874, a country had to conclude a separate postal treaty with each other country with which it transacted international mail. Portugal had a postal convention with Great Britain, so mail was routed through Bombay and carried on British packets.

==First stamps==
The first postage stamps of Portuguese India were issued 1 October 1871. These were issued for local use within the colony. Stamps of British India were required for overseas mail.

The design of these first stamps simply consisted of a denomination in the center, with an oval band containing the inscriptions &quot;SERVIÇO POSTAL&quot; and &quot;INDIA PORT.&quot;. The dies were recut several times and printed on several kinds of paper, resulting in an extremely complicated situation that has been intensively studied; about 55 types have been identified as appearing between 1871 and 1877, some of which are quite rare.

==Regular issues==
In 1877, Portugal included India in its standard &quot;crown&quot; issue, with nine values ranging from 5r to 300r. These stamps ran out in 1881 and the old local stamps were surcharged with various values, resulting in nearly 100 distinct types. Additional &quot;crown&quot; stamps arrived in 1882, but in the following year were supplemented by additional values of the original local design.

From 1886 on, the pattern of regular stamp issues followed that of the other colonies closely, the main exception being a series of surcharges in 1912 produced by perforating existing stamps vertically through the middle and overprinting a new value on each side.

In 1925, a commemorative stamp marked the 400th anniversary of the death of Vasco da Gama and in December 1931 a set of six promoted the Exposition of St. Francis Xavier held at Goa. Sets of stamps in 1946 and 1948 commemorated notable historical figures related to the colony. Portuguese India&#x27;s first stamp exhibition, in 1952, was commemorated with a pair of stamps; one reproducing the design of the first issue, the other depicting St. Francis Xavier. A 1956 series commemorated the 450th anniversary of Portuguese settlements in India, and included portraits and maps of old forts, while a 1959 series depicted various coins.

==Last stamps==

The last regular issue was on 25 June 1960, marking the 500th anniversary of the death of Prince Henry the Navigator. Stamps of India were first used 29 December 1961, although the old stamps were accepted until 5 January 1962. Portugal continued to issue stamps for the lost colony, yet none of these were ever offered for sale in the colony&#x27;s post offices and are thus not considered valid stamps.

The territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli were liberated from Portuguese rule in 1954, and they enjoyed de facto independence until being formally incorporated into India after the Annexation of Goa in 1961. During these years, mail from Dadra and Nagar Haveli was routed through the Indian town of Vapi close to the border. Initially, remaining stocks of stamps of Portuguese India were overprinted LIBERATED AREAS in two lines.

<text>Blacklist Studio () was a group of Taiwanese musicians who came together and released a ground-breaking album in 1989 called &quot;Songs of Madness&quot; (). Reportedly five years in the making, this work came out at a critical juncture in Taiwan&#x27;s history, two years after the lifting of the decades-long martial law. The album was critical in the formation of the genre known as New Taiwanese Song.

Its members included Wang Ming Hui (), Chen Ming Chang (), Lin Wei Zhe().

The first album&#x27;s notes reveal the seriousness with which the group assessed its own role in Taiwan&#x27;s musical development. They believed that Taiwanese music ought to reflect the times, that it was important for the new generations to &quot;correctly&quot; see the relationship between the mother tongue and themselves. Unlike virtually all other previous works, their songs sought to engage post-World War II social changes in a frank, realist way.

The songs&#x27; styles cover Taiwanese folk, rap, and rock. One song has a clip of the Republic of China national anthem. Another samples environmental sounds from the street. Most of the songs told stories, sometimes through humorous or ironic dialogues between ordinary citizens. Taiwanese is used extensively in many of the songs.

In 1996, the group released their second album, &quot;Cradle Songs&quot; (&quot;Yaolan qu&quot;). However, the album was a commercial and critical failure.

The group received the Special Contribution Award during the 30th Golden Melody Awards.

<text>State Route 523 (SR 523, named 145th Street) is a short Washington state highway located on the city limits of Seattle, Shoreline, and Lake Forest Park in King County. The road itself runs east from past (I-5) and ends at ; the highway was first established in 1991, but the roadway from I-5 to 5th Avenue Northeast was once the northern section of from 1937 until 1964 and later from 1964 until 1991.

==Route description==
State Route 523 (SR 523) begins at an intersection with and North 145th Street at the northern Seattle and southern Shoreline city limits; at the SR 99 intersection, the highway is named 145th Street. From its western terminus, the roadway travels east to 1st Avenue NE, where SR 523 becomes Northeast 145th Street, which the road keeps until its eastern terminus. The highway travels east to interchange with (I-5), where the northbound ramps are accessed through nearby 5th Avenue Northeast. After the I-5 interchange, the road forms the northern boundary of the Jackson Park Golf Course and later continues to at the northern Seattle, southern Shoreline and western Lake Forest Park city limits. The SR 523 / I-5 interchange was used by an estimated 28,000 motorists daily based on annual average daily traffic (AADT) data collected by the Washington State Department of Transportation.

==History==

145th Street was paved by the King County government between 1934 and 1935. The Washington State Legislature first established a state-maintained highway on a section of present-day SR 523 in 1937, with the establishment of (SSH 1J), which ran from Downtown Seattle to (PSH 1) in North Seattle, via the current long section of SR 523 from I-5 to 5th Avenue Northeast. During the 1964 highway renumbering, SSH 1J became and PSH 1 became I-5; the northern terminus of SR 513 became the current SR 523 / I-5 interchange. In 1991, the northern terminus of SR 513 was moved south to its current location, Magnuson Park and SR 523 was established.

<text>In the United Kingdom, the football pools, often referred to as &quot;the pools&quot;, is a betting pool based on predicting the outcome of association football matches taking place in the coming week. The pools are typically cheap to enter, and may encourage gamblers to enter several bets.

The traditional and most popular game was the Treble Chance, now branded the Classic Pools game. Players pick 10, 11 or 12 football games from the offered fixtures to finish as a draw, in which each team scores at least one goal. The player with the most accurate predictions wins the top prize, or a share of it if more than one player has these predictions. In addition, there is a special £3,000,000 prize or share of it for correctly predicting the nine score draws (draws of 1–1 or higher) when these are the only score draws on the coupon. Players can win large cash prizes in a variety of other ways, under a points-based scoring system.

Entries were traditionally submitted through the post or via agents, who collected entries throughout a specific area. It is now possible to play online.

Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters were the largest pools companies. Littlewoods was the first company to provide pools, selling them outside Manchester United&#x27;s Old Trafford ground in 1923. In 1986, a syndicate of players became the first winners of a prize over £1 million. The football pools companies have traditionally had a charitable element, donating over £1.1 billion to sports-related causes.

The pools business declined after the introduction of the National Lottery in 1994. Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters were brought together in 2007 by Sportech under the brand &#x27;The New Football Pools&#x27;, now known as &#x27;The Football Pools&#x27;. They offer other small stake, high prize games such as Premier 10 and Jackpot 12. In 2017 The Football Pools was sold to OpCapita, a private equity company, for £83 million.

==In the United Kingdom==
=== Origins ===
Competitions for predicting the results of football matches are older than the football league itself. The &quot;Cricket and Football Field&quot; newspaper, in its edition of 10 September 1887, offered a prize of one guinea to &quot;the Competitor who predicts the results&quot; of four football matches to be played the following Saturday. Readers were invited to cut out and fill in a coupon printed in the newspaper, which had to be sent to the newspaper&#x27;s offices by the Friday before the matches. If more than one &quot;couponnier&quot; predicted all four exact scores correctly, the prize would be shared between them. There was no charge for entry beyond postage; in fact readers were allowed to submit several coupons together, presumably in order to encourage them to purchase several copies of the newspaper. By 1910, &quot;The Umpire&quot; was offering a first prize of £300 for predicting six results.

In October 1922, John Moores, Colin Askham and Bill Hughes heard about John Jervis Barnard, a Birmingham man who had devised a &#x27;football pool&#x27;, where punters would bet on the outcome of football matches. The payouts to winners came from the &#x27;pool&#x27; of money that was bet, less 10 per cent to cover &quot;management costs&quot;. It had not been particularly successful and Barnard was struggling to make a profit. Hughes obtained one of Barnard&#x27;s pools coupons; the three friends decided they could do it better and, on 1 February 1923, launched the Littlewood Football Pool (as it was originally known). A small office in Liverpool was rented and the first 4,000 coupons were distributed outside Manchester United&#x27;s Old Trafford ground before one Saturday match that winter. Moores handed the coupons out himself, helped by some young boys eager to earn a few pennies.

It was not an instant success, as just 35 coupons were returned. With bets totalling £4 7s 6d (£4.37½), the 10 per cent deducted did not cover the three men&#x27;s expenses. The winning dividend paid out £2 12s 0d (£2.60). They decided to print 10,000 coupons, and took them to Hull, where they were handed out before a big game. This time, only one coupon was returned. Midway through the 1924–25 football season the scheme was still losing money. The three young men had already invested £200 each, with no imminent prospect of things improving. Hughes suggested they cut their losses and forget the whole thing and Askham agreed. They expected Moores to concur, but instead he offered to return the £200 they had each invested in return for their shares, and they accepted. By 1930, Moores had become a millionaire from the competition.

In April 1929, Moores was prosecuted under the Ready Money Football Betting Act 1920. Following a court appearance, he was convicted. However, as his company never accepted cash, only postal orders that were cashed after the football results and the winning payout had been confirmed, his appeal was upheld.

=== Growth ===
Vernons&#x27; Pools was founded in 1925, also in Liverpool, and Zetters was founded 1933 in London. In 1934, the Football Pool Promoters&#x27; Association was formed: besides Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters, its members were the other large pools companies including Cope&#x27;s Pools (based in London), W.S. Murphy (Edinburgh) and Western Pools (Newport). A report by the Royal Commission at the time suggested that the football pools should be prohibited; the pools companies asked their customers to write to their Member of Parliament, which led to the proposals being withdrawn. The Betting and Lotteries Act 1934 was passed on 27 March 1934 which included restrictions of pool betting. The football pools did not fall under gambling legislation (specifically the Betting and Gaming Act 1960 and its predecessors) because they claimed to be competitions of skill, rather than chance; however, their rules typically stated that all transactions were &quot;binding in honour only&quot;. Typically, between one-quarter and half of the entry fees taken would be returned to the players as prizes.

====Pools War====
In 1936, revenue from the 28 pools companies had reached almost £30 million per year, and the pools accounted for four million out of six million postal packets sent weekly in the UK. The English Football League was opposed to the betting and decided to withhold publication of their fixture lists in an attempt to thwart the pools companies&#x27; ability to print their coupons: games involving long journeys were announced on Thursday evening and others on Friday evening. The pools companies retaliated by printing coupons with just the home sides, then managed to obtain unofficial leaks of the fixtures and gave customers longer to get their coupons in. The &quot;Pools War&quot; ended on 9 March 1936 after two weekends where the fixture lists were not published early. A further attempt to ban the pools was proposed in Parliament at a similar time by R.J. Russell but the bill was defeated on 3 April 1936 by 287 votes to 24.

Barnard continued to run his competition until 1938, when he sold to Cope&#x27;s Pools of London. Other pools companies included Brittens (founded 1946 in Leicester), Empire (based in Blackpool) and Sherman&#x27;s Pools of Cardiff, which was absorbed by Littlewoods in 1961.

Dundee United set up a pools competition in 1956 to help fund ground improvements at Tannadice Park. &quot;Taypools&quot;, as their operation is known, became the model for dozens of other club-run pools and lotteries designed to help boost payrolls or build new stands.

====War years====
During World War II, the Post Office refused to deliver the large number of coupons as they were not considered essential, so a Unity Pool organisation was created for the seven largest pools companies to produce joint coupons.

====Treble Chance====
The Treble Chance game was inaugurated in 1946. Players were given a list of football matches set to take place over the coming week and attempted to pick a &quot;line&quot; of eight of them, whose results would be worth the most points by the scoring scheme; traditionally by crossing specific boxes on a printed coupon. A proportion of the players&#x27; combined entry fees was distributed as prizes among those whose entries achieved the highest scores. Prior to this the Penny Points and Penny Results were the most popular games. The Treble Chance offered a potential large jackpot at a time when no other form of gambling in the United Kingdom did. Some pools offered additional ways to win, based on scores of football matches at half-time, or football matches in which a particular number of goals were scored.

By 1947, pools revenue had increased to £70 million a year, with over 90% being spent with Littlewoods, Vernon&#x27;s, Sherman&#x27;s and Cope&#x27;s. It accounted for almost 15 million postal packets each week through the post office. By the 1950s, 100,000 people were working in the industry.

====Agreement with the Football League====
In July 1959, the High Court of Justice ruled that the Football League owned the copyright to their fixture lists and this led to a 10-year agreement between the pools companies and the English and Scottish Football Leagues, whereby the pools companies would pay the leagues 0.5% of the stakes received (or a minimum of £245,000 per year).

During the 1972-73 season, the deal between the Football League and the pools companies was extended for 13 years worth £23 million.

====Off-season====
With professional football not being played in the United Kingdom during the summer, Zetters introduced Australian pools, based on games played in Australia.

=== Mechanics ===
====Entries====
Entries were traditionally made by post, or via agents or collectors who received a percentage (usually 12.5%) of the money as a fee. Main collectors, who appointed the agents, delivered the forms and payments to a regional office, which were then dispatched to the companies&#x27; central offices. Legally the football pools collectors were agents of the entrants, not the pools company. Business for pools collectors was sustained by periodic canvassing, where company agents knocked on doors in an area of a town or housing estate. Many large factories had at least one employee, who as a sideline, collected coupons from fellow workers.

However, many players were unaware that British law left them at the mercy of unscrupulous collectors who took their money but did not submit the coupons. This was because the Gaming Act 1845 made all forms of gambling a &quot;debt of honour&quot; which meant that any dispute about winnings was exempt from legal redress in a court of law. In 1995, a syndicate lost £2.3million when their collector stole their money and did not hand in their coupon. The group wanted to sue the Pools company but it made it clear it did not employ collectors, they were the punters&#x27; agents. The &quot;debt of honour&quot; exemption to taking legal action over unpaid winnings was eventually repealed in the Gambling Act 2005.

A variety of football pools games are now played on the Internet. These include the classic pools game that traditionally includes a large number of fixtures, spanning the weekend. This is the same as the old Treble Chance which has been renamed and rebranded under new ownership. New pools game variants include Jackpot 12, Premier 10 and Soccer 6; these are all games in which the player must correctly predict &quot;home win&quot;, &quot;draw&quot; or &quot;away win&quot; for 12, 10 and six (mainly Premier League) football matches.

====Scoring====
Scoring schemes have varied over the years. The current Classic Pools game, based on the old Treble Chance game, uses a scoring scheme which awards three points to score draws (matches where both team scored the same, strictly positive, number of goals), two points to no-score draws (matches where neither team scored a goal) and one point to both home wins (matches where the home team scored more goals than the away team) and away wins (matches where the away team scored more goals than the home team). The most famous historical scoring scheme differentiated between home wins and away wins, awarding one-and-a-half points for games resulting in away wins. A scoring scheme used for only one year, split score draws into two categories, awarding three points only for matches ending 1–1 and two and a half points for higher-scoring score draws.

The total score of each line would be calculated, up to a maximum of 24 points. The highest scoring line achieved by any player in that particular week&#x27;s competition would be declared to be worth the top dividend, with a large proportion of the prize pool awarded to the players responsible for submitting the highest-scoring lines. Large football pools would award second and subsequent dividends, splitting smaller proportions of the prize pool among players who had submitted lines scoring nearly as many points; at its peak, the Littlewoods Treble Chance game would offer up to six dividends. During the northern hemisphere summer, when football leagues were not in operation in the United Kingdom, competitions were based on the results of football matches taking place in Australia.

As well as this scoring system, the current Classic Pools game has an available top prize of £3 million. In order to secure this £3 million prize, or a share of it, the punter must successfully guess the nine score draws (draws of 1–1 or higher) when these are the only score draws on the coupon.

The other pools games currently provided by The Football Pools are based on entrants predicting the outcome; of results, scores and events in a variety of matches; rather than the awarding of points. Therefore, with the exception of the Premier 10 game (which pays out a smaller dividend for 9/10 correct as well as 10/10 correct), the other games can only be won if all predictions are correct – if they are not all correct then the prize money is rolled over.

====Pools Panel==== 
Matches which were postponed would often have their results adjudicated, for the sake of the football pools results, by a board known as the Pools Panel which had been formed in January 1963 when many football matches were postponed due to the Big Freeze of 1963, a particularly cold winter. Initially, it had five members: ex-footballers Ted Drake, Tom Finney, Tommy Lawton and George Young and ex-referee Arthur Edward Ellis. They predicted 7 draws, 8 away victories and 23 home victories on 23 January 1963 and their predictions were broadcast on television.

The members changed regularly and by 1969, when Raich Carter joined, the other members were Neil Franklin, George Swindin, Arthur Ellis, Stan Mortensen and Ian McColl, under the chairmanship of Sir Ronald Howe. They met in London&#x27;s Connaught Rooms. It was rumoured that their remuneration was considerably in excess of the national wage of the time.

By 1994, the panel members were Ellis, Gordon Banks, Roger Hunt, Tony Green and Maurice Peston, and the panel was meeting at the London Hilton on Park Lane. Other former members include Gerald Nabarro and Ronnie Simpson.

The panel meets in private session each Saturday from November to April. Its decisions are released once all ongoing matches have entered half time, but before any final results are known. By 2016, there were only three members: Banks, Green and Hunt.

After the death of Banks in February 2019 and Hunt&#x27;s retirement from the panel, they were replaced by Ian Callaghan and David Sadler, with Green continuing as a member of the three-man panel.

==== Results ====
Until recently, pools results were published in most national newspapers a day or two after the Saturday on which the matches were played. Grids marking the points totals per game were sometimes published, against which a pools coupon could be aligned to read off the scores.

The BBC television programme &quot;Grandstand&quot; used to broadcast the winning match numbers and any Pools Panel verdicts as part of its Final Score segment in the late afternoon. Pools news was also given out on the BBC radio programme &quot;Sports Report&quot; until May 2007.

With scores being read out on radio and television it was also common to relay the message &quot;claims by telegram&quot; for days when around eight score-draws occurred (and thus few players expected to achieve maximum points), through &quot;claims by registered mail only&quot; for days when rather more winners were expected, to &quot;no claims&quot; when there were likely to be so many claimants that the mail would have been overwhelmed.

With the arrival of internet-based pools games, the need for players to score their own coupons was removed. Automatic scoring and payout is now standard on all internet-based pools games.

====Winning====
Typically, a fraction of a penny would be charged for each line entered, though players often had the option to play each line at a higher stake and so receive a higher share of the pool should their line prove a winner. Accordingly, players would usually submit many different lines in a single entry. Popular ways to do this were &quot;full perm&quot; entries, where 10 (or 11, or more) matches were selected and every possible combination of eight matches selected from the total was entered as a single line. As there are C(10,8) = 45 ways to select eight matches from 10, the cost of such an entry was 45 times the cost of entering a single line. Note that the term &quot;perm&quot; was used despite the relevant mathematical operation being combination rather than permutation, as the order in which the eight matches were selected was irrelevant. The pools companies, many daily newspapers and the sporting press also issued &quot;plans&quot;, which were subsets of full perms: these enabled the punter to cover more matches for the same stake, with the proviso that even if eight draws were in the selections, they might not all be in a single line of the plan (but well designed plans could give a guarantee, such as &#x27;if the plan hits eight draws it must win at least a third dividend&#x27;).

The largest prizes would be awarded when only one line was entered scoring the maximum number of points; typically this would occur when only eight or nine matches ended in score draws, so only one player would have the line scoring the maximum. The odds for selecting 8 draws from 55 matches (if there are only 8 draws) for an all correct line is 1,217,566 to 1 against. These biggest &quot;jackpot&quot; prizes could be several hundred thousand pounds, sometimes more than a million. Prizes depended on the number of players and the cost per line, which varied between pools companies and increased over the years. One large winner, Viv Nicholson, gained notoriety by declaring she was going to &quot;spend, spend, spend&quot; after winning £152,319 in 1961. The story of her subsequent extravagance and eventual bankruptcy was eventually made into a musical named after her assertion.

At the other extreme, payouts of less than a pound were quite common, as lower dividends when many entries won. Most players could expect to receive at least one low payout if they played for long enough. The odds of winning were around 80 to 1. 

In its current form, the Classic Pools game has a top prize of £3 million, separate to the pool prize that is given to the highest point scorer(s). In order to secure this £3 million prize, or a share of it, the punter must successfully guess the nine score draws (draws of 1–1 or higher) when these are the only score draws on the coupon.

With the arrival of the latest online pools games such as Premier 10 and Super 6, the overall pool size is less than the Classic Pools game, but the odds of winning a major prize are increased because fewer predictions are required to complete a coupon and, also, fewer individuals play each coupon.

===Historic wins===
In 1972, two people won approximately £1.5 million each on the state run Italian pools. In September 1975, Miron Vieira de Sousa, from the city of Ivolândia in Brazil, won a prize of 22 million Brazilian cruzeiros ($2.5 million), considered at the time &quot;the biggest prize in Loteca and in the world, in prediction contests&quot;. In 1981, Tadeu Resende of Volta Redonda won $3,003,532 on the Brazilian football pools, Loteria Esportiva, the world&#x27;s biggest gambling win at the time. In December 1993, the Italian pools saw their highest jackpot ever recorded with 34 billion lire (£14 million). Some notable UK football pools winners:

===Other games===
Other games offered by football pools companies take the form of &quot;8 homes&quot;, &quot;4 draws&quot;, &quot;5 aways&quot; or the like, where lines consisting of a smaller number of matches are selected and a line is deemed to have won if all the selected matches result in home wins, away wins or draws (irrelevant of the size of the draw) respectively. The cost per line is generally higher; because these attract far fewer players, prizes are generally lower. Some football pools companies additionally organised lotteries, betting on lottery results or spot the ball competitions at various points.

In predicting &quot;Homes and Aways&quot;, players typically mark more than, for example, eight homes (they might mark 13) and thus their stake increases by the mathematics of combinations. Each line is called a &quot;perm&quot; (&quot;permutation&quot;) even though it is actually a mathematical &quot;combination&quot; not a permutation. It is also possible to reduce the number of perms by taking the most likely and marking them as &quot;bankers&quot; i.e. that they appear on every combination.

===Tax===
Companies organising football pools were heavily taxed; in 1991, the levy was reduced from 40% of turnover to 37½% of turnover. Additionally, from 1975 on, 2½% of the entry fees went to form the Football Trust which distributed money to football throughout the UK, in particular to help clubs redevelop their stadiums in line with the recommendations made by the Taylor Report.
The business was a reliable source of cash for the pools companies. Each week the money staked was received by the pools company, they deducted their costs, paid the tax, then deducted their profit. What was left was then the prize money available to the winners.

===Charitable giving===
The Football Pools have donated over £1.1 billion to sporting-related causes. During the 2009/10 football season a further £6 million was donated to football initiatives including the following
* The Every Player Counts scheme – to grow disability football provision across 44 Football League clubs in England and Wales and increase the opportunities for people with varying disabilities to access sports through their local Football Clubs
* The Premier League Health scheme – to help tackle a range of men’s health issues including testicular cancer, depression and alcoholism
* The Fit for Football, Fit for Life scheme – to help tackle serious health issues for young people across 30 Scottish Football League clubs

=== Decline ===
Competition from the National Lottery led to a rapid fall-off in players, from a peak of 10 million in 1994 to 700,000 in 2007. Vernons closed its pools operation in February 1998, and ran a lucky-dip game called Easy Play with the National Lottery during the 1998–99 football season. It resumed its traditional business afterwards.

In 2000, Littlewoods Pools was sold for £161 million. The company became part of Littlewoods Gaming, a division of Sportech. Sportech bought Zetters in 2002 and Vernons (which had previously been acquired by betting company Ladbrokes in 1989) in 2007, and announced plans to rebrand the competition as The New Football Pools, launching online at footballpools.com during summer 2008. The competition became known as The Football Pools and provided classic football pools games alongside other pools variants, with coupons containing a smaller number of football matches. Sportech sold the business to private equity firm OpCapita in 2017.

The Littlewoods Football Pools Collection, which records the history of the pools, is held by the National Football Museum.

==In other countries==
Outside the United Kingdom, similar betting games are frequently known as toto competitions; the name derives from totalisator machines which are used to process the parimutuel betting involved. While the principle of requiring entrants to predict the results of football matches in advance remains the same, the format is similar to the British Jackpot 12, Premier 10 and Soccer 6.

Typically, a list of 13 matches for the coming week will be given. Pools entrants select the result of each one, whether it will be a home win, an away win or neither of these, typically by marking each match with either a 1, a 2 or an &quot;N&quot; (sometimes &quot;X&quot; or 0). It is possible to enter two or three results for one or more matches, in which case the entry is treated as a number of separate entries for all possible combinations given; marking two possible results for each of five matches and all three possible results for each of four matches will result in submitting 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 32 × 81 = 2592 different entries. All entries submitting 13 correct predictions will be declared to have won the top prize; sometimes, prizes for fewer correct predictions are also awarded.

In 1946, Italy introduced a state-run pool for citizens to bet on football, called the &quot;Totocalcio&quot;. It was the only form of legalized football betting in the country until the late 1990s. For fans to win, they needed to correctly pick the outcome of 12 games. A thirteenth game was added in 1951, and a fourteenth (but still called Thirteen) in 2003. Players can win with 9 or more correct predictions. Outside the football season, it is renamed &quot;Totosport&quot; to include predictions for other sporting events such as Formula 1 and cycling. The bets help finance the Italian National Olympic Committee for which it was awarded their Golden Star for sporting merit in 1997.

The Intertoto Cup football competition was inaugurated by the football pools companies of central Europe to provide matches for their toto coupons during the summer months.

In Brazil, &quot;Loteria Esportiva&quot; was introduced in 1970 by Caixa Econômica Federal. It was necessary to match the results of thirteen games. The competition went nationwide in 1972. Between 1972 and 1980, there were 17 million weekly bets. In December 1987, the competition increased to cover 16 matches but returned back to 13 in 1989 and was renamed &quot;Loteca&quot;. It is currently based on 14 matches with the odds of predicting correctly being 1 chance in 2,391,485.

In Australia, the Soccer Pools game, which ran until 2018, operated under a similar premise to traditional pools, but was instead played in a Lotto-style format. The numbers of the seven matches ranked &quot;highest&quot; in a list of 38 (with void games replaced by reserves if necessary) became the six winning and one supplementary (bonus) number respectively. Tie-breakers allowed all 38 games to be ranked in order, for instance preferencing higher-scoring draws (eg. 2-2 would rank higher than 1-1) with the final tie-breaker being match number itself.

==In popular culture==
The pools feature prominently in the British films &quot;Easy Money&quot; (1948) and &quot;Home and Away&quot; (1956) starring Jack Warner, the Italian films &quot;Audace colpo dei soliti ignoti&quot; (1959) and &quot;Al bar dello sport&quot; (1983), and the Spanish films &quot;La quiniela&quot; (1960) and &quot;Jenaro, el de los 14&quot; (1974). In &quot;The Football Pools,&quot; the final episode of the fifth television series of &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; (1959), Tony Hancock has picked seven draws and nervously attends a late-kickoff match with the eighth draw and top dividend on the line. Viv Nicholson&#x27;s life after her win of more than £152,000 in 1961 was made into the musical &quot;Spend Spend Spend&quot;. Charles Causley&#x27;s poem &quot;Timothy Winters&quot; begins &quot;Timothy Winters comes to school, With eyes as wide as a football pool&quot;. This was used prominently by Christopher Eccleston&#x27;s character in &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot;, a 1995 television series.
In 2022 historical comedy drama film Mrs Harris Goes to Paris, set in 1957, the title character becomes obsessed with a Christian Dior dress owned by one of her clients and after a big win on the football pools she sets out to save up the money to go to Paris and buy her own dress.

<text>Lakorn ( related to Javanese ꦭꦏꦺꦴꦤ꧀ &quot;lakon&quot; from ꦭꦏꦸ &quot;laku&quot; &quot;behavior&quot;) or &quot;lakhon&quot; is a popular genre of fiction in Thai television known in Thai as (lit. &quot;television drama&quot;). They are shown generally at prime-time on Thai television channels, starting usually on, before or approximately at 20:25-20:30 hrs local time. An episode of a prime-time drama is between 45 minutes to two hours long including commercials. Each series is a finished story, unlike Western &quot;cliffhanger&quot; dramas, but rather like Hispanic telenovelas.

The first television drama in Thailand was &quot;Suriyani Mai Yom Taengngan&quot; (สุริยานีไม่ยอมแต่งงาน, lit. &quot;Suriyani sent a mitten&quot;) starring Mom Rajawongse Thanadsri Svasti and Chotirot Samosorn with Nuanla-or Thongnuedee from the composition of Nai Ramkarn (Prayad Sor Nakanat) broadcast on January 5, 1956, on Channel 4 Bangkhunphrom (now Channel 9), the first Thai television station. It can be considered the broadcast happened only two months after the establishment of the station.

A series will run for about three months. It may air two or three episodes a week, the pattern being Monday–Tuesday, Wednesday–Thursday Monday-Thursday (weekday slots) or Friday–Sunday (weekend slot). A channel will air three soap operas simultaneously at any given time (each producing their own series by separate production houses). Channels will compete for the most popular stars as they attract the most viewers. Some examples are Channel 3, 5, and 7 as well to a lesser extent on Channel 9.

While the &quot;best&quot; series are shown at night right after the news, the ones with a smaller profiles (and shorter run times) will be shown in the evenings from 17:00–18:00. In some cases, the most popular prime-time series are shown on re-runs a couple of years after their initial release, generally in the afternoon.

A lakorn episode is normally 1 hour or 30 minutes. When broadcasting internationally, the running time is around 45 min. per episode.

Since January 20, 2023, every Friday night after the evening news (second edition), Channel 7 stopped broadcasting the television series as it became familiar. The station has turned to live broadcasts of combat sport matches of the ONE Championship instead, which is one of the great revolutions in the Thai television industry.

And since September 6 of the same year, Channel 7 has been given a new television series broadcast time of 20:30–21:30, a total of only one hour, and there will be only one television series broadcast from Monday to Thursday. As for Saturday–Sunday will broadcast another television series. When after 21:30, the station will broadcast Korean drama starting from &quot;Ghost Doctor&quot; (2022).

Around mid-2024, Thai television dramas are in crisis due to a dramatic decline in television viewership. Most viewers have turned to watching dramas in the form of &quot;series&quot;, including foreign series such as Chinese or Korean, as well as watching on various streaming channels such as Netflix. As a result, advertising on various free TV channels has greatly decreased, many actors are out of work. &quot;The Legend of Nang Nak&quot;, 2024 version of Mae Nak Phra Khanong on Channel 3 that directed by Taweewat Wantha, the director of the horror films &quot;Death Whisperer&quot; and &quot;Death Whisperer 2&quot;, which was originally scheduled to air on July 16, was postponed indefinitely when the time came. The station has been re-running the old dramas. Many channels have slowed down their drama production. Veteran actor and drama producer couple Chatchai and Sinjai Plengpanich have closed down their production company.

&quot;The Legend of Nang Nak&quot; finally aired its first episode on October 14 same year.

== Genre ==
Romance, Comedy, Thriller, Action, Psychological, etc. Apart from Lakorn, Boys Love or BL series are booming across the globe.

== Folk stories ==
Thai television soap operas have contributed to popularize the spirits and legends of the folklore of Thailand. Some soap operas, such as &quot;Raeng Ngao&quot;, include the popular ghosts in Thai culture interacting with the living, while others are based on traditional Thai legends and folk tales such as &quot;Nang Sib Song&quot;, &quot;Kaki&quot; and &quot;Thep Sarm Rudoo&quot;.

== Law ==
Thailand has strict censorship laws on films containing nudity, sexual intercourse, smoking opium, or which might offend religious sensibilities. There are no classifications to rate films for different ages so censors often obscure scenes by scratching the celluloid or smudging it with a translucent gel. When actors are playing cards in TV series, a sentence displays that playing cards with money is forbidden by the law.

On Thai television, Chinese, Japanese, American, and Indian films are broadcast.

Some series are subject to a rating. Most of BBTV Channel 7 programs are usually rated as PG-18 (children under 18 should seek parental guidance).

== International broadcasts ==
Prior to the 2000s, Thai TV soap operas were primarily popular in neighbouring countries such as Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos. Several Cambodian television channels aired Thai soap operas instead of their local ones. &quot;Dao Pra Sook&quot; was the most popular series for Khmer viewers. Occasionally, due to historical conflicts between the neighbouring countries, the content of these television programs would lead to offline political conflicts. For example, a plot line concerning Angkor Wat led to riots at the Thai embassy in Cambodia and Thai lakorn were banned in early–2003. However, in 2015, Thai content rapidly returned to popularity amongst Cambodian viewers and while they&#x27;re mainly viewed on online platforms, many television stations were also broadcasting Thai dramas.

Apart from their immediate neighbours, Thai dramas have become increasingly popular in other Southeast Asian countries. Over the years, several Thai TV soap operas have begun to become popular in Singapore as &quot;Nang Tard&quot; and &quot;Love Destiny&quot; aired successfully in that country. They are usually broadcast in Singapore one or two weeks after airing in Thailand, primarily on Mediacorp&#x27;s Channel U. In 2020, Mediacorp announced that they will be airing a comprehensive set of Thai television content to their streaming platforms with English &amp; Mandarin subtitling option. Several Thai hit series have also been broadcast on major national public or commercial television channels in Malaysia (TV3), Indonesia (Rajawali TV), and Vietnam (VTV1). Likewise, Thai content has also gained considerable following in the Philippines, with numerous Thai series such as &quot;2gether: The Series&quot; and The Gifted, regularly topping Twitter trends in the country. In 2018, GMA announced that they will be broadcasting more Thai series and exploring collaboration options for production and talent development. ABS-CBN have also announced that they will be airing multiple Thai series on the Kapamilya channel and their streaming platform, as well as further partnership with GMMTV. Filipino newspaper Daily Tribune stated that &quot;Thai lakorn (“television play”)...is slowly inching its way to the top of the tier.&quot;

Outside Southeast Asia, Thai television content has also gained popularity in the broader Asian region. In the 2000&#x27;s, many Thai soap operas aired in China, were dubbed into Chinese language. With the advent of online and digital media, Thai television content continued to gain popularity in China through word of mouth and viral hits on social networking sites such as Bilibili &amp; Weibo. By the late 2010&#x27;s, Thai content became a mainstay in Chinese streaming platforms, which led to many Chinese companies forming partnerships and collaborating with Thai production companies, such as iQIYI forming a partnership with RS Television to remake Thai content for Chinese audiences. Over the years, numerous Thai series were adapted and remade for Chinese audiences through such collaborations as Project S: The Series &amp; My Husband in Law. In 2011, Thai dramas quickly became popular in China, with a high performance-price-ratio, passing South Korean dramas as the second most popular country of origin for foreign shows in China, following Hong Kong dramas. The rise of Thai entertainment in China has had an effect in other aspects of Thai-China relations, with Thai dramas credited as being partially responsible for the popularity of Thailand as a tourism destination amongst Chinese travellers and being consistently awarded as &#x27;Weibo&#x27;s most popular destination&#x27; award. Meanwhile in Japan, Thai dramas experienced a boom in 2020, with Yahoo Japan stating that &quot;the Thai wave is coming after the Korean wave.&quot; While the initial boom was led by Thai BL dramas such as &quot;2gether: The Series&quot; and , the introduction of Thai entertainment to the Japanese market led Japanese consumers to explore other Thai entertainment content as well. After months of sustained popularity, TV Asahi announced a business partnership with GMMTV to &quot;deliver fresh and stellar Thai content to the Japanese market and further unlock the great potential &#x27;Thai style&#x27; entertainment holds&quot;. In India, Thai BL dramas have increased in popularity among Indian women since the early 2020s. In 2023, Indian streaming platform MX Player began broadcasting Hindi-dubbed Thai dramas on its platform for the South Asian market. 

With its rising popularity, numerous streaming platforms such as Netflix, Line TV and WeTV have purchased Thai content to stream to global audiences. Aside from airing the content, many of the streaming platforms have also formed partnership with Thai production houses to develop their own original content for their platforms.

Thai soap operas are available in Nepal alongside English language, Hindi, Korean and Chinese dramas.

Thai soap operas are available to stream with subtitles on Iflix in Sri Lanka.

Recently, a historical romantic drama set in the Ayutthaya Kingdom &quot;Love Destiny&quot; (2018) became hit across countries including Russia.

In 2021, Thai primetime Lakorns have started to broadcast via Netflix worldwide in the same as in Thailand.

<doc id="892084" wikidata="Q1344767" url="?curid=892084" title="William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie">
<text>William James Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie, KP, PC, PC (Ire) (31 May 1847 – 7 June 1924) was a leading British shipbuilder and businessman. He was chairman of Harland &amp; Wolff, shipbuilders, between 1895 and 1924, and also served as Lord Mayor of Belfast between 1896 and 1898. He was ennobled as Baron Pirrie in 1906, appointed a Knight of the Order of St Patrick in 1908 and made Viscount Pirrie in 1921. In the months leading up to the 1912 Sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, Lord Pirrie was questioned about the number of life boats aboard the s. He responded that the great ships were unsinkable and the rafts were to save others. This would haunt him forever. In Belfast he was, on other grounds, already a controversial figure: a Protestant employer associated as a leading Liberal with a policy of Home Rule for Ireland.

==Background==
Pirrie was born in Quebec City, Canada East. He was taken back to Ireland when he was two years old and spent his childhood at Conlig House, aka Little Clandeboye Conlig, County Down. Belonging to a prominent family, his nephews included J. M. Andrews, who would later become Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Thomas Andrews, builder of RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, and Sir James Andrews, 1st Baronet, the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland.

==Career==

Pirrie was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution before entering Harland and Wolff shipyard as a gentleman apprentice in 1862. Twelve years later he was made a partner in the firm, and on the death of Sir Edward Harland in 1895 he became its chairman, a position he was to hold until his death. As well as overseeing the world&#x27;s largest shipyard, Pirrie was elected Lord Mayor of Belfast in 1896, and was re-elected to the office as well as made an Irish Privy Counsellor the following year. He became Belfast&#x27;s first honorary freeman in 1898, and served in the same year as High Sheriff of Antrim and subsequently of County Down. In February 1900 he was elected President of the Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom, where he had been vice-president the previous year. He helped finance the Liberals in Ulster in the 1906 general election, and that same year, at the height of Harland and Wolff&#x27;s success, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Pirrie, of the City of Belfast.

In 1907 Pirrie was appointed Comptroller of the Household to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and in 1908 he was appointed Knight of St Patrick (KP). Pro-Chancellor of The Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast from 1908 to 1914 Pirrie was also in the years before the First World War a member of the Committee on Irish Finance as well as Lieutenant for the City of Belfast (both 1911)

In February 1912, after chairing a famous meeting of the Ulster Liberal Association at which Winston Churchill defended the government&#x27;s policy of Home Rule for Ireland, Pirrie was jeered on the streets of Belfast, and assaulted as he boarded a steamer in Larne: pelted with rotten eggs, herrings, and bags of flour. In 1910, the Ulster Liberal Association, an overwhelmingly Protestant body, with a weekly newspaper, and branch network throughout Ulster, had adopted (in opposition to the Ulster Liberal Unionist Association) an explicitly pro-home rule position.

Two months later, April 1912, he was to travel aboard RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, but illness prevented him. During the war he was a member of the War Office Supply Board, and in 1918 became Comptroller-General of Merchant Shipbuilding, organising British production of merchant ships.

In 1921 Pirrie was elected to the Northern Ireland Senate, and that same year was created Viscount Pirrie, of the City of Belfast, in the honours for the opening of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in July 1921, for his war work and charity work.
== Personal life ==

Lord Pirrie married Margaret Montgomery Carlisle, sister of future Harland &amp; Wolff architect Alexander Carlisle and daughter of John Carlisle, M.A., of Belfast, on 17 April 1879. In 1909 Lord Pirrie bought Witley Park, formerly the residence of Whitaker Wright.
The letter P with a coronet above adorn metal gates and fence posts in the estate and previously owned lands.

Pirrie built the Temple of the Four Winds near the Devil&#x27;s Punchbowl, Hindhead. The octagonal plinth still remains. Lord Pirrie&#x27;s nephew, Thomas Andrews, died on RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;.

==Death==
In March 1924 Pirrie, his wife, and her sister sailed on a Royal Mail Steam Packet Company liner from Southampton on a business trip to South America. They travelled overland from Buenos Aires to Chile, where they embarked aboard the Pacific Steam Navigation Company&#x27;s &#x27;. Pirrie caught pneumonia in Antofagasta, and his condition worsened when the ship reached Iquique. At Panama City two nurses embarked to care for him. By then he was very weak, but insisted on being brought on deck to see the canal. He admired how &#x27; was handled through the locks.
On 7 June Pirrie died at sea off Cuba. His body was embalmed. On 13 June &quot;&quot; reached Pier 42 on the North River in New York, where Pirrie&#x27;s friend Baron Inverforth and his wife met Viscountess Pirrie and her sister. UK ships in the port of New York lowered their flags to half-mast, and Pirrie&#x27;s body was transferred to Pier 59, where it was embarked on White Star Line&#x27;s , one of the largest ships Pirrie ever built, to be repatriated to the UK. He was buried in Belfast City Cemetery. The barony and viscountcy died with him. Lady Pirrie died on 19 June 1935. A memorial to Pirrie in the grounds of Belfast City Hall was unveiled in 2006.

<text>Lucire ( , ; ) is a fashion magazine that originally began on the web in 1997, before adding a monthly print edition in its home country of New Zealand in 2004, and is now published seasonally, with a monthly for licensees. It is the first fashion partner with the UNEP, an arrangement that began in 2003. In 1999, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar Australia&quot; listed &quot;Lucire&quot; in its &quot;A-list of Style&quot; supplement. In 2018, &quot;Lucire&quot; was listed by &quot;StyleCaster&quot; as one of the &quot;21 International Fashion Magazines That Should Be on Your Radar.&quot; In 2022, &quot;LUXlife&quot; named &quot;Lucire&quot; its &quot;Most Pioneering Online Fashion Magazine&quot;, and in 2025, they awarded it &quot;Best Digital Fashion Magazine&quot;.

==History==
At its launch, it was the second online fashion title in New Zealand (after Wellington Polytechnic&#x27;s &quot;Fashionbrat&quot;), and the first commercial fashion magazine on the web there. With &quot;Fashionbrat&quot; lasting only one issue, &quot;Lucire&quot; is the longest running online fashion magazine in New Zealand. It claims to be the first fashion title to extend its brand from the internet into print, and the first website to launch print editions in more than one country.

Summer Rayne Oakes was made the US Editor in 2007 and subsequently editor-at-large. Stanley Moss serves as travel editor and Elyse Glickman its US west coast editor. Sopheak Seng became its fashion editor in 2010. Qurratulain Wahab edits &quot;Lucire KSA&quot; in Saudi Arabia. &quot;Lucire&quot; was founded by Jack Yan, who continues to serve as publisher.

When conceived, the name was not intended to have a meaning; it was only later that the team discovered it was a quaint Romanian term meaning &#x27;the act of glowing or glittering&#x27;.

In the early 2000s, &quot;Lucire&quot; covered new talent alongside more established names. It was one of the first publications to profile actress Gal Gadot, designer Zac Posen, MTV New Zealand presenter and former beauty queen Amber Peebles, and numerous others. In 2003, it was the second-ever New Zealand website to be nominated for a Webby Award.

Print edition cover girls have included Gal Gadot, Laura Vandervoort, Violett Beane, Denise Richards, Javicia Leslie, Camille Hyde, Brittny Gastineau, Vanessa Carlton, Sarah McLachlan, Stacie Jones Upchurch, Nicky Hilton, Theodora Richards, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, Rachel Hilbert, and Andrea Kevichüsa.

==International editions==

&quot;Lucire&quot; launched its first international edition in Romania (helmed by Mirella and Valentin Lapusca) in May 2005, claiming to be the first New Zealand fashion magazine to enter the continent, and the first webzine in the world to launch two print editions. A Thai edition, &quot;Twinpalms Lucire&quot;, launched in 2008 in conjunction with Twinpalms Resort. Additionally, &quot;Vox&quot; magazine in Qatar was briefly launched in conjunction with &quot;Lucire&quot;, while a one-off Bahraini edition appeared in 2014. In 2018 &quot;Lucire KSA&quot; was launched in Saudi Arabia, as a monthly English-language magazine. &quot;Lucire KSA&quot; is now supplied in the first and business classes of the national carrier Saudia, and in their airport lounges. &quot;Lucire Rouge&quot;, a US edition, appeared in 2020, extending the magazine&#x27;s coverage into wellness. A French-language edition of &quot;Lucire KSA&quot; appeared in 2021.

<text>The &quot;Friday night death slot&quot; or &quot;Friday evening death slot&quot; is a perceived graveyard slot in American television. It implies that a television program in the United States scheduled on Friday evenings (typically, between 8:00 and 11:00 p.m. ET) is likely to be canceled.

The term possibly began as a reflection of certain programs&#x27; dominance of Friday night in the 1980s and 1990s, which resulted in decreased ratings for those scheduled at the same time. By the 2000s, it was used in reference to the belief that young, single Americans rarely watch television on Friday or Saturday nights, thereby removing from the household what is considered the most lucrative demographic for advertisers. With the collapse of the traditional network viewing model where viewers had to be in front of the TV to watch shows (and then the evolution from VCR or DVR capabilities to almost all shows being viewed increasingly through on-demand streaming media), the stigma of Friday night scheduling is much less evident or considered today than in the past.

==Programs affected by the &quot;death slot&quot;==

=== NBC ===
One of the earliest and most famous examples of the &quot;Friday Night Death Slot&quot; phenomenon was the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; on NBC.

The second season of &quot;Star Trek&quot; aired on Fridays from 8:30–9:30 p.m. (Eastern Time). Although NBC discussed plans to move it to a 7:30–8:30 p.m. slot on Mondays for mid-season, that never occurred. The poor ratings in the time slot affected the show after it, Jerry Van Dyke&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Accidental Family&quot;, leading to its failure after less than a season and angering Van Dyke, who was desperate for a hit and openly (but unsuccessfully) campaigned for NBC to give the show a better time slot. After &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans deluged NBC with a mail-in protest, producer Gene Roddenberry stated that he was promised the same 8:30–9:30 time slot for Season 3, but airing on Monday instead of Friday. However, that would have meant &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; had to start a half-hour later (moving from 9:00 to 9:30). &quot;Laugh-In&quot; producer George Schlatter saw no reason why his show, which was a ratings smash at the time, had to yield its slot to the poorly rated &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and he made no secret of his displeasure. &quot;Star Trek&quot; instead remained on Fridays, moving to the even less desirable 10:00 p.m. timeslot (one that had been used mainly for filler and throwaway documentaries the previous season). Roddenberry lamented, &quot;If the network wants to kill us, it couldn&#x27;t make a better move.&quot;

The following are examples of NBC shows that started on Friday nights and lasted for a few episodes, or were moved to Friday nights, lost the battle for television ratings, and were eventually canceled:
===CBS===
CBS was the most successful network on Friday nights in the 1980s due to their hit shows &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, but both shows were struggling by the end of the decade and were cancelled in the early 1990s. In an effort to revive Friday night television in the 1990s, and to compete with ABC&#x27;s successful TGIF block of family comedies airing opposite it, CBS first attempted to compete with ABC launching a comedy night in the fall of 1992 with &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; (a spin-off/continuation of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;), &quot;Major Dad&quot; and &quot;Designing Women&quot;, along with a new sitcom from Bob Newhart, &quot;Bob&quot;. &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; had been a top-10 hit on Saturday nights for NBC (though it had fallen to 30th in its final season), while &quot;Major Dad&quot; and &quot;Designing Women&quot; had also been top-10 hits on Monday nights, and Newhart&#x27;s previous sitcom, &quot;Newhart&quot;, had spent most of its run in the top 30. Nevertheless, this effort failed, and only &quot;Bob&quot; was renewed for the 1993–1994 season, only to end in December 1993. A later effort to counterprogram TGIF, the CBS Block Party (which included former TGIF series &quot;Family Matters&quot; and &quot;Step by Step&quot;, both of which were hits for several years while on ABC before both shows were canceled in 1997), met a similar fate in the fall of 1997.

In 2013, CBS moved &quot;Vegas&quot; to Friday nights to make room for &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, another police drama. Both shows were eventually cancelled during their first year.

In general, however, CBS has found ways, particularly in the years following the cancellation of the Block Party, to be at least somewhat more successful in the Friday night time slots than its broadcast competitors.

The following are all examples of CBS shows that either started on Friday nights and lasted a few episodes, or moved to Friday nights, lost the battle for television ratings, and were eventually cancelled:

CBS has aired &quot;MacGyver&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; and &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; in that order on Friday night between 2016 and 2020.

===ABC===
TGIF was a successful block for ABC, which ran from 1989 to 2000 (although the network had been running a sitcom block on Fridays beginning in 1987); it focused primarily on family-friendly sitcoms. The network had also had success with a block featuring &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; and &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; in the same time slots during the early 1970s. Following the slow collapse of TGIF in the late 1990s, Friday night has fallen into a lower priority for the network. The following are examples of ABC network shows that started on Friday nights and lasted a few episodes, or were moved to Friday nights, lost the battle for television ratings, and were eventually canceled:

In September 2018, ABC cleared the 9:00 p.m. Eastern time slot on Friday nights to make room for the expansion of &quot;20/20&quot; to two hours as a result of ABC News changing the program&#x27;s format to include true crime stories in an attempt to address the program&#x27;s declining viewership.

===Fox===
Perhaps the network which has received the most attention and has become the most well known for the &quot;Friday Night Death Slot&quot; has been Fox.

The following are all examples of Fox shows that either started on Friday nights and lasted only a few episodes, or were moved to Friday nights, suffered from dismal ratings, and were eventually canceled.

In January 2011, the sci-fi drama &quot;Fringe&quot;, then in its third season, was moved into this slot from Thursdays. According to Fox Entertainment President Kevin Reilly, nearly half of &quot;Fringe&quot;″s viewership time shifts the show to watch at their convenience, and that &quot;if it does anywhere near what it did on Thursdays, we can glue that show to the schedule because it can be a big win for us&quot;. The Fox network created a promotional advertisement for &quot;Fringe&quot; that lampooned its reputation of the Friday night death slot prior to &quot;Fringe&quot;″s move. Despite encountering lower ratings after its move, &quot;Fringe&quot; was renewed for a fourth season, and later for a shortened final fifth season to allow the creators to complete the story arc they had set out at the start of the program as well as to reach 100 episodes, allowing the show to be resold in syndication. Critics praised Fox for taking the risk and profit lost on the show to satisfy the creators&#x27; desires and fans&#x27; requests to complete the show&#x27;s primary story. The series finale aired on January 18, 2013.

After 20 years of unsuccessfully trying to find programming to fill the Friday night death slot, Fox gave up, leaving a one-hour empty hole on that night in the 9:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) hour for the 2013–14 schedule. Encores of Fox programming from the previous week originally aired in that timeslot. However, in November 2013, in the hopes of revitalizing Fox&#x27;s Friday ratings, the sitcom &quot;Raising Hope&quot; moved from Tuesdays to Fridays for its fourth season, airing in the 9 p.m. half-hour; the freshman sitcom, &quot;Enlisted&quot; premiered in the 9:30 p.m. slot before both series swapped timeslots in late January. This &quot;encore slot&quot; was made a permanent part of the schedule for the 2014–15 season. Fox did not include such a slot in 2015–16, but the show chosen to fill the 9:00 p.m. time slot was the low-budget panel game &quot;World&#x27;s Funniest Fails&quot;. 

In October 2019, Fox cleared its Friday night time slots to make way for &quot;WWE SmackDown&quot;, which ran on the network until September 2024, after which the show moved to USA Network. Following the end of the show&#x27;s run on Fox, the network would make sports programming a permanent part of its Friday night schedule, including college football, college basketball, and its own in-house league, the UFL.

=== The WB ===
===Other networks===
&quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot; was first broadcast on UPN on Thursdays to compete with &quot;WCW Thunder&quot; (eventually forcing &quot;Thunder&quot; to Wednesdays because of high ratings for &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, before a majority of the assets belonging to WCW were ultimately purchased by Vince McMahon in 2001). UPN moved the show to Friday nights in the United States on September 9, 2005, because of low ratings in its original Thursday night slot, and the show retained its Friday night time slot after moving to The CW in September 2006. Upon its move to the &quot;death slot,&quot; UPN/The CW Friday nights saw a substantial &quot;increase&quot; in ratings over UPN&#x27;s movies and most of The WB&#x27;s sitcoms. &quot;SmackDown!&quot; had also initially garnered even better ratings in the death slot than the ratings on its former Thursday night airings (after WCW was bought by the WWF in 2001). Despite this, The CW chose not to renew &quot;SmackDown&quot;″s contract in 2008 due to the change of the demographic of the network&#x27;s viewers (shifting more towards women 12–34 years of age), and the show moved to MyNetworkTV that fall, eventually leaving network television altogether with a move to Syfy in 2010. &quot;SmackDown&quot; then moved to the USA Network in 2016, thus sharing the same network as WWE&#x27;s flagship show, &quot;Raw&quot;. As previously noted, the show moved to Fox and return to Friday nights in 2019.

UPN also moved &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; to Friday nights at the start of its fourth and final season in 2004. UPN was subject to heavy sports pre-emptions by local affiliates on Friday nights in the Major League Baseball, high school football, and NHL/NBA seasons, pushing it to late night. A good number of viewers thus chose to watch the show&#x27;s weekend repeat whenever it was offered by their UPN affiliate, though the network and the show&#x27;s Internet fanbase heavily discouraged watching it, as it was an unrated airing by Nielsen.

In the spring of 2015, The CW&#x27;s &quot;Cedric&#x27;s Barber Battle&quot; fell victim to the Friday night death slot, only airing 8 episodes out of the 10 produced before being pulled off the schedule completely.

==Exceptions==
Despite its reputation, Friday night prime time has also seen numerous successful series run for multiple years. The aforementioned &quot;Dallas&quot; rated in the Top 10 of the Nielsen ratings for seven consecutive seasons and was the top-rated series for three of those seasons. It had also aired the all-time most watched non-series finale single U.S. television episode (in the 1980 resolution episode of the internationally prominent Who Shot J.R. cliffhanger). &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, which preceded &quot;Dallas&quot; on Friday nights from 1979 to 1985, was rated in the Top 20 in the Nielsen ratings during its first four seasons before falling in the ratings in its fifth (the season in which series stars John Schneider and Tom Wopat left due to their salaries and merchandising royalties), sixth, and seventh seasons. &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, which aired on Friday nights during most of its run, went for five seasons to decent success in the ratings before being abruptly and controversially cancelled midway through its fifth season. In the 1990s, two shows that found a lot of success on Friday nights were Fox&#x27;s &quot;The X-Files&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. The former show did so well on Fridays that it became an attractive option for the network to try and move past an all-comedy Sunday night lineup when it made the move to 9 p.m. EST in 1996 (and did well for several years afterwards), while the latter was mainly placed on Friday nights because NBC&#x27;s dominant 1990s lineup simply had no place for the show on any other prime one-hour spot (it was considered for the Thursday 10 p.m. EST spot heading into the 1994–95 season, but the network decided to go with &quot;ER&quot; there instead).

&quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, which aired after &quot;Dallas&quot; from 1981 to 1990, went for nine seasons with successful ratings, reaching the Top 25 in the Nielsen ratings in its first six seasons before dropping in the ratings in its final three seasons. In the 1970s, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; managed to crack the Top 10 throughout its run except in its final season, despite airing its entire run on Friday nights. &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, which only cracked the Top 30 in its first season, ran for six seasons on NBC on Friday nights and received critical acclaim by being nominated for eighteen Emmys, winning five. During the 1980s, NBC aired the popular police drama &quot;Miami Vice&quot; on Friday nights for five seasons. Its popularity was due to the show&#x27;s fashions, pastel colors, expensive cars, and incorporation of various popular songs of that era in the show, which resonated with younger fans who were really into images that they had seen on MTV at the time. Annual telecasts of the movie &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; were aired by CBS on Friday nights beginning in 1979 with success after many years of Sunday evening airings.

ABC was often successful Friday night especially with family-friendly sitcoms. During several periods since 1989 ABC has branded their Friday night programming block TGIF. TGIF series have included &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; and &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;. ABC Friday night sitcoms successes prior to TGIF include &quot;Benson&quot;, &quot;Webster&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot;. During the early 1970s, ABC had a successful Friday-night comedy lineup with &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, &quot;Room 222&quot;, &quot;Love, American Style&quot; and &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. More recently, &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; enjoyed a six-season run on ABC with the last five seasons airing on Friday nights. The show remained on Friday nights in 2018 after switching networks to Fox.

&quot;Law and Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; developed a large and loyal audience on NBC on Friday nights when it was moved there from Mondays in the middle of the first season in January 2000. &quot;SVU&quot; remained on Fridays through the second, third and fourth seasons before moving to Tuesdays in season five in September 2003. Now airing on Thursdays, &quot;SVU&quot; entered its 26th season in September 2024. Following &quot;SVU&quot; on NBC, another wildly successful show, &quot;The Blacklist&quot;, took up the death slot for nearly 8 full seasons before being moved to a Wednesday 10/9c schedule in the middle of 2021.

More recently, the CBS fantasy series &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot; enjoyed a successful five-season run on Friday nights, as did the light crime thriller &quot;Numb3rs&quot;, which ran for six, and reboot &quot;MacGyver&quot;, which also ran for five. Later shows &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;, &quot;Magnum P.I.&quot;, &quot;Fire Country&quot; and &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; also fared well, though they admittedly appealed to older audiences who were more likely to stay home on Friday nights (CBS in and of itself typically targets a slightly older key demographic than its competitors). From 2014 to 2016, the long-running reality TV series &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; moved from Sunday to Friday nights. &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; moved out of its Friday schedule for the 29th season and now aired on Thursdays, .

The CW show &quot;Supernatural&quot; was moved to Friday for its sixth and seventh seasons, allegedly to test its true drawing power compared to the station&#x27;s glitzier drama shows. Many fans, knowing about the &#x27;death slot&#x27;, feared that this meant it was on its way to being cancelled, but it actually increased in viewership. This led to the network moving it back into mid-week scheduling, eventually back to its original WB slot, Tuesdays. In 2015, midseason, the show was moved to Wednesday evenings, where it had also aired. For a majority of the show&#x27;s run, the program was scheduled on Thursdays, Mondays being the only weekday it was not aired on, and it has maintained its audience in all time slots. The network&#x27;s own iterations of &quot;Whose Line Is it Anyway?&quot; and &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us&quot; have survived the Friday slot for multiple years.

Cable networks Disney Channel and Cartoon Network have long been successful with Friday nights with children&#x27;s program blocks. Cartoon Network&#x27;s original programming success on this night began in 1999 with the launch of &quot;Cartoon Cartoon Fridays&quot; (later known as simply &quot;Fridays&quot;), a two-hour block of original animated series during primetime that included series such as &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, &quot;Cow &amp; Chicken&quot;, &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot;, and &quot;Camp Lazlo&quot;. After the block was discontinued in 2007, Cartoon Network shifted its programming towards more action-oriented series such as &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; and &quot;Ben 10&quot; in the Friday primetime slot. Disney Channel did not begin airing original programming on Friday evenings until 2001; premieres of its made-for-cable films moved to that night from Saturdays that year. This was followed by its original series in 2007 (which had aired during the two hours preceding the designated &quot;death slot&quot; period); since then, Disney Channel has been successful with its original programming on that night (which have included popular series such as &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;, &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot;, &quot;Jessie&quot;, &quot;Girl Meets World&quot; and &quot;The Suite Life on Deck&quot; – the latter of which was the number one series among children between the ages of 6 and 12 years in 2008). Its original movies have also generally performed well on Friday nights; in particular, the August 17, 2007 premiere of &quot;High School Musical 2&quot; was the channel&#x27;s highest-rated made-for-cable film to date, and holds the Nielsen record for the highest-rated made-for-cable movie premiere and the highest-rated non-sports program in the history of basic cable, watched by 17.2 million viewers.

<text>A glaive, sometimes spelled as glave, is a type of pole weapon, with a single edged blade on the end, known for its distinctive design and versatile combat applications. There are many similar polearms such as the war scythe, the Japanese naginata, the Chinese guandao (yanyuedao), the Korean woldo, and the Russian sovnya.

A glaive typically consists of a single-edged blade approximately 45 centimeters long affixed to a pole measuring about 2 meters. The blade is secured in a socket-shaft configuration, akin to an axe head, as opposed to having a tang like a sword or naginata. Some variations of glaive blades were even forged with a small hook on the reverse side to better engage mounted opponents, earning them the name &quot;glaive-guisarmes.&quot;

In the 1599 treatise &quot;Paradoxes of Defence&quot; by English gentleman George Silver, the glaive is described as being used in a manner similar to other polearms like the quarterstaff, half pike, bill, halberd, voulge, and partisan. Silver considered this class of polearms superior to all other hand-to-hand combat weapons.

The Morgan Bible, also known as the Maciejowski Bible, features illustrations of two-handed glaives used on horseback, showcasing their historical application in mounted combat.

The contemporary term for this weapon may have been &quot;faussart,&quot; which referred to various single-edged weapons related to the scythe, alongside terms like falchion, falcata, or fauchard, all derived from the Latin term for &quot;scythe.&quot;

Historical records suggest that the glaive may have originated in Wales and remained a national weapon until the late 15th century. There is a mention of a warrant from the first year of Richard III&#x27;s reign, dated 1483, for the production of &quot;two hundred Welsh glaives,&quot; further highlighting its historical significance in weaponry.

== Design ==
The glaive typically consists of three main components:

* &quot;Blade&quot;: The blade of the glaive varies in size and shape, but it is generally a curved blade with a single cutting edge. This blade design allows for effective slashing and cutting movements.
* &quot;Shaft&quot;: The glaive&#x27;s shaft is typically made of wood or metal and ranges from 6 to 7 feet in length, making it a polearm suitable for thrusting and striking from a distance.
* &quot;Hilt&quot;: At the base of the shaft, the glaive often features a hilt or grip that allows the wielder to maintain a secure hold during combat.

== Usage ==
The glaive was a versatile weapon on the battlefield. It was effective for both cutting and thrusting, and its long reach allowed warriors to strike opponents from a relatively safe distance. Some common glaive techniques included sweeping strikes to disarm or incapacitate enemies and thrusting attacks to penetrate armor.

Glaives were used by infantry and could be particularly effective against mounted opponents, as they could target the horse or rider. These weapons were employed in various historical conflicts, from the medieval European battlefields to the Far East.

== Cultural significance ==
The glaive holds cultural significance not only for its martial applications but also for its representation in art, literature, and folklore. It is often depicted in medieval tapestries and illuminated manuscripts, showcasing its presence in European history.

The weapon has made appearances in numerous fantasy and historical fiction works, cementing its place in popular culture. It is frequently associated with knights and medieval warriors in contemporary portrayals of chivalry.

== Modern interpretations ==
In the modern era, the glaive continues to be popular among enthusiasts of historical reenactment, martial arts, and collectors of historical weaponry. It is often featured in stage combat and reenactment events. The glaive has also influenced the design of fictional weapons in various forms of media, including video games, movies, and television series.

==Other uses of the word==
The word &quot;glaive&quot; has historically been given to several very different types of weapons; it originated from French. Almost all etymologists derive it from either the Latin () or Celtic (, compare &quot;claymore&quot;) word for sword. Nevertheless, all the earliest attestations in both French and English refer to spears. It is attested in this meaning in English roughly from the 14th to 16th centuries. 

Around the same time, it also began being used as a poetic word for sword. In Modern French, refers to short swords, especially the Roman .

The term &quot;glaive&quot; is used in the science-fiction/fantasy film &quot;Krull&quot; to refer to a thrown weapon, similar to the &quot;shuriken, chakram&quot;, or &quot;mambele&quot;, which can return to the thrower, much like a boomerang. Glaive has been used to describe this fictional type of weapon in films, video games (such as &quot;Warframe&quot; and &quot;Dark Sector&quot;), and other fantasy media since.

<doc id="892111" wikidata="Q1411757" url="?curid=892111" title="Minolta Maxxum 7000">
<text>The Minolta MAXXUM 7000 (7000 AF in Europe and α-7000 in Japan) 35 mm SLR camera was introduced in February 1985. It was the first camera to feature both integrated autofocus (AF) and motorised film advance, the standard configuration for later amateur and professional single lens reflex cameras.

==Overview==
Although the Nikon F3AF (1983), Pentax ME F and Chinon CE-5 already had presented autofocus single lens reflex cameras, autofocusing could not be achieved without the use of special motorised AF lenses. The Pentax ME F had focus sensors in the camera body, while the Chinon CE-5 used a lens with built-in active infrared sensors. Nikon already had a camera with integrated motor drive on the market, the N2000 (F-301 in UK), but its autofocus counterpart, the N2020 (F-501 in UK), appeared after the Maxxum/Dynax.

The Minolta 7000 had its AF sensors and the focusing drive inside the camera body, and as a result the lenses could be much smaller and cheaper. The aperture and focus were mechanically driven through the lens mount from the camera body. However, electronically controlled buttons on the camera body now replaced the mechanical aperture ring on the lens, and the setting was electronically displayed on the body and in the viewfinder. The metal housing of older Minolta SLR cameras was replaced with a lighter, cheaper body made of plastics. In other respects, the Maxxum offered most of the standard features of other cameras of the day, with the exception of a rather low flash sync speed (1/125 sec.) and no multi-exposure capability.

Minolta introduced a new lens mount, the A system, breaking compatibility with its earlier manual-focus lenses in the MC and MD system. The A lens mount is still the same today, but some modifications have been made to the electronic contacts to facilitate new functions such as motor zoom (xi lenses, now discontinued) and a more sophisticated flash metering system (ADI).

Konica and Minolta merged their photo and camera businesses in October 2003. In January 2006 Konica Minolta announced that they were withdrawing from the camera and photo business, transferring their assets to Sony, who since have continued development of the A system through their Alpha series.

==Autofocus==

When Pentax and Nikon entered the autofocus segment, both used a similar passive array AF system as Minolta, but retained compatibility with their existing manual-focus K and F mounts respectively. Canon, like Minolta, chose to change its mount completely, introducing the EOS 600-series a few years later, breaking compatibility with the former FL and FD lens mounts. Canon&#x27;s EOS system was the only fully electronic lens mount system, with no mechanical connections between camera body and lens: the autofocus motors were housed in the lens itself, rather than the camera body.

==Legal troubles==

Early Maxxum 7000 cameras were inscribed &quot;MAXXUM 7000&quot; with a crossed &#x27;XX&#x27;. The oil giant Exxon considered this to be a violation of its trademark, because the XX in its logo was linked in a similar fashion. As a result, Minolta was allowed to distribute cameras that were already produced, but was forced to change the stylistic XX in Maxxum and implement this change in new production. All Maxxum cameras produced thereafter had a regularly scripted double &#x27;X&#x27;.

Minolta&#x27;s autofocus design was found to infringe the patents of Honeywell, a U.S. corporation. After protracted litigation, Minolta in 1991 was ordered to pay Honeywell damages, penalties, trial costs and other expenses in a final amount of $127.6 million.

<doc id="892114" wikidata="Q6468679" url="?curid=892114" title="Outside support during the Warsaw Uprising">
<text>The Warsaw Uprising, in 1944, ended in the capitulation of the city and its near total destruction by the German forces. According to many historians, a major cause of this was the almost complete lack of outside support and the late arrival of the support which did arrive. The only support operation which ran continuously for the duration of the Uprising were night supply drops by long-range planes of the Royal Air Force (RAF), other Commonwealth air forces, and especially units of the Polish Air Force (PAF), which had to use distant airfields in Italy (Brindisi and others) and so had very limited effect.

The Soviets made clear their view on the situation in Warsaw to United States Ambassador, W. Averell Harriman. On 15 August 1944, Harriman received a note from Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Vyshinsky. In this note, Vyshinsky was instructed by Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov to inform Harriman that the Soviet Government &quot;could not go along&quot; with US plans to airdrop arms to resistance groups in Warsaw and that the &quot;action in Warsaw into which the Warsaw populations had been drawn was a purely adventuristic affair and the Soviet Government could not lend its hand to it.&quot; Vyshinsky&#x27;s note concluded that Stalin had pointed out to Churchill on 5 August that one could not imagine how a few Polish detachments of the so-called National Army possessing neither tanks, artillery, or aviation could &quot;take&quot; Warsaw when the Nazis had four tank divisions at their disposal for the defense of the city.

A major reason that has also emerged was Stalin had sought to colonize Poland and forming a communist state that worked as a Soviet satellite, and a successful uprising by the Polish Home Army could threaten Stalin&#x27;s plan. Thus choosing to not support the uprising served Stalin&#x27;s hegemonic ambitions. If judging Stalin&#x27;s political intentions, there could be alternate logistic reasons why the Soviet forces could not provide aid to Warsaw. One alternate explanation which has been given for the lack of early support is that the uprising began too early and the nearby Soviet forces could not fight to the city to support the uprising. Before and at the time of uprising, the German army started a massive Panzer force counterattack near Warsaw.

Another possible explanation is that the Red Army was simply exhausted and hence unable to extend effective support to the Uprising. In support of this thesis, it is often claimed (mostly by Soviet sources) that since the opening of Operation Bagration many Red Army units had covered several hundred miles in a far-ranging offensive, and their advance elements were at the very end of their logistical tether. This, coupled with the presence of several Panzer divisions from the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; and the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; around Warsaw which administered a sharp reverse to the Soviet 2nd Tank Army in the final days of July, was, according to this view, sufficient to stop the Red Army in its tracks on the Warsaw front. However, the units which reached Warsaw in late July 1944 were not part of Bagration, but instead advanced from Western Ukraine as part of the Lublin-Brest Operation, covering a much smaller distance. Those units were in fact able to operate quite effectively against German forces to the south and north of Warsaw during August and September, successfully securing bridgeheads over the Vistula and Narew rivers in those sectors. Despite that Soviet success, they remained inactive during August and the first half of September on the most direct route of approach towards Warsaw, through the suburb of Praga. Furthermore, once the Soviet forces seized Praga in mid-September 1944, only poorly supported units of the inexperienced 1st Polish Army were assigned to attempt the crossing of the river Vistula to aid the insurgents. Those crossings failed to establish a durable foothold on the left bank of the river, and caused considerable casualties among the Polish units involved. It is an open question whether an earlier Soviet effort using more experienced units with adequate support would have been able to reach and cross the Vistula in the Warsaw sector, and provide timely and effective support to the Polish units fighting in the main part of the city. The continued difficulty in accessing Soviet and British documents of the time makes it difficult for historians to answer this question with any degree of certainty.

== The airdrops ==
 
From August 4 the Western Allies begun supporting the Warsaw Uprising with airdrops of munitions and other supplies. Initially the air raids were carried out mostly by 1586 Polish Flight of the PAF stationed in Bari and Brindisi in Italy flying Liberators, Halifaxes and Dakotas. Later on at the insistence of the Polish government-in-exile they were joined by the Liberators of 2 Wing - 31 and 34 Squadrons of the SAAF based at Foggia in Southern Italy, and Halifaxes, flown by 148 and 178 Squadrons of the RAF. The drops continued until September 21, delivering a total of 104 tons of supplies.

The Soviet Union did not give permission to the Allies for use of its airports for those supply operations and thus the planes were forced to use bases in the United Kingdom and Italy which reduced their carrying weight and number of sorties. The Allies specific request for the use of landing strips made on 20 August was denied by Stalin on 22 August. He referred to the resistance as &quot;a handful of criminals&quot;.

United States Army Air Forces planes did not join the operation. On August 6, the Polish Ambassador called on the Lt. General McNarney to present an urgent request from the president of Poland for supplies to be furnished to the Polish Underground Army fighting the Germans in Warsaw. The Polish request asked that either General Eisenhower be authorized to send in supplies by air or that German munitions captured from the enemy by Soviet forces be sent to Warsaw from the United States bases in the Soviet Union. The Ambassador&#x27;s memorandum also stated that arms and ammunition which Churchill had promised to parachute to Warsaw had not been sent because of technical difficulties. A response letter from the Joint Chiefs of Staff on August 7 stated that it &quot;believed the Polish Ambassador should be informed that his appeal has been given most sympathetic consideration by the United States military authorities and that the matter has been referred to the Combined Chiefs of Staff for such action as is possible under the circumstances.&quot; In the annexes to the letter from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, it stated that in accordance with the agreed policy of the Combined Chiefs of Staff that supplies and equipment for the Polish Underground Forces is a British responsibility, and that the Polish request should be referred to the British Chiefs of Staff for such action as they may deem necessary and desirable. After Stalin&#x27;s objections to support for the uprising, Churchill telegrammed Roosevelt on August 25 and proposed sending planes in defiance of Stalin and to &#x27;see what happens&#x27;. Roosevelt replied on August 26: &#x27;I do not consider it advantageous to the long-range general war prospect for me to join you in the proposed message to Uncle Joe&#x27;.

Although German air defence over the Warsaw area itself was almost non-existent, about 12% of the 296 planes taking part in the operations were lost because they had to fly 1,600 km out over heavily defended enemy territory and then back over the same route. Most of the drops were made during night, at no more than 100–300 feet altitude, and poor accuracy left many parachuted packages stranded behind German-controlled territory.

From September 13 on the Soviets began their own airdrop raids with supplies, and dropped about 55 tons in total. The drops continued until September 28. Finally on September 18 the Soviets allowed one USAAF flight of 110 B-17s of the 3 division Eighth Air Force to re-fuel and reload at Soviet airfields used in Operation Frantic, but it was too little too late. On their return flight to Foggia and then back to England the B-17&#x27;s bombed the rail yards in Budapest, Hungary, which was still in German-occupied territory.

== Soviet participation: Berling landings on Powiśle ==
The role of the Red Army during the Warsaw Uprising remains controversial and is still disputed by some historians. The Uprising started when the Red Army appeared on the city&#x27;s doorstep, and the Poles in Warsaw were counting on Soviet aid coming in a matter of days. This basic scenario of an uprising against the Germans launched a few days before the arrival of Allied forces played out successfully in a number of European capitals, notably Paris and Prague. However, despite standing for about 40 days less than 10 km from Warsaw&#x27;s city center, and then moving even closer, to the right bank of the Vistula river a few hundred meters away from the main battle of the uprising during its last two weeks, the Red Army did not extend effective aid to the desperate city. Some Western historians, as well as the official line of the Communist regime in Poland before 1989, claimed that the Red Army, exhausted by its long advance on its way to Warsaw, lacked sufficient fighting power to overcome the German forces around Warsaw and extend effective aid to the Uprising. However, the consensus among most historians is that Stalin did not want to aid the Home Army in Warsaw, made up of likely opponents of the Communist regime that he wanted to impose on Poland after the war, and other Allied powers were reluctant to intervene against Stalin&#x27;s will.

The Red Army reached the outskirts of Warsaw in the final days of July, 1944. The Soviet units belonged to the 1st Belorussian Front, participating in the Lublin-Brest Operation, between the Lvov-Sandomierz Operation on its left and Operation Bagration on its right. These two operations were colossal defeats for the German army and completely destroyed a large number of German formations. As a consequence, the Germans at this time were desperately trying to put together a new force to hold the line of the Vistula river, the last major river barrier between the Red Army and Germany proper, rushing in units in various stages of readiness from all over Europe. These units included a few high quality Panzer and SS Panzer divisions pulled from their refits, but also many infantry units of poor quality. In terms of combat power this scratch force was considerably inferior to what the Soviets had available. On the other hand, after their long advances in June and July the Soviet suffered from the usual difficulties with supply accompanying any long-range Soviet offensive that has advanced far beyond its starting line. The Soviet plan was to seize bridgeheads across the Vistula and the Narew rivers as jumping off points for the next offensive and then stop to resupply their units. This put Warsaw, straddling the river Vistula, right at the limit of planned Soviet advance. From the operational viewpoint seizing Warsaw was not a major priority for the Soviets, though clearly having possession of the city would be advantageous to them, especially if it could be captured with its infrastructure intact. However, it was not essential, as the Soviets already seized a series of convenient bridgeheads to the south of Warsaw, and were concentrating on defending them against vigorous German counterattacks. The Red Army was also gearing for a major thrust into the Balkans through Romania at around this time and a large proportion of Soviet resources was being sent in that direction.

In the initial Battle of Radzymin Soviet advance armored units of the 2nd Tank Army suffered a setback which prevented them from taking Warsaw from the march. It was the presence of Soviet tanks in nearby Wołomin that sealed the decision of the Home Army leaders in Warsaw to launch the uprising. As a result of the battle, the Soviet tank army was pushed out of Wołomin to the east of Warsaw and pushed back about 10 km. However, the defeat did not change the fact of the overwhelming Soviet superiority over the Germans in the sector. The Soviets retained their positions to the south-east of Warsaw along the Vistula river, barely 10 km away from the city center, at the outskirts of the Warsaw right bank suburb Praga. The Poles fighting in the Uprising were counting that the Soviet forces would seize Praga in a matter of days and then be in a position to have Red Army units cross to the left bank where the main battle of the Uprising was occurring and come to its aid.

However, on that line along the outskirts of Praga, on the most direct route of advance towards Warsaw, the Soviets stopped their advance and the front line did not move for the next 45 days. The sector was held by the understrength German 73rd Infantry Division, destroyed many times on the Eastern Front and recently reconstituted. The division, though weak, did not experience significant Soviet pressure during that period. At the same time, the Red Army was fighting intense battles to the south of Warsaw, to seize and maintain bridgeheads over the Vistula river, and to the north, to gain bridgeheads over the river Narew. It was on those sectors that the best Panzer and armored divisions that the Germans had were fighting. Despite that, both of these objectives have been mostly secured by early September. The inactivity of the Red Army directly in front of Warsaw elicited this reaction of amazement from Germans, recorded in the operations journal of German 9th Army on 16 August 1944: &quot;Contrary to our expectations, the enemy has halted all of their offensive actions alongside the entire front of the 9th Army.&quot;

Finally, on September 11, the Soviet 47th Army began its advance into Praga. The resistance by the German 73rd Division was weak and collapsed quickly, with the Soviets gaining control of the suburb by September 14. With the taking of Praga, the Soviet forces were now directly across the river from the Uprising fighting in left-bank Warsaw. If the Soviets had reached this stage in early August, the crossing of the river would have been easy, as the Poles then held considerable stretches of the riverfront. By mid-September a series of German attacks had reduced the Poles to holding one narrow stretch of the riverbank, in the district of Czerniakow. Nevertheless, the Soviets now made an attempt to aid the Uprising, but not by using Red Army units.

In the Praga area Polish units under command of General Zygmunt Berling (thus sometimes known as &#x27;berlingowcy&#x27; - &#x27;the Berling men&#x27;), the 1st Polish Army (&quot;1 Armia Wojska Polskiego&quot;) were in position. On the night of September 14/September 15 three patrols from landed on the shore of Czerniaków and Powiśle areas and made contacts with Home Army forces. Under heavy German fire only small elements of main units made it ashore (I and III battalions of 9th infantry regiment, 3rd Infantry Division). At the same time the commanders of the Red Army declined to support the Polish troops with artillery, tanks or bombers.

The Germans intensified their attacks on the Home Army positions near the river to prevent any further landings, which could seriously compromise their line of defence, but weren&#x27;t able to make any significant advances for several days, while Polish forces held those vital positions in preparation for new expected wave of Soviet landings. Polish units from the eastern shore attempted several more landings, and during the next few days sustained heavy losses (including destruction of all landing boats and most of other river crossing equipment). Other Soviet units limited their assistance to sporadic and insignificant artillery and air support.

Shortly after the Berling landings, the Soviets decide to postpone all plans for a river crossing in Warsaw &quot;for at least 4 months&quot; and soon afterwards general Berling was relieved of his command. On the night of September 19, after no further attempts from the other side of the river were made and the promised evacuation of wounded did not take place, Home Army soldiers and landed elements of Wojsko Polskie were forced to begin a retreat from their positions on the bank of the river.

Out of approximately 3,000 men who made it ashore only around 900 made it back to the eastern shores of Vistula, approximately 600 of them seriously wounded.

==Closed or destroyed military archives==

Research into the lack of support of the Warsaw Uprising is (according to historians such as Norman Davies) currently very difficult due to lack of access to archives. For records relating to the period, currently both the United Kingdom archives and Russian archives (where the majority of Soviet archives are kept) remain mostly closed to the public. Further complicating the matter is the United Kingdom&#x27;s claim that they accidentally destroyed the archives of the Polish Government in Exile.

<text>SS &quot;Ceramic&quot; was an ocean liner built in Belfast for White Star Line in 1912–13 and operated on the Liverpool – Australia route. &quot;Ceramic&quot; was the largest ship serving the route until P&amp;O introduced in 1923.

In 1934 Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion Line absorbed White Star&#x27;s Australia service and acquired &quot;Ceramic&quot;. The liner served as a troopship in both World Wars. In 1942 a U-boat sank her, leaving only one survivor from the 656 people aboard.

This was the first of two ships to be called &quot;Ceramic&quot;. The second was a Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion refrigerated cargo steamship that was built in England in 1948 and scrapped in 1972.

==Building==
Harland and Wolff built &quot;Ceramic&quot; as hull 432 on the Number One slipway of its Belfast yard, launching her on 11 December 1912 and completing her on 5 July 1913. Her total cost was £436,000.

&quot;Ceramic&quot;″s engines were what was called &quot;combination machinery&quot;. She had three propellers, with a pair of four-cylinder triple expansion engines driving her port and starboard props and exhaust steam from their low pressure cylinders powering a single low-pressure steam turbine that drove her middle screw. Harland and Wolff and White Star Line had successfully tested this arrangement in 1908 on and had since applied it to the three giant s. Between them &quot;Ceramic&quot;″s three engines were rated at and gave her a speed of .

&quot;Ceramic&quot;″s registered length was . Her beam was and her depth was . As built, she had three decks and her tonnages were and . Some of her holds were refrigerated. In later years her refrigerated cargo capacity was cited as in 1930 and in 1936.

White Star Line registered &quot;Ceramic&quot; at Liverpool. Her UK official number was 135474 and her code letters were JCNK. She carried wireless telegraphy equipment, operated by the Marconi Company on the standard 300 and 600 metre wavelengths. Her original call sign was MCP.

==White Star service==

&quot;Ceramic&quot;″s maiden voyage began on 24 July 1913 when she left Liverpool for Australia. At the time she was the largest liner on the route between the two countries. In 1914 she was requisitioned for the First Australian Imperial Force as the troopship HMAT (His Majesty&#x27;s Australian Transport) &quot;Ceramic&quot;, with the pennant number A40.

She was armed with two stern-mounted QF 4.7 inch (120mm) naval guns. Her navigation equipment included wireless direction finding by 1930 and echo sounding by 1933.

In 1916 &quot;Ceramic&quot; took the Territorial Army 25th (County of London) Cyclist Battalion to India, leaving Devonport on 3 February and reaching Bombay on 25 February.

&quot;Ceramic&quot; survived a number of attacks. In May 1916 she was in the Mediterranean carrying 2,500 troops when two torpedoes from an unidentified attacker missed her. On 9 June 1917 she was in the English Channel when again a torpedo from an unidentified attacker missed her. On 21 July in the North Atlantic off the Canary Islands a surfaced U-boat chased her for 40 minutes. &quot;Ceramic&quot; fired on the U-boat with her 4.7 inch stern guns and outran her attacker.

In May 1917 &quot;Ceramic&quot; was transferred from Australian control to the UK Shipping Controller under the Liner Requisition Scheme. In 1919 she was returned to White Star Line and in 1920 Harland and Wolff refitted her as a civilian liner. The refit slightly increased her tonnage to . She resumed civilian service on 18 November 1920 when she left Liverpool for Glasgow and Sydney.

&quot;Ceramic&quot; ran aground on the River Clyde at Glasgow on 12 January 1925. She later was refloated and dry docked.

On 18 December 1930, &quot;Ceramic&quot; collided with the Pacific Steam Navigation Company&#x27;s cargo motor ship &quot;Laguna&quot; in the River Thames near Gravesend. Both ships were slightly damaged.

==Shaw, Savill and Albion peacetime service==
In 1934 White Star merged with Cunard. &quot;Ceramic&quot; was sold to Shaw, Savill and Albion but kept the same route and name. She started her first voyage for her new owner on 25 August, when she left Liverpool for Brisbane. From 1930 her three-letter wireless call sign was superseded by the four-letter call sign GLST.

In June 1936 Harland and Wolff&#x27;s yard in Govan, Glasgow began a refit to modernise &quot;Ceramic&quot;. Her forward bridge deck was glassed in, a verandah café was added aft. The refit changed her tonnages to and . Despite being 23 years old, she remained a popular ship on the route between the UK and Australia.

As refitted, she had 36 corrugated furnaces with a combined grate area of . The furnaces heated six double-ended boilers with a combined heating surface of . The boilers supplied steam at 215 lbf/in2 to &quot;Ceramic&quot;″s two triple-expansion engines. Her three engines were now rated at 1,692 NHP. &quot;Ceramic&quot; resumed service on 15 August 1936.

==Second World War service==
When the Second World War broke out on 1 September 1939 &quot;Ceramic&quot; was at Tenerife on her regular route to South Africa and Australia. She continued as scheduled, unescorted, reaching Australia in October. She left Sydney on 1 November and returned unescorted until she reached Freetown, Sierra Leone, where she joined Convoy SL 13F, becoming the convoy vice-commodore&#x27;s ship. SL 13F left port on 19 December and reached Liverpool on 3 January 1940.

In February 1940 &quot;Ceramic&quot; was commissioned as a troop ship. She kept her usual route, leaving Liverpool unescorted on 19 February and reaching Sydney on 14 April. She left Sydney for home on 20 April, and after her regular calls in Australia and South Africa she put into Freetown on 2 June. If she was seeking a home-bound convoy she found none, for she sailed the next day unescorted and reached Liverpool on 13 June.

===Collision with &quot;Testbank&quot;===
On 20 July 1940 &quot;Ceramic&quot; left Liverpool with Convoy OB 186. This dispersed at sea two days later as scheduled.

In the South Atlantic in the small hours of 11 August 1940 the Bank Line cargo ship sighted &quot;Ceramic&quot; about a mile and a half ahead. Under wartime navigation regulations both ships were sailing without navigation lights. &quot;Ceramic&quot;″s lookout failed to see &quot;Testbank&quot; until the two ships were about from each other. Both ships took avoiding action but were too late to avoid a collision.

About 0200 hrs &quot;Testbank&quot; rammed &quot;Ceramic&quot;″s starboard bow. The combined speed of the collision was about . It shortened the cargo ship&#x27;s bow by about and opened a hole about wide in the liner&#x27;s Number One Hold, but both ships stayed afloat. &quot;Testbank&quot;″s cargo was 9,000 tons of iron ore, which would have sunk her very quickly if she had shipped enough water. In the event she was able to return to Cape Town under her own power.

As a precaution, &quot;Ceramic&quot;″s 279 passengers were taken off and transferred by boats to the P&amp;O liner . &quot;Ceramic&quot; reached Walvis Bay in South West Africa with the aid of a tug and escorted by a Royal Navy warship. She arrived on 16 August and stayed for emergency repairs until 24 September. She reached Cape Town on 27 September and stayed there for almost £50,000 worth of further repairs. On 10 December &quot;Ceramic&quot; resumed her passage to Australia, reaching Sydney on 18 January 1941. Apart from a visit to Newcastle, New South Wales &quot;Ceramic&quot; stayed in Sydney until 21 March, when she left for home. She made her usual calls in South Africa at the end of April and reached Liverpool on 28 May.

===Further war service===
On 28 or 29 June 1941 &quot;Ceramic&quot; left Liverpool with Convoy WS 9B, which reached Freetown on 13 July. She continued unescorted &quot;via&quot; South Africa as usual, reaching Sydney on 4 September, where she stayed until 1 October. She then visited Newcastle and Brisbane before leaving Sydney for home on 12 October. Instead of returning by her usual route &quot;Ceramic&quot; turned east across the Tasman Sea, called at Wellington, New Zealand 19–27 October and then crossed the Pacific. In November she passed through the Panama Canal and reached Halifax, Nova Scotia. There she joined Convoy HX 163, which left on 3 December and reached Liverpool on 19 December.

In January 1942 &quot;Ceramic&quot; left Liverpool with Convoy ON 59 until it dispersed as scheduled in the North Atlantic. Because of the threat of enemy attack her Atlantic route from Liverpool to Cape Town was extended westwards. She steamed west unescorted across the North Atlantic to Halifax, arriving on 7 February. On 15 February she left Halifax and under naval escort to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, arriving on 5 March. She continued unescorted &quot;via&quot; South Africa to Australia, reaching Sydney on 29 April.

Again she continued east to return home, this time calling at Lyttelton, New Zealand on 2 June before crossing the Pacific and the passing through Panama Canal. In Cristóbal, Colón she joined Convoy Convoy CW 2/1, which left on 3 July and reached Key West on 12 July, where most of its ships including &quot;Ceramic&quot; joined Convoy KN 119. This left Key West the same day and reached Hampton Roads, Virginia on 17 July. &quot;Ceramic&quot; continued unescorted, calling at New York 24–27 July and continuing to Halifax where she joined Convoy HX 201. This left on 2 August and reached Liverpool on 14 August. On this voyage &quot;Ceramic&quot; carried 372 passengers to Liverpool.

===Loss===

On 3 November 1942 &quot;Ceramic&quot; left Liverpool for Australia &quot;via&quot; Saint Helena and South Africa. She was carrying 377 passengers, 264 crew, 14 DEMS gunners and 12,362 tons of cargo. 244 of the passengers were military or naval, including at least 145 British Army, 30 Royal Navy, 14 Royal Australian Navy and 12 Royal Marines. 30 of her British Army passengers were QAIMNS nursing sisters. The other 133 passengers were fare-paying civilians. 12 were children, the youngest being a one-year-old baby girl. Six were doctors, five of whom were South African. One passenger was Rudolph Dolmetsch (190642), classical musician and composer, then serving as Regimental Bandmaster with the Royal Artillery.

&quot;Ceramic&quot; sailed with Convoy ON 149 until it dispersed as scheduled in the North Atlantic. She then continued unescorted as planned. As on her previous departure in January, she first headed west because of the threat of enemy attack.

At midnight on 6–7 December, in cold weather and rough seas in the mid-Atlantic, hit &quot;Ceramic&quot; with a single torpedo. These were followed two or three minutes later by two more that hit &quot;Ceramic&quot;″s engine room, stopping her engines and her electric lighting. The liner radioed a distress signal, which was received by the . The crippled liner stayed afloat and her complement abandoned ship in good order, launching about eight lifeboats all full of survivors.
About three hours later &quot;U-515&quot; fired two more torpedoes, which broke the ship&#x27;s back and sank her immediately. By now it was very stormy and raining. The heavy sea capsized some of the lifeboats and left many people struggling in the water. Those boats that were not capsized stayed afloat only by constant bailing.

Next morning the &quot;BdU&quot; ordered &quot;U-515&quot; to return to the position of the sinking to find out the ship&#x27;s destination. About noon the U-boat commander, &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Werner Henke, decided to rescue the &quot;Ceramic&quot;&#x27;s skipper. In heavy seas, he sighted one of the lifeboats and its occupants waved to him. The storm was now almost Force 10 and almost swamping &quot;U-515&quot;″s conning tower, so Henke ordered his crew to make do with the first survivor they could find. This turned out to be Sapper Eric Munday of the Royal Engineers, whom they rescued from the water and took prisoner aboard the submarine.

No other occupants of the lifeboats survived. The storm was too severe for neutral rescue ships from São Miguel Island in the Azores to put to sea. On 9 December the Portuguese was sent to search for survivors, but found none.

Munday was kept prisoner aboard &quot;U-515&quot; for a month, including Christmas and New Year, until she completed her patrol. When she returned to Lorient, Brittany on 6 January 1943 he was landed at Lorient U-boat base and sent to Stalag VIII-B in Upper Silesia, where he remained a prisoner of war until 1945.

<text>Haran or Aran ( &quot;Hārān&quot;) is a man in the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible. He was a son of Terah, brother of Abraham, and father of son Lot and daughters Milcah and Iscah. He died in Ur of the Chaldees. Through Lot, Haran was the ancestor of the Moabites and Ammonites.

==Haran and his family==
Terah, a descendant of Shem son of Noah, was the father of Abram/Abraham, Nahor, and Haran. Their home&#x27;s location is not certain, but it is usually supposed to have been in Mesopotamia. Besides Lot and Milcah, Haran fathered a daughter Iscah.

After Haran died in Ur of the Chaldees &#x27;before his father Terah&#x27;, his family travelled towards Canaan, the Promised Land. However, Terah stopped at Charan (or Haran [Hebrew חָרָן, Ḥārān]) and settled there, as did Nahor and Milcah, whereas Lot accompanied Abraham and others onwards to Canaan.

=== Death ===
According to legends from Book of Jubilees, Terah owned his father&#x27;s and grandfather&#x27;s sculpture workshop, where he made idols and sold them successfully. This greatly irritated the pious Abraham. In one version, Abraham simply smashes the statues in his father&#x27;s workshop, whereas in another, Abraham sets fire to the temple where his father&#x27;s idols were shown, and Haran died in the fire while trying to save them.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Haran&quot; possibly comes from the Hebrew word &quot;har&quot;, = &quot;mountain&quot;, with a West Semitic suffix appearing with proper names, &quot;anu/i/a&quot;. Thus, it has been suggested that &quot;Haran&quot; may mean &quot;mountaineer&quot;. Personal names which resemble &quot;Haran&quot; include &quot;ha-ri&quot; and &quot;ha-ru&quot;, from texts of second millennium BC Mari and Alalakh, and &quot;ha-ar-ri&quot;, from one of the Amarna letters—but their meanings are uncertain. The initial element of &quot;Haran&quot; can be found in the Phoenician personal name &quot;hr-b`l&quot;, and also in the Israelite personal name &quot;hryhw&quot; from Gibeon.

==Others called Haran==
Haran is the English name of two other people mentioned in the Bible.
* Haran, son of Caleb ( – &quot;Ḥārān&quot;) (). 
* Haran, son of Shimei ( – &quot;Hārān&quot;). He was a Levite who lived in the time of David and Solomon ().

<text>Metrolink&#x27;s Riverside Line is a commuter rail line running from in Downtown Los Angeles to Riverside along the Union Pacific Railroad. It runs weekday peak commuter hours only, with very little midday and reverse commute service. In 2024, the average weekday ridership was 1,269 passengers.

==History==
The Riverside Line, the fourth line to be introduced, was added to the Metrolink system in June 1993. This line featured Saturday service from June 2000 until January 2002, when it was cancelled due to low ridership. As of November 2021, the line has seven trains daily on weekdays only with reverse commute service temporarily eliminated in 2019, but revived with only one train per day as of 2021.

The Riverside Line can be used to get to Ontario International Airport; the East Ontario station has an airport shuttle served by Omnitrans Bus route 81 as of 2019, including discounted Lyft fares from the station.

As Metrolink trains along the Riverside Line share tracks with Union Pacific freight trains, delays of up to 90 minutes are not uncommon. In April 2005, morning westbound trains arrived on schedule 90% of the time, while those headed east during the evening arrived on schedule only 72% of the time.

===Present decline===

Ridership for the Riverside Line has gradually declined following the opening of the 91/Perris Valley Line in 2002. Much of the decline in service has been a direct result of competition with the 91/Perris Valley Line or San Bernardino Line, or track right-of-way disputes with Union Pacific. Planning of the line&#x27;s route has also come into question later in its lifetime, as the line was not redirected to the north half of the Monte Vista Subdivision to possibly construct a station to directly serve Ontario International Airport, which was heavily renovated in 1998. As a result, many riders believe Metrolink has not made the line as much of a priority for frequent usage, which has shown in the decline of trains per day in recent schedule updates. As of 2025, the Riverside Line operates five trains on weekdays only. 

==Stations==
==Demographics==
In 2011, the average weekday ridership was 5,161 passengers, with 46 percent male and 54 percent female. Eighty-nine percent of riders used the line for work commutes. The median household income for riders was .

Ridership by ethnicity was evenly split:
* 27% Hispanic
* 27% Caucasian
* 21% Asian/Pacific Islander
* 19% African American
* 5% other

<doc id="892122" wikidata="Q102079702" url="?curid=892122" title="Říp">
<text>Říp (; ) is a high solitary hill in the Lower Ohře Table in the Czech Republic. It is located southeast of Litoměřice. According to national legend, it is the place where the first Czechs settled. The mountain and the rotunda on its top are protected as a national cultural monument.

Říp, being visible from great distance, has always been an important orientation point in the Bohemian scenery and has attracted attention since the oldest times.

==Geomorphology==
In terms of geomorphological division, Říp is located in a flatland of the Lower Ohře Table within the Central Bohemian Table macroregion, and is the highest peak of this entire macroregion.

==Geology==

Geologically, Říp is the erosional remnant of a late Oligocene volcano and is composed of basalt nephelites containing olivine granules, amphibole, leucite and – among others – magnetite, so a local magnetic anomaly can even be observed there by the compass.

==Nature==
The hill was bare until 1879 when Mořic Lobkowicz had it planted with trees. Today, almost all of the mountain is covered by an oak-and-hornbeam forest with some maple, pine ash, and linden trees. Some rare thermophile plants can be found at the few tree-less places on the top of the hill, such as &quot;Gagea bohemica&quot; and &quot;Iris pumila&quot;.

==Name==
The name of the mountain is of pre-Slavic origin and probably comes from the Old-Germanic stem &quot;ríp-&quot; (elevation, hill), which has the Latin parallel in the word &quot;rípa&quot; (shore, slope, hillside). Some linguists also derive the origin of the name from the Illyrian-Thracian base.

==Legend==

According to a traditional legend, first recorded by the ancient Czech chronicler Cosmas of Prague in the early 12th century, Říp was the place where the first Slavs, led by Forefather Čech, settled. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Dalimil&quot; from 1310, when Čech and his people climbed Říp, he looked upon the landscape and told his brothers that they have reached the promised land: &quot;We have a country at our will, here will be our tables always full, enough of wild animals, birds, fish, bees and hardness against enemies.&quot;

The land was named after the leader. In the 16th century, the legend was revived by Václav Hájek of Libočany who claimed that Čech was buried in the nearby village of Ctiněves and, later on, by Alois Jirásek in his &quot;Old Bohemian Legends&quot; from 1894.

==Buildings==
On top of the hill there is a Romanesque rotunda of Saint George, which is one of the oldest buildings in the Czech Republic. This is mentioned for the first time in 1126, when Soběslav I, Duke of Bohemia, commemorating his victory at the Battle of Chlumec, where he defeated Holy Roman Emperor Lothair III, had the rotunda repaired and extended by the western circular tower. The rotunda&#x27;s current appearance is the result of a purist reconstruction during the 1870s.

Inside the rotunda is a stone sculpture by contemporary Czech artist Stanislav Hanzík &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot; from 1979, symbolising the arrival of Czech ancestors to the country and the beginning of Czech history there.

Near the rotunda is a tourist hut that was built in 1907 and still serves travellers today. In accordance with the patriotic spirit of that era, a wooden plate is mounted on the hut wall that says: (&#x27;what Mecca is to a Muslim, Říp is to a Czech&#x27;).

The top of Říp became a popular pilgrimage place and a frequent site of national manifestations and mass meetings. A famous manifestation was held there on 10 May 1868 when the foundation stone was taken from the hill for the newly built National Theatre in Prague. Tradition has it that each Czech should climb this mountain at least once in his life.

<text>The Queensland men&#x27;s cricket team or the Queensland Bulls is the Brisbane-based Queensland representative cricket side in Australia&#x27;s domestic cricket tournaments:

*Sheffield Shield: four-day matches with first-class status, since the 1926/27 season
*Marsh One-Day Cup: a one-day (fifty over per side) tournament with List-A status, since its inception in 1969/70
*KFC Twenty20 Big Bash: a twenty overs per side tournament from 2005/06 to 2010/11.

==History==
===1824 to 1926/27===
The first European settlement in Queensland was a penal colony established at Redcliffe in 1824, which moved to Brisbane the following year. Free settlers first arrived in 1842.

The earliest evidence of cricket being played in Queensland is in 1857, two years prior to separation from New South Wales and statehood. A match between Brisbane and Ipswich was held in 1859 while in 1860 a Toowoomba team played Dalby. By 1862 there were also teams in Warwick, Maryborough, Gayndah, Gympie, Rockhampton and the Lockyer Valley.

Queensland&#x27;s first inter-colonial (i.e. representative) match was in 1864 when their XXII was beaten by a New South Wales XI. In 1875, Queensland recorded their first victory when their XVIII beat the NSW XI. That victory was a catalyst for the formation of the Queensland Cricket Association in 1876. Queensland was finally granted first-class status in 1892/93, winning its inaugural first-class match against NSW in that season by 14 runs.
Queensland rarely played more than two inter-colonial matches per season from 1892 to 1893, with generally one match (and often both) against New South Wales. The tyranny of distance and non-professional status of the players severely limited opportunities for more first-class competition during this period.

The Sheffield Shield competition commenced in 1892/93 but Queensland&#x27;s initial applications for admission were refused. Despite their minimal first-class exposure, Queensland still produced four Australian Test players prior to their Sheffield Shield debut, though none played more than six Tests. The first was the colourful Arthur Coningham who played his only Test in 1895. Remarkably, he took a wicket with his very first delivery (it was also the first ball of the Test). He also scored Queensland&#x27;s initial first-class century, 151 against NSW.

1910/11 was a very successful season as Queensland recorded three first-class wins for the first time, beating NSW home and away and Victoria in Melbourne in their only three games of the summer.

===1926/27 to 1963/64===
Queensland was finally admitted to the Sheffield Shield in 1926/27 and had a successful debut year, defeating NSW in their first-ever Shield match and also eventual winners South Australia in their only meeting. Like most new teams, the side struggled to maintain that level of performance and finished last in the (then) four-team competition 15 times in its first 19 seasons. However, the decision to include Queensland quickly paid off with the emergence of regular Test players such as Bill Brown, Don Tallon, Percy Hornibrook and Ron Oxenham. Brisbane hosted its first Test match in 1928/29 when Australia met England at the Exhibition Ground.

By the early 1950s, Queensland had a very competitive side and was regularly finishing in the top three of the (now) five-team Shield following Western Australia&#x27;s admission in 1946/47. In 1956/57, they finished an agonising one point behind winners NSW. More Australian players were produced, including Ron Archer, Wally Grout, Ken &#x27;Slasher&#x27; Mackay and Peter Burge. Another highlight of this period was the dramatic Tied Test between Australia and the West Indies at the Gabba in 1960/61.

===1964/65 to 1972/73===
This period was undoubtedly Queensland&#x27;s worst era, finishing last eight times in nine Shield seasons. Rock bottom was reached in 1967–68 when the side failed to win a single game. The QCA decided to recruit high-profile interstate players to revive the team&#x27;s fortunes. Greg Chappell was vice-captain of South Australia under brother Ian and was lured north for the 1973/74 season with the promise of the Queensland captaincy. Emerging pace bowler Jeff Thomson followed the next year.

===1973/74 to 1993/94===
The addition of Chappell and Thomson to a side containing players such as Sam Trimble, Martin Kent, Tony Dell and Geoff Dymock had an immediate impact. Queensland gained four seconds and a third over the next five seasons, as well as winning the domestic one day cup in 1975/76, Queensland&#x27;s first piece of silverware.

The Queensland teams of the 1980s were even stronger, featuring many outstanding cricketers, both &quot;home-grown&quot; like Craig McDermott, Carl Rackemann and Ian Healy and others attracted from interstate or overseas such as Vivian Richards, Allan Border, Kepler Wessels and Ian Botham. Queensland were runners up five times in seven seasons in the 1980s (including a heartbreaking one wicket loss to NSW in 1984/85), and won the one-day trophy three more times in this period, but their first Shield win still proved elusive.

===1994/95 to date===
The 68-year wait finally came to an end in the 1994/95 season when Stuart Law led Queensland to their inaugural Sheffield Shield win after finishing last the previous year.

Since their breakthrough win, Queensland has enjoyed a golden era, winning the competition a further eight times (including three consecutive seasons from 1999/2000 to 2001/02) and also finishing as runners-up seven times. Since Tasmania were admitted in 1977/78, the Bulls have finished in sixth (i.e. last) place just twice.

==Colours and mascot==

The primary club colour of Queensland Bulls is Maroon which represents the state colour of Queensland. The secondary club colour is Gold, with additional contrasting colour of white.

The &quot;Bulls&quot; mascot and nickname were adopted at the commencement of the 1993/94 season.

==Home grounds==
The side plays most of its home games at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, generally referred to as &quot;the Gabba&quot;, a contraction of the suburb name of Woolloongabba in which it is located. Matches are occasionally played at Allan Border Field in Albion, Brisbane and Cazaly&#x27;s Stadium in Cairns. 28 first-class games and two Tests were played at the Exhibition Ground between 1893 and 1931.

<text>Cambridge Aerodrome , also known as Cambridge Airport, is a minor airport located in Cambridge, a suburb of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. It is located only a few kilometres from the primary airport, Hobart Airport.

Cambridge has been the primary site of aeronautics in Hobart from its opening in the 1920s. In July 1934, the federal government compulsorily acquired of land from a local farmer to establish an aerodrome on the current site. It served as Hobart&#x27;s main airport until the International Airport opened in 1956. Today, it is the base of Par Avion, which specialises in day trips and scenic flights around Hobart and the South West Wilderness of Tasmania; the Aeroclub of Southern Tasmania; and Heli Resources, a helicopter company that focuses on aerial work and flights in Antarctica.

In 1992 it was sold by the Federal Airports Corporation to Par Avion. In June 2024, the aerodrome was put up for sale.

==Accidents and incidents==

On 10 March 1946, a Douglas DC-3 aircraft operated by Australian National Airways departed from Cambridge Aerodrome with a crew of four and 21 passengers for Essendon Airport. Less than 2 minutes after take-off, the aircraft crashed at Seven-Mile Beach, killing all on board. At the time, it was Australia&#x27;s worst civil aviation accident.

<doc id="892133" wikidata="Q269036" url="?curid=892133" title="Nissan 350Z">
<text>The Nissan 350Z (known as Nissan Fairlady Z (Z33) in Japan) is a two-door, two-seater sports car that was manufactured by Nissan Motor Corporation from 2002 until 2009 and marks the fifth generation of Nissan&#x27;s Z-car line. The 350Z entered production in 2002 and was sold and marketed as a 2003 model from August 2002. The first year there was only a coupe, as the roadster did not debut until the following year. Initially, the coupe came in Base, Enthusiast, Performance, Touring and Track versions, while the Roadster was limited to Enthusiast and Touring trim levels. The Track trim came with lightweight wheels and Brembo brakes, but its suspension tuning was the same as all other coupes. The Nissan 350Z was succeeded by the 370Z for the 2009 model year, although the roadster was sold alongside the 370Z for 2009.

==Background==
After the Nissan 300ZX was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 1996, Nissan initially tried to keep the Z name alive by re-creating the 240Z the following year. The car was conceived by Nissan&#x27;s North American design team in their free time, and the concept was introduced in a four state Road Show in July 1998 to various car media, dealers, and employees. Yutaka Katayama, regarded as the &quot;Father of the Z&quot; unveiled the Z concept sketch to the public when he received a motor industry award. The design, representing a modern vision of the 240Z, did not please the original 240Z designer Yoshihiko Matsuo, who compared it to the Bluebird and Leopard.

The 240Z concept was produced for the Detroit Motor Show during the following August and September. Nissan was unhappy with the first design as they felt the original 2.4 L KA24DE engine that was going to be assigned made the car feel underpowered. They also felt the car was considered too &quot;retro&quot; or too &quot;backward&quot; resembling a futuristic 240Z; hence, a redesign was commissioned. During a press conference in February 2000, president Carlos Ghosn announced plans to produce the car as he felt the new model would help to assist the company&#x27;s recovery.

The Z Concept was unveiled in Detroit Motor Show two years later, which was similar in body shape but with a new front end. The car then underwent a minor redesign and was eventually assigned the 3.5 L VQ35DE engine, hence becoming known as the &quot;350Z&quot;.

==Concept models==
===240Z concept (1999)===

Nissan unveiled the 240Z concept car at the 1999 North American International Auto Show, then later at the Los Angeles Auto Expo. The concept was based primarily on a design sketch by Manny Baker of Nissan&#x27;s California design studio. In a reference to the original, it was a bright orange two-seater with swept-back styling. It was a fully functional car with its 2.4 L 4-cylinder KA24DE engine from the Nissan Altima producing and of torque, and not the Z-car&#x27;s traditional 6-cylinder engine. It was thought a less than worthy successor to the line. The designers used an original 240Z to provide inspiration and the concept was created in only 12 weeks. Automotive critics described &quot;it would be cool but get a new model.&quot; This design served the intended purpose of creating interest, in the public and the corporation, for a new Z car.

==Design and layout==
The 350Z is a front mid engine, rear-wheel-drive, two-door, two-seat sports car primarily designed by Ajay Panchal, part of a design team led by Diane Allen of Nissan Design America in San Diego, California in 2000. This program was inspired by the successful reception to the 1998 240Z concept model.

The vehicle has the long-hood short-deck design common to the Z-Car family. External design highlights include: sloping fastback style arched roof line, unique brushed aluminum door handles, high waistline, and bulging fenders that are pushed out to the corners of the vehicle.

The Interior design has brushed aluminum accents. The main gauge pod is mounted directly to the steering column allowing its movement to coincide with steering wheel adjustments. Additional gauges are mounted in a center triple gauge cluster (similar to the 240Z/260Z/280Z). Touring models are equipped with the Bose sound system, a six CD changer and a 8-inch Bose subwoofer mounted behind the driver&#x27;s seat. The 350Z&#x27;s interior does not have a conventional glove box, but has storage compartments located behind and between the two seats.

==Models==

Released in July 2002 in Japan at reorganized Nissan Japanese dealerships called &quot;Nissan Blue Stage&quot;, and August 20, 2002 in the U.S., the 350Z coupé was available in 5 trim packages: &#x27;350Z&#x27; (Base), &#x27;Enthusiast&#x27;, &#x27;Performance&#x27;, &#x27;Touring&#x27;, and &#x27;Track&#x27; editions. In Europe, only the &#x27;Track&#x27; trim was available, although it was badged and marketed as &#x27;350Z&#x27;. The Base model did not include a VLSD or Traction Control and was only available with cloth seats. It did not include cruise control, nor power or heated seats. The Enthusiast model came with traction control, a VLSD, and cruise control. The Performance model came with larger 18-inch wheels, front air dam, rear spoiler, optional Brembo brakes, and VDC instead of Traction Control. Touring was made more of the luxury model. It had power, leather, heated seats, VDC, a VLSD, xenon headlamps, optional Brembo brakes, 18-inch wheels, and optional GPS Navigation. The Track model included Brembo brakes, front air dam, rear spoiler, traction control, cloth seats, 18-inch wheels, VLSD, and optional GPS Navigation.

In 2004 Nissan introduced the 350Z Roadster with an electrically retractable soft-top roof. In the U.S. market the car was available in two trim packages (Enthusiast and Touring), while in Europe, the same versions as the coupé were offered. Nissan added the Grand Touring (GT) trim to the Roadster trim packages for 2005.

In 2005 Nissan launched the 35th Anniversary edition, with a revised exterior and interior (see &quot;Special Editions&quot; below). Early 2005 model-year 35th anniversary edition models were equipped with the original VQ35DE engine with 287HP/274TQ and an automatic transmission. In January 2005, Nissan introduced the 35th Anniversary 6-speed manual models and Track models (mid-year introduction), which included the updated VQ35DE 300HP/260TQ &#x27;Rev-up&#x27; engine and new updated CD009 manual transmission as well as minor changes to suspension tuning and parts.

For the 2006 model year, the 350Z received changes for its mid-cycle facelift. The VQ35DE 300HP/260TQ &#x27;Rev-up&#x27; engine that was introduced mid-year 2005 on the Track and 35th Anniversary Edition with 6-speed manual transmission models was offered for every trim level that had a manual transmission option. The VQ35DE rated at and of torque continued to be offered with only the 5-speed automatic transmission. Additions included bi-xenon projectors, a revised front fascia, new LED rear lights, changes to the interior trim and speed sensitive steering. Trim levels above the basic enthusiast package received a brake system upgrade including a larger brake booster, front dual piston calipers and larger diameter brake disks. Touring and Grand Touring models had radio-steering controls standard, MP3 CD compatibility, and Satellite Radio became an available option.

For the 2007 model year, the 350Z was again moderately revised. The VQ35DE V6 was replaced with a new VQ35HR V6. It produced at 6800 rpm with of torque at 4800 rpm using the revised SAE certified power benchmark. The VQ35HR had a raised redline to 7500 rpm and more torque across the rpm range. The hood was redesigned with a bulge reminiscent of the original 240Z to accommodate the raised deck height of the new VQ35HR. In the U.S., trim levels were narrowed down to 350Z (base), Enthusiast, Touring, Grand Touring and NISMO, while in Europe the same trim levels remained. Bluetooth was added for the 2007 model year.

==Special editions==

===Fairlady Z Type E (2004)===
A total of 5 units, called the Type E, were produced in Japan for homologation requirements to compete in the Super GT series. It has a longer nose and rear overhang, as well as several add-ons for aerodynamic purposes. The Type-E engine is rated at at 6,200 rpm and of torque at 4,800 rpm.

===350Z GT-S concept===
During the 2006 Goodwood Festival of Speed, Nissan Technical Centre Europe (NTCE) unveiled the 350Z GT-S Concept. The GT-S had a unique radial flow supercharger that could be turned on or off via a switch on the dashboard, raising the VQ35DE engine output to and without modifications to the engine components. The car also had new body kit for more cooling and downforce and wider 245 and 265/40/18 tires. The car was tested by automotive journalists, but none were marketed.

===2008 Tokyo Auto Salon concepts (2008)===
The Nissan Fairlady Z Type F, Xanavi Nismo Z (Super GT 2007 GT500 Class), Endless Advan Z (series winner of Japan&#x27;s Super Taikyu 2007 endurance series) and Fairlady Z Version Nismo Type 380RS were all unveiled at the 2008 Tokyo Auto Salon.

The vehicles went on sale on January 10, 2008.

==Nismo editions==
Nissan&#x27;s performance tuning division, Nismo, began producing modified versions of the 350Z shortly after its introduction.

===Nismo R-Tune (2004)===
The R-Tune was a kit sold directly to customers with modifications including new headers, cams, pulleys. The R-Tune voids the Nissan factory warranty, but gains significant horsepower, intended for track racers.

===Nismo S-Tune GT (2005)===

The S-Tune GT was released by Nismo to celebrate its success in the Super GT series. The S-Tune GT had revised long nose bodywork as in the Type-E, a modified version of the VQ35DE engine called the S1 which featured more power (316 PS / 232 kW / 311 hp) and a higher redline (7,200 rpm), as well as a sportier Nismo suspension.

===Nismo 350Z (2007–2008)===

The Nismo edition of the Nissan 350Z Coupé debuted at the New York International Auto Show on April 4, 2007. This version had the same engine as the regular 350Z (VQ35HR), but was only available with a 6-speed manual transmission and a viscous-type limited-slip differential (VLSD), Traction Control System (TCS) and a Nismo aerodynamics package based on the Super GT championship car, which included an aggressive front fascia with chin spoiler, side skirts, an extended rear fascia with an underbody diffuser and a rear wing. The vehicle also featured Nismo-tuned independent multi-link suspension developed by Yamaha, Brembo brakes with four-piston front and two-piston rear calipers (with front and rear rotors) and Nismo-branded gunmetal grey RAYS forged alloy wheels and a Nismo-branded tuned exhaust. Yamaha also included front and rear dampeners to help with stability of the chassis.

The conversion process for the Nismo 350Z began with a limited number of chassis being pulled from the assembly line to be sent to Nissan-tuner Autech to have structural seams hand-welded for greater body rigidity. This process made the Nismo 350Z a more capable track car than the other trim levels available at the time.

The Nismo 350Z went on sale in the USA in July 2007 at Nissan dealers. 1607 were produced for the 2007 and 2008 model years, and it was assumed that if there was a greater demand, more would be produced, limited to 10% of all 350Z sales. The Nismo model 350Z had a manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price of $38,070 for the 2007 model year.

===Nismo Type 380RS (2007)===
Released as the road version for Japanese market of the Type 380RS-Competition race car, the Type 380RS includes a detuned version of the 380RS-C race engine, rated at 257 kW (350 PS/348 hp) at 7,200 rpm and 397 N·m (40.5 kgf·m/293 lbf·ft) of torque at 4,800 rpm. Brembo disc brakes are fitted, front and rear dampers from Yamaha and forged RAYS alloy wheels.

Nismo Type 380RS is priced 5.397 million (5.14 million+tax) yen ($38,695 USD). Only 300 units were produced from 2007 through 2008.

===Nismo Type 380RS-Competition===
The Nismo Type 380RS-Competition is the race car on which Nismo Type 380RS is based. The 3,798 cc engine (VQ38HR) is rated at 294 kW (400 PS) at 7,500 rpm and 421 N m (43 kgf m) of torque at 5,200 rpm. This in turn is based on the GT 500 race car that Nissan enters into the Super GT championship.

According to Nissan, the race car cost 26.25 million yen.

===Police version===
A Nismo version of the Fairlady Z was also used by the Tochigi Prefecture police force.

==Motorsport==

===Grand Am===
Since its introduction in 2002, it did not take long for drivers and teams to enter a 350Z for competition when B.J. Zacharias and Michiel Schuitemaker of Schuitemaker Motorsports helped the car to make its début in the Grand-Am Cup Series at the start of the 2003 season. They have taken a few podium finishes with Unitech Racing who is also the other team to field a Z33, but effort was proved to be successful under the name of &quot;Geddings Racing&quot; scoring wins along with the other current Grand-Am entrant East Competition Promotorsport. The Grand-Am Cup car has also been used in the new FIA GT4 European Cup. Schuitemaker Motorsports with drivers Michiel Schuitemaker and BJ Zacharias won 3rd place in the &#x27;03 Grand-Am Cup season. The following year, they improved and finished in 2nd place. After winning 3rd overall in the &#x27;03 season, Nissan had Wright Tuning build a new 350Z race car for the &#x27;04 season. This car differed from the &#x27;03 car in that it was completely stripped and seam welded. The cage was lighter and stiffer by using different diameter tubing where possible. The car used a Menard&#x27;s built engine with a Pectel engine management system. Overall racing weight was which was the minimum allowable weight for its class. The &#x27;04 chassis proved to be the most successful chassis to run in Grand-Am to date. The &#x27;03 chassis was sold to a French team with Edouardo Atkatlan as the driver. It still competes in the European &quot;Fun Races&quot; today, winning 2nd place in the inaugural &#x27;07 race in Madrid, Spain.

===JGTC/Super GT===
The 350Z replaced the Skyline GT-R as the car for Nissan&#x27;s factory and customer teams in the Super GT&#x27;s GT 500 class. The cars used are heavily modified and had a longer nose and tail (requiring the production of the Type-E homologation special), carbon fiber bodywork, and a tube chassis. In 2004, Nismo won the GT500 championship. Until the 2007 season, the car was powered by a VQ30DETT V6, then a new 4.5L V8 powerplant was developed. The 350Z, with slightly more pedestrian modifications also competed in the GT300 class, having started there even before the Skyline GT-Rs were replaced, by teams such as Endless Sports and Mola. In 2003 Hasemi Sports won the GT300 championship with the 350Z. In the 2008 season, the 350Zs were all replaced by Nissan GT-Rs in the GT500 class, but they continued to be used in the GT300 class as the GT-Rs exceed the class&#x27;s horsepower limits. Two 350Zs competed in the series and MOLA won both the Drivers&#x27; and Teams&#x27; championships in the GT300 class.

===Super Taikyu===
The Z33 also appears in Japan&#x27;s Super Taikyu series, entered by C-West Labs.

===British GT Championship===
The British GT Championship also fielded a privateer 350Z which competed in the series until 2006.

===SCCA===
The 350Z is a popular choice for amateurs and professionals competing in SCCA events. T.C Kline achieved third place in the 2003 Touring 2 category in one of three Z33s that qualified to the SCCA T-2 runoffs that year. In the SCCA GT2 class, Jim Goughary took the title in the car&#x27;s debut season.

The car has also seen success in SCCA solo events. In 2006, Carter Thompson&#x27;s 350Z lost the SCCA National Championship by 0.1 second over two days of competition. The 350Z has achieved a high level of success at the National Solo Championships since 2006. Although production of the 350Z was discontinued in 2009, the car continues to compete in local and national SCCA events. As recently as 2015, 350Z solo drivers Jeff Stuart and Bryan Heitkotter were rated as the top two SCCA drivers competing in national autocross.

===NASA===
In 2012, NASA (National Auto Sport Association), created a class of racing specifically for the 350Z. The &quot;Spec Z&quot; class includes all trim levels of the popular 2003-2008 Nissan 350Z in a single class focused on close competition, parity and cost containment that will showcase driving ability and car setup skills. The road racing series is backed by Nissan Motorsports and BFG Tires. The 2012 class rules were in their infant stage, but solidified by mid-2012.

===Drifting===

The 350Z is a popular platform for import events and drifting, where in the latter, drivers including Ryuji Miki, Youichi Imamura, Tyler McQuarrie and Tanner Foust have used them with success in the D1 Grand Prix and Formula D series. During the 2006 D1 Grand Prix exhibition event at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, Tanner Foust, driving a 350Z, became the first competitor to achieve a perfect score of 100. Two Z33s competed in the non-Japanese domestic D1 Grand Prix spin-off series, D1 Great Britain. In the 2007 season, both SVA Imports and Sumo Power competed using 350Zs in the European Drift Championship. In Formula D, Foust was awarded the runner-up spot in Round 1. In Round 2, Chris Forsberg scored a maiden victory in his 350Z Roadster equipped with a VK56DE from a Nissan Titan. Forsberg&#x27;s win for the 350Z was followed-up by Youichi Imamura&#x27;s win during the Las Vegas round of the US D1 Grand Prix series in his RB26DETT-engined car. Foust would eventually take his 350Z to the Formula D title.

===Open road racing===
&quot;Option&quot; magazine founder Daijiro Inada used an extensively modified 350Z, dubbed &quot;Option Stream Z&quot;, to compete in the Silver State Classic Challenge. The car was equipped with a GReddy/Trust T88 turbo-charger and was stroked to 3.8 L to produce over . The &quot;Option Stream Z&quot; appeared in the games &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot;, and &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; (PSP).

=== Speed trials ===

In 2004, the tuner Dandy and magazine &quot;Option&quot; entered a Z33 known as the &quot;Option Dandy 380Z&quot; with a donor engine from a salvaged Stream Z with a deleted turbo, producing , to compete in the F/GT class for naturally aspirated grand touring sport cars at the Bonneville Speed Week. The car reached a speed of , measured over a fixed distance.

==Advertising and promotions==
To promote the 350Z, Nissan released a short film, &quot;The Run&quot;, with a 2003 model being driven in a high-speed run through city streets of up to . This took place through the narrow cobblestone streets of Prague in the Czech Republic, and lasted six and a half minutes.

The 350Z has been extremely popular with diecast manufacturers, with companies such as Hot Wheels releasing various colors and styles of the car over the years.

The 350Z benefitted in popularity by making an appearance in &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot;, where it was fitted with a Veilside bodykit, amongst other modifications, and was driven by the fictional character &quot;Drift King&quot; Takashi.

==Reception==
The 350Z has been given extensive coverage in the automotive press, and has obtained generally positive reviews. Eddie Alterman, senior editor of &quot;Automobile&quot; magazine, said of the 350Z &quot;An outstanding performance value. They got all the important stuff right.&quot; While David Swigg of &quot;Motor Trend&quot; said &quot;With a competent driver at the wheel and the traction control switched off, many Boxster drivers would be hard-pressed to post better lap times than with this Z.&quot; &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine later awarded the Nissan Designers with the 2004 &quot;Top Gear&quot; Magazine Car of the year award.

Automotive journalists tend to praise the 350Z&#x27;s value, performance, handling, and braking. Criticisms tend to be directed towards the grade of interior plastics, greater curb weight than its competitors, cabin ergonomics and engine refinement. Other reviews have criticised reflections off the back strut in the rear window.

The 350Z has been recognized including the following:

===Safety===
The 350Z came with front air bags in standard and supplemental side air bags and curtain air bags as an option. With 143 deaths per million registrations, the two-door 350Z has been one of the least safe 2005–2008 model cars in the United States.

<doc id="892138" wikidata="Q1713469" url="?curid=892138" title="Jungle Hunt">
<text>is a side-scrolling action game developed by Taito for arcades. It was originally distributed in 1982 as then quickly modified and re-released as &quot;Jungle Hunt&quot; following a copyright dispute over the player character&#x27;s likeness to Tarzan. Taito also distributed a less successful rebranding of the game as Pirate Pete in 1982. &quot;Jungle King&quot;, along with &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; released a month earlier, is one of the first video games which has parallax scrolling.

The player controls an unnamed character moving through right-to-left scrolling scenes to rescue a woman from cannibals by swinging from vine to vine, swimming through a crocodile-infested river, avoiding rolling boulders, and jumping over her captors.

Home versions of &quot;Jungle Hunt&quot; were published by Atari, Inc. for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, and Atari 8-bit computers starring a British explorer named Sir Dudley. Ports under the Atarisoft label were released for Apple II, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, VIC-20, and IBM PC compatibles.

==Gameplay==
The game is split into four sections which scroll right to left.

In the first, the explorer is swinging from vine to vine by pressing the button when two vines are close enough together. Missing a vine causes the explorer to fall to the jungle floor, losing a life.

After the last vine, the explorer dives in a crocodile-infested river. The explorer can attack the crocodiles from below with his knife, unless their mouths are open. The explorer must periodically return to the surface to breathe, where he cannot attack the crocodiles. Bubbles occasionally rise from the bottom of the river, that can trap the explorer and carry him to the surface, potentially hitting crocodiles on the way.

After jumping out the river, the explorer runs up a hill while dodging various-sized boulders. The boulders bounce at varying speeds and heights, requiring the explorer to either jump or duck at the appropriate moment.

In the final scene, the explorer must evade cannibals while attempting to get to a woman being lowered into a cauldron. After the player rescues the woman, the word &quot;Congratulations!&quot; appears, which is then followed by a message saying &quot;I Love You!!!&quot; ending with the woman kissing the explorer.

Further gameplay repeats the scenes with increased difficulty. On rounds other than the first, a cannibal appears in the tree of the cauldron scene and throws spears at the player.

==Release==
The release of &quot;Jungle King&quot; with its Tarzan-like hero prompted legal action from the estate of Edgar Rice Burroughs. This resulted in the name being changed to &quot;Jungle Hunt&quot; with several cosmetic modifications:

#The main character is an explorer wearing a pith helmet and safari outfit. 
#The swinging vines have slightly different visuals to pass them off as ropes.
#The Tarzan yell at the start of the game is replaced by the music from the end of the river scene.

==Ports==
Atari, Inc. published home ports in 1983 under their own brand for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, and Atari 8-bit computers. Ports for other platforms were released under the Atarisoft label: Apple II, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, VIC-20, IBM PC compatibles, and TI-99/4A. In the Atari branded versions, the hero is named Sir Dudley, and the girl, married to Sir Dudley, is Lady Penelope.

The Apple II and IBM PC versions were developed by Sierra On-Line.

==Reception==
In the United States, &quot;Jungle King&quot; was the top-grossing upright arcade cabinet on the monthly &quot;RePlay&quot; charts by October 1982. &quot;Jungle Hunt&quot; had also topped the &quot;RePlay&quot; charts by January 1983. By July 1983, it had sold an estimated 18,000 arcade cabinets in the United States, and it was one of the six top-grossing games during that period. &quot;Jungle King&quot; went on to be one of the thirteen highest-grossing arcade games of 1983.

Bill Kunkel reviewed &quot;Jungle King&quot; for &quot;Electronic Games&quot; magazine in early 1983, writing that it could become Taito&#x27;s &quot;biggest hit since &quot;Space Invaders&quot;&quot; as it follows &quot;the classic formula for successful videogames: easy to learn, difficult to master.&quot; He said it was &quot;an undeniable kick the first few plays, but doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up for extended periods of time&quot; and called the graphics of the vine-swinging segment &quot;downright hideous&quot;, but noted &quot;gamers seem to be enjoying it.&quot;

Raymond Dimetrosky of &quot;Video Games Player&quot; rated the Atari VCS version a B+, calling it &quot;quite good&quot; considering the limitations of the VCS. William Michael Brown reviewed the Atari 5200 port in the September 1983 issue of &quot;Electronic Fun with Computers &amp; Games&quot;, rating it a 3 out of 4. He called it a significant improvement over the &quot;disappointing&quot; Atari VCS version, saying it looks and plays better and brings &quot;much of the coin-op challenge.&quot;

&quot;Jungle Hunt&quot; received a Certificate of Merit in the category of &quot;Best Adventure Videogame&quot; at the 5th annual Arkie Awards in January 1984.

==Legacy==
In November 1982, Taito released another version of the game in arcades as &quot;Pirate Pete&quot; with the same gameplay. The player character is now a pirate; the vines are replaced by ropes swinging from the masts of a very long ship; sharks swim in the water instead of crocodiles; and sword-wielding pirates take the place of cannibals.

In 1983, Milton Bradley published a board game version of &quot;Jungle Hunt&quot; where ropes are a key element.

&quot;Jungle Hunt&quot; is included in the &quot;Taito Legends&quot; collection for Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox.

<text>Jhansi ( ) is a historic city in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. (Toshan) Balwant Nagar was the old name of Jhansi. It lies in the region of Bundelkhand, on the banks of the Pahuj River, in the extreme south of Uttar Pradesh. Jhansi is the administrative headquarters of Jhansi district and Jhansi division. Also called the &quot;Gateway to Bundelkhand&quot;, Jhansi is situated near and around the rivers Pahuj and Betwa at an average elevation of . It is about from national capital New Delhi, 101 kilometres (62 mi) from Gwalior and from state capital Lucknow.

Jhansi is well connected to all other major towns in Uttar Pradesh by road and railway networks. The National Highways Development Project has supported development of the city. Jhansi is also being developed as the defense corridor by the NDA government which will boost the economy of the city and the region at the same time. The Srinagar to Kanyakumari north–south corridor passes closely to Jhansi, as does the east–west corridor; consequently there has been a sudden rush of infrastructure and real estate development in the city. Jhansi was adjudged the third cleanest city of Uttar Pradesh and the fastest moving city in the North Zone in Swachh Survekshan 2018 rankings. The development of a greenfield airport has been planned in the city. On 28 August 2011, Jhansi was selected among 98 cities for smart city initiative by the Government of India.

==Name==
According to Paul Whalley, the name &quot;Jhānsī&quot; means &quot;covered in bushes or undergrowth&quot;, from a variant of standard Hindi &quot;jhāṛ&quot; (&quot;bushes, undergrowth&quot;; ultimately from Sanskrit &quot;jhāṭa&quot;). The ending &quot;-sī&quot; represents a reduced form of the Sanskrit genitive suffix &quot;-sya&quot;.

A fanciful old folk etymology for the name &quot;Jhānsī&quot; derives the name from Hindi &quot;jhāīṁ sī&quot;, meaning &quot;like a shadow&quot; (or, in context, &quot;rather indistinct&quot;). This was supposedly said by the raja of Jaitpur, when asked by his host Bir Singh Deo if he could see the fort at Jhansi from the rooftop of his palace in Orchha. (The Jaitpur raj was only founded well after Bir Singh&#x27;s death, and the entire story is probably entirely spurious.)

==History==
===Early history: Orchha and Mughal rule===
Before the construction of Jhansi Fort on the Bangra hill in 1613, the site is said to have been covered by forest. The land then belonged to the nearby village of Lahargird, which itself belonged to the raja of Orchha&#x27;s territory. Two Ahir pastoralists supposedly set up some huts at the foot of the hill to watch over their herds around 1553. The Orchha raja Bir Singh Deo later had the fort built in 1613, and a village grew up around it. The village was apparently called Balwantnagar at first; when Jhansi became the name is unknown.

After the death of Jhujhar Singh, Bir Singh&#x27;s son and successor in Orchha, Jhansi came under Mughal control. Mughal troops and governors appear to have been posted here uninterrupted until the early 1700s.

===Maratha rule===
In 1722, Chhatrasal overran the Jhansi region as part of his new kingdom of Bundelkhand. However, in 1728, Muhammad Khan Bangash, the Nawab of Farrukhabad, drove him out and the area came back under Mughal control. Chhatrasal appealed for help to Baji Rao I, the Peshwa of the Maratha Empire, and their combined forces drove out the Mughal army. In return, Chhatrasal granted Jhansi (among other places) to Baji Rao in his will when he died in 1731. In 1735, Raja Indargir Gosain, Maratha governor of Jhansi fort, rebelled and ultimately established a small principality based at Moth to the northeast. In 1742, the Peshwa put Naru Shankar in charge of Jhansi along with miscellaneous other places.

Naru Shankar&#x27;s tenure as governor was pivotal in Jhansi&#x27;s history. Up until now, Jhansi had been a fairly small village below the fort, but during this period it grew to become a large town. Naru Shankar undertook construction projects in the town, including a major expansion of the fort. He also populated Jhansi with deportees from other towns, primarily Orchha. (The rajas of Orchha moved their capital to Tikamgarh around this time, and the town of Orchha itself rapidly declined.)

Naru Shankar was replaced as governor by Madho (or Madhaji) Gobind Antia in 1757. Antia constructed a reservoir known as the Antia Tal outside the city walls, on the Gwalior road. Another governor, Babu Rao Kanahi, served after Antia but before 1761, when Ganesh Shambhaji is described as &quot;the Maratha officer in charge of Jhansi&quot;. In November 1761, Shuja-ud-Daula, the Nawab of Awadh, had begun a military campaign in Bundelkhand, and Ganesh Shambhaji decided to switch sides and join him. After what Ashirbadi Lal Srivastava describes as an &quot;indiscriminate plunder of Jhansi&quot; (he doesn&#x27;t specify what this means), Ganesh Shambhaji jailed 52 of his Maratha colleagues and agreed to surrender Jhansi to Shuja-ud-Daula in return for a position in the Mughal service. After a detachment of Shuja-ud-Daula&#x27;s captured the fortress of Moth, the Maratha governor of Jhansi (who Srivastava doesn&#x27;t name) fearfully offered to submit and pay a 300,000-rupee tribute in return for being allowed to keep possession of the fort. Shuja-ud-Daula declined the offer and besieged the city. Its defenders surrendered on 1 February 1762. Shuja-ud-Daula appointed Muhammad Bashir as &quot;faujdar&quot; of the fort, and gave Ganesh Shambhaji the tax farm revenue for the district.

The Mughal rule of Jhansi only lasted for four years before Malhar Rao Holkar recaptured it for the Marathas. Naru Shankar was apparently re-appointed governor; after his death, he was succeeded by Vishwas Rao Lachman for five years.

===Newalkar dynasty===

The next governor was Raghunath Rao Newalkar. In late 1773, Shuja-ud-Daula sent another force south of the Yamuna, this time led by one Mir Naim, but they were defeated in a battle at Jhansi. Another Mughal-aligned force, led by Mirashgir, came to besiege Jhansi in late 1774, but the death of Shuja-ud-Daula in January 1775 resulted in the siege being abandoned. Raghunath Rao remained governor until his death in 1794; he had become practically independent by his death. He was succeeded by his brother Sheo Rao Hari, also called Sheo Rao Bhao. Sheo Rao was responsible for the construction of the city walls, which took place between 1796 and 1814. The Lachhmi Talao reservoir on the east side of town is sometimes attributed to Sheo Rao as well, although it has also been attributed to Anupgir Gosain of Moth instead.

Sheo Rao&#x27;s descendants continued to rule what became known as Jhansi State until 1853. Sheo Rao himself signed the first treaty with the British in 1804, which established a military alliance between the two but still recognised Jhansi as a Maratha vassal. As part of the Treaty of Pune in 1817, overlordship was transferred from the Marathas to the British themselves.

The final ruler of Jhansi State was Gangadhar Rao, who ruled from 1842 to 1853. Gangadhar Rao was a patron of the arts and a capable administrator. His only son died in infancy, so before he died, he and his wife Lakshmi Bai adopted a five-year-old boy named Damodar Rao to serve as his successor. Although this was accepted practice in Hindu law, the British did not recognise Damodar Rao as a valid heir and, invoking the Doctrine of Lapse, declared that Jhansi State had escheated to the British government. Lakshmi Bai appealed to the British court of directors, but to no avail, and in March 1854 the British took control of Jhansi.

The newly-appointed British superintendent of Jhansi, Francis Gordon, wrote a report in 1854 documenting the state of the town at that time. He estimated that it had a population of 40,000 people. It was not an industrial centre of any kind, but he wrote that its commercial traffic was &quot;enormous&quot;; he estimated that 3 million rupees&#x27; worth of goods passed through Jhansi per year. Large amounts of grain, coming from farmland to the south and southwest, passed through Jhansi on its way north. Cotton was brought from the west and then transported north to Kalpi. Salt also came from the west. In exchange, the merchants from the south and west bought sugar and various &quot;kirana&quot; goods to sell back home.

From 1853 to 1861, a cantonment was built on the southeast side of town.

===Rebellion of 1857===

Several factors had contributed to tensions in Jhansi before the rebellion broke out. Besides the British annexation of Jhansi State, various other members of the landed aristocracy were upset by the British encroaching on their traditional authority. Local residents were also upset by the fact that the British had permitted cow slaughter after they took over Jhansi (it had previously been banned). Another grievance was that the British had suspended endowments to the temple of Mahalakshmi (the patron goddess of the Newalkar dynasty) which had previously come from revenue collected from certain villages.

At this point the garrison was composed entirely of Indian troops, and it consisted of five infantry companies, a cavalry force, and an artillery detachment, all commanded by British officers.

Tensions boiled over on 5 June. That afternoon, one company of the Jhansi infantry along with the artillery detachment surrounded and entered the star fort and magazine, under the pretext of an attack by dacoits. They announced their intention to garrison the star fort themselves. Most of the British civilians took shelter in the regular fort. The remaining four infantry companies along with the cavalry had not joined in at this point, and that they night slept in the barracks without incident. The next day, however, most of them rose up and attacked and killed the British officers on site. They made their way to the main fort, which the rebels encircled and besieged. This was short-lived and on the 7th the British surrendered. They were marched south to the Jokhan Bagh, just outside the city walls, and executed.

====Lakshmi Bai&#x27;s reign====
On the 9th, there was a dispute between Lakshmi Bai and Sada Sheo Rao, a relative of her late husband, over who would rule in Jhansi, with both of them &quot;bidding against each other&quot; to win the support of the rebels. Lakshmi Bai offered much more and the rebels handed control of Jhansi to her. A proclamation was made saying &quot;The people are God&#x27;s, the country is the Padishah&#x27;s, and the raj is Rani Lakshmi Bai&#x27;s&quot;. Sada Sheo Rao assembled a force of 300 supporters, seized the fort of Karahra on 13 June, and attempted to proclaim himself ruler of Jhansi, but Lakshmi Bai sent troops after him and ultimately had him imprisoned and detained.

Her position now secure, Lakshmi Bai set up an administration in Jhansi. She set up a mint, raised an army, and strengthened the forts at Jhansi and Karahra. Attempting to stay on good terms with the British, she sent a letter to a British agent named Major Erskine saying that she had only aided the rebels under duress, disavowing the massacre of British prisoners, and presenting herself as just a caretaker until the British could reoccupy the area. Erskine responded by giving her full authorisation to rule on behalf of the British until their troops arrived and sent a proclamation that all were to obey her; he assured her that she would be treated well.

The main members of Lakshmi Bai&#x27;s administration were her father, Moropant Tambe; Lalu, the paymaster; Lachman Rao, the diwan; and Kashi Nath, the tahsildar.

Meanwhile, the raja of Orchha, hoping to recover ancestral territories that had been conquered by the Marathas in the 1700s, invaded Jhansi. He presented himself to the British as a loyal ally of theirs fighting to suppress the rebellious rani of Jhansi. His troops looted the countryside and besieged Jhansi on 3 September. He lifted the siege on 22 October as reinforcements under the raja of Banpur came to assist the defenders. In early 1858, Lakshmi Bai finally drove the Orchha troops out of her territory, and had consolidated her control over all the territory that had belonged to Jhansi State before the British annexation.

As late as February 1858, Lakshmi Bai pledged loyalty to the British and sent them multiple letters promising to hand over Jhansi without a fight if they treated her honourably. However, governor-general Charles Canning had never wanted to follow through with Erskine&#x27;s earlier proposition, and he considered the rani a rebel against British authority. On 11 February, Canning sent a letter to the British agent at Indore with instructions to try Lakshmi Bai before a special commission if captured. Lakhsmi Bai decided that she couldn&#x27;t trust the British and her only option was to fight them. On 14 February, she issued a proclamation urging both Hindus and Muslims to take up arms against the British because &quot;they would surely destroy the people&#x27;s religion&quot;. At her disposal were 12,000 troops, including 400 cavalry and about 40 artillery pieces. She also made negotiations with rebel leaders including Tantya Tope.

====Siege and capture by the British====
Commanders under Lakshmi Bai had all the vegetation outside the fort burned so that advancing British troops could forage absolutely nothing for supplies. However, the rajas of Orchha and Gwalior provided plenty of supplies for the British and their horses, so it ended up being moot. British forces under Hugh Rose arrived at Jhansi on 21 March and began a siege the next day after some initial scouting. On the morning of 1 April, some 22,000 troops under Tantya Tope came to relieve the defenders of Jhansi. They engaged the British at Basoba, some ways away from Jhansi. Tantya Tope&#x27;s forces successfully used a pincer formation to attack both flanks of British infantry, but a British cavalry counterattack used the same formation to envelop &quot;them&quot;, and Tantya&#x27;s forces were routed.

On the morning of 3 April, the British stormed the city through a breach in the city wall. For the next two days, brutal hand-to-hand fighting took place in the streets as the British tried to advance toward the fort. During the night of 4-5 April, Lakshmi Bai escaped along with her bodyguards and followers and headed toward Kalpi. The British occupied the fort the following day. Rose&#x27;s troops looted Jhansi, grabbing jewellery and other valuables and tearing down many of the houses and temples. The Sanskrit manuscript collection belonging to the royal family of Jhansi was destroyed. Rose, however, wrote to the governor-general that his troops had occupied the city peacefully and &quot;behaved in an exemplary manner&quot;.

===British Raj===
After the rebellion was suppressed, the British rebuilt the cantonment of Jhansi south of the city walls. At first it was centrally located in the new district, but it went through repeated territorial flip-flopping which left the town at the extreme west of the district, effectively cut off from most of its associated territory. A treaty in 1861 transferred the town and fort of Jhansi, the parganas of Pachor and Karahra, and parts of parganas Jhansi and Bhander to Gwalior State. Jhansi was re-transferred to British rule in 1885 in exchange for the return of Gwalior, which the British had occupied after the uprising, as well as a payment of 15 lakh rupees. 58 villages were also transferred with Jhansi at the same time, making up the bulk of the Jhansi tehsil.

The railway came to Jhansi in 1889, when construction of the Indian Midland Railway was completed. Jhansi was both the headquarters of this railway as well as an important junction with lines heading to Kanpur and Agra. The railway quickly drew the bulk of the commercial traffic passing through the region, and Jhansi &quot;sprang into sudden importance&quot; as a commercial centre, surpassing Mau-Ranipur as the district&#x27;s main trade centre.

In 1899, the Hardiganj market was opened on the site of a former royal garden. It grew to become the largest market in both the city and the district, supplying all the other markets with their own goods.

In 1886, the Indian National Congress came to Jhansi, and in 1888 Sripavati Ghosh was elected to serve as Jhansi&#x27;s delegate in the Congress at Allahabad. The Congress&#x27;s provincial conference was held in Jhansi in 1916, on the fort grounds and chaired by C. Y. Chintamani.

From 1926, the revolutionary Chandra Shekhar Azad was based in Jhansi, variously posing as a chauffeur and a mechanic.

===Independent India===
After the independence of India, Jhansi was included in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

==Geography and climate==
Jhansi is located at 25.4333 N 78.5833 E. It has an average elevation of 284 metres (935 feet). Jhansi lies on the plateau of central India, an area dominated by rocky relief and minerals underneath the soil. The city has a natural slope in the north as it is on the south western border of the vast &quot;Tarai&quot; plains of Uttar Pradesh and the elevation rises on the south. The land is suitable for species of citrus fruit and crops include wheat, pulses, peas, and oilseeds. The region relies heavily on monsoon the rains for irrigation purposes. Under an ambitious canal project (the Rajghat canal), the government is constructing a network of canals for irrigation in Jhansi and Lalitpur and some part of Madhya Pradesh. The trade in agricultural products (including grain and oilseeds) is of great economic importance. The city is also a centre of brassware manufacture.
===Climate===

Being on a rocky plateau, Jhansi experiences extreme temperatures. Winter begins in October with the retreat of the southwest monsoon (Jhansi does not experience any rainfall from the Northeast Monsoon) and peaks in mid-December. Temperatures are about minimum and maximum. Spring arrives by the end of February and is a short-lived phase of transition. Summer begins by April and summer temperatures can peak at in May. The rainy season starts by the third week of June (although this is variable year to year), while the monsoon rains gradually weaken in September and end before the last week of September. In the rainy season, the average daily high temperature hovers around with high humidity. The average rainfall for the city is about per year, occurring almost entirely within the three-and-a-half months of the Southwest Monsoon. In summer Jhansi experiences temperatures as high as degrees while in winter the temperatures can fall as low as as recorded in winter 2011.

Translation: &quot;From the bards of Bundela we have heard this story / She fought valiantly like a warrior woman, she was the queen of Jhansi.&quot;

For Marathi people there is an equally well-known ballad about the brave queen penned at the spot near Gwalior where she died in battle, by B. R. Tambe, who was a poet laureate of Maharashtra and of her clan. A couple of stanzas run like this:
Translation: &quot;You, denizen of this land, pause here and shed a tear or two / For this is where the flame of the valorous lady of Jhansi was extinguished / … / Astride a stalwart stallion / With a naked sword in hand / She burst open the British siege / And came to rest here, the brave lady of Jhansi!&quot;

==Jhansi in popular culture==

===Jhansi in literature===

Two novels by John Masters are set in the fictional town of Bhowani. According to the author, writing in the glossary to the earlier novel, &quot;Nightrunners of Bengal&quot;, Bhowani is an &quot;imaginary town. To get a geographical bearing on the story it should be imagined to be about where Jhansi really is - 25.27 N., 78.33 E.&quot; &quot;Nightrunners of Bengal&quot; is set during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 at &quot;Bhowani&quot; (the title alludes to the mysterious distribution of &quot;chapatis&quot; to village headmen which preceded the revolt). &quot;Bhowani Junction&quot; is set in 1946/47 the eve of independence. In each novel the main character is a British army officer named Colonel Rodney Savage, one of a succession of such men from the same family.

Christina Rossetti wrote a short poem about the fate of the Skene family at Jhansi during the Indian Mutiny. It is entitled &quot;In the Round Tower at Jhansi - 8 June 1857&quot;. It was published in 1862 in the same volume as her more celebrated poem &quot;Goblin Market&quot;. Some time afterward, Rossetti discovered that she had been misinformed about the husband and wife&#x27;s suicide pact in the face of a murderous and implacable enemy (&#x27;The swarming howling wretches below&#x27; the tower walls) which is the poem&#x27;s subject, but did not delete it from later editions. Jhansi is the centre of story in Vrindavan Lal Verma&#x27;s Hindi novel &#x27;Jhansi Ki Rani&#x27;. This novel tells the story of Jhansi ki Rani Lakshmibai, who fought bravely in 1858–59 to save Jhansi from the Britishers&#x27; attack.

<text>Yevno Fishelevich (Yevgeny Filippovich) Azef (; 1869–1918) was a Russian socialist revolutionary who also operated as a double agent and agent provocateur. He worked as both an organiser of assassinations for the Socialist Revolutionary Party and a police spy for the Okhrana, the Russian Empire&#x27;s secret police. He rose through the ranks to become the leader of the Socialist Revolutionary Party&#x27;s terrorist branch, the SR Combat Organization, from 1904 to 1908.

After the revolutionary Vladimir Burtsev unmasked his activity in 1909, Azef fled to Germany, where he died in 1918.

== Early life ==
Yevno Fishelevich Azef was born in Lyskava (now Brest Region, Belarus) in 1869, the second of seven children of a poor Jewish tailor. His father moved to Rostov with the family when Yevno was five and opened a drapery but barely made enough money to get his children through school. After leaving school around 1890, Azef worked as a journalist and a traveling salesman. In 1892, the police suspected him of distributing revolutionary literature. To avoid arrest, he embezzled 800 rubles and fled to Germany to first Karlsruhe and then Darmstadt. There, he studied to become an electrical engineer and joined a group of Russian social democrats.

== Double agent ==
In April 1893, Azef wrote to the Okhrana, the Russian secret police, offering to inform on his fellow students, for money. Later that year, he moved to Berne in Switzerland, and in 1894 joined the Union of Socialist Revolutionaries Abroad, which was organised by the respected narodnik couple Chaim Zhitlovsky and Vera Lokhova.

When he graduated, in 1899, the Okhrana ordered him to return to Russia, where he joined the Northern Union of Socialist Revolutionaries, led by Andrei Argunov, and became, in effect, his right-hand man, even though Azef wanted the revolutionaries to resume the use of terrorist tactics, while Argunov did not believe in violence. He valued Azef&#x27;s ability to resolve practical problems, such as setting up an underground printing operation, but was unaware that he was being assisted by the Okhrana. In November 1901, Argunov sent him to Europe to help unify the Northern, Southern and foreign Socialist Revolutionary unions into a single organisation. Argunov was arrested as soon as Azef had left Russia. In Switzerland in 1902, Azef became a founding member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, and served as deputy head of its combat organisation, headed by Grigory Gershuni, which was responsible for acts of terrorism.

Gershuni thought so highly of Azef that he nominated him as his successor, and so when Gershuni was arrested in spring 1903 after being betrayed by another double agent, Azef became head of the combat organisation, with Boris Savinkov as his deputy. Azef thus became both Russia&#x27;s leading terrorist and most highly paid police informant. In that position he organized the assassination of Vyacheslav Plehve in 1904. Plehve, as minister of the interior, was Azef&#x27;s nominal employer and the person who had ultimately authorised him to infiltrate the Socialist Revolutionary Party. Plehve had also made Gershuni&#x27;s arrest the police&#x27;s main priority, thus facilitating the rise of Azef. In 1905, Azef would organise the assassination of the Tsar&#x27;s uncle Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, who served as Governor-General of Moscow.

The success of those two assassinations gave Azef immense prestige within the Socialist Revolutionary Party. Because he was so trusted, he was able to deliver a long list of his rivals within the SR Party over to the Okhrana to be arrested. Their names included Anna Yakimova, a veteran of the plot to kill Tsar Alexander II who had served 24 years in prison, and Zinaida Kopolyannikova, who was hanged in August 1906 for assassinating the head of the Tsar&#x27;s lifeguards. In 1905 alone, according to researchers who accessed police records after the 1917 revolution, Azef informed against 17 of his subordinates within the SR Combat Organisation.

The assassinations of the Interior Minister and the Tsar&#x27;s uncle also set off a crisis within the Okhrana. The Director of Police, Alexei Lopukhin, resigned, and was replaced by his rival Pyotr Rachkovsky, whom he despised. One of Rachkovsky&#x27;s first actions was to sack Leonid Ratayev, who had been acting as Azef&#x27;s handler, and to personally take over supervision of him. Azef&#x27;s double dealing was also resented by the Okhrana&#x27;s longer-serving officers, one of whom anonymously tipped off the Socialist Revolutionaries that the Okhrana had recruited two informers in their ranks, Azef, and a man named Tatarov. Boris Savinkov ordered for Tatarov to be killed: he was stabbed to death on 4 April 1906, but the Socialist Revolutionaries could not believe that Azef was also a spy. Nonetheless, fearing more leaks from within the Okhrana, Azef emigrated to Geneva.

He was in Helsinki in February 1906, when he learnt from a go-between named Pinchas Rutenberg that Father Gapon, the popular hero of the 1905 revolution, was also a police informant. Azef ordered that Gapon should be killed &quot;like a snake&quot;, although he took care to ensure that his own paymaster, Rachkovsky, was not killed, too.

== Exposure ==
Late in 1906, Vladimir Burtsev, a left-wing magazine editor, was approached by an Okhrana officer who had turned against the government who provided him with a wealth of accurate information, including the presence of a spy in the leadership of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, whose identity he did not know. Later, Burtsev spotted Azef riding through St Petersburg in an open cab when most revolutionaries were in hiding and suspected that he was the unidentified spy. Unable to prove his suspicions or to persuade any significant figures within the party to share them, Burtsev contrived to meet Alexei Lopukhin in the carriage of a train leaving Cologne and put it to him that Azef was a spy, which Lopukhin confirmed. Burtsev then wrote up the case against Azef and had it printed and dispatched to the Central Committee of the SR Party, who appointed three veteran revolutionaries (Vera Figner, German Lopatin and Prince Kropotkin) to a court of inquiry, which held a month-long hearing in Paris and concluded that Burtsev&#x27;s claims should be taken seriously. Learning where Burtsev had gained his information, Azef secretly visited Petersburg to pressure Lopukhin to repudiate his story. Instead, Lopukhin approached Azev&#x27;s former mentor, Andrei Argunov, in Petersburg to verify Burtsev&#x27;s testimony and travelled to London to give the same information to three of the party&#x27;s representatives. In January 1909, the Central Committee ordered Azef&#x27;s assassination and tried to lure him to an isolated villa in France, but he fled to Germany.

His wife, Ljuba Mankin, who had been unaware of his double-dealing, divorced him and emigrated to the United States. One of his last acts as a spy was to denounce Lopukhin, who was exiled to Siberia for blowing Azef&#x27;s cover.

In Germany, Azef lived with a singer and worked as a corset salesman and stock speculator to invest the money he had amassed during his career as a double agent. He was constantly in fear of being recognised and killed. From 1915 to 1917, during the First World War, he was interned by Germany as an enemy alien. In prison, he suffered from kidney disease.

== Death ==
Yevno Azef died of renal failure in Berlin on April 24, 1918. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Friedhof Wilmersdorf.
