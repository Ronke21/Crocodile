<text>James Renwick Jr. (born November 11, 1818 – June 23, 1895) was an American architect known for designing churches and museums. He designed the Smithsonian Institution Building in Washington, D.C., and St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York. &quot;The Encyclopedia of American Architecture&quot; calls him &quot;one of the most successful American architects of his time&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Renwick was born in Bloomingdale in Upper Manhattan, New York City on November 11, 1818, to a wealthy and well-educated family. His mother, Margaret Brevoort, was from a wealthy and socially prominent New York City family. His father, James Renwick, was an engineer, architect, and professor of natural philosophy at Columbia College, which is now Columbia University. His two brothers went on to become engineers. 

Renwick was not formally trained as an architect, but his ability and interest in building design were nurtured through his cultivated upbringing, which granted him early exposure to travel, and through a broad cultural education that included architectural history. He learned most of his skills from his father, and then studied engineering at Columbia College, now Columbia University, in Manhattan. He entered Columbia at age twelve and graduated in 1836. He received a M.A. three years later. 

==Career==


After graduating from Columbia College, Renwick took a position as a structural engineer with Erie Railroad and subsequently served as supervisor on Croton Reservoir, serving as an assistant engineer on the Croton Aqueduct in New York City.

Renwick received his first major commission at the age of twenty-five in 1843, in which he won a competitive bidding process to design Grace Church, an Episcopal Church in New York City, which was built in English Gothic style. In 1846, Renwick won a competition to design of the Smithsonian Institution Building in Washington, D.C. Built between 1847 and 1855, the Smithsonian&#x27;s many-turreted building, often referred to as &quot;the Castle&quot;, was designed in Romanesque style, as requested by the Smithsonian&#x27;s Board of Regents, and was built with red sandstone quarried at Seneca Quarry in Seneca, Maryland. The Smithsonian Institution Building proved influential in inspiring the Gothic Revival in the United States.

In 1849, Renwick designed the Free Academy Building at present-day City College of New York at Lexington Avenue and 23rd Street in New York City. It was one of the first Gothic Revival college buildings on the U.S. East Coast.

By 1852, he had come to Fredericksburg, VA -- a small city 50 miles south of Washington -- to design and build a courthouse building which still stands. He got into a dispute with the City Council, which then paid Renwick his $27,000 fee. The city then built the courthouse using his plans and reducing its dimensions to fit the local budget.

Renwick went on to design St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 51st Street, which is considered his most notable architectural achievement. He was chosen as architect for the Roman Catholic cathedral in 1853; construction began in 1858, and the cathedral opened in May 1879. The cathedral is the most ambitious Gothic-style structure, and includes a mixture of German, French, and English Gothic influences.

Another of the prominent buildings Renwick designed was Corcoran Gallery of Art, now home to the Renwick Gallery in Washington, D.C., which was designed in Second Empire style. Other works by Renwick include the first major buildings on the campus of Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York (1861–1865), including the Main Hall (1860), Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Church (1871–1872) at Madison Avenue and 44th Street in New York City (since demolished), the All Saints&#x27; Roman Catholic Church (1882–1893) in Harlem in the Victorian Gothic style, and many mansions for the wealthy of the area, including the Peter Aims-Aimes house, known as &quot;Martinstow&quot;, in West Haven, Connecticut. Renwick was the architect of Ascension Memorial Church in Ipswich, Massachusetts, whose cornerstone was laid in October 1869.

Renwick also designed the St. Anthony Hall, the first chapter house for Delta Psi, the secret fraternal college society founded at Columbia University in 1847. Even though the 1879 structure at 29 East 28th Street is marred now by a street level storefront, Christopher Gray wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1990 that, &quot;Old photographs show a high stoop arrangement with the figure of an owl on the peaked roof and a plaque with the Greek letters Delta Psi over the windowless chapter room. In 1879, The &quot;New York Tribune&quot; called it French Renaissance, but the stumpy pilasters and blocky detailing suggest the Neo-Grec style then near the end of its popularity.&quot; In 1899, the fraternity moved to a new chapter house on Riverside Drive and for a few years the original building was kept as a clubhouse for graduate members. At that time a newspaper account described it as a &quot;perfect Bijou of tasteful decoration&quot;.

Among his other designs were banks, the Charity and Smallpox Hospitals on Roosevelt Island, the main building of the Children&#x27;s Hospital on Randall&#x27;s Island, the Inebriate and Lunatic Asylums on Wards Island, and the former facade of the New York Stock Exchange. Renwick was the supervising architect for the Commission of Charities and Correction. A small group of Renwick&#x27;s architectural drawings and papers are held by the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University.

Renwick was also the designer of the bell tower of the Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine in Florida, which was commissioned by Standard Oil partner Henry M. Flagler who was building luxury hotels in the historic city at the time. Renwick and his wife Anna Aspinwall lived and owned property in the lighthouse area on Anastasia Island in Florida. 

In Spring 1890, Renwick listened to Franklin W. Smith deliver a speech to garner support for his &quot;Design and Prospectus for a National Gallery of History of Art at Washington&quot;. Renwick endorsed the idea and offered to provide drawings, plans, and illustrations for the project. Smith gratefully accepted, and the firm of Renwick, Aspinwall &amp; Russell spent six months completing their contribution.

===Firm history===
In the late 1850s, already well-established, Renwick formed a partnership with Richard T. Auchmuty (1831–1893). In 1859 they were joined by Joseph Sands (1830–1879), a son of Ferdinand Sands, and the firm was renamed Renwick, Auchmuty &amp; Sands. Beyond his description as a &quot;convinced Gothicist,&quot; little is known of Sands. In 1861 Auchmuty withdrew to serve in the army during the American Civil War, and the firm was shortened to Renwick &amp; Sands. Renwick&#x27;s partnership with Sands proved to be his longest-enduring. Their commissions included the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in New York City in 1869, and the former New York City Public Charities Building (since razed) at 66 Third Avenue (1868–1871). Sands withdrew from the firm in 1877, two years before his death.

For the next six years Renwick was again a sole practitioner. In 1883 he formed the new partnership of Renwick, Aspinwall &amp; Russell with J. Lawrence Aspinwall (1854–1936), his wife&#x27;s cousin, and William Hamilton Russell (1856–1907), his grand nephew. Both had worked for him as draftsmen since the 1870s. After his graduation from Columbia University Russell became a protégé of his great uncle, who designed the chapter house of Russell&#x27;s fraternity, St. Anthony Hall, on East 28th Street. It is likely Russell contributed work to both his fraternity&#x27;s first chapter house during his apprenticeship.

Russell withdrew in 1891 and the firm was reorganized as Renwick, Aspinwall &amp; Renwick with the addition of William W. Renwick (1864–1933), Renwick&#x27;s nephew. One of the last major works completed by the firm during the elder Renwick&#x27;s lifetime was the George Walter Vincent Smith Art Museum in Springfield, Massachusetts, dedicated about two months before his death.

==Death and legacy==
After Renwick&#x27;s death in 1895, the organization initially continued as Renwick, Aspinwall &amp; Renwick before being changed to Renwick, Aspinwall &amp; Owen with the addition of Walter Tallant Owen (1864–1902), who had been the principal designer of the Springfield art museum. In 1904, it became known as Renwick, Aspinwall &amp; Tucker, then Renwick, Aspinwall &amp; Guard by the late 1920s. Aspinwall was head of the firm until his own death. He was elected an AIA Fellow in 1914.

Renwick died in New York City. He is buried with his wife and father in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.

<text>British Racing Motors (BRM) was a British Formula One motor racing team. Founded in 1945 and based in the market town of Bourne in Lincolnshire, it participated from 1951 to 1977, competing in 197 grands prix and winning seventeen. BRM won the constructors&#x27; title in 1962 when its driver Graham Hill became world champion. In 1963, 1964, 1965 and 1971, BRM came second in the constructors&#x27; competition.

==History==
BRM was founded just after the Second World War by Raymond Mays, who had built several hillclimb and road racing cars under the ERA brand before the war, and Peter Berthon, a long-time associate. Mays&#x27; pre-war successes (and access to pre-war Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union design documents) inspired him to build an all-British grand prix car for the post-war era as a national prestige project, with financial and industrial backing from the British motor industry and its suppliers channelled through a trust fund.

This proved to be an unwieldy way of organising and financing the project, and as some of the backers withdrew, disappointed with the team&#x27;s slow progress and early results, it fell to one of the partners in the trust, Alfred Owen of the Rubery Owen group of companies. Owen, whose group primarily manufactured car parts, took over the team in its entirety. Between 1954 and 1970 the team entered its works F1 cars under the official name of the Owen Racing Organisation. Berthon and Mays continued to run the team on Rubery Owen&#x27;s behalf into the 1960s, before it was handed over to Louis Stanley, the husband of Sir Alfred&#x27;s sister Jean Owen.
A factory was set up in Spalding Road, Bourne, Lincolnshire, behind Eastgate House, Mays&#x27; family home, in a building called &#x27;The Maltings&#x27; (the adjacent former ERA works, vacated in 1939). Several people involved with ERA returned to the firm to work for BRM, including Harry Mundy and Eric Richter. The team also had access to a test facility at Folkingham aerodrome.

===BRM V16===
The first post-war rules for the top level of motor racing allowed 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre normally aspirated engines. BRM&#x27;s first engine design was an extremely ambitious 1.5-litre supercharged V16. Rolls-Royce was contracted to produce centrifugal superchargers, rather than the more commonly used Roots type. The design concept of the V16 had not been used extensively on automobiles before so that design problems were many and the engine did not fire for the first time until June 1949. It proved to be outstandingly powerful but its output was produced over a very limited range of engine speed, coming on suddenly if the throttle was applied carelessly, resulting in wheelspin as the narrow tyres proved unable to transfer the power to the road. This made the car very touchy to drive. Engineer Tony Rudd was seconded to BRM from Rolls-Royce to develop the supercharging system and remained involved with BRM for nearly twenty years.
The Type 15, which was the designation for the V16 car, won the first two races it actually started, the Formula Libre and Formula One events at Goodwood in September 1950, driven by Reg Parnell. However, it was never to be so successful again. The engine proved unreliable and difficult to develop, and the team were not up to the task of improving the situation. A string of failures caused much embarrassment, and the problems were still unsolved when the Commission Sportive Internationale announced in 1952 that for 1954, a new engine formula of 2.5 litres naturally aspirated or 750 cc supercharged would take effect.

Meanwhile, the organisers of all the grands prix counting for the world championship elected to run their races for Formula Two for the next two years, as Alfa Romeo had pulled out of racing and BRM were unable to present raceworthy cars, leaving no credible opposition to Ferrari other than outdated Lago-Talbots and the odd O.S.C.A. The V16s continued to race in minor Formula One races and in British Formula Libre events until the mid fifties, battles with Tony Vandervell&#x27;s Thin Wall Special Ferrari 375 being a particular highlight of the British scene.

===Crisis===

The Type 25 was BRM&#x27;s next car. It used an extremely oversquare (4.05 x 2.95 in, 102.87 x 74.93 mm) 2.5 L atmospheric four-cylinder engine designed by Stewart Tresilian and (as became typical with BRM) it arrived late and took a lot of development; it was so late that the Owen Organisation started the 2.5 L formula with a Maserati 250F. The P25 was initially unsuccessful, not winning a race until a victory at the Dutch Grand Prix in 1959. Colin Chapman helped to improve the car in 1956. Stirling Moss believed that the BRM engine was superior to the Coventry-Climax unit used in his Cooper, and a P25 was briefly run in 1959 by the British Racing Partnership, for Moss (and also Hans Herrmann), and Rob Walker also backed the construction of a Cooper-BRM to gain access to the engine.

The P25 was becoming highly competitive just as the rear-engined Cooper started to become dominant; the P48 was a quick reaction to this, using major components from the P25 but in rear-engined format. The P48 was revised for the 1.5 L rules in 1961, but once again BRM&#x27;s own engine was not ready and the cars had to run with a Coventry-Climax four-cylinder unit in adapted P48 chassis, achieving very little in terms of results.

The firm moved to a purpose-built workshop on an adjoining site in the spring of 1960, but when the 1.5-litre atmospheric Formula One regulation was introduced in 1961, Alfred Owen was threatening to pull the plug unless race victories were achieved very soon.

===Champions===

By the end of the season BRM had managed to build an engine designed by Peter Berthon and Aubrey Woods (BRM P56 V8) (2.6975 x 2.0 in, 68.5 x 50.8 mm) which was on a par with the Dino V6 used by Ferrari and the Coventry Climax V8 used by other British teams. However, the real change was the promotion by Owen of an engineer who had been with the team since 1950 (originally on secondment from Rolls-Royce to look after the supercharging on the V16), Tony Rudd, to the position of chief development engineer. Rudd was the first professional engineer to exercise full technical control over the team, and basic engineering and reliability problems which had plagued the team for years began to vanish. He was given greater responsibility in 1960 after two of the drivers, Graham Hill and Dan Gurney, went on strike and told Alfred Owen they would not drive again, and in early 1962 full executive authority was given to Tony Rudd. Raymond Mays and Peter Berthon were sidelined. The team had designed their first mid-engined car for 1960, matching the other teams, and won the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with Graham Hill as driver, in with the P57. (During 1962, BRM also ran Lucas electronic ignition.) During 1965, at 11,000 rpm was the rated power. However at the high-speed 1965 Italian GP (Monza) an uprated version was raced with at 11,750 rpm for short bursts. A planned 4-valve-per-cylinder version in cooperation with Weslake Engineering never materialised.
As part of Owen&#x27;s attempt to make BRM pay its way, the V8 engine was sold to privateers and appeared in a number of other chassis during the 1.5 L formula, particularly in private Lotus chassis and in smaller marques such as BRP.

A number of privateers acquired 1961 and 1962 BRMs during this period, including Maurice Trintignant and Scuderia Centro Sud; these cars continued to race for many years.

The monocoque BRM P261 V8 car was soon developed and these ran on through the 1.5-litre formula and performed useful service in the early races of the subsequent 3.0-litre formula. In 1965 Jackie Stewart was signed to partner Hill; he took his first grand prix win at Monza in his debut season, and won the first world championship race of the new three-litre formula with a car fitted with a &quot;Tasman&quot; two-litre V8; once again BRM were not ready for the start of a new formula and the old cars continued to be used, even on occasion after the H16 was ready.

===BRM H16===

For , the engine regulations changed to permit three-litre atmospheric (or 1.5-litre supercharged) engines. BRM refused Peter Berthon and Aubrey Woods&#x27;s proposal to build a V12, and instead built an ingenious but very complicated engine, designed by Tony Rudd and Geoff Johnson, the H16 (BRM P75), which essentially used two flat-eight engines (derived from their 1.5L V8) one above the other, with the crankshafts geared together.
BRM found the H16 (2.75 x 1.925 in, 69.85 x 48.895 mm) attractive because it was initially planned to share design elements and components with the successful 1.5-litre V8. While the engine was powerful, it was also heavy and unreliable - Rudd claimed that his drawings were not followed accurately and many of the castings were much thicker and heavier than he had specified (when Lotus took delivery of their first H16 it took six men to carry it from the van to the workshop). At that time, BRM earned the nickname of &quot;British Racing Misery&quot;. BRM, Lotus, and various privateers had been using enlarged versions of the BRM 1.5 V8 of up to 2.1 litres in 1966, as competitive three-litre engines were in short supply in the first year of the new regulations. Lotus also took up the H16 as an interim measure until the Cosworth DFV was ready, building the Lotus 43 to house it, and Jim Clark managed to win the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen with this combination. It was the only victory for this engine in a world championship race. Lotus built the similar Lotus 42 designed for Indianapolis with a 4.2-litre version of the H16 (2.9375 x 2.36 in, 74.61 x 59.94 mm) but this was never raceworthy; the cars were raced with Ford V8s instead.

The H16 engine was redesigned with a narrow-angle four-valve head and magnesium main castings to reduce weight and increase power, but was never raced (it was intended for the 1967 BRM P115) as BRM decided to use the V12 unit which was being sold to other F1 and sports car teams with encouraging results.

===BRM V12===

The H16 was replaced by a V12 (2.9375 x 2.25 in, 74.61 x 57.15 mm) designed by Geoff Johnson. It had been intended for sports car use, but was first used in F1 by the McLaren M5A. Back at the works, the early V12 years were lean ones. In the two-valve layout gave about at 9,000 rpm. In 1968 this had increased to at 9,750 rpm. Geoff Johnson updated the design by adding a four-valve head, based on the H16 485 bhp 4-valve layout; this improved the V12&#x27;s power output to at 10,500 rpm and eventually to a claimed during 1969. In 1973, Louis Stanley claimed at 11,750 rpm. The design and building of the first V-12 chassis, the P126 was contracted to former Lotus and Eagle designer Len Terry&#x27;s Transatlantic Automotive Consultants. The cars first appeared during the 1968 Tasman Championship, powered by 2.5 litre versions of the engine, temporary team driver Bruce McLaren winning the fourth round of the series at Teretonga but being generally unimpressed with the car. BRM themselves built further examples of the Terry design, which were designated P133 and 1968 team drivers Mike Spence and Pedro Rodríguez appeared competitive in early season non championship races at Brands Hatch and Silverstone, but then Spence was killed driving the Lotus 56 turbine during qualifying at Indianapolis. Spence&#x27;s replacement, Richard Attwood, finished a good second to Graham Hill&#x27;s Lotus at Monaco, but after this results went downhill and the season petered out ignominiously. For 1969 the four valve per cylinder engine was developed and a new slimline car, the P139 was built. John Surtees joined as the team&#x27;s lead driver backed up by Jack Oliver. Rodríguez was shunted into the semi-works Parnell team. Surtees&#x27; time at BRM was not a happy one and, despite the fact that a ground effect &quot;wing car&quot; was designed, this was never constructed and the team&#x27;s performances were lacklustre. Surtees left after a single season (1969), along with Tony Rudd who went to Lotus (initially on the road-car side), and Geoff Johnson who departed for Austin Morris.

The team regrouped with Tony Southgate as designer and Rodríguez brought back into the fold to partner Oliver, and gained its first V12 victory when Rodríguez won the 1970 Belgian Grand Prix in a P153, with further victories for Jo Siffert and Peter Gethin in 1971 in the P160. The team had reached one of its intermittent peaks of success. Both Siffert and Rodríguez were killed before the 1972 season and the team had to regroup completely again. Their last World Championship victory came when Jean-Pierre Beltoise drove a stunning race to win the rain-affected 1972 Monaco Grand Prix with the P160. He also won the non-championship 1972 World Championship Victory Race later in the year. The campaign was generally chaotic: having acquired major sponsorship (of Marlboro cigarettes, being the first team in the category to be sponsored by the brand), Louis Stanley originally planned to field up to six cars (three for established drivers, three for paying journeymen and young drivers) of varying designs including P153s, P160s and P180s and actually ran up to five for a mix of paying and paid drivers until it became obvious that it was completely overstretched and the team&#x27;s sponsors insisted that the team should cut back to a more reasonable level and only three cars were run in 1973 for Beltoise, Lauda, and Regazzoni. At the end of the year, Marlboro would transfer its sponsorship to McLaren from 1974 (staying with the team until 1996).

===Decline and fall===

The last notable performance was Beltoise&#x27;s second-place finish in the 1974 South African Grand Prix with the Mike Pilbeam-designed P201, a car with a pyramidal monocoque, very different from the curvy &quot;Coke-bottle&quot; Southgate cars. The Owen Organisation ended its support of the team and it was run on a lower-key basis by Louis Stanley and some of the Bourne personnel as Stanley-BRM until 1977. Old P201s were initially used, with the team hoping for a revival with the bulky and vaguely Ferrari-like P207 - which failed entirely.

Cereal millionaire and amateur racer John Jordan purchased some of the team&#x27;s assets when the team finally folded, and backed the building of a pair of P230 cars by CTG, with the aim of competing in the national-level Aurora AFX Formula One Championship. Teddy Pilette raced a P207 during 1978 with modest success, finishing fourth at Oulton Park and fifth at Brands Hatch. One chassis also apparently raced in the revived Can-Am series.

===Side projects===
The team became involved with Rover&#x27;s gas-turbine project, with the Rover-BRM gas turbine car running at Le Mans in 1963 and 1965; it was damaged in testing and missed the 1964 race. BRM were also involved with Donald Campbell&#x27;s gas-turbine Bluebird-Proteus CN7 project. In later years they also built an unsuccessful Can-Am car, and dabbled with larger versions of the H16 engine for the Indianapolis 500. As a part of the Owen Organisation, BRM also worked on tuned road-car engines for Ford, Chrysler and others. The BRM-tuned version of the 1557 cc Lotus-Ford Twin Cam engine was particularly popular as the Special Equipment option on the Lotus Elan. This improved version of the Lotus-Ford engine was used by Tony Rudd when he left BRM for Lotus to form the basis of the Lotus produced &quot;Sprint&quot; version of the engine used in the Elan Sprint, Elan Plus2S-130, Europa JPS and Caterham Seven.

BRM were contracted by Chrysler (UK) Competition Department to develop a sixteen-valve cylinder head for the Hillman Avenger engine. It proved unreliable, underpowered, and unable to compete with the Ford rally team&#x27;s proven Cosworth BDB-powered RS1600 Escorts.

==BRM engine sales==
The Owen Organisation expected BRM to turn a profit through sales of racing engines; the four-cylinder appeared briefly in a Cooper-BRM special for Stirling Moss but found no other customers. The V8 powered many 1.5-litre cars, including various private Lotuses and Brabhams as well as the BRP works team. Enlarged Tasman Series V8s of between 1.9 and 2.1 L were popular in 1966 as a stopgap before full three-litre engines were widely available. These units were also sold to Matra to power its early sports-prototypes.

A one-litre Formula Two engine was also made available, based on half of the F1 V8. This was not successful, in a formula dominated by Cosworth-Ford and eventually Honda engines.

Team Lotus used the ill-fated H16 engine, scoring its only win.

V12s were sold to other constructors of which the most notable were Cooper, John Wyer and McLaren. Matra entered into a contract with BRM to collaborate in the design of their own V12 engine, but when this became public knowledge the French constructor was forced to drop the involvement with BRM and restart development with a French partner, as its government funding was threatened, but there were still close resemblances between the finished Matra engine and the BRM.

==Sponsorship and colours==

The first BRM cars entered by the BRM works team were a pale duck-egg green (any shade of green represented the British racing green, the national racing colour of Great Britain), but this was later replaced for aesthetic reasons by a very dark metallic shade of grey-green. During the team&#x27;s Owen-owned years the cars bore simple &quot;Owen Racing Organisation&quot; signage. The BRP-entered BRM for Moss and Herrmann was a non-metallic duck-egg green. However, BRM cars entered by non-British privateer teams wore their respective national racing colours, e.g. the Italian Scuderia Centro Sud team ran their cars in Italian red and cars entered by Maurice Trintignant&#x27;s privateer team were in French blue.
At one point in the 1960s Alfred Owen&#x27;s brother Ernest wanted the team to paint their cars orange with black trim, orange being the Owen Organisation&#x27;s corporate colour, used for a band around the nose of the cars and for the mechanics&#x27; overalls; Rudd (who didn&#x27;t like the idea of orange BRMs) pointed out that orange was the Dutch racing colour, when such things were still honoured; through most of the 1960s the cars ran with Owen orange bands round the nose.

The team acquired significant commercial sponsorship from Yardley for the season, running in white with black, gold and ochre stripes in a stylised &quot;Y&quot; wrapping around the car&#x27;s bodywork, losing this deal to McLaren for the season and replacing it by Marlboro&#x27;s familiar white and red (a flat shade, not dayglo) colours. The BRM team became the first F1 team sponsored by Marlboro and at the 1972 Monaco Grand Prix the team achieved their last win which was also the first win for a Marlboro-sponsored F1 car. Ironically this deal was also lost to McLaren for the season, to be replaced briefly by Motul in a pale green and silver colour scheme. As Stanley-BRM the cars initially ran in red, white and blue with no major sponsorship; for the team&#x27;s swansong it was sponsored by Rotary Watches and ran in pale blue and white. The Jordan-BRM P230 was black and gold.

===Later use of BRM name===
BRM raced again as part of a project by John Mangoletsi for a Group C sports car known as the P351 with the backing of the Owen family to use the BRM name. Unfortunately the car was short lived and unsuccessful. In 1997 Keith Wiggins and Pacific Racing would resurrect the car as the BRM P301, using the BRM name only because it was technically a BRM built chassis but had no other connection to British Racing Motors. Heavily modified into an open cockpit sportscar, the car was equally unsuccessful.

A special edition Rover 200 was produced to commemorate the Rover-BRM gas-turbine car; this was finished in Brooklands Green (however not the very dark metallic gunmetal BRM shade) with an orange lower, front grill and silver details.

In October 2008, a press release announced that Bee Automobiles Ltd &#x27;BRM Bee Four ERV&#x27; would compete in the British Speed Hill Climb championships:
:&quot;The &#x27;BRM Bee Four ERV&#x27;, code named the &#x27;Watt 4&#x27;, is an all-electric AWD (all-wheel-drive) vehicle capable of producing 700 hp or 520 kW. The ERV uses motor technology developed at Oxford University. The car is theoretically capable of reaching speeds of up to 250 mph. Participants in the project include Rubery Owen, Oxford University, Oxford Brookes and MIRA Ltd - Motor Industry Research Association. Paul Owen, Grandson of Sir Alfred and Managing Director of Rubery Owen&#x27;s Environmental Technology Subsidiary Rozone Limited, commented: &quot;Rubery Owen is very pleased to see the BRM name once again being used to drive forward an innovative development to take motorsport to new levels&#x27;&quot;

As of 2011, the car had yet to leave the drawing board.

In 2012, Bobbie Neate, granddaughter of Alfred Ernest Owen (who created Rubery Owen) and daughter of Jean Stanley (née Owen) wrote of her memories of BRM racing in the 1950s and 60s in her book &quot;Conspiracy of Secrets&quot;.

==Formula One World Championship results==
===Grand Prix winners===
The BRM team won seventeen Formula One Grands Prix as follows:
==Exhibition==
There is a small exhibition about Raymond Mays, including his interest in BRM, together with the trophies won by BRM while it was owned by the Owen Organisation, at Bourne Civic Society&#x27;s Heritage Centre.

==Computer simulation==
A driveable, detailed virtual recreation of the BRM H16-powered P83/P115 and the BRM P261 was made available in the PC simulation &quot;Grand Prix Legends&quot; that is based on the 1967 Formula One season. An unlicensed recreation of the 1968 BRM P126 can be found in &quot;rFactor 2&quot;.

== Reawakening ==
In celebration of BRM&#x27;s 70th anniversary, John Owen, the 81-year-old son of BRM&#x27;s original owner, the renowned industrialist, Sir Alfred Owen, has commissioned the build of three authentic &#x27;new&#x27; 1950s V16 race cars. BRM&#x27;s technical partners, Hall and Hall, used the original &#x27;engine number two&#x27; a V16 power unit dating back to the 1950s, to help engineers overcome the technical challenges presented by one of the most complex Formula 1 engines of its day – each with more than 36,000 precision-engineered parts.

The re-built engine itself was cautiously tested at Hall and Hall&#x27;s dynamometer at RAF Folkingham, Lincolnshire, where the original BRM Formula 1 engineering team worked during the 1950s. This particular engine has not been run since one of the original BRM team drivers, José Froilán González, then 77 years old, accidentally over-revved it during the at BRM&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebration at Silverstone in 1999.  It was comprehensively &#x27;lunched&#x27;, according to Hall and Hall technicians and has remained in storage ever since.

The three &#x27;new&#x27; P15 V16 BRMs have been made possible by the discovery of three unused chassis numbers which were originally allocated to the racing programme, but never built due to a change in the Formula 1 technical regulations at the time.

The first car commissioned by John Owen is expected to be delivered and presented in public in 2021.

<text>John McDougal (c. 1818 – March 30, 1866) was an American politician who served as the second governor of California from January 9, 1851, until January 8, 1852. Prior to this, he served from 1849 to 1851 as the first lieutenant governor of California.

Born to a political family in Ohio, McDougal would immigrate to California in 1849 aboard the S.S. &quot;California&quot; after serving in the Mexican–American War. After participating in the California Gold Rush, McDougal would enter early California politics a year later as an attendee of the 1849 constitutional convention in Monterey. Entering the lieutenant governorship in 1849, he would succeed to the governorship following the early resignation of Peter Hardeman Burnett.

As Governor, McDougal presided over the creation of the Mariposa Battalion, a state militia unit that killed over 40 Indigenous Californians during the California Indian Wars. McDougal signed legislation to move the state capital from San Jose to Vallejo in modern-day Solano County. After failing to secure the nomination of the California Democratic Party in the 1852 election, McDougal left office and never served in a political capacity for the rest of his life.

== Biography ==
McDougal was born in Union, Ohio ca. 1818 to John McDougall, an Ohio state representative from 1813 to 1815, and Margaret Stockton. The family produced four other sons: William Creighton McDougall, married to abolitionist Frances Harriet Whipple Green McDougall; Dr. Charles McDougall, also known as Charles Dougall, surgeon in the U.S. Army; Admiral David McDougal, commander of during the Battle of Shimonoseki; and George P. McDougal, California and Colorado pioneer. The family later moved to Indianapolis.

In 1846 McDougal joined the Indiana Volunteer Infantry as a lieutenant in the 1st Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment and served in the Mexican–American War. He was soon elected as captain of Company H. He later re-enlisted in the 5th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment.

In 1848, after the Mexican–American War, McDougal moved to California, arriving in 1849 aboard S.S. &quot;California&quot; with his wife Jane and their daughter Sue. He worked as a miner and then a merchant during the gold rush. Shortly after his arrival, he entered into the new territory&#x27;s politics, attending the first constitutional convention in Monterey in 1849. McDougal was one of the original signers of the Constitution of California. During the convention, McDougal was nominated for lieutenant governor, whereupon he remarked, &quot;I reckon I&#x27;ll take that. I don&#x27;t believe anyone else will have it.&quot; After defeating five other contenders for the office, McDougal was sworn in as the state&#x27;s first lieutenant governor in December 1849, along with Peter Burnett as the state&#x27;s first governor.

== Governorship ==
Due to widespread discontent with his administration by the California State Legislature and press, Burnett resigned from the governorship in early January 1851. McDougal assumed the post on January 9. He was relatively inexperienced with any political office. In one of his first acts, McDougal signed legislation sponsored by state senator and former Mexican general Mariano Vallejo on February 4 to remove the capitol from its cramped quarters in San Jose forty miles north to Vallejo.

In the first weeks of his governorship, McDougal was pressured by miners and residents in Mariposa County to intervene in a growing conflict later known as the Mariposa War, with the local Miwok, Chowchilla, and Yokuts tribes opposing encroachment on their land. In late January, he authorized the creation of the 200-man Mariposa Battalion, a state militia unit, to tackle natives he believed were in open rebellion against the state government. In the ensuing conflict, which left over forty dead, the Mariposa Battalion became the first Whites to see Yosemite, while the local tribes ceased violent reprisals on the miner and trader population.

While McDougal continued with the earlier policies of the Burnett administration in taking violent action against California Native Americans and supporting exclusion laws prohibiting African-Americans from entering California, he favored Chinese immigration to meet the state&#x27;s labor shortage and settle undeveloped lands, declaring in his address to the State Legislature on January 7, 1852, that the Chinese &quot;were one of the most worthy classes of our newly adopted citizens, to whom the climate and the character of California were peculiarly suited.&quot;

McDougal&#x27;s popularity peaked in the early days of his administration. Known for his earthy personality, McDougal&#x27;s demeanor connected well with Sierra Nevada miners and Mexican–American War veterans. However, recurring drinking, gambling with assembly and senate members, and frequent quarrels over minor bureaucratic matters hurt his political career. McDougal&#x27;s political mannerisms were also a source of popular amusement. McDougal issued so many proclamations beginning, &quot;I, John McDougal,&quot; that the Governor was soon known throughout the state as &quot;I John&quot;.

Towards the end of 1851, McDougal quarreled with the growing vigilante movement in San Francisco. In a gubernatorial proclamation, he openly condemned the movement&#x27;s lynching of two criminals that year, citing its complete disregard of the city&#x27;s municipal authorities. State law enforcement was still in its infancy, however, and his proclamation was ignored. Bureaucratic frustration with San Francisco&#x27;s vigilante movement would return again during the administration of Governor J. Neely Johnson five years later.

During the 1851 state general elections, the Democratic Party refused to renominate McDougal as the party&#x27;s choice for governor. Instead, state Democrats nominated Assembly Speaker John Bigler as their party&#x27;s nominee.

== Post-political career ==
McDougal left office on January 8, 1852, after completing the single two-year term left vacant by previous Governor Burnett. At the time, California governors served two-year terms, a limit that would not change until the governorship of Leland Stanford in the early 1860s. Just four days after leaving the state&#x27;s highest office, McDougal was involved in a pistol duel with A.C. Russell, editor of &quot;The San Francisco Picayune&quot;. Russell&#x27;s hand was injured in the duel. After attempting to start yet another duel with another individual who had insulted the ex-governor, McDougal was arrested by the San Francisco police. As governor, McDougal had opposed state legislation that would have outlawed dueling, remarking duelers were not fit to live and would eventually kill each other off.

Never taken as a serious political candidate again, McDougal fell out of public view after 1852. The former governor increasingly turned to alcohol as he sank into deep depression. According to some accounts, McDougal attempted suicide on several occasions. McDougal died in San Francisco on March 30, 1866, at the age of 48. Along with J. Neely Johnson, McDougal is one of the youngest governors to die after leaving office. He was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in San Francisco, sharing a plot with his brother David McDougal. When this cemetery was removed from San Francisco, his remains were moved to the Laurel Hill Mound of Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California.

John Eldredge was cast as Governor McDougal in &quot;The Blonde King,&quot; a 1959 episode of the syndicated anthology series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the storyline, James D. Savage (Lane Bradford) has made many friends among Indians of the Yosemite region. When John Trask (Brad Johnson) threatens to disrupt the peace, Savage must stop him. Robert Brubaker played Major Warren.

<text>John Bigler (January 8, 1805November 29, 1871) was an American lawyer, politician and diplomat. A Democrat, he served as the third governor of California from 1852 to 1856 and was the first California governor to complete an entire term in office, as well as the first to win re-election. His younger brother, William Bigler, was elected governor of Pennsylvania during the same period. Bigler was also appointed by President James Buchanan as the U.S. Minister to Chile from 1857 to 1861.

==Biography==
Bigler was born in early 1805 in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Beginning work in the printing trade at an early age, Bigler, as well as his younger brother, William, never received a formal education, yet Bigler took it upon himself to educate his younger brother. In 1831, both brothers moved to Bellefonte in Centre County to buy the local Andrew Jackson-affiliated &quot;Centre Democrat&quot; newspaper, where older John assumed editorial duties. Bigler worked as editor until 1835, when he sold the publication to study law.

When news of the California gold rush reached the East Coast in mid-1848, Bigler, now a middle-aged lawyer, decided to leave for the West Coast to join a law practice. Travelling overland with an ox train, Bigler reached Sacramento in 1849, only to quickly discover that there were no open positions in law. Bigler began to work at a series of odd jobs, including becoming an auctioneer, a wood chopper, and a freight unloader at the town&#x27;s docks along the Sacramento River. Upon hearing of the territory&#x27;s first general election in the same year, Bigler decided to turn to politics, and entered the California State Assembly as a Democrat, one of nine members representing the Sacramento district.

==Political career==
Upon being elected to the first session of the California State Legislature in 1849, Bigler enjoyed a rapid rise to power in the Assembly. Within a year, Bigler was voted by the heavily Democratic majority in the body as the Speaker of the Assembly in February 1850. Now one of the most powerful legislators in the state, Bigler enjoyed widespread name recognition. During the Sacramento cholera epidemic of October 1850, Bigler contracted cholera as a direct result of his remaining in the city and assisting doctors and undertakers.

In May 1851, Bigler was nominated by the Democratic Party convention in Benicia as the party&#x27;s choice for governor in California&#x27;s first general election after achieving statehood. Bigler&#x27;s challenger, the Whig Party&#x27;s Pierson B. Reading, derided Bigler as an unpolished, gruff Yankee Northerner, while Reading articulated himself as an educated pioneering gentleman of the South.

Bigler ran on an explicitly anti-Chinese platform. He won the election by little more than a thousand votes over Reading, which remains today as the closest gubernatorial election in California history.

==Governorship==

Upon assuming the governorship on January 8, 1852, Bigler established his priorities to protect the state&#x27;s highly profitable mining interests from leasing or outside monopolies, declaring in his first inaugural address that these mining interests should be &quot;left as free as the air we breathe.&quot; Bigler also prioritized the industrialization of California, encouraging industrial investment on behalf of the state government.

===Actions against Native Americans and the Chinese===

On March 31, 1854, Bigler approved issuance of a bond entitled &quot;Bond of the State of California for War Indebtedness&quot;, used to pay expenses for &quot;expeditions against the Indians.&quot; It was signed by Bigler, State Comptroller Samuel Bell and State Treasurer Selden A. McMeans. This bond is exhibited in the Oakland Museum of California.

Bigler also enacted a policy to prevent Chinese &quot;coolie&quot; immigrants from entering California. Bigler claimed that the Chinese refused to and could never assimilate into American society, and he also used the immigrants&#x27; willingness to work for little pay as a way to urge Californians to &quot;check this tide of Asiatic immigration.&quot; While the previous administration of Governor John McDougall somewhat supported the Chinese presence in the state, Bigler advocated the revival of the 1850 Foreign Miners Tax, originally signed by anti-foreigner Governor Peter Burnett. Whereas the original 1850 law placed a US$20 per month tax on all miners of foreign origin, the Bigler-supported 1852 version of the law placed a US$3 per month tax exclusively for Chinese laborers. Over the course of his two terms in office, taxes for Chinese immigrants steadily increased, with ever harsher bills passing the Legislature and signed into law by Governor Bigler. One law passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor created a US$50 tax per head (to be paid within three days) for Chinese entering Californian ports. The California Supreme Court later ruled the law unconstitutional.

As Sierra Nevada gold mine output slowed to a trickle by the early 1850s, followed by local financial panic caused by the discovery of gold in Australia, anger towards hard-working and labor-cheap Chinese grew, especially among economically pressured miners, who desperately sought alternative work in California&#x27;s cities and ports. While Bigler aligned himself with popular anti-immigrant and anti-Chinese sentiment, these constituents would later split from the Democrats and spill over into the anti-immigrant American Know-Nothing Party.

Opposition to the constriction of Chinese immigration was voiced by Norman Asing, a leader in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinese community, in an open letter published in 1852. He argued that &quot;we are not the degraded race you would make us&quot; and that &quot;...when your nation was a wilderness, and the nation from which you sprung barbarous, we exercised most of the arts and virtues of civilized life;&quot; therefore, the Chinese should be free to contribute productively to the US.

===Free Soil period===
Pressure was also mounting on the Democratic Party itself in California in regards to slavery. By the 1853 general election campaign, large majorities of pro-slavery Democrats from Southern California, calling themselves the Chivalry (later branded as Lecompton Democrats), threatened to divide the state in half should the state not accept slavery. Bigler, along with former State Senator and Lieutenant Governor David C. Broderick from the previous McDougal administration, formed the Free Soil Democratic faction, modeled after the federal Free Soil Party that argued against the spread of slavery. The Democrats effectively split into two camps, with both the Chivalry and Free Soilers nominating their own candidates for the 1853 election. Despite the party split, Bigler was able to overcome Whig Party challenger William Waldo and became the first California governor to win a second term in office. No other governor of the state would win a second term until Hiram Johnson in 1914.

===Moving the capital===

During Bigler&#x27;s tenure, the state government struggled to find a permanent location for a capital or a capitol building. State Senator Mariano Vallejo&#x27;s promises of Vallejo as being an ideal capital city failed to materialize. For one miserable week in early 1852, the California State Legislature met in the township, quickly discovering the lack of facilities, supplies and furniture. With the suggestion of Bigler and support from city government leaders, the Legislature would temporarily relocate to his adopted city of Sacramento, while Vallejo would remain the permanent capital. However, after flooding problems in Sacramento, and dire weather conditions in Vallejo, the Legislature and Bigler agreed to relocate the capital to nearby Benicia. Conditions in Benicia also proved poor for state bureaucrats. Sacramento offered its services again as a capital, and on February 25, 1854, Governor Bigler signed a law making Sacramento the capital of California. With the exception of a temporary move to San Francisco in 1862 while Sacramento was again flooded, the capital has stayed there since.

Bigler&#x27;s popularity peaked around 1854 to 1855. For the 1855 general election, the Democratic Party renominated Bigler in his bid to gain a third term of office. However, his monopoly on anti-immigrant sentiment began to lose ground. Growing economic troubles due to the slow collapse of gold mining in the Sierras and other gold discoveries in Australia, as well as failures to solve growing state financial debt led to popular discontent with infrastructure and fiscal management within his administration. Bigler&#x27;s administration had attained a general perception of fiscal extravagance among the public. Bigler urged adoption of measures to secure for San Francisco the benefits of the whale trade of the Pacific. The anti-immigrant and Nativist American Know-Nothing Party, led by its nominee, former Whig J. Neely Johnson, defeated Bigler by a moderate margin during the 1855 election. Bigler was the first California governor to be defeated in a general election.

==Post governorship career==
Following his defeat in the 1855 election, Bigler&#x27;s career turned to diplomacy. In 1857, at the insistence of his brother, Pennsylvania Governor William Bigler, President James Buchanan appointed Bigler as U.S. Minister to Chile. Following the completion of his foreign assignment, Bigler re-entered politics, this time on the federal level. Bigler ran as a Southern-friendly Independent for Congress in the 1863 elections, yet failed to win. In 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Bigler as the Internal Revenue Service&#x27;s Federal Assessor for the Sacramento district, but due to open animosity between Congress and President Johnson at the time, the U.S. Senate never confirmed the nomination, and thus Bigler never took the position.

In 1867, Bigler was appointed railroad commissioner for the Central Pacific Railroad. In 1868, he founded the &quot;State Capitol Reporter&quot; and served as its editor until his death in Sacramento on November 29, 1871, at the age of 66. He is interred in the Sacramento Historic City Cemetery.

==Lake Tahoe/Lake Bigler==
At the height of his popularity in 1854, the Democratic majority State Legislature named modern-day Lake Tahoe &quot;Lake Bigler&quot; in honor of California&#x27;s third Governor, who was then beginning his second term. For nearly ten years, the name of the lake had been in dispute. John C. Fremont, one of the lake&#x27;s first White discoverers in 1844, named it &quot;Lake Bonpland&quot; after Aimé Jacques Alexandre Bonpland, a French botanist who had accompanied Prussian explorer Alexander von Humboldt in his exploration of Mexico, Colombia and the Amazon River. Lake Bonpland&#x27;s usage never became popular, with the lake&#x27;s name changing from &quot;Mountain Lake&quot; to &quot;Fremont&#x27;s Lake“ several years after. By 1853, the name &quot;Lake Bigler&quot; began to be applied to maps of the lake after the then-popular California governor. The state legislature officially changed the name the following year.&quot;
Lake Bigler&#x27;s usage never became universal. In just a year, different maps referred to the lake not only as Bigler, but also as &quot;Mountain Lake&quot; to &quot;Maheon Lake.&quot; By 1861, at the start of the American Civil War, former Governor Bigler, once a Free Soil Democrat, had become an ardent Confederate sympathizer. Unionists and Republicans alike derided the former governor&#x27;s name on the lake on official state maps. Pro-Union papers called for a &quot;change from this Secesh appellation&quot; and &quot;no Copperhead names on our landmarks for us.&quot; Several Unionist members in the Legislature suggested changing the name to the fanciful sounding &quot;Tula Tulia.&quot; The &quot;Sacramento Union&quot; jokingly suggested the name &quot;Largo Bergler&quot; for Bigler&#x27;s widely perceived financial incompetency in his final term and contemporary Southern sympathies.

The debate took a new direction when William Henry Knight, mapmaker for the federal U.S. Department of the Interior, and colleague Dr. Henry DeGroot of the &quot;Sacramento Union&quot; joined the political argument in 1862. As Knight completed a new map of the lake, the mapmaker asked DeGroot for a new name of the lake. DeGroot suggested &quot;Tahoe,&quot; a local tribal name he believed meant &quot;water in a high place.&quot; Knight agreed, and telegraphed to the Land Office in Washington, D.C., to officially change all federal maps to now read &quot;Lake Tahoe.&quot; Knight later explained his desire for a name change, writing, &quot;I remarked (to many) that people had expressed dissatisfaction with the name &quot;Bigler&quot;, bestowed in honor of a man who had not distinguished himself by any single achievement, and I thought now would be a good time to select an appropriate name and fix it forever on that beautiful sheet of water.&quot;

&quot;Lake Tahoe,&quot; also like &quot;Lake Bigler,&quot; did not gain universal acceptance. Mark Twain, a critic of the new name, called it an &quot;unmusical cognomen.&quot; In an 1864 editorial regarding the name in the Virginia City &quot;Territorial Enterprise&quot;, Twain cited Bigler as being &quot;the legitimate name of the Lake, and it will be retained until some name less flat, insipid and spooney than &quot;Tahoe&quot; is invented for it.&quot; In Twain&#x27;s 1869 novel &quot;Innocents Abroad&quot;, Twain continued to deride the name in his foreign travels. &quot;People say that Tahoe means &#x27;Silver Lake&#x27; - &#x27;Limpid Water&#x27; - &#x27;Falling Leaf.&#x27; Bosh! It means grasshopper soup, the favorite dish of the digger tribe - and of the Paiutes as well.&quot; The Placerville &quot;Mountain Democrat&quot; began a notorious rumor that &quot;Tahoe&quot; was actually an Indian renegade who plundered upon White settlers. To counter the federal government, the California State Legislature reaffirmed in 1870 that the lake was indeed called &quot;Lake Bigler.&quot;

By the end of the 19th century, usage of &quot;Lake Bigler&quot; had nearly completely fallen out of popular vocabulary in favor of &quot;Tahoe.&quot; The California State Legislature officially reversed its previous decision in 1945, officially changing the name to Lake Tahoe.

<text>Golden Boy is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tatsuya Egawa. It was originally serialized from 1992 to 1997 in the manga magazine &quot;Super Jump&quot;, and later anthologized as ten collected volumes. The series is a sex comedy that follows Kintaro Oe, a 25 year old freeter and university dropout who roams Japan working various odd jobs. During his travels, Kintaro meets several women whose lives he dramatically changes, despite his invariably poor first impressions.

The series was adapted into a six-episode original video animation (OVA) produced by Shueisha and KSS that was released in 1995. A sequel to the manga, &quot;Golden Boy II&quot;, was serialized in &quot;Business Jump&quot; from September 2010 to May 2011.

==Plot==
Kintaro is a freeter, and has done various jobs as he quests around Japan in pursuit of knowledge. His ventures include computer programming, housekeeping, teaching, the culinary arts, and most of all, studying. Kintaro is also often seen demonstrating the skills he has learned in previous chapters to overcome challenges faced in the current one. He is also adept in martial arts, but does not fight unless he is angered, and ordinarily just takes a beating. Much of the humor derives from situational elements, such as encounters between Kintaro and the women gone awry, and interactions between Kintaro&#x27;s libido and imagination. Recurring gags include Kintaro&#x27;s fetish for toilets (especially those recently used by beautiful women), his exaggerated facial expressions, and comical entries in his notebook. The notebook entries include explicit drawings of the women he encounters and bits of wisdom such as &quot;&#x27;C&#x27; base is not sex&quot;, and &quot;The human head cannot turn 360 degrees.&quot; Regarding the series, Tatsuya Egawa writes: &quot;Before leaving kindergarten, I wrote these words in my notebook: &#x27;I really like to study.&#x27; Often I wonder when it was that our schools forgot the true meaning of &#x27;study&#x27;, something which is now so often misunderstood by teachers and parents. Learning ought to be both stimulating and entertaining&quot;.

===Manga===
Written and illustrated by Tatsuya Egawa, &quot;Golden Boy&quot; was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Super Jump&quot; from 1992 to 1997. Shueisha collected its chapters in ten volumes, released from June 4, 1993, to January 9, 1998.

A sequel to the manga, , was serialized in &quot;Business Jump&quot; from September 15, 2010, to May 18, 2011. Shueisha collected its chapters in two &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes, released on February 18 and July 19, 2011.

====Volumes====





===Original video animation===
Adapted by Shueisha and KSS into an original video animation (OVA) series, &quot;Golden Boy&quot; was first released in Japan on VHS and later on laserdisc. The closing theme is &quot;Study A Go! Go!&quot; by Golden Girls. The series was licensed in North America by ADV Films, and was released on VHS, in both subtitled and dubbed editions, later releasing two DVD volumes on April 23 and June 18, 2002, and a complete series release on May 25, 2004. The license was later transferred to Media Blasters for a DVD release on November 6, 2007, and then Discotek Media for a DVD release on November 6, 2012.

====Episodes====
==Reception==
The &quot;Golden Boy&quot; OVA was generally well received by English-language reviewers. It is widely known for its mature content: while the OVA is not strictly a hentai animation, it does feature instances of partial female nudity, orgasms, and female masturbation. In contrast, the manga becomes almost pornographic starting in the second volume. Jeff Ulmer of DigitallyObsessed calls it &quot;hilarious&quot;, and Luis Cruz of AnimeOnDVD says it is &quot;surprisingly well-written for an erotic comedy,&quot; and that it &quot;easily deserves the &#x27;Essential&#x27; moniker bestowed upon it&quot; by ADV. Cruz goes on to say that the series&#x27; jokes &quot;feel like a natural extension of both the characters and the plot...&quot;. Mike Toole of AnimeJump says &quot;the mixture of realistic storytelling with Kintaro&#x27;s deranged personality is always a hoot to watch.&quot; Of Kintaro himself, Toole says he &quot;has a simple everyman appeal&quot;, and Cruz contends that Kintaro&#x27;s &quot;charming character&quot; is what makes the anime coherent. Toole says that &quot;Golden Boy&quot; &quot;is worthwhile for the final episode alone&quot;, and Ulmer feels that it &quot;took the cake&quot;. &quot;Golden Boy&quot; popularized anime in Russia after being a huge success on its MTV Russia.

<text>A siren is a loud noise-making device. There are two general types: mechanical and electronic. Civil defense sirens are mounted in fixed locations and used to warn of natural disasters or attacks. Sirens are used on emergency service vehicles such as ambulances, police cars, and fire engines. 

Many fire sirens (used for summoning volunteer firefighters) serve double duty as tornado or civil defense sirens, alerting an entire community of impending danger. Most fire sirens are either mounted on the roof of a fire station or on a pole next to the fire station. Fire sirens can also be mounted on or near government buildings, on tall structures such as water towers, as well as in systems where several sirens are distributed around a town for better sound coverage. Most fire sirens are single tone and mechanically driven by electric motors with a rotor attached to the shaft. Some newer sirens are electronically driven speakers.

Fire sirens are often called &quot;fire whistles&quot;, &quot;fire alarms&quot;, or &quot;fire horns&quot;. Although there is no standard signaling of fire sirens, some utilize codes to inform firefighters of the location of the fire. Civil defense sirens also used as fire sirens often can produce an alternating &quot;hi-lo&quot; signal (similar to emergency vehicles in many European countries) as the fire signal, or attack (slow wail), typically 3x, as to not confuse the public with the standard civil defense signals of alert (steady tone) and fast wail (fast wavering tone). Fire sirens are often tested once a day at noon and are also called &quot;noon sirens&quot; or &quot;noon whistles&quot;.

The first emergency vehicles relied on a bell. In the 1970s, they switched to a duotone airhorn, which was itself overtaken in the 1980s by an electronic wail.

== History ==
Some time before 1799, the siren was invented by the Scottish natural philosopher John Robison. Robison&#x27;s sirens were used as musical instruments; specifically, they powered some of the pipes in an organ. Robison&#x27;s siren consisted of a stopcock that opened and closed a pneumatic tube. The stopcock was apparently driven by the rotation of a wheel.

In 1819, an improved siren was developed and named by Baron Charles Cagniard de la Tour. De la Tour&#x27;s siren consisted of two perforated disks that were mounted coaxially at the outlet of a pneumatic tube. One disk was stationary, while the other disk rotated. The rotating disk periodically interrupted the flow of air through the fixed disk, producing a tone. De la Tour&#x27;s siren could produce sound under water, suggesting a link with the sirens of Greek mythology; hence the name he gave to the instrument.

Instead of disks, most modern mechanical sirens use two concentric cylinders, which have slots parallel to their length. The inner cylinder rotates while the outer one remains stationary. As air under pressure flows out of the slots of the inner cylinder and then escapes through the slots of the outer cylinder, the flow is periodically interrupted, creating a tone. The earliest such sirens were developed during 1877–1880 by James Douglass and George Slight (1859–1934) of Trinity House; the final version was first installed in 1887 at the Ailsa Craig lighthouse in Scotland&#x27;s Firth of Clyde. When commercial electric power became available, sirens were no longer driven by external sources of compressed air, but by electric motors, which generated the necessary flow of air via a simple centrifugal fan, which was incorporated into the siren&#x27;s inner cylinder.

To direct a siren&#x27;s sound and to maximize its power output, a siren is often fitted with a horn, which transforms the high-pressure sound waves in the siren to lower-pressure sound waves in the open air.
The earliest way of summoning volunteer firemen to a fire was by ringing of a bell, either mounted atop the fire station, or in the belfry of a local church. As electricity became available, the first fire sirens were manufactured. In 1886 French electrical engineer Gustave Trouvé developed a siren to announce the silent arrival of his electric boats. Two early fire siren manufacturers were William A. Box Iron Works, who made the &quot;Denver&quot; sirens as early as 1905, and the Inter-State Machine Company (later the Sterling Siren Fire Alarm Company) who made the ubiquitous Model &quot;M&quot; electric siren, which was the first dual tone siren. The popularity of fire sirens took off by the 1920s, with many manufacturers including the Federal Electric Company and Decot Machine Works creating their own sirens. Since the 1970s, many communities have since deactivated their fire sirens as pagers became available for fire department use. Some sirens still remain as a backup to pager systems. 

During the Second World War, the British civil defence used a network of sirens to alert the general population to the imminence of an air raid. A single tone denoted an &quot;all clear&quot;. A series of tones denoted an air raid.

==Types==
=== Pneumatic ===

The pneumatic siren, which is a free aerophone, consists of a rotating disk with holes in it (called a chopper, siren disk or ), such that the material between the holes interrupts a flow of air from fixed holes on the outside of the unit (called a stator). As the holes in the rotating disk alternately prevent and allow air to flow it results in alternating compressed and rarefied air pressure, i.e. sound. Such sirens can consume large amounts of energy. To reduce the energy consumption without losing sound volume, some designs of pneumatic sirens are boosted by forcing compressed air from a tank that can be refilled by a low powered compressor through the siren disk.

In United States English language usage, vehicular pneumatic sirens are sometimes referred to as mechanical or coaster sirens, to differentiate them from electronic devices. Mechanical sirens driven by an electric motor are often called &quot;electromechanical&quot;. One example is the Q2B siren sold by Federal Signal Corporation. Because of its high current draw (100 amps when power is applied) its application is normally limited to fire apparatus, though it has seen increasing use on type IV ambulances and rescue-squad vehicles. Its distinct tone of urgency, high sound pressure level (123 dB at 10 feet) and square sound waves account for its effectiveness.

In Germany and some other European countries, the pneumatic two-tone (hi-lo) siren consists of two sets of air horns, one high pitched and the other low pitched. An air compressor blows the air into one set of horns, and then it automatically switches to the other set. As this back and forth switching occurs, the sound changes tones. Its sound power varies, but could get as high as approximately 125 dB, depending on the compressor and the horns. Comparing with the mechanical sirens, it uses much less electricity but needs more maintenance.

In a pneumatic siren, the stator is the part which cuts off and reopens air as rotating blades of a chopper move past the port holes of the stator, generating sound. The pitch of the siren&#x27;s sound is a function of the speed of the rotor and the number of holes in the stator. A siren with only one row of ports is called a single tone siren. A siren with two rows of ports is known as a dual tone siren.
By placing a second stator over the main stator and attaching a solenoid to it, one can repeatedly close and open all of the stator ports thus creating a tone called a pulse. If this is done while the siren is wailing (rather than sounding a steady tone) then it is called a pulse wail. By doing this separately over each row of ports on a dual tone siren, one can alternately sound each of the two tones back and forth, creating a tone known as Hi/Lo. If this is done while the siren is wailing, it is called a Hi/Lo wail. This equipment can also do pulse or pulse wail. The ports can be opened and closed to send Morse code. A siren which can do both pulse and Morse code is known as a code siren.

=== Electronic ===

Electronic sirens incorporate circuits such as oscillators, modulators, and amplifiers to synthesize a selected siren tone (wail, yelp, pierce/priority/phaser, hi-lo, scan, airhorn, manual, and a few more) which is played through external speakers. It is not unusual, especially in the case of modern fire engines, to see an emergency vehicle equipped with both types of sirens. Often, police sirens also use the interval of a tritone to help draw attention. The first electronic siren that mimicked the sound of a mechanical siren was invented in 1965 by Motorola employees Ronald H. Chapman and Charles W. Stephens.

=== Other types ===

Steam whistles were also used as a warning device if a supply of steam was present, such as a sawmill or factory. These were common before fire sirens became widely available, particularly in the former Soviet Union. Fire horns, large compressed air horns, also were and still are used as an alternative to a fire siren. Many fire horn systems were wired to fire pull boxes that were located around a town, and this would &quot;blast out&quot; a code in respect to that box&#x27;s location. For example, pull box number 233, when pulled, would trigger the fire horn to sound two blasts, followed by a pause, followed by three blasts, followed by a pause, followed by three more blasts. In the days before telephones, this was the only way firefighters would know the location of a fire. The coded blasts were usually repeated several times. This technology was also applied to many steam whistles as well. Some fire sirens are fitted with brakes and dampers, enabling them to sound out codes as well. These units tended to be unreliable, and are now uncommon.

==Physics of the sound==
Mechanical sirens blow air through a slotted disk or rotor. The cyclic waves of air pressure are the physical form of sound. In many sirens, a centrifugal blower and rotor are integrated into a single piece of material, spun by an electric motor.

Electronic sirens are high efficiency loudspeakers, with specialized amplifiers and tone generation. They usually imitate the sounds of mechanical sirens in order to be recognizable as sirens.

To improve the efficiency of the siren, it uses a relatively low frequency, usually several hundred hertz. Lower frequency sound waves go around corners and through holes better.

Sirens often use horns to aim the pressure waves. This uses the siren&#x27;s energy more efficiently by aiming it. Exponential horns achieve similar efficiencies with less material.

The frequency, i.e. the cycles per second of the sound of a mechanical siren is controlled by the speed of its rotor, and the number of openings. The wailing of a mechanical siren occurs as the rotor speeds and slows. Wailing usually identifies an attack or urgent emergency.

The characteristic timbre or musical quality of a mechanical siren is caused because it is a triangle wave, when graphed as pressure over time. As the openings widen, the emitted pressure increases. As they close, it decreases. So, the characteristic frequency distribution of the sound has harmonics at odd (1, 3, 5...) multiples of the fundamental. The power of the harmonics roll off in an inverse square to their frequency. Distant sirens sound more &quot;mellow&quot; or &quot;warmer&quot; because their harsh high frequencies are absorbed by nearby objects.

Two tone sirens are often designed to emit a minor third, musically considered a &quot;sad&quot; sound. To do this, they have two rotors with different numbers of openings. The upper tone is produced by a rotor with a count of openings divisible by six. The lower tone&#x27;s rotor has a count of openings divisible by five. Unlike an organ, a mechanical siren&#x27;s minor third is almost always physical, not tempered. To achieve tempered ratios in a mechanical siren, the rotors must either be geared, run by different motors, or have very large numbers of openings. Electronic sirens can easily produce a tempered minor third.

A mechanical siren that can alternate between its tones uses solenoids to move rotary shutters that cut off the air supply to one rotor, then the other. This is often used to identify a fire warning.

When testing, a frightening sound is not desirable. So, electronic sirens then usually emit musical tones: Westminster chimes is common. Mechanical sirens sometimes self-test by &quot;growling&quot;, i.e. operating at low speeds.

==In music==
Sirens are also used as musical instruments. They have been prominently featured in works by avant-garde and contemporary classical composers. Examples include Edgard Varèse&#x27;s compositions &quot;Amériques&quot; (1918–21, rev. 1927), &quot;Hyperprism&quot; (1924), and &quot;Ionisation&quot; (1931); Arseny Avraamov&#x27;s &quot;Symphony of Factory Sirens&quot; (1922); George Antheil&#x27;s &quot;Ballet Mécanique&quot; (1926); Dimitri Shostakovich&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 2&quot; (1927), and Henry Fillmore&#x27;s &quot;The Klaxon: March of the Automobiles&quot; (1929), which features a klaxophone.

In popular music, sirens have been used in The Chemical Brothers&#x27; &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; (1992) and in a CBS News &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment played by percussionist Evelyn Glennie. A variation of a siren, played on a keyboard, are the opening notes of the REO Speedwagon song &quot;Ridin&#x27; the Storm Out&quot;. Some heavy metal bands also use air raid type siren intros at the beginning of their shows. The opening measure of Money City Maniacs 1998 by Canadian band Sloan uses multiple sirens overlapped.

==Vehicle-mounted==
===Approvals or certifications===
Governments may have standards for vehicle-mounted sirens. For example, in California, sirens are designated Class A or Class B. A Class A siren is loud enough that it can be mounted nearly anywhere on a vehicle. Class B sirens are not as loud and must be mounted on a plane parallel to the level roadway and parallel to the direction the vehicle travels when driving in a straight line.

Sirens must also be approved by local agencies, in some cases. For example, the California Highway Patrol approves specific models for use on emergency vehicles in the state. The approval is important because it ensures the devices perform adequately. Moreover, using unapproved devices could be a factor in determining fault if a collision occurs.

The SAE International Emergency Warning Lights and Devices committee oversees the SAE emergency vehicle lighting practices and the siren practice, J1849. This practice was updated through cooperation between the SAE and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Though this version remains quite similar to the California Title 13 standard for sound output at various angles, this updated practice enables an acoustic laboratory to test a dual speaker siren system for compliant sound output.

===Best practices===
Siren speakers, or mechanical sirens, should always be mounted ahead of the passenger compartment. This reduces the noise for occupants and makes two-way radio and mobile telephone audio more intelligible during siren use. It also puts the sound where it will be useful. A 2007 study found passenger compartment sound levels could exceed 90dB(A).

Research has shown that sirens mounted behind the engine grille or under the wheel arches produces less unwanted noise inside the passenger cabin and to the side and rear of the vehicle while maintaining noise levels to give adequate warnings. The inclusion of broadband sound to sirens has the ability to increase localisation of sirens, as in a directional siren, as a spread of frequencies makes use of the three ways the brain detects a direction of a sound: Interaural level difference, interaural time difference and head-related transfer function.

The worst installations are those where the siren sound is emitted above and slightly behind the vehicle occupants such as cases where a light-bar mounted speaker is used on a sedan or pickup. Vehicles with concealed sirens also tend to have high noise levels inside. In some cases, concealed or poor installations produce noise levels which can permanently damage vehicle occupants&#x27; hearing.

Electric-motor-driven mechanical sirens may draw 50 to 200 amperes at 12 volts (DC) when spinning up to operating speed. Appropriate wiring and transient protection for engine control computers is a necessary part of an installation. Wiring should be similar in size to the wiring to the vehicle engine starter motor. Mechanical vehicle mounted devices usually have an electric brake, a solenoid that presses a friction pad against the siren rotor. When an emergency vehicle arrives on-scene or is cancelled en route, the operator can rapidly stop the siren.

Multi-speaker electronic sirens often are alleged to have dead spots at certain angles to the vehicle&#x27;s direction of travel. These are caused by phase differences. The sound coming from the speaker array can phase cancel in some situations. This phase cancellation occurs at single frequencies, based upon the spacing of the speakers. These phase differences also account for increases, based upon the frequency and the speaker spacing. However, sirens are designed to sweep the frequency of their sound output, typically, no less than one octave. This sweeping minimizes the effects of phase cancellation. The result is that the average sound output from a dual speaker siren system is 3 dB greater than a single speaker system.

<doc id="874075" wikidata="Q2299009" url="?curid=874075" title="British T-class submarine">
<text>The Royal Navy&#x27;s T class (or Triton&quot; class) of diesel-electric [[submarine]]s was designed in the 1930s to replace the [[Odin-class submarine|O]], [[Parthian-class submarine|P]], and [[Rainbow-class submarine|R]] classes. Fifty-three members of the class were built just before and during the [[World War II|Second World War]], where they played a major role in the Royal Navy&#x27;s submarine operations. Four boats in service with the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] were known as the [[Zwaardvisch-class submarine|Zwaardvisch&quot; class]].

At the start of the Second World War the T class was together with the British S and U class, Dutch and German Type VII one of the most advanced submarine classes in service at the time.

In the decade following the war, the oldest surviving boats were scrapped and the remainder converted to anti-submarine vessels to counter the growing Soviet submarine threat. The Royal Navy disposed of its last operational boat in 1969, although it retained one permanently moored as a static training submarine until 1974. The last surviving boat, serving in the Israel Sea Corps, was scrapped in 1977.

==Development==
The design of what was to become the T class began in 1934 in order to create a replacement for the first British postwar submarines, the O, P, and R classes. These similar classes of submarines had proved unsatisfactory, being mechanically unreliable, large, slow, and over complicated. Furthermore, the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 required that these submarines be retired after 13 years of service. Thus, would have to be paid off in August 1940 (in the event, the outbreak of war in 1939 kept her in service).

The 1930 London Naval Treaty restricted the British submarine fleet to a total tonnage of , a maximum standard surfaced displacement of 2,000 tons for any boat, and maximum gun armament of . The Americans had proposed a limit of 1,200 tons for the 1935 London Disarmament Conference, but this was rejected by the Admiralty since it would exclude the mine-laying submarines. The Admiralty itself proposed retaining the limit of 2,000 tons, hoping that the rival naval powers would build fewer but larger submarines as a matter of national pride, which would be easier to hunt down than numerous smaller submarines. The Conservative government of Stanley Baldwin had also proposed banning the submarine altogether or imposing an individual displacement limit of 250 tons, but the Admiralty correctly predicted that the other nations would not accept such strict limitations and continued with the design of what was then known as the &quot;Repeat P&quot; or &quot;Replace P&quot; class of submarines.

The O, P, and R classes had been designed with the Pacific in mind as a counter to the increasingly powerful Imperial Japanese Navy. In the absence of a battlefleet, the submarines would be the primary offensive weapon against the Japanese. As such, the replacement &quot;Repeat P&quot; class had to have a similar endurance but be easier to maintain, as well as appreciably smaller in expectation of future treaty restrictions. In drawing up the future requirements for the British submarine fleet, 20 of these new submarines were estimated to be required for a total tonnage of 20,000 tons. Rear Admiral (Submarines), Rear Admiral Noel Laurence, one of the most distinguished British submariners of the First World War, also pushed for a strong torpedo armament. He was convinced that a British submarine facing a powerful Japanese surface force would have difficulty penetrating the destroyer screen, and only a large torpedo salvo would be able to ensure the required hits at longer ranges, if necessary using only ASDIC data for a firing solution.

On 27 February 1934, the Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Sir Arthur Johns, was asked to investigate designs for a 1,000-ton displacement patrol submarine. Two DNC designs were drafted (DNC &#x27;A&#x27; and DNC &#x27;B&#x27;), forming the basis of the November 1934 preliminary staff requirement. These designs called for an armament of six internal torpedo tubes, two external tubes, and one (or , if stability permitted) gun, and a patrol capability of at plus sufficient fuel for a 28-day patrol, corresponding to a range of at . Submerged endurance was to be 15 hours at or eight hours at . A maximum submerged speed of , surfaced speed of , and diving depth of were specified. An alternative proposal by Rear Admiral Laurence suggested using a double hull for greater survivability under depth charge attack. However, his proposal was rejected by the DNC in favour of a more conventional single hull with saddle tanks.

Subsequently, in 1935, the &quot;Repeat P&quot; design was modified to reduce the displacement to 1,000 tons in compliance with treaty limitations. In order to do so, Design &#x27;C&#x27; had to sacrifice machinery space, reducing the surfaced speed to only 14.5 kn and the surfaced endurance to at . The design was again modified with Design &#x27;D&#x27;, eliminating fuel stowage in external tanks (which had proved problematic and prone to leakage on the O, P, and R classes) in favor of stowage within the pressure hull. It proved impossible to reduce the displacement back to 1,000 tons without unacceptable reductions to endurance, and the displacement was allowed to rise to 1,075 tons.

After a slight reduction in the length and the fresh water diving requirement of the design, the final design was agreed upon in May 1935. On 24 June 1935, the designation &quot;Repeat P&quot; was formally dropped by the Admiralty, and it was decided that the submarines would all bear names beginning with the letter T. Finally, on 3 September 1935, the name was selected for the lead ship of the class. Final approval for the design was given by the Admiralty Board on 13 February 1936. The Vickers, Cammell Laird, and Scotts shipbuilding companies were invited to submit tenders on 5 December 1935, and on 5 March 1936, the contract for &quot;Triton&quot; was awarded to Vickers Armstrong under the 1935 Programme.

== Design ==
The design of the T-class submarines was dictated by the requirements of an extremely large forward torpedo salvo capability and long patrol endurance for operations in the Pacific against Japanese warships, as well as the need to comply with various treaty restrictions. These extremely challenging requirements led to many compromises in the design. Operational experience before and during the war led to many alterations and modifications to the class, and individual boats often differed noticeably from each other.

=== Hull and superstructure ===
To accommodate the external forward torpedo tubes, most of the T class had distinctive bulbous bows. The original bow shape of the Group One boats adversely affected the speed while surfaced and two of the Group One boats had the external bow tubes omitted during refitting ( and , formerly &quot;Thetis&quot;), resulting in a finer bow shape. Group Two boats had the external bow tubes moved further back, allowing for a finer bow shape that ended the speed loss. They also had two of the external torpedo tubes reversed to face aft along with an additional rear torpedo tube, resulting in a characteristic hump. The final Group Three boats had the bows further fined and the casing around the conning tower and rear-facing torpedo tubes flattened, resulting in a smoother profile.

Pre-war T-class submarines were of riveted construction. The riveted hull proved remarkably strong, with many of the T-class boats exceeding the rated diving depth of during combat. , survived a dive to on 23 April 1940. Welding in the hull construction was officially sanctioned by the Admiralty, after much hesitation, in July 1942 for the pressure hulls of the Group Three boats, later extended to the entire hull. Welded hulls were considerably stronger, allowing a diving depth of and for fuel to be carried in external ballast tanks for increased endurance. Partly welded Group Three boats had riveted external ballast tanks; these were welded up before being sent to the Far East to prevent telltale oil leaks betraying the submarine&#x27;s presence. The estimated crush depth was .

The lead ship, &quot;Triton&quot;, was completed with a very high open bridge, which was very draughty. The following Group One boats had a slightly different bridge shape but these too were exposed, especially during heavy weather. Some of the Group One boats were fitted with cab-type bridges to resolve this problem, which were subsequently standardised in the Group Two boats. Wartime experience would eventually show that the greater visibility from the open bridges was more important in action than the better habitability of the cabs and the final Group Three boats reverted to the open bridge.

T-class boats had eleven main (ballast) tanks, two auxiliary tanks for adjusting trim, five compensating tanks for adjusting to changes in water density and the displacement of the submarine as stores were used up and the bow Q tank used for quick dives or rapid changes in depth. Two of the main tanks were converted into fuel tanks in the Group Three boats to increase endurance for operations in the Far East. Diving time from a 50 per cent buoyancy condition was good by British submarine standards at 30 seconds.

The Group Two and Three boats had the fuel capacity increased on many boats to , giving a surfaced range of at .

=== Propulsion ===
The T-class boats used a variety of diesel engines depending on where they were built. Vickers-built boats naturally used Vickers engines, while those from the Royal Dockyards used Admiralty diesel engines; Cammell Laird boats used Sulzer engines, while the pre-war Scotts boats had German MAN supercharged diesel engines. These engines drove two shafts, each capable of for a top surfaced speed of about . The lead boat &quot;Triton&quot; achieved on her first-of-class trials; this speed was never equaled by any of the other T-class boats, who usually managed about .

The Vickers 6-cylinder 4-stroke 1,250 bhp injection diesel engines fitted to the majority of the T class proved to be very reliable engines, even if they were less advanced than the diesels used by the German U-boats. The engine could continue running even if one cylinder failed by disconnecting the cylinder from the crankshaft. The 12 boats completed at the Royal Dockyards fitted with Admiralty diesel engines proved equally reliable, even though the engines were somewhat more complicated than the Vickers ones.

In contrast, the MAN diesels proved to be rather troublesome. In particular, the MAN diesels were built under license, and once the Second World War broke out in 1939, technical support from the German MAN company immediately stopped. By 1943, only two of the T-class boats with MAN engines were left ( and ), and they were relegated to training use. Even when the Royal Navy in the Far East was facing a critical submarine shortage in March 1944, &quot;Tuna&quot; was rejected from being sent there due to her untrustworthy foreign engines. The Cammell Laird Sulzer 2-stroke engines received mixed reviews; some boats like and were perfectly satisfactory, while the engines caused problems on others. They were insufficiently engineered for running at full speeds, and tended to crack the cylinder rings and blocks.

Submerged propulsion was provided by a 336-cell battery driving two Laurence Scott electric motors. These provided an endurance of 48 hours at or only one hour at the maximum submerged speed of . The battery proved vulnerable to shock damage from depth charge attacks, and this contributed to the loss of in 1942. She sustained depth charge damage from the that ruptured her battery tank and filled the submarine with chlorine gas, forcing her to surface and eventually surrender. This problem was resolved by strengthening the battery compartment and fitting rubber shock absorbers. In contrast with &quot;Tempest&quot;, the modified survived a prolonged depth charge attack from Japanese escort vessels, which rendered her hull a constructive total loss but inflicted no damage to her battery cells whatsoever.

===Weaponry===

==== Torpedoes ====
It was expected from British work on ASDIC that other nations would develop something similar for submarine detection. In the face of expected enemy anti-submarine measures any attack would probably have to be made at long range without the aid of the periscope, using only ASDIC. To counter the resulting inaccuracy, a large salvo of at least eight torpedoes would be needed. British operational planning at the time also assumed that international treaties would prevent unrestricted submarine warfare, and the main purpose of the submarine would be to attack enemy warships. In such a situation, a commander may have only one chance to attack, so a large salvo was essential. The ten-torpedo salvo of the pre-war T-class boats was the largest ever fitted to any operational submarine.

All T-class submarines had six internal torpedo tubes in the bow. These were fitted with bow shutters on early Group One boats to reduce underwater drag; the benefits proved to be rather minimal, the shutters were prone to jamming from flotsam and the idea was dropped in favour of reshaping the torpedo tube orifices for minimal drag. After the loss of due to the unintentional opening of the rear door of a torpedo tube while its bow cap was open, a special safety clip known as the &quot;Thetis clip&quot; was introduced to prevent the rear torpedo tube door from being opened by more than a fraction if the bow cap was not in place. Each T-class boat carried six reload torpedoes in the torpedo stowage compartment for the internal tubes. The reloading process was manual, although a power loading system was experimented with on &quot;Triumph&quot; in 1939 based on one developed on . This system proved underpowered and the pressures of wartime production led to development being curtailed.

The internal torpedo tubes were complemented by four external (&quot;E-type&quot;) 21-inch torpedo tubes on Group One T-class boats, all forward-facing. External tubes were used in order to avoid compromising the structural integrity of the pressure hull with too many openings. These tubes could not be reloaded from within the submarine, and it was also not possible to conduct maintenance on or withdraw the torpedo once it was loaded into the external tube. These tubes were angled downwards at a 5° bow angle to ease operations, except on the lead boat &quot;Triton&quot;. Two of these external tubes were located in the bow, and another two located amidships at the base of the conning tower. Unlike the internal tubes, the bow caps for the external tubes had to be worked manually, requiring a considerable amount of effort. The tubes also proved to be vulnerable to damage. Two of the T-class boats had their bow external tubes omitted during reconstruction: &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; (ex-&quot;Thetis&quot;) and &quot;Triumph&quot;.

Prior to the outbreak of war, there had been much debate over the introduction of stern torpedo tubes on British submarines. The effectiveness of a two-torpedo stern salvo was considered to be doubtful and these tubes would take up valuable space on the submarine. Experience soon led to complaints from British submarine commanders like Commander Anthony Miers (&quot;Torbay&quot;) about the lack of stern torpedo tubes. Thus, eight of the Group One boats (&quot;Taku&quot;, &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;, &quot;Tigris&quot;, &quot;Torbay&quot;, &quot;Tribune&quot;, &quot;Trident&quot;, &quot;Truant&quot;, and &quot;Tuna&quot;) were retrofitted with an eleventh external torpedo tube facing rearwards and this became standard on the Group Two boats onwards. On Group Two boats, the amidships torpedo tubes were also moved aft of the conning tower and reorientated towards the rear. Initially these were angled at 10° off the centerline but this created an area of flat casing that made maintaining depth difficult and for the last two Group Two boats (&quot;Traveller&quot; and &quot;Trooper&quot;) and all of the Group Three boats, the angle was reduced to 7°.

The primary torpedo used by the T-class submarines was the 21-inch Mark VIII torpedo, principally the Mark VIII** variant. This torpedo weighed with a Torpex warhead and used a Brotherhood burner-cycle engine for a range of at or at . It had a greater propulsive efficiency than any contemporary torpedo of a similar size but shortages of the Mark VIII early in the war led to some submarines using the older Mark IV. The Mark VIII was primarily fitted with a contact pistol, which detonated the torpedo upon impact. A non-contact magnetic pistol known as the CCR (Compensated Coil Rod) was also developed and used during the war. Like the magnetic pistols developed by many other countries, the CCR gave endless trouble and was eventually withdrawn. Due to development problems with British postwar torpedoes, the Mark VIII would remain the standard torpedo used by the T class (and all Royal Navy submarines) until 1971 with the introduction of the Mark 23 wire-guided torpedo.

==== Deck guns ====
All T-class submarines, as built, were fitted with one deck gun as a weapon of surprise and self-defence. This was either the 4-inch QF Mark XII or XXII (both interchangeable) on an S1 mounting. The mounting was located above the casing and forward of the conning tower, with a characteristic breastwork that rotated with the gun to provide room for the crew to operate the gun. No armour or overhead protection for the 4-inch gun crew was provided as built due to weight restrictions, except on &quot;Tabard&quot;, &quot;Talent&quot;, and &quot;Teredo&quot;. Many other T-class boats received improvised gun shields manufactured by depot ships in the Far East, providing some degree of protection. The gun had a crew of five, and T-class submarines were initially allocated with 100 rounds of ammunition for the 4-inch gun. This proved insufficient and was soon increased; by the end of the war, T boats would often not carry reload torpedoes in favour of taking more gun ammunition.

The standard anti-aircraft armament carried by T-class submarines was three .303-inch machine guns. These were initially Lewis guns, but from 1941 onward replaced with the better Vickers gas-operated (VGO) machine gun. The Vickers was sometimes substituted with the Bren gun if supplies could be spared from the Army. Later, most T-class boats were retrofitted or completed with the ubiquitous 20 mm Oerlikon. This was located aft of the conning tower. Most T-class boats were fitted with only one, but &quot;Tantivy&quot; carried two 20 mm cannon side by side on pedestal mountings, while &quot;Tireless&quot; was completed with a twin Oerlikon Mark 12A mounting. The crew of &quot;Terrapin&quot; was able to acquire a .50 inch Browning air-cooled machine gun on their own initiative, but this weapon was too powerful for the conning tower&#x27;s brass structure (brass being used instead of steel to prevent any interfering with the magnetic compass), and was eventually dropped.

==Service history==

=== Prewar ===
The lead boat of the class, &quot;Triton&quot;, was commissioned on 9 November 1938. She would be joined by another 14 T-class submarines ordered under the prewar 1936–1938 Programmes. The unfortunate loss of on 1 June 1939 along with 99 of the men on board during her trials led to modification of the Royal Navy&#x27;s submarine escape procedures. &quot;Triton&quot; was the only member of the class to undergo full trials, for the outbreak of war meant that the Royal Navy could not afford this luxury at a time when modern submarines were desperately needed. When war broke out on 1 September 1939, there were only three T-class boats in service: &quot;Triton&quot;, &quot;Triumph&quot; and &quot;Thistle&quot;.

=== Second World War ===

As the Royal Navy&#x27;s standard ocean patrol submarine, the T-class submarines were heavily engaged during World War II, from the North Sea to the Mediterranean, and finally the Far East.

The nature of the British submarine campaign against Germany during the early stages of the war was very different from that of the German submarine campaigns in the Atlantic and the later American submarine campaign in the Pacific. Germany did not depend on heavy mercantile traffic the way Britain was dependent on overseas trade, and thus there were no unprotected convoys or mercantile traffic for the British submarines to ravage. Most German mercantile traffic was confined to the North Sea, which was heavily mined. Thus, British submarines were obliged to undertake long, often fruitless patrols in these confined, dangerous waters.

==== Norway ====

On 10 September 1939, nine days after the war began, &quot;Triton&quot; sighted another submarine while on patrol off the coast of Norway. When the submarine failed to respond to challenges, she fired two torpedoes from the external bow tubes, hitting the submarine with one and sinking it. Unfortunately, this submarine turned out to be , the first British submarine to be lost during the war, with only two of her crew surviving the attack. The crew of the &quot;Triton&quot; was exonerated by a subsequent inquiry, but it was an inauspicious start to the war for the T-class submarine fleet. &quot;Triumph&quot; was unfortunate enough to run into a mine on 26 December 1939 that blew off her bow section, but miraculously survived and was able to return to Rosyth for extensive repairs.

With the start of the Norwegian Campaign in April 1940, increased &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; traffic in support of the German invasion led to more action for the T-class submarines based in the North Sea. On 8 April 1940, &quot;Triton&quot; encountered the German cruisers and &quot;Lützow&quot; but missed with a full salvo of ten torpedoes. Two days later, she had more success after reloading, sinking three ships in a German convoy with six torpedoes. &quot;Truant&quot; also achieved a notable success, hitting and disabling the cruiser , which had to be finished off by an escorting torpedo boat. Two T-class boats were lost during the Norwegian campaign: (torpedoed by on 10 April 1940) and (depth-charged by the Q-ship &quot;Schiff 40&quot;/&quot;Schürbek&quot; on 14 April 1940).

==== Bay of Biscay ====
The British began establishing submarine patrols in the strategic Bay of Biscay, known as the &#x27;Iron Ring&#x27;, in July 1940 after the fall of France and the German occupation of the French Atlantic ports. These became much more important once heavy German warships like , , and arrived there in 1941.

On 15 December 1940, &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; torpedoed the Italian submarine , the first of eventually 14 Axis submarines to fall victim to T-class submarines. On 5 July 1941, &quot;Tigris&quot; accounted for another Italian submarine, the . The &#x27;Iron Ring&#x27; patrols were discontinued after the infamous Channel Dash in February 1942.

==== Mediterranean ====
T-class submarines began to operate in the Mediterranean from September 1940 onward. This was the theatre in which the T class were most heavily engaged in operations and correspondingly suffered proportionately heavy losses.

Operations in the Mediterranean posed several substantial challenges for British submarines and the T class in particular. Firstly, the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot;, almost uniquely among the Axis navies, had devoted a substantial amount of resources and training to anti-submarine warfare. Equipped with their own version of sonar, the &quot;ecogoniometro&quot; (ECG), possessing excellent escort vessels, and making extensive use of mines, the Italians were to prove the most successful of the Axis powers at destroying Allied submarines.

The Mediterranean Sea was also characterised by calm, shallow, and unusually clear waters compared to the North Atlantic. Submarines could often be spotted from the air even when submerged, and the shallow waters made deep diving to escape attack difficult or downright impossible. Having been designed for operations in the Far East, the T boats were substantially larger than the standard German Type VII U-boat, and thus they were more vulnerable to detection and mines.

Conversely, the large sizes of the T-class boats gave them substantially greater endurance and range compared to the smaller standard Royal Navy submarines like the S and U classes. This allowed them to operate successfully from the British bases of Alexandria and Gibraltar, which were located at considerable distances from Axis waters.

The British submarine campaign in the Mediterranean was primarily targeted at Axis convoys from Italy to North Africa supplying the Italian army and German Afrika Korps fighting the British Commonwealth forces in North Africa. Axis air power made it extremely hazardous to use surface warships in this role, and until the Allies were able to establish air superiority over Malta the burden of the anti-shipping campaign would fall on the submarines based in the Mediterranean. British submarines did not operate surfaced during the day in the Mediterranean as it was far too hazardous thanks to Axis air power, surfacing to recharge only at night. By contrast, Axis submarines tended to operate surfaced in broad daylight, a habit described by British submariners as &#x27;truly reprehensible&#x27;. T-class submarines thus proved especially successful against Axis submarines in the theatre, accounting for five Italian submarines for no losses to British submarines.

Thirteen T-class submarines were lost during the Mediterranean campaign, including all but two of the Group Two boats. Over half of these (seven) were lost to Axis minefields. In return, they played a crucial role in denying supplies to the Axis forces in North Africa, which ultimately led to Allied victory in that theatre. For example, &quot;Turbulent&quot; accounted for over 90,000 tons of Axis shipping.

Four Victoria Crosses (VCs) were awarded to T-class submarine crews during the Mediterranean campaign. One, awarded to J. W. Linton, captain of &quot;Turbulent&quot;, was unusual in that it was awarded for sustained effort and not for outstanding bravery in a single action. The other two were awarded to two crew members of &quot;Thrasher&quot;, T. W. Gould and P. S. W. Roberts, who removed two unexploded anti-submarine bombs stuck in the submarine&#x27;s gun casing. &quot;Thrasher&quot; remains the only British submarine in history to have had more than one VC recipient among her crew. The last VC was awarded to A. Miers, captain of &quot;Torbay&quot;, for a daring raid penetrating into Corfu harbour.

=== Far East and Indian Ocean ===
Despite the class being built with operations against the Japanese in mind not a single T class (or any operational British submarine) was left in the theater at the time of the Japanese attack. and were ordered to the area with haste but arrived just in time for Singapore to fall. Following the allied retreat they were based in Ceylon with the surviving Dutch submarines. They were sortied to intercept the expected Japanese route for the Indian Ocean Raid, and &quot;Truant&quot; did sink two Imperial Japanese Army transports, but the Kido Butai did not pass that way.

This small flotilla was all that were available until late 1943 when new S and T-class boats started to arrive. These new arrivals had modifications for better performance in the warmer climates and were better suited for offensive operations. Given Japan&#x27;s need to defend against the American advance, high value targets were limited, though there were some notable successes: sank the and the German-manned &quot;UIT-23&quot;, Taurus&quot; sank the , the Japanese submarine &quot;I-166&quot; and the and Japanese heavy cruiser . became the only British ship to sight Japanese capital units when she spotted the Japanese battleships and during Operation Kita, but was unable to attack.

Though targets of opportunity were poor compared to where US submarines were operating the class performed reasonably well, sinking numerous merchant/cargo ships and smaller Japanese warships along with large numbers of coasters and small vessels. They proved better suited for Far Eastern operations than the smaller S class, having greater crew comfort and range.

=== Postwar ===
After the war, all surviving Group One and Two boats were scrapped and the remainder fitted with snorts.

In the late 1940s and 1950s, most were streamlined for quiet and higher-speed underwater operation against Soviet submarines, in place of the anti-surface-ship role that they had been designed for. In January 1948, it was formally acknowledged that the main operational function of the British submarine fleet would now be to intercept Soviet submarines slipping out of their bases in Northern Russia to attack British and Allied merchant vessels. The following April, the Assistant Chief of Naval Staff, Rear-Admiral Geoffrey Oliver, circulated a paper in which he proposed that British submarines take a more offensive role by attacking Soviet submarines off the Northern Russian coast and mining the waters in the area. With the dramatically reduced surface fleet following the end of the Second World War, he commented that this was one of the few methods the Royal Navy had for &quot;getting to the enemy on his home ground.&quot;

Much of the work carried out on the submarines was underpinned by results of measurements made using , which had been modified in July 1945 – September 1946 to become an acoustic trials submarine, with external tubes and guns removed, the bridge faired, the hull streamlined and some internal torpedo tubes blanked over.

Starting in 1948, eight newer all-welded boats underwent extensive &quot;Super-T&quot; conversion at Chatham Dockyard. The modifications included the removal of deck guns and the replacement of the conning tower with a &quot;fin&quot;, a smooth-surfaced and far more symmetrical and streamlined tower. An extra battery was installed, and a new section of hull inserted to accommodate an extra pair of motors and switchgear. This varied between in the earlier conversions and in the later ones. These changes allowed an underwater speed of or more and increased the endurance to around 32 hours at . The first boats to undergo this modification were in November 1948 – March 1951, followed by in June 1949 – September 1951. The programme was completed with the conversion of in February 1954 – June 1956.

The conversion was not entirely successful since the metacentric height was reduced, making the boats roll heavily on the surface in rough weather. This was alleviated in 1953 in those conversions which had been completed by increasing the buoyancy by raising the capacity of a main ballast tank by 50 tons. This was done by merging it with an existing emergency oil fuel tank. For the four boats remaining to be converted, increase in buoyancy was achieved by lengthening the extra hull section to be inserted from to . The effect was to lengthen the control room and strict instructions were issued that this space was not to be used for extra equipment otherwise the improved buoyancy would be affected.

In the meantime, in December 1950, approval was given for the streamlining of five riveted boats. This was a much less extensive process, with the removal of deck guns and external torpedo tubes, the replacement of the conning tower by a &quot;fin&quot; and replacement of the batteries by more modern versions providing a 23 per cent increase in power. The work was much more straightforward than the conversion of the welded boats and was undertaken during normal refit. The first riveted boat to undergo this modification was in 1951.

The last operational Royal Navy boat of the class was , which was decommissioned on 29 August 1969. The last T-class boat in service with Royal Navy, albeit non-operationally, was , which was permanently moored as a static training submarine at the shore establishment from 1969 until 1974, when she was replaced by .

The last operational boat anywhere was the INS &quot;Dolphin&quot;, formerly , one of three T-class boats (and two S-class ones) sold to the Israeli Navy; it was decommissioned in 1977.

Another submarine sold to Israel, renamed , was lost in the Mediterranean in 1969 while on passage from Scotland to Haifa. Although the wreck was discovered in 1999, the cause of the accident remains uncertain.

==Group One boats==
These fifteen pre-war submarines were ordered under the Programmes of 1935 (), 1936 (next four), 1937 (next seven) and 1938 (last three). The boats originally had a bulbous bow covering the two forward external torpedo tubes, which quickly produced complaints that they reduced surface speed in rough weather. These external tubes were therefore removed from &quot;Triumph&quot; during repairs after she was damaged by a mine and &quot;Thetis&quot; during the extensive repairs following her sinking and subsequent salvage. Only six survived the war, less than half.
* &quot;Triton&quot; sunk in the Adriatic Sea on 18 December 1940
* &quot;Thetis&quot; built at Cammell Laird. Sank during trials in 1939 with 99 dead. &quot;Thetis&quot; was salvaged and recommissioned as &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; in October 1940. Sunk by the Italian corvette &quot;Cicogna&quot; off Strait of Messina on 14 March 1943)
* &quot;Tribune&quot;, built at Scotts, Greenock, commissioned October 1939, scrapped 1947
* &quot;Trident&quot; built at Cammell Laird, commissioned October 1939, scrapped 1946
* &quot;Triumph&quot; built by Vickers, Barrow-in-Furness and commissioned May 1939. Lost, probably to Italian mines, on 14 January 1942
* &quot;Taku&quot; scrapped 1946
* &quot;Tarpon&quot; (probably sunk by German minesweeper &quot;M-6&quot; on 14 April 1940)
* &quot;Thistle&quot; torpedoed by &quot;U-4&quot; on 10 April 1940 off Norway
* &quot;Tigris&quot; (probably sunk by German ship &quot;UJ-2210&quot; on 27 February 1943)
* &quot;Triad&quot; sunk by gunfire from the in the Gulf of Taranto on 15 October 1940
* &quot;Truant&quot; wrecked 1946 on way to breakers
* &quot;Tuna&quot; scrapped 1946
* &quot;Talisman&quot; lost in Mediterranean, probably to Italian mines, on 17 September 1942)
* &quot;Tetrarch&quot;, commissioned February 1940 the only boat completed with mine laying equipment. Lost in Mediterranean, probably to Italian mines, after 27 October 1941.
* &quot;Torbay&quot; built at Chatham, commissioned 1941, scrapped 1947.

==Group Two boats==
These seven vessels were all ordered under the 1939 War Emergency Programme. The first, &quot;Thrasher&quot;, was launched on 5 November 1940. The external bow torpedo tubes were moved seven feet aft to help with sea keeping. The two external forward-angled tubes just forward of conning tower were repositioned aft of it and angled backwards to fire astern, and a stern external torpedo tube was also fitted. This gave a total of eight forward-facing tubes and three rear-facing ones. All Group Two boats were sent to the Mediterranean, only &quot;Thrasher&quot; and &quot;Trusty&quot; returned.
* &quot;Tempest&quot; (sunk by the Italian &quot;Circe&quot; on 13 February 1942)
* &quot;Thorn&quot; (sunk by the Italian &quot;Pegaso&quot; on 6 August 1942)
* &quot;Thrasher&quot;
* &quot;Traveller&quot; (lost, probably to Italian mines, on 12 December 1942)
* &quot;Trooper&quot; (lost, probably to German mines, on 14 October 1943)
* &quot;Trusty&quot;
* &quot;Turbulent&quot; (possibly sunk by an Italian torpedo boat, or a mine in March 1943) During her career, she sank over 90,000 tons of enemy shipping.

==Group Three boats==

Wartime austerity meant that they lacked many refinements such as jackstaffs and guardrails, and had only one anchor. Much of the internal pipework was steel rather than copper. The first Group Three boat was &quot;P311&quot;, launched on 10 June 1942. Welding gradually replaced riveting and some boats were completely welded, which gave them an improved rated maximum diving depth of 350 ft (107 m).

Nine submarines were ordered under the 1940 Programme;
* &quot;P311&quot; (lost, probably to Italian mines, before her name &quot;Tutankhamen&quot; was formally assigned)
* &quot;Trespasser&quot;
* &quot;Taurus&quot; (to the Royal Netherlands Navy as &quot;Dolfijn&quot;)
* &quot;Tactician&quot;
* &quot;Truculent&quot; (sunk in collision on 12 January 1950)
* &quot;Templar&quot;
* &quot;Tally-Ho&quot;
* &quot;Tantalus&quot;
* &quot;Tantivy&quot;

Seventeen submarines were ordered under the 1941 Programme;
* &quot;Telemachus&quot;
* &quot;Talent&quot; (P322) (to the Royal Netherlands Navy as &quot;Zwaardvisch&quot;)
* &quot;Terrapin&quot;
* &quot;Thorough&quot;
* &quot;Thule&quot;
* &quot;Tudor&quot;
* &quot;Tireless&quot;
* &quot;Token&quot;

* &quot;Tradewind&quot;
* &quot;Trenchant&quot;
* &quot;Tiptoe&quot;
* &quot;Trump&quot;
* &quot;Taciturn&quot;
* &quot;Tapir&quot; (to the Royal Netherlands Navy as &quot;Zeehond&quot; (2))
* &quot;Tarn&quot; (to the Royal Netherlands Navy as &quot;Tijgerhaai&quot;)
* &quot;Talent&quot; (P337)
* &quot;Teredo&quot;
Fourteen submarines were ordered under the 1942 Programme, but only five were completed;
* &quot;Tabard&quot;
* &quot;Totem&quot; (lost in accident on passage to Israel as INS &quot;Dakar&quot;)
* &quot;Truncheon&quot; (later the Israeli INS &quot;Dolphin&quot;)
* &quot;Turpin&quot; (later the Israeli INS &quot;Leviathan&quot;)
* &quot;Thermopylae&quot;

The other nine were ordered but cancelled on 29 October 1945 following the end of hostilities:
* &quot;Thor&quot; (P349) (laid down at Portsmouth Dockyard on 5 April 1943 and launched on 18 April 1944. However, the war ended before she was completed and she was sold for scrapping to Rees Shipbreaking Co Ltd of Llanelli, Wales in July 1946. She would have been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name &quot;Thor&quot;, after the mythological Norse god of thunder.
* &quot;Tiara&quot; (also launched on 18 April 1944 at Portsmouth but not completed)
* &quot;Theban&quot; (P341)
* &quot;Talent&quot; (P343)
* &quot;Threat&quot; (P344)
* also four unnamed submarines (P345, P346, P347 and P348).

==Transfers to Royal Netherlands Navy==
Four submarines were transferred to the Royal Netherlands Navy in the 1940s were they formed the &quot;Zwaardvisch&quot; class. Two were later returned in 1953.
* &quot;Tijgerhaai&quot; (ex-&quot;Tarn&quot;): transferred 1944
* &quot;Zwaardvisch&quot; (ex-&quot;Talent&quot;): transferred 1943
* &quot;Zeehond&quot; (2) (ex-&quot;Tapir&quot;): transferred 1948, returned 1953
* &quot;Dolfijn&quot; (ex-&quot;Taurus&quot;): transferred 1948, returned 1953

==Transfers to the Israeli Navy==
Three submarines were sold to the Israeli Navy in the 1960s. &quot;Totem&quot;, renamed &quot;Dakar&quot;, was lost in transit in 1968.
* INS &quot;Dakar&quot; (ex-&quot;Totem&quot;): sold 1965, commissioned 1967; lost January 1968.
* INS &quot;Dolphin&quot; (ex-&quot;Truncheon&quot;): sold 1968
* INS &quot;Leviathan&quot; (ex-&quot;Turpin&quot;): sold 1965, commissioned 1967

<doc id="874087" wikidata="Q5027886" url="?curid=874087" title="Campaigns of 1800 in the Napoleonic Wars">
<text>The Napoleonic Wars continued from 1799 with the French fighting the forces of the Second Coalition. Napoleon Bonaparte had returned from Egypt and taken control of the French government, marking the end of the French Revolution. He prepared a new campaign, sending Moreau to the Rhine frontier and personally going to take command in the Alps, where French forces had been driven almost out of Italy in 1799.

At the start of the campaigning season of 1800, the Austrians had strong armies North and South of the Alps

*about 120,000 men in the Black Forest under Pál Kray (defending the direct (Rhine–Danube) route from France to Vienna
*about 100,000 men in northern Italy under Michael von Melas defending the Austrian possessions in northern Italy, and the Po Valley, which Napoleon had used as a backdoor to Vienna in his previous Italian campaigns

The French had

*about 120,000 men under Moreau facing Kray
*about 40,000 men under André Masséna holding Genoa and preventing invasion of Southern France from Italy
*about 50,000 men under Berthier forming the Army of the Reserve and centred on Dijon
Both the Austrians and the French decided to make their main effort in Italy. (Bonaparte would have preferred the main attack to be on Kray by a flanking move through Northern Switzerland, but the working relationship with Moreau was poor).

==Italy==

Melas attacked first, and by the third week in April had advanced to the Var, with Massena and half his army in Genoa besieged by land by the Austrians and under tight blockade by the Royal Navy. In response Berthier moved – not to the threatened frontier, but to Geneva – and Massena was instructed to hold Genoa until 4 June.
The Army of the Reserve was joined by Napoleon, and in mid-May set out to cross the Alps to attack the Austrian rear. The bulk of the army crossed by the Great St Bernard Pass still covered by snow. Artillery was manhandled over with great effort and ingenuity. On 14 May 1800, the 40,000-strong French army was stopped by 400 Austro-Piedmontese soldiers at Fort Bard in the Aosta Valley. They held the pass for two weeks, completely ruining Napoleon&#x27;s surprise attack on the Po Valley.

Once over the Alps, Napoleon did not proceed directly to the relief of Genoa. Instead, he advanced on Milan, to improve his lines of communication (via the Simplon and St Gotthard passes) and to threaten Melas&#x27;s lines of communication with Mantua and Vienna, in the belief that this would cause Melas to raise the siege of Genoa. He entered Milan on 2 June and by crossing to the South bank of the Po completely cut Melas&#x27;s communications. Taking up a strong defensive position at Stradella, he confidently awaited an attempt by the Austrian Army to fight its way out.

However, Melas had not raised the siege of Genoa, and on 4 June the French Army marched out with all equipment towards France as per the terms of the negotiated evacuation of the city. Napoleon then faced the possibility that, thanks to the British command of the Mediterranean, far from falling back, the Austrians could instead take Genoa as their new base and be supplied by sea. His defensive posture would not prevent this; he had to find and attack the Austrians before they could regroup. He therefore advanced from Stradella towards Alessandria, where Melas was, apparently doing nothing. Convinced that Melas was about to retreat, Napoleon sent strong detachments to block Melas&#x27;s routes northwards to the Po, and southwards to Genoa. At this point, Melas attacked, and for all the brilliance of the previous campaign, Napoleon found himself at a significant disadvantage in the consequent Battle of Marengo (14 June). Napoleon was effectively defeated in a tough battle in the morning and early afternoon; Melas, thinking he had already won, had turned over delivery of the coup de grace to a subordinate, when the prompt return of a detached French force under Desaix and a vigorous French counter-attack (in the course of which Desaix was killed) converted the battle into an important French victory.

Melas promptly entered into negotiations which led to the Austrians evacuating northern Italy west of the Ticino, and suspending military operations in Italy.

Napoleon returned to Paris after the victory, leaving Brune to consolidate in Italy and begin a march toward Austria.

==Germany==

Although the First Coalition forces achieved several initial victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, the efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the Peace of Leoben (17 April 1797) and the subsequent Treaty of Campo Formio (October 1797). This treaty proved difficult to implement. Austria was slow to give up some of the Venetian territories. A Congress convened at Rastatt for the purposes of deciding which southwestern German states would be mediatised to compensate the dynastic houses for territorial losses, but was unable to make any progress. Supported by French republican forces, Swiss insurgents staged several uprisings, ultimately causing the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation after 18 months of civil war. By early 1799, the French Directory had become impatient with stalling tactics employed by Austria. The uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested the timing was fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany.

At the beginning of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced each other across the Rhine. Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance (Bodensee) to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day&#x27;s march from French-held Switzerland.

General of Division Jean Victor Marie Moreau commanded a modestly-equipped army of 137,000 French troops. Of these, 108,000 troops were available for field operations while the other 29,000 watched the Swiss border and held the Rhine fortresses. First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte offered a plan of operations based on outflanking the Austrians by a push from Switzerland, but Moreau declined to follow it. Rather, Moreau planned to cross the Rhine near Basel where the river swung to the north. A French column would distract Kray from Moreau&#x27;s true intentions by crossing the Rhine from the west. Bonaparte wanted Claude Lecourbe&#x27;s corps to be detached to Italy after the initial battles, but Moreau had other plans. Through a series of complicated maneuvers in which he flanked, double flanked, and reflanked Kray&#x27;s army, Moreau&#x27;s army lay on the eastern slope of the Black Forest, while portions of Kray&#x27;s army was still guarded the passes on the other side. Battles at Engen and Stockach were fought on 3 May 1800 between the army of the French First Republic under Jean Victor Marie Moreau and the army of the Habsburg monarchy led by Pál Kray. The fighting near Engen resulted in a stalemate with heavy losses on both sides. However, while the two main armies were engaged at Engen, Claude Lecourbe captured Stockach from its Austrian defenders under Joseph Louis, Prince of Lorraine-Vaudémont. The loss of this main supply base at Stockach compelled Kray to order a retreat to Meßkirch, where they enjoyed a more favourable defensive position. It also meant, however, that any retreat by Kray into Austria via Switzerland and the Vorarlberg was cut off.

On 4 and 5 May, the French launched repeated and fruitless assaults on the Meßkirch. At nearby Krumbach, where the Austrians also had the superiority of position and force, the 1st Demi-Brigade took the village and the heights around it, which gave them a commanding aspect over Meßkirch. Subsequently, Kray withdrew his forces to Sigmaringen, followed closely by the French. Fighting at nearby Biberach an der Ris ensued on 9 May; action principally consisted of the 25,000 man-strong French &quot;Center&quot;, commanded by Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr. After being flanked by General Moreau, who approached Ulm from the east and overwhelmed his outposts at Battle of Höchstädt (1800), Kray retreated to Munich. Again, on 10 May, the Austrians withdrew with heavy losses, this time to Ulm.

A several month armistice followed, during which Kray was replaced by the Archduke John, with the Austrian army retiring behind the river Inn. Austrian reluctance to accept negotiated terms caused the French to end the armistice in mid-November, effective in two weeks. When the armistice ended, John advanced over the Inn towards Munich. His army was defeated in small engagements at the battles of Ampfing and Neuburg an der Donau, and decisively in the forests before the city at Hohenlinden on 3 December. Moreau began a march on Vienna, and the Austrians soon signed the Armistice of Steyr, ending the war in Germany.

==Egypt==

Meanwhile, Kléber remained trapped in Egypt by the British fleet.
He negotiated the Convention of El-Arish with Britain and Turkey to allow him to evacuate by sea, but Britain later repudiated the agreement. Kléber won a battle against the Turks at Heliopolis in March, but was assassinated later in June.

<text>John B. Weller (February 22, 1812August 17, 1875) was the fifth governor of California from January 8, 1858, to January 9, 1860, who earlier had served as a congressman from Ohio and a U.S. senator from California, and minister to Mexico.

==Life and career==
Weller was born in Hamilton County, Ohio, and attended the public schools and Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. He then studied law, was admitted to the bar and practiced in Butler County, Ohio. He was prosecuting attorney of Butler County from 1833 until 1836.

He 1838 he was elected as a Democrat from Ohio to the 26th Congress. He was reelected to the 27th and 28th Congresses, serving from 1839 until 1845.

He served in the 1st Regiment of Ohio Volunteers as a Lieutenant Colonel during Mexican–American War from 1846 until 1847, and then was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for Governor of Ohio in 1848, a bitterly fought campaign, and the only disputed election for Ohio Governor of the 19th century. A select joint committee of the Ohio General Assembly finally established January 22, 1849, that Weller lost by 311 votes to Whig Seabury Ford.

In 1849 and 1850, he was a member of the commission to establish the boundary line between California and Mexico. He was replaced by President Zachary Taylor, a Whig, who first named John C. Frémont. After Frémont resigned without beginning his duties, Taylor appointed John Russell Bartlett.

Weller then settled in California and practiced law. When Frémont&#x27;s term as a U.S. Senator expired on March 3, 1851, the state legislature failed to elect a replacement for the term that started on March 4, so the position remained vacant. In 1852, the legislature elected Weller, and he served from January 30, 1852, to March 3, 1857. During the 34th Congress he was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Military Affairs.

After running unsuccessfully for reelection to the Senate, in 1857 he was elected Governor of California and he served from 1858 to 1860. As Governor, he intended to make California an independent republic if the North and South divided over slavery, and he personally led an assault on San Quentin Prison to take possession from a commercial contractor. 
Weller also sanctioned the genocide of the Yuki Tribe through the granting of a State Commission to Walter S. Jarboe, who was later hired by Weller after US Army Generals refused to join his campaign against the Yuki. Jarboe&#x27;s band, &#x27;The Eel River Rangers&#x27; massacred at 
least 283 men (Jarboe did not list women and children he killed), presenting the State with a bill for $11,143. According to Benjamin Madley, Weller &#x27;officially sanctioned Genocide&#x27;.

After leaving the governorship, he was appointed Ambassador to Mexico near the end of 1860 by the lame-duck Buchanan administration. He presented his credentials in 1861, but was soon recalled by the new Lincoln Administration. He moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1867, where he continued the practice of law and served as a U.S. Commissioner.

==Death and burial==
He died in New Orleans in 1875. Original interment was at Girod Street Cemetery in New Orleans. That burying ground was destroyed in 1959 and unclaimed remains were commingled with 15,000 others and deposited beneath Hope Mausoleum, St. John&#x27;s Cemetery, New Orleans.

==Family==
Weller&#x27;s first wife was Ann E. Ryan, who died in 1836. In 1840, he married Cornelia A. Bryan, who died in 1842. He married Susan McDowell Taylor in 1845, and she died in 1848; she was a daughter of William Taylor, niece of Thomas Hart Benton, and cousin of Jessie Benton Frémont. In 1854, he married Elizabeth Winona Brockelbank (previously married to Stephen Stanton, with whom she had a son, Josiah).

Weller&#x27;s father-in-law, John A. Bryan, was a U.S. diplomat. His brother-in-law, Charles Henry Bryan, was a California State Senator.

<text>An alert state or state of alert is an indication of the state of readiness of the armed forces for military action or a state against natural disasters, terrorism or military attack. The term frequently used is &quot;on high alert&quot;. Examples scales indicating alert state are the DEFCON levels of the US military, South Korea&#x27;s &quot;Jindogae&quot; system, and the UK Threat Levels. High alert states are synonymous with &quot;red alert&quot;.

<doc id="874095" wikidata="Q669519" url="?curid=874095" title="BIKINI state">
<text>The Bikini state was an alert state indicator previously used by the UK Ministry of Defence to warn of non-specific forms of threat, including civil disorder, terrorism or war. Signs giving the current alert state were displayed at the entrance to government buildings and military installations. It was established on 19 May 1970. According to the Ministry of Defence, the word &quot;bikini&quot; was randomly selected by a computer.

Whilst similar to the DEFCON (defence readiness condition) alert states used in the United States, the Bikini levels were defined by the section of the military or organisation rather than UK-wide, and as a result, countermeasures and reactions to differing states may differ as acutely as from building to building. The highest levels of alert, Red and Amber, were only intended to be maintained for limited times. The White state has rarely been used, and is only known to have been used for periods between the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 and 11 September 2001.

The system was illustrated in the British television drama &quot;Threads&quot;, produced by the BBC in 1984.

It was replaced by a more general and public terrorism alert status, the UK Threat Levels, an alert state system in use by the British government since 1 August 2006.

In addition to Bikini alerts that applied to individual installation NATO had a &quot;Counter-Surprise&quot; Military Alert System to mobilise its military forces.

<doc id="874101" wikidata="Q951756" url="?curid=874101" title="Colville Indian Reservation">
<text>The Colville Indian Reservation is an Indian reservation in the Northwestern United States, in north central Washington, inhabited and managed by the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, which are federally recognized.

Established in 1872, the reservation currently consists of , located primarily in the southeastern section of Okanogan County and the southern half of Ferry County. It also includes other pieces of trust land in eastern Washington, including in Chelan County, just to the northwest of the city of Chelan. The reservation&#x27;s name is adapted from that of Fort Colville, which was named by British colonists for Andrew Colville, a London governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.

The Confederated Tribes have 8,700 descendants from twelve aboriginal tribes. The tribes are known in English as: the Colville, Nespelem, Sanpoil, Lakes (after the Arrow Lakes of British Columbia, or Sinixt), Palus, Wenatchi, Chelan, Entiat, Methow, southern Okanagan, Sinkiuse-Columbia, and Nez Perce of Chief Joseph&#x27;s Band. Some members of the Spokane tribe also settled the Colville reservation after it was established.

The most common of the indigenous languages spoken on the reservation is Colville-Okanagan, a Salishan language. Other tribes speak other Salishan languages, with the exception of the Nez Perce and Palus, who speak Sahaptian languages.

==History==
Before the influx of British and Americans in the mid-1850s, the ancestors of the 12 aboriginal tribes followed seasonal cycles to gather their food sources. They moved to the rivers for salmon and other fish runs, mountain meadows for berries and deer, or the plateau for roots. Their traditional territories were grouped primarily around waterways, such as the Columbia, San Poil, Nespelem, Okanogan, Snake, and Wallowa rivers.

Many tribal ancestors ranged throughout their aboriginal territories and other areas in the Northwest (including British Columbia), gathering with other native peoples for traditional activities such as food harvesting, feasting, trading, and celebrations that included sports and gambling. Their lives were tied to the cycles of nature, both spiritually and traditionally.

In the mid-19th century, when European-American settlers began competing for trade with the indigenous native peoples, many tribes began to migrate westward. Trading and its goods became a bigger part of their lives.

For a while, Great Britain and the United States disputed the territory of what the latter called the Oregon Country and the former the Columbia District. Both claimed the territory until they agreed on the Oregon Treaty of 1846, which established United States title south of the 49th Parallel. They did not consider any of the indigenous peoples living in those territories to be citizens or entitled to the lands by their own national claims. However, according to the religions and traditions of the indigenous peoples, this territory had been their home land since the time of creation. A succession of indigenous cultures had occupied this region for more than 10,000 years.

President Fillmore signed a bill creating the Washington Territory, and he appointed as Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Major Isaac Stevens of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, to meet with the Indians during his exploration for railroad routes. Stevens wrote a report recommending the creation of &quot;reservations&quot; for the people in the Washington Territory. The report said, &quot;contrary to natural rights and usage,&quot; the United States should grant lands that would become reservations to the Indians without purchasing from them.

In 1854, negotiations were conducted &quot;particularly in the vicinity of white settlements, toward extinguishment of the Indian claims to the lands and the concentration of the tribes and fragments of tribes on a few reservations naturally suited to the requirement of the Indians, and located, so far as practicable, so as not to interfere with the settlement of the country.&quot;

During this time, continued American settlement created conflicts and competition for resources with the native tribes. It resulted in the Yakima War, which was fought from 1856 to 1859. Negotiations were unsuccessful until 1865. Superintendent McKenny then commented:
From this report, the necessity of trading with these Indians can scarcely fail to be obvious. They now occupy the best agricultural lands in the whole country and they claim an undisputed right to these lands. White squatters are constantly making claims in their territory and not infrequently invading the actual improvements of the Indians. The state of things cannot but prove disastrous to the peace of the country unless forestalled by a treaty fixing the rights of the Indians and limiting the aggressions of the white man. The fact that a portion of the Indians refused all gratuitous presents shows a determination to hold possession of the country here until the government makes satisfactory overtures to open the way of actual purchase.[7]
Seeking to improve relations with the Native Americans, President Grant issued an Executive Order on April 9, 1872, to create an &quot;Indian Reservation&quot; consisting of several million acres of land, containing rivers, streams, timbered forests, grass lands, minerals, plants and animals. People from 11 tribes (the Colville, the Nespelem, the San Poil, Lakes (Sinixt), Palus, Wenatchi, Chelan, Entiat, Methow, southern Okanogan, and the Moses Columbia) were designated to live on a new Colville Indian Reservation.

That original reservation was west of the Columbia River. Less than three months later, the President issued another executive order on July 2, moving the reservation further west, to reach from the Columbia River on the east and south, to the Okanogan River on the west, and the Canada–U.S. border to the north. The new reservation was smaller, at . The Tribes&#x27; historic native lands of the Okanogan River, Methow Valley, and other large areas along the Columbia and Pend d&#x27;Oreille rivers, along with the Colville Valley, were excluded. The areas removed from the reservation were some of the richest in terms of fertility of land and available natural resources.

Twenty years later, the United States changed government policy, intending to dissolve Indian reservations throughout the United States and make allotments of land to individual households in order to encourage subsistence farming. (This would also &quot;free&quot; land declared excess to tribal needs to be sold to non-Native Americans.) Under the General Allotment Act (Dawes Act) of 1887, the members of the tribes at the Colville reservation were registered and land allotted. An 1892 act of Congress removed the north half of the reservation, north of Township 34 (now known as the Old North Half), from tribal control, with allotments made to Indians then living on it, and the rest opened up for settlement by others. In 1891, the tribes had entered into an agreement with the federal government to vacate the Old North Half, in exchange for $1.5 million ($1 per acre) and continued hunting and fishing rights, but the 1892 act was based only loosely on that agreement. The government did not complete payments for the land for 14 years. But the tribes retained their hunting and fishing rights to their former reservation land (superior to those of non-members). As was customary then in reservation allotments, individual Indians living on the Old North Half who refused to move to the remaining south half were allotted only of land, rather than the 160 acres they would have received within the southern reservation boundaries.
The remainder of the communal reservation land was allotted to households, in the same 80-acre amounts, and tribal authority ended, by act of Congress in 1906. The government declared the land not allotted to be excess to tribal needs and opened it for settlement in 1916 by Presidential proclamation. The allotment act was based on an agreement negotiated between the tribes and Indian agent James McLaughlin, signed by 2/3 of the adult male Indians then living on the reservation (of whom there were approximately 600). The Dawes Act enacted a US policy of terminating reservations and tribal government, and did not require any consent by or compensation to Indians. Agreements that Indians did sign were not entirely mutual. They were concerned more with the details of the allotment than the fact of it.

In the face of loss of lands and considerable social distress, President Franklin D. Roosevelt changed federal policy toward the tribes. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 reversed the policy of dissolution of reservations and immediately halted the transfer of reservation land to private ownership. Tribes were encouraged to re-establish their tribal governments and establish constitutions based on democratic electoral models.

In 1956, Congress restored tribal control to the Colville Tribes over all land in the south half that was not yet privately owned. In the time since then, the tribe has gradually purchased private land on the reservation and had it placed back into trust status as tribal land. Since the late 20th century, they have received some of the funds for this from the federal government, pursuant to lawsuits, as compensation for the government&#x27;s mismanagement of the trust lands and insufficient compensation to Indians for former reservation land. In addition, President Barack Obama established a Buy-Back Program.

===Columbia River contamination===

The lands of the Colville Indian Reservation along the Columbia River, are downstream from the Teck Cominco smelter in Trail, British Columbia, Canada. For decades the historic smelter deposited slag from its plant into the river which flows into Roosevelt Lake. In 2004, when it was revealed that the contamination included mercury, lead, and zinc, two members of the Colville Confederated Tribes filed a citizen lawsuit against Teck Cominco in Pakootas v. Teck Cominco Metals. Fish from the Columbia River is the traditional food of the Colville people who value the fish &quot;for subsistence, cultural and spiritual reasons&quot;.

==Description==
The reservation encompasses of land, consisting of: tribally owned lands held in federal trust status for the Colville Confederated Tribes, land owned by individual Colville tribal members (most of which is also held in federal trust status), and land owned by other tribal or non-tribal entities.

7,587 people live on the reservation (2000 census), including both Colville tribe members and non-tribe members. Most live either in small communities or in rural settings. Approximately half of the Confederated Tribes&#x27; enrolled members live on or near the reservation. According to the Tribes records in 2015, they have 9,500 enrolled members.

Major towns and cities within the reservation include Omak (part), Nespelem, Inchelium, Keller, and Coulee Dam (part).

In 1997 and 1998, the Colville Confederated Tribes commemorated the 125th anniversary of the signing of the Executive Order that created the reservation.

==Government==

The Confederated Tribes and the Colville Indian Reservation are governed by the Colville Business Council. From its administrative headquarters located at the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Agency at Nespelem, the Colville Business Council oversees a diverse, multi-million-dollar administration that employs from 800 to 1,200 individuals in permanent, part-time, and seasonal positions.

Members of the Colville Business Council are elected to a renewable two-year term of office. Four council members are elected from each legislative district noted above, except for the lesser-populated Keller District, which elects two. Each year, half of the Business Council seats in each district are up for election. Elections are held mid-June, with votes cast in person at polling sites at a predesignated location (usually the local community center) or by absentee ballot.

=== Legislative districts ===
The tribe is governed by a Chairman and the Colville Business Council, the latter consisting of members elected from tribal legislative districts. These are as follows.

*Omak District: The largest district by population, this consists of the northwestern portion of the reservation: the Okanogan Valley and the eastern portion of the city of Omak. The Okanogan River is the western border of the reservation and delimits the reservation portion of Omak.
*Nespelem District: The west-central portion of the reservation, including the Nespelem Valley and part of the city of Coulee Dam. The Reservation Headquarters is located in the district on the Bureau of Indian Affairs Agency campus near the town of Nespelem. In Coulee Dam, the Columbia River also serves as a reservation border within the town limits.
*Keller District: This is the east-central region of the reservation, namely the San Poil Valley to the mouth of the Columbia River, along a tributary, the San Poil River, and the edge of the man-made Lake Roosevelt.
*Inchelium District: The north-east part of the reservation.

=== Judicial Branch ===
The Colville Tribal Court is a separate branch of government consisting of the Colville Tribal Court of Appeals and the Colville Trial Court. It is the duty of the Courts to interpret and enforce the laws of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. The Chief Judge of the Colville Trial Court is appointed to a six year term by the business counsel and is subject to a vote of confidence by the general membership three years after appointment.

==Economy==
Colville Tribal Federal Corporation (CTFC) has responsibility for managing economic development. It manages 13 enterprises that &quot;include gaming, recreation and tourism, retail, construction and wood products.&quot; CTFC is an economic leader in northeastern Washington. &quot;The corporation employs over 800 people&quot; and generates more than $120 million annually in revenues.

After three years in development, in 2013 the tribes opened the Chief Joseph Hatchery for salmon fishery enhancement below the Chief Joseph Dam, in an effort to aid restoration of the salmon run on the Columbia River. In the first year, they released 1.9 million smolts. In 2017, at full production, they expect to release 2.9 million. Typically, only one percent return as adults.

At the First Salmon Ceremony in May 2016, there was a special celebration as these tribes and members of others from both sides of the 49th parallel commemorated the return of salmon to the river, and the first jacks to return to the hatchery. When adult salmon return in 2017, they will be ready for harvest. Members of the United Columbia Upriver Tribes Committee are collaborating on ways to restore runs above the Chief Joseph and Grand Coulee dams, using new technology that eases the passage of fish.

==Education==
The Keller school district serves students from Kindergarten-6. Colville Tribes students have the choices of attending junior and senior high school at relatively nearby Wilbur High School, Lake Roosevelt High School or Republic High School. Due to historically negative perceptions about Native Americans, students from Keller seldom attend the school in the predominantly European-American town of Republic, Washington. Students sometimes encounter discrimination and poor perceptions also in Wilbur, Coulee Dam, and other towns neighboring the reservation.

Pascal Sherman Indian School, located outside Omak at St. Mary&#x27;s Mission, is the only Native American residential school on the reservation currently serving grades pre-K-to-9. Inchelium School district and Lake Roosevelt High School are the only public K-12 schools within the physical boundaries of the reservation.

Students have few options to pursue a post-secondary education on the reservation, as the Tribes have not established their own college. Spokane Tribal College and Salish Kootenai College have a joint venture on Nespelem&#x27;s Agency Campus. The public Community Colleges of Spokane have an outreach campus in Inchelium. Wenatchee Valley College North Campus is located in Omak.

Many students from the reservation typically attend four-year college in the state, at such institutions as Eastern Washington University, Washington State University, Central Washington University, Gonzaga University (a Catholic university founded to serve Native Americans), or University of Washington. Heritage College also offers some courses and degrees in Omak at the Wenatchee Valley College-North Campus building.

* &quot;Coyote quarrels with mole&quot; (coyote fighting with his wife)
* &quot;Spirit chief names the animal people&quot; (about the naming of the &quot;Chip-chap-tiqulk)

<doc id="874103" wikidata="Q829329" url="?curid=874103" title="Magia (Shakira album)">
<text>Magia (, ) is the debut studio album by Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira. It was released in June 1991 by Sony Music Colombia, with whom she signed a three-album recording contract. The record is a collection of pop ballads Shakira wrote since she was eight years old, with themes inspired from the experience hanging out with boys, adventure stories, and dreams of living on the coast.

The album&#x27;s live performances helped Shakira receive attention on Colombian media. However, it was not a commercial success, with sales estimated at between 1,000 and 1,200 copies. By Shakira&#x27;s request, &quot;Magia&quot; and its follow-up &quot;Peligro&quot; (1993) were removed from music markets. &quot;Magia&quot; was released as promotional single in 1991.

==Development and composition==
Born in Barranquilla, Colombia, Shakira began writing songs at the age of eight years, her first one being &quot;Tus Gafas Oscuras&quot;. Her performances at local competitions led to a meeting with local theater producer Monica Ariza, who later held an audition for her in Bogotá. She performed three songs for executives of Sony Music Colombia, who were impressed enough to sign her, at the age of 13, to record three albums, which were &quot;Magia&quot;, &quot;Peligro&quot; and &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot;.

The low-budget &quot;Magia&quot; was put in almost three months of pre-production, which involved choreography of live performances for the album, singing lessons for Shakira, and arranging the songs. The concept of the music still reflected her personality, despite the fact that it was managed by the record label. The tracks deal with emotions of a person&#x27;s first time falling in love, and range from a love poem (&quot;Sueños&quot;) to a celebration of dance (&quot;Esta noche voy contigo&quot;). These were influenced from experiences with males such as her ex-boyfriend Oscar Pardo, stories told by her father, and dreams of living on the coast. In the book &quot;Shakira: Woman Full of Grace&quot;, Ximena Diego wrote that the album &quot;demonstrated her [Shakira&#x27;s] indisputable potential.&quot;

&quot;Magia&quot; is a collection of songs written by Shakira between the ages of 8 and 12, and mainly consists of pop ballads. It was produced by Miguel E. Cubillos and Pablo Tedeschi, and recorded at Aga Studios in Bogotá, when Shakira was 13. A Sony Music Colombia representative said that the recording process was simple and went perfectly fine; however, for Shakira, the process was problematic, as she had no ability to decide which tracks would be included and no input into the rhythmic structure or artistic production of the songs.

==Release and promotion==
To promote the launch of the album, as a suggestion from Shakira, live performances were held in locations such as Teatro Amira de la Rosa, Cartagena, Santa Marta, Riohacha, Medellín, Cali, Bogotá, and other various theaters and events, all of which received print, radio and television coverage. The performances featured additional dancers and background vocalists such as César Navarro, Guillermo Gómez, Mauricio Pinilla, and Richard Ricardo. A music video was done for &quot;Magia&quot;, which Navarro also starred in. Navarro found working with Shakira enjoyable and relaxing, and recalled her as sensitive and energetic: &quot;She was a tireless worker, but more than anything, she was a total blast.&quot; The choreography for the performances was done by Gary Julio and Ray Silva. The album won an award at the Viña del Mar International Song Festival in 1991, although Shakira was not able to attend the ceremony as she was less than 16. Despite the live performances and the amount of media coverage, the LP did not fare well commercially; between 1,000 and 1,200 copies were sold in her home country.

Initially, Shakira refused to allow the re-release of both &quot;Magia&quot; and her next album, &quot;Peligro&quot;, because of their &quot;immaturity.&quot;

<text>Maria Gabriela Stefania Korwin-Piotrowska (1857–1921), known as Gabriela Zapolska, was a Polish novelist, playwright, naturalist writer, feuilletonist, theatre critic and stage actress. Zapolska wrote 41 plays, 23 novels, 177 short stories, 252 works of journalism, one film script, and over 1,500 letters.

Zapolska received most recognition for her socio-satirical comedies. Among them, &quot;The Morality of Mrs. Dulska&quot; – a tragic-farce about petty-bourgeois – is considered the most famous internationally. It is regarded as a landmark of early modernist Polish drama. Her stage plays were translated into foreign languages, and performed at Polish and European theatres, as well as adapted for radio and film. Zapolska herself acted on stage in over 200 plays in Warsaw, Kraków, Poznań, Lwów, Saint Petersburg and Paris.

==Life==
Zapolska was born on 30 March 1857 in Pidhatsi, near Lutsk, in Volhynia, to a wealthy family of Polish landed gentry. At that time, this territory was part of the Russian Empire. Her father, Wincenty Kazimierz Jan Korwin-Piotrowski, was a marshal of Volhynian szlachta. Her mother - Józefa Karska, a former ballet dancer. Zapolska studied at the Sacré Coeur Institute and in the Institute of Education and Science in Lwów. In 1876 she was forced by her family to marry a Polish lieutenant in the Tsarist guard, Konstanty Śnieżko-Błocki, but soon left him and divorced in 1888. During the years of 1879–1880 she lived in Warsaw, where she acted in an amateur theatre ran by the Philanthropy Society. In 1881 Zapolska became pregnant by an out-of-wedlock relationship and left her family. The same year she made her own short story debut by &quot;Jeden dzień z życia róży&quot; (&quot;One Day in the Life of a Rose&quot;). The following year, in 1882, she became a professional actress in the Kraków theatre, and assumed the pseudonym of Gabriela Zapolska. She also acted in Poznań, and in travelling troupes throughout the Congress Poland. In October 1888 she reportedly made a suicide attempt.

In 1889 Zapolska moved to Paris in hopes of an artistic career. There, she played minor roles in boulevard theatres, Théâtre Libre and Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre. She played in a stage adaptation of &quot;Intérieur&quot; (&quot;Interior&quot;) by Maurice Maeterlinck in Théâtre de l&#x27;Oeuvre. In Paris, Zapolska established contacts within the artistic milieu as well as with Polish socialist emigrants, which influenced her social views.

After coming back to her country, she settled in Kraków and acted in garden theatres, travelling troupes, and then in Kraków Juliusz Słowacki Theatre directed by Tadeusz Pawlikowski. Her defiant, suffragist nature led to conflicts with theatre principals. Following Pawlikowski&#x27;s departure, in 1900 she abandoned her contract. After that, Zapolska set up her own stage which was active time-by-time. In 1902 Zapolska ran a drama school in Kraków and the Gabriela Zapolska Independent Theatre was founded later. Her experiences in Paris let her to produce two Maeterlinck stage adaptations – &quot;Princess Maleine&quot;, and &quot;L&#x27;Intruse&quot; (&quot;The Intruder&quot;), both produced in 1902.

In 1904 she moved to Lwów and married a painter, Stanisław Janowski. She became a patron of the travelling theatre named after her (Gabriela Zapolska Theatre) which during the years of 1907–1908 toured Galicia. She divorced her second husband in 1910. In the years of 1912–1913 Zapolska was a literary director of Teatr Premier. As a feuilletonist and theatre critic she collaborated with &quot;Gazeta Krakowska&quot;, &quot;Słowo Polskie&quot;, &quot;Nowa Reforma&quot;, &quot;Ilustracja Polska&quot; and &quot;Wiek Nowy&quot;. In 1915, after Lwów was captured by the Russian Army, she ran a small confectionery. Zapolska died on 17 December 1921 in Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine) and buried at the Lychakivskiy Cemetery there.

==Style and themes==
Gabriela Zapolska&#x27;s works were dominated by naturalism – a literary movement seeking to replicate everyday reality. She was mainly influenced by Émile Zola, a French naturalist writer. Her output has a journalistic and didactic tone. She portrayed the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable people including proletarians, Jews, servants, prostitutes, etc.

Characters in Zapolska&#x27;s works are mostly of ordinary type. She tends to skip psychological analysis as it was specific for the Young Poland writers. She also brought up controversial subjects, such as prostitution and venereal disease (&quot;O czym się mówi&quot;, &quot;O czym się nawet myśleć nie chce&quot;).

Zapolska created acrimonious and embittered literary characters, such as those in her best-known works, &quot;Moralność pani Dulskiej&quot;, 
&quot;Żabusia&quot;, &quot;Ich czworo. Tragedia ludzi głupich&quot;, &quot;Sezonowa miłość&quot;, and &quot;Panna Maliczewska&quot;.

===Prose===

Gabriela Zapolska made her own short story debut in 1881 by &quot;Jeden dzień z życia róży&quot;. Many of her early works was published in parts in Lwów and then, in Warsaw press, mainly in &quot;Przegląd Tygodniowy&quot;. She collected her early short stories in the volume of &quot;Z dziejów boleści&quot; (1890). Her novels and short stories were translated into many languages, including English, Russian, German, Swedish, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Ukrainian. Zapolska was criticized by conservatives for the more naturalist aspects of her works, such as perceived immorality, squalor, taboo subjects, etc. Notable Zapolska prose works include:
* &quot;Jeden dzień z życia róży&quot; (&quot;One Day in the Life of a Rose&quot;, 1881)

* &quot;O czym się nawet myśleć nie chce&quot; (1914)

===Dramas===
Zapolska is best known for her dramas, socio-satirical comedies and tragicomedy works. Her &quot;Moralność pani Dulskiej&quot;, a &#x27;petty-bourgeois tragic-farce&#x27;, is considered by her most-known work and regarded as a landmark of early modernist Polish drama. The story of &quot;Moralność pani Dulskiej&quot; was continued in two short stories—&quot;Pani Dulska przed sądem&quot; and &quot;Śmierć Felicjana Dulskiego&quot;. Her dramas were translated into other languages, played at the Polish and European stages, and adapted into radio and film. Notable Zapolska dramas include:
* &quot;Żabusia&quot; (&quot;Froggie&quot;, 1897)
* &quot;Małka Szwarcenkopf&quot; (1897)
* &quot;Jojne Firułkes&quot; (1898)

<doc id="874105" wikidata="Q1756136" url="?curid=874105" title="Sun cross">
<text>A sun cross, solar cross, or wheel cross is a solar symbol consisting of an equilateral cross inside a circle.

The design is frequently found in the symbolism of prehistoric cultures, particularly during the Neolithic to Bronze Age periods of European prehistory. The symbol&#x27;s ubiquity and apparent importance in prehistoric religion have given rise to its interpretation as a solar symbol, whence the modern English term &quot;sun cross&quot; (a calque of ). The symbol means &quot;village&quot; in Ancient Egyptian (Gardiner symbol O49).

The same symbol is in use as a modern astronomical symbol representing the Earth rather than the Sun. In pharmacy, sun cross symbol represents various/miscellaneous drugs.

After World War II, variants of the symbol became associated with neo-Nazi and white supremacist movements.

==Interpretation as solar symbol==

The interpretation of the simple equilateral cross as a solar symbol in Bronze Age religion was widespread in 19th-century scholarship. The cross-in-a-circle was interpreted as a solar symbol derived from the interpretation of the disc of the Sun as the wheel of the chariot of the Sun god.
Wieseler (1881) postulated an (unattested) Gothic rune (&quot;wheel&quot;) representing the solar deity by the &quot;wheel&quot; symbol of a cross-in-a-circle, reflected by the Gothic letter &quot;hwair&quot; (𐍈).

The English term &quot;Sun-Cross&quot;, on the other hand, is comparatively recent, apparently loaned from German and used in the 1955 translation of Rudolf Koch&#x27;s &quot;Book of Signs&quot; (&quot;The Sun-Cross or Cross of Wotan&quot;, p. 94).

The German term was used in 19th-century scholarly literature of any cross symbol interpreted as a solar symbol, an equilateral cross either with or without a circle, or an oblique cross (saltire). was used of the flag design of the Paneuropean Union in the 1920s. In the 1930s, a version of the symbol with broken arms (resembling a curved swastika, illustrated below) was popular as a link between Christianity and Germanic paganism in the German Faith Movement.

==Archaeological record==
===Bronze Age===
In the prehistoric religion of Bronze Age Europe, crosses in circles appear frequently on artifacts identified as cult items, for example the &quot;miniature standard&quot; with an amber inlay that shows a cross shape when held against the light, dating to the Nordic Bronze Age, held at the National Museum of Denmark, Copenhagen. The Bronze Age symbol has also been connected with the four-spoked chariot wheel, which is attested in Bronze Age Scandinavia, Central Europe and Greece (compare the Linear B ideogram 243 &quot;wheel&quot; ). In the context of a culture that celebrated the sun chariot, it may thus have had a &quot;solar&quot; connotation (compare the Trundholm sun chariot).
==Modern culture==

===Astronomy===
The same symbol represents the Earth in astronomical symbols, while the Sun is represented by a circle with a center point.

===Commerce===
The Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad emblem was a cross in a circle with the words &quot;Santa Fe&quot; across the horizontal bar. In this case, the lines making up the cross were much wider than the circle.

===Ethnography===
The Sacred Hoop aka Medicine Wheel is a similar symbol in widespread use by Native Americans including Plains Indians and previously by Hopewell cultures. Other indigenous peoples also use or used the solar cross on their symbolism and as decoration practices.

===Politics===
The Sassanian Empire in Persia used a similar solar cross on their banner, called the Derafsh Kaviani symbol.

The Norwegian fascist party used a golden sun cross on a red background as an official symbol from 1933 to 1945. The cross with the circle was associated with Olaf II of Norway, patron saint of Norway, and the colors were the coat of arms of Norway.

The Paneuropean Union, a European unification movement, uses this symbol as central element of its flag.

A square cross interlocking with or surrounded by a circle is one of the most popular symbols used by individuals and organisations to represent white nationalism, white supremacy, Neo-Nazism, and white pride. In its Celtic cross form, it is used as the logo for white nationalist website Stormfront. This stems from the use of a circled cross by Norwegian Nazis during World War II. In New Zealand, the Odin&#x27;s cross was one of the symbols used by on Brenton Tarrant in the Christchurch mosque shootings.

In Germany, a &quot;stylized&quot; circled cross was adopted by a prohibited political party (VSBD/PdA), leading to a ban of the symbol if used within a context of promoting racism (see &quot;Strafgesetzbuch section 86a&quot;). Although there were doubts on the constitutionality of the ban, it was upheld in a decision of the supreme court.

In Italy, there is a similar ban based on &quot;Legge Mancino&quot; (the &quot;Mancino Law&quot;, from the Minister of Interior who enacted the law), although there are some examples of the use of the circled cross as a Roman Catholic symbol in Northern Italy.

===Tools===
A similar glyph is used in tool sets to denote Phillips-head screws and screwdrivers.

==Unicode==
There is no formal code point in Unicode for this symbol, though other symbols representing the sun are included. Symbols designed for other purposes, such as , and , and are similar.

<text>Sayh al Uhaymir 169 (SaU 169) is a 206 gram lunar meteorite found in the Sayh al Uhaymir region of the Sultanate of Oman in January 2002.

This stone is an impact-melt breccia with exceedingly high concentrations of thorium and other incompatible elements; phosphorus, rare-earth elements, and the three most important naturally occurring radioactive elements, potassium, thorium, and uranium, have been segregated in the liquid phase when the lunar minerals crystallized. The impact that eventually sent this stone to the Earth is dated at 3.9 billion years and could be the Imbrium impact. It collided with the Earth less than 9,700 years ago.

It is complete, a light gray-greenish rounded stone, dimensions and mass , found on January 16, 2002, in the central desert of Oman at 20° 34.391&#x27; N and 57° 19.400&#x27; E.

According to geologist Edwin Gnos and coworkers, the meteorite&#x27;s origin can be pinpointed to the vicinity of the Lalande impact crater; isotopic analysis shows a complex history of four distinct lunar impacts: 
&quot;Crystallization of the impact melt occurred at 3909 ± 13 Ma, followed by exhumation by a second impact at 2800 Ma, which raised the sample to a regolith position at unconstrained depth. A third impact at 200 Ma moved the material closer to the lunar surface, where it mixed with solar-wind–containing regolith. It was launched into space by a fourth impact at &lt;0.34 Ma&quot;.

<text>James Herbert Budd (May 18, 1851 – July 30, 1908) was an American lawyer and Democratic politician. Involved in federal and state politics, Budd was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for the 2nd California district from 1883 to 1885, and served as the 19th governor of California from 1895 until 1899.

== Biography ==
Budd was born on May 18, 1851, in Janesville, Wisconsin, to Joseph H. and Lucinda (Ash) Budd. While in Wisconsin, Joseph was a lawyer and ran Western Novelty Works, a company which put out farm machinery. When Budd was seven years old, he and his family emigrated to the West, settling in Stockton, California, in 1858. Budd attended local grammar and high schools before attending the University of California, Berkeley, where he was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity, graduating in 1873. Following his graduation, Budd returned to Stockton to study law, being admitted to the California Bar the following year. His public career in the courts began after being appointed the San Joaquin County deputy district attorney.

During the 1884 elections, the Democratic Party nominated Budd as its candidate for the 2nd California district in the U.S. House of Representatives. His campaign for the House was based on fighting railroad corruption, going as far as to refuse any travel on railroads altogether during the campaign, earning Budd the nickname &quot;Buckboard Jim.&quot; Budd won the election, becoming the first Democrat to win the district since the Civil War.

Once in the U.S. Congress, Budd was influential in gaining enough congressional support for appropriating federal money to fund the dredging of the Stockton Channel, assisting shipping into the Port of Stockton along the San Joaquin River. Budd served a single term in the U.S. House of Representatives, refusing the Democratic Party nomination for the 1886 elections.

For the 1894 state general elections, Budd was nominated by the state Democratic convention as the party&#x27;s nominee for the governorship. During the campaign, Budd targeted the growing influence of the Southern Pacific Railroad and rail monopolies in general, proposing that the &quot;only solution to the railroad question was that the [state] government own a line&quot; with slight nationalization, as well as reducing railroad fares by 25%. Budd also advocated a property assessment ceiling cap of 45 cents per $100 in order to save state expenditures with the looming Long Depression.

During the often bitter campaign for the governorship, Budd faced serious allegations brought forth by Republican-sympathizing newspapers that he had raped a teenage maid, Nancy Neff, in 1876. The papers alleged that Neff had become pregnant, giving birth to a child that shortly died afterwards. After giving birth, Neff was alleged to have contracted smallpox and sent by Budd to a hospice to die, but not before Budd had forced her to relinquish all her property to him. Budd fully denied all the allegations, branding his betrayal of Neff as an &quot;infamous falsehood&quot; imagined by Republican party machines. Budd did not deny he knew Neff, yet claimed instead that he had always acted as a brother to Neff and in no way harmed her.

Despite the serious charges, Budd&#x27;s campaign remained largely successful. He gained favorable attention during the campaign by personally quieting a runaway team of horses, as well as helping extinguish a fire in Willows.

In the final results, Budd edged out Republican Party challenger Morris M. Estee by 0.4%, or roughly 1,200 votes. The strong third place showing of Jonathan V. Webster of the People&#x27;s Party at 18% helped tip the vote balance in Budd&#x27;s favor. It was the first gubernatorial election where the Australian ballot was used in California.

Due in part to his narrow electoral victory, Republicans alleged Budd had engaged in voter fraud. The California State Assembly investigated these claims through a special committee. The Assembly committee&#x27;s findings concluded that no evidence of vote wrongdoing could be found.

== Governorship ==
 Budd became the 19th Governor of California on January 11, 1895. In the early stage of his governorship, Budd encouraged improvements to the Australian ballot, consolidating or eliminating superfluous state departments and positions to save revenue, and amend the Constitution of California in order to create stricter qualification requirements for State Railroad Commission members. Budd desired a Railroad Commission substantially less influenced by the Southern Pacific and other rail monopolies.

During his governorship, Budd pushed legislation through the California State Legislature in 1895 to create the Bureau of Highways, an agency to construct and manage maintenance to the state&#x27;s growing road network. The Bureau of Highways would later evolve into the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). The following year, Budd authorized the purchase of the Lake Tahoe Wagon Road, making it the first state highway.

Budd&#x27;s push for future legislation, however, was slowed by the Legislature, which was controlled by an increasingly hostile Republican majority. Although Budd was able to reduce state expenditures gradually, including closing down the State Printing Office, his reform program for increased railroad oversight was halted by the opposition, limiting his ability to make any long-term political reforms.

With his health failing, Budd decided not to seek re-election in 1898. Budd would be the last Democrat to occupy the Governor&#x27;s Office until Culbert Olson in 1939.

== Post governorship ==
Following the end of his first and only term, Budd relocated to San Francisco, opening a law practice in the city. He served as an attorney to the Board of State Harbor Commissioners. In 1900, Budd was appointed by Governor Henry Gage as a member of the Regents of the University of California.

Budd died at the age of 57 on July 30, 1908, in Stockton, and is buried in the city&#x27;s Rural Cemetery.

== Legacy ==
The Budd Center and Budd Shops at San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton are named after the governor. Budd Lake in Yosemite National Park was named for him.

<text>The Lahontan Dam is a dam situated on the Carson River in the Carson Desert between Carson City, Nevada and Fallon, Nevada in the United States. Its impoundment is known as the Lahontan Reservoir or Lake Lahontan. It is currently operated by the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District.

The Lahontan Dam was built by the Bureau of Reclamation as part of the Newlands Project. It is an earthen structure, high by long and contains of fill. When it was completed in 1915, it was the largest earth-fill dam in the United States. The reservoir receives water from an area of and provides a storage capacity of at spillway crest. An additional can be stored by raising the gates, bringing the total capacity to .

The primary purpose of the dam is to impound water for irrigation use. The site also includes hydroelectric generators with a total capacity of 4,000 kilowatts.

== History ==
Construction began as part of the Truckee-Carson Project in 1911 and Lahontan City, Nevada, a company town, was built for the workers. Water distribution for irrigation began in 1916 and in the same year the project was renamed to the Newlands Project.

<text>James Norris Gillett (September 20, 1860 – April 20, 1937) was an American lawyer and politician. A Republican involved in federal and state politics, Gillett was elected both a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from California from March 4, 1903, to November 4, 1906, and as the 22nd governor of California from January 9, 1907, to January 3, 1911.

== Biography ==
James Gillett was born in Viroqua, Wisconsin, on September 20, 1860. As a young child, Gillett moved with his parents to Sparta, Wisconsin, at the age of five. He remained in Sparta for nearly fifteen years, attending the town&#x27;s grammar and high school. In 1881, Gillett was admitted to the Wisconsin Bar and began a law practice in Sparta shortly afterwards. In the early 1880s, Gillett permanently relocated out of his native Wisconsin for the West, living briefly in both the Montana Territory and Washington Territory before moving to California. He settled in Eureka in 1884.

Once in Eureka, Gillett joined the state militia as a private in the Eureka Guard Company in 1885. Based primarily in Santa Cruz, Gillett&#x27;s unit would be called into active military service only once, assisting Humboldt County sheriffs in protecting a local town jail during the height of Sinophobic riots in Eureka. Following the end of his state military service, Gillett quickly resumed his career as a lawyer. In 1890, Gillett became the Eureka City Attorney, holding the position until 1895.

By the mid-1890s, Gillett had become interested in state politics. Running as a Republican, Gillett was elected to the California State Senate in the 1896 general elections. After serving a single term in the State Senate, Gillett successfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1902 House elections. He successfully defended his seat again in the 1904 elections.

Gillett&#x27;s success in Washington was noticed by state Republicans and lobbyists for the Southern Pacific Railroad, who saw Gillett&#x27;s politics as supporting their own corporate interests. Attending the state Republican convention in Santa Cruz in 1906, party machine boss Abe Ruef sought to replace incumbent Governor George Pardee with Gillett for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. Pardee, a physician and staunch Progressive and conservationist politician, openly opposed the Southern Pacific&#x27;s monopoly over cargo and transportation, believing its business influence harmful to the state&#x27;s economy and politics. In backroom deals, Southern Pacific lobbyists, including Ruef and Southern Pacific political bureau chief William Herrin, persuaded the attending Republican delegates to refuse Pardee renomination, instead handing the nomination to the railroad-friendly Gillett. In response to their support, Gillett promised the Southern Pacific waterfront patronage.

The denying of Pardee&#x27;s renomination caused immediate controversy and outrage. Pardee, due to his efficient bureaucracy and direction of the state government&#x27;s response to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, remained an enormously popular politician. His replacement by Gillett, a Railroad Republican, caused anger both in the press and within political circles. The &quot;San Francisco Call&quot; printed a photograph taken at the convention&#x27;s end of Gillett among top party bosses entitled &quot;the Shame of California.&quot; Gillett&#x27;s nomination by special interests would fuel calls for a direct primary law in the state.

Despite his highly controversial nomination, Gillett would win the governorship in the 1906 general elections, defeating Democrat Theodore A. Bell, Socialist Austin Lewis, Prohibitionist James H. Blanchard, and William Langdon of the Independence League. Langdon&#x27;s strong third-place showing of 14.4% sapped votes away from both the popular contenders Gillett and Bell, yet enough to tip the balance in Gillett&#x27;s favor.

Following his successful election, Gillett resigned from his U.S. House seat.

== Governorship ==
Inaugurated on January 9, 1907, as the 22nd governor of California, Gillett&#x27;s agenda included the construction of more transcontinental railroads between California and the East. In addition, Gillett, like his predecessor Pardee, encouraged the California State Legislature to debate the direct primary, though remained vague on his support for any such law. Gillett also included within his agenda the expansion of harbors, especially in the case of the Port of San Francisco following the 1906 firestorm, to keep up with the state&#x27;s expanding commerce and ongoing population boom. Gillett also pushed bills through the Legislature to create state measures assisting federal food safety laws, particularly for the expanding fruit and California wine industries.

During his governorship, Gillett encouraged and signed laws to reform state parole guidelines, assisting prisoners to more quickly reform themselves and return as productive members of society. In 1907, he signed landmark amendments to the state&#x27;s Poison Act prohibiting the sale of opium and cocaine except by a doctor&#x27;s prescription, setting the stage for the state Board of Pharmacy to launch an aggressive crackdown on narcotics and Chinese smoking opium seven years before the Harrison Act. In 1909, Gillett passed the state&#x27;s first eugenics law, making it legal for state officials to sterilize mental patients considered clinically insane, prisoners exhibiting sexual or moral perversions, and anyone with more than three criminal convictions. The law was passed unanimously in the Assembly, and had one dissenting vote in the Senate. Some 19,000 people were sterilized between 1909 and 1950, when eugenics became generally disfavored by the medical profession due to its connections with Nazi Germany.

As automobiles became more common along California&#x27;s roads, Gillett agreed with the Legislature to pass the State Highway Bond Act of 1909. The act, which created a bond worth $18 million, effectively established the California state highway system. The system would collectively organize state roads, numbering them sequentially, and provide greater funds for maintenance and expansion.

Gillett&#x27;s governorship, however, remained continually marred with controversy due to his Republican nomination by party machine business interests. Writing in &quot;The Los Angeles Examiner&quot;, influential cartoonist George Herriman continually depicted Governor Gillett as a mule for Southern Pacific interests. Indeed, while in office, Gillett appealed to the railroads to not levy excessive charges on shipping companies and municipalities, yet still warmly welcomed their economic and political presence in the state. His warm relations with the Southern Pacific led in part to rising Progressive anger within state Republican ranks, culminating in the election of Hiram Johnson and a large number of like-minded Progressive state legislators in the 1910 elections.

By 1910, Gillett was falling quickly into financial trouble, and decided not to seek re-election. Privately, however, it is believed that his wife, Isabella, did not want Gillett to continue the governorship.

== Post governorship ==
Following his departure from the Governor&#x27;s Office, Gillett opened a law practice in San Francisco. From 1916 to 1920, Gillett worked in Washington, D.C., as an attorney and lobbyist for the San Francisco-based Associated Oil Company and the Oil Industry Association. Gillett&#x27;s lobbying in the U.S. Congress helped secure passage of the Oil Leasing Bill in 1920, which pertained to leases in the naval petroleum reserves. Gillett would go on to represent many oil industry companies and individuals in oil lease matters. Throughout the 1920s Gillett completed over twenty years&#x27; work in obtaining compensation for the owners and crews of sailing vessels seized by the U.S. federal government in the Bering Sea between 1886 and 1894.

Gillett retired from the law practice in 1929, only to begin a new practice in 1934 in Oakland with his son, James Gillett Jr.

Gillett died April 20, 1937, in Berkeley at the age of 76.

<text>A condemned prisoner&#x27;s last meal is a customary ritual preceding execution. In many countries, the prisoner may, within reason, select what the last meal will be.

== Contemporary restrictions in the United States ==
Contrary to the common belief that all last meal requests, regardless of their complexity, must be fulfilled, various restrictions are in place over what can be requested.

In the United States, most states give the meal a day or two before the actual execution and now use the euphemism &quot;special meal&quot;. Alcohol and tobacco are usually, but not always, denied. Unorthodox or unavailable requests are replaced with similar substitutes. Some states place tight restrictions. Sometimes, a prisoner asks to share the last meal with another inmate (as Francis Crowley did with John Resko in 1932) or has the meal distributed among other inmates (as requested by Raymond Fernandez in 1951).

In Florida, the food for the last meal must be purchased locally and the cost is limited to $40. In Oklahoma, the cost is limited to $25. In Louisiana, the prison warden traditionally joins the condemned prisoner for the last meal. On one occasion, the warden paid for an inmate&#x27;s lobster dinner.

In Texas, the tradition of customized last meals is thought to have been established around 1924. However, in September 2011, the state of Texas abolished all special meal requests after condemned prisoner Lawrence Russell Brewer requested a large and expensive last meal, but did not eat any of it, stating that he was not hungry. Since then, the prisoner&#x27;s last meal is whatever is being served in the Huntsville Unit cafeteria on the day of execution.

==Documented last meal requests==
This represents the items requested, as reported, but does not in all cases represent what the prisoner actually received.

<text>In computing, a clone is hardware or software that is designed to function in exactly the same way as another system. A specific subset of clones are remakes (or remades), which are revivals of old, obsolete, or discontinued products.

== Motivation ==
Clones and remakes are created for reasons including competition, standardization, availability across platforms, and as homage. Compatibility with the original system is usually the explicit purpose of cloning hardware or low-level software such as operating systems (e.g. AROS and MorphOS are intended to be compatible with AmigaOS). Application software is cloned by providing the same functionality.

Commercially-motivated clones are made often during a competitor product&#x27;s initial successful commercial run, intentionally competing with the original and trying to participate in their success.

==Hardware==
===Hardware clones===
When IBM announced the IBM PC in 1981, other companies such as Compaq decided to offer clones of the PC as a legal reimplementation from the PC&#x27;s documentation or reverse engineering. Because most of the components, except the PC&#x27;s BIOS, were publicly available, all Compaq had to do was reverse-engineer the BIOS. The result was a machine with similar performance and lower price than the machines cloned. The use of the term &quot;PC clone&quot; to describe IBM PC compatible computers fell out of use in the 1990s; the class of machines it now describes are simply called PCs, but the early use of the term &quot;clone&quot; usually implied a higher level of compatibility with the original IBM PC than &quot;PC-Compatible&quot;, with (often Taiwanese) clones of the original circuit (and possibly ROMs) the most compatible (in terms of software they would run and hardware tests they would pass), while &quot;legitimate&quot; new designs such as the Sanyo MBC-550 and Data General/One, while not infringing on copyrights and adding innovations, tended to fail some compatibility tests strongly dependent upon detailed hardware compatibility (such as ability to run &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot;, or any software that bypassed the standard software interrupts and directly accessed hardware at the expected pre-defined locations, or—in the case of the MBC-550 for example—wrote diskettes which could not be directly interchanged with standard IBM PCs).

While the term has mostly fallen into commercial disuse, the term &quot;clone&quot; for PCs still applies to a PC made to entry-level or above standard (at the time it was made) which bears no commercial branding (e.g., Acer, Dell, HP, IBM). This includes, but is not limited to, PCs assembled by home users or corporate IT departments. (See also White box (computer hardware).)

There were many Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clones due to the popularity and longevity of the Nintendo Entertainment System.

===Hardware remakes===
Examples for hardware remakes include recent home computer remakes.

A special kind of hardware remakes are emulators which implement the hardware functionality completely in software. For instance, the WinUAE emulator software tries to behave exactly like a physical Amiga.

==Software==
Software can be cloned by reverse engineering or legal reimplementation from documentation or other sources, or by observing a program&#x27;s appearance and behavior. The reasons for software cloning may include circumventing undesirable licensing fees, acquiring knowledge about the features of the system or creating an interoperable alternative for an unsupported platform. GNU, a clone of UNIX, was motivated by a need of the free software movement for an operating system composed of entirely free software.

In the United States, the case of &quot;Lotus v. Borland&quot; allows the functionality of a program to be cloned so long as copyright in the code and interface is not infringed.

Yet, the public interface may also be subject to copyright to the extent that it contains expression (such as the appearance of an icon). For example, in August 2012, Electronic Arts, via its Maxis division, put forth a lawsuit against Zynga, claiming that its Facebook game, &quot;The Ville&quot;, was a direct clone of EA&#x27;s own Facebook game, &quot;The Sims Social&quot;. The lawsuit challenges that &quot;The Ville&quot; not only copies the gameplay mechanics of &quot;The Sims Social&quot;, but also uses art and visual interface aspects that appear to be inspired by &quot;The Sims Social&quot;. The two companies settled out of court on undisclosed terms in February 2013.

Examples of software cloning include the ReactOS project which tries to clone Microsoft Windows, and GNU Octave, which treats incompatibility with MathWorks MATLAB as a bug.

===Video games ===
Since the start of the video game industry, clones of successful concepts and games have been common. The first influential first-person shooter, &quot;Doom&quot;, led in the 1990s to the creation of a new genre dubbed as &quot;Doom&quot; clones. In the 2000s, the open world action-adventure &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; inspired the creation of many &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; clones.

===Software remakes===

Remakes of software are revivals of old, obsolete, or discontinued software.

A good share of software remakes are fangames of computer games and game engine recreation made by the fan community as part of retrogaming, to address e.g. compatibility issues or non-availability of the original, e.g. a shutdown server gets substituted with a server emulator.

Since the 2000s there has been an increasing number of commercial remakes of classical games by the original developer or publisher for current platforms as the digital distribution lowers the investment risk for niche releases. When enhanced in some way (audio, graphics, etc.) new releases might be called &quot;high definition&quot; release or &quot;special edition&quot;; an example is &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition&quot;.

== Other uses of the term==
===Databases===
A database clone is a complete and separate copy of a database system that includes the business data, the database management system software and any other application tiers that make up the environment. Cloning is a different kind of operation to replicate and backup, in that the cloned environment is both fully functional and separate in its own right. Additionally, the cloned environment may be modified at its inception due to configuration changes or data subsetting.

===Desktop===

Since 2010, clone computing, in the sense of replicating a session on a host computer in a virtual instance in the cloud, has been introduced. This allows the user to have access to a copy of their PC&#x27;s desktop on any other computing device such as a tablet computer, a personal computer running any operating system, WebOS, smartphones, etc.

The clone computer replicates, runs, and is always available through a series of cloud servers. Unlike remote management software, clone computing has no dependency on the host computer.

===Disk cloning software===

Disk cloning is the process of copying the contents of one computer hard drive to another disk or to an &quot;image&quot; file. Typically, the contents of the first disk are written to an image file as an intermediate step, and the second disk is loaded with the contents of the image. A cloned drive can replace the original, rather than simply containing backup copies of files.

Cloning software replicates the operating system, drives, software and patches of one computer for a variety of purposes, including setting up multiple computers, hard drive upgrades, and system recovery in the event of disk failure or corruption.

===Programming===

In computer programming, particularly object-oriented programming, &quot;cloning&quot; refers to object copying by a method or copy factory function, often called codice_1 or codice_2, as opposed to by a copy constructor. Cloning is polymorphic, in that the type of the object being cloned need not be specified, in contrast to using a copy constructor, which requires specifying the type (in the constructor call).

<doc id="874125" wikidata="Q2138894" url="?curid=874125" title="Montreal Machine">
<text>The Montreal Machine were the sole Canadian (and non-U.S.-based North American) team in the World League of American Football (WLAF), a springtime developmental professional league set up by the National Football League (NFL) that played in 1991 and 1992. There were also three European teams and six United States–based teams. Like all WLAF teams, the Machine played American rules football, 11 players per side on a 100-yard-long/-yard-wide field, rather than Canadian rules football of 12 players per side on a 110-yard-long/65-yard-wide field.

The Machine filled a void created by the folding of the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Montreal Alouettes in 1987. It was the first American football team in Canada since the Montreal Beavers, Toronto Rifles and Victoria Steelers, which all played in the Continental Football League in 1967. The NFL had also played two international preseason games in Montreal in 1988 and 1990 during the Alouettes&#x27; absence.

After two years, the Machine, and the entire WLAF, were put on &quot;hiatus&quot; by the NFL. In 1995, the three European-based franchises (and three more) were reconstituted as the World League (later known as NFL Europe); the North American teams were folded, thus becoming a purely European league. The Machine played their home games at Olympic Stadium in Montreal, which also hosted what would be the WLAF&#x27;s last game in its original incarnation, World Bowl &#x27;92. A crowd of 43,789 watched the Sacramento Surge defeat the Orlando Thunder, 21–17.

The Machine&#x27;s average game attendance was 31,888 in their first year of play, well above the league average and above expectations. It dropped to 25,254 in their second (and final) year, still in line with league average.

The end of the WLAF&#x27;s North American operations was soon followed by the CFL commencing its own U.S. expansion experiment, which lasted for three seasons. The subsequent demise of the CFL&#x27;s U.S. teams coincided with pro football&#x27;s return to Montreal in 1996 when the third and current incarnation of the Montreal Alouettes commenced play. The Alouettes had been revived by the owners of the Baltimore Stallions, the most successful of the CFL&#x27;s American franchises, who upon shuttering their U.S.-based team relocated their football organization to Montreal.

<doc id="874128" wikidata="Q545438" url="?curid=874128" title="Tina Sinatra">
<text>Christina Sinatra (born June 20, 1948) is an American businesswoman, producer, talent agent, actress, singer and author. She is the daughter of Frank Sinatra.

==Early life==
Christina Sinatra was born on June 20, 1948, in Los Angeles, California, the youngest child of American singer and actor Frank Sinatra and his first wife, Nancy Barbato Sinatra. She has two siblings, Nancy and Frank Jr.. Her parents divorced when she was three years old.

==Career==
Sinatra never wished to be a singer like her father and siblings, but she took acting classes with Jeff Corey and appeared with Hampton Fancher in the 1969 television miniseries &quot;Romeo und Julia 70&quot; in Germany, where she lived for several years. After returning to the United States, she took more classes with Corey, and appeared in episodes of &quot;Adam-12&quot;, &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;, &quot;McCloud&quot;, and &quot;Mannix&quot;.

Despite her hesitance to sing, Sinatra appeared on the album &quot;The Sinatra Family Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot; with her father and siblings in 1968. She contributed to five tracks on the album, including &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming to Town&quot; and a duet on &quot;O Bambino (One Cold and Blessed Winter)&quot;, with her sister. Tina also appeared with her siblings on an episode of Dean Martin&#x27;s television show with Martin&#x27;s children. She was present at many of her father&#x27;s recording sessions, including the session for the hit &quot;My Way&quot;. 

In her memoir, she wrote of her acting career that she lacked the ambition and confidence to become an actress. Sinatra remained in the entertainment industry, becoming a theatrical agent under Arnold Stiefel, and once represented Robert Blake. At her father’s request, in the 1970s, she began to take charge of parts of the elder Sinatra’s career. Upon her father&#x27;s death, Tina took control of Frank Sinatra&#x27;s film and music legacy.

An occasional film producer, she also appeared in the television movie &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; (1977), which became the pilot for the long-running TV series of the same title. She was executive producer of the 1992 television miniseries &quot;Sinatra&quot;. She was also a producer of the 2004 remake of her father&#x27;s 1962 film &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;. A lead actor in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, Frank Sinatra owned the film&#x27;s legal distribution rights until his death.

Sinatra published the memoir &quot;My Father&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in 2000, co-written with Jeff Coplon.

==Personal life==
In June 1970, Sinatra announced her engagement to actor Robert Wagner. They broke up in January 1972.

On January 26, 1974, Sinatra married musician Wes Farrell at her father&#x27;s apartment at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. They divorced on September 3, 1976.

On January 30, 1981, Sinatra married Richard M Cohen. They divorced on January 11, 1983.

Sinatra had a long-term relationship with actor James Farentino and secured a restraining order against him in 1994.

She started a petition in favor of the construction of the Beverly Hills Community Dog Park in Beverly Hills in 2015.

<text>José Omar Pastoriza (23 May 1942 – 2 August 2004) was a football player and manager. A midfielder, he played for Independiente, AS Monaco, and the Argentina national team. As a manager, he managed the Venezuela national team among other teams.

==Playing career==
&quot;El Pato&quot; (&quot;The Duck&quot;) Pastoriza was born in Rosario, and started his career in Rosario Central, but gained renown with Colón de Santa Fe. He moved to Racing Club, but was transferred to rival Independiente after 53 matches due to a poor team performance and the precarious economic situation. He stayed six years with Independiente, winning three first division tournaments and a Copa Libertadores. In 1971, he was awarded the Olimpia de Oro, which is given to the Argentine footballer of the year.

After the 1972 season he transferred to Ligue 1 AS Monaco, where he retired as a player.

==Coaching career==
Having good relations with players, &quot;El Pato&quot; Patoriza coached the a number of clubs in Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, Bolivia and Spain, as well as the El Salvador and Venezuela national teams. Pastoriza began his managerial career in 1976 with Independiente, the club where he won another three national leagues, another Libertadores Cup and the Intercontinental Cup in 1984. He also worked as the manager of Talleres de Córdoba on many occasions. He had a single stint as manager of several Argentine clubs such as Racing Club, Boca Juniors and Argentinos Juniors.

Pastoriza&#x27;s first foreign appointment was in 1982, at the Colombian Club Deportivo Los Millonarios. He was manager of Brazilian team Fluminense (1985) before returning to Argentina.

In 1992, he worked as manager of the Spanish Atlético Madrid, and in 1994 he worked with Bolivian Club Bolívar. Pastoriza served as the coach of the El Salvador national team between 1995 and 1996 and as the coach of Venezuela between 1998 and 2000.

In 2004, he died in Buenos Aires during his fifth stint as manager of Independiente. He had a heart attack at his apartment, and the emergency doctors could not save him. Pastoriza had a history of health problems, but kept smoking anyway. The funeral was performed at the Independiente headquarters.

Jairo Castillo, player of Independiente, was repeatedly booked by the referee in later games for removing his shirt to reveal tributes to Pastoriza. As a result, it was decided to add Pastoriza&#x27;s nickname &quot;Pato&quot; to the official Independiente kit in 2004.

<doc id="874136" wikidata="Q880351" url="?curid=874136" title="Henry Markham">
<text>Henry Harrison Markham (November 16, 1840October 9, 1923) was an American lawyer and Republican politician. He was the 18th governor of California (1891–1895), and represented California&#x27;s 6th congressional district during the 49th United States Congress (1885–1887). Earlier in life, he served as a Union Army officer in the American Civil War.

== Early life ==
Markham was born in Wilmington, New York, on November 16, 1840. He attended the common schools of his hometown and Wheeler&#x27;s Academy in Vermont. He moved to Wisconsin in 1861.

== Career ==
During the Civil War, Markham enlisted as a private in Company G, 32nd Wisconsin Infantry Regiment; he was promoted to second lieutenant. Markham was part of General William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea in 1864. He was wounded at the Battle of Rivers&#x27; Bridge in 1865, and discharged.

After the war Markham returned to Wisconsin and settled in Milwaukee, where he studied law and passed the bar in 1867. He practiced law in Milwaukee in the state and federal courts. In 1879, Markham moved to Pasadena, California and continued the practice of law.

Markham was elected as a Republican to the 49th Congress in 1884, but declined to seek renomination in 1886.

He was elected governor of California in 1890 and inaugurated in January 1891. During his term, California&#x27;s economy suffered badly from the Panic of 1893. Hoping to boost economic recovery, Markham strongly backed the California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894, held in San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park; it was a resounding success. Markham declined to seek a second term as governor in 1894.

In Pasadena Markham was on the school board and was one of the founders of the Pasadena public library. He was also part of the Calico Union Mining Company. During his run for governor he was referred to as &quot;the dashing colonel from Pasadena,&quot; and he was a longtime member of the Pasadena Republican Club.

== Personal life ==
On May 17, 1876, Markham married Mary A. Dana in Waukesha, Wisconsin. He purchased a 23-acre ranch in Pasadena, California, and he and his family moved there in 1879. They had five daughters: Marie, Alice, Gertrude, Genevieve, and Hildreth.

On October 9, 1923, Markham died in his Pasadena home at age 82. He was interred at Mountain View Cemetery in Altadena.

<doc id="874137" wikidata="Q807916" url="?curid=874137" title="Barcelona Dragons (NFL Europe)">
<text>The Barcelona Dragons were an American football team that was a part of the World League of American Football and later in the resurrected NFL Europe. Their home field in Barcelona was the Estadi Olímpic de Montjuic, the 1992 Olympic Stadium, and later the Mini Estadi.

The Dragons were successful on the field, making it to 4 World Bowls (1991, 1997, 1999, 2001) and winning World Bowl V in 1997.

==History==
The team was made part of the FC Barcelona organization in 2002 as the &quot;FC Barcelona Dragons&quot;, which saw them move mid-season from the city&#x27;s Olympic stadium to FC Barcelona&#x27;s second stadium, the Mini Estadi, with its capacity of 15,276.

Despite these efforts, the franchise&#x27;s fan support decreased and the team began to struggle financially. After the 2003 season, the Dragons were discontinued and they were replaced in the league by the Cologne Centurions.
For the entire duration of the Dragons&#x27; history they had only one head coach, &quot;Cowboy&quot; Jack Bicknell. His nickname was translated by his adoptive city to &quot;El Caballero&quot; (with its additional connotations of &quot;Knight&quot; or &quot;Gentleman&quot; in Spanish).

From 1991 to 2002, Seymour &quot;Red&quot; Kelin was responsible for Defensive Coordinating duties. Bicknell and Kelin had been coaching together since their days at Boston College, where they helped lead the Eagles to a Cotton Bowl Classic victory in 1984.

In 2021, an unrelated entity of the same name was founded to participate in the inaugural season of the new European League of Football. This new team has announced the Estadi Municipal de Reus as their home field for their participation in this new league.

==Season-by-season==
The Dragons lost the inaugural World Bowl 21–0 to the London Monarchs in 1991. The game was played at Wembley Stadium in front of more than 60,000 fans.

That was to be the first of four World Bowl appearances for the Dragons, with the second bringing their first success in 1997. In an extremely tight group stage that year, the Dragons finished second with a .500 record, and then beat Rhein Fire 38–24 in the final.

That would prove to be the Dragons&#x27; only trophy, but they made it to the World Bowl twice more, losing 38–24 to Frankfurt Galaxy in 1999, and 24–17 to Berlin Thunder in 2001. In both years they had finished top of the regular season standings.

<doc id="874140" wikidata="Q387796" url="?curid=874140" title="Henry T. Gage">
<text>Henry Tifft Gage (December 25, 1852 – August 28, 1924) was an American lawyer, politician and diplomat. A Republican, Gage was elected to a single term as the 20th governor of California from 1899 to 1903. Gage was also the U.S. Minister to Portugal for several months in 1910.

==Biography==
Gage was born on Christmas Day, 1852 in Geneva, New York. Relocating with his family to East Saginaw, Michigan, he spent his teenage years in Michigan, studying law with his lawyer father. In 1873 at the age of 21, Gage was admitted to the Michigan Bar, working for his father&#x27;s law practice in East Saginaw for over a year. Over a year later, Gage relocated to California, settling in Los Angeles. Between 1874 and 1877, Gage was a successful sheep dealer, selling sheep to various farms around Los Angeles County. In 1877, Gage returned to law, opening his own practice. Largely successful in court, his practice quickly began to attract a number of prominent corporate clients in Southern California, including the Southern Pacific Railroad, who would enjoy a decades-long relationship with Gage. Three years later, Gage married Francesca V. Rains, a great-granddaughter of a Californio family. The Gages settled in Bell Gardens at his wife&#x27;s family home.

Running as a Republican, Gage was elected as Los Angeles City Attorney in 1881, beginning a slow rise within party ranks. At the 1888 Republican National Convention in Chicago, Gage was chosen as a delegate-at-large during the proceedings. In a speech to the convention, Gage seconded the motion to nominate Levi P. Morton as the party&#x27;s nomination for the vice presidency.

In 1891, President Benjamin Harrison appointed Gage as a federal prosecutor to prosecute the crew of the Chilean steamer &quot;Itata&quot; due to the &quot;Itata&quot; Incident. The U.S. federal government charged the crew with knowingly assisting an illegal arms purchase. Its cargo had consisted of weapons purchased for National Congressional insurgent forces fighting in the 1891 Chilean Civil War against President José Manuel Balmaceda. Upon review of the federal government&#x27;s case, Gage dropped all charges against &quot;Itata&#x27;s&quot; crew, claiming that the government had mistaken the arms purchase as illegal.

By 1898, Gage had become a prominent corporate lawyer within Los Angeles business circles, as well as a successful owner of real estate, particularly the Red Rover gold mine in Acton in the Santa Clarita Valley. At the state Republican convention that year, Gage was chosen in the first round of voting as the party&#x27;s nominee for the governorship. His nomination was largely orchestrated by the Southern Pacific Railroad, who had worked with Gage since the 1870s, and saw him as supportive of their interests.

In the 1898 California gubernatorial election, Gage defeated his Democratic rival, U.S. Representative James G. Maguire by 6.7%. Other minor candidates in the election included Job Harriman of the Socialist Labor Party of America and Prohibitionist J.E. McComas, a former State Senator.

==Governorship==

Gage was inaugurated as the 20th governor of California on January 4, 1899. In his inauguration speech, Gage spoke at length about foreign policy, viewing with favor the recent results of the Spanish–American War and their effect on California&#x27;s economy. &quot;The peaceful acquisition of the Hawaiian Islands, extending our empire beyond our Pacific shore, should be followed as a political necessity by the annexation of the Philippines,&quot; Gage stated. &quot;The center of commerce must move westward. California, favorably situated, will, among other advantages, reap the harvest of trade with these new territories, developing our many varied and growing resources, creating a western merchant marine for the carriage of our imports and exports, and luring to our markets the nations of the world.&quot;

In one of his first acts, Gage&#x27;s administration reopened the State Printing Office, which had been closed down by Governor James Budd to cut governmental expenditures.

From early on in his administration, Gage was highly partisan, mostly because of frequent accusations from Reform Republicans and Democrats alike who accused Gage as being a pawn for the Southern Pacific. When a newspaper published a political cartoon portraying railroad tycoon Collis Potter Huntington leading the governor around on a leash, Gage was so incensed by the accusation that he ramrodded a censorship bill through the California State Legislature, restricting the press whenever editorial content involved politics or politicians.

===San Francisco bubonic plague outbreak===

On January 3, 1900, Gage held a legislative session to discuss ways to improve San Francisco&#x27;s port in attempt to increase trading with Asia. He also wanted to bring back the State Quarantine Service which had recently been removed. The federal Marine Hospital Service on Angel Island was responsible for the inspection of all incoming ships and preventing all foreign diseases from coming into California. Reintroduction of the State Quarantine Service would provide Gage with more oversight and ability to minimize threats of quarantine. However, the session was adjourned before any action upon the request could take place. From 1900 onwards, Gage&#x27;s administration was often rocky. That year, the ship &quot;Australia&quot; laid anchor in the Port of San Francisco, unknowingly bringing to the city rats carrying the Third Pandemic of the bubonic plague. The disease soon made home in the cramped ghetto quarters of the city&#x27;s Chinatown. Rumors of the plague&#x27;s presence abounded in the city, quickly gaining the notice of authorities from the federal Marine Hospital Service, including the Marine Hospital Service&#x27;s head in San Francisco, Joseph J. Kinyoun.

Allied with powerful railroad and city business interests, Gage publicly denied the existence of any pestilence outbreak in the city, fearing that any word of the plague&#x27;s presence would deeply damage the city and state&#x27;s economy. Supportive newspapers, such as the &quot;San Francisco Call&quot;, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;San Francisco Bulletin&quot;, echoed Gage&#x27;s denials, beginning what was to become an intense defamation campaign against Joseph Kinyoun, director of the San Francisco Quarantine Station. In response to the state&#x27;s refuting of the plague&#x27;s existence, U.S. Surgeon General Walter Wyman recommended to federal Treasury Secretary Lyman J. Gage (no relation to the governor) to intervene. Secretary Gage agreed, creating a three-man medical commission to medically investigate the city. The commission conclusively discovered that bubonic plague was present.

Like Kinyoun, the Treasury commission&#x27;s findings were again immediately denounced by Governor Gage. Gage believed the federal government&#x27;s growing presence in the matter was a gross intrusion of what he recognized as a state concern. In his retaliation, Gage denied the federal commission any use of the University of California, Berkeley&#x27;s laboratories to further study the outbreak. The &quot;Bulletin&quot; would also attack the federal commission, branding it as a &quot;youthful and inexperienced trio&quot;.

The clash between Gage and federal authorities intensified. Surgeon General Wyman instructed Kinyoun to place Chinatown under quarantine, as well as blocking all East Asians from entering state borders. Upon hearing Kinyoun&#x27;s announcement, Gage sent telegrams and spread the word to California&#x27;s elected officials, party leaders, and even delegates of the National Convention. He encouraged them to speak with the President about cancelling the quarantine and removing Kinyoun from his duties. This event along with the help of San Francisco newspapers sparked the campaign to remove and discredit Kinyoun. Chinese residents, supported by Gage and local businesses, fought the quarantine through numerous federal court battles, claiming the Marine Hospital Service was violating their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, and in the process, launched lawsuits against Kinyoun. In these court proceedings, residents insisted Gage was correct in his denials of the plague outbreak. The courts initially agreed that Chinatown residents were correct in that the quarantine violated their civil rights, yet most of these lawsuits were eventually thrown out of court on later dates.

Between 1901 and 1902, the plague outbreak continued to worsen. On January 8, 1901, Gage pushed to allow the state health board members to delegate the local health units in attempt to monitor and control cases regarding the plague. In a 1901 address to both houses of the California State Legislature, Gage accused federal authorities, particularly Kinyoun, of injecting bubonic plague into cadavers. In response to what he said to be massive scaremongering by the Marine Hospital Service, Gage pushed a censorship bill through the legislature to gag any media reports of plague infection. The legislation failed, yet laws to gag reports amongst the medical community succeeded in passage and were signed into law by the governor. In addition, $100,000 was allocated to a public campaign led by Gage to deny the plague&#x27;s existence. Privately, however, Gage sent a special commission to Washington, consisting of Southern Pacific, newspaper and shipping lawyers to negotiate a settlement with the Marine Hospital Service, whereby the federal government would remove Kinyoun from San Francisco with the promise that the state would secretly cooperate with the Marine Hospital Service in stamping out the plague outbreak.

Secret cooperations included preventive measures such as inspection, isolation and disinfection. Gage and Mayor Phelan provided funding to inspect and disinfect Chinatown of any signs of the plague. To the public, however, this was marketed as a cleanup campaign that was renovating and getting rid of the town&#x27;s filth. Despite the secret agreement allowing for Kinyoun&#x27;s removal, Gage went back on his promise of assisting federal authorities and continued to obstruct their efforts for study and quarantine. A report issued by the State Board of Health on September 16, 1901, bolstered Gage&#x27;s claims, denying the plague&#x27;s outbreak.

===Labor agitation===
As Gage fought his growing battle with the federal government, labor agitation was starting to spill over along the San Francisco waterfront. In July 1901, members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters went on strike, protesting against recent orders to haul luggage for a non-unionized cargo company. The Teamsters strike was quickly joined by sympathizing sailors, stevedores and fireman belonging to the City Front Federation. Between 10,000 and 16,000 men joined the strike.

Employers grew quickly frustrated with the strikers, asking for San Francisco Mayor James D. Phelan to request Gage in ordering in the state militia to crush the strike. Phelan refused, though violence between strikers and officers of the San Francisco Police Department began to break out in September.

Gage became increasingly concerned that violence along San Francisco&#x27;s waterfront was spilling out of the city&#x27;s control. On one instance, in order to reassure himself that violence was not increasing, Gage disguised himself as a striker and walked amongst the stevedores to observe conditions personally. In October, Gage negotiated settlement with employers and the Teamsters, though the terms of the settlement were never made publicly known. Gage was the first California governor to negotiate an end to a labor strike.

===End of administration===
Gage&#x27;s troubles over the bubonic plague continued to worsen. Despite San Francisco-based newspapers continual denials, contradicting reports from the &quot;Sacramento Bee&quot; and the &quot;Associated Press&quot; on the plague&#x27;s spread had made the outbreak become publicly known throughout the United States. The state governments of Colorado, Texas and Louisiana passed quarantines of California, arguing that since the state had refused to admit a health crisis within its borders, states receiving rail or shipping cargo from California ports of call had the duty to protect themselves. Threats of a national quarantine grew.

As the 1902 elections approached, Southern Pacific supporters increasingly saw Gage, a man who had represented their interests since his days as a Los Angeles-based lawyer, as an embarrassment to state Republicans. This harmed Gage whose allies were mostly business interests. However, instead of putting allegations of the outbreak to rest, conflicting studies and reports from federal officials and the media continued to contradict Gage&#x27;s assertions. In turn, the powerful shipping and rail companies within the state and throughout the country faced quarantine and economic boycotts from other states.

At the state Republican convention that year, the Railroad Republican faction refused Gage renomination for the governorship. In his place, former Mayor of Oakland George Pardee, a German-trained physician, received the nomination. Pardee&#x27;s nomination was largely a compromise between the Railroad and the growing progressive-minded Reform factions of the party.

In his final address to the California State Legislature in early January 1903, Gage continued to publicly deny the outbreak, blaming the federal government, in particular Joseph Kinyoun, the Marine Hospital Service and the San Francisco Board of Health, for damaging the state&#x27;s economy.

==Post governorship==
After leaving Sacramento, Gage returned to Los Angeles to resume his law practice. In 1909, President William Howard Taft appointed Gage as U.S. Minister to Portugal. Gage served in Lisbon for a little more than five months until November 1910. Political instability in Portugal, due to the Revolution of 1910 that deposed King Manuel II, as well as his wife&#x27;s deteriorating health, forced Gage to submit his resignation to the U.S. Department of State and President Taft. He returned to California shortly afterwards.

Gage died in Los Angeles on August 28, 1924, at the age of 71.

==Legacy==
Despite his administration being characterized by historians as both rocky and incompetent, a lasting legacy of Gage&#x27;s tenure of office was his signing off on the establishment of California Polytechnic State University in 1901.

In 1902, Gage appointed Ulysses S. Webb as California Attorney General. Webb became one of the most successful attorneys general in the history of California and its longest-serving (37 years, until his retirement in 1939).

Gage Avenue in Los Angeles was named after the former governor on October 28, 1929. Henry T. Gage Middle School, located on Gage Avenue, also is named after him.

The Henry Gage Mansion is a California Historic Landmark (No. 984), given the designation on May 26, 1989. Located in Bell Gardens, the Gage Mansion, built in 1795, is the oldest remaining home in Los Angeles County.

<text>The Napoleonic Wars continued in 1801 with the French bringing the war against the Second Coalition to a close.

By 16 January, the Austrians signed the Armistice of Treviso in Italy. On 9 February, they signed the Treaty of Lunéville, ending the war on the continent. The war against the United Kingdom continued (with Neapolitan harbours closed to her by the Treaty of Florence, signed on 28 March). A British expedition landed in Egypt in March, fighting the Battle of Abukir, the Battle of Alexandria and laying siege to Alexandria. The French surrender there on 2 September ended their campaign in Egypt and Syria which had begun in 1798.

The naval war also continued, with the United Kingdom maintaining a blockade of France by sea. Russia, Prussia, Denmark, and Sweden formed the Second League of Armed Neutrality to prevent their shipping from being searched by the Royal Navy. British Admiral Horatio Nelson attacked the Danish fleet in harbor at the Battle of Copenhagen, destroying much of the fleet of one of France&#x27;s more steady allies during the period. An armistice prevented him from continuing into the Baltic Sea to attack the Russian fleet at Reval (Tallinn). Meanwhile, off Gibraltar, the outnumbered French squadron under Linois rebuffed a first British attack under Saumarez in the first battle of Algeciras, capturing a line-of-battle ship. In the second battle of Algeciras, four days later, the British captured a French ship and sank two Spanish, killing around 2000 mostly Spanish seamen for the loss of 12 British.

<doc id="874148" wikidata="Q546970" url="?curid=874148" title="George Pardee">
<text>George Cooper Pardee (July 25, 1857 – September 1, 1941) was an American doctor of medicine and Republican politician. As the 21st governor of California, holding office from January 7, 1903, to January 9, 1907, Pardee was the second native-born Californian to assume the governorship, after Romualdo Pacheco, and the first governor born in California after statehood.

==Biography==
Pardee was born on July 25, 1857, in San Francisco, California, the only child of Enoch H. Pardee and Mary Pardee. The Pardee family was well known in the San Francisco Bay Area. His father was a prominent oculist in San Francisco and Oakland. Enoch&#x27;s stature within the community helped him get elected to the California State Assembly in the early 1870s, and later as the mayor of Oakland for a single term from 1876 to 1878.

Raised in the Pardee Home in Oakland, George Pardee closely followed in his father&#x27;s medical background. He attended the nearby University of California, Berkeley, then studied medicine at the Cooper Medical College in San Francisco. In 1885, Pardee traveled abroad to receive his medical degree at the University of Leipzig in the German Empire. After his return from Germany, Pardee joined his father&#x27;s medical practice, specializing in eye and ear diseases.
Like his father, Enoch, Pardee also developed an early interest in politics. By the early 1890s, Pardee had become an active member of the Republican Party, and was elected to the Oakland Board of Health and the Oakland City Council. In 1893, following a successful election, Pardee became the 29th mayor of Oakland, serving a single two-year term until 1895. During his mayoralship, Pardee began a public battle with the Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s ownership of the Port of Oakland. At one point, Pardee kicked down a piece of the port&#x27;s fence erected by the Southern Pacific out of anger.

== Governorship ==
During the San Francisco plague of 1900–1904, Pardee&#x27;s quick rise in East Bay politics was noticed by the state Republican leadership prior to the 1902 general elections. Deeply embarrassed and financially hurt by the denials of an ongoing bubonic plague outbreak in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown by Governor Henry Gage, Republicans withdrew their support of Gage during the state convention. The party, divided by Railroad Republicans with the backing of the Southern Pacific Railroad and Reform Republicans of the growing Progressive movement, nominated Pardee, due to his municipal and medical background, as a compromise candidate. Despite clashes in the past with their interests, Southern Pacific Republicans believed Pardee the better candidate against the Democratic contender Franklin K. Lane, a San Francisco City Attorney and an ardent anti-Southern Pacific campaigner.

In the 1902 general elections, Pardee faced a four-way race between the Democrats&#x27; Lane, Socialist Gideon Brower and Prohibitionist Theodore Kanouse. Pardee barely edged over Lane, winning the governorship with a plurality of 0.9%. Less than 3,000 votes separated the two leading candidates.

== San Francisco Bubonic Plague ==
Pardee took office on January 7, 1903. At the start of his term, Pardee did not fully acknowledge the presence of plague in San Francisco. Preceding his inauguration, the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service act was created by Congress on July 1, 1902. This act established that state health officials could initiate a surgeon general call conference, upon request. Due to the uncertainty and fear of the plague, a conference call was requested by eleven states to discuss the plague situation in California. In response, Walter Wyman, Surgeon General, called for a conference to be held on January 19, 1903, at Washington, D.C. Under the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service law, each state had to send one state health board representative to a surgeon general call conference. The problem for California was that the state health board officers, previously headed by former governor, Henry Gage, strongly denied the presence of the plague. In efforts to rectify this dilemma, Surgeon Arthur H. Glennan from the U.S Public Health Service was tasked with working with the new governor, Pardee. With his efforts, Matthew Gardner, former surgeon-in-chief of Southern Pacific Railroad, was selected to represent California at the conference.

San Francisco was the heart of trade and commerce. Due to plague rumors, San Francisco commercial circles were alarmed by the advances of the Northwestern Railway and Northern Pacific Railways success. During this time, Northwestern Railway and Northern Pacific Railways wanted to divert commerce towards the western states. A preliminary meeting was held on January 18, 1903, a day before the conference call. Other state health officials that attended were hostile to Gardner, believing that California health officials were interested more in railroad business. Gardner acknowledged the presence of plague and promised to provide statements from Pardee and San Francisco Mayor Eugene Schmitz, promising to undertake a sanitary campaign and eradication. Pardee promised to fulfill all the conditions the officials wanted. But the officials did not take his promise into consideration and voted to change the location troop transport from San Francisco. On the day of the conference call, Wyman discussed inspection results, revealing no detection of plague. But he also did acknowledge it was not fully eradicated. Many health officials were not happy with this answer and proposed two plans. The first plan pertained to the federal support system, which Wyman objected to. The second plan suggested placing embargoes on California borders, where railroads entered, if health officials were not actively participating in plague eradication. This conference concluded the presence of bubonic plague in California and blamed Governor Henry Gage and his state health board for his negligence in acknowledging and eradicating plague. Wyman, after the conference, firmly stated that acknowledging plague would not affect trade. In hopes to avoid a quarantine, Gardner urged Pardee to recognize bubonic plague in San Francisco.

Pardee had won the governor election by a narrow margin. He feared that acknowledging the plague would divide the already split Republican Party. Shortly after his inauguration, Pardee and Glennan met privately. He readily supported the U.S. Public Health Service and agreed to remove state inspectors in Chinatown. Pardee also complied to the resolutions established at the conference. But he continued to avoid directly addressing the presence of plague. He stated any disease regardless of plague required sanitary control. Wyman believed Pardee&#x27;s stance did not reassure the country health officials and urged Glennan to address the issue again with Pardee and Mayor Schmitz. He believed that acknowledging the presence of plague would ease health officials and foreign countries&#x27; fear. Pardee continued to elude the topic of plague but continued to work with the government. On the other hand, Schmitz continued to deny plague existence. The unrest caused by the government and San Francisco Health Board lead to Mexico and Australia to ban San Francisco goods. This ban encouraged more cooperation with Seattle and Vancouver. San Francisco businesses established the Mercantile Joint Committee to promote sanitary and preventive measures, in an effort to prove that plague did not exist. The Mercantile Joint Committee were concerned that officially admitting plague would result in a quarantine, leading to decreased trade and commerce. Merchants continued to ignore Wyman, who was still adamant about officially acknowledging plague. Finally, Glennan stated that if there was no official address regarding plague, the U.S Public Health Service would withdraw from San Francisco. This forced the Mercantile Joint Committee to formally admit that there had been ninety three plague cases over the span of 3 years. They also asked for the support from Schmitz and Pardee to officially admit that there was no current risk or danger from plague. Schmitz was the first to sign this document. Pardee, who was resistant to this, eventually signed it. With this in place, Wyman reported that there were no new outbreaks of plague since December 1902 and Chinatown had met satisfactory sanitary conditions to business leaders. This news encouraged Mexico and other foreign countries to lift the embargoes. Under Pardee&#x27;s orders, new officials were appointed for the State Health Board. His administration was now focused on being transparent and would acknowledge all plague cases. Pardee welcomed health officials to visit California and provide input regarding sanitation and sanitary conditions. On September 8, the first California State, County, and Municipal Sanitary Conference was held in San Francisco. This first meeting was able to create a community where sanitary information and preventative measures could be shared. By the end of 1904, the plague had been brought under control. Nearly 200 deaths were attributed to the outbreak.

===Conservation and education===
 During his medical studies in the German Empire, Pardee was greatly influenced by Germany&#x27;s push for higher education and environmental conservation during its rapid industrialization. Throughout his administration, Pardee strongly supported irrigation projects and waterworks throughout the Central Valley with the desire of increasing the state&#x27;s agricultural output and providing safe drinking water from the Sierra Nevada.

Pardee&#x27;s progressive ideas regarding conservation and distrust of corporate monopolies quickly placed him as an ally of President Theodore Roosevelt. Both the governor and President Roosevelt enjoyed a good working relationship during their respective terms of office on the state and federal levels. On a visit to California in 1903, Pardee was asked by Roosevelt if he would be his running mate as Vice President for the 1904 presidential election. Pardee declined, instead continuing to take an active role in state politics. Both Pardee and Roosevelt remained political allies for the next decade.

Since 1901, proposals for a state agricultural school had undergone discussion within the California State Legislature, yet no proposal had gained a serious following. Most agricultural studies in the state during the period were concentrated at UC Berkeley, but due to the climate of Berkeley, most studies remained strictly limited to organic and soil chemistry study and analysis. In 1903, an agricultural bill sponsoring a state agricultural school to give first-hand experience for future farmers passed the legislature. Pardee vetoed the bill, explaining that he was not hostile to the idea of an agricultural school, but wanted a less vague proposal.

The Legislature drafted a more detailed bill, the University Farm Bill, in 1905. In it, the bill specified that a future state agricultural school would need a location already irrigated, with provisions for ideal soil and climatic conditions, as well as water and land rights. Pardee agreed, and signed the bill into law. For the next year, an agricultural commission sponsored by Pardee investigated more than fifty sites from Glenn County to Fresno. In 1906, Pardee announced that he decided upon Davisville in Yolo County, located nearly fifteen miles southwest of the state capital of Sacramento. Opened to students in 1908, the School of Agriculture quickly became one of the premier centers of agricultural study in the state. In 1959, the Regents of the University of California granted the school campus autonomy, designating it UC Davis.

The state of California&#x27;s forests also came under Pardee&#x27;s agenda. Shortly after the beginning of his administration, Pardee, with the help of Gifford Pinchot, ordered a joint state and federal commission to inspect and survey California&#x27;s forests. In 1905, a State Forestry Act was passed by the legislature and signed by the governor, creating a Board of Forestry to monitor and supervise logging, land usage, and forest fires. The act, along with Pinchot&#x27;s advocacy, helped influence President Roosevelt to transfer federal forest land over to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, later becoming the National Forest Service. Pardee&#x27;s own Board of Forestry would later evolve into the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

===1906 San Francisco earthquake===

In the early morning hours of April 18, 1906, a magnitude 7.7 to 8.3 earthquake struck along the San Andreas Fault, with an epicenter two miles (three km) from San Francisco, near Mussel Rock in neighboring San Mateo County. While cities as spread as Santa Rosa, San Jose and Palo Alto suffered considerable damage, San Francisco remained hardest hit, with resulting fires destroying much of the central core of the city.

As telegraphed reports slowly filtered into the Governor&#x27;s Office in Sacramento, Pardee mobilized the California Army National Guard to be dispatched to San Francisco, though Pardee was unaware that federal troops of the U.S. Army, under the command Brigadier General Frederick Funston, were already patrolling the streets.

Pardee sought to take command of the situation himself, traveling to his native Oakland in the later afternoon to oversee the state response to the disaster. Making his headquarters in Oakland Mayor Frank K. Mott&#x27;s office, Pardee worked twenty-hour days during the disaster, signing travel permission papers, coordinating state and federal relief funds and trains, and remaining in contact with the outside world through Oakland&#x27;s undamaged telegraph lines. In addition, Pardee also visited other afflicted cities, such as San Jose and Santa Rosa, to tour and coordinate their own disaster responses.

===Downfall===
Despite having been heavily praised by the public for his handling of the state bureaucracy during the 1906 disaster, Pardee continued to have a strained relationship with the Southern Pacific Railroad, one that had been ongoing since the 1890s while he was Mayor of Oakland. Pardee&#x27;s role in the burgeoning Progressive movement which distrusted large corporate monopolies, as well as his efforts to conserve and protect state forests, remained a constant thorn for Southern Pacific executives. A lengthy bitter battle over the Port of Oakland, which Pardee argued on behalf of Oakland that the port was a municipal rather than private corporation, dragged out for much of his governorship. The case was decided upon by the California Supreme Court in 1906, ruling in Oakland&#x27;s favor. Pardee also encouraged creation of new railroad companies to break the Southern Pacific&#x27;s monopolies.

At the state Republican convention in Santa Cruz to nominate the party&#x27;s candidate for the governorship in the 1906 general elections, Railroad Republicans led by party machine boss Abe Ruef, sought to strip Pardee of the nomination. Southern Pacific interests within the Republicans believed Pardee as too independent and troublesome. Writing in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; on September 1, 1906, Pardee commented that &quot;[I]t is evident that the Railroad machine and [Abe] Ruef did not want me to be governor again, and as they were in control of the convention, what kick have I coming?&quot;

Railroad Republicans, now dominating the Santa Cruz convention due to intense lobbying by Ruef, denied Pardee the nomination. Instead, Republicans and Southern Pacific supporters nominated U.S. House Representative James Gillett, a pro-railroad supporter. Pardee&#x27;s loss of the nomination sparked anger amongst many Progressive Republican circles, fueling desires for Progressives to reform the political nomination process or to break away from the Republicans altogether. In 1912, a party split occurred with the creation of the Bull Moose Party, led by Theodore Roosevelt and California Governor Hiram Johnson, who himself would lead Progressives to control the legislature and Governor&#x27;s Office throughout much of the 1910s.

In his farewell address to the California State Legislature in January 1907, Pardee demanded that the legislature take up calls for creating a direct primary law.

==Post-governorship==
Leaving the governorship in 1907, he returned to serve on many national and state boards, including the National Conservation Commission and the California Board of Forestry.

Pardee remained publicly active, returning to his native Oakland to become a co-founder of the state Bull Moose Party in 1912. In 1920, he was invited to become Commodore of the Oakland Yacht Club, a position he would enjoy again from 1925 to 1928. In the years following his governorship, Pardee lobbied intensely for a water district specifically for the East Bay. In 1921, the legislature passed the Municipal Utility District Act, and two years later, the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) was organized. Pardee would administer EBMUD from 1924 until shortly before his death in 1941.

In 1927, Oakland citizens awarded Pardee as a founding commissioner to the Port of Oakland due to his lengthy battle to remove the Southern Pacific monopoly over the waterfront.

Pardee died in Oakland on September 1, 1941, at the age of 84.

==Family==
Pardee met his future wife Helen N. Pardee at Oakland High School in the 1870s, graduating together in 1875. Helen was a school teacher, photographer, and art collector.

The Pardees had four daughters, Florence, Caroline, Madeline and Helen. Florence Pardee was killed in a car accident in 1910. Caroline Pardee died from the Spanish flu in 1920. Surviving daughters Madeline and Helen would continue to own and live in the family&#x27;s Pardee Home until Helen Pardee&#x27;s death in 1981. The Pardee Home opened as a public museum in 1991.

==Legacy==
Unlike his predecessor Henry Gage and his successor James Gillett, Pardee&#x27;s governorship has been generally well regarded amongst historians. His efforts of conservation and education have proved to be long standing, such as the creations of bodies that would later become UC Davis and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Despite their initial support of his nomination in 1902, Pardee&#x27;s near-constant resistance to the Southern Pacific Railroad has spared his reputation of criticism for being too close to rail monopolies. State historians from the California Secretary of State&#x27;s office wrote that between Gage, Pardee and Gillett, &quot;only Pardee can be considered an honest earnest administrator.&quot;

Environmental historian Philip L. Fradkin has cited Pardee as one of the unsung heroes of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. &quot;Pardee lacked a glamorous frontline role, and he was criticized for not dashing in the flame-licked streets. With a large staff imported from Sacramento, the governor was the expediter of paper; in every great disaster there needs to be at least one such competent bureaucrat.&quot;

Pardee was also the first governor to reside in the California Governor&#x27;s Mansion. The mansion would continue to be lived in by the state executive until the governorship of Ronald Reagan.

The Pardee Home, located in downtown Oakland, remains a tourist attraction in the center of the city, hosting tours and speaking events.

The Pardee Dam and the adjacent Pardee Reservoir along the Mokelumne River are named after the governor.

The old Governor&#x27;s Office within the California State Capitol is refurbished to appear as it did during the time of George Pardee&#x27;s governorship in 1906.

<text>Friend William Richardson (born William Richardson; December 1, 1865September 6, 1943) was an American newspaper publisher and politician. A member of the Progressive Party and later the Republican Party, Richardson was elected as the California State Treasurer from 1915 to 1923, and shortly afterwards as the 25th governor of California from 1923 to 1927. Richardson&#x27;s governorship marked a sharp reversal in policies from previous administrations, rolling back many of the Progressive reforms and state governmental agencies put in place by previous governors Hiram Johnson and William Stephens.

==Biography==
William Richardson was born in December 1865 to William and Rhoda Richardson at Friends Colony, Michigan, a Quaker township located outside of Ann Arbor. Early in his life, William legally changed his first name to &quot;Friend&quot;, the traditional Quaker greeting. In his young adult life, Richardson worked as a county clerk and law librarian, and following his move to San Bernardino, California, married Augusta Felder in 1891, with whom he had five children. Five years later, Richardson became the owner and newspaper editor of &quot;The San Bernardino Times Index&quot;.

In 1900, Richardson relocated to Berkeley where he purchased within a year &quot;The Berkeley Daily Gazette&quot; and became active in the California Press Association. Due to greater name recognition, Richardson was increasingly noticed by the state government. In 1901, Richardson was appointed as Superintendent of the State Printing Office with the consent of the California State Legislature and Governor Henry Gage. The Richardson family relocated to Sacramento where he assumed state printing responsibilities, while at the same time, continuing to own his newspapers in both San Bernardino and Berkeley.

In 1914, Richardson officially entered politics, running as a Progressive for California State Treasurer. Richardson easily defeated his Socialist and Prohibitionist rivals by a voting gap of 66 percent. Following the Progressive Party&#x27;s collapse, Richardson again won a second term as Treasurer in 1918, this time as a Republican, and again won a landslide victory against his Socialist and Prohibitionist rivals by garnering 78.2 percent of the vote.

After two successful terms as state treasurer, Richardson set his sights on the governorship as the Republican Party&#x27;s nominee in 1922. Running against incumbent William Stephens in the party&#x27;s primary election, Richardson campaigned on a conservative platform, capitalizing on electoral fatigue with Progressive-minded politics. The campaign worked, successfully defeating Governor Stephens and effectively returned the state Republican Party to a more conservative bent.

With Stephens out of the 1922 general election, Richardson faced Democrat Thomas L. Woolwine, the popular District Attorney of Los Angeles County. Amongst Richardson&#x27;s supporters in the election were the Ku Klux Klan (although California state Republican chairman A. E. Boynton repudiated these claims), which deeply opposed Woolwine&#x27;s Catholicism and was rumored to count Richardson as a member. His campaign manager in the election, California State Assemblyman Frank Merriam, would himself become governor in 1934. In the end, Richardson triumphed in the election, defeating Woolwine by nearly 24 percent of the vote.

==Governorship==
Richardson began his governorship on January 9, 1923, promising a no-frills administration to deeply cut governmental expenditures. Despite his past affiliation with the Progressive Party, Richardson blamed both the party and its Progressive movement with excess in his inaugural speech, replacing the Southern Pacific Railroad political machine with a Progressive machine. &quot;In 1911 the people did a good job of political house cleaning,&quot; Richardson spoke, alluding to Hiram Johnson and his Progressive majority in the Legislature. &quot;During the past few years another great political machine has come into power which has cost the people millions of dollars. It will be necessary to first wreck this political machine before the state can be put on an economical basis and the government again handed back to the people.&quot;

Richardson embarked on a program to eliminate &quot;unnecessary boards and officers, by consolidation, and by doing away with overlapping functions,&quot; calling it a massive waste of taxpayers’ money. In the preface to his proposed 1923 budget to the Legislature, Richardson declared his opposition to pork barrel politics and that &quot;[m]y chief burden has been to relieve the people of their great burden of taxation.&quot; In his various modifications to the state bureaucracy, Richardson appointed various individuals that were favorable to corporate interests.

An electoral backlash against his deep-rooted fiscal conservatism came during the 1924 legislative elections, when resurgent Progressives regained control of the California State Legislature, beginning a legislative bulwark against more proposed cuts to the state government and increased corporate influence. A proposal by Richardson to close two state universities, believing that education had become too costly for state coffers, was successfully defeated by the Progressives. Meanwhile, Richardson blocked the Progressives&#x27; passage of a bill in the Legislature to create a professional State Bar of California with a pocket veto in 1925.

As the Legislature and Richardson thwarted each other&#x27;s political agendas, the governor attended to other duties outside of the political realm. Richardson personally accompanied Swedish Prince Gustaf Adolf and Princess Louise Mountbatten on a portion of their tour through Southern California in 1926.

That same year, the increasingly embattled Richardson faced a crucial primary election. Growing anger at Richardson&#x27;s overly-conservative administration led to the progressive wing of the Republican Party supporting C. C. Young, the lieutenant governor under both William Stephens and Richardson. Young emerged victorious in the primary vote, depriving Richardson of the chance to run in the general election.

Defeated by his own party, Richardson left the governorship as his term expired on January 4, 1927. One accomplishment to his various eliminations and consolidations to the state government was a surplus of $20 million in the state treasury.

==Post-governorship==
Richardson returned to newspaper publishing, becoming the chief publisher of the &quot;Alameda Times Star&quot; in 1931. He became politically active again in the 1930s, though in appointed positions. He served as the State Building and Loan Commissioner under James Rolph from 1932 to 1934, and later as the State Superintendent of Banks from 1934 to 1939 under his former campaign manager in 1922, Frank Merriam. He retired from public life in 1939.

In July 1943, Richardson suffered a heart attack from which he never recovered, and died at his Berkeley home on September 6, 1943. His ashes are now interred at the Chapel of the Chimes in Oakland.

Throughout his life, Richardson was a member of the Freemasons, the Knights Templar, the Shriners, the Order of the Eastern Star, the Elks, the Kiwanis, the Moose, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, Rotary and the Woodmen.

<text>Frank Finley Merriam (December 22, 1865 – April 25, 1955) was an American Republican politician who served as the 28th governor of California from June 2, 1934, until January 2, 1939. Assuming the governorship at the height of the Great Depression following the death of Governor James Rolph, Merriam defeated Democratic nominee Upton Sinclair in the 1934 election. Merriam also served as the State Auditor of Iowa from 1900 to 1903, and served in both the Iowa and California state legislatures.

==Early years==
Merriam was born in 1865 in Hopkinton, Iowa, the eldest of 11 children. In 1861, his father Henry C. Merriam and uncle Charles E. Merriam enlisted in Company K, 12th Iowa Infantry. Both were captured at the Battle of Shiloh, held as prisoners of war at Libby Prison, and returned to Iowa.

After graduating from Lenox College at Hopkinton in 1888, Merriam served as the principal of the Hopkinton schools for two years and superintendent of schools at Postville for one year. He was a school superintendent in Wisner, Nebraska. He next became the editor of the &quot;Hopkinton Leader&quot;, a newspaper.

In 1904, he moved to Muskogee, Oklahoma, where he owned and published the &quot;Muskogee Evening Times&quot;. He moved to Long Beach, California in 1910 with his second wife, Nellie, to attend to family obligations. There he worked in the advertising department of the &quot;Long Beach Press&quot;.

==Iowa and California legislatures==

Merriam was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives as a Republican at the age of 31 in 1896. Two years later, Merriam was elected as Iowa State Auditor, a post he would hold until 1903. In 1910 at the age of 44, Merriam moved to California. Following seven years of living in the state, Merriam was elected to the California State Assembly in 1916, representing the Long Beach area, beginning his rise in California politics.

In 1922, while still serving in the Assembly, Merriam presided over the successful election campaign of former Bull Moose member and Republican candidate for governor Friend Richardson. Name recognition from Richardson&#x27;s successful campaign among fellow Republicans helped Merriam be elected by the Republican majority in the Assembly as its Speaker in 1923. During the 1926 general elections, Speaker Merriam ran as a primary candidate for lieutenant governor. However, state Republicans instead voted for Buron Fitts as the party&#x27;s candidate for that office.

Following his departure from the Assembly that year, Merriam took a two-year hiatus from state politics. He returned in the 1928 elections after he was elected to the California State Senate. After two years in that body, Merriam won the nomination for lieutenant governor and, along with the Republican candidate for governor, San Francisco Mayor James Rolph, was elected to office in the 1930 elections.

==Governor of California 1934–1939==
On June 2, 1934, Governor Rolph was pronounced dead of heart failure at Riverside Farm in Santa Clara County. Upon the news of the Governor&#x27;s death, Lieutenant Governor Merriam was sworn in as governor.

===Longshoremen&#x27;s strike===
Nearly immediately after assuming the governorship, Merriam faced labor agitation, particularly by members of the International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association on the docks of San Francisco. Beginning in May 1934, longshoremen along the West Coast walked off the job to strike, protesting against the ILA national leadership&#x27;s negotiated settlements with transportation and cargo companies. Longshoremen demanded six-hour days, closed shops, and the right to unionize freely. Activity in the ports of San Francisco and Oakland ground to a halt. Teamsters soon joined the longshoremen in their walk-out. Popular support for the strikers also grew from various segments of the urban working-class, left unemployed by the Great Depression. By the strike&#x27;s second month, violence had begun to break out along the Embarcadero as San Francisco Police clashed with the strikers during attempts to escort hired labor to the docks. Municipal officials accused the ILA&#x27;s ranks filled with Communists and other left-wing radicals.

As governor, James Rolph had consulted with other West Coast governors such as Julius L. Meier of Oregon and Clarence D. Martin of Washington to bring in the U.S. Department of Labor in order to settle the dispute. After his unexpected death in June, these efforts were suspended. Furthermore, negotiations between the federal government and local ILA organizers failed to yield any agreement.

On July 5, 1934, as more attempts to open the Port of San Francisco were made by employers, hostilities between strikers, their sympathizers, and the police reached their zenith. Later known as &quot;Bloody Thursday&quot;, San Francisco Police shot tear gas at strikers and sympathizers on Rincon Hill, followed by a charge on horseback. Later, protestors surrounded a police car and attempted to overturn it, but were met by gunshots in the air, and quickly afterwards, shots into the crowd itself. Later in the day, police raided an ILA union hall, shooting tear gas into the building and into other local hotels.

Merriam, only governor for a month, threw the state government into the fray. As reports of growing violence in San Francisco reached Sacramento by the minute, Merriam activated the California Army National Guard, deploying regiments to San Francisco&#x27;s waterfront. In the weeks before &quot;Bloody Thursday&quot;, Merriam had remained updated on the ongoing labor dispute, threatening only to activate the Guard if the situation grew too serious. Behind the public scenes, however, the Governor had confided to fellow Republicans that ordering the Guard into San Francisco would ruin him politically. The events of July 5, however, proved to be a turning point. In addition to the Guard&#x27;s deployment, federal troops of the U.S. Army were placed on stand-by in the Presidio if the situation grew beyond the Guard&#x27;s control.

Merriam also ordered the halt of construction on the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge until the violence in San Francisco subsided.

Within the day, 1,500 Guardsmen armed with fixed bayonets and machine guns patrolled the waterfront, with an additional 5,000 state troops on reserve. Explaining to the United Press the following day, Merriam placed full blame of &quot;Bloody Thursday&quot; on the political Left. &quot;The leaders of the striking longshoremen are not free from Communist and subversive influences...There will be no turning back from the position I have taken in this matter.&quot;

Following the funerals of the two men slain on &quot;Bloody Thursday&quot;, the San Francisco Labor Council voted for a general strike. For four days from July 16 to July 19, the activity in the city ground to a halt. Mayor Angelo J. Rossi requested more Guardsman in the city, and in meetings with generals, plans were drawn to impose martial law over the entire city. However, with a heavily armed National Guard presence along the waterfront, violence did not break out again. In the meantime, the police, now backed up by National Guardsmen, raided and arrested militant and radical offices of the International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association (ILA) leaders and sympathizers. By July 19, the General Strike Committee and the Labor Council ordered an end to the strike, demanding its picketers to accept arbitration from the federal government. With the strike broken by its less militant leadership, longshoremen grudgingly returned to work.

Less than three years later, Governor Merriam was called upon to intervene in another labor dispute, the Stockton Cannery Strike of 1937 in which one person died and 50 injured. Merriam refused to call up the National Guard this time, but did play a significant role in mediating between the two sides after the violence to get the canneries open and save the $6 million spinach crop.

===1934 Gubernatorial election===
In the aftermath of the Longshore Strike, Merriam was highly praised by the conservative San Francisco press for his perceived victory over the strikers. During the strike, state Republicans nominated the Governor to run for a full term in the general election that November. Merriam, however, had threatened not to deploy the California National Guard to San Francisco if the party would not nominate him.

Running against Merriam in the 1934 elections was former Socialist Party member Upton Sinclair, who had surprisingly won the nomination of the Democratic Party for governor. A third-party candidate, Raymond L. Haight of the Commonwealth-Progressive Party, also challenged Merriam.

During the campaign, Sinclair promoted the EPIC project, a socialist work program to ensure universal employment for all Californians, complete with the state control of factories, the opening of farm cooperatives and the creation of a cabinet-level California Authority for Production agency to oversee state employment.

The Commonwealth Party&#x27;s Haight relied on centrists from the Democrats who believed that Sinclair had driven the party too far to the left.

Merriam&#x27;s campaign rallied state conservatives into the so-called &quot;Stop Sinclair&quot; movement. Among supporters were MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer, media tycoon William Randolph Hearst, and Los Angeles Times publisher Harry Chandler. During the campaign, Mayer turned multiple studio lots in Los Angeles into propaganda machines, churning out fake newsreels to be played before feature-length films in the state. One notable newsreel included Soviets arriving in California to vote for Sinclair. Also during the campaign, Merriam frequented football games and public events, and on one occasion, attended a hospital talking to deaf mutes through an interpreter. Many such events were quickly publicized by the conservative press.

The result of the 1934 general election saw Merriam defeating Sinclair by 259,083 votes receiving 48% of the vote to Sinclair&#x27;s 37%. Haight garnered 13%. After the election, Merriam announced that the result was &quot;[a] rebuke to socialism and communism.&quot;

The 1934 general election is generally remembered as one of the most hotly contested elections in California history. It has also been cited by political historians as one of the first modern elections, due to the various uses of popular media and rhetoric to both popularize and demonize candidates.

===Full Term===

Upon beginning his full term, Merriam immediately faced an ever-shrinking state budget and growing deficit. In an effort that later angered many powerful conservative backers who had originally supported his 1934 candidacy, as well as challenging his own deep-seated conservatism, Merriam proposed to the Legislature a tax increase of nearly $107 million. The tax reform laws included instituting a state personal income tax modeled after the Federal Income Tax of 1934, which had been created by the Democratic-controlled Congress, and raising sales taxes to 3%. The Legislature agreed and passed the tax reform law in 1935. William Randolph Hearst, whose newspapers provided one of the bulwarks of the governor&#x27;s 1934 campaign, complained bitterly over the reformed tax laws. The Hearst-owned &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;&#x27;s editorial shortly after the reform bills&#x27; passage read: &quot;extortionate and confiscatory taxation will mean ... devastation of business, paralysis of industry.&quot;

Fanning the growing rift between Merriam and conservative Republicans, right-wing author and playwright Charles Gilman Norris penned letters that became widely circulated thanks to Hearst&#x27;s newspaper empire, complaining of Merriam&#x27;s reforms. &quot;The minute the proposed State Income Tax becomes law, my wife, Kathleen Norris, and myself will put both our homes — the one in Palo Alto and our ranch near Saratoga — up for sale and move out of the State. There is no alternative for us. We pay 52% of our income now to the Federal Government at Washington and under the proposed State Income Tax Law, we shall have to pay an additional 18%, so that out of every dollar we earn from our writings, 70¢ will go out in taxes!&quot; Hearst supporters challenged Merriam&#x27;s and the Legislature&#x27;s 1935 reform laws in a special referendum in 1936 with Proposition 2. The proposition would automatically repeal the tax reforms and would in the future require the support of two-thirds of the Legislature and approval of voters by statewide referendum before any new income tax could be imposed. The measure, however, was defeated. While the State Senate was controlled by Republicans, the crucial lower house Assembly, where finance bills originated, was split between conservative and socialist-leaning Democrats. Merriam proceeded with appeasing the closely divided Legislature by praising the federal Townsend Plan, while complaining to conservatives and other capitalist supporters that he was surrounded by fanatics.

===1938 Gubernatorial election===

By the 1938 general election, Merriam had lost much support from the right due to the tax reform laws and support for Social Security, while he garnered little support or sympathy from the left due to his troubled relationship with labor unions and the squelching of the Longshore Strike. In the primaries, the Democratic Party nominated State Senator Culbert Olson, a former EPIC and Upton Sinclair supporter as well as an unabashed supporter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. Republicans, meanwhile, renominated Merriam for a second full term.

Merriam Lost to Olson, by 220,715 votes, ending the Democratic isolation from the governorship that had lasted for forty years beginning with the election of Governor Henry Gage.

==Post-governorship==
Merriam resided in the Bluff Park neighborhood of Long Beach, California.

After his defeat, Merriam retired from public life. In 1941 he joined the California Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. Following the death of former Governor and U.S. Senator Hiram Johnson in 1945, a brief write-in campaign for Merriam appeared, though it only garnered 500 votes. He died at home in Long Beach of a heart attack, at age 89, on April 25, 1955.

<text>The Red Porch or Red Staircase (, &quot;Krasnoe Kryltso&quot;), decorated with stone lions, leads into the Palace of Facets in the Kremlin, Moscow.

In old Russian the word &quot;krasny&quot; meant &quot;beautiful&quot;, but today it means &quot;red&quot;. This is the same word used for &quot;Red Square&quot;.

On the morning of his coronation, the Tsar was met at the Red Porch, where he took his place beneath a large canopy held by thirty-two Russian generals, with other officers providing additional support. Accompanied by his consort (under a separate canopy) and the imperial regalia, he proceeded slowly toward the Cathedral of the Dormition, where his crowning and anointing would take place. After the service, the Emperor and Empress proceeded under canopies back to the Red Porch of the Kremlin, where they rested and prepared for a great ceremonial meal at the Kremlin&#x27;s Hall of Facets. During their procession back to their Kremlin palace, later rulers (starting with Nicholas I) stopped on the Red Staircase and bowed three times to the assembled people in the courtyard, symbolizing what one historian has called &quot;an unspoken bond of devotion&quot; between ruler and subjects.

In the 1930s the porch was destroyed, and its place was taken by an unimpressive Kremlin canteen. In 1994 the Red Porch was the first of Moscow’s monuments to be restored.</text><links>

<text>The Douglas YOA-5 was an amphibious aircraft designed for the United States Army Air Corps, based on the Navy&#x27;s Douglas XP3D. Although a prototype was built, it did not enter production.

==Design and development==
In November 1932, the U.S. Army ordered the development of an amphibious reconnaissance aircraft/bomber, intended to act as navigation leaders and rescue aircraft for formations of conventional bombers. The resultant aircraft, which was ordered under the bomber designation YB-11, was designed in parallel with the similar but larger Douglas XP3D patrol flying boat for the United States Navy. It was a high-winged monoplane with two Wright R-1820 Cyclone radial engines mounted in individual nacelles above the wing, resembling an enlarged version of the Douglas Dolphin.

Prior to completion, it was redesignated firstly as an observation aircraft YO-44 and then as the YOA-5 &#x27;observation amphibian model 5&#x27;. It first flew during January 1935, and was delivered to the army during February that year. The concept for which it was designed proved impracticable, and no further production ensued, but the YOA-5 was used to set two world distance records for amphibians, being finally scrapped in December 1943.

==Operators==
*United States Army Air Corps

==Variants==
;YB-11
:An amphibious reconnaissance bomber ordered in 1932 by the US Army Air Corps, powered by 2x Wright R-1820-13 Cyclone radial engines.
;YO-44
:The YB-11 redesignated in the Observation category before completion.
;YOA-5
:Another redesignation to the Observation Amphibian category. One built, given the aforementioned designations at various times in its life. The YOA-5 started life with Wright R-1820-13 Cyclone engines, was re-engined with Wright YR-1820-45 Cyclone engines for experimental long-range flying, then re-engined again with Wright R-1820-25 Cyclones.

<text>Charlotte Dundas is regarded as the world&#x27;s second successful steamboat, the first towing steamboat and the boat that demonstrated the practicality of steam power for ships.

==Early experiments==
Development of experimental steam engined paddle boats by William Symington had halted when the sponsor, Patrick Miller of Dalswinton, abandoned the project. Symington had continued building steam pumping engines and mill engines. In 1793 he had developed a drive using a pivoted crosshead beam above the vertical cylinder to transmit power to a crank.

Miller&#x27;s project and Captain John Schank&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt at a canal steam tug had come to the attention of Thomas, Lord Dundas, Governor of the Forth and Clyde Canal Company, and at a meeting of the canal company&#x27;s directors on 5 June 1800 approved his proposals on the basis of &quot;a model of a boat by Captain Schank to be worked by a steam engine by Mr Symington&quot;.

The boat was built by Alexander Hart at Grangemouth to Symington&#x27;s design with a vertical cylinder engine and crosshead transmitting power to a crank driving the paddlewheels. Trials on the River Carron in June 1801 were successful. This first boat may have been named &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot; and the trials apparently included towing sloops from the river Forth up the Carron and thence along the Forth and Clyde Canal. There was concern about wave damage to the canal banks, and possibly the boat was found to be underpowered on the canal, so the canal company refused further trials.

==&quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot;==
In 1801 Symington patented a horizontal steam engine directly linked to a crank, and got the support of Lord Dundas for a second steamboat which would become famous as &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot;, named in honour of his Lordship&#x27;s daughter.

===Construction===
Symington designed a new hull around his powerful horizontal engine, with the crank driving a large paddle wheel in a central upstand in the hull, aimed at avoiding damage to the canal banks. The new boat was long, wide and depth, with a wooden hull. 
After a model of the boat was made and shown to Lord Dundas, the boat was built by John Allan, and the engine by the Carron Company.

===First sailing===
The first sailing was on the canal in Glasgow on 4 January 1803, with Lord Dundas and a few of his relatives and friends on board. After some improvements, in March 1803 &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot; towed two 70-ton barges along the Forth and Clyde Canal to Glasgow, and despite &quot;a strong breeze right ahead&quot; which stopped all other canal boats it took only nine and a quarter hours, giving an average speed of about . This demonstrated the practicality of steam power for towing boats.

===End of the project===
Plans to introduce boats on the Forth and Clyde canal were thwarted, largely by fears of erosion of the banks, and a project to build tug boats for the Bridgewater Canal had ended with the Duke of Bridgewater&#x27;s death a few days before the March trial. &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot; was left in a backwater of the canal at Bainsford until it was broken up in 1861. Symington was not paid all he had invested in construction of &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot; and was left disappointed, but the development of steamboats was continued by others including Robert Fulton in the United States and Henry Bell in Scotland.

<doc id="874172" wikidata="Q356889" url="?curid=874172" title="Richard Barnes Mason">
<text>Richard Barnes Mason (January 16, 1797July 25, 1850) was an American military officer who was a career officer in the United States Army and the fifth military governor of California before it became a state. He came from a politically prominent American family and was a descendant of George Mason, a framer of the U.S. Constitution and father of the Bill of Rights.

Gen. Mason is especially important to the history of California, because as military governor of the occupied territory, he wrote the official report that led to the California gold rush.

Mason was &quot;an aristocratic Virginian, a large portly man, six feet in height. He possessed all the peculiarities of a Southerner, accentuated,&quot; but he was known to have confined Jefferson Davis to quarters, who was under his command. A Lt. James Abert described him so, &quot;It would be presumption in me to speak of so accomplished and well known an officer; but I cannot refrain from expressing my grateful sense of the kindness and hospitality with which we were received and treated by himself and his amiable lady, and indeed, by all the officers and ladies attached to the command.&quot;

==Early life==
&quot;Richard Barnes Mason, born in Fairfax County, Virginia, January 16, 1797, was the son of George Mason and Elizabeth Mary Ann Barnes Hooe, who were married April 22, 1784.&quot; His grandfather was famous founder George Mason. Richard Barnes Mason inherited a considerable estate, consisting mostly of land and enslaved men and women. Upon the death of his father, he and his siblings frequently squabbled over the division of the estate and the profits made by selling enslaved men and women. In 1823, Richard complained to his brother George that &quot;I wish you would make some exertion to pay me for Tom Clarke [an enslaved man whom the family sold]. It is now six years since you sold him, and I have not yet received a cent. It is not right that, you should, who inherited half my father&#x27;s fortune, withhold from me, who got none, what is so justly my due.&quot; Like so many other enslavers and prominent Virginians, Mason&#x27;s wealth was heavily dependent upon the labor and bodies of the people he held as slaves.

==Military career==
Mason was commissioned in the Army in 1817, to be stationed in the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes area. While serving, he frequently speculated in land and wrote to his family and friends with tips on where they could make the greatest fortune by speculating in land and relocating with the enslaved men and women who they claimed ownership of. In 1820, he told his brother to &quot;advise Gerard by all means to sell his landed property and move with his Negroes to KY or the Missouri.&quot; Barnes frequently complained to his siblings about his low pay, and implored them to send his money or his &quot;negroes&quot; so that he could work them in Kentucky.

He served in the 1st U.S. Infantry during the Black Hawk War. In 1833, he transferred to the 1st U.S. Dragoons as its first Major. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1836. During the Mexican–American War, he served in New Mexico Territory and California, rising to the rank of colonel in 1846.

Following the war, he was appointed military governor of California, serving from May 31, 1847, until April 13, 1849. When gold was discovered at Sutter&#x27;s Mill, Mason made a report of the finding to President James K. Polk. That official description of the massive gold discovery is credited with sparking the California Gold Rush, resulting in the settlement of the land.

Mason died in 1850 at Jefferson Barracks in St. Louis, Missouri, and was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery.

In the US Federal Census of 1850 for Jefferson Barracks, St. Louis County, Missouri, dated 18 August 1850, the following annotation is located at the bottom of the third page: &quot;Brig Genl Mason died at Jefferson Barracks July 1849 of Cholera.&quot; However, &quot;The St. Louis Intelligencer&quot; reported the General&#x27;s death on Saturday, July 27, 1850, (p. 3, cols. 1, 4.)

==Marriage and children==
Mason married Elizabeth Margaret Hunter on 28 January 1836. Richard and Elizabeth had three daughters:
* Emma Twiggs Mason Wheaton (17 October 1836 – 16 February 1864)
* Elizabeth Mary Ann Sally Mason (20 August 1838 – 19 November 1912)
* Alice Graham Mason (c. 1843 – 10 February 1847)

==Honors==
In 1882, the Post at Point San Jose in San Francisco, California, was renamed Fort Mason in his honor, and served as an Army base for more than 100 years.

<doc id="874175" wikidata="Q2424056" url="?curid=874175" title="Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola">
<text>Don Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola y Pedrueca or Marcelino de Sautuola was a Spanish jurist and amateur archaeologist who owned the land where the Altamira cave was found.

==Altamira cave==
The Altamira cave, now famous for its unique collection of prehistoric art, was well known to local people, but had not been given much attention until 1868, when it was &quot;discovered&quot; by the hunter Modesto Cubillas Pérez.

Sautuola started exploring the caves in 1875. He did not become aware of the paintings until 1879, when his eight-year-old daughter María noticed that the ceiling was covered with images of bison. Sautuola, having seen similar images engraved on Paleolithic objects displayed at the World Exposition in Paris the year before, rightly assumed that the paintings might also date from the Stone Age. He therefore engaged an archaeologist from the University of Madrid to help him in his further work.

===Publication===
Professor Juan Vilanova y Piera supported Sautuola&#x27;s assumptions, and they published their results in 1880, to considerable public acclaim. In contrast, the scientific establishment of his day was reluctant to accept the presumed antiquity of the paintings. The French specialists, led by their guru Gabriel de Mortillet, were particularly adamant in rejecting the hypothesis of Sautuola and Piera and their findings were loudly ridiculed at the 1880 Prehistorical Congress in Lisbon. Due to the supreme artistic quality, and the exceptional state of conservation of the paintings, Sautuola was even accused of forgery. A fellow countryman maintained that the paintings had been produced by a contemporary artist, on Sautuola&#x27;s orders.
During the next 20 years, several other findings of prehistoric paintings made the Altamira-paintings more plausible, and mainstream scientists retracted their opposition to the Spaniards. In 1902, the respected French archaeologist Émile Cartailhac, who had been one of the leading critics, emphatically admitted his mistake in the article, &quot;Mea culpa d&#x27;un sceptique&quot;, published in the journal &quot;L&#x27;Anthropologie&quot;.

===Legacy===
Sautuola had died fourteen years before Cartailhac&#x27;s apology, and did not live to enjoy the restitution of his honour or the later scientific confirmation of his premonitions. Modern dating techniques have since confirmed that the paintings of the Altamira cave were created over extended periods, ranging from 20,000 and 40,000 years ago. For the study of Paleolithic art, Sautuola&#x27;s discoveries must now be considered pivotal.

==Family==
Sautuola&#x27;s daughter later married into the Botín family of Cantabrian bourgeoisie. The current owners of Banco Santander are Sautuola&#x27;s descendants.

<text>The Cross Island Parkway is a controlled-access parkway in New York City and Nassau County, part of the Belt System of parkways running along the perimeter of the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. The Cross Island Parkway runs from the Whitestone Expressway (Interstate 678 or I-678) in Whitestone past the Throgs Neck Bridge, along and across the border of Queens and Nassau County to meet up with the Southern State Parkway, acting as a sort of separation point which designates the limits of New York City. The road is designated as New York State Route 907A (NY 907A), an unsigned reference route, and bears the honorary name [[100th Infantry Division (United States)|100th Infantry Division]] Parkway.

The exit numbering is a continuation of the Belt Parkway, with exit numbers increasing north. At exit 25A (Southern State Parkway), the Cross Island Parkway becomes the Belt Parkway (more specifically, the section once known as the Laurelton Parkway). Before its exits were renumbered to align with the Belt Parkway, they were numbered to co-align with the Southern State Parkway, which is why that parkway begins with exit 13 (the Cross Island Parkway was once exits 1 to 12).

== Route description ==

The Cross Island Parkway begins at an interchange with the Belt Parkway and the Southern State Parkway in the Cambria Heights section of Queens. A short distance after exit 25B, which serves Linden Boulevard, forks off the Cross Island. The parkway runs northward along the Queens-Nassau county line upon leaving the interchange, running between Cambria Heights in Queens and Nassau&#x27;s town of Hempstead (Elmont and Bellerose Terrace) as it enters Belmont Park. In Belmont Park, the Cross Island enters exit 26A, the first of two gated-entrance exit ramps for Belmont Park parking lots. After crossing under Belmont Park Road, the parkway enters exit 26B, a partial cloverleaf interchange which serves NY 24 (Hempstead Avenue in Queens Village and Hempstead Turnpike in Elmont). Paralleling the race track, the Cross Island Parkway continues north, passing west of Belmont Park&#x27;s Long Island Rail Road station, where southbound exit 26C forks to NY 24. Exit 26D is the final entrance ramp to Belmont Park and also provides access to UBS Arena and the Elmont Long Island Rail Road station.

After exit 26D, the Cross Island Parkway crosses under the Long Island Rail Road main line then Superior Road before crossing into the Nassau County hamlet of Bellerose Terrace. After the crossing, the parkway enters exit 27, a cloverleaf interchange with NY 25 (Braddock Avenue and Jericho Turnpike) and Jamaica Avenue before crossing back into Queens. A short distance later, the parkway enters exit 28A, serving NY 25B (Hillside Avenue) via a diamond interchange and exit 28B for Union Turnpike via a collector-distributor road. Now proceeding northwest, the Cross Island crosses under Union Turnpike and enters exit 29, a trumpet interchange with the Grand Central Parkway.

After crossing under the multitude of lanes that make up the interchange and the Grand Central Parkway, the Cross Island Parkway crosses under Douglaston Parkway and enter Alley Pond Park. The Cross Island parallels the Douglaston Parkway northwest for a stretch, entering exit 30, a trumpet interchange with the Long Island Expressway (I-495) in Alley Pond Park. The parkway parallels Alley Creek as it bends further to the northwest, entering exit 31, a partial cloverleaf interchange with NY 25A (Northern Boulevard) and the Alley Pond Environmental Center. Past the junction, the highway continues on a northwestward track as it passes under the Port Washington Branch of the Long Island Rail Road and begins to run along the western edge of Little Neck Bay.

After a pedestrian crossover, the parkway passes a parking lot for Bayside Marina, accessible only via the parkway&#x27;s northbound lanes. The Cross Island Parkway soon leaves the side of Little Neck Bay and passes south of Fort Totten Military Reservation. While south of Fort Totten, the parkway enters exit 32, a diamond interchange with Bell Boulevard. A short distance later, the parkway enters another diamond interchange, exit 33, this time for the Clearview Expressway (I-295) and the Throgs Neck Bridge. The northbound lanes also boast a ramp for Utopia Parkway (signed as exit 34). After crossing under Utopia Parkway, the Cross Island enters the Whitestone section of Queens, where southbound, an exit 34 serves 160th Street and Utopia Parkway.

Continuing west, the Cross Island Parkway crosses through Whitestone, crossing under Clintonville Street, 150th–149th Streets and 14th Avenue before entering exit 35 southbound, serving 14th Avenue and Francis Lewis Boulevard. After crossing under 147th Street, the parkway enters exit 36, a partial diamond interchange with the Whitestone Expressway (I-678), which proceeds north to the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge and southbound towards John F. Kennedy International Airport. This interchange also serves as the northern terminus of the Cross Island Parkway.

== History ==

=== Design ===
The Cross Island Parkway was first proposed in 1930 by Robert Moses, President of the New York State Council of Parks, as part of a $20 million (1930 USD) plan to construct several parks and parkways throughout New York City. This proposal also included proposals for the Richmond Parkway and the corridor of the Grand Central Parkway. The proposal was held at the Hotel Commodore in Manhattan during the Park Association of New York City annual dinner, which had an attendance of 500 civic leaders. While the group accepted the idea, there were certain complaints about costs of the new projects, which were centered between Queens and Staten Island. The city had about $400 million in borrowing capacity, and that most of these projects should wait and be dealt with one at a time for funding by their importance.

The project for the Cross Island soon became the northernmost part of the &quot;Circumferential Parkway&quot;, a new roadway that would start at Owl&#x27;s Head Park and run along the southern shores of Brooklyn and Queens. The Cross Island Parkway piece would begin at the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge (then under construction), cross through the neighborhoods of Whitestone, Bayside and Alley Park and run along the Nassau County border until reaching the Laurelton Parkway, which would connect the Cross Island and the Southern Parkway. In December 1937, Moses, now commissioner of the New York City Parks Department, recommended the Cross Island, along with the other parkways proposed in Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan and The Bronx would cost about $8,026,182 (1937 USD) to acquire land for and that it would erase numerous bottlenecks throughout the city.

In June 1938, the Regional Plan Association proposed 27 new parks throughout the city, including three that would serve the purpose of helping construct the Cross Island Parkway. The first, an approach to the Whitestone Bridge, the city had recently gotten control of, the second; a park along Little Bay, a section of the Long Island Sound that would also connect to the Clearview golf course. The final piece was a section near Willets Point that also included Little Bay, Little Neck Bay and connecting to Alley Park. The Regional Plan Association, in coordination with Moses, requested these new park ideas as urgent, and would help improve the parkway system through New York City.

The Circumferential Parkway, which would cost $28,5 million (1938 USD), was accepted on October 13, 1938; the State of New York and the city provided $16,5 million, while the other $12 million came from the Public Works Administration. The city could not take on any more debt to fund the project, leading the New York City Comptroller to recommend that the parkway be delayed. To provide funding for the new parkway, money for a new courthouse for the Appellate Division had to be eliminated, along with subway improvements and additional funding from the 1939 capital budget. The borough of Manhattan paid 66% of the cost, while Queens and Brooklyn each paid 17%. The new parkway would help connect other transportation facilities throughout Brooklyn and Queens, and as a result, plans for a connection to South Brooklyn and the West Side and East Side Highways. The city also appropriated $3.327 million for the land acquisition for the new alignment, plus the engineering work. Moses notified the board that he had $5 million worth of contracts to let so that work could start as soon as possible. The board also accepted the $12 million federal contribution for the new project.

The name of the parkway system was changed in December 1938 from the &quot;Circumferential Parkway&quot; to the Belt Parkway, on request by Mayor of New York City Fiorello LaGuardia, who settled an argument of different names, one of which included using the last three letters of Brooklyn and the first three of Queens to make the Lynque Parkway. However, people felt that name was a bit too absurd and Moses and the city agreed to the new Belt name, and removed the former name due to many people who could not pronounce the former name. Another proposed name for the new roadway, among others, was suggested by LaGuardia, calling the road the Ringstrasse Parkway. The Queens section of the Belt Parkway was ultimately named Cross Island Parkway, usurping that name from the parallel Francis Lewis Boulevard.

=== Construction ===
Almost immediately after the parkway was approved by the city, bids were flowing in for new project contracts to construct the new parkways. The Belt system would be constructed via numerous contracts, which involved grading the new parkway, constructing bridges, and paving the new highway. 66 spans of bridges were going to be constructed for the entire system, with the section of the Cross Island Parkway between Fort Totten and the Whitestone Bridge approach being bid on by December 23, 1938. By this point, already seven contracts totaled at over $5 million (1938 USD). S.J. Grover and Sons, a firm based out of Ridgefield, New Jersey, got the contract for the section. Just three days prior, the city got bids for grading the new parkway through Springfield, Queens, between Arthur Street and Brookville Boulevard, as well as a vehicular bridge over the Cross Island Parkway at Springfield Boulevard and 225th Street. The project went to Petracca and Banco of St. Albans.

In January 1939, the state government received bids for the construction of the interchange between the Whitestone and Cross Island parkways. On February 4, 1939, Governor of New York Herbert Lehman gave permission to let the city construct the Cross Island Parkway piece that crossed into Nassau County. Known as the Bennett-Numan Bill, the bill also required the city to maintain and enforce laws on the Nassau County portion of the new roadway. By February 1939, the project was already 26% along, with parts of the $6.1 million (1939 USD) section of the Belt Parkway system being completed, and eleven contracts had been awarded. On February 24, 1939, the city let a contract to National Excavation Corporation for construction of the Cross Island Parkway between Hillside Avenue and 91st Avenue in Queens. 

The thirteenth contract of the project, let on March 10, would pave the Cross Island Parkway from Hempstead Turnpike to Linden Boulevard, a long stretch in Queens, a new separation between 115th Avenue and one at Linden Boulevard. Good Roads Engineering and Contracting Company of Wantagh won the contract with a bid of $597,794. On March 21, 1939, bids were opened to construct three new bridges along the Cross Island Parkway in Whitestone; the Elmhurst Contracting Company of Corona received the contract. On March 22, the city offered a contract of the grade separation of the Cross Island Parkway over the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Main Line and its spur to Belmont Park, along with separation for nearby Superior Road. The project also included paving of the Cross Island between Jamaica Avenue and Hempstead Avenue. The contract went to the National Excavation Corporation. The state also received bids for paving the Cross Island between 46th Avenue and the Grand Central Parkway; the low bidder for that contract was Andrew Weston Inc. By March 31, 1939, the twentieth contract for the system was let, constructing a new bridge for the Grand Central Parkway to cross over Winchester Boulevard and westbound Grand Central traffic over the Cross Island Parkway.

On June 13, 1939, bids for construction of the new interchange between the Laurelton Parkway, Southern State Parkway and construction of the new parkway between Linden Boulevard and 129th Avenue. Landscaping of the new parkway began around September, when topsoiling and gardening began between the Creedmore State Hospital and Laurelton Parkway. By December, 92% of the landscaping contracts had been announced, with the recent section between the Grand Central Parkway and Fort Totten.

=== Opening ===
While construction continued on the Belt Parkway system, including the Cross Island Parkway, construction was wrapping up on construction of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge, which opened with a ceremony on April 29, 1939. LaGuardia and Moses both praised the construction of the Cross Island Parkway as the important part of the Whitestone side of the new bridge. By 1940, final bids on the new project were still coming in for the Belt Parkway projects, which included a contract let on April 17, 1940 for new fencing along the three parkways. Ross Galvanizing Works in Brooklyn won the contract for fencing between North Conduit Avenue and the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge along the Southern, Laurelton and Cross Island. On May 22, 1940, a contract was let to Frank Mascali and Sons, which paved, drained, filled and graded sections of the Cross Island Parkway between the Grand Central and the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge.

Two hundred construction workers formally toured the parkway on June 8, 1940. It was announced that the entire Belt Parkway system, long, would open to traffic on June 29, 1940, with a ceremonial trip along the entire roadway. With a final total of nearly $30 million (1940 USD), the road was complete except for a portion between Plumb Island and Ocean Parkway near Coney Island. The due date on the Public Works Administration funding, set for June 30, 1940, was met, and the new parkway would have Moses, LaGuardia and the administrator of the PWA, John Carmody. The new parkway was groomed overnight by 1,700 workers to prepare for the opening. The general public was allowed to use the new parkway after the special dignitaries car had passed. The project also included the addition or renovation of several playgrounds and public parks, such as Crocheron Park.

=== Later years ===
In 1952, the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority awarded a $920,000 contract to widen about of the Cross Island Parkway from four to six lanes. As a result of this project, nearly all of the Belt Parkway system was six lanes wide, except for a four-lane section in Laurelton. The TBTA also installed overhead navigational signs at several interchanges in 1953.

The state announced a plan to renovate the Long Island Expressway (I-495) in the vicinity of Alley Pond Park and the Cross Island Parkway in 1995. In 2000, Pataki and New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani announced that the segment of I-495 near Alley Pond Park and the Cross Island Parkway, would be rebuilt at a cost of $112 million. Work started in August 2000 and was substantially completed by 2005. The project included the restoration of within the park, as well as the construction of new ramps between I-495 and the Cross Island Parkway at exit 30. As part of the reconstruction, two cloverleaf ramps were replaced with flyovers; the shoulders in each direction were converted into travel lanes; and new collector-distributor ramps were installed on I-495 east of the Cross Island Parkway interchange.

<text>Bennet C. Riley (November 27, 1787 – June 9, 1853) was the seventh and last military governor of California. Riley ordered the election of representatives to a state constitutional convention, and handed over all civil authority to a governor and elected delegates at the end of 1849; the following year, California joined the U.S. as a state. He participated in the War of 1812 on Lake Ontario. He also served in the United States Army during the Seminole War in Florida, and Mexican–American War.

==Early life and family==
Riley was born to an Irish-Catholic couple, Bennet Riley and Susanna Ann Drury, in St. Mary&#x27;s, Maryland, 1787. His father apprenticed him to a cobbler; later, he served as a foreman in a shoe factory. After his father&#x27;s death in 1811, he signed up for service on a privateer.

Riley married Arabella Israel, of Philadelphia, on 9 November 1834, at the Jefferson Barracks, Lemay, Missouri. They had eight children: William Davenport Riley and Samuel Israel Riley, twins, died in Fort King, Florida, on 15 and 17 November 1841; Bennet Israel Riley, born 1835 in Massachusetts, served in the Navy and died aboard the war-sloop , which disappeared with all hands in September 1854; Mary, born 1836; Arabella I. Riley, 1837–1916) (never married); George, born 1838; and Edward Bishop Dudley Riley (1839–1918), whose military career was split between the Union and Confederate armies.

Ulysses S. Grant described Bennet Riley as &quot;the finest specimen of physical manhood I had ever looked upon...6&#x27;2 (190 cm) in his stocking feet, straight as the undrawn [sic] bowstring, broad shouldered with every limb in perfect proportion, with an eagle and a step as light as a forest tiger.&quot; An accident or injury in his youth caused him to lose part of his palate, and he spoke with a hoarse voice.

==Military career in the War of 1812==
Riley volunteered for service in the War of 1812, and on 19 January 1813, he was appointed Ensign of Rifles. In March of the same year, he became a third lieutenant and in April 1814 a second lieutenant in the First Rifles. He saw action at Sackets Harbor, New York, in second of two battles for control of the shipyards on Lake Ontario. He gained a promotion to first lieutenant in March 1817. Riley was further advanced to captain in the 5th U.S. Infantry, and by 1821 he was transferred to the 6th U.S. Infantry.

===Skirmish near the garrison of Ogdensburg===
Benjamin Forsyth needed firewood for his barracks. Forsyth sent Bennet C. Riley with about a half dozen riflemen upriver to gather some wood in a boat. Riley and his men tried to stay by their side as close as possible and as stealthily as possible. But a group of British gunboats spotted Riley&#x27;s boat crea and set upon them. Benjamin Forsyth and his riflemen rowed out on their boat providing sniper covering fire for Riley&#x27;s crew. The British gunboats were held at bay as Riley and Forsyth both withdrew safely back to their fort in their boats.

===Spearheading and raiding York===
Benjamin Forsyth and Bennet C. Riley spearheaded a raid in York. It would be a massive large force of 1,700 regulars including riflemen in 14 armed vessels. Forsyth and Riley led the way with their riflemen at the front to make a beachhead. Forsyth, Riley, and the riflemen landed at the beach. The Americans engaged the British regulars, Indians, and Canadians who were trying to set up a defense. Forsyth, Riley, and their riflemen hid behind trees and logs and never exposed themselves except when they fired, squatting down to load their pieces, and their clothes being green they were well camouflaged with the bushes and trees. The place chosen by the Americans for landing was very advantageous for their troops, being full of shrubs and bushes. The Americans immediately covered and cut off the British-allied forces, with little or no danger to the Americans. The British and their allies, suffering many casualties, withdrew from the field. The Americans suffered moderate casualties from resistance from British-allied remnants, magazine explosion, or other circumstances. The American raid at York was successful, however it was not without some controversy. Even though the civilians were not harmed, many of their belongings were looted by the Americans and much private property was burned to the ground. This was in spite of the explicit instructions of the American commander, Pike (who was killed in this raid), not to loot or burn private property. The Americans, after conducting their raid, withdrew from York. Forsyth, Riley, and the rest of their riflemen also withdrew.

===Capturing and interrogating prisoners===
Riley, Forsyth, and their riflemen were performing paramilitary operations in British Canada in support of America&#x27;s invasion. Riley and his riflemen were out patrolling and acting as sentries. They captured two Canadian teenage boys who were acting as spies. Riley brought them before Forsyth. Forsythe and Riley did not wish to kill these captured teenagers, as they were just young boys whom they had no intention of killing. Forsyth and Riley bluffed their captured prisoners into talking by pretending to threaten them with death. The ruse worked, and the boys told Forsyth of valuable intelligence about a blockhouse that was being built to contest the American advance. Then Forsyth and Riley released both teenagers. Forsyth sent Riley to inform the American generals of the blockhouse. After Riley informed the American generals, the American army easily overtook the blockhouse and routed the British-Canadian defenders.

===Spearheading and besieging the British blockhouse Lacolle Mills===
Benjamin Forsyth, Bennet C. Riley, and their riflemen spearheaded an attack on British-allied forces who were retreating back to a blockhouse. The main American army followed behind. The British and their allies fell back into their blockhouse. The British and their allies were deeply entrenched and fortified in their blockhouse. Riley, Forsyth, their riflemen, and the American army besieged the blockhouse with rifle/musket fire and artillery. But the British held them off to great effect. After a long siege, the American force withdrew.

===Long-range patrol===
Benjamin Forsyth, Bennet C. Riley, and 70 of their riflemen went out from their base from Chamberlain to patrol near the Canadian border. While the Americans were patrolling in a loose skirmishing V formation. Forsyth stopped his men and had a secret conversation with Riley. Forsyth whispered to Riley that he sensed that there were Indians and Canadians hiding in ambush. Forsyth commanded Riley to tell the rest of the riflemen to casually withdraw so as not to cause the Indians and Canadians to be eager to launch their ambush. Riley suggested to Forsyth that they should withdraw to a tavern on the outskirts of this town and take shelter in it. Riley explained that they could conduct sniper fire from within the cover of the tavern. While Riley and Forsyth were marching their column casually for ten minutes. The Canadian-Indian force caught up and opened fire. All 70 American riflemen opened a simultaneous volley fire killing or wounding many Canadians and Indians. The Americans retreated by leapfrogging. One group of riflemen would provide covering fire while one group of riflemen retreated. The American repeated this process until they reached the tavern. Riley, Forsyth, and all their riflemen went inside the tavern. The Americans sniped at the enemy from behind covered and concealed positions within the tavern. The Americans killed or wounded many Canadians and Indians. After this intense engagement, the enemy fully retreated. The Americans were victorious. One American rifleman was killed and some wounded. The Americans later withdrew back to American lines in Chamberlain.

===Ambushing and killing an enemy leader===
On August 10, 1814, Riley and a dozen American riflemen would conduct a mission behind enemy lines to kill or capture an enemy Canadian Indian tribal partisan leader named Captain Joseph St Valier Mailloux. Riley and his dozen riflemen infiltrated Odeltown in Canada silently. There was an enemy sentry. One of the American riflemen crept on the sentry and silently killed him with his tomahawk. Riley and his men hid the dead sentry&#x27;s body. One of the American riflemen put on the dead sentry&#x27;s uniform to trick captain Mailloux into a false sense of security when he came in to check on the sentry. The American rifleman disguised as the sentry stood guard while Riley and his other riflemen concealed themselves behind the bushes. Captain Mailloux came by and came closer to the sentry imposter to check up on him. Then Riley and his riflemen rose out of their concealment and demanded captain Mailloux to surrender. Captain Mailloux ran away. Riley&#x27;s riflemen fired eleven shots hitting Mailloux eleven times. Mailloux was badly wounded. Riley and his riflemen carried Mailloux back to American lines in Chamberlain. The Americans tried to nurse Mailloux back to health, but Mailloux succumbed to his wounds and passed away.

==Military operations against the Arikara Indians==
The officer joined his superior, Colonel Henry Leavenworth, in an engagement against the Arikara Indians in August 1823. Riley was honored for ten years of faithful service by being promoted to brevet major on 6 August 1828, leading the first military escort along the Santa Fe Trail in 1829. Among those he escorted were Charles Bent, future first territorial Governor of New Mexico during the later Mexican-American War.

==Seminole Wars==
He had tenures as major in the 4th U.S. Infantry (1837) and lieutenant colonel, 2nd U.S. Infantry, beginning in December 1839. The Battle of Chokachotta in Florida took place on 2 June 1840. Colonel Riley was cited for bravery and good conduct during this engagement in the Seminole Wars. He gained the rank of Brevet Colonel in February 1844.

==Mexican-American War==
During the Mexican–American War, as colonel of the 2nd U.S. Infantry, Riley fought at the Siege of Veracruz and the Battle of Cerro Gordo, where he was cited for bravery. He was brevetted brigadier general and assumed command of the 2nd Brigade in David E. Twiggs&#x27;s Second Division. He led his brigade at the Battle of Contreras and the Battle of Churubusco, where Winfield Scott gave him credit for the U.S. victory: Riley had discovered a way around the rear of Velencia&#x27;s position. He was appointed brevet major general and fought at the Chapultepec. After the battle at Churubusco, he also presided over the courts-martial of 72 deserters of the so-called Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion discovered hiding in the San Patricios convent; among them were John Murphy and John Riley. He was generally considered one of the ablest brigade commanders in the army during the war with Mexico.

==Role in California statehood==
After the war with Mexico, Riley served a brief stint at Fort Hamilton, in Brooklyn, New York, in 1848. In the years 1849 and 1850, General Riley commanded the Military Department in Upper California and exercised the duties of Provincial Governor: the inaction of Congress in deciding the issue of California statehood complicated his service. He relieved Bvt. Gen. Persifor Frazer Smith on 13 April 1849, as the Gold Rush worked into its most violent phase. In addition to the influx of prospectors seeking their fortunes, daily desertions of his own men rapidly depleted his troops. At the height of the Gold Rush, he had eight companies of infantry, two artillery, and two dragoons stretched between San Diego and San Francisco. When Congress refused to act on the statehood of California and New Mexico, he called for the election of civil officers to a &quot;de facto&quot; government. Consequently, the military authorities could not prevent the slaughter of California&#x27;s native population, nor could they suppress the violence in the lawless gold camps. He relinquished all his civil power on 20 December 1849.

After his administrative service concluded on the Pacific, Riley was ordered to take command of a regiment on the Rio Grande. However ill-health prevented further service on his part. He returned to his home in Black Rock, near Buffalo, New York, where he died of cancer. General Riley died on Thursday evening, 09 June 1853, survived by his wife Arabella (who died on 12 February 1894) and four children. Riley is buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo.

==Legacy==
On 27 June 1853, Camp Center (Kansas Territory) was named Fort Riley in Bennet Riley&#x27;s honor, even though he never served at the fort, and it was a cavalry post, while Riley&#x27;s career was that of an infantryman. Riley County, Kansas is also named in his honor.

<doc id="874182" wikidata="Q2822802" url="?curid=874182" title="Australia–United States Free Trade Agreement">
<text>The Australia–United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA) is a preferential trade agreement between Australia and the United States modelled on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The AUSFTA was signed on 18 May 2004 and came into effect on 1 January 2005.

==History of the FTA==
The U.S. first proposed a free trade agreement with Australia as far back as 1945. In more recent times, the prospect of an Australia-U.S. FTA was raised in the 1980s by the Hawke government. In 1991 U.S. president George H. W. Bush offered to begin FTA negotiation with Australia and New Zealand, but was turned down by Australian Labor Party Prime Minister Paul Keating.

It was not until early 2001, after the election of George W. Bush in the U.S. and with John Howard in power in Australia, that an Australia-U.S. FTA finally began to take shape. In April 2001, President Bush signalled his interest in pursuing an FTA with Australia provided &quot;everything is on the table&quot;. Following this, in 2004, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade commissioned a private consultancy – the Centre for International Economics (CIE) – to model the economic impacts of such an agreement. Negotiations for the FTA began in March 2003 and after six rounds of negotiations held in Canberra, Hawaii and Washington, D.C., the text was finally agreed to in February 2004, and signed off on by Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick in Washington in May 2004.

The FTA was ratified by the United States Congress with the passage of the &quot;United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act&quot;. It was passed by the House of Representatives on 14 July 2004 by a vote of 314–109 and by the Senate on 15 July 2004 by a vote of 80–16, and signed into law by President George W. Bush on 3 August 2004.

In Australia, the agreement&#x27;s implementing legislation, the &quot;US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 2004&quot;, was passed, with amendments, by the Senate on 13 August 2004. After some delay, the U.S. Administration accepted the amended Australian legislation as being consistent with implementation of the agreement.

The Agreement came into force in both countries on 1 January 2005.

==Provisions of the FTA==

The text of the Free Trade Agreement is divided into twenty-three sections, listed and summarized as follows:

===Establishment of the free trade area and definitions===
This chapter lays the framework for the FTA. It states that the provisions are consistent with the relevant sections of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Both GATT and GATS are documents created by World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements and they lay the boundaries for subsequent bilateral agreements such as the Australian-U.S. FTA.

The chapter also sets definitions to be used throughout the agreement in order to assure uniformity.

===National treatment and market access for goods===
Chapter two of the FTA lays out conditions for what types of goods are subject to non-discriminatory treatment. Certain types of goods are fully applicable to the agreement immediately and some are phased in over a period of years or temporarily applicable.

The chapter also reminds the two countries that they must abide by the WTO rules applying what is called national treatment. &quot;National treatment&quot; means that each country will provide the same treatment to imported goods from the other country as if they were domestically produced goods.

Finally, the chapter established a Committee on Trade in Goods with the purpose of providing arbitration for each country to &quot;raise issues of concern in relation to tariffs, non-tariff measures, rules of origin and customs administration.&quot;

===Agriculture===
The agriculture section of the agreement outlines the system for eliminating most tariffs for agriculture products being traded between the two countries. It also agrees to eliminate export subsidies when the good in question is being exported to one of the two party countries.

Special tariff-rate quotas are part of the agreement. These quotas allow Australian producers to export increasing amounts of these products free of duty to the United States during the tariff elimination period. The following agricultural products are designated:

* Beef
* Dairy
* Tobacco
* Cotton
* Peanuts
* Avocados

The quota systems vary for the different products and are outlined, in detail, in this section.

The section also sets up a Committee on Agriculture with the purpose of providing &quot;a formal opportunity for Australia and the United States to discuss a wide range of agricultural issues relevant to the Agreement, including trade promotion activities; barriers to trade; and consultation on the range of export competition issues.&quot;

Finally, the two countries have committed to working with the WTO on a multilateral scale to eliminate export subsidies to other WTO member countries.

===Textiles and apparel===
Chapter four deals with the trade of textiles and apparel between the two party countries. The bulk of this section outlines the rules of origin provisions with regard to textile goods and safeguarding the domestic markets of the two countries. The agreement provides a mechanism to institute emergency action should the sudden increase in imports due to the reduction of tariffs lead to detrimental effects on the domestic industry of the importing country.

In addition, this section details the cooperation of Customs authorities for ensuring that the rules of the agreement are carried out and outlines possible actions which can be taken if the exporting country appears to be acting in bad faith.

===Rules of origin===
The rules of origin section outlines the rules for determining the origin of the goods being traded in order to establish eligibility and also the method to determine the value of the goods traded.

For the purposes of the FTA, this section defines an originating good as those that:

* are wholly obtained or produced entirely in the country, such as minerals extracted there, vegetable goods harvested there, and live animals born and raised there;
* are produced in the country wholly from originating materials; or
* are produced in the country partly from non-originating materials.

The section also outlines supporting documentation and verifications that the goods being traded are, indeed, originating in the exporting country, as defined by the agreement. The responsibility for verification of the applicable conditions is given to the importer. Denial of preferential treatment and penalties may apply if proper verification is not provided by the importer upon request made by the importing country.

===Customs administration===
This section outlines the requirements of the customs authorities to:

# promptly publish law, regulations, guidelines and administrative rulings,
# administer customs laws in a uniform, impartial and reasonable manner,
# provide advance rulings on tariff classifications and rules of origin within a given period of time,
# provide some sort of administrative body to review customs determinations,
# cooperate with each other on all reasonable matters, especially those involving suspicion of illegal activity,
# protect the confidentiality of information provided in cooperation with other customs authorities,
# impose their respective penalties for violations of customs laws and regulations,
# promptly release goods consistent with ensuring compliance with customs laws,
# apply risk management systems to concentrate on high-risk areas and facilitate low-risk areas, and,
# maintain expedited procedures with respect to express shipments.

===Sanitary and phytosanitary measures===
In conjunction with the existing WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement, this section sets up two committees to ensure that the SPS agreement provisions are followed.

* Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Matters (provided with a mandate for &quot;increasing the mutual understanding of the SPS measures and regulatory processes of each Party as well as continuing the cooperative efforts of the Parties internationally&quot;)
* Standing Working Group on Animal and Plant Health (to help with the resolution of specific animal and plant health matters with the goal of resolving the problems with the least adverse effect on trade as possible)

===Technical barriers to trade===
This section acknowledges the rights and obligations of Australia and the United States to each other with respect to combating barriers to trade. These rights and obligations were laid out by the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which deals with standards, regulations, and conformity assessments, among other things.

Most of the section is language from both countries agreeing to share information on several levels of government regulation. They agree to attempt to accept each other&#x27;s regulations and publish such rules and regulations in a timely manner in order to ensure transparency.

===Safeguards===
The goal of the safeguards section of the agreement is to lay out an agreed upon structure to guard against severe adverse effects to each countries domestic industries during the transition period after lifting tariffs. The countries also agree to consider the exclusion from the application of global WTO safeguards imports from the other country where those imports are not a substantial cause of the injury to the domestic industry.

===Cross-border trade in services===
Section 10 of the FTA gives clear meaning to the phrase &quot;cross-border trade in services&quot; and provides suppliers with an open environment in which to conduct their business. It requires that each country give the other&#x27;s service suppliers national treatment or most-favored-nation treatment and prohibits many restrictions to market access and transfers.

===Investment===
The investment chapter of the FTA provides clear definitions as to what investments are covered and gives cross-border investors assurances in order to make it as safe as if they were investing in their own country. Among other things, the section prohibits each country from imposing or enforcing any of the following requirements in relation to an investment in its territory:

* to export a given level or percentage of goods or services;
* to achieve a given level or percentage of domestic content;
* to purchase, use, or accord a preference to goods produced in its territory, or to purchase goods from persons in its territory;
* to relate in any way the volume or value of imports to the volume or value of exports or to the amount of foreign exchange inflows associated with an investment;
* to restrict sales of goods or services in its territory that an investment produces or supplies by relating such sales in any way to the volume or value of its exports or foreign exchange earnings;
* to transfer a particular technology, a production process, or other proprietary knowledge to a person in its territory; or
* to supply exclusively from its territory the goods that an investment produces or the services it supplies to a specific regional market or to the world market.

===Telecommunications===
This section details agreed upon terms by both countries to assure fair trade between the telecommunications industries in each country. The rules specifically exclude measures relating to broadcast or cable distribution of radio or television programming.

Among other provisions, the agreement lays out rules for settling disputes among the members of the telecommunications industries in one country with the members in the other. It entitles enterprises to:

* seek timely review by a regulator or court to resolve disputes;
* seek review of disputes regarding appropriate terms, conditions, and rates for interconnection; and
* to obtain judicial review of a determination by a regulatory body.

===Financial services===
This chapter is concerned with ensuring a non-discriminatory environment with regard to financial services. The section defines financial services as &quot;all insurance and insurance-related services, and all banking and other financial services, as well as services incidental or auxiliary to a service of a financial nature.&quot;

The section further lays out the scope of its application as it applies to measures by either country that affect:

* financial institutions located in the territory of that country that are controlled by persons of the other country;
* investors of the other country who have invested in financial institutions located in that country;
* the investments of investors of the other country in financial institutions located in that country; and
* cross-border trade in financial services by service suppliers of the other country.

===Competition-related matters===

The parties agreed to minimise obstacles to the operation of each other&#x27;s competition and consumer protection policies. Australia agreed that its governments at all levels would not provide any competitive advantage to any government businesses simply because they are government-owned. This provision is consistent with existing provisions of Australia&#x27;s National Competition Policy

===Government procurement===

Subject to some exceptions, and the non-participation of some US states, the agreement required, in government and government agency procurement, that each party should accord to the other treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded to domestic goods, services and suppliers.

===Electronic commerce===

The parties agreed to co-operate on mechanisms to facilitate electronic commerce, not to impose customs duties on digital products and for each to apply non-discriminatory treatment to the digital products of the others.

===Intellectual property rights===

Australia agreed to extend its copyright expiration period from 50 to 70 years after the author&#x27;s death where copyright is calculated on the basis of the life of a natural person, and 70 years after the first performance or publication in other cases.

The agreement expands the rights of patent holders.

The agreement requires legal enforcement of digital rights management systems, however an Australian legislative committee has issued a report stating that this portion of the treaty has a &quot;significant flaw&quot;: while the agreement provides permitted exceptions allowing the use of copyright access circumvention devices, it also disallows access to the tools used for such circumvention. The report goes on to term it a &quot;lamentable and inexcusable flaw&quot;, an &quot;egregious flaw&quot;, and even a &quot;flaw that verges on absurdity&quot;. The committee expressed the strong view that the Government must find a solution to the flaw before implementing this portion of the treaty.

===Labour===

Chapter 18 of the Agreement deals with labour, and is largely confined to general statements of principle. The Parties reaffirm their obligations as members of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and their commitments under the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-up (1998) (ILO Declaration). The Agreement recognizes the right of each Party to establish its own labour standards, and to adopt or modify accordingly its labour laws, and states that each Party shall strive to ensure that its laws provide for labour standards consistent with the internationally recognised labour principles.

===Environment===

Chapter 19 responds to concerns that parties may seek to gain trade advantages by relaxing environmental laws.

Article 19.2 states that &quot;The Parties recognise that it is inappropriate to encourage trade or investment by weakening or reducing the protections afforded in their respective environmental laws.&quot;

Accordingly, each Party shall strive to ensure that it does not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, such laws in a manner that weakens or reduces the protections afforded in those laws as an encouragement for trade with the other Party, or as an encouragement for the establishment, acquisition, expansion, or retention of an investment in its territory.

===Transparency===

Chapter 20 requires that:

Each Party shall ensure that its laws, regulations, procedures, and administrative rulings of general application respecting any matter covered by this Agreement are promptly published or otherwise made available in such a manner as to enable interested persons and the other Party to become acquainted with them.

and that

Each Party shall maintain judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative tribunals or
procedures for the purpose of the prompt review20-2 and, where warranted, correction of final administrative actions regarding matters covered by this Agreement.

==U.S. attitudes to the FTA==

After the FTA was signed, there were initially concerns that the American agricultural sector would lobby against the agreement, due to a fear that it could interfere with the government&#x27;s farm subsidies program. However, the agreement, with temporary limits on importation of Australian agricultural products such as beef and sugar cane managed to allay the concerns of the American agricultural market (while greatly frustrating many Australian producers).

A coalition of trade unions and other groups did speak out against the agreement on the basis that it would cause similar problems to those experienced by NAFTA.

More substantial lobbying was undertaken by American pharmaceutical companies, who were concerned about the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. See below.

American manufacturing lobbies strongly supported the FTA.

On 15 July, both houses of the United States Congress gave strong support to the FTA. The agreement was also supported by Democratic Party Presidential nominee John Kerry.

Additionally, labour groups expressed concern regarding the agreement. In a report to the USTR office, the Labor Advisory Committee (LAC) recommended that Congress reject the U.S.-Australia FTA because they believed the agreement failed to meet congressional negotiating objectives.

==Australian attitudes to the FTA==

===Support===

The agreement became a major political issue leading up to the 2004 Elections. After a protracted period of negotiation under Howard government Trade Minister Mark Vaile, the agreement was strongly supported by the Howard government as an enormous potential gain to the Australian economy and as essential to the continuation of the U.S.-Australia alliance.

The government relied on estimates of the economic benefits of the FTA computed by the Centre for International Economics, a consultancy group. The leading group supporting the FTA was called Austa. Austa&#x27;s arguments focused on the dynamic benefits of integration with the U.S. economy.

===Opposition===

Criticisms of the FTA appeared from a number of sources and on a number of grounds:

====Trade diversion====

Economic theory suggests that bilateral agreements like the FTA will lead to trade creation between the parties directly involved, but will also cause trade diversion from third countries, offsetting any benefits. Bilateral agreements may also undermine multilateral agreements such as those associated with the World Trade Organization. Partly as a result of these factors, the estimates of benefits produced by the CIE and relied on by the government were disputed by most economists who made submissions to the Senate Committees inquiring into the topic, some of whom concluded that the agreement would reduce Australia&#x27;s economic welfare.

====Intellectual property====

The provisions of the AUSFTA in Ch 17 required Australia to offer stronger protection to American intellectual property. In particular, the minimum term of copyright was extended to 70 years after the author&#x27;s death. Most economists and others interested in intellectual property issues regarded this as undesirable. A number of prominent American economists took the same view in the case of Eldred v. Ashcroft.

Other key changes included:

* special copyright term extension for photographs
* broader definition of technological protection measures, narrow exceptions, and review process
* protection of temporary copies
* stronger protection of electronic rights management information
* protection of pay television broadcasts
* safe harbour provisions for Internet Service Providers
* protection of performers&#x27; economic and moral rights in respect of sound recordings
* broader civil and criminal offences

For a discussion of the copyright changes, see Rimmer, M. &quot;Robbery Under Arms: Copyright Law and the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement&quot;

====Local content provisions====

Many in the Australian film and television community expressed concern over the effect of the agreement on government regulations enforcing a mandatory minimum of locally produced content on television. Since American content can be purchased by networks at a cost far less than the local production of Australian content, fears were raised that the agreement would result in the diminishing fraction of home-grown media being screened on Australian television networks and in Australian cinemas being reduced even further. As a result, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, as well as a number of prominent artists individually, argued for rejection of the FTA on the grounds that it would erode Australian culture.

====Manufacturing and agricultural sector====

Australia as a whole is heavily reliant on the primary sector and the main benefits of a FTA between the two countries were seen to be increased access to the large, but heavily subsidised and protected, American market by Australian producers. In particular, the rural and regional-based National Party lobbied hard to have the agreement extend to the export of sugar. The eventual provisions of the agreement did not go as far as had been hoped, and as a result, some lobbyists for the sugar industry, notably independent Bob Katter, urged rejection of the FTA. However, many, such as then Premier of Queensland Peter Beattie, still felt that the agreement was a net gain for Australian agriculture and supported ratification on that basis.

The Australian manufacturing sector was another problematic area. Australian labour, wage and environmental protection standards are substantially higher than those of the US. The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union ran a high-profile campaign against the FTA on the basis that it would lead to manufacturing jobs being outsourced overseas.

====Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme====

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is a central component of the Australian healthcare system. The scheme provides reimbursement to community pharmacy for the costs of dispensing prescription medicines prescribed in accordance with the PBS Schedule, a comprehensive but closed formulary. Drugs are added to the formulary on the basis of an assessment of comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness compared to the therapy most likely to be replaced in practice. The result is that where there is no evidence of incremental benefit, a drug may not be listed at a higher price than the comparator with the result that for many (but by no means all) drugs the prices for subsidy purposes are a great deal cheaper than in many other major markets.

While the scheme is very effective at keeping many drug prices low, pharmaceutical corporations in both the US and Australia are wary of the operation of the scheme, since they argue that higher drug prices are necessary to fund the costs of research and development. The American pharmaceutical companies claim that in enjoying low-cost medicines, Australians are essentially free riding on the costs of research performed in the U.S.

While companies have in particular criticised the process by which drugs are listed on the PBS, claiming that it lacks transparency, public health advocates have claimed that calls for transparency are merely an effort by drug companies to gain greater control over the process of listing. To a large degree the existing limitations on the transparency of the process are those that have been imposed by the industry itself. The text of the Agreement included text mandating transparency to the public, reflecting an offensive interest of Australia, thus creating a treaty level obligation to circumvent the efforts of the pharmaceutical industry to continue to frustrate public transparency of PBS processes.

Disquiet about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme led to speculation that the American side would lobby heavily for its abrogation as an integral component of a free trade agreement. The Government was criticised, particularly by the Australian Democrats and Greens, for not doing enough to safeguard the operations of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, allegations which the Government strenuously denied. Some academics (such as Thomas Alured Faunce) claimed that the provisions of the Agreement would lead to increases in the prices of PBS medicines. However the relevant text was actually limited to issue of process and transparency, and contained no provisions that could affect price, and this was ultimately shown not to be the case.

====Ratification of the FTA====

The Australian Government did not hold a majority in the Senate, and thus required the support of the opposition Labor party, the Greens, Democrats, or independent senators in order to secure ratification. The Government put heavy pressure on Labor Party leader Mark Latham to secure Opposition support of the agreement (knowing that Latham, among many Labor members, viewed the FTA as beneficial). The issue had divided the party, with the Left faction in particular arguing that Labor should reject the agreement.

Latham responded unexpectedly by making Labor&#x27;s support of the FTA conditional on an amendment that would allegedly safeguard the PBS. This effectively turned the tables on Howard: if the Government refused the amendment as unnecessary, it opened itself to claims it was not safeguarding Australian interests; if it supported the amendment, it then tacitly admitted that the original terms of the agreement were inadequate. The bill was eventually amended and passed.

Latham&#x27;s amendment proposals were supported by the Australian Medical Association, but dismissed as ineffective by the Greens and Democrats, who still argued for outright rejection of the FTA.

==Outcomes==

In the year following the agreement, Australian exports to the U.S. declined, while U.S. exports to Australia increased. This followed the International Monetary Fund&#x27;s prediction that the Australia-United States FTA would shrink the Australian economy marginally because of the loss of trade with other countries. The IMF estimated $US5.25 billion of extra U.S. imports entering into Australia per year under the FTA, but only $US2.97 billion of extra Australian exports to the U.S. per year. However, it remains unclear whether or not Australia&#x27;s worsening trade deficit with the United States can be solely attributed to the FTA. It may have been a lagged effect of an appreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar between 2000 and 2003.

For the U.S., the FTA improved the overall trade deficit situation, creating a trade surplus with Australia which rose 31.7% in the first quarter of 2005, compared to the same timeframe in 2004. U.S. exports to Australia increased 11.7% in the first quarter of 2005 to nearly $3.7 billion for the quarter. Agriculture exports to Australia increased 20%.

According to Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade figures the imbalance in trade between the U.S. and Australia increased substantially during 2007. The United States became Australia&#x27;s largest import source, with goods and services imported to a value of over A$31 billion. Australia&#x27;s exports to the U.S., however, amounted to only $15.8 billion AU. It remains unclear what, if any, real benefits the agreement has produced.

In U.S. Fiscal Year 2006 (October 2005 through September 2006), which was the first full year during which E-3 regulations were in effect, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security recorded 2,123 admissions of Australian citizens as E-3 status foreign workers under the treaty. 9,294 admissions were recorded in U.S. Fiscal Year 2007 (October 2006 through September 2007).

According to Shiro Armstrong from the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University concluded, from over 10 years of dataset from the Productivity Commission suggests that Australian and US trade with the rest of the world fell - that there was trade diversion - due to AUSFTA after controlling for country specific factors. Estimates also suggest trade between Australia and the United States fell in association with the implementation of AUSFTA - also after controlling for country-specific factors. Shiro Armstrong also concludes Australia and the United States reduced their trade with the rest of the world by US$53 billion and are worse off than they would have been without the agreement.

<text>The Bronx–Whitestone Bridge (colloquially referred to as the Whitestone Bridge or simply the Whitestone) is a suspension bridge in New York City, carrying six lanes of Interstate 678 over the East River. The bridge connects Throggs Neck and Ferry Point Park in the Bronx, on the East River&#x27;s northern shore, with the Whitestone neighborhood of Queens on the southern shore.

Although the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge&#x27;s construction was proposed as early as 1905, it was not approved until 1936. The bridge was designed by Swiss-American architect Othmar Ammann and design engineer Allston Dana and opened to traffic with four lanes on April 29, 1939. The bridge&#x27;s design was similar to that of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which collapsed in 1940. As a result, extra stiffening trusses were added to the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge in the early 1940s, and it was widened to six lanes during the same project. The Bronx–Whitestone Bridge was also renovated in 1988–1991 to repair the anchorages, roadways, and drainage. The stiffening trusses were removed during a renovation in the mid-2000s, and the bridge&#x27;s deck and approach viaducts were replaced soon afterward.

The Bronx–Whitestone Bridge is owned by New York City and operated by MTA Bridges and Tunnels, an affiliate agency of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. With a center span of , the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge once had the fourth-largest center span of any suspension bridge in the world. The bridge has a total length of , and its towers reach above water level.

== Description ==
The Bronx–Whitestone Bridge has a main span between its two suspension towers, with the span rising above mean high water. The side spans, between suspension towers and anchorages at each end, are . Thus, the overall length, from anchorage to anchorage, is . As originally designed, the bridge approach on the Queens side descended to ground level via a -long plate girder viaduct, then another on a concrete ramp. The Bronx side&#x27;s approach descended on a plate girder viaduct, then another on a concrete ramp. A toll booth was located on the Bronx side immediately after the end of the concrete ramp.

The span is supported by two main cables, which suspend the deck and are held up by the suspension towers. Each cable is long and contains 9,862 wires, amounting to around of cable length. Each cable contains 37 strands of 266 wires, which in turn measure thick. Each of the suspension towers has a height of above mean high water. The caissons, in turn, are submerged about beneath mean high water. At each end of the suspension span are two anchorages that hold the main cables, both of which are freestanding concrete structures measuring . The width of the bridge deck between the cables is .

Unlike other suspension bridges, the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge originally did not have a stiffening truss system. Instead, I-beam girders gave the bridge an Art Deco streamlined appearance. After the 1940 collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, a bridge of similar design, trusses were added on the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge to minimize the span&#x27;s oscillations. Further modifications to the bridge were made in 1988–1991 and in 2003–2005.

===Highway connections===
The Bronx–Whitestone Bridge carries Interstate 678 (I-678). In Queens, the Whitestone Expressway (I-678) extends south to an interchange with the Cross Island Parkway, located just past the end of the bridge&#x27;s approach ramps. There is an exit from the bridge to the southbound Whitestone Expressway service road, and an entrance and exit from the northbound Whitestone Expressway to the northbound service road. In the Bronx, the bridge leads to the Hutchinson River Expressway (I-678). The expressway has exits and entrances in both directions to the Hutchinson River Expressway service roads, which in turn connect to Lafayette Avenue. The expressway continues north to the Bruckner Interchange, where I-678 ends and becomes the Hutchinson River Parkway; there are also connections to the Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95) and to Bruckner Expressway (I-278 and I-95).

As most trucks carrying over have been prohibited from using the Throgs Neck Bridge (approximately east) since 2005, the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge is suggested as an alternative route for heavy trucks. Tractor-trailers exceeding and traveling between central Queens and the Bronx, as well as all heavy trucks over 53 feet that are banned from the Throgs Neck Bridge, are required to use the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge.

==History==
The idea for a fixed crossing between Ferry Point at Clason Point, Bronx, and Whitestone Point at Whitestone, Queens, was first proposed in 1905 by real estate speculators who wanted to develop Whitestone. At the time, residents around the proposed area of the bridge protested construction in fear of losing the then-rural character of the community. Plans for the bridge were submitted to the Whitestone Improvement Association in 1909, but they were not acted upon. Queens public administrator Alfred J. Kennedy later recalled that in 1911, while he was in the New York State Assembly, he had proposed such a bridge but that his plan was &quot;ridiculed&quot;.

In 1907, the Clason Point, College Point and Malba Ferry Company proposed a ferry route between Clason Point, Bronx, and Malba, Queens, close to the site of the planned bridge. The company was incorporated in 1909, and two years later it started constructing ferry terminals. Ferry operations between Clason Point and Malba began on July 2, 1914.

=== Development ===

==== Planning ====
In 1929, the Regional Plan Association (RPA) proposed a bridge from the Bronx to northern Queens to allow motorists from upstate New York and New England to reach Queens and Long Island without having to first travel through the traffic congestion in western Queens. The RPA believed that it was necessary to connect the proposed Belt Parkway (now Cross Island Parkway) on the Queens side with the Hutchinson River Parkway and Bruckner Boulevard on the Bronx side. The next year, urban planner Robert Moses formally proposed a Clason Point-to-Whitestone bridge as part of the Belt Parkway around Brooklyn and Queens. At the time, it was expected that the bridge would cost $25 million to construct.

In 1932, the New York City Board of Estimate started soliciting applications from private companies to build and operate the crossing as a toll bridge. One such application was made by Charles V. Bossert, who submitted his plan to the Board of Estimate in 1933. Bossert&#x27;s plan went as far as U.S. Congress, where in 1935, a bill to approve the construction of Bossert&#x27;s plan was introduced in the House of Representatives. However, the idea of a private company operating a publicly used toll bridge was unpopular, so it was dropped.

At the same time, the Queens Topological Bureau, Long Island State Park Commission, and Triborough Bridge Authority (TBA; later Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, or TBTA) was conducting a study on the proposed Bronx–Whitestone Bridge. In 1935, the agencies jointly released a report on the connecting roads to be built as part of the bridge plans, and projected that the bridge would cost $20 million (). The bridge would directly link the Bronx, and other points on the mainland, to the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair and to LaGuardia Airport (then known as North Beach Airport), both in Queens. In addition, the Whitestone Bridge was to provide congestion relief to the Triborough Bridge, further to the west, which also connected Queens to the Bronx. Real estate speculators predicted that the new bridge would also encourage development in the Bronx. New residential units in the Bronx were being planned before construction on the bridge itself even started. The RPA had also recommended that the Whitestone Bridge have rail connections, or space for such connections, but Moses ultimately did not include any provisions for rail connections on the bridge.

==== Approval and land acquisition ====
In 1936, governor Herbert H. Lehman signed a bill that authorized the construction of the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge, which would connect Queens and the Bronx. The following January, Lehman signed a bill that allowed the TBA to issue bonds for the construction of the bridge. In February 1937, TBA chief engineer Othmar Ammann announced that the bridge was both &quot;practical and necessary&quot;. Allston Dana was also hired as the engineer of design. The same month, approval of a suspension span between Ferry Point and Whitestone was given by Harry Hines Woodring, the United States Secretary of War. Around the same time, the TBA made plans to issue bonds to fund the construction of the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge. Moses recommended the TBA and the city should each be responsible for half of the bridge&#x27;s $17.5 million cost.

In April 1937, the TBA started selling $25 million in bonds to fund the bridge&#x27;s construction. A $1.13 million contract for the construction of the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge&#x27;s towers was awarded in June 1937 to the American Bridge Company, which had beaten the only other competitor, Bethlehem Steel. The same month, the city started buying property that was in the right-of-way for the Whitestone Bridge and Parkway; shortly afterward, the rights-of-way for the bridge and parkway were legally designated. All of the TBA bonds had been sold by July 1937. The next month, the city had started evicting residents in the path of the bridge&#x27;s approaches, and officials notified seventeen households in Whitestone that they had ten days to find new housing. This raised controversy because of the short notice given, but Moses said such measures were necessary to complete the bridge on schedule. In addition, land in Ferry Point was taken for the construction of the bridge; this land would become Ferry Point Park upon the completion of the bridge.

==== Construction ====

A groundbreaking ceremony was held in November 1937, when the Mayor of New York City, Fiorello H. La Guardia, laid the cornerstone for the bridge&#x27;s Bronx anchorage. Construction on the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge, along with several other road-improvement projects, was sped up so that the regional road network would be ready in time for the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair. To ensure that the bridge would be completed before the fair opened, the cofferdam for the Bronx tower had to be finished in February 1938, followed by the Queens tower in April 1938. Moses anticipated that the bridge and connecting roads would need to be complete by June 1, 1939. The project also included the construction of the Flushing River Lift Bridge, a drawbridge over the Flushing River a few miles south of the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge.

The four sections of each of the two suspension towers were assembled in only 18 days. The tower on the Bronx side was finished first, and in late May 1938, work began on the Queens tower. At the time, it was expected that the spinning of the suspension cables would begin that September. By the first week of July 1938, the TBA reported that both of the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge&#x27;s towers were completed, and that the bridge was on schedule to open on April 30, 1939, ahead of schedule. In addition, the construction of connecting roadways on the Queens and Bronx sides of the bridge was being sped up. The Bronx side of the bridge would connect to the Hutchinson River Parkway, while the Queens side would connect to the Whitestone and Cross Island Parkways.

The process of spinning the bridge&#x27;s cables commenced in September 1938. The first cable, which contained 266 strands, was completed within a week. The suspender cables were completed within 41 days. That October, work started on the Cross Island Parkway approach to the bridge in Queens. The bridge&#x27;s opening date was formalized in January 1939, and the last girder was installed on February 13, 1939. Afterward, the construction of the approach roads was sped up in anticipation of the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair. During construction, one worker died when he fell off the bridge deck. There was another incident in August 1938 in which a 35-ton steel girder dropped from the side of the Whitestone Bridge, though no one was severely injured. The bridge ultimately cost either $17.785 million (equal to about $ million in ) or $19.6 million (equal to about $ million in ).

===Opening===
The Bronx–Whitestone Bridge opened on April 29, 1939, with Moses and La Guardia leading a ceremony of 4,000 people. Both the Whitestone and College Point neighborhoods had celebrations for the new project, which Moses described as a &quot;logical and inevitable part of the Belt Parkway program&quot;. The bridge featured pedestrian walkways and four lanes of vehicular traffic, and passenger vehicles were initially charged 25 cents. The center span was the fourth longest in the world at the opening, behind the Golden Gate Bridge, the George Washington Bridge, and the double spans of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge. The bridge&#x27;s opening, two months earlier than originally scheduled, coincided with the first day of the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair.

A custom model of lampposts, the &quot;Whitestone&quot; or Type 41 lamppost, was made for the bridge. The lamppost model was later installed on other roads, though it was longer being actively installed by the 1960s, and only a few such lamps remained . In preparation for the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair, amber street lights were installed on the bridge&#x27;s approach roads, as well as other key corridors around the city. These lamps were distinctly colored so motorists headed to the fair could follow them while driving. At its north end, the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge was to connect with Eastern Boulevard (later known as Bruckner Boulevard) via the Hutchinson River Parkway. At its south end, the bridge was to connect with the new Whitestone Parkway, which led southwest off the bridge to Northern Boulevard. The connection between the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge and Whitestone Parkway opened in November 1940, while the Hutchinson River Parkway between Pelham Bay Park and the bridge opened in October 1941. The Whitestone and Hutchinson River parkways intersected Bruckner Boulevard at a traffic circle, where congestion worsened over subsequent decades until the Bruckner Interchange replaced the circle in the 1970s. On the Queens side, an extension of Francis Lewis Boulevard opened in November 1939, connecting northeastern Queens with the new bridge, while the Cross Island Parkway approach opened in June 1940.

La Guardia said the bridge could carry up to 4,000 cars per hour in each direction. Within the first two months of the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge&#x27;s opening, it had carried just over a million vehicles, and the bridge was collecting an average of $4,232 a day in tolls. In 1940, the American Institute of Steel Construction recognized the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge as the &quot;most beautiful monumental steel bridge completed during the last year&quot;. Additionally, two parks were opened following the bridge&#x27;s completion. A park under the Queens side of the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge, named for Declaration of Independence signatory Francis Lewis, was opened in 1940. On the Bronx side, the blueprint for Ferry Point Park had been developed in conjunction with the bridge&#x27;s construction, and additional facilities were added in the early 1940s.

=== Truss installation ===

As early as June 1938, engineers observed oscillations in the Whitestone Bridge&#x27;s deck. Concerns grew after the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Tacoma, Washington, collapsed during heavy winds in November 1940. It had employed an -deep girder system, much like the I-beam girders of the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge. However, the Whitestone Bridge was shorter and wider than the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. The Bronx–Whitestone Bridge&#x27;s deck was also thicker than that of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which was only thick to the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge&#x27;s . Overall, the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge was less prone to oscillation and critical failure, as it was not as flimsy as the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. After performing a series of experiments on the bridge&#x27;s design, Ammann concluded that additional measures to stiffen the Whitestone Bridge were unnecessary. A Princeton University professor separately created a model of the bridge, finding that the Whitestone Bridge&#x27;s main span could still oscillate in as many as three segments.

Even so, the public was scared by the fact that the two bridges were similar in design, and this led to a belief that the Whitestone Bridge might be unstable, as Moses later related. Shortly after the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse, Moses announced that steel cable stays would be installed on the bridge&#x27;s towers to reduce oscillation. To mitigate the risk of failure from high winds, eight stay cables, two on each side of both suspension towers, were proposed for installation. The stays were supposed to be completed in January 1941. Although $1 million was initially allocated for the bridge-stiffening project, construction was deferred due to material and labor shortages during World War II.

Planning for the project resumed in September 1945 at the end of the war, and a low bidder for the project was announced that October. The project&#x27;s primary goal was to reinforce the bridge with trusses, thus ensuring the bridge&#x27;s stability. The four lanes of roadway traffic were widened to six lanes, with the two additional lanes replacing the pedestrian walkways on each side. On both sides of the deck, -high steel trusses were installed to weigh down and stiffen the bridge in an effort to reduce oscillation. The stiffening project was completed in 1947. The bridge was repainted in 1953, and large overhead signs were installed on the bridge the same year to direct motorists toward the Whitestone and Cross Island parkways.

=== Increases in traffic ===
By the late 1950s, the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge was carrying nearly 30 million vehicles a year. Concurrently, the Whitestone Parkway and the portion of the Hutchinson River Parkway between the bridge and the Bruckner Interchange were converted to Interstate Highway standards. The Whitestone Parkway became the Whitestone Expressway, and the upgraded part of the Hutchinson River Parkway became the Hutchinson River Expressway. In addition, the Van Wyck Expressway between John F. Kennedy International Airport and Kew Gardens was extended northward to connect with the Whitestone Expressway and the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge. By 1966, the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge had been designated as part of Interstate 678, along with the Whitestone Expressway. These highway upgrades were performed in preparation for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, which was also held in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.

Also by the 1950s, the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge was nearing its traffic capacity because it was the easternmost crossing of the East River between the Bronx and Queens. To alleviate traffic loads on the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge, planning for the Throgs Neck Bridge to the east, started in 1955, and construction of that bridge began in 1957. After the Throgs Neck Bridge opened in 1961, the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge recorded a corresponding 40% decline in traffic; according to a TBTA executive, traffic on the bridge ultimately decreased by more than half. Soon afterward, the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair resulted in an increase in traffic on the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge. In 1968, a heavy storm with winds of up to caused the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge&#x27;s deck to bounce, though the additional trusses helped to reduce vertical movements. No one was injured, and officials stated that the bridge was not in danger of collapsing during the storm.

In the long run, use of the bridge continued to grow. By the bridge&#x27;s 40th anniversary in 1979, there were about 31 million vehicles using the bridge annually. The bridge had recorded a total of 858 million vehicular crossings over its lifetime. By 1985, the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge carried 35 million vehicles annually, more than the 33 million recorded in 1960, before the Throgs Neck Bridge had opened as an alternate route. There had been several plans to build a Long Island Sound bridge east of the Bronx–Whitestone and Throgs Neck bridges to relieve traffic on these crossings, although such a bridge remained unbuilt in the 21st century. After concrete debris fell from the bridge&#x27;s Queens approach viaduct in 1985, the TBTA repaired the approach. Upon the bridge&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1989, a &quot;New York Times&quot; writer said: &quot;The Bronx-Whitestone Bridge amounted to soaring evidence that dreams can come true.&quot;

===Major repairs===
In March 1990, the TBTA announced that the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge would undergo a $20.3 million refurbishment. The anchorages, roadways, and drainage were to be repaired during off-peak hours for two years. Actual work took place between December 1989 and December 1991. As the Throgs Neck Bridge was being repaired simultaneously, this caused major traffic jams at both bridges. During the renovation, the bridge&#x27;s expansion joints were replaced by the American Bridge Company, which had originally built the suspension towers. However, in 1993, the sealant around the joints was observed to be deteriorating, necessitating additional repairs.

By 2001, the TBTA&#x27;s successor Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) planned to spend $286 million in bridge renovations. In 2003, the MTA restored the classic lines of the bridge by removing the stiffening trusses and installing fiberglass fairing along both sides of the road deck. The lightweight fiberglass fairing is triangular in shape, giving it an aerodynamic profile that allows crosswinds to flow through the bridge rather than hit the trusses. The removal of the trusses and other changes to the decking reduced the bridge&#x27;s weight by 6,000 tons, accounting for some 25% of the mass suspended by the cables, In addition, with the truss removals, the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge was able to withstand crosswinds of up to , whereas the trusses could resist crosswinds of no more than . The truss removal project also involved upgrading the lighting systems, including the bridge&#x27;s lightbulbs and the beacons atop the suspension towers, as well as replacing the sprinkler and electrical systems.

In 2005, it was announced that the bridge&#x27;s deck had to be replaced with a new steel orthotropic deck composed of prefabricated panels. One lane at a time needed to be closed and replaced, so as to minimize traffic disruptions. During the deck replacement, five lanes were kept open at all times using a movable barrier, with three Bronx-bound lanes during the morning rush hour and three Queens-bound lanes during the evening rush. Other renovations included adding mass dampers to stabilize the bridge deck; repainting the two towers and the bridge deck; and installing variable-message signs. The deck replacement was completed by 2007. However, cracks were soon observed in some of the new panels, and by 2014, cracks had been observed in 66 of 408 panels, necessitating approximately of rib welds. The renovations were intended to extend the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge&#x27;s lifespan indefinitely. These improvements also accommodated the bridge&#x27;s high traffic volumes: by 2008, the bridge was being used by an average of 120,000 vehicles a day, amounting to 43 million crossings that year.

The Queens and Bronx approaches were replaced in a project that started in 2008. As part of the project, each of the approaches&#x27; lanes was widened to . The replacement of the bridge&#x27;s approaches involved replacing 15 supporting piers and of roadway on the Bronx side, as well as of viaduct on the Queens side, which helped support the wider lanes. The contract for the Bronx viaduct replacement was awarded in 2008, and it was completed in late 2012 at a cost of $212 million. The replacement of the Queens approach, which cost $109 million, was completed in May 2015. During the renovation of that approach, the exit from northbound I-678 to Third Avenue was closed and rehabilitated.

==Tolls==
, drivers pay $11.19 per car or $4.71 per motorcycle for tolls by mail/non-NYCSC E-Z Pass. E-ZPass users with transponders issued by the New York E‑ZPass Customer Service Center pay $6.94 per car or $3.02 per motorcycle. Mid-Tier NYCSC E-Z Pass users pay $9.11 per car or $3.89 per motorcycle. All E-ZPass users with transponders not issued by the New York E-ZPass CSC will be required to pay Toll-by-mail rates.

The toll plaza of the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge, located on the Bronx side, originally contained 10 toll lanes but was later expanded. Four self-service toll-collection machines were installed at the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge during the 1950s, but they were removed in 1959 because motorists repeatedly dropped their coins at the machines. E-ZPass was introduced at the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge in June 1996. Initially, the bridge&#x27;s toll plaza contained three E-ZPass/cash lanes in each direction to reduce confusion; this contrasted with the Throgs Neck Bridge, where confusion between the E-ZPass-only lanes and cash-only lanes had caused congestion.

Open-road cashless tolling began on September 30, 2017. The tollbooths, which were at the Bronx end of the bridge, were dismantled, and drivers are no longer able to pay cash at the bridge. Instead, cameras and E-ZPass readers are mounted on new overhead gantries manufactured by TransCore near where the booths were located. A vehicle without E-ZPass has a picture taken of its license plate and a bill for the toll is mailed to its owner. For E-ZPass users, sensors detect their transponders wirelessly.
===Historical tolls===


==Public transportation==
The bridge carries two MTA Regional Bus Operations routes, the operated by MTA New York City Transit, and the Limited (formerly part of the QBx1), operated by the MTA Bus Company.

After the removal of the sidewalks starting in 1943, bicyclists were able to use QBx1 buses of the Queens Surface Corporation, which could carry bicycles on the front-mounted bike racks. However, since the Metropolitan Transportation Authority absorbed the bus routes formerly operated by Queens Surface, the bike racks were eliminated. In April 1994, bike racks were installed onto QBx1 buses, but the bike-on-bus program was eliminated on February 27, 2005, the same day as the MTA&#x27;s takeover of the QBx1 route. After the QBx1 was replaced by the Q50, the MTA reintroduced bike racks on Q50 buses in early 2018.

<text>Drug Abuse Resistance Education, or D.A.R.E., is an American education program that tries to prevent use of controlled drugs, membership in gangs, and violent behavior. It was founded in Los Angeles in 1983 as a joint initiative of then-LAPD chief Daryl Gates and the Los Angeles Unified School District as a demand-side drug control strategy of the American War on Drugs.

The program was most prominent in the 1980s and 1990s. At the height of its popularity, D.A.R.E. was found in 75% of American school districts and was funded by the US government. The program consists of police officers who make visits to elementary school classrooms, warning children that drugs are harmful and should be refused. D.A.R.E. sought to educate children on how to resist peer pressure to take drugs. It also denounced alcohol, tobacco, graffiti, and tattoos as the results of peer pressure.

A series of scientific studies in the 1990s and 2000s cast doubt on the effectiveness of D.A.R.E., with some studies concluding the program was harmful or counterproductive. Years after its effectiveness was cast into doubt, the program remained popular among politicians and many members of the public, in part because of a common intuition that the program ought to work. Eventually, in the early 2000s, funding for the program was greatly reduced.

The program distributed t-shirts and other items branded with the D.A.R.E. logo and with anti-drug messages. These items were repurposed by drug culture as ironic statements starting in the 1990s.

Its American headquarters is in Inglewood, California. D.A.R.E. expanded to the United Kingdom in 1995. The program&#x27;s mascot is Daren the Lion.

==History and purpose==

D.A.R.E. program materials from 1991 describe it as &quot;a drug abuse prevention education program designed to equip elementary school children with skills for resisting peer pressure to experiment with tobacco, drugs, and alcohol.&quot; It was created as a part of the war on drugs in the United States, with the intention of reducing the demand for drugs through education that would make drug use unappealing. The program was conducted by uniformed police officers who visited classrooms.

The program was developed in 1983 on the initiative of Daryl Gates, chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, in collaboration with Harry Handler, superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District. A local program at first, D.A.R.E. spread rapidly in the 1980s. In 1988, Ronald Reagan proclaimed the first National D.A.R.E. Day. At the program&#x27;s height, it was in 75% of American school districts. It was funded by the federal government in the &quot;Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986&quot;, which mentions D.A.R.E. by name. In 2002, D.A.R.E. had an annual budget of over $10 million.
The curriculum consisted of the D.A.R.E. stunt car, and &#x27;B-rad&#x27; lectures on the harmful consequences of drug and alcohol use, how to refuse drugs, building self-esteem and support networks, and alternatives to drugs. Curriculum also condemned graffiti and tattoos because they were considered to be the result of peer pressure. These lessons were derived from SMART, an anti-drug program under development at the University of Southern California, but they were adapted to be delivered by police officers instead of educators. Officers were also encouraged to spend time with students informally, such as playing basketball or chatting with students over lunch. Officers would sometimes arrive in sports cars that police had seized from drug dealers, which was intended to demonstrate that drugs lead to losing coveted possessions.

Scientific studies cast doubt on the effectiveness of D.A.R.E. starting in the early 1990s, with many concluding that D.A.R.E. did nothing to reduce illicit drug use. One study found that D.A.R.E. students were actually more likely to use drugs. Yet the program remained popular among politicians and many members of the public for decades, in part because of a common intuitive judgment that the program should work. Funding for D.A.R.E. was greatly reduced in the 2000s because of its poor performance at reducing drug use, particularly following a General Accounting Office report in 2003 which found &quot;no significant differences in illicit drug use&quot; caused by D.A.R.E.

After decades of antagonism toward D.A.R.E. because of its ineffectiveness, the curriculum was changed starting in 2009. The new program is called &quot;Keepin&#x27; it REAL&quot; and focuses less on lectures and more on interactive activities, such as practicing refusal and saying no to pressure. It is now less explicitly focused on opposition to drugs, with the broader aim of teaching good decision-making.

===Use of children as informants===
Circa 2004, &quot;[c]hildren [were] asked to submit to D.A.R.E. police officers sensitive written questionnaires that can easily refer to the kids&#x27; homes&quot; and that &quot;a D.A.R.E. lesson [was] called &#x27;The Three R&#x27;s: Recognize, Resist, Report&#x27;&quot;, encouraging children to &quot;tell friends, teachers or police if they find drugs at home.&quot;

In addition, &quot;D.A.R.E. officers are encouraged to put a &#x27;D.A.R.E. Box&#x27; in every classroom, into which students may drop &#x27;drug information&#x27; or questions under the pretense of anonymity. Officers are instructed that if a student &#x27;makes a disclosure related to drug use,&#x27; the officer should report the information to further authorities, both school and police. This apparently applies whether the &#x27;drug use&#x27; was legal or illegal, harmless or harmful. In a number of communities around the country, students have been enlisted by the D.A.R.E. officer as informants against their parents.&quot; 

Circa 1995, parents compared D.A.R.E. to the late Weimar Republic, in its installation of &quot;uniformed, sometimes armed, agents of the state in classrooms to tell children what their attitudes ought to be, and to obtain information about family home life which may be of interest to the state&quot;.

In 1997, &quot;The Future of Freedom Foundation&quot; asserted that, &quot;In the official D.A.R.E. Implementation Guide, police officers are advised to be alert for signs of children who have relatives who use drugs. D.A.R.E. officers are first and foremost police officers and thus are duty-bound to follow up leads that might come to their attention through inadvertent or indiscreet comments by young children.&quot; As a result, children sometimes confide the names of people they suspect are illegally using drugs.

==Studies on effectiveness==

===1992 – Indiana University===
Researchers at Indiana University, commissioned by Indiana school officials in 1992, found that those who completed the D.A.R.E. program subsequently had significantly higher rates of hallucinogenic drug use than those not exposed to the program.

===1994 – RTI International===
In 1994, three RTI International scientists evaluated eight previous quantitative analyses on D.A.R.E.&#x27;s efficacy that were found to meet their requirements for rigor. The researchers found that D.A.R.E.&#x27;s long-term effect could not be determined, because the corresponding studies were &quot;compromised by severe control group attrition or contamination&quot;. However, the study concluded that in the short-term &quot;DARE imparts a large amount of information, but has little or no impact on students&#x27; drug use&quot;, and that much smaller, interactive programs were more effective.

After the 1994 Research Triangle Institute study, an article in the Los Angeles Times stated that the &quot;organization spent $41,000 to try to prevent widespread distribution of the RTI report and started legal action aimed at squelching the study&quot;. The director of publication of the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot; told &quot;USA Today&quot; that &quot;DARE has tried to interfere with the publication of this. They tried to intimidate us.&quot;

===1995 – California Department of Education===
In 1995, a report to the California Department of Education by Joel Brown, stated that none of California&#x27;s drug education programs worked, including D.A.R.E.: &quot;California&#x27;s drug education programs, D.A.R.E. being the largest of them, simply don&#x27;t work. More than 40 percent of the students told researchers they were &#x27;not at all&#x27; influenced by drug educators or programs. Nearly 70 percent reported neutral to negative feelings about those delivering the anti-drug message. While only 10 percent of elementary students responded to drug education negatively or indifferently, this figure grew to 33 percent of middle school students and topped 90 percent at the high school level.&quot; In some circles, educators and administrators have admitted that D.A.R.E., in fact, potentially increased students&#x27; exposure and knowledge of unknown drugs and controlled substances, resulting in experimentation and consumption of narcotics at a much younger age. Criticism focused on failure and misuse of taxpayer dollars, with either ineffective or negative results state-wide. 
===1998 – National Institute of Justice===
In 1998, a grant from the National Institute of Justice to the University of Maryland resulted in a report to the NIJ, which among other statements, concluded that &quot;D.A.R.E. does not work to reduce substance use.&quot; D.A.R.E. expanded and modified the social competency development area of its curriculum in response to the report. Research by Dr. Dennis Rosenbaum in 1998 found that D.A.R.E. graduates were more likely than others to drink alcohol, smoke tobacco and use illegal drugs. Psychologist Dr. William Colson asserted in 1998 that D.A.R.E. increased drug awareness so that &quot;as they get a little older, they (students) become very curious about these drugs they&#x27;ve learned about from police officers.&quot; The scientific research evidence in 1998 indicated that the officers were unsuccessful in preventing the increased awareness and curiosity from being translated into illegal use. The evidence suggested that, by exposing young impressionable children to drugs, the program was, in fact, encouraging and nurturing drug use. Studies funded by the National Institute of Justice in 1998, and the California Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Office in 2000 also concluded that the program was ineffective.

===1999 – Lynam &quot;et al.&quot;===
A ten-year study was completed by Donald R. Lynam and colleagues in 2006 involving one thousand D.A.R.E. graduates in an attempt to measure the effects of the program. After the ten-year period, no measurable effects were noted. The researchers compared levels of alcohol, cigarette, marijuana and the use of illegal substances before the D.A.R.E. program (when the students were in sixth grade) with the post-D.A.R.E. levels (when they were 20 years old). Although there were some measured effects shortly after the program on the attitudes of the students towards drug use, these effects did not seem to carry on long-term.

=== 2001 – Office of the Surgeon General===
In 2001, the Surgeon General of the United States, David Satcher, placed the D.A.R.E. program in the category of &quot;Ineffective Primary Prevention Programs&quot;. The U.S. General Accounting Office concluded in 2003 that the program was sometimes counterproductive in some populations, with those who graduated from D.A.R.E. later having higher than average rates of drug use (a boomerang effect).

===2007 – &quot;Perspectives on Psychological Science&quot;===
In March 2007, the D.A.R.E. program was placed on a list of treatments that have the potential to cause harm in clients in the APS journal, &quot;Perspectives on Psychological Science&quot;.

===2009 – Texas A&amp;M===

&quot;The Social Construction of &#x27;Evidence-Based&#x27; Drug Prevention Programs: A Reanalysis of Data from the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) Program,&quot; Evaluation Review, Vol. 33, No.4, 394–414 (2009). Studies by Dave Gorman and Carol Weiss argue that the D.A.R.E. program has been held to a higher standard than other youth drug prevention programs. Gorman writes, &quot;what differentiates DARE from many of the programs on evidence-based lists might not be the actual intervention but rather the manner in which data analysis is conducted, reported, and interpreted.&quot; Dennis M. Gorman and J. Charles Huber Jr.

The U.S. Department of Education prohibits any of its funding to be used to support drug prevention programs that have not been able to demonstrate their effectiveness. Accordingly, D.A.R.E. America, in 2004, instituted a major revision of its curriculum.

The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) identified alternative start-up regional programs, none of which have longevity nor have they been subjected to intense scrutiny.

==Reception==

The D.A.R.E. program is consistent with the &quot;zero-tolerance orthodoxy of current U.S. drug control policy.&quot; According to researcher D. M. Gorman of the Rutgers University Center of Alcohol Studies, it supports the ideology and the &quot;prevailing wisdom that exists among policy makers and politicians.&quot;

It also claims to meet the needs of stake holders such as school districts, parents, and law enforcement agencies. &quot;DARE America also has been very successful in marketing its program to the news media through a carefully orchestrated public relations campaign that highlights its popularity while downplaying criticism.&quot;

Psychologists at the University of Kentucky concluded that &quot;continued enthusiasm [for DARE] shows Americans&#x27; stubborn resistance to apply science to drug policy.&quot;

Marsha Rosenbaum, who headed the West Coast office of the Lindesmith Center, a drug policy reform organization, provided an opinion for a 1999 Village Voice article, &quot;In D.A.R.E.&#x27;s worldview, Marlboro Light cigarettes, Bacardi rum, and a drag from a joint are all equally dangerous. For that matter, so is snorting a few lines of cocaine.&quot; D.A.R.E. &quot;isn&#x27;t really education. It&#x27;s indoctrination.&quot; The article also stated, &quot;Part of what makes DARE so popular is that participants get lots of freebies. There are fluorescent yellow pens with the DARE logo, tiny DARE dolls, bumper stickers, graduation certificates, DARE banners for school auditoriums, DARE rulers, pennants, DARE coloring books, and T-shirts for all DARE graduates.&quot;

D.A.R.E. has failed to fact check some articles on their website, promoting one news piece that was satire, titled &quot;Edible Marijuana Candies Kill 9 in Colorado, 12 at Coachella.&quot;

===Responses to criticism===

==== Motivation of the critics ====
D.A.R.E. America has generally dismissed many criticisms and independent studies of its program, labeling them false, misleading, or biased. &quot;DARE has long dismissed criticism of its approach as flawed or the work of groups that favor decriminalization of drug use,&quot; according to the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2001. In a press release titled &quot;Pro-drug Groups Behind Attack on Prevention Programs; DARE Seen as Target as Mayors&#x27; Conference Called to Combat Legalization Threat,&quot; D.A.R.E. asserted that pro-drug legalization individuals and groups were behind criticisms of the program, which were portrayed as based on &quot;vested interests&quot; and &quot;to support various individual personal agendas at the expense of our children.&quot;

D.A.R.E. has attacked critics for allegedly being motivated by their financial self-interest in programs that compete with D.A.R.E. It has charged that &quot;they are setting out to find ways to attack our programs and are misusing science to do it. The bottom line is that they don&#x27;t want police officers to do the work because they want it for themselves.&quot; Critics have also been dismissed as being jealous of D.A.R.E.&#x27;s success.

==== Rebuttal of statistics ====

Ronald J. Brogan, New York City&#x27;s D.A.R.E. fundraiser and spokesman, said in 1999 &quot;If you take German for 17 weeks, you&#x27;re not going to speak German. The critics say the effect dissipates over the years. No shit, Sherlock.&quot; The article in which he was quoted observed that &quot;DARE officials say the solution to this problem is not less DARE but more of it, and they urge cities to teach DARE in middle and high school.&quot;

One leader explained that &quot;I don&#x27;t have any statistics for you. Our strongest numbers are the numbers that don&#x27;t show up.&quot; The 1998 University of Maryland report presented to the U.S. National Institute of Justice stated, &quot;Officials of DARE America are often quoted as saying that the strong public support for the program is a better indicator of its utility than scientific studies.&quot;

====New curriculum ====

In 2009, D.A.R.E. adopted the &quot;keepin&#x27; it REAL&quot; curriculum. Rather than solely focusing on the perils of alcohol and other drugs, &quot;keepin&#x27; it REAL&quot; developed a 10-lesson curriculum that included aspects of European American, Mexican American, and African American culture integrated with culturally based narration and performance. The program was developed by Penn State researchers, who evaluated its effectiveness, though critics contend the program does not implement a long-term evaluation system.

In 2013, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ranked its &quot;readiness for dissemination&quot; at 1.5 out of 4. Two field randomized controlled trials showed the effectiveness of the multicultural &quot;keepin&#x27; it REAL&quot; for reducing substance use across grade levels and ethnic/racial groups, which highlights the importance of grounding substance use prevention programs in their audiences&#x27; cultural attitudes, values, norms, and beliefs. The second study &quot;evaluated onset of drug use across and within ethnic groups and the ideal times to intervene&quot; finding &quot;a double dose of intervention in elementary and middle school was no more effective than middle school intervention alone.&quot;

Following the passing of Washington Initiative 502 that legalized cannabis consumption in Washington state, the D.A.R.E. program was changed in the state to remove cannabis messages from their year 5 curriculum, arguing &quot;research has found that teaching children about drugs with which they have never heard of or have no real life understanding may stimulate their interest or curiosity about the substance.&quot;

===Ironic response===

T-shirts and other merchandise reading &quot;D.A.R.E. To Keep Kids Off Drugs&quot; became popular as an ironic item in drug culture and other countercultures starting in the 1990s. According to a report from &quot;Vice&quot;, the program&#x27;s appealing logo and acronym may unintentionally suggest one should dare to experiment with drugs. Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in a 2022 tweet referred to his sporting of the T-Shirt in 2019 with &quot;What are you all wearing for Halloween this year?&quot;

<text>Rahul (Pāli) or Rāhula (Sanskrit; born ) was the only son of Siddhārtha Gautama, commonly known as the Buddha, and his wife, princess Yaśodharā. He is mentioned in numerous Buddhist texts, from the early period onward. Accounts about Rāhula indicate a mutual impact between Prince Siddhārtha&#x27;s life and the lives of his family members. According to the Pāli tradition, Rāhula was born on the day of Prince Siddhārtha&#x27;s renunciation, and was therefore named &quot;Rāhula&quot;, meaning a fetter on the path to enlightenment. According to the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, and numerous other later sources, however, Rāhula was only on the day of Prince Siddhartha&#x27;s renunciation, and was born six years later, when Prince Siddhārtha became enlightened as the Buddha. This long gestation period was explained by bad karma from previous lives of both Yaśodharā and of Rāhula himself, although more naturalistic reasons are also given. As a result of the late birth, Yaśodharā needed to prove that Rāhula was really Prince Siddhārtha&#x27;s son, which she eventually did successfully by an act of truth. Historian H.W. Schumann has argued that Prince Siddhārtha conceived Rāhula and waited for his birth, to be able to leave the palace with the king and queen&#x27;s permission, but Orientalist Noël Péri considered it more likely that Rāhula was born after Prince Siddhārtha left his palace.

12 years after Rahula&#x27;s birth, the Buddha returned to his hometown, where Yaśodharā had Rāhula ask the Buddha for the throne of the Śākya clan. The Buddha responded by having Rāhula ordained as the first Buddhist novice monk. He taught the young novice about truth, self-reflection, and not-self, eventually leading to Rāhula&#x27;s enlightenment. Although early accounts state that Rāhula died before the Buddha did, later tradition has it that Rāhula was one of the disciples that outlived the Buddha, guarding the Buddha&#x27;s Dispensation until the rising of the next Buddha. Rāhula is known in Buddhist texts for his eagerness for learning, and was honored by novice monks and nuns throughout Buddhist history. His accounts have led to a perspective in Buddhism of seeing children as hindrances to the spiritual life on the one hand, and as people with potential for enlightenment on the other hand.

== Accounts ==
Some early texts such as those of the Pāli tradition do not mention Rāhula at all; but he is mentioned in later Pāli texts such as the Apadāna and the commentaries, as well as in the texts on monastic discipline of the Mūlasarvāstivāda and Mahāsaṇghika traditions. Earliest texts do not describe Rāhula in much detail, and he remains an ideal figure without much depth in character. Because of the lack of detail, especially after Rāhula&#x27;s ordination, some scholars have argued Rāhula did not have an important role in Buddhism. Apart from the early texts, there are many post-canonical Buddhist texts that contain accounts about Rāhula. The accounts about Rāhula reveal that when Prince Siddhārtha left his palace to become a monk; his decision and subsequent spiritual quest was not just a personal matter, but also affected his family every step during the way, as they responded to and affected the prince on his path to enlightenment. Thus, the prince&#x27;s life before enlightenment is about two parallel spiritual lives, that of the Buddha and that of his family.

=== Birth ===
==== Pāli tradition ====

Rāhula was born on same day Prince Siddhārtha Gautama renounced the throne by leaving the palace, when the prince was 29 years old, on the full moon day of the eight lunar month of the ancient Indian calendar. That day, Prince Siddhārtha was preparing himself to leave the palace. The Pāli account claims that when he received the news of his son&#x27;s birth he replied &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;A &quot;rāhu&quot; is born, a fetter has arisen&quot;, that is, an impediment to the search for enlightenment. Accordingly, Śuddhodana, Prince Siddhārtha&#x27;s father and king of the Śākya clan, named the child &quot;Rāhula&quot;, because he did not want his son to pursue a spiritual life as a mendicant. In some versions, Prince Siddhārtha was the one naming his son this way, for being a hindrance on his spiritual path. Just before the prince left the palace for the spiritual life, he took one look at his wife Yaśodharā and his just-born child. Fearing his resolve might waver, Prince Siddhārtha resisted to hold his son and left the palace as he had planned. Rāhula therefore became Prince Siddhārtha&#x27;s first and only son.

==== Other traditions ====
Other texts derive &quot;rāhu&quot; differently. For example, the Pāli &quot;Apadāna&quot;, as well as another account found in the texts of monastic discipline of the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, derive &quot;rāhu&quot; from the eclipse of the moon, which traditionally was seen to be caused by the asura (demon) Rāhu. The &quot;Apadāna&quot; states that just like the moon is obstructed from view by Rāhu, Prince Siddhārtha was obstructed by Rāhula&#x27;s birth. The Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition relates, however, that Rāhula was conceived on the evening of the renunciation of Prince Siddhārtha, and born six years later, on the day that his father achieved enlightenment, which was during a lunar eclipse. Further credence is given to the astrological theory of Rāhula&#x27;s name by the observation that sons of previous Buddhas were given similar names, related to constellations.

Mūlasarvāstivāda and later Chinese texts such as the &quot;Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra&quot; give two types of explanation for the long gestation period. The first type involves the karma of Princess Yaśodharā and Rāhula himself. According to this interpretation, Yaśodharā had to bear the suffering of carrying a child in her womb for six years, because in a previous life as a cow herder she had refused to help her mother to carry a pail of milk and left it for her mother to carry the extra pail for six leagues. As for Rāhula, his karma was that in a previous life as a king he unintentionally had a sage wait for six days. In this life, he was a king called Sūrya and his brother, a previous life of the Buddha, was a hermit called Candra or Likhita who had taken a vow he would only live from what was given by people. One day, the brother broke his vow to take some water, and feeling guilty, asked the king to punish him. The king refused to issue a punishment for such a trivial matter, but had his brother wait for his final decision and constrained in the royal gardens. After six days, the king suddenly realized he had forgotten about the hermit and immediately set him free, including apologies and gifts. As a result, Rāhula had to wait for six years before being born. In some versions, the king did not allow a sage to enter his kingdom and accumulated the same bad karma of a long gestation period. The later Mahāyāna commentary &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa&quot; () does not blame Yaśodharā&#x27;s karma for the six years gestation period, but does mention Rāhula&#x27;s same karma as a king. However, in the 13th-century Japanese devotional text &quot;Raun Kōshiki&quot;, Rāhula&#x27;s late birth is seen as evidence of a miracle, rather than a result of karma.

The second type of explanation consists of the more naturalistic argument that Yaśodharā was practicing religious austerities involving fasting and sleeping on a straw bed, which caused Rāhula&#x27;s growth to slow down. She was involved in these practices during the time when Siddhārtha was practicing self-mortification. Later, King Śuddhodana prevented Yaśodharā from hearing any news of her former husband, and she gradually became healthier, as the pregnancy continued normally. However, some time later, the false rumor spread that the former prince had died of his ascetism. Yaśodharā became very desperate and depressed, endangering her own pregnancy. When the news reached the palace that Siddhārtha had attained enlightenment, Yaśodharā was overjoyed and gave birth to Rāhula. Buddhist Studies scholar John S. Strong notes that this account draws a parallel between the quest for enlightenment and Yaśodharā&#x27;s path to being a mother, and eventually, they both are accomplished at the same time.

The late childbirth leads to doubts in the Śākya clan as to who is the father, as told in the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, in the &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa&quot; and in the later Chinese &quot;Zabaozang jing&quot; (). Since Rāhula&#x27;s birth was not regarded by Buddhists to be a virginal or miraculous birth, tradition had to explain that Prince Siddhārtha was actually the father. Yaśodharā responded by putting her child on a stone in a pond of water and making an act of truth that if Rāhula really was his child, that Rāhula and the stone may not sink, but rather float back-and-forth. After she made the declaration, the child floated according to her vow. Strong notes that this is a symbolic parallel with the attainment of enlightenment by the Buddhadescribed as the &quot;further shore&quot;and the return to teach humankind. The &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa&quot; contains another account, in which Prince Siddhārtha has several wives, and a wife other than Yaśodharā is the one defending her, being witness of her purity in conduct.

Furthermore, in both the Mūlasarvāstivāda texts and the &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa&quot;, there is a third account that proves Yaśodharā&#x27;s purity in conduct: in this version, the Buddha made everyone around him look identical to him, through a supernatural accomplishment. Rāhula proved that the Buddha was his true father when he managed to approach the real Buddha straight away. In a fourth story about proving Yaśodhara&#x27;s purity, appearing in Chinese Avadāna-style texts from the 5th century CE onward, she was burnt alive, but miraculously survived. In this account, King Śuddhodana ordered that she be killed by burning her alive as punishment for her alleged impurity. Instead of being hurt by the flames, however, she performed an act of truth and the fire transformed into a pond of water. Śuddhodana welcomed her and her son back into the clan, and later became very fond of Rāhula. Some Chinese Jātakas say that he recognized his son Siddhārtha in the child, and managed to better cope with the loss of Prince Siddhārtha. Religion scholar Reiko Ohnuma sees the fire ordeal as a metaphor that parallels the Buddha&#x27;s enlightenment, a similar argument that Strong makes.

==== Scholarly analysis ====
Historians Mircea Eliade and H.W. Schumann hypothesized that Prince Siddhārtha conceived Rāhula to please his parents, to obtain their permission for leaving the palace and becoming a mendicant. It was an Indian custom to renounce the world only after the birth of a child or grandchild. Schumann further speculated that the prince only conceived a son thirteen years after his marriage, because Yaśodharā initially did not want to bear a child, for fear that the prince would leave the palace and the throne as soon as the child was conceived. Orientalist Noël Péri believed, however, that a late gestation period was more historically probable than the birth on the same day, as in the Pāli tradition. He believed that if Prince Siddhārtha had left an heir to the throne, there would have been no sound reason for him to leave secretly at night. In many traditional biographies, Prince Siddhārtha is described leaving the palace without his parents&#x27; permission. Péri argued that this makes little sense if he had already provided an heir to his parents&#x27; satisfaction. He further argued that there are many sources that try to explain the long gestation period, indicating an established tradition. Nevertheless, although many traditional accounts of the Buddha&#x27;s life relate that Siddhartha leaves the palace in secret, Early Buddhist Texts clearly state that his parents are aware of his choice, as they are said to weep at the time their son leaves them.

From a mythological and text critical point of view, Buddhist Studies scholar Kate Crosby argues that Prince Siddhārtha conceiving or giving birth to a son before his renunciation functions as a motif to prove that he was the best at each possible path in life: after having tried the life of a father to the fullest, he decided to leave it behind for a better alternative. In early Buddhist India, being a father and bearing a son was seen as a spiritual and religious path as well as that of renouncing one&#x27;s family, and Prince Siddhārtha&#x27;s bringing a son in the world before renunciation proves he was capable of both. Buddhist studies scholar John S. Strong hypothesizes that the Mūlasarvāstivāda version of the story of the prince conceiving a child on the eve of his departure was developed to prove that the Buddha was not physically disabled in some way. A disability might have raised doubts about the validity of his ordination in monastic tradition.

=== Ordination ===

The accounts continue and describe that Rāhula was raised by his mother Yaśodharā and grandfather King Śuddhodana. When Rāhula was between seven and fifteen years old, the Buddha returned to his home city of Kapilavastu at the request of Śuddhodana. The Mahāvastu text from the Lokottaravāda tradition states that the royals tried to prevent Rāhula from learning about the return of his father, but eventually he insisted to know who the &quot;Great Ascetic&quot; about to arrive was, and he was told. Next, the Mahāvastu and the Mūlasarvāstivāda texts relate that Yaśodharā tried to tempt the Buddha back into his life as a prince by having Rāhula offer the Buddha an aphrodisiac. Mūlasarvāstivāda texts continue and tell that her plan backfired when the Buddha had Rāhula eat it himself, and Rāhula therefore became enamored by his father and wished to follow him. In the Pāli version of the story, on the seventh day of the Buddha&#x27;s return, Yaśodharā took Rāhula to see his father, the Buddha. She told Rāhula that since his father had renounced the palace life and as he was the next royal prince in line, he should ask his father for his inheritance of crown and treasure. This would be for his future sake when his grandfather would no longer rule the kingdom. After the Buddha had a meal, Rāhula followed the Buddha and asked him for his inheritance. The Buddha did not try to prevent Rāhula from following him, but in some versions of the story, some women from the court did try to, yet Rāhula persisted. He then looked at his father and says, &quot;Pleasant is your shadow, recluse&quot;. After Rāhula reached the Park of Nigrodha, where the Buddha was staying, the Buddha considered that the heritage of the throne would one day perish, and was tied up with suffering and stress: &quot;I will give him the wealth I obtained under the tree of enlightenment thus making him the heir of an inheritance that does not perish.&quot;

Most traditions relate that the Buddha then called Śāriputra and asked him to ordain Rāhula. Rāhula was ordained, becoming the first &quot;śrāmaṇera&quot; (novice monk), and probably the first person in the monastic order to receive ordination in a formal way. In some versions of the story, such as the 9th-century Chinese &quot;Weicengyou Yinyuan Jing&quot; (), a group of young boys were ordained together with him. The king discovered that his grandson, his son Nanda and a number of other young men in the royal family had then received ordination and left the palace. Seeing his daughter grieve, he asked the Buddha that from now on, he only ordain people with the consent of their parents. Śuddhodana explained that Rāhula&#x27;s ordination was a great shock to him. The Buddha assented to the proposal. This rule was later expanded in the case of women ordaining, as both parents and the husband had to give permission first to allow women to join the order of monks and nuns. In some versions of the story of Rāhula&#x27;s ordination, Yaśodharā also protested, but relented in the end. The Mahāvastu states, however, that Rāhula asked to ordain himself, and was eventually granted permission by Yaśodharā and Śuddhodana.

Archaeologist Maurizio Taddei has noted that in many Gandhāran art depictions, Rāhula&#x27;s life is linked to that of a previous life of the Buddha, the hermit Sumedha. The Buddha giving his spiritual heritage to his son is compared to that of Sumedha allowing the Buddha Dīpaṃkara to walk over him, which was followed by Dipaṃkara predicting that Sumedha will become a Buddha in a future life. Both the figure of Gautama Buddha giving his inheritance to his son, and the figure of Dīpaṃkara Buddha giving his inheritance of Buddhahood to Sumedha are depicted with flames emitting from their bodies; both scenes are depictions of inheritance, filial and disciple piety; both may have been considered by 5th-century Buddhists to be representations of &quot;eager youth&quot;.

=== Enlightenment and death ===

According to the Pāli texts, once Rāhula had become novice, the Buddha taught Rāhula regularly. His instructions were very age-specific, using vivid metaphors and simple explanations. The Buddha&#x27;s teachings have led to numerous discourses being named after Rāhula in the Early Buddhist Texts. Pāli texts relate how Rāhula grew up to become a novice that was diligent, dutiful, amenable and eager for learning, but there are also some early medieval Chinese and Japanese accounts which relate that Rāhula initially struggled with being a novice and only later appreciated the Buddha&#x27;s teaching. Besides the Buddha, Śāriputra and Maugalyayāna also helped to teach Rāhula. Rāhula often assisted Śāriputra on his rounds for alms in the morning, and sometimes on other travels. Every morning, Rāhula woke up and threw a handful of sand in the air, making the wish that he may be counselled by good teachers as much as those grains of sand.

Still in the same year as Rāhula&#x27;s ordination, the Buddha taught his son the importance of telling the truth in a discourse known as the &quot;Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta&quot;. In this discourse, the Buddha taught and encouraged consistent self-reflection, to help let go of all evil actions that lead to harm to oneself and others, and to develop self-control and a moral life. He encouraged reflection before, during and after one&#x27;s actions, and explained that lying makes the spiritual life void and empty, leading to many other evils.

When Rāhula became eighteen years old, the Buddha instructed Rāhula in a meditation technique to counter the desires that hinder him during his tours for alms. Rāhula had grown enamored with his own and his father&#x27;s handsome appearance. To help Rāhula, the Buddha taught another discourse to him. He told Rāhula that all matter is not-self, and the same held for the different parts of one&#x27;s mental experience. Having heard the discourse, Rāhula started to practice meditation. His teacher Śāriputra recommended him to practice breathing meditation, but was unable to give Rāhula the instructions he needed. Rāhula therefore asked the Buddha to explain the meditation method in more detail and the Buddha responded by describing several meditation techniques to him. On a similar note, the Buddha taught Rāhula at a place called Andhavana about the impermanence of all things, and instructed him how to overcome the &quot;taints&quot; inside the mind. As a result, Rāhula attained enlightenment. Pāli tradition has it that the sermon was also attended by a crore of heavenly beings, who once had vowed to witness the enlightenment of the son of the Buddha. Rāhula obtained the name &quot;Rāhula the Lucky&quot; (; ), which he himself explained was because of being the son of the Buddha, and because of having attained enlightenment.

Later, the Buddha declared that Rāhula was foremost among all disciples in eagerness in learning (). and in the Pāli Udāna, the Buddha included him as one of eleven particularly praiseworthy disciples. Chinese sources add that he was also known for his patience, and that he was foremost in &#x27;practicing with discretion&#x27; (), meaning practicing the Buddha&#x27;s teaching consistently, dedication to the precepts and study, but without seeking praise or being proud because of being the son of the Buddha. Pāli texts give examples of Rāhula&#x27;s strictness in monastic discipline. E.g. after there was a rule established that no novice could sleep in the same room as a fully ordained monk, Rāhula was said to have slept in an outdoor toilet. When the Buddha became aware of this, he admonished the monks for not taking proper care of the novices. After that, the Buddha adjusted the rule.

Pāli texts state that despite Rāhula being his son, the Buddha did not particularly favor him: he is said to have loved problematic disciples such as Aṅgulimāla and Devadatta as much as his own son, without any bias. Schumann writes that the Buddha&#x27;s relationship with his son was &quot;... trusting and friendly, but not cordial or intimate&quot;, in order to prevent attachment in the monastic life. Schumann concludes that the Buddha&#x27;s discourses to his son were essentially not different in nature from those he gave to his other disciples.

Later in Rāhula&#x27;s life his mother Yaśodharā became ordained as a nun. In one story, the nun Yaśodharā fell ill with flatulence. Rāhula helped her recover by asking his teacher Śāriputra to find sweetened mango juice for her, which was the medicine she was used to and required. Therefore, with Rāhula&#x27;s help, she eventually recovered.

When he was 20 years old, Rāhula fully ordained as a monk in Sāvatthī.

Rāhula&#x27;s death receives little attention in the earliest sources. Rāhula died before the Buddha and his teacher Śariputra did. According to Pāli and Chinese sources, this happened as he was travelling psychically through the second Buddhist heaven (). According to the early &quot;Ekottara Āgama&quot; (Sārvastivāda or Mahāsaṅghika tradition) and the later &quot;Śāriputrapṛcchā&quot;, however, Rāhula was one of the four enlightened disciples whom Gautama Buddha asked to prolong their lives to stay in the world until the next Buddha Maitreya has risen, to protect his dispensation.

=== Previous lives ===
Following the Pāli and Sanskrit language sources, Rāhula was the son of the Buddha-to-be throughout many lifetimes. He developed his habit of being amenable and easy to teach in previous lives. Pāli texts explain that in a previous life he was impressed by the son of a previous Buddha, and vowed to be like him in a future life.

== Legacy ==

Texts in the Mahayāna tradition describe that Rāhula is the eleventh of the 16 Elders (; Chinese tradition added two elders in the 10th century, making for 18 Elders), enlightened disciples that have been entrusted with taking care of the Buddha&#x27;s dispensation until the rising of Maitreya Buddha. Tradition states therefore that Rāhula will be alive until the next Buddha, and until that time resides with 1,100 of his pupils in an island called the &#x27;land of chestnuts and grains&#x27; (). The pilgrim Xuan Zang (602664) heard a brahmin claim that he met Rāhula as an old man, who had delayed his passing into Nirvana and was therefore still alive. On a similar note, Rāhula is considered one of the Ten Principal Disciples, known for his dedication to training new monks and novices. Moreover, he is considered to be one of the 2328 masters in the lineage of the Tiantai tradition, one of the 28 in the Chan lineage, and one of the eight enlightened disciples in the Burmese tradition.

As one of the enlightened disciples responsible for protecting the Buddha&#x27;s dispensation, Rāhula has often been depicted in East Asian art. He is depicted with a large, &quot;umbrella-shaped&quot; head, prominent eyes and a hooked nose.

The Chinese monks Xuan Zang and Faxian (320420 CE) noted during their pilgrimages in India that a cult existed that worshiped Rāhula, especially in the Madhura area. Whereas monks would worship certain early male disciples following their particular specialization, and nuns would honor Ānanda in gratitude for helping to set up the nun&#x27;s order, novices would worship Rāhula. The two Chinese pilgrims noted that Emperor Aśoka built a monument in honor of Rāhula, especially meant for novices to pay their respects. Religious studies scholar Lori Meeks points out with regard to Japan, however, that Rāhula was not the individual object of any devotional cult, but was rather honored as part of a group of enlightened disciples, such as the 16 Elders. Exception to this was the 13th14th century, when the figure of Rāhula became an important part of a revival of devotion to early Buddhist disciples among the old Nara schools, as chanted lectures (&quot;kōshiki&quot;) rites, and images were used in dedication to Rāhula. On regular days of religious observance, male and female novices performed rites and gave lectures in honor of Rāhula. These were popular with the laypeople, as well as with priests that aimed to revive Indian Buddhism, in particular early Buddhist monastic discipline. In the &quot;kōshiki&quot; Rāhula was praised extensively, and was described as the &quot;Eldest Child&quot;, &quot;eldest&quot; being a devotional term, since Prince Siddhārtha had no other children. Thus, the person of Rāhula became an object of devotion and inspiration for monks who wished to observe monastic discipline well.

The &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;, as well as later East Asian texts such as the &quot;Raun Kōshiki&quot;, relate that Gautama Buddha predicts Rāhula will become a Buddha in a future life, named &quot;Stepping on Seven Treasure Flowers&quot; (). In these texts, Rāhula is seen as a Mahāyāna type of Buddha-to-be, who would save many sentient beings and lives in a Pure Land.

The exhortations the Buddha gives to Rāhula have also become part of his legacy. The &quot;Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta&quot; became one of the seven Buddhist texts recommended for study in the inscriptions of the Emperor Aśoka. This discourse has been raised by modern ethicists as evidence for consequentalist ethics in Buddhism, though this is disputed.

Rāhula is mentioned as one of the founders of a system of Buddhist philosophy called the &quot;Vaibhāṣika&quot;, which was part of the Sarvāstivāda schools. He is also considered by some Thai schools of Buddhist &quot;borān&quot; meditation to be the patron of their tradition, which is explained by referring to Rāhula&#x27;s gradual development in meditation as opposed to the instant enlightenment of other disciples.

=== Childhood in Buddhism ===

From the narratives surrounding Rāhula several conclusions have been drawn with regard to Buddhist perspectives on childhood. Several scholars have raised Rāhula&#x27;s example to indicate that children in Buddhism are seen as an obstacle to spiritual enlightenment, or that Buddhism, being a monastic religion, is not interested in children. Education scholar Yoshiharu Nakagawa argues, however, that Rāhula&#x27;s story points at two ideals of childhood which exist parallel in Buddhism: that of the common child, subject to the human condition, and that of the child with a potential for enlightenment, who Crosby describes as a heroic disciple. Religion scholar Vanessa Sasson notes that although Prince Siddhārtha initially abandons his son, he comes back for him and offers a spiritual heritage to him as opposed to a material one. This heritage is given from a viewpoint of trust in the potential of the child Rāhula, presuming that the Buddhist path can also be accessed by children.

The acceptance of Rāhula in the monastic order as a child set a precedent, which later developed into a widespread Buddhist tradition of educating children in monasteries. The numerous teachings given to Rāhula have left behind teaching material which could be used for teaching children of different ages, and were sophisticated for the time period with regard to their age-specific material. Theravāda tradition further built on this genre, with Pāli manuals of religious teaching for novices. Writing about the Buddha&#x27;s teachings methods used for Rahula, psychologist Kishani Townshend argues &quot;... Buddha&#x27;s use of Socratic questioning, poetic devices and role modelling are still relevant to developing virtue in today&#x27;s children.&quot;

<text>Ostroh (, ; ) is a city in Rivne Oblast, western Ukraine. It is situated on the Horyn River. Ostroh was the administrative center of Ostroh Raion until 2020, but as a city of oblast significance did not belong to the raion. Currently the city is the centre of Ostroh urban hromada. Population: 

The Ostroh Academy was established here in 1576, the first higher educational institution in modern Ukraine. Furthermore, in the 16th century, the first East Slavic books, notably the Ostrog Bible, were printed there.

==History==

The Hypatian Codex first mentions Ostroh in 1100, as a fortress of the Volhynian princes. Since the 14th century, it was the seat of the powerful Ostrogski princely family, who developed their town into a great centre of learning and commerce. Upon the family&#x27;s demise in the 17th century, Ostroh passed to the Zasławski and then Lubomirski families.

In the second half of the 14th century, Ostroh, together with the whole of Volhynia, was administratively integrated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Following the Union of Lublin (1569), the town became part of the Kingdom of Poland. Administratively it was located in the Volhynian Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province. Ostroh, known in Polish as Ostróg, received Magdeburg rights in 1585. In the 17th century, the town was surrounded by fortifications, with a moat, a rampart with five bastions. In 1609–1753, it was the capital of the Ostrogski family fee tail, founded by Voivode Janusz Ostrogski, who invited Bernardine monks to Ostróg. Furthermore, the town had a Calvinist academy; among its lecturers was Andrzej Wegierski.

During the Khmelnytsky Uprising, the town was torched by the Cossacks, and its Jewish residents were brutally murdered. The &quot;Great Maharsha Synagogue&quot;, built in 1627, was damaged during this period. Ostróg slowly recovered, and in the second half of the 18th century, it became the site of a Jesuit college (see Collegium Nobilium). In the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, the town was forcibly annexed by the Russian Empire, where it remained until 1918. Railroad lines, built in the 19th century, missed Ostróg, and as a result, the town stagnated. The railway station serving the area was built in 1873, 14km away, in the village of Ożenin.
In the interwar period, Ostróg belonged to the County of Zdołbunów, Volhynian Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic. It was an important garrison town for the Polish Army, and the Border Protection Corps (KOP). The KOP Battalion &quot;Ostróg&quot; was stationed there, along with the 19th Volhynian Uhlan Regiment. On July 7, 1920, during the Polish–Soviet War, it was the site of a battle between a Polish unit under Wincenty Krajowski, and the Bolsheviks of Semyon Budyonny&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Army. Throughout 1919–1939 Ostróg was located in close to the Polish–Soviet border, and special passes were required to enter some districts of the town.

Following the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland, Ostróg was annexed by the Soviet Union, as part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. An unknown number of the town&#x27;s residents were forcibly sent to Siberia. Local mayor Stanisław Ludwik Żurakowski was arrested by the Soviets, then held in several prisons in Volhynia, and eventually deported to Kozelsk and murdered in the Katyn massacre in April 1940.

The Nazi German occupation resulted in the establishment of the Reichskommissariat Ukraine (RKU), with headquarters in Rivne. In the autumn of 1941 several large-scale mass murders took place in Volhynia. On 1 September 1941 2,500 Jews were shot in Ostróg. Six weeks later, the ghetto was disbanded and another 3,000 people were killed in the Holocaust.

In 2022, an informal sister city arrangement was established with Beaufort, South Carolina in the United States in which the residents of Beaufort raised funds to support Ostroh during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Landmarks include Ostroh Castle on the Red Hill, with the church of the Epiphany (built in the fifteenth century) and several towers (Tatar Gate Tower and Roun &quot;New&quot; Tower). To the north-west from the castle stand two sixteenth-century towers. The suburb of Mezhirichi contains the Abbey of the Trinity, with a fifteenth-century cathedral and other ancient buildings.

<text>The Digital Averroes Research Environment (DARE), funded by the DFG, is a virtual research environment concerned with the works of Averroës or Abū l-Walīd Muḥammad Ibn Aḥmad Ibn Rušd.

DARE aims to provide scholars with the digitized manuscripts and incunables of Averroes&#x27;s works (around 60,000 as of April 2013), as well as edited full texts, where applicable in all three language traditions of Averroes&#x27;s works: Arabic, Hebrew and Latin. A comprehensive bibliography complements the corpus.

== Content ==
The aim of the Digital Averroes Research Environment is to collect and edit the works of Averroes by making digital editions of his works, and images of all textual witnesses, including manuscripts, incunabula, and early prints, online accessible. The main benefit of the DARE project is the so-called chunks. Each chunk represents a given section of a certain work of Averroes, which can be traced in each other manifestation. By clicking through the different digitized sections, the patched-in section follows automatically the chosen chunk.

== Technical background ==
Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) forms the backbone of DARE&#x27;s data. The structure of the texts, the manuscript descriptions, the bibliography and the chunks of the full texts are all encoded in TEI.
DARE itself runs in a Drupal-content management system (CMS), and the XML server is Xeletor, a highly scalable and performance-oriented XML server, whose development was also in part funded by DARE. As with all software developed in the course of the project, Xeletor is licensed under the LGPL.

<doc id="874201" wikidata="Q1569816" url="?curid=874201" title="Swedish slave trade">
<text>The Swedish slave trade mainly occurred in the early history of Sweden when the trade of &quot;thralls&quot; (Old Norse: &quot;þræll&quot;) was one of the pillars of the Norse economy from the 9th to the 11th century, and ended with the widespread adoption of Christianity in Sweden. Slavery was a deeply entrenched institution in Viking society which was hierarchical, and the lowest social class consisted of thralls and slaves, which made up the main source of hard labor in Norse society. Slavery itself was abolished in Sweden in 1335 by king Magnus Erikssson.

During the raids, the Vikings often captured and enslaved militarily weaker peoples they encountered through raids or conquests across Europe. This slave trade lasted from the 8th through the 11th centuries. 
A smaller trade of African slaves happened during the 17th and 18th centuries as part of the Atlantic slave trade, around the time Swedish overseas colonies were established in North America (New Sweden; 1638–1655) and in Africa (lasting between 1650 and 1663). Similarly to other European powers, slavery was banned in the motherland while being legal in the colonies. Consequently, slavery remained legal on the sole Swedish Caribbean colony of Saint Barthélemy from 1784 until 1847.

The Viking Age was a period of widespread upheaval and disruption throughout the northern world. Viking raiders sought captives, many of whom were captured and held in camps where they were ransomed, exploited and enslaved. The slaves from Western Europe during the Viking era were mainly Franks, Anglo-Saxons, and Celts. Many Irish slaves were used in expeditions for the colonization of Iceland. The Norse also took Baltic, Slavic in Northeastern and Eastern Europe, Latin slaves from Southern Europe, and Moorish slaves from Al-Andalus and North Africa. Vikings navigated the &quot;Highway of the Slaves&quot; through the Aegean Sea and into Black Sea ports first established by Archaic Greeks, shoreline crossroads for human trafficking. 

The Persian traveler Ibn Rustah described how Vikings, the Varangians or Rus, terrorized and enslaved the Slavs taken in their raids along the Volga River. These slaves were trafficked to the Middle East via the Bukhara slave trade.
Thralldom was outlawed in 1335 by Magnus IV of Sweden for thralls &quot;born by Christian parents&quot; in Västergötland and Värend, being the last parts where it had remained legal. This however, was only applicable within the borders of Sweden, which opened up for later slave trade in the colonies. Similarly to other European countries, slavery was later to be revived in Swedish territories outside of the European motherland.

In the 17th century, starting from 1650, Swedish citizens become involved with the Atlantic slave trade. Sweden set up trading stations along the West African coast with bases on the Swedish Gold Coast, which today belongs to Ghana. In 1663, the Swedish Gold Coast was taken over by the Denmark and became part of the Danish Gold Coast. During its dozen years of activity, the Swedish African company transported around 2,000 slaves. However, the Swedish establishments in West Africa declined after a few years, while the Danish ones continued until 1850. Between 1784 and 1878, Sweden maintained possession of a colony in the Caribbean. The Swedish colony of Saint Barthélemy functioned as a duty-free port and became a major destination center for slave ships. Slaves were brought in tax free by foreign vessels and the Swedish Crown made a profit by collecting an export tax when slaves were shipped out. Sweden was also a major supplier of iron for chains used in the slave trade. 
Slavery was legislated in Saint-Barthélemy under the &quot;Ordinance concerning the Police of Slaves and free Coloured People&quot; dated 30 July 1787, original in French dated 30 June 1787. In the autumn of 1786, the Swedish West India Company was established on the island. 

In the early 19th century, Sweden signed treaties with the United Kingdom and France to abolish the slave trade.
In 1847, slavery was abolished in all parts of Sweden by including her colony, on the basis of a decision taken in 1846. The last legally owned slaves in the Swedish colony of Saint-Barthélemy were bought and freed by the Swedish state on 9 October 1847.

== Migration period: Semi legend ==

Early Swedish history is not well documented and the sources are subjected to much scrutiny, especially since the trustworthiness of the Icelandic sagas is in doubt, since the Swedish monarchs mentioned by foreign sources do not correlate with the monarchs mentioned by Icelandic Sagas. During the Semi Legendary period, a slave revolt is mentioned by the Sagas taking place in Sweden. Its authenticity is unknown.

According to the Icelandic sagas, a slave revolt led by the slave Tunne resulted in the Swedish king Ongentheow being deposed and forced to flee to the Danes (Germanic tribe). The Swedish king Ongentheow, sometimes identified with Angan-Tys in the Beowulf, appear to be another version of the name Týs öttungr.
Tunne was described as the slave responsible for the guard of the royal treasury and weaponry. Tunne was probably named Eofor as both names mean boar and kennings was frequently used in old Norse and old English. Tunne could have been from the Northlands, as the name Tunne has only been found on Runestones in the Swedish Northlands.
The Swedish weaponry was indeed guarded by a slave, as mentioned by the Roman historian Tacitus. According to the saga, Tunne proclaimed himself king of Svitjod, the slaves taking the weapons from the royal weaponry, forced the royals and nobles to retrieve their ancestor&#x27;s swords and helmets from their graves in Gamla Uppsala to fight the slaves, while Tunne used the weapons from the royal weaponry to defeat the Swedish army in eight battles. The victories of the Tunnes rebels resulted in so many losses for the Swedish king that he was forced to promise the Danish king tribute to ensure his continued support.

The mounds from 500 AD lack weapons, after archaeological examination, supporting the story that weapons were taken from the grave tumulus during the rebellion. With the help of Danish soldiers, the slave uprising was eventually crushed. Tunne, however, killed king Ongenthow before the end of the uprising. In the Icelandic sagas, however, Ongenthow was killed by a boar. In Beowulf, he was killed by the warrior Eofor (who may be identical with Tunne). Eofor slew Ongenthow with his sword with a stab to the head that penetrated Ongenthows helmet. Eofor brought the helmet of Ongenthow to the geats, where he was given protection and rewarded for slaying their rival king. 
As a reward, Eofor was given the Geatish king Hygelac&#x27;s daughter in marriage. Eofor in all likelihood killed Ongenthow, however it is not certain that Eofor and Tunni was the same person.

== Swedish slavery and slave trade during the Middle Ages ==

Tasks for slaves in Sweden were helping with agricultural output for males and females, with women additionally serving as concubines or domestic servants. Thralls could have some social mobility in Norse society, as for example Olav Tyggvason, who went from captured slave of Estonians to king of Norway.

===Background===

Slavery was common in the Viking age period, and one of the main reasons for the Viking expansion was the search for slaves in other countries. One of the reasons Kievan Rus came to be was that Scandinavian settlers established themselves and traded with captured slaves. During the eighth to tenth centuries, slaves from Eastern Europe and the Baltic Sea were traded to elite households in Byzantium and the Islamic world via the Dnieper and Volga river systems, the Carolingian Empire and Venice. 
Arabic merchants from the Caspian Sea and Byzantine merchants from the Black Sea bought their goods to the trade markets in Rus, where they met the Viking traders and warriors known as Varangians, and traded their goods for the slaves captured by the Vikings in Europe.

The Vikings used the demand for slaves in the Southern slave markets in the Orthodox Byzantine Empire and the Islamic Middle Eastern Caliphate, both of whom craved slaves of a different religion than their own. 
During the Middle Ages, organized alongside religious principles. Both Christians and Muslims banned the enslavement of people of their own faith, but both approved of the enslavement of people of a different faith; both did allow the enslavement of people they regarded to be heretics, which allowed Catholic Christians to enslave Orthodox Christians, and Sunni Muslims to enslave Shia Muslims. However, both Christians and Muslims approved of enslaving Pagans, who came to be a preferred target of the slave trade in the Middle Ages, and Pagan war captives were sold by Pagan enemies into the slave trade.

===The Viking slave trade===
The Vikings trafficked European slaves captured in Viking raids in Europe in the East in two destinations from present day Russia via the Volga trade route; one to Slavery in the Abbasid Caliphate in the Middle East via the Caspian Sea, the Samanid slave trade and Iran; and one to the Byzantine Empire and the Mediterranean via Dnieper and the Black Sea slave trade.
Until the 9th-century, the Vikings trafficked Baltic and Finnic European slaves from the Baltic Sea in the Northeastern Europe via the Wisla or the Donau rivers South East through Europe to the Black Sea.
The Viking slave route was redirected in the 9th-century, and until the 11th-century the Vikings trafficked European slaves from the Baltic Sea via Ladoga, Novgorod and the Msta river via the Route from the Varangians to the Greeks to the Byzantine Empire via the Black Sea slave trade, or to the Abbasid Caliphate via the Caspian Sea (and the Bukhara slave trade) via the Volga trade route.

People taken captive during the Viking raids across Europe could be sold to Moorish Spain via the Dublin slave trade or transported to Hedeby or Brännö and from there via the Volga trade route to present day Russia, where slaves and furs were sold to Muslim merchants in exchange for Arab silver &quot;dirham&quot; and silk, which have been found in Birka, Wollin and Dublin; initially this trade route between Europe and the Abbasid Caliphate passed via the Khazar Kaghanate, but from the early 10th-century onward it went via Volga Bulgaria and from there by caravan to Khwarazm, to the Samanid slave market in Central Asia and finally via Iran to the Abbasid Caliphate.

Archbishop Rimbert of Bremen (d. 888) reported that he witnessed a &quot;large throng of captured Christians being hauled away&quot; in the Viking port of Hedeby in Denmark, one of whom was a woman who sang psalms to identify herself as a Christian nun, and who the bishop was able to free by exchanging his horse for her freedom.

This trade was the source of the Arab &quot;dirham&quot; silver hoards found in Scandinavia and functioned from at least 786 until 1009, when such coins have been found there, and it would have been so lucrative that it contributed to the continuing Viking raids across Eastern Europe, which was used by the Vikings as a slave supply source for this trade with the Islamic world. 
Among such hoards can be mentioned the Spillings Hoard and the Sundveda Hoard.

One of the only accounts describing Norse slave practices in detail and first person is the Arabic merchant Ibn Fadlan meeting Volga Vikings. Describing Swedish Vikings using the Volga trade route using Saqaliba or Slavic slaves as translators when trading. 
There he describes the Norse ship burials only known in Norse society before the Viking expansion in 800 AD into present day Russia and Ukraine and that a slave girl was sacrificed to follow her master. Norse burials found in Sweden and Norway indicate that slaves were sacrificed in Sweden to follow their masters to the afterlife. However, Swedish archaeology shows that mostly male slaves were killed to follow their master into the afterlife and not females. Sacrificed female slaves have however been found sacrificed in Norway, where a woman found in the grave showed signs of having her throat slit in a similar manner to the execution described by Ibn Fadlan. 
During the 11th-century, the Viking nations of Denmark, Norway and Sweden became Christian, which made it impossible for them to continue to conduct slave raids toward Christian Europe, and consequently Viking slave raiding across Europe declined. The establishment of Kievan Rus likely also decreased the number of slaves taken in raids and limited it to the local market for slaves in Sweden, according to Lena Björkman.

===Abolition===

Slavery in Sweden appear to have gradually phased out during the 13th-century. The Christian church did not approve of the enslavement of Christians. Giving freedom to a slave was seen as a holy act, giving the nobleman more of a chance to reach heaven, and it appeared to have become a custom to free slaves by will, gradually decreased the number of slaves. Since there were by the 13th-century fewer Pagan lands were Christians could legitimately acquire new slaves, there were no way to increase the number of slaves. There was no serfdom in Sweden, and consequently all farmers, rich and poor were free. While poorer farmers probably did not have the financial option as rich noblemen had, this possibly means that farmers or freemen were the last to free their slaves

In parallel with the increasing manumission-wills of slaves during the 13th-century, different parts of Sweden started to ban slavery within their counties, while it remained legal in others. 
The last document mentioning a slave in Sweden is a will from 1310, which manumitted the male slave Karelus.
Thralldom was finally outlawed by King Magnus IV of Sweden in 1335. 
In practice, the 1335 was the abolition of slavery in the Counties of Västergötland and Värend, but since slavery had already been prohibited in the rest of the counties before, the 1335 ban in the only two counties were slavery remained legal, also meant the final abolition of slavery in Sweden as a whole. 
In reality, there would have been very few slaves left in Sweden by the time of its final abolition, and it is seen as likely that all had already been manumitted by that point.

==Swedish slavery and slave trade in the early modern period==

===Trading stations in Africa===

In 1650, Sweden established trading stations along the West African coast, with bases in an area called the Swedish Gold Coast which was later a part of the West African Gold Coast, and which is today part of Ghana. Sweden and Denmark were competing for positions as regional powers during this period, and the Danes followed the Swedes to Africa, setting up stations a couple of years later. In 1663, the Swedish Gold Coast was taken over by the Danish colonial power and became part of the Danish Gold Coast. There is no historical documentation that shows that slaves were ever traded in the trading stations during their 13-year Swedish possession.

Swedish trading stations reappeared in the 18th century, when Sweden established a colonial presence in the Caribbean.

===Slavery in the Barbary Coast===

There were over 1,500 Swedish slaves in the Barbary Coast as victims of the Barbary slave trade. Many would never see their homeland again. The Turks also frequently castrated their slaves. 
The Ottomans also bought black sex slaves from the Swedes.

No slave raids was ever conducted by corsairs towards the coasts of Sweden. However, Swedish and Finnish ships (Finland was a part of Sweden) were attacked by corsairs in the sea outside of Western Europe and in the Mediterranean.

On 20 November 1662 the Lord High Treasurer of Sweden, Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie received a letter of appeal from eight Swedish sailors who had been abducted by corsairs at sea and was being held in slavery in Alger.

The Swede Johan Gabriel Sparfwenfeldt, who visited Alger and Tunis in 1691, described empathically how he had met and spoken to many Swedish slaves who asked him for help to be bought free and return to &quot;their homes, to their children, their parents and the land of their home&quot;, and listed 23 names of the Swedes then held as slaves.

Sweden attempted to protect their ships by use of insurrance against slavery, convoys, international treaties and by maintaining friendly contact with the corsairs. The captives were also bought free by their relatives. 
This did not only apply to slaves from rich families: many poor women are known to have collected money to buy their husbands and sons free. When the young sailor Erik Persson Ångerman was enslaved in Alger after having taken captured from the ship &quot;Wibus&quot; from Stockholm on 10 May 1725, he sent a letter to his wife Maria Olssdotter via his colleague Petter Wallberg (who had been bought free and was returning to Sweden) and told her he &quot;sat in hard slavery&quot; in Alger. 
Maria Olssdotter had no funds to buy his freedom, but appealed to the king via the governor of Gävle for money to be gathered in the churches for the purchase of her enslaved husband, and her application was approved; this was not an unusual case, as many poor women are known to have done the same.

Almost all Swedes and Finns who were captured by the corsairs at sea were sailors. Between about 500 and 1000 Swedish citizens were enslaved by the corsairs between 1650 and 1763.

One of the Swedish victims of the Barbary slave trade was Marcus Berg (1714-1761).

Sweden together with, the United States of America and Kingdom of Sicily, would intervene in 1801 to free Swedish, American and Sicilian slaves from the Barbary Coast. In the First Barbary War three Swedish ship would partake to free Swedish slaves.

===Slave trade under King Gustav III===
In 1771, Gustav III became the King of Sweden. He wanted Sweden to re-establish itself as a European &quot;Great Power&quot;. Overseas colonies were a symbol of power and prestige at that time, so he decided to acquire colonies for Sweden. Denmark-Norway received large revenues from its colonies in the West Indies, so in 1784, Gustav acquired the West Indian island of Saint-Barthélemy from France.

On 23 August 1784, the king informed the Privy Council that Sweden now owned an island in the West Indies. This apparently came as a surprise for many of the Councilors. The first report concerning the island came from Simon Bérard, Swedish consul-general in L&#x27;Orient, the only town. He reported that:

According to Bérard, there was no possibility of agriculture because of the poor soil. The island&#x27;s one desirable feature was a good harbor.

Bérard recommended that the island be made a free port. At that time, France had trouble providing sufficient slaves to its colonies in the area. Sweden could try to export a certain number of slaves to the French colonies in the region each year.

If Saint-Barthélemy was a success, Sweden could later expand its colonial empire to more islands in the area. Gustav also knew that the leading slave trading nations in Europe made large amounts of money from it.
In the autumn of 1786, the Swedish West India Company was established on the island. Gustav told investors that they could expect big profits in the future. Anyone who could afford it was allowed to buy shares, but Gustav kept 10 per cent of the shares for himself, which made him the largest shareholder. The king received one-quarter of all profits of the company and the other shareholders three quarters, even though the king owned only 10 per cent of the company.

On 31 October of the same year, a privilege letter was made for the West India Company. The company was granted the right to trade slaves between Africa and the West Indies. Paragraph 14 in the letter states: &quot;The Company is free to operate slave trade in Angola and the African coast, where such is permitted.&quot;

On 12 March 1790, a new custom tax and constitution were introduced to the island. Both were designed to make Saint-Barthélemy into a haven for slave traders. The new laws gave astonishing opportunities for traders from all over the world.

There was no duty on slaves imported from Africa to Saint-Barthélemy: &quot;Free import of slaves and trade with black slaves or so called new Negroes from Africa is granted to all nations without having to pay any charge at the unload.&quot;

People from all over the Caribbean came to buy slaves. The government charged a small export duty on slaves sold from Saint-Barthélemy to foreign colonies. This duty was halved for slaves imported from Africa on Swedish ships, generating increased profits for the West India Company and other Swedish traders.

The new constitution stated: &quot;Freedom for all on Saint Bartholomew living and arriving to arm and send out ships and shipments to Africa to buy slaves on the places thus is permitted for all nations. That way a new branch for the Swedish trade in Africa and the Coast of Guinea should arise.&quot;

In 1813, Sweden was awarded control of Guadeloupe, a nearby French colony temporarily under British occupation. In 1814, though, with the fall of Napoleon, Sweden gave the island back to France.

One of the few African slaves bought to actual Sweden proper were Gustav Badin. He was taken to Sweden from the Danish Caribbean and gifted to the queen, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia, as a child. Badin were taught to read and write and instructed in religion but was otherwise allowed to live as he pleased, free from corporal punishment otherwise customary for children at the time, in order to test the ideas about the Noble savage of the time. Badin was baptised, married, and had a long career as a trusted member of the court.

===Abolition===

In 1788, the British Committee for the Abolition of Slavery sent a Swedish opponent of the slave trade, Anders Sparrman, to Gustav III. The committee feared that other nations would expand their trade if Britain stopped its own. They sent books about the issue and a letter, in which the king was encouraged to hinder his subjects to participate in this disgraceful trade. In the response letter, delivered through Sparrman, he wrote that no one in the country had participated in the slave trade and that he would do all that he could to keep them from doing so.

During the early 19th century, movements against slavery became stronger, especially in Britain. Slave trade was outlawed in Britain in 1807, and in the United States in 1808, after which other countries started to follow suit. Sweden made the slave trade illegal as part of the Treaty of Stockholm with Britain in 1813, but allowed slavery until 9 October 1847.

During the 19th century, the British Admiralty patrolled the African coast to catch illegal slave traders. The Swedish vessel Diana was intercepted by the British authorities close to the coast of Africa while engaged in carrying slaves from Africa to Saint Bartholomew during this period. The case was taken to court in order to test if the slave trade could be considered contrary to the general law of nations. However, the vessel was returned to the Swedish owners on the ground that Sweden had not prohibited the trade and tolerated it in practice.

Once the slave trade became a hot issue, the Swedish government abandoned the slave trade in the Caribbean, but did not initially outlaw slavery. The West Indian colony became financial burdens. The island of Guadeloupe was returned to France in 1814, in return for a compensation in the sum of 24 million francs. A Guadeloupe Fund was established in Sweden for the benefit of the Swedish Crown Prince and Regent Charles XIV John of Sweden, born Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, a French national and former Marshal of France under Napoleon I. He and his heirs were paid 300,000 riksdaler per year up until 1983 in compensation for their loss of prestige in France when Sweden joined Britain against France in the Napoleonic War. In Saint Bartholomew, the Swedish government bought the remaining slaves to give them freedom. According to Herman Lindqvist in Aftonbladet (8 October 2006), 523 slaves were bought free for 80 riksdaler per slave.

Exactly how many slaves were brought to the New World on Swedish ships is not known, since most of the archives documents have not been investigated, and many of them are by now not accessible because of their bad preservation. Nevertheless, some data, mostly concerning the former Swedish island Saint-Barthélemy, is now available online.

==In popular culture==
Johan Vilde is a Comic series awarded with best comic book of the year in Sweden 1976. It contains several comics that depict the life of Johan Vilde that by unfortunate circumstances winds up as a Swedish slave. During the height of the Swedish slave trade in Africa.

Vilde falls overboard of his Swedish ship and winds up in an African tribe that takes care of him. They become his foster family. Then a rival more warlike tribe with the help of European guns defeats them and sells him and his foster family into slavery in the Swedish slave fort of Christina. The Swedes misstake Vilde for an albino African and decides to sell him even thou he looks white. The plot then continues and revolves around Swedish slave traders.

<text>Aqueduct Racetrack is a Thoroughbred horse racing facility and casino in the South Ozone Park and Jamaica neighborhoods of Queens, New York City, United States. Aqueduct is the only racetrack located within New York City limits. Its racing meets are usually from late October/early November through April. The racetrack is located adjacent to a casino called Resorts World New York City.

The track itself has three courses. The main track (dirt) has a circumference of . Inside of the main track are two courses: the Main Turf Course, and the Inner Turf Course measuring . The track has seating capacity of 17,000 and total capacity of 40,000. The facility houses the headquarters of the New York Racing Association (NYRA).

In December 2022 the NYRA formally announced its intention to upgrade the facilities at nearby Belmont Park to make it suitable to host year-round thoroughbred racing and training, which would ultimately lead to the closure of Aqueduct Racetrack, sometime in late 2026.

==History==
Operating near the site of a former conduit of the Brooklyn Waterworks that brought water from eastern Long Island to the Ridgewood Reservoir, Aqueduct Racetrack opened on September 27, 1894, by the Queens County Jockey Club. The track was named &quot;Aqueduct&quot; after the former Ridgewood Aqueduct. The facility was expanded and a new clubhouse constructed before the 1941 summer meet.

In 1955, the Greater New York Association took over Aqueduct along with Belmont Park, Saratoga Race Course, and Jamaica Race Course, deciding to make major upgrades to Aqueduct, after which Jamaica Race Course would be sold for redevelopment as a housing project. Aqueduct closed in 1956, reopening September 14, 1959, after $33 million of renovations designed by noted racetrack architect Arthur Froehlich of the firm Arthur Froehlich and Associates of Beverly Hills, California. The Equestris Restaurant in the clubhouse opened in 1981 and was the largest restaurant in New York City at the time. Additional renovations were made in 2001, 2006, and 2007.

Before 1976, the Inner Dirt Track was a turf course known as the Main Turf Course, with the present turf course being the Inner Turf Course; following the conclusion of racing in 1975 the grass on the Main Turf Course was uprooted and the Inner Dirt Track took its place to permit year-round racing. (In the years after Aqueduct was rebuilt in 1959 the track lay idle from early November until April 1; by 1971 this period had been reduced to from just before Christmas until March 1, around when off-track betting began in New York City, creating a demand for horse racing to be contested in the region year-round.)

Currently, one annual meeting is held at Aqueduct, usually from the last Wednesday in October until the first Sunday in May. Races had been run on the Inner Dirt Track between the Wednesday after Thanksgiving until just before the Wood Memorial in recent years. Prior to 1977, a summer meeting also was held at Aqueduct, from mid-June to late July. The Wood Memorial is Aqueduct&#x27;s marquee race, which culminates the winter meet. The Remsen and Cigar Mile are major races that begin the winter meet. The prestigious Jockey Club Gold Cup was usually run there between 1958 and 1974, and what was perhaps the track&#x27;s most distinctive race, the marathon Display Handicap, was last contested in 1990.

From 1963 through 1967, races normally run at Belmont Park, including the Belmont Stakes, were run at Aqueduct while Belmont&#x27;s grandstand was being rebuilt. The track played host to the second ever Breeders&#x27; Cup on November 2, 1985.

Aqueduct is the site of the first (and still the only) triple dead heat for the win in a stakes race. In the 1944 running of the Carter Handicap, Brownie, Bossuet, and Wait A Bit hit the finish line at the same time. On April 8, 2006, during an eleven-race program at Aqueduct that included the Wood Memorial Stakes, a rare event happened when dead heats for each of the three &quot;money&quot; positions (Win, Place, and Show) occurred in three separate races: Saint Anddan and Criminal Mind dead-heated for Place in Race 5; Naragansett and Emotrin dead-heated for Show in Race 6; and Karakorum Tuxedo and Megatrend dead-heated for Win in Race 10.
Hall of Fame horse Cigar won the first two races in his 16-race win streak at Aqueduct. After he switched from grass to dirt, Cigar&#x27;s first win was by eight lengths in an allowance race on October 28, 1994, and was followed by a seven-length win in the NYRA Mile on November 26, 1994, a Grade 1 race that was renamed in the horse&#x27;s honor in 1997. On May 31, 1965, 73,375 spectators were on hand at Aqueduct and watched Gun Bow win the Metropolitan Mile. At the time, it was the largest crowd to ever attend a thoroughbred horse racing event in New York.

Champion racehorse Secretariat was retired at Aqueduct before the public on November 6, 1973. He was paraded for the last time to the public and took his last steps on a racetrack there. He was then sent to stud at Claiborne Farm.

From 1978 to 2011, the Aqueduct Flea Market was held on Saturdays, Sundays, and Tuesdays, and was located in the racetrack&#x27;s north parking lot along Rockaway Boulevard. The flea market contained over 500 vendors and offered a hodgepodge of goods, including bedding, incense, pots and pans, and other items.

Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass in front of a crowd of 75,000 at Aqueduct on October 6, 1995. 

After the financial collapse and closure of the New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation on December 10, 2010, Aqueduct Racetrack saw an increase in patrons for the first time in several years. On December 11, one day after NYCOTB&#x27;s closure, the number of patrons who entered Aqueduct&#x27;s doors increased 61% (5,444 customers) compared to the previous year (3,378 customers). The New York Racing Association, which owns Aqueduct, took advantage by offering former NYCOTB customers free bus shuttle service from select former NYCOTB branches to Aqueduct Racetrack with a free hot dog, soft drink, and Post Parade program.

In May 2017, NYRA announced that they would resurface the main track with a limestone base, and convert the inner dirt track back into a turf course. The changes were completed in time for the start of the 2017 fall meet on November 3. With this change, the main track will now be used for winter racing.

=== Redevelopment efforts ===

==== 2007 proposal to close track ====
In May 2007, reports indicated that then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer was considering closing Aqueduct and selling the track and its stables, which currently house 400 horses, to developers when the New York Racing Association lease expired at the end of 2007. According to the reports, Belmont Park, which is east in Elmont, New York, would have become a nearly year-round track and would get the video lottery machines authorized to operate at Aqueduct. Belmont Park would have been modified to handle winter requirements, which would have included heated stands and the construction of new stables. According to the plans that were discussed, the oldest and most historic track in the state, Saratoga Race Course, would have been operated by the New York Racing Association, and a new entity would have operated Belmont Park. Aqueduct traditionally has been considered a track frequented by blue collar fans while Belmont Park has a more upscale reputation.

State Assembly Member Audrey I. Pheffer (D), whose district included Aqueduct, fought the closing of the track, which she felt was important to the local community. Any closure at Aqueduct, which is equipped for the cold winter months, would have required millions of dollars in renovations at Belmont, a summer-only track. Belmont is also hampered by its north-oriented grandstand, which would cause shadows in the winter months. Belmont is one of few racecourses in the United States (Santa Anita Park and Thistledown Racecourse being the others) to be north-oriented. Most others are oriented either east or (rarely) west or south. NYRA was planning to cease all operations after completing the racing card of February 10, 2008. This was averted when a deal was reached with NYRA and New York State. To help raise capital, NYRA sold of vacant land near Aqueduct in June 2009. The land that was auctioned off consisted of residential lots to the west of the IND Rockaway Line.

==== 2012 proposal for convention center ====
On January 4, 2012, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the construction of a new convention center on the Aqueduct Racetrack to replace the aging Javits Center. This would be the country&#x27;s largest convention center, featuring hotels, restaurants, and expanded gambling. Building the convention center would require additional land, which could include nearby City-owned lots leased to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for airport parking or the adjacent racetrack (as racing could be consolidated to Belmont Park).

On June 1, 2012, Governor Cuomo announced that plans to build the convention center had been canceled.

==== 2023 proposal to close track ====
By 2022, the NYRA anticipated that it would shutter Aqueduct Racetrack in the future. In early 2023, Governor Kathy Hochul announced that the state would provide $455 million in capital funds for the redevelopment of the Aqueduct Racetrack site, following a reconstruction of the racetrack at Belmont Park. Once NYRA completes its renovation of Belmont Park, which is projected for late 2026, the agency plans to give up its lease of Aqueduct Racetrack and move all horse racing activities to Belmont Park.

== Resorts World New York City ==

Resorts World New York City is part of the Aqueduct Racetrack complex. It was proposed in the late 2000s and opened in late 2011. Aside from its being the first legal casino in New York City, it is the only casino located in the five boroughs and the only casino besides Empire City Casino and Jake&#x27;s 58 in Islandia in the New York City region. It was also the first Resorts World to be built in America.

=== Casino ===
The casino features four automated table games: baccarat, blackjack, craps, and roulette in addition to a wide array of video slot machines. Baccarat is played with real playing cards, but they are dealt inside a machine without any human dealers.

=== History ===
The New York State Legislature legalized video gambling devices at racetracks in 2001. However, the opening of a racino at the track hit various problems. Video lottery terminals similar to slot machines were approved at five locations, including Aqueduct, Finger Lakes Race Track, Monticello Raceway, Vernon Downs, and Yonkers Raceway. The revenue would be divided between the racetracks and the State and would allow tracks to increase purses and to attract better quality horses in races.

In 2007, the State issued a request for proposals to operate the video lottery terminals at Aqueduct. Among the bids received was a $2 billion proposal by the Shinnecock Indian Nation to open a casino at the track. The proposal was in conjunction with Marian Ilitch, a co-owner of the Detroit Red Wings. The proposal according to most sources was dead on arrival since, even if the Shinnecocks received official Bureau of Indian Affairs recognition as a tribe, the Aqueduct Casino would still have to be approved by the New York State Legislature and the Bureau of Indian Affairs; and Aqueduct would have to first be taken into trust by the Department of Interior, as the Shinnecocks historically had not owned property in Queens. In October 2008, the State selected the Delaware North as the winning bidder among three proposals to build a racino at Aqueduct. The facility would include 4,500 slot machines. However, these plans fell apart in March 2009 when the developer was unable to make a $370 million upfront payment to the State. 


In July 2009, seven companies submitted bids to develop a racino at Aqueduct: Aqueduct Entertainment Group, Delaware North, MGM Mirage, Mohegan Sun, Penn National Gaming, SL Green Realty, and Wynn Resorts. Some developers indicated that a portion of the slot machines could open as early as April 2010. However, the selection of an operator for the casino was delayed for several months because State officials frequently changed the rules and could not reach an agreement on the winning bidder, prompting Wynn to pull out of the running in November. On January 29, 2010, Governor David Paterson announced that the Aqueduct Entertainment Group would run the casino.

Aqueduct Entertainment Group partners included GreenStar Services Corporation, Turner Construction Company, Levine Builders, The Darman Group, Empowerment Development Corporation, Navegante Group, PS&amp;S Design, Siemens AG, and Clairvest Group. The appointment generated controversy because of charges that AEG, which had the worst initial bid of those bidding, was allowed to change its bid so that it had the best. Paterson was reported to have demanded that the ownership of an affirmative action component. During this time rapper Jay-Z, through his company Gain Global Investments Network LLC, then got a 7% ownership of AEG; and charges were made that Jay-Z and Paterson had a personal relationship. U.S. prosecutors investigated the bidding process, particularly in light of the fact that AEG won the bid two days after Queens megachurch pastor Floyd Flake (who is also an AEG investor) threatened to switch his support in the 2010 governor race from Paterson to Andrew Cuomo. New York house speaker Sheldon Silver also threatened not to sign off on the deal. Paterson maintained there was no quid pro quo. On March 9, 2010, Paterson, Flake, and Jay-Z withdrew from further involvement. Paterson said he was recusing himself on the advice of his lawyers. Flake, who had 0.6% share, said the case was distracting from his other projects. On March 11, 2010, the State withdrew its support for the AEG bid and announced that a new group would be selected through an &quot;expedited, transparent, apolitical, and publicly accountable process.&quot; Aqueduct Entertainment Group said it intended to sue.

On June 2, 2010, New York Lottery officials announced that six groups were considering submitting bids to develop the racino. These include three of the previous bidders (Delaware North, Penn National Gaming, and SL Green Realty) and three new groups (Empire City Casino at Yonkers Raceway, Genting New York LLC, and Clairvest Group). On June 29, three of the firms submitted bids: SL Green/Hard Rock Cafe, Genting Group, and Penn National. Clairvest participated in the SL Green/Hard Rock Cafe bid.

The bids from Penn and SL Green were disqualified in July for not meeting requirements. On August 3, 2010, Lottery officials announced they had accepted Genting Group&#x27;s $380 million upfront licensing fee bid, which was $55 million more than the closest competing bid. Its business model includes targeting flyers stranded at John F. Kennedy Airport. The company said its plans involve 1,200 construction jobs and 800 permanent jobs, and that it will bring the state $500 million a year in revenue. Genting opened the Resorts World Casino New York City on October 28, 2011, with 2,280 gaming terminals.

The casino opened in late 2011. In August 2021, a Hyatt Regency hotel opened on the site of the casino. It is owned by Genting Group, which also owns Resorts World.

====Expansion proposal====
Genting will expand the property into an integrated resort if it is awarded a full casino license for downstate New York. Additional hotel space, a performance venue, convention space along with shopping and dining options will be added. Under the proposal, the casino would expand to 350,000 square feet, making it one of the largest casinos in the US. An additional 1,600 hotel rooms would be added, giving the resort a total of 2,000 rooms. This could make Resorts World New York City the largest hotel in New York City. An expanded Resorts World would also include 350,000 square feet of convention and meeting space as well as a 7,000 seat arena for entertainment events such as concerts. With the closure of the racetrack an “Aqueduct Park” would be built which would include a sports academy. This expansion will also created 3,000 new units of housing as well as other infrastructure improvements. 

==Track announcers==
Sportscaster Tom Durkin was the chief track announcer at Aqueduct and the other NYRA tracks until his retirement on August 31, 2014. Races were called by John Imbriale until 2023 and since then races have been called by Chris Griffin.

==Transportation==
The track has its own New York City Subway station, Aqueduct Racetrack, served by the IND Rockaway Line (). It has only one platform on the Brooklyn-bound side, requiring southbound travelers to transfer to a northbound train at Aqueduct–North Conduit Avenue station, which is located a few blocks to the south. NYRA also operates a free shuttle bus between the North Conduit Avenue station and the Clubhouse entrance.

The Q37 bus route serves Aqueduct Racetrack and was rerouted in 2011 to serve the casino. The Q7, Q11 and Q41 bus routes also pass nearby.

<text>Jarama () is a river in central Spain. It flows north to south and passes east of Madrid where the El Atazar Dam is built on a tributary, the Lozoya River. It flows into the river Tagus in Aranjuez. The Manzanares is a tributary of the Jarama.

== The Jarama in history ==

The Jarama was the scene of fierce fighting in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. Nationalist forces crossed the river in an attempt to cut the main road from Madrid to the Republican capital at Valencia. Nationalist forces led by Spanish Legionnaires and Moroccan soldiers (Regulares) of the Army of Africa were confronted by forces from the Republic including the 15th International Brigade.

The song Jarama Valley, with lyrics referencing the battle, became popular among the Republican battalions.

==In fiction==

&quot;El Jarama&quot; is a 1955 novel by Rafael Sánchez Ferlosio about a group of working-class youngsters from Madrid meeting for a picnic by the river on a summer day. Its realistic dialog renovated Spanish novels, and it won the Premio Nadal (Nadal Prize) in 1955.

<doc id="874206" wikidata="Q1257434" url="?curid=874206" title="Ostrog Monastery">
<text>The Ostrog Monastery (, ) is a monastery of the Serbian Orthodox Church situated against an almost vertical background, high up in the large rock of Ostroška Greda, in Montenegro. It is dedicated to Saint Basil of Ostrog (&quot;Sveti Vasilije Ostroški&quot;), who was buried here. From the monastery, the Bjelopavlići plain can be seen. The monastery is located in Danilovgrad Municipality, 50 km away from Podgorica and 15 km away from Nikšić. Ostrog monastery is the most popular pilgrimage place in Montenegro.

==History==
 
The Monastery was founded in the early 17th century by Vasilije Jovanović, the Metropolitan of Herzegovina, and is first mentioned on a geographical map of Montenegro from 1640. Vasilije died there in 1671 and some years later he was glorified. His body is enshrined in a reliquary kept in the cave-church dedicated to the Presentation of the Mother of God to the Temple.

The present-day look was given to the Monastery in 1923–1926, after a fire which had destroyed the major part of the complex. The two little cave-churches were spared and they are the key areas of the monument. The frescoes in the Church of the Presentation were created towards the end of the 17th century. The other church, dedicated to the Holy Cross, is placed within a cave on the upper level of the monastery and was painted by master Radul, who successfully coped with the natural shapes of the cave and laid the frescoes immediately on the surface of the rock and the south wall. Around the church are monastic residences.

During World War II, a detachment of Chetniks led by Blažo Đukanović and Bajo Stanišić took refuge at Ostrog up to October 18, 1943, when Yugoslav Partisans promised the Chetniks that their lives would be spared if they surrendered. Đukanović and 23 Chetniks peacefully surrendered, expecting to be spared, but were all killed by the Partisans at Ostrog. Stanišić and three members of his extended family initially did not surrender, but did not survive at Ostrog. There are different accounts on what happened to Stanišić and his family; sources contradict each other on whether Stanišić and his family were killed fighting the Partisans or committed suicide at Ostrog.

The Orthodox monastery of Ostrog is one of the most frequently visited in the Balkans. It attracts over 100,000 visitors a year. It is visited by believers from all parts of the world, either individually or in groups. It represents the meeting place of all confessions: the Orthodox, the Catholics and the Muslims. According to the stories of pilgrims, by praying by his body, many have been cured and helped in lessening the difficulties in their lives.

==Architecture==
===Upper monastery===
The upper monastery houses the Church of the Presentation and the Church of the Holy Cross. Saint Basil of Ostrog&#x27;s relics lie in the Church of the Presentation. Also of interest is the vine which grows out of the rock. It is said that it is a miracle because nothing should be able to grow out of the sheer rock face.

===Lower monastery===

The lower monastery centers on the Church of the Holy Trinity that was built in 1824. It also makes up most of the monk residences. There are dorm rooms available for pilgrims here too.

==Traditions==
It is traditional for pilgrims to walk the 3 km from the lower monastery to the upper monastery barefoot. Before entering the Church of the Presentation to pray before Saint Basil of Ostrog, pilgrims make a donation of clothing, blankets or consumables like soap for the monks. The monastery celebrates its feast day on 12 May every year. St Basil died on 29 April in the Gregorian calendar which equates to 12 May in the Orthodox calendar .

<doc id="874207" wikidata="Q1961140" url="?curid=874207" title="Yale School of Medicine">
<text>The Yale School of Medicine is the medical school of Yale University, a private research university in New Haven, Connecticut. It was founded in 1810 as the Medical Institution of Yale College and formally opened in 1813. It is the sixth-oldest medical school in the United States.

The school’s faculty clinical practice is Yale Medicine. Yale School of Medicine has a strong affiliation with its primary teaching hospital, Yale New Haven Hospital and the Yale New Haven Health System. The school is home to the Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library, which is one of the country’s largest modern medical libraries and is known for its historical collections. 

The faculty includes 31 National Academy of Sciences members, 50 National Academy of Medicine members, and nine Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigators/professors. Yale School of Medicine faculty have also received various international awards for their scientific discoveries, impactful research, and professional achievements. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to seven current or former faculty members, and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to two faculty members.

For the class of 2028, the school received 5,669 applications to fill 104 seats in the MD Program. The median GPA for the class was 3.94, and the median MCAT score was 521.

==Education==

Yale School of Medicine educates future leaders in medicine and biomedical science. Since 1839, medical students have written a thesis based on original research, reflecting that the scientific process of investigation, observation, interpretation of data, and critical evaluation of literature are fundamental to the practice of medicine.

Many medical students take a tuition-free fifth year to pursue additional study, conducting in-depth research or exploring clinical electives and sub-internships. A significant number are awarded fifth-year research fellowships and earn the Master of Health Science degree.

Each year, approximately 20 students enroll in the school’s MD-PhD Program, one of the original Medical Scientist Training Programs established and funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Graduate students in the combined program in the Biomedical and Biological Sciences earn a PhD degree through the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. YSM residents, fellows, and faculty, as well as individuals from other institutions, can earn a two-year Master of Health Science degree. The Yale School of Medicine also offers joint degree programs with other professional schools, including Public Health, Law, Management, Engineering &amp; Applied Science, and Divinity.

YSM’s campus-based Physician Associate (PA) Program, one of the oldest PA programs in the country, trains students to become compassionate, high-quality, patient-centered PAs.

===Yale System===

The school employs the &quot;Yale System&quot; established by YSM Dean Milton Winternitz in the 1920s, wherein first- and second-year students are not graded or ranked among their classmates. In addition, course examinations are anonymous and are intended only for students&#x27; self-evaluation. Student performance is thus based on seminar participation, qualifying examinations (if a student fails, it is his/her responsibility to meet with a professor and arrange for an alternative assessment—passing grades are not released), clinical clerkship evaluations, and the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). Prior to graduation, students are required to submit a thesis based on original research.

===Rankings===
For 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Yale School of Medicine as a Tier 1 medical school in Best Medical Schools: Research, as a Tier 3 school in Best Medical Schools: Primary Care, tied for No.33 in Most Diverse Medical Schools, No.90 in Most Graduates Practicing in Health Professional Shortage Areas, No.169 in Most Graduates Practicing in Primary Care, and tied at No.161 in Most Graduates Practicing in Rural Areas. The school ranked third for NIH research funding in 2024 as reported by the Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research.

==History==

In 18th-century United States, credentials were not needed to practice medicine. Prior to the founding of the medical school, Yale graduates would train through an apprenticeship to become physicians. Yale President Ezra Stiles conceived the idea of training physicians at Yale and ultimately, his successor Timothy Dwight IV helped found the medical school. The school was chartered in 1810 and opened in New Haven in 1813. Nathan Smith (medicine and surgery) and Benjamin Silliman (pharmacology) were the first faculty members. Silliman was a professor of chemistry and taught at both Yale College and the medical school. The other two founding faculty were Jonathan Knight, anatomy, physiology and surgery, and Eli Ives, pediatrics.

One of Yale&#x27;s earliest medical graduates was Dr. Asaph Leavitt Bissell of Hanover, New Hampshire, who graduated in 1815, a member of the school&#x27;s second graduating class. Following his graduation, Dr. Bissell moved to Suffield, Connecticut, a tobacco-farming community where his parents had lived and where he practiced as a country physician for the rest of his life. The saddlebags that Dr. Bissell carried in his practice, packed with paper packets and glass bottles, are today in the school&#x27;s Medical Historical Library.

In 1916, a little more than a century after its founding, Yale School of Medicine admitted its first female students. At the time, this stood in marked contrast to the ethos of other institutions such as Harvard, which considered it “unladylike” for women to attend medical school at the time. The three women admitted to the Class of 1916 were exceptional—unlike their male counterparts, who needed only two years of college education, they were required to hold a college degree, and a quota further restricted the number of women who were admitted.

Throughout its history, Yale School of Medicine faculty have been credited with seminal scientific discoveries. Pediatrician Martha May Eliot, MD, who was recruited to Yale by Edwards A. Park, MD, chair of the medical school’s first Department of Pediatrics, are together credited with developing a cure for rickets in 1925.

Early in 1942, Louis S. Goodman, MD, and Alfred Gilman, PhD, assistant professors in Yale’s new Department of Pharmacology, began to study nitrogen mustard, an agent that was derived from a lethal gas used in the trenches of World War I. Building on research that had languished for years, the two young scientists found in a derivative of mustard gas the first effective chemotherapy for cancer.

In 1998, Charles Janeway, MD, Yale Cancer Center immunologist, established and proved his theory of innate immunity.

In the 1960s, Louis Gluck, MD, a member of the Department of Pediatrics faculty, created the first neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). In the late 1970s, William Tamborlane, MD, and the late Robert Sherwin, MD, transformed the treatment of type 1 diabetes by developing the insulin pump.

Research led by Yale School of Medicine endocrinologist Kevan Herold, MD, resulted in the Food and Drug Administration&#x27;s approval in 2022 of teplizumab (Tzield®), a medication that can delay the onset of type 1 diabetes—marking the first treatment to change the course of this autoimmune disease since the discovery of insulin in 1922.

In the field of psychiatry, following pioneering research led by Yale School of Medicine psychiatrist John Krystal, MD, and his colleagues Dennis Charney, MD, and Ronald Duman, PhD, the Food and Drug Administration approved in 2019 a nasal spray called esketamine, derived from ketamine (an anesthetic with rapid-acting effect), for treatment-resistant depression.

The original building (at Grove and Prospect) later became Sheffield Hall, part of the Sheffield Scientific School (razed in 1931). In 1860, the school moved to Medical Hall on York Street, near Chapel (this building was razed in 1957). In 1925, the school moved to its current campus, neighboring the hospital. This campus includes the Sterling Hall of Medicine (erected in 1925), Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine (1991, designed by Cesar Pelli), Anlyan Center (2003, designed by Payette Associates and Venturi Scott Brown) and the Amistad Building (2007, designed by Herbert Newman)).

On March 28, 2022, Jamie Petrone-Codrington, a former administrator pled guilty to fraud and tax charges for the theft of over $40 million dollars of computer and electronic software. Jamie Petrone-Codrington illegally bought and sold hardware purchased for the School of Medicine, starting in 2013. According to the court records, Petrone-Codrington was turned in by an anonymous tip after being seen loading computer equipment into her private vehicle, and after ordering high volumes of equipment.

==Clinical Affiliations==
An affiliation agreement between the medical school and Grace-New Haven Community Hospital in 1965 created Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH), which expanded in 1993 with the opening of the Children’s Hospital, and again in 2000 with the acquisition of the Psychiatric Hospital.

In 1999, an affiliation agreement was established between the medical school and Yale New Haven Health System. The two institutions collaborate to provide clinical care, undergraduate and graduate medical education, and to facilitate clinical research.

In 2009, the 14-story Smilow Cancer Hospital opened, and in 2012 YNHH acquired the Hospital of Saint Raphael, adding 533 beds and making it one of the largest hospitals in the United States.

The medical center has grown over the years to include the institutions listed below.

The affiliated VA Connecticut Healthcare System, located in West Haven, maintains clinical, research, and education programs in conjunction with many medical school departments. The Department of Psychiatry collaborates with the Connecticut Mental Health Center to provide recovery-oriented mental health services for thousands of people in the Greater New Haven area each year.

<text>Ravenous is a 1999 horror comedy Western cannibal film starring Guy Pearce, Robert Carlyle, Jeffrey Jones and David Arquette. The film, which is set in 1840s California, was directed by Antonia Bird and filmed in Europe. It was not a box office success and failed to recoup much of its $12 million budget. However, despite initial reception being mixed when released, it has since garnered a reputation as a cult film.

&quot;Ravenous&quot; had a troubled production history. Issues over budget and shooting schedules were still ongoing when filming was about to start in Slovakia. After the original director Milcho Manchevski was fired three weeks into production, he was replaced by Bird at the suggestion of actor Robert Carlyle. Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn composed the film&#x27;s score, which generated a significant amount of interest for its quirky and inventive use of loops, instruments and musical structure.

Screenwriter Ted Griffin wrote a script that combined elements from the Donner Party and that of Alfred Packer, the real-life &quot;Colorado Cannibal&quot; who survived by eating five companions after becoming snowbound in the San Juan Mountains in the 1870s. However, the film&#x27;s plot also serves as an overt criticism of manifest destiny through its use of cannibalism. By turning the act into an insatiable hunger, the voracious need to eat human flesh is equated to the all-consuming pursuit of power and wealth that was inherent to the expansionist attitudes of those seeking to settle the American frontier in the 19th century. The film would be the last theatrical release to feature John Spencer.

== Plot ==
During the Mexican-American War (1846 – 1848), Second Lieutenant Boyd, who is fighting in the United States Army, finds his courage fail him in battle so he plays dead as his unit is massacred. His body, along with the other dead are put in a cart and hauled back to the Mexican headquarters (throughout this journey blood drips into Boyd&#x27;s mouth). However, in a moment of bravery, Boyd seizes the chance to capture the Mexican HQ. His heroism earns him a Captain&#x27;s promotion but when General Slauson learns of the cowardice through which victory was achieved he posts Boyd into exile at Fort Spencer, a remote military outpost high in the Sierra Nevadas.

Shortly after Boyd joins the seven-man garrison at Fort Spencer, a stranger named Colqhoun arrives and describes how his wagon train became lost in the mountains. A Colonel Ives had promised the party a shorter route to the Pacific Ocean but instead had led them on a more circuitous route resulting in the party getting trapped by snow. People were reduced to cannibalism to avoid starvation. A rescue party is assembled to search for survivors. But before they leave they are warned by their Native American scout, George, of the Wendigo myth: anyone who consumes the flesh of their enemies takes their strength but becomes a demon cursed by an insatiable hunger for more human flesh.

When the soldiers reach the cave where the party had taken refuge they come to realize that Colqhoun and Ives are one and the same. He had killed and eaten his five companions and was now set on trapping and killing them as well. Colqhoun succeeds in doing this one by one, including Colonel Hart, the fort&#x27;s commanding officer.

Boyd manages to escape the massacre by jumping off a cliff but breaks his leg in the process. He hides in a pit next to the body of a fellow soldier. Eventually he eats some of the man&#x27;s flesh to stay alive. When he finally limps back into the fort he is delirious and severely traumatized; none of the remaining soldiers (who did not meet Colqhoun) believe his wild tale. A second expedition finds no bodies or any trace of the man. A temporary commander is assigned to the fort and to Boyd&#x27;s horror it turns out to be Colqhoun, now cleaned up and calling himself Colonel Ives. The others still refuse to believe that Ives is the killer especially after he bears no sign of the wounds inflicted on him during the fight at the cave.

Ives tells Boyd that he used to suffer from tuberculosis but when a Native scout told him the Wendigo myth he &quot;just had to try&quot; by murdering him, eating his flesh and in the process curing his illness. He now planned to use the fort as a base to do the same to other passing travellers; he compares the location of the fort, with the guaranteed supply of isolated migrants that it entails, to the notion of Manifest Destiny that draws them there.

Boyd is suspected of murder after another soldier mysteriously dies chained up; he watches helplessly as the last officer is murdered by an unexpected ally of Ives: Colonel Hart, back from the dead after the massacre.

Ives saved Hart by feeding him his own comrades, and now Hart is addicted, like Colqhoun, to human flesh. Ives wounds Boyd and forces him to make a choice: eat or die. Eventually Boyd gives in and eats a stew made out of the last officer killed and his wound heals. But rather than join the two men in their conspiracy to convert General Slauson who is due to arrive at the fort shortly, Boyd convinces Hart to free him so he can kill Ives. Hart does so but asks that he be killed because he no longer wants to live as a cannibal. 

Boyd and Ives inflict grievous wounds on each other. But they don&#x27;t die easily due to their recuperative powers. Finally in an outhouse, Boyd forces Ives into a large bear trap and springs it, pinning them both together. Ives taunts Boyd by telling him he&#x27;ll eat him as soon as he dies but Ives expires first. Boyd refuses to save himself by eating Ives&#x27; body and dies on top of his adversary.

Martha, the sister of the native scout, George, finds the bodies of both Ives and Boyd, closes the door, and walks away. General Slauson arrives, and while his aide looks around the dilapidated fort, the general tastes the stew that was left simmering on the fire.

== Production ==

=== Development ===
The script for &quot;Ravenous&quot; was one of three screenplays written by Ted Griffin that he sold to a studio in a week. The script was loosely inspired by the Donner Party, as well as the story of Alfred Packer, an American prospector and former Union Army soldier who murdered a group of traveling companions, ate them and claimed to law enforcement that he did so out of self-defense and survival. In September 1997, Macedonian director Milcho Manchevski was announced to direct the film for Fox 2000.

=== Filming ===
The film was shot on location in the Tatra Mountains, Slovakia and Durango, Mexico. One week before production, Manchevski reportedly submitted new storyboards, which would have required an additional two weeks of shooting. Fox 2000 eventually agreed to an additional week, with complaints that Manchevski had refused to attend production meetings with the producers. Manchevski claimed Fox 2000 executive Laura Ziskin micromanaged the production by vetoing his chosen technicians and casting against his wishes.

Shooting was delayed on the first day, as Manchevski and the production were still negotiating over the production budget and shooting schedule. As filming commenced, Manchevski says Ziskin sent him notes on the rushes &quot;every day&quot;, complaining about the amount of dirt on the costumes and the number of closeups. Screenwriter Ted Griffin was on hand for &quot;constant rewrites&quot; during the shooting.

Three weeks into filming, Ziskin arrived to the set to dismiss Manchevski, and have him replaced with director Raja Gosnell. Though Manchevski left the production, the cast was said to have been unhappy with Gosnell, and were rumored to have held a mutiny on the set. Robert Carlyle then recommended Antonia Bird, his frequent collaborator and business partner, to take over. Bird had a previous business relationship with Ziskin, and admired the script.

Following ten days of negotiations, Bird arrived in Prague to take over the production. She, too, would criticize the circumstances under which the filming was to take place, describing the allocated studio space as &quot;horrible&quot; and the scheduling of the shoot &quot;manipulative&quot;. She also went on to say that her predecessor, Manchevski, should not be blamed for the problematic production.

=== Post-production ===
Bird suggested the final theatrical cut had elements introduced without her approval, such as the voiceover narration and explanatory quotes. Bird felt these elements were superfluous, and expressed a desire in recutting the film for the European market.

== Themes ==
The film uses its period setting and the act of cannibalism to critique manifest destiny, colonialism and capitalism. Said Bird: &quot;As a European, observing early Californian history and making a film about that — I kind of believe Europeans were responsible for a lot of stuff that happened here. Robert Carlyle’s character represents that. The Europeans practiced genocide. I think the good things about America — we&#x27;re (Europeans) not responsible for.&quot;

Though Bird said the film is &quot;more about social misfits than the whole seductive nature of power&quot;, she stated, &quot;I would like to think that someone who enjoyed it (&quot;Ravenous&quot;) only as gallows humor would start to think. The metaphor of power and a society where we&#x27;re encouraged to be competitive is, to me, not a great society.&quot; Thus, cannibalism can be seen as a critique of &quot;contemporary America where the way of life seems to be more and more a matter of consume or be consumed&quot;. In addition, she said that the cannibalism can be interpreted as an addiction to drugs or a yearning for eternal youth, which manifests in modern-day Western society as the consumption of junk food or the obsession with plastic surgery. &quot;Robert Carlyle&#x27;s character is the ultimate drug pusher and Guy Pearce&#x27;s character is the ultimate junkie,&quot; said Bird.

== Soundtrack ==
The score was composed by Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn of the band Blur. Instruments used for the score were from the film&#x27;s historical period and included the violin, guitar, banjo, jaw harp and squeeze box. Nyman and Albarn reworked versions of American patriotic songs and old Methodist hymns (including those of Stephen Foster, known as the &quot;father of American music&quot;) to be intentionally out of tune and off-kilter.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Ravenous&quot; opened on March 19, 1999, in the United States in 1,040 cinemas, accumulating $1,040,727 over its opening weekend. It finished eighteenth for the weekend. The film went on to gross $2,062,405 in North America, far less than its reported $12 million budget.

=== Critical reception ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 52% rating based on 66 reviews and an average rating of 6/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Ravenous&quot; tries bringing cannibal horror into an Old West setting, ending up with an uneven blend that will fail to satisfy most fans of either genre&quot;.

Roger Ebert rated the film three out of four stars, and stated that it was &quot;the kind of movie where you savor the texture of the filmmaking, even when the story strays into shapeless gore.&quot; He noted the film is &quot;more interested in atmosphere than plot&quot;, but conceded Bird &quot;shows she&#x27;s a real filmmaker...and has an instinct for scenes like the one where a visiting general savors the broth of a bubbling stew&quot;. Ebert concluded that &quot;Ravenous&quot; &quot;is clever in the way it avoids most of the cliches of the vampire movie by using cannibalism, and most of the cliches of the cannibal movie by using vampirism. It serves both dishes with new sauces.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed the film negatively, and said: &quot;a potentially strong cast makes its way in deadly earnest through material that&#x27;s often better suited to a Monty Python skit&quot;.

Audiences, particularly in the US, were said to be confused about the tone of the film, which combines various genres such as horror, black comedy, satire and film noir. Said Carlyle: &quot;Because the subject matter is so gruesome and the visuals are so distasteful, there are going to be people who are not going to be too happy to watch this one. They’ve said all along that it’s going to be a hard sell. It’s a period piece. I think that’s why there’s humor in the film. I like the fact that it’s unusual and that it is hard to place. I think that’s a good thing — probably not for the people who are trying to make their money back.&quot;

The film has garnered cult status since its release. In a retrospective review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Ehrlich wrote, &quot;&quot;Ravenous&quot; butchers the fantasy that the United States is a banquet with room for everyone at the table. This is a landscape where &#x27;manifest destiny&#x27; becomes a handy euphemism for all sorts of horrors, and a reminder that progress was never possible without savagery; the frontier was the &quot;Hunger Games&quot;, and it always has been. That may not be breaking news, but the film isn&#x27;t interested in telling you something that you don&#x27;t know, only showing it to you in a way so giddy and gruesome that you&#x27;ll never be able to forget it.&quot;

<text>Svetlana Vladimirovna Krivelyova (; born 13 June 1969) is a former Russian track and field athlete who specialised in the shot put.

Krivelyova was born in Bryansk, Russia. Her career highlights were the Summer Olympics gold medal in 1992 whilst representing the Unified Team, where she beat the reigning world champion Huang Zhihong of China, and her World Championship victory in 2003.

Her most unlikely victory came at the 2004 World Indoor Championships. She was awarded the gold medal after Ukraine&#x27;s Vita Pavlysh (Krivelyova&#x27;s former Unified Team teammate) was stripped of her title for failing a drug test. This was the second time Pavlysh was found to have taken anabolic steroids and lost a World indoor title; she was subsequently banned from athletics for life.

Despite being world ranked number 1 in the run up to the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, Krivelyova could only manage to finish fourth to match her finish at the 2000 Summer Olympics. However the winner, compatriot Irina Korzhanenko, tested positive for Stanozolol and was stripped of her title, promoting Krivelyova to the bronze medal position.

The IOC retested the samples from the 2004 Olympics and diagnosed a positive test. Krivelyova lost her third place to Nadzeya Ostapchuk (the bronze medal was not awarded). In April 2013, she was banned from competitions for two years.

<text>Nia Talita Long ( ; born October 30, 1970) is an American actress. Best known for her work in Black cinema, Long rose to prominence after starring in the film &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; (1991), and for her portrayal of Beullah &quot;Lisa&quot; Wilkes on the NBC sitcom &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; (1991–1995). She then appeared in &quot;Friday&quot; (1995), as well as the 1997 films &quot;Love Jones&quot; and &quot;Soul Food&quot;.

Long is also known for her roles in the films &quot;The Best Man&quot; (1999), and its sequel &quot;The Best Man Holiday&quot; (2013), as well as &quot;Big Momma&#x27;s House&quot; (2000) and its sequel &quot;Big Momma&#x27;s House 2&quot; (2006). On television, she portrayed Sasha Monroe on the crime drama series &quot;Third Watch&quot; (2003–2005), and has starred on the Fox drama series &quot;Empire&quot; (2017), and the CBS action series &quot;&quot; (2017–2018).

She has received several accolades, including two NAACP Image Awards and a Black Reel Award.

==Early life==
Long was born in Brooklyn to Talita Long (née Gillman), a teacher and printmaker, and Doughtry Long, a high school teacher and poet. Her mother is of Trinidadian descent. She has an older half-sister, the actress and comedian known as Sommore. When Long was two years old, her parents divorced. She accompanied her mother, who moved to Iowa City, to study fine arts.

When Long was seven, her mother moved to South Los Angeles, where she planned to marry. She and her fiancé called off the wedding, but Talita chose to stay in Los Angeles. Long&#x27;s father resided in Trenton, New Jersey. She was bused from South LA to Paseo Del Rey Elementary School in Playa Del Rey from 3rd grade through 6th grade, and attended St. Mary&#x27;s Academy in Inglewood, California. In addition to her academic classes, she studied ballet, tap, jazz, gymnastics, guitar, and acting. She graduated from Westchester High School in Los Angeles in 1989.

==Career==
Long&#x27;s acting coach was Betty Bridges, better known as the mother of &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; star Todd Bridges. Her earliest role was in the Disney television film &quot;The B.R.A.T. Patrol&quot; alongside Sean Astin, Tim Thomerson and Brian Keith. Her first notable role on television was a three-year contract role as Kathryn &quot;Kat&quot; Speakes on the soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. Long portrayed Kat from 1991 to 1994. Long also played Brandi in &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;. The film excited Long, who was doing her &quot;first real movie role&quot;. It also helped Long build her confidence as an actress. &quot;It introduced me to the world in a way that it was okay for me to be who I am and still find success,&quot; she added. &quot;I didn&#x27;t have to conform to anything.&quot; From 1994 to 1995, she played Will Smith&#x27;s girlfriend and fiancée Beulah &quot;Lisa&quot; Wilkes on &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;. Jada Pinkett Smith was originally supposed to play Lisa, but was too short for the role (opposite a 6&#x27;2&quot; Will Smith), thus leaving Long to take the part. Also, in the second season of the show (episode 8 – &quot;She Ain&#x27;t Heavy&quot; 1992), Long appeared as Claudia, a love interest of Smith&#x27;s, alongside Queen Latifah.

In 2000, Long auditioned for the role of Alex Munday in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, but did not get the part because she &quot;looked too sophisticated and too old next to Drew Barrymore.&quot; The role was eventually given to Lucy Liu. In 2003, Long joined the cast of the drama &quot;Third Watch&quot;, where she played NYPD officer Sasha Monroe, continuing until the series finale in 2005. In 2005 and 2006, Long appeared on &quot;Everwood&quot;, and guest-starred on &quot;Boston Legal&quot; during its 2006–2007 season. She then starred alongside Michael Vartan and Dylan McDermott in &quot;Big Shots&quot; from 2007 to 2008. In 2016, Long was cast as Giuliana, a Las Vegas club owner, in a recurring role on the TV series &quot;Empire&quot;.

Long has had supporting roles in a number of films such as &quot;Friday&quot; and &quot;Made in America&quot;. She has also played a leading role, or was a member of the primary ensemble, in several films, including &quot;Soul Food&quot;, &quot;Love Jones&quot;, &quot;Boiler Room&quot;, &quot;Big Momma&#x27;s House&quot;, &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot;, and &quot;The Best Man&quot;. Ice Cube has starred with her in four films, while fellow Westchester High alum Regina King has starred with her in two. Long has also starred alongside Michael Beach in the film &quot;Soul Food&quot; and on the TV series &quot;Third Watch&quot;.

Long made a cameo appearance in the video for Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Touch the Sky&quot;. She also directed Yolanda Adams&#x27;s video for &quot;This Too Shall Pass&quot;. Long won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series in 2004 for her performance on &quot;Third Watch&quot;. She co-directed and appeared in Ashanti&#x27;s music video, &quot;Baby&quot;, and made a guest appearance on the sitcom &quot;Living Single&quot; during its first season. She originally voiced Roberta Tubbs on &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; before being replaced by Reagan Gomez-Preston.

Long later appeared in the 2013 film &quot;The Best Man Holiday&quot;, reprising her role from the original 1999 film. Unlike the original film, however, her character is in an interracial relationship with a white man. After Long was revealed to be pursuing an interracial relationship in the film, she explained: &quot;We&#x27;re living in a modern world where it happens and it&#x27;s OK and it&#x27;s no disrespect to any black man. I love black men, but the reality is the sistahs are marrying white men and the brothas are marrying white women and that&#x27;s the world that we live in and it&#x27;s not to be judged, and if it works for you then embrace it&quot;. Director Malcolm D. Lee also supported the interracial relationship being portrayed in the film: &quot;African-American women who are extremely successful can&#x27;t always find black male counterparts on that level so it&#x27;s a little bit of a reflection of reality that black women are starting to date outside their race — and why not?&quot;

In July 2020, Long starred in the Netflix psychological thriller &quot;Fatal Affair&quot;. In 2022, Long starred in the Peacock miniseries &quot;The Best Man: The Final Chapters&quot;, once again reprising her role from the previous films.

==Personal life==
Long contributes her time to the Sterling Children&#x27;s Home in Barbados as a motivational speaker.

In 2010, Long started dating then–National Basketball Association player Ime Udoka. Together, they have a son, born in 2011. Long also has an older son, born in 2000, from a previous relationship. Long and Udoka became engaged in 2015, though Long stated she had no plans to marry. The couple split in 2022 after Udoka, who had become head coach of the Boston Celtics, was revealed to have had an affair with a Celtics staff member.

<text>Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University (Alabama A&amp;M or AAMU) is a public historically black land-grant university in Normal, Huntsville, Alabama. Founded in 1875, it took its present name in 1969. It was one of about 180 &quot;normal schools&quot; founded by state governments in the 19th century to train teachers for the rapidly growing public common schools. It was one of 23 established to train African Americans to teach in segregated schools. Some closed but most steadily expanded their role and became state colleges in the early 20th century and state universities in the late 20th century. AAMU is a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University Historic District, also known as Normal Hill College Historic District, has 28 buildings and four structures listed in the United States National Register of Historic Places.

==History==

Teacher and schoolmaster William Hooper Councill won approval for his plan for the Huntsville State Normal School for Negroes, established by an act of the Alabama State Legislature in 1875. The school opened on May 1, 1875, at a church on Eustis Street, with instruction for 61 teaching students overseen by Principal Councill, assisted by Rev. Alfred Hunt. By 1878, the state appropriation increased from $1,000 to $2,000 and the school expanded its enrollment and curriculum.

In 1881, the faculty pooled money from their salaries to purchase on West Clinton Street. In 1885 the school, now with around 180 students, changed its name to State Normal and Industrial School of Huntsville, after the earlier addition of programs for sewing, printing, carpentry, mattress making and gardening. By 1890, the school site became known as Normal, Alabama, and a post office was established. In 1891, the school was designated as a land-grant college through legislative enactment under the terms of the Morrill Act of 1890. In 1896, its name was changed to The State Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes. In 1919, the school became the State Agricultural and Mechanical Institute for Negroes. In 1948 it was renamed the Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College. AAMU became fully accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1963. In June 1969, the school adopted its current name,Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University.

The new millennium saw the construction of the West Campus Complex, the erection of the 21,000-seat Louis Crews Stadium, the renovations of buildings and the moving of athletic programs up to NCAA Division I and the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC). The School of Engineering and Technology facility was built in 2002, and the Ph.D. program in Reading and Literacy was established. Andrew Hugine was approved by the board of trustees as the 11th president on June 18, 2009. In 2015, the Board of Trustees approved out-of-state scholarships for the Fall 2016 semester. The scholarships are contingent on prospective students meeting various academic qualifications.

==Campus==

The campus grounds were designed by the Olmsted Brothers firm. The J.F. Drake Memorial Learning Resources Center was renovated in 2002, adding almost 15,000 square feet (1,400 m2), an interactive Distance Learning Auditorium, conference, study and class rooms, lounges, and computer lab. The State Black Archives Research Center and Museum is located in the James H. Wilson Building, a national registered historical structure. On the third floor, the University Archives contains a collection of AAMU-related papers, paperwork, letters, and photos. 
Louis Crews Stadium is the sixth largest stadium in Alabama. Alabama A&amp;M Events Center which opened in 2022 is home to the basketball teams, commencements and other events sits adjacent to Louis Crews Stadium.

In 1994, the Mamie Foster Student Living/Learning Complex was erected. Groundbreaking was held for the School of Business facility in 1995 and Louis Crews Stadium and Ernest L. Knight Complex Residence Hall construction began. The Engineering and Technology building known as Bond Hall was completed in 2002 and opened for classes in January 2003. The Normal Historic Preservation Association was incorporated on April 15, 2009, to help preserve and protect the Alabama A&amp;M University National Historic District. The campus is served by the Bulldog Transit Shuttle bus system. A new 600-bed residence hall was constructed and opened for students January 2018, and construction planning of a new Event Center was approved by the board of trustees in September 2019.

===Alabama Cooperative Extension System===
The Smith-Lever Act of 1914 established The Alabama Cooperative Extension System. The system provides educational outreach to the citizens of Alabama on behalf of the state&#x27;s two land grant universities: Alabama A&amp;M University and Auburn University. The system employs more than 800 faculty, professional educators, and staff members operating in offices in each of Alabama&#x27;s 67 counties and in nine urban centers covering the major regions of the state. In conjunction with the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station, the system also staffs six extension and research centers located in the state&#x27;s principal geographic regions. Since 2004, &quot;Alabama Extension&quot; has functioned primarily as a regionally based system in which the bulk of educational programming is delivered by agents operating across a multi-county area and specializing in specific fields. County extension coordinators and county agents work with regional agents and other extension personnel to deliver services to clients within their areas.

<doc id="874229" wikidata="Q7373595" url="?curid=874229" title="Royal Air Force Air Cadets">
<text>The Royal Air Force Air Cadets (RAFAC) is the combined volunteer-military youth organisation sponsored by the Royal Air Force, which is formed by both the Air Training Corps and RAF Sections of the Combined Cadet Force. The organisation is headed by a former serving RAF officer, Commandant Air Cadets. The current commandant is Air Commodore Al Lewis.

Prior to 1 October 2017, the RAFAC was called the Air Cadet Organisation (ACO). As of 1 April 2023, the RAFAC had a strength of 42,190 cadets and 10,070 cadet force adult volunteers. Cadets are aged between 12 and 17 on entry to the organisation, and can remain until they are 18, or with special permission, until they are 20.

== Organisation ==
The RAFAC&#x27;s infrastructure consists of:
* Headquarters RAF Air Cadets (HQRAFAC) at RAF Cranwell
* 6 Regional Headquarters
* 34 Wing Headquarters
* Two National Air Cadet Adventure Training Centres
* Over 900 Air Training Corps Squadrons in the UK and overseas
* Around 200 RAF contingents of the Combined Cadet Force

=== Regions ===
The six regions consist of:
# London and South East Region (LaSER)
# South West Region (SW)
# Wales and West Region (W&amp;W)
# Central and East Region (C&amp;E)
# North Region 
# Scotland and Northern Ireland Region (S&amp;NI)

Each Region is commanded by a &quot;Regional Commandant&quot; (RC), who holds the rank of group captain, and is usually retired regular RAF. The Region is further staffed by a number of cadet forces adult volunteers (CFAV) who maintain the day-to-day operations of each of the regions. Examples of these CFAV posts include Region Staff Officer, Region Training Officer, and Region STEM Officer.

=== RAFAC Sections of the CCF ===

Air Cadet sections within the Combined Cadet Force usually follow their own chain of command within their school&#x27;s unit. Above their school unit, they diverge into the same chain of command as the Air Training Corps, which is usually their Wing, or Region.

== Activities ==

Air Cadet activities vary vastly, however some of the most common to take place include:

*First aid
*Radio
*NavEx (Navigational Exercise)
*Physical activities
*Drill and Discipline
*Band and Music

There are also more rare, but enriching activities that take place also. Examples include:

*Gliding, at a Volunteer Gliding Squadron (VGS)
*Flying (on an RAF base)
*RAF base visits
*Shooting
*International trips/base visits to RAF Akrotiri
*International Air Cadet Exchange (Exchange program within the Cadets of other Air Forces)

==See also==
*Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch)
*Air Experience Flight
*Volunteer Gliding Squadrons
*Air Defence Cadet Corps (1938–41)
*Royal Air Force boy entrants

<doc id="874231" wikidata="Q228220" url="?curid=874231" title="Refuge in Buddhism">
<text>In Buddhism, refuge or taking refuge refers to a religious practice which often includes a prayer or recitation performed at the beginning of the day or of a practice session. Its object is typically the Three Jewels (also known as the Triple Gem or Three Refuges, Pali: &quot;ti-ratana&quot; or &quot;ratana-ttaya&quot;; Sanskrit: &quot;tri-ratna&quot; or &quot;ratna-traya&quot;), which are the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. Taking refuge is a form of aspiration to lead a life with the Triple Gem at its core. In early Buddhist scriptures, taking refuge is an expression of determination to follow the Buddha&#x27;s path, but not a relinquishing of responsibility. Refuge is common to all major schools of Buddhism.

Since the period of Early Buddhism, all Theravada and mainstream Mahayana schools only take refuge in the Triple Gem. However, the Vajrayana school includes an expanded refuge formula known as the Three Jewels and Three Roots.

==Overview==


Since the period of Early Buddhism, devotees expressed their faith through the act of taking refuge, which is threefold. These are the three supports or jewels in which a Sutrayana Buddhist takes refuge: 
* The Buddha, the fully enlightened one (i.e. the figure of Sakyamuni Buddha)
* The Dharma, the Buddhist teachings expounded by the Buddha
* The Sangha, the monastic order of Buddhism that practices and preserves the Dharma.

In this, it centres on the authority of a Buddha as a supremely awakened being, by assenting to a role for a Buddha as a teacher of both humans and &quot;devās&quot; (heavenly beings). This often includes other Buddhas from the past, and Buddhas who have not yet arisen. Secondly, the taking of refuge honours the truth and efficacy of the Buddha&#x27;s spiritual doctrine, which includes the characteristics of phenomenon () such as their impermanence (), and the Noble Eightfold Path to liberation. The taking of refuge ends with the acceptance of worthiness of the community of spiritually developed followers (the saṅgha), which is mostly defined as the monastic community, but may also include lay people and even &quot;devās&quot; provided they are nearly or completely enlightened. Early Buddhism did not include &quot;bodhisattvas&quot; in the Three Refuges, because they were considered to still be on the path to enlightenment.

Early texts describe the saṅgha as a &quot;field of merit&quot;, because early Buddhists regard offerings to them as particularly karmically fruitful. Lay devotees support and revere the saṅgha, of which they believe it will render them merit and bring them closer to enlightenment. At the same time, the Buddhist monk is given a significant role in promoting and upholding faith among laypeople. Although many examples in the canon are mentioned of well-behaved monks, there are also cases of monks misbehaving. In such cases, the texts describe that the Buddha responds with great sensitivity to the perceptions of the lay community. When the Buddha sets out new rules in the monastic code to deal with the wrongdoings of his monastics, he usually states that such behavior should be curbed, because it would not &quot;persuade non-believers&quot; and &quot;believers will turn away&quot;. He expects monks, nuns and novices not only to lead the spiritual life for their own benefit, but also to uphold the faith of the people. On the other hand, they are not to take the task of inspiring faith to the extent of hypocrisy or inappropriateness, for example, by taking on other professions apart from being a monastic, or by courting favours by giving items to the laypeople.

Faith in the three jewels is an important teaching element in both Theravada and Mahayana traditions. In contrast to perceived Western notions of faith, faith in Buddhism arises from accumulated experience and reasoning. In the &quot;Kalama Sutra&quot;, the Buddha explicitly argues against simply following authority or tradition, particularly those of religions contemporary to the Buddha&#x27;s time. There remains value for a degree of trusting confidence and belief in Buddhism, primarily in the spiritual attainment and salvation or enlightenment. Faith in Buddhism centres on belief in the Three Jewels.

In Mahayana Buddhism, the three jewels are understood in a different sense than in Sravakayana or non-Mahayana forms of Buddhism. For example, the Buddha is usually explained through the Mahayana doctrine of the three bodies (trikaya).

According to the Mahayana treatise titled &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; (&quot;Analysis of the Jeweled Lineage&quot;), the true meaning of the triple gem is as follows:

* The Buddha is without beginning, middle and end. The Buddha is peace. The Buddha is uncompounded (&quot;asamskrta&quot;), and spontaneous (&quot;anabhoga&quot;) Dharmakaya. The Buddha is self-enlightened and self arisen wisdom (jñana), compassion and power for the benefit of others.
* The Dharma is described as the reality which is cessation. This is described as neither existence nor non-existence. It is non-conceptual reality as well as the reality of the path which consists of luminous and stainless jñana that removes all defilement. It is also equated with the dharmakaya.
* The Sangha refers to those beings who realize the true luminous nature of the mind and the &quot;full extent of what is&quot; (&quot;yavad bhavikataya&quot;) as well as the supreme qualities that make them a refuge.

According to the Tibetan Buddhist master Longchenpa:

According to the Mahayana approach, the buddha is the totality of the three kayas; the dharma encompasses scriptural transmission (contained in the sutras and tantras) and the realization of one’s self-knowing timeless awareness (including the views, states of meditative absorption, and so forth associated with stages such as those of development and completion); and the sangha is made up of bodhisattvas, masters of awareness, and other spiritually advanced beings (other than buddhas) whose nature is such that they are on the paths of learning and no more learning.

Thus, for Mahayana Buddhism, the Buddha jewel includes innumerable Buddhas (like Amitabha, Vajradhara and Vairocana), not just Sakyamuni Buddha. Likewise, the Dharma jewel includes the Mahayana sutras and (for certain sects of Mahayana) may also include the Buddhist tantras, not just the Tipitaka. Finally, the Sangha jewel includes numerous beings that are not part of the monastic sangha proper, including high level bodhisattvas like Avalokiteshvara, Vajrapani, Manjushri and so on.

== Recitation in Pali ==

The most used recitation in Pali:

Except this there are various recitations mentioned in Pali literature for taking refuge in the Three Jewels. Brett Shults proposes that Pali texts may employ the Brahmanical motif of a group of three refuges, as found in Rig Veda 9.97.47, Rig Veda 6.46.9 and Chandogya Upanishad 2.22.3-4.

== Precepts ==
Lay followers often undertake five precepts in the same ceremony as they take the refuges. Monks administer the precepts to the laypeople, which creates an additional psychological effect. The five precepts are:

# not killing;
# not stealing;
# not misusing sex;
# not engaging in false speech;
# not indulging in intoxicants.

A layperson who upholds the precepts is described in the texts as a &quot;jewel among laymen&quot;.

== Refuge in Vajrayana ==

In Tibetan Buddhism there are three refuge formulations, the &quot;Outer&quot;, &quot;Inner&quot;, and &quot;Secret&quot; forms of the Three Jewels. The &#x27;Outer&#x27; form is the &#x27;Triple Gem&#x27;, (Sanskrit:&quot;triratna&quot;), the &#x27;Inner&#x27; is the Three Roots and the &#x27;Secret&#x27; form is the &#x27;Three Bodies&#x27; or trikaya of a Buddha.

These alternative refuge formulations are employed by those undertaking deity yoga and other tantric practices within the Tibetan Buddhist Vajrayana tradition.

== Triratna symbol ==

The Triratna ( or ; or ) is a Buddhist symbol, thought to visually represent the Three Jewels of Buddhism (the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha).

The Triratna symbol is composed of:

* A lotus flower within a circle.
* A diamond rod, or vajra.
* An ananda-chakra.
* A trident, or trisula, with three branches, representing the threefold jewels of Buddhism: Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.

On representations of the footprint of the Buddha, the Triratna is usually also surmounted by the Dhamma wheel.

The Triratna can be found on frieze sculptures at Sanchi as the symbol crowning a flag standard (2nd century BCE), as a symbol of the Buddha installed on the Buddha&#x27;s throne (2nd century BCE), as the crowning decorative symbol on the later gates at the stupa in Sanchi (2nd century CE), or, very often on the Buddha footprint (starting from the 1st century CE).

The triratna can be further reinforced by being surmounted with three dharma wheels (one for each of the three jewels of Buddhism: the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha).

The triratna symbol is also called &quot;nandipada&quot;, or &quot;bull&#x27;s hoof&quot;, by Hindus.

=== Coins ===
A number of examples of the triratna symbol appear on historical coins of Buddhist kingdoms in the Indian subcontinent. For example, the triratna appears on the first century BCE coins of the Kuninda Kingdom. It also surmounts the depictions of stupas, on some the coins of Abdagases I of the Indo-Scythian of the first century CE and on the coins of the Kushan Empire, such as those coined by Vima Kadphises, also of the first century.

<doc id="874233" wikidata="Q3486616" url="?curid=874233" title="Sleeper (car)">
<text>A sleeper (American English) or Q-car (British English) is a car that boasts high performance while having an unassuming exterior. Sleepers are usually developed on the platform of a non-athletic class of vehicle, most often that of an economy car. In addition to looking modest, a sleeper car may sometimes appear to be a &quot;beater&quot; — a car that is in a visibly poor condition due to seeming neglect and lack of maintenance on the owner&#x27;s part — though this is intentional and commonly described as &quot;all go and no show&quot;; these cars are internally modified to achieve very competitive levels of performance while being presented as a standard or neglected car. The American name for this type of vehicle comes from the term sleeper agent, whereas the British name is derived from the Q-ships used by the Royal Navy.

The British term has been in use since the aftermath of World War II. In the February 1963 issue of &quot;Motor Sport&quot; magazine, British journalist Bill Boddy states: &quot;the modifications carried out by Lotus have turned the Lotus Cortina into a &#x27;Q&#x27; car par excellence&quot; in a highlight of the high-performance Cortina&#x27;s unassuming exterior. Likewise, in the 1956 British film &quot;The Long Arm&quot; (known as &quot;The Third Key&quot; in the United States), the term is used in reference to unmarked police cars patrolling the city of London by night, indicating that it was in use among British law enforcement at least a decade earlier.

In July 1964, British magazine &quot;Motorcycle Mechanics&quot; carried an announcement from editor Bill Lawless of the use of two unmarked police &quot;Q-cars&quot; — a black Daimler SP250 and a green Austin A40 Farina — patrolling the A20, a road between London and Maidstone.

==Beginnings in the Western world==
The Chrysler 300 letter series began in 1955 with the Chrysler C-300. With a 331 in3 (5.4 L) FirePower V8, the engine was the first in a production passenger car to be rated at , and was by a comfortable margin the most powerful in American cars of the time. By 1957, with the 300C, power was up to . These cars were among the first sleepers, marketed as high-end luxury cars from the traditional luxury marque Chrysler, but with a high-end homologation racing engine. However, these cars lose their &quot;sleeper value&quot; due to both their rarity (this series was highly luxurious; it was made in limited numbers and examples are very expensive), and the well publicized successes of Carl Kiekhaefer in NASCAR racing (1955–1956); though the model is an important precursor of the muscle car.

The 1968 Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3 was a powerful sedan with a subdued exterior. A trend of overtly powerful saloon cars with subtle body modifications is exemplified by the work of Mercedes-AMG and Brabus on unassuming Mercedes saloons.

The 1986 Lancia Thema 8.32, fitted with a Ferrari V8 engine, has been described by &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; as &quot;one of the weirder sleepers to come out of the 1980s&quot;.

The car which is most often credited as the start of the production Q-car trend in Europe is the 1990 Lotus Omega, which started out as an Opel Omega/Vauxhall Carlton.

==In the Soviet Union==
The first Q-car was invented by the Soviet NKVD in 1938, when imported Ford flathead V8 engines were installed in GAZ-M1 cars. After WWII they were replaced by GAZ M-20G cars equipped with adapted powertrain from GAZ-12 ZIM and special-purpose equipment. Those, as well as their successors, were available either in black color (sometimes in GAI road police livery) for the security details of the KGB&#x27;s 9th Directorate or in common colors for the surveillance teams of the 7th Directorate. After the M-20 was discontinued, 603 GAZ-23 cars were produced in 1962-1970, combining modified GAZ-21 body with slanted GAZ-13 engine and transmission, better brakes and KGB equipment. They were followed by similar GAZ-24 modifications: GAZ-24-24, -25, -34 and -35, over 2000 mostly produced during 1970s and 1980s. GAZ-31012 and 31013 based on the GAZ-3102 were only produced in black in very small numbers (~300) starting from 1985. In Post-Soviet Russia the practice was discontinued, with special services acquiring imported cars.

==Owner-modified cars==
Some vehicle owners create sleepers by swapping more powerful engines, or making other performance modifications, like adding a supercharger or turbocharger, leaving the external appearance as it came from the factory. Sometimes hints of the car&#x27;s true nature are visible: wider tires, a lower stance, or a different engine tone or exhaust note. Gauges and instrumentation are often kept to a minimum. Some owners go as far as to use weight reduction techniques employed by other performance enthusiasts, removing items not fundamental to street racing, such as rear seats, trim, spare tire, air conditioner, power steering, or heater; bumpers and headlights may also be replaced with lighter items.
