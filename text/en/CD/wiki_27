<text>Esperanto vocabulary and grammatical forms derive primarily from the Romance languages, with substantial contributions from Germanic languages. The language occupies a middle ground between &quot;naturalistic&quot; constructed languages such as Interlingua, which borrow words &quot;en masse&quot; from their source languages with little internal derivation, and &quot;a priori&quot; conlangs such as Solresol, in which the words have no historical connection to other languages. In Esperanto, root words are borrowed and retain much of the form of their source language, whether the phonetic form ( from international &quot;ex-,&quot; from German , from French ) or orthographic form ( and from English &quot;team&quot; and &quot;boat,&quot; from French ). However, each root can then form dozens of derivations which may bear little resemblance to equivalent words in the source languages, such as (government), which is derived from the Latinate root (to rule) but has a morphology closer to German or Russian.

==Source languages==
Zamenhof took most of his Esperanto root words from languages of the Italic and Germanic families, principally Italian, French, German, Yiddish, and English. A large number are what might be called common European international vocabulary, or generic Romance: Roots common to several languages, such as &quot;man&quot;, found in English words such as &quot;virile,&quot; and &quot;eye&quot;, found in &quot;oculist.&quot; Some appear to be compromises between the primary languages, such as (to thunder), per French , Italian , German and English &quot;thunder.&quot;

===Romance and Germanic===
The main languages contributing to Zamenhof&#x27;s original vocabulary were French, English, and German/Yiddish, the modern languages most widely learned in schools around the world at the time Esperanto was devised. The result was that about two-thirds of this original vocabulary is Romance, and about one-third Germanic, including a pair of roots from Swedish:
:Comparative &quot;the&quot; (as in &quot;&quot;the&quot; more &quot;the&quot; merrier&quot;), from Swedish . (Cf. German .)
A couple of words, (street) and (yeast), are closer to Dutch (, ) than German ( , ), but this may be a compromise between German and English the way (stone) is a compromise between German and English &quot;stone&quot;. (There&#x27;s also (to snore), Dutch .) (fire) matches the pronunciation of English &quot;fire&quot;, but is also spelled and pronounced as Yiddish . Indeed, much of the supposedly German vocabulary actually appears to be Yiddish, specifically Zamenhof&#x27;s native Bialystok (Northeastern) dialect, which had formed the basis of his abortive attempt to standardize that language. Words with the digraph in German may in Esperanto have either (seemingly corresponding to the spelling) or (seemingly corresponding to the pronunciation). This pattern is not random, but reflects and in Old High German, a distinction preserved in Yiddish: (home: German but Yiddish ), (whistle: both German and Yiddish ). Zamenhof never admitted to a Yiddish influence in Esperanto, presumably to avoid arousing antisemitic prejudice.

Many of the Latinate roots were given an Italianesque appearance, corresponding to the use of Italian as a model for Esperanto pronunciation, but in form are closer to French, such as (shirt: French , Italian ) and (horse: French , Italian ).
Since Zamenhof&#x27;s day, a large amount of Latinate vocabulary has been added to the language. In 1987, Mattos calculated that 84% of basic vocabulary was Latinate, 14% Germanic, and 2% Slavic or Greek.

===Latin and Greek===
Only a few roots were taken directly from the classical languages:

:Latin: (but), (however), (after), (although), (as though), (during), (nor), (or), (today), (fir), (heron), (to go—though this form survives in the future tense in French ), (frost), the adverbial suffix , and perhaps the inherent vowels of the past and present tenses, and . Many lexical affixes are common to several languages and thus may not have a clear source, but some such as (worthy of), (a person), (undefined), and (a number together) may be Latin (e.g. the Latin gerundive , the neuter inflection ).

:Classical Greek: (and, from ), (about, from ), the plural suffix , the accusative case suffix , the inceptive prefix (from ), and perhaps the jussive mood suffix (if that is not Hebrew).

:Latin and Greek: the suffix (offspring; from Latin and Greek ). 

As in the examples of &#x27;heron&#x27; and &#x27;fir&#x27; above, the names of most plants and animals are based on their binomial nomenclature, and so many are Latin or Greek as well.

===Slavic and Lithuanian===
Surprisingly few roots appear to have come from other modern European languages, even those Zamenhof was most familiar with. What follows is a fairly comprehensive list of such roots that do not also occur in principal languages:

:Russian: (to flounder, from ), (to iron, from ), (to pronounce a guttural R, from ), (to be on duty, from ), (a sausage, from ), (except, from ), (steep, from ), (without fail, from ), (a tail, from ), the pet-name suffixes and (from and ), the augmentative suffix (from ), and perhaps the collective suffix , if this is not from Latin.

:Polish: (borscht, from ), (whether, from , perhaps also Yiddish ), (even, from ), (a grating, from ), (to solder, from ), ([your] highness, from ), (than, possibly from by analogy with ), (a ball, from ), (suspenders, from ).

:Russian or Polish: (a bread roll, from / ), (an aim, goal, from / , cognates of German ), (porridge, from / ), (to undertake, from / ), (per, from / ), (proto-, from / ), (right [in opinion], from / ), (to matchmake, from / ).

:Lithuanian: (immediately, from ); possibly also (two, from , if not from Latin ), the suffix (a number together, cf. ), and (it, from , ).

However, although few roots come directly from these languages, Russian exerted a considerable substratum influence on the semantics of Esperanto. An oft-cited example is &quot;full, complete&quot;, which is Latinate in form (French , Latin &quot;full&quot;), but has the semantic range of Russian &quot;full, complete&quot;, as can be seen in the phrase &quot;a complete dictionary&quot;, a usage not possible with the French or Latin words.

=== Other languages ===

Other languages were only represented in the original vocabulary in so far as they were cognate with, or as their words had become widespread in, Esperanto&#x27;s source languages. However, since that time many languages have contributed words for specialized or regional concepts, such as (chopsticks) from Japanese and (reindeer) from Saami.

=== Obscure roots ===
A few roots are obscure:

: (it, ), (suffix for containers), (husband)

 may possibly derive from the Lithuanian (she, it) and (he, it), and from the French (case).

Like another indirect German borrowing – (bachelor), which derives from (Miss, from German ) less the feminine suffix – the Esperanto word (husband) appears to be a back-formation of (wife). Zamenhof claimed the latter derives from (crown princess), borrowed from the German , and then internally analyzed as (crown) (prince) (wife). However, Vilborg&#x27;s argues that is more likely to have come from Yiddish (rabbi&#x27;s wife; Mrs.), reanalysed as , and that Zamenhof made up the German etymology after the fact to avoid anti-Semitic prejudice against Esperanto. That would mean that ultimately derives from the Slavic feminine suffix . Regardless, few words have histories this convoluted.

The correlatives, although clearly cognate with European languages (for example, , with French (which), (such); with Italian (each), and with the German genitive , etc.), have been analogically leveled to the point that they are often given as examples of Esperanto innovations. This is especially true for the indefinite forms like (something), which were devised by iconically removing the consonant of the and forms. Likewise, the restriction of the Italian and Greek masculine noun and adjective ending to nouns, and the feminine noun and adjective ending to adjectives and the article , is an Esperanto innovation using existing forms.

Some smaller words have been modified to the extent that they&#x27;re difficult to recognize. For example, Italian , (to) became (to) under the influence of the Italian contraction (to the), to better fit the phonotactics of Esperanto, and in a parallel change, Latin (out of) and Slavic (by, than) may have become (out of) and (than), though the latter also has the German parallel .

==Inflections ==
The Greek origin of the nominal inflections can be seen in the Greek &quot;a&quot;-declension nouns such as the word for &quot;muse&quot;: &quot;musa,&quot; plural &quot;musai,&quot; accusative &quot;musan,&quot; which in Esperanto is &quot;muzo, muzoj, muzon.&quot; Greek &quot;o&quot;-declension words such as &quot;logos, logoi, logon (word) are similar, as are adjectival declensions such as &quot;aksia, aksiai, aksian (worthy). Greek was perhaps also the model of stressed &quot;i&quot; in Esperanto words like &quot;familío&quot; (family), which follows the common Greek pattern of &quot;aksía&quot; (worthy) and &quot;oikíai&quot; (houses).

Esperanto has &quot;a/i/o&quot; ablaut for present/past/future tense, which has partial parallels in Latin present &quot;amat,&quot; perfect &quot;amavit,&quot; and the corresponding infinitives &quot;amare, amavisse.&quot; Otto Jespersen said of the ablaut,

:This play of vowels is not an original idea of Zamenhof&#x27;s: &quot;-as, -is, -os&quot; are found for the three tenses of the infinitive in Faiguet&#x27;s system of 1765; &quot;-a, -i, -o&quot; without a consonant are used like Z&#x27;s &quot;-as, -is, -os&quot; by Rudelle (1858); Courtonne in 1885 had &quot;-am, -im, -om&quot; in the same values, and the similarity with Esperanto is here even more perfect than in the other projects, as &quot;-um&quot; corresponds to Z&#x27;s &quot;-us.&quot; —An International Language (1928)

There may have been a Volapük influence as well, or the two languages may have shared a common influence from earlier languages. In Volapük, the vowels are present &quot;a-&quot;, future &quot;o-&quot;, past perfect &quot;i-&quot;, as well as imperfect &quot;ä-&quot; ; Esperanto retained a distinction between preterite &quot;-is&quot; and imperfect &quot;-es&quot; until 1887, the year the modern form of the language was published.

Jespersen didn&#x27;t parse all of the morphology. The ablaut for the five languages is as follows:

The infinitive suffix &quot;-i&quot; may derive from Latin deponent verbs, such as &quot;loqui&quot; (to speak). With elements like these that are only one or two letters long, it is difficult to know whether resemblances are due to the forms being related, or just coincidence. For example, it is speculated that the jussive &quot;-u&quot; is from the Hebrew imperative &quot;-û,&quot; but it could also be from the Greek [u] imperative of deponent verbs such as &quot;dekhou&quot; (receive!); or perhaps it was inspired by [u] being found in both Hebrew and Greek. Similarly, adverbial &quot;-e&quot; is found in Latin and Italian &quot;(bene)&quot; as well as in Russian (after a palatalized consonant); the participle bases &quot;-t-&quot; and &quot;-nt-&quot; are found in Latin, Italian, Greek, and German; and the pronominal base &quot;-i&quot; is found in Italian (&quot;-mi, -ti, -vi, -si, -gli&quot; for Esperanto &quot;mi, ci, vi, si, li&quot;) and English (&quot;me, we, he, she&quot;).

There are other parallels with prior constructed languages, such as &quot;ili&quot; &#x27;they&#x27;, the numerals &quot;un du tri&quot; and the feminine suffix &quot;-in&quot;, which are identical to Jean Pirro&#x27;s &quot;Universalglot&quot; of 1868, but it&#x27;s difficult to tell if there is a connection or if this is merely coincidence due to using similar source languages.

==Technical vocabulary==

Modern international vocabulary, much of it Latin or Greek in origin, is of course used as well, but frequently for a family of related words only the root will be borrowed directly, and the rest will be derived from it using Esperanto means of word formation. For example, the computer term &#x27;bit&#x27; was borrowed directly as &quot;bito&quot;, but &#x27;byte&#x27; was then derived by compounding &quot;bito&quot; with the numeral &quot;ok&quot; (eight), for the uniquely Esperanto word &quot;bitoko&quot; (&#x27;an octet of bits&#x27;). Although not a familiar form to speakers of European languages, the transparency of its formation is helpful to those who do not have this advantage. Moreover, even &quot;bito&quot; has the synonym &quot;duumo&quot;, based on &quot;du&quot; (two) and &quot;-um-&quot; (the affix with undefined meaning).

With the exception of perhaps a hundred common or generic plant and animal names, Esperanto adopts the international binomial nomenclature of living organisms, using suitable orthography, and changing the nominal and adjectival grammatical endings to &quot;-o&quot; and &quot;-a&quot;. For example, the binomial for the guineafowl is &quot;Numida meleagris&quot;. In Esperanto, therefore, a &quot;numido&quot; would be any bird of the genus &quot;Numida&quot;, and a &quot;meleagra numido&quot; the helmeted guineafowl specifically. Likewise, a &quot;numidedo&quot; is any bird in the guineafowl family Numididæ.

==Competing root forms==

There is some question over which inflection to use when assimilating Latin and Greek words. Zamenhof generally preferred the oblique stem over the nominative singular form, as in &quot;reĝo&quot; (king), which follows the Latin oblique forms with &quot;reg–&quot; (compare English &quot;regicide&quot;), or &quot;floro&quot; (flower) as in &quot;floral,&quot; rather than nominative singular &quot;rex&quot; and &quot;flos.&quot; However, European national standards differ in this regard, resulting in debate over the form of later &quot;international&quot; borrowings, such as whether the asteroid Pallas should be &quot;Palaso&quot; in Esperanto, parallel to French and English names &quot;Pallas,&quot; or &quot;Palado,&quot; as in Italian &quot;Pallade,&quot; Russian &quot;Паллада&quot; (&quot;Palláda&quot;), and the English adjective &quot;Palladian.&quot; In some cases there are three possibilities, as can be seen in the English noun &quot;helix&quot; (&quot;x&quot; = [ks]), its plural &quot;helices&quot; (&quot;c&quot; = [s]), and its adjective &quot;helical&quot; (&quot;c&quot; = [k]). Although the resulting potential for conflict is frequently criticized, it does present an opportunity to disambiguate what would otherwise be homonyms based on culturally specific and often fossilized metaphors. For example, &quot;Venuso&quot; (the planet Venus) may be distinguished from &quot;Venero&quot; (the goddess Venus), all three of the forms of Latin &quot;helix&quot; are found as Esperanto roots, one with the original meaning, and the other two representing old metaphors: &quot;helico&quot; (a spiral), &quot;heliko&quot; (a snail), &quot;helikso&quot; (the incurved rim of the ear).

Normally the Latin or Greek inflectional ending is replaced with the Esperanto inflectional ending &quot;−o.&quot; However, the original inflection will occasionally be retained, as if it were part of the root, in order to disambiguate from a more common word. For example, a virus (from Latin &quot;vir-us)&quot; is &quot;virus-o&quot; instead of the expected &quot;*vir-o&quot; in order to avoid confusion with &quot;vir-o&quot; (a man), and the Latin root &quot;corp-us&quot; is the source of both &quot;korp-o&quot; (a living body) and &quot;korpus-o&quot; (a military corps). Similarly, when the sound &quot;ĥ&quot; is replaced with &quot;k,&quot; as it commonly is (see Esperanto phonology), the word &quot;ĥoro&quot; (a chorus) is replaced with &quot;koruso&quot; to avoid creating a homonym with &quot;koro&quot; (a heart). The redundant inflection may have been inspired by Lithuanian, which otherwise contributed relatively little to Esperanto: compare &quot;fokuso&quot; (focus), &quot;kokoso&quot; (coconut), &quot;lotuso&quot; (lotus), &quot;patoso&quot; (pathos), &quot;radiuso&quot; (radius), &quot;sinuso&quot; (sine), and &quot;viruso&quot; (virus), with Lithuanian &quot;fokusas, kokosas, lotosas, patosas, radiusas, sinusas,&quot; and &quot;virusas&quot; (virus) vs. &quot;vyras&quot; (man).

==Traces of Proto-Esperanto==
Proto-Esperanto had voicing ablaut, traces of which remain in a few pairs of words such as &quot;pezi&quot; &#x27;to weigh&#x27; (to have weight) and &quot;pesi&quot; &#x27;to weigh&#x27; (to measure the weight). Because little of Proto-Esperanto is attested, it is not clear which other aspects of Esperanto etymology might date to this period.

<doc id="881276" wikidata="Q2276981" url="?curid=881276" title="Tamara Toumanova">
<text>Tamara Toumanova (; 2 March 1919 – 29 May 1996) was a Russian-born Georgian-American prima ballerina and actress. A child of exiles in Paris after the Russian Revolution of 1917, she made her debut at the age of 10 at the children&#x27;s ballet of the Paris Opera.

She became known internationally as one of the Baby Ballerinas of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo after being discovered by her fellow émigré, balletmaster and choreographer George Balanchine. She was featured in numerous ballets in Europe. Balanchine featured her in his productions at Ballet Theatre, New York, making her the star of his performances in the United States. While most of Toumanova&#x27;s career was dedicated to ballet, she appeared as a ballet dancer in several films, beginning in 1944. She became a naturalized United States citizen in 1943 in Los Angeles, California.

==Career==
Toumanova was the daughter of Yevgenia (or Eugenia) Dmitrievna Toumanishvili, who was half-Georgian-Armenian on her father&#x27;s side, and half-Georgian on her mother&#x27;s side. Her father was Dmitri Toumanov, originally of Georgian Toumanishvili family; her mother was Yelizaveta Chkheidze.

At the time of her daughter&#x27;s birth, Yevgenia was married to Konstantin Zakharov (a Russian). Both Tamara and her mother used the surname Khassidovitch (Yevgenia&#x27;s second husband was Vladimir Khassidovitch (akas: Vladimir Khassidovitch-Boretsky/Vladimir Khazidovich-Boretsky) for most of their lives following the end of Yevgenia&#x27;s first marriage, including on their paperwork for naturalization as citizens of the United States.

After moving to Paris, Toumanova was given piano lessons and studied ballet with Olga Preobrajenska, whom she described as her &quot;first and only permanent teacher&quot; and an &quot;immortal friend&quot;.

At the age of six, Toumanova was invited by the ballerina Anna Pavlova to perform in one of her gala concerts in 1925. Toumanova danced a polka choreographed by Preobrajenska. Tamara was 10 years old when she made her debut at the Paris Opera as a child étoile in the ballet &quot;L&#x27;Éventail de Jeanne&quot; (for which 10 French composers wrote the music). 

In 1931, when Toumanova was 12 years old, George Balanchine saw her in ballet class and engaged her for de Basil&#x27;s Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, along with Irina Baronova (aged 12) and Tatiana Riabouchinska (aged 14). The three girls were an immediate success, and writer Arnold Haskell dubbed them the &quot;baby ballerinas&quot;.

Toumanova became recognised as a young prodigy of immense talent. She came to be called &quot;The Black Pearl of the Russian Ballet&quot;, because, as ballet critic A. V. Coton wrote, &quot;she was the loveliest creature in the history of the ballet&quot;, with black silky hair, deep brown eyes and pale almond skin. Toumanova was considered the most glamorous of the trio. Throughout her dynamic career, her mother was her devoted companion, nursemaid, dresser, agent and manager – she was always at the helm.

Balanchine created the role of the &quot;Young Girl&quot; for Toumanova in his ballet &quot;Cotillon&quot; and had her star in his &quot;Concurrence&quot; and &quot;Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme&quot;. Léonide Massine worked closely with Toumanova in the creation of many of his ballets. She played the part of the Top in his &quot;Jeux d&#x27;Enfants&quot;. Balanchine created a role for her in his &quot;Le Palais de Cristal&quot; (since re-titled &quot;Symphony in C&quot;) in 1947 at the Paris Opera. 

In 1936, while Toumanova was performing ballet in Chicago, an 18-year-old boy named Burr Tillstrom came to see her perform. Following the ballet, Burr went backstage to meet her. As they talked, Toumanova and Tillstrom became friends. Some time later, Tillstrom showed her a favorite puppet he had made and she, surprised by his revelation, exclaimed &quot;Kukla&quot; (Russian for &quot;puppet&quot;). Burr Tillstrom went on to create a very early (1947) television show for children, titled &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot;.

===Toumanova on film===

Toumanova appeared in six Hollywood films between 1944 and 1970, always playing dancers. She made her feature film debut in 1944, in &quot;Days of Glory&quot;, playing a Russian dancer being saved from the invading Germans in 1941 by Soviet partisan leader Gregory Peck (who also made his debut in that film).

In 1953, she played Russian prima ballerina Anna Pavlova in &quot;Tonight We Sing&quot;, and in 1954, she appeared in the biographical musical &quot;Deep in My Heart&quot; as the French dancer Gaby Deslys. In 1956, she performed a dance scene with Gene Kelly in &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot;. In 1966, she played the odious, unnamed lead ballerina in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s political thriller &quot;Torn Curtain&quot;. In 1970, she played Russian ballerina Madame Petrova in Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

==Personal life==
Some sources indicate that Tamara Toumanova was born Tamara Vladimirovna Khassidovitch in Siberia, while her mother, Princess Eugenia (later Eugenie) Dmitrievna Toumanova was fleeing Georgia in search of her husband (Vladimir Khassidovitch),).

Toumanova was of partial Georgian, Armenian and Polish descent. Singer Lyudmila Lopato, who personally knew Toumanova, wrote that &quot;Tamara was of Armenian-Polish descent, not a Georgian Princess, as many people think&quot;. Tamara herself highlighted her Georgian heritage on many occasions – &quot;I think he saw kinship with me, with my tristesse, with my being part Georgian.&quot;; &quot;My mother, Evgeniya Toumanova, was a Georgian, a Chkheidze by birth, from Tbilisi. Sometimes she used to speak Georgian to me.&quot;; etc. This is further confirmed by her family&#x27;s official documents in Georgia and the Russian Empire, including that of her uncle (mother&#x27;s brother) Prince Zachary Dmitrievich Tumanov, whose ethnicity is stated as &quot;Georgian&quot;. Tamara&#x27;s parents were deeply religious. Tamara, her mother and her maternal grandmother, Princess Elizabeth Chkhedize, were Georgian/Russian Orthodox, while Toumanova&#x27;s maternal grandfather Prince Dmitry Toumanov was a follower of the Armenian Apostolic Church.

Toumanova&#x27;s parents had become separated during the Russian Revolution. She was 18 months old before the family reunited. The family escaped from Russia via Vladivostok.

In 1944, Toumanova married Casey Robinson, whom she met as the producer and screenwriter of &quot;Days of Glory&quot;, her first film. The union was childless. The couple divorced on 13 October 1955.

==Death==
Toumanova died in Santa Monica, California, on 29 May 1996, aged 77, from undisclosed causes. Before her death, she gave her Preobrajenska costumes to the Vaganova Choreographic Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. Her funeral was a high mass at the Russian Orthodox Holy Virgin Mary Cathedral, Los Angeles. She was buried next to her mother Princess Eugenie in Hollywood, Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

British choreographer John Gregory described Toumanova as a &quot;remarkable artist – a great personality who never stopped acting. It is impossible to think of Russian ballet without her.&quot;

He was a student at the University of Sydney at the same time as other notable Australians including Clive James, Germaine Greer, Les Murray, John Bell, Robert Hughes and Mungo McCallum. He lived in Sydney with the author and screenwriter Anne Brooksbank; they had three children.

==Early years==
Ellis was raised a Seventh-day Adventist. He says the &quot;seminal moment&quot; of his life happened when he was ten and his 22-year-old sister was killed while crossing the road. He attended Lismore High and then the University of Sydney on a Sir Robert Menzies scholarship. After graduating he had a variety of jobs before being employed by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

==Writing career==
Ellis was a regular contributor to the &quot;Nation Review&quot; in the 1970s and subsequently contributed to Fairfax Media newspapers and &quot;The National Times.&quot;

Ellis became a popular playwright, usually working in collaboration. In 1970 he and Michael Boddy (1934–2014) co-wrote &quot;The Legend of King O&#x27;Malley&quot;, a musical play based on the life of King O&#x27;Malley. From 1975 to 1986 he and Brooksbank also owned the Stables Theatre in Kings Cross, Sydney, during which time it became home to the Griffin Theatre Company.&quot;&quot; They sold it in 1986 for $200,000.

Ellis wrote several film scripts, often in collaboration with others, notably &quot;Newsfront&quot; (1978), &quot;...Maybe This Time&quot; (1980, with Anne Brooksbank), &quot;Fatty Finn&quot; (1980) &quot;Man of Flowers&quot; (1983, with Paul Cox), &quot;Goodbye Paradise&quot; (1983), &quot;Where the Green Ants Dream&quot; (&quot;Wo die grünen Ameisen träumen&quot;) (1984, with Werner Herzog), &quot;My First Wife&quot; (1984, with Paul Cox), &quot;Cactus&quot; (1986, with Paul Cox) and &quot;The Nostradamus Kid&quot; (1992).

In 1980 Ellis signed a contract with the New South Wales Film Corporation to write ten feature film scripts over two years for $7,000 for each script, with a payment of $12,000 for the second draft if they wanted to make the movie. Ellis says he presented them with 33 ideas, they chose five and he chose five.

Ellis also directed several films, including &quot;The Nostradamus Kid&quot; (1992), &quot;Warm Nights on a Slow Moving Train&quot; (1988), &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; (1985) and &quot;Run Rabbit, Run&quot; (2007).

Ellis&#x27;s writing for television included the miniseries &quot;True Believers&quot; (with co-author Matt Carroll) and &quot;Infamous Victory: Ben Chifley&#x27;s Battle for Coal&quot; (2008), with co-author Geoff Burton, made for Film Australia.

==Awards==
Ellis won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Screenplay three times: &quot;Newsfront&quot; (1978, with Anne Brooksbank and Phillip Noyce), &quot;Goodbye Paradise&quot; (1982, with Denny Lawrence), and &quot;My First Wife&quot; (1984, with Paul Cox).

== Politics ==
Ellis, a supporter of the Australian Labor Party, wrote speeches for a number of Labor leaders (such as Bob Carr, Paul Keating and Kim Beazley) and wrote extensively on Labor history.

Regarding Ellis&#x27;s speech writing, Beazley said on the &quot;7.30 Report&quot; that if he had used any of Ellis&#x27;s speeches he would have been out of politics.

Ellis unsuccessfully contested the Federal seat of Mackellar as an independent candidate against the Liberal Party&#x27;s Bronwyn Bishop in a by-election in 1994 as the ALP did not field a candidate in that by-election.

Ellis&#x27;s 2011 book &quot;Suddenly, Last Winter – An Election Diary&quot; created headlines for its criticism of the Labor Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, and praise for the Liberal Opposition Leader, Tony Abbott. He described Gillard as &quot;not well informed&quot; and &quot;sudden, firm and wrong&quot; in everything she does. He also said &quot;She has no power, no influence, no friends, no learning. There&#x27;s not much there&quot;, while describing Abbott as having &quot;good manners&quot;, being &quot;formidable&quot; and possessing a &quot;first-class mind&quot;.

Ellis wrote speeches for South Australian Premier Mike Rann for a number of years.

==Death==
On 18 July 2015, Ellis reported on his blog that he would be attending hospital for what he called &quot;ominous&quot; tests on his liver. The next day he announced &quot;The news is very bad&quot;, and that the tests had revealed he had advanced liver cancer with a prognosis that he had months, if not weeks, to live.

Ellis died on 3 April 2016, at his home in Sydney&#x27;s Northern Beaches.

== Controversy ==
In June 2018, Kate and Rozanna Lilley, daughters of celebrated playwright Dorothy Hewett, alleged that they had engaged in consensual sex at the ages of 15 and 14 with Ellis. Ellis was castigated by feminists including Delaney and Maley. 

== Writings ==
Ellis wrote two books, &quot;Goodbye Jerusalem&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Babylon&quot;, on his experiences of the Labor Party. The first edition of &quot;Goodbye Jerusalem&quot; was pulped following a successful defamation case brought by two Liberal cabinet ministers, Tony Abbott and Peter Costello, and their wives. At issue was the single sentence where Ellis quoted politician Rodney Cavalier as having said, &quot;Abbott and Costello...they&#x27;re both in the Right wing of the Labour [sic] Party till the one woman fucked both of them and married one of them and inducted them into the Young Liberals&quot;. The publisher, Random House, accepted that the disputed content was a falsehood and the book was removed from sale. ACT Supreme Court Justice Higgins awarded the two politicians and their wives a total of $277,000 damages. A new edition of the book was published three months later which omitted the defamatory passage.

In 1998 Penguin Books Australia published Ellis&#x27;s &quot;First Abolish the Customer – 202 Arguments Against Economic Rationalism&quot;, then Ellis&#x27;s &quot;The Capitalism Delusion – How Global Economics Wrecked Everything and What To Do About It&quot; in 2009, &quot;One Hundred Days of Summer&quot; in 2010, and &quot;The Ellis Laws&quot; in 2014.

<text>Laurie Hok Si Chan (; born April 6, 1965) is a politician and diplomat from the Solomon Islands. He served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2002 to 2006 and served in the National Parliament as MP for West Guadalcanal Constituency from 2001 to 2010. In May 2009, he was named Minister of Justice and Legal Affairs in Prime Minister Derek Sikua&#x27;s government, and was fired from this same position in April 2010.

Chan was first elected to the National Parliament in the December 2001 election and served as Minister for Finance and Treasury from March 30, 2002, until December 8, 2002. He was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs on December 12, 2002, and served in that position until May 5, 2006, when he was removed from office following the resignation of Snyder Rini as Prime Minister on April 26, 2006.

Chan&#x27;s father, businessman Thomas Koh Chan (陳國強) and leader of the Association of Independent Members party, has been accused of helping bring Rini to power through bribery.

Chan was a member of the Bills and Legislation Committee in Parliament from May 2006 until the end of his term in 2010.

He did not stand as a candidate to defend his seat in the August 2010 general election, standing down from Parliament. Moses Garu succeeded him as MP for West Guadalcanal.

In 2011, he was appointed as ambassador to Taiwan. The Solomons are one of the few countries to recognise the Republic of China rather than the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and Chan had supported continued relations with Taiwan when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs. He began to serve as ambassador on 21 March 2012.

Laura Gibson (Sigrid Thornton), a high-flying city lawyer, is prompted to undergo a sea change with her children Miranda and Rupert after her husband is arrested for fraud and is found to have had an affair with her sister.

The town is isolated from the rest of the world since the local bridge was destroyed in one of the natural disasters common to Pearl Bay.

==Series overview==

Season 1

In the opening episode, &quot;Something Rich and Strange&quot;, we are introduced to Laura Gibson, a high-flying corporate lawyer. In one day, her life falls apart: she loses out on a partnership at work, and discovers that her husband has been arrested for fraud and that her sister Trudi (Fiona Corke) is having an affair with him. On a whim, she takes a job as a magistrate in the small seaside town of Pearl Bay, where she once had a holiday with her family during happier times.

In Pearl Bay, she meets a cast of colourful characters: Meredith Monahan, the woman who can remember every single event that has happened in town during her lifetime; Meredith&#x27;s longtime lover and town lawyer/drunk, Harold; strapping surfer and court clerk Angus; his girlfriend (and would-be fiancee), police officer Karen; her superior Sergeant Grey; unsophisticated caravan park manager and handyman, Kevin; Kevin&#x27;s son Trevor; clever Indian shop-keeper Phrani, later to be Kevin&#x27;s lover; local layabout Griff; Meredith&#x27;s niece, the wandering Carmen; corrupt and scheming real estate agent and shire president Bob Jelly; his loyal trophy wife Heather; and their children Craig and Jules.

While Laura&#x27;s children, Rupert and Miranda, struggle to get used to their new life, Laura attempts to fit in, despite their run-down house and the eccentric court cases. Both helping and hindering her is Diver Dan, the enigmatic cafe owner/ferryman/chef with no ambition but a curious and colourful past, with whom she soon strikes up a relationship.

The first series ends with a series of climaxes involving Carmen&#x27;s pregnancy, the discovery of Meredith and Harold&#x27;s long-lost daughter; and a turning point in Laura and Dan&#x27;s relationship.

After a successful first series of 13 episodes, the ABC asked for more.

Season 2

David Wenham opted not to renew his contract, so, two episodes into the second series, Diver Dan leaves Pearl Bay for the Galapagos Islands. In his place comes old friend Max Connors and wife Elena (Doris Younane). Max has much to deal with, having left the town years earlier and leaving his family. His wife&#x27;s sudden death stuns the town. Storm damage in the aftermath of the first series means that Pearl Bay goes through serious trauma and things only get worse. Alison Whyte guest stars as a con artist who gets the better of Bob, and of the whole town. Heather bonds with her parents. Rupert&#x27;s determination to get Laura back together with her ex-husband only meets with disaster. Later in the series, the town begins to speculate about Max and Laura&#x27;s relationship, and the resulting confusion brings them closer.

Bucket&#x27;s dog Alfonzo Dominico Jones dies mysteriously and eventually a swimming pool is named after him, in preference to the originally planned name, the Jelly Aquatic Complex.

The ABC then commissioned a third season.

Season 3

In the third season, the events of the show reach their climax. Laura decides not to take the step in her relationship with Max, propelling a despondent Max into Carmen&#x27;s arms. An in-denial Laura turns to the sweet but dull Warwick (Shaun Micallef). Heather and Bob&#x27;s separation is followed by his political demise. Meredith&#x27;s health takes a turn for the worse. Mark Mitchell guest stars as Morton Tregonning, administrator for the recently sacked Port Deakin council, and his corruption pushes Bob to a decision; he must choose whether to help the people of Pearl Bay, or ruin them once and for all.

The final episode, &quot;Half-Life&quot; (Episode 39), sees the town coming together to stop Tregonning&#x27;s nuclear waste dump, Miranda and Craig on trial, Laura&#x27;s resignation, Karen and Angus&#x27; wedding, Meredith facing a brush with death following a stroke, Bob making a final decision about his future and spurning Tregonning, and Max and Laura&#x27;s relationship resolved in a night of passion. Morton Tregonning meets a bitter end.

Although the third series was successful in ratings terms, the creators decided to end the show to avoid becoming stale.

Revival

Season 4

In October 2018, a fourth season was announced which aired on the Nine Network in 2019. The series was funded by Screen Australia and relocated from Barwon Heads to Brunswick Heads, near Byron Bay, in northern New South Wales, and also at Billinudgel and Mullumbimby. This was after a successful bid by NSW to host the series in a community that the producers had considered as a set location in the 1990s, but rejected for cost reasons. ITV&#x27;s David Mott said while there had been discussions with the ABC about reviving the series for ABC Television, ABC said a revival of SeaChange did not feel right for them. It was directed by series co-creator Deb Cox and jointly produced by ITV Studios Australia and Every Cloud Productions. The series was titled “SeaChange: Paradise Reclaimed”.

Thornton and Howard were two of the original actors to appear in the revival. It focused on the relationships between Laura, Miranda, Miranda&#x27;s son, and Laura&#x27;s daughter by Max. The series opens with Laura returning to Pearl Bay from aid work in South Africa to visit her daughter Miranda, who she finds is 8 months pregnant, after two decades. Entering the town over a bridge that still provides limited access, she accidentally knocks down Bob Jelly, just released from prison, with her car on the main street. Jelly features in all the episodes as he again tries to &#x27;develop&#x27; Pearl Bay with dubious real estate schemes and reconcile with an increasingly confident and entrepreneurial Heather. His daughter Jules makes an appearance as a mercenary Hong-Kong based lawyer and developer, while Kevin and Phrani reconcile and marry after spending the previous five years apart.

==Filming==

Filming of series 1–3 was based at Barwon Heads, Victoria and St Leonards, Victoria, both locations being on the Bellarine Peninsula. A number of streets in the St Leonards Sea Change Estate have since been named to acknowledge some of the characters of the series. Many scenes were also filmed in Williamstown (a suburb of Melbourne), including the exterior of the Williamstown Life Saving Club, which became the court house of Pearl Bay.

Tours to see the locations where filming took place were popular in 2003.

Series 4 was filmed in Brunswick Heads, northern New South Wales, just south of the border with Queensland and 10 km from Byron Bay.

==Recurring themes==
Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot; is a clear influence on &quot;SeaChange&quot;, exemplified by the episode titles &quot;Something Rich and Strange&quot; and &quot;Full Fathom Five&quot;, and by Miranda&#x27;s name, as well as frequent freak weather events.

&quot;SeaChange&quot; was often compared to &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;.

One of the long-running jokes on the show is the town bridge. The easiest connection from Pearl Bay to the rest of the world, it had been destroyed years earlier, and attempts to fix it always seem to go awry.

Another recurring joke involves the character &#x27;Bucket&#x27;. This bizarre individual is an unseen character (except in one episode, in the background, when someone waves to him), but he is regularly mentioned. From various accounts he is missing limbs (but is still able to drive a boat), has no teeth and has never eaten a cereal grain in his life, and tends to get drunk often and steal people&#x27;s ride-on mowers. He often arrives home drunk and would drink from the water bowl of his dog, the late Alfonzo Dominico Jones.

At the end of every episode (except episodes 1 and 12 of series 1, episode 5 of series 2 and the final episode) there is a brief scene in which Kevin and Trevor chat while overlooking the beach at the end of the day. Their conversation usually adds a comical touch to the episode. In episode 5 of series 2, the Kevin and Trevor scene is not at the very end, and takes place at the Alfonzo Dominico Antonio Jones Memorial Pool. Also, in episode 10 of series 3, Kevin&#x27;s sister Suzie joined him to tell him that their recently-deceased father&#x27;s electric guitar (which they had buried) was worth $8,000 because he had played with The Masters Apprentices for a week. In one episode, the Masters Apprentices (or one version of them) played themselves, with credit given to Jim Keays.

<text>Bloemendaal aan Zee is a seaside resort and neighbourhood in the municipality Bloemendaal, in North Holland province, the Netherlands. It is between the beaches of IJmuiden to the north and Zandvoort to the south and surrounded by the dunes of the Zuid-Kennemerland National Park.

Like Zandvoort, it is a popular beach destination. It has a sandy beach, including a nude beach. In summer the roads to Zandvoort and Bloemendaal are busy, but many consider it worthwhile and take the traffic jams for granted.

In June 2007, the Freestyle Frisbee World Championships were held on the beach of Bloemendaal aan Zee.
==Attractions==
* Plenty of beach clubs
* Mobile stands with excellent seafood

<doc id="881309" wikidata="Q7970276" url="?curid=881309" title="Warren House Inn">
<text>The Warren House Inn is a remote and isolated public house in the heart of Dartmoor, Devon, England. It is the highest pub in southern England at 1,425 feet (434 m) above sea level. It is located on an ancient road across the moor, about 2 miles (3 km) north east of the village of Postbridge and has been a stopping point for travellers since the middle of the 18th century.

==History==
In 1905 Robert Burnard wrote: &quot;When packhorses were used on the Moreton track, New House, or as it is now called, Warren House Inn, was on the right side of the road proceeding from Postbridge towards Moreton, and it is so shown on Donne&#x27;s map. This old building was burnt down some years ago and was rebuilt in 1845 by J. Wills on the other side of the present road, here it occupies the site of the ancient packhorse way.&quot;

As Burnard said, the current building dates from 1845, but the original inn on the southern side of the packhorse track was probably built in the middle of the 18th century, certainly well before the turnpike road was created in 1792. There must have been sufficient packhorse and foot traffic because some time afterwards a small rabbit warren was established nearby to allow the inn to serve rabbit-pie with scrumpy. The earliest landlord recorded is William Tapper, in 1786.

The newly rebuilt inn was first named The Moreton Inn and in 1850 it was owned by William Honey of Tavistock and the host was William Warne. Not long after, Jonas Coaker, the self-styled Dartmoor Poet who was born in Postbridge in 1801, became landlord and it was probably he who renamed the inn. In his day the inn was frequented by miners from the nearby Vitifer and Golden Dagger tin mines. Coaker later recounted two incidents that took place while he was landlord: in one he had to take to the moor when a crowd of miners helped themselves to his liquor; and on another occasion two miners got into a fight with a fatal result for one of them, but the survivor was let off with three weeks&#x27; imprisonment mostly on Coaker&#x27;s evidence because he was able to show gross provocation.

==Folklore==

The Inn is the subject of much folklore, probably exaggerated over the generations. For example, one traveller is said to have stayed there overnight and found a body in a chest in his room. When he mentioned this to the landlord, he was told: &quot;&#x27;tis only fayther! … the snaw being so thick, and making the roads so cledgey-like, when old fayther died, two weeks agon, we couldn&#x27;t carry un to Tavistock to bury un; and so mother put un in the old box, and salted un in…&quot;

Another relates to a visitor who was persuaded to buy a flock of sheep, after consuming copious quantities of cider. The following morning he discovered that the &quot;flock&quot; that he had been shown by the locals that night was actually the prehistoric stone circles of Grey Wethers.

The fire in the hearth, it is rumoured, has never been allowed to go out and has itself become part of the folklore of the inn. It is said that when the inn was rebuilt, the glowing embers of the fire were carried across the road on a shovel to the new hearth.

<doc id="881310" wikidata="Q3027523" url="?curid=881310" title="Russell M. Nelson">
<text>Russell Marion Nelson Sr. (born September 9, 1924) is an American religious leader and retired surgeon who is the 17th and current president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Nelson was a member of the LDS Church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for nearly 34 years, and was the quorum president from 2015 to 2018. As church president, Nelson is recognized by the church as a prophet, seer, and revelator.

A native of Salt Lake City, Utah, Nelson attended the University of Utah for his undergraduate and medical school education. He earned a bachelor of arts in basic biological sciences with high honors in 1945, and a doctor of medicine degree in 1947, at age 22. He then did his medical residency and earned a Ph.D. at the University of Minnesota, where he was a member of the research team developing the heart-lung machine that in 1951 supported the first human open-heart surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. After serving in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during the Korean War, Nelson returned to Salt Lake City and accepted a professorship at the University of Utah School of Medicine. He spent the next 29 years working in the field of cardiothoracic surgery. Nelson became a noted heart surgeon and served as president of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the Utah Medical Association.

Nelson served in a variety of lay LDS Church leadership positions during his surgical career, beginning locally in Salt Lake City and then as the LDS Church&#x27;s Sunday School General President from 1971 to 1979. In 1984, Nelson and jurist Dallin H. Oaks were selected to fill two vacancies in the LDS Church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. 

==Early life and education==
Nelson was born on September 9, 1924, in Salt Lake City, Utah, to Floss Edna (&quot;née&quot; Anderson; 1893–1983) and Marion Clavar Nelson (1897–1990). He had two sisters, Marjory E. (1920–2016) and Enid (1926–2019), and a brother, Robert H. (1931–2014). Nelson&#x27;s father was a reporter for the &quot;Deseret News&quot; and later became general manager of Gillham Advertising, Utah&#x27;s earliest advertising agency. His parents were not active in the Latter-day Saint faith while he was a youth, but they did send him to Sunday School, and he was baptized a member of the LDS Church at age 16.

Nelson studied at LDS Business College in his mid-teens (concurrently with high school enrollment) and worked as an assistant secretary at a bank. He graduated from high school at age 16 and enrolled at the University of Utah, where he was a member of the Beta Epsilon chapter of Sigma Chi and Owl and Key. He graduated in 1945 with a Bachelor of Arts and Phi Beta Kappa membership. He then attended the University of Utah School of Medicine, graduating with a Doctor of Medicine degree in 1947 ranked first in his class. Nelson began his first year of medical school while still an undergraduate, and he completed the four-year M.D. program in only three years.

After medical school, Nelson went to the University of Minnesota for his medical residency. He became a member of surgeon Clarence Dennis&#x27;s research team developing the heart-lung machine that in April 1951 supported the first human open-heart surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. Nelson received a Ph.D. from Minnesota in 1954 for his research contributions.

==Medical career==
Nelson served a two-year term of duty in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during the Korean War, and was stationed at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. While on duty, he was assigned to a research group formed by the commandant of the graduate school at Walter Reed, Col. William S. Stone and led by Fiorindo A. Simeone, a professor of surgery at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland who had been a clinical investigator in the Mediterranean Theater during World War II. This team was focused on ways to improve the treatment of the wounded, and was sent to all five MASH units active in Korea along with two major evacuation hospitals, several field station hospitals, a prisoner of war camp and larger evacuation hospitals in Japan, Hawaii, and the mainland United States in order to implement such improvements. At one point, the team came close enough to the front that they received fire from enemy artillery positions, which missed them. After 20 months in service, he left active duty at the rank of captain. Following his military service, he did a year of work and surgical training at Massachusetts General Hospital.

In 1955, Nelson returned to Salt Lake City and accepted a faculty position at the University of Utah School of Medicine. There he built his own heart-lung bypass machine and employed it to support the first open-heart surgery in the United States west of the Mississippi River. That operation was performed at the Salt Lake General Hospital (SLGH, now University of Utah Hospital) on an adult with an atrial septal defect. Nelson was the third surgeon in the United States to perform an open-heart operation successfully. Nelson was also the director of the University of Utah thoracic surgery residency program.

In March 1956, he performed the first successful pediatric cardiac operation at the SLGH, a total repair of tetralogy of Fallot in a four-year-old girl. He was at the forefront of surgeons focusing attention on coronary artery disease, and contributed to the advance of valvular surgery as well. In 1960, he performed one of the first-ever repairs of tricuspid valve regurgitation. His patient was a Latter-day Saint stake patriarch. He also provided the first surgical intervention for tricuspid regurgitation, a disorder that allows blood to flow backward into the right upper heart chamber. In an indication of his surgical skill, a 1968 case series of his aortic valve replacements demonstrated an exceptionally low peri-operative mortality. Later, he performed the same operation on future LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball, replacing his damaged aortic valve. In 1985, Nelson along with his colleague, Conrad B. Jenson, performed a quadruple bypass surgery on the Chinese opera performer (1925–1989).

Nelson first operated out of the University of Utah&#x27;s medical school. He later had a practice at the Salt Lake Clinic with admission privileges at LDS Hospital. In 1964, he set up his own private practice with him as the lead and Conrad Jenson as an associate. In 1966, Nelson became head of the thoracic residency program that combined resources from the University of Utah Medical School, LDS Hospital, Primary Children&#x27;s Hospital and the VA Hospital in Salt Lake City.

In 1965, the University of Chicago offered Nelson the position as head of their department of thoracic surgery. Dallin H. Oaks, then a law professor at Chicago and a fellow Latter-day Saint, actively worked to recruit Nelson. However, after consulting with David O. McKay, Nelson turned down the offer.

Nelson became involved with the administrative aspects of medicine and was elected president of the Utah State Medical Association. He was chair of the Division of Thoracic Surgery at LDS Hospital.

In 1981, Nelson held appointments as a visiting professor of surgery at the National Institute of Cardiology in Mexico City and the Catholic University in Santiago, Chile. In May 1982 he was a visiting professor at the Hospital de Clinicas in Montevideo, Uruguay.

Nelson was honored nationally by being elected president of the Society for Vascular Surgery for the year 1975. He was also a director of the American Board of Thoracic Surgery. Nelson traveled extensively as a medical doctor and addressed conferences in many parts of Latin America and Africa, as well as in India and China. He performed a total of nearly 7,000 operations before his call to be an apostle.

In 2015, the University of Utah, along with the American College of Cardiology, created the Russell M. Nelson MD, PhD Visiting Professorship in Cardiothoracic Surgery.

==LDS Church service==
In addition to his medical work, Nelson served frequently as a leader in the LDS Church. In Minnesota, he served as what was then known as Sunday School Superintendent in his local congregation. In Washington DC, he was a counselor in the bishopric of the ward that Ezra Taft Benson (then an apostle) regularly attended while serving as Secretary of Agriculture to Dwight D. Eisenhower. In Massachusetts, Nelson was the secretary for the adult Aaronic priesthood organization in his Boston-area branch.

After returning to Salt Lake City, he was called as priest quorum advisor in the Garden Park Ward, working with over 50 boys ages 16 to 18. He next served as member of the Bonneville Stake YMMIA superintendency (a position that is roughly equivalent to a modern counselor in the stake young men&#x27;s presidency) and then as a counselor in the bishopric of the Garden Park Ward. He was set apart as a counselor in the bishopric by Joseph Fielding Smith, whose son-in-law was the bishop. Nelson served in that bishopric for over five years at a time when the ward had over 1,000 members. He then moved to the Yale Second Ward, still in the Bonneville Stake, and was called as a member of the stake high council. He later served as a stake president in Salt Lake City from 1964 to 1971, with fellow future apostle Joseph B. Wirthlin serving as his second counselor. From 1955 to 1965, Nelson served as a missionary on Temple Square every Thursday afternoon for about two hours giving tours to visitors. The call to serve in this position had been extended to Nelson by Richard L. Evans, an apostle and the lead figure over publicity efforts on Temple Square.

Nelson also served for eight years as the church&#x27;s Sunday School General President. During his tenure the Sunday School developed a unified 8-year-cycle of covering the LDS Church&#x27;s scriptures in its curriculum. There was also a shift from having members of the Sunday School general board do all the training for new teachers to providing materials which developed into the book &quot;Teaching: No Greater Call&quot;. The hymn practice time in Sunday School was also renamed to worship through music.

Nelson later served for four and a half years as a regional representative. For approximately half of this time, he was assigned to oversee the fourteen stakes at BYU, while he worked with the stakes in Kearns, Utah, for the rest of his tenure.

===Apostle===
Nelson was called as an apostle by church president Spencer W. Kimball, whom he had served as a personal physician for many years. Nelson was sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on April 7, 1984, during the church&#x27;s general conference. He was ordained an apostle on April 12, 1984, by Gordon B. Hinckley. At the same conference, Dallin H. Oaks was sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. Nelson and Oaks filled the vacancies in the Quorum created by the deaths of LeGrand Richards and Mark E. Petersen. Early in his service as an apostle, Nelson was an adviser to the church&#x27;s Young Women organization and was supportive of the developing of the Young Women values and Personal Progress program.

In 1991, Nelson served as the negotiator for the LDS Church with the Internal Revenue Service over whether contributions to support missionaries serving would be tax deductible. In 1992, he served on the Strengthening Church Members Committee, alongside fellow apostle James E. Faust. In 1993, he was the church&#x27;s lead delegate to the Parliament on World Religions. For a time he was also the church&#x27;s representative to a US State Department committee on international religious freedom.

Nelson&#x27;s assignments as an apostle have included supervisory responsibility for the LDS Church in Africa. In 2009, he, along with his wife and others, were attacked while in Mozambique. He also made several other visits to that continent, including one to Kenya in 2011.

From 2007 to 2015, Nelson was a member of the Church Boards of Trustees/Education, the governing body of the Church Educational System, and the chairman of its executive committee. He was succeeded as chairman of the executive committee by Oaks.

Following the death of Boyd K. Packer on July 3, 2015, Nelson became the most senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve and the quorum&#x27;s president. Nelson was set apart as the quorum president on July 15, 2015, by Thomas S. Monson.

Nelson made his first international trip as quorum president to Central America from August 20–31, 2015. The following month, Nelson dedicated the renovated Aaronic Priesthood Restoration Site in Pennsylvania, where LDS Church members believe the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods were restored.

In 2016, as president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Nelson declared that the church&#x27;s governing council had received a revelation from God requiring First Presidency approval before the baptism of minor children that lived with same-sex parents. &quot;It was our privilege as apostles to sustain what had been revealed to President Monson,&quot; Nelson said. Citing &quot;continuing revelation&quot; and a changing global context, this policy was adjusted in 2019, such that First Presidency approval was no longer required for the children to be baptized.

==== Eastern Europe ====
After Monson&#x27;s call to the First Presidency in 1985, Nelson was assigned as the apostle to oversee the work of the church in Eastern Europe. In this assignment, he worked closely with Dennis B. Neuenschwander and Hans B. Ringger. Nelson was involved in the first meetings between LDS Church leaders and government officials of Bulgaria, Romania, and the Soviet Union, and worked to continue LDS expansion and recognition efforts in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland.

In August 2010, Nelson journeyed to the dedication of the Kyiv Ukraine Temple. Afterwards, in September, he traveled to church meetings in several European countries. He pronounced blessings upon Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo while visiting each of those countries; these serve as addendums to Monson&#x27;s 1985 dedication of Yugoslavia for the preaching of the gospel.

Nelson&#x27;s only son, Russell M. Nelson Jr., served as an LDS missionary in Russia. In 2011, Nelson Sr. returned to Russia to organize the first church stake in that country, headquartered in Moscow.

==== Central Asia ====
In August 2003, Nelson became the first member of the Quorum of the Twelve to visit Kazakhstan. While there, Nelson visited government officials, was interviewed by Yuzhnaya Stalitsa television, and dedicated that country for the preaching of the gospel.

==== China ====
When he was Sunday School General President, Nelson attended a meeting where Kimball urged those present to learn Chinese. Nelson took up this challenge and developed elementary proficiency in Mandarin. He developed ties with the medical community in China and made several trips there to train surgeons. In 1985, Nelson was the first person to be made an honorary professor of Shandong Medical College. In 1995, Nelson went to Beijing, along with Neal A. Maxwell and other LDS Church leaders, on an official invitation of Li Lanqing, the Vice Premier of China.

=== President of the Church ===

With the death of Monson on January 2, 2018, Nelson became the anticipated successor to the church&#x27;s presidency. Nelson signed 1,150 mission calls as the presiding apostle. After being ordained and set apart as church president on January 14, 2018, Nelson was introduced to church members and the media two days later, along with Oaks as his First Counselor and Henry B. Eyring as Second Counselor. Nelson chose not to retain Dieter F. Uchtdorf, who had served as Monson&#x27;s Second Counselor, in the new First Presidency. This marked the first time since 1985 that a new church president had not retained a previously-serving counselor.

On April 14, 2022, Nelson surpassed Gordon B. Hinckley to become the oldest president in the history of the church. On August 8, 2022, Nelson became the church&#x27;s oldest apostle ever, surpassing David B. Haight.

Nelson turned 100 on September 9, 2024. The LDS Church commemorated his birthday with a globally broadcast livestream showcasing his life and church service.

==== Worldwide ministry ====
Since becoming church president, Nelson has visited members of the LDS Church in various areas of the world. Up through August 2019, he had visited sixteen countries, addressing thousands of members of the faith.

The first trip, called a global ministry tour by the church, occurred in April 2018, when Nelson along with his wife, and Jeffrey R. Holland and his wife, met with Latter-day Saints in London, England; Jerusalem; Nairobi, Kenya; Harare, Zimbabwe; Bengaluru, India; Bangkok, Thailand; Hong Kong; and Laie, Hawaii.

In June 2018, Nelson traveled to Alberta, Canada, where his second wife was born and raised, and gave three devotional addresses in three consecutive evenings.

In September 2018, Nelson visited the Dominican Republic, where he gave an entire talk in Spanish, which was believed to be the first time a church president had given an extended talk in a formal setting in a language other than English. On the same trip, he visited Puerto Rico.

On February 10, 2019, Nelson spoke to church members in Arizona at State Farm Stadium in Glendale. In addition to the large crowd in attendance, the devotional was broadcast across the state.

On March 9, 2019, Nelson met with Pope Francis at the Vatican. The event marked the first time in history that a pope and an LDS Church president met face-to-face. The meeting took place the day before the church&#x27;s Rome Italy Temple was dedicated.

In August 2019, Nelson visited Guatemala, Colombia, Ecuador, Argentina, and Brazil.

==== Organizational and policy changes ====
The first few months of Nelson&#x27;s leadership of the LDS Church saw many significant changes to church policy, although many had at least been heavily discussed before he became church president, and some were continuations of policies instituted by his predecessors. Nelson began his presidency two days after his ordination with a short broadcast to church members in January 2018 before then holding a press conference. This broadcast ahead of the press conference was unprecedented and provided the new leaders an opportunity to briefly address the entire church immediately.

In March 2018, the First Presidency issued a letter on preventing and responding to abuse. This letter reiterated existing policies, but also explicitly stated that no one should ever be counseled against reporting abuse to legal authorities. The guidance also had a clear emphasis on using counseling to assist in healing from abuse. It also provided more clear policies mandating all interviews with women and youth be done with another person in the general area, and made it clear that youth and women could have a parent or other adult present for an interview. It also adjusted previous policies forbidding adult males to teach classes of children or youth alone to apply to all adults.

During the church&#x27;s April general conference, Nelson appointed Asian-American Gerrit W. Gong and Brazilian Ulisses Soares to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, both of whom had been serving in the Presidency of the Seventy.

Nelson also introduced major changes in church organization during the April general conference. First, the high priests groups at the ward level were dissolved, making all Melchizedek priesthood holders in wards and branches part of the elders quorum. A stake&#x27;s high priest quorum now consists of current members of stake presidencies, high councils, bishoprics and functioning patriarchs. Next, Nelson ended home teaching and visiting teaching, replacing the programs with a focus on ministering, and shifting both the focus and methods of tracking them. As part of this change, young women ages 14–18 may be assigned as ministering sisters, similar to the-long standing policies of young men ages 14–18 serving as home teachers.

June 2018 began with a First Presidency-sponsored celebration of the 40th anniversary of the revelation extending priesthood and temple blessings to all worthy members without regard to race, in which Nelson gave concluding remarks. A few days before this, Nelson and his counselors met with the national leaders of the NAACP. That same weekend Nelson gave a devotional to LDS youth in which he urged them to more fully commit to the church. He encouraged them to collectively choose a period of seven days in which to abstain from the use of social media. On June 18, the First Presidency created committees assigned to form a unified hymnbook and children&#x27;s songbook for the worldwide church membership, with each language edition having the same hymns (and other songs) in the same order, and that these committees would be taking submissions and collecting surveys until July 2019. It is anticipated that the process of creating the new unified hymnbook and children&#x27;s songbook will take several years.

In August 2018, Nelson issued a statement urging the use of the church&#x27;s full name. At the church&#x27;s general conference in October 2018, he reiterated his position, declaring, &quot;It is a correction&quot; and &quot;It is the command of the Lord.&quot; Nelson told members, &quot;To remove the Lord’s name from the Lord’s Church is a major victory for Satan.&quot;

In the October 2018 general conference, Nelson shortened the length of Sunday church meetings to 2 hours, from the previous standard of 3. At the end of the month, Nelson toured five South American countries, during which he met with Peru&#x27;s president, Martín Vizcarra, gave a major address in Peru in Spanish, and dedicated the Concepción Chile Temple.

In December 2018, the church&#x27;s First Presidency changed the process of youth class progression and priesthood ordination. Beginning in 2019, youth began moving between classes and priesthood quorums at the beginning of the year in which they turn 12, 14, or 16, rather than when their birthday occurs during the year.

In April 2019, the church&#x27;s First Presidency published a revelation reversing a controversial November 2015 policy that classified same-sex marriage couples as apostates and required parental and First Presidency approval before minor children of same-sex marriages could be baptized or receive baby blessings. Nelson had previously characterized the 2015 policy as direction from God, stating &quot;Each of us during that sacred moment felt a spiritual confirmation. ... It was our privilege as apostles to sustain what had been revealed to President Monson.&quot; Shortly after the change, Nelson said in a press release that the reversal was, &quot;revelation upon revelation&quot; and intended to &quot;help affected families&quot; and &quot;reduce the hate and contention so common today.&quot;

On April 5, 2020, Nelson issued a new proclamation, &quot;The Restoration of the Fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ: A Bicentennial Proclamation to the World&quot;. The proclamation coincided with the 200th anniversary of Joseph Smith&#x27;s First Vision and is the sixth proclamation issued by the church in its history.

Nelson&#x27;s tenure as church president has had an increased focus on worship in the church&#x27;s temples. As of October 2024, Nelson has announced a total of 185 new temples to be built in many countries around the world. His travels have included several temple dedications, most notably the Rome Italy Temple in March 2019, which was attended by all current members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

In 2018, Nelson announced 19 new temples, seven in April and 12 in October, among which were the first in India, Nicaragua, Russia, and Cambodia. During his April 2018 visit to India, Nelson stated to church members that the Lord had instructed him to announce the temple the night before general conference, though he had not originally planned to do so. With the temple in Nicaragua, Nelson fulfilled an apostolic promise he had made to church members there six years earlier.

In October 2018, Nelson concluded a 10-day trip to South America by dedicating the Concepcion Chile Temple. Following the December 2018 dedication of the Barranquilla Colombia Temple by Dallin H. Oaks, Nelson presided over the three-day dedicatory services for the Rome Italy Temple from March 10 to 12, 2019. Nelson took all the church&#x27;s apostles with him to Rome for that dedication. This was the first time all ordained apostles of the church had been gathered in one location outside the United States. While in Rome, the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles took the first apostolic group photo in two decades.

In April 2020, Nelson announced plans to build a temple in Shanghai, China. Days later, the Shanghai Municipal Ethnic and Religious Affairs Bureau responded saying it &quot;knew nothing about the American Mormon Church . . . building a so-called &#x27;temple&#x27; in Shanghai.&quot; The Bureau added that the church&#x27;s plans were &quot;wishful thinking, not based in reality.&quot;

==Marriages and children==
While a student at the University of Utah, Nelson met and began dating fellow Utah student Dantzel White (1926–2005). They dated for three years, then married on August 31, 1945, in the Salt Lake Temple. Together they had ten children: nine daughtersMarsha, Wendy (1951–2019), Gloria, Brenda, Sylvia, Emily (1958–1995), Laurie, Rosalie, and Marjorieand a son, Russell Jr. (b. 1972). Dantzel White was a native of Perry, Utah, and first met Nelson when they were the co-leads in a musical produced at the University of Utah. During the 1950s, Dantzel was a member of the Tabernacle Choir.

Dantzel Nelson died unexpectedly at their home in Salt Lake City on February 12, 2005, at age 78. The following year, Nelson married Wendy L. Watson (b. 1950) in the Salt Lake Temple on April 6, 2006. Watson, originally from Raymond, Alberta, was a professor of marriage and family therapy at BYU prior to her retirement in 2006. Her marriage to Nelson is her first.

<doc id="881311" wikidata="Q1961815" url="?curid=881311" title="Aperture synthesis">
<text>Aperture synthesis or synthesis imaging is a type of interferometry that mixes signals from a collection of telescopes to produce images having the same angular resolution as an instrument the size of the entire collection. At each separation and orientation, the lobe-pattern of the interferometer produces an output which is one component of the Fourier transform of the spatial distribution of the brightness of the observed object. The image (or &quot;map&quot;) of the source is produced from these measurements. Astronomical interferometers are commonly used for high-resolution optical, infrared, submillimetre and radio astronomy observations. For example, the Event Horizon Telescope project derived the first image of a black hole using aperture synthesis.

== Technical issues ==
Aperture synthesis is possible only if both the amplitude and the phase of the incoming signal are measured by each telescope. For radio frequencies, this is possible by electronics, while for optical frequencies, the electromagnetic field cannot be measured directly and correlated in software, but must be propagated by sensitive optics and interfered optically. Accurate optical delay and atmospheric wavefront aberration correction are required, a very demanding technology that became possible only in the 1990s. This is why imaging with aperture synthesis has been used successfully in radio astronomy since the 1950s and in optical/infrared astronomy only since the turn of the millennium. See astronomical interferometer for more information.

In order to produce a high quality image, a large number of different separations between different telescopes is required (the projected separation between any two telescopes as seen from the radio source is called a baseline) – as many different baselines as possible are required in order to get a good quality image. The number of baselines (&quot;n&quot;b) for an array of &quot;n&quot; telescopes is given by &quot;n&quot;b=(&quot;n&quot;2 − &quot;n&quot;)/2. (This is formula_1 or &quot;n&quot;C2). For example, the Very Large Array has 27 telescopes giving 351 independent baselines at once, and can give high quality images.

In contrast to radio arrays, the largest optical arrays currently have only 6 telescopes, giving poorer image quality from the 15 baselines between the telescopes.

Most radio frequency aperture synthesis interferometers use the rotation of the Earth to increase the number of different baselines included in an observation (see diagram on right). Taking data at different times provides measurements with different telescope separations and angles without the need for additional telescopes or moving the telescopes manually, as the rotation of the Earth moves the telescopes to new baselines.

The use of Earth rotation was discussed in detail in the 1950 paper &quot;A preliminary survey of the radio stars in the Northern Hemisphere&quot;. Some instruments use artificial rotation of the interferometer array instead of Earth rotation, such as in aperture masking interferometry.

== History ==
The concept of aperture synthesis was first formulated in 1946 by Australian radio astronomers Ruby Payne-Scott and Joseph Pawsey. Working from Dover Heights in Sydney, Payne-Scott carried out the earliest interferometer observations in radio astronomy on 26 January 1946 using an Australian Army radar as a radio telescope.

Aperture synthesis imaging was later developed at radio wavelengths by Martin Ryle and coworkers from the Radio Astronomy Group at Cambridge University. Martin Ryle and Tony Hewish jointly received a Nobel Prize for this and other contributions to the development of radio interferometry.

The radio astronomy group in Cambridge went on to found the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory near Cambridge in the 1950s. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, as computers (such as the Titan) became capable of handling the computationally intensive Fourier transform inversions required, they used aperture synthesis to create a &#x27;One-Mile&#x27; and later a &#x27;5 km&#x27; effective aperture using the One-Mile and Ryle telescopes, respectively.

The technique was subsequently further developed in very-long-baseline interferometry to obtain baselines of thousands of kilometers and even in optical telescopes. The term &quot;aperture synthesis&quot; can also refer to a type of radar system known as synthetic aperture radar, but this is technically unrelated to the radio astronomy method and developed independently.

Originally it was thought necessary to make measurements at essentially every baseline length and orientation out to some maximum: such a fully sampled Fourier transform formally contains the information exactly equivalent to the image from a conventional telescope with an aperture diameter equal to the maximum baseline, hence the name &quot;aperture synthesis&quot;.

It was rapidly discovered that in many cases, useful images could be made with a relatively sparse and irregular set of baselines, especially with the help of non-linear deconvolution algorithms such as the maximum entropy method. The alternative name &quot;synthesis imaging&quot; acknowledges the shift in emphasis from trying to synthesize the complete aperture (allowing image reconstruction by Fourier transform) to trying to synthesize the image from whatever data is available, using powerful but computationally expensive algorithms.

Note that aperture synthesis is technically and historically independent of synthetic aperture radar, which is a Doppler technique, originally developed in the early 1950s by Carl A. Wiley. The operating principles are unrelated.

<doc id="881312" wikidata="Q2982516" url="?curid=881312" title="Famiclone">
<text>In video game parlance, a famiclone is a hardware clone of the Family Computer/Nintendo Entertainment System. They are designed to replicate the workings of, and play games designed for, the Famicom and NES. Hundreds of unauthorized clones and unlicensed game copies have been made available since the height of the NES popularity in the late 1980s. The technology employed in such clones has evolved over the years: while the earliest clones feature a printed circuit board containing custom or third party integrated circuits (ICs), more recent (post-1996) clones utilize single-chip designs, with a custom ASIC which simulates the functionality of the original hardware, and often includes one or more on-board games. Most devices originate in China and Taiwan, and less commonly South Korea. Outside China and Taiwan, they are mostly widespread across emerging markets of developing countries.

In some locales, such as former Eastern Bloc, former Soviet countries (especially Russia), South America, Middle East, several Asian countries and Africa such systems could occasionally be found side by side with official Nintendo hardware, but clones were cheaper and had wider availability of software so such clones were the easiest available console gaming systems. Elsewhere, these systems often prompted swift legal action. Many of these early systems were similar to the NES or Famicom not only in functionality, but also in appearance, often featuring little more than a new name and logo in place of Nintendo&#x27;s branding. In contrast, in the former Yugoslavia NES clones often visually resembled the Mega Drive, complete with the Sega logo.

Few of these systems were openly marketed as &quot;NES compatible&quot;. Some of the packaging features screenshots from more recent and more powerful systems, which are adorned with misleading, or even outright false, quotes such as &quot;ultimate videogame technlology&quot; or &quot;crystal clear digital sound, multiple colors and advanced 3D graphics&quot;. Some manufacturers opt for a less misleading approach, describing the system generically as a &quot;TV game&quot;, &quot;8-bit console&quot;, &quot;multi-game system&quot;, or &quot;Plug &amp; Play&quot;, but even these examples generally say nothing to suggest any compatibility with NES hardware. They would often be distributed along pirate multicarts.

==Types==
Because NES clones are not officially licensed, they vary in areas such as hardware quality, available games and overall performance. Most clones are produced extremely cheaply, while a few are comparable to first-party hardware in their manufacture quality. In terms of appearance and basic build, there are four general types of clones:

===Console type===
Many clones are designed to resemble the original Famicom, but others have been produced to look like almost all other consoles from the NES, SNES, and Mega Drive/Genesis to the Xbox and PlayStation 3, and others simply in a generic console shape. Usually, it is easy to tell a famiclone from the real hardware it imitates by the presence of either alternate coloring, brand names that do not match the real console&#x27;s, or weak construction. Console-type clones almost always utilize cartridges, and they are usually compatible with real Famicom (60-pin) or NES (72-pin) games, as well as custom-made carts (especially multi-carts, unauthorized game cartridges which hold a multitude of games as opposed to just one, which are often included with console-type clones). Console famiclones are most popular in Asia, parts of Europe and Latin America, with few actively sold in North America due to stronger enforcement of the copyrights in the games typically packaged with a famiclone and of the design patents in the imitated consoles.

===Multi-console type===

Consoles such as the Retron 3 include multiple consoles in one clone.

===Handheld type===

These types of systems contain a built-in LCD screen and are usually powered by batteries, therefore acting as a completely portable handheld system.

One of the first handheld clones is the &quot;Top Guy&quot;, although only a small number are known to exist. More widely distributed was Redant&#x27;s Game Axe, which was manufactured in several revisions through the 1990s. Game Theory Admiral featured an improved TFT screen and closely resembled the Game Boy Advance or Wintech GOOD BOY - not to be confused with a Famicom clone also called Good Boy - designed to look like a Game Boy Color. However, this smaller design included a smaller cartridge port; it was supplied with an adapter to allow the use of standard Famicom cartridges with the system. One of the more recent handheld clones is Gametech&#x27;s PocketFami, the first to be actively marketed as a portable Famicom by its manufacturers, and one of the most widely distributed thanks to the new legitimate status of Famicom clone products.

There are also a number of famiclones in the shape of a Game Boy or similar, but which can only display NES/Famicom games on a TV, and have a simple LCD game in the screen area. such an example is the NES Clone &quot;GameKids Advance&quot;, which resembles an older Game Boy Advance, and has a built-in LCD game, powered by 2 AA batteries, or the included AC adapter. However, the NES games can only be played on TV using the AC adapter. It uses a game cartridge, similar to those from a Game Boy/Game Boy Color, and also includes an adapter to play NES games.

====PocketFami====
The &quot;Pocket Fami&quot;, also known as &quot;Pocket Famicom&quot; (although this name was never used by the manufacturers as Famicom is a trademark of Nintendo) and &quot;Pokefami&quot; (ポケファミ) is an unlicensed handheld hardware clone of the Famicom produced by GameTech and released in 2004.

The PocketFami features a standard D-pad and six buttons: the four standard NES buttons (A, B, select, and start), plus two additional &quot;turbo&quot; buttons. It features a 2.5 inch backlit LCD screen capable of displaying both NTSC and PAL video. It has one headphone jack, an RCA composite output jack, and can be powered either through 3 AA batteries or AC adapter. Because of the different cartridge pin design of the Japanese Famicom (60 pins) and the international NES (72 pins), international (North American, Australian, European) cartridges cannot be played without an additional converter.

Nintendo sued GameTech over production of the PocketFami, claiming that the device violated their patents on the Famicom&#x27;s hardware. The courts found in favor of GameTech and allowed the device to be sold in Japan, as the original Famicom was first sold in 1983 and most of Nintendo&#x27;s essential patents on the system had expired.

===Controller type===
This type of hardware clone, popular in North America and western Europe, is designed to hold all the console&#x27;s hardware in the shape of a regular game console controller, usually the Nintendo 64&#x27;s. Also known as &quot;NES-on-a-chip&quot; due to their extremely miniaturized hardware (relative to the original NES), these controllers usually shun or at least downplay a game cartridge interface in favor of storing games directly in internal memory chips. These famiclones can often run on battery as well as AC power, making them popular for portable usage. These clones have become especially popular in the USA thanks to the new &quot;TV-Games&quot; fad of selling legitimately emulated classic arcade games in a traditional-looking controller. (Atari games are especially common.) Controller clones can usually be found in places like flea markets, mall kiosks, or independent toy stores, and most people who sell and buy them are unaware or do not care that they are in fact illegally made. In Brazil this type of console is commercialized with the name &quot;GunBoy&quot;.

The &quot;Power Player Super Joy III&quot; consoles (also known as &quot;Power Games&quot; and &quot;XA-76-1E&quot;) are a line of unauthorized handheld Nintendo Entertainment System/Famicom clones manufactured by NRTRADE that are sold in North America, Brazil, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The system resembles a Nintendo 64 controller and attaches to a TV set. The second controller resembles a Sega Genesis controller, and a light gun is also included. NTSC, PAL and SECAM versions are available. They all use a custom &quot;NES-on-a-chip&quot; (NOAC) that is an implementation of the NES&#x27;s hardware (Custom 6502, PPU, PAPU, etc.). The consoles came with 76 built-in games, although marketing frequently claims to have 1,000+ ways of playing them. Most of the included games were originally released for the NES or Famicom, but some have been created by the manufacturer to expand their list of included games. Most of the games have had their title screen graphics removed to save space on the ROM chip, not to mention a company logo removal trick for reduced liability. After this product gained some popularity, the Power Player 3.5, an improved model with more games, was released. A wireless version of Power Games was also released.

&quot;Playervision&quot; or &quot;Game Stick&quot; is another unauthorized Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clone built into a gamepad and sold in South America, and is just one version of Power Player Super Joy III, nevertheless, the name of the product varies on and in the box, user manual and the gamepad video game console itself. For example, the instruction sheet calls it &quot;Playervision&quot;, but the system itself says &quot;Players&quot;. This video game console has no cartridge slot, or an input for a second player controller or Zapper. This means that some of the games included can&#x27;t be used because of the need of a gun (&quot;Duck Hunt&quot;, for example). The system includes the same 76 games as Power Player Super Joy III, but some of them are repeated or are graphical hacks (Teletubbies, for example, is just &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; with graphic changes).

===Computer type===

These famiclones are designed to resemble either 1980s home computers, modern keyboards, or the real Famicom&#x27;s BASIC kit. Usually, these clones consist of the same hardware as the console type, but put inside a keyboard instead of a console lookalike. They are usually supplied with a cartridge containing some computer-style software, such as a simple word processor and a version of BASIC (most common are G-BASIC, a counterfeit version of Family BASIC, and F-BASIC, an original but more limited version), and some &quot;educational&quot; typing and mathematics games. Some even include a computer mouse and a GUI-style interface. Note that, while the interface is similar to Nintendo&#x27;s Family BASIC keyboard, clone keyboards are generally not fully compatible with official software (and vice versa) due to differing key layouts.

==Software game titles==
Since none of these unlicensed clones contain the 10NES authentication chip, most are capable of running games that an official NES model would not run. In addition, many modern NES clones come with a built-in selection of games, typically stored on an internal ROM which can range from 128 KB up to several megabytes in size.

These built-in games are usually designed to complement, rather than replace, the traditional cartridge slot, although some devices omit such a slot entirely, allowing only the built-in games to be played. Typical numbers for the built-in &quot;distinct&quot; games range from as low as three to as high as fifty or one hundred games for more expensive products. The number of &quot;distinct games&quot; is important, because while many NES clones claim to have thousands of built-in games, most of these games are usually nothing more than hacks that allow the player to start the same game at different levels or with different numbers of lives.

The games are usually direct unlicensed copies of official NES and Famicom game titles, usually with copyright information removed and sometimes featuring other minor changes. The most commonly found games in NES clones are generally games below 64 K of ROM size and which can be easily split into distinct subgames or levels. As such, &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; and &quot;Circus Charlie&quot; are present in a large percentage of NES clones, usually blown up to count as 6 or 7 &quot;distinct&quot; games each. &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; (often with its clay shooting mode shown as a separate game) is also a common NES clone feature as they justify the existence of the light gun accessory. Other popular, although less common choices, are &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; hacks, &quot;Excitebike&quot;, &quot;Tetris&quot;, &quot;Magic Jewelry&quot; (an unlicensed clone of Columns), older sports titles and miscellaneous platform games. Additionally, some clones incorporate games that, although they may initially appear to be original, are in fact counterfeit copies featuring extensive graphical (and sometimes audio) modifications. Examples of this include &quot;UFO Race&quot;, based on Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;F-1 Race&quot;, &quot;Pandamar&quot; (also known as simply &quot;Panda&quot;), based on &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Ladangel&quot;, based on Hudson Soft&#x27;s &quot;Challenger&quot; and &quot;UFO Shoot&quot;, based on &quot;Duck Hunt&quot;.

However, some systems include legally licensed games; for example, the Rumble Station&#x27;s 15 built-in games are licensed from Color Dreams, and Sachen&#x27;s Q-Boy includes only its own original titles. A growing number of recent clones, such as those marketed by Technologies in the United States, contain large numbers of original games made by developers in China.

==Hardware and software compatibility==

While most famiclones will run most original licensed Nintendo software and work with most original carts (being even more versatile than an original NES because of the lack of regional lockout chips and sometimes having a dual 60-pin and 72-pin cartridge compatibility), the degree of hardware compatibility with original NES accessories and miscellaneous hardware equipment may vary, and even software level compatibility is not always perfect.

The most common software-level incompatibility in the built-in games that some sport, is the lack of save RAM, causing the few games that use it to fail when trying to save or load data.
Since most modern Famiclones are based on the NES-on-a-chip ASIC, they automatically inherit all of its limitations, which includes graphical glitches and compatibility issues.

At a hardware level, the most common incompatibility is the lack, in some famiclones, of the original Famicom&#x27;s expansion port (although it is always present, at least at a logical level, and in some clones it is internally hardwired; e.g. in computer-type famiclones it is hardwired to the built-in keyboard, even if not externally accessible).
Some famiclones also use standard Atari 9-pin shaped or even 15-pin joypad connectors instead of the proprietary NES connectors, and their controllers usually offer all of the functionality of a standard NES controller and sometimes features such as &quot;slow motion&quot; or several autofire keys with different speeds, which are not present on the standard out-of-the-box NES joypads. Despite being physically identical to Atari 9-pin, the protocol is different: Atari uses a parallel protocol where each wire carries the status of a single button, whereas famiclones use the same 4021-based serial protocol the original NES used. Connecting standard controllers to them may result in malfunction or damage of the controller or the famiclone itself.

Lastly, like many modern consoles and other devices meant to be connected to a TV, many modern famiclones lack an RF modulator and instead only have separate audio and composite video outputs (sometimes S-Video), also to cut on the (already low) production costs.

Some manufacturers have added new backward-compatible features to their NOAC ASICs, which allow developers to add new features like an improved processor (a 65C816 compatible), better graphics, stereo sound (by adding another audio unit), PCM audio, and a unified bus (OneBus) which lets manufacturers use a single ROM to store games instead of the two (one for program and other for graphics) the original NES and Famicom used. This hardware was primarily designed by Taiwanese companies V.R. Technology and UMC.

==Post-patent famiclones==

Some of Nintendo&#x27;s patents on the Famicom expired in 2003, followed in 2005 by NES-specific patents such as those covering the 10NES lockout chip. While Nintendo still holds various related trademarks, NES hardware clones are no longer necessarily illegal on the basis of patent infringement. This matter is complicated by the effect of different patents awarded in different countries, with different expiration dates. Nintendo sued Gametech in 2005 for selling the PocketFami, despite the patent expiration. Nintendo lost this suit. However, famiclone manufacturers who incorporate copyrighted games into the unit may still be subject to legal liability on that basis, due to copyrights having much longer terms than patents (in most countries creative works such as games are automatically in copyright for many decades, sometimes up to 95 years after their creation).

While the old-style famiclones continue to be found, the newly legitimized market has seen several clones that openly advertise support for original Famicom or NES games (or sometimes both), a feature not usually publicized by previous clones, which were often marketed as cheap gifts rather than Famicom-compatible systems. Examples of these newer efforts include the Generation NEX, which resembles a flattened version of the original NES and supports both NES and Famicom games, Gametech&#x27;s Neo-Fami (also released in both Famicom and NES compatible versions as the &quot;FC Game Console&quot; by Yobo Gameware), and the handheld PocketFami, a more ambitious, albeit still slightly flawed, successor to the older TopGuy, Game Axe, and Game Theory Admiral. However, these more legitimate clones are still based on the same NES-on-a-chip architecture as the older systems, and as such still suffer from many of the same compatibility problems.

===Generation NEX===

Generation NEX is a Nintendo hardware clone released in 2005. IT is compatible with Japanese Famicom and North American/European NES cartridges. A front-loading slot is used for NES games, like the original console, while a top-loading slot handles Famicom games. Messiah Entertainment Inc., a company based in Los Angeles, announced the Generation NEX in May 2005. The console was shown at the Classic Gaming Expo that August, and was scheduled for release in September 2005. The NEX is a slimmer version of the original NES, measuring an inch and a half in height. The console uses a custom-designed integrated circuit based on NES-on-a-chip, which is used by most Nintendo clone consoles. The NEX is compatible with approximately 95 percent of NES games, excluding games such as &quot;Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot;. The console includes stereo sound capabilities for homebrew games. It uses &quot;VT03&quot; OneBus system-on-a-chip hardware.

The NEX retailed for $59.99, and included one wired controller. Wireless 2.4 GHz controllers were also produced, and were sold in sets of two at a cost of $50 per set. The wired and wireless controllers were redesigned from the original NES controller, having an appearance more similar to the SNES controller. The console includes controller ports that allow the user to plug in and use original NES controllers instead, and the wireless NEX controllers are also compatible with the original NES. The NEX is also compatible with all other NES accessories, such as the Zapper gun. Messiah also produced a wireless arcade stick controller.

The Generation NEX initially received a negative reception from user reviews and some game websites. Complaints were made regarding the console&#x27;s compatibility with NES/Famicom games, which exhibited graphical and audio issues in some cases when played on the NEX. Critics also disliked the soft, squishy buttons on the redesigned controllers. The NEX&#x27;s importer, Lik Sang, canceled its pre-orders in November 2005, following the console&#x27;s poor reception. Reviewers for IGN gave a positive review. They considered the console an improved version of the original NES, while writing that the new counterpart did not present any noticeable graphic issues. Christopher Grant of Engadget was critical of IGN&#x27;s review, noting that it did not address the compatibility issues brought up in other reviews. Grant wrote, &quot;IGN devotes the majority of the review to the pretty packaging, nice design, and wireless controllers, glossing over the compatibility. Don&#x27;t they know: it&#x27;s the games, stupid.&quot;

Shane Hirschman of CraveOnline reviewed the console a year after its release, and he also considered it an improvement over the original NES: &quot;Given the Generation NEX&#x27;s inexpensive price, high-quality, and efficient game play, gamers of all types will be pleased to see the NES is back and better than ever.&quot; Ben Kuchera of &quot;Ars Technica&quot; also reviewed the console a year after its release, and gave a mixed review. Kuchera found few issues involving graphics and audio, but he also considered the console&#x27;s $60 price too high. Kuchera preferred the feel of the original NES controllers, and considered the wireless controllers too expensive as well. Kuchera subsequently wrote that the Generation NEX &quot;muddies the image so badly&quot; that &quot;you&#x27;re doing yourself a disservice by playing the games so compromised.&quot;

=== My Arcade Micro Player ===
Micro Player is a series of famiclone-based miniature arcade cabinets sold by dreamGEAR, a video game accessories company based in Torrance, CA, under the My Arcade brand. Several examples of game cabinets sold under this brand are Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Galaga, and Bubble Bobble.

The cabinets feature artwork from the originals, and utilize licensed NES ports of the games included on them, with Nintendo copyright information removed. The mini arcade cabinets were relatively popular due to their low price. They also released consoles containing these games with a handheld form factor.

DreamGEAR also manufactures several handheld consoles containing multicarts. However, since the consoles are sold in the US, they contain few pirated games, as to avoid legal action. The consoles instead contain various shovelware games by Chinese companies such as Nice Code Software, JungleTac, and Waixing Technology. Several variants contain licensed Data East games.

==Clones by region or country==

===Arabian Peninsula===
The most popular famiclone in the 1990s was &quot;Rinco Home Computer 3600&quot;. In the same time, Nintendo officially distributed its products here but it is unknown if they took legal actions against famiclones sellers.

===Argentina===
The &quot;Family Game&quot; was manufactured by the Argentine company Electrolab. They distributed &quot;Super Family Electrolab Ending-Man&quot; (based on Ending-Man Terminator clone) and &quot;Electrolab Family Game&quot; with official distribution of Supervision. At the peak of its popularity, its sales amounted 95% of the argentinian console market.

According to an interview with Eddy Kiersz, CEO of Electrolab, they paid royalties to Nintendo both to sell the &quot;famiclones&quot; and to import the games, with the condition that they would not export them outside of Argentina. He also mentioned that Nintendo itself put them in contact with the Taiwanese company NTDEC which built the Famicom, to design the &quot;Family Game. This is quite unusual and it&#x27;s very possible that Eddy Kiersz confused Nintendo of America with the American subsidiary of NTDEC, whose full name was Nintendo Electronic Co.

Another popular brand of famiclones were made by Bit Argentina and that is &quot;Bitgame&quot;, &quot;Super Bitgame&quot; and &quot;Video Racer&quot;. In 1992, Nintendo entered the Argentina market with H.Briones Argentina S.A. as representative and Bit Argentina was awarded as official distributor with the rights to still sell famiclones.

Other known consoles are &quot;NTD Family Game&quot; (distributed by NTD Electronica Argentina), &quot;Son Son&quot;, &quot;Froggy Family Game&quot; (distributed by BTE Electronics SA), &quot;Rasti&quot; (distributed by Rasti SA), &quot;Micro Genius&quot;, Family Game and &quot;Goodboy&quot; (distributed by Tec Toy Argentina), &quot;Edu Family Game&quot; (distributed by Videogames EDU S.A) and &quot;Turbo Game&quot; (distributed by La Roque S.A).

===Australia===
Since 1989, Centronics Systems distributed the Spica IQ-701 along with games and multicarts in custom-made boxes. Nintendo sued the distributor and the consoles were withdrawn from further sale.

===Baltic States===
The most known clone in these countries is &quot;Zhiliton&quot; which looks like the Sega Mega Drive model I. Due to the small market of these countries, there are also other clones such as &quot;Dendy&quot;, &quot;UFO&quot;, &quot;Subor&quot;, &quot;Liko&quot;, &quot;Terminator 2&quot; and &quot;Fei Hao&quot;. In 1994, Steepler, Dendy producer, reached an agreement with Nintendo to sell consoles in all post-Soviet states with relinquished its claim to Dendy sales, meaning that Nintendo didn&#x27;t take legal action against famiclones.

===Belarus===
One of the first clones that arrived to Belarus was &quot;Zhiliton&quot;. Later &quot;Dendy&quot; was released, which was the most popular clone in this region. In 1994, Steepler, Dendy producer, reached an agreement with Nintendo to sell consoles in all post-Soviet states with relinquished its claim to Dendy sales, meaning that Nintendo didn&#x27;t take legal action against famiclones.

===Brazil===

Since 1989, Famicom- and NES-compatible consoles were made and sold in Brazil by local companies, some of which also imported and sold original NES cartridges and consoles. The first Famicom-compatible system, called &quot;Dynavision 2&quot;, was released in 1989 by Dynacom and used joysticks similar to the Atari 2600. The next system, &quot;Dynavision 3&quot;, had gamepads similar to Sega Mega Drive gamepads and had a dual slot that allowed both 60-pin and 72-pin cartridges. This was followed in the mid-1990s by &quot;Handyvision&quot;, a portable system that allowed video to be broadcast to the TV with a UHF transmitter. Another company, Geniecom, produced a black-colored clone with headphone jacks on gamepads, and Game Genie code input. The &quot;NASA&quot; clone was similar to the original NES, but had two slots, a 72-pin on the front and a 60-pin on top. Brazilian manufacturers also produced cartridges, but ran into the problem of having two formats. Hydron company solved the issue by making two-sided cartridges - one side 60-pin, the other 72-pin.

In 1993, Nintendo themselves arrived in Brazil and released the NES with the American cartridge slot. This official version was manufactured by Playtronic, a joint venture between the toy company Estrela and Gradiente.

&quot;PolyStation&quot;, another popular clone was distributed from 2000 by Western businessman Ali Ahmad Zaioum, of Paraguayan-Lebanese origin. He also owns around 400 patents and trademarks supposedly created by him. However, he was accused by the Paraguayan court of falsifying documents and information in order to obtain registration with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of Paraguay.

===Colombia===

In Colombia consoles named &quot;Creation&quot;, &quot;Super Creation&quot;, &quot;Nichi-man&quot; (manufactured by Micro Genius) and later on &quot;PolyStation&quot; were popular. Nintendo arrived in Colombia in early 1990s with help of ab compufax.

Also, a recent famiclone, and of the Nintendo Switch, is the &quot;Nanica Smitch&quot;. It has 800 NES games built in, and has removable controllers, but the controllers look like Joy-Con, but instead the thumbsticks are replaced with d-pads. However, this famiclone is available just in Colombia.

===Czech Republic/Slovakia===
Most known clones sold in this country are &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, &quot;Bel Game&quot;, &quot;Pegasus IQ-502&quot;, &quot;Video Game-GT3300&quot; and &quot;Micro Genius&quot;. Nintendo entered Czechoslovakian market in 1992 with Game Boy, and in the next year, after split into two countries, Nintendo released SNES and NES. It is unknown if distributor took legal actions against famiclones resellers.

===Denmark===
In the mid-90s, many Danish markets sold Mastergames Supercom 72, but as in other Western countries, Nintendo quickly tracked down the distributors, sued them, and won in 1996. Most of the stock was destroyed by a bulldozer and the event was broadcast on TV as a warning to other pirates.

===Finland===
Some of the games shops marketed a few famiclones with yellow carts like &quot;Terminator 2&quot; or promoted unlicensed NES games like Action 52. Nintendo took legal actions against distributors, and in 1994 the biggest seller of pirate games and consoles had to pay damages of $75,000.

===Germany===
Few famiclones were released in Germany like &quot;VidiTex VT-720&quot;, sold by Ultra-Sat Vierhaus.

===Greater China===

The market of People&#x27;s Republic of China opened to the console in late 1980s, but high customs made imported consoles such as the Famicom very expensive. This why local companies began producing cheaper clones which created a large grey market for unlicensed consoles and games. Many brands were created, and one of the most popular was &quot;Xiǎo Bàwáng&quot; (Chinese: 小霸王; &#x27;Little Emperor or Little Tyrant&#x27;) by Subor. At the same time, many local manufacturers began distributing console to other countries, which made China one of main hubs of famiclone production. Nintendo saw the market potential and decided to enter China in 1994, but did not bother with piracy.Only by late 1995, pirates managed to sell around 30 million units of all type of famiclones across China.Certain models were officially advertised by Jackie Chan.

The popularity of these devices continued in the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the 2000s, due to the fact that in June 2000, the Chinese government decided to ban all video game consoles.Since the mid-1990s Chinese manufacturers has been selling the latest Famiclone models as an educational computer with a keyboard and a cartridge with simple educational games. It turned out Chinese authorities allowed the further sale of that devices, not recognizing it as console, which resulted in next clone models from other manufacturers as well as new unlicensed games, miscellaneous programmes like &quot;Windows 98&quot; or ports of newer games for 8-bit Nintendo such as &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (Bio Hazard), &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; or &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;.The full number of clones and units sold in China is still unknown. At the same time, Nintendo adapted to new regulations and entered the market with remodeled consoles through iQue.

Taiwan and Hong Kong had legal Famicom and other video games much earlier than mainland China, but piracy was spreading here too. Many companies, such as NTDEC or Micro Genius, were established in Taiwan and sold famiclones locally and internationally, which made Taiwan one of most important hubs for the production of clones. In order to stop it Nintendo tried to fight them. In Hong Kong, in addition to local brands, there were many importers from China and Taiwan.

===Greece===

In the late 1980s/early 1990s, Greek Software distributed &quot;BIT 72&quot;, which was one of the few clones that could play only NES cartridges. The console competes with officially distributed Master System. In 1991, Nintendo entered the Greek market and after that, most of the famiclones on the market were cheap imitations of SNES called &quot;Super Com SP-60&quot;.

===Hungary===
Nintendo entered the Hungarian market in 1991 with Game Boy and NES, and every clone was referred to as &quot;Sárga Kazettás Nintendo&quot; (Nintendo with yellow carts).

===Iceland===
Nintendo was in this region from the early 1980s, but stores distributed clones like &quot;Crazyboy&quot;, &quot;Redstone&quot;, &quot;NASA&quot; (compatible with NES), &quot;Action Set&quot;, &quot;NTDEC&quot; etc.

===India===
In 1987, Nintendo released the NES under the name Samurai marketed by Samurai Electronics. Following poor sales of the license-built NES consoles, Samurai-branded famiclones produced by Micro Genius began to appear in the early 1990s.

In the late 1990s, the demand for 8-bit clones became very high in India. There were around 55 brands in the country at the time such as Media Entertainment System (selling &quot;Little Master&quot; and &quot;Wiz Kid&quot;), Mitashi (selling &quot;Cricket&quot;), Mega and others.

===Indonesia===
Many famiclones from various producers, compatible with NES or Famicom, were rebranded and sold by Spica.

===Iran===
The most popular brand of clones were these, made by Micro Genius (simply called here &quot;Micro&quot;) and distributed from 1992. One of the most popular games were &quot;Super Mario Bros&quot;. (called locally &quot;Mushroom Eater&quot;), &quot;Contra&quot;, &quot;Duck Hunt&quot;, &quot;Double Dragon&quot;, &quot;Mega Man&quot; etc. Other clones include consoles like &quot;Super Semtoni&quot;, &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, etc.

===Israel===
In early 1990s, besides the original NES, many shops sold &quot;Megason&quot;, &quot;Micro Genius&quot;, &quot;Goodboy&quot;, &quot;Terminator B.S 550&quot;, &quot;Hitex&quot;, &quot;Family Game,&quot; etc.

===Italy===
Besides clones sold by its original names (like &quot;PolyStation&quot;), there are a lot of consoles rebranded by distributors and sold with new names like &quot;Cartobit&quot; (known elsewhere as &quot;Mega Power II&quot;), &quot;Top Consolle&quot; (known elsewhere as &quot;Terminator 2&quot;), &quot;MegaTronix&quot;, &quot;Argo Video Game System&quot; (known elsewhere as &quot;P-60&quot;), &quot;MARgame&quot; (known elsewhere as &quot;Micro Genius IQ-901&quot;) and &quot;Amstrad NN-900&quot; (known elsewhere as &quot;PolyStation 2&quot;). Nintendo was here from 1986, but it is unknown if they fought with piracy.

===Latin America===

These systems were released in the early 1990s and were referred to as &quot;Family&quot;. It competed with the original NES provided by C.Itoh. These clones remained famous in certain parts of the region and for example, PolyStations proved to be popular in parts of Costa Rica even in 2015.

===Mexico===
Like in the rest of Latin America, the official version of NES was sold by C.Itoh/Itochu Mexico, but in poorer places with less access to supermarkets or shops with toys and electronics, popular way of play were clones called by everyone &quot;Family&quot;, mostly resembling Famicom or sometimes Super Famicom, sold with 72 pins adaptor for NES games. The certain retailers in early 1990s also tried to create a brand and actively promote clones like &quot;MasterGames&quot; and games with Spanish manuals. Through the next years, Mexico got many other famiclones like educational computers or consoles mostly resembling the new generation ones, for example PlayStation.

===Mongolia===
Famiclones were brought to Mongolia from China and the most popular is &quot;Subor&quot;.

===North Korea===
&quot;Micro Genius&quot; consoles were sighted being played by children in the Songdowon International Children&#x27;s Camp in 2008.

===Poland===
In Poland, Pegasus was marketed by BobMark International., company established in 1991. In its lifespan, BobMark sold three models: &quot;MT-777DX&quot;, &quot;Super Pegasus&quot; and &quot;IQ-502&quot;.

In 1994, changes in Polish copyright law resulted that BobMark get rid of bootleg games and bought official license to software published by Codemasters, Sachen and Western Technologies and distribute them in Asian cartridges. In late 1994, Nintendo entered Polish market so BobMark began to sell official Sega products. From that time Pegasus brand began to slowly lose its importance due to more cheaper clones and new generation consoles with last models sold until late 1990s. The Pegasus reportedly sold more than 1 million units.

Other popular famiclones in Poland are for example &quot;BS-500AS&quot;, also known as &quot;Terminator&quot;, &quot;Gold Leopard King (GLK)&quot;, &quot;Polystation&quot;, &quot;Fenix&quot; or &quot;Family Game&quot;.

Nintendo took legal actions against small sellers of famiclones and cartridges producers, but they never sued Pegasus distributors.

===Portugal===
Most of these clones were called &quot;Family Game&quot;. Games and consoles were very easy to find even after 1991 when Nintendo entered the market.

===Quebec===
Micro-Genius versions of Famicom games were a large part of the gaming market in Quebec throughout 1989-1990, with dozens of games selling thousands of copies in flea markets, independent game stores, and video game rental stores. Notably, Micro-Genius&#x27; version of &quot;Super Mario Bros 3&quot; was sold extensively throughout Quebec for months ahead of its official North American NES release. Montreal was described as a major international thoroughfare for Micro-Genius sales, with a network of Taiwanese importers acting as a distribution nexus for Micro-Genius games and consoles, to such an extent that most of the cartridge labelling was bilingual to respect the Quebec-specific language &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; laws, despite being illegal pirate games. This culminated in Nintendo issuing injunctions against 68 retailers, and the Sureté du Québec seizing several tens of thousands of Micro-Genius cartridges in December 1990, as part of a crackdown on the import and sale of illicit Micro-Genius games from Taiwan. As a result of this extensive market history, Micro-Genius games have become a prized collector&#x27;s item especially in Quebec. Although Micro Genius did sell some &quot;IQ-501&quot; Famiclone consoles in Canada, almost the entire pirate market was composed of Micro Genius cartridges with an adapter to play them on a legitimate NES console.

===Romania===

In Romania, several NES clones could be found in toy stores under marketing names such as &quot;Polystation&quot;, &quot;Terminator&quot;, or variations of Famicom BASIC keyboard compatible consoles and these consoles were shipped with games such as &quot;&#x27;999999 in 1&quot; which consisted of around 6 games in one cartridge and the rest were different levels of these games. The games and series consisted mainly of &quot;Super Mario&quot;, &quot;Bomberman&quot;, &quot;Lunar Pool&quot;, &quot;Double Dragon 3&quot;, &quot;Star Soldier&quot;, and &quot;Ninja Ryukenden 3&quot;.

Nintendo entered Romanian market in mid-1990s, but they didn&#x27;t bother with famiclone sellers.

===Russia and the former Soviet union===

The &quot;Dendy&quot; (Russian: Де́нди) was a hardware clone of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) popular in Russia and other former Soviet countries. Dendy is an NTSC console with forced PAL (SECAM on early models) mode, like Pegasus. Released in 1992 by the Steepler company, the Dendy was easily the most popular video game console of its time there, and enjoyed a degree of fame roughly equivalent to that experienced by the NES/Famicom in North America and Japan. Business was so successful that the company spawned its own TV show about Dendy on Russian TV, and created stores all across Moscow and St. Petersburg, promoting and selling the console and its cartridges. Also, a cartoon about the &quot;Dendy Elephant&quot;, the character on the console&#x27;s logo, was filmed but not finished.

In 1994, Steepler, Dendy producer, reached an agreement with Nintendo to sell consoles in all post-Soviet states with relinquished its claim to Dendy sales, meaning that Nintendo didn&#x27;t take legal action against famiclones. Instead, Steepler began suing other pirates. The company had a registered trademark for Dendy in Russia, which meant that any pirate who used their logo was breaking the law.

The Dendy reportedly sold 6 million units.

Dendy had competition in form of &quot;Subor&quot;, &quot;Bitman&quot; and &quot;Kenga&quot;. After Dendy there were also other clones like &quot;Simba&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Magistr&quot;.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, clones, known as &quot;TV Games&quot;, were widely available. One popular clone available in the early 1990s was the &quot;Golden China&quot;; while another was &quot;Reggie&#x27;s Entertainment System&quot;, named after the toy store chain that sold it; Older models looked like the Famicom but newer models resembled the PlayStation, like the &quot;TeleGamestation&quot; which also had a&quot;mini tower&quot; version with keyboard, and black/white monitor, to include educational software. These TeleGamestations have cartridges around half the size of the original Nintendo Entertainment System games, and although most games were cracked from there, some were also taken from the Master System. The box advertised &quot;dazzling graphics&quot; and the monitor on the box set features a modern-day at the time, soccer game. Games could be bought in chain stores or on the market or certain stores. Most cartridges were multi-packs, or many games within one cartridge. In some cases, games have had their names removed, and in some cases the original name of the game (for example, &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; was renamed &quot;Medical Hospital&quot;).

Nintendo entered South African market in 1992 and took legal action against Golden China for importing copied games.

===Southeast Asia===
In Southeast Asia, the &quot;Micro Genius&quot; was sold as an alternative to the Famicom. It originated from Taiwan in the 1990s and uses 60-pin cartridges, most of which are multicarts. The Micro Genius had some original games, including &quot;Chinese Chess&quot; and &quot;Thunder Warrior&quot;.

===South Korea===

Starting from 1989, a wide range of clones were marketed in South Korea by different companies like &quot;Batman&quot;/&quot;Family Computer II&quot;, &quot;Kuk Je Academy K-007&quot;, &quot;Family Computer GH-100&quot; (by Gihan Electronics), &quot;Family Computer&quot; (by Modowa), &quot;GamDori&quot;, &quot;Joycom&quot;, &quot;Viking&quot;, &quot;Supercom&quot;, &quot;Pascal&quot;, &quot;Noriteul&quot;, &quot;Little Com&quot; and many more.

The official NES console was marketed by Nintendo in South Korea under the name &quot;Hyundai Comboy&quot;.

===Southeast Europe===

First clones were sold as &quot;Micro Genius&quot; or simple clones called &quot;Family Computer&quot; that looked like Famicom. When Sega released Mega Drive, most pirates wanted to mislead buyers giving a cheaper and similar looking clone, mostly called &quot;Terminator&quot;. The same situation was with Super Nintendo and most known 8-bit ripoff of this one was sold as &quot;SP-60&quot;. Nintendo created distribution networks in every country of the region between 1992 and 1995. In some of the countries, Nintendo took legal action against shop that sold this clones, but in other countries, distributors of Nintendo didn&#x27;t react.

===Spain===
Nintendo distributed the NES here from 1987, but clones were still popular. The most common were these from the &quot;NASA&quot; and &quot;Creation&quot; brands (which are nearly the same, being the console name printed on the front the only difference), compatible with NES and Famicom games. It originally used the same chipset as the Dendy, manufactured by United Microelectronics Corporation, but manufacturers later used the NOAC ASICs. The NASA clones were sold by Gluk Video, a company known for releasing many unlicensed games for NES in Spain. Besides NASA they distributed clones such as &quot;Micro Genius&quot;, &quot;Yess&quot; and &quot;Silver Shadow&quot;.

Other known clones sold here are &quot;MasterGames&quot;, &quot;Nippon&#x27;do&quot;, &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, etc.

===Thailand===
Thailand&#x27;s best selling famiclones were models from the Family brand - &quot;FR 102&quot; and &quot;FR 202&quot;, introduced by Family TSI Ltd.

===Turkey===
The most popular brand of clones is &quot;Micro Genius&quot;, distributed from early 1990s by Aral, with new model being released by them even in 21st century. There were also other brands like &quot;Home Computer&quot; (by Emek Elektronik), &quot;Star Trek&quot; &quot;Game Star&quot;, &quot; Kontorland&quot; and &quot;Fun Time&quot;. Nintendo was here from at least 1990, but it seems that they did not bother with clones.

===Ukraine===
One of the most known clone in this country is &quot;Dendy&quot;. There were also other brands like &quot;Kenga&quot; which were very widespread in Ukraine. Kenga even had a TV show called &quot;Kenga Predstavlyaet!&quot;

Within the Donetsk region, Atlantida company sold a Dendy competitor, the &quot;Jippy&quot; game console, which was a clone of Ending Man. The console also used a mascot similar to Dendy - a similarly dressed hippopotamus named Jippy. It had headphone jacks and switches to activate the &quot;turbo-pause&quot;. According to various estimates, 15,000 copies were sold, including 5,000 in Moscow, Russia. A TV show Jippy Club was produced on the local Donetsk TV station. The project closed in 1994.

In 1994, Steepler, Dendy producer, reached an agreement with Nintendo to sell consoles in all post-Soviet states with relinquished its claim to Dendy sales, meaning that Nintendo didn&#x27;t take legal action against famiclones.

===United Kingdom===
Famiclones in the UK were not popular and only a few like the &quot;Scorpion 8&quot;, sold by Interactive Enterprises, &quot;Good Boy&quot; by DGM Limited or &quot;DAC&quot; by Digital Audio Corporation were sold.

===United States===

During the life of the NES, famiclones were very rarely distributed and more common was sale of unlicensed video games produced by e.g NTDEC, which often resulted in lawsuits from Nintendo. &quot;Power Player Super Joy III&quot; was one of the clones sold in US and was quickly discontinued in 2005, when Nintendo initiated a court case against sellers.

===Venezuela===
Around the late 1980s, a new established company called Nintendo de Venezuela C.A began selling famiclones and bootleg games in self-made packaging. All consoles, games and accessories had the Nintendo logo, the boxes were translated into Spanish and had warranty cards, instructions and stickers to make everything look professional and official. As competition, the original Nintendo products were sold by Itochu Venezuela S.A from the late 1980s with NES being referred as &quot;Nintendo el Original&quot; to differentiate original one from famiclones. After several years of legal disputes among themselves, Nintendo filed a lawsuit against the company in July 1995, which was ruled in their favor in 1999 and Nintendo C.A was obligated to pay damages and destroy all copies that were left in warehouses.

<text>Kerry Michelle Armstrong (born 12 September 1958) is an Australian actress and author. She is one of only two actresses to win two Australian Film Institute Awards in the same year, winning Best Actress in a Leading Role for &quot;Lantana&quot; and Best Actress in a Leading Role in a Television Drama for &quot;SeaChange&quot; in 2001.

After early television roles in Australia including &quot;Prisoner&quot; (1979) and &quot;Skyways&quot; (1980), Armstrong moved to the United States in 1981, where she played Ophelia in &quot;Hamlet&quot; and Isabella in &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., and had a role in the soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot; (1985–86). She returned to Australia in 1987. Her other television roles include &quot;MDA&quot; (2002–03) and &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; (2008–11).

==Career==

===Early years===
Armstrong appeared in both acting and presenting roles on Australian television in the 1970s and early 1980. One of her first acting roles was on television series &quot;Marion&quot;, released in March 1974. She appeared as a GTV-9 weather girl, and then in a dramatic acting role, appearing as Lynn &#x27;Wonky&#x27; Warner, an original character in Network Ten women&#x27;s prison drama &quot;Prisoner&quot;. Initially planned to last 16 episodes, the series was continued and Armstrong appeared in the first 44 episodes. She then switched to another ongoing role in drama series &quot;Skyways&quot; for 49 episodes. In 1981 she co-hosted the Network Ten series &quot;Together Tonight&quot; with Greg Evans.

In 1981 Armstrong married rock band Australian Crawl&#x27;s rhythm guitarist Brad Robinson. Armstrong and Robinson co-wrote &quot;Easy on Your Own&quot;, a track on Australian Crawl&#x27;s second album &quot;Sirocco&quot; and B-side to the single &quot;Errol&quot;.

===United States and &quot;Dynasty&quot;===
Armstrong moved to the United States in 1981, where she studied under Herbert Berghof and Uta Hagen at the HB Studio in New York City on an acting scholarship. With the studio&#x27;s Playwrights Foundation, she played Juliet in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Ophelia in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and Isabella in &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; at the Arena Stage in Washington, DC. In order to obtain residency, Armstrong and Robinson agreed she would have to marry a US citizen, so they separated and she married her friend Alexander Bernstein. Armstrong only had a professional arrangement with Bernstein, but her long distance from Robinson dissolved their relationship. In the US, she starred as Christine in Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Dalliance&quot; at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut, had an ongoing role in daytime serial &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, and became part of The Actors&#x27; Gang along with John Cusack and Tim Robbins. After working in the group&#x27;s plays, Armstrong appeared in seven episodes of &quot;Dynasty&quot; as Elena, Duchess of Branagh. Robbins and Armstrong became romantically involved. Cusack, Robbins and Armstrong auditioned for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; but only Armstrong was offered a part, which she declined. She also guest starred in the 1984 &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; episode &quot;Death Takes a Curtain Call&quot;.

===Australian return===
In 1987, Armstrong returned to Australia upon the death of her grandmother. In the early 1990s, she resumed acting in Australian television series, including &quot;Police Rescue&quot;, &quot;Ocean Girl&quot;, &quot;Come In Spinner&quot;, &quot;All Together Now&quot; and &quot;Halfway Across the Galaxy and Turn Left&quot;. In 1991 Armstrong was nominated for an AFI award for Best Actress for her role in the film &quot;Hunting&quot; which was released by Paramount in the U.S.

In 1998, Armstrong was offered the role of Heather Jelly in the television series &quot;SeaChange&quot;, the ever-devoted but long-suffering wife of corrupt local mayor Bob (John Howard). The role won her critical acclaim and garnered several awards. When &quot;SeaChange&quot; ended in 2000, Armstrong continued on with her theatre work and also appeared in &quot;Lantana&quot;, the award-winning Ray Lawrence film also starring Anthony LaPaglia, Barbara Hershey, Geoffrey Rush, Glenn Robbins and Vince Colosimo.

Armstrong won the Inside Film (IF) Award, Film Critics Circle of Australia Award and the AFI Award for her &quot;Lantana&quot; performance. In the same year she won another AFI award, for the final season of &quot;SeaChange&quot;, making her the second actress to win two AFI awards in one year. The first had been Sacha Horler for her 1998 Lead Role in &quot;Praise&quot; and 1999 Supporting Role in &quot;Soft Fruit&quot; awarded in 1999.

In 2002, Armstrong joined the cast of medico-legal drama &quot;MDA&quot; on ABC alongside Jason Donovan and Shane Bourne. However, she left the series at the end of its second season. In the series her character, Dr Ella Davis, left the firm that was the focus of the show. After &quot;MDA&quot;, Armstrong appeared in films &quot;One Perfect Day&quot;, &quot;Oyster Farmer&quot;, &quot;Virus&quot;, &quot;Car Pool&quot; and &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot;. On 10 May 2008 ABC-TV started screening a six-part series &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; with Armstrong in the lead role as Louisa Atherton. In 2008 she appeared in the film &quot;Reservations&quot;. In 2010, &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; returned for a second season on the ABC followed by a third and final season in 2011. In the same year she starred in the short film, &quot;The Forgotten Men&quot;, alongside Jack Thompson and Gyton Grantley. 2016 saw Armstrong return to Australian screens in the series &quot;The Wrong Girl&quot; for Network Ten.

In 2024, Armstrong was announced as part of the cast for STAN Australia Christmas movie &quot;Nugget is Dead: A Christmas Story.&quot;

===Author===
Armstrong wrote a self-help book, &quot;The Circles&quot;, released on 1 November 2003. She described the book as a practical exercise in empowering people. In May 2008, Armstrong told the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; the book&#x27;s US publisher, Beyond Words, had received a call from a large book club in the US which wanted 21,000 copies of the book.

Her second book, &quot;Fool on the Hill&quot;, released in March 2006, is about the nature of personality. A travel guide, &quot;Newcomer&#x27;s Handbook for New York City&quot; was co-edited with Belden Merims in 1996.

===Public profile===
Armstrong has worked with several charitable organisations including Childwise, Big hART, and Cure for Life Foundation which sponsors research into brain tumour treatments. In 2006, she represented Cure for Life in season five of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. Armstrong and dance partner, Christopher Ryan, were the third couple eliminated from the show.

Armstrong has publicly opposed the War in Iraq, and in protest, sat on the steps of the Victorian Parliament in a purple bra to draw attention to her cause.

In October 2008 Armstrong appeared as the face of a &quot;myth-busting&quot; advertising campaign for Coca-Cola Amatil, created by the agency Singleton Ogilvy &amp; Mather. Titled &quot;Kerry Armstrong on Motherhood and Myth Busting&quot;, the print advertisement purported to correct &quot;myths and conjecture&quot; about Coca-Cola drink products. Claiming her three boys called her &quot;Mum, the myth buster&quot;, Armstrong rejected suggestions that Coca-Cola &quot;rots your teeth&quot;, &quot;makes you fat&quot; and is &quot;packed with caffeine&quot;.

In April 2009, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commissioner ruled that the Coca-Cola advertisements in which Armstrong appeared were misleading. The ACCC&#x27;s chairman, Graeme Samuel, said, &quot;Coke&#x27;s messages were totally unacceptable, creating an impression which is likely to mislead that Coca-Cola cannot contribute to weight gain, obesity and tooth decay&quot;.

==Personal life==
Armstrong was born in Melbourne in 1958. In 1981, she was briefly married Australian Crawl rhythm guitarist Brad Robinson. Under the advice of her US agent and with Robinson&#x27;s consent, she divorced and married a friend, Alexander Bernstein (son of Leonard Bernstein), in order to resolve visa issues and allow her to work in the United States. 
In 1990, she married writer-producer Mac Gudgeon
 when their son was three months old. The marriage to Gudgeon ended and in 1996 she married builder Mark Croft with whom she has twin sons. Armstrong and Croft separated in 2001. As of 2008, she lived with her three sons in the Yarra Valley. She now lives in Balnarring, Victoria.

<text>Buarcos is a &quot;freguesia&quot; (civil parish) in Figueira da Foz Municipality, Portugal. The population in 2011 was 18,454, in an area of 15.53 km².

During the 1600s, the people of Buarcos were harassed by pirates and built the long fortification that stands to this day. It is a traditional fishing town that has grown also as a noted beach resort due to its natural landscape namely the beach which is sheltered from the strong northern winds by the Boa Viagem small mountain range (&quot;Serra da Boa Viagem&quot;). Many of its inhabitants still work in the fishing industry but tourism is also an important activity. It has hotels, seafood restaurants and bars with view over the bay and the extensive beach.

In the 20th century Buarcos was a popular beach for Portuguese people from the entire Centro Region from Coimbra and beyond. In the 21st century Buarcos, like the entire region’s coastal beach locations, became a popular destination for a larger number of European travellers as well.

<doc id="881324" wikidata="Q4810107" url="?curid=881324" title="Association of University Teachers">
<text>The Association of University Teachers (AUT) was the trade union and professional association that represented academic (teaching and research) and academic-related (librarians, IT professionals and senior administrators) staff at pre-1992 universities in the United Kingdom. The final general secretary of AUT was Sally Hunt.

AUT also had branches in a number of post-1992 universities (the ex-polytechnics and other institutes that have become universities since 1992) and in university colleges, although the main union representing academic staff in these institutes was the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE).

On 2 December 2005, the results of a membership ballot on a merger of AUT and NATFHE was announced. The merger was supported by 79.2% of AUT and 95.7% of NATFHE members who voted. The two unions amalgamated on 1 June 2006, and after a transitional year, full operational unity was achieved in June 2007. The new union is called the University and College Union (UCU).

==History==

===The formation of AUT (1909-1919)===
In 1909, Douglas Laurie, a young zoology lecturer at Liverpool University called a meeting &quot;To consider a proposal to form an Association for bringing together the members of the Junior Staff more into touch with one another and with the life of the University&quot;

At this time an increasing number of non-professorial staff were being employed. These Junior Staff or Assistant Lecturers were poorly paid, did essentially the same duties as professors and had few promotion prospects. In addition they had no representation on the bodies governing the Universities. Although the society formed at Liverpool was formally a &quot;dining and discussion society&quot; from an early stage it was clearly a new pressure group.

At first its aims were local and in 1910 it won a campaign over representation on the faculties but on learning that similar groups had been formed or were in the process of formation they invited representatives of the junior staff from Bristol, Sheffield, Birmingham, Cardiff and Manchester for a dinner.

In 1913 the junior staff at the Victoria University of Manchester (now the University of Manchester) presented a request for improvements in pay and grading to their University Council. This included a suggestion that the starting pay should be substantially increased. The Council replied that while it agreed that eventually there should be an increase, at the current time there was insufficient money to pay for this.

By 1917 inflation had rapidly eroded the value of salaries and Douglas Laurie called a meeting on 15 December 1917 to draw up a memorandum to present to the Board of Education. Almost as an after thought he invited representatives of Assistant Lecturers from all Universities. The meeting was attended by delegates from 15 institutions. The issues raised by the memorandum drafted at the meeting included: pay; tenure; status; grading; opportunities for research and superannuation. Finally a motion was passed to a new association with the name &quot;The Association of University Lecturers&quot;. The name (which implicitly excluded professors from membership) caused some dissent but a split was prevented. However the Scottish Lecturers went their own way and formed a separate Association in 1922 which later merged with AUT in 1949 but retained some of its autonomy.

The issue of pensions brought the idea of professional unity to the fore. The pension scheme for lecturers was to be left out of the new Teachers pension fund formed by the Teachers&#x27; (Superannuation) Act 1918. As pension funds affect staff at levels of their career this created pressure the Association to be one which included professors as well.

At a conference in Bristol 27–28 June 1919 professorial delegates were present. The name of the new Association was left until all other matters were decided. The draft rules circulated at the conference read &quot;The name of the society shall be... (to be decided at a later date)&quot;. This was to be repeated nearly a century later when delegates to the 2005 AUT council were presented with a draft rulebook for the merger with NATFHE which stated: &quot;The name of the union shall be [insert name]&quot;. Speaking from the chair Laurie pointed out that &quot;the idea which brought the Association into being was of a trade union character, but expressed the hope that, when material conditions had been satisfactorily improved, educational matters generally would form the essential points on which discussion would take place&quot;.

In the end it was agreed that the new association&#x27;s objectives would be&quot;the advancement of University Education and Research and the promotion of common action among University teachers in connection therewith&quot; with membership open to professors. Finally the name &quot;Association of University Teachers&quot; was voted for &quot;nem con&quot; (no votes against but some abstentions) and Douglas Laurie was elected as the first President.

It is interesting to speculate how the Association would have developed if professors had been excluded from membership and it was set up on a basis of representing solely the junior staff..

The Association&#x27;s structure was a federation of Local Associations (branches) which elected delegates to a Central Council. The Council delegates then elected an Executive Committee. The Council itself met twice a year.

===Industrial action against new pay structures 2004===
In March 2004, AUT members took industrial action over the proposed new pay structures (the Framework Agreement) offered by the Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA). The original proposals from UCEA would have meant large reductions in income due to smaller annual increments. The action involved a one-day national strike and one-day strikes in each of the four countries of the UK, followed by an assessment boycott that threatened to derail examinations that summer. The industrial action lasted 25 days before UCEA gave in and agreed to many of the union&#x27;s demands. The agreement included the so-called &quot;Memorandum of Understanding&quot; which provided certain safeguards on the way the new pay structures were to be implemented in pre 1992 universities. However the agreement did not cover post 1992 universities.

===Boycott of Israeli universities 2005===

On 22 April 2005, the AUT Council voted to boycott two Israeli universities: the University of Haifa and Bar-Ilan University. The motions to AUT Council were prompted by the call for a boycott from Palestinian academics and others. The AUT Council voted to boycott Bar-Ilan because it runs courses at colleges in the occupied West Bank (referring to Ariel College) and &quot;is thus directly involved with the occupation of Palestinian territories contrary to United Nations resolutions&quot;. It boycotted Haifa because it was alleged that the university had wrongly disciplined a lecturer. The action against the lecturer was supposedly for supporting a student who wrote about attacks on Palestinians during the founding of the state of Israel. The boycott, which was not compulsory, was set to last until Haifa &quot;ceases its victimisation of academic staff and students who seek to research and discuss the history of the founding of the state of Israel&quot;.

The AUT&#x27;s decision was immediately condemned by Jewish groups and members of the AUT. Critics of the boycott within and outside the AUT noted that, at the council at which the boycott motion was passed, the leadership had cut short debate citing a lack of time. The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Union of Jewish Students accused the AUT of purposely holding the vote during Passover, when many Jewish members could not be present. Israel&#x27;s embassy in London issued a statement criticizing the AUT&#x27;s vote as a &quot;distorted decision that ignores the British public&#x27;s opinion&quot;, and condemning the resolutions for being &quot;as perverse in their content as in the way they were debated and adopted.&quot; Zvi Ravner, Israel’s deputy ambassador in London, also noted that &quot;[t]he last time that Jews were boycotted in universities was in 1930s Germany.&quot; Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League issued a statement condemning the &quot;misguided and ill-timed decision to boycott academics from the only country in the Middle East where universities enjoy political independence&quot;.

The AUT said that members had voted for the boycott in response to a plea for action by a group of Palestinian academics. It was condemned by the Israeli Embassy, the British Ambassador in Israel, by Jewish Human Rights groups, by al-Quds University in Jerusalem, by the National Postgraduate Committee of the UK, and by Universities UK.

Some members of the AUT, headed by Open University lecturer Jon Pike - subsequently gathered enough signatures to call a special meeting on the subject. The meeting was held on 26 May 2005, at Friends Meeting House in London. At the meeting, the AUT decided to cancel the boycott of both Israeli universities. Reasons cited for the decision were: the damage to academic freedom, the hampering of dialogue and peace effort between Israelis and Palestinian, and that boycotting Israel alone could not be justified.

===Merger with NATFHE 2004-2007===
Attempts had been ongoing for some time to develop a plan for merger. Prior to 2004, these however, came to nothing. In 2004 both AUT&#x27;s and NATFHE&#x27;s conferences voted to &quot;explore ways of achieving maximum unity between the two unions&quot;.
Initially it was not clear what form this would take - closer collaboration, full merger or something in between. However proposals for a new union which would include all AUT and NATFHE members quickly emerged and proposals to ballot the members were endorsed at the conferences in April and May 2005. On 2 December 2005 the results of the ballot was announced. The merger was supported by 79.2% of AUT and 95.7% of NATFHE members who voted. The two unions amalgamated on 1 June 2006, and then entered a transitional year until full operational unity is achieved in June 2007. The new union is called the University and College Union (UCU).

===2006 AUT and NATFHE industrial action ===

In 2006 AUT and NATFHE engaged in industrial dispute with Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA) over pay. AUT and NATFHE claimed that UCEA promised that one third of the extra income from top up fees would be spent on pay and their 2006 pay claim was based on this. UCEA&#x27;s initial response was &quot;that it is very likely that a significant proportion of the HE sectors new income will be spent on improvements in staff pay and conditions, but that HEIs had never given a commitment&quot;. AUT and NATFHE both voted for strike action and carried out a one-day stoppage on 8 March. From 9 March to 6 June they boycotted the marking of exams and coursework, with the AUT (but not NATFHE) also boycotting the setting of exams and they rejected an offer of 12.6% over three years which was made on 8 May and a further offer of 13.12% over three years made on 30 May. Concerns grew that students might not be able to graduate in 2006 until the industrial action was suspended at midnight on 7 June while members were balloted on a new offer.

Before the present time in the story, the Ninku were targeted by an evil empire and the Ninku corps were formed to combat the menace. The names of the corps were taken from the twelve Chinese zodiac animals () and each captain of the corps was called the zodiac animal Ninku master (). Their powers are derived from nature and a specific dragon to their own element, with the being the almighty master of all the elements. The Ninku were disbanded by their master before the end of the war and as such, the Empire was victorious and the Ninku became vilified by the Empire as the perpetrators of the war and made attempts to eliminate any surviving members. Three years later, Fūsuke, the young former captain of the 1st Ninku corps and controller of the wind and Hiroyuki, his flatulent penguin, start a journey, searching for the other Ninku captains. However, a new group of Ninku users has arisen and are trying to take over the world. Fūsuke and his penguin must defeat the new Ninku empire with the help of his old comrades.

==Reception and legacy==
The &quot;Ninku&quot; manga has had over 9 million copies in circulation.

In a fan poll posted by BIGLOBE in 2012 about favorite &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; anime adaptations, &quot;Ninku&quot; ranked 45th out of 50 anime adaptations, and 40th out of 60 series in a 2019 poll conducted by &quot;Goo Ranking&quot; of &quot;’90s Anime That Deserve Remakes&quot;.

John Oppliger of &quot;AnimeNation&quot; attributed the low popularity of the &quot;Ninku&quot; anime series to its lack of compelling narrative development and the sequential lengthy story arc structure that make other action series like &quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;One Piece&quot; and &quot;Bleach&quot; popular. He praised the characters and animation of the fight sequences, but considered them repetitive and he stated that the show does not encourage much viewer loyalty.

In a review for the &quot;Ninku/YuYu Hakusho Double Feature&quot; DVD release, Chris Beveridge from AnimeOnDVD praised &quot;Ninku: The Movie&quot; for its fight sequences and animation, but recommended this release only to fans of either series. Mike Toole of &quot;Anime Jump&quot; in his &quot;Ninku: The Movie&quot; review stated: &quot;Aside from the engaging story and great fight scenes, there are a few other good points about &quot;Ninku&quot;.&quot;
&quot;Ninku&quot; has inspired artists such as Masashi Kishimoto of &quot;Naruto&quot; fame, who used to copy Kiriyama&#x27;s drawings in his studying to become a manga artist.

<doc id="881329" wikidata="Q1108648" url="?curid=881329" title="William Babcock Hazen">
<text>William Babcock Hazen (September 27, 1830 – January 16, 1887) was a career United States Army officer who served in the Indian Wars, as a Union general in the American Civil War, and as Chief Signal Officer of the U.S. Army. His most famous service was defending &quot;Hell&#x27;s Half Acre&quot; at the Battle of Stones River in 1862, and seizing Fort McAllister, Georgia, in December 1864, which allowed William Sherman to capture Savannah at the end of his March to the Sea. 

== Early life and military career ==
Hazen was born in West Hartford, Vermont, but moved to Ohio at the age of three. He spent his boyhood in the town of Hiram and formed a close personal friendship with future President James A. Garfield. He graduated from the United States Military Academy, in 1855, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Infantry. Before the Civil War, he served primarily in the Pacific Northwest and Texas, where he was wounded severely on November 3, 1859, during a fight with the Comanches along the Llano River. He was absent on sick leave until 1861.

== Civil War ==
Soon after the fall of Fort Sumter, he was promoted to captain of the 8th U.S. Infantry, and by October 29, 1861, he was Colonel of the 41st Ohio Infantry. Starting in January 1862, he commanded a brigade in the Army of the Ohio, under Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell. His first major battle was Shiloh, where Buell&#x27;s army arrived on the second day (April 7, 1862), in time to counterattack the Confederate army for a Union victory.

In the fall of 1862, Hazen fought under Buell at Perryville. His brigade was reorganized into the XIV Corps (later to be known as the Army of the Cumberland) under Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, and, in this organization, Hazen served in his most famous engagement, the Battle of Stones River, at Murfreesboro, Tennessee. On December 31, 1862, the Confederate forces under Gen. Braxton Bragg delivered a devastating assault that caught Rosecrans by surprise and drove his forces back three miles (5 km), leaving their backs to the Stones River. Hazen&#x27;s brigade defended a small cedar forest known by the locals as &quot;Round Forest&quot;. Hazen and Brig. Gen. Charles Cruft were at a salient in the Union line, whose loss would have given the Confederate a complete victory. Maj. Gens. George H. Thomas and Lovell H. Rousseau, Hazen&#x27;s division commander, concentrated artillery to support them. Several Confederate attacks were beaten off. Their defense was so spirited against heavy odds that they arguably saved the Union line. The Round Forest is now known informally as &quot;Hell&#x27;s Half Acre&quot;. Hazen was wounded in the shoulder during the fight and was promoted to brigadier general, effective November 29, for his gallantry. Months after the battle, a monument was erected by veterans of the fight in a small Union cemetery at the site. This is considered to be the oldest Civil War monument remaining in its original battlefield location.

Hazen continued with the Army of the Cumberland through the successful Tullahoma Campaign, the serious Union defeat at the Battle of Chickamauga in XXI Corps, and the victorious Battle of Chattanooga in IV Corps. Hazen&#x27;s brigade played a major role in the crossing at Brown&#x27;s Ferry near Chattanooga that, together with the arrival of troops under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, opened the line of supply or &quot;Cracker Line&quot; to the Army of the Cumberland, penned into its defenses by the Confederates.. Hazen was promoted to brevet major in the regular army for Chickamauga and brevet lieutenant colonel for Chattanooga. He served under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman in the Atlanta Campaign, the March to the Sea, and the Carolinas Campaign, in the Army of the Cumberland and then in the Army of the Tennessee. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Pickett&#x27;s Mill while still leading a brigade in IV Corps. His brigade had to attack without adequate support and suffered badly. Later, asked where his brigade was, Hazen replied, &quot;Brigade, Hell, I have none. But what is left of it is over there in the woods.&quot;

Hazen was elevated to division command in XV Corps late in the Atlanta Campaign. During Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea, Hazen&#x27;s division distinguished itself in the capture of Fort McAllister, Georgia, on December 13, 1864. This action opened communications between Sherman&#x27;s army group and the United States Navy. He was promoted to brevet colonel in the regular army in September 1864 and to major general of volunteers on December 13, 1864. Very late in the war, he commanded the XV Corps of the Army of the Tennessee and was eventually promoted to brevet major general in the regular army, March 13, 1865.

== Postbellum career ==
As the U.S. Army was drawn down following the war, Hazen was redesignated as colonel of the 38th U.S. Infantry (a Buffalo Soldier regiment, one of four such infantry regiments) in July 1866 and transferred to the 6th U.S. Infantry in March 1869. He served primarily on the Western frontier, including being stationed at Fort Buford in the Dakota Territory from 1872 to 1880, but he also visited Europe as an observer during the Franco-Prussian War. One of Hazen&#x27;s most important roles on the frontier was handling the negotiations that preceded the Battle of Washita River. Hazen offered testimony in one of the procurement corruption scandals that rocked the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant, which resulted in the resignation of Grant&#x27;s Secretary of War, William W. Belknap. The Belknap scandal was tied to other disputes over promotions and squabbles over credit for victories in the Civil war. One of the squabbles pitted Hazen against Maj. Gen. David S. Stanley over the exact location of the monument at Stone&#x27;s River. Stanley, who was fighting other generals over credit for the Union victory at the Second Battle of Franklin, argued that the monument was in the wrong place. Stanley was a friend of Belknap, which ties the controversies together.

Hazen also engaged in controversy by criticizing George Armstrong Custer&#x27;s book &quot;Life on the Plains&quot; in one of his own books. (Custer had criticized Hazen&#x27;s dealings with chief Black Kettle before Washita River.) Hazen&#x27;s relationships with Custer and with his superiors in the post-war army were such that the writer Ambrose Bierce called him &quot;The best hated man I ever knew&quot;. Hazen even managed to offend Lt. Gen. William T. Sherman, a former friend and an ally against Belknap.

On December 15, 1880, President Rutherford B. Hayes promoted Hazen to brigadier general and appointed him Chief Signal Officer of the U.S. Army, a post he held until his death. His tenure was noted for focusing his department on basic research, rather than the practical matters that occupied his predecessor, Albert J. Myer. But he also continued to generate public controversy. One of the duties of the U.S. Army Signal Corps at the time was the management of the Weather Service and Hazen criticized the government&#x27;s lack of response to the distress of the International Polar Year expedition to Fort Conger, Lady Franklin Bay (on Ellesmere Island, Canada). The expedition, led by Lieutenant Adolphus Greely, departed in the summer of 1881, and in 1882, a scheduled resupply effort failed, leaving the 25 men of the expedition without support to survive the winter about from the North Pole. In 1883 a rescue party commanded by Lt. Ernest A. Garlington also failed to rescue the stranded party. By the time the rescue expedition of June 1884 reached Greely, only he and six of his command remained alive. Hazen publicly criticized Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln for his handling of the affair, citing his refusal to send further assistance after the failure of Garlington&#x27;s rescue mission, until Greely&#x27;s wife, Henrietta, forced Lincoln to act in response to outraged public opinion. Lincoln censured Hazen for his public criticisms and Hazen was court-martialed in 1885, resulting in a mild reprimand from President Chester A. Arthur. The newspapers, however, backed Hazen against Secretary Lincoln.

Hazen married Mildred McLean, daughter of Washington McLean, the owner of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. After his death, she married Admiral George Dewey on November 9, 1899.

Hazen died in Washington, D.C., having been taken ill after attending a reception held by President Grover Cleveland, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. The &quot;New York Times&quot;, in its obituary, called Hazen &quot;aggressive and disputatious&quot;, traits that served him well on the battlefield but made him powerful enemies in peace time. Hazen, Nevada, and Hazen Bay in Alaska are named in his honor, as are Lake Hazen and Camp Hazen, both on Ellesmere Island.

<text>Maghrebi mint tea (Maghrebi Arabic: , &quot;atay&quot;; ), also known as Moroccan mint tea and Algerian mint tea, is a North African preparation of gunpowder green tea with spearmint leaves and sugar. 

It is traditional to the Greater Maghreb region (the northwest African countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Mauritania). Its consumption has spread throughout North Africa, parts of the Sahel, France, Spain, the Arab world, and Middle East. 

Mint tea is central to social life in the Maghreb. and is very popular among the Tuareg people of Algeria, Libya, Niger and Mali. The serving can take a ceremonial form, especially when prepared for a guest. The tea is traditionally made by the head male in the family and offered to guests as a sign of hospitality. Typically, at least three glasses of tea are served. The tea is consumed throughout the day as a social activity. The native spearmint &quot;naʿnāʿ&quot; () possesses a clear, pungent, mild aroma, and is the mint that is traditionally used in Maghrebi mint tea. Other hybrids and cultivars of spearmint, including &quot;yerba buena&quot;, are occasionally used as substitutes for nana mint. In Morocco, mint tea is sometimes perfumed with herbs, flowers, or orange blossom water. In the cold season, they add many warming herbs like pennyroyal mint and wormwood. Mint has been used as an infusion, decoction, and herbal medicine throughout the Mediterranean since antiquity. This aromatic plant was widely used in Algeria to cure and prevent cholera when it plagued the country from 1835 until 1865.

== Name ==
In Mauritania, Morocco and Algeria, the word for tea is &quot;tay&quot;, &quot;atay&quot; or &quot;lātāy&quot;; while in Tunisia it&#x27;s &quot;et-tey&quot;. These diverge from the typical Arabic word for tea, (). According to Van Driem, &quot;ʾit-tāī&quot; originates from the Dutch language .

==History==
Gunpowder tea was introduced into North Africa by the British in the 18th and 19th centuries via Morocco and Algeria. 

According to food historian, Helen Saberi, the drinking of green tea infused with mint spread from Morocco to Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and to nomadic tribes of Berbers and Tuareg in the Sahara.

Sugar and tea would arrive from Europe to the port of Essaouira, where Jewish merchants who had started migrating to coastal cities in the 19th century managed their passing through the interior of Morocco. James Richardson recorded a description of a Moroccan tea ceremony in the 1840s, and said that during his travels tea was drunk widely and all day long. 

Tea consumption became associated with power and prestige in Morocco, and , officer of Sultan Suleiman (r. 1792–1822), became the first &quot;mūl atay&quot; ( &quot;master of tea&quot;) in the Makhzen. In the twenty years after the Anglo-Moroccan Treaty of 1856, and after the British East India Company diverted tea meant for the Baltic states to Morocco during the Crimean War, tea imports quadrupled but tea consumption remained an urban practice. Among urban populations, partaking in the tea ceremony became a symbol of status and , while among rural farmers it was a way to emulate the urban class they both envied and resented. Tea consumption spread through wider segments of the population as a result of the famines of the 1880s, when it became an emergency calorie substitute, appetite suppressant, and mode of performing acculturation for rural populations flooding the cities in search of opportunities.

Another factor in the spread of &quot;atay&quot; consumption in Morocco was the comparative scarcity of coffee. Whereas Algerian cities had been introduced to coffee culture under the influence of the Ottomans, Moroccan cities would only be introduced to coffee later. Oral traditions in the Algerian city of Tlemcen distinguish between &quot;Fassi tea drinkers and Tlemceni coffee drinkers&quot;.

In the late 19th century, Sufi orders led by figures such as Muhammad Bin Abdul-Kabir Al-Kattani told their adherents not to drink tea, attempting to boycott sugar and tea imported by Europeans.

By the early 20th century, mint tea had become well established in Morocco.

==Preparation==
The basic ingredients of the tea are green tea, fresh mint leaves, sugar, and boiling water. The proportions of the ingredients and the brewing time can vary widely. Boiling water is used in the Maghreb, rather than the cooler water that is used in East Asia to avoid bitterness. The leaves are left in the pot while the tea is consumed, changing the flavor from one glass to the next. It is poured into glasses from high above to swirl loose tea leaves to the bottom of the glass, whilst gently aerating the tea to improve its flavor.

In the winter, if mint is rare, sometimes leaves of tree wormwood ( &quot;shība&quot; in Moroccan Arabic) are substituted for (or used to complement) the mint, giving the tea a distinctly bitter flavor. Lemon verbena ( &quot;lwiza&quot; in Moroccan Arabic) is also used to give it a lemon flavor. Other herbs used to flavor the tea include oregano, sage, and thyme. The tea is sometimes sold as a ready-to-cook mixture of tea and dried mint, which is easier to store and to prepare but has diminished flavor. 

==Culture==
Traditionally, the tea is served three times. The amount of time it has been steeping gives each of the glasses of tea a unique flavor, described in this famous Maghrebi proverb:
In one of Nass El Ghiwane&#x27;s most popular songs, &quot;Es-Siniya&quot; (), the tea tray is used as a metaphor to discuss the hardships of migrating from the countryside to a big city such as Casablanca.

<text>Tshe (or ) (Ћ ћ; italics: &quot;Ћ ћ&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script, used only in the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, where it represents the voiceless alveolo-palatal affricate , somewhat like the pronunciation of in &quot;chew&quot;; however, it must not be confused with the voiceless retroflex affricate Che (Ч ч), which represents and which also exists in Serbian Cyrillic script. The sound of Tshe is produced from the voiceless alveolar plosive by iotation. Tshe is the 23rd letter in the Serbian alphabet. It was first used by Dositej Obradović as a revival of the old Cyrillic letter Djerv (Ꙉ), and was later adopted in the 1818 Serbian dictionary of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić. The equivalent character to Tshe in Gaj&#x27;s Latin alphabet is Ć.

Despite being a Cyrillic letter, Tshe was also used in Latin-based Slovincian phonetic transcriptions with the same value as in Serbian.

Being part of the most common Serbian last names, the transliteration of Tshe to the Latin alphabet is very important; however, there are many ways to transliterate it. It is typically transliterated as , as per the Serbo-Croatian Latin alphabet or, without the diacritic, as ; less frequent transliterations are , , , , , (also used for Che), and , (the last one in Hungarian only, but and are more common). It looks similar to the Shha (Һ һ) but stroked.

As it is one of the letters unique to the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, and also the first letter of the Serbian word for Cyrillic (), Tshe is often used as the basis for logos for various groups involved with the Cyrillic alphabet.

== Other uses ==
The capital Tshe has seen uses in the English language as a symbol for the definite article &quot;The&quot;—similarly to the Ampersand &amp; At sign—due to it appearing as a ligature of the Latin script letters &quot;uppercase T&quot; &amp; &quot;lowercase H&quot;—which are the first 2 letters of the English word &quot;The.&quot; However, unlike common symbols such as the ampersand &amp; at sign, the use of the capital Tshe as a symbol in English is not widely known or recognized.

<text>Fort Boyard () is a fort located between the Île-d&#x27;Aix and the Île d&#x27;Oléron in the Pertuis d&#x27;Antioche straits, on the west coast of France. Though a fort on Boyard bank was suggested as early as the 17th century, it was not until the 1800s under Napoleon Bonaparte that work began. Building started in 1801 and was completed in 1857. In 1967, the final scene of the French film &quot;Les aventuriers&quot; was filmed at the remains of the fort. Since 1990, it is the filming location for the eponymous TV game show. 

==Layout== 

Fort Boyard is stadium-shaped, long and wide. The walls were built high. At the centre is a yard, and the ground floor provided stores and quarters for the men and officers. The floor above contained casemates for the emplacements of guns and further quarters. Above that were facilities for barbette guns and mortars.

==History==
The construction of the fort was first considered during a build-up of the French armed forces undertaken by Louis XIV between 1661 and 1667. Fort Boyard was to form a line of fortification with Fort Enet and Fort de la Rade on Île-d&#x27;Aix to protect the arsenal of Rochefort from Royal Navy incursions. With the limited range of artillery in the 17th century, there was an unprotected gap between the fields of fire of the fortifications on the islands of Aix and Oléron; a fort on Boyard bank, roughly midway between the two, would have filled that gap. In 1692 the French engineer Descombs began planning the programme of building the fort; however, once it became clear how expensive it would be the scheme was abandoned. Vauban, Louis XIV&#x27;s leading military engineer, famously advised against it, saying &quot;Your Majesty, it would be easier to seize the moon with your teeth than to attempt such an undertaking in such a place&quot;.

After a British raid on Île-d&#x27;Aix in 1757, plans for a fort on Boyard bank were once again considered. Though plans were drawn up, it was abandoned again due to the logistical problems. Efforts were renewed under Napoleon Bonaparte in 1800, and the following year engineers Ferregeau and Armand Samuel de Marescot, and Vice-Admiral François Étienne de Rosily-Mesros designed a fort to be built on the bank. To facilitate the work, a port was established on île d&#x27;Oléron. The village of Boyardville was built for the workers. The first stage of construction was to establish a plateau, some , to act as foundation. To this end, stones were piled up on the bank.

The project was suspended in 1809. Construction resumed in 1837, under Louis-Philippe, following renewed tensions with the United Kingdom. The fortifications were completed in 1857, with sufficient room for a garrison of 250 men; however, by this time the range of cannons had significantly increased, covering the hitherto unprotected gap and making the fort unnecessary.

After 1871, Fort Boyard was briefly used as a military prison, and abandoned in 1913, after which the unmaintained fort slowly deteriorated and crumbled into the sea. In 1950 it was made a listed building, and in 1961 was sold to Charente Maritime Regional Council.

In 1989, the reconstruction of fort began in preparation for hosting the game show. An access platform for the berth of ships was built 25 meters from it (the old fort pier was destroyed long ago). The fort was completely cleared of a huge layer of guano (50 cm thick). In 1996, artillery platforms were also restored. However, the fort was still exposed to harmful influences from the sea. Therefore, in 1998, additional restoration work was carried out. The outer walls were completely cleaned and the sealing of the terrace completed. The final stage was the restoration of a central courtyard which was completed in early 2004. It has been used as the location for the filming of both the French and international versions of the TV game show of the same name since 1990, and was also the location for filming &quot;The Last Adventure&quot;, starring Alain Delon, Lino Ventura and Joanna Shimkus.

<text>Luis Francisco Rodríguez Olmo (August 11, 1919 – April 28, 2017) was a Puerto Rican Major League Baseball outfielder and right-handed batter. Olmo played in the majors with the Brooklyn Dodgers (1943–45, 1949) and Boston Braves (1950–51).

==Early years==
Olmo was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. He began his professional career in 1938 with the Criollos de Caguas of the Puerto Rican Winter League. In 1939, Olmo signed with the Richmond Colts of the Piedmont League and was assigned to the Tarboro Goobers and later the Wilson Tobs of the Coastal Plain League. The Dodgers acquired Olmo from Richmond in 1942 and assigned him to the Montreal Royals after spring training.

==Professional career==
Brooklyn called Olmo up to the major leagues in July 1943 and he debuted with the Dodgers on July 18, 1943. In 57 games, he batted .303 with four home runs and 37 RBI. He gained regular status in the next season, batting .258 with nine home runs and 85 RBI in 136 games.

On May 18, 1945, Olmo became the second player (Del Bissonette on April 21, 1930, was the first) in Major League history to hit a bases-loaded triple and a bases-loaded home run (grand slam) in the same game. He added a single for good measure, only failing to hit a double to complete the cycle. In that season, he led the league in triples (13) and reached career-high numbers in batting average (.313), home runs (10), RBI (110), doubles (27), stolen bases (15) and games (141).

=== Mexican League ===
Despite his strong 1945 season, the return of players from World War II service meant stiff competition for the Dodgers&#x27; outfield. Olmo was offered a $6,000 salary for 1946, far from his expectations of a $10,000 contract. Instead, he chose to sign with the Rojos del México in the Mexican League, after owner Jorge Pasquel offered him a $20,000 salary; he was later traded to the Azules de Veracruz (also owned by Pasquel). In 59 games with Mexico and Veracruz in the 1946 season, Olmo hit .289 and drove in 42 runs.

Olmo, along with the other so-called &quot;jumpers&quot; who defected to the Mexican League, were suspended for five years by Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler; some historians suggest that the departure of a relatively-high-profile player like Olmo was the catalyst for Chandler&#x27;s crackdown. Along with fellow &quot;jumper&quot; and former Dodger Mickey Owen, Olmo applied for reinstatement in 1946 but was denied. Instead, he played the 1947 season with Veracruz, hitting .301 in 102 games.

By 1949, Olmo was reinstated and he returned to the Dodgers, batting .305 in to help win the pennant.

=== Return to the majors ===
In the 1949 World Series against the Yankees, Olmo became the first Puerto Rican to play in a World Series, as well as hit a home run and get three hits in a Series game. After two seasons, he was dealt to the Braves. He retired at the end of the 1951 season.

In a six-year career, Olmo batted .281 (458-for-1629) with 29 home runs, 208 runs, 65 doubles, 25 triples, and 33 stolen bases in 462 games.

=== Caribbean Series ===
Olmo earned Caribbean Series MVP honors, during the 1951 edition played in Caracas, after batting .416 and three homers, while powering the Cangrejeros de Santurce to the championship.

Olmo returned to the Series with Santurce in its 1955 title, and also played as a reinforcement for fourth-place Senadores de San Juan in 1952. Overall, Olmo posted a .303 average with three home runs and 13 RBI in three Caribbean Series.

== Later years ==
Olmo was elected to the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame on February 6, 2004. His baseball career was featured in a 2008 American documentary titled &quot;Beisbol&quot;, directed by Alan Swyer and narrated by Esai Morales, which covered the early influences and contributions of Hispanics in the game. The City of Arecibo honored Olmo by naming a stadium after him.

Olmo had been suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease for more than a year. Olmo, who suffered from the complications of double pneumonia, died on April 28, 2017, in Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico.

<text>Sir Dietrich Brandis (31 March 1824 – 28 May 1907) was a German-British botanist and forestry academic and administrator, who worked with the British Imperial Forestry Service in colonial India for nearly 30 years. He joined the British civil service in Burma in 1856, shortly afterwards became head of the British forestry administration in all of Burma, and served as Inspector General of Forests in India from 1864 to 1883. He returned to Europe in 1883, dividing his time between Bonn and Greater London. In retirement he dedicated himself to scholarly work, resulting in the book &quot;Indian Trees&quot; (1906), his &quot;magnum opus&quot;. Brandis is considered the father of tropical forestry and has also been described as the father of scientific forestry. In addition to his work in India, he also had a significant influence on forest management in the United States.

== Early life, education and family ==
A member of the patrician Brandis family, Dietrich Brandis was born in Bonn, Germany, and was the son of the prominent philosopher Christian August Brandis, who was tutor to the young King Otho of Greece and Professor of Philosophy at the University of Bonn. His grandfather Joachim Dietrich Brandis was personal physician to Queen Marie of Denmark and Norway and a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters.

He studied at the universities of Copenhagen Biology, Göttingen Botany and Bonn Biology major and minor Geography and Antiquites, and in 1849, he took up a post as a lecturer in botany at Bonn. His interest in forest management was initially from a botanical perspective.

In 1854, he married Rachel Marshman, a daughter of the Indian scholar and missionary Joshua Marshman and a sister of the wife of General Havelock. His brother-in-law Havelock was a friend of Lord Dalhousie, the Governor-General of India, and it was this connection that brought him to Burma and eventually India. His first wife died in India in 1862, and during a two-year sabbatical in Europe from 1865 to 1867, he met and married Katharina Hasse, eighteen years his junior. She moved to India with him and the couple had six children, some of whom did not reach adulthood.

Dietrich Brandis was the father of supreme court justice Bernhard Brandis and the grandfather of the microbiologist Henning Brandis.

== Forestry administrator in British India ==
Among other natural resources, the British government in India was interested in the use of forest produce. The felling of trees was unregulated, and between 1847 and 1850 the British government started to realize that the forests in India were being lost. In 1850, the British Association in Edinburgh formed a committee to study forest destruction at the behest of Hugh Cleghorn. In 1855, Lord Dalhousie, the Governor-General of India issued a Memorandum of the Government of India. This was based on reports submitted by John McClelland, then Superintendent of Forests in Burma, at the time part of the British India.

=== Burma ===

Brandis joined the British civil service in 1856 as superintendent of the teak forests of Pegu division in eastern Burma. In 1858 he became head of the imperial forest administration of all of British Burma.

During that time Burma&#x27;s teak forests were controlled by militant Karen tribals. He introduced the &quot;taungya&quot; system, in which Karen villagers provided labour for clearing, planting and weeding teak plantations. In return, they were allowed to plant crops for the first few years between the trees. As the teak trees grew, villagers were moved to new land and the process was repeated. As a result of this process, many villagers became dependent on the state forestry service and local resistance to the state takeover of forests became increasingly difficult.

Based on his academic training, Brandis was initially interested in botany. His herbarium and botanical library, which he shipped from Calcutta to Rangoon, were lost when the boat carrying it capsized. This loss led him to shift his focus from botanical studies to forestry.

Brandis&#x27; work included the determination of teak volume, rate of growth, identifying rate of harvest, developing forest protection plans against pests and fire. He also introduced timber purchase rules, clearing rules and the establishment of managed teak areas called &quot;conservancies&quot; with officers who were appointed as &quot;Conservators&quot;. Based on his experience, he helped formulate the &quot;Indian Forest Act of 1865&quot;.

== Contribution to forestry management in India ==

In 1864 Brandis became Inspector General of Forests in India, a position he served in for 20 years. He formulated new forest legislation and helped establish research and training institutions. The Imperial Forest School at Dehradun was founded by him. Brandis was created a Companion of the Indian Empire in 1878, and he became a Knight Commander of the same order in 1887.

Brandis documented the sacred groves in Rajputana and &quot;Kans&quot; (woodlands) of Mysore, the Garo and Khasia hills, which he visited in 1879, the &quot;Devarakadus&quot; of Coorg in 1868, the hill ranges of the Salem district in the Madras Presidency in 1882, the &quot;Swami Shola&quot; on the Yelagiris, the sacred grove at Pudur on the Javadis and several sacred forests on the Shevaroys. He was among the earliest in India to formally link forest protection with local peoples.

He also took an interest in the forest flora of northwest and central India and of Indian trees in general. Even after retirement, Brandis continued to work on Indian forestry and, at the age of 75, he started his principal botanical work, &quot;Indian Trees&quot;, dealing with 4400 species. It was first published in 1906 and re-issued several times afterwards, the last time in 1971. He was posted at Balaghat in M.P. as a principal of forester training institute for a long time in his service period.

== Retirement ==
After his retirement from the position as Inspector General of Forests in India in 1883, he returned to Bonn, but frequently visited England in the following years. From 1900 until 1906 he lived permanently in Kew in Greater London. He also supervised training of forestry students at the Royal Indian Engineering College in England for eight years (1888–1896). His interest in American affairs led him to take special care of American foresters visiting Europe, for which he received a personal letter of thanks by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1904. He was succeeded as Inspector General of Forests by Lt Col Frederick Bailey of the Royal Engineers.

Shortly after returning to Bonn in late 1906, he was hospitalized and died a few months later on 28 May 1907.

== Broader influence ==
Brandis was also involved in forestry education in England at Coopers&#x27; Hill. He also influenced and mentored many like Berthold Ribbentrop, W. Schlich and C.A. Schenck of Germany (while a visiting professor at the University of Giessen), and Gifford Pinchot and Henry Graves (the first and second chiefs of the USDA Forest Service) of the United States.

He influenced the forestry movement in the United States by mentoring Pinchot, Graves, and others who came to study with him in Germany, and through his voluminous correspondence with many other men, such as Charles Sprague Sargent and Franklin Hough involved in establishing the U.S. national forest system. Pinchot relied heavily upon Brandis&#x27; advice for introducing professional forest management in the U.S. and on how to structure the Forest Service in 1905. His influence was so great that President Roosevelt sent him a photograph in 1896 with the inscription

<text>Rally Finland (formerly known as the Neste Rally Finland, Neste Oil Rally Finland, 1000 Lakes Rally and Rally of the Thousand Lakes; , ) is a rally competition in the Finnish Lakeland in Central Finland. The rally is driven on wide and smooth gravel roads, featuring blind crests and big jumps. It is the fastest event in the World Rally Championship and has been dubbed the &quot;Grand Prix of Rallying&quot; and the &quot;Grand Prix on Gravel&quot;. Rally Finland is among the largest annually organised public events in the Nordic countries, attracting hundreds of thousands of spectators each year. The rally has been known to be very difficult for non-Nordic drivers; only seven drivers from countries other than Finland or Sweden have won the event- in the 1980s and before, the field was made up almost entirely of Finnish and Swedish drivers.

The city of Jyväskylä in the Central Finland region has often served as the main venue for Finnish rally competitions, because Rally Finland was first held under the name Jyväskylän Suurajot (Jyväskylä Grand Prix) in 1951. Originally an endurance event that stretched to Lapland in Northern Finland, the rally was at the forefront of the adoption of the modern rally format, splitting the route into a number of special stages in the mid-1950s. With increasing international attention, it became part of the European Rally Championship programme in 1959. After the start of the World Rally Championship in 1973, the event became the Finnish round in the series. Rally Finland is now among the most popular and prestigious rallies in the championship.

==History==
This rally began to gain importance in the 1970s, and local heroes such as Hannu Mikkola, Markku Alén, Timo Salonen, Tommi Mäkinen and Marcus Grönholm are the most successful names at this rally, and Swedish drivers such as Stig Blomqvist also found success at this rally. The difficulty of this rally for non-Nordic drivers made notable competitors such as Walter Röhrl (who never competed at this rally) and Miki Biasion (who only competed at this rally twice in his 15-year career) make rare or no appearances at this rally.

===1950s===

Rally Finland was started as a quickly improvised qualifier event for the Monte Carlo Rally; thirty Finnish drivers wanted to take part in Monte Carlo, but only 14 fit within the quotas on Finns and Swedes. Previously, the entries had been decided in the Hanko Run in Southern Finland. The regulations in this race were not close to those of the Monte Carlo Rally, leading to a demand for a Monte Carlo type of rally in Finland. In July 1951, Pentti Barck&#x27;s proposal for an annual competition in Jyväskylä was accepted. The first-ever rally began on 1 September 1951 as Jyväskylän Suurajot (Jyväskylä Grand Prix). 26 entrants tackled the 1,700 kilometre (1,060 mi) route that stretched to Rovaniemi in Lapland, through Kokkola and Oulu, and back to the rally headquarters in Jyväskylä. The winner Arvo Karlsson, driving an Austin Atlantic, had accumulated the least penalty points and had been the closest to the target times throughout the route and the special tests involving hillclimbing and acceleration.
The 1952 event included Helsinki as an alternative starting point and the field expanded to 48 entries. Eino Elo was the only driver to finish the route and the acceleration and braking tests without penalty points. In 1953, Oulu was added as a third starting point, and 66 crews started the 2,200 kilometre course in two-minute intervals. The 1954 running of the rally saw the introduction of the international name &quot;The Rally of the Thousand Lakes&quot;. There were now eleven starting cities, one of which was Sundsvall in neighbouring Sweden. In 1955, the event became increasingly closer to the format of a modern rally competition; the number of special stages was increased to eleven, marking the highest amount in any European rally. Elo and Peugeot became the first two-time winners of the event. The 1956 rally featured 19 stages totaling .

In 1957, the rally had a record number of entries from foreign countries and the organisers developed a sign language that marshals could use to communicate with drivers. The event also started the Finland-Sweden international in rallying, comparable to the traditional Finland-Sweden athletics international. Sweden&#x27;s Erik Carlsson drove his Saab 93 to victory as the first non-Finn. In the 1958 1000 Lakes, documented by a 20th Century Fox film crew, seven drivers crashed out on the same curve on a foggy night. Brothers Osmo and Eino Kalpala took a record third win in an Alfa Romeo Giulietta TI, which marked the first victory for an Italian car. In 1959, the 1000 Lakes Rally was included in the European Rally Championship calendar. It was also one of the four rallies that counted towards the first-ever Finnish Rally Championship.

===1960s===

At the 1960 1000 Lakes Rally, nearly half of the 85 entries were from foreign countries. A deaf-mute road worker was hit by Germany&#x27;s future European champion Eugen Böhringer in what was the event&#x27;s first fatal accident. Although the rally ended with Finland&#x27;s Carl-Otto Bremer leading home a Saab triple win, the best Finn had been only tenth after the opening Harju hill stage. Later in the 1960s, the 1000 Lakes was dominated by the first generation of &quot;Flying Finns&quot; of rallying. Rauno Aaltonen beat Pauli Toivonen to the win in 1961, while Toivonen took the honours in 1962. Esko Keinänen and Rainer Eklund finished second in a Škoda Felicia. A record 104 drivers started the 1962 event. Simo Lampinen, barely twenty years old, became the first driver to take consecutive wins, finishing ahead of Sweden&#x27;s Tom Trana in 1963 and 1964.
Interest in the 1000 Lakes Rally continued to grow. It became known as the best organised rally competition after the Monte Carlo Rally, and as Finland&#x27;s biggest sporting event by audience count. As practice had been allowed for 1965, speeds became higher than ever. These factors brought several challenges to the organisers. Spectators lined up the edge of the course and sometimes even blocked the road. One spectator was killed in a crash in 1965. 1,200 officials were appointed for the 1965 event, over 2,000 for 1967 and over 3,000 for 1968. As the organisers and the gravel roads could not handle fields close to 200 cars, only 130 of the 173 entries qualified for the start in 1965. In 1966, entries were only accepted from drivers who had finished in at least three rallies.

Along with the number of entrants, the percentage of retirements grew steadily throughout the decade, and 1966 saw nearly half of the 115 drivers fail to finish the 26 stages. Timo Mäkinen, who had already won in Monte Carlo, drove his Mini Cooper S to victory in 1965 and continued the success in 1966. In 1967, he beat Lampinen to the win by eight seconds despite driving the high-speed Ouninpohja stage with his bonnet open. His hat-trick of wins was followed by Hannu Mikkola&#x27;s successes in a Ford Escort TC. In 1968, Castrol produced a film titled &quot;Flying Finns&quot;, documenting the duel between Mäkinen and Mikkola. The 1969 rally saw the circuit and street stages, which favoured faster sports cars and factory team drivers, dropped from the programme.

===1970s===

The 1970 1000 Lakes had a record 52 stages, which totaled 460 competitive kilometres. An estimated audience of 350,000–500,000 spectators watched Mikkola match Mäkinen&#x27;s feat of three wins in a row. However, the event suffered a drop in the number of foreign entries, which the international press attributed to the difficulty of defeating the Finns on their own roads. In 1971, the rally was won by a Swedish driver for the third time; Stig Blomqvist finished well ahead of Tapio Rainio and Markku Alén. The 1972 event increased the length of special stages to almost 700 km. The traditional Harju hill stage was left out of the route as Jyväskylä had banned racing in the city area.
The 1000 Lakes was not among the five European rallies guaranteed a spot in the inaugural World Rally Championship calendar. It competed for the remaining three Europe-based entries with the Coupe des Alpes (Alpine Rally), Österreichische Alpenfahrt (Austrian Alpine Rally), Rally Poland and Rallye de Portugal. The number of rallies in the 1973 season was eventually expanded to 13 and only Coupe des Alpes was dropped. The 1973 1000 Lakes Rally ended with Ford&#x27;s Timo Mäkinen becoming the first driver to win the event four times, and the first Finn to win a WRC round. Alén finished second in a Volvo and future Formula One driver Leo Kinnunen third in a Porsche. The world championship status had brought back a strong international field of about 50 teams from 13 different countries. The 1974 event was marred by the first fatal accident for a competitor in the World Rally Championship, after co-driver Seppo Jämsä died of injuries sustained in a crash in Ouninpohja.

The rally route became a secret again in 1975, and pre-event practice was heavily limited. Mikkola drove to a record fifth victory and Toyota became the first Japanese manufacturer to win the event. The 1977 and 1978 rallies were, in addition to the WRC, part of the FIA Cup for Rally Drivers, the predecessor to the drivers&#x27; world championship. In 1978, the course stretched to Kuopio and as a result 25 of the 45 special stages were new. The 1979 1000 Lakes raised the highest number of accepted entries to 150, and all 134 competitors could start the rally. World championship points were now awarded for drivers as well as for manufacturers. Fiat&#x27;s Alén collected most by taking his third win in the event, ahead of Ari Vatanen and eventual champion Björn Waldegård.

===1980s===

For the 1980 season, the 1000 Lakes Rally lost its status as a world championship event for manufacturers, running for the first and last time only as a world drivers&#x27; championship event. The rally saw the return of the short Harju asphalt stage held in the center of Jyväskylä. Although the rally became the first in the world to issue action and safety instructions in 1980, several serious accidents marred the event in the early 1980s. At the 1981 rally, Austrian driver Franz Wittmann lost control of his Audi Quattro after the finish line of the fourth stage and crashed into five end-of-stage officials. Raul Falin, the chairman of AKK-Motorsport, died of his injuries soon after reaching the hospital. In 1983, Pekka Mällinen slid off the road on a fast curve, rolled twice and crashed into a thick pine tree. The accident killed his co-driver Reijo Nygren. At the 1984 rally, British driver Julian Roderick lost control of his car on a popular spectator area in the Humalamäki jumpers. He rolled his car several times and hit a wall of people who had been spectating in a forbidden area. Along with Roderick and his co-driver, nine spectators suffered non-critical injuries.
Although the 1000 Lakes continued to be dominated by Nordic drivers, David Richards became the third British co-driver to celebrate the win in 1981. In 1982, the pre-rally scrutineering was moved to the newly built Jyväskylän jäähalli (Jyväskylä Ice Hall). All over 150 contestants passed the inspection. King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden arrived to follow the event and a record 450 reporters were present. Dominant Audi took a one-two with its factory drivers Hannu Mikkola and Stig Blomqvist, with team orders keeping them in their positions for the last half of the race. The 1983 rally featured a field of 180 cars, over a hundred of which failed to make it to the finish. Mikkola edged out Blomqvist to extend the event record to a still-standing seven wins. Mikkola&#x27;s time on the Ouninpohja stage was 11:56; 52 seconds faster than his time just four years ago. In 1984, over half a million spectators were expected and about 5,000 marshals were appointed. Vatanen won the event and Peugeot continued their success in the last two Group B years, as Timo Salonen drove to victory in 1985 and 1986.

The 1985 event marked the first time the drivers&#x27; world championship had been decided in Finland; Salonen captured the title with three rallies to go. In 1986, the route was modified to bring the average speeds closer to the FISA limit of 110 km/h. The top drivers exceeded the limit almost regularly, but FISA had given the organisers a 10 percent flexibility. Combined with their dislike for the slower Group A cars, drivers were highly critical of the organisers for artificially slowing the rally in 1987. A record 214 drivers signed up for the 1988 event and 200 were qualified to start by the organisers. Albert II, Prince of Monaco arrived to follow the event and was scheduled to drive a few stages in an ex-Alén Lancia. In one of the tightest duels in the event&#x27;s history, Toyota&#x27;s Juha Kankkunen led Lancia&#x27;s Markku Alén by just two seconds after 33 of the 39 stages. Kankkunen&#x27;s engine failed on the next stage, and Alén became the first driver to win the same WRC round six times. As a taste of what was to come, only two Finnish drivers made it into top ten. In 1989, Mikael Ericsson of Sweden drove to victory as the first non-Finn in 18 years.

===1990s===

The 40th anniversary event in 1990 featured a route stretching to Tampere and gathered a large audience, roughly estimated at 450,000–500,000. Toyota&#x27;s Spanish driver Carlos Sainz became the first competitor outside Finland and Sweden to win the rally. He had been slightly injured earlier during the week, when he crashed during a night-time practice run in the Vesala stage. Sainz&#x27;s feat was soon repeated; Didier Auriol, who had become the first Frenchman on the podium in his debut in 1988, beat his Lancia teammate Kankkunen to the win in 1992. Kankkunen took his second win in three years in 1993. In 1994, the rally was renamed to Neste 1000 Lakes Rally as Neste became the title sponsor. A new super special stage was built at a slope of the Himos ski centre in Jämsä and it quickly proved popular among spectators.
Due to the WRC round rotation from 1994 to 1996, the 1995 Rally Finland was only part of the 2-litre World Cup (better known as Formula 2). As a result, audience numbers dropped. The event was also overshadowed by a fatal accident. During the rainy and windy Hassi stage, a 20-year-old spectator did not hear the zero car driven by Bruno Thiry coming. Although Thiry was able to dodge into a ditch, his car bounced back on the road and hit the woman at . She flew down the road and succumbed to her injuries within minutes. Next year in Harju, Danish driver Karsten Richardt carried far too much speed into a right-hander. After hitting a bump and getting airborne, he missed the curve and went straight, hitting a road sign and a concrete barrier. Uncontrollably airborne, his car eventually plunged into the crowd off the course. 29 spectators were brought to the hospital. 45-year-old Belgian tourist Ludo Briers was operated on within 38 minutes, but his injuries soon proved fatal. Before being hit, Briers had pushed one spectator to safety and protected another with his body. In a subdued celebration, drivers from Central Finland manned the podium; Tommi Mäkinen took his third win in a row, ahead of Kankkunen and Jarmo Kytölehto.

In 1997, AKK Sports, the marketing company of AKK-Motorsport, took over as the organiser and the WRC teams awarded the event for its safety efforts. A new super special stage was built at Hippos, along with a VIP village for 1,600 people. In the following year, teams voted the event as the Rally of the Year. On his way to a record third consecutive title, Mäkinen set a record with his fifth Rally Finland win in a row. Entry lists included ice hockey star and auto racing enthusiast Teemu Selänne, who finished 33rd in 1997 and 24th in 1998. The event also attracted environmental criticism throughout the decade; protests gathered about a hundred participants in 1997 and two hundred in 1998. In a 1997 study by the University of Jyväskylä, partly funded by AKK, Jyväskylä and Rally Finland, the environmental impact was estimated to be small; the noise from the rally cars, helicopters and speakers was considered the biggest harm. In 1999, Harju was dropped from the route and extra points were awarded to the three fastest drivers of the Ruuhimäki stage, which was televised live by Yle to millions around the world.

===2000s===
After years of rumours of the rally moving from Jyväskylä to Southern Finland for better accommodations, Tampere announced its intention to host the event after 1999. Jyväskylä retained the event but the headquarters were relocated to the large newly built Paviljonki congress and trade fair centre. Previously, Laajavuori had served as the competition centre for 30 years. The Hippos super special was dropped in favour of a similar stage at the Killeri harness racing track by the lake Killerjärvi, where the audience had better visibility of the competing cars. The 50th running of the Rally Finland in 2000 was won by Peugeot&#x27;s Marcus Grönholm, who would go on to dominate the event. In 2002, Englishman Richard Burns challenged teammate Grönholm to become the third non-Nordic competitor to win the rally, but broke his car on a jump in Ouninpohja while leading the event. The next foreign winner was Ford&#x27;s Estonian driver Markko Märtin in the following year. For the first time in the history of the event, no Finnish driver made it onto the podium.
Rally Finland was chosen the &quot;Rally of the Year&quot; for the third year in a row in 2004. Despite Lahti entering the race, a unanimous decision was made to keep Jyväskylä as the rally headquarters. In 2005, Grönholm set the still-standing record for the highest average speed in a world rally; . In the 2007 Rally Finland, Grönholm equalled Mikkola&#x27;s win record and became the first driver to win the same WRC event seven times. At the 2008 rally, Sébastien Loeb added his name to the list of non-Nordic winners. This also marked Citroën&#x27;s first win since 1962.

As the World Rally Championship reintroduced round rotation in 2009, Rally Finland signed a five-year contract with WRC promoter International Sportsworld Communicators (ISC), insuring that the event stays in the calendar annually. The 2010 event saw a major change; the rally was run in two days instead of three and finished on Saturday. Ford&#x27;s Finns Mikko Hirvonen and Jari-Matti Latvala took their debut home wins in 2009 and 2010, respectively. At the 2011 Rally Finland, Loeb made history by becoming the first non-Finn to win the event twice. The event expanded to Lahti in the south and brought classic rally cars to the route, as some of the stages were also part of the Lahti Historic Rally.

==Characteristics==
===Geographic features===
Rally Finland is known for its smooth and wide gravel roads, numerous big jumps (or &quot;yumps&quot;) and blind crests.

It is the highest-speed rally in the World Rally Championship, having averaged 125.4 km/h in 2015. Of the nine fastest-ever WRC rallies by average speed, eight are editions of the Rally Finland. As a result, it has become known as the &quot;Grand Prix of rallying&quot;, &quot;Finnish Grand Prix&quot; and &quot;Gravel Grand Prix&quot;.

The high number of jumps led to the nickname &quot;The Rally of the Thousand Jumps&quot;. Formula One world champion Kimi Räikkönen said that the event &quot;is probably the closest to asphalt driving as you can get on gravel.&quot; According to &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, the roads are considered the best in the world championship. As the high-speed corners are often surrounded by trees, carefully crafted pacenotes and correct racing lines are necessary to survive the event; small errors easily lead to big crashes.

===Popularity===
Although Rally Finland has traditionally been a difficult event for non-Nordic competitors, it is popular among drivers as well as fans. The rally attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators each year, and only Monte Carlo Rally and Wales Rally GB have ever attracted more starters. Along with the Wales Rally GB, it is the only event to have featured in all but one WRC season. The WRC teams voted Rally Finland the &quot;Rally of the Year&quot; in 1998, 2002, 2003 and 2004. The official website of the World Rally Championship lists the event as one of the &quot;undoubted highlights&quot; of a season.

===Ouninpohja stage===
The most famous competitive section of the rally is Ouninpohja. Well known for its high-speed jumps and sweeping corners, it ranks among the most prestigious special stages in the world. At one jump located from the start line, close to a landmark yellow house, spectators measure the length of the jumps and mark the distance by the roadside. In 2003, Markko Märtin set the record for the longest jump, travelling in the air at a speed of .

The Ouninpohja stage was split into two parts for the 2005 and 2006 events, as Petter Solberg had exceeded the FIA&#x27;s maximum average speed (130 km/h) in 2004. The rule was changed for 2007 and Ouninpohja returned as a version, although the organisers added three chicanes. However, the stage was left out of the route in 2008. Jarmo Mahonen, managing director of AKK Sports, stated that &quot;the matter was discussed with the FIA already last year, and at the time we were able to keep Ouninpohja as a part of our route. This year we have to leave it out for safety reasons.&quot; In 2012, the Ouninpohja stage returned and also served as the power stage. The stage ranges from 97 m to a maximum of 180 m in elevation.

<doc id="881373" wikidata="Q5454147" url="?curid=881373" title="First class (computing)">
<text>In database modeling, a first class item is one that has an identity independent of any other item. The identity allows the item to persist when its attributes change, and allows other items to claim relationships with the item.

As a general rule, first class items represent things rather than relationships. For example, the database representations of a human and of a company are each first class items. However, the fact that the person is an employee of that company is not a first class item. Likewise, data &quot;about&quot; that relationship, e.g. information about the salary the company pays to its employee, is not a first class item.

Typically, a relational database will include several tables, each of which contains rows representing first class items of a given type (e.g. a table of people, a table of companies). It will also contain other tables representing relationships between these first class items. 

In a table representing first class items, one column of the table will typically contain a different integer assigned to each row (effectively, to each item) as a unique identifier: that is to say, unique for objects of this type; objects of different types, represented in different tables, can coincidentally have the same identifier, but the coincidence is meaningless.

In a relational database, a table representing a &quot;relationship&quot; between two or more first class items (or data about that relationship) will usually &quot;not&quot; have special identifiers for its rows. Instead these rows will be identified by an ordered tuple consisting of unique identifiers of the first class items involved in the relationship.</text><links>

<doc id="881375" wikidata="Q1525759" url="?curid=881375" title="Kelmscott Manor">
<text>Kelmscott Manor is a limestone manor house in the Cotswolds village of Kelmscott, in West Oxfordshire, southern England. It dates from around 1570, with a late 17th-century wing, and is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England. It is situated close to the River Thames. The nearest town is Lechlade-On-Thames.

==History 1570 to 1870==
The house was built by local farmer Thomas Turner and remained in the family for many generations. After George Turner died in 1734, the house was let out. The house was originally called Lower House, but became Kelmscott Manor when James Turner (d.1870) purchased 53½ acres of manorial land together with the lordship in 1864. After James died the manor passed to his nephew, Charles Hobbs, who let out the property.

==William Morris and family==
Kelmscott Manor was the country home of the writer, designer and socialist William Morris from 1871 until his death in 1896. Today it is owned by the Society of Antiquaries of London, and is open to the public on Thursday, Friday and Saturdays during the summer.

Morris drew great inspiration from the unspoilt authenticity of the house&#x27;s architecture and craftsmanship, and its organic relationship with its setting, especially its garden. The Manor is featured in Morris&#x27; work &quot;News from Nowhere&quot;. It also appears in the background of &quot;Water Willow&quot;, a portrait of his wife, Jane Morris, painted by Dante Gabriel Rossetti in 1871.

After William Morris&#x27;s death in 1896, the Manor continued to be occupied by his widow, Jane Morris (who purchased it in 1913) and later, his daughters. May Morris died in 1938 and bequeathed the house to Oxford University, on the basis the contents were preserved and the public were granted access. The university were unwilling to preserve the house as &#x27;a museum piece&#x27; and passed the house and land to the Society of Antiquaries in 1962.

==21st century==
The manor was in a precarious state of decay when passed to The Society and much of the 1960s work was to make sure that the manor house did not deteriorate further. Most of the main roof beams were rotten which meant that a lot of the structure needed to be replaced. Internal walls and floors were strengthened and a new porch added to the North entrance. The associated barns were purchased by the Society in the 1970s and converted into a shop and tearoom.

The internal décor today is substantially that of Morris, and includes many of his famous textile patterns as well as much of his furniture. Visitors can explore all three floors of the manor, including the attic spaces which would originally have been used by farm labourers. Morris&#x27;s bedroom contains many of his original books, and a collection of Dürer prints. Other rooms display furniture from Red House in Bexleyheath, Kelmscott House in Hammersmith and other family homes. There are also further works by Rossetti, Sir Edward Burne-Jones, and Pieter Brueghel the Younger.

The manor was reopened in April 2022 after a major restoration project undertaken by the Society. The work, funded by grants totalling £6m from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and the &quot;Kelmscott: Past Present and Future&quot; campaign, has seen extensive work undertaken to the structure of the house, as well as renovation of the interior. The manor is a Grade I listed building.

==Garden==
The garden includes many old trees, including a very old black mulberry at the rear of the house. The front garden is walled with a summer house in one corner, and both the wall and the summerhouse are Grade II listed. The front garden contains many standard roses. Although part of the original orchard has been removed to make a small car park, many fruit trees have been left intact.

William Morris named his London residence &quot;Kelmscott House&quot; and the private press that he founded &quot;the Kelmscott Press&quot; after Kelmscott. He was buried in the village churchyard in a tomb designed by his friend and colleague Philip Webb.

<text>María de Guadalupe &quot;Lupita&quot; Jones Garay (, ; born 6 September 1967) is a Mexican actress, model, producer and beauty queen who was crowned Miss Universe 1991. She was the first Mexican contestant to win a major international beauty pageant, though two more Mexican women have been crowned Miss Universe since Jones&#x27; win.

Since 1994, Jones has been the national director of the Mexican division of the Mexicana Universal franchise. To date, she has produced the 59th and 69th Miss Universe titleholders.

Jones was a candidate for the governorship of Baja California in the 2021 Mexican gubernatorial elections.

==Education==
Lupita Jones got her business administration degree before becoming Miss Universe and also did postgraduate studies in industrial administration at the Centro de Enseñanza Técnica y Superior in her native city of Mexicali, Baja California.

==Pageantry==
===Señorita Mexico===
In September 1990, Jones won the title of Señorita México representing the state of Baja California.

===Miss Universe===
On 17 May 1991, Jones competed against 72 contestants for the title of Miss Universe 1991 at Las Vegas, Nevada representing Mexico. She advanced to the semifinals of the event as first place.

Jones was the only contestant with an average score above 9. During the final stage, Jones won every single round of competition: swimsuit, interview, and evening gown. She dominated the next two rounds of competition (the Top 6 judges&#x27; questions and the Top 3 final questions) and won the crown, the prizes, and the Miss Universe title for her country.

==TV producer==
After ending her reign in 1992, she started the company Promocertamen in 1994 with Televisa to produce Nuestra Belleza México, Mexico&#x27;s official pageant responsible for choosing Mexico&#x27;s delegates for Miss Universe, Miss World and Miss International. This new pageant was created when Señorita México was moved to another TV network, TV Azteca.

In 1997, she attempted to launch the first male-only beauty contest, &quot;El Modelo México&quot;, but the show got little attention from the public.

In 2001, for the &quot;Nuestra Belleza México&quot; show, Lupita Jones launched the &quot;Report Her&quot; campaign, which invited the public to report beautiful women in their state. Critics attacked the campaign on discrimination charges. She produced a winner at one of the 3 most well-known beauty pageants on the planet since 1960: Priscila Perales, Miss International 2007 and another one in 2009 with Anagabriela Espinoza, Miss International 2009. In 2010, a Mexican woman was crowned as Miss Universe 2010, Ximena Navarrete. Accordingly, Jones promised she would vacate the direction of &quot;Nuestra Belleza México&quot; once a new Mexican Miss Universe would be entitled, but did not follow through after Navarrete won the title.

From 2008 to 2014, Lupita Jones and longtime pageant director-rival Osmel Sousa were brought together to judge Nuestra Belleza Latina, a beauty pageant-related reality television series created by the US Hispanic network Univision, which searches for young women of Latin American descent across the United States.

In 2015, in response to negative comments on Mexicans by Donald Trump, part-owner of the Miss Universe organization, as head of Nuestra Belleza México, Jones endorsed withdrawal of the 2015 contestant from Mexico and urged a boycott of products associated with the 2015 pageant.

==Humanitarian causes==
In 1999, Lupita Jones decided that the contest would support an important program for ill-treated girls in the country through the Integral Family Development project.

In 2000, Jones accepted an appointment as UNFPA Goodwill Ambassador and Face to Face Campaign Spokesperson for Mexico.

== Political career ==
In 2021, Jones ran as a candidate of the Va por México electoral alliance for governor of Baja California, coming in third place with 13% behind Jorge Hank Rhon of the Encuentro Solidario Party, with 28%, and the winner Marina del Pilar Ávila Olmeda, of the Juntos Hacemos Historia coalition, who won 45% of the votes. Regarding the results, Jones said that she was typecast as a beauty queen and that she was not allowed to prove that she could work in another area.

<text>The black-throated gray warbler or black-throated grey warbler (Setophaga nigrescens) is a passerine bird of the New World warbler family Parulidae. It is long and has gray and white plumage with black markings. The male has the bold black throat of its name, and black stripes on its head, as well as black streaks on its flanks; the female is a paler version of the male, with a white throat and less distinct black markings on the flanks and wings. It breeds in western North America from British Columbia to New Mexico, and winters in Mexico and the southwestern United States. The habitats it prefers are coniferous and mixed forests and scrubland, especially those with pinyon pines, junipers, sagebrush, and oaks. Its nest is an open cup of plant fibers lined with feathers, built a few metres from the ground in the branches of a tree or shrub. Three to five eggs are laid, and young are fed by both parents. Common in its breeding range, it does not seem to be seriously threatened by human activities, unlike many migratory warblers.

== Taxonomy ==
The black-throated gray warbler was first described by John Kirk Townsend from a specimen collected near today&#x27;s Portland, Oregon. It was known to the Chinook inhabitants of the northwest coast, who called it &quot;Ah Kah a qual&quot;. Townsend described the species as &quot;Sylvia nigrescens&quot;, placing it with the other New World warblers and the unrelated Old World warblers in the genus &quot;Sylvia&quot;. It is now placed in the genus &quot;Setophaga&quot; along with about thirty other species, after having been classified in &quot;Dendroica&quot; for some time. Within its genus, it is part of a group with black throats and yellow face markings that includes the hermit warbler and Townsend&#x27;s warbler. It is usually considered an early offshoot among this group of species, but genetic studies suggest a close relation to Grace&#x27;s warbler.

Of these relatives, the range of the black-throated gray warbler overlaps with those of Townsend&#x27;s warbler and the hermit warbler, but they occur in different habitats. While Townsend&#x27;s and hermit warblers commonly hybridize with each other, records of either species hybridizing with the black-throated gray warbler are uncommon.

There are two subspecies, which are highly similar and of dubious validity. The nominate subspecies &quot;S. n. nigrescens&quot; occurs on the Pacific coastal region from British Columbia to northern California, while &quot;S. n. halseii&quot;, described by Giraud in 1841, occupies the inland parts of its range. &quot;S. n. halseii&quot; birds are slightly larger and more gray in their upperparts.

== Description ==

The black-throated gray warbler has mostly black, gray, and white plumage, which is soft, lacking gloss. With its striping and the small yellow spot between its eye and bill, it is a distinctive bird. The sexes differ slightly, both having gray upperparts with black streaks, and white underparts with black streaks on the flanks. The adult male is striped with black on the crown, throat, and below the eye, and has white around its chin and above its eye. The adult female has more dingy plumage on its head, with a white throat and dark gray cheeks. The most similar birds to the black-throated gray warbler are the black-and-white and blackpoll warblers, which although marked in black have entirely different plumage patterns.

It is typically long, weighing . Wing lengths are , tail lengths , bill lengths , and tarsus lengths , with females slightly smaller than males. Wingspan ranges from 7.5–7.8 in (19–19.7 cm).

This bird gives a sharp &quot;tup&quot; or &quot;thick&quot; call, like that of Townsend&#x27;s warbler but flat and unmusical, as well as a high &quot;see&quot; flight call. The male&#x27;s song is a series of buzzy notes, with the earlier notes doubled and the next to last note high. This song has three variations, including a quiet &quot;soft song&quot; given by the males while following females gathering material for a nest.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The black-throated gray warbler breeds in western North America, its range extending from southwestern British Columbia along the Pacific coast to northern Baja California, and east to New Mexico and southern Montana. It winters mostly in Mexico, from southern Baja California to Oaxaca state. It has spread into parts of Wyoming and Montana only recently, as &quot;Juniperus osteosperma&quot; has expanded its range due to a warming climate. Vagrants have been recorded across eastern North America and in Cuba.

The black-throated gray warbler breeds in open coniferous and mixed forest with a brushy understory, in dry open oak forests, and in chaparral and other scrubland. It is particularly associated with pinyon pines, junipers, and oaks. It migrates to the south late in the fall, returning north in mid-spring. While migrating, it forages in any woodland or scrub it passes through. In its wintering grounds, it occurs in dry woodland and tall scrub. Though its status is not well known, it does not appear to be seriously threatened by habitat destruction or other human activities, unlike many migratory warblers. It is a fairly common bird, among the most common in some localities. Because it is common and not in rapid decline, it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.

== Behavior ==
The black-throated gray warbler is usually approachable, and can easily be observed while foraging. Despite this, it is poorly known, especially in its breeding behavior, of which &quot;Birds of North America&quot; said &quot;almost no information is available&quot;. It forages, often in flocks with other species. It feeds on insects gleaned on low branches, especially caterpillars.

The nest is usually placed on a horizontal tree branch or in a shrub, a few metres above the ground. The nest is an open cup constructed of grass stalks and other fibres, and lined with feathers and hair. The female lays three to five pinkish eggs with brown dots from May to July. Incubation and fledging periods are unknown. This species has been recorded giving a distraction display, pretending to be injured to distract predators from its nest. Both parents feed the young, though the female may do so more frequently.

<text>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA; , AMA) is an international organization co-founded by the governments of over 140 nations along with the International Olympic Committee based in Canada to promote, coordinate, and monitor the fight against drugs in sports. The agency&#x27;s key activities include scientific research, education, development of anti-doping capacities, and monitoring of the World Anti-Doping Code, whose provisions are enforced by the UNESCO International Convention Against Doping in Sport. The aims of the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention and the United States Anti-Doping Agency are also closely aligned with those of WADA.

WADA is responsible for the World Anti-Doping Code, adopted by more than 650 sports organisations, including international sports federations, national anti-doping organisations, the IOC, and the International Paralympic Committee.
==History==
The World Anti-Doping Agency is a foundation created through a collective initiative led by the national governments of over 140 countries along with the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It was set up on 10 November 1999 in Lausanne, Switzerland, nearly a year after meetings that resulted in what was called the &quot;Declaration of Lausanne&quot;, to promote, coordinate and monitor the fight against drugs in sports. Since 2002, the organisation&#x27;s headquarters have been located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Lausanne office became the regional office for Europe. Other regional offices have been established in Africa, Asia/Oceania and Latin America. WADA is responsible for the World Anti-Doping Code, adopted by more than 650 sports organisations, including international sports federations, national anti-doping organisations, the IOC, and the International Paralympic Committee. , its president is Witold Banka.

Initially funded by the International Olympic Committee, WADA receives half of its budgetary requirements from them, with the other half coming from various national governments. Its governing bodies are also composed in equal parts by representatives from the sporting movement (including athletes) and governments of the world. The Agency&#x27;s key activities include scientific research, education, development of anti-doping capacities, and monitoring of the World Anti-Doping Code.

=== McLaren Report ===
In 2016, academic Richard McLaren, an independent investigator working on behalf of WADA, published a second part of his report (the first having been published in July 2016) showing that more than 1,000 Russian athletes in over 30 sports had been involved in or benefited from state-sponsored doping from 2011 to 2015. As a result of the report, many Russian athletes were barred from participating in the 2018 Winter Olympics. Despite widely accepted evidence, in 2018 WADA lifted its ban on Russian athletes. The reinstatement was strongly criticised by, among others, Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, and his lawyer, James Walden.

==Organisation and governance==
WADA is an international organisation. It delegates work in individual countries to Regional and National Anti-Doping Organisations (RADOs and NADOs) and mandates that these organisations are compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code. WADA also accredits around 30 laboratories to perform the required scientific analysis for doping control.

The statutes of WADA and the World Anti-Doping Code mandate the Court of Arbitration for Sport&#x27;s ultimate jurisdiction in deciding doping-related cases.

===Foundation Board===
The highest decision-making authority in WADA is the 38-member Foundation Board, which is comprised equally of IOC representatives and representatives of national governments. The Foundation Board appoints the agency&#x27;s president. Most day-to-day management is delegated to the executive committee.

===Executive Committee===
The executive committee, comprising 16 members, is delegated the Foundation Board to manage the day-to-day operations of the WADA. They are also responsible for all decisions not reserved by WADA&#x27;s Statutes to the Board. Representatives are appointed by the IOC and governments. Many are current or former athletes. Witold Bańka is president, and Yang Yang is vice-president of the committee.
==== List of presidents====
===Other committees===
The Nominations Committee was created in September 2019 in order to ensure that the right people are recruited to serve in senior governance roles within the organisation. Independent Australian business executive Diane Smith-Gander was appointed as inaugural chair of the committee. Other independent members appointed are German human resources expert Regine Buettner and British business executive Simon Gillham. The sports movement nominee is Kelly Fairweather from South Africa, and Maja Makovec Brenčič of Slovenia is the public authority (government) nominee.

There also exist several sub-committees with narrower remits, including a Finance and Administration Committee and an Athlete Committee peopled by athletes.

== World Anti-Doping Code ==
The World Anti-Doping Code is a document published by WADA that approximately 700 sports organisations across the world are signatories to. The code &quot;harmonizes anti-doping policies, rules, and regulations within sport organisations and among public authorities&quot; for the purpose of &quot;protect[ing] the athletes&#x27; fundamental right to participate in doping-free sport&quot;. The code is supplemented by eight international standards published by WADA covering the topics of prohibited substances, testing and investigations, laboratories, Therapeutic Use Exemptions, protection of privacy and personal information, code compliance by signatories, education, and results management. The most recent version of the code took effect on 1 January 2021.

In 2004, the World Anti-Doping Code was implemented by sports organisations prior to the Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. In November 2007, more than 600 sports organisations (international sports federations, national anti-doping organisations, the International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee, and a number of professional leagues in various countries of the world) unanimously adopted a revised Code at the Third World Conference on Doping in Sport, to take effect on 1 January 2009.

In 2013, further amendments to the Code were approved, doubling the sanction for a first offence where intentional doping is established, but allowing for more lenient sanctions for inadvertent rule violations or for athletes co-operating with anti-doping agencies. The updated code came into effect on 1 January 2015.

On 16 November 2017, WADA&#x27;s Foundation Board initiated the 2021 Code Review Process, which also involved simultaneous review of the International Standards. During this time, stakeholders had multiple opportunities to contribute and make recommendations on how to further strengthen the global anti-doping program. Following the review process, stakeholders were invited to intervene publicly on the proposed Code and Standards during the Agency&#x27;s Fifth World Conference on Doping in Sport in Katowice, Poland – an opportunity which was taken up by over 70 stakeholder organisations – before the Code and the full suite of Standards were approved by the Foundation Board and executive committee respectively.

=== Whereabouts rule ===

The anti-doping code revised the &quot;whereabouts&quot; system in place since 2004, under which, , athletes are required to select one hour per day, seven days a week to be available for no-notice drugs tests.

This was unsuccessfully challenged at law in 2009 by Sporta, the Belgian sports union, arguing that the system violated article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights; and by FIFPro, the international umbrella group of football players&#x27; unions, basing its case on data protection and employment law.

A significant number of sports organisations, governments, athletes, and other individuals and organisations have expressed support for the &quot;whereabouts&quot; requirements. The International Association of Athletics Federations and UK Sport are two of the most vocal supporters of this rule. Both FIFA and UEFA have criticised the system, citing privacy concerns, as has the BCCI.

WADA has published a Q&amp;A explaining the rationale for the change.

== Controversies ==
=== Statistical validity of tests ===
Professor Donald A. Berry has said that the closed systems used by anti-doping agencies do not allow statistical validation of the tests. This argument was seconded by an accompanying editorial in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; (7 August 2008). The anti-doping community and scientists familiar with anti-doping work rejected these arguments. On 30 October 2008, &quot;Nature&quot; (Vol 455) published a letter to the editor from WADA countering Berry&#x27;s article. There has been at least one case where the development of statistical decision limit used by WADA in HGH use testing was found invalid by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

=== Chinese doping allegations and subsequent conflict with USADA ===
In 2018, a case containing samples from an anti-doping test, but not the vials themselves, was smashed by the security guards of Chinese swimmer Sun Yang. In justification, the Doping Control Assistant (DCA) in charge of the testing mission was later criticised by Sun Yang, Chinese media, journalists, and scholars for not following the proper protocols. Sun said the DCA in question lacked proper identification, a situation that he said had happened previously with the same assistant. FINA&#x27;s Doping Panel issued Sun with a warning but imposed no penalty. WADA appealed the FINA decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. A three-member CAS panel found Sun guilty of refusing to co-operate with sample testers and banned him from competitive swimming until February 2028.

On 20 April 2024, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and ARD revealed that 23 members of the Chinese swimming team tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug called trimetazidine (TMZ) seven months prior to the start of the 2020 Summer Games and were allowed to participate in the games with some of the swimmers winning medals. Following the publication of the report, Travis Tygart, CEO of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, accused the WADA and the China Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) of covering up doping by Chinese swimmers.

WADA stated that the amount detected was too low to enhance performance, and CHINADA, who had reported the results to WADA and FINA (now World Aquatics), blamed them on contamination from a hotel kitchen, a rationale that potentially exempts findings from being made public. WADA released a statement, explaining that &quot;[it] was not possible for WADA scientists or investigators to conduct their enquiries on the ground in China given the extreme restrictions in place due to a COVID-related lockdown. WADA ultimately concluded that it was not in a position to disprove the possibility that contamination was the source of TMZ and it was compatible with the analytical data in the file.&quot; World Aquatics&#x27;s investigation agreed with WADA. &quot;The New York Times&quot; subsequently obtained a copy of CHINADA and the Ministry of Public Security&#x27;s research, with experts characterizing explanations as being based on simplistic human trials that did not prove how the contamination occurred.

After the story was leaked, WADA was criticised by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and athletes for not being transparent about the findings and keeping &quot;clean athletes in the dark&quot;. WADA&#x27;s choice of Swiss attorney Eric Cottier to lead an investigation into the matter also drew criticism because he was hand-picked by the agency. Experts interviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; said trace amounts of TMZ can be detected near the end of a doping excretion period but could not rule out contamination either.

WADA was also accused of having a double-standard as Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva tested positive for TMZ and used the same excuse, but was subsequently banned for four years. WADA said, based on non-published information and pharmacokinetics, that contamination would not have been possible in Valieva&#x27;s case. In the case of the Chinese swimmers, that no international competition was occurring around the time of the positive tests, only athletes who stayed at one of the hotels tested positive, and some individuals alternated between positive and negative results all point to contamination, not doping.

In May 2024, WADA announced that it held an extraordinary meeting to discuss the positive test results of the Chinese swimmers. WADA said it asked USADA to produce the whistleblowers alleging doping by the Chinese but has received no response, adding that American athletes had &quot;some of the most elaborate and surprising contamination scenarios&quot; in the past. USADA in response criticised WADA for attacking the messenger and its lack of transparency. The United States has threatened to stop funding WADA and called the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) under the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) to look into the matter.

Eleven of the 23 swimmers involved in the controversy were named to the 2024 Chinese Olympic swimming team. In June 2024, US Olympic swimmers Michael Phelps and Allison Schmitt criticized the WADA in a Congressional hearing. In July, the International Olympic Committee accepted Salt Lake City&#x27;s bid to host the 2034 Winter Olympics under the condition that the contract could be terminated &quot;in cases where the supreme authority of the WADA in the fight against doping is not fully respected or if the application of the world antidoping code is hindered or undermined.&quot; NPR described the move as an attempt to crush the ongoing DOJ investigation in the United States. The agreement was signed off by the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee (USOPC) and Salt Lake City officials but criticized by USADA. In response, U.S. lawmakers proposed a bill to give the Office of National Drug Control Policy permanent authority to withhold U.S. funding for WADA if it deems WADA&#x27;s anti-doping actions sub-standard. British swimmer Adam Peaty, who competed at the 2024 Summer Olympics, also expressed dissatisfaction with the World Anti-Doping Agency&#x27;s efforts to combat cheating in sports. The U.S. held back its 2024 funding for WADA.

In September 2024, Swiss prosecutor Eric Cottier, who was picked by WADA to investigate the case of the 23 Chinese swimmers, released his final report noting that some rules were not followed by CHINADA but this did not affect the &quot;acceptance of the contamination hypothesis&quot;. The report said WADA did not show favouritism but its administrative processes could be strengthened. The findings largely matched Cottier&#x27;s June interim report.

==== USADA&#x27;s doper informant scheme ====
On 28 July 2024, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ran a special report on USADA&#x27;s recruitment of dopers to act as undercover informants to assist with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration&#x27;s (DEA) efforts to catch other dopers. This is permitted if WADA agrees. WADA later said it was not notified and the action breached its rules. Following the report, WADA stated that USADA allowed at least three athletes who had violated anti-doping rules to continue competing for years in exchange for their serving as undercover agents to identify other dopers. The effectiveness of the case was acknowledged by sources from World Athletics.

On 7 August 2024, Reuters exposed a scheme under which the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) allowed doped athletes to compete for years in direct contravention of the World Anti-Doping Code and USADA&#x27;s own rules. WADA commented on the Reuters story in a press release in which it said the USADA scheme broke the anti-doping rules. WADA also highlighted that in one case, the USADA suppressed the publication by WADA of any information about an offending athlete on grounds of risk to that athlete&#x27;s personal security, and WADA had no choice but to accede to the USADA request for confidentiality.

On August 8, 2024, CHINADA strongly urged that an independent investigation be conducted into the matter. On August 19, 2024, a former WADA investigator called for WADA to be restructured and that WADA&#x27;s claims about USADA amounted to defamation, alleging that both WADA&#x27;s former director-general and number two official were aware of its cooperation with USADA. WADA said the official that USADA was in touch with was a DEA agent who left WADA in 2016 and had no authority to approve such schemes. WADA reiterated that it was not aware of the practice until 2021 and as soon as it learned of the practice, it asked USADA to stop.

Reuters withdrew the story in October due to an appearance of bias in its sourcing.

==Database leaks==
In August 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency reported the receipt of phishing emails sent to users of its database claiming to be official WADA communications requesting their login details. After reviewing the two domains provided by WADA, it was found that the websites&#x27; registration and hosting information were consistent with the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear. According to WADA, some of the data the hackers released had been forged.

Due to evidence of widespread doping by Russian athletes, WADA recommended that Russian athletes be barred from participating in the 2016 Rio Olympics and Paralympics. Analysts said they believed the hack was in part an act of retaliation against whistleblowing Russian athlete Yuliya Stepanova, whose personal information was released in the breach. In August 2016, WADA revealed that their systems had been breached, explaining that hackers from Fancy Bear had used an IOC-created account to gain access to their Anti-doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS) database. The hackers then used the website fancybear.net to leak what they said were the Olympic drug testing files of several American athletes who had received therapeutic use exemptions, including gymnast Simone Biles for methylphenidate, tennis players Venus Williams (for prednisone, prednisolone, triamcinolone, and formoterol), and Serena Williams (for oxycodone, hydromorphone, prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone), and basketball player Elena Delle Donne (for an amphetamine and hydrocortisone). The hackers focused on athletes who had been granted exemptions by WADA for various reasons. Subsequent leaks included athletes from many other countries.

== Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention ==
The Anti-Doping Convention of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg was opened for signature on 16 December 1989 as the first multilateral legal standard in this field. It has been signed by 52 states including all 47 member states of the Council of Europe and non-member states Australia, Belarus, Canada, Morocco, and Tunisia.

== National Football League ==
It was revealed in May 2011 that the American National Football League (NFL), which does not participate in any international competition and had previously resisted more stringent drug testing, might allow WADA to conduct its drug tests instead of doing it in-house. This could lead the way to testing for HGH, which had previously been without testing in professional American football. However, , cooperation was stalemated because &quot;blood-testing for human growth hormone in the NFL had been delayed by the NFL&#x27;s players union, who had tried &#x27;every possible way to avoid testing. As American football players do not participate in international sporting events, that issue is not a top priority for WADA.

<doc id="881388" wikidata="Q1332219" url="?curid=881388" title="Persian carpet">
<text>A Persian carpet ( ), Persian rug ( ), or Iranian carpet is a heavy textile made for a wide variety of utilitarian and symbolic purposes and produced in Iran (historically known as Persia), for home use, local sale, and export. Carpet weaving is an essential part of Persian culture and Iranian art. Within the group of Oriental rugs produced by the countries of the &quot;rug belt&quot;, the Persian carpet stands out by the variety and elaborateness of its manifold designs.

Persian rugs and carpets of various types were woven in parallel by nomadic tribes in village and town workshops, and by royal court manufactories alike. As such, they represent miscellaneous, simultaneous lines of tradition, and reflect the history of Iran, Persian culture, and its various peoples. The carpets woven in the Safavid court manufactories of Isfahan during the sixteenth century are famous for their elaborate colours and artistic design, and are treasured in museums and private collections all over the world today. Their patterns and designs have set an artistic tradition for court manufactories which was kept alive during the entire duration of the Persian Empire up to the last royal dynasty of Iran.

Carpets woven in towns and regional centers like Tabriz, Kerman, Ravar, Neyshabour, Mashhad, Kashan, Isfahan, Nain and Qom are characterized by their specific weaving techniques and use of high-quality materials, colours and patterns. Town manufactories like those of Tabriz have played an important historical role in reviving the tradition of carpet weaving after periods of decline. Rugs woven by the villagers and various tribes of Iran are distinguished by their fine wool, bright and elaborate colours, and specific, traditional patterns. Nomadic and small village weavers often produce rugs with bolder and sometimes more coarse designs, which are considered as the most authentic and traditional rugs of Persia, as opposed to the artistic, pre-planned designs of the larger workplaces. Gabbeh rugs are the best-known type of carpet from this line of tradition.

As a result of political unrest or commercial pressure, carpet weaving has gone through periods of decline throughout the decades. It particularly suffered from the introduction of synthetic dyes during the second half of the nineteenth century. Carpet weaving still plays a critical role in the economy of modern Iran. Modern production is characterized by the revival of traditional dyeing with natural dyes, the reintroduction of traditional tribal patterns, but also by the invention of modern and innovative designs, woven in the centuries-old technique. Hand-woven Persian rugs and carpets have been regarded as objects of high artistic and utilitarian value and prestige since the first time they were mentioned by ancient Greek writers.

Although the term &quot;Persian carpet&quot; most often refers to pile-woven textiles, flat-woven carpets and rugs like Kilim, Soumak, and embroidered tissues like Suzani are part of the rich and manifold tradition of Persian carpet weaving.

In 2010, the &quot;traditional skills of carpet weaving&quot; in Fars province and Kashan were inscribed to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

== History ==

The beginning of carpet weaving remains unknown, as carpets are subject to use, deterioration, and destruction by insects and rodents. Woven rugs probably developed from earlier floor coverings, made of felt, or a technique known as &quot;flat weaving&quot;. Flat-woven rugs are made by tightly interweaving the warp and weft strands of the weave to produce a flat surface with no pile. The technique of weaving carpets further developed into a technique known as loop weaving. Loop weaving is done by pulling the weft strings over a gauge rod, creating loops of thread facing the weaver. The rod is then either removed, leaving the loops closed, or the loops are cut over the protecting rod, resulting in a rug very similar to a genuine pile rug. Hand-woven pile rugs are produced by knotting strings of thread individually into the warps, cutting the thread after each single knot.

=== Pazyryk carpet ===
The Pazyryk carpet was excavated in 1949 from the grave of a Scythian nobleman in the Pazyryk Valley of the Altai Mountains in Siberia. Radiocarbon testing indicated that the Pazyryk carpet was woven in the 5th century BC. This carpet is and has 36 symmetrical knots per cm2 (232 per inch2). The advanced technique used in the Pazyryk carpet indicates a long history of evolution and experience in weaving. It is considered the oldest known carpet in the world. Its central field is a deep red colour and it has two animal frieze borders proceeding in opposite directions accompanied by guard stripes. The inner main border depicts a procession of deer, the outer men on horses, and men leading horses. The horse saddlecloths are woven in different designs. The inner field contains 4 × 6 identical square frames arranged in rows on a red ground, each filled by identical, star-shaped ornaments made up by centrally overlapping x- and cross-shaped patterns. The design of the carpet already shows the basic arrangement of what was to become the standard oriental carpet design: a field with repeating patterns, framed by a main border in elaborate design, and several secondary borders. 

The discoverer of the Pazyryk carpet, Sergei Rudenko, assumed it to be a product of the contemporary Achaemenids. Whether it was produced in the region where it was found, or is a product of Achaemenid manufacture, remains subject to debate. Its fine weaving and elaborate pictorial design hint at an advanced state of the art of carpet weaving at the time of its production.

=== Early fragments ===
There are documentary records of carpets being used by the ancient Greeks. Homer, assumed to have lived around 850 BC, writes in Ilias XVII,350 that the body of Patroklos is covered with a &quot;splendid carpet&quot;. In Odyssey Book VII and X &quot;carpets&quot; are mentioned. Pliny the Elder wrote (nat. VIII, 48) that carpets (&quot;polymita&quot;) were invented in Alexandria. It is unknown whether these were flat-weaves or pile weaves, as no detailed technical information is provided in the Greek and Latin texts.

Flat-woven kilims dating to at least the fourth or fifth century AD were found in Turfan, Hotan prefecture, East Turkestan, China, an area which still produces carpets today. Rug fragments were also found in the Lop Nur area, and are woven in symmetrical knots, with 5–7 interwoven wefts after each row of knots, with a striped design, and various colours. They are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Other fragments woven in symmetrical as well as asymmetrical knots have been found in Dura-Europos in Syria, and from the At-Tar caves in Iraq, dated to the first centuries AD.

These rare findings demonstrate that all the skills and techniques of dyeing and carpet weaving were already known in western Asia before the first century AD.

=== Early history ===
Persian carpets were first mentioned around 400 BC, by the Greek author Xenophon in his book &quot;Anabasis&quot;:

&quot;αὖθις δὲ Τιμασίωνι τῷ Δαρδανεῖ προσελθών, ἐπεὶ ἤκουσεν αὐτῷ εἶναι καὶ ἐκπώματα καὶ τάπιδας βαρβαρικάς&quot;, (Xen. anab. VII.3.18)
: &quot;Next he went to Timasion the Dardanian, for he heard that he had some Persian drinking cups and carpets.&quot;
&quot;καὶ Τιμασίων προπίνων ἐδωρήσατο φιάλην τε ἀργυρᾶν καὶ τάπιδα ἀξίαν δέκα μνῶν.&quot; [Xen. anab. VII.3.27]
: &quot;Timasion also drank his health and presented him with a silver bowl and a carpet worth ten mines.&quot;

Xenophon describes Persian carpets as precious, and worthy to be used as diplomatic gifts. It is unknown if these carpets were pile-woven, or produced by another technique, e.g., flat-weaving or embroidery, but it is interesting that the very first reference to Persian carpets in the world literature already puts them into a context of luxury, prestige, and diplomacy.

There are no surviving Persian carpets from the reigns of the Achaemenian (553–330 BC), Seleucid (312–129 BC), and Parthian (ca. 170 BC – 226 AD) kings.

=== Sasanian Empire ===

The Sasanian Empire, which succeeded the Parthian Empire, was recognized as one of the leading powers of its time, alongside its neighbouring Byzantine Empire, for a period of more than 400 years. The Sasanids established their empire roughly within the borders set by the Achaemenids, with the capital at Ctesiphon. This last Persian dynasty before the arrival of Islam adopted Zoroastrianism as the state religion.

When and how exactly the Persians started weaving pile carpets is currently unknown, but the knowledge of carpet weaving, and of suitable designs for floor coverings, was certainly available in the area covering Byzance, Anatolia, and Persia: Anatolia, located between Byzance and Persia, was ruled by the Roman Empire since 133 BCE. Geographically and politically, by changing alliances and warfare as well as by trade, Anatolia connected the East Roman with the Persian Empire. Artistically, both empires have developed similar styles and decorative vocabulary, as exemplified by mosaics and architecture of Roman Antioch. A Turkish carpet pattern depicted on Jan van Eyck&#x27;s &quot;Paele Madonna&quot; painting was traced back to late Roman origins and related to early Islamic floor mosaics found in the Umayyad palace of Khirbat al-Mafjar.

Flat weaving and embroidery were known during the Sasanian period. Elaborate Sasanian silk textiles were well preserved in European churches, where they were used as coverings for relics, and survived in church treasuries. More of these textiles were preserved in Tibetan monasteries, and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the Chinese cultural revolution, or excavated from burial sites like Astana, on the Silk Road near Turfan. The high artistic level reached by Persian weavers is further exemplified by the report of the historian Al-Tabari about the Spring of Khosrow carpet, taken as booty by the Arabian conquerors of Ctesiphon in 637 AD. The description of the rug&#x27;s design by al-Tabari makes it seem unlikely that the carpet was pile woven.

Fragments of pile rugs from findspots in north-eastern Afghanistan, reportedly originating from the province of Samangan, have been carbon-14 dated to a time span from the turn of the second century to the early Sasanian period. Among these fragments, some show depictions of animals, like various stags (sometimes arranged in a procession, recalling the design of the Pazyryk carpet) or a winged mythical creature. Wool is used for warp, weft, and pile, the yarn is crudely spun, and the fragments are woven with the asymmetric knot associated with Persian and far-eastern carpets. Every three to five rows, pieces of unspun wool, strips of cloth and leather are woven in. These fragments are now in the Al-Sabah Collection in the Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah, Kuwait.

The carpet fragments, although reliably dated to the early Sasanian time, do not seem to be related to the splendid court carpets described by the Arab conquerors. Their crude knots incorporating shag on the reverse hints at the need for increased insulation. With their coarsely finished animal and hunting depictions, these carpets were likely woven by nomadic people.

=== Advent of Islam and the Caliphates ===
The Muslim conquest of Persia led to the end of the Sasanian Empire in 651 and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Persia. Persia became a part of the Islamic world, ruled by Muslim Caliphates.

Arabian geographers and historians visiting Persia provide, for the first time, references to the use of carpets on the floor. The unknown author of the Hudud al-&#x27;Alam states that rugs were woven in Fārs. 100 years later, Al-Muqaddasi refers to carpets in the Qaināt. Yaqut al-Hamawi tells us that carpets were woven in Azerbaijān in the thirteenth century. The great Arabian traveller Ibn Battuta mentions that a green rug was spread before him when he visited the winter quarter of the Bakhthiari atabeg in Idhej. These references indicate that carpet weaving in Persia under the Caliphate was a tribal or rural industry.

The rule of the Caliphs over Persia ended when the Abbasid Caliphate was overthrown in the Siege of Baghdad (1258) by the Mongol Empire under Hulagu Khan. The Abbasid line of rulers recentered themselves in the Mamluk capital of Cairo in 1261. Though lacking in political power, the dynasty continued to claim authority in religious matters until after the Ottoman conquest of Egypt (1517). Under the Mamluk dynasty in Cairo, large carpets known as &quot;Mamluk carpets&quot; were produced.

=== Seljuq invasion and Turko-Persian tradition ===
Beginning at latest with the Seljuq invasions of Anatolia and northwestern Persia, a distinct Turko-Persian tradition emerged. Fragments of woven carpets were found in the Alâeddin Mosque in the Turkish town of Konya and the Eşrefoğlu Mosque in Beyşehir, and were dated to the Anatolian Seljuq Period (1243–1302). More fragments were found in Fostat, today a suburb of the city of Cairo. These fragments at least give us an idea how Seljuq carpets may have looked. The Egyptian findings also provide evidence for export trade. If, and how, these carpets influenced Persian carpet weaving, remains unknown, as no distinct Persian carpets are known to exist from this period, or we are unable to identify them. It was assumed by Western scholars that the Seljuqs may have introduced at least new design traditions, if not the craft of pile weaving itself, to Persia, where skilled artisans and craftsmen might have integrated new ideas into their old traditions.

=== Mongol Ilkhanate and Timurid Empire ===

Between 1219 and 1221, Persia was raided by the Mongols. After 1260, the title &quot;Ilkhan&quot; was borne by the descendants of Hulagu Khan and later other Borjigin princes in Persia. At the end of the thirteenth century, Ghazan Khan built a new capital at Shãm, near Tabriz. He ordered the floors of his residence to be covered with carpets from Fārs.

With the death of Ilkhan Abu Said Bahatur in 1335, Mongol rule faltered and Persia fell into political anarchy. In 1381, Timur invaded Iran and became the founder of the Timurid Empire. His successors, the Timurids, maintained a hold on most of Iran until they had to submit to the &quot;White Sheep&quot; Turkmen confederation under Uzun Hassan in 1468; Uzun Hasan and his successors were the masters of Iran until the rise of the Safavids.

In 1463, the Venetian Senate, seeking allies in the Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–1479) established diplomatic relations with Uzun Hassans court at Tabriz. In 1473, Giosafat Barbaro was sent to Tabriz. In his reports to the Senate of Venetia he mentions more than once the splendid carpets which he saw at the palace. Some of them, he wrote, were of silk.

In 1403–05 Ruy González de Clavijo was the ambassador of Henry III of Castile to the court of Timur, founder and ruler of the Timurid Empire. He described that in Timur&#x27;s palace at Samarkand, &quot;everywhere the floor was covered with carpets and reed mattings&quot;. Timurid period miniatures show carpets with geometrical designs, rows of octagons and stars, knot forms, and borders sometimes derived from kufic script. None of the carpets woven before 1500 AD have survived.

=== Safavid Period ===

In 1499, a new dynasty arose in Persia. Shah Ismail I, its founder, was related to Uzun Hassan. He is regarded as the first national sovereign of Persia since the Arab conquest, and established Shi&#x27;a Islam as the state religion of Persia. He and his successors, Shah Tahmasp I and Shah Abbas I became patrons of the Persian Safavid art. Court manufactories were probably established by Shah Tahmasp in Tabriz, but definitely by Shah Abbas when he moved his capital from Tabriz in northwestern to Isfahan in central Persia, in the wake of the Ottoman–Safavid War (1603–18). For the art of carpet weaving in Persia, this meant, as Edwards wrote: &quot;that in a short time it rose from a cottage &quot;métier&quot; to the dignity of a fine art.&quot;

The time of the Safavid dynasty marks one of the greatest periods in Persian art, which includes carpet weaving. Later Safavid period carpets still exist, which belong to the finest and most elaborate weavings known today. The phenomenon that the first carpets physically known to us show such accomplished designs leads to the assumption that the art and craft of carpet weaving must already have existed for some time before the magnificent Safavid court carpets could have been woven. As no early Safavid period carpets survived, research has focused on Timurid period book illuminations and miniature paintings. These paintings depict colourful carpets with repeating designs of equal-scale geometric patterns, arranged in checkerboard-like designs, with &quot;kufic&quot; border ornaments derived from Islamic calligraphy. The designs are so similar to period Anatolian carpets, especially to &quot;Holbein carpets&quot; that a common source of the design cannot be excluded: Timurid designs may have survived in both the Persian and Anatolian carpets from the early Safavid, and Ottoman period.

==== &quot;Design revolution&quot; ====
By the late fifteenth century, the design of the carpets depicted in miniatures changed considerably. Large-format medallions appeared, ornaments began to show elaborate curvilinear designs. Large spirals and tendrils, floral ornaments, depictions of flowers and animals, were often mirrored along the long or short axis of the carpet to obtain harmony and rhythm. The earlier &quot;kufic&quot; border design was replaced by tendrils and arabesques. All these patterns required a more elaborate system of weaving, as compared to weaving straight, rectilinear lines. Likewise, they require artists to create the design, weavers to execute them on the loom, and an efficient way to communicate the artist&#x27;s ideas to the weaver. Today this is achieved by a template, termed cartoon (Ford, 1981, p. 170). How Safavid manufacturers achieved this, technically, is currently unknown. The result of their work, however, was what Kurt Erdmann termed the &quot;carpet design revolution&quot;.


The AH year of 946 corresponds to AD 1539–1540, which dates the Ardabil carpet to the reign of Shah Tahmasp, who donated the carpet to the shrine of Shaykh Safi-ad-din Ardabili in Ardabil, who is regarded as the spiritual father of the Safavid dynasty.

Another inscription can be seen on the &quot;Hunting Carpet&quot;, now at the Museo Poldi Pezzoli, Milan, which dates the carpet to 949 AH/AD 1542–3:

The number of sources for more precise dating and the attribution of provenience increase during the 17th century. Safavid carpets were presented as diplomatic gifts to European cities and states, as diplomatic relations intensified. In 1603, Shah Abbas presented a carpet with inwoven gold and silver threads to the Venetian doge Marino Grimani. European noblemen began ordering carpets directly from the manufactures of Isfahan and Kashan, whose weavers were willing to weave specific designs, like European coats of arms, into the commissioned pieces. Their acquisition was sometimes meticulously documented: In 1601, the Armenian Sefer Muratowicz was sent to Kashan by the Polish king Sigismund III Vasa to commission 8 carpets with the Polish royal court of arms to be inwoven. The Kashan weavers did so, and on 12 September 1602 Muratowicz presented the carpets to the Polish king, and the bill to the treasurer of the crown. Representative Safavid carpets made of silk with inwoven gold and silver threads were erroneously believed by Western art historians to be of Polish manufacture. Although the error was corrected, carpets of this type retained the name of &quot;Polish&quot; or &quot;Polonaise&quot; carpets. The more appropriate type name of &quot;Shah Abbas&quot; carpets was suggested by Kurt Erdmann.

==== Masterpieces of Safavid carpet weaving ====

A. C. Edwards opens his book on Persian carpets with the description of eight masterpieces from this great period:

* Ardabil Carpet – Victoria and Albert Museum
* Hunting Carpet – Austrian Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna
* Chelsea Carpet – Victoria and Albert Museum
* Allover Animal and Floral Carpet – Austrian Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna
* Rose-ground Vase Carpet – Victoria and Albert Museum
* Medallion Animal and Floral Carpet with Inscription Guard – Museo Poldi Pezzoli, Milan
* Inscribed medallion Carpet with Animal and Flowers and Inscription Border – Metropolitan Museum of Art, Accession Number: 32.16
* Medallion, Animal, and Tree Carpet – Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris

==== Safavid &quot;Vase technique&quot; carpets from Kirmān ====

A distinct group of Safavid carpets can be attributed to the region of Kirmān in southern Persia. May H. Beattie identified these carpets by their common structure: Seven different types of carpets were identified: Garden carpets (depicting formal gardens and water channels); carpets with centralized designs, characterized by a large medallion; multiple-medallion designs with offset medallions and compartment repeats; directional designs with the arrangements of little scenes used as individual motifs; sickle-leaf designs where long, curved, serrated and sometimes compound leaves dominate the field; arabesque; and lattice designs. Their distinctive structure consists of asymmetric knots; the cotton warps are depressed, and there are three wefts. Woolen wefts lie hidden in the center of the carpet, making up the first and third weft. Silk or cotton makes up the middle weft, which crosses from back to front. A characteristic &quot;tram line&quot; effect is evoked by the third weft when the carpet is worn.

The best known &quot;vase technique&quot; carpets from Kirmān are those of the so-called &quot;Sanguszko group&quot;, named after the House of Sanguszko, whose collection has the most outstanding example. The medallion-and-corner design is similar to other 16th century Safavid carpets, but the colours and style of drawing are distinct. In the central medallion, pairs of human figures in smaller medallions surround a central animal combat scene. Other animal combats are depicted in the field, while horsemen are shown in the corner medallions. The main border also contains lobed medallions with Houris, animal combats, or confronting peacocks. In-between the border medallions, phoenixes and dragons are fighting. By similarity to mosaic tile spandrels in the Ganjali Khan Complex at the Kirmān bazaar with an inscription recording its date of completion as 1006 AH/AD 1596, they are dated to the end of the 16th or the beginning of the 17th century. Two other &quot;vase technique&quot; carpets have inscriptions with a date: One of them bears the date 1172 AH/AD 1758 and the name of the weaver: the Master Craftsman Muhammad Sharīf Kirmānī, the other has three inscriptions indicating that it was woven by the Master Craftsman Mu&#x27;min, son of Qutb al-Dīn Māhānī, between 1066 and 1067 AH/AD 1655–1656. Carpets in the Safavid tradition were still woven in Kirmān after the fall of the Safavid dynasty in 1732 (Ferrier, 1989, p. 127).

The end of Shah Abbas II&#x27;s reign in 1666 marked the beginning of the end of the Safavid dynasty. The declining country was repeatedly raided on its frontiers. Finally, a Ghilzai Pashtun chieftain named Mir Wais Khan began a rebellion in Kandahar and defeated the Safavid army under the Iranian Georgian governor over the region, Gurgin Khan. In 1722, Peter the Great launched the Russo-Persian War (1722–1723), capturing many of Iran&#x27;s Caucasian territories, including Derbent, Shaki, Baku, but also Gilan, Mazandaran and Astrabad. In 1722, an Afghan army led by Mir Mahmud Hotaki marched across eastern Iran, and besieged and took Isfahan. Mahmud proclaimed himself &#x27;Shah&#x27; of Persia. Meanwhile, Persia&#x27;s imperial rivals, the Ottomans and the Russians, took advantage of the chaos in the country to seize more territory for themselves. With these events, the Safavid dynasty had come to an end.

==== Persian carpets from the Safavid Era ====
=== Afsharid and Zand dynasties ===

Iran&#x27;s territorial integrity was restored by a native Iranian Turkic Afshar warlord from Khorasan, Nader Shah. He defeated the Afghans, and Ottomans, reinstalled the Safavids on the throne, and negotiated Russian withdrawal from Irans Caucasian territories, by the Treaty of Resht and Treaty of Ganja. By 1736, Nader himself was crowned shah. There are no records of carpet weaving, which had sunk to an insignificant handicraft, during the Afsharid and Zand dynasties.

=== Qajãr dynasty ===
In 1789, Mohammad Khan Qajar was crowned king of Persia, the founder of the Qajar dynasty, which provided Persia with a long period of order and comparative peace, and the industry had an opportunity of revival. The three important Qajãr monarchs Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, and Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar revived the ancient traditions of the Persian monarchy. The weavers of Tabriz took the opportunity, and around 1885 became the founders of the modern industry of carpet weaving in Persia.

=== Pahlavi dynasty ===
In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, Persia had become a battleground. In 1917, Britain used Iran as the springboard for an attack into Russia in an unsuccessful attempt to reverse the Revolution. The Soviet Union responded by annexing portions of northern Persia, creating the Persian Soviet Socialist Republic. By 1920, the Iranian government had lost virtually all power outside its capital: British and Soviet forces exercised control over most of the Iranian mainland.
In 1925 Rezā Shāh, supported by the British government, deposed Ahmad Shah Qajar, the last Shah of the Qajar dynasty, and founded the Pahlavi dynasty. He established a constitutional monarchy that lasted until the Iranian revolution in 1979. Reza Shah introduced social, economic, and political reforms, ultimately laying the foundation of the modern Iranian state. To stabilize and legitimate their reign, Rezā Shāh and his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi aimed at reviving ancient Persian traditions. The revival of carpet weaving, often referring to traditional designs, was an important part of these efforts. In 1935, Rezā Shāh founded the Iran Carpet Company, and brought carpet weaving under government control. Elaborate carpets were woven for export, and as diplomatic gifts to other states.

The Pahlavi dynasty modernized and centralized the Iranian government, and sought effective control and authority over all their subjects. Reza Shah was the first Persian monarch to confront this challenge with modern weapons. Enforced by the army, nomadism was outlawed during the 1930s, traditional tribal dresses were banned, the use of tents and yurts was forbidden in Iran. Unable to migrate, having lost their herds, many nomadic families starved to death. A brief era of relative peace followed for the nomadic tribes in the 1940s and 1950s, when Persia was involved in the Second World War, and Rezā Shāh was forced to abdicate in 1941. His successor, Mohammed Reza Shah consolidated his power during the 1950s. His land reform program of 1962, part of the so-called White Revolution, despite obvious advantages for landless peasants, destroyed the traditional political organization of nomadic tribes like the Qashqai people, and the traditional way of nomadic life. The centuries-old traditions of nomadic carpet weaving, which had entered a process of decline with the introduction of synthetic dyes and commercial designs in the late nineteenth century, were almost annihilated by the politics of the last Iranian imperial dynasty.

=== Modern times ===
After the Iranian revolution, little information could at first be obtained about carpet weaving in Iran. In the 1970s and 1980s, a new interest arose in Europe in Gabbeh rugs, which were initially woven by nomadic tribes for their own use. Their coarse weaving and simple, abstract designs appealed to Western customers.

In 1992, the first Grand Persian Conference and Exhibition in Tehran presented for the first time modern Persian carpet designs. Persian master weavers like Razam Arabzadeh displayed carpets woven in the traditional technique, but with unusual, modern designs. As the Grand Conferences continue to take place at regular intervals, two trends can be observed in Iranian carpet weaving today. On the one hand, modern and innovative artistic designs are invented and developed by Iranian manufacturers, who thus take the ancient design tradition forward towards the twenty-first century. On the other hand, the renewed interest in natural dyes was taken up by commercial enterprises, which commission carpets to tribal village weavers. This provides a regular source of income for the carpet weavers. The companies usually provide the material and specify the designs, but the weavers are allowed some degree of creative freedom. With the end of the U.S. embargo on Iranian goods, also Persian carpets (including antique Persian carpets acquired at auctions) may become more easily available to U.S. customers again.

As commercial household goods, Persian carpets today are encountering competition from other countries with lower wages and cheaper methods of production: Machine-woven, tufted rugs, or rugs woven by hand, but with the faster and less costly loop weaving method, provide rugs in &quot;oriental&quot; designs of utilitarian, but no artistic value. Traditional hand woven carpets, made of sheep wool dyed with natural colours are increasingly sought after. They are usually sold at higher prices due to the large amount of manual work associated with their production, which has, essentially, not changed since ancient times, and due to the artistic value of their design. Thus, the Persian carpet retains its ancient status as an object of luxury, beauty, and art.

== Materials ==

=== Wool ===
In most Persian rugs, the pile is of sheep&#x27;s wool. Its characteristics and quality vary from each area to the next, depending on the breed of sheep, climatic conditions, pasturage, and the particular customs relating to when and how the wool is shorn and processed. Different areas of a sheep&#x27;s fleece yield different qualities of wool, depending on the ratio between the thicker and stiffer sheep hair and the finer fibers of the wool. Usually, sheep are shorn in spring and fall. The spring shear produces wool of finer quality. The lowest grade of wool used in carpet weaving is &quot;skin&quot; wool, which is removed chemically from dead animal skin. Higher grades of Persian wool are often referred to as kurk, or kork wool, which is gained from the wool growing on the sheep&#x27;s neck. Modern production also makes use of imported wool, e.g. Merino wool from New Zealand, because the high demand on carpet wool cannot be entirely met by the local production. Fibers from camels and goats are also used. Goat hair is mainly used for fastening the borders, or selvedges, of nomadic rugs like Balochi rugs, since it is more resistant to abrasion. Camel wool is occasionally used in Persian nomadic rugs. It is often dyed in black, or used in its natural colour. More often, wool said to be camel&#x27;s wool turns out to be dyed sheep wool.

=== Cotton ===
Cotton forms the foundation of warps and wefts of the majority of modern rugs. Nomads who cannot afford to buy cotton on the market use wool for warps and wefts, which are also traditionally made of wool in areas where cotton was not a local product. Cotton can be spun more tightly than wool, and tolerates more tension, which makes cotton a superior material for the foundation of a rug. Especially larger carpets are more likely to lie flat on the floor, whereas wool tends to shrink unevenly, and carpets with a woolen foundation may buckle when wet. Chemically treated (mercerised) cotton has been used in rugs as a silk substitute since the late nineteenth century.

=== Silk ===
Silk is an expensive material, and has been used for representative carpets. Its tensile strength has been used in silk warps, but silk also appears in the carpet pile. Silk pile can be used to highlight special elements of the design. High-quality carpets from Kashan, Qum, Nain, and Isfahan have all-silk piles. Silk pile carpets are often exceptionally fine, with a short pile and an elaborate design. Silk pile is less resistant to mechanical stress, thus, all-silk piles are often used as wall hangings, or pillows.

=== Spinning ===

The fibers of wool, cotton, and silk are spun either by hand or mechanically by using spinning wheels or industrial spinning machines to produce the yarn. The direction in which the yarn is spun is called &quot;twist&quot;. Yarns are characterized as S-twist or Z-twist according to the direction of spinning. Two or more spun yarns may be twisted together or &quot;plied&quot; to form a thicker yarn. Generally, handspun single plies are spun with a Z-twist, and plying is done with an S-twist. Like nearly all Islamic rugs with the exception of Mamluk carpets, nearly all Persian rugs use &quot;Z&quot; (anti-clockwise) spun and &quot;S&quot; (clockwise)-plied wool.

=== Dyeing ===
The dyeing process involves the preparation of the yarn to make it susceptible for the proper dyes by immersion in a mordant. Dyestuffs are then added to the yarn which remains in the dyeing solution for a defined time. The dyed yarn is then left to dry, exposed to air and sunlight. Some colours, especially dark brown, require iron mordants, which can damage or fade the fabric. This often results in faster pile wear in areas dyed in dark brown colours, and may create a relief effect in antique oriental carpets.

==== Plants ====
Traditional dyes used in Persian rugs are obtained from plants and insects. In 1856, the English chemist William Henry Perkin invented the first aniline dye, mauveine. A variety of other synthetic dyes were invented thereafter. Cheap, readily prepared and easy to use as they were compared to natural dyes, their use is documented since the mid-1860s. The tradition of natural dyeing was revived in Turkey in the early 1980s. Chemical analyses led to the identification of natural dyes from antique wool samples, and dyeing recipes and processes were experimentally re-created.

According to these analyses, natural dyes used for carpet wool include:
* Red from Madder (&quot;Rubia tinctorum&quot;) roots
* Yellow from plants, including onion (&quot;Allium cepa&quot;), several chamomile species (Anthemis, &quot;Matricaria chamomilla&quot;), and Euphorbia
* Black: oak apples, oak acorns, tanner&#x27;s sumach
* Green by double dyeing with indigo and yellow dye
* Orange by double dyeing with madder red and yellow dye
* Blue: indigo gained from &quot;Indigofera tinctoria&quot;
Some of the dyestuffs like indigo or madder were goods of trade, and thus commonly available. Yellow or brown dyestuffs more substantially vary from region to region. Many plants provide yellow dyes, like Vine weld, or Dyer&#x27;s weed &quot;(Reseda luteola)&quot;, Yellow larkspur, or Dyer&#x27;s sumach (&quot;Cotinus coggygria&quot;). Grape leaves and pomegranate rinds, as well as other plants, provide different shades of yellow.

In Iran, traditional dyeing with natural dyes was revived in the 1990s, inspired by the renewed general interest in traditionally produced rugs, but master dyers like Abbas Sayahi had kept alive the knowledge about the traditional recipes.

==== Insect reds ====
Carmine dyes are obtained from resinous secretions of scale insects such as the Cochineal scale Coccus cacti, and certain Porphyrophora species (Armenian and Polish cochineal). Cochineal dye, the so-called &quot;laq&quot; was formerly exported from India, and later on from Mexico and the Canary Islands. Insect dyes were more frequently used in areas where Madder (&quot;Rubia tinctorum&quot;) was not grown, like west and north-west Persia.

==== Synthetic dyes ====
With modern synthetic dyes, nearly every colour and shade can be obtained so that without chemical analysis it is nearly impossible to identify, in a finished carpet, whether natural or artificial dyes were used. Modern carpets can be woven with carefully selected synthetic colours, and provide artistic and utilitarian value.

==== Abrash ====
The appearance of slight deviations within the same colour is called abrash (from Turkish &quot;abraş&quot;, literally, &quot;speckled, piebald&quot;). Abrash is seen in traditionally dyed oriental rugs. Its occurrence suggests that a single weaver has likely woven the carpet, who did not have enough time or resources to prepare a sufficient quantity of dyed yarn to complete the rug. Only small batches of wool were dyed from time to time. When one string of wool was used up, the weaver continued with the newly dyed batch. Because the exact hue of colour is rarely met again when a new batch is dyed, the colour of the pile changes when a new row of knots is woven in. As such, the colour variation suggests a village or tribal woven rug, and is appreciated as a sign of quality and authenticity. Abrash can also be introduced on purpose into a newly planned carpet design.

==Techniques and structures==
=== Process of weaving a rug ===

The weaving of pile rugs is a time-consuming process which, depending on the quality and size of the rug, may take anywhere from a few months to several years to complete.

To begin making a rug, one needs a foundation consisting of warps and wefts: Warps are strong, thick threads of cotton, wool or silk which run through the length of the rug. Similar threads which pass under and over the warps from one side to the other are called wefts. The warps on either side of the rug are normally plied into one or more strings of varying thickness that are overcast to form the selvedge.

Weaving normally begins from the bottom of the loom, by passing a number of wefts through the warps to form a base to start from. Knots of dyed wool, cotton or silk threads are then tied in rows around consecutive sets of adjacent warps. As more rows are tied to the foundation, these knots become the pile of the rug. Between each row of knots, one or more shots of weft are passed to keep the knots fixed. The wefts are then beaten down by a comb-like instrument, the comb beater, to further compact and secure the newly woven row. Depending on the fineness of the weave, the quality of the materials and the expertise of the weavers, the knot count of a handmade rug can vary anywhere from 16 to 800 knots per square inch.

When the rug is completed, the warp ends form the fringes that may be weft-faced, braided, tasseled, or secured in other ways.

===Looms===
Looms, while sharing fundamental design principles, exhibit a diverse range of sizes and levels of complexity. The core technical requirements of a loom are to maintain proper tension and to divide the warp threads into alternating sets or &quot;leaves.&quot; The inclusion of a shedding device enables the weaver to efficiently pass the weft threads through the crossed and uncrossed warp threads, eliminating the need for the painstaking process of manually weaving the weft in and out of the warp.

===Horizontal looms===

The simplest form of loom is a horizontal; one that can be staked to the ground or supported by sidepieces on the ground. The necessary tension can be obtained through the use of wedges. This style of loom is ideal for nomadic people as it can be assembled or dismantled and is easily transportable. Rugs produced on horizontal looms are generally fairly small and the weave quality is inferior to those rugs made on a professional standing loom. Urbanites are unlikely to use horizontal looms as they take up a lot of floor space, and professionals are unlikely to use them as they are unergonomic. Their cheapness and portability is less valuable to urban professionals.

=== Vertical looms ===

The technically more advanced, stationary vertical looms are used in villages and town manufactures. The more advanced types of vertical looms are more comfortable, as they allow for the weavers to retain their position throughout the entire weaving process. The Tabriz type of vertical loom allows for weaving of carpets up to double the length of the loom, while there is no limit to the length of the carpet that can be woven on a vertical roller beam loom. In essence, the width of the carpet is limited by the length of the loom beams.

There are three general types of vertical looms, all of which can be modified in a number of ways:
* The fixed village loom () is used mainly in Iran and consists of a fixed upper beam and a moveable lower or cloth beam which slots into two sidepieces. The correct tension of the warps is obtained by driving wedges into the slots. The weavers work on an adjustable plank which is raised as the work progresses.
* The Tabriz loom (), named after the city of Tabriz, is used in Northwestern Iran. The warps are continuous and pass around behind the loom. Warp tension is obtained with wedges. The weavers sit on a fixed seat and when a portion of the carpet has been completed, the tension is released and the carpet is pulled down and rolled around the back of the loom. This process continues until the rug is completed, when the warps are severed and the carpet is taken off the loom.
* The roller beam loom (, &quot;roller loom&quot;) is used in larger Turkish manufactures, but is also found in Persia and India. It consists of two movable beams to which the warps are attached. Both beams are fitted with ratchets or similar locking devices. Once a section of the carpet is completed, is rolled on to the lower beam. On a roller beam loom, any length of carpet can be produced. In some areas of Turkey several rugs are woven in series on the same warps, and separated from each other by cutting the warps after the weaving is finished.
The Iranian names for the parts of the loom are:
*, the upper beam (horizontal, equivalent to the warp beam)
*, the lower beam (horizontal, equivalent to the breast beam, especially when the fell is wrapped around it )
*, the right post (upright); sometimes used for both posts
*, the right post (upright)
* of 
* or 
*, the wedges regulating the height of the zirdar to tension the warp.
*, weaver&#x27;s bench, which may be adjustable in height.
A horizontal loom also has four pegs to hold it in the ground.
===Tools===
The weaver needs a number of essential tools: a knife for cutting the yarn as the knots are tied; a heavy comb-like instrument with a handle for packing down the wefts; and a pair of shears for trimming the pile after a row of knots, or a small number of rows, have been woven. In Tabriz the knife is combined with a hook to tie the knots, which speeds up work. A small steel comb is sometimes used to comb out the yarn after each row of knots is completed.

A variety of additional instruments are used for packing the weft. Some weaving areas in Iran known for producing very fine pieces use additional tools. In Kerman, a saber-like instrument is used horizontally inside the shed. In Bijar, a nail-like tool is inserted between the warps, and beaten on to compact the fabric even more. Bijar is also famous for their wet loom technique, which consists of wetting the warp, weft, and yarn with water throughout the weaving process to compact the wool and allow for a particularly heavy compression of the pile, warps, and wefts. When the rug is complete and dried, the wool and cotton expand, which results in a very heavy and stiff texture. Bijar rugs are not easily pliable without damaging the fabric.

A number of different tools may be used to shear the wool depending on how the rug is trimmed as the weaving progresses or when the rug is complete. Often in Chinese rugs the yarn is trimmed after completion and the trimming is slanted where the colour changes, giving an embossed three-dimensional effect.
===Knots===

Persian carpets are mainly woven with two different knots: The symmetrical Turkish or &quot;Giordes&quot; knot, also used in Turkey, the Caucasus, East Turkmenistan, and some Turkish and Kurdish areas of Iran, and the asymmetrical Persian, or Senneh knot, also used in India, Turkey, Pakistan, China, and Egypt. The term &quot;Senneh knot&quot; is somewhat misleading, as rugs are woven with symmetric knots in the town of Senneh.

To tie a symmetric knot, the yarn is passed between two adjacent warps, brought back under one, wrapped around both forming a collar, then pulled through the center so that both ends emerge between the warps.

The asymmetric knot is tied by wrapping the yarn around only one warp, then the thread is passed behind the adjacent warp so that it divides the two ends of the yarn. The Persian knot may open on the left or the right.

The asymmetric knot allows to produce more fluent, often curvilinear designs, while more bold, rectilinear designs may use the symmetric knot. As exemplified by Senneh rugs with their elaborate designs woven with symmetric knots, the quality of the design depends more on the weaver&#x27;s skills, than on the type of knot which is used.

Another knot frequently used in Persian carpets is the jufti knot, which is tied around four warps instead of two. A serviceable carpet can be made with jufti knots, and jufti knots are sometimes used in large single-colour areas of a rug, for example in the field, to save on material. However, as carpets woven wholly or partly with the jufti knot need only half the amount of pile yarn compared to traditionally woven carpets, their pile is less resistant to wear, and these rugs do not last as long.

===Flat-woven carpets===
Flat-woven carpets are given their colour and pattern from the weft which is tightly intertwined with the warp. Rather than an actual pile, the foundation of these rugs gives them their design. The weft is woven between the warp until a new colour is needed, it is then looped back and knotted before a new colour is implemented.

The most popular of flat-weaves is called the Kilim. Kilim rugs (along with jewellery, clothing and animals) are important for the identity and wealth of nomadic tribespeople. In their traditional setting Kilims are used as floor and wall coverings, horse-saddles, storage bags, bedding and cushion covers.

Various forms of flat-weaves exist including:
*Bijari rug
*Jajim
*Gelim (Kilim)
*Maleki
*Sirjan
*Soumak (Soumakh)
*Suzani

==Design==
=== Formats and special types ===
* &quot;Ghali&quot; (Persian: , lit. &quot;carpet&quot;): large format carpets (190 × 280 cm).
* &quot;Dozar&quot; or &quot;Sedjadeh&quot;: The term comes from Persian &quot;do&quot;, &quot;two&quot; and &quot;zar&quot;, a Persian measure corresponding to about . Carpets of Dozar size are approximately x .
* &quot;Ghalitcheh&quot; (Persian: ): Carpet of Dozar format, but woven in very fine quality.
* &quot;Kelleghi&quot; or &quot;Kelley&quot; : A long format, ca. x . This format is traditionally placed at the head of a &quot;ghali&quot; carpet (&quot;kalleh&quot; means &quot;head&quot; in Persian).
* &quot;Kenareh&quot; : Smaller long format: × . Traditionally laid out along the longer sides of a larger carpet (&quot;kenār&quot; means &quot;side&quot; in Persian language).
* &quot;Zaronim&quot; : corresponds to 1 ½ &quot;zar&quot;. These smaller rugs are about long.

Nomadic carpets are also known as &quot;Gelim&quot; (; including &quot;Zilou&quot;, meaning &quot;rough carpet&quot;. In this use, Gelim includes both pile rugs and flat weaves (such as kilim and soumak).

=== Field design, medallions and borders ===

Rug design can be described by the way the ornaments are arranged within the pile. One basic design may dominate the entire field, or the surface may be covered by a pattern of repeating figures.

In areas with traditional, time-honoured local designs, such as the Persian nomad tribes, the weaver is able to work from memory, as the specific patterns are part of the family or tribal tradition. This is usually sufficient for less elaborate, mostly rectilinear designs. For more elaborate, especially curvilinear designs, the patterns are carefully drawn to scale in the proper colours on graph paper. The resulting design plan is termed a &quot;cartoon&quot;. The weaver weaves a knot for each square on the scale paper, which allows for an accurate rendition of even the most complex designs. Designs have changed little through centuries of weaving. Today computers are used in the production of scale drawings for the weavers.

The surface of the rug is arranged and organized in typical ways, which in all their variety are nevertheless recognizable as Persian: One single, basic design may cover the entire field (&quot;all-over design&quot;). When the end of the field is reached, patterns may be cut off intentionally, thus creating the impression that they continue beyond the borders of the rug. This feature is characteristic for Islamic design: In the Islamic tradition, depicting animals or humans is prohibited even in a profane context, as Islam does not distinguish between religious and profane life. Since the codification of the Quran by Uthman Ibn Affan in 651 AD/19 AH and the Umayyad Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan reforms, Islamic art has focused on writing and ornament. The main fields of Persian rugs are frequently filled with redundant, interwoven ornaments, often in form of elaborate spirals and tendrils in a manner called infinite repeat.

Design elements may also be arranged more elaborately. One typical oriental rug design uses a medallion, a symmetrical pattern occupying the center of the field. Parts of the medallion, or similar, corresponding designs, are repeated at the four corners of the field. The common Persian &quot;Lechek Torūnj&quot; (medallion and corner) design was developed in Persia for book covers and ornamental book illuminations in the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century, it was integrated into carpet designs. More than one medallion may be used, and these may be arranged at intervals over the field in different sizes and shapes. The field of a rug may also be broken up into different rectangular, square, diamond or lozenge shaped compartments, which in turn can be arranged in rows, or diagonally.

In contrast to Anatolian rugs, the Persian carpet medallion represents the primary pattern, and the infinite repeat of the field appears subordinate, creating an impression of the medallion &quot;floating&quot; on the field.

In most Persian rugs, the field of the rug is surrounded by stripes, or borders. These may number from one up to over ten, but usually there is one wider main border surrounded by minor, or guardian borders. The main border is often filled with complex and elaborate rectilinear or curvilinear designs. The minor border stripes show simpler designs like meandering vines. The traditional Persian border arrangement was highly conserved through time, but can also be modified to the effect that the field encroaches on the main border. This feature is often seen in Kerman rugs from the late nineteenth century, and was likely taken over from French Aubusson or Savonnerie weaving designs.

The corner articulations are a particularly challenging part of rug design. The ornaments have to be woven in a way that the pattern continues without interruption around the corners between horizontal and vertical borders. This requires advance planning either by a skilled weaver who is able to plan the design from start, or by a designer who composes a cartoon before the weaving begins. If the ornaments articulate correctly around the corners, the corners are termed to be &quot;resolved&quot;, or &quot;reconciled&quot;. In village or nomadic rugs, which are usually woven without a detailed advance plan, the corners of the borders are often not resolved. The weaver then discontinues the pattern at a certain stage, e.g., when the lower horizontal border is finished, and starts anew with the vertical borders. The analysis of the corner resolution helps distinguishing rural village, or nomadic, from workshop rugs.

=== Smaller and composite design elements ===
The field, or sections of it, can also be covered with smaller design elements. The overall impression may be homogeneous, although the design of the elements themselves can be highly complicated. Among the repeating figures, the boteh is used throughout the &quot;carpet belt&quot;. Boteh can be depicted in curvilinear or rectilinear style. The most elaborate boteh are found in rugs woven around Kerman. Rugs from Seraband, Hamadan, and Fars sometimes show the boteh in an all-over pattern. Other design elements include ancient motifs like the Tree of life, or floral and geometric elements like, e.g., stars or palmettes.

Single design elements can also be arranged in groups, forming a more complex pattern:
* The Garus pattern consists of a lozenge with floral figure at the corners surrounded by lancet-shaped leaves sometimes called &quot;fish&quot;. Garus patterns are used throughout the &quot;carpet belt&quot;; typically, they are found in the fields of Bidjar rugs. 
* The Mina Khani pattern is made up of flowers arranged in a rows, interlinked by diamond (often curved) or circular lines. frequently all over the field. The Mina Khani design is often seen on Varamin rugs.
* The Shah Abbasi design is composed of a group of palmettes. Shah Abbasi motifs are frequently seen in Aran va bidgol, Kashan, Isfahan, Mashhad and Nain rugs.
* The Bid Majnūn, or Weeping Willow design is in fact a combination of weeping willow, cypress, poplar and fruit trees in rectilinear form. Its origin was attributed to Kurdish tribes, as the earliest known examples are from the Bidjar area.
* The Harshang or Crab design takes its name from its principal motive, which is a large oval motive suggesting a crab. The pattern is found all over the rug belt, but bear some resemblance to palmettes from the Safavid period, and the &quot;claws&quot; of the crab may be conventionalized arabesques in rectilinear style. This design was first used in the Khorasan district in Persia, and in origin ultimately derives from the Isfahan &#x27;in and out&#x27; palmette design.
* The Gol Henai small repeating pattern is named after the Henna plant, which it does not much resemble. The plant looks more like the Garden balsam, and in the Western literature is sometimes compared to the blossom of the Horse chestnut.

==== Common motifs in Persian carpets ====
== Classification ==
Persian carpets are best classified by the social context of their weavers. Carpets were produced simultaneously by nomadic tribes, in villages, town and court manufactures, for home use, local sale, or export.
=== Nomadic/tribal carpets ===
Nomadic, or tribal carpets are produced by different ethnic groups with distinct histories and traditions. As the nomadic tribes originally wove carpets mainly for their own use, their designs have maintained much of the tribal traditions. However, during the twentieth century, the nomadic lifestyle was changed to a more sedentary way either voluntarily, or by the forced settlement policy of the last Persian emperors of the Pahlavi dynasty. By 1970, it was observed that traditional weaving had almost ceased among major nomadic tribes, but in recent years, the tradition has been revived.

==== Kurds ====
The Kurds are an ethnic group, mostly inhabiting the area spanning adjacent parts of southeastern (Turkey), western (Iran), northern (Iraq), and northern (Syria). The large population and the wide geographical distribution of the Kurds account for a varied production spanning a spectre from coarse and naïve nomadic weavings to the most elaborate town manufacture carpets, finely woven like Senneh, or heavy fabrics like Bijar carpets. Although Kurdish rugs represent a traditional part of Persian rug production, they merit separate consideration.

===== Senneh carpets =====
The city of Sanandij, formerly known as Senneh, is the capital of Iran&#x27;s Kurdistan province. The rugs produced here are still known, also in the Iran of today, under their trade name &quot;Senneh&quot;. They belong to the most finely woven Persian rugs, with knot counts up to 400 per square inch (6200/ dm2). The pile is closely clipped, and the foundation is cotton, also silk was used in antique carpets. Some fine carpets have silk warps dyed in different colours which create fringes in different colours known as &quot;rainbow warps&quot; in the rug trade. Mostly blue colours are used in the field, or a pale red. The predominant pattern used to be the Garus pattern, with a lozenge-shaped central medallion also filled with repeating Garus patterns on a different background colour. More realistic floral patterns are also seen, probably in rugs woven for export to Europe.

===== Bijar carpets =====
The town of Bijar lies around northeast of Sanadij. Together, these two towns and their surrounding areas have been major centers of rug production since the eighteenth century. Carpets woven in Bijar and the surrounding villages show more varied designs than Senneh rugs, which has led to the distinction between &quot;city&quot; and &quot;village&quot; Bijar rugs. Often referred to as &quot;The Iron Rug of Persia&quot;, the Bijar rug is distinguished by its highly packed pile, which is produced by a special technique known as &quot;wet weaving&quot;, with the help of a special tool. Warps, weft and pile are constantly kept wet during the weaving process. When the finished carpet is allowed to dry, the wool expands, and the fabric becomes more compact. The fabric is further compacted by vigorous hammering on nail-like metal devices which are inserted between the warps during the weaving. Alternate warps are moderately to deeply depressed. The fabric is further compacted by using wefts of different thickness. Usually one of three wefts is considerably thicker than the others. The knots are symmetrical, at a density of 60 to over 200 per square inch (930–2100/ dm2), rarely even over 400 (6200/ dm2).

The colours of Bijar rugs are exquisite, with light and dark blues, and saturated to light, pale madder red. The designs are traditionally Persian, with predominant Garus, but also Mina Khani, Harshang, and simple medallion forms. Frequently the design is more rectilinear, but Bijar rugs are more easily identified by their peculiar, stiff and heavy weaving than by any design. Bijar rugs cannot be folded without risking to damage the foundation. A specific feature is also the lack of outlining, particularly of the smaller patterns. Full-size &quot;sampler&quot; carpets showing only examples of field and border designs rather than a fully developed carpet design are called &quot;vagireh&quot; by rug traders, and are frequently seen in the Bijar area. New Bijar carpets are still exported from the area, mostly with less elaborate Garus designs and dyed with good synthetic dyes.

===== Kurdish village rugs =====
From a Western perspective, there is not much detailed information about Kurdish village rugs, probably because there is insufficient information to identify them, as they have never been specifically collected in the West. Usually, rugs can only be identified as &quot;northwest Persian, probably Kurdish&quot;. As is generally the case with village and nomadic rugs, the foundation of village rugs is more predominantly of wool. Kurdish sheep wool is of high quality, and takes dyes well. Thus, a rug with the distinct features of &quot;village production&quot;, made of high-quality wool with particularly fine colours may be attributed to Kurdish production, but mostly these attributions remain educated guesswork. Extensive use of common rug patterns and designs poses further difficulty in assigning a specific regional or tribal provenience. A tendency of integrating regional traditions of the surrounding areas, like Anatolian or northwestern Persian designs was observed, which sometimes show distinct, unusual design variations leading to suggest a Kurdish production from within the adjacent areas. Also, northwestern Persian towns like Hamadan, Zenjan or Sauj Bulagh may have used &quot;Kurdish&quot; design features in the past, but modern production on display at the Grand Persian Exhibitions seems to focus on different designs.

==== Qashqai ====

The early history of the Qashqai people remains obscure. They speak a Turkic dialect similar to that of Azerbaijan, and may have migrated to the Fars province from the north during the thirteenth century, possibly driven by the Mongol invasion. Karim Khan Zand appointed the chief of the Chahilu clan as the first Il-Khan of the Qashqai. The most important subtribes are the Qashguli, Shishbuluki, Darashuri, Farsimadan, and Amaleh. The Gallanzan, Rahimi, and Ikdir produce rugs of intermediate quality. The rugs woven by the Safi Khani and Bulli subtribes are considered among the highest quality rugs. The rugs are all wool, usually with ivory warps, which distinguishes Qashqai from Khamseh rugs. Qashqai rugs use asymmetric knots, while Gabbeh rugs woven by Qashqai more often use symmetric knots. Alternate warps are deeply depressed. Wefts are in natural colours or dyed red. The selvedges are overcast in wool of different colours, creating a &quot;barber pole&quot; pattern, and are sometimes adorned with woolen tassels. Both ends of the rug have narrow, striped flat-woven kilims. Workshops were established in the nineteenth century already around the town of Firuzabad. Rugs with repeating boteh and the Garus pattern, medallion, as well as prayer rug designs resembling the millefleurs patterns of Indian rugs were woven in these manufactures. The Garus design may sometimes appear to be disjointed and fragmented. The Qashqai are also known for their flat-weaves, and for their production of smaller, pile-woven saddle bags, flat-woven larger bags (&quot;mafrash&quot;), and their Gabbeh rugs.

The Shishbuluki (&quot;lit.&quot;: &quot;six districts&quot;) rugs are distinguished by small, central, lozenge-shaped medallions surrounded by small figures aligned in concentric lozenges radiating from the center. The field is most often red, details are often woven in yellow or ivory. Darashuri rugs are similar to those of the Shishbuluki, but not so finely woven.

As the truly nomadic way of life has virtually come to an end during the twentieth century, most Qashqai rugs are now woven in villages, using vertical looms, cotton warps, or even an all-cotton foundation. They use a variety of designs associated with the Qashqai tradition, but it is rarely possible to attribute a specific rug to a specific tribal tradition. Many patterns, including the &quot;Qashqai medallion&quot; previously thought to represent genuine nomadic design traditions, have been shown to be of town manufacture origin, and were integrated into the rural village traditions by a process of stylization.

The revival of natural dyeing has had a major impact on Qashqai rug production. Initiated in Shiraz during the 1990s by master dyers as Abbas Sayahi, particularly Gabbeh rugs raised much interest when they were first presented at the Great Persian Exhibition in 1992. Initially woven for home use and local trade, coarsely knotted with symmetric knots, the colours initially seen were mostly natural shades of wool. With the revival of natural colours, Gabbeh from Fars province soon were produced in a full range of colours. They met the Western demand for primitive, naïve folk art as opposed to elaborate commercialized designs, and gained high popularity. In the commercial production of today, the Gabbeh rug patterns remain simple, but tend to show more modern types of design.

==== Khamseh federation ====

The Khamseh (&quot;lit.&quot;: &quot;five tribes&quot;) federation was established by the Persian Qajar government in the nineteenth century, to rival the dominant Qashqai power. Five tribal groups of Arab, Persian and Turkic origin were combined, including the Arab tribe, the Basseri, Baharlu, Ainalu, and Nafar tribes. It is difficult to attribute a specific rug to the Khamseh production, and the label &quot;Khamseh&quot; is often used as a term of convenience. Dark woolen warps and borders are associated with Arab Khamseh rugs, warps are rarely depressed, the colour scheme is more subdued. Specifically, a stylized bird (&quot;murgh&quot;) pattern is often seen on rugs attributed to the confederation, arranged around a succession of small, lozenge shaped medallions. Basseri rugs are asymmetrically knotted, brighter in colours, with more open space and smaller ornaments and figure with Orange as the specific colour. The Baharlu are a Turkic-speaking tribe settled around Darab, and few carpets are known from this more agricultural region.

==== Luri ====
The Lurs live mainly in western and south-western Iran. They are of Indo-European origin. Their dialect is closely related to the Bakhtiari dialect and to the dialect of the southern Kurds. Their rugs have been marketed in Shiraz. The rugs have a dark wool foundation, with two wefts after each row of knots. Knots are symmetrical or asymmetrical. Small compartment designs of repeating stars are often seen, or lozenge-shaped medallions with anchor-like hooks on both ends.

==== Afshari ====
The Afshar people are a semi-nomadic group of Turkic origin, principally located in the mountainous areas surrounding the modern city of Kerman in southeastern Iran. They produce mainly rugs in runner formats, and bags and other household items with rectilinear or curvilinear designs, showing both central medallions and allover patterns. Colours are bright and pale red. The flat-woven ends often show multiple narrow stripes.

==== Balochi ====

The Baloch people live in eastern Iran. They weave small-format rugs and a variety of bags with dark red and blue colours, often combined with dark brown and white. Camel hair is also used.

=== Village carpets ===
Carpets produced in villages are usually brought to a regional market center, and carry the name of the market center as a label. Sometimes, as in the case of the &quot;Serapi&quot; rug, the name of the village serves as a label for a special quality. Village carpets can be identified by their less elaborate, more highly stylized designs.

Criteria suggesting village production include:
# A rug of so-called scatter-size (&quot;dozar&quot;) that has been woven in a settled environment;
# woven without a cartoon;
# woven without reconciled corners;
# woven with possible idiosyncrasies of construction and pattern elements.

Village rugs are more apt to have warps of wool rather than of cotton. Their designs are not as elaborate and ornate than the curvilinear patterns of city rugs. They are more likely to display abrash and conspicuous mistakes in detail. On simple vertical looms, the correct tension of the warps is difficult to maintain during the entire weaving process. So, village rugs tend to vary in width from end to end, have irregular sides, and may not lay entirely flat. In contrast to manufactory rugs, there is considerable variety in treating the selvedges and fringes. Village rugs are less likely to present depressed warps, as compared to manufactory rugs. They tend to make less use of flat woven kilim ends to finish off the ends of the rug, as compared to tribal rugs. The variation in treatment of fringes and ends, and the way the selvedges are treated, provide clues as to place of origin.

==== Northwestern Iran ====

Tabriz is the market center for the Iranian Northwest. Carpets woven in this region mainly use the symmetric knot. Heriz is a local center of production for mainly room-size carpets. Warps and weft are of cotton, the weaving is rather coarse, with high-quality wool. Prominent central medallions are frequently seen with rectilinear outlines highlighted in white. The ornaments of the field are in bold, rectilinear style, sometimes in an allover design. Higher quality Heriz carpets are known as Serapi. The village of Sarab produces runners and galleries with broad main borders either of camel hair or wool dyed in the colour of camel hair. Large, interconnected medallions fill the field. Mostly rectilinear, geometric and floral patterns are dyed in pink red and blue. Bakshaish carpets with a shield-shaped large medallion, less elaborate rectilinear patterns in salmon red and blue are labeled after the village of Bakhshayesh. Karadja produces runners with specific square and octagonal medallions in succession.

==== Western Iran ====
Major production centers in the West are Hamadan, Saruk with its neighbouring town of Arak, Minudasht also known under the trade name Lilihan and Serabend, Maslaghan, Malayer and Feraghan.

* Carpets from Maslaghan are usually small (120 × 180 cm), the warps are made of cotton, the wefts of wool or cotton. The large medallion shows a so-called &quot;lobed Göl&quot;, the colours of which are in sharp contrast to the field, with small borders. Malayer, Sarouk and Feraghan are located closely to each other. They use cotton for the foundation.
* Malayer carpets are distinguished by their single-weft and the use of the symmetrical knot. Allover and medallion patterns are common, the boteh motif is frequently used.
* The original Sarouk design was distinguished by a round-star medallion with surrounding pendants. The traditional design of the Sarouk rug was modified by the weavers towards an allover design of detached floral motives, the carpets were then chemically washed to remove the unwanted colours, and the pile was painted over again with more desirable colours. Feraghan carpets are less finely woven than Sarouk. Often the Garus pattern is seen all over. medallions, if they occur, show more geometrical designs. A corroding green dye is typical for Feraghan carpets.

==== Southern Iran ====
Since the mid-twentieth century, commercial production started in the villages of Abadeh and Yalameh. Abadeh rugs adopted traditional Qashqai designs, but used cotton for warps and wefts, the latter often dyed in blue. Yalameh carpets more resemble Khamseh designs with hooked medallions arranged in the field. Warps and wefts were often in white.

==== Eastern Iran ====
The village of Doroksh is known for its carpet production in Eastern Persia. They are characterized by their use of orange dyes, the boteh motif is often seen. Usually, there is only one border. The knots are asymmetric.

=== Town carpets ===
Tabriz in the West, Kerman Ravar in the South, and Mashhad in the Northeast of Iran, together with the central Iranian towns Such as: Aran va bidgol, Kashan, Ravar, Isfahan, Nain and Qom are the main centers of town manufacture.

* Aran va bidgol has the best and most beautiful carpets and rugs in Iran. Its beauty, charm and softness have made this city the largest center of machine carpet production in Iran and the second largest manufacturer of machine carpet in the world.
* Tabriz has been a center of carpet production for centuries. Many designs are reproduced by Tabrizi weavers, with wool or silk in the pile, and wool, cotton or silk in the foundation.
* Kerman is known for finely knotted, elegant carpets with prominent cochineal red, ivory and golden yellow colours. Their medallions are elegantly designed, and elaborate versions of the boteh design are often seen in the field. 
* Mashhad carpets are of average quality. Cochineal red is often used. Emogli (Amoghli) carpets are made of silk, and represent the finest carpets manufactured in Mashhad. They show dense arabesque patterns on red ground.
* Kashan is the oldest carpet-producing city in Central Iran. Famous for its production of silk carpets, carpet weaving was revived in the late 19th century. The earliest carpets woven in Kashan at the turn of the nineteenth century show some imbalances in their designs, which was overcome, and carpets were produced mainly with a red or ivory field and elaborate ogival central medallions.
* Isfahan, Nain, and Qom revived or started carpet manufacture by the mid-twentieth century. All-silk, or silk pile on cotton foundation carpets are produced with asymmetrical knots. Their design is often inspired by Safavid designs. Carpets from Qom and Nain often have richly decorated medallions, and tender light blue and ivory colours. Isfahan carpets use more dark red and blue colours.

== Commercial aspects ==

Iran exported $517 million worth of hand-woven carpets in 2002. Iran&#x27;s carpet exports amounted to US$635 million in 2004, according to the figures from the state-owned Iran Carpet Company. In October 2006, National Iranian Carpet Center revealed that hand-woven carpets have ranked first in country&#x27;s non-oil exports and hold the third position among overall exports. Nearly five million workers are engaged in the Iranian carpet industry, making it one of the biggest enterprises in the country.

The absence of modern R&amp;D is causing rapid decline in the size as well as market value of this art.

In 2008, Iran&#x27;s exports of hand-woven carpets was $420 million or 30% of the world&#x27;s market. Iran exports carpets to more than 100 countries, as hand-woven rugs are one of its main non-oil export items. The United States is the single largest importer of Persian hand woven carpets. In 2011, President Obama signed into law an act that greatly enhanced restrictions on Iranian-origin imports, causing the imports of Iranian carpets to be halted. After certain sanctions were lifted on implementation day on 16 January 2016, Iran&#x27;s exports of carpets in the first quarter amounted to $60 million. In 2017, Iran exported $24.3 million worth of hand-woven carpets but was far from the top producer Turkey, which exported $1.77 billion worth of hand-woven carpets in the same year.

== Trivia ==
* The idiom &quot;Persian flaw&quot;, meaning a deliberate mistake, is said to originate from the notion that Persian weavers would intentionally leave imperfections in each rug in the belief that only God&#x27;s creations are perfect, and to weave a perfect rug would be an insult to God.
* The most famous Persian carpet is the Ardabil Carpet, in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, which in fact is now a combination of two original carpets, with another piece from the second in Los Angeles. This has been the subject of endless copies ranging in size from small to full scale. There is an &#x27;Ardabil&#x27; at 10 Downing Street, and even Hitler had an &#x27;Ardabil&#x27; in his office in Berlin.
* The most expensive carpet in the world is a 17th-century Persian vase style carpet, afshar collection which was sold in June 2013 in a London auction for $33.8m.
* The &quot;Carpet of Wonder&quot; in the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in Muscat, in the Sultanate of Oman, measures . Its construction required four years of labour by 600 workers, resulting in 12 million man hours of work.
* Iran is also the maker of the largest handmade carpet in history, measuring .

<text>Horowhenua District is a territorial authority district on the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand, administered by Horowhenua District Council. Located north of Wellington and Kāpiti, it stretches from slightly north of the town of Ōtaki in the south to just south of Himatangi in the north, and from the coast to the top of the Tararua Range. It is in the Manawatū-Whanganui local government region. The name &quot;Horowhenua&quot; is Māori for landslide.

==History==
Horowhenua County was established in 1885 from the southern part of Manawatu County. It stretched from the Manawatū River, Opiki and Tokomaru in the north, to Waikanae and the Waikanae River in the south. The county offices were in Ōtaki until 1896, when they were moved to Levin.

Horowhenua District was established in 1989 from a merger of Horowhenua County, Foxton Borough, Levin Borough and part of the first Manawatū District, as part of New Zealand local government reforms. The southern part of Horowhenua County – the Waikanae and Otaki areas – became part of Kāpiti Coast District.

==Land use==
Much of the area was once an extensive wetland and the centre of a substantial flax industry. It has been progressively drained and converted to productive but flood-prone farmland, with a mixture of loam and peat based soils. Some parts of the wetland, particularly those around Lake Horowhenua are being returned to their former state as a conservation area, with the help of local Māori. One of the local tribal authorities is the Muaūpoko Tribal Authority.

<doc id="881395" wikidata="Q3572729" url="?curid=881395" title="You've Been Framed!">
<text>You&#x27;ve Been Framed! was a British television programme where viewers contributed to the programme with their humorous home movies for the entertainment of others. The series began in 1990 and ended in 2022.

==History==

The show&#x27;s format is based on the Japanese show &quot;Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan&quot; (1986), which was also the basis for &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; (1989). The show is also similar in format to a number of other shows worldwide, such as &quot;Australia&#x27;s Funniest Home Video Show&quot; (1991). In a deal with various foreign producers of similar shows, many imported clips are used, in exchange for home-grown videos from the United Kingdom.

The show was first commissioned as a pilot and aired on ITV on 14 April 1990 with Jeremy Beadle as the host; a second pilot was also commissioned and aired on 1 September 1990. Both pilots were a success, with a full series commissioned, which began airing on 6 January 1991. The early Beadle era featured more audience participation: for example, brief interviews with people who had been featured in clips, and the audience voting for their favourite clip at the end of each show, with the winners throughout the series going through to the final, in a bid to win a £5,000 cash prize at the end of the series.

The show was referenced in the closing episode of &quot;Bottom&quot;, &quot;Carnival&quot;, in 1995 with the name &quot;Jeremy Beadle&#x27;s Viciously Hilarious Violent Domestic Incidents&quot;, for which the lead characters Richie and Eddie tried to film a fake clip they would later submit for it. A segment was introduced showcasing clips which had obviously been faked, called &quot;Named, Framed and Shamed!&quot;, which ended when the studio was ditched in favour of an apartment setting later on when Jonathan Wilkes was presenting. This segment was also tried out during the Beadle era, under the name &#x27;Dodgy Clip Alert&#x27;. Another parody of the series, &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Filmed!&quot;, featured as a short clip from the &quot;Clip Round&quot; in a 2009 episode of comedy panel show &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;, where the comedians from the series appeared in their own clearly faked video clips.

The format was tweaked in later years, and the studio set and logo changed several times. Lisa Riley took over the role as host from Beadle in 1998. While the programme was presented by Jonathan Wilkes, who replaced Riley in 2003, the feature where the studio audience voted for which clip was the best of the show returned, under the name &#x27;Clip for a Trip&#x27;, with the person who sent in the winning clip receiving £1,000.

In Autumn 2004, visual continuity was replaced with a narrator, voiced by Harry Hill, which meant that for the first time since the show began, there was no longer a studio set, audience or on-screen personality. Hill provides humorous commentary on the clips via voice-over, which means more clips can be shown. This also uses a short version of a short-lived 2003 intro, which was used in the Jonathan Wilkes era, and was used until 2007.

In the series&#x27; ninth year of transmission, ITV started another home videos series, &quot;Animals Do the Funniest Things&quot; featuring humorous clips of animals, which, although originally produced by LWT when it was first broadcast in 1999, was produced by Granada Television from 2002, therefore becoming Granada&#x27;s second home video television series after &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Framed!&quot;.

Submission of clips to &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Framed!&quot; is free of postage, and in later years, the show began accepting clips via e-mail, and more lately, the inclusion of mobile phone videos; noted on-screen by a small mobile symbol in the corner of the screen, resembling a digital on-screen graphic. Originally, £100 was paid for every submitted clip that was shown. This was soon increased to £250 where it remained for the rest of the show&#x27;s run. &quot;Granada Reports&quot; newsreader Andrew Brittain was a regular announcer from 1991 until the end of the Jonathan Wilkes era in 2003 when he left &quot;Granada Reports&quot;.

In later series, Hill made regular obtuse references to the Norfolk market town of Swaffham, in reprisal of the serious injuries he once received in a bizarre bird attack in the town. Additionally, whenever a woman vaguely resembles former host Lisa Riley, Hill referred to her as his &quot;arch-nemesis&quot;. The latter was an example of how many of Hill&#x27;s commentaries refer to people vaguely resembling celebrities as such celebrities. Even if someone resembles Hill, he will himself refer to himself as the person in the clip. For a period when Hill&#x27;s television series &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s TV Burp&quot; was produced, the latter show would be broadcast directly after &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Framed!&quot; on ITV1, and Hill would occasionally make references to the consecutive scheduling on &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s TV Burp&quot;. The latter show&#x27;s official book also features a section dedicated to &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Framed!&quot;, where Hill refers to it as &quot;your second favourite show on television&quot;.

On 21 February 2023, ITV announced that there would be no new series that year, and that there were no plans for it to return in 2024.

==Format==
During the show, the video clips are played and the people who sent them in receive £250. Just before the advert break, viewer-participation competitions are started, and then are concluded when the programme resumes; examples of these include the &quot;What Happens Next?&quot; competition where the viewers have to guess what happens after a clip is frozen is started, the &quot;Framed Gold Records&quot; competition, where viewers have to guess how many times something can happen before something else happens (for example, &quot;How many people can fall over before a dog gets through a very tight space?&quot;), or &quot;Are you a cry baby? Maybe.&quot; competition, in which viewers guess if there will be tears before bedtime, is played. The answer is revealed after the break.

The video clips are normally sorted into separate categories, with examples being categories based on animals, humorous things children say, or embarrassing situations at weddings. Some of the categories let their clips play with humorous commentary from Harry Hill, whilst others have consistent musical backing, so that the clips can be seen as forming a sort of music video. Generally, the soundtrack choice is relevant to the subject of the category (for example, &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; once played over a category on cat videos). The musical categories also feature shorter clips than the commentary categories, as the latter will often feature more of what happens before and after the incident in the clip to accommodate Hill&#x27;s commentary.

Episodes will typically begin with Hill announcing what is &quot;coming up&quot; in the episode, showing three brief clips, before segueing into the title sequence, although these openings could be considered part of the title sequence. This is a departure to episodes in the Jeremy Beadle/Lisa Riley eras, which used to contain cold openings showing all of a clip without any voice-over.

Sometimes, special editions featuring countdown or &quot;A-Z&quot; lists will be produced, which mostly reuse older clips. There have been approximately 67 specials, and are especially common in the current day.

<text>The Tatra 815 is a truck family, produced by Czech company Tatra. It uses the traditional Tatra concept of rigid backbone tube and swinging half-axles giving independent suspension. The vehicles are available in 4x4, 6x6, 8x8, 10x8, 10x10, 12x8 and 12x12 variants. There are both air-cooled and liquid-cooled engines available with power ranging from . As a successor to Tatra 813 it was originally designed for extreme off-road conditions, while nowadays there are also variants designated for mixed (both off- and on-road) use. The gross weight is up to .

The 815 and its descendant models took the Czech truck racer Karel Loprais to victory six times in the Dakar Rally.

==History==
Designed to eventually replace the Tatra 148, the prototype Tatra 157 was introduced in 1970 and several more prototypes were designed between 1970 and 1974 period but no production resulted. Due to protests from another Czechoslovak manufacturer LIAZ which was assigned by the government central planning committee to manufacture trucks of similar class, Tatra dropped the 157 and instead started to concentrate on a heavier class as the replacement for the 813 and 148 which was introduced in 1983 as the 815 series. In 1989 Tatra modernized the 815 and introduced new 815-2 which received further upgrade in 1994 and just 3 years later in 1997 the new cabin TerrN°1 is introduced. Another facelift followed in 2000 where changes included among others new instrument panel and cab attachment and for the first time there is an option for fitment of liquid-cooled engines. The latest facelift of cabin came in July 2010. Due to emission requirements changes in 2003 Tatra developed all new V8 engine T3C to comply with Euro III where it followed the tradition once again with its air cooling design. The further developed T3D engine was introduced in 2006 with its SCR and Euro IV compliance. 

Manufacturing ended on 25 February 2025 with 158,065 units made.

==Design==

While most other manufacturers derive their trucks from road applications, the 815 was purposely designed for extreme off-road conditions, and its road versions are derived from the off-road original concept. The principle consists in a central load-carrying tube with independently suspended swinging half-axles bolted as one whole. This gives Tatra vehicles outstanding driving qualities in the most difficult terrains. The concept allows higher off-road speed compared to classical rigid axle design.

===Central load-carrying tube===
The primary structural feature of Tatra trucks is the central load carrying tube, also called a backbone frame. All other parts of the truck are mounted to this rigid assembly. The inherently high torsional and flexural rigidity of this layout protects superstructures from the motions and forces on the axles. Torque distribution to the axles is also carried within the backbone.

===Differential===
Tatra differentials are a unique design that uses two opposing spiral bevel gears instead of the usual single set. The differential gears are part of the input drive shaft rather than between the output axles as in a conventional differential. All versions of the Tatra differential have locking pins that can force the differential gears to rotate together, &quot;locking&quot; the differential. This arrangement had two distinct advantages. The first is that the dual output bevel gears allow the axles to swing around the drive axle without the need for universal couplings. The second is that the input drive shaft goes essentially straight through the differential housing, allowing simple coupling to a second set of swing axles. This modular design enables configurations of 2, 3, 4, 5, or even 6 axles with all axles driven. The whole assembly is part of the backbone frame.

===Suspension===

====Front====
* Mechanical suspension of load capacity up to 8 tons per axle by torsion bars – for versions with one steered front axle (4x4 and 6x6) or by leaf springs – for versions with two steered axles (6x6, 8x8, 10x10 or 12x12).
* Air-bellows, with a load capacity of 9 tons per axle and a possibility of a ground clearance regulation.

====Rear====
* Mechanical – by leaf springs, with a load capacity of up to 11.5 tons per axle
* Air-bellows with a load capacity of 10 tons per axle and a possibility of a ground clearance regulation
* Tatra &quot;King Frame&quot; suspension system - combination of an air-bellow with a coil spring placed inside, with a load capacity of up to 11.5 tons per axle or combination of air-bellows with leaf springs, with a load capacity of 13, 15 and 16.5 tons per axle.

All suspension types are equipped with telescopic shock absorbers; some versions also have stabilizer torsion bars.

===Engine===
The Tatra engine is an air-cooled, OHV, currently 12.7 litre 90° V8 120 x 140 mm diesel engine with direct fuel injection. It is turbocharged by one Holset WasteGate turbocharger, and equipped with an intercooler placed directly over the engine. The engine is equipped with a mechanically controlled in-line Bosch injection pump. Its roller crankshaft bolted together from individual segments belongs among unique technical solutions. The engine is available in emission specifications Euro II - Euro III with power output ranging from and torque. At its launch, the T815 could alternatively be delivered with a larger powertrain. Available options, all of which were from Tatra&#x27;s own range of engines, included the air-cooled V10 (15.8 litre) and V12 (19 litre), both without turbo and intercooler, and a V12 bi-turbo. When the Euro I emission limits came into effect, the larger engine alternatives became unavailable.

The 815 can also be fitted with water-cooled engines made by other manufacturers - notably Cummins and Deutz with power ranging from with torque.

The most powerful MTU engine that was used in a 815 prototype tank prime mover, had an output of displacing 21,930 cc.

===Transmission===

* Manually controlled mechanical Tatra transmission which is mounted directly on the auxiliary transmission case, and which, therefore, is an integrated part of the chassis with 10 or 14 gears with two auxiliary gears.
* An electronically controlled gear shifting Tatra - a driver using a joystick just pre-sets a speed gear, and after the clutch is engaged, the speed shifting is carried out. The driver is informed about the shifted speed gear by means of a dashboard display.
* Twin Disc which is a six-gear auto transmission of 1189 or 1177 type
* Allison six or seven-gear automatic transmission with a compact construction in one case, with a torque converter, which are mounted directly on the engine

===Cab===

Tatra T815 is equipped with own Tatra-produced COE cab. There is basic version, extended version with room behind seats used for a berth and especially for fire-fighting applications a long four-door cab enabling transportation of up to six persons.

There is also special low cab version used mostly for cranes and other special applications. The cab is situated in front of the front axle.

===Equipment===
* Trucks equipped with air-bellows suspension have possibility of a ground clearance regulation.
* Special protective surface finish
* Central tyre inflation system enabling deflation/inflation of tyres during the drive in boggy terrain (standard for military versions, on demand for civilian)
* Multi-fuel engines for military version (on demand)
* Vehicle radio-shielding as per NATO standards for military version
* Possibility of additional cab ballistic protection through a supplied and subsequently installed additional armouring set intended also for windows for military version

<doc id="881404" wikidata="Q2446888" url="?curid=881404" title="Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park">
<text>Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park is a local nature reserve and historic cemetery in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets within the East End of London. It is regarded as one of the seven great cemeteries of the Victorian era, the &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot;, instigated because the normal (until that time) church burial plots had become overcrowded. Since the 1990s it has been managed by the Friends of Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park, a registered charity, with the purpose of protecting, preserving and promoting this important space for conservation, heritage and community. 

The cemetery opened in 1841 and closed for burials in 1966. Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park today encompasses the original historic cemetery, bounded by historic walls, and additional pockets of land including &quot;Scrapyard Meadow&quot; and the Ackroyd Drive Greenlink. The overall site is today a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature and Conservation and an award-winning local nature reserve, including recognitions from Green Flag, London in Bloom and Tower Hamlets in Bloom. 

It was originally named The City of London and Tower Hamlets Cemetery but was called Bow Cemetery by locals for its Bow, London, locality. The cemetery pre-dates the creation of the modern Borough of Tower Hamlets in 1965, and instead takes its name from the original, older and somewhat larger, Tower Hamlets (or Tower division) – from which the modern borough also takes its name. The historic parish boundary which defines the Mile End and Bromley-by-Bow areas runs north to south through the park, with Mile End to the west and Bromley-by-Bow to the east.

==Location==
The Main Gate of Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park ( Cemetery Park) is at its northwest corner, at the intersection of Southern Grove road (which runs along the west of Cemetery Park) and the Hamlets Way pedestrian path (which runs along the north of the park). There are also smaller pedestrian gates along Hamlets Way and at the two ends of Cantrell Roada pedestrian and service road within Cemetery Parkwhere it meets with Bow Common Lane at the southwest corner of the park and with Knapp Road at the south center border of the park. The nearest tube stations are Mile End and Bow Road.

The site has been managed by the Friends of Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park, since becoming a UK registered charity in 1990. The Friends are headquartered at the Cemetery Park Lodge and also conduct a range of activities from the Soanes Centre. The Soanes Centre is the home of Setpoint London East, an outdoor educational charity that serves over 8,000 East London schoolchildren annually, and Kin Structures, a CIC that was invited by Setpoint London East in 2023 to partner with them. Both the Soanes Centre and Cemetery Park Lodge are located in the northwest corner of Cemetery Park, just inside the main entrance.

==History==
Before the Victorian era, all of London&#x27;s dead were buried in small urban churchyards, which became so overcrowded and so close to where people lived, worked, and worshipped that they were causing disease and ground water contamination.

An Act of Parliament was passed which allowed joint-stock companies to purchase land and set up large cemeteries outside the boundaries of the City of London ( the Square Mile). There were seven great cemeteries (the &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot;) laid out about the same time (1832–41). Highgate Cemetery is the most well known, with hundreds of notable interments; the others are Nunhead, West Norwood, Kensal Green, Brompton and Abney Park.

The City of London and Tower Hamlets Cemetery Company was made up of eleven wealthy directors whose occupations reflected the industries of the day: corn merchant, merchant ship broker and ship owner, timber merchant, and Lord Mayor of the City of London. The company bought of land and the cemetery was divided into a consecrated part for Anglican burials and an unconsecrated part for all other denominations.

Tower Hamlets Cemetery was formally consecrated by the Bishop of London Charles James Blomfield on Saturday 4 September 1841 prior to being opened for burials. The cemetery was consecrated in the morning; the first burial took place in the afternoon.
Tower Hamlets Cemetery was very popular with people from the East End and by 1889 247,000 bodies had been interred; the cemetery remained open for another 77 years. In the first two years 60% of the burials were in public graves and by 1851 this had increased to 80%. Public graves were the property of the company and were used to bury those whose families could not afford to buy a plot. Several persons, entirely unrelated to each other, could be buried in the same grave within the space of a few weeks. Allegedly some graves were dug 40 feet deep and contained up to 30 bodies.

The cemetery itself did not remain in a tidy and elegant state for long. Only 55 years after it was opened it was reported to be in a neglected state. During the Second World War the cemetery was bombed five times during raids on the City of London; both cemetery chapels were damaged and shrapnel damage can be seen on the graves by the Soanes Centre in the north-west corner of the park. Burials continued taking place until 1966, when the Greater London Council (G.L.C.) bought the company for £100,000 under the G.L.C.(General Powers) Act and the ground was closed for burials. The intention was to create an open space for the public and relevant parts of the cemetery were freed from the effects of consecration. In October 1967, a further £125,000 was spent clearing the chapels and of graves. Strong local opposition and problems of funding stopped the clearance.

==Today==
Tower Hamlets London Borough Council took over the ownership of the park in 1986. The Friends of Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park is an independent charity established in 1990, to preserve, protect and celebrate the site&#x27;s important role in conservation, heritage and community. The charity&#x27;s main objective is to encourage greater use of this inner urban green space as a sanctuary for people and a place of biodiversity. The Friends manage the park under a service-level agreement with the Borough.

The Cemetery Park was declared a Local Nature Reserve in May 2000, along with adjacent open land on Cantrell Road (&quot;Scrapyard Meadow&quot;) and Ackroyd Drive (&quot;Ackroyd Drive Greenlink&quot;). It has also been designated as a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation and a Conservation area. Two sections of the high brick walls which surround Cemetery Park (the west wall, including its gates and gate piers. and the east wall) are on the Historic England national register of listed buildings, as are seven individual monuments; all nine listings are Grade II. Though filled with gravestones and funerary monuments, the cemetery has been allowed to revert to resemble a natural woodland, with many wildflowers, birds, and insect species found in the park. There are several trails and walks created by the Friends of Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park.

The park is open 24 hours per day, although the Main Gate on Southern Grove is locked at dusk. Smaller foot gates around the park remain open for access.

<text>Cheburashka (), also known as Topple in earlier English translations, is a fictional character created by Soviet writer Eduard Uspensky in his 1965 children&#x27;s book &quot;Gena the Crocodile and His Friends&quot;. The character subsequently appeared as the protagonist in a series of stop-motion animated films directed by Roman Kachanov for Soyuzmultfilm, the first of which was made in 1969, with songs composed by Vladimir Shainsky.

Even today Cheburashka is still renowned in the former Soviet Union, and has been called the &quot;Soviet Mickey Mouse&quot; by external observers. Although only four short animated films have been produced featuring Cheburashka, he is still a national symbol in the former USSR and Russia, and is famous outside of it. One reason for his popularity is the message of his stories, which stress that where you&#x27;re from doesn&#x27;t matter as much as kindness.

==History==

Cheburashka is an iconic Russian cartoon-character who later became a popular figure in Russian jokes (along with his friend, Gena the Crocodile). According to the creator of the character, Eduard Uspensky, Cheburashka is an &quot;animal unknown to science&quot;, with large monkey-like ears and a body resembling that of a cub, who lives in a tropical forest. He accidentally gets into a crate of oranges, eats his fill, and falls asleep. The crate is eventually delivered to a grocery store in an unnamed Russian city (hinted to be Moscow), where the rest of the main story unfolds. 

The puzzled store manager finds the creature in the crate when he opens it; he takes him out and sits him on the table. The creature&#x27;s paws are numb after staying in the crate for so long, and he tumbles down (, a Russian colloquialism meaning &quot;tumbled&quot;) from the table, onto the chair, and then onto the floor. This inspires the store manager to name him &quot;Cheburashka&quot;. Words with this root were archaic in Russian; Uspensky gave them a new lease on life. &quot;The Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language&quot; (1882) of Vladimir Dahl gives the meaning of &quot;cheburashka&quot; as another name for the roly-poly toy.

Soviet censors tried to stifle the Cheburashka films, because they made fun of nitpicking bureaucrats, factory directors, and the Young Pioneers; Cheburashka and Gena couldn&#x27;t join the Young Pioneers because they didn&#x27;t know how to start a Pioneers&#x27; bonfire and could not march. The phrase &quot;only the best can be on the Pioneers&quot; was added as a compromise.

==Original series==
* 1. &quot;Gena the Crocodile&quot; (1969)
* 2. &quot;Cheburashka&quot; (1971)
* 3. &quot;Shapoklyak&quot; (1974)
* 4. &quot;Cheburashka Goes to School&quot; (1983)

==Follow-ups==
&quot;Cheburashka Arere?&quot; (, &quot;Cheburashka, huh?) was released by GoHands in Japan, 26 episodes, two-minute 2009–2010. Cheburashka was voiced by Nozomi Ōhashi, Gena by Hiroshi Tsuchida, Shapoklyak by Chō.

In 2007, the new animation, titled &quot;Cheburashka&quot; was announced by Ffango Entertoyment of South Korea and TV Tokyo Broadband and Frontier Works of Japan. Directed by Makoto Nakamura and written by and Michiru Shimada, premiered on 8 December 2010 in Japan. It consisted of four shorts. One (&quot;Hello Cheburashka&quot;) is a complete remake of the original &quot;Gena the Crocodile&quot; cartoon, while the three others (&quot;Cheburashka and the Circus&quot; and two episodes of &quot;Shapoklyak&#x27;s Consultation Center&quot;) have different stories.

The Russian-language compilation film of the Japanese remake shorts also titled premiered in Russia on 5 June 2014, but the distribution was temporarily revoked due to copyright dispute with Eduard Uspensky Later the distribution certificate was restored. The Russian titles of the episodes in it are «Чебурашка и цирк» (&quot;Cheburashka and the Circus&quot;), «Чебурашка идет в зоопарк» (&quot;Cheburashka Goes to the Zoo&quot;) и «Советы Шапокляк» (&quot;Advices of Shapoklyak&quot;).

A full-length film titled &quot;Cheburashka&quot;, directed by Dmitry Dyachenko, with Central Partnership and Yellow, Black and White producing, was released on 1 January 2023. &quot;Cheburashka&quot; is the highest grossing film in the Russian box office history. Olga Kuzmina voiced Cheburashka, while Sergei Garmash portrayed Gena, a gardener (the film version of Crocodile Gena).

=== Drutten och Jena ===

In the 1970s a number of children&#x27;s television shows, radio shows, records and magazines were produced in Sweden with the characters Drutten and crocodile Jena (Gena). These two characters were based on a couple of Cheburashka and Gena dolls bought on a trip to the Soviet Union, so they were visually identical to Cheburashka and Gena. &quot;Drutten&quot; means &quot;one who has tumbled down&quot;, as one meaning of the Swedish colloquial verb &quot;drutta&quot; is &quot;to fall or tumble down&quot;.

In the TV series , also &quot;Drutten och Krokodilen&quot;, the two characters sang and told different stories from those in the USSR, lived on a bookshelf rather than in a city and are hand puppets operated in live action rather than stop motion. Only occasionally Swedish public service TV would broadcast a segment of the Russian original, dubbed in Swedish. While many Swedes may visually recognize Cheburashka, they will generally not associate these characters with the ones Russian children know. The first episode premiered in 1973. Around 600 to 700 episodes were shown in Sweden in total, in a series of many years and the last episode was screened as a special in 1988. The animated series was broadcast on Sveriges Television.

==Characters==
===Cheburashka and friends===
Cheburashka is male, has a bear-like body, and is about the size of a 5-year-old child. He is a toddling creature with huge round ears on the side of his head that droop when he is discouraged. He has feet without legs, big black eyes, a snub nose. His voice is high-pitched and childlike. Cheburashka is an optimist as he only sees the best in people and is chirpy even in the gloomiest situation. Sergei Kapkov, animation historian and managing editor of Soyuzmultfilm, has said that Cheburashka &quot;is absolutely useless and hopeless. He is like a stranger who doesn&#x27;t understand a thing but just has one global idea, and that is to make friends and have others ... make friends with each other&quot;. For Leonid Katz, an art historian in Bar-Ilan University in Tel Aviv, Israel, Cheburashka represents the &quot;ideal&quot;. As he notes: &quot;In the film he is completely innocent. He represents all that was lost, all that was maybe impossible, all that was dreamed of&quot;.

After being turned down by the zoo as an &quot;animal unknown to science&quot;, Cheburashka gets hired as a window display for a discount store selling factory seconds because he resembles one, residing in a phone booth. In the tale, he befriends an anthropomorphic crocodile named Gena, who wears a hat, a bow tie, and a coat, and plays the accordion. Gena works in a zoo as a zoo animal. Gena&#x27;s favorite songs are &quot;Such a Pity that One&#x27;s Birthday Happens Only Once a Year&quot; and &quot;The Blue Train Car&quot;, both of which are extremely popular with children.

===Antagonist===
Cheburashka and Gena have their adventures made more difficult by a character named &quot;Старуха Шапокляк&quot; (Old Lady Shapoklyak). She is a mischievous but charming old lady. Shapoklyak is tall and thin, wears a &quot;chapeau claque&quot; hat and a dark-coloured dress, and carries around a pet rat, Lariska, in her purse to help her play pranks on people, though near the end of some stories she turns around and helps the protagonists. The refrain of her theme song contains her motto, &quot;One won&#x27;t ever get famous for good deeds&quot; .

==Copyright issues==

The rights to the Cheburashka character and image have been heavily debated in court. In 1994, Eduard Uspensky (the writer) copyrighted the character&#x27;s name and image and proceeded to sell the rights to various countries. Leonid Shvartsman, the art director of the animated films, has tried to prove in court that he was the creator of Cheburashka&#x27;s visual appearance and that this copyright should be separate from the rights for the literary character. On 13 March 2007, Shvartsman and his lawyer lost a 4.7 million ruble lawsuit against BRK Cosmetics and Eduard Uspensky. Shvartsman alleged that Uspensky illegally sold the rights to the Cheburashka image (which was allegedly not his to sell) to BRK Cosmetics, which used it on toothpaste packaging. The defence argued that the artist who drew the character for the toothpaste had never seen the animated films and had created the character himself after the impressions left from reading Uspensky&#x27;s books. Shvartsman argued that the character on the packets was allegedly an exact copy of the one in the animated films. 

==Cheburashka sightings==

Cheburashka is now a staple of Russian cartoons, and there are several licensed products on the market, such as children&#x27;s joke books and stuffed toys. He is also one of the few Russian animation characters to be the subject of numerous Russian jokes and riddles. The popularity of Cheburashka grew a lot after it became an animated film.

The word &quot;Cheburashka&quot; is also used in a figurative sense to name objects that somehow resemble the creature (such as an An-72 aircraft which, when seen from the front, resembles the character&#x27;s head) or are just as pleasing as it is (e.g. a colloquial name for a small bottle of lemonadefrom the brand name &quot;Cheburashka&quot;). There is also a rocket launcher called Cheburashka, used during the Russo-Ukrainian war.

In the 1990 satirical claymation film &quot;Grey Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, produced by Garri Bardin, Grey Wolf eats Gena and Cheburashka, along with other fantasy characters.

Cheburashka was chosen as the official mascot with the main mascots for the Russian Olympic Team in the following games:
* 2004 Summer Olympics in Greece
* 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy (with white fur)
* 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China (with red fur)
* 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada (with blue fur)

&quot;Cheburashka&quot; also became known in some countries outside the former Soviet Union (and of the Soviet Bloc). He became very popular in Japan after an animated film series about him was shown in 15 cinemas all over Japan and was watched by about 700,000 between summer 2001 and spring 2002. In 2008, the Cheburashka films (as part of the &quot;Ghibli Museum Library&quot;) were made available to Japanese cinemas on the same date as Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea&quot;. An English-dubbed edition of the first 3 animated films was released in 1987, titled &quot;The Adventures of Charlie and Cubby&quot;. 

During the 2018 Armenian protests Cheburashka was used from many protesters as a symbol to mock Serzh Sargsyan due to the similarity on their appearance. Among others, during a protest, a protester masqueraded as Cheburashka urged Sargsyan to resign, while another one lit his on fire.

<text>The Somme ( , ; ) is a river in Picardy, northern France.

The river is in length, from its source in the high ground of the former at Fonsomme near Saint-Quentin, to the Bay of the Somme, in the English Channel. It lies in the geological syncline which also forms the Solent. This gives it a fairly constant and gentle gradient where several fluvial terraces have been identified.

==Name==
The Somme river was known in ancient times as &quot;Samara&quot;. It presumably means &#x27;the summery river&#x27;, that is to say the &#x27;quiet river&#x27;, stemming from an adjective *&quot;sam-aro&quot;- (&#x27;summery&#x27;) itself derived from the Celtic root *&quot;samo&quot;- (&#x27;summer&#x27;).

The city of Amiens was also known as &quot;Samarobriva&quot; (Gaulish: &#x27;bridge on the Samara&#x27;). It is attested by the early 1st century BC as the chief town of the Ambiani, an ancient Gallic tribe of the region. The modern department of Somme was named after this river.

==History==

The Somme has featured prominently in several military campaigns. In 1066, the invasion fleet of William the Conqueror assembled in the Bay of the Somme, at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme. The river also featured in the 1346 withdrawal of Edward III of England&#x27;s army, which forded the river at the Battle of Blanchetaque during the campaign, which culminated in the Battle of Crécy. Crossing the river also featured prominently in the campaign which led to the Battle of Agincourt in 1415.

In 1636, a Spanish army led by Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano, crossed the Somme defeating a French army during the Thirty Years War threatening Paris.

Most famously, the Battle of the Somme, during World War I, lasted from July to November 1916 and resulted in more than a million casualties. Private A. S. Bullock in his wartime memoir recalled his first sight of it in early April 1918: &quot;... we reached a small place called Hengest sur Somme. The train stopped and we descended. There in front of us was a muddy, sluggish and somewhat narrow stream, which has given its name to one of the most awful battles in history – the Somme.&quot; The great battles that finally stopped the German advance in the Spring Offensive of 1918 were fought around the valley of the Somme in places like Villers Bretonneux, which marked the beginning of the end of the war.

==Départements and towns along the river==
* Aisne: Saint-Quentin
* Somme : Ham, Péronne, Corbie, Amiens, Abbeville, Saint-Valery-sur-Somme, Le Crotoy


== Tributaries ==
The tributaries listed comprise:
==Hydrology==
The river is characterized by a very gentle gradient and a steady flow. The valley is more or less steep-sided but its bottom is flat with fens and pools. These characteristics of steady flow and flooded valley bottom arise from the river&#x27;s being fed by the ground water in the chalk basin in which it lies. At earlier, colder times, from the Günz to the Würm (Beestonian or Nebraskan to Devensian or Wisconsinian) the river has cut down into the Cretaceous geology to a level below the modern water table. The valley bottom has now therefore, filled with water which, in turn, has filled with fen. , of the source of the Somme in 1986, shows it when the water table had fallen below the surface of the chalk in which the aquifer lies. Here, the flow of water had been sufficient to keep fen from forming.

One of the fens, the &quot;Marais de l&#x27;Île&quot; is a nature reserve in the town of St.Quentin. The traditional market gardens of Amiens, the &quot;Hortillonages&quot; are on this sort of land but drained. Once exploited for peat cutting, the fen is now used for fishing and shooting

In 2001, the Somme valley was affected by particularly high floods, which were in large part due to a rise in the water table of the surrounding land.

== Navigation and canals ==

The construction of the &quot;Canal de la Somme&quot; began in 1770 and reached completion in 1843. It is long, beginning at St.Simon and opening into the Bay of the Somme. From St.Simon to Froissy (near Bray sur Somme, south of Albert), the canal is alongside the river. Thence to the sea, the river is partly river and partly navigation. From Abbeville, it is diverted through the silted, former estuary, to Saint-Valery-sur-Somme, where the maritime canal, once called the canal du Duc d&#x27;Angoulême enters the English Channel.

The St Quentin Canal, famous for the 1918 battle, links the Somme to northern France and Belgium and southward to the Oise. The Canal du Nord also links the Somme to the Oise, at Noyon, thence to Paris.

<doc id="881423" wikidata="Q595710" url="?curid=881423" title="Blade server">
<text>A blade server is a stripped-down server computer with a modular design optimized to minimize the use of physical space and energy. Blade servers have many components removed to save space, minimize power consumption and other considerations, while still having all the functional components to be considered a computer. Unlike a rack-mount server, a blade server fits inside a blade enclosure, which can hold multiple blade servers, providing services such as power, cooling, networking, various interconnects and management. Together, blades and the blade enclosure form a blade system, which may itself be rack-mounted. Different blade providers have differing principles regarding what to include in the blade itself, and in the blade system as a whole.

In a &quot;standard&quot; server-rack configuration, one rack unit or 1U— wide and tall—defines the minimum possible size of any equipment. The principal benefit and justification of blade computing relates to lifting this restriction so as to reduce size requirements. The most common computer rack form-factor is 42U high, which limits the number of discrete computer devices directly mountable in a rack to 42 components. Blades do not have this limitation. , densities of up to 180 servers per blade system (or 1440 servers per rack) are achievable with blade systems.

== Blade enclosure ==
The enclosure (or chassis) performs many of the non-core computing services found in most computers. Non-blade systems typically use bulky, hot and space-inefficient components, and may duplicate these across many computers that may or may not perform at capacity. By locating these services in one place and sharing them among the blade computers, the overall utilization becomes higher. The specifics of which services are provided varies by vendor.

=== Power ===
Computers operate over a range of DC voltages, but utilities deliver power as AC, and at higher voltages than required within computers. Converting this current requires one or more power supply units (or PSUs). To ensure that the failure of one power source does not affect the operation of the computer, even entry-level servers often have redundant power supplies, again adding to the bulk and heat output of the design.

The blade enclosure&#x27;s power supply provides a single power source for all blades within the enclosure. This single power source may come as a power supply in the enclosure or as a dedicated separate PSU supplying DC to multiple enclosures. This setup reduces the number of PSUs required to provide a resilient power supply.

The popularity of blade servers, and their own appetite for power, has led to an increase in the number of rack-mountable uninterruptible power supply (or UPS) units, including units targeted specifically towards blade servers (such as the BladeUPS).

=== Cooling ===
During operation, electrical and mechanical components produce heat, which a system must dissipate to ensure the proper functioning of its components. Most blade enclosures, like most computing systems, remove heat by using fans.

A frequently underestimated problem when designing high-performance computer systems involves the conflict between the amount of heat a system generates and the ability of its fans to remove the heat. The blade&#x27;s shared power and cooling means that it does not generate as much heat as traditional servers. blade-enclosures feature variable-speed fans and control logic, or even liquid cooling systems that adjust to meet the system&#x27;s cooling requirements.

At the same time, the increased density of blade-server configurations can still result in higher overall demands for cooling with racks populated at over 50% full. This is especially true with early-generation blades. In absolute terms, a fully populated rack of blade servers is likely to require more cooling capacity than a fully populated rack of standard 1U servers. This is because one can fit up to 128 blade servers in the same rack that will only hold 42 1U rack-mount servers.

=== Networking ===

Blade servers generally include integrated or optional network interface controllers for Ethernet or host adapters for Fibre Channel storage systems or converged network adapter to combine storage and data via one Fibre Channel over Ethernet interface. In many blades, at least one interface is embedded on the motherboard and extra interfaces can be added using mezzanine cards.

A blade enclosure can provide individual external ports to which each network interface on a blade will connect. Alternatively, a blade enclosure can aggregate network interfaces into interconnect devices (such as switches) built into the blade enclosure or in networking blades.

== Storage ==

While computers typically use hard disks to store operating systems, applications and data, these are not necessarily required locally. Many storage connection methods (e.g. FireWire, SATA, E-SATA, SCSI, SAS DAS, FC and iSCSI) are readily moved outside the server, though not all are used in enterprise-level installations. Implementing these connection interfaces within the computer presents similar challenges to the networking interfaces (indeed iSCSI runs over the network interface), and similarly these can be removed from the blade and presented individually or aggregated either on the chassis or through other blades.

The ability to boot the blade from a storage area network (SAN) allows for an entirely disk-free blade, an example of which implementation is the Intel Modular Server System.

== Other blades ==

Since blade enclosures provide a standard method for delivering basic services to computer devices, other types of devices can also utilize blade enclosures. Blades providing switching, routing, storage, SAN and fibre-channel access can slot into the enclosure to provide these services to all members of the enclosure.

Systems administrators can use storage blades where a requirement exists for additional local storage.

== Uses ==

Blade servers function well for specific purposes such as web hosting, virtualization, and cluster computing. Individual blades are typically hot-swappable. As users deal with larger and more diverse workloads, they add more processing power, memory and I/O bandwidth to blade servers.
Although blade-server technology in theory allows for open, cross-vendor systems, most users buy modules, enclosures, racks and management tools from the same vendor.

Eventual standardization of the technology might result in more choices for consumers; increasing numbers of third-party software vendors have started to enter this growing field.

Blade servers do not, however, provide the answer to every computing problem. One can view them as a form of productized server-farm that borrows from mainframe packaging, cooling, and power-supply technology. Very large computing tasks may still require server farms of blade servers, and because of blade servers&#x27; high power density, can suffer even more acutely from the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning problems that affect large conventional server farms.

Developers first placed complete microcomputers on cards and packaged them in standard 19-inch racks in the 1970s, soon after the introduction of 8-bit microprocessors. This architecture was used in the industrial process control industry as an alternative to minicomputer-based control systems. Early models stored programs in EPROM and were limited to a single function with a small real-time executive.

The VMEbus architecture () defined a computer interface that included implementation of a board-level computer installed in a chassis backplane with multiple slots for pluggable boards to provide I/O, memory, or additional computing.

In the 1990s, the PCI Industrial Computer Manufacturers Group PICMG developed a chassis/blade structure for the then emerging Peripheral Component Interconnect bus PCI called CompactPCI. CompactPCI was actually invented by Ziatech Corp of San Luis Obispo, CA and developed into an industry standard. Common among these chassis-based computers was the fact that the entire chassis was a single system. While a chassis might include multiple computing elements to provide the desired level of performance and redundancy, there was always one master board in charge, or two redundant fail-over masters coordinating the operation of the entire system. Moreover, this system architecture provided management capabilities not present in typical rack mount computers, much more like in ultra-high reliability systems, managing power supplies, cooling fans as well as monitoring health of other internal components.

Demands for managing hundreds and thousands of servers in the emerging Internet Data Centers where the manpower simply didn&#x27;t exist to keep pace a new server architecture was needed. In 1998 and 1999 this new Blade Server Architecture was developed at Ziatech based on their Compact PCI platform to house as many as 14 &quot;blade servers&quot; in a standard 19&quot; 9U high rack mounted chassis, allowing in this configuration as many as 84 servers in a standard 84 Rack Unit 19&quot; rack. What this new architecture brought to the table was a set of new interfaces to the hardware specifically to provide the capability to remotely monitor the health and performance of all major replaceable modules that could be changed/replaced while the system was in operation. The ability to change/replace or add modules within the system while it is in operation is known as Hot-Swap. Unique to any other server system the Ketris Blade servers routed Ethernet across the backplane (where server blades would plug-in) eliminating more than 160 cables in a single 84 Rack Unit high 19&quot; rack. For a large data center tens of thousands of Ethernet cables, prone to failure would be eliminated. Further this architecture provided the capabilities to inventory modules installed in the system remotely in each system chassis without the blade servers operating. This architecture enabled the ability to provision (power up, install operating systems and applications software) (e.g. a Web Servers) remotely from a Network Operations Center (NOC). The system architecture when this system was announced was called Ketris, named after the Ketri Sword, worn by nomads in such a way as to be drawn very quickly as needed. First envisioned by Dave Bottom and developed by an engineering team at Ziatech Corp in 1999 and demonstrated at the Networld+Interop show in May 2000. Patents were awarded for the Ketris blade server architecture. In October 2000 Ziatech was acquired by Intel Corp and the Ketris Blade Server systems would become a product of the Intel Network Products Group.

PICMG expanded the CompactPCI specification with the use of standard Ethernet connectivity between boards across the backplane. The PICMG 2.16 CompactPCI Packet Switching Backplane specification was adopted in Sept 2001. This provided the first open architecture for a multi-server chassis.

The Second generation of Ketris would be developed at Intel as an architecture for the telecommunications industry to support the build out of IP base telecom services and in particular the LTE (Long Term Evolution) Cellular Network build-out. PICMG followed with this larger and more feature-rich AdvancedTCA specification, targeting the telecom industry&#x27;s need for a high availability and dense computing platform with extended product life (10+ years). While AdvancedTCA system and boards typically sell for higher prices than blade servers, the operating cost (manpower to manage and maintain) are dramatically lower, where operating cost often dwarf the acquisition cost for traditional servers. AdvancedTCA promote them for telecommunications customers, however in the real world implementation in Internet Data Centers where thermal as well as other maintenance and operating cost had become prohibitively expensive, this blade server architecture with remote automated provisioning, health and performance monitoring and management would be a significantly less expensive operating cost.

The first commercialized blade-server architecture was invented by Christopher Hipp and David Kirkeby, and their patent was assigned to Houston-based RLX Technologies. RLX, which consisted primarily of former Compaq Computer Corporation employees, including Hipp and Kirkeby, shipped its first commercial blade server in 2001. RLX was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2005.

The name &quot;blade server&quot; appeared when a card included the processor, memory, I/O and non-volatile program storage (flash memory or small hard disk(s)). This allowed manufacturers to package a complete server, with its operating system and applications, on a single card/board/blade. These blades could then operate independently within a common chassis, doing the work of multiple separate server boxes more efficiently. In addition to the most obvious benefit of this packaging (less space consumption), additional efficiency benefits have become clear in power, cooling, management, and networking due to the pooling or sharing of common infrastructure to support the entire chassis, rather than providing each of these on a per server box basis.

In 2011, research firm IDC identified the major players in the blade market as HP, IBM, Cisco, and Dell. Other companies selling blade servers include Supermicro, Hitachi.

== Blade models ==

The prominent brands in the blade server market are Supermicro, Cisco Systems, HPE, Dell and IBM, though the latter sold its x86 server business to Lenovo in 2014 after selling its consumer PC line to Lenovo in 2005.

In 2009, Cisco announced blades in its Unified Computing System product line, consisting of 6U high chassis, up to 8 blade servers in each chassis. It had a heavily modified Nexus 5K switch, rebranded as a fabric interconnect, and management software for the whole system.
HP&#x27;s initial line consisted of two chassis models, the c3000 which holds up to 8 half-height ProLiant line blades (also available in tower form), and the c7000 (10U) which holds up to 16 half-height ProLiant blades. Dell&#x27;s product, the M1000e is a 10U modular enclosure and holds up to 16 half-height PowerEdge blade servers or 32 quarter-height blades.

<doc id="881426" wikidata="Q22996" url="?curid=881426" title="Federweisser">
<text>Federweisser (also Federweißer) is an alcoholic beverage commonly made in continental Europe. It is the product of fermented freshly pressed grape juice, known as must. The term &quot;Federweisser&quot; in principle includes all stages of fermentation, from must to finished wine. It is typically 9% alcohol by volume, although versions of up to 13.5% alcohol by volume are not uncommon. In contrast to all other alcoholic beverages, the alcohol content stated on a bottle of Federweisser is inconclusive, and presents an uppermost limit, not the actual content at any given time.

Across Europe, it is known as &quot;Suser&quot;, &quot;Sauser&quot;, &quot;Neuer Süßer&quot; (&#x27;sweet&#x27; or &#x27;new sweet&#x27;), or &quot;Junger Wein&quot; (&#x27;young wine&#x27;) in Southwest Germany, Switzerland and South Tyrol, &quot;Fiederwäissen&quot; in Luxembourg, &quot;Sturm&quot; (&#x27;storm&#x27;) in Austria, &quot;Federweißer&quot; in Bavaria, &quot;Neuer Wein&quot; (&#x27;new wine&#x27;) in the Palatinate, &quot;Federweißer&quot; in Franconia, &quot;burčiak&quot; in Slovakia, &quot;burčák&quot; in Czech Republic, or in France, or in Hungary, &quot;მაჭარი&quot; (machari) in Georgia, and &quot;մաճառ&quot; (machar) in Armenia.

In Switzerland, the term &quot;Federweisser&quot; has a different meaning. There, it refers to a white wine made from red grapes, typically pinot noir.

== Differences in the German-speaking world ==

=== Germany ===
In Germany, Federweißer, Neuer Wein and Bitzler are the most common generic terms. Federweißer is made from white grape must, and the Federroter variant is from red grape must. The next stage before the finished fermented wine is called young wine for all grape varieties.

Around the middle of the 19th century, the German Dictionary of the Brothers Grimm suggested that the name &quot;Federweißer&quot; was derived from the old term &quot;Federweiß&quot; for alum, which was previously added to wine as a preservative. However, as such agents are only added at later stages of maturation, it is now assumed that the yeast cells, which &quot;Federweißer&quot; contains as a suspended matter as any partially fermented grape must, gave it its name due to its feather(&quot;Feder&quot;)-white(&quot;Weiss&quot;) colour. In German, the word is declined like &quot;der Weiße&quot;, i.e. “man trinkt den Federweißen”.

=== Austria ===
In Austria, the terms &quot;Federweißer, Federroter, Neuer Wein&quot; and &quot;Bitzler&quot; are not used. According to Austrian wine law, partially fermented grape must, regardless of colour, be called &quot;Sturm&quot; and there are several regional specialities with their own names:

In Styria, the cloudy pink to violet-coloured &quot;Schilchersturm&quot; is produced. This partially fermented grape must is made from the &quot;Blauer Wildbacher&quot; grape variety, which is traditionally used to make the rosé wine &quot;Schilcher&quot;.

In eastern Austria, a distinction is also made between &quot;Staubigen&quot; or &quot;Gestaubten&quot;, which represents the next stage of maturity from &quot;Sturm&quot; to &quot;Heurigen&quot;.

In southern &quot;Burgenland&quot;, &quot;Uhudler&quot;, a light red to rosé-coloured blended wine made from certain grape varieties, is also offered in its early stages as (white, red or rosé) &quot;Uhudlersturm&quot;.

In Austria, it is customary not to say &quot;&quot;Prost&quot; when drinking the &quot;Sturm&quot;. If the grape juice has not yet fermented, &quot;Mahlzeit&quot; or &quot;Krixikraxi&quot;&quot; is said instead. Anyone who disregards this must &quot;buy a round&quot; as a punishment. The glasses of the &quot;unbaptised&quot; storm are held in the left hand and not clinked. Only when the grape juice has fully fermented and the wine has been &quot;baptised&quot;, which is the case from St Martin&#x27;s Day (11 November) onwards, may &quot;Prost&quot; be said.

=== Switzerland ===
In Switzerland, both the white and red versions of partially fermented grape must are usually called &quot;Sauser&quot;. &quot;Federweisser&quot; does not refer to partially fermented grape must, but to white wine or sparkling wine made from red grapes, i.e. Blanc de Noirs.

== Production ==

=== Grape Varieties ===
In early autumn in particular, some fermented grape must is produced from early-ripening grape varieties such as Bacchus, Ortega or Siegerrebe specifically for consumption at this stage; large-scale producers sometimes also use must from southern Europe, which is delivered in tankers. As autumn approaches and grapes ripen, any grape variety can be used. Red varieties are mainly produced in classic red wine regions such as the Ahr, but also in other wine-growing regions. Early-ripening red varieties such as Pinot Noir Précoce or Dornfelder are particularly suitable.

=== Fermentation ===

Once yeast has been added, grapes begin to ferment rapidly. The sugar contained in the grapes is broken down into alcohol and carbon dioxide (glycolysis). As soon as an alcohol content of four percent has been reached, Federweißer may be sold. It continues to ferment until all the sugar has been broken down and an alcohol content of about ten percent has been reached.

== Marketing ==
Partially fermented grape must can be sold from an alcohol content of around 4%. It continues to ferment until most of the sugar it contains has been converted into alcohol and then has an alcohol content of around 11%.

Due to the rapid progression of fermentation, partially fermented grape must can only be stored for a short time, even when refrigerated and should be used up after a few days. Because new carbon dioxide is constantly being produced, the containers must not be sealed airtight, otherwise they would burst. As the open containers could only be stored upright and fermentation could not be delayed due to a lack of effective cooling, transport over longer distances was not possible in the past. Partially fermented grape must was therefore known almost exclusively in the wine-growing regions.

This is where it is still sold directly by winegrowers on the street today, as well as where most of the early wine festivals took place, some of which are known as &quot;Bitzlerfeste&quot; in the Palatinate, for example. The two largest German events of this kind, at which the partially fermented grape must plays a role alongside the matured grape must and which attract hundreds of thousands of visitors, are the German Grape Harvest Festival in Neustadt an der Weinstraße with the election of the German Wine Queen and the Federweißen Festival in Landau in der Pfalz, at which the new vintage is christened.

Depending on the start of the grape harvest, partially fermented grape must is available in shops and restaurants from the beginning of September to the end of October. By storing harvested grapes in a cool place and processing them later, some winegrowers extend the sales period into November or even December. In Austria, the wine law states that Sturm may be sold from 1 August to 31 December and must have an alcohol content of at least 1%.

== As a beverage ==
Due to the carbonation, Federweißer tastes quite refreshing, not unlike a light grape soda or a sweet sparkling wine. As fermentation progresses, however, Federweißer may increasingly assume a darker, often amber-like or light brown hue. In general, Federweißer is made from white grapes; when made from red grapes, the drink is called &quot;Federroter&quot;, &quot;Roter Sauser&quot;, or &quot;Roter Rauscher&quot;. Federroter is less common than Federweißer. Because of rapid fermentation, Federweißer can not be stored for long and should be consumed within a few days of purchase. As carbonic acid is constantly produced, the bottles can not be sealed airtight and have a permeable lid (they would burst otherwise). They must be stored in an upright position to allow the gas to continuously escape from the bottle and to prevent spilling. Federweißer also contains lactic acid bacteria and a high proportion of vitamins B1 and B2. It has a strong effect on the function of the intestine, especially on its peristalsis.

Depending on the date of the grape harvest, it is available from early September to late October, and is generally served together with savoury food. The classic combination is Federweißer and Zwiebelkuchen, although Federweißer and chestnuts is also popular. . In the south-western part of Germany and neighboring Alsace, it is accompanied by Flammkuchen.

Federweißer contains yeast, lactic acid bacteria, and a large amount of vitamin B1 and B2.

<text>Slovakia is a landlocked country in Central Europe. The capital and largest city is Bratislava. The official language is Slovak.

Slovakia is a high-income advanced economy with a very high Human Development Index, a very high standard of living and performs favourably in measurements of civil liberties, press freedom, internet freedom, democratic governance and peacefulness. The country maintains a combination of market economy with universal health care and a comprehensive social security system. The country joined the European Union in 2004 and the Eurozone on 1 January 2009. Slovakia is also a member of the Schengen Area, NATO, the United Nations, the OECD, the WTO, CERN, the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the Visegrád Group. The Slovak economy is one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe and 3rd fastest in eurozone. Its legal tender, the Euro, is the world&#x27;s 2nd most traded currency. Although regional income inequality is high, 90% of citizens own their homes. In 2016, Slovak citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 165 countries and territories, ranking the Slovak passport 11th in the world. Slovakia is the world&#x27;s biggest per-capita car producer with a total of 1,040,000 cars manufactured in the country in 2016 alone. The car industry represents 43 percent of Slovakia&#x27;s industrial output, and a quarter of its exports.

<doc id="881436" wikidata="Q7650235" url="?curid=881436" title="Sutton Coldfield transmitting station">
<text>The Sutton Coldfield transmitting station is a broadcasting and telecommunications facility located in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, England. In terms of population covered, it is the third most important transmitter in the UK, after Crystal Palace in London and Winter Hill near Bolton.

==History==

On 17 December 1949, it became the first television transmitter to broadcast outside London and the Home Counties, bringing BBC Television to viewers outside of the south-east of England for the first time. 

In 1949 the site housed Britain&#x27;s first post-war Band 1 405 line television transmitter. When it was taken out of service in 1981 it was one of the oldest working television transmitters in the world. It was actually two transmitters combined into a single antenna: T1 was a Marconi 12 kW sound transmitter of conventional design. T2 was the 50 kW vision transmitter. Its unusual design used high-level modulation dc-coupled to the final RF stage&#x27;s grid. The modulator stages were built by EMI, most of the RF stages by Marconi and the power supplies by Metropolitan-Vickers. They were later supplemented by two Marconi medium-power reserves: T3 2kW sound and T4 5kW vision. 

For most of 1965, it had a low-power BBC2 service; this was turned onto full power on 4 October 1965; the East Midlands had no BBC2 service until Waltham began transmissions on 31 August 1968.

A new mast was built around 1983 to replace the original structure, primarily to support new mixed-polarisation FM antennas.

A tall temporary mast was erected alongside the 1983 mast in the spring of 2009 while the latter&#x27;s height was increased by to . After four years in service and almost a year after the completion of digital switch over, the temporary mast was removed during August 2013.

All analogue TV transmissions ceased on 21 September 2011, as part of the digital switchover. This made it one of the oldest transmitters in the country to formally end analogue broadcasts.

==Services==
With a mast height of , it is one of the most powerful transmitters in England, powered at 200 kilowatts ERP for digital television and 250 kW for FM radio. The coverage extends as far south as Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire and as far north as Stoke-on-Trent. However, there are many relay transmitters around the Midlands that extend coverage even further.

The transmitter broadcasts eight digital television multiplexes, as well as VHF or FM transmitters for the four BBC national stations; the BBC&#x27;s local service BBC WM on FM and DAB; independent national station Classic FM and local commercial radio stations Hits Radio Birmingham, Heart West Midlands, Greatest Hits West Midlands (previously Kerrang 105.2 until June 2013, Planet Rock until September 2015, and Absolute Radio until December 2018) and Smooth West Midlands.

When opened as a UHF TV transmitter, Sutton Coldfield was a B grouping, but with the advent of digital broadcasting one of the six muxes could not be fitted into the original B group due to co-channel considerations. Thus mux 6 was transmitted slightly out of band on UHF Channel 55, though this would still be receivable on most B group aerials as this graph makes clear. In July 2007, it was confirmed by Ofcom that Sutton Coldfield would return to an undisputed B group transmitter post-digital switchover; a process that was completed on 21 September 2011.

An MF transmitter for Radio Birmingham (now BBC WM) used to be installed at this site, but could only be operated at 5 kW instead of the planned 10 kW because of interference to video equipment on the site. It was eventually replaced with a transmitter at the nearby Langley Mill MF site owned by Arqiva. This transmitter is currently used for the BBC Asian Network.

The station is now owned by Arqiva.

====Analogue====
Analogue television signals are no longer broadcast from Sutton Coldfield as of 21 September 2011.
== Relays ==
The transmitter is served by a set of 35 local relays, delivering signals to areas shaded from it by hills and the curve of the Earth. These are:

==Digital switchover==
Digital switchover took place at Sutton Coldfield in September 2011. In preparation for this, major engineering works took place at the station. The mast height was increased from to and the UHF television antennas were replaced. This was accomplished through the use of a temporary mast constructed to broadcast all the area&#x27;s services so that the main mast could be worked on &#x27;cold&#x27;.

As at other stations, the digital switchover took place in two stages:

In the first stage (7 September 2011):

* BBC Two analogue (Channel 40) closed down
* Low-power BBC multiplex (Mux 1) on channel 41 closed down
* Low-power SDN multiplex (Mux A) moved from channel 47 to channel 41 (until stage 2)
* ITV analogue moved from channel 43 to channel 40 (until stage 2)
* High-power multiplex BBC A started on channel 43

In the second stage (21 September 2011):

* BBC One analogue (Channel 46) closed down
* ITV analogue (Channel 40) closed down
* Channel 4 analogue (Channel 50) closed down
* Mux 1 (C41), Mux 2 (C44), Mux A (C47), Mux B (C51), Mux C (C52) and Mux D (C55) closed down
* All multiplexes increased in power to 200,000 watts (200 kW)
* New multiplexes came on air: SDN on C42, Arqiva A on C45, Arqiva B on C39, Digital 3&amp;4 on C46 and BBC B on C40.

HD broadcasts were moved from the Lichfield transmitter to Sutton Coldfield on the BBC B multiplex (C40, 626.2 MHz). The Lichfield transmitter ceased the broadcast of all television services (Analogue Channel 5 and Digital BBC B (Mux HD)), with all six multiplexes being broadcast from Sutton Coldfield.

<text>Eastern European cuisine encompasses many different cultures, ethnicities, languages, and histories of Eastern Europe.

The cuisine of the region is strongly influenced by its climate and still varies, depending on a country. For example, East Slavic countries of the Sarmatic Plain (Belarusian, Russian and Ukrainian cuisine) show many similarities.

==Characteristics==
According to the &quot;Ethnic Food Lover&#x27;s Companion&quot;, all significant Eastern European cuisines are closely connected with the political, social and economic revival of the region, following the long periods of historical turmoil. &quot;These are substantial cuisines, meaty, rooty, smoky – part comfort food, part extravagance.&quot; Their main ingredients include eggs, used most frequently in doughs and pastries; dairy products (with yogurt and cheese among the staples); grains, including rye, barley, wheat, buckwheat and millet used in kashas and in the making of breads; vegetables, in cold storage and in pickling; fish (salmon, pike, carp and herring), birds and poultry (chicken, duck, goose, partridge, quail, turkey); red meats such as veal, beef, pork and mutton; and plentiful fruits including pears, plums, cherries, raspberries, pomegranates, dates, and figs, used for desserts and a variety of liqueurs. The nutritional index of traditional dishes is generally high cholesterol, high sodium, and high fat.

<text>Barleycove or Barley Cove () is a bay and beach in County Cork, on the south coast of Ireland. It is situated close to Mizen Head on the Mizen Peninsula, with Crookhaven or Goleen being the nearest villages. The beach is part of an area designated as one of several Special Areas of Conservation in Ireland (or SACs) under the European Union&#x27;s Habitats Directive, due to the variety of wildlife and habitats in the sand dunes.

==History==
Barley Cove beach lies within Mallavoge townland. Evidence of ancient settlement in Mallavoge townland includes a number of ringfort and promontory fort sites at Brow Head.

The dunes at Barley Cove originate from large waves, triggered on 1 November 1755, by an earthquake and tsunami in Lisbon, Portugal. It was reported in the &quot;Cork Journal&quot; of 2 November 1755 that 15 ft waves were experienced as a result of this event. A side-effect of the tsunami is Barley Cove&#x27;s dune system, as much of the beach&#x27;s sand was deposited by these large waves.

==Conservation area==

The area between Barley Cove and Ballyrisode Point (the Barley Cove to Ballyrisode Point SAC) has been designated as a legally protected Special Area of Conservation (SAC) under a number of qualifying Natura 2000 criteria.

The conservation area, which extends significantly beyond Barley Cove bay and covers a 10 km stretch of coastline eastwards to Toormore Bay, was proposed as a Site of Community Importance (SCI) in 2002. It was designated as a Special Area of Conservation in 2018.

<text>Björn Gustaf von Sydow (born 26 November 1945) is a former speaker (&quot;talman&quot;) of the Riksdag, the Swedish parliament. He held this office following the 2002 election, when he succeeded Birgitta Dahl, until he was replaced on 2 October 2006. A member of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, he had been Minister of Defence in Göran Persson&#x27;s government between 1997 and 2002, preceded by a short term as Minister of Commerce and Industry.

Apart from leading the Riksdag sessions, von Sydow was also while in office eligible to serve as acting-regent (&quot;Riksföreståndare&quot;) in the absence of the King and his three children, &quot;e.g.&quot; if they all went abroad simultaneously, although that never happened.

The speaker also had a key role when the government resigned. However, when Göran Persson asked for his resignation after the lost 2006 election, the parliamentary situation was very clear, so already on 19 September 2006 Sydow could formally ask Fredrik Reinfeldt to begin the formation of a new government to take office after the new Riksdag has assembled to approve it. On 2 October 2006, the changed majority situation in the Riksdag also had Sydow replaced by Moderate Party politician and previous Vice Speaker Per Westerberg. Already before the election, Sydow had stated that he was not interested in a Vice Speaker position, so that office went to fellow Social Democrat Jan Björkman.

von Sydow was awarded a Ph.D. in political science at Linköping University in 1978, and later worked as rector of the Social Work College at Stockholm University. In 2008, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Björn von Sydow has taken his mother&#x27;s surname and is a distant relative of the actor Max von Sydow. He lives in Solna outside Stockholm, is married and has four children.

<doc id="881453" wikidata="Q5072777" url="?curid=881453" title="Chaos 2">
<text>Chaos 2 is a combat robot from the UK Television Series Robot Wars, designed and built by self-employed mechanic George Francis, from Ipswich, and operated by Team Chaos. Twice winner of the UK Robot Wars Championship and the only robot with that distinction, it was the first robot to use its flipper to throw its opponents out of the arena altogether. This machine was also the first to defeat Hypno-Disc in Series 3. Its flipper is commonly considered to be one of the most powerful in Robot Wars, although it is not as powerful as the catapult-style flipper of Wheely Big Cheese. However, its weapon is superior in terms of efficiency, but has a limited supply of , which provides the power for the weapon. The robot has been reincarnated several times over the years, previously appearing as Robot The Bruce and Chaos. Its flipper was also used as a self-righting mechanism when the robot was inverted, flipping the entire robot over in a half-somersault so it could continue fighting.

Chaos 2 is an inaugural member of the Combat Robot Hall of Fame. It also has its own pullback toy, pullback minibot and DVD.

Team Chaos had a small rivalry with Team Mace. The two teams first met in the Heat Final of Series 2. Mace pushed Chaos into Matilda, who flipped Chaos over. Chaos attempted to self-right, but was unable to because Francis and Cutter had forgotten to fit pieces of plastic on the back of the robot to help it self-right. In the next series, the teams met again in the second round of the Series Semi-Finals. This time however, Chaos 2 flipped Mace 2 over, and this time Mace 2 was unable to self-right, and Chaos 2 was declared the winner, to go through to the Grand Final. Gemini, Team Mace&#x27;s entry for Series 4 and 5, never faced Chaos 2 (despite the likelihood increasing due to Gemini&#x27;s heat being placed among the first eight in Series 4, when it should not have been), so the scores stay at one victory each for the two teams.

Chaos 2 also holds the record of being the only robot to successfully defend its title in the series (winning the Series 3 and 4 championships in a row), as well as being the first robot to remove a competitor from the arena during battle (doing this with Firestorm in Series 3, though not intentionally).

He is the subject of &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot;, an Old English poem; J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s short play in verse, &quot;The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth, Beorhthelm&#x27;s Son&quot;; and a modern statue at Maldon.

==Death in battle==
His death, while leading the Anglo-Saxon forces against the Vikings in 991, is the subject of the famous Old English poem &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot;. As presented there, his decision to allow the Vikings to move to a better position was fatal. He was said to stand well over six feet in height, and was around the age of sixty years at the Battle of Maldon, with &quot;swan-white hair&quot;. Although it is believed that he fell early in the battle, some say that it took three men to kill him, one of them almost severing Byrhtnoth&#x27;s arm in the process. He had previously had several military successes, presumably also against Viking raiders.

==Patronage and burial==
Byrhtnoth was a patron of Ely Abbey, giving it many villages (including Spaldwick, Trumpington, Rettendon, Soham, Fulbourn, Impington, Pampisford and Teversham). He was buried there alongside Archbishop Wulfstan the homilist. The &quot;Liber Eliensis&quot; records that his widow gave the Abbey a tapestry or hanging celebrating his deeds, presumably in the style of the Bayeux Tapestry, the only surviving example of such a work. This was given immediately after his death, so had probably been hanging in his home previously.

==Reburials==
After his burial, his remains, along with those of six other Saxon &#x27;benefactors of Ely Church&#x27; (also known as the seven &#x27;Confessors of Christ&#x27;) have been moved and reburied three times. Archbishop Wulfstan with six bishops (Osmund of Sweden, Athelstan of Elmham, Ælfwine of Elmham, Ælfgar of Elmham, Eadnoth of Dorchester) and Byrhtnoth were all exhumed from their burial places in the old Saxon abbey church, and in the mid-1150s the remains were reinterred in the &#x27;Northern Part&#x27; of the new Norman church, which by then had been made Ely Cathedral.

Following the collapse of the central tower in 1322, a new octagonal space was created, and a wall was built on its north side to separate the monastic area of the choir from the pilgrim entrance and route to the shrine of Æthelthryth (St Etheldreda). Within this wall the seven benefactors were buried, with wall paintings of each in an elaborate arcade facing the pilgrim entrance, perhaps to remind visitors of the enduring respect that can accrue from such generosity.

The shrines were destroyed and pilgrimages ceased at the Reformation, but in 1769, when the choir stalls were moved out of the Octagon, the wall was demolished and James Bentham found that the remains of the seven benefactors were still there, each in a separate compartment, although Byrhtnoth&#x27;s was headless. All the clerics were estimated to be over tall, and Byrhtnoth&#x27;s bones suggested that he stood at . On 31 July 1781 they were again re-interred, with considerable ceremony, at the far east end of the cathedral, in niches constructed within the gothic splendour of Bishop Nicholas West&#x27;s Chantry chapel.

==Family==
Byrhtnoth was married to Ælfflæd, sister of the dowager Queen Æthelflæd of Damerham, making Byrhtnoth a kinsman of King Edgar by marriage. 
Byrhtnoth and Ælfflæd are identified to have had a daughter who married Oswig, who died 5 May 1010 in the Battle of Ringmere. Byrhtnoth is reported to have had a daughter called Leofflæd, but she is not mentioned in any pre-Conquest source. This Leofflæd is likely the same as the daughter who married Oswig.

==Legacy==
In October 2006, a statue created by John Doubleday was placed at the end of the Maldon Promenade Walk, facing the battle site of Northey Island and the Causeway. The battle site itself has a National Trust plaque recording his &#x27;heroic defeat and death&#x27;.

As well as the Anglo-Saxon poem, &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot;, J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s short alliterative play, &quot;The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth, Beorhthelm&#x27;s Son&quot; takes place on the battlefield of Maldon and deals with the search for Byrhtnoth&#x27;s body.

In 2015 Timebomb Comics released &quot;Defiant! The Legend of Brithnoth&quot;, an original graphic novel based on the story of Brithnoth and The Battle of Malden, written by Andy Winter and illustrated by Daniel Bell.

<text>Hugh Oldham ( – 25 June 1519) was an English cleric who was Bishop of Exeter (1505–19) and a notable patron of education as a founder and patron of Manchester Grammar School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford.

Born in Lancashire to a family of minor gentry, he probably attended both Oxford and Cambridge universities, following which he was a clerk at Durham, then a rector in Cornwall before being employed by Lady Margaret Beaufort (mother of King Henry VII), rising to be the chancellor of her household by 1503. During this time he was preferred with many religious posts all over the country, being made archdeacon of Exeter in 1502 and finally bishop of that city in 1505, a decision that was probably influenced by Lady Margaret.

He was a conscientious bishop who ensured that only educated people were appointed to ecclesiastical posts. His patronage of educational establishments included the foundation of The Manchester Grammar School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford for which he donated £4,000. After his death he was buried in Exeter Cathedral in a chantry chapel that he had caused to be built for that purpose. The chapel is decorated with numerous carvings of owls, which were his personal device.

==Early life==
Oldham was one of the younger of six sons born to Roger Oldham and his wife Margery who were, the limited evidence suggests, yeomen or minor gentry at Ancoats, which at the time was a village in North West England, but is now an inner city area of Manchester. There are few records of his early life, but it is known that he attended university, studying canon law and either arts or civil law probably at Oxford, and he was later (in 1493) a bachelor of law at Cambridge. There is no contemporary evidence, however, that he was a member of Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge as was claimed by Thomas Fuller in his &quot;Worthies of England&quot; of 1662 and often repeated.

In 1475 he was described in a deed transferring property to him from his eldest brother James as a &quot;clerk of Durham&quot;. At this time he was most likely either in the household of, or employed by Lawrence Booth, Bishop of Durham, whose family came from the same area as Oldham&#x27;s and by whom James had also been employed. He was rector of Lanivet in Cornwall between 1488 and 1493, when he resigned the living on a pension of £12. At this time he was also a servant to William Smyth, who was keeper of the hanaper in the Court of Chancery. In 1492 he was the receiver for Lady Margaret Beaufort&#x27;s estates in the West Country, and by 1503 he had risen to be the chancellor of her household.

In the years following 1490, Oldham was made a canon of the cathedrals of Exeter, Lichfield, Lincoln, St Paul&#x27;s, Salisbury and York. In 1496 William Smyth, who was by then Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, appointed him to the non-residential post of master of the hospital of St John in Lichfield, to which Smyth had recently added a free grammar school and almshouse. The year 1499 saw him established as dean of Wimborne in Dorset, and in 1502 he was made archdeacon of Exeter. In 1503, he had sufficient prestige to be present at the placing of the foundation stone of the Henry VII Lady Chapel at Westminster Abbey.

==Bishop of Exeter==
Possibly with some influence from Lady Margaret Beaufort (who was the mother of the then reigning king, Henry VII), Oldham was appointed as Bishop of Exeter on 24 November 1504, and was consecrated in the post on 12 January 1505. He evidently took his duties as bishop seriously and ensured that only educated people, such as university graduates, were raised to most of the important roles under his control. He also instigated examinations to select the best candidates for ordination.

Bishop Oldham&#x27;s coat of arms, shown here, are described as &quot;Sable, a chevron or, between three Owls proper; on a chief of the second, three Roses gules.&quot; Oldham adopted the owl as his personal device. It was a play on words or rebus based on his surname, which would probably have been pronounced at the time as &quot;owl-dom&quot;. 

From 1510 to 1513 he was one of a group of bishops who resisted, largely successfully, what they considered were undue claims made by William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, regarding the probate courts. In 1511 he regulated many cathedral matters by the issue of statutes, and he was not shy in confronting other religious houses when he thought it appropriate. He successfully annexed Warland Hospital in Totnes from the Trinitarian Order in 1509. This was done, as was the similar annexation of Clyst Gabriel at Sowton, to help finance the provision of regular meals for the twenty vicars choral at his Cathedral.

He was initially successful in his litigation against Richard Banham, the abbot of Tavistock Abbey, who in 1513 had declared his abbey exempt from the bishop&#x27;s right of episcopal visitation. Oldham quickly excommunicated him, but after Banham&#x27;s personal appeal that he be &quot;absolved from his censures&quot;, Oldham reinstated him, on payment of five pounds. However, soon afterwards Banham appealed to Archbishop William Warham and Richard FitzJames, Bishop of London, who decided early in 1514 that since he had not produced any evidence of papal exemption, he had to submit to the bishop. Still not satisfied, Banham appealed directly to Rome and eventually received a papal bull, dated 14 September 1517, that exempted him totally from episcopal jurisdiction and took the Abbey under the sole protection of the Holy See, on payment of twenty shillings annually. These events are in direct contrast to what was written in 1601 by Francis Godwin in his &quot;Catalogue of the Bishops of England&quot; where he stated that it was Oldham who was excommunicated by the pope as a result of this dispute. Godwin&#x27;s version of events was followed by several later historians, but Mumford (1936) flatly stated that &quot;there is no record of any such excommunication&quot;.

Hugh Oldham had a brother, Bernard, who also followed a religious career. At Hugh&#x27;s request, Lady Margaret Beaufort had seen that he was installed as rector in Crewkerne, Somerset, in around 1495. While there, Bernard helped John Combe, a lawyer and precentor of Exeter Cathedral, who came from Crewkerne, establish a free grammar school in the town. After Lady Margaret&#x27;s death in 1509, Hugh spent a long time with his brother in Crewkerne, and arranged for him to be Archdeacon of Cornwall, a post which he held from 1509 to 1515. On 5 April 1515 Bernard was made treasurer of Exeter Cathedral, but he died within a month of taking up the post.

George Oliver in his &quot;Lives of the Bishops of Exeter&quot; (1861), relates an anecdote, originally told by John Hooker in the late 16th century, regarding the bishop&#x27;s punctuality of dining at eleven o&#x27;clock in the morning, and of supping at five o&#x27;clock in the afternoon. Apparently to ensure precision he had a house-clock to strike the hours, and a servant to look after it. If the bishop was prevented by important business from coming to table at the appointed time, the servant would delay the clock&#x27;s striking the hour until he knew that his master was ready. Sometimes, if asked what was the hour, the servant would humorously answer, &quot;As your lordship pleaseth,&quot; at which the bishop would smile and go his way. Hooker also summed up his opinion of Bishop Oldham in these words: &quot;A man having more zeal than knowledge and more devotion than learning; somewhat rough in speeches but friendly in doings [...] albeit he was not very much learned, yet a great favourer and a friend both to learning and to learned men&quot;.

==Interest in education==
As bishop, Oldham showed a keen interest in education, probably influenced by his brother Bernard&#x27;s experiences in Crewkerne. He donated £4,000 and land in Chelsea towards Corpus Christi College, Oxford, which his friend and former Bishop of Exeter, Richard Foxe was in the process of establishing. In 1513, Foxe&#x27;s original intention had been for the college to be for monks, similar to the long-established Durham College and Canterbury College, both at Oxford. However, Oldham appears to have persuaded Foxe to found a secular college instead, along the lines of New College or Magdalen, supposedly telling him that &quot;monks were but a sort of bussing [buzzing] flies ... whose state could not long endure&quot;—showing, according to some, that Oldham was well aware of the coming Reformation. In return for his generosity, daily prayers for him were recited in the new chapel at Corpus Christi both during his lifetime and after his death, and the college still has a contemporary portrait of him.

Oldham may also have patronized Brasenose College, Oxford, which his former master William Smyth had founded in 1509. The historian John Hooker stated that Oldham&#x27;s advances to Smyth were rebuffed, but evidence of the patronage existed in the form of his coat of arms that used to be set in a library window there. He apparently also offered help to Exeter College, Oxford, established in 1314 by one of his predecessors at Exeter, Bishop Stapledon, but in this case there is no evidence to contradict Hooker&#x27;s statement that his offer was rejected.

Oldham&#x27;s interests also extended to lower levels of education. He ensured that the younger members of Exeter&#x27;s cathedral choir attended the city high school, for instance, but his main endowment in this field was made back in his home country of Lancashire. On 2 July 1515 he signed an endowment trust deed establishing the Manchester Free Grammar School for Lancashire Boys which later became The Manchester Grammar School. This deed promoted &quot;godliness and good learning&quot; and promised that any boy showing sufficient academic ability, regardless of background, could attend, free of charge. A site was purchased in September 1516 and construction took place between April 1517 and August 1518. The total cost, as shown by a bill signed by Oldham, was £218.13s.5d, most of which must have been given by Oldham himself.

==Oldham&#x27;s death, his chapel and tomb==
Sir John Speke, a wealthy Devon knight, and Bishop Oldham jointly planned the construction of two new chantry chapels in complementary positions off the north and south choir-aisles of Exeter Cathedral. Oldham&#x27;s chapel, off the south aisle, was apparently complete by 1513. It was dedicated to St Saviour, and Oldham intended his body to rest there. Speke died on 28 April 1518 and was interred in his tomb off the north aisle. On 16 December of the same year, Oldham drew up his will in which he gave £80 for the vicars choral to celebrate a daily mass for his soul at his tomb. He died just six months later, on 25 June 1519.

His body lies in his chantry chapel which is decorated with numerous carvings of the owl that was his personal device. One of the owls carries a scroll in its beak, bearing the letters &quot;DOM&quot;. His tomb is surmounted by a brightly painted, but rather crudely carved effigy, typical of the general decline in the quality of sepulchral monuments of the early 16th century. The tomb was restored by Corpus Christi College in the late 19th century. It was restored again and recoloured, together with many other monuments in the cathedral, between 1956 and 1967.

==Legacy==
Bishop Oldham is well remembered by Manchester Grammar School: on a Sunday at the end of June each year representatives from the school hold a commemorative service in Exeter Cathedral during which a wreath is laid on his tomb. Since 2005 the school has held an annual Hugh Oldham Lecture, with speakers that have included Astronomer Royal Martin Rees, historian Michael Wood and Lord Winston. And in 2001 the Bishop of Exeter, Michael Langrish gave a speech to the London Section of the Old Mancunians&#x27; Association in which he emphasised two facets of Bishop Oldham&#x27;s life, both of which he said have relevance today: the importance of learning and education that is broad-based, humane and directed to the well-being of society, and to be open to the future and critically appreciative of what it might be. A life-size bronze statue of the bishop, sculpted by William Macmillan in 1931, stands in the school grounds, and the school&#x27;s badge still incorporates Oldham&#x27;s owls.

Hugh Oldham Lads Club, one of the first Lads Clubs in Manchester and similar in its purpose to the later Salford Lads Club, was founded by the educator Alexander Devine in 1887 as a result of his concern for the welfare of children. It continued until 1958.

<text>Tatyana Romanovna Lebedeva (, born 21 July 1976) is a Russian track and field athlete who competes in both the long jump and triple jump events. She is one of the most successful athletes in the disciplines, having won gold medals at Olympic, world and European levels. She has a long jump best of 7.33 m and held the then indoor world record mark of 15.36 m in the triple jump. In 2017 she was banned for doping. 

==Career==
Her first successes came in the triple jump in 2000, when she won European Indoor gold medal and a silver at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. She became the World Champion the following year in addition to a silver medal at the world indoors. After retaining her triple jump title at the 2003 World Championships, she decided to take up the long jump as well. The move paid dividends: she broke the indoor world record in the triple jump at the 2004 World Indoor Championships and won a second gold in the long jump with a mark of 15.36. She won her first Olympic gold medal in the long jump event at the 2004 Athens Olympics and also won the bronze in the triple jump competition.

In 2005, she missed the World Championships due to injury, but became the sole winner of the IAAF Golden League jackpot, a bonus of US$1 million awarded to athletes who win their event at each of six designated European summer meets. That year, she concentrated on the triple jump.

Lebedeva excelled at the 2005 IAAF Golden League, receiving the entire jackpot prize of US$1 million. She became European champion for the first time with a win at the 2006 European Athletics Championships in the triple jump. Lebedeva reached the podium twice at the 2007 World Championships taking long jump gold and triple jump silver.

On 25 January 2017, the International Olympic Committee sanctioned Lebedeva for doping at the 2008 Olympic Games, as a result she lost her silver medals for both the long jump and triple jump events in that Games. Lebedeva appealed the IOC&#x27;s decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, however on 26 July 2018, the IOC&#x27;s decision was upheld.

She won the long jump silver medal at the 2009 World Championships (her eighth medal on the world podium), although she could not match this form in the triple jump.

==Personal life==
In September 2002, Lebedeva and her husband Nikolay Matveev had their first daughter, Anastasiya. She announced that she was pregnant for a second time in 2010 (choosing to skip the 2011 season), and gave birth to a second daughter (Aleksandra) in November.

<text>GoldenPalace.com is an online casino that operates under a license granted by CIGA (Curaçao Internet Gaming Association). They are known for their publicity stunts and large &quot;bonuses&quot; that had to be wagered up to fifty times before claiming. On several occasions, this led to controversy when the site refused to pay players seen to be only playing to claim the free money, and not for the entertainment value. One key incident led to the site&#x27;s former software provider, Microgaming, terminating their agreement. This led GoldenPalace and its sister casinos to move to rival Playtech in 2003; since 2013, it uses provider IGSONLINE.

==History==

The casino has paid many boxers to wear temporary tattoos on their backs promoting the site. GoldenPalace.com has also been accused of far more disruptive ambush marketing stunts. The casino sponsored serial streaker Mark Roberts in several of his escapades, including his &quot;performances&quot; at the 2003 UEFA Cup final and Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004; at both events, he wore a temporary GoldenPalace.com tattoo.

GoldenPalace.com is also well known for its winning internet auctions, mostly for bizarre items. Notable examples include a $28,000 grilled cheese sandwich purportedly displaying an image of the Virgin Mary, a $75,100 plastic French fry from a McDonald&#x27;s Super Bowl commercial, a car previously owned by Pope Benedict XVI, and William Shatner&#x27;s kidney stone, for which it paid $25,000. On March 3, 2005, they paid $650,000 for the naming rights of the recently discovered Madidi titi monkey. The &quot;GoldenPalace.com monkey&quot; was officially named &quot;Callicebus aureipalatii&quot;, with &quot;aureipalatii&quot; literally translating into &quot;of the golden palace&quot; in Latin. GoldenPalace.com also paid a woman to permanently tattoo their domain name on her forehead in 2005.

<text>Matthew Kneale (born 24 November 1960) is a British writer. He is best known for his 2000 novel &quot;English Passengers&quot;.

==Life==
Kneale was born on 24 November 1960 in London, the son of screenwriter Nigel Kneale, and the children&#x27;s writer Judith Kerr. He is also the grandson of Alfred Kerr, a German theatre critic and essayist, who as a dissident and critic of the Nazi Party was forced to flee Germany with his family in 1933. Matthew first accompanied his mother on a visit to Germany in 1967. 
Kneale was brought up in Barnes, attended Latymer Upper School in West London, and then studied modern history at Magdalen College, Oxford. Growing up, he was fascinated by other cultures, past and present, and as a student he travelled in Europe, South America, Central America and the Indian subcontinent. After graduating he knew he wanted to write but had little idea how to set about such a thing. He traveled to Tokyo, where he found work teaching English and began writing a diary and short stories. Later, on returning to England, his experience in Japan inspired his first novel, &quot;Whore Banquets&quot;.

During the next few years Kneale lived primarily in London, travelled, spent a year in Rome, and wrote his second novel, &quot;Inside Rose&#x27;s Kingdom&quot;. In 1990 he moved to Oxford, where he wrote two historical novels, &quot;Sweet Thames&quot; and &quot;English Passengers&quot;. He also developed an interest in languages, attempting to learn Spanish, Romanian, Albanian and Amharic (Ethiopian). In 2000 he married Shannon Russell and they moved to Italy and Shannon&#x27;s homeland of Canada. He and his wife now live in Rome with their two children.

==Work==
Kneale&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Whore Banquets&quot;, tells the story of an Englishman whose affair with a Tokyo woman brings him into the realm of Japanese organized crime. It won the 1988 Somerset Maugham Award and the 1988 Betty Trask Award. It was later republished as &quot;Mr Foreigner&quot;.

&quot;Inside Rose&#x27;s Kingdom&quot; follows a young innocent who moves from the countryside to London, where he becomes caught up with a group of controlling, emotionally grasping people.

&quot;Sweet Thames&quot; is set in London in 1849 and tells the story of the trials of an enlightened drainage engineer whose wife vanishes during a cholera epidemic. It won the 1993 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize.

&quot;English Passengers&quot; tells the story of a religious-scientific expedition that seeks to find the Garden of Eden in Tasmania, a land whose aboriginal culture had been experiencing brutal destruction at the hands of British settlers and convicts. The novel is told by more than 20 voices. It won the 2000 Whitbread Book of the Year Award and was a finalist for the Booker Prize and the Australian Miles Franklin Award. In translation the book won France&#x27;s Relay Prix d&#x27;Evasion. Interviewed in 2001, Kneale said that J. G. Farrell was a writer whom he particularly admired, as one who &quot;wrote about the British Empire – and scathingly – back in the 1970s, when few in Britain wanted to think about the uglier parts of their country&#x27;s past.&quot;

&quot;Small Crimes in an Age of Abundance&quot; is a volume of 12 short stories set around the world, from Colombia to London to Africa. They examine the lives of people as they struggled to survive and do the right thing, sometimes managing neither. One of the stories, &quot;Powder&quot;, about a failed lawyer whose life changes when he chances upon a stash of cocaine and a mobile phone, was made into the French feature film, &quot;Une Pure Affaire&quot;.

&quot;When We Were Romans&quot; is told from the point of view of a boy, Laurence, whose mother suddenly and unexpectedly decides that she and her children, and even Laurence&#x27;s hamster, must flee England to Rome, where she lived many years before.

&quot;An Atheist&#x27;s History of Belief&quot; is Kneale&#x27;s first nonfiction book. It looks at the beliefs that people have devised to explain their world, from earliest prehistoric times to the present, as understood by a fascinated non-believer. His second work of nonfiction, &quot;Rome: A History in Seven Sackings&quot; is a social and cultural history spanning centuries.

&quot;Pilgrims&quot; is a comic novel set in medieval times, mainly in 1289, about a group of heterogeneous individuals who band together on a journey from England to Rome on a religious pilgrimage, each with his or her own intentions.

&#x27;The Rome Plague Diaries - Lockdown Life in the Eternal City&#x27; is a non-fiction account of life during the Covid Pandemic lockdown of March - May 2020 which extends to a memoir of the author&#x27;s two decades living in Rome, learning to understand the city and its inhabitants, and it even includes a few favourite recipes.

&#x27;The Camerman&#x27; is a fictional account of a road journey across Europe to Rome, by Julius Sewell, a film cameraman who has been released from a mental hospital in Wales following a psychotic episode, together with his dysfunctional and politically extreme family. Set in the spring of 1934 the novel is set against the background of the rising spectre of Fascism and Nazism.

<doc id="881480" wikidata="Q463281" url="?curid=881480" title="American Academy of Arts and Letters">
<text>The American Academy of Arts and Letters is a 300-member honor society whose goal is to &quot;foster, assist, and sustain excellence&quot; in American literature, music, and art. Its fixed number membership is elected for lifetime appointments. Its headquarters is in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. It shares Audubon Terrace, a Beaux Arts/American Renaissance complex on Broadway between West 155th and 156th Streets, with the Hispanic Society of America and Boricua College.

The academy&#x27;s galleries are open to the public on a published schedule. Exhibits include an annual exhibition of paintings, sculptures, photographs and works on paper by contemporary artists nominated by its members, and an annual exhibition of works by newly elected members and recipients of honors and awards. A permanent exhibit of the recreated studio of composer Charles Ives was opened in 2014.

The auditorium is sought out by musicians and engineers wishing to record live, as the acoustics are considered among the city&#x27;s finest. Hundreds of commercial recordings have been made there.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
The American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters was formed from three parent organizations. The first, the American Social Science Association, was founded in 1865 in Boston. The second was the National Institute of Arts and Letters, which ASSA&#x27;s membership created in 1898. The qualification for membership in the NIAL was notable achievement in art, music, or literature. The NIAL&#x27;s membership was at first limited to 150 (all men). The third organization was the American Academy of Arts, which NIAL&#x27;s membership created in 1904 as a preeminent national arts institution, styling itself after the French Academy.

The AAA&#x27;s first seven academicians were elected from ballots cast by the NIAL membership. They were William Dean Howells, Samuel L. Clemens, Edmund Clarence Stedman, and John Hay, representing literature; Augustus Saint-Gaudens and John La Farge, representing art; and Edward MacDowell, representing music. The NIAL membership increased in 1904, with the introduction of a two-tiered structure: 50 academicians and 200 regular members. Academicians were gradually elected over the next several years. The elite group (academicians) were called the &quot;Academy&quot;, and the larger group (regular members) was called the &quot;Institute&quot;. This strict two-tiered system persisted for 72 years (1904–1976).

In 1908, the poet Julia Ward Howe was elected to the AAA, becoming the first female academician.

In 1976, the NIAL and AAA merged, under the name American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. The combined Academy/Institute structure had a maximum of 250 living U.S. citizens as members, plus up to 75 foreign composers, artists, and writers as honorary members. It also established the annual Witter Bynner Poetry Prize in 1980 to support young poets. The election of foreign honorary members persisted until 1993, when it was abandoned.

=== Federally chartered corporation ===
The academy holds a Congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code (42 USC 20301 et seq.), making it one of the country&#x27;s comparatively rare &quot;Title 36&quot; corporations. The 1916 statute of incorporation established this institution among a small number of other similarly chartered patriotic and national organizations. The federal incorporation was originally construed primarily as an honor. The special recognition neither implies nor accords Congress any special control over the academy, which functions independently.

Active sponsors of Congressional action were Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts and former President Theodore Roosevelt. The process that led to the creation of this federal charter was controversial and the first attempt to gain the charter in 1910 failed. Lodge reintroduced legislation, which passed the Senate in 1913. The academy was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1914, which resulted in Congressional approval in 1916.

== Buildings ==

The academy occupies three buildings on the west end of the Audubon Terrace complex created by Archer M. Huntington, the heir to the Southern Pacific Railroad fortune and a noted philanthropist. To help convince the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the National Institute of Arts and Letters, which were separate but related organizations at the time, to move to the complex, Huntington established building funds and endowments for both.

The first building, on the complex&#x27;s south side, along West 155th Street, was designed by William M. Kendall of McKim, Mead &amp; White; Kendall was also a member of the academy. This Anglo-Italian Renaissance administration building was designed in 1921 and opened in 1923. On the north side, another building housing an auditorium and gallery was designed by Cass Gilbert, also an academy member, and built in 1928–1930. These additions to the complex necessitated considerable alterations to the Audubon Terrace plaza, which were designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White.

In 2007, the American Numismatic Society, which had occupied a Charles P. Huntington-designed building immediately to the east of the academy&#x27;s original building, vacated that space to move to smaller quarters downtown. This building, which incorporates a 1929 addition designed by H. Brooks Price, became the academy&#x27;s Annex and houses additional gallery space. In 2009, the space between the Annex and the administration building was turned into a new entrance link, designed by Vincent Czajka with Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners.

== Membership ==
Members of the academy are chosen for life and have included some of the American art scene&#x27;s leading figures. They are organized into committees that award annual prizes to up-and-coming artists. Although the names of some of the organization&#x27;s members may not be well-known today, each was well known in their time. Greatness and pettiness are demonstrable among the academy members, even during the first decade, when William James declined his nomination on the grounds that his little brother Henry had been elected first. One of the giants of the academy in his time, Robert Underwood Johnson, casts a decades-long shadow in his one-man war against encroaching modernism, blackballing such writers as H. L. Mencken, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and T. S. Eliot (before his emigration to England disqualified him for full membership). Former Harvard president Charles William Eliot declined election to the academy &quot;because he was already in so many societies that he didn&#x27;t want to add to the number&quot;.

Although never explicitly excluded, women were not elected to membership in the early years. The admission of Julia Ward Howe in January 1908 (at age 88) as the first woman in the academy was only one incident in the intense debate about the consideration of female members. In 1926, the election of four women—Edith Wharton, Margaret Deland, Agnes Repplier and Mary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman—was said to have &quot;marked the letting down of the bars to women&quot;. The first African-American woman member-elect was Gwendolyn Brooks in 1976.

* Marc Blitzstein Award: The $5,000 award is given periodically to a composer, lyricist, or librettist, &quot;to encourage the creation of works of merit for musical theater and opera&quot;. The award was established in 1965 by the friends of Marc Blitzstein, an academy member.
* Michael Braude Award for Light Verse: The $5,000 biennial award is given &quot;for light verse written in English regardless of the country of origin of the writer&quot;.

<text>Big Hill Pond State Park is a state park in the southwestern part of McNairy County in southwestern Tennessee.

==Description==

The park has an area of and is forested with timberland and hardwood bottomland. Cypress Creek and the Tuscumbia River border the property. The park&#x27;s central feature is Travis McNatt Lake. The namesake Big Hill Pond was formed by excavation in 1853 as a borrow pit that was a source for soil used to build a levee across the Tuscumbia and Cypress Creek bottoms for the Memphis and Charleston Railroad. In addition, the floodplains of the Tuscumbia River and Cypress Creek contain small oxbow lakes and sloughs that provide desirable habitat for waterfowl, other wildlife, and fish. A large stand of cypress trees has grown up in and around Big Hill Pond, which is accessible by four-wheel-drive vehicles. The park contains the Big Hill Pond Fortification, which was the site of Union defenses above the Memphis and Charleston Railroad during the Civil War.

<doc id="881484" wikidata="Q215820" url="?curid=881484" title="Judith Kerr">
<text>Anna Judith Gertrud Helene Kerr (surname pronounced ; 14 June 1923 – 22 May 2019) was a German-born British writer and illustrator whose books sold more than 10 million copies around the world. She created both enduring picture books such as the &quot;Mog&quot; series and &quot;The Tiger Who Came to Tea&quot; and acclaimed novels for older children such as the semi-autobiographical &quot;When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit&quot;, which gave a child&#x27;s-eye view of escaping Hitler&#x27;s persecution in the Second World War. Born in the Weimar Republic, she came to Britain with her family in 1935 to escape persecution during the rise of the Nazis.

== Youth ==
Kerr was born on 14 June 1923 in Berlin, the daughter of Alfred Kerr (1867–1948), a theatre critic, and Julia Kerr (née Weismann; 1898–1965), a composer who was the daughter of a Prussian politician. Judith Kerr had a brother, Michael. Her parents were both from German Jewish families.

Early in March 1933, the family heard a rumour that, should the Nazis come to power in the forthcoming election, they planned to confiscate their passports and arrest Alfred Kerr for having openly criticised the party. The family fled Germany for Switzerland on the morning of the election and later learned that the Nazis had come to their home in Berlin the following morning to arrest them. Alfred Kerr&#x27;s books were burned by the Nazis shortly after he had fled Germany. The family later travelled to France, before finally settling in Britain in 1936, where Judith Kerr lived for the remainder of her life.

== Life in London ==
During the Second World War, Judith Kerr worked for the Red Cross, helping wounded soldiers, before being awarded a scholarship to study at the Central School of Arts and Crafts and becoming an artist. She met her future husband, screenwriter Nigel &quot;Tom&quot; Kneale, in the BBC canteen. He wrote the cult TV science-fiction serial &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; for which Kerr helped make and operate the special effects. Kneale later prompted her to apply for a job as a BBC television scriptwriter. Kerr naturalised as a British subject on 21 June 1947.

Kerr and Kneale were married in 1954; they remained married until his death in 2006. They had two children, a daughter Tacy (born 1958) and a son Matthew (born 1960). Matthew is also a writer, winning the Book of the Year prize at the Whitbread Book Awards in 2000 for the novel &quot;English Passengers&quot;. Tacy is an actress, animatronics artist and painter; as an animatronics designer, she initially worked for Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop before working independently in special effects. She has worked on films including &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot;, and the first four &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films. As an artist, she primarily paints insects.

Kerr lived in the same house in Barnes, London, from 1962 until her death on 22 May 2019.

== Books ==
Kerr is best known for her children&#x27;s books. Although she dreamed of being a famous writer as a child, she only started writing and drawing books when her own children were learning to read. She wrote self-illustrated picture titles, such as the 17-book &quot;Mog&quot; series and &quot;The Tiger Who Came to Tea&quot;. The character of Mog was based on a real-life tabby who would sit on Kerr&#x27;s lap as she worked.

As well as young children&#x27;s books, Kerr wrote children&#x27;s novels such as the semi-autobiographical &quot;Out of the Hitler Time&quot; trilogy (&quot;When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit&quot;, &quot;Bombs on Aunt Dainty&quot; (originally published as &quot;The Other Way Round&quot;) and &quot;A Small Person Far Away&quot;), which tell the story, from a child&#x27;s perspective, of the rise of the Nazis in 1930s Germany and life as a refugee, life in Britain during World War II and life during the post-war years and the Cold War respectively. Again it was her children who occasioned this writing: when her son was eight he saw &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and remarked, &quot;now we know what it was like when Mummy was a little girl&quot;. Kerr wanted him to know what it was really like and so wrote &quot;When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit&quot;. The story was based on her regret over choosing to take a stuffed dog toy with her when her family fled Germany rather than a beloved pink rabbit toy. The young adult novel won the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis in 1974. A cinematic adaption of &quot;When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit&quot; premiered in December 2019 in Germany, directed by Oscar-winning director Caroline Link.

Kerr said that since the death of her husband writing had become more important than ever. She continued to write and illustrate children&#x27;s books: &quot;Twinkles, Arthur and Puss&quot; was published in 2008, and &quot;One Night in the Zoo&quot; in 2009. &quot;The Curse of the School Rabbit&quot; was published posthumously in 2019.

Kerr was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to children&#x27;s literature and Holocaust education.

== Death and legacy ==
Kerr died at her home on 22 May 2019, aged 95, following a short illness.

In 2013 Britain&#x27;s first bilingual state school in English and German, the in Herne Hill, south London, was named after her.

In May 2019, a week before her death, she was nominated as an illustrator of the year at the British Book Awards. An archive of her illustrations is held at the Seven Stories centre in Newcastle upon Tyne.

<doc id="881485" wikidata="Q1414420" url="?curid=881485" title="Line-out (rugby union)">
<text>A line-out or lineout is a means by which, in rugby union, play is restarted after the ball has gone into touch. When the ball goes out of the field of play, the opposing team is normally awarded a line-out; the exception is after the ball is kicked into touch from a penalty kick, when the team that was awarded the penalty throws into the line-out. In 2021 World Rugby began trialling what was dubbed the &quot;50:22&quot; (or &quot;50–22&quot;) rule, wherein the kicking team has the throw-in if the ball travels from the kicker&#x27;s half and bounces beyond the opposing 22-metre line. This was inspired by rugby league&#x27;s 40/20 kick. 

A line-out is formed by players from each team lining up inside the touchline, at 90° to it. A player from the side that did not put the ball into touch then throws the ball back into play.

A line-out is one of the two methods of restarting play after the ball has gone into touch, the other is the &quot;quick throw-in&quot; (sometimes referred to as a quick line-out). Due to the specific rules placed on quick throw-ins they are uncommon in a rugby match, with the majority of restarts from touch taking the form of a line-out.

==Line-outs==
===Position of line-out===
Where the line-out is taken depends on the manner in which the ball was played into touch. If it is kicked directly into touch, without first landing in the field-of-play or touching the referee or an opponent who is not in touch, the line-out is formed in line with the spot from where it was kicked, with two exceptions: if the kick was a penalty kick or if the kicker had at least one foot on or behind his own 22-metre line, the line-out is formed at the spot where the ball crossed the touch-line. In all other cases, the line-out is formed at the spot where the ball crossed the touch-line, except that if this spot is within 5 metres of the goal-line, the line-out is formed on the 5-metre line. A line-out is also awarded if a player in possession of the ball crosses or touches the touchline whilst still in possession of the ball.

A player in the line-out will attempt either to catch the ball or to knock it back to a &quot;receiver&quot;, a player from their own side (often the scrum-half but sometimes another forward) who is standing close to the line-out on their side of the pitch and in a position to receive such a ball. Each team may have, at most, one receiver at a line-out.

Players not forming part of the line-out, or acting as receiver, must stay at least behind the line at which the line-out is formed until the line-out is over; the only exception is if the line-out is formed within 11 yards of a team&#x27;s goal-line, when they need only retreat behind the goal-line. A line-out ends when the ball, or a player carrying it, leaves the line-out, or, if a ruck or maul is formed at the line-out, when all the feet of all the players forming the ruck or maul move beyond the line of touch.

The line-out was originally contested with both teams jumping unsupported to retrieve the ball. However, lifting in the line-out was legalised in 1999 under Law 18 of the World Rugby laws.

Players must not interfere with the opposition during the line-out. In particular, they must not interfere with or tackle a jumper while his feet are off the ground, or interfere with players supporting him; such actions are deemed to be dangerous play and will be penalised with a penalty kick. Players in the line-out must not close the gap or enter the gap, except in the act of jumping for the ball, nor may they jump or support a jumper before the ball is thrown; such actions are penalised with a free-kick. Penalty kicks and free kicks are awarded 15 metres infield from the touch-line.

If the ball is thrown beyond the 15-metre line, a player from the throwing team who is not taking part in the line-out may run forward to take the ball. If he does so, an opponent may also run forward to contest possession. Players who are taking part in the line-out may move beyond the 15-metre line as soon as the ball leaves the thrower&#x27;s hands. If, however, a player runs forward or infield and the ball is not thrown beyond the 15-metre line, that player is off-side. The line-out ends when the ball crosses the 15-metre line.

Players from the side not throwing may jump to compete for the ball, though they must be careful not to attract a penalty for interfering with an opposing jumper. Alternatively, they may choose not to contest the line-out but to drive onto the catcher as soon as he returns to the ground. Often, when a team is awarded a line-out close to their opponent&#x27;s goal-line, they will attempt to form a maul around the catcher and drive over the goal-line to score a try. In such cases, the defending team will often seek to disrupt this tactic by driving in on the catcher, taking him to ground immediately, before a maul can form.

===Tactics===
Teams usually employ a line-out code, to ensure that all players on that team know what is planned, who the ball will be thrown to, what that player will do with it, and what follow-up play is intended. One player from the throwing team is usually designated to shout the code, and it is particularly important that the thrower should know what the code is, so that he can execute the throw as intended.

==Quick throw-in==
A quick throw-in may be taken without waiting for a line-out to be formed. For a quick throw-in to be legal, the ball can not have been touched by any other person (player or non-player), apart from the player taking the throw or the opponent who may have carried the ball into touch and it can only be taken between the point of the ball leaving the field and the thrower&#x27;s own goal line, unless a kick-off or restart kick goes straight into touch, in which case the ball may be taken up to the 50 metre line. If a line-out begins to form before the quick throw-in is taken the throw-in is not permitted. To prevent quick throw-ins, members of the opposing team will often race to the point where the ball went into touch to ensure a line-out is forming. In a quick throw-in the player throwing the ball back into play cannot send the ball forward towards the opponent&#x27;s goal line. However, unlike a line-out, the ball may be thrown back in the direction of the player&#x27;s own goal line.

<text>Carolyn Leigh (August 21, 1926 – November 19, 1983) was an American lyricist for Broadway, film, and popular songs. She is best known as the writer with partner Cy Coleman of the pop standards &quot;Witchcraft&quot; and &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come&quot;. With Johnny Richards, she wrote the million-seller &quot;Young at Heart&quot; for the film of the same name, starring Frank Sinatra.

==Biography==
Leigh was born to a Jewish family in the Bronx, New York, graduated from Hunter College High School, Queens College, and New York University.

Leigh worked as a copy writer for radio stations and advertising agencies. Always writing stories and poems, in 1951, when urged to write songs by a musical publisher who gave her a contract, she wrote &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting Just for You&quot; with Henry Glover, and two years later, &quot;Young at Heart.&quot;

Leigh&#x27;s lyrics for Broadway shows include &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;Wildcat&quot;, &quot;Little Me&quot;, and &quot;How Now, Dow Jones&quot;. The last was an original idea of Leigh&#x27;s, though Max Shulman wrote the script. She provided lyrics for the scores to the films &quot;The Cardinal&quot; in 1963 and &quot;Father Goose&quot; in 1964. In 1969 she wrote the lyrics for the musical &quot;Gatsby&quot;, with the score by Lee Pockriss and book by Hugh Wheeler. 
She wrote the lyrics for two other unproduced musicals,&quot;Caesar&#x27;s Wife&quot;, again with music by Pockriss, about Julius Caesar&#x27;s third wife, Calpurnia, and &quot;Juliet&quot;, based on the Fellini movie &quot;Juliet of the Spirits,&quot; with music by Morton Gould.

Leigh was working with Marvin Hamlisch on the musical &quot;Smile&quot; when she died on November 19, 1983, of a heart attack. She was divorced from her first husband Julius Levine in 1959 and married David Cunningham Jr. the same year. Leigh was inducted posthumously into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1985.

<text>Chickasaw State Park is a state park located in Chester County, Tennessee, in the Southeastern United States. The park consists of 1,280 acres (5 km2) amidst a 14,384 acres (58 km2) state forest and includes Lake Placid, Lake Lajoie, and some of West Tennessee&#x27;s highest areas.

== History ==
Chickasaw State Park was named for the Chickasaw Indians who once inhabited West Tennessee and Northern Mississippi. Located in west Tennessee along the border of Hardeman and Chester Counties was 1,400 acres of land that was considered to be one of Tennessee&#x27;s 20 new Deal-era state parks.

In 1955, the territory became a state park because park duties returned to state control, and park and forest lands were deeded to the state. The area consists of 14,384 acres of timberland, however, 1,280 of those acres are used for recreation

== Recreation ==
Chickasaw State Park offers many activities to its visitors including camping, golfing, paddling, bird-watching, interpretive programming, swimming, hiking, biking, fishing, and horseback riding.

Chickasaw has three campgrounds: the RV campground, the tent campground, and the wrangler campground. The RV campground has 53 sites, each with water and electrical hookups and some with sewer connection. The tent campground has 29 sites with available water. The wrangler campground has 32 sites and is designed for visitors traveling with horses; each site comes with water and electrical hookups. There are 13 historic Works Progress Administration (WPA) cabins available for rent near Lake Placid as well as the Group Lodge building, which can accommodate up to 36 people.

There are eight hiking trails at Chickasaw State Park: Fern Creek Trail (0.8 miles, easy), Forked Pine Trail (0.7 miles, moderate), Friends Trail (1.5 miles, moderate), Lake Lajoie Trail (1.3 miles, easy), Lakeshore Trail (1.5 miles, easy), Owen’s Spring Trail (0.8 miles, moderate), Public Horse Trail (0.4 miles, moderate), and Tent Loop (0.3 miles, easy).

At Lake Placid&#x27;s boat dock, paddleboards, canoes, kayaks, and pedal boats can be rented from Memorial Day through the first weekend in August and then, weekends only through October 16.

<doc id="881490" wikidata="Q2641426" url="?curid=881490" title="Camille Doncieux">
<text>Camille-Léonie Doncieux (; 15 January 1847 – 5 September 1879) was the first wife of French painter Claude Monet, with whom she had two sons. She was the subject of a number of paintings by Monet, as well as Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Édouard Manet.

==Early life==
Camille-Léonie Doncieux was born in the town of La Guillotiere, later merged into Lyons, France, on 15 January 1847. Her parents were Leonie-Françoise (née Manéchalle) Doncieux and Charles Claude Doncieux, who was a merchant. The family moved to Paris, near the Sorbonne, early in the Second French Empire (1852-1870). A few years after the birth of a second child, Geneviève-François, in 1857, the family moved to Batignolles, which became part of northwestern Paris. Batignolles was popular with artists.

While in her teens, Doncieux began work as a model. She met Monet, seven years her senior, in 1865 and became his model posing for numerous paintings. They lived together in poverty at the beginning of his career. His aunt and father did not approve of the relationship with Camille. During Camille&#x27;s pregnancy with their first son, his father recommended he break off the relationship immediately. Monet left her in Paris and stayed at his aunt&#x27;s country estate to give the appearance that he was no longer in the relationship, so that his aunt would continue to pay him a monthly cheque. Camille was left behind in Paris without funds for her care.

==Marriage and children==
In Paris on 8 August 1867, Camille Doncieux gave birth to Jean, her first son with Claude Monet. Claude, who had spent the summer in Sainte-Adresse visiting his father and aunt Sophie Lecadre, returned to Paris for the birth and stayed for several days before returning to Sainte-Adresse. He returned to Paris at the end of the year for the holidays and stayed in the cold one-room apartment that Camille shared with Jean. In 1868 Monet went to live with Camille and Jean in Paris, hiding that fact from his father and aunt who thought he had abandoned &quot;his mistress and child&quot;. To escape his creditors and live in a less expensive place, in the spring the three moved to Gloton, a small scenic village near Bennecourt. They were thrown out of the inn where they were staying for non-payment. Camille and Jean were able to stay with someone in the country, while Monet tried to obtain monies for survival.

Camille and Monet were married on 28 June 1870 in the 8th arrondissement of Paris in a civil ceremony. Painter Gustave Courbet was a witness. Although Monet&#x27;s father was not present because he did not approve of the marriage, Camille&#x27;s parents attended the ceremony. Upon her marriage, Camille received a 1,200 franc dowry, which represented two years interest on a principal investment that she would receive upon her father&#x27;s death. Her parents stipulated that the money should be kept in a separate account in Camille&#x27;s name, to protect the money from Claude Monet&#x27;s creditors. The couple took their son Jean with them on their honeymoon to Trouville-sur-Mer and stayed at the Hotel Trivoli. Continuing to avoid creditors, Monet also sought to avoid being drafted to serve during the Franco-Prussian War. He left his bride and son to go to Le Havre to visit his ailing father and then on to England, &quot;presumably&quot; with money given to him by his father. Camille and Jean met up with him in England in October 1870.

They lived at Bath Place, later Kensington High Street, London, by early 1871. It was here that Monet made the only painting of Camille by him in London. Entitled &quot;Repose&quot;, she sat in a chaise longue with a book on her lap.

Monet&#x27;s patrons Ernest and Alice Hoschedé came to live with the Monets after the rich family lost their fortune due to an &quot;extravagant lifestyle&quot;. They lived with them first in Vétheuil and then the two families moved to a larger house on the road from Vétheuil to La Roche-Guyon that would support the 12 member Hoschedé and Monet families and a &quot;handful of servants&quot;.

Their second son, Michel was born on 17 March 1878, and Camille&#x27;s poor health worsened.

==Illness and death==
Camille became ill after the Hoschedés family came to live with the Monets. Much of the money that Monet had made on the sale of his paintings had to be used for her medical care. Alice nursed her during her illness.

On her deathbed, last rites were given on 31 August 1879 by a priest who also religiously sanctioned the Monets&#x27; civil marriage.

The cause of Camille&#x27;s death remains uncertain. It may have been pelvic cancer, tuberculosis, or possibly a botched abortion. She died on 5 September 1879 in Vétheuil at the age of 32. Monet painted her on her deathbed.

==Art subject==
Camille features in fifty of Monet&#x27;s paintings, including for the painting &quot;Camille (The Woman in the Green Dress)&quot;, which received critical acclaim at the Paris salon and earned him 800 francs when sold to Arsène Houssaye. In addition to being Monet&#x27;s muse and favoured model, she also modelled for Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Édouard Manet.

<text>Maurice Koechlin (3 June 1856 – 14 January 1946) was a Franco-Swiss structural engineer from the Koechlin family.

==Life==
A member of the renowned Alsatian Koechlin family, he was born in Buhl, Haut-Rhin, the son of Jean Koechlin and his wife Anne Marie (Anaïs), née Beuck. He was the first cousin once removed of André Koechlin, and the great-grandfather of actress Kalki Koechlin.

When France lost the Franco-Prussian war to Prussia in 1871 the entire Koechlin family decided to become citizens of Switzerland and thus dropped French citizenship. After the defeat of the German Empire in 1918, however, the Koechlin family again applied for French citizenship.

Maurice attended the lycée in Mulhouse, then between 1873 and 1877 studied civil engineering at the Polytechnikum Zürich under Carl Culmann. In 1876 he became a citizen of Zurich (&quot;Zürcher Bürger&quot;) Between 1877 and 1879 he worked for the French railway company &quot;Chemin de Fer de l&#x27;Est&quot;.

Much of his work was done for Gustave Eiffel&#x27;s &quot;Compagnie des établissements Eiffel&quot;, which Koechlin joined in 1879. In 1886 Maurice married Emma Rossier (1867-1965). They had six children: three sons and three daughters. Maurice and Emma were lifelong members of the Plymouth Brethren.

In 1887 he started work on his plans for the &quot;&quot;Tour de 300 mètres&quot; in Paris, along with his younger brother Henri Koechlin and civil engineer Émile Nouguier.

<text>Sergé &quot;Jojo&quot; Mayer (born 18 January 1963) is a Swiss drummer born in Zürich and currently residing in New York City.

Mayer is the son of touring musician and bass player Vali Mayer and the brother of actress Delia Mayer. He began his career as a drummer at an early age, receiving his first drum set at the age of two. Having taught himself throughout his childhood, he broke out into the professional music scene at the age of 18, joining the Monty Alexander group. Touring with the group launched him into the major jazz music scene, and he has played at the North Sea Jazz Festival, Montreux, Nice, and Athens etc., which culminated with his gigging with jazz-greats such as Dizzy Gillespie and Nina Simone. Eventually, after playing with a great variety of artists, Mayer moved away from jazz and into Drum &#x27;n&#x27; Bass.

Jojo Mayer is known for bringing together jazz, drum and bass, jungle, and other influences. He is also famous for his ability to play the rhythms of programmed jungle drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass music on acoustic drums, terming this technique &quot;reverse engineering&quot;, a phrase borrowed from computing. He executes this approach using various methods such as the heel-toe bass drum technique, the Moeller stroke, the Valving technique, and the &quot;pull-out&quot; or &quot;push-pull&quot; accent which takes the beat on the rebound. Using these techniques, he can play beats at astonishing speeds. A few of his main influences are Tony Williams, Jack DeJohnette and Buddy Rich.

He is the leader of live electronica quartet Nerve, which he founded in 1997.

He played with the guitarist David Fiuczynski in the avant-garde jazz rock band Screaming Headless Torsos and in the fusion jazz band, Intergalactic Maiden Ballet.

He ran the popular Prohibited Beatz live electronica party in NYC from 1996–2001.

== Media ==

He was featured as the cover story of the January 2008 issue of Modern Drummer magazine. Jojo Mayer was interviewed by DrummerConnection.com in May 2010, and by Linus Wyrsch on &quot;The Jazz Hole&quot; for breakthruradio.com in July 2010.

==Gear==
Mayer is a long-time Sonor endorser who also uses Sabian cymbals, Vic Firth sticks and Evans Drumheads. He helped Sonor design the Jungle kit and snare. He has also collaborated with Sabian to create three lines of cymbals: the Vault &quot;Fierce&quot; series, the &quot;Omni&quot; series, which includes both AAX and HHX models, and the HHX &quot;Anthology&quot; series. His Vault Fierce cymbals feature a raw, unlathed finish, and extensive hand hammering, while the Omnis are designed to function as both rides and crashes.
He also helped to develop the hoop crash of Sabian and the perfect balance (single pedal of Sonor).

<doc id="881498" wikidata="Q1384464" url="?curid=881498" title="Expert Field Medical Badge">
<text>The Expert Field Medical Badge (EFMB) is a United States Army special skills badge first created on June 18, 1965. This badge is the non-combat equivalent of the Combat Medical Badge (CMB) and is awarded to U.S. military personnel and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military personnel who successfully complete a set of qualification tests, including both written and performance portions. The EFMB is known for its adherence to its testing standards and, as such, requires strict attention to detail from candidates in order to receive a &quot;GO&quot; on its combat testing lanes. The pass rate for FY 2017 was 7%, making the EFMB one of the most difficult and prestigious Army special skill badges to earn. 

Any Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) may attempt to earn the badge. However, the wear of the badge is only authorized when a service member is currently serving or has served in a medical-series MOS during the time that the service member earned it. The infantry equivalent of the Expert Field Medical Badge is the Expert Infantryman Badge (EIB). The MOS 18D Special Forces Medical Sergeant, are only authorized to earn the EFMB as an expert skill badge, and they are not authorized to earn the EIB, but are authorized to wear the CIB if awarded.

== Current badge requirements (as of 2022) ==
Physical Fitness Requirements
EFMB no longer requires Soldiers to take the ACFT. Now, according to Maj. Andrey Tsepelev, &quot;Soldiers must now complete 15 burpees, 15 rowers, a 400-meter run, and a 50-meter drag of a 160-pound Sked.&quot;

==Master Medical Badge==

In late 2024 it was reported that &quot;master combat badges&quot; would debut in Spring 2025; the Master Infantryman Badge, Master Medical Badge, and Master Soldier Badge. The badges would represent those who have earned both a combat badge (CIB, CMB, or CAB) and an expert badge (EIB, EFMB, or ESB). The proposed &quot;master badges&quot; are alleged to appear identical to their respective combat badges, replacing the silver wreaths on the full-color metal badges with gold wreaths; subdued pin-on badges and sew-on badges would see their black wreaths also replaced with gold. Soldiers that had earned a combat badge but a &quot;separate&quot; expert badge (a CIB and an EFMB, for example) would wear the master badge aligning with their combat badge (in the case of a CIB and an EFMB, the awardee would wear the Master Infantryman Badge). As of 03 2025, no official announcement has been made concerning the badges.

<text>Fort Pillow State Historic Park is a state park in western Tennessee that preserves the American Civil War site of the Battle of Fort Pillow. The 1,642 acre (6.6 km²) Fort Pillow, located in Lauderdale County on the Chickasaw Bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River, is rich in both historic and archaeological significance. In 1861, the Confederate army built extensive fortifications and named the site for General Gideon Johnson Pillow of Maury County. It was attacked and held by the Union Army for most of the American Civil War period except immediately after the Battle of Fort Pillow, when it was retaken by the Confederate Army. The battle ended with a massacre of African-American Union troops and their white officers attempting to surrender, by soldiers under the command of Confederate Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

==Description and administrative history==
Remains of historic Fort Pillow&#x27;s earthworks are preserved. The park has a museum and interpretive sites. It offers recreational activities; including camping, picnicking, and fishing. In 1973, the earthworks were added to the National Register of Historic Places. it was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1974.

== American Civil War ==
On June 4, 1862, Confederate troops evacuated Fort Pillow, enabling Union troops to take Memphis, Tennessee. Because of its strategic location controlling traffic on the Mississippi River, the fort was occupied by the Union Army, which controlled it during most of the war. An exception to Union control of the fort took place for less than one day immediately after the Confederate victory in the Battle of Fort Pillow on April 12, 1864. The battle resulted in the massacre of 229 of the 262 U.S. Colored Troops engaged in the battle. The white Union soldiers numbered 285. An examination of regimental records showed that &quot;less than 36 percent of the men from white units died in battle or of wounds, while the death toll for black units was 66 percent.&quot;

A Confederate wrote in a letter home that &quot;Forrest ordered them [negroes] shot down like dogs, and the carnage continued.&quot; In addition to regimental records, contemporary accounts by troops on both sides, as well as journalists, describe it as appalling slaughter. Within about three weeks, as political controversy grew, Confederates began to dispute accounts of a massacre. Subsequent reports after the battle from Union officers to the Department of War countered much that was reported in the popular press and some of the testimony given before Congress. This slaughter by the Confederate troops under Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest has been classified by historians as a .

&quot;Remember Fort Pillow!&quot; became a battle cry among black Union soldiers for the remainder of the Civil War. While the Union casualty count for the battle does not indicate that the Confederate forces took many prisoners, Confederate records show about 200 prisoners were shipped south.

In 1866, the Union Army created a cemetery for both Confederate and Union soldiers south of the battle site. In 1867, they moved about 250 bodies of Confederate and Union soldiers from that cemetery to the Memphis National Cemetery.

<text>James Kennedy (20 July 1902 – 6 April 1984) was an Irish songwriter. He was predominantly a lyricist, putting words to existing music such as &quot;Teddy Bears&#x27; Picnic&quot; and &quot;My Prayer&quot; or co-writing with composers like Michael Carr, Wilhelm Grosz and Nat Simon. In a career spanning more than fifty years, he wrote some 2000 songs, of which over 200 became worldwide hits and about 50 are popular music classics.

==Early life==
Kennedy was born in Omagh, County Tyrone, Ireland. His father, Joseph Hamilton Kennedy, was a policeman in the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC). While growing up in the village of Coagh, Kennedy wrote several songs and poems. He was inspired by local surroundings—the view of the Ballinderry River, the local Springhill House and the plentiful chestnut trees on his family&#x27;s property, as evidenced in his poem &quot;Chestnut Trees&quot;. Kennedy later moved to Portstewart, a seaside resort in County Londonderry.

Kennedy graduated from Trinity College, Dublin, before teaching in England. He was accepted into the Colonial Service, as a civil servant, in 1927.

==Music career==
While awaiting a Colonial Service posting to the colony of Nigeria, Kennedy embarked on a career in songwriting. His first success came in 1930 with &quot;The Barmaid&#x27;s Song&quot;, sung by Gracie Fields. Fellow lyricist Harry Castling introduced him to Bert Feldman, a music publisher based in London&#x27;s &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot;, for whom Kennedy started to work. In the early 1930s, he wrote a number of successful songs, including &quot;Oh, Donna Clara&quot; (1930), &quot;My Song Goes Round the World&quot; (1931), and &quot;The Teddy Bears&#x27; Picnic&quot; (1933), in which Kennedy provided new lyrics to John Walter Bratton&#x27;s tune from 1907.

In 1934, Feldman turned down Kennedy&#x27;s song &quot;Isle of Capri&quot;, but it became a major hit for a new publisher, Peter Maurice. Kennedy wrote several more successful songs for Maurice, including &quot;Red Sails in the Sunset&quot; (1935), inspired by beautiful summer evenings in Portstewart, Northern Ireland; &quot;Harbour Lights&quot; (1937); and &quot;South of the Border&quot; (1939), inspired by a holiday picture postcard he received from Tijuana, Mexico, and written with composer Michael Carr. Kennedy and Carr also collaborated on several West End shows in the 1930s, including &quot;London Rhapsody&quot; (1937). &quot;My Prayer&quot;, with original music by Georges Boulanger, had English lyrics penned by Kennedy in 1939. It was originally written by Boulanger with the title &quot;Avant de Mourir&quot; in 1926.

During the early stages of the Second World War, while serving in the British Army&#x27;s Royal Artillery, where he rose to the rank of captain, he wrote the wartime hit, &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Hang out the Washing on the Siegfried Line&quot;. His hits also included &quot;Cokey Cokey&quot; (1945; known as &quot;The Hokey Pokey&quot; and &quot;Okey Cokey&quot; in several locales), and the English lyrics to &quot;Lili Marlene&quot;. After the end of the war, his songs included &quot;An Apple Blossom Wedding&quot; (1947), &quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople)&quot; (1953), and &quot;Love Is Like a Violin&quot; (1960). In the 1960s, Kennedy wrote the song &quot;The Banks of the Erne&#x27;&quot;, for recording by his friend from the war years, Theo Hyde, also known as Ray Warren.

Kennedy was a patron of the Castlebar International Song Contest from 1973 until his death in 1984, and his association with the event added great prestige to the contest.

==Awards==
Kennedy won two Ivor Novello Awards for his contribution to music and received an honorary degree from the New University of Ulster. He was awarded the OBE in 1983. In 1997 he was posthumously inducted into the Songwriter&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

==Death==
Kennedy died in Cheltenham on 6 April 1984, aged 81, and was interred in Taunton, Somerset. He was survived by two sons and a daughter.

<doc id="881504" wikidata="Q7373158" url="?curid=881504" title="Roy McMurtry">
<text>Roland Roy McMurtry (May 31, 1932 – March 18, 2024) was a Canadian lawyer, judge and politician in Ontario. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1975 to 1985, serving in the cabinet of Bill Davis as Attorney General and as Solicitor General. After leaving politics, McMurtry was High Commissioner of Canada to the United Kingdom between 1985 and 1988. He became a judge in 1991 and was appointed Chief Justice of Ontario in 1996. McMurtry retired from the bench in 2007 and returned to the private practice of law.

==Early life==
Roland Roy McMurtry was born in Toronto as the son of lawyer Roy McMurtry. He was educated at St. Andrew&#x27;s College and graduated in 1950. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto (Trinity College) in 1954, and a Bachelor of Laws degree from Osgoode Hall Law School in 1958. While attending university, he was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity and became a close friend of future Premier of Ontario Bill Davis, his Canadian football teammate.

While studying, he was hired to teach football at Upper Canada College. He also taught adult literacy classes at Frontier College, working through the day on construction projects and teaching at night. He was a trial lawyer for seventeen years before entering politics. He also wrote a weekly column in the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; during the early 1970s.

==Political career==
In the 1960s, he worked with Dalton Camp and Norman Atkins to remove John Diefenbaker as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

McMurtry suffered a back injury during the 1971 Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership convention and was able to exempt himself from choosing between Davis and rival candidate Allan Lawrence, whose campaign was managed by Atkins. Davis defeated Lawrence by 44 votes on the final ballot. A few weeks later, McMurtry organized a meeting which brought together the Davis and Lawrence leadership teams. The resulting alliance, known as the Big Blue Machine, dominated the Progressive Conservative Party into the 1980s.

===Entering the legislature===
Allan Lawrence resigned his St. George constituency in late 1972 to move to federal politics, and McMurtry was recruited by Davis as the Progressive Conservative candidate for a March 1973 by-election. He was unexpectedly defeated by Liberal Party candidate Margaret Campbell, a well-known municipal politician. He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario two years later, in the 1975 provincial election, defeating Liberal candidate Frank Judge in the Eglinton constituency.

===Attorney General===

Davis won a minority government in the 1975 election, and McMurtry was immediately appointed to cabinet as Attorney General. He held this position until 1985, and he also served as Solicitor General from 1978 to 1982.

McMurtry introduced a large number of law reform bills and was largely responsible for family law reform in Ontario. In 1978, he took the first steps to make Ontario&#x27;s legal system bilingual and to start the process of translating Ontario&#x27;s statutes into French. He was a major advocate for human rights and improved race relations.

McMurtry was also the provincial minister responsible for emergency planning. During the 1979 Mississauga train derailment, he largely deferred to Mayor Hazel McCallion, who was the public face of the crisis handling.

====Patriating the Constitution====
McMurtry was a Red Tory, and he was one of Davis&#x27;s closest advisers in government. As Attorney-General, he had been a primary negotiator for Ontario in the Trudeau-era constitutional negotiations. He appeared as counsel for Ontario in the Patriation Reference before the Supreme Court of Canada. In November 1981, he played a major role in brokering the deal that achieved patriation of the Canadian Constitution and the creation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. A late-night &quot;kitchen accord&quot; between McMurtry, Jean Chrétien and Roy Romanow on 6 November 1981 broke a deadlock in negotiations, and resulted in the governments of all provinces except Quebec agreeing to the proposed reforms to the Constitution, which came into law the following year.

====Susan Nelles prosecution====
One of McMurtry&#x27;s lowest points was his role in the prosecution of nurse Susan Nelles, who was charged with the murder of a number of infants at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. The charges were dropped following a preliminary hearing and Nelles was exonerated by the Grange Commission, a royal commission called upon to examine the deaths. McMurtry was criticized for his Ministry&#x27;s role in her wrongful prosecution. In a 2007 interview, McMurtry, looking back at the incident, said &quot;I can remember that I had been away with my family on a school break, when I came back and saw the headlines, I brought in my deputy attorney-general, and said: &#x27;What the hell is going on here? You&#x27;ve had a nurse arrested at one of the world&#x27;s most famous hospitals?&#x27; &quot; McMurtry said that local prosecutors failed to consult the ministry before consenting to the charges and that examining the case McMurtry had doubts that Nelles had exclusive access to all of the children.

====Bathhouse raids====
McMurtry was also Attorney-General at the time of the 1981 Toronto bathhouse raids which were widely denounced as one of the most socially regressive acts in the province&#x27;s history. At the time it was widely believed that the raids were approved by McMurtry. In a 2007 interview, however, McMurtry said that this was not the case. &quot;The irony of the whole thing was that I had expressed my concern to the chief of police; that it really looked like we were dissolving into a police state. The whole thing looked terrible. Without a doubt, that was one of my most frustrating experiences,&quot; said McMurtry.

===Leadership race===
When Davis resigned as Progressive Conservative leader and premier in 1985, McMurtry sought the party&#x27;s leadership at the party&#x27;s January 1985 leadership convention. He started as the underdog in the campaign, but impressed many delegates through his performance in candidates&#x27; debates and polling data showing him as the preferred choice of Ontario voters. During the contest, McMurtry was sometimes criticized for remaining too long in one portfolio. While his opponents all had diverse ministerial experience, McMurtry&#x27;s expertise was focused more narrowly on matters of the law. His supporters included Robert Elgie, Frank Drea, Reuben Baetz and Bob MacQuarrie.

McMurtry won a total of 300 votes on the first ballot, considerably more than had been expected. It was not sufficient, however, to place better than fourth in a field of four, after Frank Miller, Dennis Timbrell and Larry Grossman. He was eliminated from the contest and gave his support to Grossman, a fellow Red Tory.

McMurtry&#x27;s support was enough to move Grossman into second place on the second ballot, ahead of the more centrist Timbrell. Timbrell&#x27;s delegates were divided on the last ballot, which allowed the conservative Miller to win the convention. Miller gave McMurtry the option of remaining as Attorney General in the new government, but he declined and announced his retirement from politics.

===Cabinet posts===

==Diplomatic career==
On February 4, 1985, Canadian External Affairs Minister Joe Clark announced that McMurtry had been appointed to succeed Donald Jamieson as Canada&#x27;s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. He served in this capacity until 1988. Upon his return to Canada, he resumed his law practice and served from 1989 to 1990 as chairman and chief executive officer of the Canadian Football League.

==Judicial career==
McMurtry was appointed Associate Chief Justice of the Superior Court (Trial Division) in Ontario in 1991, and he became Chief Justice of that court in 1994. He became Chief Justice of Ontario in 1996, heading the entire court system in the province and leading the Court of Appeal for Ontario. That court gained a degree of public attention in 2003 when it ruled in &quot;Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)&quot; that provisions of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; guaranteeing equality under the law required the Province of Ontario to issue marriage licences to same-sex couples. For this, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; named McMurtry and his fellow judges the &quot;Nation Builders of 2003.&quot;

In the weeks prior to his retirement in 2007, McMurtry was widely praised as being a unifying force and consensus-builder during his tenure as Chief Justice. &quot;Under Chief Justice McMurtry&#x27;s leadership, we pulled together and we worked hard, and the chief justice reached out to the bar and he sought their support, and he got it,&quot; said Court of Appeal (and future Supreme Court Judge Michael Moldaver in a speech. &quot;Thanks to his courage, leadership and vision, we now have an appeal process that is capable of delivering quality justice in a timely and efficient manner.&quot;

&quot;I don&#x27;t want to paint him as the Next Coming, but he has been a great uniter,&quot; said Clifford Lax, a veteran Toronto civil litigator. &quot;He is a really very nice person who is able to find common ground. In a quiet, unassuming way, he has won a lot of converts to what he has done.&quot;

During his term, McMurtry also acted as the Mayor of Toronto&#x27;s race relations commissioner and helped create Pro Bono Ontario, which helps provide free legal services to the poor and encourages lawyers to provide &quot;pro bono&quot; services. In 2000, he initiated the Public Legal Education Task Force, leading to the establishment of the Ontario Justice Education Network. OJEN promotes understanding, education and dialogue to support a responsive and inclusive justice system.

McMurtry is credited with helping transform a backlogged and sometimes fractious court into a highly efficient, harmonious body.

==Post-bench legal career==
McMurtry returned to the practice of law after retiring from the bench. He was a member of the firm Gowling Lafleur Henderson LLP until August 2014, when he moved to Hull &amp; Hull LLP. McMurtry was a member of Pro Bono Law Ontario&#x27;s Advisory Board.

, McMurtry was president of the Osgoode Society for Canadian Legal History, which made several oral histories and co-published two of his books: 
* &quot;Memoirs and Reflections&quot; (Toronto: The Osgoode Society and the University of Toronto Press, 2013)
* &quot;Essays in the History of Canadian Law: Volume X – A Tribute to Peter Oliver&quot; (Toronto: The Osgoode Society and University of Toronto Press, 2008), 471 pp. (editor with Jim Phillips and John T. Saywell)

==Personal life==
McMurtry was married to Ria Jean Macrae, with whom he had six children and 12 grandchildren. His eldest son, Jim McMurtry, ran as a Liberal in British Columbia in the 2006 federal election, placing second to Conservative Russ Hiebert.

McMurtry was a landscape painter, originally taught by A.J. Casson, and donated pieces to charity auctions.

A Red Tory, McMurtry expressed dislike towards the Stephen Harper government from 2006 to 2015, claiming it suffered from a lack of compassion, as well as for causing more division in Canadian politics. McMurtry supported Eric Hoskins in the 2013 Ontario Liberal Party leadership election and Peter Elgie, Green Party of Canada candidate for the York-Simcoe riding in the 2014 Ontario general election and son of Robert Elgie, a Red Tory Progressive Conservative who served as Minister of Labour from 1978 to 1982 and MPP for York East from 1977 to 1985.

McMurtry died on March 18, 2024, at the age of 91.

==Honours==
In 2007, McMurtry was awarded the Order of Ontario. In 2009, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada &quot;for his distinguished career of public service, notably as chief justice of Ontario, and for his extensive volunteer involvement in many social and multicultural initiatives&quot;.

In 2013, McMurtry was given the G. Arthur Martin medal for outstanding contributions to criminal justice. He served as the 12th Chancellor of York University from 2008 to 2014.

The headquarters of the Attorney General of Ontario, the &quot;McMurtry-Scott Building&quot;, is named in honour of McMurtry and Ian Scott (Attorney General from 1985 to 1990).

<text>The Grand Prix de la ville d&#x27;Angoulême is a lifetime achievement award given annually during the Angoulême International Comics Festival to a comics author. Although not a monetary award, it is considered the most prestigious award in Franco-Belgian comics.

It has been awarded mainly to French and Belgian authors, but also to international authors. Recipients are, on average, 50 years old. Five women, Florence Cestac, Rumiko Takahashi, Julie Doucet, Posy Simmonds, and Anouk Ricard have been awarded the prize.

==History==
The prize was first awarded during the first Angoulême festival in 1974. Traditionally, the winner has been selected as the president of the board and the prize jury of next year&#x27;s festival. Since 1982, the winners have also drawn the next year&#x27;s festival poster. In 1984, cartoonist Claire Bretécher received a special tenth anniversary award apart from the main prize, a practice since repeated on subsequent anniversaries.

After 1989, the prize was awarded by a jury of all previous winners, except for the time from 1997 to 1999 when all creators attending the festival voted on the winner. The jury system was criticized for favoring cronyism and Franco-centrism, and was abandoned after 2012. Subsequent years have seen a variety of changing award mechanisms. In 2015, the winner was again selected by vote of all registered comics creators, based on a list of nominees.

In January 2016, 12 of the 30 nominees for the 2016 prize withdrew their names from consideration in protest against a shortlist of exclusively male nominees. Following media reports, the festival&#x27;s board first announced 6 additional female nominees,
 then retracted all nominees, allowing registered professionals to vote for any person.

<text>Nathan Bedford Forrest State Park is a state park in Benton County, Tennessee, in the southeastern United States. The park is situated on the western shore of the Kentucky Lake impoundment of the Tennessee River, just north of the community of Eva. Established in 1929, the park consists of managed by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.
The park is named after Confederate General and Ku Klux Klan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest (1821–1877), who conducted operations in the area during the U.S. Civil War. The park encompasses part of Forrest&#x27;s operational area during the 1864 Battle of Johnsonville, in which Forrest attacked and destroyed a Union supply depot and transfer station on the opposite bank of the river.

Along with the battle site, features in the park include Pilot Knob, which at is one of the highest points in West Tennessee, and the Tennessee River Folklife Center, which interprets life in the lower Tennessee Valley in the 19th and 20th centuries.

==Geographical setting==
The Tennessee River enters the Benton County/Humphreys County area from the south, where it absorbs the Duck River and the Beech River, and proceeds northwestward for another before emptying into the Ohio River. Kentucky Lake, created with the completion of Kentucky Dam in 1944, covers a stretch of the river between Kentucky Dam (near Paducah) and Pickwick Landing Dam, near the Tennessee-Alabama border to the south. Nathan Bedford Forrest State Park is situated along the western bank of Kentucky Lake, approximately upstream from Kentucky Dam.

Pilot Knob is the pinnacle of a ridge that extends approximately northwestwardly to the Harmon Creek valley, along the park&#x27;s northwestern boundary. Much of the park&#x27;s topography consists of ridges and hollows that run roughly parallel to Pilot Knob Ridge. The park&#x27;s offices are located on the slopes of Pilot Knob, and the Tennessee River Folklife Center and hiking trailheads are located at its summit.

State Route 191, which terminates atop Pilot Knob, connects the park to Interstate 40 and U.S. Route 70 to the south.

==History==

The Benton County area has been occupied on a semi-permanent basis for at least 7000 years. In 1940, University of Tennessee archaeologists excavated a substantial Archaic period (8000-1000 BC) site along Cypress Creek, near the park&#x27;s southern boundary. The actual site— named the Eva site after the nearby community— is now submerged by Kentucky Lake. At the Eva site, University of Tennessee archaeologists Thomas Lewis and Madeline Kneburg uncovered 180 human burials and artifacts dating to roughly 5200 BC. The area saw sporadic occupation during the Woodland and Mississippian periods, although the population had dwindled considerably by the 17th century.

By the time Euro-American settlers arrived, the eastern Benton County area was traversed by several well-beaten paths, or &quot;traces.&quot; Before inundation, the stretch of the Tennessee River between Benton and Humphreys counties was relatively low, making it a popular crossing point. The Cisco and Middle Tennessee Trace ran north-to-south, connecting the Benton County area with the Pinson Mounds in Madison County to the southwest. Near the modern US-70 bridge, the trail intersected the Lower Harpeth and West Tennessee Trace, which ran east-to-west.

===The Battle of Johnsonville===
In the Fall of 1864, at the height of the U.S. Civil War, General William T. Sherman captured the city of Atlanta and began making preparations to march south to Savannah. Hoping to lure Sherman northward, General John Bell Hood initiated maneuvers intended to cut Union supply lines in Tennessee. As Hood moved west, General Nathan B. Forrest moved northeast from Corinth, Mississippi, reaching the Tennessee-Kentucky line on October 28, and proceeding south along the river. In early November, Forrest managed to secretly position his artillery on the west bank of the river, opposite the Federal supply depot at Johnsonville. Although most of Forrest&#x27;s operations were concentrated around the now-submerged sloughs just north of the modern Eva boat ramp, Forrest did manage to position two guns atop Pilot Knob, which offered a more direct line of fire into the Federal fortifications.

During the war, Johnsonville was established as the western terminus of the Nashville and Northwestern Railroad, which connected the Lower Tennessee Valley with Nashville. Massive amounts of food and munitions were stored at Johnsonville, where they awaited transfer from boat-to-train or vice versa. The position was heavily fortified and guarded by 2,000 Union soldiers and several gunboats. When Forrest opened fire on the morning of November 4, however, Union commanders within the fort panicked. Fearing that Forrest would overwhelm the fort, Union troops burned their gunboats and transport vessels, and attempted to evacuate the fort by train. At Waverly, the train abandoned its load of supplies, and continued eastward to Nashville.

Forrest managed to retreat back to Corinth before the arrival of Union reinforcements. Union losses included 8 dead or wounded and 150 captured. Forrest reported 2 dead and 9 wounded. Union forces lost millions of dollars worth of supplies, ammunition, and vessels, and a rumor that Forrest was marching northward caused a general panic among Union forces in the Ohio Valley. The site of Johnsonville (typically called &quot;Old Johnsonville&quot; to distinguish from the modern New Johnsonville) is now protected by Johnsonville State Historic Park.

===Establishment of Nathan Bedford Forrest State Park===
Much of the land along the park&#x27;s southern section was once owned by the Pafford family, who arrived in the mid-19th century. The Paffords held Independence Day celebrations near the modern park entrance that drew visitors from all over the county, and eventually featured Grand Ole Opry performers. The Paffords aided General Forrest during the Battle of Johnsonville, and eventually served as the park&#x27;s first caretakers.

In December 1929, the state of Tennessee established Nathan Bedford Forrest Memorial Park atop Pilot Knob, which had been donated by the Paffords. A road was built connecting Eva with Pilot Knob, where a memorial consisting of a granite obelisk had been erected. In the mid-to-late 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps and Works Progress Administration arrived to build the park&#x27;s roads, trails, and facilities.

==Facilities==

Facilities at Nathan Bedford Forrest State Park include seven rental cabins, an RV campground, two primitive campgrounds, a 64-person group lodge, and three boat ramps. The park maintains approximately of hiking trails, most of which consists of a loop trail with various shortcuts that can shorten the hike to 3, 5, or 10 miles.

==Tennessee River Folklife Museum==

The Tennessee River Folklife Museum is situated atop Pilot Knob at the end of State Route 191. The museum interprets the life and customs of people living along the lower Tennessee River in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The center includes audio and video recordings, old implements used in musseling and a fully preserved 1950s-era jon boat. The museum also houses a small nature center displaying fish and reptiles commonly found in the area.

==Controversy surrounding naming the park after Forrest==

After Forrest and the Confederate States of America lost the American Civil War, Forrest became the first Grand Wizard of the white supremacist hate group, the Ku Klux Klan. He held this position of leadership from 1867 to 1869.

By 1866, the year before Forrest became the first Grand Wizard of the KKK, the Klan was using public violence against black people and their allies as intimidation. They burned houses and attacked and killed black people, leaving their bodies on the roads. Due to the Klan&#x27;s history of white supremacy and racist violence during Forrest&#x27;s tenure as Grand Wizard (along with General Forrest&#x27;s troops&#x27; massacre of surrendered African-American Union soldiers at the Battle of Fort Pillow during the American Civil War in 1864), controversy has arisen in recent years over memorials and entities named for Forrest, including Nathan Bedford Forrest High School in Jacksonville, Florida, and a proposal in Mississippi to honor Forrest on one of the state&#x27;s specialty license plates. Nathan Bedford Forrest State Park is often mentioned amidst these controversies.

<text>Natchez Trace State Park is a state park located in western Tennessee, in the United States. It was named for the historic Natchez Trace woodland path, an important wilderness trail during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The park covers more than and features several wilderness trails, camping, horseback riding, and waterfront activities.

==History==

===Background===
Natchez Trace State Park gets its name from the Natchez Trace, a Natchez, Mississippi to Nashville, Tennessee woodland highway that was an important wilderness road for the American frontiersmen during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It had been in use as a trade path by the American Indians, however, for hundreds of years before that. A western spur of the trace ran through part of the modern-day park.

===The park===
The park was built during the New Deal on land bought from residents who could no longer farm the land due to erosion. Along with many acres of woodlands, the land included four lakes. A swimming beach and a 47-room resort inn and restaurant complex were built. Today, the park includes cabins, a group lodge, camping areas, picnicking sites, playgrounds, a ball-field, a regulation pistol firing range, hiking trails, a wrangler camp, of horse riding trails, a park store, and an archery range.

== Park activities ==

Cub Lake () offers swimming, jon-boats and paddle boats. Boats are rented between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Cub Lake offers a free public swim beach.
