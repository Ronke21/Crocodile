<text>The Hindustan Ambassador is an automobile that was manufactured by Indian manufacturer Hindustan Motors from 1957 to 2014, with improvements and changes over its production lifetime. The Ambassador was based on the Morris Oxford Series III model, first made by Morris Motors Limited at Cowley, Oxford in the United Kingdom from 1956 to 1959.

Despite its British origins, the Ambassador was considered as a definitive Indian car and was fondly called the &quot;King of Indian roads&quot;. The automobile was manufactured by Hindustan Motors at its Uttarpara plant near Kolkata, West Bengal. On 11 February 2017, Hindustan Motors executed an agreement with PSA Group for the sale of the Ambassador brand, including the trademarks, for a consideration of . The tie-up entailed two joint-venture agreements between the companies of the two groups.

==History==

===Design and development===
The Ambassador was basically the same Morris Oxford Series III, launched by Morris, then a part of British Motor Corporation. In 1956 it sold the rights and tooling to Hindustan Motors as it had done for its previous Series I and Series II models which were sold by Hindustan Motors as Hindustan 14 and Landmaster. The Series III model itself was a derivative of the Morris Oxford Series II model which was developed prior to the Austin and Morris merger.

The car was quite spacious due to its semi-monocoque design which was quite an advancement in the early 1950s in vehicle engineering. The car was designed by Alec Issigonis among whose other designs were the Mini and Morris Minor. The Ambassador replaced the Morris Oxford Series II based Hindustan Landmaster, which was quite similar, and the larger Hindustan Deluxe based on the Chevrolet Deluxe.

===Birla Group===
Hindustan Motors Limited (HM), part of the Birla group was India&#x27;s pioneering car manufacturing company and later a flagship company of the C.K. Birla Group. The company was established just before Indian independence, in 1942 by B.M. Birla. They began operations in a small assembly plant in Port Okha near Gujarat by assembling the then Morris 10 as the Hindustan 10.

In the mid-1950s, they planned to upgrade their existing Hindustan models based on the Morris Oxford Series Il (&quot;Hindustan Landmaster&quot;), and eventually acquired rights for the new Morris Oxford Series III. The car initially came with a side-valve engine but was later improved with an overhead-valve engine. The Ambassador was quite innovative, with a fully enclosed monocoque chassis, making it spacious inside.

The Morris MO Series models (the earlier one and its next model with a new front grille) were by 1949 introduced, as the Hindustan 14. The production continued till 1954, after which the Landmaster based on the Morris Oxford Series II was introduced, with the same 1476 cc side valve engine, drawn from the earlier Hindustan 14. The same engine was used for the older Ambassadors Mark I from 1958 till 1960.

===Production years===
The political influence of the Birla family helped ensure that the Ambassador was one of the few cars that were in production following the 1954 government policy of promoting an indigenous Automobile industry. It dominated the market for several decades, mostly due to its spacious size and ruggedness compared to its rivals like the Premier Padmini and Standard 10. By the early 1980s, the comparatively expensive Ambassador&#x27;s low fuel economy and poor quality began to hinder sales. It still represented more than two thirds of Indian car production, but wait lists were down to 12 months while the Premier Padmini had a wait list nearly five years long. The Ambassador remained dominant in the official and company sectors, while also popular as a taxi, but private motorists gradually abandoned the &quot;Amby&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s.

Production of Hindustan Ambassador at its plants outside the cities of Kolkata and Chennai ended owing to weak demand and financing problems. Prior to the cancellation, the company had sold 2,200 Ambassadors in the financial year which ended in March 2014, only a tenth of the sales the Ambassador reached in the mid-eighties.

In 2022, HM confirmed that the company was working with the French Auto maker Peugeot to bring back Ambassador in its new design whose work was already in advanced stages. Earlier in 2017 Hindustan Motors had sold the Ambassador brand to the French auto manufacturer Peugeot for Rs 80 crore.

=== Reimported into UK ===
The car was briefly imported to the United Kingdom in 1992 (as the Fullbore Mark 10). The cars were retrofitted with a heater and seat belts in order to comply with European safety legislation, but only a tiny number were ever sold and the importer went into liquidation.

===Reintroduction===
On 28 May 2022 Hindustan reported that the Ambassador nameplate will be reintroduced with a new engine and design. It was also reported that the design process for the revived Ambassador&#x27;s new engine was already in an advanced stage of development, and that the new models would be produced at Hindustan&#x27;s production line in Chennai.

==Evolution==
The Ambassador remained in continuous production from its inception, with very few improvements or changes. 
In 1948, Hindustan Motors shifted its assembly plant from Port Okha in Gujarat to Uttarpara/Hindmotor in West Bengal&#x27;s Hooghly district and strengthened its manufacturing capacity in the automobile segment.

The 1954 Morris Oxford Series II in India was licence-built at Uttarpara, (Hooghly district), West Bengal, three years after its debut in England and labelled as the 1957 Hindustan Landmaster.

Engaged in the manufacture of the Ambassador, Contessa and utility vehicles like the Trekker, Porter and Pushpak, the plant hardly introduced any innovations or improvements. Hindustan Motors was the only manufacturing facility in the world to manufacture parts for the obsolete Bedford trucks.

Sale of Ambassador taxis has been outlawed since 1 April 2011, a year after BS IV emission standards were rolled out in 11 Indian cities, including Kolkata.

In later years, Hindustan Motors fitted the cars with a cleaner diesel engine in order to comply with new emission rules, allowing it to resume taxi service in Kolkata, one of the cities in which the vehicle had been banned.

==Models and versions==

===Mark I (1957 to 1962)===
In 1957, Hindustan Motors, to further earlier collaboration with Morris Motors, who by then had become British Motor Corporation after merger with Austin Motors, entered into an agreement to manufacture 1956 Morris Oxford Series III in India. All the tooling was transferred to Uttarpara plant in India. The car was rebadged as Ambassador (later called Mark 1) was launched in mid-1957 and the early model Morris Oxford Series II derived Hindustan Landmaster was discontinued. The new model included deep headlamp cowls and small rear wing &quot;tail fins&quot;. The dashboard and steering wheel were completely redesigned. The Landmaster&#x27;s flat-plane two-spoke steering wheel gave way to a dished steering wheel with three spokes made-up of four wires per spoke, for the Ambassador. Also a new, dimpled bonnet made its debut. These models had an Austin Motors derived 1476 cc side-valve petrol engine. In 1959 the side-valve engine was replaced by a 1489 cc, 55 bhp overhead-valve BMC B-series petrol engine.

===Mark II (1962 to 1975)===

In January 1962, the Ambassador underwent a frontal facelift with a closely chequered grille more reminiscent of the Morris Mini. The interior had a redesigned dashboard and instrument cluster. The early models have sun mica sheet but it was replaced by wood grain coated plywood and aluminium bezel in later models (1968 onwards). This model was named as Ambassador Mark II, and the early version quickly got dubbed as Mark I in the market, while it was never officially christened such in its production days.

The mid-sixties model again had minor changes to the tail lamp with integrated lens for indicator and brake lamp and the tall ornamented bumper stopper from the Mark I was redesigned with a smaller chrome metal stopper keep with the times. This model was sold until mid-1975 and eventually was replaced by the Mark III model. Being one of the ubiquitous early models of Ambassador numerous older versions can be found in restoration, garages and in numerous Indian movies of that era. In its final years in 1975 it had no competition other than the Premier Padmini and its smaller rival the Standard Gazel.

A short-lived estate or wagon version was launched in the early 1970s, the Ambassador Estate.

===Mark III (1975 to 1979)===
In 1975, the Mark 3 version was launched with another frontal facelift. The front grille had horizontal louvres giving it a modern feel and a round profile indicator lamp now isolated from the grille. At the rear a more modern looking number plate bezel replaced the early design which was commonly used by many other British cars as well. The interior now had a new dashboard with 3 standard instruments mounted on a black recessed mesh again moving away from the early coated wooden base with aluminium strip design. By 1978, the Mark 3 was available in its Standard and Deluxe versions. The Deluxe version had a newer dashboard with four meters plus the speedometer. Just before the launch of the Mark 4, the Mark 3s had their front windscreen wiper configuration changed, with a common direction sweep for both wipers. This configuration was prevalent in the new Ambassadors till the end. This has a short span of less than 3 years in production before being replaced with a Mark - IV model in 1977.

In 1977 and 1978, the Ambassador Mark 3 was available with a 1760 cc version of the Morris 1.5-litre inline-four, specifically to have enough power to propel a full air conditioning system. This option continued to be available as a Mark IV, but very few were sold and it was discontinued in 1979.

===Mark 4 (1979 to 1990)===
In 1979, the Ambassador&#x27;s front underwent a major facelift departing from the flatter design of the 1950s which was retained till its end in 2014. The front grille was much smaller in height with a larger chequered grille and square park lamps. Now separate amber indicator lamps were incorporated on the semi front lip spoiler below the bumper which was mounted higher up. This model was named as the Mark IV. In addition to the existing petrol version, a diesel variant was launched in 1980, powered by a 1489 cc, 37 bhp BMC B-series diesel engine. It was the first diesel car in India and was well received by the Indians, although it was initially only available as a taxi or for government usage, as the Indian government restricted private ownership of diesel automobiles. It was, at the time, the most expensive car built in India, at a 25 percent markup over a petrol Mark 4.

The Mark IV was the last of the Mark cars. For a short period, the cars were available as Deluxe and later it was renamed Ambassador Nova. The Ambassador of 1990 (except for the front cowl area) was virtually identical to the 1956 original, with most changes being light and cosmetic. The changes were mainly the front styling and minor changes to the dashboard. This technological stagnation was mainly because of the protectionist policies being pursued by the Indian government at the time, and there was little incentive on the part of Indian companies to innovate. During that time, the newly Hindustan Contessa started getting produced, intended to replace the Ambassador, however, the Ambassador proved to be more popular, and so surpassed the Contessa in production.

The car celebrated the Golden Jubilee of its production in 2008 (1958–2008). The Ambassador has emerged as the car mass-produced for the longest period, with minimal design changes, on the same assembly line (Uttarpara, West Bengal, India) in the whole world until 2014.

It was during the Mark IV&#x27;s model run that India launched a controlled economic liberalisation in the mid-1980s which allowed many Japanese companies to establish joint ventures in India. Maruti Suzuki launched its Maruti 800 in the then non-existing small car category. The then existing manufacturers Standard Motors, Premier Automobiles Limited and Hindustan Motors were licensed for larger category cars. The Ambassador still remained the principal family car of choice in the middle segment in spite being a pre-modern design with dated styling. The company also earmarked for a major upgrade for its mechanical and power plant systems, creating a model later launched as Nova.

===Ambassador Nova===

The Ambassador Nova was launched in 1990 in two variants—a 55 bhp petrol-powered Deluxe version and a 37 bhp diesel-powered Diesel DX version. The Ambassador Nova received a newly designed steering wheel, new steering column, better brakes and electricals. The brake pedal was now top-hinged, while the earlier central instrumentation flanked by two glove compartments was replaced by a more conventional setup with a single glovebox. It also had some cosmetic changes which included a new radiator grille, while retaining the square turn signals of the earlier Mark IV.

=== Ambassador 1800 ISZ, Classic===
In an attempt to increase its appeal, in 1992 another version became available. Dubbed the Ambassador 1800 ISZ, this model featured a 75 bhp 1817 cc Isuzu inline-four engine and a five-speed manual gearbox with a floor shift. This also had the benefit of allowing the option of bucket seats, as opposed to the earlier bench seats. Also, the entire dashboard was redesigned. Instrumentation panels were shifted from the centre of the dashboard to the right, behind the steering wheel. Seat belts became standard.

The Isuzu 1817 cc engine that was used in its luxury model HM Contessa 1.8 GL that produced a power of 88 bhp was slightly detuned for the new Ambassador. The same power plant was available since 1985, for the special order armour plated, VIP models. By the early 1990s, this 1817 cc/ 75 bhp (at 5000 rpm), OHC, Isuzu engine, that had four in-line cylinders and a max torque of 13.8 Kgm at 3000 rpm, was available as an option, in all the Ambassadors commonly available for sale and this very reliable modern Japanese engine proved to be a success that would last its entire production run.

This model gained the &quot;Classic&quot; moniker at the 1998 Delhi Motor Show, and Ambassador Classics have since been available with the gamut of 1.5 to 2.0-liter petrol, CNG, and diesel engines installed across the Ambassador lineup. The 1500 diesel engine, the main seller for Hindustan, did not pass Bharat IV emissions and as of 2011 it was no longer allowed to be sold in 13 of India&#x27;s major cities. This meant the end of the Classic range, as it eliminated most of the taxi market.

===Final Generation===

====Ambassador Grand====


The Ambassador Grand was launched in 2003 and as per the manufacturer, the new version had 137 changes compared to its predecessor. The changes included a switch to body coloured wrap around bumpers, camel coloured interiors, fabric seats, remote shift gear lever, moulded roof and door trims, Salisbury axle, bigger rear wheel drums, improved suspension with anti roll bar and Metlon bushes, central door lock, factory fitted music system and an optional sun roof. The acoustic insulation of the Ambassador Grand was developed by of France. The Grand version of Ambassador was available only in 2.0L and 1.8L engines at first and later in 2007 the 1.5L model was added to the line.
====Ambassador Avigo====

The Avigo model launched in 2004 was the most radical revision of the venerated Ambassador, a part of a brand revitalisation kicked off in the middle of 2003. The change of name, a break from the Ambassador marque, indicated a different marketing strategy. The Avigo was launched in the summer of 2004. The revitalized lineup consisted of the Ambassador Classic of mid-2003, the Ambassador Grand of late 2003, and the aforementioned Avigo, with the exterior designed by Manvindra Singh. However, the most overpowering influence on the front bonnet has been that of the original Landmaster series (also based on Morris Oxford). The main panels at the rear remained the same but the tail lamp and name plate bezels were redesigned. In interior the Avigo, however, has much more classic-touch internals. The entire dashboard console was redesigned with a classic retro theme reminiscent of the early models with central mounted meter new clusters (like the Mark IV models). Seats were specially built for this model with dual tone beige coloured scheme and wood-grain interiors. A factory fitted 6CD Kenwood audio system and new air-conditioning system was installed. The car was priced higher than the existing models.

====Ambassador Encore====
This new model was launched in 2013, to match the BS IV standards of the metropolitan cities with the 1.5-liter diesel. This version was developed with the aid of Austria&#x27;s Magna Steyr. The new car looks just like an Ambassador Grand and has the same overall dimensions as that of the BS III Ambassadors, although power had climbed to . The steering wheel was the two-spoke affair first seen in the Nova. In 2013, left-hand drive versions were still built in small numbers for export, to tertiary markets like Nigeria.

===Other variants===

====Extended version====
Many local customisers offer stretched versions. One such manufacturer was Parikh, whose effort was called the Harsh.

===Customised version===
Car designer Dilip Chhabria created a concept inspired by the Ambassador version, the Ambierod. This car was not manufactured by Hindustan Motors nor was it based on the Ambassador. Several styling cues, however, have been borrowed from the Ambassador.

==Engines==

In the early 1990s, the old Austin-designed B-Series OHV straight-4 BMC 1.5L petrol engine was replaced in favour of an Isuzu 1.8 litre engine and became the fastest production car in India, beating Fiats, and the Maruti Suzuki cars at that time. The engines currently available are the 1500 DSL (1.5L 37 bhp diesel engine), 1800 ISZ (1.8 L 75 bhp MPFI petrol engine), 2000 DSZ (2.0 L 50 bhp Isuzu diesel engine) and 2000 DSZ Turbo (2.0 L 75 bhp turbocharged intercooled Isuzu diesel engine.

In the late 1970s a limited batch of Mark III Ambassadors were produced with 1,760 cc engines. They were fitted with Constant Velocity SU side-draft carburettors of an earlier era instead of the more common indigenous variable velocity Solex down-draft units. The engine blocks of these cars had &quot;1760&quot; etched on them instead of the usual &quot;1500&quot;. These were probably produced to handle the extra load of the piston-driven air conditioner compressors available in those days. The trim (metal beading) of these cars were a throwback to the sixties because they were chrome plated instead of aluminium.

== Reception ==
The Ambassador was claimed to be the best taxi in the world by &quot;Top Gear&quot; in Episode 2 of their 20th series.

An article by Hormazd Sorabjee entitled &quot;An Epitaph for India&#x27;s &quot;Appalling&quot; National Car&quot; appeared in a July 2014 issue of BBC Magazine.

<doc id="881518" wikidata="Q1228590" url="?curid=881518" title="Discretionary access control">
<text>In computer security, discretionary access control (DAC) is a type of access control defined by the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) as a means of restricting access to objects based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which they belong. The controls are in the sense that a subject with a certain access permission is capable of passing that permission (perhaps indirectly) on to any other subject (unless restrained by mandatory access control).

Discretionary access control is commonly discussed in contrast to mandatory access control (MAC). Occasionally, a system as a whole is said to have &quot;discretionary&quot; or &quot;purely discretionary&quot; access control when that system lacks mandatory access control. On the other hand, systems can implement both MAC and DAC simultaneously, where DAC refers to one category of access controls that subjects can transfer among each other, and MAC refers to a second category of access controls that imposes constraints upon the first.

== Implementation ==
The meaning of the term in practice is not as clear-cut as the definition given in the TCSEC standard, because the TCSEC definition of DAC does not impose any implementation. There are at least two implementations: with owner (as a widespread example) and with capabilities.

=== With owner ===
The term DAC is commonly used in contexts that assume that every object has an &quot;owner&quot; that controls the permissions to access the object, probably because many systems do implement DAC using the concept of an owner. But the TCSEC definition does not say anything about owners, so technically an access control system doesn&#x27;t have to have a concept of ownership to meet the TCSEC definition of DAC.

Users (owners) have under this DAC implementation the ability to make policy decisions and/or assign security attributes. A straightforward example is the Unix file mode which represent write, read, and execute in each of the 3 bits for each of User, Group and Others. (It is prepended by another bit that indicates additional characteristics).

=== With capabilities ===
As another example, capability systems are sometimes described as providing discretionary controls because they permit subjects to transfer their access to other subjects, even though capability-based security is fundamentally not about restricting access &quot;based on the identity of subjects&quot;. In general, capability systems do not allow permissions to be passed &quot;to any other subject&quot;; the subject wanting to pass its permissions must first have access to the receiving subject, and subjects generally only have access to a strictly limited set of subjects consistent with the principle of least privilege.

<text>Brixen (; , ; or , ) is a town and commune in South Tyrol, northern Italy, located about north of Bolzano.

==Geography==
Brixen is the third-largest city and oldest town in the province, with a population of nearly twenty-three thousand. It is located at the confluence of the Eisack and Rienz rivers, and today it is the capital of the Eisack district community.

The Brenner Pass, on the Italian-Austrian border, is 45 km to the north of Brixen, and Bolzano lies 40 km to the south. To the east lies the Plose mountain massif with three peaks, the closest of which being the Telegraph peak (Monte Telegrafo) (2,486 m), formally known as Fröllspitze. On the western side, there is the Königsangerspitze mountain (Monte Pascolo) (2,439 m) and the Pfeffersberg slope (Monteponente), both of which are located within the Sarntal Alps.

Brixen is especially known for its skiing, with a major ski resort, the Plose.

===&quot;Frazioni&quot;===
Brixen is made up of about 22 smaller villages and hamlets called &quot;frazioni&quot;. They include: Afers/Eores, Albeins/Albes, Elvas, Gereuth/Caredo, Karnol/Cornale, Klerant/Cleran, Kranebitt/Costa d&#x27;Elvas, Mahr/Elvas La Mara, Mairdorf/Villa, Mellaun/Meluno, Milland/Millan, Pairdorf/Perara, Pinzagen/Pinzago, Plabach/Rivapiana, Rutzenberg/Monte Ruzzo, Sarns/Sarnes, St. Andrä/Sant&#x27;Andrea, St. Leonhard/San Leonardo, Tils/Tiles, Tötschling/Tecelinga, Tschötsch/Scezze, and Untereben.

== Name and etymology ==
The reconstruction of the pre-Roman name of Brixen has been debated. Some linguists have proposed a Celtic form *&quot;Brigsa&quot; or &quot;*Brigsina&quot;, built on the root &quot;brig-&quot; (&#x27;hill, hillfort&#x27;)&quot;.&quot; However, the toponym is probably first recorded as &quot;Pressena&quot; in the Quartinus Charter of 828, then appears as &quot;Prihsna&quot; in 901, which may point to a proto-form *&quot;Prixina&quot;. According to Diether Schürr, archaeological finds in Stufels (the early settlement area of Brixen) point to a Rhaetian rather than Celtic culture in pre-Roman times. While Celts may have renamed the site at some point, Schürr argues, the evidence suggests that the name &quot;Brixen&quot; could be pre-Celtic in origin.

==History==
The area of Brixen has been settled since the Upper Paleolithic (8th millennium BC). Other settlements from the late Stone Age have been found and in 15 BC, the area was conquered by the Romans, who had their main settlement in the nearby Säben (Sabiona). They held it until around 590, when it was occupied by Bavarians.

The first mention of Brixen dates to 901 in a document issued by the King of Germany, Louis III the Child, in which the farm of &quot;Prihsna&quot; was presented to Bishop Zacharias of Säben. As time passed, &#x27;Prihsna&#x27; turned into the current name of Brixen. The bishops moved here from Säben in 992, after the cathedral had been finished.

In 1048, the Bishop of Brixen, Poppo, was made pontiff as Pope Damasus II by emperor Henry III. His reign was especially short, lasting only 23 days before dying. Rumours circulated that Poppo had been poisoned by Gerhard Brazutus, an ally to both Pope Benedict IX, whom Poppo had just dethroned, and to be Pope Gregory VII. These claims have not proven to be substantial and a modern conjecture suggests he died of malaria.

On 15 June 1080, at the request of Henry III, the synod of Brixen condemned Pope Gregory VII over the Investiture Controversy, a conflict during the 11th and 12th centuries over the ability to appoint bishops.

In 1115, a first line of walls encircling Brixen was completed. In 1174, and later again in 1234 and 1445, Brixen was devastated by fires.

During the German mediatisation in 1802, Brixen was awarded to the Austrian Empire, only to be ceded to the Bavarians in 1805 after the Austrians suffered a great loss to Napoleon and his Allies at the Battle of Austerlitz. The Bavarians set up the District Court of Brixen, a regional judicial and administrative court for South Tyrol. The court only lasted nine years before in 1814, the Congress of Vienna returned Brixen to the Austrians.

Some time between 1851 and 1855, the Czech journalist and writer Karel Havlíček Borovský was exiled to Brixen by the Austrian government.

In 1866, after the Austro-Prussian War, the Austrians were on the verge of collapse. In 1867 the Austro-Hungarian Compromise was arranged. This established a dual monarchy comprising Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary, which were respectively known unofficially as Cisleithania and Transleithania. South Tyrol, including Brixen, was part of Cisleithania.

In 1915, the Treaty of London was concluded. Its objective was, in part, to entice Italy to join the Triple Entente. One provision, Article 4, promised the Italians the largely German-speaking Austrian territory of South Tyrol, which would create a new Italian-Austrian frontier. In 1919, after the victories of the allies, Brixen, along with the rest of South Tyrol, was awarded to Italy by the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

Under Mussolini, Brixen and the surrounding villages experienced an enormous growth, as part of the fascist effort to consolidate territorial subdivisions in the country. In 1928, this included the addition of Milland, Sarns, and Albeins, as well as Elvas and Kranebitt which were annexed from Natz, a neighbouring municipality.

During WW2, the Austrians attempted to reclaim South Tyrol but were unsuccessful.

After the war, Austria deemed the post-war treaty to be unsatisfactory, raising The South Tyrolean Question (&quot;Die Südtirolfrage&quot;). The Austrians believed, along with the South Tyroleans, that the region should be autonomous to protect minorities. South Tyrol has 69.4% native German-speaking population, and a 4.5% native Ladin-speaking population, with the two languages making up a majority in 111 out of the 116 municipalities in South Tyrol.

In 1972, South Tyrol, as a part of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, was granted autonomy.

==Coat-of-arms==
The oldest coat of arms dates back to 1297 with the lamb, known then from 1304 as a symbol of the lamb. On 13 November 1928, a shield with the city walls and a gate on the lawn in the upper half and the lamb in the lower was adopted. The emblem is a turned argent lamb with an or halo on a gules background; the right foreleg supports a flag with a gules cross. The emblem was granted in 1966.

==Main sights==
* The Cathedral (10th century), dedicated to the Assumption of Mary, was rebuilt in the 13th century and again in 1745–54 along Baroque lines. The ceiling of the nave has a large fresco by Paul Troger portraying the &quot;Adoration of the Lamb&quot;.
* The &quot;Hofburg&quot;, a Renaissance Bishop&#x27;s Palace (started in the 13th century), one of the main noble residences in South Tyrol. The Diocesan Museum has several artworks, including a presepe with 5,000 figures created for Bishop Karl Franz Lodron.
* The round parish church of &quot;Saint Michael&quot; (11th century). The Gothic choir and the bell tower are from the 15th century while the nave is from the 16th. The main artwork is a wooden &quot;Cireneus&quot; from the 15th century.
* The Pharmacy Museum (Pharmaziemuseum Brixen), located in a nearly 500-year-old townhouse, shows the development and changes of the local pharmacy. The Peer family (now the 7th generation) has run this pharmacy since 1787, always in the same location. The museum&#x27;s carefully restored rooms illustrate the development of the pharmaceutical profession over the centuries and the changes in remedies used, from the testicles of a beaver and pieces of an ancient Egyptian mummy to modern plasters and lyophilisates. All the objects and medicines on display were in use over the centuries. The museum also has a library for historical research and the archive of the Peer family. In a separate room there is a multimedia display of the history of the family.
*The White Tower (also known as &quot;Weißer Turm&quot;) was completed in 1591, but subsequently modified. The 72-meter-tall tower, which is located next to the parish church of Saint Michael, is inside the city walls in the historic center of Brixen. It contains a complex carillon mechanism of 43 bells, which ring every day at 11:00 a.m. and can play more than a hundred different tunes. On the top floor there is a large roof where it is possible to observe the circumstances. The Tower also has a lunar clock. The architecture of the tower belongs to the Gothic Architecture and is one of the few remaining in South Tyrol. It is the cultural heritage monument with the number 14186 in South Tyrol. The White Tower is used as a museum since 2007.

Outside the city is Rodeneck Castle, one of the most powerful of its time. It has precious frescoes from the early 13th century. Also important are &quot;Reifenstein Castle&quot; and &quot;Trostburg&quot; Castle in Waidbruck. In the latter lived the adventurer and minstrel Oswald von Wolkenstein.

<text>Paris Landing State Park is an 841-acre (3.4 km2) state park located on the western bank of Kentucky Lake in Buchanan, Henry County, Tennessee.

The park is located inland from the original site of Paris Landing which served steamboat traffic on the Tennessee River. The site is now under the waters of Kentucky Lake, which was created by TVA when the Tennessee River was dammed in 1944.

==Amenities==
Lodging is available at the 91-room lodge, in 10 3-bedroom cabins, 45 campsites with water and electricity and 18 primitive campsites. The lodge contains a restaurant, bar, lounge, gift shop and a conference center.
A full-service marina is also located in the park features boat slips, gas and a bait shop.

The marina, along with the spacious lodge and conference center, have played host to dozens of professional crappie and bass tournaments.

===Golf course===
The Paris Landing State Park Golf Course is a Par 72, 18-hole course situated on the western shore of Kentucky Lake. The entire course is tree-lined, and therefore provides some privacy screening for players on the course. Several holes skirt the Kentucky Lake, producing a natural balance of rolling land, trees, and water. Through the years Paris Landing has hosted numerous collegiate and high school championships.

The course opened in 1971. In 1994 Hole #12 was redesigned lengthening the hole by approximately 75 to 100 yards and relocating the green to include the vistas of the lake, while greens on Hole #7 and Hole #13 were rebuilt in 1996–1997. Hole #12 is a 586-yard, par 5 with an elevated green again overlooking the Kentucky Lake. The signature hole #4 is a downhill 186-yard par 3 with the Kentucky Lake providing a scenic backdrop.

==Summer activities==
The park is most often visited in the summer season. Many families use the facilities for various events such as barbecues, picnics, fireworks, recreational activities, etc. On Independence Day, the park is full of visitors there to watch the show of fireworks. The clear setting of the lake provides a beautiful backdrop to the fireworks show. During the summer the pool is open for swimming, as well as the lake. Many boats and fishing equipment can be seen out on the waters in the summer season.

<text>Elisabeth Veronika Mann Borgese, (24 April 1918 – 8 February 2002) was an internationally recognized expert on maritime law and policy and the protection of the environment. Called &quot;the mother of the oceans&quot;, she received the Order of Canada and awards from the governments of Austria, China, Colombia, Germany, the United Nations and the World Conservation Union. 

Elisabeth was a child of Nobel Prize–winning German author Thomas Mann and his wife Katia Mann. Born in Germany, Elisabeth experienced displacement due to the rise of the Nazi Party and became a citizen first of Czechoslovakia, then of the United States, and finally of Canada.

Elisabeth Mann Borgese worked as a senior fellow at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara, California and as a university professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. She became a proponent of international cooperation and world federalism. In 1968, she was one of the founding members – and for a long time the only female member – of the Club of Rome. In 1970 she organized the first international conference on the law of the sea, &quot;Pacem in Maribus&quot; (&quot;Peace in the Oceans&quot;) in Malta, and helped to establish the International Ocean Institute (IOI) at the Royal University of Malta. From 1973 to 1982, Mann Borgese helped to develop the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). She also helped to establish the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.

== Family and citizenship ==
Elisabeth Veronika Mann was born in Munich, Germany, the youngest daughter of Katia Pringsheim and Nobel Prize winning German author Thomas Mann. Her uncle was novelist Heinrich Mann. Her brothers and sisters are Klaus, Erika (wife of W. H. Auden), Golo, Monika and Michael Mann. She was of Jewish descent from her mother&#x27;s side. Due to her being the granddaughter of Júlia da Silva Bruhns, she was also of Portuguese-Indigenous Brazilian partial descent.

The Mann family left Germany after Adolf Hitler came to power, moving first to Switzerland. On 11 February 1933, Thomas Mann and his wife Katje left Munich on what was planned as a lecture tour. Within weeks he was warned that the Nazi Party, which had recently come to power, was moving against him. His house and possessions, his published books, and initially his royalties were confiscated. Mann was warned to remain abroad but was dependent upon German citizenship for a valid passport. He began to explore the possibility of obtaining citizenship in Austria, Switzerland or Czechoslovakia.

Thomas Mann publicly indicated his opposition to the Nazi Party in an open letter to literary critic Eduard Korrodi of the &quot;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&quot;, dated 2 February 1936. On 18 August 1936, the town council of Proseč, Czechoslovakia, voted to accept Thomas Mann&#x27;s application for a Certificate of Domicile. Mann&#x27;s application was supported and expedited at high levels of government and as of 19 November 1936 he and other family members, including his minor children Elisabeth and Michael, were granted Czechoslovak citizenship.

Elisabeth studied piano and cello at the Conservatory of Music in Zürich, Switzerland, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in Classics and a diploma from the Conservatory of Music in Zurich in 1938. Among musicians, she is known for her translation of Heinrich Schenker&#x27;s &quot;Harmonielehre&quot; (1906) into English. As a result of excisions by the editor, Oswald Jonas, Mann Borgese&#x27;s translation &quot;Harmony&quot; (1954) is &quot;somewhat removed from what Schenker himself actually wrote.&quot; Nonetheless, her &quot;rough and ready&quot; translation was for many years one of the few versions available. 

On 10 February 1938, Thomas Mann travelled to the United States on a lecture tour. Following the annexation of Austria on 12 March 1938, he expressed grave concern over the appeasement policy and sought to become a citizen of the United States. Elisabeth accompanied her parents to the United States. Following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, their Czechoslovak passports were no longer considered valid. In 1941, Thomas Mann and other family members, including Elisabeth Mann Borgese, became citizens of the United States.

At the time of her death, Elisabeth Mann Borgese was the last living child of Thomas Mann. This came to prominence with the Emmy-winning docudrama TV mini-series &quot;Die Manns – Ein Jahrhundertroman&quot; (2001), in which she was shown in interviews with director Heinrich Breloer on different locations in Europe and the United States where her family once stayed. The &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; described her appearance in the interviews as &quot;unpretentious, wise and with a winning sense of humor&quot;. It marked the first time that she talked extensively about her family, and she agreed that she was the only one of the six children of Mann who felt totally reconciled with the shadow of their father.

==Marriage==
Elisabeth Mann married the anti-fascist Italian writer and professor of literature Giuseppe Antonio Borgese (1882–1952) in 1939. They had two daughters, Angelica (born 1940) and Dominica (born 1944). Mann Borgese also had a foster son, Marcel Dechamp. 

In 1952, G. A. Borgese died in Fiesole, Italy.

Elisabeth lived with psychiatrist and writer Corrado Tumiati (1885–1967) in her home in Fiesole (Florence, Italy) from 1953 until his death in 1967.

== University of Chicago ==
Mann Borgese moved to Chicago with her husband, who taught at the University of Chicago. With Richard McKeon and Robert Hutchins, G. A. Borgese formed the interdisciplinary Committee to Frame a World Constitution, which published a &quot;Preliminary Draft of a World Constitution&quot; in 1948. The members of the Committee at the time of the publication of the Draft were, in addition to Hutchins and Borgese, Mortimer J. Adler, Stringfellow Barr, Albert Léon Guérard, Harold Innis, Erich Kahler, Wilber G. Katz, Charles Howard McIlwain, Robert Redfield, and Rexford Tugwell. Elisabeth was the secretary of the Committee and edited its journal, &quot;Common Cause&quot;, which was published by the University of Chicago Press from 1947–1951.

In the mid-1960s, Mann Borgese worked as an editor, researcher and translator. She was editor of &quot;Intercultural Publications&quot; for the Ford Foundation from 1952 to 1964. She was for two years the executive secretary of the board of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. She worked as a translator with Max Rheinstein, who helped to establish the study of comparative law in the United States. She assisted Rheinstein and Edward A. Shils in translating parts of Max Weber&#x27;s &quot;Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft&quot;, published as &quot;Max Weber On Law In Economy And Society&quot;.

She experimented with writing science fiction, publishing several stories in 1959, which were collected in the anthology, &quot;To Whom It May Concern&quot; (1960). The pessimism of her speculative fiction is in strong contrast to her usual optimism. In 1963, Borgese published &quot;The Ascent of Woman&quot;, a sociological work suggesting that women were in the process of becoming &quot;men&#x27;s true equals&quot;.

== Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions==
With Robert Hutchins and others, Elisabeth moved to the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara, California, where she served as a senior fellow from 1964 to 1978. She wrote extensively on topics including peace, disarmament, human rights, world development, and the Law of the Sea. When the &quot;Constitution of the World&quot; was republished in 1965, Elisabeth Mann Borgese provided a critical introduction. In 1967, she began to focus specifically on marine law, working with Wolfgang Friedmann and Arvid Pardo, then Malta&#x27;s Ambassador to the United States. In 1968, she published &quot;The Ocean Regime&quot;, an early proposal for an international agency tasked with the care of ocean resources including the high seas and the continental shelf. By 1970, at the age of 52, Mann Borgese had established herself as an international expert on the oceans.

She was the initiator and organizer of the first international conference on the law of the sea, held at Malta in 1970, with the title of &quot;Pacem in Maribus&quot; (&quot;Peace in the Oceans&quot;). She also helped to establish the International Ocean Institute (IOI). It now has over 20 centres around the world. In connection with this work, she appeared on the syndicated version of the television game show To Tell the Truth in the spring of 1973.

She was the founder and founding senior editor of the International Ocean Institute&#x27;s primary publication, &quot;The Ocean Yearbook&quot;, which first appeared in 1978. and the editor of &quot;Ocean Frontiers&quot; (1992). She has also published short stories, children&#x27;s books and a play. She was editor of Intercultural Publications from 1952 to 1964 and research associate and editor of &quot;Common Cause&quot;, at the University of Chicago (1946–52).

From 1973 to 1982, Mann Borgese formed part of the expert group of the Austrian delegation during the development of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). She acted as an advisor to Ambassador Karl Wolf, who led the Austrian Delegation to UNCLOS III. She also helped to establish the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.

== Dalhousie University==
In 1979, Mann Borgese accepted a one-year fellowship as the Killam Senior Fellow at Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Invited to remain, she became professor of political science at Dalhousie in 1980, and an adjunct professor of law in 1996. She taught maritime law and political science, including a special international summer program for civil servants. She continued to work internationally, including consulting for international organizations such as UNIDO, UNESCO, and the World Bank.

In 1983, Elisabeth Mann Borgese became a Canadian citizen. She lived in an A-frame house on Sambro Head, fronting the ocean, near Sambro, Nova Scotia.

From 1987 to 1992 Mann Borgese served as chairperson of the International Centre for Ocean Development. She helped to develop programs in ocean management to train people from developing countries around the world.

<text>The Ambassador is an automobile manufactured and marketed by American Motors Corporation (AMC) from 1957 through 1974 over eight generations, available in two- and four-door sedan, two-door hardtop, four-door station wagon as well as two-door convertible body styles. It was classified as a full-size car from 1957 through 1961, mid-size from 1962 until 1966, and again full-size from 1967 through 1974 model years.

When discontinued, the &quot;Ambassador&quot; nameplate had been used from 1927 until 1974, the longest continuously used car nameplate until then. The &quot;Ambassador&quot; nameplate was used variously as the Ambassador V-8 by Rambler, Rambler Ambassador, and finally AMC Ambassador. Previously, the nameplate Ambassador applied to Nash&#x27;s full-size cars. The nameplate referred to a trim level between 1927 and 1931.

Ambassadors were continuously manufactured at AMC&#x27;s Lake Front plant in Kenosha, Wisconsin until 1974, as well as at AMC&#x27;s Brampton Assembly in Brampton, Ontario, between 1963 and 1966. Australian Motor Industries (AMI) assembled Ambassadors from knock-down kits with right-hand drive from 1961 until 1963. The U.S. fifth-generation Ambassadors were manufactured by Industrias Kaiser Argentina (IKA) in Córdoba, Argentina from 1965 until 1972, as well as assembled by ECASA in Costa Rica from 1965 through 1970. Planta REO assembled first-generation Ambassadors in Mexico at its Monterrey, Nuevo León plant. Fifth- and seventh-generation Ambassadors were modified into custom stretch limousines in Argentina and the U.S.
== Development ==
Following George W. Mason&#x27;s unexpected death in the fall of 1954, George Romney (whom Mason had been grooming as his eventual successor) succeeded him as president and CEO of the newly formed American Motors. Romney recognized that to be successful in the postwar marketplace, an automobile manufacturer would have to be able to produce and sell cars in sufficient volume to amortize the high cost of tooling. Toward that end, he set out to increase AMC&#x27;s market share with its Rambler models that were selling in market segment in which the domestic Big Three (General Motors, Ford Motor Company, and Chrysler) automakers did not yet compete. While the development of a redesigned 1958 Nash Ambassador, based on a stretched and reskinned 1956 Rambler body was almost complete, AMC&#x27;s designers were also working on a retrimmed Hudson equivalent, called Rebel, to offer Hudson dealers.

As sales of the large-sized Nash Ambassador and Hudson Hornet models slowed, Romney determined that consumer confidence in the historic Nash and Hudson nameplates had declined. Reluctantly, he decided that 1957 would be the end of both nameplates, and the company would concentrate on the new Rambler line, which was registered as a separate marque for 1957.

The market positioning meant that &quot;the AMC Ambassador was a car with no real competitors throughout most of the sixties&quot; because it was viewed as a luxury-type car and could be put against the higher-end large-sized models from the domestic Big Three automakers. Still, the Ambassador was more of a midsized car.

== First generation (1958–1959) ==
=== 1958 ===

American Motors planned to produce a stretched a wheelbase version of the Rambler platform for Nash dealers to be the new Nash Ambassador and another for Hudson dealers. Shortly before committing to production of the new long-wheelbase versions of the Hudson and the Nash, CEO Romney dropped the Nash and Hudson marques.

Although the Nash and Hudson names were canceled, work on the car itself continued, and American Motors introduced debuted in the fall of 1957, the 1958 &quot;Ambassador V-8 by Rambler&quot; on a wheelbase. Its features included the new AMC V8 engine (equipped with a 4-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts and rated at and of torque) mated to a BorgWarner supplied 3-speed automatic transmission with push-button gear selection.

In 1956, AMC first produced its own V8, a modern overhead valve V8 displacing , with a 3.25-inch stroke, forged steel crankshaft, which when equipped with a 4-barrel carburetor, was rated at . In 1957, AMC bored the 3-1/2-inch 250 CID V8 to 4 inches and displacement, which, when offered in the Rambler Rebel used solid lifters and Bendix electronic fuel injection, was rated at .

In 1958, the Ambassador was equipped with a hydraulic lifter version of AMC&#x27;s 327 CID V8 rated at . Although AMC&#x27;s 327 CID V8 shares its displacement with the Chevrolet small-block, AMC&#x27;s 327 came out six years before Chevrolet first offered its 327 engine in 1962.

The Ambassador was available in a body style exclusive to its line, a pillarless hardtop Cross Country station wagon. The 1958 Ambassador was offered in a single high-level trim level and came equipped with such luxury items as an electric clock, twin front and rear ashtrays, Nash&#x27;s traditional &quot;deep coil&quot; spring suspension front and rear, split-back reclining front seats that fold down into a bed, as well as upscale fabrics for the interior.

Management had found that the public associated the Rambler name with small economy cars and did not want the upscale nature of the new Ambassador to be so closely associated with Rambler&#x27;s favorable, but economical image. Therefore, a decision was made that the larger Ambassador would be marketed as the Ambassador V-8 by Rambler to identify it with the Rambler name&#x27;s burgeoning success, but to indicate an air of exclusivity by showing it to be a different kind of vehicle. However, the car wore &quot;Rambler Ambassador&quot; badges on its front fenders.

The 1958 Ambassador is a substantially longer car than the wheelbase Rambler Six and Rebel V8. However, both lines shared the same basic body, styling, and visual cues. However, all of the Ambassador&#x27;s extra of wheelbase (and, therefore, overall length) were added ahead of the cowl, meaning that the passenger compartment had the same volume as the smaller Ramblers. The Ambassadors came with plusher interior and exterior trims while the front end incorporated the Rebel &quot;V-Line&quot; grille from the prototype Hudson model. Through effective market segmentation, the Ambassador was positioned to compete with the larger models offered by other automakers.

Model identification was located on the car&#x27;s front fenders and deck lid. Super trim level Ambassadors featured painted side trim in a color that complimented the body color; Custom models featured a silver anodized aluminum panel on sedans and vinyl woodgrain decals on station wagons. Ambassador body styles included a four-door sedan and a hardtop sedan, a four-door pillared station wagon, and the hardtop station wagon. This body style first saw duty as an industry first in the 1956 Nash and Hudson Rambler line, on which all the 1958 Ramblers were based.

The Ambassador had an excellent power-to-weight ratio for its time and provided spirited performance with 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) times of less than 10 seconds with low 17-second times through a quarter-mile (402 m) dragstrip. It could be equipped with a limited slip differential, as well as power brakes, power steering, power windows, and air conditioning. Numerous safety features (such as deep-dished steering wheels and padded dashboards) came standard, while lap seat belts were optional.

=== 1959 ===
For 1959, the Ambassador received a revised grille, side trim, and redesigned rear door skins that swept into the tailfins instead of terminating at the C-pillar. Scotchlite reflectors were also added to the rear of the tailfins to increase visibility at night. Front and rear bumpers were over 20% thicker and featured recessed center sections to protect license plates. Adjustable headrests for the front seats were a new option, an industry first. AMC touted the added comfort the headrests provided, as well as their potential for reducing whiplash injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. Other changes included the activation of the starter through the neutral pushbutton (on automatic transmission-equipped cars) and the addition of an optional &quot;Powr-Saver&quot; engine fan, which featured a fluid-filled clutch for quieter high-speed operation.

The 1959 model year also saw the addition of an optional &quot;Air-Coil Ride&quot; air suspension system, utilizing airbags installed within the rear coil springs. An engine-driven compressor, reservoir, and ride-height control valve comprised the rest of the system. Still, as other automakers discovered, the troublesome nature of air suspension outweighed its benefits. The option proved unpopular and was discontinued at the end of the model year.

Ambassador sales improved considerably over 1958, reaching an output of 23,769; nearly half of which were Custom four-door sedans. Less popular was the hardtop station wagon, of which 578 were built.

== Second generation (1960–1961) ==
=== 1960 ===

The decision to discontinue the Nash and Hudson brands resulted in developing the second-generation Rambler Ambassador design. It was the only American midsize, luxury high-performance car offered in 1960. The &quot;Ambassador by Rambler&quot; was marketed by AMC as America&#x27;s Compact Luxury Car.

The 1960 model year lineup was reskinned, using new fenders, hood, deck lid, door skins, roofline, grille, taillights, bumpers, windshield, and backlight. The lower hood line, lower windshield cowl, simplified side trims, and egg-crate grille with stand-up letters spelling AMBASSADOR were significant. At the same time, the tailfins were reduced in height and were canted to either side, making for an integrated appearance, and the AMBASSADOR name was repeated across the rear trunk lid. The overall effect was relatively fresh, as the new roof had a lower, lighter look to complement the lower fins and grille. The design changes and the new grille provided &quot;a more expensive look&quot;.

The 1960 Ambassador was available only with four doors in sedan and station wagon body types. The station wagons had two rows of seats for six adult passengers or an additional rear-facing third row for an eight-passenger version. Additionally, a pillarless sedan (hardtop) and station wagon were available in the top-of-the-line &quot;Custom&quot; trim version. Three trim levels started with a &quot;Deluxe&quot; sedan reserved for fleet customers. The &quot;Super&quot; was the entry-level consumer version and available only as a pillared sedan and pillared six- or eight-passenger station wagon body styles. The top &quot;Custom&quot; trim models in both pillared or hardtop versions included fender ornaments, a clock, full wheel covers as well as additional padding for the rear seat, dash, and sun visors. To enhance the visual length of the cars, a full-length bodyside molding was painted in a contrasting color on the Super trim models or enclosed a brushed aluminum panel on the Ambassador Custom series.

Ambassadors now came with a unique compound curved windshield that cut into the roof. This improved visibility, did away with the &quot;knee knocker&quot; dogleg design of AMC&#x27;s first-generation wrap-around windshield, and resulted in an even stiffer unitized structure. The 1960 Ambassador had a low cowl, providing excellent visibility with the compound windshield. All 1960 Ambassadors came with a new instrument cluster under a padded cowl and illuminated controls for lights, wipers, fan, and defrost functions. Additional conveniences included a spotlight on the accelerator pedal and a net above the padded sun visors to hold lightweight items. The top-of-the-line Ambassador Custom models came standard with individual &quot;airliner&quot; reclining front seats that now had even more luxurious fabrics than in previous years.

All Ambassadors included the AMC&#x27;s V8, but for the first time, it was available in two versions. First was the original , of torque, performance version equipped with the 4-barrel carburetor and a 9.7:1 compression ratio, which required premium fuel, and a second economy version running on regular gasoline making , of torque, equipped with a two-barrel carburetor and an 8.7:1 compression ratio. The 1960 Ambassadors continued with an independent front suspension with upper and lower A-arms, an enclosed drive shaft (torque tube) with a live rear axle using 4-link trailing arms, and coil springs at all four wheels. However, the suspension was revised, resulting in better handling.

Equipped with the V8 and the BorgWarner pushbutton-operated three-speed planetary gear and torque converter automatic transmission, the Ambassadors reached in just over 9 seconds and passed the quarter-mile in 17 seconds. The Ambassadors featured soft springs and a solid build, making them ride silently and smoothly, according to reviewers.

The year set a new record for AMC, with total production reaching almost half a million cars and total revenue exceeding $1 billion. The Rambler Six and V8 along with the Rambler American represented almost 95% of AMC&#x27;s automobile sales. A total of 23,798 Ambassadors were built for the 1960 model year, with the Custom sedan being the most popular body and trim version (10,949 units). Only 302 Deluxe (fleet) sedans were delivered.

=== 1961 ===

The 1961 Ambassador continued the previous year&#x27;s primary unitized platform, but received an unusual new front-end styling that was overseen by AMC&#x27;s in-house design department headed by Edmund E. Anderson. The pillar-less four-door hardtop sedan and station wagon models were no longer available for 1961.

The Ambassador&#x27;s new design consisted of a trapezoid grille and headlights that floated in a body-colored panel. At the same time, the front fenders arched downward and forward of the leading edge of the hood. Unlike anything else on the market, AMC&#x27;s marketing department promoted the look as &quot;European&quot;. While the new look was meant to distinguish the Ambassador from the lower-priced Ramblers, it was neither a consumer success nor well-received in the automotive press. Moreover, overall automobile industry sales fell as the entire U.S. economy was experiencing the recession of 1960–1961.

Standard was the V8 with a synchromesh manual transmission. Optional was the &quot;power pack&quot; version with a dual exhaust system featuring new ceramic-coated mufflers guaranteed for the life of the car.

The 1961 Pure Oil Company Economy Trials, designed to parallel everyday driving experiences closely, saw the Ambassador capture 9 of the first ten places in the V8 engine category and win the top of its class.

== Third generation (1962) ==
=== 1962 ===
By the 1962 model year, the Ambassador&#x27;s platform was in its fifth season on the market. While Rambler sales had been good enough for third place in industry sales (behind Chevrolet and Ford), AMC&#x27;s management was working on a revolutionary and somewhat costly design set to debut for the 1963 model year. In the meantime, American Motors needed to save money. Since the Ambassador&#x27;s sales had fallen in 1961, it was decided that the car would be downsized for 1962 to directly share the body, windshield, and wheelbase with the Classic platform. Accordingly, the car was marketed as a Rambler Ambassador.
All Ambassadors included AMC&#x27;s V8 engine, while the Rambler Classic models were limited to I6 engines. The standard V8 was available either the regular fuel, two-barrel carburetor with 8.7:1 compression ratio, version or the premium gasoline, four-barrel version with 9.7:1 compression ratio producing . The wheelbase 1962 Ambassador was lighter than its wheelbase predecessors and was a spirited performer with the V8. This was like the 1957 Rambler Rebel, which was the quickest four-door sedan made in the United States that year, achieving acceleration in just over 7 seconds and making it faster than the Hemi Chrysler 300C, the DeSoto Adventurer, the Dodge D500, the Plymouth Fury, and the Chevrolet fuel-injected 283. The 1962 Ambassador was the same vehicle and should also reach 60 mph about as quickly as did the 1957 Rambler Rebel.

The 1962 Ambassador received a new front end similar to the 1961 and 1962 Classic&#x27;s, but with a crosshatch design, recessed center section, and Ambassador lettering. New, rectangular taillights were seen at the ends of restyled rear fenders, which lost their fins entirely. The exterior trim was reshuffled, and a new two-door pillared sedan debuted. A new &#x27;400&#x27; trim line was added at the top of the trim series, with Super and Custom models remaining. The Ambassador offered even more luxurious interiors to differentiate it from the Rambler Classic. The 400 models were available with vinyl upholstered front bucket seats and headrests along with color-coordinated shag carpets.

The 1962 Ambassador came with a dual chamber master brake cylinder and dual-circuit brake system, thus separating the front and rear brakes so that in the event of the failure of one component, some braking function would remain. This design was offered by only a few cars at that time. The 1962 models were equipped with &quot;Walker&quot; (brand) flow-through mufflers and a ceramic-coated exhaust system.

Dealer-installed options included rear fender skirts and a tow hitch.

In 1962, George Romney was elected as the new governor of Michigan, and in February, Roy Abernethy became CEO. A total of 36,171 Rambler Ambassadors were built for 1952, and AMC dropped from third to fourth place in total U.S. industry sales for the year.

== Fourth generation (1963–1964) ==
=== 1963 ===

In 1962, Romney resigned from AMC to run for Governor of Michigan, a position he won. The automaker&#x27;s new president, Roy Abernethy, who was responsible for the increasing sales under Romney, reacted to the mounting competition (in 1963, AMC built as many cars as they had in 1960, but overall total car sales had increased so much that it gave the automaker sixth place in domestic production; the same output in 1960 had put them third) in a logical way: &quot;Let&#x27;s get rid of this Romney image.&quot;

A completely redesigned larger Rambler lineup appeared. The new cars continued the philosophy of building smaller cars than its larger &quot;Big Three&quot; competitors. However, they also had a high degree of interchangeability in parts to keep tooling costs and production complexity to a minimum. The automaker, which pioneered &quot;styling continuity&quot;, introduced all-new styling for the 1963 model year Ambassadors and claimed that these were &quot;functional changes ... not change just for the sake of change&quot;. The Ambassadors featured a longer wheelbase, but were shorter due to reduced front and rear body overhangs, as well as a drop in overall height.

Designed by Dick Teague, the 1963 Ambassador&#x27;s shape was much tighter, cleaner, and smoother, with almost all of its parts interchangeable between it and the new Classic. All Ambassadors used unitized structure instead of the more rattle-prone, traditional body-on-frame construction, which was still the industry standard. In 1963, AMC&#x27;s new wheelbase cars (Ambassadors and Classics) used a revolutionary method of unit construction, which automobile manufacturers have almost universally adopted. AMC Ambassador and Classics used outer panels stamped from single sheet metal panels that included door frames and outer rocker panels. This resulted in an extremely rigid and rattle-free structure, better fit of doors into frames, production cost savings as well as reduced noise, vibration, and harshness. The &quot;uniside&quot; structure was superior to the conventional production methods in which multiple smaller pieces were welded together. There were 30% fewer parts and the result was greater structural rigidity, quieter car operation, and an overall weight reduction of about .

Curved side glass and push-button door handles were new and costly upgrades. Still, they contributed to the new Rambler&#x27;s handsome, elegant, and modern Mercedes-like bodyside styling by adding refinement to the car&#x27;s configuration and details. At the time, curved side glass was used exclusively in a few much more expensive luxury cars. The design attribute increased interior room and visibility, reduced wind noise, and enhanced the styling of the vehicles. The Ambassador also featured a squared-off Thunderbird-type roofline. The front end featured forward-thrusting upper and lower ends with a vertical bar &quot;electric shaver&quot; chrome grille insert. The Ambassador&#x27;s grille was differentiated from the Classic&#x27;s grille by including the Ambassador&#x27;s name in script within the small horizontal bar between the upper and lower grille sections. Round quad headlights were slightly recessed in chrome bezels mounted side by side within the grille at its outermost edges. Overall, the new Ambassadors were described by the staff of &quot;Automotive Fleet&quot; magazine as &quot;probably the finest looking cars ever produced by American Motors&quot;.

Ambassadors were again available in two-door sedan, four-door sedan, and four-door station wagon body styles, but new trim lines debuted for 1963. A &quot;Mercedes-like three-number model designation was developed&quot; with the 800 as the Ambassador&#x27;s base trim model (replacing the previous year&#x27;s Super model) for the police, taxi, and fleet market, a 880 model (in place of the Custom), and the up-level 990 trim (replacing the previous 400 models).

The 1963 Ambassadors were offered only with the V8, in either two-barrel or four-barrel versions. AMC&#x27;s smaller V8 engine was only offered in the Classic line. The automatic transmission was controlled by a steering column-mounted lever, replacing the previous pushbutton system. Maintenance was reduced with service intervals of the front wheel bearings increased from , the recommended engine oil change was at , and all Ambassador models included an alternator and an electronic voltage regulator as standard equipment.

Sales were brisk, and the redesign was billed a success, with &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Magazine bestowing Car of the Year status on the entire 1963 Rambler line, including the Ambassador. The marketing formula for the Ambassador generated record sales for the model, with buyers favoring more luxury and features, as evidenced by the Ambassador 990 models outselling the 880 versions by nearly 2-to-1, while the base 800 model was less popular and had a total of 43 two-door sedans built for the year. The automaker did not have the resources of GM, Ford, and Chrysler, nor the sales volume to spread out its new model tooling and advertising costs over large production volumes; however, Richard Teague &quot;turned these economical cars into smooth, streamlined beauties with tons of options and V-8 pep&quot;.

=== 1964 ===

The 1964 model year introduced minor trim changes and new options for the Ambassador line as AMC emphasized the transformed Rambler American compact-sized models. The &quot;electric-shaver&quot; grille on the 1963 model was replaced with a flush-mounted design, and the engine and transmission options were widened. A two-door hardtop body style called 990-H was added for the first time since 1957. The base 880 models were dropped from the line.

The 1964 Ambassadors featured the two-barrel V8 as standard, with the four-barrel version as optional. The automaker did not offer a four-speed manual transmission to compete with Ford or GM&#x27;s sporty mid-size V8 offerings. Instead, AMC offered its innovative &quot;Twin-Stick&quot; manual transmission. The &quot;Twin-stick&quot; option consisted of a three-speed manual transmission, operated by one of the two console-mounted &quot;sticks&quot; in conjunction with an overdrive unit that was controlled by the second &quot;stick&quot; in both 2nd and 3rd gears. This gave the driver the option of using five forward gears.

The 990-H was the most luxurious two-door model and included the high-compression V8 as well as a specially trimmed interior featuring 2+2-style bucket seats, center armrests front and rear, as well as a console with the Twin-Stick manual or available automatic transmission. Approximately 2,955 units were built.

=== Rambler Marquesa ===
The Rambler Marquesa, a concept car based on the Ambassador 990-H two-door hardtop, was designed to gauge public reaction to potential styling and feature enhancements. American Motors displayed it at various auto shows during the 1964 model year. Information about its existence faded following its exhibition. However, the show car remained in its original condition and is now on display at the Rambler Ranch in Elizabeth, Colorado, the most comprehensive collection of Nash, Rambler, and AMC vehicles and their history. 

The show car is finished in a unique, two-tone paint scheme, featuring a darker, contrasting color on the roof, a popular styling trend of the mid-1960s. The exterior also features simulated wire wheel covers with a spinner and a design to show the painted steel road wheel matching the roof finish. The car also has the original B.F. Goodrich premium &quot;Life-Saver 880&quot; bias-ply tires featuring dual white side wall stripes and a built-in puncture sealant. The interior features brocade fabric upholstered bucket seats with vinyl bolsters. The luxurious textile extends to the headliner and the unique door panel trim, creating a cohesive and opulent ambiance that was the hallmark of higher-end luxury cars. The center console houses the automatic transmission shifter and centrally-located power window switches.

== Fifth generation (1965–1966) ==
=== 1965 ===


No matter how much success the new Ramblers achieved in the marketplace, Roy Abernethy was not completely satisfied. Using the experience he gained as an outstanding salesman as a guide, Abernethy closely looked at the direction that American Motors&#x27; competition was going and decided that the company would be much more successful if its products competed more directly with the Big Three. He would achieve this by pushing all AMC vehicles further upmarket among the various market segments, shaking off the company&#x27;s economy car image, and offering vehicles once again in all three major American car size classes: compact, intermediate, and full-size. The American and Classic were strong competitors in the former two segments, so for the 1965 model year, he set his sights on turning the Ambassador into a proper full-size car by stretching the Classic&#x27;s wheelbase and giving it different styling. The general sizes of automobiles at that time were set by the industry&#x27;s wheelbase length standards, rather than the modern vehicle classification by interior and cargo space. The 1965 Ambassador represented a fundamental shift in corporate ideology, a shift away from primarily fuel-efficient vehicles, to bigger, faster, and potentially more profitable cars.

Although the Ambassador rode the same platform as its 1963 and 1964 forebears, the 1965 models looked all-new. American Motors&#x27; designer Dick Teague styled the 1965 Ambassador with panache and gave the car an overall integrated look. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine agreed, calling it a &quot;strikingly handsome automobile&quot;. The overall linear design look could be described as &quot;chunky&quot; or &quot;chiseled&quot;.

All Ambassadors were built on a wheelbase, or longer than the Classic models. Teague extended the beltline level from the stacked quad headlights to the vertical taillamps to stretch the cars visually. The Ambassador featured longer, squared-off rear fenders with vertical wrap-around taillights, taller trunk lid, squared-off rear bumper-mounted low, and squarer rear wheel arches. At the front, the Ambassador again sparked minor controversy with its new vertically stacked quad headlights, slightly recessed in their bezels, as they flanked an all-new horizontal bar grille. This new wall-to-wall grille projected horizontally in the center to create an effect somewhat opposite to the 1963&#x27;s grille treatment.

The front-end design provided a bold, rugged appearance. According to automotive journalists. the new Ambassadors were as attractive as anything built by AMC&#x27;s Detroit-based competitors, and with a list price of around $3,000, few could quibble about the cost of ownership.

As was the case before 1962, the Ambassador&#x27;s entire extra wheelbase was ahead of the cowl, meaning that interior volume was the same as the intermediate-sized Classic. Another new body style debuted in the Ambassador lineup for 1965: an attractive new convertible offered as part of the 990 series. This was the first time a convertible was offered in the Ambassador line since 1948.

Ambassador body styles (except station wagons with three rows of seats and the 990-H hardtop) offered seating for six passengers, with coupes and convertibles having the option of bucket seats with a center console and floor shifter. The Ambassador 990-H was a premium two-door hardtop model, available only in five-passenger form with the standard front bucket seats featuring fold-down center armrests and a retracting rear seat center armrest.

Ambassadors also saw an expanded list of trim lines, convenience options, and engine choices. Interiors were redesigned and featured a new dashboard. The 990 and 990-H models were continued, while the 880 models were the new economy leaders in the 1965 Ambassador line. Still, even the $2,512 price for the two-door sedan was not attractive compared to the models with better trim, bucket seats, and unique interiors. Ambassadors came standard with AMC&#x27;s new Inline-6 engine, which was the first time since 1956 that an Ambassador was available with six cylinders. Far more popular in the Ambassador, however, were the two time-tested AMC V8 engines.

American Motors&#x27; management decided that the Ambassador could once again be available with a standard six-cylinder engine because its full-size competitors (e. g. Bel Air and Impala, Ford Custom 500 and Galaxie, as well as Plymouth Fury) came with six-cylinder engines as standard equipment. They, therefore, appealed to a broader range of customers than the Ambassador was getting. Also, since the Classic was now smaller and styled differently, the Ambassador six-cylinder would not cannibalize Classic six sales, which were the company&#x27;s sales volume leaders. The changes were on target as sales of the repositioned Ambassador more than tripled.

The standard six-cylinder engine now featured larger valves making them the same as on the V8s. The front seatbacks were redesigned to offer additional legroom for rear-seat passengers with the popular reclining front seat backs now having seven positions, compared to the previous five. Front Bendix disc brakes with power assist were now optional.

&quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; classified the Ambassadors as family cars describing the prototypes as solid, comfortable, and running &quot;majestically&quot;. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine tested an Ambassador convertible with a Twin-Stick overdrive transmission and found it commendably economical, averaging over run, and noting that ... &quot;Traveling comfort was the Ambassador&#x27;s biggest selling point, along with its exceptionally powerful Bendix duo-servo drum brakes ...With the thin bucket seats that recline, driver and passengers can enjoy a high degree of riding comfort... Many passers-by commented on the car&#x27;s good looks... Our summary: a nice, comfortable, quiet, well built family automobile that rather neglects the performance market.&quot;

Tom Magliozzi, one of the brothers hosting the &quot;Car Talk&quot; radio talk show, owned a black 1965 AMC Ambassador convertible that he called my &quot;sleek black beauty&quot; and wanted another one when asked &quot;if you could have any car, new or old, what it would be?

=== Rambler Attaché ===
American Motors campaigned the Rambler Attaché, a specially prepared Ambassador convertible, for the auto show circuit. It was finished in deep-indigo pearlescent paint with red body side pinstripes, and the car was upgraded to real chrome wire wheels. The hood ornament featured a &quot;crown-like Ambassador crest&quot; while the interior&#x27;s bucket seats were upholstered in indigo leather with ruby-red inserts.
=== 1966 ===

Only minor changes were introduced for the 1966 Ambassador range. The V-shaped horizontal louver spanned unbroken between the headlamps, and the effect was continued with twin rectangular trim pieces attached to the side of the front fenders at their leading edges by the headlamps. The styling effect was repeated in the new vertical wraparound taillamps, with the top-line models receiving a twin set of horizontal ribbed moldings across the back of the trunk lid that simulated the look of the front grille. Hardtop coupes received a redesigned roofline that was angular in appearance with angle-cut rear side windows and a rectangular rear window. The backlight no longer curved and wrapped slightly around the C-pillars. The changes made for a more &quot;formal&quot; notchback look that was popular at the time.

Station wagons also received a new roof (that did not have as pronounced dip over the rear cargo area) as well as a redesigned tailgate and optional simulated woodgrain exterior side panels. Available with two rows of seats with a standard bottom-hinged tailgate with electric, fully retracting rear window or an optional rear-facing third-row that featured a left side-hinged rear door, with a regular exterior door handle on the right side. All station wagons carried a Cross Country badge.

The 880 served as the base model line. The two-door sedan was the price leader at $2,404 but finished with the fewest sales for the model year. The more popular and higher trimmed 990 models were available in sedan, wagon, hardtop, and convertible versions. Options included a vinyl roof, wire wheel covers, AM/FM radio, adjustable steering wheel, and cruise control. A new luxury DPL sub-model (short for &quot;Diplomat&quot;) two-door hardtop debuted at the top of the range.

The DPL included unique lower body side trim and numerous standard convenience items such as reclining bucket seats upholstered in brocade fabrics or optional vinyl. An optional interior trim featured houndstooth fabric and included two throw pillows. The DPL model was aimed to compete with the new, more upscale trimmed Plymouth VIP, Ford LTD, Chevrolet Caprice and Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.

The I6, as well as the V8s remained in the line, but transmission selections now included a new console-mounted four-speed manual. Most Ambassadors continued to be ordered with automatic transmissions.

&quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine tested a 1966 DPL equipped with a 327 engine that &quot;definitely has snap we hadn&#x27;t felt before&quot; and, even with an automatic transmission, experienced &quot;healthy wheelspin from both rear wheels [because of the Twin-Grip limited-slip differential]... Subtle changes in this year&#x27;s suspension, which include longer shocks and different springs, have a pronounced effect on the way the car feels and handles. Most welcome is the improved steering response. The car has a new feet-on-the-ground feeling, and body lean seems to have been reduced. The ride remains very good... As before, the interior is the outstanding feature of the Ambassador. Its quality is such that other luxury cars, even higher priced ones, could well imitate it...&quot;

Perhaps the biggest change, however, was that the Ambassador lost its historic Rambler nameplate, as the car was now marketed as the &quot;American Motors Ambassador&quot; or &quot;AMC Ambassador&quot;. Abernethy was again responsible for this marketing move, as he attempted to move the stylish new Ambassador even further upmarket. To him, that meant that the Rambler name and its economy car image would be eschewed to give the car a clean slate in a market that was turning away from a focus on economy and toward V8 performance. The evidence suggests that Abernethy was on the right track with moving the Ambassador upscale to compete with other manufacturers&#x27; luxury models as sales of the AMC&#x27;s flagship jumped from 18,647 in 1964 to over 64,000 in 1965, and then in 1966, they went to more than 71,000. Although the Ambassador accounted for a mere fraction of total passenger car sales in the U.S., it was an important step in bringing AMC&#x27;s products in line with what the consumer of the day wanted.

== Sixth generation (1967–1968) ==
=== 1967 ===
American Motors introduced a completely restyled longer, lower, and wider Ambassador for the 1967 model year, now riding on a wheelbase, or longer than before. The Ambassador&#x27;s platform was longer than the new Rambler Rebel&#x27;s wheelbase. The Ambassador was positioned in the standard-size category, against traditional big cars such as Ford Galaxie, Chevrolet Impala, and Plymouth Fury. The convertible was offered again—this time in DPL trim—for 1967; but this would be the final year with 1,260 built. It featured an all-new &quot;split stack&quot; folding mechanism with concealed side rails that did not intrude into the backseat area, thus offering room for three adult passengers in the rear.

The car once again looked completely new, with a more rounded appearance that sported sweeping rooflines, &quot;coke-bottle&quot; fenders, greater glass area, and a recessed grille that bowed forward less than that of the 1965–66 models. Taillights were wider, rectangular, and divided by one central vertical bar. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine described the all-new styling of the new Ambassador as &quot;attractive&quot; and &quot;more graceful and easier on the eye in &#x27;67&quot;.

The 880 two-door sedans featured the identical roofline as the hardtops, but had slim B-pillars that gave them a more open-air coupe appearance and were marketed as &quot;Sports Sedans&quot;. The 880 trim was also available in four-door sedan and station wagon versions, but more popular were the better equipped and more upscale 990 models came in four-door sedan, station wagon, and two-door hardtop body styles. Adding more elegance to DPL two-door hardtops and convertibles was the optional &quot;Satin-Chrome&quot; finish (paint code P-42) for the lower body side replacing the standard full-length stainless steel rocker moldings. A black or white vinyl cover was optional on 990 and DPL sedans and hardtops. The 990 Cross Country station wagons were available with 3M&#x27;s &quot;Di-noc&quot; simulated wood-grain body side panels trimmed in a slim stainless steel frame.

The full-sized Ambassador featured a lengthy list of standard features and options. The interiors &quot;rival more expensive cars for luxury and quality, yet are durable enough to take years of normal wear&quot;. The premium materials and fittings included wood-grain trim and even an optional &quot;Custom&quot; package with unique upholstery and two matching pillows. Ambassador DPL hardtops included reclining bucket seats with a center armrest between them (with a center cushion for a third occupant or a floor console with gear selector), as well as a foldaway center armrest for the rear seat. The new safety-oriented instrument panel grouped all gauges and controls in front of the driver, with the rest of the dashboard pushed forward and away from the passengers. Focusing on safety, there were now no protruding knobs, the steering column was designed to collapse under impact, and the steering wheel was smaller than previous Ambassadors.

The long-lived &quot;GEN-1&quot; family of AMC V8 engines was replaced by an all-new line of engines that debuted for 1966 in the Rambler American. These V8s were an all-new design featuring a thin-wall-casting block, heads, and manifold. With a four-barrel carburetor and dual exhaust, the 343 V8 produced at 4800 rpm and of A new four-link trailing-arm rear suspension system eliminated the old torque tube design, providing a more comfortable coil spring ride.

American Motors promoted the new 1967 Ambassador as an &quot;uncompromising automobile with the red carpet ride&quot; in print advertisements, as well as in an innovative TV commercial. Unfortunately, sales of the redesigned models were disappointing due to customer confusion caused by the entire company&#x27;s abrupt upmarket push, which seemed uncomfortably &quot;me too&quot; to the traditional domestic Big Three&#x27;s customers. They also alienated American Motors&#x27; loyal buyer base. Abernethy&#x27;s ideas of entering new markets were not working. These strategy changes resulted in a new round of financial problems for American Motors. Because of this, Abernathy was released from AMC by its board of directors later that year and was replaced by William V. Luneberg and Roy D. Chapin Jr.

===USPS sedans===

American Motors provided specialized fleet options for commercial and municipal customers. Taxi and police versions were heavily used and not available to the general public. A purchase order was made by the General Services Administration (GSA) of 3,745 Ambassador base 880 four-door sedans for use by the United States Postal Service (USPS), most to be built in factory right-hand-drive. There were six vehicles for review for this purchase and tested was a left-hand drive AMC Ambassador 880 sedan with its back seat removed.

Not all of the units ordered for the postal service had right-hand drive. Specifications included factory heavy-duty fleet options such as rubber floor mats, upholstery, and the deletion of the rear seat. Most came with the base I6 engine along with column-shift automatic transmission and &quot;Twin-Grip&quot; (limited-slip differential). All came with an identification metal plate on the dash near the ashtray.

American Motors took advantage of this large fleet order to market the 1967 Ambassadors. Print advertisements in popular magazines headlined &quot;We Deliver&quot; with a picture of the USPS vehicles while other ads described that Ambassadors would provide safety, reliability, and a &quot;red-carpet&quot; ride.

The engineering to make the cars right-hand-drive served as the template for other American Motors vehicles based on the Ambassador platform destined for foreign right-hand-drive markets such as Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The Rambler Rebel and its replacement AMC Matador were, after that, built using the same RHD dash, steering, and instrumentation as the 1967 USPS Ambassador sedans for both built-up export to the United Kingdom and for the knock-down kits supplied for local assembly in Australia and New Zealand. The Matador was built in Australia until 1976 in this way.

=== AMC Marlin ===
The fastback Marlin two-door hardtop that was previously built on the Rambler Classic platform in 1965 and 1966, was continued for 1967, but was now based on the larger Ambassador platform. It featured the Ambassador&#x27;s front end, longer hood, and luxury appointments with an even longer fastback roofline than the previous version.

=== 1968 ===

For the 1968 model year, a new SST trim line was placed above the now mid-line DPL trim for the Ambassador. American Motors was a pioneer in the field of air conditioning through its Kelvinator refrigerator division. AMC&#x27;s marketing chief Bill McNealy wanted to make the Ambassador stand out in a crowded market segment and decided to add more significant distinction to the Ambassador line by making the All Weather A/C system as standard equipment. This was the first time any volume car manufacturer had done so, something that even Cadillac and Lincoln had not offered on their luxury cars – although some of them were priced at more than twice as much as Ambassador. While all Ambassadors came with air conditioning as standard, consumers could order the car without air as a &quot;delete option&quot; and decrease the price by $218. As AMC pointed out in their advertising campaign for the Ambassador, the only other major automaker that offered air conditioning as standard equipment on its cars in 1968 was Rolls-Royce. Air conditioning was standard only on Cadillac limousines.

Because of slow sales during the 1967 model year, both the convertible and the pillared coupe models were dropped from the line for 1968, leaving the 990 hardtop coupe and sedan, the DPL hardtop coupe, sedan, and wagon, and the new SST hardtop coupe and sedan in the Ambassador line. The personal luxury fastback Marlin was also discontinued to make way for the smaller new AMC Javelin in the pony car segment. The top-of-the-line 1968 Ambassador SST version was &quot;especially appealing&quot; and &quot;a very luxurious package&quot; with standard V8 power, air conditioning, expensive upholstery, individual reclining front seats, wood-look interior trim, upgraded exterior trim, as well as numerous conveniences such as an electric clock and a headlights-on buzzer.

Styling changes were minor. Taillights were now recessed in body-color bezels divided by a single central horizontal bar. Front headlight bezels were now made of nylon and similarly body-colored. A new injection-molded ABS plastic grille was dominated by a horizontal bar that extended forward in the center from the sides, while its outline had squared off edges that wrapped ahead into the inner headlight extensions. Fender-mounted marker lights were added at the front and rear as standard equipment, as the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regulations mandated their application (along with seat belts beginning January 1, 1968) to all passenger cars sold in the United States for 1968.

However, AMC&#x27;s most enduring styling feature debuted on the Ambassador for 1968, as flush-mounted paddle-style door handles replaced the former push-button units on all American Motors cars, save the Rambler American. The practical and &quot;disarmingly simple design&quot; predated safety-related mandates and industry norms. The interior locking was no longer by the traditional windowsill pushbutton, but a lever set into the armrest.

Front-wheel alignment was made more accessible and with greater accuracy by moving the camber adjustment from the upper to the lower control arm on the double wishbone suspension, and the caster angle adjustments also moved from the upper control arm to the drag strut. At midyear, AMC&#x27;s new top engine, the AMX V8 became an option in the Ambassador line, bringing the total engine options up to four.

In June 1967, American Motors started a new advertising campaign created by Mary Wells Lawrence of the Wells, Rich, and Greene marketing agency. The US$12 million AMC account was high-profile assignment and helped established the agency as innovative and daring in its approach. The new advertising violated the convention of not attacking the competition, and AMC&#x27;s campaigns became highly controversial. The publicity worked with AMC&#x27;s total retail sales improving 13% for the fiscal year, but 1968 Ambassador numbers were slightly down.

== Seventh generation (1969–1973) ==
=== 1969 ===

In 1969, the Ambassador received a major restyling, with a gain in overall length and wheelbase. The wheelbase was accompanied by an increase in front and rear track from . The front end appearance was revised with new quad headlight clusters mounted horizontally in a new molded plastic grille. The grille was blacked out, with a chrome horizontal bar connecting the headlight clusters. The hood was redesigned to accommodate the grille&#x27;s raised center portion, and it faintly recalled Packard&#x27;s classic grille/hood combination. Dick Teague, AMC&#x27;s Vice President of Styling, had worked at the luxury car manufacturer before joining AMC. Parking lights were rectangular and mounted horizontally in recessed wells in the front bumper, just beneath each set of headlights. The entire front fascia leaned forward slightly to lend an air of forward motion to the car&#x27;s appearance.

At the rear, ribbed rectangular taillights were mounted inboard the Ambassador&#x27;s rearward-thrusting rear fenders. Square ribbed marker lights of similar height were mounted at the trailing edge of each fender side. The deck lid had a slightly higher lift-over for cargo access. The base and DPL models had no bright trim panel between the taillights, while the top-line SST versions featured a panel with a red finish to match the taillights. Station wagons saw vertical wraparound taillights replacing the previous &quot;hooded&quot; units, which were not visible from the side. The 1969 AMC Ambassador was a smooth, powerful, well-proportioned sedan that did not look like anything else on the road.

The interiors were upgraded, and a new deeply hooded dashboard clustered instruments and controls in front of the driver. There was an increased emphasis on luxury-type trim and features by buyers. The base model two-door hardtop Ambassador was no longer offered for the 1969 model year.

The 1969 Ambassador stressed luxury, with the marketing tagline developed by Mary Wells Lawrence at the Wells Rich Greene agency, tying the car&#x27;s value, &quot;It will remind you of the days when money really bought something.&quot; The combination of rich velour upholstery, individually adjustable reclining seats, standard air conditioning, and the longer wheelbase were highlighted in advertisements with Ambassador&#x27;s posh&quot;limousine&quot; ride at an economical price. One aspect of this new advertising theme included many AMC dealers inviting prospective customers to call and request a &quot;demonstration ride&quot;, in which a uniformed chauffeur would arrive at the prospect&#x27;s home and drive them around in an Ambassador SST sedan. AMC&#x27;s efforts worked, and Ambassador sales increased again.

=== Royale Stretch Limo ===
Not only did AMC promote the 1969 Ambassador as having a &quot;limousine&quot; ride and deluxe appointments, but Chicago auto leasing executive, Robert Estes, had the Armbruster/Stageway Company convert Ambassadors into real limousines riding on a wheelbase. Known as the Royale Stretch Limo, one was owned by the State of Wisconsin as the official vehicle for Governor Warren Knowles. The conversions were unusual because they did not keep the stock rear doors—as is typical in most limos. The back doors were welded shut, and the Ambassadors were lengthened by inserting a section just behind the original B-pillar that had an entirely new central door in this center, making a large opening for entry and egress. steel &quot;I-beams&quot; bridge the expanse created by the stretch. Power comes from the &quot;AMX&quot; V8 engine backed with the BorgWarner automatic transmission and a &quot;Twin-Grip&quot; limited-slip differential with 3.15 gears.

=== 1970 ===


The most significant change by AMC for the 1970 model year was the launch of the new compact Hornet that not only replaced the Rambler American, but also became the platform for several types of vehicles through its discontinuation in 1988. However, all car lines received changes and updates for 1970.

The 1970 AMC Ambassadors were announced on 1 October 1969, featuring new rear end styling for the two-door hardtops and four-door sedans while the station wagons gained a new roof panel to accommodate a longer luggage rack, which was standard. The luxury-positioned Ambassador continued to offer air conditioning as standard equipment. Model designations continued with the &quot;SST&quot; and the &quot;DPL&quot; while the fleet-oriented &quot;Basic&quot; version was offered only as a four-door sedan. The &quot;basic&quot; model was not available for export markets.

The hardtop coupes and sedans featured a new design that was shared by the intermediate 1970 AMC Rebel. On hardtop coupes, this restyling consisted of a sloping roofline into the rear deck and broad C-pillars highlighted by upswept reverse-angle quarter windows. The beltline kicked up at the point where the hardtop&#x27;s rear windows swept upward and tapered back to the fender end, meeting a new loop-type rear bumper with integrated rear lamps.

On sedans, the roofline featured slimmer C-pillars and squared-off rear door windows, meting a beltline that kicked up beneath the trailing edge of each rear door window. The beltline tapered back to the same rear fascia as on the two-door hardtops. The rear bumper on the hardtops and sedans contained a new ribbed taillight lens that stretched wall-to-wall and included twin square white reverse light lenses in its center. 

The station wagon&#x27;s rear end was mostly unchanged from the 1969 versions. It included the dual-swing tailgate that could open down to extend even with the load bed or open like a door on its hinges on the left side, facilitating egress for the optional rear-facing third-row seat for two passengers. A power lift tailgate window was included with the three-row station wagons.

All Ambassadors received a new extruded aluminum grille at the front, featuring several widely spaced slim bright horizontal bars with one larger, body-colored filled horizontal bar extending to each headlight cluster. The Ambassador was available in fourteen exterior colors, 31 two-tone combinations (including the bodyside and tailgate on DPL station wagons, while SST included wood-grained vinyl exterior trim), and a vinyl roof cover in black, white, or blue was optional for DPL and SST hardtops and sedans. Interior choices included seats with coil springs and upscale brocade upholstery or available channeled velour in SST sedans. Standard on the Basic and DPL models was a non-reclining full-width front bench seat for three passengers. The SST included 50-50 individual reclining front seats. The two-door hardtop SST was available with high-back bucket seats in fabric or vinyl. They came with an armrest and a center cushion with the standard column-shifted automatic or optional center console-mounted shifter. 

The V8 was replaced for 1970 by a new V8 engine. This at 4400 rpm and of torque at 2800 rpm was the standard engine on all DPL and SST models. The V8 was also supplanted by a engine in either two-barrel, regular gasoline, or high-output, four-barrel, premium fuel versions. The four-barrel &quot;AMX&quot; V8 engine was optional, producing at 3200 rpm and of torque at 3200 rpm. Only the base model positioned as a fleet vehicle had a I6 engine as standard. The three-speed automatic transmission was standard on Ambassador DPL and SST models.

New for the 1970 model year were two stripe whitewalls. The images of the Ambassador in AMC&#x27;s 1970 marketing materials featured the new design replacing the previous single whitewall option. However, the dual white stripe tire popularity did not last long. Factory audio options included vertically instrument panel-mounted AM or AM/FM radios, as well as an additional eight-track stereo tape player for sedans and hardtops.
Marketing for the 1970 AMC Ambassador focused on it being a rich-looking car that was highly affordable. The promotion noted the Ambassador is AMC&#x27;s finest car, like the Cadillac at General Motors, Lincoln Continental is Ford&#x27;s, and Imperial is Chrysler&#x27;s, but &quot;about the size of their Impalas, Galaxies, and Furys&quot; that were considered ordinary models at the time. The Ambassador, built on a wheelbase was compared to the final generation of Lincoln&#x27;s Town Car wheelbase as sharing dimensions. The Ambassador, &quot;though exceptionally well appointed, was comparatively inexpensive, A &#x27;70 SST, for example, ... $3,739 [two-door hardtop] - far less than an equivalent car from GM, Ford, or Chrysler.&quot;

American Motors marketing agency used innovative techniques such as comparative and &quot;off-beat&quot; ads as well as the heavy use of TV spots to emphasize exciting cars and a youthful image. Not yet well known at the time, Robert De Niro was featured in television advertisements as an accountant who just finished college and purchased a luxurious car. Little Italy, Manhattan, is featured as the backdrop and there are caricatures of Italian Americans. The advertisement resembles the setting of &quot;The Godfather&quot;, but was made two years before that film and four years before De Niro joined that film series.

An estimated 58,900 AMC Ambassadors were produced for the 1970 model year with an average MSRP of $3,677.

=== 1971 ===


The 1971 Ambassadors received minor changes and improvements following the previous year&#x27;s redesign. The marketing tagline for the year was the underdog asking, &quot;If you had to compete with GM, Ford, and Chrysler, what would you do?&quot; — that was answered by AMC by including more features, advantages, and benefits for buyers of its cars compared to the models from its much larger competitors. This was reflected by shuffling the Ambassador models for 1971 and by including more equipment in the standard feature list. The previously nameless base models were dropped, as the sedan-only DPL trim line was relegated to base model status, and a new top-line Brougham trim line was added above mid-line SST models. Both the SST and Brougham versions came as two-door hardtops, four-door sedans, and station wagons.

The DPL came with AMC&#x27;s new Inline-6 with seven main bearings. All the SSTs and Broughams featured the V8 engine with as standard. BorgWarner&#x27;s &quot;Shift-Command&quot; automatic transmissions were standard equipment across the line. Two of AMC&#x27;s were optional; an 8.5:1 compression version with a two-barrel carburetor or a high-compression four-barrel V8 that required premium-fuel. The previous &quot;AMX 390&quot; V8 gave way to a new V8 as the top engine option.

Styling changes consisted of a new fascia for the front. It featured headlights in chrome pods separate from, but flanked the new grille with a bright rectangular surround with rounded edges. The &quot;natural&quot; cast pot metal grille insert was recessed and featured a bright vertical bar pattern. A second set of parking lights was added outboard of the headlight clusters, and they were integrated into the fender extension to eliminate the need for separate front marker lights.

Taillights on hardtop coupes and sedans still ran wall-to-wall, but the twin backup lights were moved from the center to further outboard—approximately eight inches in from either fender side. Once again, the wagon received a few changes at the rear, but a new design was featured for the optional woodgrain side trim, with this version filling the upper bodysides. Its lower edge flowed downward after its peak at the leading edge above each front wheelhouse, in a similar fashion as the Buick Skylark&#x27;s side &quot;sweep spear&quot; styling cue.

Ambassador base models were offered to fleet buyers with various police, taxicab, and other heavy-duty packages. Governments and police departments in the U.S. historically used standard-size, low-price line four-door sedans. Equipped with the or V8 engines. The base model Ambassadors saw use as police cruisers and support vehicles.

=== 1972 ===


Minor changes greeted 1972 Ambassadors, as AMC&#x27;s most significant news for the year was the addition of the innovative AMC Buyer Protection Plan, which included the industry&#x27;s first 12-month or bumper-to-bumper warranty. This was the first time an automaker promised to repair anything wrong with the car (except for tires) and owners were provided with a toll-free telephone number to the company, as well as a complimentary loaner car if a warranty repair took overnight. This backing also included mechanical upgrades to increase durability and quality, such as the standardization of electric windshield wipers on all model lines, replacing AMC&#x27;s vacuum-powered units, and better interior trims. By focusing on quality, the smallest domestic automaker was profitable in 1972, earning US$30.2 million (the highest net profit achieved by AMC since 1964) on $4 billion in sales.

The base Ambassador DPL model was canceled, with three body styles now available in SST and Brougham trim. Fleet purchasers could order plain Ambassadors in Police Pursuit Vehicle (PPV) or Special Service Package (SSP) versions. A six-cylinder engine was no longer available; thus, the Ambassador became an exclusively V8-engined car for the first time since 1964. This made the Ambassador the only volume-produced American car that included air conditioning, power brakes, automatic transmission, and a V8 engine as standard equipment; all while being priced less than the Big Three&#x27;s full-sized cars. The base engine was the with two or a versions optional. The engines were designed to operate on regular-grade, low-lead, or unleaded types of gasoline. All were based on the engine designs responsible for AMC winning the 1971–1972 Trans-Am Series. The BorgWarner transmission was replaced by the &quot;Torque-Command&quot; (TorqueFlite) three-speed automatic sourced from Chrysler.

Styling changes on the 1972 Ambassador were minimal and consisted of a new crosshatch cast metal grille with bright trim and new integrated fender extension mounted side marker lamps on the front. Brougham station wagons now included a roof rack, rear air deflector, as well as 3M &quot;Di-noc&quot; woodgrain trim on body sides and tailgate.

A &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; magazine survey after driving a total of found Ambassador owners were pleased with their cars, describing them to be &quot;very comfortable to drive and ride in&quot; with handling listed as a top &quot;specific like&quot; by half of the drivers. A very high percentage (92%) would buy one again. Although the Buyer Protection Plan was listed by only 8.5% as a reason to buy an Ambassador, owners valued the smaller AMC dealers that &quot;had more time to be courteous and to pay personal attention to customers&quot;.

=== 1973 ===

The SST models were dropped from the line, as all 1973 Ambassadors now came in one high-level &quot;Brougham&quot; trim. Ten popular items, including an AM radio, power disc brakes, tinted glass, and whitewall tires were added to the already extensive standard equipment list that included air conditioning, V8 engine, and automatic transmission. The Ambassador line &quot;maintains its reputation as one of the industry&#x27;s most completely equipped cars&quot;. Multiple improvements in quality were designed to reinforce the new &quot;Extended Buyer Protection Plan&quot; exclusive to AMC cars that provided complete maintenance coverage for two years or . The automaker&#x27;s marketing campaign shifted to stress quality in a &quot;we back them better because we build them better&quot; advertising with particular emphasis into the Hornet, Matador and Gremlin promotion, while the Ambassador received individual support with the tagline &quot;you get standard equipment, the luxuries you&#x27;d normally have to pay extra for.&quot; Model year production for AMC increased 25 percent, outperforming the industry average production increase by 75 percent, with only a slightly changed product in the showrooms.

In range rationalization to a single trim available in two-door hardtop, four-door sedan, and station wagon body versions, the styling changes for the 1973 Ambassadors were minimal. Heftier front and rear bumpers were included to comply with new U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regulations that required all passenger cars to withstand a front and a rear impacts without damage to the engine, lights, and safety equipment. Ambassadors complied with the regulation by incorporating a stronger front bumper equipped with self-restoring telescoping shock absorbers. Designed to &quot;give&quot; as much as , it jutted slightly forward from the front fascia and incorporated flexible trim matching the body paint. This bumper also featured a more prominent horizontal rubber guard at its upper portion near the grille, thus eliminating the need for a pair of vertical chrome bumper guards that were optional before. The grille gained heavier horizontal bars, and headlight bezels took on blackout trim in their recessed portions. The rear bumper gained vertical black rubber bumper guards, replacing a pair of similar and previously optional chrome bumper guards. The taillight panel on sedans and hardtops also got a blackout surround and now held four rectangular lenses each trimmed with a three-by-four grid overlay, the outer and inner lenses separated by the backup lamps and the two inner ones separated by the Ambassador eagle-and-shield emblem. Finally, the woodgrain paneling on station wagons was moved below the side moldings.

== Eighth generation (1974) ==
=== 1974 ===

Ambassador sales remained steady since 1970, despite the lack of major changes to the vehicle. The 1974 models were restyled and stretched to accommodate energy-absorbing bumpers in both front and rear. The redesign made them the longest AMC-built versions at just as the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo sparked nationwide gasoline rationing.

The 1974 Ambassador Brougham was no longer available as a two-door (pillar-less) hardtop, leaving only the four-door sedan and station wagon body styles. The hardtop&#x27;s cancellation was due in part to the low sales volume of the Ambassador two-door versions, as well as the introduction of the 1974 Matador coupe, which received the &quot;Car and Driver&quot; &quot;Best Styled Car of 1974&quot;, featuring a long hood and short rear deck design that avoided (at least on introduction) period hallmarks such as imitation landau bars and opera lights.

Styling changes for the Ambassador sedan and wagon included revised front fender caps as well as an all-new hood, grille, bumpers, rear fascia, instrument panel, interior trim, hood ornament, and a changing font for the Ambassador nameplate. The grille featured a new squared-off loop-type design surrounding the circular recessed quad headlights and featured a forward-protruding center. The insert held a crosshatch pattern dominated by two thick horizontal bars that connected the headlight bezels and contained new parking lights between them. These parking lights had amber lenses, followed the grille protrusion forward, and were overlaid by the grille&#x27;s crosshatch trim. Headlamp bezels were once again blacked out in their recessed areas. The new hood and front bumper followed the grille&#x27;s central protrusion forward, giving the car a slight &quot;coffin nose&quot; look. The revised Matador sedan saw a similar frontal treatment in 1974, but with a much more pronounced effect and different single headlamp clusters, hood, and grille inserts.

As with the new Matador sedan, the new rear bumper was much larger and backed by shock absorbers, as it was beefed up to comply with new National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulations for standardized front and rear bumpers on passenger cars that could sustain a impact with no damage. Sedan rear fenders received fiberglass caps that wrapped inward to create a recessed space that met a carryover decklid. The new rectangular taillight housings, which featured taller white backup lights mounted inboard of the new taillights, were mounted in this space. The license plate moved from the rear bumper to the area between the new taillight assemblies, and the whole taillight and license plate system on the sedans was surrounded by a loop of chrome trim. Both Ambassador and Matador sedans shared the same rear-end styling.
The cargo area and the rear design of station wagons remained similar to previous Ambassadors, save for a massive new bumper and revised taillamps. The wagon had standard two-row bench seats for six passengers or was available with an extra rear-facing third row for eight seat-belted passengers. All came with numerous practical, appearance, and comfort items as standard equipment. These included a two-way opening tailgate: (1) hinged at the bottom for convenient loading or hauling long cargo and (2) hinged at the side to open like a door for ease of entry and exit for passengers or cargo; wood-grained semi-transparent vinyl side and rear trim, a full-length roof rack; as well as a chrome and wood grain roof air deflector to help keep the tailgate window clean. However, ordering the station wagon without the 3M &quot;Di-noc&quot; exterior body trim was possible.

Powertrain selections remained the same as in 1973, with only V8 engines and automatic transmissions available. When ordered with a trailer package (special wiring harness with heavy-duty flasher and heavy-duty suspension with rear sway bar), the Ambassador was rated for up to towing capacity. Other increases for 1974 included a larger capacity fuel tank, , and an alternator producing 62 amperes. New sound insulation made the Ambassador even quieter. All came with a lengthy list of standard equipment that was typically optional on competing makes. These included comfort items such as air conditioning, an AM radio, and a vanity mirror, as well as appearance enhancements such as pin striping and whitewall tires.

Sales of all full-size vehicles, regardless of the automaker, fell significantly in 1974 as America&#x27;s focus shifted to smaller cars. By the end of the model year, the full-sized, low-priced market segment dropped 37%. Ambassador sales were no different. The demand for AMC Gremlins and Hornets was increasing since 1971, and the automaker was unable to keep up making the smaller models by 1974. The company was also getting ready to introduce the Pacer. To simplify its production and number of different models, in June 1974, the final AMC Ambassador rolled off the Kenosha, Wisconsin assembly line, ending a nameplate that had been in continuous production in some form for 48 years.

Production consisted of 17,901 sedans and 7,070 station wagons for a total of 24,971 Ambassadors during 1974.

==International assembly==

===Argentina===
Industrias Kaiser Argentina (IKA) produced the U.S. third, fourth, and fifth generation Ambassadors in Córdoba, Argentina from 1962 until 1972, and later became available by special order through 1975. Despite being replaced by AMC in 1967, IKA continued to use the old platform until the end of production in Argentina. As with all export markets, the cars were marketed as &quot;Rambler&quot; even after the name change in the United States.

Assembly of IKA Ramblers began in 1962, with the Argentinean cars being the 1961 U.S. versions, but equipped with Continental I6 engines producing at 4000 rpm, along with a steering column-mounted manual three-speed transmission. The Ambassador 440 was the top-trim IKA model available only as a four-door sedan.

The completely new generation models by AMC in the U.S. for the 1963 model year were also replicated by IKA. The Ambassador sedan came exclusively in 990 trim, and it revolutionized the Argentine automotive market by introducing innovations that included power steering, power windows, and factory-installed air conditioning.

The Ambassador line was redesigned for 1965 in the U.S., as well as for Argentina. All IKA Rambler models now featured the overhead camshaft (OHC) straight-six &quot;Tornado Interceptor&quot; engines producing at 4200 rpm. They were originally developed by Kaiser Motors in the U.S. for the 1963 Jeep Gladiator pickups and Wagoneer vehicles. The engine was now produced in Argentina, and it increased the domestic (locally sourced) content of IKA automobiles to lower taxes (tariffs).

The new IKA Ambassador 990 sedans were further upgraded to steering column-mounted ZF four-speed manual transmissions, front disc brakes, front reclining bucket seats with center cushion and armrest, as well as luxury features that included power windows and air conditioning. A road test by &quot;Revista Parabrisas&quot; magazine described the 1965 IKA Rambler Ambassador 990 as &quot;soft, opulent, and smooth ride at all speeds... something big, luxurious and complete... the highest expression of comfort tested so far by the magazine&quot;.

Stretch versions of the IKA Rambler Ambassador were used as official government limousines. The &quot;Presidential&quot; models featured a longer rear door and side window, as well as broader C-pillar with padded vinyl roof cover and a small rear window.
===Australia===
Australian Motor Industries (AMI) obtained the rights to assemble and distribute Ramblers in 1960, starting with the Rambler Ambassador. The 1961, 1962, and 1963 model year Ambassadors were built in Australia at AMI&#x27;s facilities at Port Melbourne, Victoria. The 1961 sedan, which was powered by a V8, was the most powerful car being assembled in Australia at that time. Knock-down kits featuring right-hand drive were shipped from Kenosha for assembly by AMI. The Australian-built Ambassadors included a significant percentage of &quot;local content&quot; to gain import tariff (tax) concessions by using parts and components (such as interiors and upholstery) that were sourced from Australian manufacturers. AMI&#x27;s first year of production resulted in 65 registrations for 1961. Registrations of the 1963 model continued into 1964, with a total of 21 Ambassadors registered for 1964.

Although not documented by AMI records, it is concluded that 20 right-hand drive 1970 Ambassadors were fully imported from Kenosha, apparently 16 two-door hardtops and 4 four-door sedans. One possible reason for this was that it may have been a holding action while AMI was preparing for the assembly of the new 1970 Rebel. All were fitted with AMC&#x27;s new V8 and automatic transmission with floor shift.

The dash and instrument pack of the 1967 Ambassador, which had been converted and used in the RHD Ambassadors assembled for the U.S. Postal Service, was standard in all assembly kits for the Rebel and Matador included in all factory-right-hand drive Rebels, Matadors, and Ambassadors exported to the United Kingdom.

===Costa Rica===
Rambler vehicles were marketed in Costa Rica since 1959 through Purdy Motor. New local content regulations enacted during the 1960s effectively required vehicles sold in those markets to be assembled from knock-down kits. An assembly plant for Rambler and Toyota vehicles was established, ECASA, and the first Ramblers were produced in Costa Rica by the end of 1965. The company built Ambassadors and other AMC models through 1970, with Toyota increasing ownership of ECASA.

===Mexico===
American Motors&#x27; first-generation Ambassadors were exported to Mexico in the first half of 1958 and assembled locally in the second half of the same year, and in 1959 by Planta Reo de México based in Monterrey, Nuevo León. The model was restricted to the four-door hardtop sedan. It was powered by the four-barrel V8 engine producing coupled to a three-speed automatic transmission. The model became the marque&#x27;s top-of-the-line product alongside the three versions of the midsize Rambler and compact Rambler American models.

However, low sales figures alongside a deteriorating relationship between AMC and Planta REO led to the cancellation of the contract in the second half of 1959.

American Motors again exported its products into Mexico with a new local partner, Willys Mexicana. The agreement was signed in March 1960, and production began in Mexico City.

This meant discontinuing the Ambassador line in Mexico as the new operation had several priorities above offering a top-end luxury full-size car line. Aside from marketing the already existing Jeep line, Willys Mexicana focused efforts on the compact Rambler American, which obtained a generation change the following year, meaning a complete retooling of the Vallejo plant. In 1962, legal and industrial requirements in the country became more assertive with the auto industry integration decree issued by the president Adolfo López Mateos in 1962. Among its mandates, it entirely banned the importation of automobile engines. Willys Mexicana began building its engine plant, which was achieved in November 1964. Once the Rambler American was consolidated in the Mexican market, Willys Mexicana opted to expand the product line by introducing the brand-new second-generation Rambler Classic midsize model as a larger luxury counterpart to the economy compact American. Also in 1963, due to problems with WM&#x27;s parent company (the SOMEX bank) as well as further requirements of the government auto industry decree, Willys Mexicana was reorganized into an entirely new company with expanded capital and direct investment from the Mexican government, Kaiser Willys, and American Motors. This resulted in the formation of Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM).

After the corporate transition between 1960 and 1964 concluded, in which the Rambler marque under VAM surpassed the commercial results of its local predecessors Armadora Mexicana and Planta REO combined between 1950 and 1959, the company opted not to offer the Ambassador model. The Mexican market of the era was still relatively small. Since the Ambassador mainly shared the same styling as the contemporary midsize model, internal competition would affect the sales of a simultaneous Classic and Ambassador line-up. Unlike the United States, with a larger and more diverse market for two different car lines with the same styling, AMC could differentiate the models with V8 engines for the Ambassador and the Classic limited to six-cylinder versions. This advantage did not exist in Mexico since VAM could only produce six-cylinder engines in its Lerma plant, while V8 engines could not be imported from AMC because of the 1962 decree. Instead, VAM opted to use the Rambler Classic as its most luxurious and flagship model, giving it the same treatment AMC put in the Ambassador model in the US and Canada. This would be passed on to the subsequent equivalent Rebel and Matador models produced under VAM.

The 1958 and 1959 Ambassador models represent the only chapter in this model&#x27;s history in Mexico. These were the only full-size American Motors products sold in the country, alongside the second generation 1974-1976 VAM Classic (Matador) models. It was also unique because it was a factory V8 model, the only AMC-based car marketed in Mexico with a V8 engine. Six-cylinder engines would power all subsequent models produced by the VAM.

==International exports==

===Canada===
The Brampton Assembly Plant in Ontario, Canada, had been building Rambler and AMC vehicles since 1962, including the Rambler Ambassador until 1968. From 1969, Canadian-market Ambassadors were imported directly from the United States. The Brampton plant continued to assemble AMC vehicles through the 1970s and 1980s with the additional exceptions of Javelin, Matador, and Pacer, which were also otherwise imported.

===Finland===
Ramblers were imported into Finland by two major Finnish automotive importers, Oy Voimavaunu Ab and Suomen Maanvilelijäin Kauppa Oy (SMK Group) during the 1950s and 1960s. From 1962, the Rambler brand was advertised in Finland as an &quot;American success car&quot;. Available models included the Ambassador, Classic, and the compact American. From the mid-1960s, the Wihuri Group, a sizeable multi-sector family business, took over import operations using its shipping operation, Autola Oy. Wihuri continued to import small numbers of AMC vehicles until 1975.

===Germany===
In 1969, American Motors did a deal with the Jaguar and Aston Martin importer for the Federal Republic of Germany, Peter Lindner GmbH in Frankfurt-Rödelheim. Peter Lindner became the distributor of AMC vehicles for West Germany, with the agreement to import seven AMC models including the AMC Ambassador. Peter Lindner continued to import AMC vehicles until 1977 after which German company Allrad Schmitt became the exclusive distributor for AMC passenger cars and Jeep.

===New Zealand===

American Motors&#x27; vehicles were assembled in New Zealand by VW Motors in Auckland until 1962, and Campbell Motor Industries (CMI) in Thames, North Island from 1964. CMI assembled the Rambler Classic and Rebel models from knock-down kits and also imported fully assembled factory-right-hand-drive vehicles directly from AMC. Although neither firm locally assembled Ambassadors, twelve 1970 factory-right-hand-drive Ambassadors were believed to have been imported.

These factory-right-hand-drive Ambassadors were built with the same dash, cluster, and instruments as the right-hand-drive Ambassadors previously built for the United States Postal Service in 1967. As with U.S domestic models, these export models to New Zealand and Australia came with their dash, steering column, and steering wheel color-matched to the interior trim; whereas the dash, steering column, and steering wheel provided for the Rebel and Matador assembly kits built in New Zealand and Australia were available only in black.

===Norway===
Ramblers were imported into Norway in the 1950s and 1960s by Norwegian firm Kolberg Caspary Lautom AS at Ås, Norway. KCL was formed in 1906 and imported automotive, industrial, and construction products. Three 1962 model year Ambassadors were brought to Norway in 1962. The Rambler Ambassador was imported by KCL in small numbers from 1963 until 1968. The company brought a total of 21 cars. KCL imported more significant numbers of the Rambler American, Classic, and Rebel during the same period.

===United Kingdom===
Rambler Ambassadors were exported in limited numbers to the United Kingdom in factory right-hand-drive direct from AMC during the 1960s and up to its final year of 1974. They were imported by Rambler Motors (A.M.C) Ltd of Chiswick in West London, which had become a subsidiary of AMC in 1961. The location had previously been used since 1926 for British assembly of Hudson, Essex, and Terraplane vehicles. Before 1961, AMC vehicles were imported into the U.K. by Nash Concessionaires, the former importer of pre-AMC Nash and post-AMC Rambler vehicles.

Right-hand-drive Ambassador models marketed in the UK were the Ambassador saloon (sedan), SST coupe, and station wagon. The one-year-only Ambassador convertible for 1967 was also sold. AMC vehicles were distributed by London distributors Clarke and Simpson Limited and were marketed as &quot;the only American car built with RHD&quot;. As with all export markets, the UK models were marketed as &quot;Rambler&quot; even after the Rambler marque was dropped in the United States.

Kenosha-built right-hand-drive Ambassadors were built with the same 1967 Ambassador dash and double dials as right-hand-drive Rebels and Matadors assembled from knock-down kits in Australia and New Zealand. As with the Australian-built second-generation Matador, the UK-market Ambassador and Matador models built at Kenosha used the newer 1974 U.S.-version triple rectangular instrument dials in the older 1967 dash.

== Epilogue ==
Because AMC was focusing its attention on their newly acquired Jeep line, the redesigned 1974 Matador coupe, and the AMC Pacer, which would debut in 1975, the company would not put forth the investment to continue the full-size Ambassador line after its 1974 redesign. Instead, the automaker upgraded the Matador sedan and wagon counterparts, starting with the 1975 model year. AMC has used the automobile platform since the 1967 model year, and the full-size automobile market segment is declining. American Motors&#x27; strategy was now aimed at smaller cars and sport-utility vehicles.

The Ambassador was effectively continued in the similarly sized and styled Matador line of sedans and wagons. From 1975, they became available in uplevel &quot;Brougham&quot; trim and assumed the model numbers of the previously equivalent Ambassadors. The Matador was also offered in a unique top-of-the-line Barcelona four-door in its final year of production, 1978.

<text>Nelson Mandela University, formerly Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, is a public university in South Africa. Established in 1882 as Port Elizabeth, Art School it comprises the former University of Port Elizabeth, the Port Elizabeth Technikon and Vista University&#x27;s Port Elizabeth campus. This university has its main administration in the coastal city of Gqeberha. 

Nelson Mandela University was founded through a merger of three institutions in January 2005, but its history dates back to 1882, with the foundation of the Port Elizabeth Art School. It is a comprehensive university offering professional and vocational training. The university has seven campuses – six in Gqeberha and one in George. The main campus of the university is the South Campus. Students at Nelson Mandela University can study towards a diploma or a degree up to doctoral level. A number of courses include workplace experience as part of the curriculum at Nelson Mandela University. English is the university&#x27;s medium of instruction.

== History and formation ==

Plans for the then NMMU where first revealed in 2002, by then Minister of Education, Kader Asmal. The proposal was part of larger plan to restructure higher education in South Africa.
The first step in the merger came with the incorporation of Vista PE by UPE on 2 January 2004, followed by the merger of PE Technikon and UPE on 1 January 2005.

NMMU was formed in 2005 through the merger of the Port Elizabeth Technikon, and the University of Port Elizabeth. In 2004, prior to the merger, UPE had taken control of the Port Elizabeth Campus of Vista University. PE Technikon had a satellite campus in George, which was also merged. The first chancellor of the university was Chief Justice Pius Langa, and Justice Ronnie Pillay was the first chairperson of Council. Rolf Stumpf was the first vice-chancellor and chief executive officer of the university, and was succeeded by Professor Derrick Swartz on 1 January 2008. Professor Sibongile Muthwa is the current vice-chancellor after her appointment in 2017.

The name of the university was formally changed from Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University to Nelson Mandela University on 20 July 2017.

=== PE Technikon ===
PE Technikon had its roots in the Port Elizabeth Art School, which was founded in 1882 and was the oldest art school in South Africa, situated in Russell Road, Central. It was later renamed the College for Advanced Technical Education (CATE). The college moved to University Way in Summerstrand in 1974, and became PE Technikon in 1979. The Port Elizabeth Teachers&#x27; Training College was located in 2nd Avenue, Summerstrand. It was taken over by PE Technikon in 1994, and became known as the College Campus.

Saasveld Forestry College was founded as the Tokai School for Forest Apprentices in 1912 in Cape Town. The school was an offshoot of the South African College Schools. In 1932, it moved to its current location, between George and Knysna. The campus was taken over by PE Technikon from the Department of Agriculture in 1985.

The Algoa College of Education was situated in Struandale, approximately away from Summerstrand. It became part of the PE Technikon in 2001, and was known as the Algoa Campus. In 2001, the George Campus was added to by purchasing Hurteria Building in the city centre.

At the time of the merger, PE Technikon had more than 10 000 students. The institution&#x27;s last Chancellor was former Speaker of Parliament Frene Ginwala, the last Vice-Chancellor Prof Hennie Snyman and the last Chair of Council being Mr Clive Stanton.

=== University of Port Elizabeth ===
The University of Port Elizabeth was the country&#x27;s first dual-medium (English and Afrikaans) residential university.
It came into being on 31 January, with the adoption by Parliament of Act 1 of 1964. The first academic year commenced on 1 March 1965. Initially situated in a series of buildings on Bird Street, in the historic Central district, UPE moved to a modern, purpose-built campus – incorporating residences, a sports complex and the towering Main Building in Summerstrand in 1974. The campus was officially opened in August 1975, and the final move from Bird Street came in 1979 with the opening of the science blocks at Summerstrand. The university retained some of its Bird Street buildings and these became the centre of community outreach activities.

Built on 830 ha of land donated by the then Port Elizabeth City Council, the campus was declared a nature reserve in 1983.

At the time of the merger, UPE had more than 9 000 contact students and almost 5 000 distance education students. The last Chancellor was Brigalia Bam, the last Vice-Chancellor Prof Nthabiseng Ogude and the last Chair of Council Mr Trevor Jennings.

=== Vista University ===
Vista was founded in 1981. The Port Elizabeth campus was built in 1982. Subsequently, seven decentralised contact tuition campuses were established, centred on township areas where the need for accessible and affordable higher education was most urgent. In 1982 the Port Elizabeth campus consisted of a small, prefabricated building patched between the national road to Uitenhage and the edge of Zwide township. Its location opened up access to higher education for many students from socially and financially disadvantaged backgrounds.

The campus had its first academic year in 1983, and in 1991 a permanent brick structure was completed. Later additions, such as the Conference Hall and Arena, provided accessible facilities for the surrounding community for large events. With seating for 5 000, the Arena is the Eastern Cape&#x27;s largest indoor venue.

Initially focused on the upgrading of teachers through its Education Faculty, in its subsequent growth Vista far surpassed the narrow field of expertise cut out for it, producing graduates in business, law, science and the humanities.

At the time of the merger, Vista PE had approximately 2 000 students and was led by Acting Campus Principal Prof Miemie Struwig.
with its first academic year in 1983. It was taken over by UPE.

== Governance and administration ==
The ceremonial head of the university is the chancellor, who, in the name of the university, confers all qualifications. The vice-chancellor is responsible for the day-to-day running of the university. Deputy vice-chancellors for research, innovation and internationalisation, learning and teaching, people and operations as well as the registrar, acting as the secretary to the university&#x27;s council, assist the vice-chancellor in her duties. There is an executive dean for each faculty, as well as learning and teaching. Other management committee positions are the dean of students, and campus principals for the Missionvale and George campuses.

The current chancellor is Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, appointed in 2018. The current vice-chancellor is Sibongile Muthwa, who was appointed in 2017. Dr Kaluke Mawila is the campus principal at George Campus and the current Missionvale campus principal is Phakama Ntshongwana.

<text>John Nicholas Maw (5 November 1935 – 19 May 2009) was a British composer. Among his works are the operas &quot;The Rising of the Moon&quot; (1970) and &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot; (2002).

==Biography==
Born in Grantham, Lincolnshire, Maw was the son of Clarence Frederick Maw and Hilda Ellen Chambers. He attended the Wennington School, a boarding school, in Wetherby in the West Riding of Yorkshire. His mother died of tuberculosis when he was 14. He attended the Royal Academy of Music on Marylebone Road in London where his teachers were Paul Steinitz and Lennox Berkeley. He then studied in Paris with Nadia Boulanger and Max Deutsch.

From 1998 until 2008, Maw served on the faculty of the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins University, where he taught music composition. He had previously served on the faculties of Yale University, Bard College, Boston University, the Royal Academy of Music, Cambridge University, and Exeter University.

===Personal life===

In 1960, Maw married Karen Graham, and they had a son and a daughter. Their marriage was dissolved in 1976. He took up residence in Washington, DC in 1984, living there with his companion Maija Hay, a ceramic artist, until his death. He died at home on 19 May 2009, at age 73, as a result of heart failure with complications from diabetes.

On Sunday 6 November 2011, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a 2-hour tribute called, &quot;Nicholas Maw: A Celebration&quot;. The program featured performances of Maw&#x27;s Violin Concerto, an orchestral suite drawn from his opera, &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot;, and two choral works (&quot;One foot in Eden still, I stand&quot; and &quot;Hymnus&quot;).

==Compositions==
Maw is best known for &quot;Scenes and Arias&quot; (1962) for three female voices and orchestra, the orchestral pieces &quot;Odyssey&quot; (1987) and &quot;The World in the Evening&quot; (1988), the guitar work &quot;Music of Memory&quot; (1989) and a violin concerto (1993) written for Joshua Bell. His music has been described as neo-romantic but also as modernist and non-tonal (for instance &quot;Personæ&quot;, his cycle of piano pieces).

In 2002, the opera &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot; (based on William Styron&#x27;s novel) was commissioned by BBC Radio 3 and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. It was premièred at the Royal Opera House under the direction of Sir Simon Rattle, and afterwards received a new production by stage director Markus Bothe at the Deutsche Oper Berlin and the Volksoper Wien, which had its North American premiere by the Washington National Opera in October 2006. Mezzo-soprano Angelika Kirchschlager, who sang Sophie in London, reprised the role at the National Opera, joined by American baritone Rod Gilfry as Nathan Landau, the schizophrenic man who initially rescues Sophie and then persuades her to join him in a suicide pact. Maw also prepared a concert suite for orchestra based on the music.

&quot;Odyssey&quot; was performed in BBC&#x27;s Maida Vale Studios on 9 December 2005, and was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 two days later. Rattle has also conducted a recording of the work with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.

<text>The Ford D2C platform (for &quot;D-class 2-door coupe&quot;) is one of Ford&#x27;s rear-wheel drive automobile platforms.

The platform basics are a MacPherson strut suspension in front and 3-link solid axle in the rear with a Panhard rod. Unlike previous Special Vehicle Team (SVT) Mustang variations, the Shelby GT500 does not include independent rear suspension, but instead has a solid rear axle.

Considered a new platform by Ford Motor Company, D2C is loosely based on the Ford DEW platform which served as the basis for the Lincoln LS, Ford Thunderbird, and Jaguar S-Type. The 2005 S197 Mustang was originally designed to use a &quot;Lite&quot; version of the DEW98 platform, but while that plan was eventually scrapped as too expensive, most D2C platform development completed prior to that decision was retained. This led to the carryover of several DEW98 chassis components. These components include the floor pans, portions of the transmission tunnel, the front frame rails, and basic fuel tank design. 

Differences between D2C and DEW98 are most noticeable in the suspension: The DEW98-based Lincoln LS uses a 4-wheel independent double wishbone suspension. The D2C platform&#x27;s MacPherson strut front suspension and solid axle rear suspension are less expensive to produce than DEW&#x27;s more complicated setup. D2C also shares components with other Ford platforms. These include Ford&#x27;s global C1 platform, with which D2C shares front strut and rear trailing arm components.

Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Way Forward&quot; plan called for Mustang derivative models (such as a 4-door) to be launched by 2008, but that never occurred. 

The next D2C-based Mustang was launched in Model Year 2015 with the new S550, adding an independent rear suspension (IRS). In 2023, the S650 became the third iteration of the Mustang to use the D2C platform, and featured several upgrades including new stabilizers, lower control arms, rear suspension links, shocks, and springs.

<text>The Pinson Mounds comprise a prehistoric Native American complex located in Madison County, Tennessee, in the region that is known as the Eastern Woodlands. The complex, which includes 17 mounds, an earthen geometric enclosure, and numerous habitation areas, was most likely built during the Middle Woodland period (c. 1-500 AD). The complex is the largest group of Middle Woodland mounds in the United States. Sauls&#x27; Mound, at , is the second-highest surviving mound in the United States.

The Pinson Mounds are now part of Pinson Mounds State Archaeological Park, one of two archaeological parks in Tennessee (the other being Old Stone Fort near Manchester). Pinson Mounds is a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geographic setting==

The Pinson Mounds are located on a plateau-like upland above the wetlands that line the banks of the South Fork of the Forked Deer River. The river and its wetlands form the complex&#x27;s southern boundary. The Pinson Mounds are located amidst three distinctive biotic zones: the oak forests atop the plateau, the cypress forests in the wet bottomlands, and the beech forests on the slopes between the uplands and the bottomlands. The ground is mostly composed of Tertiary period rocks known for producing high-quality clay.

The mounds complex can be roughly divided into three sections— the Inner section, situated at the center of the complex around Saul&#x27;s Mound, the Western (or Ozier) section, and the Eastern section, which includes the geometric enclosure. A stream known as Hudson Branch runs perpendicular to the Forked Deer River and divides the Inner section from the Western section. The Eastern and Western sections are both roughly 1,500 meters from the Inner section.

The Pinson Mounds complex is managed by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. The Western section is managed by the Tennessee Division of Forestry and includes a nursery and irrigation pond. Pinson Mounds State Archaeological Park is located appx. 2.5 miles east of the town of Pinson and approximately 10 miles southeast of Jackson.

==Archaeological features==

The Pinson Mounds complex covers approximately and contains at least 30 mounds, 17 of which have been identified as being completely or partially constructed by prehistoric peoples. The mounds range in height from the prominent 72-foot Saul&#x27;s Mound to barely noticeable rises. Most mounds were probably constructed between 100 and 300 AD, based on radiocarbon dating and the predominance of Woodland-period artifacts found at the site. The following are major features at the Pinson Mounds site:

===Inner Complex===

* Sauls&#x27; Mound (Mound 9), at the center of the complex. The mound was named after John Sauls, the owner of the property before its purchase by the state. Sauls&#x27; Mound is the second-highest prehistoric mound in the United States. The mound is rectangular in formation, with each corner aligned with one of the four cardinal directions. The mound&#x27;s function was believed to be ceremonial. A viewing platform has been constructed atop the mound for park visitors. Dimensions: base— 112 x 91 meters, height— 22 meters.
* Mound 10, a few meters to the east of Sauls&#x27; Mound. Mound 10 is believed to have been a platform mound with a ceremonial function. Dimensions: base— 61 x 40 meters, height— 1.3 meters.
* Mound 11 Sector, a few meters to the north of Sauls&#x27; Mound, behind the museum. Mound 11 is a natural rise that is believed to have been a habitation area during the Middle Woodland period.
* Mound 12, several meters southwest of Sauls&#x27; Mound. Mound 12 was a burial mound built upon an Early Woodland habitation area. Dimensions: base— 23 x 17 meters, height— 1.3 meters.
* Mound 14 Sector, several meters southwest of Sauls&#x27; Mound. The Mound 14 Sector was a late-Woodland/early-Mississippian habitation area.
* Mound 15, several hundred meters southwest of Sauls&#x27; Mound. Part of Mound 15 has been destroyed by cultivation. Dimensions: base— 46 x 50 meters, height— appx. 1 meter.
* Mound 17, several hundred meters southeast of Sauls&#x27; Mound. Dimensions: appx. 12 meters long with a height of 1 meter.

===Eastern Section===

* The Eastern Citadel, an earthen geometric enclosure located approximately east of Sauls&#x27; Mound. William Myer gave the enclosure its present name in the early 20th century, although archeologists believe its function to have been primarily ceremonial rather than defensive. The walls form a near-perfect semicircle with a diameter of , enclosing approximately . The height of the walls is, on average, approximately . The enclosed area is not level, with the western edge being approximately lower than the eastern edge.
* Mound 29, a rectangular platform mound located along the eastern edge of the geometric enclosure. Mound 29 is aligned with Sauls&#x27; Mound in the direction of the equinox sunrise. Dimensions: base— , height— .
* Mound 30, a bird-shaped mound a few meters south of Mound 29. The bird shape is thought to have been due to recent cultivation and subsequent erosion. Dimensions: approximately long with a height .
* Mound 28, a rectangular platform mound located approximately northeast of Sauls&#x27; Mound and several hundred meters north of the Eastern Citadel. Mound 28 is almost aligned with Sauls&#x27; Mound in the direction of the summer solstice sunrise. Dimensions: base— , height— .

===Western (Ozier) Section===

* The Ozier Mound (Mound 5), a rectangular platform mound with an earthen ramp facing northeast. At 33 feet, the Ozier Mound is the second-largest mound in the complex. Dimensions: approximately in diameter, height of .
* The Twin Mounds (Mound 6), a double-conical mound located a few meters south of the Ozier Mound. The Twin Mounds were burial mounds. Base approximately .
* Mound 31, a burial mound located a few meters south of the Ozier Mound. Base appx. 40 x 60 meters.
* The Cochran Area, a site located approximately west of the Ozier Mound section. The Cochran Area is believed to have been a temporary habitation area. The Cochran area covers appx. .

== Pinson Mounds in recorded history ==

After the Chickasaw were forced from much of West Tennessee in 1818, land speculator Joel Pinson arrived in what is now Madison County to survey the area. Pinson &quot;discovered&quot; the complex which was named after him in 1820. The complex did not receive much attention until a Jackson-area journalist named J.G. Cisco began writing about it in the late 19th century. Cisco&#x27;s articles drew the interest of the Smithsonian Institution.

In 1916 the Smithsonian dispatched the archaeologist William E. Myer to investigate the site. Myer suggested that the entire complex was built according to a master plan, and created a map for the site. In 1947, the Tennessee Division of Forestry purchased the Western section of the Pinson site.

===Archaeological surveys and excavations===

At the request of the Jackson Archaeological Society and the National Park Service, in December 1961 the University of Tennessee archaeologists Fred Fisher and Charles McNutt carried out the first major excavation of the Pinson Mounds. In the Mound 14 Sector, Fisher and McNutt discovered the remains of a house surrounded by a posthole-lined wall-trench and containing a central hearth and storage pits. Based primarily on the vast amount of pre-Mississippian culture debris found at the site and radiocarbon dating of charcoal, Fisher and McNutt concluded that the Pinson Mounds were probably built during the Middle Woodland period, c. 1-500 AD.

Excavations by Dan Morse and Richard Polhemus in 1963 uncovered what they believed was an oval-shaped house, a large hearth, and various refuse pits. Morse and Polhemus agreed that the mounds were mostly built during the Middle Woodland period. The state purchased the prehistoric property in 1965 from the Williams and Saul families. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places that same year.

In the 1970s, John Broster of the Tennessee Division of Archaeology carried out extensive investigations of the site&#x27;s Western section and the Mound 12 Sector. Broster uncovered a human cremation pit and evidence of Early Woodland-period habitation at Mound 12. Broster&#x27;s team also found a number of &quot;exotic&quot; artifacts at the Cochran area. This suggested Pinson Mounds may have been a &quot;manufacture&quot; area for grave goods, or a regional trade center.

In the 1980s, Robert Mainfort discovered six tombs in the Twin Mounds, one of which contained the remains of eight young women wearing headdresses with copper adornments. Another tomb had four older men, one of whom had been buried with two round rattles bearing abstract designs. Mainfort also uncovered a single burial in Mound 31 and evidence of food offerings at the base of the mounds.

Excavations carried out prior to construction of park facilities uncovered a possible habitation area at Mound 11 and a large number of 19th-century artifacts. In the late 1990s, four additional mounds were verified as prehistoric, bringing the total to 17.

===The function of the Pinson Mounds===
The Middle Woodland natives most likely built the Pinson Mounds primarily for religious ceremonial purposes, although their motives have yet to be established definitively. The Ozier Mound contains no burials and because of its shape, ramped and flat-topped, it was most likely used as a ceremonial platform. It is one of the oldest such mounds in the Eastern Woodlands region. At least three of the mounds— 6, 12, and 31— contain burials or cremations. Excavations have turned up a relatively scant amount of cultural material (e.g., arrowheads and pottery fragments), which points to a lack of permanent habitation at the Pinson Mounds site.

Some evidence suggests that the layout of the Pinson Mounds might be due to astronomical alignment, and expresses the people&#x27;s cosmology, as is the case at some later mound complexes, such as Cahokia. The corners of Sauls&#x27; Mound, for instance, face the four cardinal directions. The Eastern and Western sections of the complex are roughly equidistant (appx. 1,500 meters) from the Inner complex, although the alignment is not exact. Mound 29 in the Eastern section is aligned with Sauls&#x27; Mound in the direction of the equinox sunrise, and Mound 28 is &quot;almost&quot; aligned with Sauls&#x27; in the direction of the Summer solstice sunrise. To date, no mound has been found in the direction of the Winter solstice sunrise.

==Pinson Mounds State Archaeological Park==

The park&#x27;s museum is built within a &quot;replica&quot; of a platform mound. Its exhibits include artifacts obtained from the various excavations at the Pinson site, as well as various other artifacts from around the region. The museum is also home to the West Tennessee Regional Archaeology offices and an archaeological library.

The park contains approximately 6 miles of walking trails, most of which explore the mounds and associated features. South of Sauls&#x27; Mound, a boardwalk looks out over the South Fork of the Forked Deer River and its wetlands. The park is also the site of Archaeofest, an event held every September that celebrates the site&#x27;s prehistoric builders.

<text>Monika Mann (7 June 1910 – 17 March 1992) was a German American author and feature writer. She was born in Munich, Germany, the fourth of six children of the Nobel Prize–winning author Thomas Mann and Katia, née Katharina Pringsheim.

She trained as a pianist and her early attempts at a musical career seemed promising, but were not met with success and she instead pursued a career as a writer. She married in 1939 but lost her husband the following year, when the ship on which they were travelling to Canada was sunk by a German submarine. Later that year she joined her family in Princeton, New Jersey, and was granted US citizenship in 1952.

Between 1954 and 1986, she lived with her partner Antonio Spadaro in &quot;Villa Monacone&quot; on Capri. This was her most productive time as a writer and her books and several magazine articles were written during this period. After the death of her partner she left Capri and spent her last years until her death with her brother Golo&#x27;s adopted family in Leverkusen, Germany.

==Family and early life==
Thomas Mann was already well established as a novelist and short story writer at the time of Monika&#x27;s birth, although his Nobel Prize came many years later. Her mother, born Katharina Hedwig Pringsheim, was the daughter of the German Jewish mathematician and artist Alfred Pringsheim and the actress Hedwig Pringsheim. Due to her being the granddaughter of Júlia da Silva Bruhns, she was also of Portuguese-Indigenous Brazilian partial descent.

Monika had an elder sister, Erika (1905–1969) and two elder brothers, Klaus (1906–1949) and &quot;Golo&quot; (1909–1994). A year after Monika&#x27;s birth her mother was ill with a lung complaint and was one of the first patients to be admitted to the &quot;Wald Sanatorium&quot; in Davos, Switzerland. There was an interval of eight years before the birth of the last two children, a sister Elisabeth (1918–2002) and a brother Michael (1919–1977). Her uncle was the novelist Heinrich Mann.

She was not her parents&#x27; favourite. Her father confessed frankly in his diary that, of the six children, he preferred the two oldest, Klaus and Erika, and little Elisabeth. Her mother wrote in 1939 to Klaus that she was determined not to say any more unfriendly words about Monika and to be kind and helpful. In the family letters and chronicles she was often described as weird. &quot;. . . after a three week stay here (in the parental home) she is still the same old dull quaint Mönle (her nickname in the family), pilfering from the larder . . .&quot;.

After boarding school at Schule Schloss Salem she trained as a pianist in Lausanne and spent her young years in Paris, Munich, Frankfurt and Berlin. In 1933 when Hitler came to power she emigrated with her parents to Sanary-sur-Mer in southeastern France. In 1934 she studied music and history of art in Florence, taking private piano tuition from the Italian composer Luigi Dallapiccola.

==Later career==
In Florence she met the Hungarian art historian Jenő Lányi and in 1938 the couple left Italy for London, where they married on 2 March 1939. They left for Canada in 1940 on the &quot;SS City of Benares&quot;, carrying 90 child evacuees, their ten escorts, 91 paying passengers (including 10 children), and 215 crew. On 17 September the ship was sunk by a torpedo from the German submarine, U-48. The couple managed to climb into Lifeboat 6 (also containing Anthony Quinton and his mother). As the lifeboat began to lower, the blocks slid out of place, and the stern end of the boat fell, flinging more than two thirds of the roughly sixty people into the sea. The couple fell into the water. Monika grabbed and clung on to a large piece of wood floating nearby. Jenő, however, drowned, and she heard him call to her three times before he went under. She floated around in the sea for several hours, before a lifeboat, the same Lifeboat 6 from which she had fallen, found her drifting in the sea. The lifeboat was heavily waterlogged and only 23 people were still in the lifeboat. Slowly, one by one, 15 of the occupants died. Mann was one of eight people who survived. Only one other woman, Letitia Quinton, in this lifeboat survived. The only child survivor was Quinton&#x27;s son, Anthony. After 20 hours they were rescued by a British ship and taken to Scotland. Of the 406 people on board the &quot;Benares&quot;, only 148 had survived. Among the 258 people who had died, were 81 children out of 100. She reached New York on 28 October 1940 on the troopship &quot;Cameronia&quot;, and joined her parents, who had moved to the US in 1939, at the outbreak of World War II. For a while she lived with her parents, who showed little sympathy for her. Her traumatic loss of her husband and her attempts at a new beginning with them were ignored. Later she moved into her own apartment near her parents.

From 1943 to 1952, with short breaks, she lived in New York. After attempts to renew her career as a pianist she turned to employment as a writer. In 1952 she was granted US citizenship, but she was already planning her return to Europe. In September she travelled with her sister Elizabeth&#x27;s family to Italy. After a few months in Genoa, Bordighera and Rome she fulfilled her desire to live in a beautiful region by moving to Capri, where she lived in the Villa Monacone with her partner, Antonio Spadaro. In Capri she blossomed. During this period she wrote five books and contributed regular feature pages to Swiss, German and Italian newspapers and magazines. She remained in Capri for 32 years until the spring of 1986, a few months after the death of Spadaro in December 1985.

She was not able to realise her desire to live in Kilchberg, Zurich with her parents, who had returned to Europe. She spent her last years at Leverkusen, North Rhine-Westphalia, in the care of Ingrid Beck-Mann, the widow of her brother Golo&#x27;s adopted son, and died on 17 March 1992. She was buried in the family grave in Kilchberg.

<text>The Gillmore Medal is a military decoration of the United States Army which was first issued on October 28, 1863. The medal is named after Major General Quincy A. Gillmore who commanded Union troops attempting to seize Fort Wagner in 1863 during the American Civil War.

Also called the Fort Sumter Medal, the Gillmore Medal commemorates the men who served in the fighting around Charleston, South Carolina, in 1863 and was presented to all Union soldiers who had served under General Gillmore’s command. The medal was pinned to the front of a military jacket from a swivel with no attached ribbon.

Since the Gillmore Medal was issued on the local authority of General Gillmore, it was considered an unofficial decoration by the United States Army, but was permitted for wear on a military uniform. In 1905, with the creation of the Civil War Campaign Medal, the Gillmore Medal was declared obsolete.

One such medal was awarded to Albert York (commanding Company I, 100th New York Volunteer Infantry) for gallant and meritorious conduct while participating in the Battle of Morris Island, April 1863. These medals are extremely rare because they are usually coveted by the living heirs and rarely come up for sale.

<doc id="881545" wikidata="Q407976" url="?curid=881545" title="Proteoglycan">
<text>Proteoglycans are proteins that are heavily glycosylated. The basic proteoglycan unit consists of a &quot;core protein&quot; with one or more covalently attached glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain(s). The point of attachment is a serine (Ser) residue to which the glycosaminoglycan is joined through a tetrasaccharide bridge (e.g. chondroitin sulfate-GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-PROTEIN). The Ser residue is generally in the sequence -Ser-Gly-X-Gly- (where X can be any amino acid residue but proline), although not every protein with this sequence has an attached glycosaminoglycan. The chains are long, linear carbohydrate polymers that are negatively charged under physiological conditions due to the occurrence of sulfate and uronic acid groups. Proteoglycans occur in connective tissue.

==Types==
Proteoglycans are categorized by their relative size (large and small) and the nature of their glycosaminoglycan chains. Types include:

Certain members are considered members of the &quot;small leucine-rich proteoglycan family&quot; (SLRP). These include decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin and lumican.

==Function==

Proteoglycans are a major component of the animal extracellular matrix, the &quot;filler&quot; substance existing between cells in an organism. Here they form large complexes, both to other proteoglycans, to hyaluronan, and to fibrous matrix proteins, such as collagen. The combination of proteoglycans and collagen form cartilage, a sturdy tissue that is usually heavily hydrated (mostly due to the negatively charged sulfates in the glycosaminoglycan chains of the proteoglycans). They are also involved in binding cations (such as sodium, potassium and calcium) and water, and also regulating the movement of molecules through the matrix. Evidence also shows they can affect the activity and stability of proteins and signalling molecules within the matrix. Individual functions of proteoglycans can be attributed to either the protein core or the attached GAG chain. They can also serve as lubricants, by creating a hydrating gel that helps withstand high pressure.

==Synthesis==

The protein component of proteoglycans is synthesized by ribosomes and translocated into the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Glycosylation of the proteoglycan occurs in the Golgi apparatus in multiple enzymatic steps. First, a special link tetrasaccharide is attached to a serine side chain on the core protein to serve as a primer for polysaccharide growth. Then sugars are added one at a time by glycosyl transferase. The completed proteoglycan is then exported in secretory vesicles to the extracellular matrix of the tissue.

==Clinical significance==

An inability to break down the proteoglycans is characteristic of a group of genetic disorders, called mucopolysaccharidoses. The inactivity of specific lysosomal enzymes that normally degrade glycosaminoglycans leads to the accumulation of proteoglycans within cells. This leads to a variety of disease symptoms, depending upon the type of proteoglycan that is not degraded. Mutations in the gene encoding the galactosyltransferase B4GALT7 result in a reduced substitution of the proteoglycans decorin and biglycan with glycosaminoglycan chains, and cause a spondylodysplastic form of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.

<text>Reelfoot Lake State Park is a state park in the northwest corner of Tennessee in the United States. It encompasses Reelfoot Lake and is situated in Lake and Obion counties. The park itself makes up , divided into ten sections around the lake. A major hunting and fishing preserve, it is part of a much larger wildlife refuge which comprises , of which are water, and harbors almost every kind of shorebird, as well as the golden and American bald eagles. Other animals are also diverse and abundant. The many species of flowering and non-flowering plants attract botany enthusiasts from all over the country. Bald cypress dominates the margins of the lake, but many other trees and shrubs are also present.

== History ==
A series of earthquakes in 1811 and 1812 are credited with the creation of Reelfoot Lake. These seismic events caused a portion of North West Tennessee to subside and the Mississippi River to flow backward for a short period of time. As the water rushed back towards the direction from which it previously came, the forested area adjacent was flooded, creating a new lake.

Reelfoot Lake State Park was established in 1925 when the state purchased land surrounding the lake for preservation. In 1981 The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency successfully introduced nesting eagles to the park.

== Activities ==
Activities at Reelfoot Lake State Park include boating, fishing, hiking, and wildlife viewing. There are picnic facilities, and a museum and nature center. Planned programs and events take place in the park.

=== Boating ===
Reelfoot lake is open to boating throughout the year. Boat ramps are located at various points around the lake. As Reelfoot Lake contains a partially submerged forest, boaters should use caution at all times.

=== Fishing ===
Fishing is available throughout the year on Reelfoot lake. Bass, crappie, and catfish are most popular sought after fish. The appropriate Tennessee fishing license and lake permits are required for anglers. 
=== Hiking ===
Reelfoot Lake State Park offers several easy to moderate trails allowing access to the unique wetland areas available. Trail information is available at the park&#x27;s visitor center.

=== Museum and Visitor Center ===
The R.C. Donaldson Memorial Museum features a variety of exhibits displaying the ecology, history, and culture of the area. The nature center at the museum contains various non-releasable raptors, several snakes, and other wildlife. It also serves as the park Visitor Center.

=== Picnic facilities ===
Reelfoot offers visitors approximately 200 picnic sites. Most of the sites have grills and all sites are adjacent to drinking
water, toilet facilities, and playgrounds. The park also offers five large pavilions for group use.

=== Wildlife viewing ===
A plethora of wildlife is available for viewing at Reelfoot Lake State Park. Popular wildlife for viewing include Bald eagles, golden eagles, ospreys and other birds of prey. Reelfoot Lake is also located on a major migratory bird flyway which creates opportunities to view a variety of waterfowl, shorebirds, herons, and songbirds. It also has a diversity of turtles and snakes. Turtles include the pond slider, painted, and map turtles. Snakes include the banded and diamondback water snakes, the venomous cottonmouth, and the milk and corn snakes. Frogs, also common, include the green frog, and the gray and green tree frogs, which are vocal during the summers.

=== Planned programs ===
Rangers at Reelfoot offer a variety of programs throughout the year. From January through Mid-March, the park offers a bald eagle tour around Reelfoot lake. Scenic boat tours are offered on the lake from May through September.

<doc id="881548" wikidata="Q6564815" url="?curid=881548" title="List of British Jews">
<text>List of British Jews is a list of prominent Jews from the United Kingdom and its predecessor states.

Although the first Jews may have arrived on the island of Great Britain with the Romans, it was not until the Norman Conquest of William the Conqueror in 1066 that organised Jewish communities first appeared in England. These existed until 1290 when the Jewish population of England was expelled by King Edward I of England.

There was never a corresponding expulsion from Scotland. The eminent scholar David Daiches states in his autobiographical &quot;Two Worlds: A Scottish born Jewish Childhood&quot; that there are grounds for saying that Scotland is the only Immigrant country with no history of state persecution of Jews.

Jews were re-admitted to England and Wales in 1656 by Oliver Cromwell. Slightly more than 200 years later, in 1858 they were emancipated, that is, accepted as full citizens. In the late 19th century, there was mass Jewish immigration to England from Russia due to Russian domestic policy. In the 1930s, the country accepted many refugees from Nazism. The Jewish population peaked at 450,000, but has since declined due to low birth-rate, intermarriage and emigration, mainly of the younger generation to Israel. According to the 2001 census, the current population is around 295,000, most of whom live in London.

<text>Bishop&#x27;s Mills is a community in the municipality of North Grenville, United Counties of Leeds and Grenville, in eastern Ontario, Canada, approximately south of Ottawa, south of Kemptville and east of Merrickville. An unincorporated place and Compact Rural Community, it has a population of about 135 and is the home of the Bishops Mills Natural History Centre.

The village name is derived from a grist mill and a saw mill built on a branch of the Rideau River, today called the North Branch of Kemptville Creek, by Chauncey Bishop (1796–1877) and his brother, Ira (1803–1883). Descended from Loyalists originally from Connecticut, Chauncey and Ira founded Bishop&#x27;s Mills in the 1840s on land acquired from King&#x27;s College, now the University of Toronto. This land was part of Lot 2 and 3, 9th Concession of Oxford Township, Grenville County, in what was then known as Upper Canada. A surveyed village plan was registered in 1885.

<text>Michael Thomas Mann (April 21, 1919 – January 1, 1977) was a German-born musician and professor of German literature.

==Life==
Born in Munich, Michael Mann was the youngest and sixth child of writer Thomas Mann and Katia Mann. His older siblings were Erika, Klaus, Golo, Monika and Elisabeth. He was of Jewish descent from his mother&#x27;s side. Due to his being the grandson of Júlia da Silva Bruhns, he was also of Portuguese-Indigenous Brazilian partial descent.

He studied viola and violin in Zürich, Paris and New York City. 

He was a viola player in the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra from 1942 to 1947 as well as being a solo viola player. Accompanied by pianist Yaltah Menuhin, he made a concert tour in 1951 and recorded the 1948 &quot;Viola Sonata&quot; by Ernst Krenek. He was forced to give up professional music due to a neuropathy.

Mann gained a master&#x27;s degree in musicology from Duquesne University and a PhD in German literature from Harvard before joining the German faculty at the University of California, Berkeley in 1961.

Mann published a number of books on musicology, short stories, an opera libretto and journal articles. Subjects of his publications included Goethe, Heinrich Heine, Schiller, Schubart and his father&#x27;s works.

He was married to Gret and they had two sons, (born 1940) and Toni as well as an adopted daughter, Raju.

He died of a heart attack at age 57 in Orinda, California on 1 January 1977. There is a stone with his name on it on his parents&#x27; grave in Kilchberg, Switzerland.

<doc id="881551" wikidata="Q302169" url="?curid=881551" title="Balut (food)">
<text>Balut ( , ; also spelled as balot) is a fertilized developing egg embryo that is boiled or steamed and eaten from the shell. It is commonly sold as street food, often eaten with salt and vinegar, most notably in the Philippines, Cambodia (, ), and Vietnam (), and also occasionally in Thailand ().

The length of incubation before the egg is cooked is a matter of local preference, but generally ranges from two to three weeks.

==Description==

A balut is a fertilized bird egg (usually a duck) that is incubated for a period of 14 to 21 days, depending on the local culture, and then steamed. The contents are eaten directly from the shell. Balut that is incubated for longer periods have a well-developed embryo and the features of the duckling are recognizable. The partially developed embryo bones are soft enough to chew and swallow as a whole. The mallard duck (&quot;Anas platyrhynchus&quot;), also known as the &quot;Pateros duck&quot;, is often used to make balut. Balut is a renowned dish due to its different developmental stages; some people prefer it when the duck embryo is still largely liquid, while others prefer it when it is more mature and has a chewier texture. A combination of savory, gamey, and rich characteristics can be found in the flavor, which makes it an acquired taste that many Filipinos treasure as a culinary treat and a part of their culture.

Balut is common street food in the Philippines, Vietnam, and other localities, and is also sold in stores and malls. It is a relatively cheap source of protein and calcium. Balut was introduced to the Philippines by the Chinese in 1565 or around 1885, and since then, balut has been included as a traditional part of the culture. Wherever Filipinos migrated for work, a large market for balut would develop. Controversies arose as knowledge of the food spread around the Southeast Asian countries and then globally. People have questioned the ethics of eating balut. Ethical concerns are most often attributed to the presence of a fertilized embryo within the dish, given the fact that the egg has not yet hatched nor been given the chance to hatch.

==Preparation==
Traditionally, the fertilized eggs are incubated in the sun or buried in sand and stored in baskets to retain warmth. In order for the embryo to develop normally, it must be exposed to heat for the correct period of time while ensuring that the temperature is not too hot to harm the eggs or too cold to permit growth. The embryo is extremely sensitive to high temperatures and is easily killed upon cooking in the sun. Within the first few stages of maturation, balut is known as &quot;balut sa puti&quot; (&quot;wrapped in white&quot;) when it is white; the embryo inside is insufficiently developed to show a beak, feathers, or claws, and the bones are undeveloped. These are made from very specific egg types, less than five days old and with no visible surface cracks.

The duration of egg incubation is a matter of local preference. In the Philippines, balut is generally incubated for 14 to 18 days before being boiled for consumption. At about 14 to 16 days of incubation, the embryo floats on top of the egg white and yolk, and the balut is called &quot;mamatong&quot;. For most balut makers, the ideal incubation is said to be 17 days old.

There are other versions of balut. In the Cambodian version, &quot;pong tea khon&quot;, the egg is incubated for 18 to 20 days. In the Vietnamese version, &quot;trứng vịt lộn&quot;, the egg is incubated for 19 to 21 days, when the embryo is old enough to be recognizable as a baby duck and has bones that will be firm but tender when cooked. Some men prefer to eat an embryo that is much more developed, &quot;...so that it looks gross, because that is a way to prove your manhood.&quot;

== Chemistry of cooking ==

During this cooking process, changes occur in the food chemistry of balut, such as the sol dispersion of water molecules within the embryonic fluid. This liquid becomes the broth for the solid which are parts of the duck within the egg. Although balut mainly consists of protein, fat is present and is emulsified within the fertilized embryo. After cooking, it can be considered a protein gel, depending on the length of time it was cooked. Heating high-protein food such as balut can cause the chemical changes to take place and fully or partially denature proteins, causing the surface to become thick and causing an irreversible gel protein to form.

Temperature has a significant impact on the final taste and texture of the cooked balut. Warm temperatures of change the taste and texture of the yolk by making it more grainy. This can be attributed to the changes in proteins, and their partial denaturation, during the heating and incubation process. When boiling or cooking eggs, the white of the egg tends to solidify because the proteins are denatured in an irreversible reaction and turn from transparent to an opaque white. Physical and chemical changes in the final balut product can also be attributed to microbial infections and the rate that microbes infect the balut at various stages.

There are many chemical changes that occur inside the duck egg as it is being processed, which can vary depending on how or what it is cooked with. While boiling, added salt can contribute to a number of chemical changes; it seems to increase the proportional weight of egg white within the shell, which can be due to the weight differences between the embryo and the egg white itself. Added salt can also increase the hardness of the egg yolk and affect the overall texture of the final balut product. Other chemical changes observed in nutrient content of the duck egg as it is processed are a slight decrease in the amount of available amino acids, water-soluble vitamins, and minerals after the processing is complete.

== Nutrition ==
There are different nutritional values for balut, since it can be either fertilized chicken or duck eggs. Balut nutrition specifications between chicken and duck have minor differences, but both eggs have around 14 grams of crude protein, 188 calories each, and around 100 milligrams of calcium. A duck egg might have a higher value of nutrition than a chicken egg, but overall, both chicken and duck balut have approximately the same nutritional value.

In folk medicine, according to popular Vietnamese belief, these eggs are a nutritious and restorative food for pregnant or delivering women.

==Dishes and vending==
Balut eggs are savored for their balance of textures and flavors. The broth surrounding the embryo is sipped from the egg before the shell is peeled, and the yolk and young chick inside can be eaten. All of the contents of the egg may be consumed, although the white albumen may remain uneaten, depending on the age of the fertilized egg. This white albumen may have an unappetizing cartilaginous taste and is tough and rubbery in texture.

In the Philippines, balut have recently entered &quot;haute cuisine&quot; by being served as appetizers in restaurants, cooked adobo style, fried in omelettes, or even used as filling in baked pastries. In Vietnam, balut is eaten with a pinch of pepper salt with lime/kumquat or ginger and rau răm (also known as laksa leaf). The dish &quot;trứng vịt lộn&quot; can be served as boiled balut or grilled balut. In Cambodia, balut is eaten while still warm in the shell and served with nothing more than a little garnish, which is usually a mixture of lime juice and ground pepper.

A similar preparation is known in China as &quot;maodan&quot; (), &quot;modan&quot; (), &quot;wangjidan&quot; (), or &quot;huozhuzi&quot; (). Chinese traders and migrants are said to have brought the idea of eating fertilized duck eggs to the Philippines; however, the knowledge and craft of balut-making has been localized by the balut-makers (&quot;magbabalut&quot;). Today, balut production has not been mechanized in favor of the traditional production by hand.

Vendors sell cooked balut from buckets of sand (used to retain warmth) accompanied by small packets of salt. Uncooked balut are rarely sold in Southeast Asia. In the United States, Asian markets occasionally carry uncooked balut eggs. Alternatively, they can be ordered by mail. The cooking process is identical to that of hard-boiled chicken eggs, and baluts are eaten while still warm.

Duck eggs that are not properly developed after nine to twelve days are sold as &quot;penoy&quot;, which look, smell, and taste similar to a regular hard-boiled egg. In Filipino cuisine, these are occasionally beaten and fried, similar to scrambled eggs, and served with a vinegar dip.

== Consumption and uses ==
=== Locations of consumption ===
Balut is consumed in high amounts within countries in Southeast Asia, including Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines. Pateros is a first-class municipality in metro Manila, Philippines, that is famous for its duck-raising industry and balut production. The Pateros municipality was actually named for its duck farmers by speakers of Spanish.

Balut is recognized as a national food of the Philippines. It is commonly sold as a street food and served as an appetizer in restaurants. The taste of balut is similar to chicken soup, and it has an unusual texture.

Balut is found in some countries and locations of North America. While it cannot be found in every store in North America, specialty stores such as T&amp;T — and, in particular, Filipino stores in the Greater Vancouver area — often sell balut. In the United States, growers such as Metzer Farms specialize in balut production, spreading the knowledge of balut and its awareness.

One reason it may not be found or consumed as frequently in North America is that the majority of people outside of Southeast Asia still recognize balut as a novel and taboo food and are often anxious about trying it.

=== Consumption ===
In the Philippines, balut is often eaten with salt or a chili, garlic, and vinegar (white or coconut sap) mixture to season, depending on personal preference. Balut can be served in many ways and may be cooked, boiled, or fried. It may be cooked adobo style, fried in omelets, or used as filling in pastries. Although balut is globally recognized as a Filipino food, it is being consumed less and less in the Philippines. This is partly due to increasingly Western tastes, but also because balut is often associated with poverty.

Some countries and locations will serve balut raw, although this is not a common practice. &quot;Raw&quot;, in this sense, could mean the balut was lightly boiled or cooked very briefly. This is potentially dangerous, since it increases the risk of spoiling and of ingesting harmful microorganisms.

In Saigon, Vietnam, balut can be found in the streets, where vendors operate on the back of motorbikes in alleys. Balut is served as quail eggs. First, it is steamed and then served with salt, chili, and pepper.

== Incubation and storage ==

Balut is considered to be a street food, and like many other street foods, it is best consumed as soon as it is prepared and served. Sources suggest that at most, the shelf life of a cooked balut is one day, but it can last up to a week in the refrigerator.

According to the FDA Food Code, balut can perish over time or due to temperature changes. After being cooked, balut should be handled either at and above or kept at or below .

While most countries have specific regulations and standards for food, Canada has certain egg regulations pertaining to what products can be labelled as an egg. Balut eggs are not subjected to the egg regulations in Canada under the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, meaning they do not require the specific labeling requirements and rules of the traditional chicken egg.

==Religious prohibitions==
Eating balut is forbidden for some religious groups. Both Judaism and Islam have strict prohibitions on consuming food that is prepared in manners incompatible with religiously prescribed dietary laws. In Judaism, the embryo of a chick inside an egg of a bird, even a kosher bird, is forbidden for consumption. The Quran forbids consumption of meat if the animal has not been slaughtered properly, making the animal or animal-product &quot;maytah&quot;. Because balut is an egg containing a partially developed embryo, this makes it &quot;haram&quot;, or &quot;forbidden&quot;.

==Animal welfare==
Information relating to whether boiling a partially developed embryo is ethically acceptable or not can be found in the legislation relating to the euthanasia and treatment of research animals. Bird embryos that have reached greater than 50% of their incubation have developed a neural tube sufficient for pain perception; therefore, they should be euthanized by similar methods used in avian neonates, such as anesthetic overdose, decapitation, or prolonged exposure to carbon dioxide. Similarly, in the UK, embryonic birds are &quot;protected animals&quot; once they have reached the last third of their incubation period. There are specified methods of humanely killing protected animals used in research, but boiling is not one of these. Depending on the species of duck, some eggs used for balut would be boiled within the last half or third of embryo development. Duck embryos are often taken off incubation in order to stunt the growth process; the embryos no longer develop and become readily available for purchasing. The RSPCA Australia recommends against boiling the duck embryo from the 18th day of incubation onwards due to the potential for suffering beyond that point, and notes that it is &quot;an area that is yet to be further researched&quot;.

Several groups wish to ban balut. A petition has been raised to get 5,000 signatures to have balut labeled &quot;fertilized duck egg with embryo&quot; and taken off the menu in the Maharlika restaurant, New York. , the restaurant was selling balut for $5 each. As a response to this petition, Filipino New Yorkers have created a counterpetition, asking to leave the food item alone.

==Health==
The incubation temperatures and environment required for the proper development of balut during processing are ideal growth conditions for many bacteria, including &quot;Salmonella enteritidis&quot;. In addition, faecal pathogens can be deposited on the egg shell surface during laying. Balut is therefore labelled as a &quot;Hazardous Food&quot; in Canada. Warnings have been published to obtain balut only from safe, well-known producers.

== Outside Southeast Asia ==
Outside of Southeast Asia, balut has been featured on reality television shows, such as in season 1 of &quot;Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern&quot;, or as part of eating challenges, such as on &quot;Fear Factor&quot; in 2002, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; in 2013, &quot;The Amazing Race Asia 2&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Race Australia 2&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Race Ukraine&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

In the United States, eggs are sold at Asian markets. However, to get the right age eggs and to ensure freshness, it is recommended that they be purchased from a professional or an egg vendor at Asian farmers markets.

==Guinness World Record==

On April 10, 2015, former Pateros mayor Jaime C. Medina collaborated with the Center for Culinary Arts (CCA, Manila) and the History Channel to attempt to set the record for the world&#x27;s largest serving of balut in Pateros, metro Manila. The CCA chefs, headed by Tristan Encarnacion, prepared 1,000 pieces of balut into an adobo dish that was recorded to have weighed 117.5 kilograms. The resulting dish was enjoyed by the townsfolk in a symbolic boodle fight, with tables topped with banana leaves stretching along B. Morcilla Street.

<text>Ross Creek Landing is a golf course in middle Tennessee, located in rolling countryside in Wayne County along the banks of the Tennessee River.

==Golf course==
Ross Creek Landing is a par 72 course designed by Jack Nicklaus. It measures more than 7000 yards from the back tees. There are five sets of tees on every hole to allow golfers of differing abilities to enjoy this course. During the construction and design of this course, Nicklaus made some adjustments to shorten two of the par fives so that the golfer may have the opportunity to reach the green in two shots. He also designed the par 4 fourth hole into a &#x27;drivable&#x27; par 4 that offers a variety of &#x27;go for it&#x27; and &#x27;lay up&#x27; options.

The course offers a variety of wooded and meadow golf holes. Oak, Hickory, Hackberry, Cedar and even some Cypress line the fairways. Marshes and ponds have been created to benefit the environment and provide strategy on some of the golf holes. During the construction of the course, special efforts were made to preserve stream corridors and existing woods and meadows. New grades for the golf course were carefully tied into these existing features so that it appears that the course has always been here.

==History==
Ross Creek Landing was built as a state park golf course called Bear Trace at Ross Creek Landing, the fifth in a series of Nicklaus-designed golf courses located in Tennessee state parks. The state Department of Environment and Conservation sold the property in 2008 after experiencing annual operating losses of about $0.5 million. The sale price of $2.15 million was reported to represent a loss to the state of more than $2.6 million.

<text>Roland Dyens () (19 October 1955 – 29 October 2016) was a French classical guitarist, composer, and arranger.

==Life and career==
Dyens was born in Tunisia and lived most of his life in Paris. He studied with Spanish classical guitarist Alberto Ponce and with Désiré Dondeyne.

As a performer, Dyens was known for improvisation. Sometimes he opened his concerts with an improvised piece, and he might improvise the program itself, without planning or announcing beforehand what he would be playing. He said that a journalist once told him he had the hands of a classical musician but the mind of a jazz musician. He played Bach suites and he played with jazz musicians at the Arvika Festival in Sweden. A heavy metal band did a version of the third movement of his &quot;Libra Sonatine&quot;.

Dyens released several volumes of arrangements that included not only the classical music of Fernando Sor but also the Brazilian music of Heitor Villa-Lobos, jazz standards by Thelonious Monk, the French pop of Edith Piaf, and the Gypsy jazz of Django Reinhardt.

&quot;Tango en Skaï&quot; (1985), is one of his best-known pieces, but also widely played is the more extended &quot;Libra Sonatine&quot; (1986) written in three movements: &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Largo&quot;, &quot;Fuoco&quot;, composed after Dyens had heart surgery.
&quot;Its three movements are an explicit portrayal of that very particular period of my life: first the chaotic India (before the operation), then the Largo (during it) and finally the Fuoco, in which the unrestrained rhythms depict a veritable incarnation of my return to life (and several guitarists often play this last movement as an independent piece)&quot; quotes Dyens. &quot;Skaï&quot; is a French slang term for imitation leather and here refers to the gauchos (cowboys) of Argentina and southern Brazil who are known for their leather outfits.

He taught at Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique in the position held by his teacher, Alberto Ponce. He died on 29 October 2016 at the age of 61.

<text>Shiloh National Military Park preserves the American Civil War Shiloh and Corinth battlefields. The main section of the park is in the unincorporated community of Shiloh, about nine miles (14 km) south of Savannah, Tennessee, with additional areas located in the city of Corinth, Mississippi, 23 miles (37 km) southwest of Shiloh and the Parker&#x27;s Crossroads Battlefield in the city of Parkers Crossroads, Tennessee. The Battle of Shiloh (April 6–7, 1862) began a six-month struggle for the key railroad junction at Corinth. Afterward, Union forces marched from Pittsburg Landing to take Corinth in a May siege, then withstood an October Confederate counter-attack.

The visitor center provides exhibitions, films and a self-guided auto-tour.

==Shiloh battlefield==
The Battle of Shiloh was one of the first major battles in the Western Theater of the American Civil War. The two-day battle, April 6–7, 1862, involved about 65,000 Union troops under Ulysses S. Grant and Don Carlos Buell and 44,000 Confederates under Albert Sidney Johnston (killed in the battle) and P.G.T. Beauregard. The battle resulted in nearly 24,000 killed, wounded, and missing. The two days of fighting did not end in a decisive tactical victory for either side—the Union held the battlefield but failed to pursue the withdrawing Confederate forces. However, it was a decisive strategic defeat for the Confederate forces that had massed to oppose Grant&#x27;s and Buell&#x27;s invasion through Tennessee. After the Battle of Shiloh, the Union forces proceeded to capture Corinth and the critical railroad junction there.

The battlefield is named after Shiloh Methodist Church, a small log church near Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee. Pittsburg Landing is the point on the Tennessee River where the Union forces landed for the battle; they referred to the battle as &quot;The Battle of Pittsburg Landing&quot;.

==Park information==
* Total area: 3,997 acres (16.18 km2)
* Federal area: 3,942 acres (15.95 km2)
* Nonfederal area: 55 acres (0.22 km2)

The Shiloh National Military Park was established on December 27, 1894. In 1904, Basil W. Duke was appointed commissioner of Shiloh National Military Park by President Theodore Roosevelt. There were requests of local farmers who had grown tired of their pigs rooting up the remains of soldiers that had fallen during the battle, insisting that the federal government do something about it. The park was transferred from the War Department to the National Park Service on August 10, 1933. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the military park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. On September 22, 2000, sites associated with the Corinth battlefield (see First and Second Battles of Corinth) were added to the park. The Siege and Battle of Corinth Sites was designated a National Historic Landmark on May 6, 1991. The National Park Travelers Club held its 2013 convention at Shiloh. As of early 2024, the American Battlefield Trust and its federal, state and local partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield in more than 26 different transactions since 2001. Most of this land has been sold or conveyed to the National Park Service and incorporated into the park.

===Visitor center===
Permanent exhibitions, films, displays and self-guided 12-mile auto-tour, stopping at the Peach Orchard, the Hornet&#x27;s Nest and General Johnston&#x27;s death site.

==Shiloh National Cemetery==
Shiloh National Cemetery is in the northeast corner of the park adjacent to the visitor center and bookstore. Buried within its are 3,584 Union dead (of whom 2,357 are unknown), who were re-interred in the cemetery created after the war, in 1866. There are two Confederate dead interred in the cemetery. The cemetery operations were transferred from War Department to the National Park Service in 1933. An unknown number of Confederate dead are interred in mass graves in the park.
== Shiloh Indian Mounds Site ==

The Shiloh battlefield has within its boundaries the well preserved prehistoric Shiloh Indian Mounds Site, which is also a National Historic Landmark. The site was inhabited during the Early Mississippian period from about 1000 to 1450.

<doc id="881562" wikidata="Q2004825" url="?curid=881562" title="Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for Best Album">
<text>The Prize for Best Album (Prix du meilleur album), also known as the Fauve d&#x27;Or (&quot;Golden Wildcat&quot;), is awarded to comics authors at the Angoulême International Comics Festival.
As is the customary practice in Wikipedia for listing awards such as Oscar results, the winner of the award for that year is listed first, the others listed below are the nominees.

At the first two festivals (1974 and 1975), prizes were given only to creators, not books. From 1976 to 1978, the &quot;best work&quot; award was presented in four categories, foreign and French realistic and comical work. In 1981, the award was revived as simply &quot;best album.&quot; From 1986 to 2001 it was again divided into two awards, French and foreign comic, but since 2002 it has once again returned to a single &quot;best album&quot; category.

<text>Hornsea Pottery was a business located in the coastal town of Hornsea in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. They specialized in tableware with elegant contemporary designs.

The pottery was founded in 1949, in a small terraced house, by brothers Colin and Desmond Rawson with funding from local business man, Philip Clappison. The factory&#x27;s earliest pieces were mostly designed by Colin Rawson. The products sold well and the pottery moved to larger premises and took on its first employee in 1950.

Expansion of the business in the 1950s brought moves to larger sites in Hornsea. A second factory in Lancaster opened in 1974. In 1984, the company struggled and was bought out. Despite its difficulties, the factory continued to produce tableware and ornaments until April 2000 when it went into receivership.

As part of the asset sales during receivership the design rights to the successful Taunton range of table wares was acquired by Poole Pottery. The remainder of the designs, patterns and Intellectual Property rights were sold to Mainscore Ltd and are now owned by Hornsea Potteries Intellectual Properties USA LLC.

In 2008, Hornsea Museum opened a permanent exhibition of Hornsea Pottery.

The V &amp; A in London has numerous Hornsea Pottery items in its permanent collection.

==History==

===Early years===
In 1949, Desmond and Colin Rawson started a business making plaster of Paris models to sell as souvenirs to tourists who were visiting the seaside town of Hornsea. Both had attended the Batley College of Art but they had no pottery-making experience. They worked in the scullery of their kitchen at 4 Victoria Avenue in the town. Initial funding came from a friend and local business man, Philip Clappison. After the purchase of a small kiln, they started working with clay. Additional funding was received from Charles Wright, a retired Morecambe hotelier, whose son, Micheal Wright, was working with Desmond on early products. Desmond Rawson&#x27;s father-in-law, Henry Knowles, a solicitor in Morecambe, provided not only cash investment but all legal services for the rest of his life.

Their products sold well and by 1950 they took on their first employee and moved to larger premises at The Old Hall in the Hornsea Market Place. Robert (Bob) Hindle, Desmond&#x27;s brother-in-law, joined the company and provided additional share funding, and his &#x27;straight dealing&#x27; policy provided the company with an excellent sales directorship for over 20 years.

===Edenfield site===

In the mid-1950s, the Rawson brothers started to recognise the potential of Philip&#x27;s son, John Clappison, a student at Hull College of Art who produced the stylish, contemporary Elegance range of wares which are much in demand with collectors today. In 1954, the business moved to the site of the defunct Hornsea Brick and Tile Works. At this time the Pottery also employed other noted designers such as Dorothy Marion Campbell and Alan Luckham as modeller. In 1967, the factory started to produce full ranges of tableware, the first being the John Clappison-designed Heirloom, followed by his Saffron and Bronte patterns. In the 1970s, the Queensbury-Hunt partnership became involved in Hornsea tableware design, and their Contrast and Concept ranges proved popular. Though innovative, these products were not always practical in use. By 1974, the Edenfield Works employed 250 people and turned out three million pieces a year.

From the mid-1950s, the Hornsea Pottery business became more diverse. Tourist activities began with factory tours, then added more activities for families with children. These included a model village, birds of prey exhibition, car museum, a large adventure playground in the style of a wooden fort, remote control boats and go-karts. For adults, there were cafés, the Hornsea Pottery shop and factory tour and, towards the end of the factory&#x27;s lifetime, a number of shops which turned the site into an American-style outdoor factory outlet mall, selling clothing and other items at reduced prices.

===Lancaster site===

During the 1960s, Hornsea Pottery had become the biggest employer in the town and Hornsea Pottery had become so successful that the need for increased production called for expansion. Plans for further development at Hornsea were frustrated by local government objections, so locations outside the town were sought. A number of sites for the second factory were considered and Lancaster was chosen and the new &#x27;Pottery in a Garden&#x27; opened in 1974. Unfortunately, there were many teething problems and it took factory workers longer to train to the higher standards required for the newly introduced brown Vitramic body. Despite this shaky start the first three ranges produced at the Lancaster factory received Design Centre Awards and with them Hornsea Pottery enhanced its worldwide reputation. The Lancaster site only lasted for twelve years. Despite overcoming the early difficulties and its eventual profit making, it could not stand up against the economic climate of the time. It closed in 1988.

===Heyday===
Hornsea tablewares were sold worldwide for over 20 years and all tableware ranges were accepted for inclusion on the Design Centre Index before entering production. At one stage production of the Heirloom tableware soon could not keep up with the demand and department stores had to be limited on a quota basis.

===Decline===

In 1979 the number of employees rose to 460, and by 1981 it peaked at 700. However, this state of affairs did not last and after 1978 profits plummeted owing to development costs associated with its new factory in Lancaster, and production losses at its new plant. In 1980 a team from the National Westminster Bank was sent to review the company&#x27;s management and appoint a new managing director, Mr Anthony Kusmirek who joined the company in 1975 as project director. Noel Rawson the sales director and Anthony Kusmirek the new managing director were both dismissed after attempting to redress the company&#x27;s sales performance and improve the product range. In 1981 the National Westminster Bank then appointed Gordon Barker as managing director and nominated a new management team.

It was during this time that John Clappison’s unique Strata trinket boxes and his People series were produced. Clappison was made redundant on 31 December 1984, subsequently gaining employment with Royal Doulton. The ceramic tableware market was witnessing a great change with Japanese imports flooding the American market and cheaper tableware coming into Europe. The problems continued, and in April 2000 the National Westminster Bank sent in the receivers. The pottery factory no longer exists. The retail outlet shopping village known as Hornsea Freeport has traded on the main retail and touristic site ever since, whilst the old factory buildings have been demolished and the area re-developed for housing.

Following its dissolution, several of the redundant managers and staff were able to relocate to the newly constructed Park Rose Pottery, on a green field site situated on the main road entering the seaside town of Bridlington. Park Rose Pottery was founded by Anthony Kusmirek and Noel Rawson in 1982. The founder&#x27;s original giftware range consisted of vases, plant pot holders and ceramic lamp bases. One of their first customers was IKEA. They went on to produce and sell a successful range of designer ware in their own right. Park Rose Pottery itself ceased to trade in June 2012.
Hornsea Pottery designs are now available across a wide range of homewares, clothing and accessories via the official Hornsea Pottery website.

==Museum==
Over 2,000 pieces from the pottery&#x27;s beginnings in 1949 to 2000 are on display in two converted 18th century cottages in Hornsea Museum in Newbegin, the main street of Hornsea. Geoffrey Hindle, (Jolley Geoff); son of Bob Hindle, the driving force behind the very successful sales organisation; also nephew of Desmond Rawson, has spent many hours recording both of their life&#x27;s work, donated all the family&#x27;s pieces of pottery and many photographs to help the collection&#x27;s guardians Carol Harker and Museum founder Dr Stuart Walker tell the full story of the company&#x27;s success and eventual demise.

The Intellectual Properties of Hornsea Potteries including all the designs and trademarks were acquired at the time of receivership by Hornsea Potteries Intellectual Properties Ltd.

<text>T.O. Fuller State Park is a state park in the city of Memphis, Tennessee, USA. It consists of of mostly forest located in South Memphis on Mitchell Road. It is the only state park within the city limits and is suitable for wildlife.

The park is named in honor of Dr. Thomas O. Fuller, who spent his life empowering and educating African Americans. The park facilities were originally built for the use of African Americans in the Great Depression by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). It was the first state park in the United States east of the Mississippi River that was open to African Americans.

CCC camp number 1464-SP-10, which was composed of African Americans, initiated construction of the park facilities in 1938. During excavation for a proposed swimming pool in 1940, CCC workers unearthed evidence of a prehistoric village. The site has since been developed as Chucalissa Indian Village and includes a village, preserved archeological excavations and the C.H. Nash Museum at Chucalissa.

==Facilities==

Amenities at T.O. Fuller State Park include sheltered picnic areas, tennis courts, swimming pool, basketball courts, softball field, six miles (10 km) of hiking trails and camping facilities. The park&#x27;s nature center is open in the summer and features natural history exhibits and programs.

==C.H. Nash Museum at Chucalissa==

During construction of T.O. Fuller State Park in 1938, the CCC discovered Native American artifacts on the site, now known as Chucalissa. The University of Tennessee initiated archaeological excavations of this Mississippian mound complex in 1940, but this work was interrupted by World War II. Excavations and other work at Chucalissa began once again in 1955. The facility is currently operated by the University of Memphis and serves as a gateway for understanding archaeology and the interpretation of Native American history.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1994.

<doc id="881566" wikidata="Q295589" url="?curid=881566" title="Alessandro Baricco">
<text>Alessandro Baricco (; born 25 January 1958) is an Italian writer, director and performer. His novels have been translated into a number of languages.

== Early life, family and education==
Baricco was born in Turin, Italy.

He has earned degrees in philosophy (under Gianni Vattimo) and in piano.

==Career==

Baricco published essays on music criticism: &quot;Il genio in fuga&quot; (1988) on Gioachino Rossini, and &quot;L&#x27;anima di Hegel e le mucche del Wisconsin&quot; (&quot;Hegel&#x27;s Soul and the Cows of Wisconsin&quot;, 1992) on the relation between music and modernity. He subsequently worked as music critic for &quot;La Repubblica&quot; and &quot;La Stampa&quot;, and hosted talk shows on Rai Tre.

Baricco debuted as a novelist with &quot;Castelli di rabbia&quot; (translated as &quot;Lands of Glass&quot;) in 1991.

In 1993, he co-founded a creative writing school in Turin, naming it Scuola Holden after J. D. Salinger&#x27;s Holden Caulfield. The Scuola Holden hosts a variety of courses on narrative techniques including screenwriting, journalism, novels and short stories.

In the following years, his fame grew throughout Europe, with his works topping the Italian and French best-seller lists. Larger recognition followed the adaptation of his theatrical monologue &quot;Novecento&quot; into the movie &quot;The Legend of 1900&quot;, directed by Giuseppe Tornatore.

He has also worked with the French band Air, releasing &quot;City Reading&quot;, a mix of the band&#x27;s music with Baricco&#x27;s reading of his novel &quot;City&quot;.

Baricco directed the critically acclaimed film &quot;Lezione 21&quot; on Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Ninth Symphony&quot;.

==Personal life==
Baricco resides in his hometown, Turin. He has two sons. He and his girlfriend Gloria Campaner live together.

In January 2022, Baricco announced he had been diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.

<text>Chess notation systems are used to record either the moves made or the position of the pieces in a game of chess. Chess notation is used in chess literature, and by players keeping a record of an ongoing game. The earliest systems of notation used lengthy narratives to describe each move; these gradually evolved into more compact notation systems. Algebraic notation is now the accepted international standard, with several variants. Descriptive chess notation was used in English- and Spanish-language literature until the late 20th century, but is now obsolescent. Portable Game Notation (PGN) is a text file format based on English algebraic notation which can be processed by most chess software. Other notation systems include ICCF numeric notation, used for international correspondence chess, and systems for transmission using Morse code over telegraph or radio. The standard system for recording chess positions is Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN).

==Notation systems==

In organized competition, both players are required to keep a record of the moves played on a . If required, score sheets may be used to resolve disputes, for example about whether an illegal move has been made or whether a threefold repetition has occurred. In addition, if the time control requires the players to complete a specified number of moves in a specified time, an accurate count of the moves must be kept. All chess coaches strongly recommend the recording of one&#x27;s games so that one can look for improvements in one&#x27;s play.

* Algebraic notation is the most widely used method for recording moves. It is based on a system of coordinates (a–h for files, 1–8 for ranks) to uniquely identify each square. In embryonic form it was used by Philip Stamma in the 1737 book &quot;Essai sur le jeu des echecs&quot;. It was later adopted (in long form) by the influential &quot;Handbuch des Schachspiels&quot; and became standard in German publications. It is more compact and less prone to error than the English descriptive system. Algebraic notation is the official notation of FIDE; if a player records the game in a different notation system, their scoresheet may not be used as evidence in the event of a dispute. The U.S. Chess Federation prefers the use of algebraic notation but still permits descriptive notation.

:* &quot;Long algebraic notation&quot; includes the starting and of the piece.
:* &quot;Short algebraic notation&quot; omits the starting and of the piece, unless it is necessary to disambiguate the move.
:* &quot;Minimal algebraic notation&quot; is similar to short algebraic notation but omits the indicators for capture (&quot;x&quot;), en passant capture (&quot;e.p.&quot;), check (&quot;+&quot;) and checkmate (&quot;#&quot;). It was used by &quot;Chess Informant&quot;.
:* &quot;Figurine algebraic notation&quot; replaces the letter that stands for a piece by its symbol, e.g., ♞c6 instead of Nc6 or ♖xg4 instead of Rxg4. Pawns are omitted as in standard algebraic notation. This style is widely used in chess literature to allow the moves to be read independent of language. To display or print these symbols on a computer, one or more fonts with good Unicode support must be installed, and the document (web page, word processor document, etc.) must use one of these fonts. For more information see Chess symbols in Unicode.
:* &quot;Reversible algebraic notation&quot; is based on long algebraic notation, but adds an additional letter for the piece that was captured, if any. The move can be reversed by moving the piece to its original square, and restoring the captured piece. For example, Rd2xBd6.
:* &quot;Concise reversible algebraic notation&quot; is similar to reversible algebraic notation, but omits the file or rank if it is not needed to disambiguate the move. For example, Rd2xB6. This notation is recommended by Gene Milener in &quot;Play Stronger Chess by Examining Chess 960: Usable Strategies for Fischer Random Chess Discovered&quot;.
:* &quot;Figurine concise reversible algebraic notation&quot; is a form of concise reversible algebraic notation with non-Staunton figurines, used by Gene Milener during Chess960 tournaments.
*Descriptive notation was the prevalent notation in English-speaking countries until the late 1970s. In this system, files are named after the piece that is initially on the back rank, and each square has two names depending on whether it is from White&#x27;s or Black&#x27;s point of view. This is still used by a dwindling number of mainly older players, and knowledge of descriptive notation is necessary to study older chess books. Similar systems were used in other languages, including Spanish and French.
*ICCF numeric notation. In international correspondence chess the use of algebraic notation may cause confusion, since different languages have different names for the pieces. The standard for transmitting moves in this form of chess is ICCF numeric notation.
*Smith notation is a straightforward chess notation designed to be reversible and represent any move without ambiguity. The notation encodes the source square, destination square, and what piece was captured, if any.
* Coordinate notation is similar to algebraic notation except that no abbreviation or symbol is used to show which piece is moving. It can do this almost without ambiguity because it always includes the square from which the piece moves as well as its destination, but promotions must be disambiguated by including the promoted piece type, such as in parentheses. It has proved hard for humans to write and read, but is used internally by some chess-related computer software.

The following table lists examples of the same moves in some of the notations which may be used by humans. Each table cell contains White&#x27;s move followed by Black&#x27;s move, as they are listed in a single line of written notation.

In all forms of notation, the result is usually indicated at the conclusion of the game by either &quot;1–0&quot;, indicating that White won, &quot;0–1&quot; indicating that Black won or &quot;½–½&quot;, indicating a draw. Moves that result in checkmate can be marked with &quot;#&quot;, &quot;++&quot;, &quot;≠&quot;, or &quot;‡&quot; or to indicate the end of game and the winner, instead of or in addition to &quot;1–0&quot; or &quot;0–1&quot;.

Annotators commenting on a game frequently use question marks (&quot;?&quot;) and exclamation marks (&quot;!&quot;) to label a move as bad or praise the move as a good one (see Chess annotation symbols).

===Notation systems for computers===
The following are commonly used for chess-related computer systems (in addition to Coordinate and Smith notation, which are described above):
*Portable Game Notation (PGN). This is a text-based file format in which chess moves are recorded with standard English algebraic notation with a small amount of markup to record the players and circumstances of the game. Most chess software is configured to process PGN files.
*Steno-Chess. This is another format suitable for computer processing. It sacrifices the ability to play through games (by a human) for conciseness, which minimises the number of characters required to store a game. 
*Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN). A single line format which gives the current positions of pieces on a board, to enable generation of a board in something other than the initial array of pieces. It also contains other information such as castling rights, move number, and color on move. It is incorporated into the PGN standard as a Tag Pair in conjunction with the SetUp tag.
*Extended Position Description (EPD). Another format which gives the current positions of a board, with an extended set of structured attribute values using the ASCII character set. It is intended for data and command interchange among chess playing programs. It is also intended for the representation of portable opening library repositories. It is better than FEN for certain chess variants, such as Chess960.

===Notation for telegraph and radio===
Some special methods of notation were used for transmitting moves by telegraph or radio, usually using Morse Code. The Uedemann code and Gringmuth notation worked by using a two-letter label for each square and transmitting four letters – two letters for the origin square followed by two letters for the destination square. Castling is shown as a king move. Squares are designated from White&#x27;s side of the board, files from left to right and ranks from nearest to farthest. The Rutherford code first converted the move into a number and then converted the move number into a composite Latin word. It could also transmit moves of two games at the same time.
====Uedemann code====
This code was devised by Louis Uedemann (1854–1912). The method was never actually used, mainly because a transposition of letters can result in a valid but incorrect move. Many sources incorrectly use this name for the Gringmuth code.

The files are labeled &quot;A&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, and &quot;A&quot;. The ranks are labeled &quot;B&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, and &quot;P&quot;. A square on the is designated by its file letter and then its rank letter. A square on the is designated by its rank letter then its file letter.

==== Gringmuth notation ====
This method was invented by Dmitry Alexeyevich Gringmuth but it is sometimes incorrectly called the Uedemann Code. It was used as early as 1866. Files were designated with one of two letters, depending on whether it was on White&#x27;s side or Black&#x27;s side. These letters were: files &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, &#x27;D&#x27;, &#x27;F&#x27;, &#x27;G&#x27;, &#x27;H&#x27;, &#x27;K&#x27;, and &#x27;L&#x27; for White-side ranks &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;E&#x27;, &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;O&#x27;, corresponding to algebraic files &#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, ... &#x27;h&#x27;, and ranks 1, 2, 3, 4; the aligned Black-side ranks were &#x27;M&#x27;, &#x27;N&#x27;, &#x27;P&#x27;, &#x27;R&#x27;, &#x27;S&#x27;, &#x27;T&#x27;, &#x27;W&#x27;, and &#x27;Z&#x27;, corresponding to algebraic &#x27;a&#x27; ... &#x27;h&#x27;, used for Gringmuth ranks &#x27;O&#x27;, &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;E&#x27;, and &#x27;A&#x27; corresponding to algebraic ranks 5, 6, 7, 8. Hence square &#x27;a1&#x27; in algebraic notation is Gringmuth &#x27;BA&#x27;, and its diagonal opposite &#x27;h8&#x27; is Gringmuth &#x27;ZA&#x27;. A king&#x27;s pawn opening &#x27;e2e4&#x27; in algebraic would be &#x27;GEGO&#x27; in Gringmuth, with a mirrored response by black &#x27;e7e5&#x27; notated as &#x27;SESO&#x27;.

====Rutherford code====
This code was invented in 1880 by Sir William Watson Rutherford (1853–1927). At the time, the British Post Office did not allow digits or ciphers in telegrams, but they did allow Latin words. This method also allowed moves for two games to be transmitted at the same time. In this method, the legal moves in the position were counted using a system until the move being made was reached. This was done for both games. The move number of the first game was multiplied by 60 and added to the move number of the second game. Leading zeros were added as necessary to give a four-digit number. The first two digits would be 00 through 39, which corresponded to a table of 40 Latin roots. The third digit corresponded to a list of 10 Latin prefixes and the last digit corresponded to a list of 10 Latin suffixes. The resulting word was transmitted.

After rules were changed so that ciphers were allowed in telegrams, this system was replaced by the Gringmuth Notation.

==Recording positions==
Positions are usually shown as diagrams (images), using the symbols shown here for the pieces.

There is also a notation for recording positions in text format, called the Forsyth–Edwards notation (FEN). This is useful for adjourning a game to resume later or for conveying chess problem positions without a diagram. A position can also be recorded by listing the pieces and the squares they reside on, for example: White: Ke1, Rd3, etc.

Written chess notation recording is often necessary when participating in chess tournaments. In many tournaments players are required to record their games&#x27; notation on a score sheet.

==Endgame classification==
There are also systems for classifying types of endgames. See for more details.
==History==

The notation for chess moves evolved slowly, as these examples show. The last is in algebraic chess notation; the others show the evolution of descriptive chess notation and use spelling and notation of the period.
: The white king commands his owne knight into the third house before his owne bishop.

: K. knight to His Bishop&#x27;s 3d.

: K.Kt. to B.third sq.

: K.Kt. to B&#x27;s 3rd.

: K. Kt. to B. 3d.

: K Kt to B3

: KKt-B3

: Kt-KB3

: N-KB3

: Nf3

A text from Shakespeare&#x27;s time uses complete sentences to describe moves, for example, &quot;Then the black king for his second draught brings forth his queene, and placest her in the third house, in front of his bishop&#x27;s pawne&quot;, which nowadays would be written simply as 2...Qf6. The great 18th-century player Philidor used an almost equally verbose approach in his influential book &quot;Analyse du jeu des Échecs&quot;, for example, &quot;The king&#x27;s bishop, at his queen bishop&#x27;s fourth square.&quot;

Algebraic chess notation was first used by Philipp Stamma () in an almost fully developed form, before the now-obsolete descriptive chess notation evolved. The main difference between Stamma&#x27;s system and the modern system is that Stamma used &quot;p&quot; for pawn moves and the original of the piece (&quot;a&quot; through &quot;h&quot;) instead of the initial letter of the piece.
In London in 1747, Philidor convincingly defeated Stamma in a match. Consequently, his writings (which were translated into English) became more influential than Stamma&#x27;s in the English-speaking chess world; this may have led to the adoption of a descriptive system for writing chess moves, rather than Stamma&#x27;s coordinate-based approach. However, algebraic notation became popular in Europe following its adoption by the highly influential &quot;Handbuch des Schachspiels&quot;, and became dominant in Europe during the 20th century. It did not become popular in the English-speaking countries, however, until the 1970s.

<text>This Prize Awarded by the Audience - Cultura is awarded to comics authors at the Angoulême International Comics Festival since 1989.

The prize was known as Alph-Art du public from 1989 to 2003, the Prix du public from 2004 to 2006, in 2008 and 2009 the Essentiel FNAC-SNCF, since it was sponsored by the retailer Fnac and railway authority SNCF, in 2010 and 2010 the Fauve Fnac SNCF - Prix du Public and in 2012 Prix de la BD Fnac. At the end of 2018, the prize is &quot;interrupted&quot; because of the lack of sponsor.

<text>The Leipzig Trade Fair () is a major trade fair, which traces its roots back for nearly a millennium. After the Second World War, Leipzig fell within the territory of East Germany, whereupon the Leipzig Trade Fair became one of the most important trade fairs of Comecon and was traditionally a meeting place for businessmen and politicians from both sides of the Iron Curtain. Since 1996, the fair has taken place on the Leipzig fairgrounds, located about north of the city centre.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The history of the Leipzig fairs goes back to the Middle Ages. A fair held at Leipzig is first mentioned in 1165. Otto the Rich, Margrave of Meissen presented the Leipzig fairs under protection. No other fair was allowed within a circle of a mile (7.5 km) away (Bannmeile).

In 1268, Margrave Theodoric of Landsberg assured all merchants travelers to Leipzig full protection for person and goods, even if their sovereign was at feud with him. This led to the settlement of numerous merchants in Leipzig. Trade goods now included herring, cloth, wine, and pepper.

=== 15th century to 18th century ===
Two annual fairs established in Leipzig, at Jubilate (third sunday after Easter) and Michaelis (29th of September). Frederick II of Saxony imparted in 1458 the privilege for a third fair in Leipzig, the New Year&#x27;s Fair. German emperor Frederick III confirmed this fair in 1466 and 1469 by imperial privileges. That made the Leipzig merchant bourgeoisie grewing up.

In 1497, Maximilian I (from 1508 Emperor) confirmed all three Leipzig fairs (New Year, Jubilate, Michaelis) again and provided his seigneurial protection, including a ban of establishing more fairs in the neighboring dioceses of Magdeburg, Halberstadt, Meissen, Merseburg and Naumburg.

In 1507 Maximilian I banned any fairs within a 15-mile radius around Leipzig, which further increased the marketplace importance. The privilege also confirmed the staple right and extended the protection for the merchants on their way to the Leipzig fairs. Towns like Halle, Naumburg, Erfurt, and Magdeburg were now disadvantaged as marketplaces.

In 1523, the Augsburg merchant family Welser built a big house with shops at the Markt 8 (today&#x27;s Barthels Hof), the rival Fuggers had factories as well.

In 1678–87, an exchange was built (Alte Handelsbörse, Naschmarkt, destroyed in 1943, rebuilt).

In the 18th century, Leipzig became the centre for trade with Russian, Polish and English goods. It was called &#x27;the marketplace of all Europe&#x27;.

=== Modern era ===
The importance of the fair, which drew merchants from across Europe, was the impetus for the construction of one of Europe&#x27;s most significant Moorish Revival buildings, the 1855 Leipzig synagogue by architect Otto Simonson.

In 1895, the first commercial sample fair was held in Leipzig, dominated by exhibitors presenting samples of their goods. Between 1893 and 1938 a number of fair-houses (Messe-Häuser) were built in the center of Leipzig. They normally contained several interconnected courtyards with shops, storage areas, and living space (Mädlerpassage, Petershof, Handelshof, Specks Hof, Drei Könige etc.) Leipzig became the main German fair for books and consumer goods. The fair&#x27;s MM symbol was designed by Erich Gruner in 1917.

In 1920 the technical fairground was opened in the southeast of the town, between Reudnitz and the Monument to the Battle of the Nations. It included 19 pavilions in 1940. Today this site is called Alte Messe Leipzig.

In 1937, Leipzig was renamed Reichsmessestadt Leipzig (Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig) by the Nazis.

Between the wars, the Ring-Messehaus and the Messehaus Bugra were built. During World War II, the area of the technical fair was used for military production and partly destroyed by bombs.

In 1946, the first postwar fair (&#x27;Peace fair&#x27;) took place. When the GDR joined the RGW (Comecon) in 1950, the fair was used to present the production of East Germany&#x27;s Warsaw Pact neighbours - not only to each other, but also to nations of the capitalist West. The technical fairground was rebuilt and contained more than 20 pavilions.

The fair played an important role in Cold War diplomacy between East Germany and the Western states, as it facilitated delegations from numerous major NATO powers, including the United States and United Kingdom. The Leipzig Trade Fair, during the period 1949 to 1989, served both propagandistic and economic functions in its attempts to organise visits from Western nations. Trade was instrumental to the SED&#x27;s plans for East German recognition, with increased trade relations between the GDR and Westerners believed to be the key to Western governments re-evaluating East Germany&#x27;s international status as a mere occupation zone the Soviets were yet to leave. British delegations, often from the UK Labour Party and associated groups, were frequent during the late 1950s and early 1960s and included a variety of prominent politicians, including Anthony Greenwood, Ian Mikardo, and Clement Davies: many of those who attended would go on to campaign for official recognition of the German Democratic Republic until the early 1970s.

The fair also played an important role in international politics during the crisis over the erection of the Berlin Wall. In August 1961, Willy Brandt (then Mayor of Berlin) called for an international boycott of the fair and a host of other East German functions in response to the Wall going up, which illustrates how the Leipzig Trade Fair was of great importance to the Cold War struggles over the legitimacy and recognition of the East German state.

==The Leipzig Fair today==
In 1996, a new trade fair ground was opened. The Congress Center Leipzig was also opened, built after designs by Gerkan, Marg and Partners. The old trade fair ground is used for shops, events, supermarkets, and figure skating events, although many areas are empty and unused. Today, the most important fairs are the Leipziger Buchmesse, PaintExpo and the Auto Mobil International.

==General facts==

The new Leipzig Trade Fair was built between 1995 and April 1996. The new fairground consists of six halls: five exhibition halls, which have a size of , and the world&#x27;s largest levitated glass hall, designed by Ian Ritchie Architects. The fairground has about 14,000 parking spaces and is accessible by tram, train, bus, or car.

==Company facts==

It is owned equally by Saxony and the city of Leipzig. 
The firm employs about 400 people, working in the parent company CCL and its subsidiaries.

<text>Douglas Coy Byng (17 March 1893 – 24 August 1987) was an English comic singer and songwriter in West End theatre, revue and cabaret. Billed as &quot;Bawdy but British&quot;, Byng was famous for his female impersonations. His songs are full of sexual innuendo and double entendres. Due to the prejudices of the law and of the public at that time, Byng was a closeted gay performer. To have been out, would have been social and professional suicide. He was noted for his camp performances in the music halls and in cabaret. Byng made a large number of recordings, many of which have been transferred to CD. Byng was also a noted pantomime dame and appeared in over 30 pantomimes.

==Early life==
Byng was born on 17 March 1893 in Basford, Nottinghamshire. His father was a bank manager and his mother (whose maiden name was Coy) was a former school teacher. They did not encourage his early theatrical leanings, and when he was ten, they sent him to live in Germany with his elder brother, who owned a lace factory there. Byng studied music and German, but following the trade of his brother he concentrated on fashion. After his return to Britain, he worked for the costume designer Charles Alias in London.

In 1914 Byng answered an advertisement for a light comedian for a seaside concert party and made his first appearance on stage at Hastings. At the age of 21, playing a middle-aged diplomat, he toured more than a hundred towns in the musical comedy &quot;The Girl in the Taxi&quot;. He continued his theatre work throughout the war, playing character parts in touring comedies and eventually achieving a juvenile lead in 1920.

==Between the wars==
In the 1920s he took to pantomime, playing the Grand Vizier in &quot;Aladdin&quot; at the London Palladium in 1921, and in 1924 creating the first of his many pantomime dames as Eliza in &quot;Dick Whittington and His Cat&quot; at the New Theatre Oxford. In 1925 Byng appeared at the London Pavilion in C. B. Cochran&#x27;s revue &quot;On with the Dance&quot;, written by Noël Coward. Byng remained with Cochran for five years in a succession of revues. During this period he opened his own nightclub, The Kinde Dragon, off St Martin&#x27;s Lane in central London, where he first performed the cabaret drag songs for which he is best remembered, described by the critic Sheridan Morley as &quot;a curious mixture of sophistication, schoolboy humour and double entendre.&quot; An example is his &quot;Mexican Minnie&quot;:
:Come where the heat from the sun&#x27;s burning rays&lt;br&gt;Gets you so gaga you tear off your stays!&lt;br&gt;I&#x27;m Mexican Minnie, all jolly and ginny&lt;br&gt;I loll in the mountains all day.&lt;br&gt;Though I&#x27;m well off the map, I&#x27;m just covered in slap,&lt;br&gt;Luring brigands to come and play ha&#x27;penny nap.&lt;br&gt;But they get very reckless, and will stay to breakfast&lt;br&gt;Then go off refusing to pay.&lt;br&gt;I say, &quot;Well you &quot;can&quot; go,&lt;br&gt;&quot;I&#x27;m sick of the gang, so&lt;br&gt;&quot;You shan&#x27;t see my tango today!&quot;

Byng&#x27;s skill in performance was said to vanquish prudery, but in reality his material was never crude. His famous numbers included: &quot;Sex Appeal Sarah&quot;, &quot;Milly the Messy Old Mermaid&quot; and &quot;The Lass who Leaned against the Tower of Pisa&quot;. His &quot;Doris, the Goddess of Wind&quot; was revived in Alan Bennett&#x27;s 2010 play &quot;The Habit of Art&quot;. He continually tested the patience of the BBC in debating which of his double entendres he would be allowed to speak or sing. He claimed that the rudest joke that he was allowed - because it was not understood - was one in which Nell Gwynne said to King Charles, who enjoyed dancing: &quot;If you must dance, stick the maypole up yourself and dance around it.&quot;

In 1931 Byng appeared in cabaret at the Club Lido, in New York, and had a great success. He pursued his career of revue, cabaret and pantomime in London throughout the 1930s, and was the first cabaret artiste to have his name in neon lights in the West End. By the 1930s, Byng&#x27;s recordings of songs like &quot;I&#x27;m Millie, a Messy Old Mermaid&quot;, sold well. In the Cole Porter revue &quot;Hi Diddle Diddle&quot; (1934), he was also the first to sing the celebrated song &quot;Miss Otis Regrets&quot;. In 1938 he played his favourite role in a musical, Prince Zorpan, in an adaptation of Emmerich Kálmán&#x27;s &quot;Maritza&quot;. Byng wrote all his own words for the piece and also some extra music. In one scene he impersonated a lady violinist, singing &quot;I&#x27;m the pest of Budapest that turned the Danube so blue&quot; in which &quot;The Times&quot; said he shone intensely.
During the Second World War, Byng was busy in musicals and variety, as well as cabaret and entertaining the troops. Afterwards he appeared in more comedies and farces, the best remembered being Georges Feydeau&#x27;s &quot;Hotel Paradiso&quot; in 1956 with Alec Guinness at the Winter Garden Theatre in London, reprised in a 1966 film version in which he also appeared. He also turned up sporadically on television, notably in Alan Melville&#x27;s series &quot;Before the Fringe&quot; in the 1960s when he sang, or rather recited, some of the old revue songs.

==Later years==
Byng never really retired from the stage and was working in his late eighties. His career was revived when he made a guest appearance on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Parkinson&quot; show in 1977 with Carol Channing.

In the last years of his life he briefly teamed up with another veteran variety artiste, Billy Milton, in the touring revue &quot;Those Thirties Memories&quot;, directed by Patrick Newley. He made his last appearance in 1987 in a one-man show at the National Theatre in London at the age of 93. He also wrote an autobiography, &quot;As You Were&quot; (1970). He features prominently in Patrick Newley&#x27;s autobiographical memoir &quot;The Krays and Bette Davis&quot; (2005).

Byng finally moved to Denville Hall, the Actors&#x27; Charitable Trust home in Northwood, Middlesex, England. He composed his own epitaph:
:So here you are, old Douglas, a derelict at last.&lt;br&gt;Before your eyes what visions rise of your vermilion past.&lt;br&gt;Mad revelry beneath the stars, hot clasping by the lake.&lt;br&gt;You need not sigh, you can&#x27;t deny, you&#x27;ve had your bit of cake.

He died on 24 August 1987 aged 94. His ashes were scattered outside his former home in Arundel Terrace, Brighton. A Brighton bus is named after him.

<text>The Bay of All Saints (), also known as All Saints&#x27; Bay and Todos os Santos Bay, is the principal bay of the Brazilian state of Bahia, to which it gave its name. It sits on the eastern coast of Brazil, surrounding part of Bahia&#x27;s capital Salvador and opening to the Atlantic Ocean. It covers , making it the largest bay in Brazil.

Farol da Barra (Barra Lighthouse), on the site of a historic fort, stands at the entrance of the bay. The Bay of All Saints is shallow along much of its area with an average depth of . The Paraguaçu River travels to empty into the bay and the coastal lowlands of the Reconcavo Basin are at its mouth. It contains 91 islands, the largest being Itaparica Island at its entrance. Other important islands include the Ilha dos Frades, ilha de Maré, ilha de Bom Jesus, and the small Ilha do Medo.

== History ==
The Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci was the first European to visit the bay, during his second expedition to the Americas. He entered the bay on All Saints&#x27; Day (November 1), 1501. He named the of after the date and his parish church in Florence, San Salvatore di Ognissanti. Initially, the bay, its principal settlement, and the captaincy around it all shared the same name, but they were eventually distinguished, the state becoming simply Bahia, the bay becoming the Bay of All Saints, and the city becoming first Bahia and now (usually) Salvador.

In 1501, one year after the arrival of Pedro Álvares Cabral&#x27;s fleet in Porto Seguro, Gaspar de Lemos arrived at the Bay of All Saints and sailed most of the Bahia coast. The first European to disembark in Morro de São Paulo was Martim Afonso de Sousa in 1531, while he was leading an expedition charged with exploring the coast of the new continent.

Salvador was a major slave port for the sugarcane fields of Brazil by the early 18th century. In the whaling days, it was also a popular spot, since the bay was a mating ground for whales.

The northeast shore of the Bay of All Saints is home to Brazil&#x27;s first active oil fields. The municipality of São Francisco do Conde, at the north of the bay, remains a port that serves the oil refineries at Mataripe. The bay is dredged from the port to the Atlantic Ocean to remain open to shipping.

<text>The Xbox network, formerly known and commonly referred to as Xbox Live, is an online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery service created and operated by Microsoft Gaming for the Xbox brand. It was first made available to the original Xbox console on November 15, 2002. An updated version of the service, adding the Xbox Live Marketplace, became available with the Xbox 360 console launch in November 2005, and a further enhanced version was released in 2013 with the Xbox One. The service is used on the latest Xbox Series X and Series S and, in addition to a Microsoft account, is the account for Xbox ecosystem; accounts can store games and other content.

The service was extended in 2007 across the Windows platform, named Games for Windows – Live, now defunct, which made most aspects of the system available on Windows computers. The Microsoft Store and Xbox app are now used to cross over the Xbox ecosystem into PC gaming, in addition to handhelds and mobile phones as part of the Play Anywhere initiative. Microsoft&#x27;s former mobile operating system, Windows Phone, included full Xbox Live functionality until it was discontinued. The service shut down for the original Xbox on April 15, 2010, and original Xbox Games are now only playable online through Insignia, an unofficial Xbox Live replacement service, or through local area network (LAN) tunneling applications.

Xbox network service is available as both a free service and a subscription-based service known as &quot;Xbox Game Pass Core&quot;. In 2021, Microsoft renamed Xbox Live as simply the &quot;Xbox network&quot; to cover all of its services related to Xbox, and began slowly phasing out all &quot;Live&quot; branding until it was fully removed in 2023.

&#x27;*&#x27; = Country where Xbox network and Store are officially available, but the Store is in Global currency USD, not in local currency.

Users from other countries are not officially supported, although it is possible for them to access Xbox network if they provide an address located in a country where Xbox network is officially available. The country selected during account creation affects the payment options, content, and services available to the user. Previously, users were unable to change their account region, but in October 2012, Microsoft introduced an account migration tool as a pilot project, which allows the user to change their region and maintain their Xbox network profile. Subscriptions, such as that for Xbox Music, cannot be transferred with this method.

On May 18, 2011, Microsoft announced that it planned to launch Xbox network in the Middle East within the next twelve months, but it never occurred during that time period. However, on October 20, 2012, Microsoft officially announced the service will be launching in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in three days time.
On November 4, Microsoft announced that the service would be launched on November 29 in Argentina and Israel. The service also appeared in the following month in Slovakia and Turkey. The service was launched in China without Game Pass in late 2014.

On March 5, 2022, the Xbox team announced that it suspended all Xbox network services in Russia in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==History==
===Launch with the original Xbox===

As Microsoft developed the original Xbox console, online gaming was designated as one of the key pillars for the greater Xbox strategy. Sega had made an attempt to capitalize on the ever-growing online gaming scene when it launched the Dreamcast video game console in 1999, including online support as standard, with the SegaNet service in North America and Dreamarena in Europe. Nevertheless, due to lack of widespread broadband adoption at the time, the Dreamcast shipped with only a dial-up modem while a later-released broadband adapter was neither widely supported nor widely available. Downloadable content was available, though limited in size due to the narrowband connection and the size limitations of a memory card. The PlayStation 2 did not initially ship with built-in networking capabilities.

Microsoft, however, hoped that the Xbox would succeed where the Dreamcast had failed. The company determined that intense online gaming required the throughput of a broadband connection and the storage space of a hard disk drive, and thus these features would be vital to the new platform. This would allow not only for significant downloadable content, such as new levels, maps, weapons, challenges and characters, to be downloaded quickly and stored, but also would make it possible to standardize bandwidth intensive features such as voice communication. Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates both had a vision of making premium download content and add-ons that would attract many new customers. Based on this reasoning, the console included a standard Ethernet port (10/100) in order to provide connectivity to common broadband networks, but did not include a modem or any dial-up support, and its online service was designed to support broadband users only. Critics scoffed at it, citing poor broadband adoption at the turn of the century.

When the Xbox launched on November 15, 2001, the as-yet unnamed online service was destined for a Summer 2002 deployment. Xbox Live was finally given a name at E3 2002 when the service was unveiled in its entirety. Sound-dampened booths and broadband-connected Xbox consoles—featuring an early version of &quot;Unreal Championship&quot;—demonstrated the service on the show floor. The Epic title was one of the flagship titles for the service, which was slated for a debut on November 15, 2002, marking the anniversary of the Xbox launch. Microsoft announced that 50 Xbox Live titles would be available by the end of 2003. Utilizing the required broadband bandwidth, Xbox Live featured a unified gaming &quot;Friends List&quot;, as well as a single identity across all titles (regardless of the publisher), and standardized voice chat with a headset and communication, a feature that was still in its infancy.

Leading up to the launch, Microsoft enlisted several waves of beta testers to improve the service and receive feature feedback. The first wave of beta testers were given &quot;Re-Volt!&quot; (which was never released officially) and &quot;NFL Fever 2003&quot; to beta test. Once beta testing concluded, Microsoft sent these beta testers a translucent orange memory card, a headset carrying case, and a beta tester t-shirt with the slogan &quot;I&#x27;ve got great hands&quot;. When the service debuted, it lacked much of the functionality that later titles included, but Xbox Live grew and evolved on the Xbox and many aspects of the service were included with the Xbox 360 console out of the box, rather than through a later update. Microsoft granted Live-related patent that gives Xbox 360 users access to watch other gamers compete against each other over Xbox Live.

The packaging for playable Xbox Live titles on the original Xbox console featured a trademark luminescent orange-gold bar underneath the Xbox header. &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell&quot; and &quot;Brute Force&quot; sported a Live &quot;bubble&quot; design, as they only featured downloadable content. It was changed later, wherein all Xbox Live titles included the universal orange-gold Live bar. By the time of the Xbox 360, all titles were required to provide at least a limited form of Xbox Live &quot;awareness&quot;. In July 2004, Xbox Live had reached 1 million online users. In July 2005, Xbox Live had reached 2 million online users.

===Subsequent growth===

On November 15, 2007, Microsoft celebrated Xbox Live&#x27;s 5th anniversary by offering its then over 8 million subscribers the title &quot;Carcassonne&quot; free of charge and awarding gamers who had subscribed to Live since its inception 500 free Microsoft Points. Due to intermittent service interruptions during late December 2007 and early January 2008, Microsoft promised to offer a free Xbox Live Arcade game to all Xbox Live users as compensation, in an open letter to all Xbox Live members from Marc Whitten, Xbox LIVE General Manager. Increased demand from Xbox 360 purchasers (the largest number of new user sign-ups in the history of Xbox Live) was given as the reason for the downtime. On January 18, 2008, Microsoft announced &quot;Undertow&quot; would be offered free to both Gold and Free members for the week starting January 23 through January 27 as compensation.

On November 12, 2009, Dennis Durkin, COO of Microsoft&#x27;s interactive entertainment business, announced that November 10, 2009, the release of &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot; marked the busiest day ever on Xbox Live, with over two million active users simultaneously.

On February 5, 2010, Marc Whitten announced that Xbox Live had reached 23 million members. On the same day, Larry Hyrb, Xbox Live&#x27;s Major Nelson, announced on his blog that Xbox Live support for the original Xbox would be discontinued on April 15, 2010, including online play through backwards compatibility on the Xbox 360 and all downloadable content for original Xbox games.

In August 2010, Microsoft announced an increase to the cost of Xbox Live Gold in several countries by 20%, for the first time since its inception. The basic service was also renamed. Prior to October 2010, the free service was known as &quot;Xbox Live Silver&quot;.

It was announced on June 10, 2011, that the service is going to be fully integrated into Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 8.

In October 2011, Microsoft announced live streaming cable television with various providers.
In February 2013, Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of Microsoft&#x27;s Interactive Entertainment Business, shared that Xbox Live members now number 46 million, up 15 percent from a year ago, during the Dive into Media conference in Southern California.

In June 2014, Microsoft retracted the Xbox Live Gold requirements to access streaming media apps (including Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Internet Explorer, Skype, and others), though various rental or subscription fees may still apply.

On December 25, 2014, both PlayStation Network and Xbox Live suffered network disruption after a denial-of-service attack. Functionality was restored on December 28, with some users experiencing difficulties in the days that followed. A group called, &quot;The Phantom Squad&quot; has threatened to disrupt the Xbox Live network through a denial-of-service attack on December 25, 2015.

In 2019, the Official Xbox Magazine revealed that Xbox Live would be made cross platform, and will serve Android, iOS and Nintendo Switch.

Microsoft added Xbox Live Gold to its Xbox Game Pass program as part of a new Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription tier in April 2019.

===Rebranding===
On January 22, 2021, Microsoft planned to increase the prices for the Xbox Live Gold subscriptions, as follows: by $1 for the monthly subscription ($10.99 from $9.99), by $5 for the 3-month subscription ($29.99 from $24.99), by $20 for the 6-month subscription ($59.99 from $39.99), and by $60 (double the price) for the 12-month subscription ($119.99 from $59.99). However, the 6-month and 12-month subscription price increases would not affect existing subscribers when they resubscribed at the same level, nor those already subscribed through the Xbox Games Pass Ultimate program. However, after complaints from the Xbox community, Microsoft made an announcement on the same day that they revoked their decision, and that they would not increase the prices of any of the subscriptions, thus they would remain the same as they were.

Microsoft officially announced that they would be branding Xbox Live as &quot;Xbox network&quot; in March 2021 as to cover all the services related to Xbox and not just Xbox Live. Xbox Live Gold would remain the same name and to distinguish the subscription program from the set of services. Microsoft also stated that with this, it will eliminate the requirement to have Xbox Live Gold to play free-to-play games on Xbox consoles.

By January 2021, Microsoft reported that there were more than 100 million Xbox users (including those through the Xbox Game Pass subscription).

==User information==
===Gamertag===
A gamertag is the universal name for a player&#x27;s username on the Xbox network. A gamertag is a unique identifier, and can include numbers, letters, and spaces. Gamertags can be changed using an Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, or Xbox 360 console (first time is free, all other changes afterwards are charged), while the Xbox 360 supports eight Xbox network-enabled profiles per memory unit and thirty-two profiles on the hard drive.

A player&#x27;s Gamertag account status can be checked using a variety of online tools, which is useful especially when looking for a new gamertag, or confirming that a gamertag exists. Using a valid gamertag, any player can be found and messaged from within the network. There are also several websites which allow users of gamertags to upload photos and information about themselves.
Gamertags also contain avatar images (or &quot;gamer pictures&quot;), with the stock images sometimes associated with certain games or game characters. On Xbox 360, individual gamerpics are available, but they are usually bundled into packs. It is also possible to take &quot;Public&quot; pictures (which are shown to all that view a profile, unless the user has a different &quot;personal&quot; picture set) which can be taken of avatars while using the avatar editor. On Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, players are able to upload custom images of their choice through the Xbox app, subject to Xbox approval.

Users were formerly forbidden to use strings such as gay or refer to homosexuality in any way in their gamertag or profile due to it being considered &quot;content of a sexual nature&quot;, even if the string occurs in a legitimate surname. Incidents where a woman was suspended from the service for identifying herself as a lesbian, and an incident where a male user was suspended for using his surname &quot;Gaywood&quot; in his username attracted controversy. In February 2009, Xbox Live Lead Program Manager for Enforcement Stephen Toulouse clarified the service&#x27;s policy on sexual identification, stating that &quot;Expression of any sexual orientation [...] is not allowed in Gamertags&quot; but that the company is &quot;examining how we can provide it in a way that won&#x27;t get misused&quot;. Changes announced in March 2010 permit Xbox Live members to express sexual orientation in their gamertags and profiles.

===Gamerscore===
The Gamerscore (G) is an achievements point accumulation system that reflects the number of achievements accumulated by a user on Xbox through the displaying of the number of points accumulated. These Achievement points are awarded for the completion of game-specific challenges, such as beating a level or amassing a specified number of wins against other players in online matches and other various in game challenges.

Initially, retail Xbox 360 games offered up to 1,000G spread over a variable number of Achievements, while each Xbox Live Arcade title contained 12 Achievements totaling 200G. On February 1, 2007, Microsoft announced on their Gamerscore Blog some new policies that developers must follow related to Gamerscore and Achievements in future releases. All regular disc-based games must have 1,000 Gamerscore points in the base game; the title can ship with fewer than 1,000 points, but anything added later must be free. Game developers also now have the option of adding up to 250 points via downloadable content every quarter after the first year of release (for a total of 1,750 points). Xbox Live Arcade titles also allowed players to obtain Gamerscore, initially up to 200 Gamerscore with additional points up to 50 Gamerscore via downloadable content (for a total of 250 points), but some XBLA games now contain up to 400 Gamerscore without DLC.

On March 25, 2008, Microsoft cracked down on &quot;Gamerscore cheaters&quot; (those who used external tools to artificially inflate their Gamerscore), and reduced their Gamerscores to zero without the option to recover the scores that had been &quot;earned&quot;, and branded the player by denoting on their Gamertag that they were a &quot;Cheater&quot;.

The development of the Gamerscore system had created a new niche in the internet economy. Many websites have been created to provide gamers with tips and tricks for getting achievement points. Some sites are solely devoted to these achievement guides, and some blogs provide gaming guides in addition to their other content.

On March 13, 2014, Ray Cox IV or &quot;Stallion83&quot; became the first player in history to reach 1 million Gamerscore.

===Gamecard===
The Gamecard is an information panel used to summarize one&#x27;s user profile on Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox network. The pieces of information on a Gamercard include:
* Gamertag 
* Gamer picture (avatar)
* Reputation (only shown on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S if the viewed player is constantly violating the Community Standards)
* Tenure (How many years you have been subscribed to Xbox Game Pass Core or Ultimate) 
* Gamerscore
* Gamer Zone (Xbox 360 only)
* Recent games played

A player&#x27;s Gamercard can be viewed via the guide, the Xbox app, or online through Xbox.com.

Similarly, Mac OS X users were able to download widgets that display their Xbox Live Gamercard within Mac OS X&#x27;s Dashboard. These can be downloaded onto any Mac with OS X 10.4 or higher via Apple&#x27;s widget download page.

On Xbox 360, there were four Gamer Zones; &quot;Recreation&quot; is for casual gamers, &quot;Family&quot; is for family-friendly gamers (without profanity, etc.), &quot;Pro&quot; is for competitive gamers who enjoy a challenge, and &quot;Underground&quot; is for no-holds-barred gaming where anything goes (as long as it does not violate the Xbox Live Terms of Use). However, in practice these gamer zones were displayed only on the Gamercard of the player, and did not tend to affect the gameplay experience or the matching of players in online games.

===TrueSkill===

TrueSkill is a ranking and matchmaking system which was first implemented as part of the Xbox 360&#x27;s &quot;Live&quot; service. Developed at Microsoft Research Cambridge (United Kingdom), the TrueSkill ranking system is now used in over 150 titles for the Xbox 360 and was used in the Games for Windows – Live game &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II&quot;. It uses a mathematical model of uncertainty to address weaknesses in existing ranking systems such as Elo. For example, a new player joining million-player leagues can be ranked correctly in fewer than 20 games. It can predict the probability of each game outcome, which enhances competitive matchmaking, making it possible to assemble skill-balanced teams from a group of players with different abilities.

When matchmaking, the system attempts to match individuals based on their estimated skill level. If two individuals are competing head-to-head and have the same estimated skill level with low estimate uncertainty, they should each have roughly a 50% chance of winning a match. In this way, the system attempts to make every match as competitive as possible.

In order to prevent abuse of the system, the majority of ranked games have relatively limited options for matchmaking. By design, players cannot easily play with their friends in ranked games. However, these countermeasures have failed due to techniques such as alternate account(s) and system flaws where each system has its own individual TrueSkill rating. To provide less competitive games, the system supports unranked &quot;Player Matches&quot;, which allow individuals of any skill level to be paired (often including &quot;guests&quot; on an account). Such matches do not contribute to the TrueSkill rating.

==Microsoft Store==

The Microsoft Store is the current digital marketplace for the Xbox ecosystem starting in 2017 for the Xbox One. It is available on consoles and on Xbox&#x27;s website (as well as its own website), offering games from across all of Xbox&#x27;s generations, in addition to movies, television shows, and multiple apps available as streaming services for music or television.

===Xbox 360 stores===

Xbox Games Store (formerly Xbox Live Marketplace) was a unified storefront for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One which offered both free and premium content for download including Xbox Live Arcade titles, Xbox indie games, original Xbox games, Xbox 360 game demos, game expansion material (e.g. extra maps, vehicles, songs), trailers, gamer pictures and themes, television shows, music videos, movie rentals, Apps and games and more.

On November 6, 2006, Microsoft announced Microsoft Movies &amp; TV (Microsoft Films &amp; TV in other supported countries) (formerly Xbox Video Marketplace, Xbox Video and Zune Video), an exclusive video store accessible through the Xbox 360. Launched in the United States on November 22, 2006, the first anniversary of the Xbox 360&#x27;s launch, the service allows users in the United States to download high-definition and standard-definition television shows for purchase and movies for rental onto an Xbox 360 console for viewing. With the exception of short clips, content is not currently available for streaming, and must be downloaded. Movies are available for rental from the Video Marketplace. They expire in 14 days after download or at the end of the first 24 hours after the movie has begun playing, whichever comes first. Television episodes can be purchased to own, and are transferable to an unlimited number of consoles. Downloaded files use 5.1 surround audio and are encoded using VC-1 for video at 720p, with a bitrate of 6.8 Mbit/s. Television content is offered from MTV, VH1, Comedy Central, Turner Broadcasting and CBS; and movie content is Warner Bros., Paramount and Disney, along with other publishers.

== Xbox Play Anywhere ==

Originally called &quot;Live Anywhere, Play Anywhere&quot; is a cross-platform service allowing owners of &quot;Xbox&quot; and &quot;Windows&quot; games the ability to use said games on either operating system. Under the scheme, supported games purchased digitally on Microsoft Store for Xbox One can also be downloaded on a Windows 10 PC (running Windows 10 Anniversary Update or later) through Microsoft Store using the same Microsoft account at no additional charge, and vice versa. The scheme also promotes the ability to synchronize save data, achievements, and downloadable content between Windows 10 and Xbox One versions of a game.

Microsoft announced in March 2019 that it would be providing Xbox Live SDKs for iOS and Android mobile devices, allowing developers on those platforms to integrate most services of the Xbox network into their applications and games. Microsoft also stated that they were looking to bring this functionality to the Nintendo Switch, anticipating this to be a post-launch feature for the Switch port of &quot;Cuphead&quot;.

=== History ===
&quot;Play Anywhere&quot; was originally released as &quot;Live Anywhere&quot; as a cross-platform initiative to bring the &quot;Xbox network&quot; to a wide variety of Microsoft platforms and devices, including Xbox, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows (Vista and 7), Windows Phone, and Zune. Microsoft&#x27;s Chris Early said of &quot;Live Anywhere&quot; in 2006 that &quot;it [was] a long-term project expected to be rolled out over several years&quot;. While a concept service for mobile devices was demonstrated at E3 2006 and CES 2006 on a Motorola Q mobile phone, it never released.

On February 15, 2010, Microsoft announced its new mobile operating system, Windows Phone. With Windows Phone 7 and Windows Mobile 10, Microsoft integrated full Xbox Live functionality. Windows Phone has since been discontinued.

At E3 2016 on June 14, 2016, &quot;Play Anywhere&quot; was announced, rebranding &quot;Live Anywhere&quot;, and releasing on September 13, 2016.

==Xbox Game Pass Core==
Xbox Game Pass Core, formerly Xbox Live Gold, is a paid subscription service for the Xbox network. Signing up for the Xbox network is free, but a recurring subscription fee is required to access online multiplayer for non-free games. Features that require a Game Pass Core subscription also include game recording and media sharing. Similarly, ordinary Xbox network members can download and access the Twitch live streaming application, but in order to broadcast gameplay of one&#x27;s own, a Game Pass core subscription is necessary. While initially requiring the paid subscription, free-to-play titles, as well as the party chat feature on Xbox consoles, no longer need a subscription to play as of April 2021. Subscribers are allocated storage space on Xbox servers for storing files, and are granted early or exclusive access to betas, and special offers.

On September 14, 2023, Xbox Live Gold was replaced by Xbox Game Pass Core. It carries the same subscription benefits as Xbox Live Gold, but Games with Gold had been discontinued and replaced with a limited selection of games from Xbox Game Pass, with 36 that had been launched and more will be added occasionally.

===Games with Gold===
Games with Gold was a program in which digital downloads of games were offered at no charge to Xbox Live Gold subscribers. Games with Gold initially launched with the Xbox 360 in July 2013, while Xbox One games were added in June 2014. After October 2022, Games with Gold no longer offered Xbox 360 games, with Microsoft stating that they &quot;have reached the limit of our ability to bring Xbox 360 games to the catalogue&quot;. Games downloaded through the program on Xbox 360 were free to own with no further restrictions. Xbox One Games with Gold titles required an active Gold subscription in order to use, and became locked and unplayable if the subscription lapsed. As of November 2015, all Games with Gold titles for Xbox 360 were backwards compatible on Xbox One. The service was discontinued on September 14, 2023 as part of the Xbox network rebranding and focusing on a base-level Game Pass tier.

==Programs==
The &quot;Game with Fame&quot; initiative was Microsoft&#x27;s way to connect Xbox Live members with celebrities and game developers. Notable participants of &quot;Game with Fame&quot; include Shia LaBeouf, Jack Black, Rihanna, Velvet Revolver, Victoria Justice, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Scissor Sisters, Paramore, Korn, OK Go, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Dream Theater, Linkin Park, Green Day and Insane Clown Posse.

&quot;Xbox Ambassadors&quot; are Xbox network members selected by Microsoft who have proven themselves to be helpful towards others, and are willing to assist new Xbox users and answer their questions. As of March 2009, there are ambassadors representing 18 countries in more than 30 languages.

&quot;Xbox Rewards&quot; was a promotion designed to provide gamers incentives to play on the Xbox network by subsidizing achievement points earned with actual rewards. Gamers were required to register for specific challenges which, if successfully completed, would yield a challenge-specific reward.

Microsoft Rewards is a current promotion providing Xbox network members with Reward Points (not to be confused with the defunct Microsoft Points) when they achieve Game Pass goals, buy something on the Marketplace, etc.

&quot;Xbox Live Labs&quot; was a program found in the community section and was available from March 10 to 27, 2011 for members in the United States. If a player chose to participate, they were rewarded with avatar items and 3 zero-point achievements.

&quot;Metamessage&quot; was a show which aimed to answer questions sent in by viewers on anything related to the world of Xbox. The show ran for four series and was released every other Saturday. The show was driven entirely by user-generated questions. To ensure the volume of questions remained high, fans could contact the show in a variety of ways, including sending questions to the &quot;Metamessage&quot; Gamertag over Xbox LIVE, writing an email, or using social network websites.

==Security==
Microsoft implements a number of different security measures on its Xbox network service. One of these takes the form of a proactive security check that assures that only unmodified machines may access their service. On May 17, 2007, Microsoft banned consoles with modified firmware from Xbox Live. A Microsoft representative indicated that the action was taken to assure &quot;the integrity of the service and protect our partners and users.&quot;. According to Microsoft, consoles with firmware of unknown origin, quality or intent were banned permanently from the Xbox network.

It has been discovered that pretexting has been used to impersonate an Xbox network user for sabotage. Microsoft subsequently implemented greater security to decrease the service&#x27;s susceptibility to social engineering.

In early November 2009 Microsoft banned approximately 1 million consoles with modified firmware from Xbox Live.

In October 2011, users of Xbox Live reported having unauthorized access to their Xbox Live accounts, with Microsoft points subsequently being used and/or bought to purchase various in-game items for &quot;FIFA 12&quot;. Microsoft responded to such incidents by restricting access to the account for 25 days while the fraud team investigated. Both EA and Microsoft denied the existence of a wider security breach.

On December 25, 2014, both PlayStation Network and Xbox Live suffered network disruption after a denial-of-service attack. Functionality was restored on December 28, with some users experiencing difficulties in the days that followed.

==First-generation Xbox Live shutdown==
Xbox Live for the original Xbox was discontinued by Microsoft on April 15, 2010, encouraging gamers to upgrade to the Xbox 360. Through loopholes and flaws, however, users were still able to play after the provided time and date Microsoft announced the shutdown. Users could continue interacting in the network; new users, however, could not enter the system. Notably, 14 users played &quot;Halo 2&quot; until May 11, 2010. Though official Xbox Live service has been discontinued for the original Xbox, a replacement service for the original Xbox called Insignia has returned online functionality including online multiplayer, scoreboards, content download and more features to currently supported games.

As an alternative to Insignia, LAN tunnelling software exists, allowing original Xbox users to play system link games such as &quot;Halo 2&quot; with other people from around the world.

=== The &quot;Noble 14&quot; ===
The Noble 14 were a band of users who continued to play &quot;Halo 2&quot; until May 11, 2010, 26 days after the service was officially discontinued by Microsoft. The users would play custom games together, with all attempting to stay on for as long as possible. An Xbox spokesperson made a statement regarding the Noble 14, &quot;A small band of a committed few, engaged in a battle against insurmountable odds. It&#x27;s not Noble team from &quot;&quot;, it&#x27;s the final, passionate few who are still playing &quot;Halo 2&quot;. We wish them the best in their battle against time.&quot; The last 12 users were offered &quot;Halo: Reach&quot; Beta Codes by GamesRadar.com, as well as having their Xbox Live memberships extended by Microsoft. Eventually &quot;Agent Windex&quot; and &quot;Apache N4SIR&quot; were the final two users on the service, however two days after the third user &quot;Lord Odysseus11&quot; was disconnected by an internet drop, user Agent Windex was booted on May 10, stating &quot;Good job Apache, you&#x27;re the last one.&quot; The next day, May 11, Apache N4SIR was booted offline after many hours since Agent Windex was disconnected. He stated that he wanted to play 15 hours, 14 for each member, then one final hour for the community.

==Revenue==

Bloomberg has estimated that Xbox network likely generated over $1 billion in revenue in the 2010 fiscal year, which ended on June 30, 2010.

<doc id="881594" wikidata="Q8051686" url="?curid=881594" title="Yellow Cab Ambassador">
<text>Ambassador was an American automobile produced by the Yellow Cab Company of Chicago, Illinois, between 1921 and 1925.

== History ==
Initially sold for use as a taxicab, the Model D-1 was introduced as a &quot;drive-yourself&quot; model in 1924.

Yellow Cab introduced the Ambassador in 1921 and explained that &quot;this car was being made up to order&quot;. The Ambassador was available as a 4-passenger sport or 7-passenger touring for US$4,500, as well as a Berlin limousine or sedan for $6,500. All featured a wheelbase and a special 6-cylinder Continental L-head engine.

In 1925 Yellow Cab was taken over by General Motors. John D. Hertz remained as president and the Ambassador D-1 model became the &quot;Hertz&quot;. Apart from a larger engine in 1927, production continued with little change until 1928. Most were sedans, although other body styles were available.

<doc id="881595" wikidata="Q399102" url="?curid=881595" title="Agustín Barrios">
<text>Agustín Pío Barrios (also known as Agustín Barrios Mangoré and Nitsuga—Agustín spelled backwards—Mangoré; May 5, 1885 – August 7, 1944) was a Paraguayan virtuoso classical guitarist and composer, largely regarded as one of the greatest performers and arguably the most prolific composer for the guitar.

==Biography==
===Birthplace===
It has been generally accepted that Barrios was born in San Juan Bautista, Paraguay, although the baptismal document in the book of registries in the cathedral of that city does not give his place of birth and several biographers and authorities present evidence that he was actually born in nearby Villa Florida, Misiones, on the Tebicuary River, 30 km to the north; Barrios&#x27; diplomatic papers, found in 2019, give &quot;Missiones&quot; [sic] as the place of birth.

===Early life===
As a child, Barrios developed a love of music and literature, two arts that were very important to his family. Barrios would eventually speak two languages (Spanish and Guarani), and read three others (English, French, and German).

Barrios began to show an interest in musical instruments, particularly the guitar, before he reached his teens. He went to Asunción in 1900, at the age of fifteen, to attend Colegio Nacional de Asunción, thus becoming one of the youngest university students in Paraguayan history. Apart from his studies in the music department, Barrios was highly appreciated by members of the mathematics, journalism and literature departments. He was a skilled graphic artist and worked for a time in the Agricultura bank and the Paraguayan Naval office.

After leaving the Colegio Nacional, Barrios dedicated his life to music, poetry, and travel. He composed more than 100 original works and arranged another 200 works of other composers. Barrios made several friends during his many trips across South America. He was known for giving his friends and fans signed copies of his poems. As a consequence, there are several versions of his poetical works that have surfaced across the Americas. Many current collectors warn potential buyers to be careful when they come across a work reportedly autographed by Barrios because of known forgeries.

===Career===

Barrios was famed for his phenomenal performances, both live and on gramophone recordings. Eye-witness testimony from Lope Texera in Caracas Venezuela on April 18, 1932, declared that Barrios was &quot;superior to Segovia whom I saw in London last year&quot;. Barrios has been credited as the first classical guitarist to make recordings, in 1909/10, but the earliest known recordings were by guitarists Luis and Simon Ramirez, onto cylinders, for the &quot;Viuda de Aramburo&quot; label, in Madrid, between 1897 and 1901. Barrios sometimes performed in concert in traditional Paraguayan dress (he was partly of Guaraní origin), beginning in 1932 using the pseudonym of Nitsuga Mangoré (&#x27;Nitsuga&#x27; being Agustín spelled backwards, and &#x27;Mangoré&#x27; being the name of a cacique of the South American indigenous group Timbú).

His works were largely late-Romantic in character, despite his having lived well into the twentieth century. Many of them are also adaptations of, or are influenced by, South American and Central American folk music. Many of them are considered virtuosic.

The Johann Sebastian Bach-inspired &quot;La Catedral&quot;, from 1921, is widely considered to be Barrios&#x27; magnum opus, winning the approval of Andrés Segovia, who said &quot;In 1921 in Buenos Aires, I played at the hall La Argentina noted for its good acoustics for guitar, where Barrios had concertized just weeks before me. He was presented to me by his secretary Elbio Trapani. At my invitation, Barrios visited me at the hotel and played for me upon my very own guitar several of his compositions, among which the one that really impressed me was a magnificent concert piece &quot;The Cathedral&quot; whose first movement is an andante, like an introduction and prelude, and a second very virtuosic piece which is ideal for the repertory of any concert guitarist. Barrios had promised to send me immediately a copy of the work (I had ten days remaining before continuing my journey) but I never received a copy.&quot; However, it is equally possible that Segovia did receive the score and chose not to play it, either out of distaste for Barrios&#x27; folk-based music or professional jealousy (because Barrios was more of a composer than he was).

===Later life and death===

After touring Europe in 1934-35, Barrios performed in Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. Several writers have suggested that Barrios revisited Mexico in 1939, but his immigration file with the Mexican government did not include an entry for him or his wife Gloria that year. He fulfilled his dream to reach the United States after getting an entry visa at the US Embassy in Maracaibo Venezuela on December 23, 1936. Ship passenger lists reveal that Barrios and his wife travelled as diplomats and arrived in Puerto Rico, a US territory, in January 1937.

He reportedly suffered a myocardial infarction in front of the US Embassy in Guatemala City on October 27, 1939, after it was discovered that he was travelling with phony diplomatic papers issued by his lifetime friend and Patron Tomas Salomoni. Having recently been in Germany, at the lead-in to the Second World War, Barrios was never again able to use his diplomatic connections. He was sent an invitation to leave Guatemala because of his political leanings. He accepted a presidential invite of Maximiliano Hernández Martínez, then President of El Salvador, to move to El Salvador, and take up a position in the National Conservatory of Music and Declamation &#x27;Rafael Olmedo&#x27;.

He was never to leave El Salvador. Past biographers suggested that, on August 7, 1944, he suffered a second myocardial infarction which caused his death, but this is still undetermined. A forensic physician has suggested that his death was more likely due to poisoning. At the time, Barrios&#x27; wife was carrying on an open affair with the Italian coffee plantation owner Pasquale Cosarelli, who was also residing in the Barrios household. Cosarelli was soon to marry Barrios&#x27; widow, and had both the motive and the chemicals to carry out the murder. Barrios was buried at Cementerio de Los Ilustres, having been carried there in the hottest week of the year on the shoulders of his students. In the hours after his death, his handwritten scores were stolen by his students along with his scrapbooks.

==Legacy==
===Twelve &quot;Mangoreanos&quot;===

During his performing years, Barrios only informally shared bits of his musical knowledge with his patrons Luis Pasquet, Martin Borda Pagola, Dionisio Basualdo, Bautista and Lalyta Almiron, and Raul Borges.

Barrios vehemently rejected the idea of devoting time to the formal instruction of students, as he saw it detrimental to the flourishing of the artist, often responding to persuasive attempts &quot;cuando nace el maestro, muere el artista&quot; (the artist dies with the birth of the teacher). Given his masterful command of the instrument and compositional prolificity, the stance was then perceived as tragic eccentricity.

Following his extensive travels in Brazil while he was still an active performer, and beginning in 1940, he wrote his guitar method. Fate and necessity had it such that he, after arriving in El Salvador, were to finally provide comprehensive guitar composition and performance instruction to selected students, mostly of Salvadoran nationality. They were known as the Twelve &quot;Mangoreanos&quot;:

Jose Cándido Morales and Roberto Bracamontes were the only ones to learn from Barrios as live-in students in the Barrios home, which functioned as a boarding house.

After Barrios&#x27; death, Morales remained the keeper of Barrios&#x27; legacy, techniques, and late works. Morales taught hundreds across socio-economic segments, ages, and natural talents. Notable descendants of Barrios through Morales&#x27; formation include Dr Jorge Alberto Sanabria and Oscar Babich.

==Folk music==
The folk music of Paraguay (including the polca paraguaya and vals) provided the young Barrios with his first introduction to music. In 1898, Barrios was formally introduced to the classical guitar repertoire by Gustavo Sosa Escalada. At that time, Barrios may have already composed works for the guitar, and also performed pieces written by his other composers, such as &quot;La Chinita&quot; and &quot;La Perezosa&quot;. Under the influence of his new teacher, Barrios went on to perform and study the works of Tárrega, Viñas, Sor and Aguado. Sosa Escalada was so impressed with his new pupil that he convinced Barrios&#x27;s parents to let him move to Asunción to continue his education. Having already surpassed the technical and performing abilities of most guitarists, Barrios began seriously to compose around 1905.

Among the folkloric influences, Barrios is known to have played such popular Paraguayan works as &quot;Campamento Cerro León&quot;, &quot;Londón Carapé&quot;, &quot;Guyrá campana&quot;, &quot;Mamá Cumandá&quot;. As an example, &quot;Guyrá campana&quot; is very interesting, since some of the material can be heard in parts of Barrios&#x27; recording of &quot;Caazapá — Aire Popular Paraguayo&quot;. Though &quot;Guyrá campana&quot; is traditional music, many maintain that it is very closely related to guitarist Carlos Talavera (from Caazapá), whom Barrios knew.
There are various versions of &quot;Guyrá campana&quot; (it is also known as &quot;Pájaro campana&quot;) e.g. for Paraguayan harp (Félix Pérez Cardozo); in some versions, the birdsong imitations can be very clearly heard.

==Composer==

Barrios&#x27;s compositions can be divided into three basic categories: folkloric, imitative and religious. Barrios paid tribute to the music and people of his native land by composing pieces modeled after folk songs from South America and Central America. Implementing the compositional style and techniques of the Baroque and Romantic periods was another side to his craftsmanship. &quot;Una Limosna por el Amor de Dios&quot; (&quot;Alms for the Love of God&quot;) is an example of a religiously-inspired work.

==Works==

Over 300 of Barrios&#x27; compositions and arrangements survive. John Williams, former student of Andres Segovia, said of Barrios: &quot;As a guitarist/composer, Barrios is the best of the lot, regardless of era. His music is better formed, it&#x27;s more poetic, it&#x27;s more everything! And it&#x27;s more of all those things in a timeless way.&quot;

==Instruments==
While in Paraguay, Barrios had access only to instruments of limited quality. However, soon after his arrival in Buenos Aires in 1910, he was exposed to, and played, the finest instruments of his time for the remainder of his career. Barrios normally traveled with two guitars, and had several modified with the addition of a 20th fret. He is documented by photograph to have played the instruments of Spanish luthiers Manuel Ramirez, José Ramírez I, Enrique García, Francisco Simplicio, Domingo Esteso, Enrique Sanfeliu and Ricardo Sanchis Nacher, Brazilian maker Di Giorgio, and in print by Uruguayan maker Rodolfo Camacho.

==Film==
On August 21, 2015, the film &quot;Mangoré – For the Love of Art&quot; was released in Asunción, based loosely on the life of Agustin Barrios, with a script and direction by the Chilean filmmaker Luis R. Vera. The guitarist was played by the Mexican actor Damián Alcázar and the Paraguayan actor Celso Franco, star of &quot;7 Boxes&quot;. The music in the soundtrack was played by the Paraguayan guitarist Berta Rojas. The concert scenes were filmed using a guitar by Mexican guitar maker Federico Sheppard.

<doc id="881600" wikidata="Q277552" url="?curid=881600" title="Majuli">
<text>Majuli (Mazuli) is a large river island located in Assam, India. It is formed by the Brahmaputra River to the south and east, the Subansiri River to the west, and an anabranch of the Brahmaputra River.

The island is inhabited by members of the Mising, Deori, and Sonowal Kachari tribes and serves as a hub of Assamese neo-Vaishnavite culture. It is accessible by ferry from Jorhat, which is located about 250 kilometers northeast of Guwahati.

It was the first island in the country to become a governmental district in 2016. Since 2004, Majuli has been on the UNESCO Tentative List for nomination as a World Heritage Site.

== Largest river island ==
Majuli is recognized by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s largest inland river island. However, the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; cites Bananal Island in Brazil as the largest in the world.

The dispute stems from the Araguaia River, which forms Bananal Island by either splitting into two separate rivers that later rejoin or remaining as one river that forms an island in its middle.

==History==

The island is a long and slender piece of land located between two parallel rivers: the Brahmaputra to the north and the Burhidihing to the south. Between 1661 and 1696, a series of earthquakes in the 17th century, set the stage for a massive flood in 1750, reshaping the region. This flood caused the Brahmaputra to change its course which resulted in the formation of Majuli Island.

The Ahom king Pratap Singha built a rampart on Majuli called Meragarh in the first half of the 17th century. Lakshmi Singha, who reigned as Ahom king from 1769 to 1780, wrote a grant in 1776 referring to &quot;Majuli Pradesh&quot; and its Kamalabari Satra, Agnichapori, Gajala Satra, and the Tuni River. During the Moamaria rebellion, the island was controlled by Howha, a Moamaria rebel leader.

The Burhi Dihing&#x27;s confluence moved east by 190 km. The southern channel became the Burhi Xuti, while the northern channel turned into the Luit Xuti. Over time, the Luit Xuti diminished, becoming the Kerkota Xuti, while the Burhi Xuti expanded to become the main Brahmaputra River.

Majuli has been the cultural hub of Assamese civilization since the 16th century, largely due to the visit of Srimanta Sankardeva, a social reformer of that era. Sankardeva, a pioneer of the neo-Vaishnavite movement, preached Vaishnavism and established monasteries called &quot;satras&quot; on the island.

Majuli became a major hub of Vaishnavism with the establishment of satras. It remained under British rule until India gained independence in 1947 and is recognized as the world&#x27;s largest river island.

Over the last 200 years, Majuli has shrunk in size as the river surrounding it has expanded. In the 1790s, the island covered an area of . By the beginning of the 20th century, it had an area of ; however, due to significant erosion, it covered only as of 2014.

==Culture and demography==

===Population===


The population of Majuli consists of scheduled tribes and castes, as well as non-tribal caste Hindu Assamese. The indigenous communities include members of the Mising (the majority), Deori, Kaibarta, and Sonowal Kachari tribes, who immigrated from Arunachal Pradesh to Majuli centuries ago. The non-tribal caste Hindu Assamese communities include Koch, Kalita, Ahom, Sutiya, and Jogi. The languages spoken are Mising, Assamese, and Deori. The island has 144 villages with a population of over 150,000, resulting in a density of 300 individuals per square kilometer.

A ferry service connecting Majuli to Jorhat operates six times daily, and night buses run from Guwahati to Majuli via Lakhimpur. Despite various challenges, modernization has reached the island with the establishment of medical centers and schools. Housing has also transitioned from traditional bamboo and mud structures to concrete buildings.

===Festivals===
The &quot;Ali aye ligang&quot; festival, celebrated in mid-February for five days, is a grand event that starts on the second Wednesday and ends on the first Wednesday of the Falgun month. Local dishes such as purang apin (packed boiled rice), apong (rice beer), and various pork, fish, and chicken dishes are served. The traditional Mising dance called Gumrag Soman is performed in every village to worship Donyi Polo (Mother Sun and Father Moon) for a good harvest.

In upper Majuli, the majority of Christians from the Mising tribe celebrate Christmas, particularly in the village of Jengraimukh. For the last half millennium, Majuli has served as the cultural center and cradle of Assamese civilization. The satras safeguard ancient artifacts such as weapons, utensils, jewelry, and other culturally significant items. Traditional pottery is crafted using clay and fired in driftwood kilns, following the methods of the ancient Harappan Civilization. Despite pressure from modernizing forces, these ancient cultural practices and dance forms remain largely intact. The handloom work of these tribes enjoys international acclaim.

The three-day-long Raas Mahotsav festival, which portrays Krishna&#x27;s life, involves virtually everyone on the island. People from afar, including expatriates, come to celebrate. The satras have mastered various art and craft traditions, some of which are exclusive to this region. For instance, mask-making is a craft found in Natun Samuguri Satra, while Kamalabari Satra is renowned for crafting exceptional boats.

===Neo-Vaishnavite Satras===
Majuli has long been the center of Assamese neo-Vaishnavite culture, which began in the 15th century under the guidance of the Assamese saint Srimanta Sankardeva and his disciple Madhavdeva. Many of the satras built by Sankardeva still stand, reflecting the vibrant Assamese culture. Sankardeva sought refuge in Majuli, spending time in Belguri in West Majuli, where the historic Manikanchan Sanjog event took place when he met Madhavdeva for the first time. The first satra in Majuli was established in Belguri by Sankardeva, leading to the creation of a total of 65 satras. However, today, only 22 of the original 65 are still active. Out of the 665 original satras in Assam, 65 were located in Majuli.

The main surviving &quot;Satras (Satra)&quot; are:

* Dakhinpat Satra: Founded by Banamalidev, it is known for celebrating Raasleela, which is now recognized as one of Assam&#x27;s national festivals.
* Garamur Satra: Founded by Lakshmikantadeva, Garamur Satra consists of two parts: Garamur Bor Satra and Garamur Saru Satra. Both parts celebrate the traditional Raasleela with grandeur at the end of autumn and house ancient weapons known as &quot;Bartop&quot; or cannons.
* Auniati Satra: Founded by Niranjan Pathakdeva, this satra is renowned for &quot;Paalnaam&quot; and Apsara dances, as well as its extensive collection of ancient Assamese artifacts, utensils, jewelry, and handicrafts. It has 125 disciples and over 700,000 global followers.
* Kamalabari Satra: Founded by Bedulapadma Ata, Kamalabari Satra is a center of art, culture, literature, and classical studies on the island. Its branch, the Uttar Kamalabari Satra, has performed cultural programs of Satria art both across the country and abroad.
* Narashingha Satra: Established in 1746 by Ahom King Promottra Singha, Shri Shri Alengi Narasingha Satra is a notable institution on the island.
* Benegenaati Satra: This satra is a reliquary of culturally significant antiques and an advanced center of performing arts. It was founded by Muraridev, the grandson of Sankaradeva&#x27;s stepmother. Among its notable artifacts is the royal raiment belonging to Ahom King Swargadeo Godadhar Singha, which is made of gold. The satra also preserves a royal umbrella crafted from gold.
* Shamaguri Satra: This satra is famous for mask-making in India.
* Bihimpur Satra: This satra holds the treasures of &quot;Borgeet,&quot; Matiakhara, and Satriya dances, including various forms such as Jumora Dance, Chali Dance, Notua Dance, Nande Vringee, Sutradhar, Ozapali, Apsara Dance, Satria Krishna Dance, and Dasavater Dance, all propagated by Srimanta Sankardeva. Additionally, it has become a center for spiritual purification (&quot;shuddhi&quot;) in Northeast India, thanks to the efforts of Pitambar Deva Goswami.

===Literature===

Neo-Vaishnavi preacher Madhavdev met his guru, Shankar Dev, the founder of neo-Vaishnavism, on the island in an event termed the &quot;Manikanchan Sanjog.&quot; Madhavdev and his mentor enriched Assamese literature by writing, among other works, &quot;Nam Ghosa&quot;, &quot;Borgeet&quot;, and &quot;Bhatima&quot;. Following the footsteps of these Vaishnavi leaders, the temples (satras) encouraged the writing of plays and devotional songs. 

Majuli has also given birth to a host of literary luminaries, including well-renowned writers such as Dhruba Jyoti Borah, poet and critic Rajib Borah, bilingual critic and writer Bhaskar Jyoti Nath, Juri Borah Borgohain, Deba Bhushan Borah, historian Dambarudhar Nath, novelist Gobin Khound, and poet Danny Gam.

The second Assamese newspaper, &quot;Asom Bilasini&quot;, was published from Majuli starting in 1871. 

==Ecology==


Majul is a wetland that serves as a habitat for various rare and endangered avian species, particularly migratory birds that visit during the winter. Notable species include the greater adjutant stork, pelican, Siberian crane, and whistling teal. After dark, wild geese and ducks take flight to distant destinations. The island remains relatively pollution-free due to the absence of industrial activity and consistent rainfall.

However, Majuli faces a significant threat from extensive soil erosion along its banks. Large embankments built in nearby towns upstream to prevent erosion during the monsoon season have had unintended consequences. The turbulent Brahmaputra River now erodes much of the island. Reports indicate that by 1853, Majuli&#x27;s total area was 1,150 km², and roughly 33% of this landmass eroded in the latter half of the 20th century. Since 1991, more than 35 villages have been washed away, and surveys predict that Majuli may cease to exist within the next 15 to 20 years.

To save the island, the Union Government of India has sanctioned ₹ 2.50 billion (US$55 million) for its protection. The Water Resources Department and the Brahmaputra Board have been struggling to solve the erosion problem for the last three decades but have had little success. Recently, it was suggested that constructing a four-lane highway protected by a concrete mat along the southern boundary of Majuli, along with the excavation of the riverbed of the Brahmaputra River, could help address the issue. The project also includes two floodgates for the Kherkatia Suti, a tributary of the Brahmaputra. The Brahmaputra River Restoration Project has yet to be implemented by the government. However, a nomination has been submitted to UNESCO for declaring Majuli as a World Heritage Site.

Local environmental activist Jadav Payeng has planted a 550-hectare forest known as Molai Forest to combat erosion on the island. Much of the island was once barren sandbars that were vulnerable to erosion, but thanks to Payeng&#x27;s afforestation efforts, it has become a lush forest. The forest has become a habitat for various animals, including elephants, tigers, deer, and vultures.

==Economy==


===Industries ===
The main industry on Majuli is agriculture, with paddy (unmilled) rice being the main crop. The island has a rich and diverse agricultural tradition, with as many as 100 varieties of rice grown. Fishing is also a major industry, following agriculture. Among the fascinating varieties of rice produced are &quot;Komal Saul&quot;, a unique type that can be eaten after immersing the grains in warm water for 15 minutes and is usually consumed as a breakfast cereal; Bao Dhan, which grows underwater and is harvested after ten months; and &quot;bora saul&quot;, a sticky brown rice used to make a traditional cake with fish known as &quot;pitha&quot;. Other important economic activities include fishing, dairying, pottery, handloom, and boat-making.

Handloom weaving is a major occupation among the female population of the villages. Although largely a non-commercial activity, it keeps many of the inhabitants occupied. The weaving is exquisite and intricate, utilizing a variety of colors and textures of cotton and silk, especially Muga silk. On 4 November 2017, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal launched 647 schemes with a total financial outlay of ₹246 million to boost Majuli&#x27;s development.

===Education sector===
The following higher learning institutions are present:
*Majuli University of Culture
*National Institute of Electronics &amp; Information Technology
*Majuli College Kamalabari
*Jengraimukh College, Jengraimukh
*Ujani Majuli Kherkatia College, Nayabazar, Majuli
*Rangachahi College
*Pub Majuli College, Bongaon
*Garamur College, Garamur

===Tourism sector ===

Mājuli is located 20 km from Jorhat. One can take a bus or a hired taxi to Nimati Steamer Ghat, where ferry services are available. The journey takes over three hours to cover, involving three bus rides and two ferry rides.

The northern bank of Majuli is bordered by the Subansiri River, while the southern bank features the Brahmaputra River, which delineates the island from the mainland. Lakhimpur town is situated to the north, and Golaghat lies to the southwest. Sibsagar is located to the southeast, and Jorhat is positioned to the south. To the extreme east of Majuli is Dibrugarh District.

<text>A hydrograph is a graph showing the rate of flow (discharge) versus time past a specific point in a river, channel, or conduit carrying flow. The rate of flow is typically expressed in units of cubic meters per second (m³/s) or cubic feet per second (cfs).
Hydrographs often relate changes of precipitation to changes in discharge over time. The term can also refer to a graph showing the volume of water reaching a particular outfall, or location in a sewerage network. Graphs are commonly used in the design of sewerage, more specifically, the design of surface water sewerage systems and combined sewers.

==Terminology==

Source:

;Discharge: the rate of flow (volume per unit time) passing a specific location in a river, or other channel. The discharge is measured at a specific point in a river and is typically time variant.
;Approach Segment: the river flow before the storm (antecedent flow).
;Rising limb: The rising limb of the hydrograph, also known as concentration curve, reflects a prolonged increase in discharge from a catchment area, typically in response to a rainfall event.
;Peak discharge:the highest point on the hydrograph when the rate of discharge is greatest.
;Recession (or falling) limb: The recession limb extends from the peak flow rate onward. The end of stormflow ( quickflow or direct runoff) and the return to groundwater-derived flow (base flow) is often taken as the point of inflection of the recession limb. The recession limb represents the withdrawal of water from the storage built up in the basin during the earlier phases of the hydrograph.
;Lag-1: autocorrelation method to compare streamflow data to itself by shifting or &quot;lagging&quot; initial discharge dataset 1 time unit. A Lag-10 would mean the initial data is shifted 10 days, then is compared to an unshifted version of the data. Not to be confused with lag time.
;Lag time: the time interval from the maximum rainfall to the peak discharge.
;Time to peak: time interval from the start of rainfall to the peak discharge.
;Time of concentration: Time of concentration is the time from the end of the precipitation period to the end of the quick–response runoff in the hydrograph.
Types of hydrographs include:
*Stream discharge hydrographs
*Stream stage hydrographs
*Precipitation hydrographs
*Storm hydrographs
*Flood hydrographs
*Annual hydrographs a.k.a. regimes
*Direct Runoff Hydrograph
*Effective Runoff Hydrograph
*Raster Hydrograph
*Lag-1 Hydrograph
*Storage opportunities in the drainage network (e.g., lakes, reservoirs, wetlands, channel and bank storage capacity)

==Baseflow separation==
A stream hydrograph is commonly determining the influence of different hydrologic processes on discharge from the subject catchment. Because the timing, magnitude, and duration of groundwater return flow differs so greatly from that of direct runoff, separating and understanding the influence of these distinct processes is key to analyzing and simulating the likely hydrologic effects of various land use, water use, weather, and climate conditions and changes.

However, the process of separating “baseflow” from “direct runoff” is an inexact science. In part this is because these two concepts are not, themselves, entirely distinct and unrelated. Return flow from groundwater increases along with overland flow from saturated or impermeable areas during and after a storm event; moreover, a particular water molecule can easily move through both pathways en route to the watershed outlet. Therefore, separation of a purely “baseflow component” in a hydrograph is a somewhat arbitrary exercise. Nevertheless, various graphical and empirical techniques have been developed to perform these hydrograph separations. The separation of base flow from direct runoff can be an important first step in developing rainfall-runoff models for a watershed of interest—for example, in developing and applying unit hydrographs as described below.

==Unit hydrograph==

A &quot;unit hydrograph&quot; (UH) is the hypothetical unit response of a watershed (in terms of runoff volume and timing) to a unit input of rainfall. It can be defined as the &quot;direct runoff hydrograph&quot; (DRH) resulting from one unit (e.g., one cm or one inch) of &quot;effective rainfall&quot; occurring uniformly over that watershed at a uniform rate over a unit period of time. As a UH is applicable only to the direct runoff component of a hydrograph (i.e., surface runoff), a separate determination of the baseflow component is required.

A UH is specific to a particular watershed, and specific to a particular length of time corresponding to the duration of the effective rainfall. That is, the UH is specified as being the 1-hour, 6-hour, or 24-hour UH, or any other length of time up to the &quot;time of concentration&quot; of direct runoff at the watershed outlet. Thus, for a given watershed, there can be many unit hydrographs, each one corresponding to a different duration of effective rainfall.

The UH technique provides a practical and relatively easy-to-apply tool for quantifying the effect of a unit of rainfall on the corresponding runoff from a particular drainage basin. UH theory assumes that a watershed&#x27;s runoff response is linear, time-invariant, and that the effective rainfall occurs uniformly over the entirety of the watershed. In the real world, none of these assumptions are strictly true. Nevertheless, the application of UH methods typically yields a reasonable approximation of the flood response of natural watersheds. The linear assumptions underlying UH theory allow for the variation in storm intensity over time (i.e., the storm &quot;hyetograph&quot;) to be simulated by applying the principles of superposition and proportionality to separate storm components to determine the resulting cumulative hydrograph. This allows for a relatively straightforward calculation of the hydrograph response to any arbitrary rain event.

An instantaneous unit hydrograph is a further refinement of the concept; for an IUH, the input rainfall is assumed to all take place at a discrete point in time (obviously, this isn&#x27;t the case for actual rainstorms). Making this assumption can greatly simplify the analysis involved in constructing a unit hydrograph, and it is necessary for the creation of a geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph.

The creation of a GIUH is possible given nothing more than topologic data for a particular drainage basin. In fact, only the number of streams of a given order, the mean length of streams of a given order, and the mean land area draining directly to streams of a given order are absolutely required (and can be estimated rather than explicitly calculated if necessary). It is therefore possible to calculate a GIUH for a basin without any data about stream height or flow, which may not always be available.

==Subsurface hydrology hydrograph==
In subsurface hydrology (hydrogeology), a hydrograph is a record of the water level (the observed hydraulic head in wells screened across an aquifer).

Typically, a hydrograph is recorded for monitoring of heads in aquifers during non-test conditions (e.g., to observe the seasonal fluctuations in an aquifer). When an aquifer test is being performed, the resulting observations are typically called drawdown, since they are subtracted from pre-test levels and often only the change in water level is dealt with.

==Raster hydrograph==

Raster hydrographs are pixel-based plots for visualizing and identifying variations and changes in large multidimensional data sets. Originally developed by Keim (2000) they were first applied in hydrology by Koehler (2004) as a means of highlighting inter-annual and intra-annual changes in streamflow. The raster hydrographs in WaterWatch, like those developed by Koehler, depict years on the y-axis and days along the x-axis. Users can choose to plot streamflow (actual values or log values), streamflow percentile, or streamflow class (from 1, for low flow, to 7 for high flow), for Daily, 7-Day, 14-Day, and 28-Day streamflow. For a more comprehensive description of raster hydrographs, see Strandhagen et al. (2006).

==Lag-1 hydrograph==

A Lag-1 hydrograph is a graph of discharge which can be accomplished without a time axis (Koehler 2022). This technique allows data properties such as Q, dQ/dt, and d2Q/dt2, and trends of increasing, decreasing or no change flow to be readily seen and understood on a single graph. Flow pulse reference lines can easily be added and interpreted. The methodology is based on the time-series serial correlation lag-1 graph and uses the normally unwanted (but still valuable) autocorrelation present within the streamflow data. 

The x-axis represents the discharge for a date, Qt, while the y-axis represents the discharge for the next day, Qt+1.
Data preparation and plotting methods are identical to an autocorrelation lag 1 plot, where 1 indicates a 1-day or daily time step. The table below shows how the time-series discharge are shifted. It is critical that the temporal sequence is maintained for the data. Thinking of the x values as “flow for today” and the y values as “flow for tomorrow” helps visualize the order of the data.

<doc id="881619" wikidata="Q1738098" url="?curid=881619" title="Keith Taylor (British politician)">
<text>Keith Richard Taylor (1 August 1953 – 31 October 2022) was a Green Party of England and Wales politician who was MEP for South East England from 2010 to 2019 and was the Party&#x27;s animal rights spokesperson until his retirement in 2019. He was one of the two Principal Speakers of the party from August 2004 to November 2006.

==Early career==
Before becoming a Green Party activist, Taylor lived in Brighton and owned a local business. Taylor &quot;took to community activism opposing an inappropriate local development&quot;, leading him to join the Green Party. Taylor was a participant in the campaign by BUDD, opposing the development now called the New England Quarter adjacent to Brighton railway station.

==Green Party councillor and parliamentary candidate==
In 1999, Taylor was elected as a councillor on Brighton and Hove Borough Council, representing the St Peter&#x27;s ward. He became &#x27;Convenor&#x27; (the local group&#x27;s name for its leader) of the Green group on the council. During his time as a councillor Taylor was a member of the Policy &amp; Resources Committee, the Adult Social Care &amp; Health Committee, the Housing Committee, the Joint Commissioning Board, the Shoreham Airport Joint Committee, the Housing Decision Procedures Scrutiny Panel and the Licensing &amp; Regulatory Functions Sub-Committee.

Taylor stood in 2001 and 2005 as the parliamentary candidate for the Green Party in the Brighton Pavilion constituency. Taylor received 9.3% in 2001 and 21.9% of the vote in 2005.

In August 2004, Taylor was appointed a replacement for Mike Woodin as the Green Party&#x27;s Male Principal Speaker alongside Caroline Lucas. &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that Taylor &quot;defies the stereotype of Green politicians as earnest or bookish academics&quot;. Taylor was confirmed in the post after a by-election in November 2005, beating Derek Wall by 851 votes to 803; again, serving alongside Lucas. Taylor had gained prominence for being, at the time, the Green Party&#x27;s most successful parliamentary candidate in the UK, after winning 22% of the vote in the Brighton Pavilion constituency at the 2005 General Election. In November 2006, Taylor lost re-election to Wall by 767 votes to 705.

In 2007, Taylor faced Lucas to be selected as the Green Party&#x27;s parliamentary candidate for the Brighton Pavilion constituency in the next general election. Taylor, on announcing his campaign, said, &quot;This will be the third time I&#x27;ve contested this seat. I inherited a 2.6% vote for the Greens and have built that up to 22%. Next time, if I am selected again Brighton voters will make history in electing me the country&#x27;s first Green MP&quot;. Lucas, in a letter to local party members, said that she had been invited to stand by several local members and described it as &quot;the most difficult decision of my life&quot; because of her &quot;personal and family commitments&quot; and her &quot;loyalty and commitment to Keith Taylor, who is a person and a politician for whom I have great admiration and respect&quot;.

On 18 July 2007, it was announced that Lucas had been selected ahead of Taylor by the Brighton Green Party. Lucas won with 55% of the party ballot against Taylor&#x27;s 45%. Taylor congratulated Lucas and pledged his support for her campaign.

In May 2009, Taylor was an early signatory of the International Simultaneous Policy (SIMPOL) which seeks to end the usual deadlock in tackling global issues.

==Member of European Parliament==
On 6 May 2010, Lucas was elected as Member of Parliament for Brighton Pavilion and upon doing so was required to resign as the MEP for the South East of England. Taylor being second on the Green Party list was appointed Lucas&#x27; replacement to serve out the remainder of the term until 2014. Taylor was also required to resign as a local councillor under European Parliament rules on dual mandates. Taylor was reelected as MEP for the South East region in the 2014 Euro election, with 9.05% of the vote. He did not stand in the 2019 European election. In the European Parliament, he sat with the Greens–European Free Alliance.

<doc id="881620" wikidata="Q316609" url="?curid=881620" title="Matthias Wissmann">
<text>Matthias Wissmann (born 15 April 1949) is a German lawyer and politician of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). He served as the president of the German Automobile Industry Association (VdA) from 2007 until 2018.

Since 1999 Wissmann has been a partner with the law firm WilmerHale.

==Early life and education==
Wissmann was born in Ludwigsburg on 15 April 1949. He studied law at the university of Bonn. He became a member of &quot;K.D.St.V. Alania Bonn&quot;, a catholic student fraternity that is member of the Cartellverband.

==Political career==
Since 1965, Wissmann has been active in politics. He became a member of the political youth organisation Junge Union and in 1968 of the CDU. From 1973 to 1983 he was federal leader of the Junge Union.

In 1976, Wissmann was elected to the German Bundestag for the Christlich-Demokratische Union. In 1981, he was chairman of the commission &quot;Jugendprotest im demokratischen Staat&quot; (youth protest in the democratic state) until 1983. In the years 1983 until 1993 he was the spokesman of his parliamentary group for economic affairs, under the leadership of successive chairmen Alfred Dregger and Wolfgang Schäuble.

On 21 January 1993, Wissmann became Federal Minister of Research and Technology in the government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Only four-month later, after the resignation of Günther Krause, he became Federal Minister of Transport on 13 May 1993.

During his time in office, Wissmann – together with the Governing Mayor of Berlin Eberhard Diepgen and the Minister-President of Brandenburg Manfred Stolpe – committed to Schönefeld as the site for the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport on 28 May 1996. This so-called &quot;consensus decision&quot; was later affirmed by the respective state legislatures.

Wissmann left the government after his party lost the federal elections on 27 September 1998.

During Wolfgang Schäuble&#x27;s tenure as party chairman from 1998 to 2000, Wissmann served as federal treasurer of the CDU. By April 2000, following the CDU donations scandal, he had to report an annual deficit of more than $8 million and oversaw efforts to cut personnel, rent out part of the party&#x27;s new Berlin headquarters, and shrink its publications.

From 1998 to 2002 Wissmann also was the chairman of the parliamentary Committee on Economic Affairs and Technology. From 2002 he served as chairman of the Committee on the Affairs of the European Union.

During his time in parliament, Wissmann also became partner at the international law firm WilmerHale. At the firm, he was a member of the corporate group, where he focused on transactions having a transatlantic dimension, and headed the Legal Strategy and Public Policy practice group in Berlin.

==Life after politics==
Wissmann laid down his parliamentary mandate by 31 May 2007 to become the president of the German Automobile Industry Association (VDA) from 1 June 2007. He held this office until February 2018. During his time in office, he also served as vice-president of &quot;Pro Mobilität&quot;, an industry group lobbying for improvements in Germany&#x27;s street network.

In 2014, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Sigmar Gabriel appointed Wissmann to the government&#x27;s advisory board on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).

In October 2016, Wissmann was unanimously elected as president of the Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d&#x27;Automobiles (OICA) for a two-year mandate, succeeding Yong-geun Kim. Since 2017, he has also been Vice President of the Federation of German Industries (BDI).

<doc id="881625" wikidata="Q691648" url="?curid=881625" title="Robert Stephens">
<text>Sir Robert Graham Stephens (14 July 193112 November 1995) was an English actor in the early years of Britain&#x27;s Royal National Theatre.

==Early life==
Stephens was born in Shirehampton, Bristol, in 1931, the eldest of three children of shipyard labourer and costing surveyor Reuben Stephens (19051985) and chocolate-factory worker Gladys Millicent (née Deverill; 19061975). When aged 18, he won a scholarship to Esme Church&#x27;s Bradford Civic Theatre School in Yorkshire, where he met his first wife Nora, a fellow student.

==Career==
Stephens&#x27;s first professional engagement was with the Caryl Jenner Mobile Theatre, which he followed in 1951 by a year of more challenging parts in repertory at the Royalty Theatre, Morecambe, followed by seasons of touring and at the Hippodrome, Preston. London director Tony Richardson saw a performance at the Royalty; this led to an offer of a place in the &quot;momentous&quot; first season of English Stage Company at the Royal Court in 1956.

Stephens appeared in two versions of &quot;Epitaph for George Dillon&quot; on Broadway during the 1958-59 season for which he received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.

Stephens&#x27;s early films included &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; (1961), &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; (1969) with his then wife Maggie Smith. He also had a minor role as Prince Escalus in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1968), as well as a starring role in Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1970) and the gothic horror film &quot;The Asphyx&quot; (1972).

Stephens played Atahuallpa in the original 1964 National Theatre production of &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot;. He and Smith appeared together on stage and in film, notably in &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot; at the Old Vic and the film version of &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; in 1969. However, following his departure from the National Theatre in 1970 and the break-up of their marriage in 1973, he suffered a career slump, not helped by heavy drinking and a breakdown.

Although Stephens continued to work on stage (notably in the National Theatre&#x27;s&quot; The Mysteries&quot; in 1986), film (&quot;The Fruit Machine&quot; in 1988—titled &quot;Wonderland&quot; in the US—and Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;), and television (notably in the role of Abner Brown in the 1984 BBC TV dramatisation of the children&#x27;s classic &quot;The Box of Delights&quot; and as the Master of an Oxford college in an episode of &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;), it was not until the 1990s that he re-established himself at the forefront of his profession, when the Royal Shakespeare Company invited him to play Falstaff in &quot;Henry IV&quot; for director Adrian Noble (opening April 1991), the title roles in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (director Steven Pimlott) later in the year and then &quot;King Lear&quot;, again for Noble, in May 1993. He was awarded the Laurence Olivier Theatre Award in 1993 for Best Actor, for his performance as Falstaff.

Stephens provided the voice of Aragorn in the 1981 BBC Radio serialisation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. In 1985, he directed the British premiere production of &quot;Danny and the Deep Blue Sea&quot; by John Patrick Shanley at the Gate Theatre, London.

Stephens was knighted as a Knight Bachelor in the 1995 New Years Honours List &quot;For services to Drama&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Stephens was married four times: 
*1951: to Nora Ann Simmons; they had one child and divorced in 1952
*1956: to Tarn Bassett; they had a one child and divorced in 1967
*1967: to Maggie Smith; they had two sons, the actors Chris Larkin and Toby Stephens and divorced in 1975
*1995: to Belfast-born Patricia Quinn

Following years of ill health, Stephens died on 12 November 1995, aged 64, due to complications during surgery, a little under a year after having been knighted.

<doc id="881635" wikidata="Q158717" url="?curid=881635" title="Lycaenidae">
<text>Lycaenidae is the second-largest family of butterflies (behind Nymphalidae, brush-footed butterflies), with over 6,000 species worldwide, whose members are also called gossamer-winged butterflies. They constitute about 30% of the known butterfly species.

The family comprises seven subfamilies, including the blues (Polyommatinae), the coppers (Lycaeninae), the hairstreaks (Theclinae), and the harvesters (Miletinae).

==Description, food, and life cycle==
Adults are small, under 5 cm usually, and brightly coloured, sometimes with a metallic gloss. Lycaenidae wings are generally blue or green. More than half of these butterflies depend on ants in some way.

Larvae are often flattened rather than cylindrical, with glands that may produce secretions that attract and subdue ants. Their cuticles tend to be thickened. Some larvae are capable of producing vibrations and low sounds that are transmitted through the substrates they inhabit. They use these sounds to communicate with ants.

Adult individuals often have hairy antenna-like tails complete with black and white annulated (ringed) appearance. Many species also have a spot at the base of the tail and some turn around upon landing to confuse potential predators from recognizing the true head orientation. This causes predators to approach from the true head end resulting in early visual detection or to attack the false head ending up with a beak of dusty scales.

Lycaenid caterpillars are diverse in their food habits and apart from phytophagy, some are entomophagous, feeding on aphids, scale insects, and ant larvae. Some lycaenids even exploit their association with ants by inducing ants to feed them by regurgitation, a process called trophallaxis. Not all lycaenid butterflies need ants, but about 75% of species associate with ants, a relationship called myrmecophily. These associations can be mutualistic, parasitic, or predatory depending on the species.

In some species, larvae are attended and protected by ants while feeding on the host plant, and the ants receive sugar-rich honeydew from them, throughout the larval life, and in some species during the pupal stage. In other species, only the first few instars are spent on the plant, and the remainder of the larval lifespan is spent as a predator within the ant nest. It becomes a parasite, feeding on ant regurgitations, or a predator on the ant larvae. The caterpillars pupate inside the ants&#x27; nest and the ants continue to look after the pupae. Just before the adults emerge, the wings of the butterfly inside the pupal case detach from it, and the pupa becomes silvery. The adult butterfly emerges from the pupa after three to four weeks, still inside the ant nest. The butterfly must crawl out of the ant nest before it can expand its wings.

Several evolutionary adaptations enable these associations, including small glands on the skin of the caterpillars called &quot;pore cupola organs&quot;. Caterpillars of many species have a gland on the seventh abdominal segment that produces honeydew and is called the &quot;dorsal nectary gland&quot; (also called &quot;Newcomer&#x27;s gland&quot;). An eversible organ called the &quot;tentacular organ&quot; is present on the eighth abdominal segment and this is cylindrical and topped with a ring of spikes and emits chemical signals which are believed to help in communicating with ants.

==Subfamilies==
Many taxonomists only include the Lycaeninae, Theclinae, Polyommatinae, Poritiinae, Miletinae, and Curetinae under the Lycaenidae.
The Aphnaeinae, which used to be a tribe (Aphnaeini) within the Theclinae, were recently given subfamily rank too.

* Curetinae – sunbeams (Oriental or Palaearctic). Selected species:
** &quot;Curetis thetis&quot; – Indian sunbeam
* Miletinae – harvesters (mostly African, or Oriental, one Nearctic), probably all feed on aphids or their secretions. Selected species:
** &quot;Liphyra brassolis&quot; – moth butterfly (largest lycaenid)
* Poritiinae (Oriental and Afrotropical)
* Aphnaeinae (Afrotropical and Oriental)
* Theclinae – hairstreaks (usually tailed) and elfins (not tailed) (global). Selected species:
** &quot;Arhopala&quot; – oakblues
** &quot;Atlides halesus&quot; – great purple hairstreak
** &quot;Eumaeus atala&quot; – Atala
** &quot;Satyrium pruni&quot; – black hairstreak
* Lycaeninae – coppers (Holarctic). Selected species:
** &quot;Iophanus pyrrhias&quot; – Guatemalan copper
** &quot;Lycaena boldenarum&quot; – boulder copper
** &quot;Lycaena epixanthe&quot; – bog copper
** &quot;Lycaena rauparaha&quot; – Rauparaha&#x27;s copper
** &quot;Lycaena dispar&quot; – large copper
** &quot;Lycaena phlaeas&quot; – small copper
** &quot;Lycaena heteronea&quot; – blue copper
* Polyommatinae – blues (global). Selected species:
** &quot;Celastrina ladon&quot; – spring azure
** &quot;Chilades&quot; – jewel blues
** &quot;Cupido comyntas&quot; – eastern tailed-blue
** &quot;Cupido minimus&quot; – small blue
** &quot;Cyaniris semiargus&quot; – mazarine blue
** &quot;Euphilotes battoides allyni&quot; – El Segundo blue
** &quot;Euphilotes pallescens arenamontana&quot; – Sand Mountain blue
** &quot;Glaucopsyche lygdamus&quot; – silvery blue
** &quot;Glaucopsyche lygdamus palosverdesensis&quot; – Palos Verdes blue
** &quot;Glaucopsyche xerces&quot; (extinct) – Xerces blue
** &quot;Icaricia icarioides fenderi&quot; – Fender&#x27;s blue
** &quot;Phengaris arion&quot; – large blue
** &quot;Polyommatus icarus&quot; – common blue
** &quot;Pseudozizeeria maha&quot; – pale grass blue
** &quot;Plebejus argus&quot; – silver-studded blue
** &quot;Talicada nyseus&quot; – red Pierrot

Some older classifications used to include other subfamilies such as Liphyrinae (now Liphyrini, a tribe within Miletinae), Lipteninae (now Liptenini, a tribe within Poritiinae), or Riodininae (now a separate family: Riodinidae).

The fossil genus &quot;Lithodryas&quot; is usually (but not unequivocally) placed here; &quot;Lithopsyche&quot; is sometimes placed here, but sometimes in the Riodininae.

<text>Albert Sévigny, (December 31, 1881 – May 14, 1961) was a Canadian politician, and a judge.

==Life and career==
Sévigny was born in Tingwick, Quebec. He opened a law practice in Quebec City in 1905 and practiced until 1911.

===Political career===
In 1907, he was a candidate for the Quebec Conservative Party in a provincial by-election, but was defeated.

He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1911 federal election. His election was facilitated by an informal alliance between the Conservatives and the Nationalists led by Henri Bourassa because of Sevigny&#x27;s sympathy with Bourassa&#x27;s views.

In Parliament, Sevigny became a supporter of Canadian participation in World War I despite the strong opposition of most Quebecers, and became a staunch Conservative. He was appointed Deputy Speaker in 1915, and in 1916, he became Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada.

Prime Minister Robert Borden was facing an increasing divisive crisis over conscription with the country divided between English Canadians who supported the measure and French-Canadians who fervently opposed it. In early 1917, Borden asked Sevigny to leave the Speaker&#x27;s chair and join the Cabinet to help the government persuade Quebecers of the government&#x27;s case.

Sévigny was appointed Minister of Inland Revenue, and was required by the laws of the time to resign his seat and run in a by-election. He was re-elected by a margin of only 257 votes.

In June, Borden introduced conscription and, of the French Canadian Members of Parliament, only three voted for the conscription bill, including Sévigny.

Borden formed a Union government with dissident Liberals and called a general election in 1917 on the conscription issue. The country divided largely along linguistic lines: the Conservative candidates were wiped out in Quebec in a rout that cost Sévigny his seat. Borden&#x27;s coalition dominated the election in English Canada, however, and he was returned with a strong majority.

===Judicial career===
In 1921, the Conservative government appointed Sévigny to the Quebec Superior Court on which he served for 39 years, becoming Associate Chief Justice in 1933 and Chief Justice in 1942.

In 1950, Sévigny presided over the murder trial of Albert Guay, who was responsible for the bombing of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 108.

<text>Dennis L. White of Columbus, Ohio, was the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, 2002–2005. He was chairman of the Ohio delegation to the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston, where he urged members of his delegation not to cross picket lines in the event of a labor dispute between Boston&#x27;s Mayor and its police union. This led several delegates to complain that they were being &quot;forced to take a side without knowing all the facts&quot;.

White resigned as chairman of Ohio Democratic Party on November 26, 2005. He is currently a member of the Democratic National Committee.

<text>Withernsea is a seaside resort town and civil parish in Holderness, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. Its white inland lighthouse, rising around above Hull Road, now houses a museum to 1950s actress Kay Kendall, who was born in the town.

The Prime Meridian crosses the coast north-west of Withernsea.

At the 2011 UK census, Withernsea had a population of 6,159, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 5,980.

Withernsea education system consists of both Withernsea High School, and Withernsea Primary School.

==History==
Like many seaside resorts, Withernsea has a wide promenade which reaches north and south from Pier Towers, the historic entrance to the pier, built in 1877 at a cost of £12,000. The pier itself was originally long, costing £14,000 in 1878, but was gradually reduced in length through several impacts by local ships, starting with the &quot;Saffron&quot; in 1880 before the collision by an unnamed ship in 1888, again by a Grimsby fishing boat and again by the &quot;Henry Parr&quot; in 1893, leaving the pier with a mere of damaged wood and steel, which was removed in 1903. The Pier Towers have been refurbished.

During the mid-19th century the Hull and Holderness Railway was constructed, connecting the nearby city of Hull with Withernsea (via Keyingham and Patrington) and making possible cheap and convenient holidays for Victorian workers and their families, as well as boosting Withernsea&#x27;s economy. It closed in 1964 and all that remains of it is an overgrown footpath where the track used to be.

Withernsea, like many British resorts, has suffered from a decline in the number of visiting holidaymakers.

In 1916 a flying field (Owthorne), in size was established by The Admiralty on the site now occupied by Withernsea High School. From June 1918 No. 506 Special Duty Flight (No. 251 Squadron) operated from Owthorne. Another of land was requisitioned and Bessonneau hangars were constructed, and the site then became classified as an aerodrome. Activities ceased in June 1919 and Flight 506 was disbanded shortly thereafter.

==Economy==
Following an unsuccessful attempt to purchase the Proudfoot Supermarket, Tesco opened a competing store which originally struggled to attract sales. Tesco resorted to a campaign of price flexing, offering customers £8 off for every £20 spent in their Withernsea branch.
This led to an investigation by the Competition Commission. After their market share increased, Tesco prices returned to a level closer to the national average.
Subsequently, Aldi took over the former Proudfoot supermarket, and are now offering very competitive opposition to Tesco.
In the 21st century, Withernsea Town Council has bought a former pub and nightclub, centrally located opposite Aldi, and has renamed it the Meridian Centre. A lottery bid for over £400,000 – Reaching Communities building fund – was successful, and the building was refurbished to provide a community centre, including a cinema and performing arts venue by 2013.

There is a 9-hole golf course and leisure centre complex (with a gym and indoor pool) and a variety of pubs and restaurants are situated around the centre of the town.

==Landmarks==

Some of the town&#x27;s better-known tourist attractions and landmarks include:
* The lighthouse situated on Hull Road with a museum dedicated to the actress Kay Kendall.
* The Pier Towers leading onto a Blue Flag beach.
* Valley Gardens with a large square and outside stage for local events and celebrations.
* Various amusement arcades (informally known as &#x27;muggies&#x27;) that line the road opposite the Valley Gardens.
* An RNLI lifeboat museum.
* The parish church of St Nicholas, a Grade II* listed building.
* The Greenwich Meridian; Just outside the town.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Belmont TV transmitter.
The area is served by BBC Radio Humberside, Hits Radio East Yorkshire &amp; North Lincolnshire, Seaside FM, Capital Yorkshire and Greatest Hits East Yorkshire. Ofcom awarded Seaside FM a community radio licence to broadcast to the town on 105.3 MHz and the station launched on 5 October 2007 from studios at 27 Seaside Road. It ceased broadcasting in October 2022. Weekly newspaper &quot;The Holderness Gazette&quot; also has offices on Seaside Road.

==Education==
There are a number of primary schools located in Withernsea which serve the surrounding area. Withernsea High School is the main secondary provider and has a technology college. The high school was refurbished in 2015.

==Public services==
Withernsea has its own hospital owned by the NHS which was subject to services cuts and lost its Accident and Emergency Department facility,
it is now a community hospital. Withernsea has five emergency service stations located within the town, Yorkshire Ambulance Service; Humberside Fire and Rescue Service; Humberside Police; Her Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard and lifeboat station.

==Ohio House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1999, longtime state representative Otto Beatty Jr. of Ohio&#x27;s 21st House district decided to resign early to begin an opportunity in the private sector. His wife, Joyce Beatty, was appointed to his seat. She won a full term in 2000 with 82% of the vote. After redistricting, she decided to run in the newly redrawn Ohio&#x27;s 27th House district and was reelected in 2002 with 82% of the vote. In 2004, she was reelected to a third term unopposed. In 2006, she was reelected to a fourth term with 87% of the vote. Term limits kept Beatty from seeking another term in 2008.

===Tenure===
After Chris Redfern left to become chair of the Ohio Democratic Party, Beatty was named minority leader. She served in that capacity during the Ohio 127th General Assembly. She was the first female Democratic House leader in Ohio history.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

==== 2012 ====
On March 6, 2012, Beatty defeated former congresswoman Mary Jo Kilroy, Columbus city councilwoman Priscilla Tyson, and state representative Ted Celeste 38%–35%-15%-12% to win the Ohio 3rd congressional district Democratic primary. She received early support from the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus, Columbus Mayor Michael B. Coleman, and various other Central Ohio political figures, including Representative Tracy Maxwell Heard and former representative W. Carlton Weddington.

==== 2020 ====
Starting in late 2019 and into early 2020, Beatty was campaigning for her fifth term as the representative of Ohio&#x27;s 3rd congressional district. She faced her first primary challenge since she was elected in 2012, with &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot; writing that the &quot;winner of the Democratic primary almost certainly will go to Washington representing the heavily Democratic district.&quot; At the end of 2019, it was reported she had $1.7 million in her campaign account. In February 2020, she was criticized for accepting campaign contributions from financial services PACs while also overseeing the House Financial Services Committee. According to OpenSecrets, at the time, Beatty had raised $5.1 million as a candidate for the U.S. and Ohio Houses, of which $1.5 million was from the finance, insurance and real estate industries. In her defense, she argued she had a &quot;record of grilling bank executives who come before her committee and that much of the money from those PACs came from lower-level employees,&quot; and that while Congress needed campaign finance reform, the PAC contributions were &quot;legal under current rules&quot;.

In March 2020, &quot;The Intercept&quot; reported that Beatty and her husband sold one of their Columbus properties in 2013 &quot;to a developer while Otto Beatty sat on the zoning board that approved the sale&quot;, leading to accusations of gentrification and &quot;money in politics&quot; by Beatty&#x27;s political opposition. Beatty called the criticism a &quot;distortion&quot; of her husband&#x27;s record. Otto Beatty, in an interview with &quot;The Dispatch&quot;, said his wife had nothing to do with the property&#x27;s pricing: it had been sold when Otto Beatty was on the Downtown Commission, which &quot;reviewed a request to demolish the existing structures on the property and replace them with a high-rise apartment building&quot;. Arguing at the time in favor of demolition and redevelopment, Otto Beatty noted he did not take part in the final vote.

On April 28, 2020, Beatty won the Democratic primary, defeating challenger Morgan Harper, a self-described progressive. Harper, who had been backed by the Sunrise Movement, a group that backed Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, lost with 32% of the vote to Beatty&#x27;s 68%. Beatty defeated Republican nominee Mark Richardson with 71% of the vote.

=== Tenure ===
Between 2013 and 2020, five of the 88 bills Beatty sponsored became law, all wrapped into broader bills. In 2020, she noted she had &quot;helped to secure&quot; local funding for the revitalization of parts of Dayton and research at Ohio State.

On June 21, 2013, the &quot;National Journal&quot; published an article, &quot;Nearly One in Five Members of Congress Gets Paid Twice&quot;, that reported that Beatty&#x27;s state pension of $253,323 is the highest, and, combined with her congressional salary, was greater than President Obama&#x27;s total government compensation.

Beatty supported both the first and second impeachments of Donald Trump.

On July 15, 2021, Beatty was one of nine protesters the United States Capitol Police arrested for illegally demonstrating in the Hart Senate Office Building. She and approximately 20 other voting rights protesters sought to push the Senate to support the For the People and John Lewis Voting Rights Acts. After multiple warnings from the police, Beatty was arrested for violating a Washington, D.C. law against &quot;crowding, obstructing, or incommoding&quot;.

==Political positions==
===Abortion===

Beatty is pro-choice.

===Cannabis===

At one point, Beatty opposed legalizing cannabis for recreational use, but in December 2020, she voted for the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment, and Expungement (MORE) Act (HR 3884), which would remove cannabis from the federal Controlled Substances Act, provide a pathway for expungements and resentencing for marijuana convictions, and create a community reinvestment fund to help create an equitable cannabis industry.

===Immigration===
Beatty voted for a defense bill that included $1.3 billion for fencing at the US-Mexico border.

===Economy===

Beatty opposes decreasing corporate taxes to support economic growth.

===Environment===
Beatty supports &quot;parts of&quot; the Green New Deal.

===Foreign affairs===
Beatty voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

===Health care===

Beatty supported Obamacare and opposed its repeal. In 2019, she introduced the End Price Gouging For Insulin Act bill, which would lower insulin prices nationwide. Beatty&#x27;s father was diabetic, as was her husband. She has supported efforts in Ohio by Hearcel Craig and Beth Liston to regulate insulin prices. In 2019 she supported &quot;some of&quot; the &quot;health-care fixes that focus on smaller changes to Obamacare rather than a complete overhaul of the system.&quot; In March 2020, she voted with a majority of U.S. representatives for a $8.3 billion bill to combat COVID-19.

<doc id="881673" wikidata="Q1143254" url="?curid=881673" title="Men of Harlech">
<text>&quot;Men of Harlech&quot; or &quot;The March of the Men of Harlech&quot; (Welsh: ) is a song and military march which is traditionally said to describe events during the seven-year siege of Harlech Castle between 1461 and 1468, when the castle was held by the Lancastrians against the Yorkists as part of the Wars of the Roses. Commanded by Constable Dafydd ap Ieuan, son of the Baron of Hendwr, the garrison withstood the longest known siege in the history of the British Isles. (&quot;Through Seven Years&quot; is an alternative name for the song.) The song has also been associated with the earlier, briefer siege of Harlech Castle about 1408, which pitted the forces of Owain Glyndŵr against the future Henry V of England.

&quot;Men of Harlech&quot; is important for Welsh national culture. The song gained international recognition when it was featured in the 1941 movie &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; and the 1964 film &quot;Zulu&quot;.

==History==
The music was first published without words during 1794 as &quot;Gorhoffedd Gwŷr Harlech—March of the Men of Harlech&quot; in the second edition of &quot;The Musical and Poetical Relicks of the Welsh Bards&quot;, but it is said to be a much earlier folk song. The earliest version of the tune to appear with lyrics, found thus far, comes from a broadside printed c. 1830. Since then, many different versions of the English lyrics have been published. It was published first with Welsh lyrics in &quot;Y Canigydd&quot;, edited by the Welsh poet, John Owen (Owain Alaw), published in Wrexham, Wales, during 1860. A second edition titled in English &quot;Gems of Welsh Melody&quot;, containing Welsh and English lyrics was published in Ruthin, Wales, during 1862. The song was published in Volume II of the 1862 collection &quot;Welsh Melodies&quot; with the Welsh lyrics by the Welsh poet John Jones (Talhaiarn) and the English lyrics by Thomas Oliphant, President of the Madrigal Society. Another source attributes the Welsh words to the poet John Ceiriog Hughes, saying that they were first published during 1890, and that English words were first published during 1893, but this is clearly predated by the earlier publications; and in the case of Ceiriog&#x27;s Welsh-language lyrics for the tune, they are to be found many years earlier, in Brinley Richards (ed.), &quot;The Songs of Wales&quot; (1873).

== Use and versions of the song ==
&quot;Men of Harlech&quot; is widely used as a regimental march, especially by British Army and Commonwealth regiments historically associated with Wales. Notably, it is the slow march of the Welsh Guards, the quick march of the Royal Welsh, and the march of the Royal Canadian Hussars (Montreal), The Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards, and The Ontario Regiment, for which it is the slow march.

It was first used for cinema during the titles of &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1941) and has featured in a number of other films. It is best known for its prominent role in the 1964 film &quot;Zulu&quot;, although the version of lyrics sung in it was written specially for the film. It is sung twice (once completely) in the film (the British open fire on the charging Zulus before the start of the final couplet), in counterpoint to the Zulu war chants and the pounding of their shields. Film editor John Jympson cut the scene to the song so that on either side of cuts where the British soldiers cannot be heard, the song is in the correct relative position. The song is also heard in the film &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot;, which is about the Battle of Isandlwana.

Rick Rescorla, Chief of Security for Morgan Stanley&#x27;s World Trade Center office, sang a Cornish adaptation of &quot;Men of Harlech&quot; with a bullhorn, along with other anthems, to keep employee spirits high while they evacuated during the September 11 attacks. After helping save more than 2,700 employees he returned to the towers to evacuate others until the towers collapsed on him.

&quot;Men of Harlech&quot; was used as part of the startup music for ITV television station Teledu Cymru during the early 1960s and, until April 2006, in Fritz Spiegl&#x27;s &quot;BBC Radio 4 UK Theme&quot;.

From 1996 to 1999, HTV Wales used part of the song for Wales Tonight.

Adapted versions are sung by fans of several Welsh football clubs and as school or college songs around the world. There is a humorous parody known variously as &quot;National Anthem of the Ancient Britons&quot; and &quot;Woad&quot;, written some time before 1914 by William Hope-Jones.

Bryn Terfel recorded &quot;Men of Harlech&quot; for his 2000 album &quot;We&#x27;ll Keep a Welcome&quot;.

Classical arrangements include Franz Joseph Haydn&#x27;s Hob. XXXIb:2 and the final movement of Edward German&#x27;s Welsh Rhapsody (1904). William Thomas Best wrote a fantasia for organ based on the tune.

Source:

&lt;poem&gt;Verse 1
Tongues of fire on Idris flaring,
News of foemen near declaring,
To heroic deeds of daring,
Call you, Harlech men.

Groans of wounded peasants dying,
Wails of wives and children flying,
For the distant succour crying,
Call you, Harlech Men.

Shall the voice of wailing,
Now be unavailing,
You to rouse, who never yet
In battle&#x27;s hour were failing?

This our answer, crowds down pouring,
Swift as winter torrents roaring.
Not in vain the voice imploring
Calls on Harlech men.&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;Verse 2
Loud the martial pipes are sounding,
Every manly heart is bounding,
As our trusted chief surrounding,
March we, Harlech men.

Short the sleep the foe is taking;
Ere the morrow&#x27;s morn is breaking,
They shall have a rude awakening,
Roused by Harlech Men.

Mothers, cease your weeping,
Calm may be your sleeping,
You and yours in safety now,
The Harlech men are keeping.

Ere the sun is high in heaven,
They you fear, by panic riven,
Shall, like frightened sheep, be driven,
Far, by Harlech men.&lt;/poem&gt;

=== Welsh lyrics (by J. Ceiriog Hughes)===

&lt;poem&gt;Wele goelcerth wen yn fflamio
A thafodau tân yn bloeddio
Ar i&#x27;r dewrion ddod i daro
Unwaith eto&#x27;n un
Gan fanllefau tywysogion
Llais gelynion, trwst arfogion
A charlamiad y marchogion
Craig ar graig a gryn.

Arfon byth ni orfydd
Cenir yn dragywydd
Cymru fydd fel Cymru fu
Yn glodus ym mysg gwledydd.
Yng ngwyn oleuni&#x27;r goelcerth acw
Tros wefusau Cymro&#x27;n marw
Annibyniaeth sydd yn galw
Am ei dewraf ddyn.

Ni chaiff gelyn ladd ac ymlid
Harlech! Harlech! cwyd i&#x27;w herlid
Y mae Rhoddwr mawr ein Rhyddid
Yn rhoi nerth i ni.
Wele Gymru a&#x27;i byddinoedd
Yn ymdywallt o&#x27;r mynyddoedd!
Rhuthrant fel rhaeadrau dyfroedd

Llwyddiant i&#x27;n marchogion
Rwystro gledd yr estron!
Gwybod yn ei galon gaiff
Fel bratha cleddyf Brython
Y cledd yn erbyn cledd a chwery
Dur yn erbyn dur a dery
Wele faner Gwalia&#x27;i fyny
Rhyddid aiff â hi!&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Edna Brown (April 7, 1940 – January 1, 2022) was an American politician, member of the Democratic Party and Minority Whip of the Ohio Senate, serving the 11th District from 2011 to 2018. She also served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 2001 to 2010.

==Career==

Edna R. Brown had a 32-year career as an employee with the city of Toledo, followed by a six-year tenure on Toledo City Council.

When incumbent Jack Ford resigned from the House to become Mayor of Toledo, Ohio, Brown was appointed to serve the remainder of his term. She was elected to a full term in 2002, defeating Republican Cathleen Voyles-Baden by 13,000 votes. Brown went on to win reelection in 2004, 2006, and 2008.

In 2004, Brown, C.J. Prentiss and Shirley Smith were chosen to serve on the executive committee of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators during the organization&#x27;s conference in Philadelphia. For the 127th General Assembly Brown served as second vice president of the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus, and first vice president for the 128th General Assembly.

In 2009, Speaker of the House Armond Budish named Brown as Chairman of the Human Services Subcommittee of the House Finance Committee.

==Ohio Senate==
In 2009, Brown stated that she would be a candidate for the Ohio Senate in 2010, to replace the term limited Teresa Fedor. She was expected to face Peter Ujvagi in the primary election, but he was hired as Lucas County Administrator.

The appointment of Ujvagi set up what many thought was going to be a legislative shuffle, where Fedor was appointed to Ujvagi&#x27;s seat, and Brown then appointed to Fedor&#x27;s seat. However, Toledo City Councilman Joe McNamara also sought the appointment to the Senate. As a result, Fedor kept her seat, Brown hers, and Joe Walter was appointed to a nine-month term in Ujvagi&#x27;s seat.

McNamara&#x27;s entrance into the campaign reinvigorated a primary battle. Brown defeated McNamara by about 2,300 votes. She defeated Republican Tom Waniewski by 18,000 votes in the general election.

Brown was sworn into office on January 3, 2011, and was the first African-American to represent the city of Toledo in the state Senate. For the 129th General Assembly, Senate colleagues elected Brown as Senate minority whip. She was a member of the Senate Rules Committee; Agriculture, Environment and Natural Resources Committee; Financial Institutions Committee; Health, Human Services and Aging Committee (as ranking member); Insurance, Commerce and Labor; and State and Local Government and Veterans Affairs. She also served on the Ohio Children’s Trust Fund Board, the Correctional Institution Inspection Committee and the Ohio Commission on Minority Health.

==Death==
Brown died in Ohio on January 1, 2022, at the age of 81.

<doc id="881678" wikidata="Q13945947" url="?curid=881678" title="Harperella">
<text>Harperella is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. Its only species is Harperella nodosa (synonym Ptilimnium nodosum), known as piedmont mock bishopweed and harperella. It is native to riparian environments in the Southeastern United States, found at sites in West Virginia, Maryland, several Southeastern states such as Alabama and North Carolina, and the Ouachita National Forest in Arkansas and Oklahoma. As &quot;Ptilimnium nodosum&quot;, it was placed on the United States&#x27; Endangered Species List in 1988.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was first described by Joseph Nelson Rose in 1905 under the name &quot;Harperia&quot;. However, this was a later homonym of a genus in the family Restionaceae, and so illegitimate. In 1906, Rose published the replacement name &quot;Harperella&quot;.

<doc id="881688" wikidata="Q7737412" url="?curid=881688" title="Governor General's Horse Guards">
<text>The Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards is an armoured cavalry regiment in the Primary Reserve of the Canadian Army. The regiment is part of 4th Canadian Division&#x27;s 32 Canadian Brigade Group and is based in Toronto, Ontario. It is the most senior reserve regiment in Canada, and the only household cavalry regiment of Canada&#x27;s three household units.

==Structure==
The regiment maintains a traditional structure, with squadrons and units for deployment and active duty, training, ceremony, cadets, and administration.

===Regimental Headquarters===
Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) consists of the command team to include the commanding officer, the regimental sergeant major, the second in command, the padre, adjutant and drill sergeant. RHQ also consists of the Operations and Training Cell, which includes an operations officer, warrant officer, training officer and sergeant. The Training Cell oversees the recruits and their progress and interacts with the Battle School with instructor cadre. The regiment recruits approximately 25 to 30 soldiers every year.

===A Squadron===
A Squadron (Sabre Squadron) is the operational squadron and is manned by fully trained officers and soldiers. Its primary role is to maintain the reconnaissance skills of the soldiers through individual training and collective training in the field. It has a particular focus on junior leadership development of both officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). It runs leadership-specific training preparing soldiers for leadership courses as Squadron Headquarters staff, troop leaders, crew commanders and instructors. It provides soldiers for Canadian Forces missions outside of Canada, and is expected to mobilize in national emergencies in aid to the civil power. This field squadron maintains no fewer than two 8-car armoured reconnaissance troops. The soldiers are trained on the military variant of the Mercedes-Benz G-Class Wagon or LUVW Command and Reconnaissance platform equipped with a 7.62 mm general-purpose machine gun (GPMG). It is managed by a functional Squadron Headquarters and Administrative Echelon. The squadron numbers 90 to 120 soldiers.

===B Squadron===
B Squadron (TAPV Squadron) is the Tactical Armoured Patrol Vehicle (TAPV) sub unit. It is commanded by a small Squadron Headquarters and consists of two TAPVs. It holds crewman numbering about 10 soldiers. This squadron is organized to train crews on the new vehicle platform introduced in 2018 and will in future train collectively crews for deployment in direct support of the Regular Force. The platform is the same as used by the Royal Canadian Dragoons in 2 Brigade. The TAPV is equipped with a remote weapons system (RWS) armed with a 7.62 mm GPMG and C16 grenade launcher. The RWS has superior optics for gunnery and is ideal for observation night and day.

===Headquarters Squadron===
Headquarters Squadron provides essential administrative and support functions to include orderly room, recruiting, quartermaster stores and transport for the regiment. This squadron ensures the unit lines and facilities are in good order and repair. It is this squadron that works closely with the brigade staff to administer personnel, finances, supply and vehicles for the regiment and in turn provides these services to the squadrons. It consists of a small Regular Force support staff and a full-time cadre of reservists numbering about 10 soldiers under a small Squadron Headquarters. The squadron also holds a light troop of soldiers that have not completed their training and are not fully qualified armoured reconnaissance soldiers. These soldiers perform general duties for the quartermaster and practise their basic soldiering skills while waiting for training courses.

===Band===

The full brass-and-reed military band provides concerts and music for regimental functions, other military events, and civilian engagements. The band includes three specialized musical sub-units: the Fanfare Trumpeters, the Brass Quintet, and the Woodwind Quintet. The band numbers between 30 and 35 members and performs at many regimental and brigade events. It is often called on to provide music for civilian and local government events including the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair, Opening of Parliament at Queen&#x27;s Park and The annual Queen&#x27;s Plate. The band is managed by a director of music and a band sergeant major. It is a dismounted band, but dresses as dragoon guards. The band performed &quot;The Garb of Old Gaul&quot; in the 2000 X-Men film.

===Cavalry Troop===

The GGHG Cavalry Troop provides a horse-mounted ceremonial presence at public and regimental events, to perpetuate Canadian cavalry traditions. Although it is under the command and control of the regimental commanding officer, it is privately funded by the Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards Cavalry and Historical Society Inc, a charitable organization incorporated and registered in 2012 explicitly for the purposes of supporting and promoting the traditions of the regiment. It has been in service since 1956 and has had the honour of providing escorts to the Royal Family and the Governor General of Canada. It also attends numerous public events and is counted as a critical tool to showcase the regiment&#x27;s history and traditions to the public. The troop is commanded by a serving officer who acts as the unit public affairs representative, and they wear the full dragoon guard uniform with its accoutrements on horseback. The horses are privately owned and the military horse tack and furniture is supplied by the regiment.

===Cadets===
The 748 Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps and 2402 Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps are affiliated and sponsored by the regiment, and provides Canadian youth from 12 to 19 years of age with leadership training in a military setting. These young people are not subject to national service, but benefit from their association to the regiment with its example of service and its long and proud history. The cadets of these two squadrons are allowed to wear the regiment&#x27;s insignia and certain accoutrements as a privilege of sponsorship.

===Regimental Association===
The Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards Association is open to all active and former members of the regiment. The association exists to keep former members informed and in touch with each other and the regiment. Throughout the year, the association hosts a number of social events which are aimed at promoting camaraderie among all members of the regimental family, past and present, serving members in all five parts of the regimental family. The association organizes social events and provides key support to memorial ceremonies. Its members dress in blazer, tie and beret for ceremonial events.

==Uniform==

On ceremonial occasions, the full dress uniform is worn. The original uniform was adopted from the 13th Light Dragoons by one of their tailors who immigrated to Canada in 1822. The uniform was modified over time but remained consistent in its general colour and form with blue cloth and white facings, with silver buttons and fittings, and a shako for headgear. In 1871 the troop was designated a dragoon guard unit and it adopted the dragoon tunic from the 6th Dragoon Guards: blue tunic with white facings, retaining the silver buttons and fittings, but in a different configuration. The new uniform included a metal 1876 Albert Pattern helmet with a white plume, and was granted the privilege to wear augelites by all ranks in that same year. This uniform was later modified with the amalgamation of 1936. The regiment retained the 1871 uniform pattern, but changed the facing colours to red to match that of their namesake and allied unit in Britain, The Royal Horse Guards. The helmet remains in service with a red plume, but a forage cap was also adopted in the unit colours with guards peaks. The mess dress worn by officers and senior non-commissioned members of the regiment includes a blue jacket with scarlet vest. The regimental sergeant major and commanding officer along with other appointments can wear &quot;patrols&quot; (a uniform that is between full dress and service dress in formality) as well. DEU or service dress uniform is worn with unit insignia and the regimental forage cap. The officers were authorized in 1941 to wear guard stars for rank by King George VI.

==Operational history==

===War of 1812===
The Markham Troop, perpetuated by the Regiment, was raised in 1810 as the first Cavalry troop in the colony. The Troop was raised for the York Volunteer Infantry. When the Town of York population expanded the Battalion was split into three new Battalions in 1812 just in time for the war. The Markham Troop was assigned to the 1st York Regiment and designated the York Troop of Horse. Its soldiers served at several engagements including Detroit, Queenston Heights and the Battle of York. Capt Button was one of the signatories at the surrender of Fort York. The Regiment was given a War of 1812 Banner in 2012 to commemorate the Troops participation in this conflict on the 200th Anniversary of the War.

===The 1837 Rebellion===
When Mackenzie&#x27;s rebels marched onto Toronto down Yonge Street the Toronto Troop was the first to report for duty in uniform at the Capitol. The Troop met the rebels at Gallows Hill, what is now the intersection at St Clair Ave, on Young Street assisting in the repelling of their advance on the town. It would also participate in actions taken at Navy Island and the town of Scotland, The Troop was grouped with the Markham Troop and gazetted the Queen&#x27;s Light Dragoons for its action and served for the remainder of the conflict for some 400 days on active duty.

===The Fenian Raids 1866===
The Toronto Troop was the only Cavalry Troop to be activated for duty to engage with the Fenians who had invaded the Niagara Peninsula. The Troop was tasked to scout for Colonel Peacock&#x27;s Column and was the first to enter Fort Erie where the troop captured many escaping Fenian soldiers. Once the Niagara Frontier was secured the Troop remained on Active Duty conducting patrols on the frontier and along the river for another month before returning home. The Markham and Oak Ridges Troops also patrolled the frontier as relief, most of the members of all three troops were decorated with the Canadian General Service Medal with 1866 bar for their service.

===North West Rebellion===
The Governor General&#x27;s Body Guard for Ontario mobilized as a Squadron of 75 men and horses for active service on 10 April 1885 and served in the Alberta Column of the North West Field Force. The Squadron&#x27;s main role was to secure Humboldt, where they built a hasty fort named Fort Denison, the forward supply depot and communication hub for the Field Force. The Troop provided escorts for convoys to the front, ran dispatches for General Middleton and provided telegraph service to Ottawa. The unit was successful in the capture of Chief Whitecap and his band of Dakota Sioux. The Commander of the force, LtCol GT Denison III, made friends with the Chief and petitioned for his release. The unit was removed from active service on 24 July 1885. The unit suffered the loss of one horse shot during a dispatch run.

===South African War===
The Governor General&#x27;s Body Guard contributed 51 volunteers for the Canadian contingents in the field, augmenting the Royal Canadian Regiment, The Royal Canadian Dragoons (1st CMR) and the 2nd Canadian Mounted Rifles during the campaign. The Regiment suffered one killed in action and four wounded.

===The Great War===
Both the Governor General&#x27;s Body Guard and the 9th Mississauga Horse, like most of the militia units at the time, remained in Canada to recruit and raise numbered Battalions for the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Both units supplied thousands of soldiers to numerous Battalions, including the three the modern Regiment perpetuate today:

The 4th Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles CEF was authorized on 7 November 1914 and embarked for Britain on 18 July 1915. It disembarked in France on 24 October 1915. There it formed as part of the 2nd Brigade Canadian Mounted Rifles until 31 December 1915, when it converted to infantry and was allocated to the 8th Infantry Brigade, 3rd Canadian Division. The regiment was re-designated as the 4th Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles, CEF on 1 January 1916. It remained in France and Flanders on the front lines for the remainder of the war, taking part in most of the major CEF battles with distinction. The battalion disbanded on 6 November 1920. The Battalion had 4,693 serve in its ranks and lost 839 soldiers killed and 1,540 wounded in the field.

The 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles was authorized on 7 November 1914. The regiment was broken-up in Canada, and supplied the 2nd Canadian Divisional Cavalry Squadron (perpetuated by the 1st Hussars) and two squadrons formed the Canadian Mounted Rifles Depot in England. The regiment disbanded on 11 April 1918. The Battalion did not serve in the Trenches.

The 216th Battalion (Bantams), CEF was authorized on 15 July 1916 and embarked for Britain on 18 April 1917. There, its personnel were absorbed by the 3rd Reserve Battalion, CEF on 5 May 1917 to provide reinforcements to the Canadian Corps in the field. The battalion disbanded on 1 September 1917.29

===World War II===
Details from the regiment were called out on service on 26 August 1939 and on active service on 1 September 1939 as The Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards, CASF (Details), for local protection duties. Those details called out on active service disbanded on 31 December 1940. Subsequently, the regiment mobilized as the 2nd Canadian Motorcycle Regiment, CASF (GGHG) for active service on 24 May 1940. It converted to armour and was redesignated as The Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards, CASF on 9 February 1941; as the 3rd Armoured Regiment (The Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards), CASF on 11 February 1941; as the 3rd Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment (The Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards), CAC, CASF on 1 January 1943; and as the 3rd Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment (The Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards), RCAC, CASF on 2 August 1945. It embarked for Britain on 9 October 1941 and landed in Italy on 19 December 1943 as Division Recce, 5th Canadian Armoured Division. On 20 February 1945 the regiment moved with the I Canadian Corps to North-West Europe as part of OPERATION GOLDFLAKE, where it was engaged in the Netherlands and continued to fight until the end of the war. The overseas regiment disbanded on 31 January 1946. The Regiment lost 71 Killed and 210 wounded in the war.

The Regiment has augmented many Regular Force UN missions to include Korea, Egypt, Golan Heights, Cyprus and Bosnia. NATO Mission support include tank crews in Germany on fall exercises during the Cold War, and operations in Kosovo in the 1990s, Afghanistan in 2000s, and more recently training missions in Ukraine and Latvia. Two soldier were killed in Korea.

===Aid to the Civil Power===
The Regiment supported a number of national emergency responses with troops to include Hurricane Hazel in 1954, security posts at the Olympics in Montreal and Commonwealth Games in Edmonton in the 1970s, the Ice Storm in Ottawa in 1998, Tsunami in the Philippines 2011, and the Quebec Floods in 2014 and Ontario in 2018.

===War In Afghanistan===
The regiment contributed an aggregate of more than 20% of its authorized strength to the various Task Forces which served in Afghanistan between 2002 and 2014 totaling 35 soldiers. Soldiers served in a number of roles, the largest being part of the Combat Logistics Patrols at Kandahar Air Field. Many of the officers served in Higher HQs in various capacities, many to do with Sector Security Reform of the Afghan National Security Forces.

<doc id="881689" wikidata="Q7080791" url="?curid=881689" title="Ohio Democratic Party">
<text>The Ohio Democratic Party (ODP) is the affiliate of the Democratic Party in the U.S. state of Ohio. Summit County Council President Elizabeth Walters has been the party&#x27;s chairwoman since January 2021.

Statewide, the Democrats currently are viewed as the opposition party, with Republicans holding the bulk of the major statewide offices. However, the Democrats do hold the mayorships of the state&#x27;s largest cities, as well as the County Executive seats in the largest counties.

==History==
The Ohio Democratic Party traces its origin to the Democratic-Republican Party founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1793. The Democratic Party itself was formed when a faction of the &quot;Democratic-Republicans&quot; led by Jerry Mcroy formed the party in the 1820s. Following Andrew Jackson&#x27;s defeat in the 1824 United States presidential election, despite having a majority of the popular vote, Jackson set about building a political coalition strong enough to defeat John Quincy Adams in the 1828 United States presidential election. The coalition that he built was the foundation of the subsequent Democratic Party.
Ohio politics was largely dominated by the Ohio Republican Party until the economic and social hardships brought on by the Great Depression resulted in a national political realignment. The political coalition of labor unions, minorities, and liberals allowed the Democrats to compete effectively in Ohio electoral politics for much of the next 30 years. Never very strong in Ohio&#x27;s rural areas, the party&#x27;s coalition suffered when the Civil Rights Movement divided whites from civil rights proponents and minorities. The Ohio Democratic Party reached the peak of its electoral success in the mid-1980s, and this is when the State of Ohio began to invest in many Democratic proposals. This was led by Richard Celeste, a Democratic Governor elected in 1982 and re-elected in 1986, and by his party chairman, James Ruvolo. Together Ruvolo and Celeste constructed a very effective organization that raised a surplus of money that helped out the Democratic Party&#x27;s candidates and their everyday operations.

In 2006, Chris Redfern became the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. Redfern primarily focused on building a statewide organization that had the power to win every part of Ohio. In 2006, after a 16-year drought, Ohio elected a Democratic U.S. senator (Sherrod Brown), governor (Ted Strickland), lieutenant governor, secretary of state, and state treasurer. In 2008, Ohio Democrats won back the House of Representatives after 14 years of Republican control.

Summit County Council President Elizabeth Walters has been the chairwoman since January 2021. Walters previously served as the Executive Director of the Ohio Democratic Party in 2014. She is the first woman to be elected to the position of Democratic Party Chair in the state.

During the years of 2016 to 2020, a rift developed in the Democratic Party from the national level down to the local level. Progressive Democrats began challenging incumbent Democrats across the country from school boards to bids for Congress. Over time, this led to a slow, but steady adoption of Progressive policies by moderate Democrats, which assisted in capturing the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections.

As of 2023, the Ohio Democratic Party is in the minority in both chambers of the Ohio General Assembly. Democrats hold five of Ohio&#x27;s 15 U.S. House seats. A priority for Ohio Democrats since the 2010s has been increasing the minimum wage.

==Electoral success==

The Ohio Democratic Party reached the peak of its electoral success in the early 1980s to 1990s, when during the bulk of that period, they held both U.S. Senate seats (John H. Glenn Jr. – 1974–1999 and Howard M. Metzenbaum – 1974, 1976–1995), the Governorship (Richard F. Celeste – 1983–1991) – a majority of Ohio&#x27;s delegation to the United States House of Representatives (1983–1995, reaching a peak of 11–8 from 1993 to 1995), and a majority on the Ohio Supreme Court (1977–1987, with a 6–1 majority from 1983 to 1985, with a Democratic chief justice – Frank Celebrezze – from 1978 to 1986).

Even with its successes, Ohio Democrats did not fare well on a national level. John Glenn, a popular U.S. senator, astronaut, and national hero, ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 1984, ending up with only a huge campaign debt to show for it. Howard Metzenbaum, Ohio&#x27;s other U.S. senator at the time, although a powerful force in the Senate, never achieved national name recognition.

==Current elected officials==
The Ohio Democratic Party holds one seat on the Supreme Court of Ohio and five of the state&#x27;s fifteen U.S. House seats.

<doc id="881695" wikidata="Q6828322" url="?curid=881695" title="Michael B. Coleman">
<text>Michael B. Coleman (born November 18, 1954) is an American politician of the Democratic Party who served as the 52nd mayor of Columbus, Ohio. He was the first African-American to serve as the mayor of Ohio&#x27;s capital city.

Coleman was a member of the Columbus City Council from 1992 to 1999, serving as its president from 1997 to 1999. In 1998, Coleman was the running mate for gubernatorial candidate Lee Fisher. Coleman ran for and won the Columbus mayorship in 1999 and was re-elected unopposed November 4, 2003.

In February 2005, Coleman announced that he would run for the Democratic nomination for Governor of Ohio in the 2006 gubernatorial election, but subsequently dropped out of the race on November 29, 2005, citing heavy work and family obligations. In 2007, Mayor Coleman won a third term as mayor of Columbus. In 2011, he was re-elected for a fourth term.

In January 2014, as he began his 15th year in office, Coleman became the longest-serving mayor in Columbus&#x27; history. On November 25, 2014, Coleman announced that he would not run for reelection. His final term in office ended on January 1, 2016, when he was succeeded by Columbus City Council President and fellow Democrat Andrew Ginther.

==Early life and education==
Michael B. Coleman was born in Indianapolis, Indiana on November 18, 1954, and moved to Toledo at an early age. After growing up in the Toledo area, Coleman earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Cincinnati and a Juris Doctor from the University of Dayton School of Law.

==Career==
===Attorney===
From 1984 to 1999, Coleman was an attorney in the business practice of Columbus law firm Schottenstein, Zox &amp; Dunn Co. LPA, eventually becoming a partner.

===Columbus City Council===
Michael B. Coleman began his career in public office when he was appointed to Columbus City Council in 1992. He was subsequently re-elected to two terms in office. Coleman served as Columbus City Council President from 1997 until his election as mayor in 1999.

===1998 and 2006 gubernatorial races===
Coleman was selected as the 1998 Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor of Ohio, on the same ballot as Lee Fisher. Fisher and Coleman lost a heavily contested race to Bob Taft and Maureen O&#x27;Connor.

In 2005, Michael B. Coleman was the first Democrat to announce in the Democratic primary for governor of Ohio. But on November 29, 2005, he withdrew from the race, citing family concerns and also that the city of Columbus needed him in his current role as mayor.

Coleman later endorsed fellow Democrat Ted Strickland for governor. After Strickland&#x27;s victory in November 2006, Coleman was selected as chair for Strickland&#x27;s transition team.

===Mayor of Columbus===

After winning election in 1999, Coleman was re-elected as mayor of Columbus in 2003, 2007 and 2011.

Since 2000, under Mayor Coleman, the city of Columbus has spent $54 million less than budgeted. At the same time, he helped boost the city&#x27;s spending on police and fire services from 63 percent of the city operating budget to 71 percent in 2005. Under Coleman, the city has also cut more than $190 million from continuation budgeting levels since 2000, despite increases in costs for medical insurance, wages and workers compensation. As of 2013, bonds issued by the city of Columbus received a AAA bond rating from all three major rating services, the highest possible rating.

, Coleman was a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition (now known as Everytown for Gun Safety), a bi-partisan group with a stated goal of &quot;making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets.&quot; The coalition was then co-chaired by Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Coleman was a long-list finalist for the 2008 World Mayor award.

====2007 mayoral campaign====
During the 2007 mayoral campaign, Coleman was opposed by lawyer William Todd, a Republican. Todd claimed Coleman was soft on crime and ineffective on economic development. Coleman was re-elected, with the certified results showing he received more than 69 percent of 105,792 votes cast to Todd&#x27;s 30 percent.

====2010 immigration debate====
In the spring of 2010 Mayor Coleman banned city workers from traveling to Arizona in a boycott over an Arizona law allowing police officers to demand documentation of citizenship of anyone suspected of being in the United States illegally. Coleman compared the Arizona measure to 19th-century laws that required freed slaves to carry emancipation papers. He said his boycott was intended to show Arizona that its law enforcing illegal immigration measures is not the American way. While travel by city workers to Arizona is prohibited, police officers will be able to travel for the purpose of criminal extradition. Contracts with Arizona companies will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Mayor. Redflex Traffic Systems, which is based in Arizona, operates 20 red-light cameras in Columbus. The red-light cameras issue tickets to red-light runners, the program will not be rescinded as a result of the ban, and in fact the number of red-light cameras will double as recently approved by city council.

====Columbus Mayoral election, 2011====

Mayor Coleman ran in 2011 for a fourth term as mayor of Columbus against Republican challenger Earl W. Smith. On November 8, 2011, Coleman won re-election, receiving just under 70 percent of 179,032 votes cast.

====Longest-serving mayor====
On January 2, 2014, Coleman began his 15th year in office and became the city&#x27;s longest-serving mayor. He surpassed the tenure of M.E. &quot;Jack&quot; Sensenbrenner, who served a total of 14 years as mayor in separate tenures from 1954 to 1960 and 1964 to 1972. Coleman was also the country&#x27;s longest-serving black mayor.

===Return to private practice===
On November 25, 2014, Coleman formally announced that he would not seek a fifth term as mayor of Columbus in the 2015 election. In November 2015, Coleman announced that he would return in 2016 to the practice of law with Indianapolis-based law firm Ice Miller LLP, which merged with his old Columbus law firm Schottenstein, Zox &amp; Dunn Co. LPA in 2012. Coleman serves as director of business and government strategies and a partner in the firm&#x27;s Arena District office.

In March 2018, the City of Columbus dedicated its new municipal office building to Coleman. The Michael B. Coleman Government Center houses the Building and Zoning, Public Service and Development departments and some Public Utility offices.

==Personal life==
In 1984, Coleman married his wife Frankie; it was the second marriage for both. The Colemans have three adult children: Kimberly; Justin, who is an officer with the Columbus Division of Police; and John-David, who served as a sergeant in the United States Marine Corps. In October 2009, Mayor and Mrs. Coleman announced that they were in the process of divorcing. In early 2011 the Colemans filed for a dissolution, which was subsequently granted.

In September 2016, Coleman married longtime companion and president of the L Brands Foundation Janelle Simmons.

Coleman is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi as well as a Prince Hall Freemason. He belongs to St. Mark&#x27;s Lodge #7 in Columbus, Ohio.

<text>Elliot Harold Paul (February 10, 1891 – April 7, 1958) was an American journalist and writer.
==Biography==
Paul was born in Linden, a part of Malden, Massachusetts, the son of Harold Henry Paul and Lucy Greenleaf Doucette. He graduated from Malden High School then worked in the U.S. West on the government Reclamation projects for several years until 1914 when he returned home and took a job as a reporter covering legislative events at the State House in Boston. In 1917, he joined the U.S. Army Signals Corps to fight in World War I. Paul served in France where he fought in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and in the Meuse-Argonne offensive. Following the war&#x27;s end, he returned home and to a job as a journalist. At this time, he began writing books, inspired in part by his military experiences.

By 1925 Elliot Paul had already seen three of his novels published when he left America to join many of his literary compatriots in the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris, France. There, he worked for a time at the Chicago Tribune&#x27;s &quot;International Edition&quot; (so-called &quot;Paris Edition&quot;), before joining Eugene and Maria Jolas as co-editor of the literary journal, &quot;transition&quot;. A friend of both James Joyce and Gertrude Stein, Paul defied Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s maxim that &quot;if you mentioned Joyce twice to Stein, you were dead.&quot; Paul was a great enthusiast of Stein&#x27;s work, equating its &quot;feeling for a continuous present&quot; with jazz.

Paul returned to the newspaper business, to the &quot;Paris Herald&quot; and to write more novels in his spare time. He had completed three more books when he suffered from a nervous breakdown and abruptly left Paris to recuperate in the Spanish village of Santa Eulalia on the island of Ibiza. With virtually no one in the literary community knowing where he was, in her 1933 &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot;, Stein mused over his &quot;disappearance.&quot;

Caught in the middle of the Spanish Civil War, he was inspired to write the well-received &quot;Life and Death of a Spanish Town&quot;. Forced to flee Spain, he returned to Paris and produced detective fiction featuring the amateur sleuth Homer Evans, as well as crafting what is considered as one of his best works, &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot;.

Back in the United States following the outbreak of World War II, Elliot Paul turned to screenwriting where in Hollywood, between 1941 and 1953, he participated in the writing of ten screenplays, the most remembered of which is the 1945 production, &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;; he also wrote the screenplay for the Poverty Row production of &quot;New Orleans&quot;, a fictional history of Storyville jazz featuring Billie Holiday in her only acting role. He also contributed to &quot;London Town&quot; (1946), one of the most infamous flops in British cinema history. In 1949 he provided subtitles for the US release of Claude Autant-Lara&#x27;s film &quot;Devil in the Flesh&quot; (Le Diable au corps).

Contemptuous of the censorship imposed on the studios by the Hays Code, Paul mocked Hollywood&#x27;s hypocritical puritanism in his satiric book from 1942, &quot;With a Hays Nonny Nonny&quot;, where he reworked Bible stories so that they complied with the Code. &quot;The Book of Esther&quot;, for example, becomes a vehicle for Don Ameche, with Groucho Marx as Mordecai.

A talented pianist, he frequently supplemented his income by playing at local clubs in the Los Angeles area.

Paul married and divorced five times - Rosa Gertrude Brown (1919-1925), Camille Haynes (1925-1937), Flora Thompson (1937-1940), Barbara Mayock (1940-1949), and Nancy Dolan McMahon (1950-1957). He had one son with Camille Haynes. He died in 1958 at the Veterans&#x27; Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island.

<text>An almucantar (also spelled almucantarat or almacantara) is a circle on the celestial sphere parallel to the horizon. Two stars that lie on the same almucantar have the same altitude. 
The term was introduced into European astronomy by monastic astronomer Hermann Contractus of Reichenau, Latinized from the Arabic word &#x27; (&quot;the almucantar, sundial&quot;, plural:&#x27;), derived from &quot;&quot; (&quot;arch, bridge&quot;)

==Almucantar staff==

An almucantar staff is an instrument chiefly used to determine the time of sunrise and sunset, in order to find the amplitude and consequently the variations of the compass. Usually made of pear tree or boxwood, with an arch of 15° to 30°, it is an example of a backstaff.

The sun casts that shadow of a vane (B in the adjacent image) on a &quot;horizon vane&quot; (A). The horizon vane has a slit or hole to allow the observer to see the horizon in the distance. The observer aligns the horizon and shadow so they show at the same point on the horizon vane and sets the &quot;sighting vane&quot; (C) to align his line of sight with the horizon. The altitude of the sun is the angle between the shadow vane and the sighting vane (B-A-C).

==Solar almucantar==
The almucantar plane that contains the Sun is used to characterize multiple scattering of aerosols. Measurements are carried out rapidly at several angles at both sides of the Sun using a spectroradiometer or a photometer. There are several models to obtain aerosol properties from the solar almucantar. The most relevant were developed by Oleg Dubovik and used in the NASA AERONET network and by Teruyuki Nakajima (named SkyRad.pack).

<doc id="881710" wikidata="Q762335" url="?curid=881710" title="Mercury Montego">
<text>The Mercury Montego is a nameplate that was applied to three separate generations of vehicles marketed by the Mercury division of Ford Motor Company. Taking its name from Montego Bay, Jamaica, the nameplate made its first appearance for 1967 in the Canadian market as part of the Mercury-derived Meteor model line. For 1968, the Mercury Montego made its debut across North America, becoming the Mercury counterpart of the Ford Torino intermediate-size model line for two generations.

For the 1977 model year, Ford revised the intermediate-size product ranges of both its Ford and Mercury divisions; as part of a mid-cycle update, Mercury discontinued the Montego nameplate and expanded the Mercury Cougar line to include a full range of sedans and wagons (with the Ford Gran Torino becoming the Ford LTD II).

After a 28-year absence, the Montego nameplate was revived for the 2005 model year, this time applied to a full-size sedan. Marketed between the Mercury Milan and Grand Marquis, the 2005 Montego, internally code-named D333, was the Mercury counterpart of the Ford Five Hundred (D258). For the 2008 model year, the Montego adopted the nameplate of the car it had replaced, becoming the final generation of the Mercury Sable.


==First generation (1968–1971)==

For 1968, Mercury introduced the Montego as part of its intermediate Mercury Comet product line. While the high-performance Comet Cyclone became the distinct Mercury Cyclone, the Montego replaced the Comet Capri and Comet Caliente under a single nameplate. As the Comet became the Mercury counterpart of the Ford Fairlane for 1966, the introduction of the Montego paired it with the Ford Torino. 

The first-generation Montego was offered as a four-door sedan, two-door hardtop, four-door station wagon, and two-door convertible. The model line was offered in base and MX trims (replacing the Comet Capri and Comet Caliente, respectively). 

For 1970, Mercury intermediates adopted the Montego name entirely. A year later, the Comet name returned for a second time as a compact car, serving as the Mercury version of the Ford Maverick. A mid-cycle redesign added a forward-thrusting hood and grille design. The Montego convertible was discontinued, with a four-door hardtop added to the model range. An MX Brougham trim was added for all sedans (featuring concealed headlamps), with an equivalent MX Villager station wagon (with exterior wood-panel trim). 

==Second generation (1972–1976)==
For 1972, the second-generation Montego was introduced alongside the redesigned Ford Torino. In a major design shift, intermediate-size Ford/Mercury model lines shifted from unibody to body-on-frame construction; similarly to the General Motors A-platform, the Montego adopted a split-wheelbase chassis (114-inch for two-doors, 118-inch for four-doors and station wagons). True four-door hardtops were replaced by &quot;pillared hardtops&quot; (frameless door glass remained, supported by a thin B-pillar), while two-door Montegos retained hardtop roofs, though with much wider C-pillars.

The Cyclone had reverted from a stand-alone model line to an option package for 1972 for the Montego; only 30 1972 Cyclones would be produced, making it among the rarest Mercury vehicles. As a replacement for the Cyclone, Mercury introduced the Montego GT, a counterpart of the Ford Gran Torino SportsRoof for the first time; the Montego GT was offered from 1972 to 1973. 

As a standard engine, the Montego was equipped with a 250 cubic-inch inline-six, with five different V8 engines available as options. Starting in 1974, the Mercury Montego was available with a 460 V8, shared with the Mercury Marquis/Colony Park.

The redesign was initially met with success, as 1972 Montego sales increased 136% over 1971; the MX Brougham saw the largest increases in sales, as the two-door increased its sales by 897% while the four-door increased by 1,021%. Following the 1973 gas crisis, sales of the model line began to trend lower in response to industry-wide fuel economy concerns. 

For 1974, the Mercury Cougar XR7 adopted the body of the Montego two-door hardtop, now the counterpart of the Ford Elite, the Cougar was repackaged as an intermediate-size personal luxury car. While the notchback roofline remained for the two-door hardtop (though rear side windows became fixed in place, with an opera window added as an option), the fastback Montego GT hardtop was dropped. 

For 1975, the engine lineup was revised, as all Ford/Mercury intermediates dropped the inline-6 and 302 V8; a 351 V8 became the standard engine, with optional 400 and 460 V8s. Sales of the Montego dropped further; in addition to the Cougar competing directly against the two-door Montego, the smaller Mercury Monarch attracted buyers shifting away from full-size and intermediate cars towards compact cars offering increased fuel efficiency. 

For 1976, the Montego saw only nominal changes, centered primarily on improving fuel efficiency of the V8 engines. The Torino-chassis intermediates underwent a mid-cycle redesign for 1977, with Ford shifting several nameplates. Mercury rebranded the Montego as a fourth generation of the Cougar; in addition to the flagship Cougar XR7 personal luxury coupe, the Cougar offered two-door and four-door sedans and a station wagon. Following a substantial exterior revision, the Torino/Gran Torino was rebranded as the Ford LTD II, with the Ford Elite replaced by a downsized Ford Thunderbird (becoming a counterpart of the Cougar XR7). 

==Third generation (2005–2007)==

After a 28-year hiatus, Mercury revived the Montego nameplate for 2005, moving it to a full-size sedan. Introduced as the successor of the Mercury Sable (alongside the smaller Mercury Milan), the Montego was slotted between the Milan and Grand Marquis in size. The divisional counterpart of the Ford Five Hundred, the model line entered production on July 12, 2004. 

The third-generation Montego was manufactured at the Chicago Assembly facility in Chicago, Illinois alongside the Ford Five Hundred and the Ford Freestyle; the latter was a CUV wagon serving as a replacement for the Taurus/Sable station wagon. 
=== Design ===
The third-generation Montego used the Ford D3 platform. Developed in collaboration with Volvo, the D3 platform is the first full-size Ford platform to use front-wheel drive, with all-wheel drive as an option. Shifting away from the body-on-frame Panther platform, the D3 chassis utilizes unibody construction. Only two inches shorter than the Grand Marquis in wheelbase, the Montego was nearly 500 pounds lighter in curb weight. 

The Montego was equipped with a single engine, shared with the previous Taurus/Sable, a 203hp version of the 3.0L DOHC &quot;Duratec&quot; V6. Front-wheel drive versions were equipped with an Aisin 6-speed automatic; AWD versions were equipped with a CVT sourced from a Ford/ZF joint venture.

==== Total Vehicle Geometry (TVG) ====
The Montego, Five Hundred and Ford Freestyle were manufactured using a Volvo-derived system called Total Vehicle Geometry (TVG) to ensure fit, finish and craftsmanship — by requiring comprehensive participation by all engineers as well as suppliers and vendors. Heavily using computer-aided design, TVG tracks all design modifications, translating them into the central CAD database which in turn allows each engineer access to current project data. The system improves part tolerance at the body-in-white stage as well as early cabin integrity testing, via air leakage testing. TVG improved fit and finish at the first prototype stage and decreases pilot manufacturing times. 

For side impact protection the bodywork is braced at the B-pillar via an energy-channeling structural cross-car roof tube and a corresponding undercar energy channelling cross-tube — with the front seats mounted above the lower tube, locating them above a side impact energy path. The system derives from a side-impact safety design marketed by Volvo as its Side Impact Protection System (SIPS).

=== Exterior ===

As with the Grand Marquis, the 2005 Montego was offered solely as a four-door sedan. The tallest Mercury sedan in over 50 years (over five feet tall), the Montego was only two inches lower in height than a Jeep Cherokee SUV. 

While visibly sharing much of its exterior with its Ford Five Hundred counterpart, the third-generation Montego held several distinct design features. In Mercury design tradition, the Montego was styled with a vertical waterfall-style grille with satin aluminum exterior trim (limiting chrome to the roofline). Exclusive to the Montego, HID headlamps and LED taillamps were standard equipment (the latter, the largest array of LED lights on any Ford vehicle worldwide). 

Ford chief designer George Bucher said: &quot;it was a challenge to sculpt a Ford-styled body around a Volvo chassis, and added that designers used what he calls plainer surfaces with taut lines to give the car a modern look without losing its passenger-car proportions.&quot;

=== Interior ===

Contrasting with both the Grand Marquis and the Sable, the third-generation Montego was available solely in a five-passenger configuration. As with the Mercury Marauder (and the Grand Marquis LSE), the Montego was fitted with a console-mounted transmission shifter. As with the Milan, the Montego was fitted with a 60/40 fold-down rear seat. Along with expanding the 21 cubic-foot trunk space, the folding rear seats (and optional forward-folding front passenger seatback) allowed for objects up to 10 feet in length to be transported inside. 

At its launch, two airbags were standard, with four more available as an option (front-seat airbags and side-curtain) 

A design feature of the Montego includes its overall height to add interior space to the vehicle. To appeal to buyers of both sedans and sport-utility vehicles, Ford raised the viewpoint of the driver. Marketed as &quot;Command Seating&quot;, the Montego features high H-point seating (the location of the occupants hip-point relative to the road or the vehicle floor); its H-point is closer to the ground than that of a sport utility vehicle, but higher than a typical sedan, easing entry and exit. Also, the distance from the H-point to the floor of the vehicle is reflective of more upright seating. At its press launch, Ford said the Five Hundred&#x27;s H-point is up to four and a half inches higher than its competitors. The Montego also features theater seating, where second row seats are higher: in the front row, the distance between the H-point and the heel point, where the occupant&#x27;s foot touches the floor, is 12.7 inches — in the second row the distance between the H-point and the heel point is 15.7 inches.

=== Trim ===
In place of the three trims of the Five Hundred, Mercury marketed two trims of the Montego: Luxury and Premier.

Slotted in between the Five Hundred SE and SEL, the Montego Luxury featured cloth seats as standard, with leather seats as optional. 

The Mercury equivalent of a Five Hundred Limited, the Montego Premier featured leather seats as standard; all-wheel drive and a sunroof were among the few available options.

===Sales===
===Discontinuation===

Following a poor critical reception, the Mercury Montego and Ford Five Hundred fell under sales projections from the 2005 to 2007 model years. For the 2008 model year, the Montego and Five Hundred underwent a mid-cycle update, with pre-production prototypes unveiled at 2007 auto shows. Along with evolutionary changes to the body, the powertrain underwent a series of upgrades, as a 263hp 3.5L V6 became the standard engine; both previous transmissions were replaced by a Ford-sourced 6-speed automatic. 

The exterior received new bodywork forward of the windshield (to better distinguish the two model lines), with a revised rear fascia (clear-lens taillamps; license plate relocated to rear bumper). The interior saw minor trim revisions; the windshield wiper controls were moved from their previous stalk to the left-side column stalk. 

After his installation as Ford CEO, Alan Mulally ordered the model lines renamed before entering production, claiming higher brand value and recognition. For 2008, the Montego was renamed the Sable, taking on the nameplate of the vehicle that it originally replaced. 

==Use in competition==
In the 1968 NASCAR Grand National stock car season, the fastback Fairlane body style proved much slicker than other makes, but the nose of the Mercury Cyclone Fastback was the main reason pointed to it being even slightly faster than its Ford counterpart. Cale Yarborough drove a Wood Brothers Cyclone to victory in the Daytona 500, and the Mercury bodies would remain a major force in NASCAR through 2 generations of bodies. 

The battle over aerodynamics would prompt Chrysler to respond with specialized &quot;winged wonder&quot; Daytona and Superbird bodies after its own fastback bodies proved disappointing.

<doc id="881717" wikidata="Q548735" url="?curid=881717" title="Michael Olowokandi">
<text>Michael Olowokandi (born 3 April 1975) is a Nigerian former professional basketball player. Born in Lagos, Nigeria, and raised in London, he played collegiately for the Pacific Tigers in Stockton, California. Nicknamed &quot;the Kandi Man,&quot; Olowokandi was selected as the first overall pick of the 1998 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Clippers. He played professionally until 2007, when he was forced to retire due to severe hernia and knee injuries.

==Early life==
Olowokandi was born in Lagos, Nigeria, as the oldest of five children. His father, Ezekiel, was a Nigerian diplomat. When Olowokandi was aged 3, his family moved to London where he was raised. Olowokandi has Nigerian citizenship and did not hold a British passport as of 2004.

Olowokandi attended the Newlands Manor School in Seaford, East Sussex, where he set British age group records in long jump and triple jump and also played center midfield in football. Olowokandi had a height of at age 16, growing six inches in two years. He first touched a basketball at the age of 17, and began playing basketball when he was 18.

Olowokandi then entered Brunel University as a mechanical engineering major, where he was an athlete in track and field, cricket, and rugby union. He had a tryout with the Thames Valley Tigers of the Budweiser Basketball League but did not receive a contract.

==College career==
On 3 April 1995, on Olowokandi&#x27;s 20th birthday, he opened the &quot;Peterson&#x27;s Guide to American Colleges and Universities&quot; to a random page and landed on the University of the Pacific (UOP). Olowokandi called the UOP basketball office in hopes that he would be accepted to play basketball for the Pacific Tigers. UOP assistant coach Tony Marcopulos answered the phone call and was stunned when informed of Olowokandi&#x27;s height of . After being informed that there were no more available basketball scholarships at UOP, Olowokandi offered to pay for his schooling (about $23,000 annually) for two years. He also called Georgetown University and Duke University but was informed they would not offer scholarships without sending a scout to see him.

Olowokandi and Marcupulos spent hundreds of phone calls arranging credit transferral and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility, which was determined that Olowokandi had three seasons of college remaining. When Olowokandi arrived in the United States in August 1995, he had not played a game of organized basketball or met the UOP coaches; Pacific head coach Bob Thomason joked, &quot;I had told him on the phone that if he wasn&#x27;t 7 foot I was going to put him right back on the plane.&quot; Arriving as a sophomore in eligibility, Olowokandi had no understanding of basketball terminology and was in poor physical condition. He frequently committed backcourt and traveling violations in his early games but persisted with his progression and committed to extended practice sessions. Olowokandi became a star for the team during his junior season, averaging a team high 12.6 points, 7.4 rebounds and 1.9 blocks.

Olowokandi led his team to the 1997 NCAA Tournament and as a senior he led the Tigers to the 1998 National Invitation Tournament. He averaged 22 points, 11 rebounds, and 3 blocks per game his senior year and was the 1997–98 Big West Conference Player of the Year. Olowokandi was named as a 1998 Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press. He graduated from Pacific with a degree in Economics and had his No. 55 jersey retired by the university in 1998.

==Professional career==
===Los Angeles Clippers (1998–2003)===
Olowokandi was considered to be a top two pick in the 1998 NBA draft due to his wingspan and &quot;unlimited upside&quot;. He performed well at the NBA annual pre-draft events with his quickness, speed and strength. Olowokandi set records during his workouts in the Denver and Vancouver pre-draft camps, including a record for medicine ball dunks in Denver and running the 40-yard dash in 4.55 seconds. Fellow NBA player Andrew Lang said Olowokandi had some of the quickest feet he had ever seen while the two performed together at the camps.

Olowokandi was drafted with the first overall pick by the Los Angeles Clippers. Later in the lottery future Hall of Famers Paul Pierce, Dirk Nowitzki, and Vince Carter were selected, as well as future All-Star Antawn Jamison. The Clippers had initially planned to draft eventual second pick Mike Bibby but Elgin Baylor cited Olowokandi&#x27;s work habits and off-season improvements as the swaying factors. The start of the 1998–99 NBA season was hampered due to a lockout and the Clippers were not allowed to contact Olowokandi. His agent, Bill Duffy, put Olowokandi in contact with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who trained together extensively during the 1998 offseason. Olokowandi signed with Italian team Kinder Bologna on 5 January 1999 — only two days before the lockout was resolved. In 3 regular season Italian League games played with Bologna, he averaged 4.7 points, 5.7 rebounds and 0.3 assists in 17.3 minutes per game. He also played for 3 games in the FIBA EuroLeague, where he averaged 10.7 points, 6.0 rebounds and 0.3 assists in 21.3 minutes per game. Bologna granted Olowokandi an early release to sign with the Clippers as he did not have a considerable impact and was poorly conditioned. Olowokandi claimed that he felt misused by the team and did not have his offensive abilities utilised.
Olowokandi signed with the Clippers on 29 January 1999. During his rookie season, he averaged 8.9 points and 7.9 rebounds in 45 games played for the Clippers. Olowokandi underwent surgery on his left knee on 11 May 1999, in what would be the first of multiple knee surgeries.

In the 2001–02 season, Olowokandi saw the most playing time of his career and averaged 11.1 points and 8.8 rebounds. After Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s stint, Olowokandi received tutelage from Clippers assistant coach Igor Kokoskov who worked with him on footwork and shot selection. Olowokandi received additional playing time after center Elton Brand was sidelined by a bruised left hip, and Olowokandi became &quot;the Clippers’ go-to guy&quot;. He averaged 17 points a game and 11 rebounds during the last 20 games of the season and was considered one of the biggest free agents in the 2002–03 free agency class. On 5 April 2002, Olowokandi was fined $50,000 by the Clippers for &quot;behavior detrimental to the team&quot; after he criticized teammates for a loss against the Utah Jazz.

Olowokandi was coveted by the San Antonio Spurs to replace the retiring David Robinson. He was also a top choice for the Denver Nuggets, with Kiki VanDeWeghe of the Denver Nuggets considering Olowokandi to be a &quot;legitimate center.&quot; However, Olowokandi resigned with the Clippers to their qualifying offer on 24 September 2002, following weeks of uncertainty in contract negotiations. Olowokandi injured his left knee during his extensive training during the offseason and missed most of the preseason. The team&#x27;s apprehension in offering him a longterm contract extension caused conflict between the Clippers and Olowokandi, who by December 2002 had decided he would not again resign with the team. He also considered himself as having a limited role in coach Alvin Gentry&#x27;s offense despite having a breakthrough season that saw improvements in his aggressiveness and consistency. Olowokandi&#x27;s left knee injury flared up in January 2003 and he was placed on the injured list. He underwent knee surgery on 3 February 2003, and was ruled out for three to four weeks. Olowokandi was ultimately ruled out for the rest of the season by the Clippers in April.

Olowokandi averaged 9.9 points, 8.0 rebounds and 1.6 blocks in his 323 games played with the Clippers over five seasons. Abdul-Jabbar, who became an assistant coach for the Clippers during Olowokandi&#x27;s tenure, considered Olowokandi &quot;talented but uncoachable&quot; and cited his lack of willingness to accept criticism in practice as being detrimental to his career.

===Minnesota Timberwolves (2003–2006)===

Due to financial issues with the L.A. Clippers, Olowokandi signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves on a three-year, $16.2 million contract. Olowokandi had been considered the fourth most valuable free agent that offseason but received little interest from NBA teams and accepted the only solid deal he was offered. Olowokandi was enticed by Timberwolves general manager and former player Kevin McHale, who trained one-on-one together before the season started. Olowokandi again experienced pain and swelling in his left knee so had a second procedure before the start of the regular season that resulted in him missing all of training camp and attending only three team practices. He appeared sporadically in games for the Timberwolves during November and December due to tendinitis in his right knee. Olowokandi underwent surgery on 12 December 2003, and was ruled out indefinitely.

On 26 November 2004, Olowokandi was suspended by the Timberwolves for two games after he was arrested for refusing to leave an Indianapolis night club. On 16 January 2005, Olowokandi was suspended by the NBA for four games for a fight with Nenê of the Denver Nuggets during a game the previous night.

===Boston Celtics (2006–2007)===
On January 26, 2006, Olowokandi, Dwayne Jones, and Wally Szczerbiak were traded by the Timberwolves to the Boston Celtics, alongside a future first-round draft pick, for Justin Reed, Mark Blount, Ricky Davis, Marcus Banks and two future second-round draft picks.

In 500 regular season NBA games (399 games started), Olowokandi averaged 8.3 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 1.39 blocked shots per game. In 15 playoff games (2 starts), he averaged 2.1 points, 3.5 rebounds, and .7 blocks per game. Olowokandi is often considered to be a draft bust, failing to live up to the potential offered by his frame and athleticism.

==Charity==
In 2001, Olowokandi and his Clippers teammates participated in the BasketBowl Challenge at Keystone Lanes in Norwalk, California, to raise funds for the Los Angeles Clippers Foundation and Children&#x27;s Hospital Los Angeles.

During Thanksgiving of 2006, Olowokandi volunteered his time at the Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital and served meals for over 200 homeless people at the Pine Street Inn in Boston. He has also donated to various charities and hospitals, including over $100,000 to the Children&#x27;s Hospital Los Angeles for a new incubator for premature newborn infants. Many of Olowokandi&#x27;s charitable projects were undisclosed and done privately without his teams&#x27; affiliations.

<text>The Ford global B-car platform (for &quot;B-class&quot;) is a subcompact automobile platform that is jointly developed by Ford Motor Company and Mazda Motor Corporation at centers in Europe as well as North America and Australia. Previously, Ford has used the Mazda-engineered D platform for its B-segment Ford Festiva (hatchback). This new global B-platform project was initiated by Ford in Dearborn, MI and is equipped with front MacPherson strut and twist-beam rear suspension. The front suspension arms (wishbone) are attached to a pressed-steel welded subframe, which is directly bolted onto the bodyshell. The design is made to accommodate diverse engine options.

== B3 ==
The first iteration of this platform was known as the B3. Vehicles utilising this platform include:
* Ford Fiesta Mk5 (2002–2008)
* Ford Figo (2010–2015)
* Ford Fusion (2002–2012)
* Ford Ikon (2007–2015)

===Mazda D Platform===
* Mazda Demio/Mazda2 (2002–2007)
* Mazda Verisa (2004–2015)

==B2E==
The new B2E platform was designed and developed as Ford’s global B-segment platform. It is the first B-platform developed by Ford&#x27;s global product development process.

This global platform has been used since 2008 on the following vehicles:
* Ford B-Max (2012–2017)
* Ford EcoSport (2012–2023)
* Ford Fiesta Mk6 (2008–2019)
* Ford Fiesta Mk7 (2017–2023)

<text>Frieda Lawrence (August 11, 1879 – August 11, 1956) was a German author and wife of the British novelist D. H. Lawrence.

==Life==

Emma Maria Frieda Johanna Freiin (Baroness) von Richthofen (also known under her married names as Frieda Weekley, Frieda Lawrence, and Frieda Lawrence Ravagli) was born at Metz into the Heinersdorf line of the . Her father was Baron Friedrich Ernst Emil Ludwig von Richthofen (1844–1916), an engineer in the Imperial German Army, and her mother was Anna Elise Lydia Marquier (1852–1930). Her elder sister was the economist and social scientist Else von Richthofen.

In 1899, she married a British philologist and professor of modern languages, Ernest Weekley, with whom she had three children, Charles Montague (born 1900), Elsa Agnès (born 1902) and Barbara Joy (born 1904). They settled in Nottingham, where Ernest was an academic at the university. During her marriage to Weekley she began to translate German literature, mainly fairy tales, into English.

In 1912 she met D. H. Lawrence, a former student of her husband&#x27;s; they soon fell in love and eloped to Germany. During their stay Lawrence was arrested for spying; after the intervention of Frieda&#x27;s father, the couple walked south over the Alps to Italy. In 1914, following her divorce, Frieda and Lawrence married. She had to leave her children with Weekley, because, as the adulterous respondent to a divorce instigated by her husband, she was not legally able to gain custody unless he consented. 

They had intended to return to the continent but the outbreak of war kept them in England, where they endured official harassment and censorship. They also struggled with limited resources and Lawrence&#x27;s already frail health.

Leaving postwar England at the earliest opportunity, they traveled widely, eventually settling at the Kiowa Ranch near Taos, New Mexico, and in Lawrence&#x27;s last years at the Villa Mirenda, near Scandicci in Tuscany. After her husband&#x27;s death in Vence, France, in 1930, she returned to Taos to live with her third husband, Angelo Ravagli. The ranch is now owned by the University of New Mexico at Albuquerque.

Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, who knew her in Taos, said in 1974: &quot;Frieda was very special. I can remember very clearly the first time I ever saw her, standing in a doorway, with her hair all frizzed out, wearing a cheap red calico dress that looked as though she&#x27;d just wiped out the frying pan with it. She was not thin, and not young, but there was something radiant and wonderful about her.&quot;

Joseph Glasco became close friends with Frieda when he and William Goyen lived together in Taos in the 1950s. At one point, Frieda asked Glasco to arrange an exhibition of D. H. Lawrence’s paintings. They remained friends until her death in 1956.

Mainly through her elder sister, Frieda became acquainted with many intellectuals and authors, including the socioeconomist Alfred Weber and sociologist Max Weber, the radical psychoanalyst Otto Gross (who became her lover), and the writer Fanny zu Reventlow.

===&quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;===
Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; is thought to be based partly on her relationship as an aristocrat with the working-class Lawrence. John Harte&#x27;s dramatisation led to its being Lawrence&#x27;s only novel to be staged. She loved the play when she read it and supported its staging, but the copyright to Lawrence&#x27;s story had already been acquired by Baron Philippe de Rothschild, a close friend. He did not relinquish it until 1960, after the film version had been released. John Harte&#x27;s play was first produced at the Arts Theatre in London in 1961, five years after her death.

==Death==

Frieda Lawrence died on her seventy-seventh birthday in Taos.

==In popular culture==
Frieda Lawrence&#x27;s life inspired the biographical novel &quot;Frieda: The Original Lady Chatterley&quot; (Two Roads, 2018), by Annabel Abbs. The novel was a &quot;Times Book of the Month&quot;, then a &quot;Times Book of the Year&quot; 2018. Abbs also wrote about Lawrence&#x27;s love for walking and the great outdoors in &quot;Windswept: Walking in the Footsteps of Remarkable Women&quot; (Two Roads, 2021). 

In the 1985 British television movie &quot;Coming Through&quot; about Weekley and Lawrence&#x27;s affair, Helen Mirren portrayed Frieda Weekley.

She is an important character in &quot;On the Rocks&quot;, a play by Amy Rosenthal that deals with her sometimes difficult relationship with D. H. Lawrence.

Lawrence was the inspiration for the character Harriet Somers, played by Judy Davis in the Australian film &quot;Kangaroo&quot; (1987). The film is based on D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s semi-autobiographical novel of the same name.

<text>The Mercury Grand Marquis is an automobile that was produced by Mercury from the 1975 until 2011 model years. Introduced as the flagship sub-model of the Mercury Marquis in 1975, the Grand Marquis became a stand-alone model line in 1983, serving as the largest Mercury sedan. The model line served as the sedan counterpart of the Mercury Colony Park station wagon up to 1991. The fourth generation was the basis of the 2003 and 2004 Mercury Marauder.

From 1979 until 2011, the Grand Marquis shared the rear-wheel drive (RWD) Panther platform with the Ford LTD Crown Victoria (Ford Crown Victoria after 1992), and from 1980, the Lincoln Town Car. For over three decades, the Ford and Mercury sedans were functionally identical, with two of the three generations of the model line sharing the same roofline. The Grand Marquis was available as a four-door sedan for nearly its entire run; from 1988 to its final year in 2011, it was the only body style that was offered. A four-door hardtop was available from 1975 to 1978 and a two-door hardtop coupe from 1975 to 1987.

The Grand Marquis was the second-best-selling Mercury line (after the Cougar) with 2.7 million units produced; at 36 years of continuous production, the Grand Marquis was the longest-running Mercury nameplate (the Cougar, 34 years). Ford manufactured the Grand Marquis, alongside the Mercury Marquis, Mercury Marauder, Ford (LTD) Crown Victoria, and (beginning in 2007) the Lincoln Town Car, at two facilities: the St. Louis Assembly Plant in Hazelwood, Missouri (1979–1985) and the St. Thomas Assembly Plant in Southwold, Ontario, Canada (1986–2011). 

Ford announced the discontinuation of the Mercury brand in 2010, but a few 2011 model-year Mercurys were made. The last Grand Marquis - and the final Mercury branded car - was produced on January 4, 2011, at St. Thomas Assembly.


==1975–1978==
For the 1967 model year, Mercury introduced the Mercury Marquis two-door hardtop as a divisional counterpart of the Ford LTD. Distinguishing it from other Mercury two-door hardtops, the Marquis included a standard vinyl roof and upright rear side windows that were similar to the Cougar.

For 1969, the division revised its full-size range. The Monterey was retained as the standard-trim model, with the Marquis replacing the previous Montclair and Park Lane (the Marquis Brougham became the top Mercury, replacing the Park Lane Brougham). The Marauder returned as a fastback Marquis (replacing the S-55), lasting through 1970. Mercury discontinued separate station wagon models, with the Colony Park becoming a Marquis-based station wagon.

The Grand Marquis name made its first appearance in 1974 as part of an interior trim package for the Marquis Brougham. In addition to a wood-trim steering wheel, the interior was fitted with leather-and-velour split-bench seats.

For 1975, all full-size Mercury sedans adopted the Marquis nameplate, as the division retired the Monterey (in use since 1950). To expand the model range, the Grand Marquis became the highest-trim Marquis (slotted above the Brougham). Bridging the price and content gap between the Marquis Brougham and the Lincoln Continental, the Mercury Grand Marquis gave the division a vehicle to compete against premium medium-brand sedans, including the Buick Electra 225, Oldsmobile Ninety Eight, and the Chrysler New Yorker Brougham. The Grand Marquis was offered in either a four-door &quot;pillared hardtop&quot; sedan or a two-door hardtop sedan body style; as with the Marquis and Colony Park (and the Lincoln Continental), hidden headlights were standard. The model line included the V8. A V8 became standard for 1976 and 1977, with a V8 becoming standard for 1978 (except in California, where the 400 V8 was standard). Through 1978, the 460 V8 was optional. All engines were paired with a three-speed automatic transmission. Shared with the Lincoln Continental, four-wheel disc brakes were optional.

==First generation (1979–1991)==
For the 1979 model year, the full-size Mercury model line was downsized. The Grand Marquis returned as the premium model of the Mercury Marquis model range. The cars were seventeen inches shorter and nearly 1,000 pounds lighter (dependent on powertrain) than their 1978 predecessor. While its exterior footprint closely matched the Cougar (Montego) intermediate sedan, the 1979 Grand Marquis offered more interior and luggage space.

Alongside the extensive downsizing of the model line, the Ford LTD Crown Victoria was introduced for the 1980 model year, serving as the first direct divisional counterpart of the Grand Marquis. Both vehicles shared nearly identical exterior designs except for front and rear fascias.

During the early 1980s, all three Ford divisions revised their full-size and mid-size models. For 1983, the Mercury lineup moved the Marquis nameplate to the mid-size segment (replacing the previous mid-size Cougar), introducing an all-new Cougar coupe (replacing the previous Cougar XR7), and discontinuing the Zephyr (replaced by the smaller front-wheel drive 1984 Topaz). The Grand Marquis now served as the full-size Mercury; for the first time since 1951, Mercury produced a single full-size sedan nameplate (alongside the Colony Park station wagon).

The &quot;downsized&quot; Grand Marquis introduced in 1979 would remain in production throughout the 1980s, as competitors such as the Buick Electra, Oldsmobile 98, and Chrysler New Yorker (and Fifth Avenue) were downsized further and adopted front-wheel drive. Amid these mid-tier competitors, the Grand Marquis eventually became the only option on the market with rear-wheel drive and a V8 engine; the GM competitors were downsized to a smaller, front-whel-drive platform for 1985, while Chrysler got out of the traditional full-size market in 1981. Only the full-size GM station wagons carried on as direct competitors to the Mercury Colony Park wagon during the late 1980s. 

Along with its stablemates, the Ford LTD Crown Victoria and Lincoln Town Car, the Grand Marquis received a light refresh in 1988 that included more rounded front and rear fascias and other subtle updates inside and out. In 1990, a driver&#x27;s side airbag was introduced as standard equipment to comply with new federal safety regulations.

By 1991, the final year for this generation of Grand Marquis, the only other full-size vehicle to offer both a sedan and wagon variant was the freshly redesigned 1991 Chevy Caprice; the corporate cousin of the Caprice, the Buick Roadmaster, wouldn&#x27;t offer a sedan until the 1992 model year, while the Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser was strictly available as a wagon for its brief run in 1991 and 1992.

=== Chassis specification ===
The first-generation Grand Marquis was built on the rear-wheel drive Ford Panther platform. While Ford and Mercury sedans had shared common chassis underpinnings since 1961, the Panther chassis marked the first time the two model lines shared the same wheelbase with the Mercury downsized from .

Although reduced in size, the Grand Marquis retained the suspension design with a live rear axle suspension and double wishbone independent front suspension, with coil springs at all four wheels. In 1985, gas-charged shock absorbers were standardized for the model line, with load-leveling rear air suspension introduced as an option. The Grand Marquis featured front vented disc brakes and rear drum brakes.

For 1986, 15-inch wheels returned as standard equipment (after having been an option since 1979).

==== Powertrain ====
The previous standard V8 was discontinued, and the V8 (rounded up to &quot;5.0 L&quot; by Ford) became the sole engine available through 1991. The throttle-body fuel injection engine was rated at . Starting with the 1986 model year, the engine adopted multi-port fuel injection with a cast-aluminum upper intake manifold, increasing output to . 

The V8 engine were paired with the four-speed AOD overdrive automatic transmission.

=== Body ===
Mercury offered the first-generation Grand Marquis solely as a sedan in two-door and four-door configurations. For 1983 only, the Grand Marquis was offered as a station wagon (effectively a Colony Park without woodgrain trim); from 1984 onward, all full-size Mercury wagons were Colony Parks. While styled nearly identical to the LTD Crown Victoria, the first-generation Grand Marquis was three inches longer than its Ford counterpart; alongside the doors and front and rear windows, only the bumpers are externally shared between the two model lines.

After the 1987 model year, the two-door Grand Marquis was discontinued; only 4,904 were produced.

==== Exterior ====
In contrast to the stainless-steel band surrounding the B-pillars of the LTD Crown Victoria, the Grand Marquis was offered with multiple vinyl roof configurations, sharing the B-pillar &quot;coach lamps&quot; of the Lincoln Town Car. Alongside the standard half-length vinyl roof, a full-length roof was offered; the LS offered an additional option of a &quot;formal roof,&quot; configured with a &quot;frenched&quot; rear window. The Grand Marquis was styled with a different rear fascia, using full-width taillamps (separated by the license plate).

During its production, the first-generation Grand Marquis underwent minor changes. For 1982, simulated vents were removed from the front fenders. Starting with the 1983 model year, the grille and taillamps were redesigned as the Grand Marquis became a distinct model line. For 1985, to lower production costs, the external &quot;Electronic Fuel Injection&quot; and &quot;Automatic Overdrive&quot; emblems were deleted (both had become standard features); for 1986, a CHMSL (center brake light) was introduced.

For 1988, the Grand Marquis underwent a mid-cycle revision, with restyled front and rear fascias, better integrating the bumpers into the bodywork. To save weight, steel bumpers were replaced by aluminum.

==== Interior ====
From 1979 to 1991, the Grand Marquis sedan was offered solely as a six-passenger sedan with a front bench seat. While mostly similar to its Ford counterpart, the dashboard of the Grand Marquis was trimmed with brushed stainless steel; in place of the horizontal speedometer, the Grand Marquis was fitted with two square pods for the fuel gauge, warning lights, and speedometer.

In 1985, the dashboard underwent several revisions. Alongside the adoption of a single-DIN radio unit (phased in across all Ford vehicles), the 8-track cassette player and CB radio options were discontinued; control of the horn shifted from the turn signal stalk to the steering wheel.

As part of the 1988 revision, the interior was updated with all-new seats (distinguished by taller head restraints) and an updated dashboard (with more wood trim and revised gauges). The Grand Marquis LS received options including a JBL Audio 6-speaker AM/FM/Cassette stereo system (with a power antenna) and a heated windshield called &quot;Instaclear.&quot;

For 1990, the interior underwent a second major revision. To comply with passive-restraint regulations, the Grand Marquis was given a driver-side airbag; the rear outboard seats received 3-point seatbelts. Coinciding with the addition of the airbag, a new steering column consolidated the turn signal and windshield wiper controls onto a single stalk; tilt steering became standard. The dashboard was completely redesigned, adopted the horizontal speedometer used by Ford (using a silver background); for the first time, a temperature gauge was included alongside the fuel gauge.

=== Trim ===
From 1979 to 1982, the Grand Marquis returned as a sub-model of the Mercury Marquis model line. Marketed as the flagship Mercury nameplate, the Grand Marquis competed against the Buick Electra, Oldsmobile 98, and Chrysler New Yorker (and New Yorker Fifth Avenue). For 1983, the Grand Marquis was expanded to an unnamed standard trim and the top-trim LS. The former effectively replaced the Marquis Brougham (the mid-size Marquis adopted the Brougham nameplate), and the latter was a trim designation adopted across the Mercury model line during the 1980s.

As part of the 1988 model update, the standard-trim Grand Marquis became the GS (in line with the Topaz and Sable). The badging of the model line underwent a revision, as the script lettering used since its 1975 introduction was replaced by block-style lettering (in the style of the Sable, Topaz, and Tracer); the Lincoln-style hood ornament was replaced by a version with the Mercury &quot;flying M&quot; badge,&quot; which were added to the trunk lid and wheels.

=== Production ===
== Second generation (1992–1997) ==


Unveiled on November 28, 1990, for the 1992 model year, both Ford and Mercury Panther-platform cars underwent their most extensive changes since their introduction for the 1979 model year. While the chassis was retained, the body was all-new. After thirteen years on the market, the full-size sedans from Mercury and Ford were struggling against far more modern competition. Additionally, as an unintentional consequence of years of badge engineering, the Grand Marquis and its LTD Crown Victoria counterpart were left as virtual identical twins. The Grand Marquis and Ford Crown Victoria (no longer an LTD model) were given different bodies; the only visually shared body parts were the front doors and the windshield. Development began in early 1987, with a design approval in 1988, January 14, 1991, the start of production, and March 21, 1991, introduction.

In line with the rest of the Ford Motor Company vehicles sold in North America, aerodynamics and fuel economy played a prominent role in designing the new Grand Marquis. Unlike the Crown Victoria, which followed the design themes of the Ford Taurus, the Grand Marquis continued with traditional styling features, such as full-width taillights, a formal roofline, and a chrome waterfall grille. The chrome waterfall grille became a signature styling feature across the Mercury product line from the late 1990s.

As part of the redesign, Ford sought a new type of buyer for its full-size Mercury sedan; instead of the older buyers who traditionally bought them, the 1992 Grand Marquis was marketed to younger buyers in need of a larger car than a Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable. The opera lamps and padded vinyl top were discontinued (the latter becoming a dealer-installed option). Aluminum alloy road wheels replaced the simulated wire wheel covers. Revisions to the suspension and steering were made to improve both ride and handling. Four-wheel disc brakes replaced the rear drum brakes with ABS traction control optional.

As with the 1988-1991 models, the Grand Marquis was available in base-trim GS and deluxe-trim LS models. Front cornering lamps distinguish LS models. From 1992 onward, the Grand Marquis was produced solely as a four-door sedan, as the Colony Park station wagon was discontinued. Ford&#x27;s proprietary door-mounted keypad system, marketed as &quot;Securicode&quot;, became optional on lower-trim models and standard on upper-trim packages.

=== Year-to-year changes ===


===1992=== 
* Second-generation Grand Marquis introduced at the North American International Auto Show on January 11, 1991, after the November 28, 1990 unveiling. It launched on March 21, 1991, as an early 1992 model. All models come with driver&#x27;s-side airbag standard with an optional passenger-side airbag. Partway through the model year, the AOD transmission was replaced by the AOD-E, which brought a different bellhousing pattern.
===1993===
* Dual airbags have become standard equipment for all models. Radios are redesigned with a new control layout.
===1994=== 
* Increased side door impact protection. The A/C refrigerant changed from R-12 to R-134a. 
===1995=== 
* Mid-cycle redesign. Exterior trim features increased use of body-color trim and less chrome. On the front, a larger, rounder grille is better integrated into the body, while all lights on the front are changed to clear lenses. The license plate is now centered in between the taillamps. On the trunk lid, the &quot;Mercury&quot; and &quot;Grand Marquis&quot; lettering is italicized and reduced in size. The interior is updated with new seats, door panels, and the dashboard is redesigned. Switching locations with the climate controls, a Double-DIN radio featured large buttons and knobs; on models without automatic climate controls, rotary knobs replaced sliding controls. The power seat controls, if specified, were now located on the door panels, along with enlarged buttons for the power windows and door locks. The outdated horizontal speedometer was replaced by the instrument cluster used in the Crown Victoria (adding a voltmeter and oil-pressure gauge); a digital instrument panel with the trip computer was still an option.
===1996=== 
* No significant changes. Inside, the Ford &quot;brick&quot; airbag wheel, which has been used since 1990, was replaced with a new design shared with many Ford and Lincoln-Mercury cars, integrating the horn into a smaller steering wheel hub.
* The car could now run on natural gas.
* OBD-II was now used.
* New colors.

===1997===
* Last year for the second-generation Grand Marquis. The Mercury emblems are removed from the C-pillars. Following the discontinuation of the Chevrolet Caprice and Buick Roadmaster by General Motors, 1997 Grand Marquis sales would rise over 20% in comparison to 1996.
===Powertrain===
While the Panther platform was carried over from 1991, an all-new engine would be used for the 1992 Grand Marquis. The replacement for the OHV 5.0 L and 5.8 L Windsor V8s, the 4.6 L SOHC Modular V8 engine was the first overhead-cam V8 to appear in an American-market full-size sedan. An optional handling package, including a heavy-duty suspension, 3.27 rear-axle (instead of 2.73), and a dual-exhaust system that raised engine output to , was optional. It was essentially the counterpart to the Ford Crown Victoria Touring Sedan.

All models of the Grand Marquis were coupled to a 4-speed automatic transmission. For 1993, the hydraulically controlled AOD transmission was replaced by the electronically controlled AOD-E transmission. In 1995, the AOD-E was replaced by the heavier-duty 4R70W transmission; it was shared with the Lincoln Mark VIII and Town Car.

=== Production ===
While the redesigned 1992 Grand Marquis/Crown Victoria would prove more fuel-efficient than their predecessors, a loophole in CAFE regulations allowed Ford Motor Company to sell full-size cars and improve the average economy of all of its cars. CAFE regulations require vehicles with fewer than 75% domestic parts content to be counted as part of an automaker&#x27;s imported fleet rather than a domestic one. During the 1991 retooling for production of 1992 models at its St. Thomas, Ontario facility, Ford switched a number of its parts suppliers from Canada and the United States to suppliers outside North America, bringing the domestic parts content of the Grand Marquis and Crown Victoria below 75%. The Grand Marquis was now part of a fleet consisting primarily of the far more fuel-efficient Ford Festiva rather than other V8-engined cars such as the Cougar and Ford Mustang.

After 1996, General Motors ended production of its B-platform sedans, discontinuing the Buick Roadmaster and Chevrolet Caprice; without its closest direct competitors, Ford and Lincoln-Mercury were left with a highly profitable market niche essentially to themselves; however, several competitors began to introduce competitive vehicles in the segment. Replacing the outdated Imperial and Fifth Avenue, the 1994 Chrysler New Yorker (bench seat) and LHS (bucket seats) were the first Chrysler sedans to match the interior dimensions of the Grand Marquis since the 1970s. For 1995, the Toyota Avalon was the first Japanese-brand sedan sold with six-passenger seating (although assembled in the United States); an extended-wheelbase version of the Camry, the Avalon was considered a full-size sedan based on its interior space.

==Third generation (1998–2002)==
The third-generation Grand Marquis went on sale in late 1997 for the 1998 model year with an evolutionary update to the exterior and interior. While the 1992 Crown Victoria was better received in the marketplace than the new-for-1991 Chevrolet Caprice, its exterior design (inspired by the Ford Taurus) was not as popularly accepted as the Grand Marquis. The Grand Marquis outsold the Crown Victoria in 1994 and 1997, despite the latter&#x27;s police and fleet sales advantage. Ford took note and kept the Grand Marquis&#x27; design language in place for 1998 while bringing much of it to the Crown Victoria to pivot away from 1992 to the 1997 &quot;Aero&quot; look.

To streamline production, Ford and Mercury returned to a shared rear roofline between the two model lines, using the formal rear styling of the Grand Marquis; the configuration would remain in use through the end of production in 2011.

With General Motors&#x27; full-size B-body vehicles discontinued in 1996 to focus on more profitable SUVs and trucks, the third-generation Grand Marquis primarily competed against its Ford Crown Victoria counterpart. They remained successful, selling over 100,000 units per year.

=== Chassis specification ===
The third-generation Grand Marquis retained the Panther chassis from its predecessors, lengthened in wheelbase to 114.7 inches. To upgrade handling stability, the triangulated four-link rear axle (in use on large Fords since 1965) was replaced by a four-link rear axle with a Watt&#x27;s linkage, though a solid rear axle was retained. To improve braking, the four-wheel disc brakes were given dual-piston calipers for the front rotors, requiring 16-inch wheels. ABS was initially standard for 1998, then became optional in 2001, and again became standard in 2002. The traction control (which remained an option) was revised to work at any speed (rather than only low speeds).

==== Powertrain ====
The third-generation Grand Marquis retained the same powertrain as the 1995–1997 Grand Marquis, with a 4.6 L Modular V8 and a four-speed 4R70W automatic transmission. In a minor revision, several under-hood components were relocated, with the power steering reservoir attached to the engine and the coolant overflow reservoir relocated onto the radiator (both were located on a fender). In another change, the engine was converted to coil-on-plug ignition along with fail-safe cooling using a dual-speed electric fan.

For 1998, the standard-equipment V8 (with single exhaust) was increased in output to (from 190). The handling suspension package continued in production, paired with the dual-exhaust version of the 4.6 L V8, producing . For 2001, the engine received redesigned cylinder heads and a new intake manifold called &quot;Performance Improved&quot; (P.I.), which increased horsepower to , respectively.

A 2.73 rear-axle ratio was paired with single-exhaust engines; a numerically higher rear-axle ratio was used as part of the handling package. For 2000 and early 2001, a 3.55 rear axle was used; other versions used a 3.27 rear axle.

=== Variants ===

==== Handling &amp; Performance Package ====
Carried over from the second generation, the Handling &amp; Performance Package was initially available on both GS and LS trims. The package included sport-tuned front shocks and springs; larger front and rear sway bars; a heavy-duty rear suspension with air springs; shorter rear gearing for better off-the-line acceleration; a higher stall 11.25-inch torque converter (2000–mid 2001 only); dual exhaust; auxiliary oil-to-air coolers for the power steering and transmission; sport-tuned steering; and lace-spoke 16-inch wheels. In 2002, the package was restricted to LS models only.

==== Grand Marquis LSE ====
At the 2001 Chicago Auto Show, Mercury introduced a new trim package for the Grand Marquis named LSE. Using the basis of both the LS trim and the Handling &amp; Performance Package, the LSE added five-passenger seating with front bucket seats, a floor-mounted shifter, and a center console. The center console featured a large storage bin with a cigar lighter, dual cup holders, and a padded armrest. Options on the LS, such as a leather-wrapped steering wheel with temperature and audio controls, electronic climate controls (EATC), and dual 8-way power seats, were standard on the LSE. In addition to these features, the LSE included all mechanical upgrades found on the Handling &amp; Performance Package and used the same lace-spoke 16-inch wheels on P225/60TR16 tires.

According to Mercury, the LSE offered a compelling balance of performance and comfort. It was introduced to the lineup to boost consumer interest in the model and went on sale beginning midyear 2001. For the 2001 model year, the base price of the LSE was US$28,295.

All LSEs are Grand Marquis LS models according to their VIN and are badged as such. LSEs did not have a separate VIN designation. The LSE name was only found on the front carpet mats included from the factory.

=== Body design and interior ===
While strongly resembling the previous generation, the 1998 Grand Marquis shared only the roof stamping and doors from its 1997 predecessor. Designers revised the front and rear bumpers, squaring off their design. The exterior trim was simplified, with the chrome trim removed above the headlamps. The rear fascia resembles the Crown Victoria but uses a red lens panel between the taillights. The grille was restyled slightly as a larger version of the 1995-1997 design.

The interior was mostly carried over from the 1995 update, with a two-spoke steering wheel replacing the previous four-spoke design. Seats were freshened with slightly revised designs, and the chrome trim was deleted from the column-mounted gear shifter and the turn signal lever. The interior backlighting was switched from light blue to green, and the gauge cluster needles, which were previously orange, were now red. In 2000, several federally-mandated features were added to the interior: an emergency release handle inside the trunk, LATCH anchors, and a &quot;Belt Minder&quot; (chime that sounds when an occupant is not belted in). New seat belt designs became standard in 2001 as part of the addition of Mercury&#x27;s Personal Safety System, which also included dual-stage airbags and seat position sensors. Additionally, for 2001, redundant steering wheel controls for both the climate control and radio became available as optional equipment on LS models. Lastly, a wood-grain steering wheel, similar to that found on the Town Car, became available as an option in 2001.


== Fourth generation (2003–2011) ==



For 2003, the Grand Marquis received mechanical, exterior, and interior styling updates (along with the Ford Crown Victoria, and Lincoln Town Car). The Panther chassis was redesigned. In the retail market, the Grand Marquis replaced the Ford Crown Victoria, which became available only for fleet sales beginning in 2008. During the 2000s, Mercury would introduce two additional full-size sedans: the revived Mercury Marauder, an equipment variant of the Grand Marquis, and the Mercury Montego (rebranded the 2008-2009 Mercury Sable).

=== Exterior ===
Styling revisions extended to bumper fascias, waterfall-style grille, headlamps and side markers, frame-less windshield wipers, and rear fascia. An optional Grand Marquis LS Limited Edition trim level featured a hood ornament and two-tone paint. 

=== Chassis and powertrain ===
A revised frame featured hydro-formed frame rails, an aluminum #2 cross-member, and was now fully boxed. According to Mercury, the new frame was 20% more resistant to vertical bending. Coil-over front shocks were adopted, with revised steering knuckles, revised upper control arms, and new aluminum lower control arms. In the rear, mono-tube shocks were introduced; they were also inverted and mounted outside the frame rails. The new suspension required that Mercury change the wheel designs to those with a high-positive offset. A quiet EBD booster with a mechanical panic assist system was added, improving front-rear brake bias. An electronic variable assist rack and pinion power steering replaced the previous recirculating ball system; the new steering unit was also speed-sensitive and 22.5 pounds lighter than the previous configuration. The exhaust system was re-designed with frame-mounted hangers.

The 4.6L V8 engine and the 4R70W four-speed automatic transmission were carried over. The engine featured a knock sensor and revised tuning, rated at with a single exhaust system and at with dual exhaust. Horsepower and torque ratings would remain the same through to the end of production in 2011. The oil pan was enlarged by 20% to six quarts. Other changes included a re-designed intake manifold with an aluminum water crossover, and an electronic return-less fuel system with a revised EGR setup. The updated engine was distinguished by a redesigned engine cover, featuring a silver &quot;V8&quot; emblem; the oil filler cap was moved to the passenger-side valve cover, and the power steering fluid reservoir was relocated from the timing cover to the radiator shroud. A new and improved variable-speed electronic radiator fan replaced the outgoing two-speed unit.

=== Interior ===
The redesigned Grand Marquis featured updated door panels and redesigned controls, but retained the previous dashboard, which has been used since 1995. Seats featured revised upholstery and larger front headrests. A new dual media (cassette/CD) radio was initially standard, and became optional midway through the 2003 model year. Wiper-activated headlights were now standard. A shoulder belt was added for the rear middle passenger along with second-generation rear child seat anchors, and side airbags were introduced as an option; they became standard for 2009.

=== Trim ===
As part of the redesign, Mercury revised available trims for 2003. The Grand Marquis was expanded to four instead of the traditional two-model line. In addition to the base-trim GS, there was now GS Convenience, LS Premium, and LS Ultimate.

GS models included six-passenger seating with an 8-way power driver seat, an AM/FM/CD/Cassette radio (deleted in favor of a cassette-only unit in mid-2003, then a single CD player beginning in 2005), manual temperature controls, power mirrors, heated mirrors (2003 only), power locks and windows, cruise control, Mercury&#x27;s SecuriLock passive anti-theft system (PATS), and Mercury&#x27;s Personal Safety System. Freestanding options available on the base GS were limited to heated mirrors (2004–08), an AM/FM/CD radio (mid-2003-04), chromed wheel covers (2004–07, standard for 08), rear air suspension (2007–08), and two-tone paint.

Over the standard GS, the GS Convenience added all-speed traction control, power-adjustable pedals, rear reading lamps, body-side paint stripes, and Ford&#x27;s proprietary door-mounted keypad system, marketed as &quot;Securicode&quot;. Additionally, several free-standing options were available on the GS Convenience: leather seating, a full-size spare tire, chromed wheel covers (2004–06), heated mirrors (2004-06), and a trunk organizer. A GS Convenience Two-Tone Edition was offered from 2005 to 2006. Aside from two-tone paint, it included pinstripes, body-colored side moldings, unique scuff plates &amp; C-pillar badging, chromed wheel covers, a hood ornament, and body-colored door handles. Interior features of this package included leather-trimmed seating with the Mercury logo stitched into the front seat-backs. Following the 2006 model year, the GS Convenience was dropped from the lineup. Many of its standard features and free-standing options were made available on the base GS through packages such as the GS Comfort Appearance Package (included leather-trimmed seats and 16-inch aluminum wheels), as well as the GS Confidence Package (included traction control, heated mirrors, and fog lamps).

LS Premium models added aluminum wheels, wide body-side moldings with bright inserts, an 8-way power passenger seat (this would later become optional), an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, electronic automatic temperature control (EATC), a leather-wrapped steering wheel, an overhead console, and an instrument cluster with a digital message center (2006-2011). Freestanding options available on the LS Premium included a six-disc CD changer radio with a subwoofer (an Audiophile unit on 2005 and newer models), chromed aluminum wheels, LSE package (later replaced by the Handling package), heated front seats, leather-trimmed seats, side airbags, heated mirrors (made standard again for 2006), and PPG laminated side windows (2004–05). Following the 2006 model year, the LS Premium was renamed back to LS.

The range-topping LS Ultimate added rear-air suspension with a rear stabilizer bar, &quot;Ultimate&quot; fender badging, standard leather seating, an AM/FM/CD/Cassette player (AM/FM/CD radio on later models), a fully digital gauge cluster (2003–05), and a steering wheel with redundant controls. In addition to the options on the LS Premium, the Ultimate offered an optional wood-grain steering wheel. The LS Ultimate would not be available for 2008, but returned for 2009.

The LSE was not a separate trim version, but a package for LS Premium models. It replaced the Handling and Performance Package available on the third-generation model. The LSE offered five-passenger seating with leather, dual power bucket seats, a center console, and a floor shifter. Mechanically, the LSE had a larger front sway bar &amp; rear sway bar, power steering &amp; transmission coolers, uniquely tuned rear air springs, dual exhaust, a 3.27:1 rear axle ratio, and a 16x7 inch &quot;snowflake&quot; wheel design similar to those on the 2003-2005 Crown Victoria LX Handling and Performance Package (HPP); the difference being that the LSE&#x27;s wheel pockets were painted grey versus HPP&#x27;s machined wheel pockets. The 2003 LSE was short-lived for the U.S. market, as its production ended in December 2002. However, a limited number of LSEs continued to be produced for the Canadian market in 2003 and 2004; it briefly returned to the U.S. market for 2005.

From 2003 to 2005, a Limited Edition version of the LS model was sold. This included an appearance package with chromed mirrors, body-colored door handles, and a two-tone leather interior. Limited Edition models also came with side airbags standard. They included a Mercury badge hood ornament, making its return for the first time since 1991.

From 2006 to 2007, a Handling package was offered on the LS trim. It was a direct replacement for the outgoing LSE package and included all of its features except for a new nine-spoke machined 16x7-inch wheel design shared with the 2006-07 Crown Victoria LX HPP and six-passenger bench seating.

For 2007 and 2008 LS models, a Palm Beach trim option was available; it consisted primarily of unique upholstery and badging.

Following the introduction of a &quot;No-Stock&quot; marketing guideline by Lincoln-Mercury, the Grand Marquis trim line underwent a revision for 2009. Aside from long-wheelbase GCC export models, the GS was dropped, while the LS was split into two series: LS Fleet and LS Retail. The former was available exclusively for fleet purchase in the United States, while the latter was available only by dealer special order to minimize unsold inventory of cars. Moreover, incentives such as $4,000 per vehicle were added to remove previous stock from dealer lots. After Ford announced the discontinuation of the Mercury brand in June 2010, all 2011 cars were Mercury Grand Marquis LS Ultimate Editions.

==== 2003 Mid-year De-contenting ====
Midway through the 2003 model year, Ford introduced production changes for the Grand Marquis (and all Panther platform vehicles) to reduce production costs by approximately $4,000,000 annually. Vehicles built after December 2002 no longer included a remote-release fuel door (introduced in 1992), black B-pillars (switched to body-color paint), map pockets on the front seats, an instrument panel digital clock (a feature integrated into the radio on other Ford vehicles), a standard dual-media radio (CD/cassette), automatic parking brake release, foam sound insulating strips inside the headliner, silver V8 emblem on the engine &quot;beauty cover&quot;, under-hood bulb, or an air intake sound resonator. Furthermore, the Grand Marquis no longer included a rear sway bar except for LS Ultimate or vehicles with the Handling Package. The five-passenger LSE package was discontinued for the U.S. market. Several colors were dropped from the model line, including Deep Wedgwood Blue, Matador Red Metallic, Gold Ash Metallic, Aspen Green Metallic, Silver Frost Metallic, and Chestnut Clearcoat Metallic.

For 2004, laminated safety glass became an option, and GS-trim vehicles featured a new wheel cover design.

For the 2005 model year, an all-new steering wheel design was introduced (for the first time since 1998), and the Grand Marquis offered a fully digital instrument cluster as an option for the last time. For LS-trim vehicles, an Audiophile six-disc in-dash CD changer was provided as an option (similar to the Montego and sourced from the Lincoln Town Car). The LSE package made a return; however, only 533 examples were produced. Due to a supply chain issue, the radio antenna was removed from the rear windshield and placed on the rear fender (it would return to the rear window for 2006). Minor deletions included the removal of illuminated vanity mirrors for GS-trim vehicles and deleting &quot;Grand Marquis&quot; insignia on the center of the dash trim. In a functional change, drive-by-wire throttle control was introduced, and the cruise control function to the engine computer itself was relocated above the driver-side inner fender. A sound resonator was returned to the air intake, featuring a 70mm mass airflow sensor. The four-speed transmission, now designated the 4R70E, received upgraded electronics. Updated crash severity sensors and a front-passenger weight sensor were introduced, allowing the restraint system to enable or disable the front passenger airbag as needed automatically.

===2006 update and later years===
For 2006, the Grand Marquis received the final styling update of any Ford Panther-platform vehicle. An all-new front fascia was fitted with a rectangular grille (similar to the 1988-91 Grand Marquis); for the first time, fog lamps were offered as an option. The rear fascia adopted a dark grey applique between the tail lamps.

The instrument panel received a revised gauge package with a tachometer. On LS models, the new instrument panel consolidated many features previously used by the overhead console into a message center, allowing the driver to perform a system check, view/reset oil life, distance to empty, average/instant fuel economy, and trip time. Revisions featured a redundant digital speedometer and a built-in compass. The LSE package was replaced by the optional Handling Package for the LS trim, which retained the previous chassis upgrades (but not the 5-passenger seating configuration); the Handling Package also featured a new alloy wheel design. Sourced from the F-Series and E-Series, the Grand Marquis received a revised 4-speed 4R75E transmission.

For 2007, the 4.6L V8 received flex-fuel capability (E85), and the side airbags were revised to improve safety.

For 2008, the handling package was discontinued. The Grand Marquis was thus marketed exclusively in the single exhaust configuration for most markets (except for GCC export models).

In 2009, side airbags became standard equipment; recessed window switches were introduced to comply with federal safety standards. The GS trim was also dropped, and the LS trims were available in fleet or retail variants.

For 2010, the Grand Marquis adopted the extended transmission tail-shaft housing from the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor.

For its shortened 2011 model year, the Grand Marquis received redesigned front-seat headrests in compliance with updated federal safety standards.

=== Sales ===


==Export markets==
The Grand Marquis was sold throughout North America during its production, although it was not always badged as a Mercury. Outside of North America, exports were concentrated on the Middle Eastern market, where its large size and V8 power were attributes sought by buyers towards the end of production.

===Canada===
After 1999, Ford of Canada discontinued sales of the Ford Crown Victoria outside of commercial fleets and law enforcement, concentrating civilian sales in Canada on the Mercury Grand Marquis. Following the 2004 model year, the Mercury brand was phased out in Canada, though Ford of Canada would market the Grand Marquis through its Ford dealerships. Sales continued through the end of production in 2011, as the redesigned 2011 Ford Taurus replaced it.

===Mexico===
Ford de Mexico would twice market the Mercury Grand Marquis under the Ford brand. In 1982, the Grand Marquis was introduced as the replacement for the Ford LTD Crown Victoria and wagons, but it was always sold in Mexico as a Ford model. The Grand Marquis wagon was produced and sold for the Mexican market as the Ford Grand Marquis Country Squire and sold through the 1984 model year. From 1982 until 1984, it was manufactured in Mexico. When it was reintroduced for the 1992 model year, it was imported from St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada. Wearing both Ford and Mercury badging, the Grand Marquis adopted a Ford Blue Oval on the trunk lid after 1998. From 1992 until its demise in 2004, all versions were equipped with a real dual-exhaust setup. 

Although the Ford Grand Marquis was considered a sales success in Mexico and developed a reputation for luxury and prestige as the most expensive domestic nameplate available for sale, as in the United States, sales began to decline as the model aged and more modern competitors were introduced to the market. For the 2005 model year, Ford de Mexico replaced the Grand Marquis with the Ford Five Hundred, sold through 2007.

===Middle East (GCC)===
The Grand Marquis and its Ford Crown Victoria counterpart were marketed in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The &quot;GCC-Spec&quot; vehicles initially offered a lower price, reliability, and relative simplicity (compared to German and Japanese luxury sedans). Nevertheless, the GCC-spec Mercury Grand Marquis began to lose market share in the 2000s towards updated competitors (such as the Holden-produced Chevrolet Caprice and Dodge Charger).

====Modification====

Produced alongside North American examples in St. Thomas, Ontario, GCC-Spec versions of the Mercury Grand Marquis included several mechanical and trim modifications.

All included the High Ambient Temperature and Speed Package, heavy-duty battery, and an auxiliary transmission fluid cooler. Before 2002, export vehicles included a catalytic converter delete option. All standard-wheelbase examples were fitted with true dual exhaust.

The Grand Marquis was available with an Export Handling Package as an option to upgrade handling. The counterpart to the Handling and Performance Package sold in the United States, the Export Handling Package consisted of rear air suspension (with stiffer springs), a larger front stabilizer bar, and a heavy-duty rear stabilizer bar. In contrast to the U.S., the GCC-spec option retained the stock rear axle ratio. Standard on the LS trim level, the package was available for any standard-wheelbase GCC-spec Grand Marquis. Following 2003, the model was identified by a trunk lid spoiler (shared with the Mercury Marauder).

From 1998, the GCC-spec Mercury Grand Marquis was fitted with the 40/20/40 split front seats of the Lincoln Town Car (in place of a 50/50 split bench). To accommodate the Middle Eastern climate, cloth seats are standard equipment, with leather upholstery as an option. In addition, the language of warning labels was in Arabic.

====Trim variation====

Middle Eastern versions of the Grand Marquis have slightly different options and features than their North American counterparts. Before 2009, six different trim levels were available: 
*GS
*GS Convenience
*GSL (Long wheelbase version)
*LS (LSE package limited to mid-2001 to mid-2003 and 2005 model year)
*LS Premium
*LS Ultimate

In 2009, the LS models were only available with a column shifter and 40/20/40 Lincoln Town Car seats in luxury cloth or leather trim. The GSL is a long-wheelbase model offering of extra legroom for rear passengers. It is equipped like an LS model, with standard features such as an 8-way power driver&#x27;s seat (2-way manual passenger seat), side airbags, leather-wrapped steering wheel, automatically dimming rearview mirror, electronic climate control, power-adjustable pedals, premium sound system with CD and cassette, 17-inch wheels with 235/55WR17 Goodyear Eagle RS-A tires, heated door mirrors, fog lights and special &quot;GSL&quot; badging. The once-optional gauge cluster is standard, with controls on the dashboard&#x27;s center between the audio unit and climate controls. In North America, this model was only available to fleet customers as a commercial (taxi) version of the Ford Crown Victoria.

For the 2009 model year, the Grand Marquis was available in two trim levels, GSL and LS, which were near-identical regarding features and options. The LS was a de-contented fleet model that lost standard features such as an overhead console with a compass and a power passenger seat. The Export Handling Package was dropped, eliminating features such as the Mercury Marauder spoiler and rear air suspension.

The GS model reappeared in the lineup for the 2010 model year. Several features (such as the Mercury Marauder spoiler) became available as standalone options. The Export Handling Package was made standard and included a power passenger seat. In Kuwait, the LS model (M7F) was not available to the general public in 2010, as they are heavily sold to fleet buyers, such as the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Health, and state-owned Kuwait Oil Company, where they are given to employees as fringe benefits.

For the 2011 model year, the long-wheelbase GSL was replaced by the GS, and the LS model was made available again to the general public in Kuwait. The LS Ultimate Edition remains a Fleet model and differed slightly from the GS, equipped with leather seats, electronic automatic temperature control (EATC), and an automatically dimming rear-view mirror. Lumbar support was no longer available.

==Discontinuation== 
In 2006, Ford&#x27;s The Way Forward restructuring plan detailed that the company would be closing 14 manufacturing plants in North America by 2012. This was estimated to save Ford nearly US$5,000,000,000 and reduce their workforce by nearly 30,000. The St. Thomas Assembly Plant, where the Grand Marquis and Crown Victoria were assembled, was switched to a single daily production shift to reduce operating costs, with the Lincoln Town Car joining the two in production at St. Thomas by 2008.

Consequently, in 2008, Ford indicated that the St. Thomas Assembly Plant would be closing by 2010. However, the Canadian Auto Workers Union successfully negotiated an extension to at least 2011. The closure was made official in 2009, as Ford confirmed that the St. Thomas Assembly would be closed at the end of 2011.

Moreover, due to the severe effects of the 2008–2010 automotive industry crisis, on June 2, 2010, Ford formally announced that it would end production of all Mercury vehicles by the end of 2010; the brand was discontinued after 72 years. In September 2010, the final Grand Marquis models for retail sale were produced after a short production run. Slated to end production in December 2010, the production of fleet models was extended due to a parts shortage at St. Thomas Assembly. The final Grand Marquis, a white LS Fleet model, was produced on January 4, 2011, at 7:46 am. It was the very last Mercury produced by Ford. The St. Thomas Assembly plant in Ontario, Canada, closed on September 15, 2011, ending the production of the Ford Crown Victoria and Lincoln Town Car.

In continuous production for 36 years, the Grand Marquis was the longest-produced and second best-selling Mercury (behind the Cougar), with over 2.7 million produced. Among Ford Motor Company models in North America, only the Ford Econoline, Ford Mustang, Ford Thunderbird, Ford F-Series, and Lincoln Continental nameplates have been produced longer. The Panther platform was the basis for Grand Marquis design for 32 years. Nearly unmatched by other automakers for longevity, the Grand Marquis&#x27;s external appearance remained unchanged for the last 19 years of its production life (along with its engine, the 2011 model shared many body panels with its 1992 counterpart).

<doc id="881738" wikidata="Q1634558" url="?curid=881738" title="Hugh W. Sloan Jr.">
<text>Hugh W. Sloan Jr. (born November 1, 1940) was treasurer of the Committee to Re-elect the President, Richard M. Nixon&#x27;s 1972 campaign committee. Previously, he was an aide to White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman.

He resigned from the Committee to Re-elect over ethics concerns related to actions behind the Watergate scandal. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, in their book &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, portrayed Sloan as one of the few honest men they interviewed.

==Life and career==
Sloan was born in Princeton, New Jersey. He attended Hotchkiss and spent his last year of preparatory school at the Aldenham School in Elstree, Hertfordshire, England. He graduated with a B.A. (Honors) from Princeton University in 1963, and then served in the United States Navy until 1965.

In 1965 he worked as a fund raiser for the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, then for the Republican National Finance Committee until 1968.

In 1968 Sloan served as assistant finance director on the Nixon–Agnew Finance Committee, then after the election served as a personal aide to Nixon on the Presidential Transition Committee until early 1969, when he joined the White House Staff as an assistant to Dwight Chapin on January 20. Under direction of Chapin, Sloan supervised the mail operation in the appointments office, which included handling all invitations to the president. He was also responsible for staffing and planning White House social functions until early March 1971.

That same year he married Deborah Murray and served as a finance/campaign expert for what was originally the Citizens Committee to Re-Elect the President, then headed by acting director Jeb Magruder, (who became deputy campaign director when John Mitchell resigned from the Justice Department to take up his political duties full-time in 1972). The organization was renamed the Committee for Re-Election of the President (CRP), with Sloan as its treasurer.

Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein said that Mark Felt told them that Sloan knew nothing about the Watergate burglary or how the money he disbursed was actually used. Sloan resigned when he found out what the White House Plumbers were up to and became a source for Woodward and Bernstein. Sloan was not identified by name in their &quot;Washington Post&quot; stories about the Watergate scandal,but was in their book about their reporting of it, &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, in which he was portrayed as one of the few honest men they interviewed.

Sloan subsequently became a trustee of Princeton University. Since 1985 he has been a director of the Manulife Financial Corporation, a Canadian-based financial services group. From 1998 to 2008 he was deputy chairman of Woodbridge Foam, a supplier of urethane technologies to the automotive industry. Sloan is also a director of Wescast Industries, an automotive supplier whose stock trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

==Portrayal in film==
Stephen Collins portrayed Sloan in Alan J. Pakula&#x27;s 1976 film &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;.
