==Etymology==
&quot;Asan&quot;, a species of tree which generally grows thirty meters tall, is found on the banks of the Damodar River; &quot;sol&quot; refers to land. The name &quot;Asansol&quot; is a combination of these two words. Asansol is a city on the banks of Damodar and its land is rich in minerals.

Historically the city was anglicised as &quot;Assensole&quot; during the British era but the name was reverted after Independence.

==History==
The region is believed to have been a part of the kingdom of Vishnupur where the Malla dynasty ruled for approximately a thousand years till the emergence of the British. This theory is backed by the presence of Vishnupur style temple present at Chhotodighari village and Domohani village in Asansol.

<doc id="893026" wikidata="Q342586" url="?curid=893026" title="Ken Salazar">
<text>Kenneth Lee Salazar (born March 2, 1955) is an American lawyer, politician, and diplomat who served as United States ambassador to Mexico from 2021 to 2025. He previously served as the 50th United States Secretary of the Interior in the administration of President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2013. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously was a United States Senator from Colorado from 2005 to 2009. 

Salazar served as Attorney General of Colorado from 1999 to 2005. He became the first Latino Senator representing Colorado in 2005. He and Mel Martínez (R-Florida) were the first Hispanic U.S. senators since 1977; they were joined by Bob Menendez (D-New Jersey) in 2006. 

On December 17, 2008, President-elect Obama announced he would nominate Salazar as U.S. secretary of the interior. The environmentalist movement&#x27;s reaction to this nomination was mixed. Previously, Salazar supported the nomination of Gale Norton to Secretary of the Interior, President George W. Bush&#x27;s first appointee who preceded Salazar as Colorado Attorney General. On January 20, 2009, Salazar was confirmed by unanimous consent in the Senate. On January 16, 2013, it was reported that Salazar planned to resign his post as Secretary of the Interior in March 2013, but his resignation was delayed pending Senate confirmation of his successor, Sally Jewell. On June 10, 2013, he became a partner in the major international law firm of WilmerHale, and was tasked with opening a Denver office for the firm. On August 16, 2016, Salazar was appointed to head presidential candidate Hillary Clinton&#x27;s transition team.

In May 2021, President Joe Biden nominated Salazar as the United States ambassador to Mexico. His nomination was confirmed by a voice vote in the United States Senate on August 11, 2021.

== Early life and education ==
Ken Salazar was born in Alamosa, Colorado, the son of Emma Montoya and Enrique Salazar. His elder brother is former Congressman John Salazar. He grew up near Manassa, in the community of Los Rincones in the San Luis Valley area of south-central Colorado. Salazar attended St. Francis Seminary and Centauri High School in La Jara, graduating in 1973. He later attended Colorado College, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1977, and received his Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1981. Later Salazar was awarded honorary degrees (Doctor of Laws) from Colorado College (1993) and the University of Denver (1999). After graduating, Salazar started private law practice.

Salazar&#x27;s Hispanic roots trace back to the Hispanos of New Mexico before New Mexico and Colorado were split up when they became part of Southwestern United States. He has identified as a Mexican American saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve been taunted, called names—from &#x27;dirty Mexican&#x27; to lots of other names—as I was growing up, and even now as a United States Senator.&quot;

== Career ==

=== Colorado cabinet ===
In 1986, Salazar became Chief Legal Counsel to then Colorado Governor Roy Romer. In 1990, Romer appointed him to his Cabinet as director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources.

In this position, he authored the Great Outdoors Colorado Amendment, which created a massive land conservation program of which he became chairman. Salazar also created the Youth in Natural Resources program, giving thousands of Colorado&#x27;s youth an opportunity to work and learn about Colorado&#x27;s natural resources in public schools. The Great Outdoors Colorado program&#x27;s success was a model for President Obama&#x27;s America&#x27;s Great Outdoors Initiative to create a 21st-century agenda for conservation and outdoor recreation.

In his cabinet role, he established reforms that forced mining and petroleum operations to better protect the surrounding environment and helped plan and promote Denver&#x27;s South Platte River Valley redevelopment, transforming the area from an abandoned wasteland to a vibrant economic center.

=== Colorado attorney general ===
In 1994, Salazar returned to private practice. In 1998, he was elected state attorney general; he was reelected to this position in 2002. Police operations were streamlined under Salazar, and several new branches of law enforcement were created: the Gang Prosecution Unit, the Environmental Crimes Unit, and the General Fugitive Prosecutive Unit, which targeted murderers. He also worked to strengthen consumer protection and anti-fraud laws, as well as to protect children through new policy designed to crack down on sex offenders.

As Colorado Attorney General, he also led numerous investigations, including into the 1999 Columbine High School massacre. Salazar was awarded the Conference of Western Attorneys General Profile in Courage award for his work.

During Salazar&#x27;s tenure, his office pursued several environmental cleanup cases around the state. In a water contamination case involving the Summitville mine in Rio Grande County, Colorado, Salazar helped broker a joint settlement in which the federal and state government shared the $5 million settlement proceeds.

=== U.S. Senate ===
In 2004, Salazar declared his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring Republican Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell. Salazar considers himself a moderate and has at times taken positions that are in disagreement with the base of his party. He opposed gay adoption for a number of years, although by 2004 he had reversed his position. Salazar fell behind to candidate Mike Miles early in the state&#x27;s caucus process. The national Democratic Party backed Salazar with contributions from the DSCC, and Salazar came back to defeat Miles in the Democratic primary, going on to defeat beer executive Pete Coors of the Coors Brewing Company and win the general election for the Senate seat. He assumed office on January 3, 2005.

Salazar was a leading member of a bipartisan group of senators that developed the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which would have provided a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and increased funding for border security, though the bill ultimately failed in the Senate. During negotiations, Salazar was quoted by &quot;The New York Times&quot; saying he wanted the new point system to be equitable: &quot;We do not want to create a system that is just for the wealthiest and most educated immigrants.&quot;

On May 23, 2005, Salazar was among the Gang of 14 moderate senators to forge a compromise on the Democrats&#x27; use of the filibuster against judicial appointments, thus blocking the Republican leadership&#x27;s attempt to implement the so-called &quot;nuclear option&quot;. Under the agreement, the Democrats would retain the power to filibuster a Bush judicial nominee only in an &quot;extraordinary circumstance&quot;, and the three most conservative Bush appellate court nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen and William Pryor) would receive a vote by the full Senate. Salazar has skirmished with Focus on the Family, a Colorado-based conservative Christian group of national stature, over his stance on judicial nominees.

In 2005, Salazar voted against increasing fuel-efficiency standards (CAFE) for cars and trucks, a vote that the League of Conservation Voters believes is anti-environment. In the same year, Salazar voted against an amendment to repeal tax breaks for ExxonMobil and other major petroleum companies.

In August 2006, Ken Salazar supported fellow Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman in his primary race against Ned Lamont in Connecticut. Lamont, running primarily as an anti-war candidate, won the primary. Salazar&#x27;s continued support of Lieberman, who successfully ran as an independent against Lamont, has rankled the anti-war wing of the Democratic Party.

In 2006, Salazar voted to end protections that limit offshore oil drilling in Florida&#x27;s Gulf Coast.

Salazar introduced legislation, co-sponsored by Colorado Reps. John Salazar and Mark Udall to limit natural gas drilling on the environmentally-rich Roan Plateau in western Colorado. The bill increased the amount of acreage on the Plateau designated too environmentally sensitive to drill for gas.

Salazar worked in the Senate to give benefits to Rocky Flats workers who became ill after working at the former nuclear weapons plant in Colorado. The legislation would grant workers immediate access to medical coverage and compensation without the need to file individual health claims.

In 2007, Salazar was one of only a handful of Democrats to vote against a bill that would require the United States Army Corps of Engineers to consider global warming when planning water projects.

Salazar received a 25 percent vote rating for 2007 by the Humane Society of the United States, a zero percent vote rating for 2005–2006 by Fund for Animals, a 60 percent vote rating for 2007 by Defenders of Wildlife, and a zero percent vote rating on the Animal Welfare Institute Compassion Index. He also supported the Bush administration&#x27;s release of lands in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) for emergency haying in Colorado&#x27;s Yuma and Phillips Counties. Salazar has an 81 percent lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters, including a 100 percent rating for the year 2008.

Salazar resigned his Senate seat on January 20, 2009, upon his confirmation by the Senate to become Secretary of the Interior under President Barack Obama.

=== Secretary of the Interior ===
Salazar accepted Obama&#x27;s offer to join his cabinet as the Secretary of the Interior. His appointment triggered a Saxbe fix by Congress. On January 7, 2009, Congress approved a bill, , and President George W. Bush signed it into law, providing such a fix by reducing the Secretary of Interior&#x27;s salary to the level it was prior to the time Salazar took office in January 2009.

The Senate confirmed Salazar&#x27;s nomination by voice vote on January 20, 2009, shortly after Obama was sworn in as president. As Secretary of the Interior, Salazar was in charge of the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the United States Geological Survey, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and other federal agencies overseen by the Interior Department.

Salazar was one of two Hispanics serving in Obama&#x27;s Cabinet, along with Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis of California. Salazar is the second Hispanic Interior Secretary after Manuel Lujan, Jr., who held the post from 1989 to 1993 under President George H. W. Bush.

As secretary of the department, Salazar began a large-scale effort within the department to ensure that the country&#x27;s national parks and national monuments were inclusive of America&#x27;s tribal and minority communities. Salazar worked to create new monuments to honor Cesar Chavez, the Buffalo Soldiers, Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad, Fort Monroe and sacred Native American sites like Chimney Rock in Colorado.

Several prominent environmentalist groups were wary of Salazar, noting his strong ties with the coal and mining industries. Kieran Suckling, executive director of Center for Biological Diversity, which tracks endangered species and habitat issues stated, &quot;He [Ken Salazar] is a right-of-center Democrat who often favors industry and big agriculture in battles over global warming, fuel efficiency and endangered species.&quot;

The nomination was praised, however, by Gene Karpinski, President of the League of Conservation Voters. Upon the nomination, Karpinski said, &quot;Throughout his career, Senator Salazar has campaigned on a pledge of support for &#x27;our land, our water, our people.&#x27; With a perfect 100% score on the 2008 LCV Scorecard, he has lived up to that pledge. As a westerner, Senator Salazar has hands on experience with land and water issues, and will restore the Department of the Interior&#x27;s role as the steward of America&#x27;s public resources. We look forward to working with him to protect the health of America&#x27;s land, water, and people in the coming years.&quot;

Although Senate Republicans were expected to raise questions concerning Salazar&#x27;s stances on oil shale development and drilling in environmentally sensitive areas, Salazar was one of several Obama Cabinet appointees confirmed in the Senate by voice vote on January 20, 2009, shortly after Obama&#x27;s inauguration. Salazar became the 50th Secretary of the Interior succeeding Dirk Kempthorne, who praised Salazar&#x27;s appointment.

Colorado Governor Bill Ritter appointed Denver Superintendent of Schools Michael Bennet to finish Salazar&#x27;s term in the Senate, which expired in January 2011.
On January 23, 2009, Salazar stated that he was considering reopening the Statue of Liberty&#x27;s crown to tourists. The crown has been closed to the public since the September 11, 2001 attacks. &quot;I hope we can find a way&quot;, Salazar said in a statement. &quot;It would proclaim to the world—both figuratively and literally—that the path to the light of liberty is open to all.&quot;

On March 6, 2009, Salazar agreed to move forward with the Fish and Wildlife Service&#x27;s decision to remove the Rocky Mountain gray wolf from the Endangered Species List in Montana and Idaho, but not Wyoming. Minimum recovery goal for wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains is at least 30 breeding pairs and at least 300 wolves for at least three consecutive years, a goal that was attained in 2002 and has been exceeded every year since. (There are currently about 95 breeding pairs and 1,600 wolves in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming.) Salazar, a former rancher has come under criticism of groups like the Defenders of Wildlife for this decision, and lack of protection of wolves.

On May 9, 2009, Salazar announced the upholding of a Bush-era policy that prevents the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions via the Endangered Species Act (ESA), a policy he pledged to reevaluate when he took office in January. The policy states that, despite the apparent negative impact global warming has on polar bears, an endangered species, greenhouse gasses cannot be regulated with the ESA. Salazar stated in a conference call announcing the decision that &quot;The single greatest threat to the polar bear is the melting of Arctic Sea ice due to climate change,&quot; but the Endangered Species Act &quot;is not the appropriate tool for us to deal with what is a global issue.&quot; The decision was met with criticism from environmental groups and praise from energy groups including the American Petroleum Institute, some Democrats and many Republicans. Salazar contended in the same conference call that the ESA was never intended to be used for the regulation of climate change, while sidestepping questions of how this situation is different from that of the Clean Air Act, which is being used by the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate emissions.

In May 2009, Colorado Governor Bill Ritter, and the state&#x27;s both senators, Michael Bennet and Mark Udall, wrote a letter to President Obama, recommending Salazar be appointed to the Supreme Court following the resignation of David Souter. Salazar stated on the &quot;Today&quot; that he was not interested and enjoyed his current job. United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Judge Sonia Sotomayor was eventually nominated and confirmed.

With Ritter&#x27;s announcement on January 6, 2010, that he would not seek re-election as governor, speculation began to swirl about a possible Salazar candidacy that year. Congressman John Salazar, Salazar&#x27;s brother, told local media that he thought his brother would likely run for governor. Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper indicated that while he was considering a run himself, he would &quot;do everything [he could] to help him get elected.&quot; Both the Secretary&#x27;s brother, John, and the Obama administration urged him to run for governor, but he ultimately declined and endorsed Hickenlooper&#x27;s campaign.

On April 28, 2010, Ken Salazar approved Cape Wind, the first-ever commercial wind operation in public water, leading to initiation of the approval process for the first-of-its-kind Atlantic wind energy transmission line.

During his time as secretary, Salazar successfully developed and implemented numerous renewable energy initiatives on public lands and helped lead the Obama administration&#x27;s &quot;all of the above&quot; energy strategy.

Secretary Salazar prioritized the rapid, responsible development of renewable energy on America&#x27;s public lands, greenlighting the development of over 11,000 megawatts of renewable energy on public lands, including approval of the first-ever solar energy projects on public lands, and creation of the first-ever roadmap for future solar energy development in the West.

During Salazar&#x27;s tenure, the department also undertook new surveys to evaluate and identify innovative capacity and efficiency increases to help enhance hydropower generation at facilities of the Bureau of Reclamation, the nation&#x27;s second-largest hydropower producer.

He has dealt with criticism after pushing to impose tougher leasing rules and cancel a series of planned drilling operations in Alaska and elsewhere. Salazar has dealt with criticism over his handling of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, both because of the way his agency handled the permitting process for underwater drilling, and also because of the way the aftermath of the spill has been handled by the government.

But Salazar also ushered in the most comprehensive offshore oil and gas safety initiatives and reforms ever in the United States, overhauling the government&#x27;s antiquated and conflicted offshore oil and gas management program while approving millions of acres for oil and gas development offshore. Salazar also implemented a new five-year plan for responsible oil and gas exploration and development in America&#x27;s offshore waters.

In May 2010 Salazar testified to Congress that he had issued a &quot;hit the pause button&quot; order and that no new permits had been issued since the Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. However, a new deepwater well had been started in the Gulf since April 20, and the Department of the Interior under Salazar had &quot;issued permits for at least seventeen other new offshore oil projects.&quot;

As Secretary of the Interior, Salazar was the designated survivor for the 2011 State of the Union Address.

Salazar created new partnerships between the Department of the Interior and American mayors and governors to create and revitalize a new generation of urban parks in cities such as New York City, Denver, Chicago and St. Louis. As secretary, the department also created seven new national parks, including Pinnacles National Park in California, and 10 new national monuments.

In May 2012, Salazar spoke at the commencement ceremony for the 2012 class at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.

In November 2012, asked a question he did not like by a reporter for &quot;The Gazette&quot; regarding Salazar&#x27;s association with hauler who shipped wild horses to slaughter plants, Salazar told the reporter, &quot;If you do that to me again, I&#x27;ll punch you out&quot;. Salazar later apologized.

In January 2013 Salazar announced that he would be resigning as Secretary of the Interior. His replacement, Sally Jewell, was nominated on February 6, 2013, approved by the Senate on April 10, 2013, and sworn in on April 12, 2013.

===Clinton transition team===
On August 16, 2016, Hillary for America chairman John Podesta announced that Secretary Clinton had chosen Salazar to head her transition team in order to prepare for an orderly transition should she be elected as the 45th President of the United States.

On November 8, 2016, Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the election for President of the United States, and thus Salazar was not granted the opportunity to head the White House transition team.

===Ambassador to Mexico===

On June 15, 2021, President Joe Biden nominated Salazar to be the next U.S. ambassador to Mexico. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held hearings for his nomination on July 28, 2021. Salazar&#x27;s nomination was then reported favorably by the committee on August 4, 2021. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 11, 2021, by voice vote. He was ceremoniously sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris on September 2, 2021. On September 14, 2021, Salazar presented his credentials to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. In July 2022, &quot;the New York Times&quot; published an article quoting &quot;growing concern within the Biden administration that the ambassador may have actually compromised U.S. interests&quot; and had become too close to sitting Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

In 978, Anglo-Saxon Calne was the site of a large two-storey building with a hall on the first floor. It was here that St Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury met the Witenagemot to justify his controversial organisation of the national church, which involved the secular priests being replaced by Benedictine monks and the influence of landowners over churches on their lands being taken away. According to an account written about 1000, at one point in this meeting Dunstan called upon God to support his cause, at which point the floor collapsed killing most of his opponents, whilst Dunstan and his supporters were in the part that remained standing. This was claimed as a miracle by Dunstan&#x27;s supporters.
===Early market town===
In 1086 Calne may already have been, as it was later, a market town on the main Bristol-London road, with 114 households and a church. 74 or more households were held almost outright by &quot;burghal tenure&quot; (as citizens of a borough), and the lordship of its large outlying land was divided between the king (of whom 45 burgesses were tenants) and the church.

In the Middle Ages the king&#x27;s successor as the lord of Calne manor and, as owner of the church&#x27;s revenues, the treasurer of Salisbury Cathedral, each had the right to hold a market and a fair in the town, with two triangular market places or fair grounds. A modest hospital was provided on a modest endowment from 1248 until it provided no accommodation in 1546 and was sold two years later by the Crown.

Reflecting the large area of the king&#x27;s estate, until the late 19th century Calne had tithings at Eastmead Street, Quemerford, Whetham, Whitley, and part of Beversbrook, all now within Calne parish; and furthermore Blackland, Calstone, Stock, Stockley and Studley, all now in Calne Without parish.

===Industry===
Calne had a significant woollen broadcloth industry in the 18th century, and evidence of this can be seen set around the triangular green by the parish church, where 24 listed buildings remain, five at Grade II* including the Tounson almshouses for the neediest poor and Georgian era clothiers&#x27; houses. Nearby are some of the 14 original mills along the Marden. St Mary&#x27;s church was extended by the generous donations of rich clothiers and wool merchants in the 15th century.

Houses of the 17th and 18th centuries have external walls of stone and timber-framed walls inside. Most of the stone is limestone rubble, laid with ashlar dressings in houses of higher quality; the walls of many houses were rendered smooth. Until the 19th century, quarries beside the London road northwest and southeast of the town were sources of stone for building.

A relic of 19th century lime extraction, a kiln, exists in the grounds of St Mary&#x27;s School. This solid marine deposition is chiefly one chemical, calcium carbonate, and is dug in nearby pits for its main use in cement and as fertiliser on acid ground.

===Former canal===

The Wilts &amp; Berks Canal linked the Kennet and Avon Canal at Semington, near Melksham, to the River Thames at Abingdon. Much of the traffic on the canal was coal from the Somerset Coalfield. As the canal passed through open country near Stanley, east of Chippenham, a short branch led through three locks to a wharf in Calne. The canal was completed in 1810 and abandoned in 1914.

===Former railway===
Calne railway station opened in 1863, the terminus of its own branch line of the Great Western Railway running east from Chippenham, with one intermediate stop: Stanley Bridge Halt. The opening of Black Dog Halt in the early 20th century provided insufficient demand to slow a progressive decline. The branch closed as a result of the Beeching Axe in September 1965, having made the biggest loss per mile of any line in the country.

===Wiltshire pork and ham===
Subsequently, Calne&#x27;s main industry other than being a small market town was the imposing C&amp;T Harris pork processing factory. It is said that the pork-curing industry developed because pigs reared in Ireland were landed at Bristol and then herded across England on drovers&#x27; roads to Smithfield, London. One resting place for the pigs was at Black Dog Hill, just west of the town, and the Harris family of butchers took the pigs that were not expected to survive the onward journey.

==== C&amp;T Harris ====
The Harris business began in the second half of the 18th century, when widow Sarah Harris and her son John relocated from Devizes and began trading as pork butchers in Church Street (Butchers Row). Brothers John and Henry Harris, sons of John Harris, continued separately in business, at High Street and the original Church Street shop respectively. Their products included bacon and hams preserved using the Wiltshire cure method, which the family had developed.

John Harris and his wife Mary Perkins had eleven children, and three of them, Thomas, George, and Charles, expanded the family business. The businesses of Charles and Thomas merged in 1888 as C. &amp; T. Harris &amp; Co. C&amp;T Harris documented their work in a company magazine between 1927 and 1939, each issue containing an article by their managing director, Sir John Bodinnar. 

C&amp;T Harris built a five-storey factory in the centre of the town in the 1930s, which at its height employed 2,000 people to process 5,000 pigs each week into bacon, pies, sausages and cooked meats. The business declined in the 1970s, due in part to competition from Danish bacon. The company (by now Farmers Meat Company Ltd) closed in 1982, and the factory was demolished over the next two years. Its site was later redeveloped as housing and the town&#x27;s public library. The departed industry is celebrated by a bronze sculpture of two pigs, installed in 1979 by Calne Civic Society on Phelps Parade in the town centre. 
==Economy==
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Calne saw rapid expansion compared to most other towns in the South West region, with a population which the district council projected to peak at around 19,000 by 2015 but which has since been surpassed. The Lansdowne Park housing development (completed in early 2007) has substantially increased the size of the town, creating a new northwestern suburb, including a new primary school, a medical centre and a small shopping area. This area has attracted professional workers from traditionally more expensive areas such as Bath, Bristol, Marlborough and as far afield as the &#x27;silicon valley&#x27; towns of central Berkshire. The development&#x27;s name reflects its proximity to the seat of the Marquess of Lansdowne, whose family have owned the nearby Bowood House country estate since 1784.

The Porte Marsh Industrial Estate on the north side of the town provides the bulk of the town&#x27;s internal employment, and is home to around 100 companies in predominantly light industries and information technology. The Belgian company Deceuninck has invested considerably in this area and operates two large facilities for production and distribution. Another significant employer is the Exception Group, an electronics manufacturer which, as of 2013, was the town&#x27;s largest employer with some 220 employees. In 2006, plans to build a cement production plant on the Porte Marsh site were vigorously opposed by local residents and planning permission was refused by the council.

Aside from the completion of Lansdowne Park, smaller pockets of new housing were built. In May 2009, the 94-acre Beversbrook Sports Facility was opened. This facility is managed by Calne Town Council was built with £1.2 million funding from Hills Property, provided as part of the planning agreement for their King Edward Close development. The facility boasts fourteen age appropriate football pitches, one-ten wicket cricket square, an artificial cricket wicket, archery range, floodlit tennis courts and indoor facilities, including a badminton court.

===Retail===
Calne has Sainsbury&#x27;s, Tesco and Iceland supermarkets, and an intermediate-sized Tesco store on the northern edge of the town and an intermediate- sized Asda Express on the southern edge. As part of the &quot;New Heart of Calne&quot; initiative, a section of the Phelps Parade was redeveloped in 2009, using part Cotswold stone and part red brick, a new glass roof section and roof lining.

==Arts and tourism==

The annual Calne Music &amp; Arts Festival was established in 1975 and is run by a registered charity. It has only missed one festival year, in 2020.

In 2014, the town entered the South West in Bloom area of the Britain in Bloom competition and won a Gold Award for the first time. The award is judged on both the town council&#x27;s floral displays and those of the community projects whose groups have entered in the &#x27;It&#x27;s Your Neighbourhood&#x27; category of the awards.

Calne is home to approximately twenty pieces of public art, ranging from bronze and ceramics to murals and mixed-media structures. These pieces have been documented, mapped and made available as a Public Art Trail for residents and tourists alike.

==Landmarks==

Notable buildings in the town include St Mary&#x27;s Church, Calne&#x27;s only Grade I listed structure, an array of houses on The Green and Calne Town Hall. 

An inn in the centre of the town – now the Lansdowne Strand Hotel – is a Grade II* listed building, dating in part from the 17th century and re-fronted in the 18th.

Of particular note is Calne Library which has won awards for its innovative design and was opened by the Queen in 2001.

Since the demolition of the Harris pork factory and the completion of the first phase of redevelopment/regeneration in 2001, Calne has seen Cotswold stone, similar to local limestone, being used together with smart red brickwork, formerly reserved for fine historical buildings.

==Transport and infrastructure==
The town centre suffers traffic congestion, with the A4 through the town close to gridlock during rush hour, due to single-file traffic between Curzon Street and Wood Street, with eastbound traffic having priority. A northern bypass road (a re-routing of the A3102) was completed in 2000.

Calne is equidistant () from the M4 motorway at Junction 16 (Wootton Bassett/Swindon West) to the northeast of Calne, and the westbound M4 junction 17 just north of Chippenham to the northwest. The nearest main passenger airport is Bristol, to the southwest. The nearest railway stations are Chippenham, Melksham and Pewsey. Bus operators Stagecoach West, Faresaver and Swindon&#x27;s Buses provide services to towns and cities such as Chippenham, Devizes, Marlborough, Swindon and Bath.

==Education==
Bentley&#x27;s School opened in the town in 1664 using an endowment left by John Bentley in 1662. In 1901 this was amalgamated with Calne Technical School as a school of science for boys aged 9–17, which became known as Calne County School and later Calne County Secondary School. Girls were admitted from 1903 and in 1908–09 new buildings were added to the nucleus of buildings dating from 1842. The school was later called the Bentley Grammar School. In 1957 it moved to a new building in the angle of the London and Melksham roads. In 1974, Wiltshire County Council closed the grammar school and the Fynemore Secondary Modern School in Silver Street and created a new school, the John Bentley Comprehensive School, on both sites. This was later called the John Bentley School, and in 2019 was renamed as the Kingsbury Green Academy. Until 1998 both sites were used. After the buildings in Silver Street were given up, new buildings were erected on the site of Bentley Grammar, and existing ones improved.

St Mary&#x27;s School, Curzon Street, is an independent school for girls established in 1873.

Calne had other small schools, some based in houses, such as one in Curzon Street in which girls were trained for domestic service. Another example was a small boarding school for boys open in 1842 on the site of a former factory in Silver Street, called William Jacob&#x27;s School. This was attended by Reg Birkett, the international sportsman, who played football and rugby for England in the 1870s, and by Charlie Absolom who played cricket for the England cricket team in a Test match in 1879.

The nearest university is the University of Bath campus at Claverton Down in Bath, to the west. Bath Spa University lies away, between Bath and Bristol.

The closest further education institution is the Wiltshire College &amp; University Centre site in Chippenham, away.

The town has five primary schools and one independent preparatory school.
* Fynamore Primary School – School Road
* Holy Trinity CofE School – Quemerford
* Marden Vale CofE (VC) Academy – William Street (formerly St Dunstan&#x27;s)
* Priestley Primary School – Prince Charles Drive
* Saint Edmund&#x27;s RC Primary School – Duncan Street
* St Margaret&#x27;s Preparatory School – a mixed day preparatory school that shares the Curzon Street site with St Mary&#x27;s

== Religious sites ==
=== Anglican ===
St Mary&#x27;s church has a central position in the town and dates from the 12th century. The building was greatly expanded in the 14th and 15th centuries, and its tower rebuilt in the 17th. It is a Grade I listed building.

Holy Trinity church at Quemerford, on the London Road southwest of the town, was built in 1852–3. Its churchyard became the parish graveyard, as St Mary&#x27;s was full.

=== Catholic ===
St Edmund&#x27;s Catholic Church, Oxford Road, was built in 1962. The font has tiles from Stanley Abbey (which was visited by Saint Edmund Rich) and the church received stained glass from the demolished St Joseph&#x27;s Church at RAF Lyneham.

=== Nonconformist ===
Calne has a long history of Nonconformism.

A Presbyterian chapel was built in Back Road c. 1695. The congregation became Unitarian after 1770, being influenced by Joseph Priestley who lived in the town from 1773 to 1780 and preached at the chapel. The chapel had been closed by the late 1830s and was re-used by the Primitive Methodists and later by the Salvation Army. It was demolished in the 1960s.

The Baptist church in Castle Street was built in the late 17th century, rebuilt in 1704 and again in 1817. The church continues in use. Particular Baptists built Zion chapel in 1836 on the street now called The Pippin; this too remains open, and is a feature of Calne&#x27;s pedestrian precinct.

Wesleyan Methodists built a chapel in Back Road in 1811, and opened a larger church at Silver Street in 1867, which continues in use. Primitive Methodists used the former Unitarian chapel from the late 1830s, and moved to the former Wesleyan chapel in Back Road in 1887. In 1965 both congregations came together in the Silver Street building and the chapel in Back Road was later demolished.

The Free Church in Church Street was built in 1868 by a group who broke away from the parish church. The congregation is affiliated to the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches.

There is an Evangelical church in Oxford Road. First built in the early 1930s, and rebuilt at a later date, this was an Open Brethren Gospel Hall until at least the late 1990s.

There is a non-conformist cemetery alongside the Curzon Street section of the A4 leading towards Chippenham. The cemetery was opened in 1867 and is available to people of any faith.

==Demography==
At the 2021 Census, Calne parish had a population of 19,074. There were 19,732 in the built-up area, which extends further south to include those parts of Quemerford lying in Calne Without parish, as well as Stockley hamlet.

Earlier statistics for Calne parish are shown below. Figures from 1911 to 1961 are for the successor Metropolitan Borough which covered a slightly smaller area. In 2011 the population reached 17,274 living in 7,113 homes.

==Media==
In local radio, BBC Radio Wiltshire and Heart West are supplemented by two Internet-only stations: Eartunes Radio (Calne&#x27;s long-established community station), and White Horse Radio (music, advertiser-supported).

Local television news coverage is through BBC Points West and ITV News West Country, both Bristol-based.

==Governance==
Following boundary changes which came into effect at the 2024 general election, the four electoral divisions covering Calne civil parish are split between two Westminster constituencies. Calne North, Calne Chilvester &amp; Abberd, and Calne Central are within the Chippenham constituency, while Calne South (covering a southern part of the town, as well as Quemerford and a large rural area to the south) is part of Melksham and Devizes. The former is represented by Sarah Gibson and the latter by Brian Mathew, both Liberal Democrats.

At a parish level, Calne is run by Calne Town Council which has responsibility for allotments, play areas, open spaces, town events, cemeteries, tourist information and more. It elects 19 town councillors, from four wards.

Calne is within the area of Wiltshire Council, a unitary authority. It elects five of the authority&#x27;s ninety-eight councillors. As of the 2021 Wiltshire Council election, Calne&#x27;s councillors are:

==Notable inhabitants==
The first inhabitant of note was Edmund Rich (1175–1240), who became Archbishop of Canterbury. He was canonised and many educational establishments are named after him, notably St Edmund Hall, Oxford and St Edmund&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

John Pym (1584–1643) lived in Calne. He was a leader of the Long Parliament and a prominent critic of Kings James I and then Charles I. He was one of the Five Members whose attempted arrest in 1642 sparked the Civil War.

Isaac Nichols, a transported convict who became the first postmaster of Sydney, New South Wales was born here in 1770.

The country estate of Bowood House, which dates from 1725, lies approximately southwest of the town. It is the family seat of the Marquess of Lansdowne; the current Marquess is Charles Petty-Fitzmaurice. It was at Bowood that Joseph Priestley discovered oxygen in 1774; there is a plaque in the town centre commemorating this. Jan Ingenhousz repeated Joseph Priestley&#x27;s experiments and found it was sunlight which acted upon the plants to create oxygen (photosynthesis). There is a pavement display outside the Millennium Library in Calne in his honour.

Samuel Taylor Coleridge stayed from 1814 to 1816 as part of the Morgan household whilst writing his &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot;. A plaque on the house commemorates this visit.

Walter Goodall George (1858–1943) was an athlete who set numerous world records as an amateur and then as a professional. In one of his races, he set a mile record which was not surpassed for almost 30 years. George held more than 13 world records for running at the time and still holds a world record simply for holding the mile record longer than anyone else. There are two plaques in Calne to commemorate his life, one in front of the town hall and one at ground level just inside the recreation grounds.

Frederic Hicks Beaven (11 April 1855 – 22 January 1941) was Bishop of Mashonaland from 1911 – 1915 when his title was changed to Bishop of Southern Rhodesia, until his retirement in 1925.

Sarah Grand (1854–1943), a feminist activist and writer, settled in Calne in 1942 after her house in London was damaged by a German bomb. She died a year later on 12 May 1943, at age 88. She coined the phrase &#x27;The New Woman&#x27; and advocated new rights for women, notably in marriage.

The composer Sir Michael Tippett lived in an isolated house on Derry Hill above Calne.

The singer-songwriter-author Julian Cope resided in nearby Yatesbury until 2006, and lived in Calne itself for some years before he moved with his family to the village.

The actor David Hemmings lived in the Old Mill in Calne for many years until his death in December 2003.

Clive Farahar, the books and manuscripts expert on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, and his wife Sophie Dupré who is also a manuscript specialist, were residents in 1994.

==Sports clubs==
===Calne Town F.C.===
Founded in 1886, Calne Town F.C. play in the Western Football League First Division at the tenth highest tier of the English league system. Their Bremhill View ground is located on the north side of the town close to the A3102 bypass.

===Calne R.F.C.===
According to their website, the rugby club was formed in the late 1920s, in part due to the influx of Welsh to the area during the depression. The &quot;Junior Imperial League&quot;, forerunners of the &quot;Young Conservatives&quot; formed the club under the presidency of either Mr Drewett or Mr L. Taylor.

The team&#x27;s first match was probably in &quot;Drewett&quot; ’s field where now stands &quot;Braemor Road&quot;. Their inaugural game against a &quot;Bath XV&quot; team was played on the Recreation Ground to which Calne returned in the late 1970s as a permanent home, which despite ground disputes and uncertainty – remains their home to date. It appears that a lack of local interest forced the club to fold in the late 1930s. In 1960 the club was re-formed as &quot;Old Bentlians&quot;; though it was not exclusively an &quot;old boys&quot; club it did use the pitches at &quot;Bentley Grammar School&quot;.

The club currently fields a 1st and 2nd XV, alternating home games on Saturdays, and also a junior team who play on Sundays.

===Calne SMaRTT===
Calne SMaRTT Running and Triathlon Team was formed in 2007. They organise an annual 10 km multi-terrain running race called the &quot;SMaRTT Smasher&quot;, on an out-and-back route along the cycle path towards Chippenham.

===Calne Running Club===
Formed in 1992 by Mike Tawn and Dave Balkwill, Calne Running Club has members of all abilities. They also organise the Compton Bassett 5-miler and Heddington 5k races yearly.

===Basketball===
As of 2011, due to the work of local sports enthusiast Shaun Preen, Calne is represented in the West of England Basketball Association (WEBBA), although home games are played at the Olympiad Leisure Centre, Chippenham, home of the &#x27;Olympiad Flames&#x27; with which Calne basketball is officially affiliated. The club provides the local community the opportunity to participate in competitive basketball.

==Suburbs==
Calne&#x27;s suburbs and housing developments include Quemerford, Calne Marsh, Lansdowne Park, Curzon Park, Castlefields, Lickhill, Sand Pit Estate, Sands Farm Estate and Regent Park Estate.

<doc id="893028" wikidata="Q4698365" url="?curid=893028" title="Air rage">
<text>Air rage is aggressive or violent behavior on the part of passengers and crew of aircraft, especially during flight. Air rage generally covers both behavior of a passenger or crew member that is likely caused by physiological or psychological stresses associated with air travel, and when a passenger or crew member becomes unruly, angry, or violent on an aircraft during a flight. Excessive consumption of alcohol is often a cause.

Landing to disembark the troublemaker cannot usually be done quickly and causes great delays to passengers. However, unlike large ships, there is insufficient room on board to hold the offender in an isolated area until arrival. Therefore, diversions or unscheduled stops do occur because of air rage.

Examples of air rage behavior include failure to follow safety regulations or behaving in a way that gives suspicion of a threat to flight safety.

An airline passenger&#x27;s uncontrolled anger is usually expressed in aggressive or violent behavior in the passenger compartment, but air rage can have serious implications, especially if the offender decides to interfere with the aircraft&#x27;s navigation or flight controls. Generally, such passengers do not intend to commit terrorist acts, but since the September 11 attacks, such incidents have been taken more seriously due to increased awareness of terrorism.

The first case of air rage was recorded in 1947 on a flight from Havana to Miami, when a drunk man assaulted another passenger and a flight attendant. Another early documented case involved a flight in Alaska in 1950.

At the time, applicable jurisdiction was unclear, so offenders often escaped punishment. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1963 Tokyo Convention that laws of the country where the aircraft is registered were agreed to take precedence.

Air rage events have increased since International Air Transport Association (IATA) started collecting data on disruptive passenger behavior in 2007. No definite explanation for that trend has been established; possible explanations include heightened anxiety for one&#x27;s safety and irritation with invasive security. In 2019, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) reported a 33% rise in air rage incidents on European flights between 2017 and 2018. EASA stated that every three hours, a passenger compromised the safety of a flight within the EU through misconduct, with at least 70% of these incidents involving aggression. Moreover, escalating air rage situations that necessitated an emergency landing happened once a month on average. A flight attendant representing the (Dutch Aircrew Association) outlined several possible reasons for the rise: more seats per airplane, more and longer flights lead to more annoyance amongst passengers, and thus more aggression incidents.

After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, an uptick in air rage was noted by media outlets and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. Most incidents involved the mandated use of face masks, scarves, or covering under federal law, resulting in attacks on other passengers or airline personnel. Dutch airlines KLM and Transavia noticed the same increase in air rage, and in September 2022, they established a joint blacklist for banned passengers.

== Causes ==
Stressful situations, such as jet lag, flight delays, or other difficult or annoying passengers or crew members in one&#x27;s vicinity, can lead passengers and crew members to an increased likelihood of becoming agitated and air rage. Passengers who are afraid of flying can easily panic.

Some research suggests that visible inequality between seat classes on flights (first class, business class, economy class) may be responsible for an increase in air rage incidents.

It is also suggested by some experts that the primary cause of air rage is the deterioration of economy class amenities and seating space over recent decades.

Air rage can be the result of a combination of factors. For example, a person who is already afraid of flying can be tipped over the edge by an overuse of alcohol, medication, a stressful situation, nicotine withdrawal, or disruptive behavior from others.

The availability of alcoholic beverages on airlines and at airports enables passengers and crew members to drink excessively before and during flights. Flight attendants have the ability to keep track of how many drinks are served to passengers while on board an aircraft, and are required by many countries to refuse further drinks to passengers who appear intoxicated, but have no way of knowing how many are consumed prior to boarding. An analysis of online media reports relating to air rage incidents occurring between 2000 and 2020 found that the United States and the United Kingdom were the most frequent countries of origin for the 228 cases found, with 127 cases involving alcohol consumption. According to one study by the School of Hotel and Tourism Management at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPU), half of all air rage incidents on Western airlines involve alcohol.

Markus Schuckert, a co-author of the study, told &quot;SCMP&quot; that on Asian airlines, where air rage incidents are rarer, the air rage incidents that do occur arise from inexperience and lack of knowledge about the restrictions involved. In China, where Schuckert described some incidents of air rage as &quot;legendary&quot; due to pictures or video posted on social media, some passengers have been known to do things like open cabin doors while the plane was taxiing to let hot air out, or throw coins in the engines for good luck.

Sometimes, passengers are disruptive by failing to obey laws and rules that must be observed or arguing with flight attendants.

It is also possible in some cases, due to the fact that crew members have sole discretion to determine whether a passenger is being disruptive, that some incidents may be caused or exacerbated by intolerant or confrontational behavior on the part of crew members. For example, in 2020, the cabin crew of an American Airlines flight called the police on a &quot;disruptive&quot; passenger who complained that some airline employees had not been wearing COVID masks.

On 10 August 2022, just before take-off of a Transavia flight from Rotterdam The Hague Airport, an 18-year-old male passenger shared a photo of an airplane crash using the AirDrop mobile phone app, where it was seen by many crew members and passengers including children. Many passengers and personnel were upset, and the crew repeatedly ordered the passenger to identify themselves, with the captain saying the plane would not depart until they had done so. Although the 18-year-old (whom the Royal Marechaussee removed from the flight for questioning) said it was a &quot;joke&quot;, the airline regarded it as &quot;a kind of bomb threat&quot;; the next day, it charged the passenger with intimidation and banned him from flying Transavia for 5 years.

==Traits==

Air rage generally covers both behavior of a passenger or airline employee on the aircraft or more generally speaking at the airport:

* Violent, aggressive or disruptive behaviour.
* Threatening flight safety, crew members or passengers.
* Behaving in a way that gives suspicion of a threat to flight safety.
* Failure to follow safety regulations.
* Claiming to have a bomb on the flight or saying they are a terrorist with malignant intent.

Other related behavior that may interfere with the comfort of cabin crew or passengers include smoking on board the flight, viewing pornographic materials, performing sex acts (&quot;mile high club&quot;) in the aircraft cabin, making undue sexual advances towards other people, performing sex acts in the lavatory, the inappropriate groping and touching of crew members, loud or drunken behaviors, spitting, swearing, and wearing clothing that is inappropriate or offensive.

== Handling air rage ==
Extremely unruly passengers or crew members who must be restrained are restrained using a variety of methods. Some airlines carry flexcuffs for this purpose. Others use seatbelts, adhesive tape, neckties, shoe laces, waist belts, or whatever is available on the aircraft. While the United States does not allow passengers to actually be confined to the seat or any other part of the aircraft, and only allows their individual body parts to be restrained, other countries, such as Iceland, do allow tying an unruly passenger to the seat.

In Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority reserves the right to use stun guns to subdue unruly passengers.

Sometimes a flight must be diverted to allow an aircraft to dispose itself of the offender as soon as possible.

Low-cost airlines usually have younger and less-trained, less-experienced personnel, who therefore struggle more to handle air rage incidents.

== Consequences ==
In the United States, passengers who disrupt the duties of a flight crew member can face fines up to $25,000 and sometimes lengthy prison sentences. In addition, the airline can choose to ban the problem passenger from any future flights.

In Canada the Pilot-in-Command (Captain) of the aircraft is designated as a Peace Officer under the Criminal Code and as such, have the same powers of arrest as a Police Officer. The Pilot-in-Command is authorized to enforce all sections of the Criminal Code and all Acts of Parliament while the aircraft is in flight.

With the number of unlawful acts committed on airplanes in South Korea more than tripling from 2011 to 2016, Korean Air Lines issued guidelines allowing crew members to use stun guns on violent passengers and banning those with a history of unruly behavior.

On 29 September 2022, KLM and Transavia established a joint blacklist for banned passengers, meaning that any passenger misbehaving on a flight of either airline is banned from flying with both airlines for the duration of 5 years. The frequency of mid-air incidents involving unruly passengers increased significantly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and put a heavy burden on personnel of both airlines, and they wished to prevent passengers banned by one airline from making trouble on another flight of the other. The exchange of KLM–Transavia banned passenger data, that had so far been hampered by legal obstructions, was said to be the first of its kind in the world. Back in August 2017, the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions (FNV) and other trade unions had already put forward the idea of a shared blacklist for banned passengers amongst all European airlines to prevent passengers prone to air rage from causing trouble from one airline to the next.

<text>Michèle Angélique Flournoy (; born December 14, 1960) is an American defense policy advisor who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy under President Bill Clinton and under secretary of defense for policy under President Barack Obama.

As under secretary of defense for policy, Flournoy was the highest-ranking woman in the history of the Department of Defense. In that position, Flournoy crafted the Obama administration&#x27;s counter-insurgency policy in Afghanistan and helped persuade President Obama to intervene militarily in Libya.

In 2007, Flournoy co-founded the Center for a New American Security. She is a co-founder and the current managing partner of WestExec Advisors.

==Early life and education==
Flournoy was born on December 14, 1960, in Los Angeles, California. Her father, George Flournoy, was a cinematographer who worked on shows including &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. He died of a heart attack when she was 14 years old. Flournoy attended Beverly Hills High School in Beverly Hills, California. She was an exchange student in Belgium, where she learned French, for one year.

Flournoy received a BA in social studies from Harvard University in 1983. She received an M.Litt. in international relations in 1986 from Oxford University, where she was a Newton-Tatum scholar at Balliol College. In 1986, she was a research analyst at the Center for Defense Information. By 1989, Flournoy was working at the Arms Control Association. From 1989 until 1993, she worked at Harvard&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government, where she was a research fellow in its international security program.

==Career==
===Clinton administration (1996–2000)===
Flournoy served in the Clinton administration in the United States Department of Defense, where she was both principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy and threat reduction and deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy.

Flournoy was awarded the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service in 1996, the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service in 1998 and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff&#x27;s Joint Distinguished Civilian Service Award in 2000.

While serving under the Clinton administration as a deputy assistant secretary of defense, Flournoy was the principal author of the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review, which argued that &quot;determined U.S. forces must be capable of fighting and winning two major theater wars nearly simultaneously.&quot;

She was a primary contributor to the 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review.

===Public policy research===
Flournoy then joined the Institute for National Strategic Studies at the National Defense University (NDU) as a research professor, founding and leading NDU&#x27;s Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) working group.

Flournoy then moved to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), where she worked as a senior advisor on a range of defense policy and international security issues. In 2002, a year before the US invasion of Iraq, she argued for preemptive strikes by the US against foreign weapons stockpiles. Flournoy told &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;In some cases, preemptive strikes against an adversary&#x27;s [weapons of mass destruction] capabilities may be the best or only option we have to avert a catastrophic attack against the United States.&quot;

==== Founder of CNAS (2007) ====
In 2007, Flournoy co-founded the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) with Kurt M. Campbell. She was named CNAS&#x27;s president. Flournoy and Campbell wrote a 2007 policy paper called &quot;The Inheritance and the Way Forward&quot; that advocated for a US foreign policy &quot;grounded in a common-sense pragmatism rather than ideology&quot;.

=== Obama&#x27;s first term (2009–2012) ===

After the 2008 presidential election, Flournoy was selected as one of the review team leads for the Obama transition at the Department of Defense. On January 8, 2009, President-elect Obama announced that he was nominating her as under secretary of defense for policy, to serve under Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. When the United States Senate confirmed her nomination on February 9, 2009, she became the highest-ranking woman in the history of the Department of Defense.

In 2009, Flournoy told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that she had spent much of her adult life steeped in the practice of war. &quot;We&#x27;re trying to recognize that warfare may come in a lot of different flavors in the future,&quot; she said.

While serving in the Obama administration, Flournoy crafted the administration&#x27;s policy of counter-insurgency in Afghanistan. She supported the surge of troops in Afghanistan and helped to design the administration&#x27;s policy in that regard. In 2009, as under secretary of defense for policy, she also supported a US &quot;civilian surge&quot; in Afghanistan, coupling increased economic aid with at least 400 new counter-insurgency experts, and doubling the US military presence to 68,000 troops by the end of the year.

From February 2009 to February 2012, Flournoy was a principal advisor to U.S. Secretaries of Defense Robert Gates and Leon Panetta.

On December 12, 2011, Flournoy announced that she would step down in February 2012 to return to private life and contribute to President Barack Obama&#x27;s re-election bid.

==== Libya ====
In 2011, Flournoy, then under secretary of defense for policy, helped persuade President Obama to intervene militarily in Libya, despite opposition from members of Congress and key White House advisors, such as Joe Biden, Vice President; Tom Donilon, National Security Advisor; and Robert Gates, Defense Secretary. Flournoy supported the NATO-led imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya to oust resistant leader Muammar Gaddafi, accused of ordering the killing of demonstrators and promising to &quot;hunt the rebels down and show no mercy.&quot; Flournoy said imposition of a no-fly zone necessitated first destroying Libya&#x27;s air defenses with US and British cruise missiles targeting the Libyan missile defense system, and US B-2 bombers attacking Libyan airfields.

===Rainmaker and think-tanker (Since 2012)===
After leaving the Obama administration, Flournoy joined Boston Consulting Group as a senior advisor to its Washington D.C.–based public sector practice. It was reported that under Flournoy&#x27;s direction the Boston Consulting Group&#x27;s military contracts went &quot;from $1.6 million in 2013 to $32 million in 2016&quot;.

In a 2013 conversation with the Council on Foreign Relations, Flournoy said she had supported US military intervention on humanitarian grounds. Critics who disagreed with Flournoy described the war on Libya as &quot;disastrous&quot; in its destabilization of entire regions in the Middle East and North Africa, facilitating the transfer of arms to extremists across countries. Two years after the ouster of Muammar Gaddafi, Flournoy defended the US military intervention in Libya, telling the Council on Foreign Relations: &quot;I think we were right to do it.&quot;

As well as being, for a time, a member of the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board and a member of the CIA Director’s External Advisory Board, Flournoy was, in 2014, a senior fellow at Harvard&#x27;s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.

At least in 2014 Flournoy sat on the board of the Atlantic Council.

====Hypothetical role in Clinton administration (2016)====
In June 2016 while she was rumoured to be &quot;Hillary Clinton&#x27;s Likely Defense Secretary&quot;, Flournoy advocated regime change in Syria, supporting &quot;limited military coercion&quot; to remove President Bashar al-Assad from office.

====Co-founder WestExec Advisors (2017)====
In 2017, Flournoy, along with Antony Blinken, US Deputy Secretary of State in the Obama administration, co-founded WestExec Advisors, a consulting firm, where she holds the post of managing partner.

====As corporate director====
In 2018, Flournoy joined the board of Booz Allen Hamilton, receiving $440,000, mostly in company stock options during the first two years since her appointment. She has received some criticism for her role as a director at Booz Allen Hamilton, including by authors affiliated with the Project on Government Oversight (POGO).

As of December 1, 2020, Flournoy was an advisor to Pine Island Capital, a private equity firm. In December 2020, Pine Island raised $218 million to pay for investments in military and aerospace and other industries. In its September 2020 S.E.C. filing, Pine Island forecast that the Defense Department &quot;will prioritize rapid technological advancements&quot; in artificial intelligence and other technologies.

Flournoy was in 2018 on the board of directors of Amida Technology Solutions.

====Hypothetical role in Biden administration (2020)====

Flournoy was widely speculated to be a leading contender to serve as secretary of defense under President Joe Biden. She was tarnished by liberal critics for her international consulting and private equity associations whereas her colleague, Antony Blinken was not.

During the 2020 presidential transition of Joe Biden, Flournoy had been viewed as being &quot;at the top of Biden&#x27;s list&quot; to be Secretary of Defense. In December 2020, Gen. Lloyd Austin was reported to have been chosen instead.

In a webinar hosted by the Israel Policy Forum in June 2020, Flournoy expressed concern that Israel&#x27;s proposed unilateral annexation of the West Bank could lead Congress to deny almost $4 billion in annual US aid to Israel. &quot;I would hate to see some in Congress decided they are going to hold hostage our security assistance to Israel as a way of protesting their policies in the West Bank.&quot; Flournoy added that a fraying of the US-Israel relationship would be disastrous for US interests.

During the 2020 US presidential election, Flournoy stated that she opposed lifting economic sanctions against North Korea and Iran, though might support waivers for medical supplies during the global COVID-19 pandemic.

In an August 2020 interview with &quot;Defense News&quot;, Flournoy stated that she favored shifting money from more traditional military expenditures to unmanned systems &quot;that dramatically improve . . . our ability to project power to defend an interest or an ally who&#x27;s under threat&quot;.

In November 2020, when Flournoy was under consideration for Secretary of Defense, she wrote, “the department and Congress may want to consider a new type of funding authority that supports both the development and testing of new digital technologies.&quot; The Project on Government Oversight (POGO) criticized Flournoy for using &quot;opaque&quot; language to skirt government oversight.

In June 2020 Flournoy argued that the US must invest in new military technologies and more long-range missiles, escalate US troop deployment to the South China Sea area, and step up roving war games in Asia to deter Chinese aggression. Without such ramped-up US military activity and absent the technology to ward off a Chinese cyber attack on US navigation systems, Flournoy asserted the US could stumble into a nuclear confrontation with China over Taiwan sovereignty.

In a November 2020 CNAS report, &quot;Sharpening the U.S. Military Edge: Critical Steps for the Next Administration,&quot; Flournoy argued the U.S. military must be more competitive with China &quot;to keep its military-technological edge.&quot; She called for prioritizing artificial intelligence, cyber warfare, unmanned and autonomous weapons systems.

== Political positions ==

Spencer Ackerman has described Flournoy as a centrist. Van Jackson, a former colleague, described her approach as that of a &quot;classic liberal internationalist.&quot;

== Other affiliations ==

She is a member of the Aspen Strategy Group, and the Council on Foreign Relations.

In 2012, Flournoy was elected as a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration.

, Flournoy is a member of the board of directors of Spirit of America.

As of October 2023, she serves on the Special Competitive Studies Project&#x27;s board of advisors.

Flournoy is a member of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee.

==Personal life==
Flournoy&#x27;s husband, W. Scott Gould, is a retired captain who served for 26 years in the United States Navy Reserve. He was a vice president at IBM before becoming United States Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The couple has three children and reside in Bethesda, Maryland.

<doc id="893030" wikidata="Q16203582" url="?curid=893030" title="Thomas Lyon-Bowes, Master of Glamis (born 1821)">
<text>Thomas Lyon-Bowes (born and died 21 October 1821) was the first child of Thomas Lyon-Bowes, Lord Glamis, and his wife Charlotte Lyon-Bowes &quot;née&quot; Grimstead, great-grandparents of Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, who became queen consort in 1936. Although Thomas is recorded in Robert Douglas&#x27; &quot;Peerage of Scotland&quot; as &quot;born and died, October 21, 1821,&quot; rumours began to circulate during the late 19th century that the child had been born deformed, and had therefore been brought up in seclusion hidden away in Glamis Castle in Angus, Scotland, giving rise to the soubriquet of the Monster of Glamis, or the Horror of Glamis.

==Mystery of Glamis==
Rumours of Thomas Lyon-Bowes&#x27; survival, as recounted by James Wentworth Day in his 1967 book &quot;The Queen Mother&#x27;s Family Story&quot;, appear to have started in local villages as the result of an account by the midwife, whose name is unrecorded. The deformed child was alleged to have been in good health when the midwife left, causing suspicion when his death was announced a day or two later. The story was discussed during the latter half of the 19th century, when &quot;Miss M. Gilchrist, writing in 1885, was not only confident that such a monster did actually exist, but even described him – half frog, half man!!&quot;, also claiming he was the rightful earl. Details published about the mystery of Glamis during the reign of Queen Victoria scarcely mention a monster and are instead focused on the possibility of members of a rival clan dying while locked in the secret room. The earliest surviving reference dates from 1908, in which it was claimed that &quot;in the Castle of Glamis is a secret chamber. In this chamber is confined a monster, who is the rightful heir to the title and property, but who is so unpresentable that it is necessary to keep him out of sight and out of possession.&quot;
The child Thomas has no gravestone; as the child had been baptised as a Christian at birth, this has been used to support the conjecture of survival. However, the fact that Thomas Lyon-Bowes, as a child who died in infancy, has no individual gravestone is in keeping with the funeral customs of the time, when – owing to high rates of infant mortality – usually only adults were commemorated in this way. While dedicated funerary monuments for children do exist, they are comparatively rare.

During a visit to Glamis the Queen Mother&#x27;s biographer Michael Thornton was allegedly told by the sixteenth Earl that the entrance to the chamber where Thomas lived had been bricked up after his death. Some accounts also came from singer and composer Virginia Gabriel, who stayed at the castle in 1870.
 According to Raymond Lamont Brown, a folklorist writing an account of tales associated with Glamis, while stories of a concealed chamber are likely to have a factual basis, he asserts the family emphatically deny rumours about a monster.

<text>Road rage is aggressive or angry behavior exhibited by people driving a vehicle. These behaviors include rude and verbal insults, yelling, physical threats or dangerous driving methods targeted at other drivers, pedestrians or cyclists in an effort to intimidate or release frustration. Road rage can lead to altercations, damage to property, assaults, and collisions that result in serious physical injuries or even death. Behaviour has included (but are not limited to) cutting motorists off, inappropriate honking, flashing headlights, using obscene gestures, flipping off another driver, swerving, tailgating, brake checking, and physical confrontation.

According to a study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety that examined police records nationally, there were more than 1,250 incidents of road rage on average reported per year between 19901996 in the United States. Many of these incidents have ended with serious injuries or fatalities. These rates rose each year throughout the six years of the study. A number of studies have found that individuals with road rage are predominantly young (33 years old on average) and 96.6% male.

==Legal status==
In some jurisdictions, there can be a legal difference between &quot;road rage&quot; and &quot;aggressive driving&quot;. In the U.S., only a few states have enacted special aggressive driving laws, where road rage cases are normally prosecuted as assault and battery (with or without a vehicle), or as vehicular homicide.

The legal definition of road rage encompasses a group of behaviors expressed while driving, or stemming from traffic-related incidents. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration defines road rage as when &quot;an intentional assault by a driver or passenger with a motor vehicle or a weapon that occurs on the roadway or is precipitated by an incident on the roadway.&quot; This definition makes the distinction that aggressive driving is a traffic violation and that road rage is a criminal offense.

===Types===
Road rage can include:
* Shouting, excessive use of a horn or obscene gestures and threats.
* Actions such as cutting off another vehicle, driving closely, blocking another vehicle so that it can not use a traffic lane, brake checking, chasing another vehicle or running it off the road, or deliberately slamming into a vehicle.
* Stopping a vehicle on the side or in the middle of the road, exiting the vehicle to threaten, attack, fight, or injure another motorist, passenger, pedestrian, bicyclist, or any other person.

==Effects on drivers==
A stressed driver&#x27;s behavior depends on that driver&#x27;s coping abilities. Generally, drivers who score high on aggression tests use direct confrontation strategies when faced with stress while driving. Many drivers who experience road rage have admitted that they believe they commit more traffic violations. Driving presents many stresses because of high speeds and the actions of other drivers. As stress increases, the likelihood of a person exhibiting road rage increases dramatically. Typically, younger males are most susceptible to road rage. Most reported cases of road rage occur because of cutting in and out of traffic, lane changes, disputes over parking spots or rude gestures. A report found that 6.8% of selected road rage incidents result in death.

According to one study, people who customize their cars with stickers and other adornments are more prone to road rage. In the study, the number of territory markers predicted road rage better than did vehicle value or condition. Only the number of bumper stickers, not their content, predicted road rage.

Common targets of road rage are driving instructors and learner drivers; as these road users tend to follow road regulations very closely, with learners prone to making more mistakes, they are often antagonized by aggressive drivers. In 2019, a survey by British insurance provider Young Marmalade found that 77% of driving instructors face regular abuse and intimidation from other road users while teaching students, and that 8% of learner drivers have abandoned learning to drive as a result of road rage they have experienced.

Road rage is not an official mental disorder recognized in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (&quot;DSM&quot;). However, according to an article published by the Associated Press in June 2006, the behaviors typically associated with road rage can be the result of a disorder known as intermittent explosive disorder that is recognized in the DSM. This conclusion was drawn from surveys of 9,200 adults in the United States between 2001 and 2003. The surveys were funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.

==Penalties==
Road rage is a potentially serious act, and it may be seen as an endangerment of public safety. However, it is not always possible to judge intent by observation, so &quot;road ragers&quot; who are stopped by police may be charged with other offenses such as careless or reckless driving, or may be fined or arrested. Some consider road ragers to be criminals.

===Australia===
In New South Wales, Australia, road rage is considered an extremely serious act. Any person who &quot;engages in a course of conduct that causes or threatens an impact involving the other vehicle&quot; while intending to cause a person bodily harm can be charged with predatory driving, a serious offense that can send the culprit to jail for up to five years. Offenders can also be fined A$100,000 and disqualified from driving, regardless of intent to physically harm the victim. If the predatory driving results in physical assault or harm, and/or the victim&#x27;s car is intentionally damaged, penalties can be much more severe.

Most common-law countries prohibit common assault, which could apply to road rage in which the personal safety of the victim is seen to be threatened. The common law regards assault as both a criminal and civil matter, leading to both public criminal penalties and private civil liabilities.

===Germany===
Road rage, insults, and rude gestures in traffic can lead to fines and prison sentences for drivers who shout insults or make offensive gestures while driving.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, road rage in itself is not an offense, but drivers are usually charged with other offences committed during an act of road rage (usually assault or unlawful possession of an offensive weapon). Drivers have a legal duty to take reasonable care to avoid endangerment of human life when operating a vehicle (s 156 Crimes Act 1961); failure to discharge this duty, such as an act of aggressive driving, can give rise to liability in criminal nuisance (s 146 Crimes Act 1961). Ramming a vehicle constitutes intentional or reckless damage to property, a criminal offense, with a maximum penalty of seven years of imprisonment (s 269 Crimes Act 1961). New Zealand courts currently have no powers to disqualify drivers who physically assault another road user.

===Singapore===
Road rage is a crime in Singapore. Offenders found guilty of road rage may be liable to an imprisonment term of up to two years and / or a fine of up to $5,000 for causing damage.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, road rage can result in criminal penalties for assault or more serious offenses against the person. The Public Order Act 1986 can also apply to road rage. Sections 4A and 5 of the 1986 Act prohibit public acts likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. Section 4 also prohibits threatening, abusive or insulting words or behavior with intent to cause a victim to believe that violence will be used against himself or another.

===United States===
In some jurisdictions, such as the Commonwealth of Virginia, it is easier to prosecute road rage as reckless driving instead of aggressive driving simply because the burden of proof does not require intent to successfully convict.

It is likely that those causing serious injury or death during road-rage incidents will suffer more serious penalties than those applicable to similar outcomes from simple negligence. In April 2007, a Colorado driver was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to two consecutive life terms for causing the deaths of two motorists in November 2005.

Fourteen U.S. states have passed laws against aggressive driving. Only one state, California, has turned &quot;road rage&quot; into a legal term of art by giving it a particular meaning. In Virginia, aggressive driving is punished as a lesser crime (Class 2 misdemeanor) than is reckless driving (Class 1 misdemeanor).

==Rankings==
===United Kingdom===
In the UK, most aggressive driving occurs in the East Riding of Yorkshire, while the least occurs in Durham, according to 2022 surveys.

===United States===
A 2007 study of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas concluded that the cities with the least courteous drivers (most road rage) are Miami, Phoenix, New York, Los Angeles and Boston. The cities with the most courteous drivers (least road rage) are Minneapolis, Nashville, St. Louis, Seattle and Atlanta. In a 2009 AutoVantage survey, New York, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Atlanta and Minneapolis/St. Paul were rated the top five American cities for road rage.

According to the Texas Department of Transportation, there were 2,510 road rage-related accidents in Texas in 2022, with the largest number occurring in the cities of San Antonio and Houston. The cities with the highest per capita rates were Midlothian, San Antonio and New Braunfels.

<doc id="893041" wikidata="Q1361221" url="?curid=893041" title="Iain Dowie">
<text>Iain Dowie (born 9 January 1965) is a football manager, former professional footballer and sports television pundit.

He played as a striker from 1983 until 2001, notably in the Premier League for Southampton, Crystal Palace and West Ham United. He earned 59 caps for Northern Ireland, scoring 12 goals. He also played in the Football League for Luton Town, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers, and in Non-league for Cheshunt, St Albans City and Hendon. 

After retiring from playing he went on to manage Oldham Athletic, Crystal Palace, Charlton Athletic, Coventry City, Queens Park Rangers before joining Hull City in a football management consultant. He has since worked as a pundit largely for Sky Sports.

==Club career==
Born in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, Dowie was rejected by Southampton aged 16 and later went to the University of Hertfordshire to study for a MEng degree in engineering. On completion he became an employee of British Aerospace, whilst keeping up football at non-League level playing for Cheshunt alongside his brother Bob. He left Cheshunt to improve his fitness and signed for St Albans City, then moved on to Hendon. While playing for Hendon, Dowie was spotted by Luton Town who signed him in the 1988–89 season, when they were in the First Division. An old-fashioned centre-forward, he then moved in quick succession to Fulham (a brief loan spell), before establishing himself as a first team player in the 1989–90 season when his eight goals in 29 league games helped Luton finish seventeenth.

On 22 March 1991, with Luton still in the First Division and Dowie still a first team regular with seven goals from 29 games that season, Dowie agreed to join Second Division promotion chasers West Ham United for a fee of £480,000. He proved himself to be a competent deputy for the injured Trevor Morley as his four goals in the final 12 league games of the season secured the team&#x27;s promotion as Second Division runners-up. But when the 1991–92 season began, Morley had returned to fitness and Dowie found himself on the sidelines until his £500,000 move to Southampton on 3 September 1991 after less than six months at Upton Park.

He played alongside Alan Shearer and Matthew Le Tissier – two of the country&#x27;s highest regarded strikers in the early 1990s – and scored nine goals in 30 league games to ensure that the team finished high enough for a place in the newly formed FA Premier League. His good form continued in the 1992–93 season, despite the loss of Shearer, as he scored 11 league goals. His tally dropped to five goals in 39 games during the 1993–94 season, though the club avoided relegation again, and he managed another five goals from 17 league games in the 1994–95 season before manager Alan Ball decided that he wanted younger partners for Le Tissier in attack, signing Gordon Watson and Neil Shipperley while dropping Craig Maskell and selling Dowie to Crystal Palace for £400,000 on 13 January 1995.

His spell at Palace was a frustrating one; he was cup-tied for the League Cup semi-finals against Liverpool, and Palace reached the FA Cup semi-finals where they lost to Manchester United after a replay. Lastly, despite a dynamic fightback after being three goals down to Newcastle United on the final day of the season, they still lost 3–2 and were relegated from the Premier League one season after promotion.

He then spent nearly three years back at West Ham. During his time back at West Ham, he came under fire from the supporters for going long periods without scoring at a time when the team were struggling for goals and had a crisis in attack. In fact, Dowie is probably best remembered by West Ham fans for scoring a bizarre headed own goal in an infamous defeat to Stockport County in the League Cup in front of the live Sky cameras at Edgeley Park. Dowie then moved across London to Queens Park Rangers (QPR), where he ended his days playing in defence, and being player-manager of QPR&#x27;s reserve team. Dowie also had a brief spell as caretaker manager of QPR in the autumn of 1998, between the dismissal of Ray Harford and appointment of Gerry Francis.

==International career==
Dowie&#x27;s father was born in Belfast, thus qualifying him to play for Northern Ireland, for whom Dowie gained 59 caps and scored 12 goals.

==Management career==
===Oldham Athletic===
After retirement from playing, Dowie then became assistant manager of Oldham Athletic. However, following the dismissal of manager Mick Wadsworth, Dowie became manager and led the club into the Second Division play-offs in the 2002–03 season after spending heavily. However, financial trouble hit Oldham and Dowie lost much of his first team squad. Funds were so hard for the club at the time that Dowie along with the remaining members of the squad were not paid for several months. Dowie tried to stick out the post for as long as possible until he decided to move on citing the need to support his family as a reason.

===Crystal Palace===
On 21 December 2003, Dowie was appointed manager of Crystal Palace, inheriting a squad with low morale and occupying 19th place in Division One. However, under his leadership, the club went on an impressive run that included 17 wins from 23 games after he took over, until the end of the season, enabling the club to finish in sixth place in the First Division, just scraping into the play-off places. This feat was attributed to complete change in the atmosphere and training regime at the club, including a tougher disciplinary regime, introduced by Dowie. After beating Sunderland in the semi-final, on a penalty shootout, the club beat Dowie&#x27;s former club West Ham by a single goal in the Final for a place in the FA Premier League. Dowie&#x27;s squad contained some promising footballers, including Andrew Johnson. Dowie made a couple of signings to the Crystal Palace squad: he signed goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly to challenge Julián Speroni for the number 1 top. Kiraly was first choice throughout the season. The club lasted only one season there, being relegated on the final day of the season when Charlton Athletic scored a late equaliser in a 2–2 draw.

He remained at Palace when the club was relegated to the Championship despite rumours that he was approached by other Premier League clubs to take over. The only actual report of a club approaching Palace to speak to Dowie was when Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandarić approached Palace chairman Simon Jordan to speak to Dowie, in November 2005. Jordan refused this approach, and for the meantime Dowie remained at Selhurst Park.

After losing the play-off semi final to eventual winners Watford, Dowie left Crystal Palace by &quot;mutual consent&quot; on 22 May 2006 following discussions with chairman Jordan. He had been allowed to leave without compensation being paid to Crystal Palace as he had wanted to be nearer to his family in Bolton. Jordan was infuriated when just eight days later, on 30 May 2006, Premier League club Charlton unveiled Dowie as their new manager.

Jordan then issued Dowie with a writ, claiming that he had misled him about his reasons for leaving Crystal Palace. Dowie, however, insisted this was not the case, and was publicly backed by both Charlton Chief Executive Peter Varney, who branded the writ &quot;a sad and pathetic publicity stunt&quot;, and chairman Richard Murray, who was adamant that his legal team could find no grounds for the writ to be upheld, and suggested that there may be more personal reasons behind the writ being issued. The case was heard in the London High Court in the summer of 2007, and on 14 June The Hon. Mr Justice Tugendhat ruled that Dowie had &quot;deceived&quot; Jordan and made &quot;false representations&quot; in conversations with Crystal Palace on 20 and 22 May, stating he had had no contact with Charlton when he had in fact spoken to them on 17 and 22 May. Dowie was ordered to pay Palace&#x27;s legal bill, estimated at up to £400,000 and a similar amount to his own legal team in addition to compensation due to Crystal Palace. In 2008 an out-of-court agreement between Dowie and Crystal Palace was reached &quot;on terms acceptable to Crystal Palace Football Club&quot;.

===Charlton Athletic===
When Dowie took over at the Valley, he was given more money than any previous manager to spend on players. He signed Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, and Scott Carson on loan, but was unable to prevent the team suffering a disastrous start to the Premier League season. Despite this, the team reached the quarter-final of the League Cup for the first time in their history. However, Dowie was unable to lift the team away from the relegation zone of the Premier League and build on the success of former manager Alan Curbishley, resulting in him and the club parting company on 13 November 2006, after just 15 games in charge.

Soon after his departure from Charlton, in December 2006, he was linked with the vacant managers job at Hull City, but he turned down the position.

===Coventry City===
Dowie was unveiled as Coventry City manager on 19 February 2007. He found immediate success at the club with a number of wins but towards the end of the season their form dropped off and the Sky Blues finished 17th in the Championship table.

On 29 August, Dowie was linked with the vacant manager&#x27;s position at Leicester City following the dismissal of Martin Allen. Coventry City dismissed claims that an approach was made and that any approach would be &quot;firmly rebuffed&quot;. These rumours renewed again on 24 October when Gary Megson left Leicester to manage Bolton Wanderers. Dowie refused to comment on the speculation. On 11 February 2008, Dowie was released from his contract as Coventry manager, which was officially cited as being due to significant differences of opinion between the management team and the Board as to how the club should be going forward.

===Queens Park Rangers===
On 14 May 2008, Queens Park Rangers appointed Dowie as their new first team coach following the previous week&#x27;s departure of Luigi de Canio. He was sacked as manager of QPR after just 15 games in charge on 24 October, with the team in ninth position in the league.

===Newcastle United===
On 1 April 2009, Newcastle United appointed Alan Shearer as manager until the end of the season, with Dowie being appointed to his coaching staff.

===Hull City===
Dowie was named as the temporary &quot;Football Management Consultant&quot; of Premier League team Hull City on 17 March 2010, after manager Phil Brown was placed on gardening leave. He was faced with the challenge of guiding the Yorkshire club to Premier League safety in order to secure them a third season in the top flight; however, the challenge was effectively ended on 24 April 2010 when Hull were beaten 1–0 at home by Sunderland and fellow relegation battlers West Ham United (a club that Dowie served twice as a player) won their game 3–2 against a Wigan Athletic side still faced with an outside chance of relegation. Hull City were relegated on 3 May 2010 after an injury time equaliser from Wigan Athletic&#x27;s Steve Gohouri made their game 2–2, ending Hull&#x27;s hopes of survival with one game to go.

==Personal life==
Dowie worked as a commentator for Sky Sports News.

His niece Natasha Dowie is an international footballer who played for Charlton Athletic Women while he was manager of the men&#x27;s team. Dowie has two sons, Oliver and William. Dowie&#x27;s brother, Bob, was a semi-professional footballer and manager and worked alongside Iain as Director of Football at Crystal Palace.

In March 2016, Dowie was employed as Regional Sales Manager for &quot;Go To Surveys&quot;.

He coined the word &#x27;bouncebackability&#x27; which entered the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in 2005.

Dowie suffered a cardiac arrest in March 2024 during an exercise class in Chorley.

<text>The Vampire Armand (1998) is a vampire novel by American writer Anne Rice, the sixth in her &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; series.

==Plot summary==
With Lestat de Lioncourt still in slumber since &quot;Memnoch the Devil&quot;, the vampire coven is reunited around the &quot;brat prince&quot; and the vampire David Talbot asks Armand to tell his life story.

Born somewhere in the Kyivan Rus in the late 15th century, Armand (at this time called Andriy) becomes an icon painter in a monastery. He is forcefully taken out of this life of prayer and devotion by slave traders, who transport him to Constantinople and then to a brothel in Venice. Soon after his arrival, he is purchased by the vampire Marius de Romanus, who names him Amadeo.

Marius lives the extravagant life of a respected Renaissance painter, and mentors many boys who serve as his apprentices. Marius provides them with education, shelter, and food, and he assists them in finding respectable positions once they are grown. Over time, Amadeo&#x27;s relationship with Marius develops and they become much closer than Marius is with any of the other boys. In addition to developing a sexual relationship, Amadeo sleeps in Marius&#x27; bed, is privy to special privileges, and becomes something of a &quot;head boy&quot; in the household. Still, Marius maintains strict control over Amadeo, and expects industriousness from him in all things.

When Amadeo comes of age, Marius begins Amadeo&#x27;s education in sexuality and coupling. He takes Amadeo to a brothel, where he remains for several days. Amadeo later visits a male brothel, and makes several observations about the difference in sexual activities with the different genders. There is a distinct bisexuality to Amadeo&#x27;s nature, as he enjoys activity with either sex. He later has a brief affair with an Englishman called Lord Harlech, who develops an unrequited obsession with Amadeo. During this period, Amadeo befriends and ultimately seduces Bianca Solderini, a wealthy debutante and courtesan whose primary role in life seems to be to throw nightly parties.

Marius eventually divulges his vampire nature to Amadeo, who almost immediately begins asking to be turned. Marius shows Amadeo some of what it means to be immortal, and allows him to join him in the hunt on several occasions. He tells Amadeo that they must always focus on killing evildoers; they assist Bianca by murdering her kinsmen who have been forcing her to poison those from whom they have borrowed money.

Eventually, on a night when Marius is out of the country, Harlech breaks into Marius&#x27;s palazzo and attacks Amadeo, murdering two apprentices in the process. Amadeo kills Harlech, but not before the Englishman wounds him with a poisoned sword. Amadeo falls critically ill, and over several days falls into fever and delusions. Upon returning and finding Amadeo on his deathbed, Marius heals Amadeo&#x27;s external wounds, cleans and grooms him, then gives him the Dark Gift, turning him into a vampire.

Marius sets out to train Amadeo, retaining high expectations of him, and forces him to continue his education in the arts. Amadeo&#x27;s transition to vampire is relatively easy for him, although the Dark Gift brings about nightmares of his childhood. Marius and Amadeo return to Ukraine, where Amadeo visits his old school and home. He finds his elderly parents, reveals that he is alive, and leaves them with all the money and jewels he has with him.

Shortly after returning to Venice, the vampire Santino and his coven attack Marius&#x27; home, kidnap Amadeo and the apprentices, and burn the villa. Marius is burned and thought to be destroyed; his boys are taken to a bonfire and thrown in one by one by the coven as Amadeo watches. Santino spares Amadeo and educates him in the laws of the coven. Amadeo later goes to Paris, changes his name to Armand, and creates his own coven under the Cimetière des Innocents, which Lestat would years later drastically impact, thus resulting in the creation of the Théâtre des Vampires.

In the final segment of the book, Armand explains what occurred to him after the final chapters of &quot;Memnoch the Devil&quot;. At the end of &quot;Memnoch the Devil&quot;, Armand rushes into the open daylight and appears to be destroyed in a conflagration. Armand explains to David that by some means beyond his understanding he survived, and ended up on a rooftop in a stairwell protected from further exposure to the sun. However, he is badly burned and unable to move or fully function. While in this delirious state, he makes a mental connection to an adult and child in a nearby apartment—Sybelle and Benji. The connection is forged through Sybelle&#x27;s constant piano playing.

Eventually, Armand is able to reach out to the children and lead them to him. They believe he is an angel, but are moderately unsurprised when Armand divulges his true nature to them. Armand cannot hunt, so the two agree to trick a drug dealer up to the apartment so that Armand may feed on him. The plan works, and ultimately Armand is fully healed. He becomes friends with Sybelle and Benji and ultimately falls in love with them. He shares his wealth with them without limit, mirroring the relationship Marius had with him to a certain degree.

Armand brings them to see Lestat, which he has some concerns about since vampires are traditionally not safe for mortals to be around. After trying to wake Lestat from his catatonic state, Armand returns to Marius&#x27;s house to discover that Marius has given Benji and Sybelle the Dark Gift. Armand is at first furious at Marius because he wanted Sybelle and Benji to have full, mortal lives. The fact that Benji is ecstatic about the prospect of eternal life, only serves to fuel his anger. Marius explains to Armand that he did it since Armand never could without the two coming to hate him for it. Marius is willing to take the burden of Sybelle and Benji&#x27;s eventual anger.

<text>Reitmans Canada Ltd. is a Canadian retailing company, specializing in women&#x27;s clothing. The company operates several store brands, including Reitmans, Penningtons, and RW&amp;CO.

Reitmans was founded in 1926 by Herman and Sarah Reitman, in Montreal, Quebec. The immediate success of the first store on Saint Laurent Boulevard prompted the Reitmans to open a second store which sold exclusively women&#x27;s clothing. The founders&#x27; grandson Jeremy Reitman (who died in 2019) would later serve as chairman of the board and chief executive officer, with his brother Stephen Reitman as president and chief operating officer. By 2016, the company was active in 685 locations with stores in every province and two of three territories in Canada. For the fiscal year of 2015, net earnings were $13,415,000 on sales of $939,376,000. However, Reitmans Canada Limited sought protection under the &quot;Companies&#x27; Creditors Arrangement Act&quot; (the &quot;CCAA&quot;) in May 2020 in order to facilitate its operational, commercial and financial restructuring. They subsequently closed their Thyme Maternity (54 locations) and Addition Elle (77 locations) stores over the summer of 2020. As at April 30, 2022, the Company emerged from protection and operated 406 stores consisting of 237 Reitmans, 92 Penningtons and 77 RW&amp;CO.
The company&#x27;s stock was moved from the Toronto Stock Exchange to the TSX Venture Exchange.

In June 2023, Andrea Limbardi is named as president and chief executive, the company&#x27;s first non-family member to occupy this position.

<text>Peter Hanson Coors (born September 20, 1946) is an American businessman and politician. He formerly served as the chairman of the Molson Coors Brewing Company and chairman of MillerCoors.

Coors was the Republican Party nominee in the 2004 United States Senate election in Colorado.

==Early life==
Coors was born in Golden, Colorado. He is the great-grandson of Adolph Coors, the brewing entrepreneur, and the son of Holly Coors (born Edith Holland Hanson) and Joseph Coors. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy and then from Cornell University from which he received a degree in engineering. A member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity, Coors was elected to the Sphinx Head Society during his final year at Cornell. He also received his MBA from the University of Denver in 1970.

==Career==
Coors has worked all of his life in various positions at his family&#x27;s firm, the Coors Brewing Company.

In 1993, Coors became vice chairman and CEO of the company, and in 2002, he was named chairman of Coors Brewing Company and Adolph Coors Company. In 2004, according to the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;, Coors &quot;made $332,402 in salary and a $296,917 bonus as chairman of Adolph Coors. He also received 125,000 stock options with a potential value of $13 million&quot;. He stepped down temporarily from these positions in 2004 to run for the US Senate. After the 2005 merger with Molson, Coors became a Class A Director in the newly formed Molson Coors Brewing Company.

On May 7, 2018, Coors wrote an open letter criticizing the hostility toward &quot;Big Beer,&quot; i.e., large brewing companies, at a Craft Brewers Conference sponsored by the Brewers Association. &quot;The leadership of the Brewers Association does a great disservice to the entire beer value chain by attempting to pit one part of the industry against another,&quot; he charged.

In a May 14, 2018 opinion piece for the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, Coors urged President Trump, whom he respects, to put an end to the Midwest Premium, a &quot;mysterious fee&quot; added to aluminum orders in the U.S. &quot;It is time to fix this mess and end the premium once and for all,&quot; he wrote. &quot;A private solution would be best — one crafted by producers, buyers, market makers and customers like Molson Coors. Let us forge a new deal on aluminum, to the benefit of a hundred million fans of the most American of beverages. President Trump, are you with us?&quot;

At the end of 2019, Coors retired from his role as the company&#x27;s chief customer relations officer. He remains a company ambassador.

===Board memberships and other professional activities===
In October 2006, he was appointed by the University of Colorado Hospital board of directors as chairman of the board for the new University of Colorado Hospital Foundation.

He has served on the boards of U.S. Bancorp, H. J. Heinz Company, HOBY (Hugh O&#x27;Brian Youth Leadership) Colorado, and Energy Corp. of America. He is also involved in civic organizations such as the Denver Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America and the National Western Stock Show Association. He is also part of the ownership group of the Colorado Rockies. He is a member of the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. In 1997, Coors was granted an honorary doctorate from Johnson &amp; Wales University, where he is a trustee. He sits on the board of trustees of the American Enterprise Institute.

==Politics==
When U.S. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell declared in 2004 that he was retiring, Coors announced his candidacy. His opponent in the Republican primary election was another conservative, former congressman Bob Schaffer. During their primary, the two candidates engaged in an ideological disagreement, with Schaffer attacking Coors because his company had provided benefits to the partners of its gay and lesbian employees, in addition to promoting its beer in gay bars. Coors defended himself by saying that he was opposed to same-sex marriage, and supported a constitutional amendment to ban it, although he noted that he supported civil unions for gay couples. According to the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;, Coors described his company&#x27;s pro-LGBT practices as &quot;good business, separate from politics.&quot; He defeated Schaffer with 61% of the vote in the primary, with many analysts citing his high name recognition in the state as a primary factor.

Coors faced Democrat and Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar in the November 2004 election, and was defeated by a margin of 51% to 47%.

According to the non-partisan OpenSecrets, Coors gave his own campaign $1,213,657 and received individual donations of $60,550 from other Coors family members. He was mentioned as a possible contender in the 2008 Senate election.

===Election results===

Coors has been described as &quot;a major donor in Colorado politics.&quot; In 2016, Coors donated $5,000 to Leadership Matters for America, a super PAC supporting the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump, and $5,000 to Right to Rise, which supported Jeb Bush.

==Personal life==
Coors is married to Marilyn Coors (born Grosso) and has six children.

On May 28, 2006, Coors was arrested by the Colorado State Patrol on suspicion of driving under the influence and registering a blood alcohol level higher than the legal limit (0.088). Coors commented on the incident, saying, &quot;I should have planned ahead for a ride. For years, I&#x27;ve advocated the responsible use of our company&#x27;s products. That&#x27;s still my message, and our company&#x27;s message. I am sorry that I didn&#x27;t follow it myself.&quot;

On August 25, 2006, Coors pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of driving while impaired. A judge sentenced Coors to 24 hours of community service and a suspended fine and ordered him to undergo alcohol education courses.

<text>Sarah Reitman (c. 1881–1950) was a Romanian–Canadian businesswoman and co-founder in 1926 of Reitmans with her husband Herman Reitman.
Herman and Sarah Reitman were born in Romania and moved to the United States, then to Canada in 1907 for better prospects. In 1911, they opened a small store called American Ladies Tailoring and Dressmaking in Montreal. It specialised in dressmaking needs for ladies, namely made to measure garments. Later on, they moved away from this field and towards a dry goods general store. In 1926, they opened a glove and hosiery store that became the origin of the Reitman&#x27;s chain.

<doc id="893071" wikidata="Q332700" url="?curid=893071" title="Robert Finlay, 1st Viscount Finlay">
<text>Robert Bannatyne Finlay, 1st Viscount Finlay, (11 July 1842 – 9 March 1929), known as Sir Robert Finlay from 1895 to 1916, was a British barrister and politician who was Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1916 to 1919.

==Background and education==
Finlay was born at Cherry Bank in Newhaven, Edinburgh, the son of William Finlay, a physician, and Ann, daughter of Robert Bannatyne. He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy and Edinburgh University, graduating in medicine in 1864.

==Legal and political career==
After entering Middle Temple as a student in 1865, Finlay was called to the bar two years later and built up a successful practice, becoming a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1882. Three years later he was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for the Inverness Burghs, but broke with William Ewart Gladstone over Irish Home Rule and joined the Liberal Unionists in 1886. He lost his seat in 1892 but regained it three years later, the same year he was appointed Solicitor-General and knighted.

In 1900, Finlay became Attorney-General for England and also became President of the Edinburgh Sir Walter Scott Club, and gave the Toast to Sir Walter at the club&#x27;s annual dinner. In November 1902 he was elected Lord Rector of Edinburgh University for three years, and the same month he was elected Treasurer of the Middle Temple for the ensuing year. For his services in representing the British Empire in a number of international legal arbitrations he was appointed GCMG in 1904, and the following year became a Privy Counsellor. However, in the 1906 general election he again lost his seat, and it was four years before he returned to Parliament as member for Edinburgh and St Andrews Universities.

One of his last official acts as Attorney General was to appoint his son, William Finlay, as the junior counsel to the Board of Inland Revenue, an appointment which provoked much negative comment.

== Judicial career ==
On 19 December 1916, Finlay became Lord Chancellor in Lloyd George&#x27;s coalition government, being at the same time created Baron Finlay, of Nairn in the County of Nairn. It is generally thought that Finlay was a temporary appointment: Lloyd George excluded him from the War Cabinet and insisted that he forgo the £5,000 pension given to retired lord chancellors. He sat on the Woolsack for three years, and in 1919, on his retirement, was created Viscount Finlay, of Nairn in the County of Nairn on 27 March.

The following year he was appointed a British member of the Court of Arbitration at The Hague, and in 1921 was elected a Judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice established by the League of Nations. As a judge of the Permanent Court, he participated in the celebrated &quot; Lotus&quot; case in 1927, where the Court, by a bare majority, laid down the &quot;Lotus principle&quot; that States may exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction i.e. they may apply their national laws beyond their own borders, in any case where this is not explicitly prohibited. Finlay himself dissented from the majority decision.

Finlay received the freedom of the Royal burgh of Nairn on 1 October 1902.

==Family==
Lord Finlay married Mary, daughter of Cosmo Innes, in 1874. She died in June 1911. Lord Finlay died in March 1929, aged 86, at his home in Kensington, London, and was buried at Nairn. He was succeeded in his titles by his son, William Finlay, later a Lord Justice of Appeal.

<text>The Kermadec Islands ( ; ) are a subtropical island arc in the South Pacific Ocean northeast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, and a similar distance southwest of Tonga. The islands are part of New Zealand. They are in total area and uninhabited, except for the permanently staffed Raoul Island Station, the northernmost outpost of New Zealand.

The islands are listed with the New Zealand outlying islands. The islands are an immediate part of New Zealand, but not part of any region or district, but instead an &quot;Area Outside Territorial Authority&quot;.

==Toponymy==
The islands were named after the Breton captain Jean-Michel Huon de Kermadec, who visited the islands as part of the d&#x27;Entrecasteaux expedition in the 1790s. The topographic particle &quot;Kermadec&quot; is of Breton origin and is a lieu-dit in Pencran in Finistère where &quot;&quot; means village, residence and &quot;madec&quot; a proper name derived from &quot;&quot; (which means &#x27;good&#x27;) with the suffix &quot;&quot;, used to form adjectives indicating a property.

The Māori name is Rangitāhua which is also used for Raoul island.

==History==
As indicated by their name for the islands, Rangitāhua (), Polynesian people &quot;stopped off&quot; on the Kermadec islands in around the 14th century (and perhaps previously in the 10th century). Their arrival is also evident in the presence of introduced taro and candlenut growing wild in certain areas of Raoul Island supported by its relatively warm climate. However, the first Europeans to reach the areaarriving on board the &quot;Lady Penrhyn&quot; in May 1788found no inhabitants on these volcanic islands.

British, American and Australian whaling vessels cruised offshore in the 19th century and often visited the islands in search of water, wood and food. The first such vessel on record was the whaler &quot;Fanny&quot; that visited Raoul Island in 1823.

On 1 August 1886, HMS &quot;Diamond&quot; annexed the islands for the United Kingdom. European settlers have lived on the island for varying lengths of time, from the early nineteenth century until 1937, growing food for the whalers. The Thomas Bell family settled on the island from 1878 to 1914. One of the Bell daughters, Bessie Dyke, recounted the family&#x27;s experience to writer Elsie K. Morton who published their story in 1957 as &quot;Crusoes of Sunday Island&quot;.

The islands were annexed to New Zealand in 1887 according to one source. However the Encyclopaedia of New Zealand states the annexation happened in 1886.

===Raoul Island Station===
The Raoul Island Station consists of a government meteorological and radio station, and a hostel for Department of Conservation officers and volunteers, that has been maintained since 1937. It lies on the northern terraces of Raoul Island, at an elevation of about , above the cliffs of Fleetwood Bluff. It is the northernmost inhabited outpost of New Zealand.

===Nuclear testing proposals===
In 1955, the British Government required a large site remote from population centres to test the new thermonuclear devices it was developing. Various islands in the South Pacific and Southern Oceans were considered, along with Antarctica. In May 1955, the Minister for Defence, Selwyn Lloyd, on advice from the Admiralty report, concluded that the Kermadec Islands would be suitable. As the island group was part of New Zealand, Anthony Eden, who had recently become the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, wrote to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Sidney Holland, to ask for permission to use the islands. Holland refused, fearing an adverse public reaction in the upcoming 1957 general election. Despite reassurances and pressure from the British government, Holland remained firm.

==Geography==
The islands lie within 29° to 31.5° south latitude and 178° to 179° west longitude, northeast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, and a similar distance southwest of Tonga. The total area of the islands is .

===Climate===
The climate of the islands is subtropical, with a mean monthly temperature of in February and in August. Rainfall is approximately annually, with lower rainfall from October to January.

===Islands===
The group includes four main islands as well as some isolated rocks. These are:
* Raoul Island or Sunday Island is by far the largest of the islands. It lies south-southwest of &#x27;Ata, the southernmost island of Tonga, and north-northeast of New Zealand. Raoul Island has an area of with numerous smaller satellite islands; its highest point, Moumoukai peak, is high.
* Macauley Island, the second largest, is located south-southwest of Raoul Island. Together with neighbouring Haszard Island, its area is .
** Macdonald Rock is about north of Macauley Island.
* Curtis Island, the third largest, lies south-southwest of Macauley Island. It reaches a height of and has an area of with neighbouring Cheeseman Island.
* Nugent Island is the northernmost island. It is approximately across.
* L&#x27;Esperance Rock, formerly French Rock, is south-southwest of Curtis Island. It is in diameter, in area, and high.
* L&#x27;Havre Rock, about north-northwest of L&#x27;Esperance Rock, is submerged except at low tide.

Seamounts north and south of the Kermadec Islands are an extension of the ridge running from Tonga to New Zealand (see Geology). Star of Bengal Bank, south-southwest of L&#x27;Esperance Rock, has a least depth of .

===Geology===
The islands are a volcanic island arc, formed at the convergent boundary where the Pacific Plate subducts under the Indo-Australian Plate. The subducting Pacific Plate created the Kermadec Trench, an 8 km deep submarine trench, to the east of the islands. The islands lie along the undersea Kermadec Ridge, which runs southwest from the islands towards the North Island of New Zealand and northeast towards Tonga (Kermadec-Tonga Arc).

The four main islands are the peaks of volcanoes that rise high enough from the seabed to project above sea level. There are several other volcanoes in the chain that do not reach sea level, but form seamounts with between 65 and 1500 m of water above their peaks. Monowai Seamount, with a depth of 120 m over its peak, is midway between Raoul Island and Tonga. 100 km south of L&#x27;Esperance Rock is the little-explored Star of Bengal Bank, probably with submarine volcanoes.

Further south are the South Kermadec Ridge Seamounts, the southernmost of which, Rumble IV Seamount, is just 150 km North of the North Island of New Zealand. The ridge eventually connects to White Island in New Zealand&#x27;s Bay of Plenty, at the northern end of the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The islands experience many earthquakes from plate movement and volcanism.

Raoul and Curtis are both active volcanoes. The volcanoes on the other islands are currently inactive, and the smaller islands are the eroded remnants of extinct volcanoes.

From 18 to 21 July 2012, Havre Seamount (near Havre Rock) erupted, breaching the ocean surface from a depth of more than 1100 m and producing a large raft of pumice floating northwest of the volcano. The eruption was not directly observed, but it was located using earthquake and remote sensing data after the pumice raft was spotted by aircraft and encountered by HMNZS &quot;Canterbury&quot;.

The islands are seismically active. An 8.1 magnitude earthquake occurred in the early hours of 5 March 2021, leading to several strong aftershocks and a tsunami advisory on the North Coast of North Island and other Pacific islands, including Norfolk Island, Australia. Other magnitude 8 earthquakes have struck near the islands in 1917 and 1976.

==Environment==
===Flora===
The islands are recognised by the World Wildlife Fund as a distinct ecoregion, the Kermadec Islands subtropical moist forests. It is a tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests ecoregion, part of the Oceanian realm. The forests are dominated by the red-flowering Kermadec pōhutukawa, related to the pōhutukawa of New Zealand. The islands are home to 113 native species of vascular plants, of which 23 are endemic, along with mosses (52 native species), lichens and fungi (89 native species). Most of the plant species are derived from New Zealand, with others having travelled over the Pacific. 152 human-introduced species of plants have become established on the islands.

Dense subtropical forests cover most of Raoul, and formerly covered Macauley. &quot;Metrosideros kermadecensis&quot; is the dominant forest tree, forming a 10 – 15-metre (30 – 50-foot) high canopy. A native nīkau palm (&quot;Rhopalostylis baueri&quot;) is another important canopy tree. The forests have an understory of smaller trees, shrubs, ferns, and herbs, including &quot;Myrsine kermadecensis&quot;; &quot;Lobelia anceps&quot;, &quot;Poa polyphylla&quot;, &quot;Coprosma acutifolia&quot;, and &quot;Coriaria arborea&quot;. Two endemic tree ferns, &quot;Alsophila milnei&quot; and the rare and endangered &quot;Alsophila kermadecensis&quot;, are also found in the forests.

Areas near the seashore and exposed to salt spray are covered by a distinct community of shrubs and ferns, notably &quot;Myoporum obscurum&quot;, &quot;Coprosma petiolata&quot;, &quot;Asplenium obtusatum&quot;, &quot;Cyperus ustulatus&quot;, &quot;Disphyma australe&quot;, and &quot;Ficinia nodosa&quot;.

===Fauna===
The islands have no native land mammals. An endemic bird subspecies is the Kermadec red-crowned parakeet. The group has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for several species of seabirds, including white-necked and black-winged petrels, wedge-tailed and little shearwaters, sooty terns and blue noddies. The area also hosts rich habitats for cetaceans. In recent years, increased presences of humpback whales indicate Kermadec Islands functioning as migratory corridors, and varieties of baleen (not in great numbers) and toothed whales including minke whales, sperm whales, less known beaked whales, killer whales, and dolphins frequent in adjacent waters. In late September 2015, satellite tags were attached to 25 humpback whales around Raoul Island, which were tracked to feeding grounds in Antarctica and across to the Antarctic Peninsula. Vast numbers of southern right whales were historically seen in southwestern areas although only a handful of recent confirmations exist around Raoul Island. The deep sea hydrothermal vents along the Kermadec ridge support diverse extremophile communities including the New Zealand blind vent crab. Three new records of tropical reef fishes were recorded from the Kermadec Islands Marine Reserve in 2015 after researchers examined hundreds of hours of unused documentary film footage, and in 2016, a red velvet whalefish and an angler fish (&quot;Ceratias tentaculatus&quot;) were found around the waters of the Kermadec Islands by a research partnership between Ngāti Kurī, University of Auckland, Massey University, NIWA, Manaaki Whenua, and the University of Waikato.

In 2016, Koha, a hawksbill turtle, which was originally found injured near Dargaville in September 2014, was released around the waters of Raoul Island and nursed back to health at Kelly Tarlton&#x27;s Sea Life Aquarium. The release was from the deck of the RV Tangaroa, with land in sight to enable Koha to orientate itself to prevent the risk of getting lost in the open ocean.

===Conservation===
The introduction of cats, rats, and goats devastated the forests and seabirds. Overgrazing by goats eliminated the forests of Macauley Island, leaving open grasslands, and altered the understory of Raoul Island. Predation by rats and cats reduced the seabird colonies on the main islands from millions of birds to tens of thousands. The New Zealand government has been working for the last few decades to restore the islands. New Zealand declared the islands a nature reserve in 1937, and the sea around them a marine reserve in 1990. The marine reserve surrounds each of the islands and is one of New Zealand&#x27;s largest at a total area of .

Goats were removed from Macauley in 1970 and from Raoul in 1984, and the forests have begun to recover. The islands are still known for their bird life, and seabird colonies presently inhabit offshore islets, which are safe from introduced rats and cats. Efforts are currently underway to remove the rats and cats from the islands, as well as some of the invasive exotic plants.

Visits to the islands are restricted by the Department of Conservation. The department allows visits to Raoul by volunteers assisting in environmental restoration or monitoring projects, and other visitors engaged in nature study. Visits to the other islands are generally restricted to those engaged in scientific study of the islands.

On 29 September 2015, the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key announced the creation of the Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary, a protected area in the Kermadec Islands region. However, subsequently, fishing companies and iwi bodies filed legal action opposing it, and a coalition deal with the New Zealand First Party has led to the Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary Bill not passing its second reading as of 2019. In late March 2024, the Government halted work on the Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary Bill.

In October–November 2016, a collaborative team of researchers from Auckland Museum, University of Auckland, Massey University, NIWA and Te Papa undertook research around Kermadec Islands aboard RV &quot;Tangaroa&quot;. The multi-disciplinary team investigated the biodiversity of organisms living on the ocean floor and at midwater. The marine mammal populations were examined to determine what animal and plant species are shared between mainland New Zealand and the Kermadec region.

<doc id="893075" wikidata="Q332236" url="?curid=893075" title="Alyn McCauley">
<text>Alyn Daniel McCauley (born May 29, 1977) is a former Canadian professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for ten years with the Toronto Maple Leafs, San Jose Sharks, and the Los Angeles Kings. Prior to his NHL career, McCauley was named CHL Player of the Year for 1996–97 while a member of the Ottawa 67&#x27;s. McCauley was born in Brockville, Ontario, but grew up in Gananoque, Ontario. On February 3, 2022, he was named Director of Player Personnel for the Philadelphia Flyers.

==Junior career==
McCauley was a junior hockey superstar with the Ontario Hockey League (OHL)&#x27;s Ottawa 67&#x27;s. At the age of 16, McCauley earned a roster spot with the 67&#x27;s and enjoyed a highly successful four-year career with the club which culminated with his being named CHL Player of the Year for 1996–97. He was also a First Team All-Star in 1996 and 1997 and represented Canada at the 1996 and 1997 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, winning gold medals on both occasions. Prior to these two outstanding seasons in Ottawa, McCauley was selected in the fourth round of the 1995 NHL Entry Draft, 79th overall by the New Jersey Devils, though he would never play with the team. Brian Kilrea, the long-time head coach of the 67&#x27;s, once called McCauley the best player he had ever coached.

Several concussions almost ended McCauley&#x27;s promising career before he had ever played a single NHL game, including one which sidelined him for about half of the 1998–99 season.

==NHL career==
On February 25, 1997, the New Jersey Devils dealt McCauley, along with Jason Smith and Steve Sullivan, to the rebuilding Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for Doug Gilmour, Dave Ellett, and New Jersey&#x27;s 3rd round choice in 1999. McCauley was used primarily as a defensive forward in his rookie season in Toronto and was limited to just six goals and 16 points. Concussion issues continued to plague him as a pro, and these injuries deeply affected his contributions on the ice. By 2000–01, he found himself in the minors with the American Hockey League (AHL)&#x27;s St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs, though he was called up to Toronto for the playoffs.

By the start of 2001–02, McCauley earned a roster spot in Toronto and was a key contributor for the Maple Leafs all season long, managing to stay injury-free. Though no longer the offensive force he had been as a junior player, he had become a solid two-way performer.

On March 5, 2003, Toronto traded McCauley, Brad Boyes, and Toronto&#x27;s first round choice in 2003 to the San Jose Sharks, with power forward Owen Nolan going to Toronto in exchange. The change of scenery seemed to benefit McCauley. In his first full season with the Sharks in 2003–04, he established career highs in goals (20) and points (47). McCauley was known for his two-way play and his penalty-killing abilities, which earned him a Selke Trophy nomination in 2003–04 as the league&#x27;s best defensive forward.

After three seasons in San Jose, McCauley signed as a free agent with the division rival Los Angeles Kings in July 2006. He missed the majority of 2006–07 season recovering from a recurring knee injury, and ultimately played in only 10 games in Los Angeles, scoring one goal.

==Other==
During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, McCauley studied at Athabasca University.

On August 15, 2008, McCauley accepted a position as an assistant coach with the Queen&#x27;s Golden Gaels men&#x27;s hockey team.

McCauley has served as a pro scout for the Los Angeles Kings, with whom he received Stanley Cup rings in 2012 and 2014. From 2018 to 2022, he was a pro scout with the Philadelphia Flyers, and on February 3, 2022, he was named their director of player personnel.

==Awards==
* OHL First All-Star Team (1996, 1997)
* Red Tilson Trophy (OHL MVP) (1996, 1997)
* CHL First All-Star Team (1997)

<text>Robert W. Davison (born May 1, 1980) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former player. A defenceman, Davison played for the San Jose Sharks, New York Islanders, Vancouver Canucks, and New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League (NHL). He is a former assistant coach of the Toronto Marlies, the American Hockey League affiliate of the Toronto Maple Leafs.

==Playing career==
Davison began his junior career in the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League, for the St. Michael&#x27;s Buzzers in 1996-97. The following year, he joined the North Bay Centennials of the major junior Ontario Hockey League. After posting 11 points in 59 games, he was drafted by the San Jose Sharks in the fourth round, 98th overall, in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. Davison returned to North Bay for another two seasons before making his professional debut with the Sharks&#x27; minor league affiliate, the Kentucky Thoroughblades of the American Hockey League in 2000–01.

The following season, the Thoroughblades relocated from Kentucky and became the Cleveland Barons. Davison scored his first professional goal that season, in 2001–02.

In 2002–03, following the trade of defenceman Bryan Marchment, Davison was called up from Cleveland and made his NHL debut with the Sharks. In his third game, he scored his first NHL goal against Martin Gerber in a 3-2 overtime loss to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. Davison finished the season with 3 points in 15 games with San Jose.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Davison played in the UK&#x27;s Elite Ice Hockey League with the Cardiff Devils. He recorded 7 goals (second among team defencemen) and 15 points in 50 games as the Devils finished the season as Challenge Cup runners-up.

When NHL play resumed the following season, in 2005–06, Davison scored a career-high 6 points in 69 games. He remained with the Sharks until February 26, 2008, when he was traded to the New York Islanders in exchange for a seventh round draft pick (Jason Demers) in 2008.

On March 18, 2008, in a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs, Davison scored one of the longest goals in NHL history when a shorthanded clearing attempt from around his own goal line took several bounces along the ice before skipping over the glove of goalie and former Sharks teammate Vesa Toskala and into the net for the Islanders&#x27; lone tally in a 3–1 loss. The 197-foot shot was only Davison&#x27;s third goal in 187 career games.

After one season with the Islanders, he was signed by the Vancouver Canucks to a one-year, $560,000 deal on July 10, 2008, as an unrestricted free agent. Davison was acquired by his former agent Mike Gillis, the newly appointed general manager of the Canucks.

On July 31, 2009, Davison was signed by the New Jersey Devils. Davison played one game for the Devils in the current season, spending most of his time with the AHL&#x27;s Lowell Devils.

After two seasons abroad in Europe with HC Oceláři Třinec and EC Red Bull Salzburg, Davison returned to the San Jose Sharks, his original draft team, on a one-year, two-way contract on July 7, 2013. Davison served as the Captain of the Sharks&#x27; AHL affiliate Worcester Sharks, and on December 31, 2013 against the Adirondack Phantoms, he played his 700th career professional game; 345 were in the AHL, 219 were in the NHL, and 136 were in Europe.

== Coaching career ==
On July 26, 2014, Davison retired to become an assistant coach with EC Red Bull Salzburg. After a two-year stint, and two championships in Salzburg, he left the team at the conclusion of the 2015–16 season and joined the coaching staff of HC Dinamo Minsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) as an assistant.
On July 17, 2017, Davison was appointed assistant coach of the Toronto Marlies, winning the Calder Cup in the 2017–18 season.

<text>Android Lust is the solo project of Shikhee D’iordna, that combines elements of rock, electropop, electro-industrial and classical styles into a blend of music that she describes as &quot;electronic and dark.&quot;

==History==
Shikhee D’iordna was born in Bangladesh, but grew up in England and the USA. In 1999, she moved to New York City.

Prior to 1995, D’iordna was a member of couple of different rock-oriented bands. At the end of 1995 after one of these bands split up, D’iordna sought to begin a new project but gave up on finding compatible bandmates and resumed as a solo project. She was offered a record deal after handing off a demo of her initial work on &quot;Resolution&quot; to Tinman Records. Her initial work was done entirely electronically, and attracted a goth/electropop/electro-industrial following.

After two independent label releases D’iordna released &quot;The Dividing&quot; on her own in 2002, bringing her to the attention of Projekt Records, who signed her and re-released the album. For &quot;The Dividing&quot;, D’iordna added live acoustic instruments to her repertoire, including work by guest musicians Scott Slapin, Lew Del Gatto of the Saturday Night Live band, and Christopher Jon (aka Nurv) of I, Parasite. &quot;Outburn&quot; Magazine called &quot;The Dividing&quot; &quot;unconventional and adventurous - 10 out of 10&quot; while the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; said &quot;The Dividing never misfires; it feels almost - but not quite - slick, its arranging smart, its themes ingenious.&quot; &quot;Jane&quot; Magazine said &quot;The Dividing is filled with intensely passionate lyrics delivered in low whispers and startling, penetrating screaming.&quot; That album involved more live instrumentation, on the album all performed by D’iordna. In the supporting tour she was joined by a live drummer and live keyboardist. She felt that, while dark it was a more optimistic collection than her earlier work, and that her fanbase had become more diversified.

D’iordna&#x27;s third full-length album, &quot;Devour, Rise, and Take Flight&quot;, was released on February 21, 2006. &quot;Dragonfly,&quot; the first single for the album, was released on October 18. The album featured more live instrumentation than &quot;The Dividing&quot;, but embraced a more aggressive electronic sound. This album also saw some creative collaboration with Christopher Jon, Android Lust&#x27;s live drummer, who co-wrote one track with D’iordna, performed on other tracks and helped mix the album. Also in 2006, a video for &quot;Dragonfly,&quot; was directed by New York director Dan Ouellette.

In 2009, D’iordna established her own label, Synthellec Music, to release Android Lust and her other compositions. The first new release on Synthellec Music, &quot;The Human Animal&quot;, was made available at androidlust.com on July 22, 2010, with an official street date of August 10, 2010.

D’iordna&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Crater Vol. 1&quot;, marked a departure from her previous recordings by integrating field recordings into a more atmospheric composition with minimal vocal styling.

Android Lust&#x27;s album, &quot;Berlin // Crater Vol. 2&quot;, was released on August 18, 2017 and, like Volume 1, was financed on Kickstarter.com. The second of the &quot;Crater&quot; series was produced using recordings D’iordna took while visiting Berlin, continuing in the same style as Volume 1.

Following the &quot;Crater&quot; releases, D’iordna self-released an EP, &quot;Shores Unknown&quot;, which included the tracks “Born To Rule” and “Shores Unknown” which appeared on the 2018 video game release Agony.

While never having formed any side projects, D’iordna has contributed vocal work to several other bands including Oneiroid Psychosis, I, Parasite, Signal 12 and others. In 2020, D’iordna collaborated with her longtime friend kaRIN of Collide to record the track &quot;Are You Listening&quot; with an accompanying video directed by Tas Limur.

<doc id="893108" wikidata="Q1992342" url="?curid=893108" title="Nils Ekman">
<text>Nils Karl &quot;Nisse&quot; Ekman (born 11 March 1976) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey right winger. During his 15-year career as a player at the professional level he played in the National Hockey League, Swedish Elite League (SHL), Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), and SM-liiga. He played for the SEL team Djurgårdens IF until he suffered a stroke in December 2010, forcing him to retire from hockey on 10 August 2011.

==Playing career==

===Junior career===
Ekman spent his formative years playing in his native Sweden. In season 1993–94, after scoring four goals and five assists in eleven games for Hammarby IF in the Swedish Junior League, Ekman was called up to the parent team in the Swedish tier 2-league HockeyAllsvenskan, where he scored nine points in 18 games. Catching the eye of the Calgary Flames, he was drafted by the team in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft in the 5th round as the 107th pick overall. In the 1994–95 season, after a short two-game stint in the Swedish junior league, he totalled 10 goals and 7 assists in 29 games for the parent club. After another year in Hammarby, where he scored 9 goals and totalled 7 assists in 26 games, he went to play in Finland.

===Finnish career===
Ekman played a large part of his early years in Finland. In season 1996–97, he played with Kiekko-Espoo of the SM-liiga, scoring 24 goals and adding 19 assists in 50 games. He also added two goals in four playoff games. The next year, his totals declined, as he notched 14 goals with 14 assists in 42 games, causing many to believe he was another European-drafted bust. However, Ekman had a strong playoffs with two goals and two assists in seven games.

Following his team&#x27;s elimination from the playoffs, Ekman signed a contract with Calgary, who were impressed at his development, and Ekman joined the Saint John Flames in the American Hockey League (AHL). However, he did not play in any games and returned to Kiekko-Espoo for the 1998–99 season, notching 34 points in 52 games. He would not return to play in Europe for three years as he left for North America.

===NHL career===
Having no room for him, on 20 November 1999, Calgary traded Ekman to the Tampa Bay Lightning along with a 4th round selection (Vladimir Gorbunov) in the 2000 Entry Draft for Andreas Johansson. He made his debut with the Lightning that season, but scored only 4 points in 28 games. To gain more experience, he joined the IHL and split the 1999–2000 season with the Detroit Vipers and the Long Beach Ice Dogs, notching 32 points in 37 games and earning rookie of the year honors. He also had 6 points in 5 playoff games for Long Beach. During the 2000–01 season, after 36 points in 33 games for Detroit, he was recalled to the NHL, where he improved on his earlier showing and scored 20 points in 43 games. However, he had a very low plus/minus rating of -15.

In the summer of 2001 he was traded to the New York Rangers, but after failing to get a place on the squad he moved back to Sweden and played with Djurgårdens IF in Swedish elite league Elitserien for a season and scored 31 points in 38 games while playing a strong two-way game. Determined to make the NHL, he resigned with the Rangers on July 9, 2002 for the 2002–03 NHL season, but did not make the team and played with the Hartford Wolf Pack in the AHL. Showing how far he had developed, Ekman put up 30 goals and 36 assists in 57 games. However, he was unable to crack the New York lineup because the team preferred to give veterans playing time over youngsters.

On 12 August 2003, Ekman was traded to the San Jose Sharks for Chad Wiseman. A team that had completely flopped the previous season, the Sharks were willing to give the untested Ekman a chance. For the 2003–04 NHL season he posted a career high in goals (22) and had 33 assists, as well as a franchise-record plus 35 rating, negating all doubts about defensive struggles. Still, he had only 3 assists in 16 games for San Jose in the playoffs.

===NHL lockout===
During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Ekman proved that 2004 was no fluke with 18 goals and 27 assists in 44 games for Djurgården. This was the highest total on the team, and fifth-highest in the league (eighth-highest in goals) that had players like Peter Forsberg and Henrik Zetterberg.

===Post-lockout===
Ekman started the 2005–06 NHL season rather slowly coming back from the lockout. In fact in his first 29 games he only scored seven points. However, he started to click on a line with Joe Thornton and Jonathan Cheechoo, and he responded by scoring 29 points in his next 23 games, including a four-game span when he had three four-point games. During this season, he set a new career high for assists and points with 36 and 57 respectively, along with 21 goals in 76 games.

On 20 July 2006, Ekman was traded along with goaltending prospect Patrick Ehelechner to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for a 2007 second-round draft pick. Later in the same year, November 8, he scored a natural hat trick in four minutes and ten seconds in the second period against the Tampa Bay Lightning, setting a Penguins franchise record.

Ekman dislocated his left elbow in a home game win (4-1) against Toronto Maple Leafs on 29 December 2006. He was forced to sit out for three months before he could return to the ice and made his comeback against the Ottawa Senators on March 6 and had four penalty minutes and -1, logging nearly 8 minutes of ice time.

For season 2007–08, Ekman moved to Russia for play with Khimik Moscow Oblast in the Russian Super League. Next season, he signed with SKA Saint Petersburg in the newly formed Kontinental Hockey League.

After two seasons with the St. Petersburg-based club, scoring 21 goals and 62 points in 83 games, Ekman signed a three-year deal with his former club Djurgården in May 2010.

=== Retirement ===
In what would be his final season, Ekman played 20 games, scoring 4 goals and 9 points before suffering a stroke in late December 2010. Ekman was hospitalized until 14 March 2011, when he was discharged and missed the remaining games of the 2010–11 Elitserien season. Subsequently, Ekman announced his retirement on 10 August 2011, at the age of 35 when neurologists of Karolinska University Hospital said it would not be safe to resume playing hockey. One year after the stroke Ekman participated in Vasaloppet to provide attention to the Swedish Stroke Association. He crossed the finish line after 08:56:00 (8 h, 56 min).

<text>Castle Cary () is a market town and civil parish in south Somerset, England, north west of Wincanton and south of Shepton Mallet, at the foot of Lodge Hill and on the River Cary, a tributary of the Parrett.

==History==

The word Cary derives from the Celtic &quot;caer&quot; meaning rock, crag or castle, making the term Castle Cary a double-play. Castle Cary is said to take half its name from River Cary, itself an aporia.

The first Cary Castle was besieged in 1138 and again in 1152. It was originally made with a timber frame, as it would have been built by the Normans, and inherited their building traditions in wood. Cary first appears in recorded history after the Norman Conquest in 1066, though according to a Castle Cary history there is evidence the site was occupied and fortified before this. The second castle was abandoned by the mid-15th century in favour of a manor house, and the stones pillaged for other buildings in the town.

It would seem that the second castle was begun in the 13th century around 1250 and built in Cary stone, indicating that the Hadspen Quarry was in operation at this time. It suggests the Church of All Saints, Castle Cary was begun at a similar time and completed over centuries.

==Castle Cary Manor==

Castle Cary Manor was given to the Lovels by King Stephen of Blois, who reigned from 22 December 1135 to 25 October 1154 (18 years 308 days). The castle was besieged by King Stephen of Blois in 1138 in his struggle for the throne of England with his cousin Matilda. When the Lovels failed to produce a male heir during the reign of King Edward III, it passed through marriage to Nicholas de S. Maure, a Baron. It passed again through female heir during the time of King Henry V to Lord Zouches of Harringworth. King Henry VII attainting John Lord Zouch gave the Castle to Robert Willoughby Lord Brook and Lord Zouch&#x27;s lands at Bridge-water to Lord Daubney. The Zouches had backed King Richard III, the wrong side of the struggle between Richard III and the Tudors.

Castle Cary was granted a formal market charter in 1468 from Edward V. It developed as a market town with a number of rural industries, wool flourishing. The Greene King George Hotel is said to have been constructed around this time, rebuilt after a fire and the Market House from Cary stone 150 years later, 1616. Cary flourished in the 16th century, as indicated by its muster roll when threatened by Spanish invasion late in the century. By 1700 Castle Cary was known for its cloth production, when linen weaving replaced wool at the end of the century. In 1837 John Boyd began making horse-hair textiles, for which he is still renowned today and produces on the original 1870 looms. The diary of Reverend James Woodforde born in Ansford in 1740 provides an insight into 18th century life in the Parish.

The manor was bought in the 1780s by the Hoares of Stourhead in Wiltshire. In 1785 Henry Hobhouse Esquire purchased Hadspen and Hadspen House as the Hobhouse family seat. In the 18th century Castle Cary changed. The Donnes established flax mills making twine, sail cloth, webbing still situated today in the 1877 Florida House. In 1837 the Cricket Club was founded winning the first and only Olympic medal in 1900, though the possibility of it being contested at the Olympics again has resurfaced. The Market House was rebuilt in 1855 in anticipation of increased trade influenced by the railway station. Today the Castle Cary station today is known as the main station to the Glastonbury Festival. In recent years the town has expanded northwards the centre changing little.

Its change starting in the late 18th century was due to the investments of the Hoares and the purchase of Hadpsen and Hadpsen House by Henry Hobhouse Esquire, once part of Castle Cary Manor. Henry Hobhouse Esquire made significant investments in Castle Cary Manor. Castle Cary now comprises a significant part of Hadspen.

On 19 June 2004, Castle Cary was granted Fairtrade Village status.

==Governance==
The town is in the Castle Cary electoral division, which elects two councillors to Somerset Council. The electoral division is much larger than the town itself, including several neighbouring parishes to the southwest of the town. Castle Cary also has a Town Council with responsibility for some local issues.

The town was formerly part of South Somerset district from 1974 to 2023, and part of Wincanton Rural District from 1894 to 1974.

It is also part of the Glastonbury and Somerton constituency represented in the House of Commons.

==Transport==
Castle Cary railway station is on the main Reading to Taunton line and the Heart of Wessex line. It is about north of the town. Every year around the time of the summer solstice this railway station is used by thousands of festival goers who travel to nearby Worthy Farm for the Glastonbury Festival (about 7 miles from Glastonbury) – a parade of free buses and coaches take ticket holders to and from the festival site.

Bus services operate from the town to Yeovil, Shepton Mallet, Street and Wincanton.

The town is on the Monarch&#x27;s Way long-distance footpath.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Somerset, Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West, and Radio Ninesprings, a community based station which broadcast to the town. The town is served by the local newspaper, Western Gazette which publishes Thursdays.

==Landmarks==
Attractions in Castle Cary include a small circular eighteenth-century prison called the roundhouse. This is a temporary prison, or village lock-up. It was built in 1779 by Mr WM Clark for £23, from money left to the poor of Castle Cary in 1605. The structure is circular, stone and has a domed roof. It is in diameter and high with two iron grills for ventilation. The building has an inner and outer door. The interior of the building has a single stone privy. In 1992, the Lord of the Manor, Sir Henry Hoare Bt., gave the building to the parish council.

The Market House is a grade II* listed building built in 1855 in anticipation of increased trade after the projected arrival of the railway in 1856, to a design by Francis Penrose. It replaced the former house on the site which had stood since 1616, and incorporating some features from the earlier building. The market house contains the local Castle Cary and District Museum. There is a varied collection of exhibits spread over the two floors of the building. The earliest are local fossils including ammonites and a display about the discovery of an ichthyosaurus at Alford. Local industry and agriculture are represented with displays on the production of rope and hemp and a collection of agricultural implements, tools and relics. A room is dedicated to the life and work of Parson James Woodforde who was born at the Parsonage in nearby Ansford in 1740. He was later curate at Thurloxton before moving to Norfolk. For nearly 45 years he kept a diary recording an existence the very ordinariness of which provides a unique insight into the everyday routines and concerns of 18th century rural England.

Hadspen House is Grade II* Listed manor house outside the town. The original farmhouse was built by William Player between 1687 and 1689; the Hobhouse family acquired the house in 1785 and have owned it ever since. The gardens were restored by the garden writer and designer Penelope Hobhouse in the late 1960s.

The Grade II* listed Top Mill Building at Higher Flax Mills which was built in the 19th century is on the Heritage at Risk Register.

==Religious sites==

The largest church in the town is All Saints&#x27;, which dates from 1470 and is notable for its high steeple, which contains six bells dating from 1760 and made by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. The Cosenes monument in the churchyard, which dates from the 16th century, is on the Heritage at Risk Register.

There is also a Methodist church and St Andrew&#x27;s in the neighbouring parish of Ansford.

==Notable residents==
Notable people from the town include:
*James Woodforde the 18th-century diarist who was curate between 1765 and 1775
*Douglas Macmillan, founder of the Macmillan Cancer Relief charity. The Macmillan Way walking trail passes through the town
*Jane Wallas Penfold (1820-1884) author of &quot;Madeira: Flowers, Fruits and Ferns&quot; (1845)

==Education==

The town has a primary and a secondary school. Castle Cary Community Primary School dates from 1840, whereas Ansford Academy built in 1940 with additional rooms for science, technology, mathematics and modern languages being added in the 1970s. A new £1.7 million Sports Centre was completed in 2005.

<text>Schematic capture or schematic entry is a step in the design cycle of electronic design automation (EDA) at which the electronic diagram, or electronic schematic of the designed electronic circuit, is created by a designer. This is done interactively with the help of a schematic capture tool also known as schematic editor.

The circuit design is the first step of actual design of an electronic circuit. Typically sketches are drawn on paper, and then entered into a computer using a schematic editor. Therefore schematic entry is said to be a front-end operation of several others in the design flow.

Despite the complexity of modern components – huge ball grid arrays and tiny passive components – schematic capture is easier today than it has been for many years. CAD software is easier to use and is available in full-featured expensive packages, very capable mid-range packages that sometimes have free versions and completely free versions that are either open source or directly linked to a printed circuit board fabrication company.

In past years, schematic diagrams with mostly discrete components were fairly readable. However, with the newer high pin-count parts and with the almost universal use of standard letter- or A4-sized paper, schematics have become less so. Many times, there will be a single large part on a page with nothing but pin reference keys to connect it to other pages.

Readability levels can be enhanced by using buses and superbuses, related pins can be connected into a common bus and routed to other pages. Buses don&#x27;t need to be just the traditional address or data bus directly linked pins. A bus grouping can also be used for related uses, such as all analog input or all communications related pin functions.

==Other considerations==
After the circuit design is captured in a schematic, most EDA tools allow the design to be simulated.

Schematic capture involves not only entering the circuits into the CAD system, but also generally calls for decisions that may seem more appropriate for later in the design, such as package choice. Although you may be able to change the package later, many PCB CAD systems ask you to choose both the part and package when placing it into the schematic capture program.

This also brings into play such considerations as prototyping and assembly. In a high-volume assembly environment, there will be plenty of opportunities for DFM analysis. However, in a rapid prototyping environment such as at assembly houses specializing in low-volume/high-mix and quick turnaround times, the pick and place machines are programmed directly from the board layout files. Careful package selection during schematic capture will save time during the assembly and debug process.

With new parts, the CAD system may not have your chosen component in its parts library, so you may need to create the parts library yourself. Again, you may at the time not be overly concerned with the package, but careful creation of the part library will save time and risk later.

<text>A schematic editor is a tool for schematic capture of electrical circuits or electronic circuits.

Schematic editors replaced manual drawing of schematic diagrams, but they still retain the capability of outputting schematics on specially formatted sheets. At the same time modern schematic editors capture schematic data in a way suited for automatic processing by further stages of the design cycle.

Besides basic drawing and visualization capabilities, modern schematic editors typically provide the following capabilities:
* Capture electrical properties and other attributes of components, wires, nets and pins.
* Hierarchical way of design.
* Generate netlists and other common representations of the designed circuit from schematic.
* Generate documentation.
* Generate Gerber files to CAM.
* Libraries of standard components.
* Automatically detect and report errors in the schematic.
* Input designs from various formats, such as VHDL, Verilog, EDIF.
They are also used for prototyping and test circuits before create them in real life.

<text>The Polish Academy of Sciences (, PAN) is a Polish state-sponsored institution of higher learning. Headquartered in Warsaw, it is responsible for spearheading the development of science across the country by a society of distinguished scholars and a network of research institutes. It was established in 1951, during the early period of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic following World War II.

==History==
The Polish Academy of Sciences is a Polish state-sponsored institution of higher learning, headquartered in Warsaw, that was established by the merger of earlier science societies, including the Polish Academy of Learning (&quot;Polska Akademia Umiejętności&quot;, abbreviated &quot;PAU&quot;), with its seat in Kraków, and the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning (Science), which had been founded in the late 18th century.

The Polish Academy of Sciences functions as a learned society acting through an elected assembly of leading scholars and research institutions. The Academy has also, operating through its committees, become a major scientific advisory body. Another aspect of the Academy is its coordination and overseeing of numerous (several dozen) research institutes. PAN institutes employ over 2,000 people and are funded by about a third of the Polish government&#x27;s budget for science.

==Leadership==
The Polish Academy of Sciences is led by a President, elected by the assembly of Academy members for a four-year term, together with a number of Vice Presidents.

The President for the 2019–2022 term was Jerzy Duszyński (his second term in the post), together with five Vice Presidents: Stanisław Czuczwar, Stanisław Filipowicz, Paweł Rowiński, Roman Słowiński, and Romuald Zabielski.

On 20 October 2022, General Assembly of the Polish Academy of Sciences elected Marek Konarzewski to become the new President of the Academy for the 2023–2026 term. On 8 December 2022, another session of General Assembly of the Academy elected four Vice Presidents at the recommendation of the President Elect; as such Mirosława Ostrowska, Natalia Sobczak, and Dariusz Jemielniak, and Aleksander Welfe were elected as Vice Presidents of the Academy for the 2023–2026 term. 

All the Presidents of the Polish Academy of Sciences to date, by term, are as follows:

*1952–1956: Jan Bohdan Dembowski
*1957–1962: Tadeusz Kotarbiński
*1962–1971: Janusz Groszkowski
*1971–1977: Włodzimierz Trzebiatowski
*1977–1980: Witold Nowacki
*1980–1983: Aleksander Gieysztor
*1984–1990: Jan Karol Kostrzewski
*1990–1992: Aleksander Gieysztor

<doc id="893141" wikidata="Q1458155" url="?curid=893141" title="Sicilian Mafia">
<text>The Sicilian Mafia or Cosa Nostra (, ; &quot;our thing&quot;), also referred to as simply Mafia, is a criminal society and criminal organization originating on the island of Sicily and dates back to the mid-19th century. It is an association of gangs which sell their protection and arbitration services under a common brand. The Mafia&#x27;s core activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions.

The basic group is known as a &quot;family&quot;, &quot;clan&quot;, or &quot;cosca&quot;. Each family claims sovereignty over a territory, usually a town, village or neighborhood (&quot;borgata&quot;) of a larger city, in which it operates its rackets. Its members call themselves &quot;men of honour&quot;, although the public often refers to them as &quot;mafiosi&quot;. By the 20th century, wide-scale emigration from Sicily led to the formation of mafiosi style gangs in Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, and South America. These diaspora-based outfits replicated the traditions and methods of their Sicilian ancestors to varying extents.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;mafia&quot; originated in Sicily. The Sicilian noun &quot;mafiusu&quot; (in Italian: &quot;mafioso&quot;) roughly translates to mean &quot;&quot;, but can also be translated as &quot;boldness, &quot;. In reference to a man, &quot;mafiusu&quot; in 19th-century Sicily was ambiguous, signifying a bully, arrogant but also fearless, enterprising and proud, according to scholar Diego Gambetta. In reference to a woman, however, the feminine-form, &quot;mafiusa&quot;, means a beautiful or attractive female. The Sicilian word &quot;mafie&quot; refers to the caves near Trapani and Marsala, which were often used as hiding places for refugees and criminals.

Sicily was once an Islamic emirate, therefore &quot;mafia&quot; might have Arabic roots. Possible Arabic roots of the word include:
*&quot;maʿafī&quot; (): exempted. In Islamic law, jizya is the yearly tax imposed on non-Muslims residing in Muslim lands. Those who pay it are &quot;exempted&quot; from prosecution.
*&quot;mahyāṣ&quot; (): aggressive boasting, bragging
*&quot;marfūḍ&quot; (): rejected
*&quot;muʿāfā&quot; (): safety, protection
*&quot;Maʿāfir&quot; (): the name of an Arab tribe that ruled Palermo

The public&#x27;s association of the word with the criminal secret society was perhaps inspired by the 1863 play &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Mafiosi of the Vicaria&quot;) by Giuseppe Rizzotto and Gaspare Mosca. The words &quot;mafia&quot; and &quot;mafiusi&quot; are never mentioned in the play. The drama is about a Palermo prison gang with traits similar to the Mafia: a boss, an initiation ritual, and talk of &quot;umirtà&quot; (omertà or code of silence) and &quot;pizzu&quot; (a codeword for extortion money). The play had great success throughout Italy. Soon after, the use of the term &quot;mafia&quot; began appearing in the Italian state&#x27;s early reports on the group. The word was first documented in 1865 in a report by the prefect of .

The term &quot;mafia&quot; has become a generic term for any organized criminal network with similar structure, methods, and interests. But Giovanni Falcone, an Italian judge who was murdered by the Mafia in 1992, had objected to the conflation of the term &quot;Mafia&quot; with organized crime in general:

According to Mafia turncoats (&quot;pentiti&quot;), the real name of the Mafia is &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; (&quot;Our Thing&quot;). Italian American mafioso Joseph Valachi testified before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations in 1963 (at what are known as the Valachi hearings). He revealed that American mafiosi referred to their organization by the term &quot;cosa nostra&quot; (&quot;our thing&quot; or &quot;this thing of ours&quot; or simply &quot;our cause&quot; / &quot;our interest&quot;). At the time, &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; was understood as a proper name, fostered by the FBI and disseminated by the media. The FBI added the article &quot;la&quot; to the term, calling it &quot;La Cosa Nostra&quot; (in Italy, the article &quot;la&quot; is not used when referring to &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot;).

In 1984, Mafia turncoat Tommaso Buscetta revealed to anti-mafia Italian magistrate Giovanni Falcone that the term was used by the Sicilian Mafia, as well. Buscetta dismissed the word &quot;mafia&quot; as a mere literary creation. Other defectors, such as Antonino Calderone and Salvatore Contorno, confirmed the use of &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; by members. Mafiosi introduce known members to each other as belonging to &quot;cosa nostra&quot; (&quot;our thing&quot;) or &quot;la stessa cosa&quot; (&quot;the same thing&quot;), meaning &quot;he is the same thing as you – a mafioso.&quot;

The Sicilian Mafia has used other names to describe itself throughout its history, such as &quot;The Honored Society&quot;. Mafiosi are known among themselves as &quot;men of honor&quot; or &quot;men of respect&quot;.

&quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; should not be confused with other mafia-type organizations in Southern Italy, such as the &#x27;Ndrangheta in Calabria, the Camorra in Campania, or the Sacra Corona Unita and Società foggiana in Apulia.

==Overview==
In 1876, Leopoldo Franchetti described the Sicilian Mafia as an &quot;industry of violence&quot;. In 1993, the Italian sociologist Diego Gambetta described it as a cartel of private protection firms. He further characterized mafiosi as &quot;guarantors of trust&quot;, and that Sicilian people tend to be distrustful of each other and therefore routinely seek mafia protection in their business dealings. The central activity of the Mafia is the arbitration of disputes between criminals and the organization and the enforcement of illicit agreements through the use of violence. The Mafia does not serve the general public as the police do, but only specific clients who pay them for protection.

The Sicilian Mafia is not a centralized organization. It is more of an association of independent gangs who sell their services under a common brand. This cartel claims the exclusive right to sell extralegal protection services within their territories, and by their labels (&quot;man of honor&quot;, &quot;mafioso&quot;, etc.), they distinguish themselves from common criminals whom they exclude from the protection market.

Franchetti argued that the Mafia would never disappear unless the very structure of the island&#x27;s social institutions were to undergo a fundamental change. Over a century later, Diego Gambetta concurred with Franchetti&#x27;s analysis, arguing that the Mafia exists because the government does not provide adequate protection to merchants from property crime, fraud, and breaches of contract. Gambetta wrote that Sicily (in the early 1990s) had &quot;no clear property rights legislation or administrative or financial codes of practice&quot;, and that its court system was &quot;appalling&quot; in its inefficiency. Gambetta recommended that the government liberalize the drug market and abolish price-fixing of cigarettes so as to move these commodities out of the black market; to increase transparency in public contracting so that there can be no rigging, which mafiosi usually arbitrate; and redesign the voting process to make it harder to buy votes. Fixing these problems would reduce the demand for mafioso intervention in political and economic affairs.

===Cultural aspects===
Until the 1980s, leading social scientists like and Anton Blok that conducted the first field studies on the phenomenon between the 1960s and the early 1980s, saw the Mafia as merely a form of behaviour and power, downplaying its organisational aspects. Their thinking was shaped by &quot;sicilianismo&quot;, a late 19th-century movement opposed to the indiscriminate criminalization of all Sicilians by Italian law enforcement and public opinion, promoted in particular by the Sicilian ethnographer Giuseppe Pitrè. According to the &quot;sicilianisti&quot;, the term &#x27;mafia&#x27; simply embodied an attitude, a mentality deeply rooted in the island&#x27;s popular culture; an expression of the local traditional society&#x27;s fundamental rejection of the foreign invaders who had ruled Sicily for centuries. &quot;Mafia&quot; was a &quot;way of being&quot;, according to a definition by Pitrè:

Other scholars such as Gaetano Mosca say:
Like Pitrè, some scholars viewed mafiosi as individuals behaving according to specific subcultural codes, but did not consider the Mafia a formal organisation. Judicial investigations by Falcone and scientific research in the 1980s provided solid proof of the existence of well-structured Mafia groups with entrepreneurial characteristics. Pino Arlacchi, in his seminal 1983 study &quot;La mafia imprenditrice&quot; (Mafia Business), summarised the dominant way of looking at the mafia up to that point by writing, “Social research into the question of the mafia has probably now reached the point where we can say that the mafia, as the term is commonly understood, does not exist”. Arlacchi contested that view, and stressed the economical aspects of the Mafia as a criminal organization. The Mafia was seen as an enterprise, and its economic activities became the focus of academic analyses. 
However, by ignoring the cultural aspects, according to historian Salvatore Lupo, the Mafia is often erroneously seen as similar to other non-Sicilian organized criminal associations. These two paradigms missed essential aspects of the Mafia that became clear when investigators were confronted with the testimonies of Mafia turncoats, like those of Buscetta to Judge Falcone at the Maxi Trial. The economic approach to explain the Mafia did illustrate the development and operations of the Mafia business, but neglected the cultural symbols and codes by which the Mafia legitimized its existence and by which it rooted itself into Sicilian society. 
According to Lupo, there are several lines of interpretation, often blended to some extent, to define the Mafia: it has been viewed as a mirror of traditional Sicilian society; as an enterprise or type of criminal industry; as a more or less centralized secret society; and as a juridical ordering that is parallel to that of the state – a kind of anti-state. The Mafia is all of these but none of these exclusively.

Diego Gambetta characterizes mafiosi as &quot;guarantors of trust&quot;. He says that Sicilian society has a general lack of trust among its people. This is true for other parts of southern Italy, which never experienced the same post-war economic growth that northern and central Italy enjoyed due in part to a lack of cooperation and healthy competition among the locals. The Mafia may provide a sense of security to those who pay it for protection, but the Mafia actually increases the general amount of distrust in Sicilian society. Those who are under mafia protection have an incentive to cheat those who are not under protection. The Mafia fosters crime by making it safer for criminals to engage in illegal dealings with each other (criminals are the Mafia&#x27;s most important clients because they can&#x27;t get protection from the legal system). And since mafiosi charge fees for their services, they increase transaction costs, which in turn leads to a higher cost of living for average Sicilians.
==Mafia-type organizations under Italian law==
Introduced in 1982 by Pio La Torre, article 416-bis of the Italian Penal Code defines a Mafia-type association (&quot;associazione di tipo mafioso&quot;) as one where &quot;those belonging to the association exploit the potential for intimidation which their membership gives them, and the compliance and omertà which membership entails and which lead to the committing of crimes, the direct or indirect assumption of management or control of financial activities, concessions, permissions, enterprises and public services for the purpose of deriving profit or wrongful advantages for themselves or others&quot;.

==History==
Historian John Dickie stated that the genesis of &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; is hard to trace because mafiosi are very secretive and do not keep historical records of their own. He added that they have been known to spread deliberate lies about their past and sometimes to believe in their own myths.

===Post-feudal Sicily===
The Mafia&#x27;s genesis began in the 19th century as the product of Sicily&#x27;s transition from feudalism to capitalism as well as its unification with mainland Italy. Under feudalism, the nobility owned most of the land and enforced the law through their private armies and manorial courts. After 1812, the feudal barons steadily sold off or rented their lands to private citizens. Primogeniture was abolished, land could no longer be seized to settle debts, and one fifth of the land became private property of the peasants. After Italy annexed Sicily in 1860, it redistributed a large share of public and church land to private citizens. The result was a huge increase in the number of landowners – from 2,000 in 1812 to 20,000 by 1861.

With this increase in property owners and commerce came more disputes that needed settling, contracts that needed enforcing, transactions that needed oversight, and properties that needed protecting. The barons released their private armies to let the state take over the job of enforcing the law, but the new authorities were not up to the task, largely due to clashes between official law and local customs. Lack of manpower was also a problem; there were often fewer than 350 active policemen for the entire island. Some towns did not have any permanent police force, and were only visited every few months by some troops to collect malcontents, leaving criminals to operate with impunity in the interim. Compounding these problems was banditry. Rising food prices, the loss of public and church lands, and the loss of feudal commons pushed many desperate peasants to steal. In the face of rising crime, booming commerce, and unreliable law enforcement, property owners and merchants turned to extralegal arbitrators and protectors. These extralegal protectors eventually organized themselves into the first Mafia clans.

In countryside towns that lacked formal constabulary, local elites responded to banditry by recruiting young men into &quot;companies-at-arms&quot; to hunt down thieves and negotiate the return of stolen property, in exchange for a pardon for the thieves and a fee from the victims. These companies-at-arms were often made up of former bandits and criminals, usually the most skilled and violent of them. This saved communities the trouble of training their own policemen, but it may have made the companies-at-arms more inclined to collude with their former brethren rather than destroy them. Scholars such as Salvatore Lupo have identified these groups as &quot;proto-Mafia&quot;.
The Mafia was (and still is) a largely western Sicilian phenomenon. There was little Mafia activity in the eastern half of Sicily. This did not mean that there was little violence; the most violent conflicts over land took place in the east, but they did not involve mafiosi. In the east, the ruling elites were more cohesive and active during the transition from feudalism to capitalism. They maintained their large stables of enforcers and were able to absorb or suppress any emerging violent groups. Furthermore, the land in the east was generally divided into a smaller number of large estates so that there were fewer landowners, and their large estates often required its guardians to patrol it full-time. The owners of such estates needed to hire full-time guardians.

By contrast, in the west, the estates tended to be smaller and thus did not require the total, round-the-clock attention of a guardian. It was cheaper for these estates to contract their protection to a mafioso rather than employing full-time guards. A mafioso in these regions could protect multiple small estates at once, which gave him great independence and leverage to charge high prices. The landowners in this region were also frequently absent and could not watch over their properties should the protector withdraw, further increasing his bargaining power.

The early Mafia was deeply involved with citrus growers and cattle ranchers, as these industries were particularly vulnerable to thieves and vandals and thus badly needed protection. Citrus plantations had a fragile production system that made them quite vulnerable to sabotage. Likewise, cattle are very easy to steal. The Mafia was often more effective than the police at recovering stolen cattle; in the 1920s, it was noted that the Mafia&#x27;s success rate at recovering stolen cattle was 95%, whereas the police managed only 10%.

In 1864, Niccolò Turrisi Colonna, leader of the Palermo National Guard, wrote of a &quot;sect of thieves&quot; that operated throughout Sicily. This &quot;sect&quot; was mostly rural, composed of cattle thieves, smugglers, wealthy farmers, and their guards. The sect made &quot;affiliates every day of the brightest young people coming from the rural class, of the guardians of the fields in the Palermitan countryside, and of the large number of smugglers; a sect which gives and receives protection to and from certain men who make a living on traffic and internal commerce. It is a sect with little or no fear of public bodies, because its members believe that they can easily elude this.&quot; It had special signals for members to recognize each other, offered protection services, scorned the law, and had a code of loyalty and non-interaction with the police known as &quot;umirtà&quot; (&quot;code of silence&quot;). Colonna warned in his report that the Italian government&#x27;s brutal and clumsy attempts to crush crime only made the problem worse by alienating the populace. An 1865 dispatch from the prefect of Palermo to Rome first officially described the phenomenon as a &quot;Mafia&quot;. An 1876 police report provides the earliest known description of the familiar initiation ritual.

Mafiosi meddled in politics early on, bullying voters into voting for candidates they favored. At this period in history, only a small fraction of the Sicilian population could vote, so a single mafia boss could control a sizable chunk of the electorate and thus wield considerable political leverage. Mafiosi used their allies in government to avoid prosecution as well as persecute less well-connected rivals. Given the highly fragmented and shaky Italian political system, cliques of Mafia-friendly politicians exerted a strong influence.

In a series of reports between 1898 and 1900, Ermanno Sangiorgi, the police chief of Palermo, identified 670 mafiosi belonging to eight Mafia clans, which went through alternating phases of cooperation and conflict. The report mentioned initiation rituals and codes of conduct, as well as criminal activities that included counterfeiting, kidnappings for ransom, murder, robbery, and witness intimidation. The Mafia also maintained funds to support the families of imprisoned members and pay defense lawyers. In an attempt to annihilate the Mafia, Italian troops arrested 64 people of Palermo in February 1898. The trial began in May 1901, but after one month, only 32 defendants were found guilty of starting a criminal association and, taking into account the time already spent in prison, many were released the next day.

A 2015 study in &quot;The Economic Journal&quot; attributed the emergence of the Sicilian Mafia to the resource curse. Early Mafia activity was strongly linked to Sicilian municipalities abundant in sulfur, Sicily&#x27;s most valuable export commodity. The combination of a weak state and a lootable natural resource made the sulfur-rich parts of Sicily vulnerable to the emergence of mafia-type organizations. A valuable natural resource in areas where law enforcement is weak or absent creates a demand for private protection (which mafia-type organizations can supply) and opportunities for extortion (also by mafia-type organizations). A 2017 study in the &quot;Journal of Economic History&quot; links the emergence of the Sicilian Mafia also to the surging demand for oranges and lemons following the late 18th-century discovery that citrus fruits cured scurvy. A 2019 study in the &quot;Review of Economic Studies&quot; linked Mafia activity to &quot;the rise of socialist Peasant Fasci organizations. In an environment with weak state presence, this socialist threat triggered landowners, estate managers, and local politicians to turn to the Mafia to resist and combat peasant demands.&quot;

===Fascist suppression===
In 1925, Benito Mussolini initiated a campaign to destroy the Mafia and assert Fascist control over Sicilian life. The Mafia threatened and undermined his power in Sicily, and a successful campaign would strengthen him as the new leader, legitimizing and empowering his rule. He believed that such suppression would be a great propaganda coup for fascism, and it would also provide an excuse to suppress his political opponents on the island since many Sicilian politicians had Mafia links.

As prime minister, Mussolini visited Sicily in May 1924 and passed through Piana dei Greci, where he was received by mayor/Mafia boss Francesco Cuccia. At some point, Cuccia expressed surprise at Mussolini&#x27;s police escort and whispered in his ear: &quot;You are with me, you are under my protection. What do you need all these cops for?&quot;. After Mussolini rejected Cuccia&#x27;s offer of protection, the &quot;sindaco&quot; felt that he had been slighted and instructed the townsfolk not to attend the &quot;duce&quot;″s speech. Mussolini felt humiliated and outraged.

Cuccia&#x27;s careless remark has passed into history as the catalyst for Mussolini&#x27;s war on the Mafia. Mussolini firmly established his power in January 1925; he appointed Cesare Mori as the Prefect of Palermo in October 1925 and granted him special powers to fight the Mafia. Mori formed a small army of policemen, carabinieri and militiamen, which went from town to town rounding up suspects. To force suspects to surrender, they would take their families hostage, sell off their property, or publicly slaughter their livestock. By 1928, more than 11,000 suspects were arrested. Confessions were sometimes extracted through beatings and torture. Some mafiosi who had been on the losing end of Mafia feuds voluntarily cooperated with prosecutors, perhaps as a way of obtaining protection and revenge. Charges of Mafia association were typically leveled at poor peasants and &quot;gabellotti&quot; (farm leaseholders), but were avoided when dealing with major landowners. Many were tried &quot;en masse&quot;. More than 1,200 were convicted and imprisoned, and many others were internally exiled without trial.

Mori&#x27;s campaign ended in June 1929 when Mussolini recalled him to Rome. He did not permanently crush the Mafia as the Fascist press proclaimed, but his campaign was very successful at suppressing it.

Sicily&#x27;s murder rate sharply declined. Landowners were able to raise the legal rents on their lands, sometimes as much as ten-thousandfold.

===Post-Fascist revival===
In 1943, nearly half a million Allied troops invaded Sicily. Crime soared in the upheaval and chaos. Many inmates escaped from prisons, banditry returned, and the black market thrived. During the first six months of Allied occupation, party politics were banned in Sicily. Most institutions were destroyed, with the exception of the police and carabinieri, and the American occupiers had to build a new order from scratch. As Fascist mayors were deposed, the Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories (AMGOT) simply appointed replacements. Many turned out to be mafiosi, such as Calogero Vizzini and Giuseppe Genco Russo. They could easily present themselves as political dissidents, and their anti-communist position gave them additional credibility. Mafia bosses reformed their clans, absorbing some of the marauding bandits into their ranks.

The changing economic landscape of Sicily shifted the Mafia&#x27;s power base from rural to urban areas. The Minister of Agriculture – a communist – pushed for reforms in which peasants were to get larger shares of produce, be allowed to form cooperatives and take over badly used land, and remove the system by which leaseholders (known as &quot;gabellotti&quot;) could rent land from landowners for their own short-term use. Owners of especially large estates were to be forced to sell off some of their land. The Mafia had connections to many landowners and murdered many socialist reformers. The most notorious attack was the Portella della Ginestra massacre, when 11 people were killed and 33 wounded during May Day celebrations on May 1, 1947. The bloodbath was perpetrated by bandit Salvatore Giuliano, who was possibly backed by local Mafia bosses. In the end, though, they were unable to stop the process, and many landowners chose to sell their land to mafiosi, who offered more money than the government.

In the 1950s, a crackdown in the United States on drug trafficking led to the imprisonment of many American mafiosi. Cuba, a major hub for drug smuggling, was taken over by Fidel Castro and associated communists. In 1957 American mafia boss Joseph Bonanno returned to Sicily to franchise his heroin operations to the Sicilian clans. Anticipating rivalries for the lucrative American drug market, he negotiated the establishment of a Sicilian Mafia Commission to mediate disputes.

===Sack of Palermo===
The post-war period saw a huge building boom in Palermo. Allied bombing in World War II had left more than 14,000 people homeless, and migrants were pouring in from the countryside, so there was a huge demand for new homes. Much of this construction was subsidized by public money. In 1956, two Mafia-connected officials, Vito Ciancimino and Salvatore Lima, took control of Palermo&#x27;s Office of Public Works. Between 1959 and 1963, about 80 percent of building permits were given to just five people, none of whom represented major construction firms; they were likely Mafia frontmen. Construction companies unconnected with the Mafia were forced to pay protection money. Many buildings were illegally constructed before the city&#x27;s planning was finalized. Mafiosi scared off anyone who dared to question the illegal building. The result of this unregulated building was the demolition of many historic buildings and the erection of apartment blocks, many of which were not up to standard.

During the 1950s, the Mafia continued its deep penetration of the construction and cement industries. The cement business was appealing because it allows high levels of local economic involvement and is a good front for illegitimate operations.

===First Mafia War===

The First Mafia War was the first high-profile conflict between Mafia clans in post-war Italy (the Sicilian Mafia has a long history of violent rivalries).

In 1962, mafia boss Cesare Manzella organized a drug shipment to the United States with the help of two Sicilian clans, the Grecos and the La Barberas. Manzella entrusted another boss, Calcedonio Di Pisa, to handle the heroin. When the shipment arrived in the United States, however, the American buyers claimed that some heroin was missing, and paid Di Pisa a commensurately lower sum. Di Pisa accused the Americans of defrauding him, while the La Barberas accused Di Pisa of embezzling the missing heroin. The Sicilian Mafia Commission sided with Di Pisa, and the La Barberas were outraged. The La Barberas murdered Di Pisa and Manzella, triggering a war.

Many non-mafiosi were killed in the crossfire. In April 1963, several bystanders were wounded during a shootout in Palermo. In May, Angelo La Barbera survived a murder attempt in Milan. In June, six military officers and a policeman in Ciaculli were killed while trying to dispose of a car bomb. These incidents provoked national outrage and a crackdown in which nearly 2,000 arrests were made. Mafia activity fell as clans disbanded and mafiosi went into hiding. The Sicilian Mafia Commission was dissolved; it did not re-form until 1969. A total of 117 suspects were tried in 1968, but most were acquitted or received light sentences. The inactivity, plus money lost to legal fees and so forth, reduced most mafiosi to poverty. The Mafia families in Palermo were particularly hit hard, and ceased activity altogether in that city for a few years until the conclusion of the trials in 1968 allowed them to reorganize.

===Smuggling boom===
The 1950s and 1960s were difficult times for the mafia, but in the 1970s their rackets grew considerably more lucrative, particularly smuggling. The most lucrative racket of the 1970s was cigarette smuggling. Sicilian and Neapolitan crime bosses negotiated a joint monopoly over the smuggling of cigarettes to Naples.

Heroin refineries operated by Corsican gangsters in Marseilles were shut down by French authorities, and morphine traffickers looked to Sicily. Starting in 1975, Cosa Nostra set up heroin refineries around the island. &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; sought to control both the refining and distribution of heroin. Sicilian mafiosi moved to the United States to personally control distribution networks there, often at the expense of their U.S. counterparts. Heroin addiction in North America surged from the mid-1970s into the early 1980s. By 1982, the Sicilian Mafia controlled about 80 percent of the heroin trade in the northeastern United States. Heroin was often distributed to street dealers from Mafia-owned pizzerias, and the revenues could be passed off as restaurant profits (the so-called Pizza Connection).

===Second Mafia War===
In the early 1970s, Luciano Leggio was boss of the Corleonesi clan and a member of the Sicilian Mafia Commission, and he forged a coalition of mafia clans known as the Corleonesi with himself as its leader. He initiated a campaign to dominate &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; and its narcotics trade. Leggio was imprisoned in 1974, so he acted through his deputy Salvatore Riina, to whom he eventually handed over control. The Corleonesi bribed cash-strapped Palermo clans into the fold, subverted members of other clans, and secretly recruited new members. In 1977, the Corleonesi had Gaetano Badalamenti expelled from the commission on trumped-up charges of hiding drug revenues. In April 1981, the Corleonesi murdered a rival member of the Commission Stefano Bontade, and the Second Mafia War began in earnest. Hundreds of enemy mafiosi and their relatives were murdered, sometimes by traitors in their own clans. By manipulating the Mafia&#x27;s rules and eliminating rivals, the Corleonesi came to completely dominate the commission. Riina used his power over the commission to replace the bosses of certain clans with hand-picked regents. In the end, the Corleonesi faction won and Riina effectively became the &quot;boss of bosses&quot; of the Sicilian Mafia.

At the same time that the Corleonesi waged their campaign to dominate &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot;, they also waged a campaign of murder against journalists, officials, and policemen who dared to cross them. The police were frustrated with the lack of help that they were receiving from witnesses and politicians. At the funeral of a policeman murdered by mafiosi in 1985, policemen insulted and spat at two attending politicians, and a fight broke out between them and military police.
Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti and High Court judge Corrado Carnevale were long been suspected of having ties to the Mafia, in addition to the Sicilian politician Salvatore Lima. In 1999, the Italian court of appeal held that Andreotti &quot;had, not without personal advantages, knowingly and deliberately nurtured a stable relationship with the criminal organization, contributing to its strength by manifesting his availability to favor its members&quot;; however, the court did not convict Andreotti due to the statute of limitations, which had been reached at the time of the ruling.

===Maxi Trial===

In the early 1980s, magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino began a campaign against &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot;. Their big break came with the arrest of Tommaso Buscetta, a mafioso who chose to turn informant in exchange for protection from the Corleonesi, who had already murdered many of his friends and relatives. Other mafiosi followed his example. Falcone and Borsellino compiled their testimonies and organized the Maxi Trial, which lasted from February 1986 to December 1987. It was held in a bunker-courthouse specially built for the occasion, where 475 mafiosi were put on trial, of which, 338 were convicted. In January 1992, Italy&#x27;s Supreme Court of Cassation confirmed these convictions. It is considered to be the most significant trial ever against the Sicilian Mafia, as well as the biggest trial in world history.

===War against the state and Riina&#x27;s downfall===
The Mafia retaliated violently. In 1988, they murdered a Palermo judge and his son; three years later, a prosecutor and an anti-mafia businessman were also murdered. Salvatore Lima, a close political ally of the Mafia, was murdered for failing to reverse the convictions as promised. Falcone was killed on May 23, 1992, with of TNT positioned under the highway near Capaci, Sicily. Borsellino was also killed by a car bomb on July 19, 1992. This led to a public outcry and a massive government crackdown, resulting in the arrest of Salvatore Riina in January 1993. More and more informants emerged. Many paid a high price for their cooperation, usually through the murder of relatives. For example, Francesco Marino Mannoia&#x27;s mother, aunt, and sister were murdered.

After Riina&#x27;s capture, numerous terror attacks were ordered as a warning to its members to not turn state&#x27;s witness, but also in response to the overruling of the Article 41-bis prison regime. Tourist spots were attacked, such as the Via dei Georgofili in Florence, Via Palestro in Milan, and the Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano and Via San Teodoro in Rome, leaving 10 dead and 93 injured and causing severe damage to cultural heritage such as the Uffizi Gallery. The Catholic Church openly condemned the Mafia, two churches were bombed and an anti-Mafia priest was shot dead in Rome.

The choice to hit cultural and church targets was partly to destabilize the government, but also because the Mafia felt that the Roman Catholic Church had abrogated an unwritten hands-off policy toward traditional organized crime in Southern Italy.
After Riina&#x27;s capture, the leadership of the Mafia was briefly held by Leoluca Bagarella, then passed to Bernardo Provenzano when Bagarella was captured in 1995. Provenzano halted the campaign of violence and replaced it with a campaign of quietness known as &quot;Pax Mafiosa&quot;.

===Provenzano years===
Under Bernardo Provenzano&#x27;s leadership, murders of state officials were halted. He also halted the policy of murdering informants and their families, with a view instead to getting them to retract their testimonies and return to the fold. He also restored the common support fund for imprisoned mafiosi.

By the late 1990s, the weakened Cosa Nostra had to yield most of the illegal drug trade to the &#x27;Ndrangheta crime organization from Calabria. In 2006, the &#x27;Ndrangheta was estimated to control 80 percent of the cocaine imported to Europe.

The tide of defectors was greatly stemmed. The Mafia preferred to initiate relatives of existing mafiosi, believing them to be less prone to defection. Provenzano was arrested in 2006, after 43 years on the run. His successor as boss was Matteo Messina Denaro, who was arrested only in 2023.

===Modern Mafia in Italy===
The incarcerated bosses are subject to strict controls on their contact with the outside world, limiting their ability to run their operations from behind bars under the article 41-bis prison regime. Antonino Giuffrè is a close confidant of Provenzano who turned informant shortly after his capture in 2002. He alleges that &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; had direct contact in 1993 with representatives of Silvio Berlusconi who was then planning the birth of Forza Italia.

The alleged deal included a repeal of 41 bis, among other anti-Mafia laws, in return for electoral support in Sicily. Nevertheless, Giuffrè&#x27;s declarations have not yet been confirmed. The Italian Parliament reinforced the provisions of the 41 bis, with the full support of Forza Italia. When the bill was set to expire in 2002, it was made into a permanent fixture in the penal code and extended to other crimes such as terrorism. However, according to one of Italy&#x27;s leading magazines &quot;L&#x27;Espresso&quot;, 119 mafiosi have been released on an individual basis – one-fifth of those incarcerated under the 41 bis regime. The human rights group Amnesty International expressed concern that the 41-bis regime could, in some circumstances, amount to &quot;cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment&quot; for prisoners.

In 2015, the Mafia Capitale investigation revealed that the Mafia profits from the European migrant crisis and exploits refugees.

In October 2017, members of the Renzvillo crime family and 2 Carabinieri military police officers were arrested for involvement in the drug trade and large-scale extortion. Altogether 37 people were arrested and over 600 officers were deployed. €11 million ($12 million) in real estate and goods were seized by police. A business owner was forced to pay €180,000 ($212,000). The Renzvillo mafia family has allegedly set up alliances with the &#x27;Ndrangheta and Camorra. The leader is suspected of previously sending members of his organization to Karlsruhe and Cologne in Germany.

On 22 January 2018, 58 people connected to 16 mafia families were arrested by Carabinieri police in Caltanissetta, Palermo, Enna, Ragusa, Agrigento and Catania. Some of the most common charges were mafia association, drug trafficking, extortion, fraud, and vote buying. The mayor of San Biagio Platani, Santino Sabella, was among the arrested and accused of agreeing on candidates for the 2014 local elections with the Sicilian Mafia and exerting pressure on the allocation of council contracts. Two companies running migrant reception centers in Sicily were targeted as protection rackets, overall 27 businesses were targeted and extorted.

On 1 February 2018, 31 people with ties to a crime family based in Palermo were arrested and charged with money laundering, fraud and drug trafficking, as part of Operation &quot;Game Over&quot;. Benedetto Bacchi, reportedly controlled over 700 betting shops across Italy and was earning roughly €1 million per month, using an online gambling operator licensed in Malta; his license was suspended. According to investigators, Bacchi bought a construction company, and a villa formerly owned by footballer Giovanni Tedesco for €500,000; the next day Bacchi listed the house for sale at the price of €1.3 million. He also allegedly considered taking over a news publication with his criminal proceeds. Investigators also alleged that the American Mafia in New York had set up a profitable food export company with the Sicilian mafia.

The Cosa Nostra has traditionally been the most powerful group in Palermo. After the arrest of the alleged new mafia boss in July 2019, a CNN article in July 2019 indicated that Sicilian Mafia activity in Palermo was particularly notorious in one area: the Sicilian town of Passo di Rigano with involvement &quot;in business such as wholesale food supplies, online betting and gambling&quot;. News articles also confirmed links between the Cosa Nostra and New York&#x27;s Gambino crime family. According to Italian newspaper &quot;La Repubblica&quot;, &quot;Off they go, through the streets of Passo di Rigano, Boccadifalco, Torretta and at the same time, Brooklyn, Staten Island, New Jersey. Because from Sicily to the US, the old mafia has returned.&quot;

Murders, particularly ones connected to Mafia activity, have decreased considerably since the 1990s. In 1991, there were 481 murders in Sicily of which 253 were connected to Mafia activity. In 2020, there were only 33 murders of which 4 were Mafia murders.

==Structure and composition==
&quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; is not a centralized organization but rather a loose confederation of about one hundred groups known alternately as &quot;families&quot;, &quot;&quot;cosche&quot;, &quot;borgatas&quot;&quot;, or &quot;clans&quot; (despite the name, their members are generally not related by blood). Each of these claims sovereignty over a territory, usually a town or village or a neighborhood of a larger city, though without ever fully conquering and legitimizing its monopoly on violence. For many years, the power apparatuses of the single families were the sole ruling bodies within the two associations, and they have remained the real centers of power even after superordinate bodies were created in the &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; beginning in the late 1950s (the Sicilian Mafia Commission).

===Clan hierarchy===

In 1984, mafioso informant Tommaso Buscetta explained to prosecutors the command structure of a typical clan. A clan is led by a &quot;boss&quot; (&quot;capofamiglia&quot; or &quot;rappresentante&quot;) who is aided by an underboss (&quot;capo bastone&quot; or &quot;sotto capo&quot;) and supervised by one or more advisers (&quot;consigliere&quot;). Under his command are groups (&quot;decina&quot;) of about ten &quot;soldiers&quot; (&quot;soldati&quot;, &quot;operai&quot;, or &quot;picciotti&quot;). Each &quot;decina&quot; is led by a &quot;capodecina&quot;.

The actual structure of any given clan can vary. Despite the name &quot;decina&quot;, they do not necessarily have ten soldiers, but can have anything from five to thirty. Some clans are so small that they don&#x27;t even have decinas and capodecinas, and even in large clans, certain soldiers may report directly to the boss or underboss.

The boss of a clan is typically elected by the rank-and-file soldiers (though violent successions do happen). Due to the small size of most Sicilian clans, the boss of a clan has intimate contact with all members and doesn&#x27;t receive much in the way of privileges or rewards as he would in larger organizations (such as the larger Five Families of New York). His tenure is also frequently short: elections are yearly, and he might be deposed sooner for misconduct or incompetence.

The underboss is second in command to the boss. The underboss is sometimes a family member, such as a son, who will take over the family if the boss is sick, killed, or imprisoned.

The &quot;consigliere&quot; (&quot;counselor&quot;) of the clan is also elected on a yearly basis. One of his jobs is to supervise the actions of the boss and his immediate underlings, particularly in financial matters (e.g. preventing embezzlement). He also serves as an impartial adviser to the boss and mediator in internal disputes. To fulfill this role, the &quot;consigliere&quot; must be impartial, devoid of conflict of interest and ambition.

Other than its members, &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; makes extensive use of &quot;associates&quot;. These are people who work for or aid a clan (or even multiple clans) but are not treated as true members. These include corrupt officials and prospective mafiosi. An associate is considered by the mafiosi nothing more than a tool, someone that they can &quot;use&quot;, or &quot;nothing mixed with nil&quot;.

The media has often made reference to a &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot; or &quot;boss of bosses&quot; that allegedly &quot;commands all of Cosa Nostra&quot;. Calogero Vizzini, Salvatore Riina, and Bernardo Provenzano were especially influential bosses who have each been described by the media and law enforcement as being the &quot;boss of bosses&quot; of their times. While a powerful boss may exert great influence over his neighbors, the position does not formally exist, according to Mafia turncoats such as Buscetta. According to Mafia historian Salvatore Lupo &quot;the emphasis of the media on the definition of a &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot; is without any foundation&quot;.

===Membership===
Membership in &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; is open only to Sicilian men. A candidate cannot be a relative of or have any close links with a lawman, such as a police officer or a judge. There is no strict age limit; men as young as sixteen have been initiated. A prospective mafioso is carefully tested for obedience, discretion, courage, ruthlessness, and skill at espionage. He is almost always required to commit murder as his ultimate trial, even if he doesn&#x27;t plan to be a career assassin. The act of murder is to prove his sincerity (i.e., he is not an undercover policeman) and to bind him into silence (i.e., he cannot break omertà without facing murder charges himself).

To be part of the Mafia is highly desirable for many street criminals. Mafiosi receive a great deal of respect, for everyone knows that to offend a mafioso is to risk lethal retribution from him or his colleagues. Mafiosi have an easier time getting away with crimes, negotiating deals, and demanding privileges. A full member also gains more freedom to participate in certain rackets which the Mafia controls (particularly protection racketeering).

Traditionally, only men can become mafiosi, though in recent times there have been reports of women assuming the responsibilities of imprisoned mafiosi relatives.

Clans are also called &quot;families&quot;, although their members are usually not related by blood. The Mafia actually has rules designed to prevent nepotism. Membership and rank in the Mafia are not hereditary. Most new bosses are not related to their predecessors. The Commission forbids relatives from holding positions in inter-clan bodies at the same time. That said, mafiosi frequently bring their sons into the trade. They have an easier time entering because the son bears his father&#x27;s seal of approval and is familiar with the traditions and requirements of &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot;.

A mafioso&#x27;s legitimate occupation, if any, generally does not affect his prestige within &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot;. Historically, most mafiosi were employed in menial jobs, and many bosses did not work at all. Professionals such as lawyers and doctors do exist within the organization, and are employed according to whatever useful skills they have.

===Commission===
Since the 1950s, the Mafia has maintained multiple commissions to resolve disputes and promote cooperation among clans. Each province of Sicily has its own Commission. Clans are organized into districts (&quot;mandamenti&quot;) of three or four geographically adjacent clans. Each district elects a representative (&quot;capo mandamento&quot;) to sit on its Provincial Commission.

Contrary to popular belief, the commissions do not serve as a centralized government for the Mafia. The power of the commissions is limited and clans are autonomous and independent. Rather, each Commission serves as a representative mechanism for consultation of independent clans who decide by consensus. &quot;Contrary to the wide-spread image presented by the media, these superordinate bodies of coordination cannot be compared with the executive boards of major legal firms. Their power is intentionally limited. And it would be entirely wrong to see in the &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; a centrally managed, internationally active Mafia holding company&quot;, according to criminologist Letizia Paoli.

A major function of the commission is to regulate the use of violence. For instance, a mafioso who wants to commit a murder in another clan&#x27;s territory must ask the permission of the local boss; the commission enforces this rule. Any murder of a mafioso or prominent individual (police, lawyers, politicians, journalists, etc.) must be approved by the commission. Such acts can potentially upset other clans and spark a war, so the Commission provides a means by which to obtain their approval.

The commission also deals with matters of succession. When a boss dies or retires, his clan&#x27;s reputation often crumbles with his departure. This can cause clients to abandon the clan and turn to neighboring clans for protection. These clans would grow greatly in status and power relative to their rivals, potentially destabilizing the region and precipitating war. The Commission may choose to divide up the clan&#x27;s territory and members among its neighbors. Alternatively, the commission has the power to appoint a regent for the clan until it can elect a new boss.

==Rituals and codes of conduct==

===Initiation ceremony===
One of the first accounts of an initiation ceremony into the Mafia was given by Bernardino Verro, a leader of the Fasci Siciliani, a popular movement of democratic and socialist inspiration that arose in Sicily in the early 1890s. In order to give the movement teeth and to protect himself from harm, Verro became a member of a Mafia group in Corleone, the &quot;Fratuzzi&quot; (Little Brothers). In a memoir written many years later, he described the initiation ritual which he underwent in the spring of 1893:
After his arrest, mafioso Giovanni Brusca described the ceremony in which he was formally made a full member of &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot;. In 1976, he was invited to a &quot;banquet&quot; at a country house. He was brought into a room where several mafiosi were sitting around a table upon which sat a pistol, a dagger, and a piece of paper bearing the image of a saint. They questioned his commitment and his feelings regarding criminality and murder (despite his already having a history of such acts). When he affirmed himself, Salvatore Riina, then the most powerful boss of &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot;, took a needle and pricked Brusca&#x27;s finger. Brusca smeared his blood on the image of the saint, which he held in his cupped hands as Riina set it alight. As Brusca juggled the burning image in his hands, Riina said to him: &quot;If you betray Cosa Nostra, your flesh will burn like this saint&quot;.

The elements of the ceremony have changed little over the Mafia&#x27;s history. These elements have been the subject of much curiosity and speculation. Sociologist Diego Gambetta points out that the Mafia, being a secretive criminal organization, cannot risk having its recruits sign application forms and written contracts that might be seized by the police. Thus they rely on the old-fashioned ritual ceremony. The elements of the ceremony are made deliberately specific, bizarre, and painful so that the event is both memorable and unambiguous, and the ceremony is witnessed by a number of senior mafiosi. The participants may not even care about what the symbols mean, and they may indeed have no intrinsic meaning. The real point of the ritual is to leave no doubt about the mafioso&#x27;s new status so that it cannot be denied or revoked on a whim.

===Introductions===
There is always a risk that outsiders and undercover policemen might masquerade as a mafioso to infiltrate the organization. To ensure that this does not happen, a mafioso must never introduce himself to another mafioso whom he does not personally know, even if he knows the other through reputation. If he wants to establish a relationship, he must ask a third mafioso whom they both personally know to introduce them to each other in a face-to-face meeting. This intermediary can vouch that neither of the two is an impostor.

This tradition is upheld scrupulously, often to the detriment of efficient operation. For instance, when mafioso Indelicato Amedeo returned to Sicily following his initiation in the United States in the 1950s, he could not announce his membership to his own mafioso father but had to wait for a mafioso from the United States who knew of his induction to come to Sicily and introduce the son to the father.

===Etiquette===
Mafiosi of equal status sometimes call each other &quot;&quot;compare&quot;, while inferiors call their superiors &quot;padrino&quot;. &quot;Compare&quot;&quot; means &quot;comrade&quot;, while &quot;Padrino&quot; is the Italian term for &quot;godfather&quot;.

===Ten Commandments===
In November 2007, Sicilian police reported the discovery of a list of &quot;Ten Commandments&quot; in the hideout of mafia boss Salvatore Lo Piccolo, thought to be guidelines on good, respectful, and honorable conduct for a mafioso.

# No one can present himself directly to another of our friends. There must be a third person to do it.
# Never look at the wives of friends.
# Never be seen with cops.
# Don&#x27;t go to pubs and clubs.
# Always being available for &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; is a duty - even if your wife is about to give birth.
# Appointments must absolutely be respected (refers to rank and authority).
# Wives must be treated with respect.
# When asked for any information, the answer must be the truth.
# Money cannot be appropriated if it belongs to others or to other families.
# People who can&#x27;t be part of &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot;: anyone who has a close relative in the police, anyone with a two-timing relative in the family, anyone who behaves badly and doesn&#x27;t hold to moral values.

Antonino Calderone recounted similar Commandments in his 1987 testimony:
===No documentation of Mafia activities===
There is a strict prohibition in the Mafia on writing incriminating information down on paper, lest such evidence fall into the hands of the police. In 1969, Michele Cavataio was murdered because he had drawn a map on which he had written the names of all the Palermo mafiosi he knew and marked their territories. He showed this map in meetings with other senior mafiosi to explain how he thought the Palermo families should be reorganized in the wake of a Mafia war. When Cavataio was murdered, his assassins searched his body for the map so that they could destroy it, but they didn&#x27;t find it.

The prohibition on documenting anything also explains why the Mafia uses a bizarre ritual to initiate new members (see above). Since new members cannot sign membership contracts, the initiation of a new member is instead done in a ceremony with witnesses, and the initiate performs a specific series of bizarre actions so that there is no ambiguity as to what is being granted. Likewise, since mafiosi cannot introduce themselves to each other by presenting membership cards, they must ask a third mafioso who knows them both to introduce them to each other and vouch that they are both members.

===Omertà===

Omertà is a code of silence and secrecy that forbids mafiosi from betraying their comrades to the authorities. The penalty for transgression is death, and relatives of the turncoat may also be murdered. Mafiosi generally do not associate with police (aside perhaps from corrupting individual officers as necessary). For instance, a mafioso will not call the police when he is a victim of a crime. He is expected to take care of the problem himself. To do otherwise would undermine his reputation as a capable protector of others (see below), and his enemies may see him as weak and vulnerable.

The need for secrecy and inconspicuousness deeply colors the traditions and mannerisms of mafiosi. Mafiosi are discouraged from consuming alcohol or other drugs, as in an inebriated state they are more likely to blurt out sensitive information. They also frequently adopt self-effacing attitudes to strangers so as to avoid unwanted attention. Most Sicilians tend to be very verbose and expressive, whereas mafiosi tend to be more terse and subdued.

To a degree, mafiosi also impose omertà on the general population. Civilians who buy their protection or make other deals are expected to be discreet, on pain of death. Witness intimidation is also common.

==Protection rackets==
Scholars such as Diego Gambetta and Leopold Franchetti have characterized the Mafia as a &quot;cartel of private protection firms&quot;. The primary activity of the Mafia is to provide protection and guarantee trust in areas of the Sicilian economy where the police and courts cannot be relied upon. The Mafia arbitrates disputes between criminals, organizes and oversees illicit business deals, and protects businessmen and criminals from cheats, thieves, and vandals. This aspect of the Mafia is often overlooked in the media because, unlike drug dealing and extortion, it is often not reported to the police.

In one of his books, Gambetta illustrates this concept with the scenario of a butcher who wishes to sell some meat to a supermarket without paying sales tax. Since the transaction is essentially a black market deal, the agents cannot turn to the police or the courts if either of them cheats the other. The seller might supply rotting meat, or the purchaser might refuse to pay. The mistrust and fear of being cheated with no recourse might prevent these two agents from making a profitable transaction. To guarantee each other&#x27;s honesty, the two parties can ask the local mafia clan to oversee the transaction. In exchange for a commission, the mafioso promises to both the buyer and seller that if either of them tries to cheat the other, the cheater can expect to be assaulted or have his property vandalized. Such is the mafioso&#x27;s reputation for viciousness, impartiality, and reliability that neither the buyer nor the seller would consider cheating with him overseeing the deal. The transaction thus proceeds smoothly.

The Mafia&#x27;s protection is not restricted to illegal activities. Shopkeepers often pay the Mafia to protect them from thieves. If a shopkeeper enters into a protection contract with a mafioso, the mafioso will make it publicly known that if any thief were foolish enough to rob his client&#x27;s shop, he would track down the thief, beat him up, and, if possible, recover the stolen merchandise (mafiosi make it their business to know all the fences in their territory).

It is a misconception that the Mafia extorts clients by only offering &quot;protection&quot; from its own violence. While the Mafia often coerces people into buying protection, it usually provides it. In fact, many clients, particularly criminals, actively seek Mafia protection. This is one of the main reasons why the Mafia has resisted more than a century of government efforts to destroy it: the people who willingly solicit these services protect the Mafia from the authorities. If one is enjoying the benefits of Mafia protection, one does not want the police arresting one&#x27;s mafioso.

In Sicily, protection money is known as pizzo; the anti-extortion support group Addiopizzo derives its name from this. Mafiosi might sometimes ask for favors instead of money, such as assistance in committing a crime.

The amount of money that the Mafia extorts from firms in Sicily correlates weakly with the revenue of the firm. As a result, smaller firms end up paying a higher share of their profits to the Mafia than larger firms; sometimes as high as 40% of profits for smaller firms and as low as 2% of profits for larger firms. The pizzo is thus a sort of regressive taxation that hurts small businesses more. This presents a barrier to entry for entrepreneurs in Sicily and makes it difficult for small businesses to reinvest in themselves since the pizzo takes a disproportionately larger share of their profits. This in turn results in oligopolistic markets, where a few large firms dominate, selling low-quality products at high prices. Mafia extortion thus mires the Sicilian economy in a poverty trap.

===Protection from theft===
Protection from theft is one service that the Mafia provides to paying &quot;clients&quot;. Mafiosi themselves are generally forbidden from committing theft (though in practice they are merely forbidden from stealing from anyone connected to the Mafia). Instead, mafiosi make it their business to know all the thieves and fences operating within their territory. If a protected business is robbed, the clan will use these contacts to track down and return the stolen goods and punish the thieves, usually by beating them up. Since the pursuit of thieves and their loot often goes into territories of other clans, clans routinely cooperate with each other on this matter, providing information and blocking the sale of the loot if they can.

===Protection from competition===
Mafiosi sometimes protect businesspeople from competitors by threatening their competitors with violence. If two businesspeople are competing for a government contract, the protected can ask their mafioso friends to bully their rival out of the bidding process. In another example, a mafioso acting on behalf of a coffee supplier might pressure local bars into serving only their client&#x27;s coffee.

The primary method by which the Mafia stifles competition, however, is the overseeing and enforcement of collusive agreements between businesspeople. Mafia-enforced collusion typically appears in markets where collusion is both desirable (inelastic demand, lack of product differentiation, etc.) and difficult to set up (numerous competitors, low barriers to entry). Industries which fit this description include garbage collection.

===Client relations===
Mafiosi approach potential clients in an aggressive but friendly manner, like a door-to-door salesman. They may even offer a few free favors as an enticement. If a client rejects their overtures, mafiosi sometimes coerce them by vandalizing their property or other forms of harassment. Physical assault is rare; clients may be murdered for breaching agreements or talking to the police, but not for simply refusing protection.

In many situations, mafia bosses prefer to establish an indefinite long-term bond with a client, rather than make one-off contracts. The boss can then publicly declare the client to be under his permanent protection (his &quot;friend&quot;, in Sicilian parlance). This leaves little public confusion as to who is and is not protected, so thieves and other predators will be deterred from attacking a protected client and prey only on the unprotected.

Mafiosi generally do not involve themselves in the management of the businesses they protect or arbitrate. Lack of competence is a common reason, but mostly it is to divest themselves of any interests that may conflict with their roles as protectors and arbitrators. This makes them more trusted by their clients, who need not fear their businesses being taken over.

===Protection territories===
A Mafia clan cannot tolerate competition within their sphere of influence from another racketeer. If a dispute erupted between two clients protected by rival racketeers, the two racketeers would have to fight each other to win the dispute for their respective clients. The outcomes of such fights can be unpredictable not to mention bloody, and neither racketeer could guarantee a victory for their client. This would make their protection unreliable and of little value. Their clients might dismiss them and settle the dispute by other means, and their reputations would suffer. To prevent this, mafia clans negotiate territories in which they can monopolize the use of violence in settling disputes. This is not always done peacefully, and disputes over territory are at the root of most Mafia wars.

Because Mafia clans provide protection within territorial monopolies, the price of their protection is often high and the quality often low.

==Other activities==

===Vote buying===
Politicians court mafiosi to obtain votes during elections. A mafioso&#x27;s mere endorsement of a certain candidate can be enough for their clients, relatives, and associates to vote for that candidate. A particularly influential mafioso can bring in thousands of votes for a candidate; such is the respect that a mafioso can command. Between its 630-member Chamber of Deputies and 315+ member Senate, the Italian Parliament has a huge number of seats (roughly 1 per 64,000 citizens) and a large number of political parties competing for them, meaning that a candidate can win with only a few thousand votes. A mafia clan&#x27;s support can thus be decisive for their success.

Politicians usually repay this support with favors, such as sabotaging police investigations or giving contracts and permits.

They are not ideological themselves, though mafiosi have traditionally opposed extreme parties such as Fascists and Communists, and favored center candidates.

===Smuggling===
Mafiosi provide protection and invest capital in smuggling gangs. Smuggling operations require large investments (goods, boats, crews, etc.) but few people would trust their money to criminal gangs. It is mafiosi who raise the necessary money from investors and ensure that all parties act in good faith. They also ensure that the smugglers operate in safety.

Mafiosi rarely directly involve themselves in smuggling operations. When they do, it is usually when the operations are especially risky. In this case, they may induct smugglers into their clans in the hope of binding them more firmly. This was the case with heroin smuggling, where the volumes and profits involved were too large to keep the operations at arm&#x27;s length.

===Bid rigging===
The Sicilian Mafia in Italy is believed to have a turnover of €6.5 billion through control of public and private contracts. Mafiosi use threats of violence and vandalism to muscle out competitors and win contracts for the companies that they control. They rarely manage the businesses that they control, but take a cut of their profits, usually through payoffs (pizzo).

===Loan sharking===
In a 2007 publication, the Italian small-business association Confesercenti reported that about 25.2 percent of Sicilian businesses were indebted to loan sharks, who collected around €1.4 billion a year in payments. This figure rose during the late-2000s recession, as tighter lending by banks forced the desperate to borrow from the Mafia.

===Forbidden crimes===
Certain types of crimes are forbidden by &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot;, either by members or freelance criminals within their domains. Mafiosi are generally forbidden from committing theft (burglary, mugging, etc.). Kidnapping is also generally forbidden, even by non-mafiosi, as it attracts a great deal of public hostility and police attention. These rules have been violated from time to time, both with and without the permission of senior mafiosi.

==Violence and reputation==

===Murder===

Murders are almost always carried out by members. It is very rare for the Mafia to recruit an outsider for a single job, and such people are liable to be eliminated soon afterward because they become expendable liabilities. Mafia violence is most commonly directed at other Mafia families competing for territory and business. Violence is more common in the Sicilian Mafia than the American Mafia because Mafia families in Sicily are smaller and more numerous, creating a more volatile atmosphere.

===Reputation===
The Mafia&#x27;s power comes from its reputation to commit violence, particularly murder, against virtually anyone. Through reputation, mafiosi deter their enemies and enemies of their clients. It allows mafiosi to protect a client without being physically present (e.g. as bodyguards or watchmen), which in turn allows them to protect many clients at once.

Compared to other occupations, reputation is especially valuable for a mafioso, as his primary product is protection through intimidation. The reputation of a mafioso is dichotomous: he is either a good protector or a bad one; there is no mediocrity. This is because a mafioso can only either succeed at preventing an act of violence or fail utterly should any violence take place. There is no spectrum of quality when it comes to violent protection. Consequently, a series of failures can completely ruin a mafioso&#x27;s reputation, and with it his business.

The more fearsome a mafioso&#x27;s reputation is, the more he can win disputes without having recourse to violence. It can even happen that a mafioso who loses his means to commit violence (e.g. his soldiers are all in prison) can still use his reputation to intimidate and provide protection if everyone is unaware of his weakness and still believes in his power. However, such bluffs generally do not last long, as his rivals may sense his weakness and challenge him.

When a Mafia boss retires from leadership (or is killed), his clan&#x27;s reputation as effective protectors and enforcers often goes with him. If his replacement has a weaker reputation, clients may lose confidence in the clan and defect to its neighbors, causing a shift in the balance of power and possible conflict. Ideally, the successor to the boss will have built a strong reputation of his own as he worked his way up the ranks, giving the clan a reputable new leader. In this way, established Mafia clans have a powerful edge over newcomers who start from scratch; joining a clan as a soldier offers an aspiring mafioso a chance to build up his own reputation under the guidance and protection of senior mafiosi.

<doc id="893143" wikidata="Q390913" url="?curid=893143" title="Evgeni Nabokov">
<text>Yevgeni Viktorovich Nabokov (; born July 25, 1975) is a Kazakhstani-Russian former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the San Jose Sharks, New York Islanders, and Tampa Bay Lightning of National Hockey League (NHL) and for Torpedo Ust-Kamenogorsk, Dynamo Moscow, Metallurg Magnitogorsk and SKA Saint Petersburg of the Russian Super League (RSL) and Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) from 1991 to 2015.

Nicknamed &quot;Nabby&quot;, Nabokov, who was selected 219th overall 1994 NHL Entry Draft by San Jose, was regarded as one of the top goaltenders in the NHL, winning the Calder Memorial Trophy as the best first-year player in 2001 and was voted a finalist for the Vezina Trophy as best goaltender in 2008. He departed the NHL for the first time in 2010 to play for SKA Saint Petersburg in Russia, but returned soon after, and concluded his career in the NHL. After retiring as a player Nabokov took up a role as a development coach for the Sharks, and in 2019 was named the goaltending coach for team.

In his first nine seasons in the NHL, all with San Jose, Nabokov became the team leader in nearly every goaltending category, including games played, wins, and shutouts. At his retirement, he had the eighteenth most all-time NHL regular season wins. During a game in 2002 he scored a goal, the seventh goalie in NHL history to do so, and the first not from North America.

Born in the then-Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, Nabokov first played internationally with Kazakhstan at the 1994 World Championships Group C. However, he later joined the Russian national team, and played for them from 2006, including both the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics, winning a gold at the 2008 World Championships.

==Playing career==

===Russia and move to North America===
Nabokov first played for his hometown team, Torpedo Ust-Kamenogorsk, spending three years with the club from 1991 until 1994. After his last season with the club he was selected in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft by the San Jose Sharks in the ninth round, 219th overall. Tim Burke, the Sharks&#x27; scout, was originally scouting for a different goalie when he heard of Nabokov. The Sharks never saw Nabokov play before selecting him in the draft, and did not contact him until 1997. The following season Nabokov moved to join Dynamo Moscow, where he spent the next three seasons. In his first year with Dynamo, they won the league championship. It was after the 1996–97 season, which saw Nabokov help Dynamo reach the final of the European Hockey League, that he was contacted by the Sharks and offered a contract and come to North America.

Happy to play for Dynamo Moscow, Nabokov was initially reluctant to move to North America and play for the Sharks minor league affiliates, but decided to on the advice of his parents. Assigned to the Kentucky Thoroughblades, the Sharks&#x27; affiliate in the American Hockey League (AHL), he struggled to adapt to the new surroundings and style of hockey, and was ready to return to Russia during his first year. However he decided to stay after meeting his future wife, Tabitha, and refining his playing style with the Sharks goaltending coach, Warren Strelow. Used as the Thoroughblades back-up goalie, Nabokov only played in 33 games for the team. The following season was much better as he stayed near the AHL leaders in nearly every goaltending category, though he missed time due to appendicitis; he appeared in 43 games for Kentucky, winning 26 of them.

===San Jose Sharks===
Nabokov started the 1999–2000 season with the Sharks affiliate, the Cleveland Lumberjacks of the International Hockey League (IHL). After 20 games with Cleveland, where he had a record of twelve wins, four losses, and three ties, Nabokov was recalled to the Sharks to serve as the back-up to Steve Shields, after Mike Vernon was traded. Nabokov made his NHL debut on January 1, 2000, in relief of Shields, against the Nashville Predators. His first start came January 19 against the Colorado Avalanche; Nabokov made 39 saves for his first shutout in a 0–0 tie. He finished with 11 games played for the Sharks during the 1999–00 NHL season, winning two and losing two.
In the second game of the 2000–01 season, Shields hurt his ankle, leaving Nabokov to become the starting goalie. He appeared in 66 games and had a record of 32 wins and 21 losses, and was named to the mid-season All-Star Game. In recognition of his play, Nabokov was named the winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy as the rookie of the year, and was named to the year-end All-Rookie team; he also finished fourth in voting for the Vezina Trophy for best goalie in the league. He had similar success the following season, with 37 wins and 7 shutouts in 67 games, and on March 10, 2002 he scored a goal against the Vancouver Canucks, both the first European goalie to do so, and the first goalie to score a powerplay goal.

At the start of the 2002–03 season, Nabokov held out in a contract dispute. After making less than $1 million the previous two seasons, he felt he deserved an increase in salary, speculated to be around $4 million per season. He missed five games before the team signed him to a two-year contract worth slightly more than $3.5 million per season. Both Nabokov and the Sharks had a poor season, with the team missing the playoffs for the first time in six years, and Nabokov only winning 19 games, and finishing with a losing record. This was improved upon in 2003–04 though, as Nabokov&#x27;s 31 wins helped the team reach the playoffs again, where they reached the third round for the first time in team history. A further two-year extension signed in 2004 saw him earn almost $4.5 million per year.

Nabokov was considered one of the elite goaltenders in the NHL, and was often ranked as one of the top ten, if not top five goaltenders in the NHL by &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Hockey News&quot;. However, the 2005–06 season was an off year for Nabokov, and his save percentage of under .900 was a big concern to the team. He was relegated to the role of backup goaltender behind Vesa Toskala. Despite his less-than-stellar play, Nabokov was signed to a four-year contract extension worth roughly $21.5 million in February 2006. The contract had a no-trade clause that was activated on the condition that San Jose made the playoffs.
During the 2006–07 NHL season, Nabokov split the starting goaltending duties with Toskala. In the Sharks 82 games Nabokov started 49. Nabokov played all 5 games in the Western Conference Quarterfinals of the 2007 NHL playoffs, helping the Sharks defeat the Nashville Predators in 5 games.

During the first half of the 2007–08 NHL season, Nabokov started the first 43 games for the Sharks, however on January 13, 2008, in Anaheim he received his first day off when Thomas Greiss started his first NHL game. Nabokov was recognized as one of the &quot;Three Stars&quot; for the NHL in the last week of December 2007, along with Alexander Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals and Jaromír Jágr of the New York Rangers. In addition to that honor, Nabokov was named the &quot;Sharks Player of the Month&quot; by Seagate Technology in December. Since the 1996–97 season, Seagate Technology has recognized Sharks players who made contributions to further the team’s accomplishments and makes a donation of $2,500 to The Sharks Foundation on the players’ behalf. Nabokov holds the franchise-record for having won this award nine times.
Nabokov played in his second NHL All-Star Game on January 27, 2008. He stopped all eight shots that came at him, marking the first time since Nikolai Khabibulin&#x27;s period in the 2002 game that a goalie played an All-Star period where no goals were scored. He secured the scoreless period when he blocked both of Ilya Kovalchuk’s shots in the last minute of the second period. On May 4, during game six of the 2008 NHL Playoffs Western Conference Semi-Finals, Nabokov made what has been called one of the best glove saves in decades, when he saved a shot from Brad Richards of the Dallas Stars by sliding over from the other side of the post and gloving the puck. The save was reviewed for several minutes before making it clear Nabokov saved it before it went over the goal line. The game, which ended in a Dallas victory, lasted for four overtime periods and is the eighth longest game in the league&#x27;s history.

Nabokov recorded 41 wins for San Jose during the following season as the team clinched first overall in the Western Conference and the league. Despite this, San Jose was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by eighth seed Anaheim Ducks, marking just the fourth time that an eighth seed team defeated a first seed team in the first round of the playoffs. On October 17, 2009, he played in his 500th career game, all played with the Sharks, and stopped 31 shots in a 4–1 win over the New York Islanders. On February 11, 2010, Nabokov stopped a career-high 50 shots en route to a 3–2 shootout victory against the Detroit Red Wings, which was also his 11th consecutive road victory, a new NHL record.

===Later career===

At the conclusion of the 2009-10 season Nabokov was told by the Sharks general manager Doug Wilson that he would not be offered a new contract, with the team unable to meet his salary demands due to the NHL salary cap. An unrestricted free agent, Nabokov did not see any offers from NHL teams, and so signed a contract with SKA St. Petersburg of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). The deal was reported to be for $24 million over four years. The salary was in line with demands Nabokov had apparently been seeking, though he denied money was a factor, but rather signed because of the length of the contract. Nabokov struggled in the KHL, and after 22 games with SKA he was released by the team in December, which cited &quot;family circumstances&quot; in a statement. During his lone season in the KHL, Nabokov recorded eight wins and eight losses, with a goals against average and save percentage far above his career averages.

Once again a free agent, Nabokov signed a contract with the Detroit Red Wings on January 20, 2011; the Red Wings were one of the top teams in the NHL at the time, and Nabokov signed a contract for just $570,000 as a result. However as he had started the season in the KHL, NHL rules required him to be placed on waivers prior to joining the Red Wings, and thus be available at that salary to any team lower than them in the standings. He was subsequently claimed by the New York Islanders, who were one of the worst teams in the NHL at the time. As he had only signed with Detroit in hopes of playing in the playoffs that year, Nabokov refused to join the Islanders, stating that it didn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to him why they claimed him. The Islanders suspended Nabokov for failing to join the team, and he sat out the rest of the season.

In August 2011, Nabokov stated that he would be reporting to New York&#x27;s training camp. He played for the team the entirety of the 2011–12 season, wearing the number 20, and eventually took over the starting goaltender position. He got his first win with the team on October 15, 2011, against the New York Rangers. On January 14, 2012, Nabokov recorded his 300th career win against the Buffalo Sabres, becoming the 26th goaltender to reach the milestone. On March 21, 2012 he signed a one-year, $2.75 million contract extension to remain with New York for another season, followed by another one-year $3.25 million contract for the 2013–14 season.

After New York signed goaltenders Jaroslav Halak and Chad Johnson in the 2014 off-season, it became clear they didn&#x27;t have plans to re-sign Nabokov. On July 1, 2014, he signed a one-year contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning worth $1.55 million. After posting a 3–6–2 record as the team&#x27;s backup goaltender to Ben Bishop, he was placed on waivers around the midpoint of the season, February 1, 2015. Following his waivers clear, it was questioned as to whether he would report to Tampa Bay&#x27;s AHL affiliate or consider retirement. On February 9, 2015, Nabokov was traded back to the Sharks for &quot;future considerations&quot;. He announced his retirement on February 11, 2015.

==Post-playing career==
In September 2015, Nabokov became a goaltending development coach and scout in the Sharks organization; in addition to the Sharks, he worked with the goaltenders on the team&#x27;s AHL affiliate San Jose Barracuda. On December 11, 2019, after head coach Peter DeBoer and his assistants were fired, Nabokov was named the Sharks&#x27; goaltending coach under interim coach Bob Boughner.

==International career==



Nabokov first played an international tournament with Kazakhstan at the 1994 World Championships C Pool. He appeared in three games as Kazakhstan finished fourth in the tournament. This appearance prevented Nabokov from playing for Russia at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Though Nabokov appealed to play, International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) bylaws stated that players cannot represent two different countries after the age of 18; as Nabokov was 19 during his appearance with Kazakhstan, he was unable to play for Russia.

The IIHF granted Nabokov an exemption to play for Russia at the 2006 Winter Olympics. Nabokov played seven games during the Olympics, winning four and earning three shutouts as the Russians finished fourth. He next represented Russia at the 2008 World Championships. Nabokov posted back-to-back shut-outs before defeating Canada 5-4 in the gold medal game. He was named to the tournament&#x27;s all-star team and named best goaltender.

Nabokov next joined Russia for the 2008 IIHF World Championship, arriving after the Sharks were eliminated in the NHL playoffs. He appeared in five games, winning them all, and helped Russia win their first gold medal since 1993, and was named as the tournament&#x27;s best goaltender and put on the tournament all-star team. The starting goalie for Russia at the 2010 Winter Olympics, Nabokov helped Russia reach the quarterfinals against Canada. However he allowed four goals in the first period and was subsequently pulled, with Russia ultimately losing 7–3. Nabokov finished the Olympics with a record of two wins and one loss as the Russians placed sixth overall. His final appearance in an international tournament was at the 2011 IIHF World Championship. Nabokov played four games for Russia, winning two and losing one, before a groin injury forced him to leave the tournament; Russia finished fourth.

==Personal life==
Nabokov, an only child, was born in Ust-Kamenogorsk (now called Oskemen), in the Kazakh SSR (now Kazakhstan). His father, Viktor, was a former professional hockey goaltender who played 18 years in both Russia and Kazakhstan before he retired in 1987. After his playing career ended, Viktor established a goaltending school in the city, which Nabokov later attended. His mother, Tatyana, worked as an engineer in a local factory. Nabokov first played hockey when he was six years old, taking up the same position his father had played.

When he moved to North America in 1997, Nabokov initially went by the name &quot;John&quot;, fearing that English speakers might have difficulty pronouncing his name.

Nabokov met his wife, Tabitha Eckler, shortly after he began playing in Kentucky. She was a college student and waitress at the time. They were married in 2001. They have two children together, daughter Emily (born in January 2004), and son Andrei (born on February 12, 2007).

<text>Reinhard Gehlen (3 April 1902 – 8 June 1979) was a German military and intelligence officer, later dubbed &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Super Spy,&quot; who served the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, and West Germany, and also worked for the United States during the early years of the Cold War. He led the Gehlen Organization, which worked with the CIA from its founding, employing former SS and Wehrmacht officers, and later became the first head of West Germany&#x27;s Federal Intelligence Service (BND). In years prior, he was in charge of German military intelligence on the Eastern Front during World War II and later became one of the founders of the West German armed forces, the Bundeswehr.

The son of an army officer and World War I veteran, in 1920 Gehlen joined the Reichswehr, the truncated army of the Weimar Republic, and was an operations staff officer in an infantry division during the invasion of Poland in 1939. After that he was appointed to the staff of General Franz Halder, the Chief of the Army High Command (OKH), and quickly became one of his main assistants. Gehlen had a significant role in planning the German operations in Greece, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union. When the Red Army continued to fight after the initial German success during Operation Barbarossa, in the spring of 1942 Gehlen was appointed by Halder as director of Foreign Armies East (FHO), the military intelligence service of the OKH tasked with analyzing the Soviet armed forces. He achieved the rank of major general before he was dismissed by Adolf Hitler in April 1945 because of the FHO&#x27;s alleged &quot;defeatism&quot; and accurate but pessimistic intelligence reports about Red Army military superiority.

Following the end of World War II, Gehlen surrendered to the United States Army. While in a POW camp, Gehlen offered FHO&#x27;s microfilmed and secretly buried archives about the USSR and his own services to the U.S. intelligence community. Following the start of the Cold War, the U.S. military (G-2 Intelligence) accepted Gehlen&#x27;s offer and assigned him to establish the Gehlen Organization, an espionage service focusing on the Soviet Union and Soviet Bloc. Beginning with his time as head of the Gehlen Organization, Gehlen favored both Atlanticism and close cooperation between what would become West Germany, the U.S. intelligence community, and the other members of the NATO military alliance. The organization employed hundreds of former members of the Nazi Party and former Wehrmacht military intelligence officers.

After West Germany regained its sovereignty, Gehlen became the founding president of the Federal Intelligence Service (&quot;Bundesnachrichtendienst&quot;, BND) of West Germany (1956–68). Gehlen obeyed a direct order from West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, and also hired former counterintelligence officers of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) and the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD), in response to an alleged avalanche of covert ideological subversion hitting West Germany from the intelligence services behind the Iron Curtain.

Gehlen was instrumental in negotiations to establish an official West German intelligence service based on the Gehlen Organization of the early 1950s. In 1956, the Gehlen Organization was transferred to the West German government and formed the core of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND), the Federal Republic of Germany&#x27;s official foreign intelligence service, with Gehlen serving as its first president until his retirement in 1968. While this was a civilian office, he was also a lieutenant-general in the Reserve forces of the Bundeswehr, the highest-ranking reserve-officer in the military of West Germany. 

==Early life and career==
Gehlen was born 1902 into a Protestant family in Erfurt and had two brothers and a sister. His father was Walther Gehlen, an officer in the Imperial German Army during World War I, and his mother, Katharina Margaret Gehlen (), was a Flemish noblewoman. He grew up in Breslau, where his father, a former army officer, was a publisher for the Ferdinand-Hirt-Verlag, a publishing house specializing in school books. In his youth, Gehlen&#x27;s main interests were mathematics and horses.

He wanted to follow his father&#x27;s path and become an army officer, despite the recent defeat of Germany in World War I and the reduction in the size of the army. In 1920, at the age of eighteen, Gehlen completed his Abitur and joined the Reichswehr. In 1921 he was posted to the 6th Light Artillery Regiment (later the 3rd Prussian Artillery Regiment) in Schweidnitz, a town in Silesia near the Polish border, and 1923 he became a lieutenant. He graduated from the infantry and artillery schools. Gehlen received an assignment at the cavalry school in Hanover in 1926, where spent two years before requesting a transfer, and in 1928 he was sent to back to his original unit in Schweidnitz. There he met a secretary working for the military, Herta von Seydlitz-Kurzbach, and they got married in 1931. She was a member of an aristocratic Prussian military family.

After Adolf Hitler rose to power in 1933 there was an expansion of the Reichswehr, including more opportunities for officers to receive promotions. That same year in October, Gehlen began attending the &quot;Commander Assistants Training,&quot; the equivalent of the German staff college during the Weimar Republic, and in June 1935 he graduated as second in his class. The following month he was promoted to captain and assigned to the &quot;Troop Office,&quot; or what was renamed the German General Staff in 1936. During his early years on the General Staff, in October 1936 he was assigned to the Operations Section, and in the following year he was reassigned to the Fortifications Section. In November 1938 Gehlen was again posted to an artillery regiment.

==Second World War==
At the time of the Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland in September 1939, Gehlen was a major and an operations staff officer in the 213th Infantry Division. It was mobilized for the Polish campaign but did not see any action, being held in reserve. He was still awarded the Iron Cross, second class. In late 1939 he was transferred to the staff of General Franz Halder, the Chief of the &quot;Oberkommando des Heeres&quot; (OKH), the Army High Command. In his early work, Gehlen was once again planning the construction of fortifications, both along the Soviet border and in the west. Halder increasingly relied on Gehlen during the spring of 1940 and he became one of Halder&#x27;s main assistants. Gehlen was sent as his liaison officer to several German units that were involved in the Battle of France in May 1940 (the 16th Army and the Panzer Group), and in October of that year he was assigned to the Eastern Group of the Operations Section, led by Colonel Adolf Heusinger. Heusinger—who incidentally would later work with Gehlen after the war, as the first head of the West German Bundeswehr—also recognized Gehlen&#x27;s talent as a staff officer.

From late 1940 Gehlen worked on operational planning for Germany&#x27;s movement east. That included the invasion and occupation of Greece and Yugoslavia, as well as the preparations for Operation Barbarossa. In February 1941 Gehlen was described in a report by his superiors as &quot;a fine example of a general staff officer ... Great operational ability and a great deal of foresight in his thinking.&quot; He was also noted to be very hardworking. His role in Barbarossa was mainly planning for the difficulties of bringing reserves up to the front, separating the areas of the army groups and armies in the invasion, and arranging transportation. For this work Gehlen was awarded the War Merit Cross, first and second classes, in the spring of 1941.

As Operation Barbarossa began and the Red Army continued to fight despite its losses, Halder became upset at his intelligence department for not informing him of the true extent of Soviet military capabilities. In late 1941 Gehlen was being considered to replace Colonel Eberhard Kinzel as the head of Foreign Armies East (&quot;Fremde Heere Ost&quot;, FHO), the Army Staff section responsible for analyzing the Soviet Union, on the recommendation of Colonel Heusinger. Halder was dissatisfied with Kinzel&#x27;s performance and was looking for a replacement, though he thought that the 40-year old Gehlen was too young for such an important role and had no previous intelligence background. Heusinger believed that Gehlen was a good manager, and on his advice, Gehlen was appointed the head of FHO on 1 April 1942.

=== Head of FHO ===

In spring of 1942, Lieutenant Colonel Gehlen assumed command of the Foreign Armies East (FHO) after the dismissal of Colonel Kinzel. Prior to that he had little intelligence experience, though he did have interactions with military intelligence, the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, during his earlier work at the Army High Command, to the point where he received a warning for meddling too much in the affairs of that agency.

Before the Wehrmacht disasters in the Battle of Stalingrad (23 August 1942 – 2 February 1943), a year into the German war against the Soviet Union, Gehlen understood that the FHO required fundamental re-organization, and secured a staff of army linguists and geographers, anthropologists, lawyers, and junior military officers who would improve the FHO as a military-intelligence organization despite the Nazi ideology of Slavic inferiority.

=== Max Network ===
Gehlen made great use of cables received from the Max Network. Originally an Abwehr creation, Max was one of the primary sources of FHO intelligence on the Soviet Military. Based in Sofia, Max - the Klatt Bureau (Dienststelle Klatt) was led by a Viennese Jew, Richard Kauder and included many other Jews as radio operators. Max cables were highly accurate, and amounted to 10,700 cables from 1942–44, causing a British warning – Ultra intercepted the Max cables – to Stalin regarding a high-placed mole in Stavka. When the cables continued, the British suspected a Soviet operation but later dismissed that idea upon investigation. The cables are available to be read upon purchase from the British archives at cost. The fact remains that aside from several instances of possible Soviet disinformation, most of the Max cables contained extremely accurate intelligence. Max was a big reason for the rise of Gehlen&#x27;s career, and he leveraged the &quot;success of Max&quot; into a spymaster&#x27;s reputation and a postwar career. Possible Soviet penetration of Max would parallel and be a strong contributor for the thorough Soviet penetration of NTS and the Gehlen Organization. 

==== True Allegiances ====
During the war some German officers attempted to trace the mechanics of Kauder&#x27;s networks, and never found a satisfactory explanation. Nevertheless, the information was so potent that FHO refused to allow any tainting of their golden source. 

After the war, the Allies interrogated Kauder and his associates and promptly concluded that the Soviets ran the entire Max operation, and that Kauder was not a professional spy but merely allowed himself to be the figurehead relaying information he received from his NKVD contacts and sources. However, the Max information was accurate, and both the NKVD and Smersh later investigated the Max network. It is possible that Stalin kept Max away from the regular organizational structures, which he never fully trusted. 

It is argued that the accuracy of the Max reports were the bait that caused the FHO overreliance on Max – to the extent that Nazi officials defied Hitler&#x27;s explicit directive to stop working with Kauder the Jew. This information was the bait that may have carried costs for the Soviets but was worth the payoff when it was later used as part of the Soviet Maskirovka Strategy to trap the Wehrmacht in Stalingrad, Kursk, and the Summer Offensive of 1944 (Operation Bagration). Many of the Jews who stayed alive working for Kauder later moved to Israel. Ageing Israelis have made the claim &quot;a handful of Jews won World War Two&quot; — slightly legitimate if Max caused the downfall of the German effort in the east, where most of the German army were destroyed. 

On the other hand, Max cables clearly warned FHO regarding Operation Mars, a terrible defeat for the Red Army. This caused the British to conclude that it was impossible for Max to be a Soviet operation. However, the British may have been blinded by western ideals regarding acceptable costs of national sacrifice. 

The Max Network is one of the unsolved mysteries of the war, with Kauder&#x27;s loyalties and sources of information still unclear.

==== Max beginnings ====
Kauder was born in Vienna in 1900. Provided a Pacifist upbringing by his father, Kauder became a lifelong self-declared pacifist. His time in Vienna was marked by associations and friendships with idealists, some communist, some socialist, and some zionist. Some were future spies, like Kim Philby – then with his Jewish and NKVD agent-wife Litzi Friedman. Also present then were Harry Peter Smollet – then Hans Peter Smolka, Ehud Avriel and Teddy Kollek. Teddy Kollek&#x27;s career in Israeli intelligence saw him informing the CIA of Philby&#x27;s communist activism, but was told by James Angleton to keep the information to himself. Ehud Avriel&#x27;s connections to Kauder were instrumental in the Maxwell - Czechoslovakia weapons deal of 1948. Kauder himself was later considered by the CIA to be working with Israeli intelligence. 

Smollet introduced Kauder to Otto Hatz, a Hungarian intelligence officer, who later introduced him to Momotaro Enomoto, a Japanese journalist for the well-known newspaper &quot;Mainishi Shimbun&quot;. Enomoto believed in pro-communist anarchism, and was himself friends with Smollet. Enomoto&#x27;s journalist passport which allowed him to travel freely between Budapest, Vienna and Berlin. He had friends among the German elite and had unrestricted access to all Japanese ambassadors to Europe. However, he was expelled from Turkey for being a collaborator of the Japanese military attache, for whom he conducted some investigations in Turkey. 

In January, 1940, Kauder was called into a meeting with Abwehr officers in Vienna. At the advice of Enomoto and Hatz he went into what he thought would be a trap for a Jew like him. Colonel Rudolf von Marogna-Redwitz, head of the Vienna station, asked him to head to Sofia and run their intelligence operations there through a cover of a Japanese news service. Sofia was chosen being the only Axis country that continued to have diplomatic relationships with the Soviet Union, and the huge staff of the Soviet Embassy in Sofia included NKVD agents. He informed Kauder that the idea of the Sofia base and that Kauder should run it was all from Enomoto. Although Kauder did charge for his services, he was also promised Abwehr protection for his Jewish mother. The Abwehr gave him the codename Fritz Klatt. Arriving in Sofia in 1940, he was soon after joined by both Enomoto and Hatz.

Kauder was sent initially to collect intelligence on the Bulgarian Air Force, but reported that he made contact with anti-communist Ukrainian emigre groups, who still had vast connections in Ukraine and southern Russia. the Nazis were impressed and reported it up the chain of command, who promptly approved the establishment of Kauder&#x27;s network. In reality, a Japanese international news service was something the Japanese and the Nazis had been working towards for awhile. Enomoto – a well placed Japanese communist loosely in the employ of Japanese Intelligence seems to have learned of this from both Japanese sources and by overhearing a conversation. Max was thus the Soviet counterstroke. Kauder&#x27;s network was kept secret apart from a few Abwehr officers, and was stowed away in Abwehr 2, and not in Abwehr 1 where spies belong. Kauder&#x27;s cables were actually split into Max and Moritz, with Moritz focusing on the Mediterranean front. The Moritz cables are considered to have been much less accurate than the Soviet-focused Max cables.

The German decision to launch Max (and pay Kauder&#x27;s hefty fees) was taken by Abwehr Director Wilhelm Canaris, who was one of the few Germans involved in the secretive joint venture with the Japanese. Otto Wagner, The initial supervisor of Kauder, was not trusted by the secretive Canaris and was not read in on the Japanese connection and how a Jew came to be implausibly working for the Nazis. Wagner would make many luckless attempts at figuring out the Kauder network, which he did not fully trust. 

On May 6, 1940, Kauder brought two of his Ukrainian contacts, namely Prince Anton Turkul and Ira Longin (Ilya Longa) to meet the Abwehr officers. Turkul said he had previously worked with British intelligence, and was handled by Dickie Ellis. Turkul also informed them that he had already put his NTS network into existence. Turkul&#x27;s past work for MI6 went a long way in establishing his credibility with the Abwehr. 

Enomoto then took Kauder to Salonika to meet NKVD officer Nahum Eitingon aboard a Russian Merchant Ship in the port. Eitingon informed Kauder that going forward he would be the only one to have any contact with the Germans. Eitingon promised Kauder personal protection. It was at this time that Kauder realized that his network was really a Soviet operation.

==== Max Operation ====
Max was probably the most sophisticated radio operation in World War Two:&quot;Kauder now had skilled German radio operators at his disposal. He also formed his own team [of Jews] that worked with the radio operators and managed detailed records of all messages. Each message was assigned a serial number, which tracked its number within the series of messages; and a secondary catalogue number that indicated the region and location that the message referred to. The messages were also filed by date, which was of no less importance. It was an incredibly efficient and well-organized system. If asked what exactly was reported about a specific city or region, or what was reported on a specific date, Kauder could retrieve the message instantly, using his simple, intelligent and efficient filing method. 

=== Dismissal, 1945 ===
Gehlen&#x27;s cadre of FHO intelligence-officers produced accurate field-intelligence about the Red Army that frequently contradicted Nazi Party ideological perceptions of the eastern battle front. Hitler dismissed the gathered information as defeatism and philosophically harmful to the war effort against &quot;Judeo-Bolshevism&quot; in Russia. In April 1945, despite the accuracy of the intelligence, Hitler dismissed Gehlen, soon after his promotion to major general.

=== Preparation for Post-War ===
The FHO collection of both military and political intelligence from captured Red Army soldiers assured Gehlen&#x27;s post–WWII survival as a Western anticommunist spymaster, with networks of spies and secret agents in the countries of Soviet-occupied Europe. During the German war against the Soviet Union in 1941 to 1945, Gehlen&#x27;s FHO collected much tactical military intelligence about the Red Army, and much strategic political intelligence about the Soviet Union. Understanding that the Soviet Union would defeat and occupy the Third Reich, Gehlen ordered the FHO intelligence files copied to microfilm; the FHO files proper were stored in watertight drums and buried in various locations in the Austrian Alps.

They amounted to fifty cases of German intelligence about the Soviet Union, which were at Gehlen&#x27;s disposal as a bargaining tool with the intelligence services of the Western Allies. Meanwhile, as of 1946, when Joseph Stalin consolidated his absolute power and control over Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe as agreed at the Potsdam Conference of 1945 and demarcated with what became known as the Iron Curtain, the Western Allies of World War II, the U.S, Britain, and France had no sources of covert information within the countries in which the occupying Red Army had vanquished the Wehrmacht.

== Cold War==

On 22 May 1945, Gehlen surrendered to the Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) of the U.S. Army in Bavaria and was taken to Camp King, near Oberursel, and interrogated by Captain John R. Boker. The American Army recognised his potential value as a spymaster with great knowledge of Soviet forces and anticommunist intelligence contacts in the Soviet Union. In exchange for his own liberty and the release of his former subordinates (also prisoners of the US Army), Gehlen offered the Counter Intelligence Corps access to the FHO&#x27;s intelligence archives and to his intelligence gathering abilities aimed at the Soviet Union, known later as the Gehlen Organization. Boker removed his name and those of his Wehrmacht command from the official lists of German prisoners of war, and transferred seven former FHO senior officers to join Gehlen.
The FHO archives were unearthed and secretly taken to Camp King, ostensibly without the knowledge of the camp commander. By the end of summer 1945, Captain Boker had the support of Brigadier General Edwin Sibert, the senior G2 (intelligence) officer of the U.S. Twelfth Army Group, who arranged the secret transport of Gehlen, his officers and the FHO intelligence archives, authorized by his superiors in the chain of command, General Walter Bedell Smith (chief of staff for General Eisenhower), who worked with William Donovan (former OSS chief) and Allen Dulles (OSS chief), who also was the OSS station-chief in Bern. On 20 September 1945, Gehlen and three associates were flown from the American Zone of Occupation in Germany to the US, to become spymasters for the Western Allies.

In July 1946, the US officially released Gehlen and returned him to occupied Germany. On 6 December 1946, he began espionage operations against the Soviet Union, by establishing what was known to US intelligence as the Gehlen Organization or &quot;the Org&quot;, a secret intelligence service composed of former intelligence officers of the Wehrmacht and members of the SS and the SD, which was headquartered first at Oberursel, near Frankfurt, then at Pullach, near Munich. The organization&#x27;s cover-name was the South German Industrial Development Organization. Gehlen initially selected 350 ex-Wehrmacht military intelligence officers as his staff; eventually, the organization recruited some 4,000 anticommunist secret agents.

=== Gehlen Organization, 1947–56 ===

After he started working for the U.S. Government, Gehlen was subordinate to US Army G-2 (Intelligence). He resented this arrangement and in 1947, the year after his Organization was established, Gehlen arranged for a transfer to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The agency kept close control of the Gehlen Organization, because during the early years of the Cold War of 1945–91, Gehlen&#x27;s agents were providing the United States Federal Government with more than 70% of its intelligence on the Soviet armed forces.

Early in 1948, Gehlen Org Spymasters began receiving detailed reports from their sources throughout the Soviet Zone of covert East German remilitarization long before any West German politicians had even thought of such a thing. Further operations by the Gehlen Org produced detailed reports about Soviet construction and testing of the MiG-15 jet-propelled aircraft, which United States airmen flying F-86 fighters would soon to face in aerial combat during the Korean War.
Between 1947 and 1955, the Gehlen Organization also debriefed every German PoW who returned to West Germany from captivity in the Soviet GULAG. The network employed hundreds of former Wehrmacht military intelligence and some SS officers, and also recruited many other agents from within the massive anti-Communist ethnic German, Soviet, and East European refugee communities throughout Western Europe. They were accordingly able to develop detailed maps of the railroad systems, airfields, and ports of the USSR, and the Org&#x27;s field agents even infiltrated the Baltic Soviet Republics and the Ukrainian SSR. 

Among the Org&#x27;s earliest counterespionage successes was Operation Bohemia, which began in March 1948 after Božena Hájková, the sister in law of Czechoslovak military intelligence officer Captain Vojtěch Jeřábek, defected to the American Zone and applied for political asylum in the United States. After learning from Hájková that Captain Jeřábek was secretly expressing anti-communist opinions to his family, the Org dispatched a Czech refugee and veteran field agent codenamed &quot;Ondřej&quot; to make contact with the Captain and his family in Prague. During the night of 8-9 November 1948, after being warned by &quot;Ondřej&quot; of an imminent Stalinist witch hunt for &quot;rootless cosmopolitans&quot; within the Czechoslovak officer corps, Captain Jeřábek and two other senior military intelligence officers crossed the border into the American Zone and defected to the West. In addition to several lists of Czechoslovakian spies in West Germany, Captain Jeřábek also carried the keys to breaking Czechoslovakian intelligence&#x27;s codes. The results were nothing less than devastating for Czechoslovakian espionage and led to multiple arrests and convictions.

The security and efficacy of the Gehlen Organization were compromised by East German and Soviet moles within it, such as Johannes Clemens, Erwin Tiebel and Heinz Felfe who were feeding information while in the Org and later, while in the BND that was headed by Gehlen. All three were eventually discovered and convicted in 1963.

There were also Communists and their sympathizers within the CIA and the SIS (MI6), especially Kim Philby and the Cambridge Spies. As such information appeared, Gehlen, personally, and the Gehlen Organization, officially, were attacked by the governments of the Western powers. The British government was especially hostile towards Gehlen, and the politically Left wing British press ensured full publicisation of the existence of the Gehlen Organization, which further compromised the operation.

=== Federal Intelligence Service (BND), 1956–1968 ===

On 1 April 1956, 11 years after World War II had ended, the U.S. Government and the CIA formally transferred the Gehlen Organization to the authority of what was by then the Federal Republic of Germany, under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer (1949–63). By way of that transfer of geopolitical sponsorship, the anti–Communist Gehlen Organization became the nucleus of the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND, Federal Intelligence Service).

Gehlen was the president of the BND as an espionage service until his retirement in 1968. The end of Gehlen&#x27;s career as a spymaster resulted from a confluence of events in West Germany: the exposure of a KGB mole, Heinz Felfe, (a former SS lieutenant) working at BND headquarters; political estrangement from Adenauer, in 1963, which aggravated his professional problems; and the inefficiency of the BND consequent to Gehlen&#x27;s poor leadership and continual inattention to the business of counter-espionage as national defence.

According to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; journalists Heinz Höhne and Hermann Zolling, the premature end of the German colonial empire in 1918 placed West Germany&#x27;s new foreign intelligence service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst at a considerable advantage in dealing with the newly independent governments of post-colonial Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. This is why many Third World military and foreign intelligence services were largely trained by BND military advisors. This made it possible for the BND to easily receive accurate intelligence in these regions which the CIA and former colonialist intelligence services could not acquire without recruiting local spy rings. BND covert activities in the Third World also laid the groundwork for friendly relations that Gehlen attempted to use to steer local governments into taking an anti-Soviet and Pro-NATO stance during the ongoing Cold War and further assisted the West German economic miracle by both encouraging and favoring West German trade and corporate investment. 

Gehlen&#x27;s refusal to correct reports with questionable content strained the organization&#x27;s credibility, and dazzling achievements became an infrequent commodity. A veteran agent remarked at the time that the BND pond then contained some sardines, though a few years earlier the pond had been alive with sharks.

The fact that the BND could score certain successes despite East German Stasi interference, internal malpractice, inefficiencies and infighting, was primarily due to select members of the staff who took it upon themselves to step up and overcome then existing maladies. Abdication of responsibility by Reinhard Gehlen was the malignancy; bureaucracy and cronyism remained pervasive, even nepotism (at one time Gehlen had 16 members of his extended family on the BND payroll). Only slowly did the younger generation then advance to substitute new ideas for some of the bad habits caused mainly by Gehlen&#x27;s semi-retired attitude and frequent holiday absences.

Gehlen was forced out of the BND due to &quot;political scandal within the ranks&quot;, according to one source, He retired in 1968 as a civil servant of West Germany, classified as a &quot;Ministerialdirektor&quot;, a senior grade with a generous pension. His successor, Bundeswehr Brigadier General Gerhard Wessel, immediately called for a program of modernization and streamlining.

== Criticism ==
Several publications have criticized the fact that Gehlen allowed former Nazis to work for the agencies. The authors of the book &quot;A Nazi Past: Recasting German Identity in Postwar Europe&quot; (2015) stated that Reinhard Gehlen simply did not want to know the backgrounds of the men whom the BND hired in the 1950s. The American National Security Archive states that &quot;he employed numerous former Nazis and known war criminals&quot;.

An article in &quot;The Independent&quot; on 29 June 2018 made this statement about BND employees: &quot;Operating until 1956, when it was superseded by the BND, the Gehlen Organization was allowed to employ at least 100 former Gestapo or SS officers... Among them were Adolf Eichmann’s deputy Alois Brunner, who would go on to die of old age despite having sent more than 100,000 Jews to ghettos or internment camps, and ex-SS major Emil Augsburg... Many ex-Nazi functionaries including Silberbauer, the captor of Anne Frank, transferred over from the Gehlen Organization to the BND... Instead of expelling them, the BND even seems to have been willing to recruit more of them – at least for a few years&quot;.

On the other hand, Gehlen himself was cleared by the CIA&#x27;s James H. Critchfield, who worked with the Gehlen Organization from 1949 to 1956. In 2001, he said that &quot;almost everything negative that has been written about Gehlen, [as an] ardent ex-Nazi, one of Hitler&#x27;s war criminals ... is all far from the fact,&quot; as quoted in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;. Critchfield added that Gehlen hired the former Sicherheitsdienst (Security Service of the Reichsführer-SS) men &quot;reluctantly, under pressure from German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer to deal with &#x27;the avalanche of subversion hitting them from East Germany&#x27;&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Gehlen&#x27;s memoirs were published in 1977 by World Publishers, New York. In the same year another book was published about him, &quot;The General Was a Spy,&quot; by Heinz Hoehne and Herman Zolling, Coward, McCann and Geoghegan, New York. A review of the latter, published by the CIA in 1996, calls it a &quot;poor book&quot; and goes on to allege that &quot;so much of it is sheer garbage&quot; because of many errors. The CIA review also discusses another book, &quot;Gehlen, Spy of the Century&quot;, by E. H. Cookridge, Hodder and Stoughton, London, 1971, and claims that it is &quot;chock full of errors&quot;. The CIA review is kinder when speaking of Gehlen&#x27;s memoirs but makes this comment: &quot;Gehlen&#x27;s descriptions of most of his so-called successes in the political intelligence field are, in my opinion, either wishful thinking or self-delusion... Gehlen was never a good clandestine operator, nor was he a particularly good administrator. And therein lay his failures. The Gehlen Organization/BND always had a good record in the collection of military and economic intelligence on East Germany and the Soviet forces there. But this information, for the most part, came from observation and not from clandestine penetration&quot;.Upon Gehlen&#x27;s retirement in 1968, a CIA note on Gehlen describes him as &quot;essentially a military officer in habits and attitudes&quot;. He was also characterized as &quot;essentially a conservative&quot;, who refrained from entertaining and drinking, was fluent in English, and was at ease among senior American officials.

==In popular culture==
In the 2023 political thriller TV series &quot;Bonn&quot; (German: &quot;Bonn – Alte Freunde, neue Feinde&quot;), set in Germany in 1954 and aired in Das Erste, Gehlen is played by Martin Wuttke.

<doc id="893147" wikidata="Q8628" url="?curid=893147" title="War in the Vendée">
<text>The War in the Vendée () was a counter-revolutionary insurrection that took place in the Vendée region of France from 1793 to 1796, during the French Revolution. The Vendée is a coastal region, located immediately south of the river Loire in western France. Initially, the revolt was similar to the 14th-century Jacquerie peasant uprising, but the Vendée quickly became counter-revolutionary and Royalist. The revolt was comparable to the Chouannerie, which took place concurrently in the area north of the Loire.

While elsewhere in France the revolts against the were repressed, an insurgent territory, called the by historians, formed south of the Loire-Inférieure (Brittany), south-west of Maine-et-Loire (Anjou), north of Vendée and north-west of Deux-Sèvres (Poitou). Gradually referred to as the &quot;Vendeans&quot;, the insurgents established in April a &quot;Catholic and Royal Army&quot; which won a succession of victories in the spring and summer of 1793. The rebels briefly overran the towns of Fontenay-le-Comte, Thouars, Saumur and Angers, but were halted at the Battle of Nantes.

During the autumn, the arrival of the Army of Mainz as reinforcements restored the advantage to the Republican camp, which in October seized Cholet, the most important city controlled by the Vendeans. After this defeat, the bulk of the Vendée forces crossed the Loire and marched to Normandy in a desperate attempt to take a port to obtain the help of the British and the . Pushed back to Granville, the Vendée army was finally destroyed in December at Mans and Savenay. From the winter of 1793 to the spring of 1794, during the Reign of Terror, violent repression was put in place by the Republican forces. In the cities, and in particular in Nantes and Angers, around 15,000 people were shot, drowned or guillotined on the orders of the and Revolutionary Military Commissions, while in the countryside about 20,000 to 50,000 civilians were massacred by the infernal columns, who set fire to many towns and villages.

The repression provoked a resurgence of the rebellion and in December 1794 the Republicans began negotiations which led between February and May 1795 to the signing of peace treaties with the various Vendée leaders, thus bringing about the end of the &quot;first Vendée war&quot;. A &quot;second Vendée war&quot; broke out shortly afterwards, in June 1795, after the start of the Quiberon expedition. The uprising quickly ran out of steam and the last Vendée leaders submitted or were executed between January and July 1796. The Vendée still experienced last and brief uprisings with a third war in 1799, a fourth in 1815 and a fifth in 1832, but they were on a much smaller scale. The number of victims is estimated at 200,000 dead, including approximately 170,000 for the inhabitants of the military Vendée, i.e. between 20 and 25% of the population of the insurgent territory.

==Background==

In the rural Vendée, the local nobility seems to have been more permanently in power than in other parts of France. Alexis de Tocqueville, of France, noted that most French nobles lived in cities by 1789. An Intendants&#x27; survey showed one of the few areas where the nobility still lived with the peasants was the Vendée. In this particularly-isolated feudal stronghold, the class conflict that drove the revolution in Paris and other parts of France was further suppressed by the institutional strength of the Catholic Church in alliance with the nobility. Counter-Enlightenment author Francois Mignet accused that militant Republicans wanted to destroy both the independence and influence of the Catholic Church in France, which the people of the Vendée considered unimaginable.

In 1791, two representatives on mission informed the National Assembly that the Vendée was being mobilized against the First French Republic, and this news was swiftly followed by the exposure of an alleged royalist conspiracy organized by the Marquis de la Rouërie. Subsequent defenders of the Vendée rebels argue that this plotting against the Republic was an understandable response to The Terror (a period between 1793 and 1794 where thousands of both real and suspected dissidents were beheaded by guillotine), the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790) and the introduction of conscription upon the whole of France, decreed by the National Convention in February 1793.

In what Max Weber later dubbed Caesaropapism, the Civil Constitution of the Clergy required all Roman Catholic priests to transfer their allegiance from the Holy See to the Constitution and, by extension, to the increasingly anti-clerical and anti-Catholic National Constituent Assembly of the Republic. All but seven of the 160 French bishops refused to take the oath, as did about half of the parish priests. Anti-clericalism and coercive secularization of French culture triggered the Vendée belligerence; another trigger was further mass conscription into the French Revolutionary Army. The March 1793 conscription requiring Vendeans to fill their district&#x27;s quota of the national total of 300,000 enraged the local nobility, clergy, and the populace, who took up arms instead as &quot;The Catholic Army&quot;, &quot;Royal&quot; being added later, and fought for &quot;above all the reopening of their parish churches with their former priests.&quot;

Although town dwellers were more likely to support the Revolution in the Vendée, there was some support for the Revolution among the rural peasantry. Some Vendean peasants had lived as tenant farmers on Church-owned farmland, and they overwhelmingly embraced the Revolution after all Church lands were seized and redistributed by the Republican government. Counter-Enlightenment historians have argued that local feudalism had primarily protected the peasantry. They cite the fact that over the 100 years of struggle to impose republicanism upon France, the middle class were the primary beneficiaries. Nearly all the purchasers of former Church land were members of the bourgeoisie and very few peasants benefited from the confiscation and sales.

==Outbreak of revolt==

There were other levy riots across France when regions started to draft men into the army in response to the Levy Decree in February 1793. The reaction in the northwest in early March was particularly pronounced with large-scale rioting verging on insurrection. By early April, in areas north of the Loire, order had been restored by the revolutionary government, but south of the Loire in four departments that became known as the there were few troops to control rebels and what had started as rioting quickly took on the form of a full insurrection led by priests and the local nobility.

Within a few weeks the Royalist forces had formed a substantial, ill-equipped, army, the &quot;Royal and Catholic Army&quot;, supported by two thousand irregular cavalry and a few captured artillery pieces. The main force of the Royalist operated on a much smaller scale, using guerrilla tactics, supported by the insurgents&#x27; local knowledge and social networks.

===Geographic coverage===
Geographically, the insurrection occurred within a rough quadrilateral approximately wide. The territory defied description in the terms of the redistricting of 1790, nor did it align itself to descriptors used in the &quot;Ancien régime&quot;; the heart of the movement lay in the forests, with Cholet at its center, in the wild districts of the old county of Anjou, in the Breton marshlands between Montaigu and the sea. It included parts of the old Poitiers and Tours, the departements of Maine-et-Loire, the Vendée, and Deux Sèvres, but never completely fell under Royalist control. The further the land was from Paris (the seat of revolutionary power), the more Counter-revolutionary belligerence occurred.

==Vendée military response==
The insurrection began in March 1793, as a rejection of the mass conscription edict. In February, the National Convention had voted to approve a levy of three hundred thousand men, to be chosen by lot among the unmarried men in each commune. Thus, the arrival of recruiters reminded locals of the methods of the monarchy, aroused resistance in the countryside, and set in motion the first serious signs of sedition. Much of this opposition was quelled quickly, but in the lower Loire, in the and in the Vendean bocage, the situation was more serious and more protracted. Youths from communes surrounding Cholet, a large textile town on the boundary between the two regions, invaded the town and killed the commander of the National Guard, a &quot;patriotic&quot; (pro-revolutionary) manufacturer. Within a week, violence had spread to the Breton marshlands; peasants overran the town of Machecoul on 11 March, and several hundred Republican citizens were massacred. A large band of peasants under the leadership of Jacques Cathelineau and Jean-Nicolas Stofflet seized Saint-Florent-le-Vieil on 12 March. By mid-March, a minor revolt against conscription had turned into full-fledged insurrection.

The Republic was quick to respond, dispatching over 45,000 troops to the area. The first pitched battle was on the night of 19 March. A Republican column of 2,000, under general Louis Henri François de Marcé, moving from La Rochelle to Nantes, was intercepted north of Chantonnay near the Gravereau bridge (Saint-Vincent-Sterlanges), over the river le Petit-Lay. After six hours of fighting, rebel reinforcements arrived and routed the Republican forces. In the north, on 22 March, another Republican force was routed near Chalonnes-sur-Loire.

===Battle of Bressuire===
There followed a series of skirmishes and armed contacts. On 3 May 1793, Bressuire fell to Vendéen forces led by Henri de la Rochejaquelein.

===Battle of Thouars===
On 5 May 1793, the main clash took place on the &quot;Pont de Vrine&quot;, the bridge over the stream leading into Thouars. The Vendéens proved unable to take the bridge for six hours, until Louis Marie de Lescure (fighting in his first battle) showed himself alone on the bridge under enemy fire and encouraged his men to follow him, which they did, crossing the bridge. The Republicans there were taken from behind by the cavalry under Charles de Bonchamps, which had crossed the river at a ford. Despite the arrival of reinforcements, the Republicans were routed and withdrew towards the city. The insurgents, headed by Henri de La Rochejacquelein, took the rampart by force and poured into the city, and the Republican troops quickly capitulated. The Vendéens seized a large amount of arms and gunpowder, but allowed the captured Republican forces to leave, after having sworn to no longer fight in the Vendée and had their hair shaved off so they could be recognised lest they went back on their word and were recaptured.

===Battle of Fontenay-le-Comte===
On 25 May 1793 the Catholic and royalist army took Fontenay-le-Comte. Lescure led his men in a courageous charge under enemy fire, shouting &#x27;Long live the king!&#x27; and braving cannon fire, which left him unharmed. Likewise La Rochejacquelein wore his distinctive three red handkerchiefs on his head, waist and neck even though the gunners in the Republican forces were aiming for them. Following the victory his friends decided to copy him and all decided to wear three red handkerchiefs too so that La Rochejacquelein could not be distinguished by the enemy in the future. After this the only Vendée towns remaining in the control of the Republic were Nantes and Les Sables d&#x27;Olonne.

===Battle of Saumur===
On 9 June 1793, Vendean insurgents commanded by Jacques Cathelineau captured the town of Saumur from Louis-Alexandre Berthier. The victory gave the insurgents a massive supply of arms, including 50 cannons. This was the high point of the insurgency. The Vendeans had never before attempted to take such a large town, and they captured it in a single day, inflicting heavy losses on its Republican defenders. Many prisoners were taken, some of whom went over to the Vendean cause, while many of the citizens fled to Tours.
===Battle of Nantes===
On 24 June 1793, the commanders of the Catholic and royalist army issued an ultimatum to the mayor of Nantes, Baco de la Chapelle to surrender the city or they would massacre the garrison. On 29 June, they began an assault with a force of 40,000. Inside the city were Republicans from the surrounding countryside who had fled to Nantes for safety, fortifying the defenders with tales of the horrors that the rebels inflicted on towns they managed to take. Baco de la Chapelle stood on a dustcart that he called the &quot;chariot of victory&quot; to urge the people on, even after he had been wounded in the leg. Poor coordination between the four Vendean armies led by Charette, Bonchamps, Cathelineau and Lyrot hampered the assault, and Cathelineau&#x27;s forces were delayed in their deployment by fighting along the river Erdre with a Republican battalion. Cathelineau himself was shot at the head of his forces, causing his men to lose heart and retreat; ultimately, the Vendeans were unable to take the city. In October 1793, to punish the Vendean prisoners taken after the failure of the siege of Nantes, Jean-Baptiste Carrier ordered them to be shot en masse. When this proved impractical, he had the prisoners rounded up and put out on the river Loire in boats equipped with trap-door bottoms; when these opened the victims were left to drown. On this occasion it was rumored that female prisoners were stripped and tied up with men before being sent to their deaths, the so-called Republican Marriage. Some later historians dispute this story as a counter-revolutionary myth.

===First Battle of Châtillon===
On 5 July 1793, the First Battle of Châtillon took place at Châtillon-sur-Sèvre near the commune of Mauléon. In that action, Marquis de la Rochejaquelein commanding 20,000 Vendean Royalists attacked a French Republican force led by General François Joseph Westermann. The Vendean Royalists were victorious, killing and wounding 5,000 French Republicans. Among those killed in the battle was French Republican General Chambon.
===Battle of Vihiers===
The Vendeans won a victory over the revolutionary army led by Santerre at the Battle of Vihiers on 18 July 1793.

===Battle of Luçon===
The Battle of Luçon was actually a series of three engagements fought over four weeks, the first on 15 July and the last on 14 August 1793, between Republican forces under Augustin Tuncq and Vendean forces. The engagement on 14 August, fought near the town of Luçon was actually the conclusion of three engagements between Maurice d&#x27;Elbée&#x27;s Vendean insurgents and the Republican army. On 15 July, Claude Sandoz and a garrison of 800 had repulsed 5,000 insurgents led by d&#x27;Elbee; on 28 July, Tuncq drove off a second attempt; two weeks later, Tuncq and his 5,000 men routed 30,000 insurgents under the personal command of François de Charette.

===Battle of Montaigu===
The Battle of Montaigu was fought on 21 September 1793 when the Vendéens attacked general Jean-Michel Beysser&#x27;s French Republican division. Taken by surprise, this division fought back but lost 400 men, including many captured. Some of these prisoners were summarily executed by the Vendeens and their bodies later found in the castle wells by troops under Jean-Baptiste Kléber.
===Second Battle of Tiffauges===
The Battle of Tiffauges was fought on 19 September 1793 between Royalist military leaders against Republican troops under Jean-Baptiste Kléber and Canclaux.

===Second Battle of Châtillon===
On 11 October 1793, the Second Battle of Châtillon took place at Châtillon-sur-Sèvre near the commune of Mauléon. In that action, a Vendean Royalist force led by Louis Marie de Lescure and Charles de Bonchamps skirmished with a column of French Republican soldiers from the Coasts of La Rochelle Army. The Republican force commanded by Alexis Chalbos was routed by the Vendean Royalists. Later in the evening of the same day, François Joseph Westermann led a Republican raiding party and attacked the Vendean encampment inflicting losses upon the rebel fighters and non-combatants. The next day the Vendean Royalists withdrew toward Mortagne-sur-Sèvre.

===Battle of Tremblaye===
The Battle of Tremblaye (15 October 1793) took place near Cholet during the war in the Vendée, and was a Republican victory over the Vendéens. The Vendean leader Lescure was seriously injured in the fighting.

===Defeat (October–December 1793)===

On 1 August 1793, the Committee of Public Safety ordered Jean-Baptiste Carrier to carry out a &quot;pacification&quot; of the region by complete physical destruction. These orders were not carried out immediately, but a steady stream of demands for total destruction persisted.

The Republican army was reinforced, benefiting from the first men of the &quot;levée en masse&quot; and reinforcements from Mainz. The Vendean army had its first serious defeat at the Battle of Cholet on 17 October; worse for the rebels, their army was split. In October 1793 the main force, commanded by Henri de la Rochejaquelein and numbering some 25,000 (followed by thousands of civilians of all ages), crossed the Loire, headed for the port of Granville where they expected to be greeted by a British fleet and an army of exiled French nobles. Arriving at Granville, they found the city surrounded by Republican forces, with no British ships in sight. Their attempts to take the city were unsuccessful. During the retreat, the extended columns fell prey to Republican forces; suffering from hunger and disease, they died in the thousands. The force was defeated in the last, decisive Battle of Savenay on 23 December. Among those executed the following day was lieutenant-general Jacques Alexis de Verteuil, but some historians assert that after the battle of Savenay the rebellion was still going on.

After the Battle of Savenay (December 1793), in a document whose authenticity is disputed, General Westermann reported to his political masters at the convention: &quot;The Vendée is no more ... According to your orders, I have trampled their children beneath our horses&#x27; feet; I have massacred their women, so they will no longer give birth to brigands. I do not have a single prisoner to reproach me. I have exterminated them all.&quot; Such killing of civilians would have been an explicit violation of the convention&#x27;s orders to Westermann.
and several thousand living Vendéan prisoners were being held by Westerman&#x27;s forces though when the letter was supposedly written.

==Aftermath of the first war and later revolts==

With the decisive Battle of Savenay (December 1793) came formal orders for forced evacuation; also, a &#x27;scorched earth&#x27; policy was initiated: farms were destroyed, crops and forests burned and villages razed. There were many reported atrocities and a campaign of mass killing universally aimed at residents of the Vendée regardless of combatant status, political affiliation, age or sex. One specific target were the women of the region. Since they were seen, in a way, that they were carrying anti-revolutionary babies, they were seen as primary targets.

From January to May 1794, 20,000 to 50,000 Vendean civilians were massacred by the &quot;colonnes infernales&quot; (&quot;infernal columns&quot;) of the general Louis Marie Turreau. Among those killed towards the end of the conflict were Blessed Guillaume Repin and 98 other religious figures, many of whom were later beatified by the Catholic Church. In Anjou, directed by Nicolas Hentz and Marie Pierre Adrien Francastel, Republicans captured 11,000 to 15,000 Vendeans, 6,500 to 7,000 were shot or guillotined and 2,000 to 2,200 prisoners died from disease.

Under orders from the Committee of Public Safety in February 1794, the Republican forces launched their final &quot;pacification&quot; effort (named or &quot;Vendée Avenged&quot;): twelve infernal columns under Louis Marie Turreau, marched through the Vendée. General Turreau inquired about &quot;the fate of the women and children I will encounter in rebel territory&quot;, stating that, if it was &quot;necessary to pass them all by sword&quot;, he would require a decree. In response, the Committee of Public Safety ordered him to &quot;eliminate the brigands to the last man, there is your duty...&quot;

The Convention issued conciliatory proclamations allowing the Vendeans liberty of worship and guaranteeing their property. General Hoche applied these measures with great success. He restored their cattle to the peasants who submitted, &quot;let the priests have a few crowns&quot;, and on 20 July 1795 annihilated an &quot;émigré&quot; expedition which had been equipped in England and had seized Fort Penthièvre and Quiberon. Treaties were concluded at La Jaunaye (15 February 1795) and at La Mabillaie, and were fairly well observed by the Vendeans; no obstacle remained but the feeble and scattered remnant of the Vendeans still under arms and the Chouans. On 16 July 1796, the Directory proclaimed the official end of the war. On 30 July the state of siege was raised in the western departments.

Estimates of those killed in the Vendean conflict—on both sides—range between 117,000 and 450,000, out of a population of around 800,000.

During the time of republican and imperial rule, the department name of &quot;Vendée&quot; was renamed &quot;Venge&quot;. Towns and cities were also renamed.

=== The Hundred Days ===

According to Theodore A. Dodge, the war in the Vendée lasted with intensity from 1793 to 1799, when it was suppressed, but later broke out spasmodically especially in 1813, 1814 and 1815. During Napoleon&#x27;s Hundred Days in 1815, some of the population of the Vendée remained loyal to Louis XVIII, forcing Napoleon—who was short of troops to fight the Waterloo Campaign—to send a force of 10,000 under the command of Jean Maximilien Lamarque to pacify the 8,000 Vendeans led by Pierre Constant Suzannet, which ended with the Battle of Rocheservière.

==Historiography==

This relatively brief episode in French history has left significant traces on French politics. The Vendée revolt became an immediate symbol of confrontation between revolution and counterrevolution, and a source of unexpurgated violence. 
Charles Tilly has claimed that the imposition of direct rule was the result of imposition by Paris of social and political changes: [The] West&#x27;s counterrevolution grew directly from the efforts of revolutionary officials to install a particular kind of direct rule in the region: a rule that practically eliminated nobles and priests from their positions as partly autonomous intermediaries, that brought the state&#x27;s demands for taxes, manpower, and deference to the level of individual communities, neighborhoods, and households that gave the region&#x27;s bourgeois political power they had never before wielded. In seeking to extend the state&#x27;s rule to every locality, and to dislodge all enemies of that rule, French revolutionaries started a process that did not cease for twenty-five years.
But other historians posit the insurrection as a revolt against conscription that cascaded to include other complaints. 

For a period of several months, control of the Vendée slipped from the hands of Parisian revolutionaries. They ascribed the revolt to the resurgence of royalist ideas: when faced with insurrection of the people against the Revolution of the People, they were unable to see it as anything &quot;but&quot; an aristocratic plot. Mona Ozouf and François Furet maintain it was not. The entire territory, none of it unified under a single idea from the , had never been a region morally at odds with the rest of the nation. It was not the fall of the old regime that aroused the population against the Revolution, but rather the construction of the new regime into locally unacceptable principles and forms: the new map of districts and departments, the administrative dictatorship, and above all the non-juring priests. Even the regicide did not trigger insurrection. What did was the forced conscription. Although the Vendeans, to use the term loosely, wrote God and King large on their flags, they invested those symbols of their tradition with something other than regret for the lost regime.

==Genocide controversy==
The popular historiography of the War in the Vendée is deeply rooted in the pervasive political polarisation within post-1789 French culture and historiography. As a result, scholarship on the uprising is generally lacking in objectivity, coming down strongly in defense of either the First French Republic or of the Vendéen rebels and the local Catholic Church. This conflict originated in the 19th century between two groups of historians. The &quot;Bleus&quot;, so-named for their defense of the French Revolutionary Army and who based their interpretations solely on documents from Republican sources. The &quot;Blancs&quot;, on the other hand, are so named in a denigrating reference to their continued membership in the Catholic Church in France, also based their findings on Republican archival documents, but also used eyewitness accounts, memoirs by survivors, and &quot;local oral histories&quot;. generally allege that the War in Vendée was not a popular uprising, but was the result of reactionary noble and priestly lies and manipulation of the local peasantry against their self-appointed liberators. One of the leaders of this school of history, Charles-Louis Chassin, published eleven volumes of letters, archives, and other materials in an effort to argue for this interpretation. Meanwhile, &quot;Les Blancs&quot; were at least sometimes Roman Catholic priests, local historians, or survivors of the pre-1789 local French nobility. They allege, on the other hand, that the Vendean peasant rebels were acting out of &quot;genuine love&quot; and loyalty towards individual local families of less wealthy and non-absentee landlords and, far more importantly, a desire to protect the Catholic Church from both religious persecution, the Reign of Terror, and coerced Caesaropapism at the hands of the First French Republic.

The Counter-Enlightenment interpretation by &quot;Les Blancs&quot; was widely popularized among the social conservatives throughout the Anglosphere during the Neoliberal era, with French historian Reynald Secher&#x27;s 1986 &quot;A French Genocide: The Vendée&quot;. Secher argued that the total war against the local population and the scorched earth tactics unleashed by both the Republican government and the French Revolutionary Army during the War in the Vendée were the first modern genocide. Secher&#x27;s claims caused a minor uproar in France among scholars of French history, as many mainstream authorities on the period—both French and foreign—published articles denouncing Secher&#x27;s allegations. Claude Langlois (of the Institute of History of the French Revolution) derides Secher&#x27;s claims as &quot;quasi-mythological&quot;. Timothy Tackett of the University of California summarizes the case as such: &quot;In reality ... the Vendée was a tragic civil war with endless horrors committed by both sides—initiated, in fact, by the rebels themselves. The Vendeans were no more blameless than were the republicans. The use of the word genocide is wholly inaccurate and inappropriate.&quot; Hugh Gough (Professor of history at University College Dublin) called Secher&#x27;s book an attempt at historical revisionism unlikely to have any lasting impact. While some such as Peter McPhee roundly criticized Secher, including the assertion of commonality between the functions of the Republican government and the totalitarianism of Stalinism, historian Pierre Chaunu expressed support for Secher&#x27;s views, describing the events as the first &quot;ideological genocide&quot;.
Critics of Secher&#x27;s thesis have also accused his methodology of being flawed. McPhee asserted that these errors are as follows: (1) The war was not fought against Vendeans generally but Royalist Vendeans; the government relied on the support of Republican Vendeans. (2) The Convention ended the campaign after the Royalist Army was clearly defeated—if the aim was genocide, then they would have continued and easily exterminated the population. (3) He fails to inform the reader of atrocities committed by Royalist forces against Republican civilians and POWs in the Vendée. (4) He repeats alleged folkloric myths as facts (5) He does not refer to the wide range of estimates of deaths suffered by both sides, and that casualties were not &quot;one-sided&quot;; and more.
Peter McPhee says that the pacification of the Vendée does not fit either the United Nations&#x27; CPPCG definition of genocide because the events happened during a civil war. He states that the war in the Vendée was not a one-sided mass killing and the Committee of Public Safety did not intend to exterminate the whole population of the Vendée; as parts of the population at least were allies of the revolutionary government.

Concerning the controversy, Michel Vovelle, a specialist on the French Revolution, remarked: &quot;A whole literature is forming on &#x27;Franco-French genocide&#x27;, starting from risky estimates of the number of fatalities in the Vendean wars ... Despite not being specialists in the subject, historians such as Pierre Chaunu have put all the weight of their great moral authority behind the development of an anathematizing discourse, and have dismissed any effort to look at the subject reasonably.&quot;

Shortly before his return to the Russian Federation after decades of exile in 1993, former Soviet dissident and winner of the 1970 Nobel Prize in Literature Alexander Solzhenitsyn delivered a speech in Les Lucs-sur-Boulogne to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Vendée Uprising. Coming down strongly in favor of calling the Republican response genocidal, Solzhenitsyn compared Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s Bolsheviks following the October Revolution with the leadership of the Jacobin Club during the French Revolution. Solzhenitsyn also compared the Vendean rebels with the Russian, Ukrainian, and Cossack peasants who similarly rebelled against the Bolsheviks, saying that both were destroyed mercilessly by &quot;revolutionary despotism&quot;. He commented sadly that, while the French Reign of Terror ended with the Thermidorian reaction, the toppling of the Jacobin single party state by the French Revolutionary Army, and the execution of Maximilien Robespierre, its Soviet equivalent continued to accelerate until the Khrushchev thaw of the 1950s.

Debate over the characterization of the Vendée uprising was renewed in 2007, when nine deputies introduced a measure to the National Assembly to officially recognize the Republican actions as genocidal. The measure was strongly denounced by a group of Far Left French historians as an attempt to use history to justify political extremism.

At the start of 2017 Jacques Villemain published (), which an analysis by him of the Vendée war from the perspective of the international courts of justice in The Hague (such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda). Jacques Villemain is a French diplomat, and is currently the vice representative of France at OECD and is representing France at the International Court of Justice. He presented a legal study on the War of Vendée based on current international criminal law, according to modern findings in the international courts on genocide cases like the Rwanda Genocide and the Srebrenica massacre, is that the government of the First French Republic was guilty of war crimes beginning in March 1793, crimes against humanity between April and July 1793, and genocide from 1 August 1793 to the middle of 1794.

===Challenging the methodology===

In the heart of the modern controversy lies Secher&#x27;s evidence, which Charles Tilly analyzed in 1990. Initially, Tilly maintains, Secher completed a thoughtful dissertation-style thesis about the revolutionary experience in his own village, La Chapelle-Basse-Mer, which lies near Nantes. In the published version of his thesis, he incorporated some of Tilly&#x27;s own arguments: that conflicts within communities generalized into a region-wide confrontation of anti-revolutionary majority based in the countryside with a pro-revolutionary minority that had particular strength in the cities. The split formed with the application of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and the oath to support it, in 1790–1792. From then, the local conflicts grew more sharply defined, over the choice between juring and non-juring priests. The conscription of March 1793, with the questionable exemption for Republican officials and National Guard members, broadened the anti-revolutionary coalition and brought the young men into action.

With , Reynald Secher&#x27;s thesis for the began with a generalization of the standard arguments to the whole region. Although La Chapelle-Basse-Mer served him repeatedly as a reference point, Secher illustrated his arguments with wide citations from national and regional archives to establish a broader frame of reference. Furthermore, he drew on graphic, nineteenth century accounts widely known to the historians of the Vendee: Carrier drownings and the &quot;infernal columns of Turreau&quot;. Most importantly, however, Secher broke with conventional assessments by asserting on the basis of minimal evidence, Tilly claims, that the pre-revolutionary Vendée was more prosperous than the rest of France (to better emphasize the devastation of the war and the repression). He used dubious statistical methods to establish population losses and fatalities, statistical processes that inflated the number of people in the region, the number and value of houses, and the financial losses of the region. Secher&#x27;s statistical procedure relied on three unjustifiable assumptions. First, Secher assumes a constant birth rate of about 37 per thousand of population, when actually, Tilly maintains, the population was declining. Second, Secher assumes no net migration; Tilly maintains that thousands fled the region, or at least shifted where they lived within the region. Finally, Secher understated the population present at the end of the conflict by ending it 1802, not 1794.

Despite the criticism, a number of scholars continue the assertion of genocide. In addition to Secher and Chaunu, Kurt Jonassohn and Frank Chalk also consider it a case of genocide. Further support comes from Adam Jones, who wrote in &quot;Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction&quot; a summary of the Vendée uprising, supporting the view that it was a genocide: &quot;the Vendée Uprising stands as a notable example of a mass killing campaign that has only recently been conceptualized as &#x27;genocide and that while this designation &quot;is not universally shared ... it seems apt in the light of the large scale murder of a designated group (the Vendéan civilian population).&quot; Pierre Chaunu describes it as the first &quot;ideological genocide&quot;..&quot; Mark Levene, a historian who specializes in the study of genocide, considers the Vendée &quot;an archetype of modern genocide&quot;. Other scholars who consider the massacres to be genocide include R. J. Rummel, Jean Tulard, and Anthony James Joes.

In 2020, David Bell published a paper in &quot;Journal of Genocide Research&quot; to rebut the genocide theory.

==Cultural depictions==

The events of the Vendee have been the subject of books, films, and music.

=== Film and Television ===
Filmed on location in France, &quot;The Hidden Rebellion&quot;, a docu-drama produced and directed by Daniel Rabourdin, presents the rebellion as an example of the courage and love for God and country that the royalists possessed. Winner of the 2017 Remi Film Award, it has aired on EWTN and is available for purchase on DVD. The uprising in the Vendée was also the subject of an independent feature film from Navis Pictures. &quot;The War of the Vendée&quot; (2012), written and directed by Jim Morlino, won awards for &quot;Best Film For Young Audiences&quot; (Mirabile Dictu International Catholic Film Festival, at the Vatican) and &quot;Best Director&quot; (John Paul II International Film Festival, Miami, FL).

The Vendée Revolt was the setting for one of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel (TV series)&quot; series entitled &quot;Valentine Gautier&quot; (2002). The Vendée Revolt was also the setting for &quot;The Frogs and the Lobsters&quot;, an episode of the television program &quot;Hornblower&quot;. It is set during the French Revolutionary Wars and very loosely based on the chapter of the same name in C. S. Forester&#x27;s novel, &quot;Mr. Midshipman Hornblower&quot; and on the actual ill-fated Quiberon expedition of 1795. &quot;Vaincre ou mourir&quot; was a related 2022 film released by Studio Canal in co-operation with the Puy du Fou theme park company.

<text>Vincent Michael Irizarry (born November 12, 1959) is an American actor. He was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in 1985 and 2002, and won in 2009.

==Early life and education==
Irizarry grew up on Long Island, New York, and he is one of six children. He moved to Lake Grove, New York at an early age. At age 11, Irizarry began to study piano, becoming classically trained, then continued his studies at Berklee College of Music in Boston. He performed in numerous productions with a regional theater company. He won a full-time scholarship with Lee Strasberg at his Theater Institute.

==Career==
Irizarry got his start in daytime television in 1983 as Brandon/Lujack Luvonaczek Spaulding on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. His character was paired up with Beth Raines (then Judi Evans Luciano) and they were considered a &quot;supercouple.&quot; He was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in 1985]. He then played Dr. Scott Clark from 1987 to 1989 on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;. He also portrayed the role of Lujack Spaulding&#x27;s twin brother Nick McHenry Spaulding on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; from July 1991 to February 26, 1996. Irizarry returned for a cameo in late-December 1996.

Irizarry was cast in the role of Dr. David Hayward on &quot;All My Children&quot;, a role he originated in 1997. Irizarry also went to &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, during the infamous baby-swap storyline in 2005. He portrayed David until November 28, 2006.

However, in November 2006, Irizarry joined the cast of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as the character David Chow, first appearing on January 9, 2007. David Chow was romantically involved with Carmen Mesta, played by Marisa Ramirez. Originally contracted for 13 weeks, Irizarry&#x27;s character proved popular, and his stay on the soap was extended.

On August 17, 2008, a spokesperson for &quot;All My Children&quot; confirmed that Irizarry would reprise the role of David Hayward. Irizarry returned to the studio in September and began making regular appearances in October until it aired its final episode on September 23, 2011.

In December 2012, Irizarry announced on his Facebook page that he would be joining Prospect Park&#x27;s online reboot of &quot;All My Children&quot;, scheduled for Spring 2013. He reprised his Emmy award-winning role of Dr. David Hayward that he originated in 1997. It ran from April to September 2013.

In 2013, Irizarry appeared in an episode of &quot;Homeland&quot;.

In August 2015, news broke that Irizarry joined the cast of &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, portraying the role of Deimos Kiriakis, the bitter and vindictive younger half-brother of Victor Kiriakis. Irizarry made his first appearance in early January 2016. He was let go from the serial in February 2017, and then received a Daytime Emmy nomination.

==Personal life==
Irizarry&#x27;s oldest child, Ash Harris, was born in May 1989.

He married actress Signy Coleman in July 1989 but they would divorce in 1992. Their daughter Siena Sophia was born in 1990. He married Avalon House in 1997, and they have two children. Irizarry confirmed that he and House were in the process of getting a divorce in 2010.

He was in a relationship with clothing designer Donna Petracca.

<text>Stanley Carl &quot;Stan&quot; Roberts (January 17, 1927 – September 6, 1990) was a Canadian politician. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba between 1958 and 1962, and ran for the leadership of the Manitoba Liberal Party in 1961. He was later involved with the Liberal Party of Canada, and was a founding member of the Reform Party of Canada.

==Early years==
Roberts was born in St. Adolphe, Manitoba, later farming there, and received of Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Manitoba and an MBA from Western University. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in 1958, as a Liberal-Progressive candidate in the francophone riding of La Verendrye (Roberts was himself bilingual). Although Dufferin Roblin&#x27;s Progressive Conservative (PC) Party won the general election, Roberts defeated his Tory opponent Stan Bisson by 1565 votes to 1395. He was re-elected in 1959, defeating PC candidate Edmond Guertin.

When Douglas Campbell resigned as Liberal-Progressive leader in 1961, Roberts ran to succeed him. He represented a &quot;left opposition&quot; within the party, and accused its more conservative leadership of being ineffective against Roblin&#x27;s centrist/progressive government. He was defeated by establishment candidate Gildas Molgat by 475 votes to 279 on April 20, 1961, one day after the party formally renamed itself the Manitoba Liberal Party.

==Resignation==
Roberts resigned from the legislature to contest the 1962 federal election in the riding of Provencher; he was defeated by Progressive Conservative Warner Jorgenson by about a thousand votes. He again lost to Jorgenson in the 1963 federal election, by a slightly greater margin.

Roberts subsequently worked as a Manitoba advisor to Liberal Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, and served as president and acting leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party from 1969 to 1970 (after party leader Robert Bend failed to win his seat in the 1969 provincial election). He also worked as an executive officer for McCabe Grain Company Limited, later National Grain Company Limited. In 1971, he was named vice-president of Simon Fraser University, serving until 1976.

==Constitutional reform involvement==
In 1976, Roberts became the first president of the Canada West Foundation. In this capacity, he took a leading role in arguing for the position of the west in Canada&#x27;s constitutional debates. He also developed contacts with Ernest and Preston Manning. In late 1978, Roberts expressed interest in Francis Winspear&#x27;s proposed constitutional reforms, which included Senate reform and the equal treatment of all provinces.

During this period, Roberts made several speeches warning about the possibility of western separatism. There were some within the Canada West Foundation who believed that Roberts himself was partly sympathetic to separatism; he never became affiliated with the movement, but was forced to step down as CWF President in December 1980 after some controversial statements on the subject. In 1980, he moved from British Columbia to Toronto after being named president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. Roberts left that position in 1982.

Roberts remained loyal to the Liberal Party during this period. He ran for the leadership of the British Columbia Liberal Party in 1984, but lost to former Member of Parliament Art Lee on the first ballot. Roberts&#x27;s participation in this contest probably prevented him from running to succeed Pierre Trudeau as leader of the federal party. Roberts disagreed with the selection of John Turner as party leader, but he nevertheless ran for the federal Liberals in the Quebec riding of Lachine in 1984, losing to Progressive Conservative Bob Layton.

==Reform Party of Canada==
After this election, Roberts began to consider forming a new political party. The federal Liberal Party had long been weak in western Canada, and won only two seats west of Ontario in 1984. Roberts believed that a new party might be necessary to oppose Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in western Canada. In 1987, he became involved with Francis Winspear, Preston Manning and Ted Byfield in plans to create what would later become the Reform Party of Canada.

Roberts was in many respects an unlikely figure within this group. His political philosophy was centrist, perhaps somewhat left-of-centre. He was not an uncritical supporter of free-market economics, and he does not seem to have been a social conservative. Nevertheless, he was willing to work with more conservative figures to create the new party.

Even before the Reform Party&#x27;s founding convention (October 30-November 1, 1987), Roberts began to have concerns about the new party&#x27;s ideology. He opposed its regionalist aspects, and was concerned by its popularity with voters who opposed bilingualism and Quebec&#x27;s role in Canada&#x27;s Confederation. One week before the founding convention, he agreed to stand for the party&#x27;s leadership against Preston Manning, the only other declared candidate.

At the convention, Manning&#x27;s supporters among the convention-goers voted to close the registration process one day ahead of schedule, perhaps fearing Roberts was planning to bus in several &quot;instant delegates&quot;. After failed negotiations with the Manning camp, Roberts dropped out of the race on November 1, claiming that Manning&#x27;s supporters had hijacked the party from its original intentions. He referred to Manning&#x27;s supporters as &quot;fanatical Albertans&quot; and &quot;small-minded evangelical cranks&quot;.

Roberts subsequently sought the Reform Party&#x27;s nomination in the British Columbia riding of Saanich—Gulf Islands for the 1988 federal election, but was defeated. He had no further involvement with the Reform Party, and died of a brain tumour in Burnaby two years later.

<doc id="893167" wikidata="Q2261012" url="?curid=893167" title="Scott Parker (ice hockey)">
<text>Scott Douglas Parker (born January 29, 1978) is an American former professional ice hockey right winger who played for the Colorado Avalanche and San Jose Sharks in the NHL. Parker earned his nickname, &quot;the Sheriff&quot;, from his reputation as a feared fighter and enforcer.

==Playing career==
Parker grew up playing ice hockey in Eagle River, Alaska, with the youth hockey Mustang Hockey Association and Alaska All Star Hockey Association. He played high school hockey for the Chugiak High School Mustangs. In his sophomore year with the Mustangs Parker was a member of the varsity hockey team that won the Alaska state high school hockey championship. Parker played a season of Junior &quot;B&quot; hockey for the Spokane Braves and then went on to play for the Kelowna Rockets of the Major Junior Western Hockey League of the Canadian Hockey League. It was with the Rockets that Parker was drafted into the NHL.

He was initially drafted by the New Jersey Devils in the third round, 63rd overall, in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft. However unable to come to an agreement with the Devils he re-entered into the 1998 draft and was selected in the first round, 20th overall, by the Colorado Avalanche. After playing a few seasons in the WHL with the Kelowna Rockets, Parker started his NHL career with the Avalanche in 1998 and was a member of their 2001 Stanley Cup championship team.

Parker was acquired by San Jose for a fifth round selection in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft on June 21, 2003. In 2005, Parker was struck in the head by the puck, and spent a long time off the ice recovering from the resulting concussion.

In a game against the Nashville Predators on March 11, 2006, Parker got involved in an altercation with Nashville defenceman Brendan Witt. Called for elbowing Nashville player Jordin Tootoo, Parker was ejected from the game after an outburst of emotion in the penalty box, including slamming his stick against the glass. As he was led off the ice, Parker jumped onto the glass between the two teams&#x27; benches and struck Witt several times. As a result, he was suspended for two games.

On February 27, 2007, Parker was re-acquired by the Colorado Avalanche from the Sharks for a sixth round draft pick in the 2008 draft.

On October 17, 2008, Parker was assigned to Colorado&#x27;s affiliate the Lake Erie Monsters of the AHL. In a rare conflict between the team and one of its own players, the Avalanche terminated Parker&#x27;s contract on November 9, 2008 for insubordination for not reporting to the Monsters.

==Personal==
Parker was born in Hanford, California and raised in Eagle River, Alaska.

Parker retired in early August 2009 and has since started a barbershop business with his wife Francesca in Castle Rock, Colorado.

In 2006, Parker and his wife Francesca started a charity called &quot;Parker&#x27;s Platoon&quot;. Parker&#x27;s Platoon is dedicated to helping military veterans transition from military to civilian life. They help &quot;one veteran at a time&quot; through activities such as riding snow machines in the Rockies to trout fishing and other activities that bring veterans together, helping the vets realize they are not alone in their mental and physical healing process.

In July, 2012, Parker made some controversial comments about Steve Moore. Parker was on the roster of the San Jose Sharks at the time of the 2004 Todd Bertuzzi - Steve Moore incident in which Moore&#x27;s career was ended by an on-ice attack from Todd Bertuzzi, but Parker and Moore had been teammates in Colorado during prior seasons. In an interview with milehighhockey.com, Parker defended Bertuzzi and spoke disparagingly of Moore, being quoted as saying &quot;he (Moore) always thought he was better than everybody else.”

In 2017, Parker appeared on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Outside the Lines&quot; acknowledging that he was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury.

<text>Howdenshire was a wapentake and a liberty of England, lying around the town of Howden in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

In the Anglo-Saxon period, the district was under the control of Peterborough&#x27;s monastery, but it was confiscated by Edward the Confessor, and then given to the Bishop of Durham by William I of England. It came to operate as an exclave of County Durham, much like Allertonshire, but under the dean of Durham rather than the bishop. This peculiarity was abolished in 1846, but the district is still in use for certain administrative purposes.

<text>Liu Qi (; born November 3, 1942, in Wujin, Changzhou, Jiangsu) is a retired Chinese politician. He formerly served as the Party Secretary of Beijing, and also a member of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party. He was also the President of the Beijing 2008 Olympics Organizing Committee.

==Biography and career==
* Graduated from Beijing 101 Middle School and the metallurgical department of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Engineering, and majored in iron smelting. With a postgraduate education, Liu holds the professional title of &quot;senior engineer&quot;.
* Mayor of Beijing, 1999-2003. He was succeeded by Meng Xuenong, who was replaced by Wang Qishan after the SARS outbreak.
* Head of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games Bid Committee (BOBICO).
* Named as one 100 most influential people of 2007 by &quot;Time&quot; magazine.
* Head of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games.

==Subject of human rights litigation==
On February 7, 2002, Liu was sued in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by the San Francisco-based human rights organization, the Center for Justice and Accountability. The plaintiffs in that case alleged that, as mayor of Beijing, Liu was responsible for formulating security policy and had control over the local police. The police were in turn alleged to have tortured the plaintiffs with beatings, electric shock, and forced feedings through tubes inserted through the plaintiffs&#x27; noses. The court issued a declaratory judgment that Liu was responsible for violating the defendants&#x27; rights to be free from torture and arbitrary detention. However, because Liu did not defend the suit, there were no hearings, trials, or findings of fact on the issues presented.

<text>Wayne Michael Primeau (born June 4, 1976) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League (NHL). He is the younger brother of Keith Primeau.

==Playing career==
Primeau was a first round draft pick of the Owen Sound Platers in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) and played with the Platers for three years from 1992 to 1995. 

He was drafted 17th overall in 1994 by the Buffalo Sabres, where he scored his first NHL goal in his first NHL game against Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils. He was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2000 and was then traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins on February 1, 2001.

Primeau was acquired by the San Jose Sharks from the Penguins in exchange for Matt Bradley on March 11, 2003. After a career year in 2003–04, Primeau was eligible for group IV unrestricted free agency. However, he decided to re-sign with the Sharks.

Primeau was traded to the Boston Bruins on November 30, 2005, (along with Brad Stuart and Marco Sturm) in exchange for Joe Thornton. In February 2007, the Bruins traded him to the Calgary Flames (again along with Brad Stuart) in exchange for Chuck Kobasew and Andrew Ference.

On July 27, 2009, Primeau was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs (along with a second round pick in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft) in exchange for forward Colin Stuart, defenceman Anton Strålman and a seventh-round pick in 2012.

Prior to the start of the Maple Leafs&#x27; 2010 training camp, Primeau was signed to a professional tryout contract with the Leafs. He was released at the conclusion of training camp on September 26.

<doc id="893186" wikidata="Q928197" url="?curid=893186" title="Warhammer (game)">
<text>Warhammer (formerly Warhammer Fantasy Battle or just Warhammer Fantasy) is a tabletop miniature wargame with a medieval fantasy theme. The game was created by Bryan Ansell, Richard Halliwell, and Rick Priestley, and first published by the Games Workshop company in 1983.

As in other miniature wargames, players use miniature models (&quot;minis&quot;) to represent warriors. The playing field is a model battlefield comprising models of buildings, trees, hills, and other terrain features. Players take turns moving their model warriors across the playing field and simulate a battle. The outcomes of fights between the models are determined by a combination of dice rolls and simple arithmetic. Though the gameplay is mostly based on medieval warfare, it incorporates fantasy elements such as wizards, dragons, and magical spells.

&quot;Warhammer&quot; was the first commercial miniature wargame designed to use proprietary models. Prior to this, miniature wargames rulesets were designed to use generic models that could be bought from any manufacturer.

The first edition rulebook for &quot;Warhammer&quot; was released in 1983, and the line was supported for thirty years by model releases, supplementary rulebooks, and new editions of the core rules. The eighth edition of the core rules was released on 10 July 2010. The game is no longer supported by Games Workshop, and the last supplementary rulebook was released in 2015. It was replaced later that year by &quot;Warhammer Age of Sigmar&quot;, which uses the models created for the &quot;Warhammer&quot; line in a new setting and game system. In 2024, Warhammer Fantasy was brought back in a reboot known as &quot;Warhammer The Old World&quot;, which brings a new version of the old rules and updated models.

The &quot;Warhammer&quot; setting is inspired by the fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien, Poul Anderson and Michael Moorcock. The fictional background for the game was developed in rulebooks, &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine, Inferno! magazine, and more than 150 novels set in the &quot;Warhammer&quot; universe. Many of these novels are still in print under the &quot;Warhammer Chronicles&quot; imprint.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Warhammer&quot; is a tabletop wargame where two or more players compete against each other with &quot;armies&quot; of 25 mm – 250 mm tall heroic miniatures. The rules of the game have been published in a series of books which describe how to move miniatures around the game surface and simulate combat in a &quot;balanced and fair&quot; manner. Games may be played on any appropriate surface, although the standard is a tabletop decorated with model scenery in scale with the miniatures. Any individual miniature or group of similar miniatures in the game is called a &quot;unit&quot;.

The core game rules are supplied in a single book, with supplemental &quot;Warhammer Armies&quot; texts giving guidelines and background for army-specific rules. Movement of units about the playing surface is generally measured in inches, and units&#x27; combat performance is dictated randomly by either the roll of a 6-sided die (a &#x27;D6&#x27;) or a 6-sided &#x27;scatter&#x27; die. The latter is often used to generate direction, commonly alongside an &#x27;artillery&#x27; die, for cannons, stone-throwers, and other artillery. Each unit and option within the game is assigned a point value for balancing purposes. A game will commonly have armies of 750 to 3,000 points, although smaller and larger values are possible.

==The &quot;Warhammer&quot; world==
&quot;Warhammer&quot; is set in a fictional universe notable for its &quot;dark and gritty&quot; background world, which features influences from Michael Moorcock&#x27;s Elric stories, and also many historical influences.

The geography of the &quot;Warhammer&quot; world closely resembles that of Earth because of manipulation by an ancient spacefaring race known as the Old Ones. This mysterious and powerful race visited the Warhammer World in the distant past. Establishing an outpost, they set about manipulating the geography and biosphere of the planet. With the assistance of their Slann servants, they moved the planet&#x27;s orbit closer to its sun, and arranged the continents to their liking.

To travel between worlds, the Old Ones used portals to another dimension (&quot;warp gates&quot;), which they built at the north and south poles of the Warhammer World. Eventually, however, these gates collapsed, allowing raw magical energy and the daemonic forces of Chaos to pour forth into the Warhammer world. At this point, the Old Ones disappeared. Before leaving, however, they had established the Lizard men (ruled over by the Slann) as their servants. In addition they had created the races of Elves, Dwarfs, Humans, Halflings and presumably the Ogres (who are assumed to be an unfinished attempt by the old ones to create the ultimate race). Orcs and Goblins were not created by the Old Ones, nor were they part of their plan, and their origin is not made clear in the setting. Beastmen and Skaven were the result of mutation from raw magical energy at this time. Eventually the Chaos Daemons were driven back by Lizardmen and Elves, with the Elves performing a great ritual to drain out the raw magic that was flowing into the world and sustaining the Daemons. Some creatures, such as Dragons and Dragon-Ogres, are stated to have existed prior to the arrival of the Old Ones.

After this, Elves and Dwarfs flourished and created mighty empires, but eventually they were set into a slow decline. A series of civil wars amongst the Elves split them into two groups – the malicious Dark Elves and righteous High Elves. A petty war between the High Elves and Dwarfs served only to diminish both races and caused the High Elves to abandon their colonies. Some of the colonists refused to leave their homes in a magical sapient forest and over time developed into the enigmatic and isolationist Wood Elves. A period of seismic activity caused by the Slann decimated the underground holds of the Dwarfs, while attacks by Skaven and Goblins, who breached the Dwarf strongholds from below, only made things more desperate.

The Humans were the slowest to develop, but ultimately formed several strong nations able to defend themselves from aggressors. The Nehekharan Empire (based on Ancient Egypt) was the first great Human empire, but due to a curse by Nagash (the first necromancer) they became an undead faction known as the &quot;Tomb Kings&quot; who now dwell in The Land of the Dead (former Nehekhara). Nagash, in his efforts to find eternal life, also created the first Vampires, an entirely separate undead faction.

At the time of the setting&#x27;s destruction (according to the setting&#x27;s fictional timeline) there were two prominent Human nations: The Empire which is based on a combination of aspects of the Holy Roman Empire and Renaissance Germany, and Bretonnia, which is based on Arthurian legends and medieval France. Sigmar, founder of The Empire, wielded a mighty Dwarf-made Warhammer from which the name of the &quot;Warhammer Fantasy&quot; setting is derived. There are also numerous other nations which are fleshed out in the background information but are not represented by playable factions in the tabletop game, some of which are loosely based on real-world nations from various historical periods. These include the southern realms of Estalia and Tilea, representing medieval Spain and Renaissance Italy respectively, as well as the far eastern Empire of Grand Cathay, analogous to a fantastic version of Imperial China.

The forces of disorder are often depicted as not a localised threat, but a general menace consisting of disparate factions, many of which are typically also at odds with each other. The Skaven exist in an &quot;Under Empire&quot; (an extensive network of tunnels beneath the planet&#x27;s surface), while the war-loving Orcs and Goblins are nomadic (although they are most common in the Badlands, Southlands, and Dark Lands) and regularly amass large numbers and stage raids without warning. Similarly, Ogres are most common in the Ogre Kingdoms and in the eastern Mountains of Mourn, but are depicted as unscrupulous wandering warriors who are always hungry, and who sometimes hire themselves out as mercenaries to both the forces of order and disorder.

In addition to the chaos-worshiping Warriors of Chaos who live in strange Chaos Wastes north of the other faction&#x27;s lands, chaos cults often arise within human and elven nations. Beastmen are depicted as mutants dwelling deep in forests and impossible to fully eradicate. Vampires and necromancers raising armies of undead are also depicted often as an internal threat. Chaos Daemons are restricted to manifesting themselves where magical energy is strongest, but this could be almost anywhere.

The 8th Edition Empire Army Book describes the Warhammer World to currently be in the year 2522 (Empire calendar), whilst the current Lizardmen Army Book puts the collapse of the warpgates at −5700 on the same calendar, thus the fictional history spans at least 8200 years.

== Armies ==
There are a number of playable armies for &quot;Warhammer&quot;, which are representative of one or other of the factions or races that are present in the &quot;Warhammer&quot; world setting. For the first few editions of the game armies were presented in collective books like &quot;Warhammer Armies&quot;. Starting in the 4th edition individual books were released for each army.

In the 8th edition of the game, the following armies had individual army books:
*Beastmen
*Bretonnia
*Daemons of Chaos
*Dark Elves
*Dwarfs
*The Empire
*High Elves
*Lizardmen
*Ogre Kingdoms
*Orcs and Goblins
*Skaven
*Tomb Kings
*Vampire Counts
*Warriors of Chaos
*Wood Elves

During the 6th edition, the following armies had official rules available from the Games Workshop website, and were usable throughout the 6th and 7th editions. These rules have since been taken down, and they were unplayable in the 8th edition. 
*Chaos Dwarfs: The &quot;White Dwarf Presents&quot; army book was released during the 4th Edition as a collection of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; articles, but is still considered an official rule book. An official Chaos Dwarf army list was included in &quot;Ravening Hordes&quot; at the start of the 6th edition. The army list was included in the reference section of the 7th edition, but has been removed from the 8th edition rulebook. This model line was discontinued at the end of the 5th edition and is no longer supported by the main rules. Forge World released Chaos Dwarf models under their Warhammer Forge line.
*Dogs of War: The official army book was released during the 5th Edition; Regiments of Renown and Mercenary Army lists for the 6th edition were released on the website. Regardless, some of this line remained available for direct order from Games Workshop as late as 2013.
*Kislev: The army book was given away free with &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine during the 6th edition. This model line has since been discontinued and is no longer supported.

Armies that were left unsupported prior to the 6th edition:
*Fimir

Whilst armies would have a typical aesthetic some players would use a method of customisation known as converting, or &#x27;kitbashing&#x27;. To convert a model, a player would take parts of other model kits and them it to make aesthetic/cosmetic changes to another model. A kitbash would typically have no effect on rules or gameplay.

==Editions==
Throughout the eight editions of the game, the core movement, combat and shooting systems remained generally unchanged, with only minor revisions between editions. The most significant changes which ensure incompatibility between editions have been made to the magic, army composition systems, and specialist troop types.

The starter armies in the box sets have grown more detailed with each succeeding generation, and the 7th edition (2006) was the first to be titled as a scenario (&quot;The Battle for Skull Pass&quot;) instead of just Warhammer Fantasy Battle. For example, the High Elves have appeared in the 4th edition (1992) and the 8th edition (2010); while the 4th edition only contained Spearmen and Bowmen figures (essentially, just two types of figurines) plus cardboard cutouts for the general and a warmachine, the 8th edition contained a more widely varied army (including cavalry, Sword Masters, mage, and a general mounted on a griffon).

===Inspiration===
Published in November 1981 for its second edition (1978 for the very first one), and written by Richard Halliwell and Rick Priestley, &quot;Reaper&quot; is considered the ancestor of &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battle&quot;. &quot;Reaper&quot; is more a skirmish game for up to 30 miniatures rather than a large-scale wargame.

===First edition (1983)===

The first edition, written by Bryan Ansell, Richard Halliwell and Rick Priestley was published in 1983 as Warhammer The Mass Combat Fantasy Role-Playing Game and consists of a boxed set of 3 black and white books illustrated by Tony Ackland: &quot;Vol 1: Tabletop Battles&quot;, which contains the core rules, turn sequence, creature lists, potion recipes and features an introductory battle &#x27;The Ziggurat of Doom&#x27;. &quot;Vol 2: Magic&quot; which explains rules for wizards of 4 different levels and the higher order arch magi. Higher level wizards have access to more powerful spells. In this system, a wizard picks his spells at the start of the game, must have the correct equipment (usually Amulets), and as he casts each one it depletes a store of &#x27;constitution&#x27; points, until at zero points he could cast no more. &quot;Vol 3: Characters&quot; introduces &#x27;personal characteristics&#x27; statistics, rules for roleplaying (including character advancement through experience points and statistic gains, random encounters, equipment costs, and alignment) and has a sample campaign &quot;The Redwake River Valley&quot;.

Very little world background is given at all and the race descriptions are kept to a minimum, and most of the background given is in describing the origins of magic items. Some notable differences to later editions are the inclusion of Night Elves (later Dark Elves), the appearance of Red Goblins – and that Citadel Miniatures order codes are given.

====Critical reaction====
In the July 1983 edition of White Dwarf, (Issue 43), Joe Dever gave the system a positive review, saying, &quot;If you regularly wargame with miniatures, or have been wondering what additional fun you could have from your rapidly growing collection of fantasy figures, then I recommend you check out &quot;Warhammer&quot; and let battle commence!&quot;

Chris Hunter reviewed &quot;Warhammer&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;if you are looking for a mass fantasy combat system, I would recommend &quot;Warhammer&quot;; but if all you want is a fantasy role-playing game, it would perhaps be better to look elsewhere&quot;.

In the May 1984 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 85), Katherine Kerr was not impressed, and called it &quot;one of the most irritating new games I’ve ever read.&quot; She found the manuscript full of typographical errors, and &quot;On top of it all, the authors have a miserable command of the English language. Their prose is even more awkward than the usual low level of gaming writing and is studded with grammatical errors.&quot; She found the game system divided between a good combat system and a poor roleplaying system, and called the effort &quot;two separate games with a weak attempt to link them together. The first, a set of rules for tabletop battles with miniature figures, is very good; the second, pieces of a fantasy role-playing game, is embarrassingly bad.&quot; In the same issue, Ken Rolston also reviewed &quot;Warhammer&quot;, and although he agreed that the rules were &quot;hardly a model of English usage or proofreading,&quot; they were well-organised and readable. Rolston agreed with Kerr that the miniatures rules were the strong suit of the system, but he also admired the psychology rules that determined how classic fantasy racial types behave towards each other. However, he found the role-playing system to be &quot;primitive&quot;.

In the January–February 1985 edition of &quot;Space Gamer&quot; (Issue No. 72), Edwin J. Rotondaro also thought the system was divided between good miniatures rules and bad roleplaying rules. &quot;Overall, I have to say that &quot;Warhammer&quot; is a good miniatures game, but a terrible roleplaying game. The system is flexible enough to be used as a mass combat module in most RPGs, but you have to decide whether it&#x27;s worth [the price] for a set of fantasy miniatures rules.&quot;

==== Expansion ====
The first edition was extended with &quot;Forces of Fantasy&quot; boxed set in 1984.

===Second edition (1985)===

The second edition of Warhammer was released in January of 1985. It split the rules into three rulebooks — &quot;Combat&quot;, &quot;Battle Magic&quot; and &quot;Battle Bestiary&quot;, with full-colour artwork by John Blanche. There were few substantive changes in rules, but major clarifications of the original rules were included. New rules included uses and effects of standards and musicians, flying, fortifications, fire, artillery, chariots, reserve units, specialist spellcasters, and poisons.

This edition also further developed &quot;The Known World&quot;, which was geographically and socially based upon Earth. 
====Critical reaction====
Paul Mason reviewed &quot;Warhammer II&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;All in all, Warhammer is a much improved package, which covers the field of Fantasy Figures Wargaming with simple rules, and yet more comprehensively than virtually any other product.&quot;

In the June 1985 edition of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (Issue #66), Robert Alcock called the second edition &quot;a predictable expansion of the original&quot;, although he noted that this edition had &quot;not ironed out all the problems.&quot; Alcock especially disliked the mechanic of &quot;throwing a bucket full of dice to cause casualties and then find that your opponent gets most of them back with a saving throw.&quot; However, despite these issues, Alcock concluded that &quot;&quot;Warhammer&quot; does remain the only viable set of fantasy mass battle rules&quot;, and gave the second edition an overall rating of 8 out of 10.

===Third edition (1987)===
The Third Edition of the game was published as a single hardback book in 1987. It had the most in-depth and complex movement and manoeuvre system of any edition. Other changes included a variety of new specialist troop types, rules for war machines and a more finely tuned system of representing heroes and wizards. It kept the same magic system and open-ended army design system as the first two editions. However, by this stage the use of army lists was very much encouraged. Army lists for this edition were published in a separate book called &quot;Warhammer Armies&quot; in 1988; until then, use of the 2nd Edition&#x27;s &quot;Ravening Hordes&quot; list was encouraged. This is partly because it was the last edition published before Games Workshop took a different commercial approach, leading to competition from former GW employees in the briefly published competing &quot;Fantasy Warlord&quot;.

The third edition was expanded with the &quot;Realm of Chaos&quot;: tome one, &quot;Slaves To Darkness&quot;, followed by tome two, &quot;The Lost and the Damned&quot;; and &quot;Warhammer Siege&quot; books.

====Critical reaction====
In Issue 37 of &quot;Challenge&quot;, Timothy B. Brown commented, &quot;I admire miniatures use in role-playing games, and I feel &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battle&quot;, though not futuristic, is a terrific set of rules.&quot; Overall, Brown thought this game &quot;accomplishes handily what it sets out to do. [...] All the elements are there — monsters, magic, heroic characters — the works. I&#x27;ve never seen as complete a rules set as this one.&quot; He concluded, &quot;Can I recommend buying it? Well, yes I can, since I have an interest in all types of gaming. If you’re a science-fiction gamer and that&#x27;s it, &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battle&quot; probably isn&#x27;t for you. However, if you get the chance to look through it, you might change your mind.&quot;

In the February 1989 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 142), Ken Rolston gave the third edition high praise, saying, &quot;If you’re serious about fantasy tabletop gaming, &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battle (WFB)&quot; is probably your only choice. Rolston liked the &quot;fast-paced&quot; rules system and developed fantasy background, and his only reservations were about presentation: &quot;The text is dense and wordy. The wealth of diagrams is good, but their captions aren’t always clear. The abundance of photos, illustrations, and paintings is often visually stimulating, but many of these graphics are of marginal or negligible relevance to the accompanying text. The black-and-white photographic reproduction is surprisingly poor.&quot; He concluded with a strong recommendation: &quot;The fantasy campaign setting is simply super. The series of revised editions, supplements, and magazine support articles indicates that Games Workshop is interested in and capable of catering to the gamer’s appetite for new features, refined editions, and elaborated fantasy campaign materials.&quot;

===4th edition (1992) and 5th edition (1996)===
The fourth and fifth editions of the game, released in October 1992 and October 1996, respectively, were similar to each other but quite different from the third. The fifth edition in particular became known pejoratively as &quot;Herohammer&quot; because of the imbalance between the very powerful heroes, monsters and wizards in the game and blocks of troops which existed effectively as cannon fodder. Both editions of the game were sold as box sets containing not only the rulebooks and a variety of other play aids but also sufficient plastic miniatures to be able to play the game &quot;out of the box&quot;. The rules underwent a re-write compared to the 3rd Edition. A completely re-worked magic system was produced which was available as a boxed expansion set. Rather than selecting spells they were drawn at random and the magic phase was based on the play of these cards, making magic a bit like a game within a game. The magic system was further expanded by the &quot;Arcane Magic&quot; box set and the magic element of the &quot;Chaos&quot; box set.

The fourth edition was also the first edition to enforce the use of army lists in the form of separate &quot;Warhammer Army&quot; books for the separate racial groupings. These books prescribed for each army a limited number of unit choices; specifying limits on the number of points that could be spent on &quot;characters&quot;, troops and monsters and so on. The books also included background on the particular army, illustrations and photographs showing models and have remained with the game though updated with the rules.

The magic system was reworked and re-released in December 1996 as a single box covering the magic for all the armies. The magic was &quot;toned down&quot; (WD204) with spell casting limited to the players&#x27; own turn. The multiple card packs of the &quot;Colours of Magic&quot; system was replaced by 20 &quot;Battle Magic&quot; spell cards but the Colour Magic spells were in the rule book for players to use if they wanted.

Several boxed campaign packs were produced, &quot;Tears of Isha&quot; for example, gave a campaign for High Elves and included a card &quot;building&quot; to assemble. Likewise, the Orc and Goblin themed campaign &quot;Idol of Gork&quot; included card idols of the Orc deities Gork and Mork. The others were &quot;Circle of Blood&quot; (Vampire Counts vs Bretonnians), &quot;Grudge of Drong&quot; (Dwarves vs High Elves) and &quot;Perilous Quest&quot; (Bretonnians vs Wood Elves).

The fourth edition featured High Elves versus Goblins. The fifth edition, released in 1996, re-introduced the Bretonnian forces, which had been left out of the 4th edition, and re-worked the Slann heavily to create the Lizardmen armies.

In 1997, the fifth edition of &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battles&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Miniatures Rules of 1996&quot;.

====Critical reaction====
Chris McDonough reviewed &quot;Warhammer&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #34 (Jan./Feb., 1993), rating it a 3 out of 5 and stated that &quot;Overall, flaws aside, the rules are fun and it&#x27;s a nice set for those looking to join the fantasy battle hobby. Unfortunately, because of the miniature choices and the lack of magic, it&#x27;s not the &#x27;everything in one box&#x27; game that I hoped it would be.&quot;

=== 6th edition (2000) ===

The sixth edition, released in 2000, was also published as a box with soft-cover rulebook and miniatures (Orcs and Empire). The Rulebook was also available for separate sale, hard-cover in the first printing and soft-cover after that. After the fifth edition, this edition put the emphasis back on troop movement and combat: heroes and wizards were still important but became incapable of winning games in their own right. There was also an all-new magic system based on dice rolling.

=== 7th edition (2006) ===

The seventh edition rules were released on 9 September 2006. It was available in two forms: as a single hardback rulebook for established gamers and as a complete boxed set game complete with plastic miniatures (Dwarfs and Goblins), &quot;The Battle for Skull Pass&quot; supplement book and a soft-cover rulebook that has less artwork and background material than the hardback version. The smaller rulebook from the boxed set was approximately half the size of the large book both in size of the cover and page count. The &quot;Basic Rules&quot; and &quot;Advanced Rules&quot; sections of both books were identical in text, layout, illustrations, credits, page numbering and ISBN. The two books had different front pieces and the larger rulebook has two extensive addition sections &quot;The Warhammer World&quot; (68 pages) and &quot;The Warhammer Hobby&quot; (56 pages) plus slightly expanded appendices.

===8th edition (2010)===
According to the official Games Workshop webpage, the 8th edition of Warhammer was made available for pre-order on 14 June 2010 and was released 10 July 2010.

The new starter set named &quot;Island of Blood&quot; contained armies of High Elves and Skaven, a condensed mini-rulebook, as well as 10 standard dice, one scatter and one artillery die, two 18 inch rulers, and three blast templates. The High Elf and Skaven miniatures from &quot;Island of Blood&quot; were reused for the Age of Sigmar set &quot;Spire of Dawn&quot;.

The Orcs and Goblins, Dwarfs, Wood Elves and Tomb Kings army books were updated for this edition.

The 8th edition was expanded with the &quot;Storm of Magic&quot; &#x27;supplement&#x27; in 2011, featuring rules for using more destructive magic and monsters. The second expansion was release shortly after: &quot;Blood in the Badlands&quot;, which included some special scenarios and introduced rules for siege warfare. In 2013, &quot;Triumph and Treachery&quot; (an expansion that allows multi-player games of between 3 and 5 players) and &quot;Sigmar&#x27;s Blood&quot; (a 5 scenario short campaign between Empire and Vampire Counts following the crusade led by Volkmar to destroy Mannfred von Carstein) were released. Another series of five books was released in 2014–15, entitled &quot;The End Times&quot;. This expansion saw the appearance of every major character of the setting. The last book, &quot;Archaon&quot;, described the end of the Warhammer world at the hand of the book&#x27;s namesake.

=== Warhammer: The Old World (2024) ===
Warhammer: The Old World was released on 20 January 2024. While not described by Games Workshop as the 9th edition of Warhammer, Warhammer: The Old World features a base rules system similar to previous Warhammer editions. Nine factions from previous editions return as core factions split over two books, Forces of Fantasy (Empire of Man, Dwarfen Mountain Holds, Kingdom of Bretonnia, Wood Elf Realms, High Elf Realms), and Ravening Hordes (Orc &amp; Goblin Tribes, Warriors of Chaos, Beastmen Brayherds, Tomb Kings of Khemri). Seven other factions (Dark Elves, Skaven, Vampire Counts, Daemons of Chaos, Ogre Kingdoms, Lizardmen, Chaos Dwarfs) received army rules published online, but will not receive any additional support throughout the first edition of the game.

== Derivative games ==
Games based on the core &quot;Warhammer&quot; mechanics and rules include:

*&quot;Warhammer Ancient Battles&quot; (often referred to as &quot;WAB&quot; and sometimes Warhammer Historical). Intended to simulate armies of the real world of the Ancient and Medieval periods.
*A science fiction based skirmish wargame using similar rules was developed as &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader&quot; by Games Workshop and released in 1987. Originally using a minor variation of the 2nd edition &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battle&quot; rules, the two games have subsequently taken different development paths. This has since developed into the separate &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; setting.
*The first edition of &quot;Blood Bowl&quot; uses the same basic turn system and character statistics as &quot;Warhammer&quot; to simulate a fantasy American football game. Rules for ranged combat applied to ball throwing. Since the second edition of &quot;Blood Bowl&quot; the game has taken its own development path. A card game inspired by the game has also been developed.
*Games Workshop released a skirmish scale wargame set in the world of &quot;Warhammer&quot; called &quot;Mordheim&quot;. It is set in the destroyed city of Mordheim. It uses the same basic rules as the 5th edition of &quot;Warhammer&quot;, but modified to support activation of individual models in a small gang. It also has a campaign system which you use to improve your warband as they gain experience.
*The &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battles&quot; rules led to &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay&quot; in 1986, again using the same statistics, although presented as percentiles rather than 1–10 to give more detail and differentiation between characters than is required in a wargame. In 2005 Black Industries released a second edition, later licensing the rights to Fantasy Flight Games. In 2009 Fantasy Flight Games discontinued active support for the second edition due to the release of the third edition. From 2017, the license was granted to Cubicle 7, who have issued a fourth edition and made publications for the previous editions available in digital format. 
*&quot;Dark Heresy&quot; (another role-playing game) was released by Black Industries in 2008 using a variation of the 2nd edition of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. The line was transferred to Fantasy Flight Games, which then released &quot;Rogue Trader&quot; (2009), &quot;Deathwatch&quot; (2010), &quot;Black Crusade&quot; (2011), and &quot;Only War&quot; (2013), each using close variants of the Dark Heresy engine. As of 2019, the license to produce role-playing games in the Warhammer 40,000 setting is held by Cubicle 7.
*Games Workshop release &quot;Judge Dredd: The Role-Playing Game&quot; (1985) was clearly derived from the same percentile mechanics as Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. 
*&quot;Inquisitor&quot; is a detailed, percentage based miniatures game set in the derivative &quot;Warhammer 40K&quot; setting. The mechanics fall somewhere between &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 1E&quot; and &quot;Warhammer 40K&quot;.

Games based on the &quot;Warhammer&quot; setting, but not sharing the rules, include:

*&quot;Warmaster&quot;, representing very large-scale, epic battles. Warmaster uses smaller models than &quot;Warhammer&quot; using 10 mm as opposed to 28 mm, with different rules regarding troop movement and combat.
*In 1987, GW released a board game &quot;Chaos Marauders&quot;
*In 1989, GW released another board game, &quot;Advanced HeroQuest&quot;
*In 1993, Games Workshop released a naval wargame set in the world of &quot;Warhammer&quot; called &quot;Man O&#x27; War&quot;.
*In 1990, Games Workshop released a strategic wargame of empire building, &quot;Mighty Empires&quot;, intended both as a stand-alone game and as a way to manage a campaign of miniature battles. This was followed in 1991 by &quot;Dragon Masters&quot;, an introductory game reusing some &quot;Mighty Empires&quot; assets in which players take the role of competing Elven princes in Ulthuan.
*In 1995 the boardgame &quot;Warhammer Quest&quot; was released. Based upon the &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battle&quot; system it shared many of the same combat mechanics as well as the setting, while building upon the previous game &quot;Advanced Heroquest&quot;. &quot;Warhammer Quest&quot; was followed by two expansions, &quot;Lair of the Orc Lord&quot; and &quot;Catacombs of Terror&quot;, nine &quot;Character Packs&quot; and several &quot;Card Packs&quot;.
*&quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battle&quot; has been adapted as computer games: the 1995 &quot;&quot;, its 1998 sequel &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and the MMORPG, &quot;Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning&quot; which was released on 18 September 2008.
*&quot;Chaos in the Old World&quot; has been released (2009)
*On 1 October 2011, Games Workshop released the one-off game, Dreadfleet.
*Fantasy Flight Games&#x27; &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 3rd edition&quot; is a new game engine not derived from the earlier game mechanics. It was released in 2009.
*&quot;Warhammer Quest&quot; card game has been released (2015)
*&quot;&quot; is a first-person shooter video game developed and published by Fatshark that was released on 23 October 2015. A sequel titled &quot;&quot; was released on 8 March 2018.
*&quot;Total War: Warhammer&quot; is a turn-based strategy real-time tactics video game developed by the Creative Assembly and published by Sega that was released on 24 May 2016. It was followed by &quot;a sequel&quot; that was released on 28 September 2017. The second sequel, &quot;Total War: Warhammer III&quot;, was released on 17 February 2022.

<text>This article lists the [[Head of government|heads of government]] of [[Libya]] since the country&#x27;s independence in 1951.

Libya has been in a tumultuous state since the start of the Arab Spring-related Libyan crisis in 2011; the crisis resulted in the collapse of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the killing of Muammar Gaddafi, amidst the First Civil War and the foreign military intervention. The crisis was deepened by the factional violence in the aftermath of the First Civil War, resulting in the outbreak of the Second Civil War in 2014. The control over the country is currently split between the Government of National Stability (GNS)—supported by the House of Representatives (HoR)—in Tobruk and the Government of National Unity (GNU) in Tripoli and their respective supporters, as well as various jihadist groups and tribal elements controlling parts of the country.

<doc id="893196" wikidata="Q1617033" url="?curid=893196" title="Worsley">
<text>Worsley () is a village in the City of Salford, Greater Manchester, England, which in 2014 had a population of 10,090. It lies along Worsley Brook, west of Manchester.

Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, there is evidence of Roman and Anglo-Saxon activity, including two Roman roads. The completion in 1761 of the Bridgewater Canal allowed Worsley to expand from a small village of cottage industries to an important town based upon cotton manufacture, iron-working, brick-making and extensive coal mining. Later expansion came after the First and Second World Wars, when large urban estates were built.

Worsley Delph is a scheduled monument and a significant part of the town&#x27;s historic centre is now a conservation area.

==History==

===Toponymy===
Worsley is first mentioned in a Pipe roll of 1195–96 as &quot;Werkesleia&quot;, in the claim of a Hugh Putrell to a part of the fee of two knights in nearby Barton-upon-Irwell and Worsley. The spelling &quot;Worsley&quot; itself first appears in 1444. Scholars agree that the last element of the name comes from the Old English word (&quot;cleared land among woodland&quot;). As to the first part, however, there are many variations on the name, which the place-name scholar Victor Watts divided into three varieties:

Type 1 looks like it comes from an Old English personal name &quot;Weorc&quot;, in which case the place-name meant &quot;Weorc&#x27;s clearing&quot;. Types 2 and 3 could come from an otherwise unattested feminines personal name &quot;Weorcgyth&quot;, in which case the name meant &quot;Weorcgyth&#x27;s clearing&quot;. But Watts also suggested that types 2 and 3 might really point to an initial element of uncertain origin followed by the Common Brittonic word found today as Welsh , in which case the name originated as the name of a forest along the likes of &quot;Wer-ked&quot;, which later gave its name to the settlement in cleared land.

===Early history===

Two Roman roads run through the area. Connecting Mamucium (Manchester) with Coccium (Wigan), one passes through Worsley near Drywood, and over Mosley Common. The present-day A6 road follows part of the course of another Roman road, which passes through the northern part of the area near Walkden and Little Hulton. In 1947 a hoard of 550 Roman coins was found near a quarry in Boothstown, dated to between AD 250 and 275, and in 1958 the head of a man was found on Worsley Moss. Named &quot;Worsley man&quot;, and originally thought to be no more than 20 years old, upon the discovery of Lindow Man it was re-examined and dated to approximately the 2nd century AD, in the Romano-British period.

Worsley later fell under the control of the Anglo-Saxons, who controlled much of the area around Manchester and who also defeated the British at the Battle of Chester in AD 615. Edward the Elder rebuilt the fortifications at Manchester, and in AD 924 captured all the land between the rivers Mersey and Irwell, making it demesne in the Kingdom of Wessex. During the Middle Ages the area was covered with forests and marshlands. Thinly populated by craftsmen and serfs, Worsley grew as a settlement adjoining an ancient corn mill, close to the location of the present-day Worsley Road Bridge. Most farms throughout Lancashire were small with their tenants dependent upon secondary employment, however in 1719 a John Kay of Worsley had five stirks, two bulls, 17 cows, &quot;young cattle upon the moors&quot;, and a &quot;cow at hire&quot;, all valued at £97 5s. Marl was commonly used as a fertiliser, and is recorded in use in 1719. Wheeler&#x27;s &quot;Manchester: Its Political, Social and Commercial History, Ancient and Modern&quot; (1836) states that about one-fifth of the land around Worsley, Astley and Tyldesley was in tillage, lower on average than the surrounding areas.

===Bridgewater estates===
Worsley was, originally, the largest manor of the seven ancient manors of the Bridgewater Estates. It was created by William I and held for him by the Barton family in thegnage, and for them by a Norman knight named Elias, who fought in the crusades. On his death in Rhodes, the manor remained with Elias&#x27; son, whose family had by that time adopted the name of the village as its family name. On 23 June 1311 a substantial part of the Manor of Hulton was granted to the Worsleys. The family held both manors until the late 14th century, whereon they passed to the Massey family of Tatton, and then in the 16th century to the Brereton family of Malpas, Cheshire. The Brereton family added the Manor of Bedford (a small area of land to the west of Worsley) to the estate. Richard Brereton later married Dorothy Egerton, and upon his death the estates passed into the Egerton family.

In 1617 John Egerton, son of Sir Thomas Egerton, became Earl of Bridgewater. The Egerton family was descended from Sir Richard Egerton of Ridley, Cheshire. His illegitimate son, Thomas Egerton, was a prominent lawyer who served as Master of the Rolls from 1594 to 1603, and Lord Keeper of the Great Seal from 1596 to 1617 and also as Lord High Chancellor of England. John Egerton succeeded to Worsley in 1639, and died in 1649. He was succeeded by the second and third Earls of Bridgewater. The title of Duke of Bridgewater was first given to Scroop Egerton in 1720. He devised a navigation system for Worsley which was not carried out. His son, the third Duke of Bridgewater Francis Egerton, was to build the Bridgewater Canal.

The Duke purchased the Manor of Pemberton (near Wigan) in 1758, the Manor of Hindley in 1765, and the Manor of Cadishead in 1776. Upon his death in 1803 he was succeeded by George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland. In 1833 the estate was inherited by Gower&#x27;s son, Francis Leveson-Gower who changed his surname to Egerton, and in 1846 became the Earl of Ellesmere. In 1836 he purchased the Manor of Tyldesley. He is recorded as saying that he found Worsley to be &quot;a God-forsaken place, full of drunken, rude people with deplorable morals&quot;.

Worsley New Hall, designed by Edward Blore, was built in 1846 for Francis Egerton the First Earl of Ellesmere. The plans are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Queen Victoria visited the hall in 1851 and 1857; Edward VII and Queen Alexandra visited when Edward was Prince of Wales in 1869, and on 6 July 1909. The hall was used as a hospital in World War I and in World War II housed Dunkirk evacuees, American soldiers preparing for D-Day and the Lancashire Fusiliers. In 1943 the hall was badly damaged by fire and demolished in 1949.

===Industrial Revolution===

Coal has been mined around Worsley from as long ago as 1376, originally in bell pits. The coal seams in the area tend to be fairly thin, slanting downwards from north to south, and so deeper mining became necessary during the 17th century.

With the onset of the Industrial Revolution and the growing use of steam power, there was a rapid increase in the demand for coal. The Duke&#x27;s mines were among those supplying the surrounding districts but transport was both inefficient and expensive, and the mines also suffered from persistent flooding. His solution to these problems was to build a canal from Worsley to Salford, and an underground canal into the mines from Worsley Delph. The canal boats would carry at a time, – more than ten times the amount of cargo per horse that was possible with a cart. The Duke and his estate manager obtained an Act of Parliament empowering them to begin construction on a planned route directly to Salford, avoiding the River Irwell.

James Brindley was brought in for his technical expertise and suggested varying the route of the proposed canal away from Salford and across the Irwell into Manchester. A second Act was secured for this variance, which included an aqueduct to cross the Irwell. This was built relatively quickly for the time; work commenced in September 1760 and the first boat crossed on 17 July 1761. The canal opened in 1761 and along with the stone aqueduct at Barton-upon-Irwell, was considered a major engineering achievement. One writer said that when finished, it &quot;will be the most extraordanary thing in the kingdom, if not in Europe. The boats in some places are to go underground, and in other places over a navigable river, without communicating with its waters ...&quot;

Worsley Delph, now a scheduled monument, was the entrance to the Duke&#x27;s underground mines. Two entrances, built years apart, allowed access to the Starvationer boats, the largest of which could carry of coal. The entrances allow access to of underground canal on four levels, linked by inclined planes.

The burgeoning village became a hub of commercial activity. The Duke employed craftsmen to service a wide range of industries including boat-making, plastering, blacksmithing and mining. A local quarry supplied limestone, for which a kiln was constructed at the junction of Barton Road (B5211) and Stableford Road. A quarry at the Delph supplied building materials for the region, including the stone used to construct Brindley&#x27;s aqueduct. To accommodate the workers needed for these industries the Duke built extra housing and cottages. In a diary entry of 1773, Josiah Wedgwood wrote of the area &quot;We next visited Worsley which has the appearance of a considerable Seaport Town. His Grace has built some hundreds of houses, &amp; is every year adding considerably to their number.&quot; Worsley Green became a thriving centre of industry.

With the death of the Duke in 1803, his estates were inherited by his nephew, George Leveson-Gower, who later became the Duke of Sutherland. The canal and coal estates were placed under the control of the Bridgewater Trust, and in 1833 the rest of the estates were inherited by the Duke of Sutherland&#x27;s son, Francis Leveson-Gower who changed his surname to Egerton, and in 1846 became the Earl of Ellesmere. The mines ceased production in 1887, and with the expiration of the Bridgewater Trust in 1903 the village began to change; the Duke&#x27;s warehouse and the works on what is now Worsley Green were demolished. Worsley Brook was culverted, and a memorial fountain to the Duke was built from the bricks of the works&#x27; chimney.

Although much of the industry that dominated Worsley was in decline, in 1937 Sir Montague Maurice Burton opened the Burtonville Clothing Works along the East Lancashire Road. Built in the Art Deco style, in 1938 the factory employed 3,000 people.

===Modern history===

Under the Housing Act 1919, large overspill estates were built by the council for veterans of the First World War, but a larger change to the area came after the end of the Second World War, when the City of Salford was forced to rehouse many of its inhabitants. With little land left, 4,518 new houses were built in the urban district by the Worsley Project. 18,000 people were rehoused under the scheme, which included new facilities, shops and schools. Another housing estate was built during the 1970s to the north of Worsley Green.

In 1944, during the Second World War, a flying bomb landed on a house near Worsley Dam. An Anti Aircraft Operations Room (AAOR) was built in the 1950s. Although unused the building still exists, in wooded land to the west of the town, on the site of the former Worsley New Hall.

==Governance==

From the 11th century, Worsley was a township in the Eccles parish of the hundred of Salford, and county of Lancashire. Worsley was originally in Eccles ecclesiastical parish, and also in Barton-upon-Irwell Poor Law Union. The Swinton area of the township was in 1867 included in the Swinton Local Board of Health, which from 1869 became the Swinton and Pendlebury Local Board of Health. In 1892 a small part of the township of Worsley was included in the Borough of Eccles. In 1894, under the Local Government Act 1894, Worsley Urban District was created. A part of the township then within the area of the Swinton and Pendlebury Local Board of Health was formed into Swinton township, becoming part of Swinton and Pendlebury Urban District. In 1907 two small detached parts of Worsley civil parish, then inside Swinton civil parish, were added to Swinton civil parish. A town hall was opened on 22 June 1911. Worsley Urban District gained of land from Barton-upon-Irwell Civil Parish in 1921, and in 1933 gained the area of Little Hulton Urban District. Parts were added to Eccles Borough and Irlam Urban District. In 1955 Swinton and Pendlebury Borough gained a small part of Worsley Urban District, and under the Local Government Act 1972, in 1974 Worsley&#x27;s Urban District status was abolished, becoming part of Salford Metropolitan District.

Following its 2006 review of parliamentary representation in Greater Manchester, the Boundary Commission for England recommended the creation of a modified Worsley constituency, incorporating a part of Eccles. The new constituency is called Worsley and Eccles South. Until the 2010 general election, Worsley was represented in the House of Commons by Barbara Keeley, Labour Party member for the Worsley constituency. After the election, Keeley became the MP for Worsley and Eccles South.

==Geography==

At (53.5000°, −2.3833°), Worsley stands about above sea level. Sheltered at the foot of a middle coal measure running approximately northwest and southeast across the area, the village lies along the course of Worsley Brook, which cuts through the ridge. The ridge also forms part of the northern edge of the Irwell Valley. The area is bordered on the north by the East Lancashire Road, and on the south by the Liverpool and Manchester Railway and part of the Bridgewater Canal. The larger towns of Swinton and Eccles lie to the east and southeast respectively, and to the west the area is largely bordered by Chat Moss, open fields, and forest. The M60 and M62 motorways cut directly through the area.

The underlying measures of coal have proved important for the development of the area; it was around Worsley Delph that the settlement first began to grow. Parts of the area are within an indicated floodplain. Worsley&#x27;s climate is generally temperate, like the rest of Greater Manchester. The mean highest and lowest temperatures ( and ) are slightly above the national average, while the annual rainfall () and average hours of sunshine (1394.5 hours) are respectively above and below the national averages.

==Demography==

According to the Office for National Statistics, at the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, the ward of Worsley had a population of 9,833, of which 4,801 were male and 5,032 female. It is the fifth least populous ward in Salford, and the third least densely populated. The ward has a higher proportion of married couples with and without children than Salford as a whole. Of those over 16 years old, 1,929 were single (never married) and 4,267 married. Worsley&#x27;s 4,102 households included 632 married couples without children, 818 with dependent children and 356 with non-dependent children. There were 249 lone-parent households with children. 642 households were occupied by pensioners living alone.

Of those aged 16–74, 1,428 had no academic qualifications, 1,078 had attained a level one qualification, 183 children aged between 16–17 and 242 people aged 18–74 were in full-time education. Worsley ward has the lowest levels of unemployment in Salford, in April 2006 0.9% of the economically active population were unemployment benefit claimants, comparing well to Salford as a whole where the figure is 3.7%. The area is considered to be one of the more affluent parts of Salford.

At 12.6 reported crimes per thousand population, the crime rate in Worsley is lower on average than Salford, which stands at 163.1 per thousand population.

==Economy==
One of Worsley&#x27;s early industries was weaving. A cottage industry, cotton would be spun on spinning wheels and hand-operated looms in people&#x27;s homes to produce cloth. Merchants would then purchase this cloth, selling it at the Bridgewater Hotel, then known as the Old Grapes Inn.

Worsley now has little industry, and is in the main a tourist destination and commuter town. The area has two large hotels; a Novotel and a Marriott. Worsley Old Hall is now a public house and restaurant in the Brunning and Price chain, part of the Restaurant Group.

==Landmarks==

Worsley Village was in 1969 designated as a conservation area by the former Lancashire County Council. Bisected by the A572 Worsley Road, the area covered about of land and included 40 listed buildings, such as the Packet House, a telephone kiosk, and the Delph sluice gates, but this list has since increased to 48 listed buildings. Much of the area around the canal and Worsley Delph was restored and landscaped between 1966 and 1967 by the Worsley Civic Trust and the local council, ready for a visit by Elizabeth II on 17 May 1968. As the canal passes through Worsley, iron oxide from the mines has, for many years, stained the water bright orange. The removal of this colouration is the subject of a £2.5 million remedial scheme, which was completed in 2004. This has not been successful and as of 2017 much of the canal centered on the Delph is still bright orange.

Wardley Hall is an early medieval manor house and a Grade I listed building in Wardley. The current hall dates from around 1500 but was extensively rebuilt in the 19th and 20th centuries. Worsley Old Hall is a Grade II listed building near Walkden Road. The Post Medieval building is said to have been moated, but no signs of the moat now remain.

Parts of Worsley are currently being considered as World Heritage Sites. The area includes Worsley Delph (itself a scheduled monument), parts of Worsley Green, and the Bridgewater Canal.

In 2015, the Royal Horticultural Society announced plans for a restoration of the garden at Worsley New Hall, which opened in 2021 as RHS Garden Bridgewater.

==Transport==

Following an Act of Parliament of 1861, in 1864 the Eccles, Tyldesley and Wigan branch line was opened by the London and North Western Railway, along with a station at Worsley which required the demolition of six cottages. The first sod had been cut by the Earl of Ellesmere. An additional branch line to Bolton was opened in 1870, branching from the Tyldesley Loopline line at Roe Green. A railway station at Monton Green was opened in 1887 to cater mainly for commuters into Manchester. The lines were important thoroughfares for the transport of coal in the area, including Mosley Common Colliery. Both lines were closed under the Beeching Axe in 1969, and have since been partially reclaimed by Salford City Council as recreational pathways.

Early public transport included the Farnworth horse-bus service, with a terminus at the nearby Stocks Hotel in 1885. An electric tram service was founded in 1903 by the South Lancashire Tramways Company.

==Education==

One of the first Sunday schools to be established in England may have been at Worsley. Built in the 1780s in a cottage close to the present-day courthouse, and founded by Thomas Bury (a colliery manager for the 3rd Duke) children were taught by a Luke Lowe, a cooper also in the Duke&#x27;s employ. In 1785 a further three Sunday schools were established in the area, and by 1788 over 300 children were attending the four schools. Francis Egerton built a day school in 1838, which later became known as St Mark&#x27;s School. This was demolished during construction of the M62 motorway, and replaced with a new school on Aviary Road, opened 19 October 1968.

The area of Worsley contains a number of primary schools, including (but not limited to) Christ the King RC Primary School, Hilton Lane Primary School and Mesne Lea Primary School. Secondary schools include Bridgewater School and The Lowry Academy.

Salford College has a campus in nearby Walkden (once within Worsley Urban District). The college&#x27;s Worsley Campus, the Learning Resource and specialist Media Centre, caters for 16- to 18-year-olds, and provides access to 50 internet workstations, 15,000 books, and resources for e-learning. It also has a suite of hair and beauty salons, a performing arts theatre and a sports hall and fitness suite.

==Religious sites==

Ellenbrook Chapel, the first church in Worsley was built in 1209 by the Worsley family. Methodism was first practised in the area in 1784, by the notable preacher Matthew Mayer. Later services were held in various locations around the area, and in 1801 a Methodist chapel was built along Barton Road. The foundation stone for St Mark&#x27;s Church was laid on 14 June 1844 by George Granville Francis Egerton, the son of Francis Egerton. Designed by the architect George Gilbert Scott, the church was consecrated on 2 July 1846 by the Bishop of Chester, John Bird Sumner. The church tower is now home to the mechanism for the Bridgewater Clock from the Bridgewater workshops at Worsley Green. The clock strikes 13 times at 1 pm, originally so that workmen did not miss the end of their dinner break. Many gravestones in the churchyard were cut from rock sourced at Worsley Delph. Following a proposed hotel development in 1981 the area around the church and vicarage was designated a conservation area.

==Sports==
Worsley Golf Club was founded in 1894 on part of the Earl of Ellesmere&#x27;s estate at Broadoak Park. The area has a clay pigeon shooting club, west of the M60. A racecourse development proposed on land near Boothstown was the subject of a public inquiry and rejected by the local council after a sustained campaign by local councillors.

==Public services==
Home Office policing in Worsley is provided by the Greater Manchester Police. The nearest police station is at Little Hulton Or Swinton Public transport is co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester. Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service.

==Notable people==
Notable people from Worsley include the actress Helen Cherry, and television commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme. Statistician Harry Campion, who played a leading role in the development of official statistics after the Second World War, was born in Kearsley in May 1905 and brought up in Worsley. Arthur Thomas Doodson was a mathematician and oceanographer born in Boothstown in March 1890. Footballer Ryan Giggs caused controversy in the mid-2000s when he bought a Victorian mansion on the outskirts of the village and demolished it to build a new house. The house was put on the market in 2019 with an asking price of £3.5m. Giggs&#x27; former team-mate David Beckham also owned a property in Worsley until 2014.

<text>What I Learned About Ego, Opinion, Art &amp; Commerce is a compilation album by American rock band Goo Goo Dolls. It was released in 2001 by Warner Bros. Records and is a compilation of Goo Goo Dolls songs released from 1987–2000.

Tracks 1–4 are from the album &quot;Dizzy Up the Girl&quot;. Tracks 5–9 are from the album &quot;A Boy Named Goo&quot;. Tracks 10–16 are from the album &quot;Superstar Car Wash&quot;. Tracks 17–20 are from the album &quot;Hold Me Up&quot;. Track 21 is from the album &quot;Jed&quot;. Track 22 is from the album &quot;Goo Goo Dolls&quot;. Multiple songs, such as &quot;Acoustic #3&quot; and &quot;All Eyes On Me&quot;, have an extended musical interlude. &quot;Two Days In February&quot; was re-recorded by Rzeznik, a studio version of the original, which was recorded outside. &quot;Naked&quot; is an extended version of the original, which was on &quot;A Boy Named Goo&quot;, and is similar to the version released as a single. All songs are remixed and remastered.

The album is not a typical best-of compilation, as most of the band&#x27;s biggest hits (such as &quot;Iris&quot; and &quot;Name&quot;) are absent. Instead, the selection is a combination of non-singles and songs that were released as singles prior to the Goo Goo Dolls&#x27; 1995 breakout, as well as fan favorites and a few of their less successful singles.

The song &quot;Name&quot; was released on this album as an exclusive to Japan.

<text>Barbara Dana Broccoli ( ; born June 18, 1960) is an American-British film and stage producer, best known internationally for her work on the James Bond film series. With her half-brother Michael G. Wilson, Broccoli held overall creative control of the Bond film franchise until 2025, when it was ceded to Amazon MGM Studios.

== Early life and education ==
Broccoli was born in Los Angeles, the daughter of the James Bond producer Albert R. &quot;Cubby&quot; Broccoli and actress Dana Wilson Broccoli (born Dana Natol). She was raised in London and attended Lady Eden&#x27;s school in Kensington.

Broccoli graduated from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, where she studied motion picture and television communications.

== Career ==
In 1995, her father Cubby Broccoli handed over control of Eon Productions, the production company responsible for the James Bond series of films, to Barbara and her half-brother Michael G. Wilson; they retained creative control of the series until 2025.

Broccoli was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2022 New Year Honours for services to film, drama, philanthropy and skills.

Broccoli and Wilson received the David O. Selznick Achievement Award in Theatrical Motion Pictures in 2013. In 2014, she was selected as a member of the jury for the 64th Berlin International Film Festival.

Broccoli became President of the National Youth Theatre after the success of their 60th Anniversary Diamond Gala at Shaftesbury Theatre in 2016.

=== James Bond series ===
Broccoli started working in the Bond series at the age of 17, working in the publicity department of &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977). Several years later, she served as an assistant director on &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983). She eventually progressed to the role of associate producer for the film &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987).

Broccoli&#x27;s most significant role has been as a producer of the Bond films starring Pierce Brosnan and later Daniel Craig, with Broccoli taking over from her father to join Wilson as a producer for 1995&#x27;s &quot;GoldenEye&quot; (starring Brosnan) and retaining creative control of the franchise throughout the entire Craig era.

In February 2025, Broccoli and Wilson announced that they would be ceding creative control of the Bond franchise to Amazon MGM Studios, forming &quot;a new joint venture to house the James Bond intellectual property rights&quot;. They reportedly sold the creative rights to Amazon for an estimated $1 billion, with the exact structure of the deal not publicly known. Despite ceding creative control, Broccoli and Wilson chose to remain onboard as co-owners of the franchise.

=== Stage productions ===
==== &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; ====
Following her father&#x27;s death in 1996, Broccoli worked with London theatre producer Michael Rose to create a stage musical, &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, based on the 1968 musical film starring Dick Van Dyke and Sally Ann Howes. Broccoli rehired the original songwriters from the film to write the new material for the stage version. The Sherman Brothers wrote five new songs for the show which debuted on April 16, 2002. The show ran at the London Palladium, and it was the longest-running and most financially successful show to have ever played there.

&quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; later transferred to Broadway, but it received poor reviews and closed with the loss of a large proportion of the initial $15 million investment. The musical toured extensively in the United Kingdom and in Asia, with a revised version of the show touring the United States in 2008.

==== &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; ====
In 2012, during the festivities surrounding the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Broccoli co-produced &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, the London stage adaptation of the 1981 film of the same title. Broccoli&#x27;s involvement with &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; extended back to 1980, when she introduced her friend Dodi Fayed to the screenplay; he later co-financed the film and became its executive producer. She co-produced the play along with Hugh Hudson, who directed the 1981 Oscar-winning film.

<doc id="893219" wikidata="Q9678" url="?curid=893219" title="2014 Winter Olympics">
<text>The 2014 Winter Olympics, officially called the XXII Olympic Winter Games () and commonly known as Sochi 2014 (), were an international winter multi-sport event that was held from 7 to 23 February 2014 in Sochi, Russia. Opening rounds in certain events were held on 6 February 2014, the day before the opening ceremony.

These were the first Olympic Games under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach. Both the Olympics and Paralympics were organized by the Sochi Organizing Committee (SOOC). Sochi was selected as the host city on 5 July 2007, during the 119th IOC Session held in Guatemala City. It was the first Olympics to be held in a CIS state and former Warsaw Pact state after the Revolutions of 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic previously hosted the Summer Olympics in 1980.

A record ninety-eight events in fifteen winter sport disciplines were held during the Games. A number of new competitions—a total of twelve accounting for gender—were held during the Games, including biathlon mixed relay, women&#x27;s ski jumping, mixed-team figure skating, mixed-team luge, half-pipe skiing, ski and snowboard slopestyle, and snowboard parallel slalom. The events were held around two clusters of new venues: an Olympic Park constructed in Sochi&#x27;s Imeretinsky Valley on the coast of the Black Sea, with Fisht Olympic Stadium, and the Games&#x27; indoor venues located within walking distance; and snow events in the resort settlement of Krasnaya Polyana.

The 2014 Winter Olympics were the most expensive Games in the history of the Olympics. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, major cost overruns caused this figure to expand to US$51 billion, more than three times the cost of the 2012 London Olympics and even surpassing the estimated cost of US$44 billion for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The 2014 Games achieved a record broadcast audience of 2.1 billion people worldwide.

In 2016, an independent report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed allegations that the Russian Olympic team had been involved in a state-sponsored doping program, active from at least late 2011 through August 2015. The program was active during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, and athletes had benefited from the cover-up. The IOC stripped thirteen medals from Russian athletes in 2017, but nine were reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, with an option for whitelisted athletes to compete independently during the 2018 Winter Olympics.

==Bidding process==
Sochi was elected on 4 July 2007 during the 119th International Olympic Committee (IOC) session held in Guatemala City, Guatemala, defeating bids from Salzburg, Austria; and Pyeongchang, South Korea. This is the first time that the Russian Federation has hosted the Winter Olympics. The Soviet Union was the host of the 1980 Summer Olympics held in and around Moscow.
==Cost and financing==

As of October 2013, the estimated combined cost of the 2014 Winter Olympics had topped US$51 billion. This amount included the cost for Olympic games themselves and cost of Sochi infrastructural projects (roads, railroads, power plants). This total is over four times the initial budget of $12 billion (compared to the $8 billion spent for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver), and made the Sochi games the most expensive Olympics in history, exceeding the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, which hosted 3 times as many events. Dmitry Kozak was the main overseer for the events in Sochi.

In its final budget published in June 2014, Olimpstroy—the state corporation that oversaw the Sochi Olympics development—reported the total allocated funds for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics of 1,524 billion rubles (US$49.5 billion). However, only about a fifth of that budget ($10.8 billion) was directly related to the Olympic games, while the rest went into urban and regional regeneration and the conversion of the Sochi region into an all-year round sea and alpine resort. The breakdown table below is based on that has analyzed the distribution of Olimpstroy&#x27;s $49.5 billion budget. Estimates also suggest that additional unrecoverable operational costs (including for security) could have added another $3 billion.

==Venues==

With an average February temperature of and a humid subtropical climate, Sochi is the warmest city to host a Winter Olympic Games. Sochi 2014 is the 12th straight Olympics to outlaw smoking; all Sochi venues, Olympic Park bars and restaurants and public areas were smoke-free during the Games. It is also the first time that an Olympic Park has been built for hosting winter games.

===Sochi Olympic Park (Coastal Cluster)===

The Sochi Olympic Park was built by the Black Sea coast in the Imeretinsky Valley, about 4 km (2.5 miles) from Russia&#x27;s border with Abkhazia/Georgia. The venues were clustered around a central water basin on which the Medals Plaza is built, allowing all indoor venues to be within walking distance. It also features &quot;The Waters of the Olympic Park&quot; (designed by California-based company WET), a choreographed fountain which served as the backdrop in the medals awards and the opening and closing ceremonies of the event. The new venues include:
* Fisht Olympic Stadium – ceremonies (opening/closing) 40,000 spectators
* Bolshoy Ice Dome – ice hockey (final), 12,000 spectators
* Shayba Arena – ice hockey, 7,000 spectators
* Adler Arena Skating Center – speed skating, 8,000 spectators
* Iceberg Skating Palace – figure skating, short track speed skating, 12,000 spectators
* Ice Cube Curling Center – curling, 3,000 spectators
* Main Olympic village
* International broadcasting centre and main press room

===Krasnaya Polyana (Mountain Cluster)===
* Laura Biathlon &amp; Ski Complex – biathlon, cross-country skiing
* Rosa Khutor Extreme Park – freestyle skiing and snowboarding
* Rosa Khutor Alpine Resort – alpine skiing
* Sliding Center Sanki – bobsleigh, luge and skeleton
* RusSki Gorki Jumping Center – ski jumping and Nordic combined (both ski jumping and cross-country skiing on a 2 km route around the arena)
* Roza Khutor plateau Olympic Village

===Post-Olympic usage===

A street circuit known as the Sochi Autodrom was constructed in and around Olympic Park. Its primary use is to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix, which held its inaugural edition in October 2014.

In January 2015, work began on adapting Fisht Olympic Stadium into an open-air football stadium to host matches during the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

A new ice hockey team in the Kontinental Hockey League, HC Sochi Leopards, now plays in Bolshoy Arena.

==Marketing==
==Construction==
The Olympic infrastructure was constructed according to a Federal Target Program (FTP). In June 2009, the Games&#x27; organizers reported they were one year ahead in building the main Olympic facilities as compared to recent Olympic Games. In November 2011, IOC President Jacques Rogge was in Sochi and concluded that the city had made significant progress since he last visited eighteen months earlier.

===Telecommunications===
According to the FTP, US$580 million would be spent on construction and modernization of telecommunications in the region. Avaya was named by the Sochi Organizing Committee as the official supplier of telecommunications equipment. Avaya provided the data network equipment, including switches, routers, security, telephones and contact-center systems. It provided engineers and technicians to design and test the systems, and worked with other technology partners to provide athletes, dignitaries and fans information about the Games.

The 2014 Olympics is the first &quot;fabric-enabled&quot; Games using Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) technology. The network is capable of handling up to 54 Tbit/s of traffic.

Infrastructure built for the games included:
* A network of TETRA mobile radio communications for 100 user groups (with capacity of 10,000 subscribers);
* of fiber-optic cables along the Anapa-Dzhubga-Sochi highways and Dzhubga–Krasnodar branch;
* Digital broadcasting infrastructure, including radio and television broadcasting stations (building and communications towers) with coverage from Grushevaya Polyana (&quot;Pear Glade&quot;) to Sochi and Anapa cities. The project also included construction of infocommunications centre for broadcasting abroad via three HDTV satellites.

During the Games, the core networks of Rostelecom and Transtelekom were used.

In January 2012, the newest equipment for the television coverage of the Games arrived in the port of Adler. Prepared specifically for the Games, a team of regional specialists and the latest technology provide a qualitatively new level of television production in the region.

The fiber-optic channel links Sochi between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana. The channel enables videoconferencing and news reporting from the Olympics.

In November 2013, it was reported that the fiber-optic cable that was built by the Federal Communications Agency, Rossvyaz, had no operator. With Rostelecom and Megafon both refusing to operate it, the line was transferred to the ownership of the state enterprise Center for Monitoring &amp; Development of Infocommunication Technologies ().

Russian mobile phone operator Megafon expanded and improved Sochi&#x27;s telecom infrastructure with over 700 new 2G/3G/4G cell towers. Sochi was the first Games to offer 4G connectivity at a speed of 10 MB/sec.

In January 2014, Rostelecom reported that it had connected the Olympic media center in Sochi to the Internet and organized channels of communication with the main media center of the Olympic Games in the coastal cluster and press center in Moscow. The media center was built at total cost of 17 million rubles.

===Power infrastructure===
A five-year strategy for increasing the power supply of the Sochi region was presented by Russian energy experts during a seminar on 29 May 2009, held by the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee, and attended by International Olympic Committee (IOC) experts and officials from the Russian Ministry of Regional Development, the Russian Ministry of Energy, the State Corporation Olimpstroy and the Krasnodar Krai administration.

According to the strategy, the capacity of the regional energy network would increase by two and a half times by 2014, guaranteeing a stable power supply during and after the Games.

The power demand of Sochi at the end of May 2009 was 424 MW. The power demand of the Olympic infrastructure was expected to be about 340 MW.
* Poselkovaya electrical substation became operational in early 2009.
* Sochi thermal power station reconstructed (expected power output was 160 MW)
* Laura and Rosa Khutor electrical substations were completed in November 2010
* Mzymta electrical substation was completed in March 2011
* Krasnopolyanskaya hydroelectric power station was completed in 2010
* Adler CHP station design and construction was completed in 2012. Expected power output was 360 MW
* Bytkha substation, under construction with two transformers 25 MW each, includes dependable microprocessor-based protection

Earlier plans also include building combined cycle (steam and gas) power stations near the cities of Tuapse and Novorossiysk and construction of a cable-wire powerline, partially on the floor of the Black Sea.

===Transportation===

The transport infrastructure prepared to support the Olympics includes many roads, tunnels, bridges, interchanges, railroads and stations in and around Sochi. Among others, 8 flyovers, 102 bridges, tens of tunnels and a bypass route for heavy trucks – of roads were paved.

The Sochi Light Metro is located between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana connecting the Olympic Park, Sochi International Airport, and the venues in Krasnaya Polyana.
The existing , Tuapse-to-Adler railroad was renovated to provide double track throughout, increasing capacity and enabling a reliable regional service to be provided and extending to the airport. In December 2009, Russian Railways ordered 38 Siemens Mobility Desiro trains for delivery in 2013 for use during the Olympics, with an option for a further 16 partly built in Russia.

At Sochi International Airport, a new terminal was built along a runway extension, overlapping the Mzymta River.
At the Port of Sochi, a new offshore terminal from the shore allows docking for cruise ships with capacities of 3,000 passengers. The cargo terminal of the seaport would be moved from the centre of Sochi.

Roadways were detoured, some going around the construction site and others being cut off.
In May 2009, Russian Railways started the construction of tunnel complex No. 1 (the final total is six) on the combined road (automobile and railway) from Adler to Alpica Service Mountain Resort in the Krasnaya Polyana region. The tunnel complex No. 1 is located near Akhshtyr in Adlersky City District, and includes:
* Escape tunnel, , completed in 2010
* Road tunnel, , completed in 2013
* One-track railway tunnel, , completed in 2013

Russian Railways president Vladimir Yakunin stated the road construction costed more than 200 billion rubles.

In addition, Sochi&#x27;s railway stations were renovated. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta, Khosta, Lazarevskaya, and Loo railway stations. In Adler, a new railway station was built while the original building was preserved, and in the Olympic park cluster, a new station was built from scratch, the Olympic Park railway station. Another new railway station was built in Estosadok, close to Krasnaya Polyana.

===Other infrastructure===

Funds were spent on the construction of hotels for 10,300 guests. The first of the Olympic hotels, Zvezdny (&quot;Stellar&quot;), was rebuilt anew. Significant funds were spent on the construction of an advanced sewage treatment system in Sochi, designed by Olimpstroy. The system meets BREF standards and employs top available technologies for environment protection, including tertiary treatment with microfiltration.

Six post offices were opened at competition venues, two of them in the main media centre in Olympic Park and in the mountain village of Estosadok. In addition to standard services, customers had access to unique services including two new products, Fotomarka and Retropismo. Fotomarka presents an opportunity to get a stylised sheet of eight souvenir stamps with one&#x27;s own photos, using the services of a photographer in the office. Retropismo service allows a customer to write with their own stylus or pen on antique paper with further letters, winding string and wax seal affixing. All the new sites and post offices in Sochi were opened during the Olympics until late night 7 days a week, and employees were trained to speak English.

On 29 September 2013, the Olympic torch was lit in Ancient Olympia, beginning a seven-day journey across Greece and on to Russia, then the torch relay started at Moscow on 7 October 2013 before passing 83 Russian cities and arriving at Sochi on the day of the opening ceremony, 7 February 2014. It is the longest torch relay in Olympic history, a route that passes through all regions of the country, from Kaliningrad in the west to Chukotka in the east.

The Olympic torch reached the North Pole for first time via a nuclear-powered icebreaker &quot;(50 Let Pobedy)&quot;. The torch was also passed for the first time in space, though not lit for the duration of the flight for safety reasons, on flight Soyuz TMA-11M to the International Space Station (ISS). The spacecraft itself was adorned with Olympic-themed livery including the Games&#x27; emblem. Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazansky waved the torch on a spacewalk outside the ISS. The torch returned to Earth five days later on board Soyuz TMA-09M. The torch also reached Europe&#x27;s highest mountain, Mount Elbrus, and Siberia&#x27;s Lake Baikal.

===Opening ceremony===


The opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics was held on 7 February 2014 at Fisht Olympic Stadium, an indoor arena built specifically for the ceremonies. The ceremony featured scenes based around aspects of Russian history and arts, including ballet, classical music, the Russian Revolution, and the age of the Soviet Union. The opening scene of the ceremony featured a notable technical error, where one of five snowflakes, which were to expand to form the Olympic rings, malfunctioned and did not expand (a mishap mocked by the organizers at the closing ceremony where one of the roundrelay dance groups symbolizing the Olympic rings &quot;failed&quot; to expand). The torch was taken into the stadium by Maria Sharapova, who then passed it to Yelena Isinbayeva who, in turn, passed it to wrestler Aleksandr Karelin. Karelin then passed the torch to gymnast Alina Kabaeva. Figure skater Irina Rodnina took the torch and was met by former ice hockey goalkeeper Vladislav Tretiak, who exited the stadium to jointly light the Olympic cauldron located near the center of Olympic Park.

===Participating National Olympic Committees===
A record 88 nations qualified to compete, which beat the previous record of 82 set at the previous Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses). Seven nations made their Winter Olympics debut: Dominica, Malta, Paraguay, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, and Zimbabwe. Meanwhile, the Philippines returned to the Winter games after a 22-year absence, and Thailand, Virgin Islands, Luxembourg and Venezuela returned after 8 years. The Winter debut of Malta meant that for the first time ever, all of the current members of the European Olympic Committees participated at the Winter Olympics.

Kristina Krone qualified to compete in her second consecutive games for Puerto Rico, but the island&#x27;s Olympic Committee once again chose not to send her to compete. Similarly, South Africa decided not to send alpine skier Sive Speelman to Sochi. Algeria also did not enter its only qualified athlete, Mehdi-Selim Khelifi.

India&#x27;s athletes originally competed as Independent Olympic Participants and marched under the Olympic flag during the opening ceremony, as India was originally suspended in December 2012 over the election process of the Indian Olympic Association. On 11 February, the Indian Olympic Association was reinstated and India&#x27;s athletes were allowed the option to compete under their own flag from that time onward. Although Shiva Keshavan competed as an Independent athlete and is recorded as such, he was permitted to walk under the flag of India at the Closing Ceremony.



====National houses====
During the Games some countries had a national house, a meeting place for supporters, athletes and other followers. Houses could be either free for visitors to access or have limited access by invitation only.
===Sports===
The 2014 Winter Olympics featured 98 events over 15 disciplines in 7 sports. A total of twelve new events were contested, making it the largest Winter Olympics to date.

&quot;Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each separate discipline.&quot;

==== New events ====

On 6 April 2011, the IOC accepted a number of events that were submitted by their respective sports federations to be considered for inclusion into the official program of these Olympic Games.
The events included a Figure skating team event, Women&#x27;s ski jumping, Mixed relay biathlon, Ski half-pipe, and Team relay luge.

On 4 July 2011, the IOC announced that three events would be added to the program. These events, which were officially declared by Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge on 4 July 2011, were: Ski slopestyle, Snowboard slopestyle, Snowboard parallel special slalom.

Team alpine skiing was also presented as a candidate for inclusion in the Olympic program but the executive board of the IOC rejected this proposal. The International Ski Federation persisted with the nomination and this was considered. There were reports of bandy possibly being added to the sports program, but the IOC rejected this request. Subsequently, the international governing body, Federation of International Bandy, decided that Irkutsk and Shelekhov in Russia would host the 2014 Bandy World Championship just before the Olympics.

On 28 November 2006, the executive board of the IOC decided not to include ski mountaineering, ski-orienteering, or winter triathlon in the review process of the program.

===Closing ceremony===

The closing ceremony was held on 23 February 2014 between 20:14 MSK (UTC+4) and 22:25 MSK (UTC+4) at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi.
The ceremony was dedicated to Russian culture featuring world-renowned Russian stars like conductor and violinist Yuri Bashmet, conductor Valery Gergiev, pianist Denis Matsuev, singer Hibla Gerzmava and violinist Tatiana Samouil. These artists were joined by performers from the Bolshoi and Mariinsky theaters.

==Medals==
Sochi&#x27;s medal design was unveiled in May 2013. The design is intended to resemble Sochi&#x27;s landscape, with a semi-translucent section containing a &quot;patchwork quilt&quot; of diamonds representing mountains; the diamonds themselves contain designs that reflect Russia&#x27;s regions. Those who won gold medals on 15 February received special medals with fragments of the Chelyabinsk meteor, marking the one-year anniversary of the event where pieces of the cosmic body fell into the Chebarkul Lake in the Ural Mountains in central Russia.

===Medal table===
The top ten listed NOCs by number of gold medals are listed below. The host nation, Russia, is highlighted.
===Podium sweeps===

 Legkov and Vylegzhanin were initially disqualified by the IOC for doping offenses in November 2017, and their 2014 Olympic medals (gold and silver respectively) were stripped. However, their results were restored on 1 February 2018 following a successful appeal.

==Calendar==

==Security==

===Measures===
Security during both the Olympics and Paralympics were handled by over 40,000 law enforcement officials, including police and the Russian Armed Forces. A presidential decree signed by President Vladimir Putin took effect on 7 January, requiring that any protests and demonstrations in Sochi and the surrounding area through 21 March (the end of the Paralympics) be approved by the Federal Security Service. For the duration of the decree, travel restrictions were also in effect in and around Sochi: &quot;controlled&quot; zones, dubbed the &quot;ring of steel&quot; by the media, covered the Coastal and Mountain clusters which encompass all of the Games&#x27; venues and infrastructure, including transport hubs such as railway stations. To enter controlled areas, visitors were required to pass through security checkpoints with X-ray machines, metal detectors and explosive material scanners. Several areas were designated as &quot;forbidden&quot;, including Sochi National Park and the border with Abkhazia. An unmanned aerial vehicle squadron, along with S-400 and Pantsir-S1 air defense rockets were used to protect Olympic airspace. Four gunboats were also deployed on the Black Sea to protect the coastline.

A number of security organizations and forces began stationing in and around Sochi in January 2014; Russia&#x27;s Ministry of Emergency Situations (EMERCOM) was stationed in Sochi for the Games beginning on 7 January 2014. A group of 10,000 Internal Troops of the Ministry of Interior also provided security services during the Games. In mid-January, 1,500 Siberian Regional Command troops were stationed in a military town near Krasnaya Polyana. A group of 400 Cossacks in traditional uniforms were also present to accompany police patrols. The 58th Army unit of the Russian Armed Forces were defending the Georgia–Russia border. The United States also supplied Navy ships and other assets for security purposes.

All communication and Internet traffic by Sochi residents was captured and filtered through deep packet inspection systems at all mobile networks using the SORM system.

Former professional speed skater and current deputy of the Russian State Duma Svetlana Zhurova has stated that the 2014 Sochi Olympics were Vladimir Putin&#x27;s personal project to showcase Russia to the world.

===Incidents and threats===
Organizers received several threats prior to the Games. In a July 2013 video release, Chechen Islamist commander Dokka Umarov called for attacks on the Games, stating that the Games were being staged &quot;on the bones of many, many Muslims killed ... and buried on our lands extending to the Red Sea&quot;.

Threats were received from the group Vilayat Dagestan, which had claimed responsibility for the Volgograd bombings under the demands of Umarov, and a number of National Olympic Committees had also received threats via e-mail, threatening that terrorists would kidnap or &quot;blow up&quot; athletes during the Games. However, while the IOC did state that the letters &quot;[contained] no threat and appears to be a random message from a member of the public&quot;, the U.S. ski and snowboarding teams hired a private security agency to provide additional protection during the Games.

==Media==

===Broadcasting rights===
In most regions, broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics were packaged together with broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well. Domestic broadcast rights were sold by Sportfive to a consortium of three Russian broadcasters: Channel One, VGTRK, and NTV Plus.

In the United States, the 2014 Winter Olympics were the first in a new, US$4.38 billion contract with NBCUniversal, extending its broadcast rights to the Olympic Games through 2020.

In Canada, after losing the 2010 and 2012 Games to Bell Media and Rogers Media, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation re-gained broadcast rights to the Olympics for the first time since 2008, gaining rights to the 2014 and 2016 Games. Bell and Rogers sub-licensed pay-TV rights for their TSN, Sportsnet and Réseau des sports networks, as well as TVA Group&#x27;s TVA Sports.

In Australia, after all three major commercial networks pulled out of bidding on rights to both the 2014 and 2016 Games due to cost concerns, the IOC awarded broadcast rights to just the 2014 Winter Olympics to Network Ten for A$20 million.

===Filming===
Several broadcasters used the Games to trial the emerging ultra high definition television (UHDTV) standard. Both NTV Plus and Comcast filmed portions of the Games in 4K resolution; Comcast offered its content through smart TV apps, while NTV+ held public and cinema viewings of the content. NHK filmed portions of the Games in 8K resolution for public viewing. Olympic sponsor Panasonic filmed the opening ceremony in 4K.

==Concerns and controversies==

A variety of concerns over the Games, or Russia&#x27;s hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities. Concerns were shown over Russia&#x27;s policies surrounding the LGBT community, including the government&#x27;s denial of a proposed Pride House for the Games on moral grounds, and a federal law passed in June 2013 which criminalized the distribution of &quot;propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships&quot; among minors. Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history, with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials, and Allison Stewart of the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms. It was reported that Putin&#x27;s annexation of Crimea may have been intended to distract local Russians from corruption stories related to the Games.

U.S. broadcaster NBC largely avoided broadcasting material critical of Russia, although several segments deemed &quot;overly friendly to Russia&quot; were criticized by some commentators.

Following the closing ceremony, commentators evaluated the Games to have been successful overall.

=== Circassian genocide ===

Some Circassian organizations objected to the Games being held on land their ancestors held until 1864, when most of them were displaced at the end of the Russian-Circassian War (1763–1864), in the Circassian genocide. The use of Krasnaya Polyana (&quot;Red Hill&quot; or &quot;Red Glade&quot;) as an event site was considered insensitive, as it was named for a group of Circassians who were defeated in a bloody battle with Russians while attempting to return home over it in 1864. Some Circassian groups demanded that the Games be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologized for their actions. Other groups did not outright object to the Games, but suggested that symbols of Circassian history and culture be incorporated into the Games, as Australia, the United States and Canada did for their indigenous cultures in 2000, 2002, and 2010 respectively.

===Russian doping scandal===
Following the Games, reports began to emerge that the Russian Olympic team had participated in a state-run doping program, which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. These allegations first emerged in a December 2014 documentary by German public broadcaster ARD, and were detailed further in a May 2016 report by &quot;The New York Times&quot;—which published allegations by Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia&#x27;s anti-doping laboratory. Rodchenkov alleged that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, FSB intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games. Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that at least fifteen of the Russian medals won in Sochi were the result of doping.

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) commissioned an independent report by Richard McLaren, which corroborated claims that Russian authorities had been discreetly swapping out urine samples that tested positive for performance-enhancing substances. The report concluded that the program had been operating from &quot;at least late 2011 to August 2015&quot;, and had covered up 643 positive samples across Olympic and non-Olympic sports. As a result, WADA considered the Russian Anti-Doping Agency to be non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code, and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Russia was not banned from the 2016 Olympics by the IOC, a decision that was widely criticized by both athletes and writers; the IOC only required Russia&#x27;s athletes to be cleared by an internal panel and their respective sports federations. The IAAF had suspended Russia from international track and field events due to the scandal, but did allow Darya Klishina to participate in the Olympics because she was confirmed not to be a part of a doping program, despite claims that surfaced in her appeal that a sample of Klishina&#x27;s that had been collected on 26 February 2014 had yielded an illegal testosterone/epitestosterone ratio of 8.5 had been subject
to a &quot;SAVE&quot; order by the Ministry of Sport on 3 March 2014. The International Paralympic Committee suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee and banned the team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics.

On 5 December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, thus banning it from sending athletes under the Russian flag to the 2018 Winter Olympics. Cleared Russian athletes were allowed to participate as &quot;Olympic Athletes from Russia&quot; (OAR). Two of them – curler Alexander Krushelnitskiy, who won a bronze medal, and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva – failed drug tests during the Games.

The IOC&#x27;s Oswald Commission disqualified and banned 43 Russian athletes, and stripped thirteen medals they earned in Sochi. In December 2017, 42 of the 43 punished athletes appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). On 1 February 2018, the CAS found that the IOC provided insufficient evidence and cleared 28 athletes from IOC sanctions. In total, Russian athletes won back 9 of the 13 medals collected. For 11 other athletes, the CAS decided that there was sufficient evidence to uphold their Sochi sanctions, but reduced their lifetime bans to only the 2018 Winter Olympics. The IOC said in a statement that &quot;the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the [2018 Winter Olympic] Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation&quot; and that &quot;this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping&quot;. The IOC found it important to note that the CAS Secretary General &quot;insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent” and that they would consider an appeal against the court&#x27;s decision. Later that month, the Russian Olympic Committee was reinstated by the IOC, despite failed doping tests during the 2018 Olympics, and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency was re-certified in September, despite the Russian officials not accepting the McLaren report.

===Subsequent events===
Just 4 days after the closing of the Games, Russian troops entered Ukrainian Crimea and started the formal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. Russia formally incorporated Crimea into its territory on 14 March 2014.

<doc id="893230" wikidata="Q1396593" url="?curid=893230" title="Farfisa">
<text>Farfisa () is a manufacturer of electronics based in Osimo, Italy, founded in 1946. The company manufactured a series of compact electronic organs in the 1960s and 1970s, including the Compact, FAST, Professional and VIP ranges, and later, a series of other keyboard instruments. They were used by a number of popular musicians, including Sam the Sham, Country Joe and the Fish, Pink Floyd, Sly Stone, Blondie, Suicide and the B-52s.

The company was formed after three Italian accordion manufacturers combined to form a single company. They began to produce electronic instruments in the late 1950s, and combo organs were introduced in response to similar instruments such as the Vox Continental. The relatively inexpensive Italian labour allowed Farfisa to sell their products cheaper than the competition, which led to their commercial success. Popular models included the Compact series introduced in 1964, the Professional in 1967, the FAST in 1968 and the VIP in 1970. The success of Farfisa organs declined with the increased popularity of the Hammond organ in rock groups during the 1970s, and in response the company produced models that could emulate a Hammond, and introduced electronic pianos and synthesisers. The Farfisa brand name saw a brief revival in the late 1970s as part of the new wave movement, and the final models were produced in the early 1980s. The company has survived, and Farfisa is now a consumer electronics manufacturer.

==History==
The background to Farfisa was the popularity of the accordion in early 20th-century Italy. Silvio Scandalli started making these instruments by hand, commuting to Castelfidardo, Ancona daily. He was hoping to work for Paolo Soprani, who established the country&#x27;s first accordion factory. He founded the Scandalli Brothers, who grew to employ from 400–700 people in their accordion factories. Farfisa was established in 1946, following the mergers of Settimo Soprani, Scandalli and Frontalini, whose businesses had suffered during World War II. The company was officially named (United Italian Accordion Factories), and production continued in Castelfidardo. It quickly became the world&#x27;s largest supplier of accordions, making up to 180 instruments a day with over 1,600 employees. The International Accordion Museum now occupies the site of the original factory.

During the 1950s, after sales of accordions began to decline, Farfisa began to diversify its range of instruments including radios, televisions and musical instruments. The Microrgan, a portable reed organ, was released in 1958; it used an electric fan to blow air across the reeds. Two years later, the company developed the Cordovox accordion with Lowrey, which combined accordion reeds with electronically generated sounds.

Following the introduction of the Vox Continental combo organ in 1962, Farfisa decided to quickly build a competing instrument using the technical expertise they had gained from working with Lowrey. The first model, the Combo Compact, was introduced in 1964. Production was moved to a factory in Aspio Terme. The relatively cheap labour in Italy, compared to the UK and US meant that Farfisa were able to produce a greater quantity of combo organs at a cheaper cost, and consequently, they were picked up by many amateur and semi-professional groups. For example, the list price of a Farfisa Mini Compact in 1966 was $495, compared to $995 of the Vox Continental a year before. Distribution in the U.S. was handled by the Chicago Musical Instruments Company, which also owned Gibson, and the instruments were originally known as CMI organs when introduced there. This design was copied for later combo organs such as the Gibson G-101. The organs also had a flip-down modesty panel displaying the brand name.

The line of FAST (Farfisa All-Silicon Transistorized) organs was launched at the 1968 NAMM Convention. These superseded the earlier Compact models based on germanium transistors and were styled like the Vox Continental, including chrome stands. The Professional series appeared around the same time and included more features than earlier models. The VIP models were introduced in 1970 and included a foot-operated pitch bend. At the height of its production, Farfisa operated three factories to produce instruments in Camerano in the Marche region of Italy.

By the late 1960s, major groups had moved on from combo organs and started to prefer the sound of a Hammond organ with an overdriven Leslie speaker, which were used by contemporary groups such as Yes, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Deep Purple and Uriah Heep. In response, Farfisa advertised that its latest organs at that point could emulate a Hammond and had a full set of drawbars. The American conglomerate Lear Siegler became a major controlling interest in 1968. Production of combo organs began to be phased out in the late 1970s, after synthesizers had become more commonplace, with the last unit being produced in 1982. The company faced increased competition from Japanese companies and struggled to handle the departure of the Scandalli family from the company. However, Farfisa has survived into the 21st century, and the brand mainly produces intercom systems with the company ACI Farfisa, which makes and distributes systems for video intercoms, access control, video surveillance, and home automation. The Bontempi group owns the rights for Farfisa keyboards.

==Models==
===Compact Series (1964–1968)===

The Compact series contains four models – Combo Compact, Mini Compact, Compact Deluxe and Compact Duo. They have 12 tone generator boards; one for each note of the scale, and use a frequency divider to generate the remaining notes. Unlike later organs, the Compact series is not fully transistorised, and includes high-voltage tube circuitry for the reverb unit. On most single-manual models the tone controls and a bass section volume are located on an indented panel on the rear of the instrument. Underneath the keyboards, there is a knee-high lever that can be actuated for tone boost, turned on by rocker levers on the console. The series features a photoresistor-driven swell pedal, instead of the later and more common potentiometer. There are two jack outputs, the second of which is optional and can be used to send the bass through a different amplifier. There is also a headphone output jack, but it&#x27;s designed for now-obsolete 2000 ohm-impedance headphones. Though advertised as a &quot;transistorised&quot; model, the spring reverb tank is valve-driven. An optional 13-note bass pedalboard can be added to all models except the Mini-Compact. Unlike other combo organs like the Vox Continental, Farfisa Compact organs have integrated legs, which can be folded up and stored inside its base.

The Combo Compact has a five-octave keyboard, one of which of bass with inverse key colors, 16&#x27; bass and strings, 8&#x27; flute, oboe, trumpet and strings, 4&#x27; flute, piccolo and strings, four vibrato settings, three choices of reverb and three bass volume switches. It has a built-in spring reverb system.
The Mini Compact is the smallest of the Compact Series, and was introduced in 1966. It has only four octaves, with no bass on the early models. The later version has a selector switch to choose bass or high sound in the lowest octave; these models have grey naturals with white sharps in the bass octave. Some of these extended bass models have only three voices (sounds), while the later models had six voices. Early compact models including the Mini Compact and Mini Deluxe Compact have three tone switches – dolce, principale and strings, in 16&#x27;, 8&#x27; and 4&#x27; footages. Later models include 16&#x27; bass, 8&#x27; flute, oboe, strings and 4&#x27; flute and strings. The first models have removable legs which could be stored inside the bottom cover, as opposed to later models that have folding or pivoting non-removable ones.
The Compact Duo was introduced in 1966. It weighs and supports 49-key manuals. It features a four-octave upper keyboard with 9 selectors: 16&#x27; Bass, Strings; 8&#x27; Flute, Oboe, Trumpet, Strings; 4&#x27; Flute, Strings; 2-2/3&#x27; (Flute) and Brilliance, and a four-octave lower keyboard with three selectors: Dolce, Principale and Ottava. There are two inferior octaves on the left-hand side of the lower keyboard; one octave is switch-controllable for choice of a bass or acute sound. The instrument has four vibrato and three reverb settings. Later models also incorporate tremolo, percussion and repeat functions for both the upper and lower treble manuals independently. Unlike other Compact series organs, the Compact Duo models require a separate power supply/solid-state preamp/real spring reverb unit (called the Farfisa F/AR), to which the organ connects via a multi-lead cable. Alternatively, it can be powered by a separate Farfisa TR/60 amplifier.

Farfisa updated the Compact range through the 1960s, adding new features, but without changing the general model name. Later Compact models, such as the Combo Compact I introduced in 1968, include two inferior octaves (one black/white, one grey/white) on the left hand side of the keyboard. One set of octaves is switch-controllable for choice of a bass or acute sound with bass note sustain and controllable bass percussion. The volume balance between bass and treble is adjustable. The Compact Deluxe features similar controls to the Compact I, with additional voices such as the 2-2/3&#x27; footage with an independent &quot;brilliant&quot; tab. Later models, such as the Combo Deluxe Compact I, also include a rhythm section (drum machine) of brush cymbal and drum. The final Compact models were manufactured in 1969.

The Compact series has caused reliability problems for later collectors. It features germanium transistors which tend to drift in value, and the plastic keys have tended to degrade over time, leaving cracks. Other problems include corroded contacts, leading to non-working switchings, and failing electrolytic capacitors. The design of the instrument makes it difficult to access components and service them.

===FAST Series (1968–1971)===

The FAST (Farfisa All Silicon Transistor) Series models were first introduced in 1967, to complement the existing Combo series. As the name implies, these use silicon transistors that produced more stable tones than the germanium ones used in the Compact series. The organs are contained in a metal cabinet covered with a skin plate and plastic edges, chrome folding legs, retractable carrying handles, and a removable music rack.

The Fast 2 has a four-octave keyboard (C to C) with a one-octave manual bass on the left. There are four voice stops (flute, clarinet, reed and strings), all at 8&#x27;, a two-speed vibrato and an optional swell pedal. The Fast 3 features more sounds, including 16&#x27; bass and clarinet, 8&#x27; oboe and trumpet, and with 8&#x27; and 4&#x27; flute. The Fast 4 has a larger five-octave keyboard, with an additional light / heavy vibrato option, two mixture stops and five percussion controls. The Fast 5 adds three sustain stops.

===Professional Series (1968–1975)===

The Professional series were the most sophisticated models made by Farfisa, first announced in August 1968 and designed to compete with the Hammond. Contemporary advertising emphasised that these series of instruments did not sound like other combo organs and could be used for soul and rhythm and blues effectively. The instruments included sustain, eight different footages, a variety of percussion and vibrato options.

The Professional (Model PP/222 and PP/221) contains a single keyboard with grey keys. The vibrato uses a phase shifter circuit that is placed after the main oscillators, as this was the only way to make individual controls for each voice work. The Professional Duo is a double-manual version with bass pedals, a swell pedal and a slalom pedal. There is an optional amplifier and speaker unit, the PAS 55, that can be placed between the organ and pedals, to resemble a spinet organ. The Professional Piano was an electronic piano. There were two different models, whose main difference was the location of the split point between bass and treble.

The VIP-series organs were announced in 1970, which included a &quot;Synthe-Slalom&quot; foot pedal used for pitch bend.
===Later models===

The Transicord was a transistor electric accordion, and is essentially the circuitry for a Compact-series organ in an accordion-shaped box. There are no reeds; the instrument is purely electronic. It was designed to be used in conjunction with Farfisa&#x27;s amplifiers, and has a multi-pin cable that connects the controls of the accordion with the controls of the amplifier, or the F/AR Reverb preamp power supply unit.

The Farfisa Matador was introduced in 1972. Unlike earlier instruments, it uses drawbars to select a variable amount of sound, like a Hammond. The lowest 17 keys cover the manual bass section. The Matador-M was compact version that used tabs.

In 1975, Farfisa introduced the Stereo Syntorchestra synthesiser, that combined a polyphonic string ensemble with a monophonic analogue synth. It features a three-octave keyboard, and separate outputs for the monophonic and polyphonic sections. The Soundmaker was Farfisa&#x27;s next non-organ instrument, with a further development of the synthesizer approach, incorporating an improved string sound and more modifiable monophonic synthesiser sounds. It was mainly sold in continental Europe. This was followed by the Polychrome, built at the end of the 1970s. It was Farfisa&#x27;s largest and most feature-rich non-organ instrument, as an analog synthesizer featuring vocal, brass, string, and percussion sections, including a built in chorus, phase, modulation and aftertouch.

Among the last combo organs made by Farfisa were the Bravo and Commander, released in 1980. The Commander reprised part of the design of the VIP 205 in updated form, while the lightweight and simple Bravo&#x27;s sound was a move to compete with emerging portable keyboards and synthesisers.
==Notable users==
===1960s===

One of the first rock organists to play and spotlight the Farfisa was Domingo Samudio, known as &quot;Sam the Sham&quot;, who played a Combo Compact with his group The Pharaohs, who had their first hit &quot;Wooly Bully&quot; in 1965. In 1967, it was the main instrument in the Strawberry Alarm Clock&#x27;s hit &quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot;. Other groups using Farfisas around this time included The Blues Magoos, The Blues Project and Country Joe and the Fish. Some sources suggest The Doors&#x27; Ray Manzarek upgraded from a Vox Continental to a Farfisa, but he actually used a Gibson G-101. Spooner Oldham, the house organist of Alabama recording studio Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, can be heard playing the Farfisa on numerous southern soul recordings from the 1960s, including &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot; by Percy Sledge.

Richard Wright&#x27;s use of the Farfisa was integral to Pink Floyd&#x27;s early sound, and was his main instrument on the albums from &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; (1967) to &quot;Ummagumma&quot; (1969), as well as live performances, such as on &quot;Careful with That Axe, Eugene&quot;. Wright started with a Combo Compact, before progressing to a Compact Duo. By 1970, he had started to use a Hammond onstage and alternated between that and the Farfisa, depending on the song. The Farfisa was last used on &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973), but Wright reintroduced it to his keyboard setup on David Gilmour&#x27;s 2006 tour, featured on the Pink Floyd song &quot;Echoes&quot;. Hugh Banton from Van der Graaf Generator originally used the Farfisa Compact Duo, before switching to a Professional after the band&#x27;s gear was stolen. He applied his knowledge of electronics and contacts as a former BBC engineer to customise it with a variety of additional effects pedals, including distortion and phasing. He later started using a Hammond organ as an additional instrument. The Professional was retired after the group&#x27;s 1972 split.

The Grateful Dead&#x27;s Ron &quot;Pigpen&quot; McKernan&#x27;s first keyboard with the group was a Farfisa Compact, before switching to a Vox and then a Hammond. Sly Stone from Sly and the Family Stone played a Farfisa Professional, as seen at their 1969 Woodstock Festival performance. Composer Philip Glass began using Farfisa organs with his ensemble in the late 1960s. A Mini-Compact was played by him and Michael Riesman on some of Glass&#x27; early recordings, including &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;; Glass is still in possession of his original Farfisa as of 2018. Steve Reich featured four Farfisa organs in his piece Four Organs.

===1970s===
Elton John used the Farfisa on several early recordings, including the 1972 hit &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot;. He called the Farfisa &quot;the worst organ sound possible&quot; and used it in order to sound like Johnny and the Hurricanes. John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin used a Farfisa on &quot;Dancing Days&quot; from &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;.

Mike Oldfield&#x27;s album &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; (1973) features a Farfisa organ as one of the instruments. Can&#x27;s Irmin Schmidt regularly used the Professional and Professional Piano. The Syntorchestra was used by Klaus Schulze on several albums, including &quot;Moondawn&quot;. Manuel Göttsching played the instrument on &quot;New Age of Earth&quot;.

After the introduction of synthesizers, Farfisa combo organs became less popular, but were revived in the late 1970s by several punk rock and new wave bands (especially those influenced by 1960s garage rock and psychedelia). Blondie&#x27;s Jimmy Destri used the Farfisa as his main instrument, and included stage tricks such as playing it with a hammer. Other groups from this period using Farfisas included The B-52&#x27;s and Talking Heads. Numerous songs by the Industrial group Cabaret Voltaire use Farfisa drum machines and organs.

===Later recordings===
Inspiral Carpets&#x27; Clint Boon&#x27;s main instrument was a Farfisa Compact Duo. The Post-rock group Stereolab used various Farfisa organs extensively throughout their career, beginning with a Bravo model they found cheaply in a second-hand store.

Green Day used a Farfisa organ on the song &quot;Misery&quot; from the album &quot;Warning&quot;, played by their bassist Mike Dirnt.

==Emulations==
The sound of a Farfisa has been hard to accurately synthesise. In 2016, Arturia released a Farfisa V audio plugin that can be played using a MIDI keyboard or controller. It emulates the Combo Compact and the Compact Duo, along with a number of effects boxes and amplifier simulations. The Nord Stage includes a Farfisa emulation.

<text>Panayotis Alexander Lalas (; born June 1, 1970) is an American former soccer player who played mostly as a defender. Lalas is best known for his participation with the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, where his appearance made him a standout player on the team with his distinctive long beard and hair. After the World Cup, Lalas went on to become the first American in Italy&#x27;s Serie A as a member of Calcio Padova.

Lalas would later return to the United States in 1996 to take part in the newly formed Major League Soccer, as a member of New England Revolution. Lalas also played with Club Sport Emelec of Ecuador, and the MLS squads MetroStars and Kansas City Wizards, but his most successful period was with Los Angeles Galaxy, with whom he won the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup, Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup and MLS Cup before retiring in 2003. Lalas&#x27; playing style was characterized by physicality and endurance.

Following his playing career, Lalas served as general manager of the San Jose Earthquakes, New York Red Bulls, and Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer. He was elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 2006. He currently works as an analyst for Fox Sports. He also was a reporter at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

==Early life==
Lalas was born in Birmingham, Michigan, United States, to a Greek father, Demetrios Lalas and an American mother, Anne Harding Woodworth. His father was a professor who later became the director of Greece&#x27;s national observatory, while his mother is a widely published poet. His younger brother, Greg Lalas, is a former professional soccer player and currently the Chief Marketing Officer at United Soccer League.

==Club career==

===High school===
Lalas attended Cranbrook Kingswood School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Even though he did not begin playing soccer until he was eleven, he had developed his skills enough to be named the 1987 Michigan High School Player of the Year by his senior year. In addition to playing soccer, he was a member and captain of his high school hockey team, which won the state championship. Lalas was rated for the Ontario Hockey League Midget draft in 1987, but was ultimately not selected.

=== College ===
Lalas attended Rutgers University, where after trying out and playing some spring matches and an indoor tournament in 1988, he played on the men&#x27;s soccer team from 1988 to 1991. During his four seasons at Rutgers with the Scarlet Knights he reached the NCAA Final Four in 1989 and the National Championship Game in 1990.
Lalas was named a third-team All-American in 1989 and 1990. In 1991, he gained first-team All-American recognition and was selected for both the Hermann Trophy and the Missouri Athletic Club Player of the Year award. As he did in high school, Lalas also played hockey in college, leading the team in scoring in 1989.

Lalas left Rutgers in 1991 to focus on the U.S. national team despite being interested in finishing his degree. He resumed his education in 2013, when Rutgers began offering enough online classes to fulfill what Lalas required to graduate. Lalas took 12 classes and 36 credits over 10 months to finish what he jokingly called &quot;a 26-year plan&quot;, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English with a minor in music in May 2014.

After college and the 1992 Summer Olympics, Lalas trained with former Arsenal player Bob McNab in California. This led to a trial with Arsenal during the winter of 1992. It was quickly determined that Lalas did not have the quality for a first-team spot. As a result, Lalas only had a few training sessions with the reserve team before being cut shortly after his arrival in North London. Lalas then returned home to Detroit and spent a month reluctant about his future in soccer before coach Bora Milutinovic invited him for the United States tryouts in Mission Viejo, California.

===Padova===
After the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Lalas signed with Italian Serie A club Padova. While Lalas anchored the team&#x27;s defense and scored three goals off set pieces (including against A.C. Milan and Internazionale), Padova finished the 1994–95 season 14th in the table. Only after winning a relegation play-off on June 10, 1995, did the team ensure its survival in the top ranks for the next season. On June 25, 1995, Major League Soccer (MLS) signed Lalas to play for one of the new league&#x27;s teams. While MLS had intended to begin playing in 1995, it had run into difficulties and so delayed the first season until 1996. In order to allow Lalas to maintain his match fitness, MLS loaned him back to Padova for the 1995–96 season. Lalas last played for Padova in a home game against Lazio on February 25, 1996.

===Major League Soccer===
Before the inaugural Major League Soccer (MLS) draft in February 1996, the league allocated high-profile players throughout the league&#x27;s ten teams (except for the Dallas Burn, which alone amongst all MLS sides never received a U.S. national team allocation from the 1994 World Cup era). As part of this process, MLS placed Lalas with the New England Revolution on October 7, 1995.

Lalas was a regular on the Revs backline during the 1996 and 1997 seasons, starting 25 matches in 1996 and 29 in 1997. Lalas made his Revolution debut in the club&#x27;s first-ever match, against Tampa Bay Mutiny on April 13, 1996, and recorded the first assist in Revolution history (in conjunction with Wélton), setting up Robert Ukrop for the team&#x27;s first-ever goal, in the 20th minute. Lalas made his home debut on April 27 against D.C. United. He scored his first Revolution goal in the team&#x27;s 4–2 win over Tampa Bay on August 26.

Lalas was named an MLS All-Star in both 1996 and again in 1997, but famously clashed with Revolution head coach Frank Stapleton during the 1996 season, ultimately being benched in August following a 6-1 drubbing to the San Jose Clash. Tensions arose after Lalas&#x27; Revolution teammate (and friend from his time in Padova) Giuseppe Galderisi was traded after only four games. Lalas referred to his Revolution tenure under Stapleton a &quot;joke&quot; and a &quot;nightmare from the beginning.&quot; At his request, the Revolution attempted to trade Lalas during the summer transfer window but could not find an interested party.

In November 1997, the Revolution loaned Lalas to Ecuadorian First Division Club Emelec for a month. He returned to New England at the end of December only to find himself traded to the MetroStars on February 4, 1998 in what would become the first three-team trade in MLS history.

The deal saw New England acquire Raúl Díaz Arce from D.C. United in exchange for Lalas and a second-round pick in the 1999 MLS College Draft, which were traded to the MetroStars, with the MetroStars’ second-round pick in the 1999 MLS College Draft and future considerations going to
D.C. United along with New England&#x27;s first-round pick in
the 1999 MLS College Draft. He spent the 1998 season with the MetroStars before being traded, along with Tony Meola, to the Kansas City Wizards for Mark Chung and Mike Ammann on January 28, 1999. Lalas spent one season with the Wizards before announcing his retirement on October 10, 1999. Lalas was named to the MLS All-Star team in both the 1998 and 1999 seasons.

Just over a year later, he returned to playing when he signed with the Los Angeles Galaxy as a discovery player on January 16, 2001. Lalas&#x27; tenure with the Galaxy was some of the most decorated of his career. In 2001, Lalas helped the Galaxy win the 2000 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup and also the 2001 U.S. Open Cup ( the latter against his former club, New England). The next year, Lalas helped the Galaxy win the 2002 Supporters&#x27; Shield and MLS Cup 2002 (the latter against his former club, New England). He was named to the 2002 MLS Best XI.
Nearly three years later, he retired again, this time permanently, on January 12, 2004.

==International career==
Lalas earned 96 caps, scoring nine goals, with the United States national team between 1991 and 1998. His first cap came in a 2–2 tie with Mexico on March 12, 1991, in the 1991 NAFC Championship. He gained his second cap four days later in a 2–0 win over Canada. While he started both games, he did not gain another cap until he came on for Fernando Clavijo in a 2–2 tie with Denmark on January 30, 1993. His next game, a start, came on March 23, 1993, in a 2–2 tie with El Salvador. While he became a fixture on the team through the rest of 1993, he did not cement his position as a starter in the U.S. central defense until the beginning of 1994. He went on to start and play all ninety minutes in the four U.S. games of the 1994 FIFA World Cup and was named an honorable mention All-Star. On June 11, 1995, Lalas flew directly from a relegation playoff game with his club team, Padova, in order to appear in the second half of a 1995 U.S. Cup victory over Nigeria. His contributions to the national team led to his selection as the 1995 U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year. He also scored in a game against Saudi Arabia, in which the United States had their biggest comeback in their history (from 3–0 to 4–3; Lalas scored the first goal for the United States). While Lalas was on the roster for the U.S. at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, he never entered a game. His last cap had come in the final U.S. tuneup for the finals, a May 30, 1998, scoreless tie with Scotland where he was a second-half substitute for Earnie Stewart.

Lalas was part of the United States Olympic soccer team for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Spain. He was also selected as overage player on the United States Olympic soccer team at the 1996 Summer Olympics.

== Post-playing career ==

Lalas served as president and general manager of the San Jose Earthquakes during the 2004 and 2005 MLS seasons. He served as a general manager of the MetroStars/New York Red Bulls from 2005 to 2006. Lalas served as President of the LA Galaxy from 2006 to 2008 during which time the club signed David Beckham. Following his time at the Galaxy, Lalas spent six years as a commentator for ESPN before signing a commentary deal with Fox Sports. He also appeared in both &quot;FIFA 16&quot; and &quot;FIFA 17&quot;, by EA Sports, as a legend card having an 86 rated center back card in both iterations of the game. Currently Lalas, alongside pundit David Mosse, hosts the podcast &quot;State of the Union&quot;, dedicated to discussing American soccer.

== Personal life ==

Lalas speaks Spanish and Italian in addition to his native English and Greek. Lalas is married and has two children.

Lalas is a Republican and endorsed Ron DeSantis in the 2024 United States presidential election.

Lalas is a major fan of the hair metal band Ratt.

==Musical career==
Lalas has released eight solo albums over the past three decades: &quot;Far from Close&quot; (1996), &quot;Ginger&quot; (1998), &quot;So It Goes&quot; (2010), &quot;Infinity Spaces&quot; (2014), &quot;Shots&quot; (2016), &quot;Sunshine&quot; (2018), &quot;Look at You&quot; (2019) and &quot;Melt Away&quot; (2022). With a noted affinity for rock music since college, Lalas played in a band named The Gypsies, opening for Hootie &amp; The Blowfish during a European tour in 1998. The Gypsies were featured in a self-produced, self-distributed album &quot;Woodland&quot;, released by Lalas during the 1994 World Cup.

<text>Broughton Gifford is a village and civil parish about west of Melksham in Wiltshire, England. The parish includes the hamlets of Norrington Common and The Common.

==History==
Formerly much of Broughton Gifford and the surrounding area was covered with woodland. Much of this was felled during the First and Second World Wars. Villagers long used the common to graze their livestock and grow their crops. Although the common was not included when the rest of the parish&#x27;s lands were inclosed in 1783, eventually its agricultural uses died out.

==Railway==
The Wessex Main Line railway was opened across the south-east of the parish in 1848, following the Avon valley. In October 1905 a small station, , was opened for the newly introduced steam railcar service between Chippenham and Trowbridge. The halt was south-east of the village at the Mill Lane bridge, near the road between Melksham and Bradford-on-Avon; it was closed on 7 February 1955 but the line remains open.

==Geography==
The village has two parts. The lower village has the church, the school and the village hall. There are also two housing estates and some detached houses in this part.

The higher part, The Common, is a large area of open land with houses around it. As at 2008 there were three ponds on the common, inhabited by a paddling of ducks in their breeding season. At one end of the common is the Bell public house, and the football pitch and bowling green.

The River Avon forms a natural boundary to the south and east of the parish.

==Local government==
The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for most significant local government functions.

Unusually, the parish shares some land in common with the parish of Melksham Without.

== Religious sites ==
=== Parish church ===
The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin, at the south end of the village, is from the 13th century and is a Grade I listed building. Additions in the 14th century included the south chapel, and the tower was added in the 15th. The rectory was built in 1848 to designs of T.H. Wyatt, and the church was lightly restored by G.G. Scott in 1878.

St Mary&#x27;s is part of the united benefice of St Katherine&#x27;s at Holt, together with All Saints at Great Chalfield.

=== Chapels ===
A Particular Baptist chapel was built in 1806 on the east side of the common, and is still in use.

A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in 1828 and replaced by a larger building in 1907. The chapel closed c. 2008 and is now a private home.

==Notable buildings==

Three houses are Grade II* listed:
* Gifford Hall, c.1700, The Common
* Manor House, early 17th century, on the road to The Common
* Monkton House, 1647, south of the village, by the Avon

In March 2015 Mr Daniel Gerber, of Gifford Hall, obtained a decision in the High Court quashing a planning permission granted by Wiltshire Council for a £10.5 million solar farm erected by Norrington Solar Farm Limited and Terraform Power. 
This decision was then overturned, allowing the solar farm to remain, some distance to the north of Gifford Hall.

A packhorse bridge dating from 1725 spans the River Avon to the south of Broughton Gifford, providing a route (now a public footpath) to the hamlet of Whaddon.

==Amenities==
The village has a primary school, St Mary&#x27;s, a short distance north of the church. Its first building dates from 1856, when it became a National School following the rebuilding of an earlier charity school. The school became Voluntary controlled in 1952 and was remodelled and extended in 1975.

Broughton has two public houses: the Fox and Hounds in the centre of the village, which reopened after refurbishment in October 2022 after being closed for many years, and the Bell On The Common, on the edge of the open area known as the Common. There is also a bowls club which was established in 1961, and a village hall.

==Sculptures==
Broughton Gifford is home to a war memorial in the form of an obelisk.

<text>James Rendel Harris (27 January 1852 in Plymouth, Devon – 1 March 1941) was an English biblical scholar and curator of manuscripts, who was instrumental in bringing back to light many Syriac Scriptures and other early documents. His contacts at the Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt enabled twin sisters Agnes Smith Lewis and Margaret Dunlop Gibson to discover there the Sinaitic Palimpsest, the oldest Syriac New Testament document in existence. He subsequently accompanied them on a second trip, with Robert Bensly and Francis Crawford Burkitt, to decipher the palimpsest. He himself discovered there other manuscripts (073, 0118, 0119, 0137, a Syriac text of the Apology of Aristides etc.,). Harris&#x27;s &quot;Biblical Fragments from Mount Sinai&quot; appeared in 1890. He was a Quaker.

==Life==
Harris was born to a Congregationalist family and grew up as one of eleven children. His father, Henry Marmaduke Harris, was a house decorator. His mother, Elizabeth Corker Harris, ran a shop selling baby clothes. His paternal aunt, Augusta Harris, was the mother of the poet Henry Austin Dobson.

Educated at Plymouth Grammar School and Clare College, Cambridge, he was third Wrangler in the mathematical Tripos of 1874. He was a fellow of Clare College from 1875 to 1878, in 1892, and from 1902 to 1904. In 1880, he married a Quaker from Plymouth, Helen Balkwill, and under her influence and that of the Evangelical Revival of the 1870s, in 1885 he became a member of the Society of Friends. He moved to the United States in 1882 following his wife who was at the time engaged in missionary work, and was appointed professor of New Testament Greek at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, US (1882–85). Harris resigned his post in response to criticism that his attack on the vivisection practiced in the Johns Hopkins laboratories had elicited from his colleagues (Harris was a staunch vegetarian). The couple returned to Britain for a short while, as Harris was soon appointed professor in Biblical Studies at Haverford College, near Philadelphia (1886–91).

In 1888–1889, while on leave from Haverford, he travelled to Palestine and Egypt, purchasing 47 rolls and codices written in Hebrew, Latin, Arabic, Syriac, Armenian and Ethiopic. He said that these texts, which discussed biblical and linguistic topics and some of which were as old as the 13th century, were &quot;all acquired by the lawful, though sometimes tedious, processes of Oriental commerce.&quot; During this journey, he also discovered the Syriac version of the Apology of Aristides in the Monastery of Saint Catherine. Upon his return, he donated the manuscripts he had collected to Haverford. They are held by the college library&#x27;s Quaker Collection.

In 1903 he was appointed the first director of studies at the Society of Friends&#x27; new college at Woodbrooke near Birmingham. In accepting the post, he turned down an appointment as a professor of theology at Leiden University. However, students from Leiden attended his courses at Woodbrooke. The university later awarded him a doctorate.

Harris represented two prestigious libraries during his lifetime: Johns Hopkins and John Rylands Library, Manchester, where he became the curator of manuscripts. Most of his publications dealt with biblical and patristic history; he was an extremely prolific writer. He examined the Latin text of the Codex Sangallensis 48.

Included among the topics on which he wrote are: the &quot;Apology of Aristides&quot; (1891), the &quot;Didache&quot;, Philo, the &quot;Diatessaron&quot;, the Christian Apologists, &quot;Acts of Perpetua&quot;, &quot;The Odes and Psalms of Solomon&quot; (1909), the &quot;Gospel of Peter&quot;, and other Western and Syriac texts, and numerous works on biblical manuscripts.

In 1933, a &quot;Festschrift&quot; was published in his honor, called &quot;Amicitiae Corolla: a volume of essays presented to James Rendel Harris on the occasion of his 80th birthday&quot;.

A new biography of Harris was published in 2018.

<doc id="893246" wikidata="Q522895" url="?curid=893246" title="André Stander">
<text>André Charles Stander (22 November 1946 – 13 February 1984) was a South African criminal and policeman. One of the most infamous bank robbers in South Africa&#x27;s history, Stander was notorious for the audacious manner with which he carried out his crimes; he sometimes carried out the crime on his lunch break, often returning to the scene as an investigating officer.

Stander was portrayed by American actor Thomas Jane in the 2003 film &quot;Stander&quot;.

== Police career ==
The son of a prominent figure in the South African Prison Service, Major General Francois Jacobus Stander (1916–2001), André was under pressure from an early age to pursue a career in law enforcement. He enrolled at the South African Police training college near Pretoria in 1963, graduating at the top of his class. Shortly afterwards he joined the Kempton Park criminal investigation department.

== Criminal activities ==

=== Robberies ===

In 1977, Stander flew to Durban and robbed his first bank. Between 1977 and 1980, he is believed to have stolen nearly a hundred thousand rand.

After robbing nearly 20 banks, Stander was arrested and sentenced to 75 years in prison on 6 May 1980. However, since many of the charges in the sentence ran concurrently, he faced an actual sentence of 17 years. Stander met Allan Heyl and Lee McCall at the Zonderwater maximum security prison.

=== Motivation ===
After his first trial, Stander claimed that his disillusionment with police service stemmed from a prior incident when he and his fellow officers shot and killed 176 unarmed schoolchildren during the 1976 Soweto uprising. However, Stander was not present with the police contingent at Thembisa when the shooting of unarmed schoolchildren took place.

Other accounts have suggested that Stander, who completed his national service in Angola during the South African Border War, may have also been bored with civilian life and craved the excitement afforded by a life of crime.

=== Stander Gang ===
On 11 August 1983, Stander and McCall, along with five other inmates, were taken from the prison&#x27;s premises for a physiotherapy appointment. Once the prisoners were left alone with the physiotherapist, Stander and McCall overpowered her and escaped. The other prisoners refused to participate and stayed behind.

Stander and McCall returned to Zonderwater on 31 October 1983, in order to spring Allan Heyl from the facility where he was taking a trade test. From that day until the end of January 1984, the three began robbing banks together, under the nom de guerre of the Stander Gang – a term coined by the news media.

McCall was killed on 30 January 1984, in a police raid on the gang&#x27;s hide-out in Houghton Estate. Heyl fled to Greece, then England, then Spain, and eventually back to England, where he was caught, tried, and sentenced to nine years in prison for robbery and a related firearms charge. After serving his time in the UK, he was extradited back to South Africa where he was sentenced to a further 33 years in prison. Heyl was released on parole on 18 May 2005.

While police were closing in on McCall in South Africa, Stander had been in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, trying to arrange for the sale of the gang&#x27;s recently purchased sailing yacht—the &quot;Lilly Rose&quot;—that they planned to use for their final getaway once they had acquired enough money.

== Florida and death ==

While Stander remained in the United States, international arrest warrants and all points bulletins were issued for his arrest. Trying to make the best of the situation, Stander created the false identity of an Australian author named &quot;Peter Harris&quot; and forged a driver&#x27;s license. Afterwards, he visited a used car lot and purchased a 1973 Ford Mustang from a dealer named Anthony Tomasello. On 10 February 1984, police pulled Stander over while he was driving and arrested him for driving an unregistered vehicle. Being relatively unknown to the American authorities at that time, Stander presented his false ID to the police, who recognized it as a forgery and subsequently seized it—adding driver&#x27;s license forgery to his list of offenses—but believed his story about his identity and released him.

Once released on the same evening, Stander returned to the police impound lot where his seized Mustang was being kept, broke in and stole the car. On the following morning, Stander returned to the same used car lot where he had purchased the vehicle and asked the same dealer, Tomasello, to have the car re-painted in a different colour. However, Tomasello had just read about the Stander Gang in a local newspaper. He told Stander that he would help him, got his information, and as soon as Stander had left, Tomasello called his lawyer. On his lawyer&#x27;s advice, Tomasello called the local police.

Based on Tomasello&#x27;s information, a police tactical unit surrounded the apartment that Stander had been using as a hideout, but Stander was not there. He had acquired a bicycle to use while his car was with Tomasello to be repainted. He had left the apartment on the bicycle and returned only after the police had surrounded it. As he unknowingly rode up to the apartment complex, officer Michael van Stetina—who had been posted on the perimeter—recognised Stander and attempted to stop him.

Stander tried to get away, but as Stetina prevented his escape a struggle for the officer&#x27;s shotgun began. The gun discharged and blew a hole on the wall of a house. Stander was not hit; he ran while carrying the shotgun and stopped in the driveway of the neighboring house and was shot by police when he pointed the shotgun at them. He fell onto the driveway, bleeding profusely. Stetina immediately radioed for an ambulance. Although officer Stetina tried to administer first aid, Stander&#x27;s wounds were too extensive and he bled to death before an ambulance arrived.

<text>The Hood Canal Bridge (officially William A. Bugge Bridge) is a floating bridge in the northwest United States, located in western Washington. It carries State Route 104 across Hood Canal in Puget Sound and connects the Olympic and Kitsap Peninsulas. At in length (floating portion ), it is the longest floating bridge in the world located in a saltwater tidal basin, and the third longest floating bridge overall. It opened in 1961 and was the second concrete floating bridge constructed in Washington. Since that time, it has become a vital link for local residents, freight haulers, commuters, and recreational travelers. The convenience it provides has had a major impact on economic development, especially in eastern Jefferson County.

The bridge is officially named after William A. Bugge (1900–1992), the director of the Department of Highways from 1949 to 1963, who was a leader in the planning and construction of the bridge.

==History==
===Design, fabrication, and construction===

The design and planning process for the Hood Canal Bridge took nearly a decade amid criticism from some engineers throughout that time. Critics questioned the use of floating pontoons over salt water, especially at a location with high tide fluctuations and the concern that the funneling effect of the Hood Canal might magnify the intensity of winds and tides. The depth of the water, however, made construction of support columns for other bridge types prohibitively expensive. The water depth below the pontoons ranges from . In its marine environment, the bridge is exposed to tidal swings of .

The pontoons for the bridge were fabricated in the Duwamish Waterway in Seattle; during fabrication, two of the pontoons sank. When they were attached for the first time, and then towed into place and anchored, sea conditions in the Hood Canal were too severe and the pontoons were returned to a nearby bay until a better method of attaching could be devised. The structural engineers and the contractor decided the design was faulty. A new contractor was hired and the design modified. It was decided to use a large rubber dam between each of the two pontoons as they were attached, clean the concrete surfaces of all marine growth, epoxy, and tension them with a number of cables welded to a variety of attachment points. This system seemed to work from when the bridge opened in 1961 until the disaster of 1979.

The eastern approach span weighs more than 3,800 tons (3,400 tonnes) and the western approach span weighs more than 1,000 tons (907 tonnes)

In 1977, the bridge was officially named the William A. Bugge Hood Canal Bridge after the former Washington Director of Highways.

===1979 sinking and reconstruction===


The Hood Canal Bridge suffered catastrophic failure in 1979 during the February 13 windstorm. During the night, the bridge had withstood sustained winds of up to and gusts estimated at , and finally succumbed at about 7:30 a.m. on February 13. The western drawspan and the pontoons of the western half had broken loose and sunk, despite the drawspan being opened to relieve lateral pressure. At the time of the failure, the bridge had been closed to highway traffic and the tower crew had evacuated; no casualties resulted. Evidence points to blown-open hatches allowing flooding of the pontoons as the cause of the sinking.

Efforts to repair the bridge began immediately and Washington Secretary of Transportation William A. Bulley secured a commitment of federal emergency relief money for the project. On June 15, 1979, actual work began with the removal of the west truss and transport for storage. The state&#x27;s department of transportation attempted to mitigate the impact of the disaster by redirecting traffic to U.S. Route 101 to drive around the length of Hood Canal and by reestablishing the state ferry run between Lofall and South Point across the canal just south of the bridge. This route had been discontinued after the 1961 bridge opening and the state needed to reacquire access to and restore operational conditions on both landings. During the course of the closure an additional ferry route was temporarily added between Edmonds and Port Townsend until February 1980, when it was replaced with additional Lofall–South Point runs.

The Hood Canal Bridge re-opened to vehicular traffic on October 24, 1982. The temporary ferries, which had carried 3,100 vehicles per day, were retired within several days. The west portion replacement had been designed and constructed in less than three years using $100 million in federal emergency bridge replacement funds at a total cost of $143 million (equivalent to $ today).

The bridge reopened as a toll bridge, but a court ruled in August 1985 that the insurance settlement constituted repayment of the construction bonds, and since federal funds were used in reconstructing the bridge, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) could not charge tolls after the bonds were retired. WSDOT was ordered to stop collecting tolls on August 29.

===Eastern span replacement===

In a project that lasted from 2003 to 2009, WSDOT replaced the east-half floating portion of the bridge, the east and west approach spans, the east and west transition spans, and the west-half electrical system. The total cost of the project, about $471 million, was paid for by state, federal and agency funds. The project required the bridge to close to traffic for five weeks to allow the old pontoons of the east-half to be cut away and the new pontoons floated into position, cabled together and connected by cables to large anchors on the sea floor. The transition spans and center draw span were also replaced during this closure. The bridge reopened June 3, 2009.

The pontoons and anchors for the bridge could not be built at the bridge site due to space and facility limitations. WSDOT evaluated different sites at which to build during a site selection process. The Port Angeles graving dock was chosen for its accessibility to water and land as well as the work force. A review performed under the provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act found no evidence of historical properties at the site, which allowed WSDOT to purchase the site and begin construction. Within the first two weeks of construction, artifacts were found from an ancestral burial ground from an ancient village called Tse-whit-zen. WSDOT stopped all work on the site, and a consultation process began among the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, WSDOT, the Federal Highway Administration, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the State Historical Preservation Office. On August 14, 2006, WSDOT agreed to donate the site to the Lower Elwha Klallam tribe, rebury all remains uncovered, and pay $2.5 million in damages. It is believed that this discovery may be documentation of the first time that non-in

On December 21, 2004, Governor Locke and Secretary MacDonald announced that WSDOT would stop pontoon and anchor construction at the Tse-whit-zen site in Port Angeles and begin searching for a more suitable place to build. Many sites were considered but the best option to be found by WSDOT was in Tacoma, where construction began on the new east-half floating pontoons in April 2006. Fourteen pontoons were built in four cycles at the site. Completed pontoons were floated out of the graving dock in Tacoma and transported to Seattle for outfitting at Todd Shipyards. Outfitting included adding all electrical and mechanical parts, connecting the pontoons into sections, and building the roadway on top of the pontoons. Another three pontoons, built during the west-half bridge replacement in the early 1980s, were retrofitted in Seattle.

==Use==

In planning for a prolonged closure of the bridge for the east-half replacement, the Washington State Department of Transportation conducted a five-day survey of bridge use in early June 1998 in order to assess closure impact and plan effective mitigation strategies. The survey was in three stages: A video camera count of traffic on weekdays (Tuesday and Wednesday) and a weekend (Friday through Sunday) to estimate average volume; the use of that video to record license plate numbers for vehicle registration addresses to assess which communities would be most affected; and the mailing of a questionnaire to the registered owners of those vehicles seeking information on trip origin, destination, and purpose, and choice of travel alternatives during a bridge closure.

The video count produced a weekday average of 14,915 trips/day and a weekend average of 18,759 trips/day. Peak volumes reach 20,000 vehicles on summer weekends. The vehicle registration information indicated that a majority of trips were by residents of communities near the bridge. The most represented communities were, in numerical order, Port Ludlow (8%), Port Townsend (7%), Port Angeles (6%), Seattle (6%), Sequim (5%), Poulsbo (5%), Bremerton (4%), Port Hadlock (2%), and Silverdale (2%).

The questionnaires revealed that a majority of trips were to and/or from communities near the bridge. On the weekend 48% of westbound trips originated on the north and central Kitsap Peninsula, with 88% of the destinations in areas near Port Ludlow, Port Townsend, Sequim, and Port Angeles. For weekday trips, nearly 55% of westbound trips originated in northern or central Kitsap County with 90% of the destinations in the Port Ludlow, Port Townsend, Sequim, and Port Angeles areas. A large number of eastbound weekday morning trips appeared to be for commuting purposes, with 92% of those trips originating in Port Ludlow, Port Townsend, Sequim, or Port Angeles, and 60% with central or northern Kitsap County as a destination, and 32% ending in the Seattle metropolitan area. The evening westbound trips seemed to mirror the morning patterns. When asked the purpose of their trips, respondents reported that for weekend trips 21% were for recreational, 21% for social, 19% for personal, 18% for work, 6% for business, and 4% for medical reasons. For weekday trips 33% were for work, 17% for personal, 14% for business, 11% for medical, 9% for social, and 8% for recreational reasons.

<doc id="893249" wikidata="Q2578579" url="?curid=893249" title="William E. Jenner">
<text>William Ezra Jenner (July 21, 1908 – March 9, 1985) was an American lawyer and politician from the state of Indiana. A Republican, Jenner was an Indiana state senator from 1934 to 1942, and a U.S. senator from 1944 to 1945 and again from 1947 to 1959. In the Senate, Jenner was a supporter of McCarthyism.

==Background==
Jenner was born in Marengo, Indiana, on July 21, 1908, to L.L. Woody and Jane McDonald Jenner.

He attended Lake Placid Preparatory School in New York before attending Indiana University Bloomington, where he graduated in 1930. Jenner worked as an elevator operator in the old House Office Building while attending night classes at the George Washington University Law School. Jenner later graduated with a law degree from Indiana University School of Law – Bloomington.

==Career==
After law, Jenner practiced law in Paoli and later in Shoals.

===Indiana Senate===
Jenner entered politics in 1934, when he was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1934. He was minority leader from 1937 to 1939, and then majority leader and president pro tempore from 1939 to 1941.

In 1940, Jenner ran for Governor of Indiana, finishing second at the Republican state convention.

In 1942, during World War II, Jenner resigned his seat to become a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army Air Corps. Jenner was discharged in 1944 at the rank of captain.

===U.S. Senate===
One month after his discharge from the Army Air Corps, Jenner was elected to the U.S. Senate seat that had been vacated by the death of Frederick Van Nuys. He served the last few months of Van Nuys&#x27;s term from November 14, 1944, to January 3, 1945; he was not a candidate for the full six-year term that began in 1945. Jenner was the first veteran of World War II elected to the Senate and the youngest member of the Senate.

He ran for the Senate in 1946 defeating Congressman Charles M. La Follette 1,994 to 105 at the Republican state convention. He then won the general election by over 150,000 votes.

He ran for governor of Indiana for a second time in 1948, winning a plurality on the first ballot at the Republican state convention. Jenner lost the nomination on the second ballot to Holbart Creighton 885 to 931.

Jenner was re-elected to the Senate in 1952. Jenner voted in favor of the Senate amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1957 on August 7, 1957, but did not vote on the House amendment to the bill on August 29, 1957.

===McCarthyism===
In Congress, Jenner was the chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration during the Eighty-Third Congress.

He was also a member of the Subcommittee on Internal Security. He was a strong supporter and friend of Joseph McCarthy and engaged in McCarthyism. Jenner and McCarthy were both part of &quot;a core of isolationist Republicans in the Senate&quot; along with Herman Welker of Idaho and George W. Malone of Nevada. In 1950, when McCarthy accused a number of State Department employees of being secret Communists (see Tydings Committee), Jenner supported him, claiming that the State Department had engaged in &quot;the most scandalous and brazen whitewash of treasonable conspiracy in our history&quot; and stating: &quot;Considering the fact that we are now at war... how can we get the Reds out of Korea if we cannot get them out of Washington?&quot; When McCarthy was censured by the Senate in 1954, Jenner gave a speech suggesting that the censure resolution &quot;was initiated by the Communist conspiracy.&quot;

In the Senate, Jenner was a strident opponent of General George Marshall, who was appointed Secretary of Defense in 1950. During the confirmation debate, Jenner and McCarthy formed part of a group of militantly anti-communist Republican Senators that attacked Marshall. Jenner &quot;delivered a shrill, hour-long attack on the nominee&quot; in which he also disparaged President Harry S. Truman and Secretary of State Dean Acheson. Using McCarthyist rhetoric, Jenner accused the Truman administration of &quot;bloody tracks of treason&quot; and called Marshall &quot;a living lie&quot; who was &quot;joining hands once more with this criminal crowd of traitors and Communist appeasers... under the direction of Mr. Truman and Mr. Acheson.&quot; Jenner also &quot;denounced and blamed Marshall for the Pearl Harbor defeat and for his role in helping FDR &#x27;trick America into a war,&#x27; the extension of lend-lease to the Communist Soviet Union, the &#x27;selling out&#x27; of Eastern Europe at Yalta, the loss of China, and the inclusion of an offer of aid to the Soviet Union under the Marshall Plan.&quot; When Marshall was informed of Jenner&#x27;s speech, the former general replied: &quot;Jenner? Jenner? I do not believe I know the man.&quot;

In 1951, after President Truman dismissed General Douglas MacArthur for insubordination, Jenner gave a speech on the floor of the Senate in which he said: &quot;I charge that this country today is in the hands of a secret inner coterie, which is directed by agents of the Soviet Government. Our only choice is to impeach President Truman and find out who is the secret invisible government.&quot;

Jenner introduced legislation that sought to strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction &quot;in all the areas where it had interfered with the anticommunist program,&quot; a measure that Senator Lyndon B. Johnson maneuvered to oppose. Ultimately, Jenner&#x27;s measure was tabled by a vote of 49–41.

A consistent opponent of American foreign aid and of any involvement in foreign affairs, he opposed U.S. participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and had other isolationist positions. During his tenure, right-wingers wanted Jenner to run for president as a far-right third-party candidate.

Jenner claimed that the United Nations had infiltrated the American educational system in 1952.

In 1958, he did not seek re-nomination.

===Later life===
After leaving the Senate, Jenner practiced law in Indianapolis and was the owner of the Seaway Corporation, a land development company. He also owned farms in Indiana and Illinois.

==Personal life and death==
In 1933, Jenner married Janet Paterson Cuthill (1908–2002) and had a son, William Edward Jenner (1942–2019).

William Ezra Jenner died age 76 on March 9, 1985, of a respiratory illness at Dunn Memorial Hospital in Bedford, Indiana.

Jenner was interred at Crest Haven Memorial Gardens in Bedford, Indiana.

<text>Francis Laurence Jobin (August 14, 1914 – August 25, 1995) was a politician and the 18th Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba, Canada.

Jobin was born in Winnipeg, and was educated at the University of Manitoba. He moved to Flin Flon, in the northern part of the province, in 1935. He worked for Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting as a labourer, miner and surveyor, later working in the company&#x27;s purchasing department.

Jobin was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1949 provincial election, as a Liberal candidate supporting the government of Premier Douglas Campbell. Running in The Pas, he easily defeated independent incumbent Beresford Richards, who opposed the governing Liberal-Conservative coalition.

Jobin was re-elected in the 1953 election, easily defeating opponents from the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and Social Credit. On July 6, 1956, he was sworn in as Railway Commissioner and Minister of Industry and Commerce in the Campbell government. Provincial CCF leader Lloyd Stinson later referred to Jobin as Campbell&#x27;s only &quot;labour-oriented&quot; minister.

Campbell&#x27;s Liberals were defeated by Dufferin Roblin&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives in the 1958 election, but Jobin was able to retain the redistributed riding of Flin Flon. He was defeated by Progressive Conservative Charles Witney in the following year&#x27;s election, however, as Roblin&#x27;s Tories won a majority government.

When Campbell resigned as Manitoba Liberal Party leader in 1961, Jobin was one of four candidates who sought to replace him. He was accused by some of representing &quot;radical&quot; elements within the party, though he denied this, using his friendship with the arch-conservative Campbell as evidence. Jobin was a somewhat marginal candidate, however, and received only 79 votes in the leadership convention, compared to 475 for the winner, Gildas Molgat.

Jobin ran as a Liberal candidate in the sprawling northern riding of Churchill in the federal election of 1962, but finished a distant second against Progressive Conservative candidate Robert Simpson. In early 1963, he lost a deferred provincial election in Churchill to Progressive Conservative Gordon Beard, albeit by a relatively close margin. Jobin again lost to Simpson in the federal election of 1965.

Jobin was elected to the Flin Flon Municipal Council in 1966. He made another bid for the provincial legislature in the 1969 election, this time finishing third against Witney and the successful New Democratic candidate, Thomas Barrow. Jobin received a Centennial Medal from the Manitoba Historical Society in 1970, and continued his work on the municipal council. In October 1974, he was elected mayor of Flin Flon.

On March 15, 1976, Jobin was sworn in as the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba. He served in this position until October 23, 1981. He died in Winnipeg on August 25, 1995.

<text>Christopher Terry Mosher, (born 11 November 1942) is a Canadian political cartoonist for the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;. He draws under the name Aislin, a rendition of the name of his eldest daughter Aislinn (without the second &#x27;n&#x27;). Aislin&#x27;s drawings have also appeared in numerous international publications, such as &quot;Punch&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;National Lampoon&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;The Washington Star&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the Canadian edition of &quot;The Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. According to his self-published website, as of 2020, he is the author of 51 books.

==Life and career==
Born in Ottawa, Ontario, Mosher attended fourteen different schools in Montreal, Toronto and Quebec City, graduating from the École des Beaux-arts in 1967. He famously won entrance to this fine arts college (now part of UQAM) by forging his high-school graduation certificate, which he called his most successful work. During his summers as a student, Mosher started drawing cartoons, &quot;portraits of American tourists&quot; on the cobbled stone streets of Quebec City. After graduating with a Bachelors of Arts degree, rather than paint, Mosher decided to continue to draw and become a political cartoonist. He has admitted that he knew little about his chosen trade, and the lack of historical books about Canadian political cartooning made the transition a challenge. However, he adapted quickly, and in 1969, he was appointed official cartoonist of The Montreal Star, one of two Montreal English-language newspapers. He moved to the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; in 1972.

Mosher began his career during a period of political change in Canadian and Quebec history. In 1967, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson stepped down as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, and Pierre Elliott Trudeau assumed its leadership, becoming the 15th Prime Minister of Canada. In the fall of 1970, Montreal found itself in the middle of what is known as the October Crisis, in which the pro-sovereigntist group Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) kidnapped and killed Pierre Laporte, a senior Quebec cabinet minister. The Federal Government, led by Pierre Trudeau, invoked the War Measures Act, thereby suspending civil rights and liberties. In 1976, the Parti Québécois, a sovereigntist party, was elected for the first time in Quebec history. These events gave Mosher &quot;a phenomenal, sort of varied experience, to be drawing material on all of these different matters&quot;.

Mosher published his first ever cartoon in September 1967, a drawing of Charles de Gaulle in the &quot;Saturday Night&quot; magazine. His first cartoon published in a newspaper (&quot;The Montreal Star&quot;) was on 10 December 1967. It was about a police raid of an African entertainment group that had been rumoured to have gone topless. Since December 1967, he has published over 13,000 editorial cartoons.

A cartoon that Mosher himself describes as &quot;probably the best remembered of any cartoon I’ve drawn&quot; is one depicting the newly elected Premier of Quebec, René Lévesque, holding his customary cigarette, saying, “ O.K. Everybody Take a Valium!” reflecting the Anglophone community&#x27;s angst towards their future in the province. The cartoon was drawn on the night when the pro-sovereigntist Parti Québecois won the 1976 election.

Mosher&#x27;s cartoons have evolved over time and, with the evolution of the internet, he has been concentrating on the appearance of drawings in the virtual format rather than print: &quot;I draw cartoons now, not how it will look in the newspaper, but how it will look on the screen&quot;.

Mosher has partnerships not only with newspapers but with a board game and bookstore as well. Mosher famously turned down shares in the board game Trivial Pursuit for which he provided the original artwork. The co-inventor, Chris Haney, gave Mosher a choice: $1,000 or shares. Mosher took the cash. He also provided a cartoon for the logo of a Montreal bookstore, Paragraphe Bookstore.

Mosher and fellow Montreal cartoonist Serge Chapleau were the subject of a 2003 documentary film, &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot;, directed by Garry Beitel.

== Exhibitions ==
In 1997, Mosher&#x27;s work was presented in the McCord Museum of Montreal alongside fellow cartoonist Serge Chapleau&#x27;s work.&quot;The Cartoon Calamities!&quot; a 2012 exhibition covering 150 years of current events through the drawings of Quebec cartoonists including Aislin.

In 2017, the McCord Museum presented another exhibition, &quot;Aislin: 50 Years of Cartoons&quot;, celebrating 50 of Mosher&#x27;s best political cartoons spanning 50 years from 1967 to 2017. The exhibition was not only a showcase of his work, but also an introduction to Montreal, Quebec, and Canadian political history. The exhibition was divided into five main themes: A Changing Society, which showcased a Leonard Cohen cartoon; Quebec and Canadian Politics, which concentrated on political events such as the election of the Parti Québecois, and the Quebec referendums on sovereignty; Montreal Mayors, focusing on Jean Drapeau and 1976 Montreal Olympics; First Ministers, detailing political leaders such as Pierre Trudeau, Réné Levesque, Brian Mulroney and Justin Trudeau; and finally, Montreal Life, showcasing cartoons reflecting Montreal&#x27;s joie de vivre.

In late 2017, Mosher had another exhibition at the Ottawa City Hall Art Gallery where his cartoons were presented. The exhibition was titled &quot;Terry Mosher- From Trudeau to Trudeau: Fifty Years of Aislin Cartoons&quot;.

== Personal life and philanthropy ==
Mosher has two daughters, Aislinn and Jessica, who are both McGill University graduates.

Mosher&#x27;s love for baseball led him to be part of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America.

Mosher has had a long association with the Old Brewery Mission, Montreal&#x27;s largest shelter for the homeless, and in 2001, was appointed to the institution&#x27;s board of directors.

== Honours and awards ==
Mosher is the recipient of two National Newspaper Awards and five individual prizes from the international Salon of Caricature. He was awarded President Emeritus by the Association of Canadian Cartoonists. In 1985, Mosher became the youngest person ever to be inducted into the Canadian News Hall of Fame. In 2002, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2007, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters from McGill University. In 2012, he was inducted into the Canadian Cartoonist&#x27;s Hall of Fame (aka The Giants of the North) in a ceremony in Toronto as part of the 8th Annual Doug Wright Awards for Canadian Cartooning. He received the Canadian Version of the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002. and the Canadian Version of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012.

In June 2018, Mosher was awarded an honorary doctorate from Concordia University.

==Controversy==
In 1993, MP Robert Layton denounced Aislan&#x27;s cartoon depicting outgoing Prime Minister Brian Mulroney lying face down in the snow after having been tripped by a whistling Pierre Trudeau as &quot;a crime against fundamental Canadian values of decency and mutual respect&quot;, making him the first political cartoonist censured in the House of Commons.

On 12 March 2010, Mosher drew a cartoon depicting a woman in a niqab with prison bars and a lock in place of her eyes. The cartoon was drawn in reference to a Montreal Muslim woman who refused to remove her niqab upon entering a French-language school and was asked to leave. Salem Elmenyawi, the president of the Muslim Council of Montreal, pointed out that he had made similar cartoons about women wearing a hijab. Elmenyawi explained that the cartoon creates an inaccurate depiction of women who wear niqabs by &quot;not respecting the fact they tried to be true to the faith the way they understood it and the way they think it&#x27;s right.&quot; Mosher defended his cartoon indicating that it is necessary to have more than just one view represented.

On 8 April 2020, Mosher posted a cartoon of Donald Trump with a swastika as his coat of arms. As a result of the extreme backlash towards the cartoon, the Montreal Gazette published a modified version of the cartoon without the swastika included in the emblem.
