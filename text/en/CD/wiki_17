<text>Magic words are phrases used in fantasy fiction or by stage magicians. Frequently such words are presented as being part of a divine, adamic, or other secret or empowered language. Certain comic book heroes use magic words to activate their powers. Magic words are also used as &quot;Easter eggs&quot; or cheats in computer games, other software, and operating systems. (For example, the words &quot;xyzzy&quot;, &quot;plugh&quot;, and &quot;plover&quot; were magic words in the classic computer adventure game &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;.)

<doc id="878239" wikidata="Q242415" url="?curid=878239" title="Corner kick">
<text>A corner kick, commonly known as a corner, is the method of restarting play in a game of association football when the ball goes out of play over the goal line, without a goal being scored and having last been touched by a member of the defending team. The kick is taken from the corner of the field of play nearest to the place where the ball crossed the goal line.

Corners are considered to be a reasonable goal-scoring opportunity for the attacking side, though not as much as a penalty kick or a direct free kick near the edge of the penalty area.

A corner kick that scores without being touched by another player is called an &quot;Olimpico goal&quot;, or less commonly, &quot;Olympic goal&quot;.

==Award==
A corner kick is awarded when the ball wholly crosses the goal line outside of the goal frame having been last touched by a member of the team defending that end of the pitch. For the purposes of this rule, it does not matter if this touch is deliberate; it is permissible to kick the ball at an opponent to win a corner kick.

A corner kick is also awarded instead of an own goal when the ball enters a team&#x27;s goal, having been last touched by a member of the defending team, in the following rare situations:
* directly from a kick-off, free kick (whether direct or indirect), throw-in, goal kick, or corner kick.
* from a dropped ball, if the ball has not been touched by at least two players.

The corner kick is taken from whichever corner was closer to the point where the ball went out of play.

==Procedure==

* The assistant referee will signal that a corner should be awarded by first raising his flag, then using it to point at the corner area on their side of the pitch; however, this is not an indication of which side the kick should be taken from. The referee signals the corner by pointing, with an upward extension of the arm, to the corner area from which the kick is to be taken.
* The ball must be stationary and on the ground within the &quot;corner area&quot; formed by a quarter circle with a radius of one yard (1 metre) from the corner flagpost inside the field of play.
* All opposing players must be at least 10 yards (9.15 metres) from the corner area until the ball is in play. Marks may optionally be made on the goal line and touchline at a distance of 10 yards from the corner area to assist the referee in enforcing this provision.
* The ball is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves; it does not need to leave the corner area.
* The player taking the corner kick may not touch the ball a second time before it has touched another player.
* The attacking side may score directly from a corner kick, though this is uncommon. An own goal may not be scored directly: in the extremely unlikely event of the ball going directly into the attacking team&#x27;s own goal from a corner kick, a corner kick would be awarded to the opposing side.
* An attacking player who directly receives the ball from a corner kick cannot be penalised for offside.

===Infringements===

If the kick is taken with a moving ball, or from the wrong place, the corner kick is retaken.

Opposing players must retire the required distance as stated above. Failure to do so promptly may constitute misconduct and be punished by a yellow card.

A player who excessively delays the restart of play is cautioned.

It is an offence for the kicker to touch the ball a second time before it has been touched by another player; this is punishable by an indirect free kick to the defending team from where the offence occurred, unless the second touch was also a more serious handling offence, in which case a direct free kick is awarded to the defending team.

===Tactics in taking and defending a corner===
A common tactic is for several attackers to stand close in front of the goal, whereupon the corner taker crosses the ball for them to head into the goal.

The defending team may choose to form a wall of players in an attempt to force the ball to be played to an area which is more easily defended. However, this is not done often because defending players must remain at least 10 yards from the ball until it is in play.

The defending team also has the choice of whether to instruct a player to adopt a position beside one or both of the goalposts to provide protection to the goal in addition to the goalkeeper. The thinking behind placing a player beside a goalpost is that it means more of the goal area is protected and there is no loss in the ability to play an offside trap because offside does not apply for the first touch from a corner, and it compensates for a keeper&#x27;s positioning and/or reach.

The defending team also has to decide how many players it needs to defend a corner. Teams may withdraw every player into a defensive area, however this diminishes the potential for a counter-attack if possession is regained, and as such, allows the attacking side to commit more players to attacking the goal. Withdrawing all players into a defensive area also means that if the ball is cleared from an initial cross, it is more than likely that the attacking team will regain possession of the ball and begin a new attack.

In situations where a set-piece, such as a corner, is awarded to a side trailing by a single goal at the closing stages of a match where conceding further is of minimal consequence (i.e. in a knockout tournament) a team may commit all their players, including their goalkeeper, to the attack.

====Man versus zonal marking====
Two popular strategies used for defending corners are called man marking and zonal marking. Man marking involves each defensive player at a corner being given an attacking player to defend, with their objective being to stop the attacking player from heading the ball. The other tactic, zonal marking, involves allocating each player to an area of the box to defend (their &quot;zone&quot;). The objective for players in zonal marking is to get to the ball first if it enters their zone and head it away from danger before an attacking player can reach it.

====Alternate tactics====
Rather than the kicker attempting a cross, an alternative strategy for the attacking team is the &quot;short corner&quot;. The ball is passed to a player close the kicker, to create a better angle of approach toward the goal.

Teams attempting to time-waste may keep the ball in the corner of the pitch for as long as possible rather than attempt an attack.

==Scoring a goal directly from a corner: &quot;Olimpico goal&quot;==
It is possible to score with a corner kick if sufficient swerve is given to the kick and/or if wind is blowing toward the goal. The goalkeeper is usually considered at fault if a goal is scored from a corner.

This type of goal is called an &quot;Olympic goal&quot; or &quot;Olimpico goal.&quot; On 14 June 1924, the IFAB formally legalized scoring in this manner; the first such goal was scored on 2 October 1924 by Argentina&#x27;s Cesáreo Onzari against Uruguay, who had just won the 1924 Olympic title.

For decades, English speakers generally used the term &quot;Olympic goal.&quot; But the 21st century has seen the rise in the use of &quot;Olimpico goal&quot;, derived from the Spanish and Portuguese term &quot;gol olímpico&quot; widely used in Latin America. Max Bretos has used it on Fox Soccer Channel in the United States, reflecting Latino influence on the sport&#x27;s culture there. Virtually all reports of Megan Rapinoe&#x27;s goal in the bronze medal match at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics referred to it as an &quot;Olimpico goal&quot;.

Notable examples
* Although FIFA states the first goal from a corner was scored by Billy Alston in Scotland on 21 August 1924, in fact, Alston&#x27;s goal was from a header two days later on 23 August 1924, when Alston scored for St Bernard&#x27;s F.C. in a Scottish Second Division match against Albion Rovers F.C.. 
* The first recorded Olimpico goal in England was by Huddersfield Town&#x27;s Billy Smith on 11 October 1924.
* Portuguese footballer João Morais scored directly from a corner for Sporting Clube de Portugal in the 1964 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final, eventually deciding the match and the destiny of the trophy.
*Steve Staunton scored two Olimpico goals for the Republic of Ireland: the first against Portugal in the 1992 U.S. Cup (7 June 1992), and the second against Northern Ireland in the 1994 World Cup qualifiers on 31 March 1993.
* Megan Rapinoe from the United States scored the first Olimpico goal at the Olympic Games in the 2012 women&#x27;s semi-final match against Canada, as well as in the 2020 bronze medal match against Australia.
* The first Olimpico goal in the men&#x27;s World Cup was achieved at the 1962 FIFA World Cup in the group stage match between Colombia and the Soviet Union by Marcos Coll, beating Lev Yashin, widely considered the best goalkeeper of all time., although new investigations seem to indicate that it was in the 1938 World Cup in a three-goal draw and was scored by Jose Magriña.
* In January 2012, Paul Owens took advantage of strong winds to score two goals direct from corners in the second half of Coleraine&#x27;s 3–1 win over Glenavon at the Irish Premiership.
* In Vietnam&#x27;s 7–0 demolition of Malaysia at the 2015 AFF Women&#x27;s Championship on home soil, Nguyễn Thị Tuyết Dung scored two goals from direct corners. They were scored on either side, with either foot. She also scored another direct corner goal against regional rivals Myanmar at the 2022 AFC Women&#x27;s Asian Cup.
* At the 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, Elise Kellond-Knight scored directly from a corner in the 83rd minute for Australia to bring the score to 1–1 against Norway. Norway went on to win the match on penalties.
* Melbourne Victory won the 2021 W-League grand final after Kyra Cooney-Cross scored directly from a corner in the 120th minute.
* Mohsin Al-Khaldi scored directly from a corner to put Oman in the lead against Vietnam in the third round of qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. He could have scored one more against China, if not for Amjad Al-Harthi&#x27;s slight touch on the ball before it went into the net.
* Manchester United women midfielder Katie Zelem scored two Olimpico goals in a 4–0 win against Leicester City on 6 March 2022 in the FA Women&#x27;s Super League.
* Douglas Luiz scored directly from a corner in Aston Villa&#x27;s 2–1 defeat to Arsenal in the Premier League on 31 August 2022.

==Corner instead of own goal from restart==
Most methods of restarting the game do not permit the scoring of an own goal directly from the restart; if the ball enters the goal directly, a corner is awarded instead. This is the case for the kick-off, goal kick, dropped ball, throw-in, corner kick, and free kick (direct or indirect). Such incidents are extremely rare, and in some cases require unusual or extraordinary circumstances in order to occur (for example, a ball from a corner kick would have to travel the entire length of the field and enter the kicker&#x27;s own goal without being touched by any other player).

In a 1983–84 English Third Division match, Millwall were incorrectly credited with a goal against Wimbledon rather than a corner, when Wally Downes&#x27; free-kick backpass eluded an off-guard Dave Beasant. In a 2002–03 FA Premier League match, Birmingham City scored against their local rivals Aston Villa when Olof Mellberg&#x27;s throw-in backpass was missed by Villa goalkeeper Peter Enckelman, who reacted with dismay but later claimed he had made no contact and the goal should not have been awarded. His reaction may have persuaded referee David Elleray that Enckelman had grazed the ball; manager Graham Taylor suggested it showed he was unaware of the corner rule, a charge Enckelman denied.

==History==

===Background===
Under the original 1863 rules of the Football Association, a ball kicked behind the goal-line was treated similarly to present-day rugby: if an attacking player touched the ball down first, the attacking team was awarded a free-kick at goal (similar to a conversion in rugby), while if a defending player touched the ball down first, the defending team was awarded a goal-kick. These rules were subsequently simplified, so that by 1867 a goal-kick was awarded in all circumstances, regardless of which team touched the ball.

During this period, clubs around Sheffield played their own distinctive code of football. The laws promulgated in early March 1867 by the newly formed Sheffield Football Association contained a similar rule: a goal-kick was awarded whenever the ball went behind the goal-line, regardless of which team touched the ball.
One problem with these early rules was mentioned at the 1867 FA meeting: 

===Introduction in Sheffield rules===
An early law providing for a &quot;throw-in&quot; from the corner flag had already been used by the Sheffield Mechanics&#x27; Football Club for the 1865–66 season:

The corner-kick itself was suggested in a letter to the editor of the &quot;Sheffield Daily Telegraph&quot; published on 22 March 1867. The author, writing under the pseudonym &quot;Rouge&quot;, argued that the then-current rule was &quot;a great inducement to foul and dishonourable play, for it is manifestly to the advantage of a defending side to allow the ball to pass their goal line, they having the great advantage or a free kick-off&quot;. Instead, Rouge suggested, &quot;when the ball is kicked behind the goal-line, the players [should] run for touch, and the side winning the touch, kicks in from the nearest corner-flag&quot;.

The corner-kick was introduced to Sheffield football the following year, as the result of a rule-change proposed by Norfolk F.C. The law, adopted in October 1868, ran: 
This Sheffield form of the corner-kick had two significant differences from today&#x27;s version:
* The corner-kick could be awarded to either the attacking or the defending team, depending on which team kicked the ball behind the goal-line.
* When the ball was kicked &quot;directly over the crossbar&quot;, by either team, a goal-kick was awarded to the defending team.
The Sheffield clubs would retain this form of the corner-kick rule until they adopted the FA&#x27;s rules wholesale in 1877.

===Introduction in association football===
In 1872, the Sheffield Association successfully introduced the corner-kick into the Football Association&#x27;s code. The new FA rule was identical to the Sheffield rule, as described above.

===1873 changes===
The next year, 1873, the FA rule was rewritten, under a proposal by Great Marlow FC, to essentially its current form:
* When the attacking team kicked the ball behind the goal-line, a goal-kick was awarded to the defending team
* When the defending team kicked the ball behind the goal-line, a corner-kick was awarded to the attacking team.
The FA rule of 1873 stated: 

===Subsequent developments===

====Name====
The name &quot;corner-kick&quot; first appears in the laws of 1883. Before this, the phrase &quot;corner-flag kick&quot; was used (1875).
====Position of the kick====
In 1874, the kick was allowed to be taken from within one yard of the corner-flag, rather than from the flag itself.

====Position of other players====
Initially, all other players were forbidden to be within six yards of the ball at a corner-kick; this was altered to all &quot;opposing&quot; players in 1888. In 1913 and 1914, the distance was increased from six yards to ten yards. In 2006, the minimum distance was specified as ten yards &quot;from the corner area&quot;, rather than from the ball.

====Putting the ball into play====
In 1905, it was specified that the ball &quot;must make a complete circuit or travel the distance of its circumference&quot; before being in play. In 1997, this requirement was eliminated: the ball became in play as soon as it was kicked and moved. In 2016, it was specified that the ball must &quot;clearly&quot; move.

====Offside from a corner-kick====
When first introduced in 1872, the corner-kick was required to be taken from the corner-flag itself, which made it impossible for an attacking player to be in an offside position directly from a corner. In 1874, the kick was allowed to be taken up to one yard from the corner-flag, thus opening up the possibility of a player being in an offside position by being ahead of the ball. At the International Football Conference of December 1882, it was agreed that a player should not be offside from a corner-kick; this change was incorporated into the Laws of the Game in 1883.

====Scoring a goal from a corner-kick====

When it was first introduced in 1872, there was no restriction on scoring a goal directly from a corner-kick. In 1875, this was forbidden, but it was subsequently legalised by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) meeting of 14 June 1924 with effect from for the following season, and is now referred to as an &quot;Olimpico goal&quot;. In 1997, the laws were amended to remove the possibility of scoring an own goal directly from a corner kick.

====Touching the ball twice from a corner-kick====

When initially introduced in 1872, there was no restriction on dribbling from a corner-kick. In 1875, this was changed: it was forbidden for a player to touch the ball again after taking a corner-kick, before the ball had been touched by another player.

In 1924, this restriction was accidentally removed, as an unintended consequence of the law-change allowing a goal to be scored directly from a corner. This possibility was exploited by Everton winger Sam Chedgzoy in a match against Arsenal on 15 November of that year. At the end of November, the International Football Association Board issued emergency instructions that dribbling was once again forbidden. The law was formally amended to prohibit dribbling at the next annual meeting of the Board, in 1925.

====Punishment for infringement====
In 1882, an indirect free-kick was awarded when the player taking the corner-kick touched the ball again before it had touched another player.

In 1905, an indirect free-kick was awarded for any infringement at a corner-kick.

These penalties were accidentally removed from the laws in 1924, as described above. In 1930, both penalties were reinstated. In 1973, the remedy for infringements other than the double touch was changed to a retake.

====Pitch markings====

The one-yard quarter-circle pitch marking is first explicitly mentioned in the Laws of the Game in 1938, but appears in the diagram of the pitch as early as 1902. In 1995, the Laws of the Game were updated to explicitly allow optional marks on the goal line 11 yards from the corner flag, at right angles to the goal-line, to aid the referee in enforcing the minimum distance from the corner kick. In 2008, similar optional marks were permitted at right angles to the touch lines. (In 1977, the Scottish FA had proposed an additional pitch-marking of a quarter-circle with a radius of 11 yards for this purpose, but the suggestion was rejected).

====Use as a tiebreaker====
In the early 1920s, some charity matches began using corner-kicks as a tie-breaker in order to avoid replays. In response, the laws of the game were amended in 1923 to state explicitly that the goal was the only means of scoring, and that a match that ended with equal number of goals scored was drawn.
Despite this, the Dublin City Cup (until the 1960s) and Dublin and Belfast Inter-City Cup (in the 1940s) used corner count as a tiebreaker in knockout rounds. The use of corner-kicks in this manner was never approved by the International Football Association Board, and in 1970 IFAB endorsed the penalty shoot-out as its approved method of breaking ties.

====Summary====
This table includes only kicks from the corner flag awarded to the attacking team after the ball goes out of play over the goal line. For kicks awarded to the defending team, see the goal kick article.

<text>The American Defense Service Medal was a military award of the United States Armed Forces, established by , by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, on June 28, 1941. The medal was intended to recognize those military service members who had served on active duty between September 8, 1939, and December 7, 1941.

A similar medal, known as the American Campaign Medal, was established in 1942, for service in the American Theater during the World War II era.

==History==
The American Defense Service Medal was established by Executive Order 8808, on 28 June 1941, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and announced in War Department Bulletin 17, 1941. The criteria for the medal was announced in War Department Circular 44, on 13 February 1942. The service ribbon design was approved by the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy on January 7, 1942. The medal was designed by Mr. Lee Lawrie, a civilian sculptor from Easton, Maryland. The model was approved by the Commission of Fine Arts on May 5, 1942.

==Criteria==
The medal is authorized to military members who served on active duty between President Roosevelt&#x27;s declaration of a limited national emergency on September 8, 1939, and the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Members of the United States Army, to include those in the Organized Reserve and National Guard, received this medal for any length of service during the eligibility period, provided that they were on orders to active duty for a period of twelve months or longer. The United States Navy excluded those reservists who were on active duty for less than ten days during the eligibility period, but otherwise the Navy, United States Marine Corps, and United States Coast Guard awarded the medal to all personnel who served on active duty at any time during the eligibility period, Regular or Reservist, provided they passed their initial physical examinations, such as in the case of those Reservists called back to extended active duty prior to the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, or enlisted recruits or officer candidates who entered the Navy or Marine Corps during the same period.

==Appearance==

The bronze medal is in diameter. On the obverse is a female Grecian figure symbolic of defense, holding in her sinister hand an ancient war shield in reverse and her dexter hand brandishing a sword above her head, and standing upon a conventionalized oak branch with four leaves. Around the top is the lettering &quot;AMERICAN DEFENSE&quot;. The reverse is the wording &quot;FOR SERVICE DURING THE LIMITED EMERGENCY PROCLAIMED BY THE PRESIDENT ON SEPTEMBER 8, 1939 OR DURING THE UNLIMITED EMERGENCY PROCLAIMED BY THE PRESIDENT ON MAY 27, 1941&quot; above a seven-leafed spray of laurel.

The suspension and service ribbon of the medal is wide and consists of the following stripes: Golden Yellow 67104; triparted Old Glory Blue 67178; White 67101; and Scarlet 67111; center Golden Yellow; triparted Scarlet; White; and Old Glory Blue 67178; and Golden yellow. The golden yellow color was symbolic of the golden opportunity of the youth of the United States to serve the National colors, represented by the blue, white and red pin stripes on each side.

==Devices==
The American Defense Service Medal was authorized with the following devices:

* Foreign Service Clasp: Issued by the United States Army for military service outside the continental limits of the United States, including service in Alaska. The foreign service clasp is a bronze bar in width and in length with the words &quot;FOREIGN SERVICE&quot;, with a star at each end of the inscription.
* Base Clasp: Issued by the U.S. Navy and United States Marine Corps for service outside the continental limits of the United States (service in either Alaska or Hawaii qualified).
* Fleet Clasp: Issued by the Navy, Marine Corps and United States Coast Guard for service on the high seas while regularly attached to any vessels of the Atlantic, Pacific, or Asiatic fleets as well as vessels of the Naval Transport Service and vessels operating directly under the Chief of Naval Operations. The Fleet clasp is a bronze bar in width and in length with the words &quot;FLEET&quot; inscribed.
* Sea Clasp: Issued by the Coast Guard for all other vessels and aircraft, not qualifying for the Fleet Clasp, which regularly conducted patrols at sea.
* &quot;A&quot; Device: Awarded to any member of the Navy who served duty in actual or potential belligerent contact with Axis Powers in the Atlantic Ocean between June 22 and December 7, 1941. The &quot;A&quot; Device was also worn on the medal&#x27;s uniform ribbon.

<text>The Rugby Football League (RFL) is the governing body for rugby league in England. Founded in 1895 as the Northern Rugby Football Union following 22 clubs resigning from the Rugby Football Union, it changed its name in 1922 to the Rugby Football League.

Based at Sportcity in Manchester, it is responsible for organising professional competitions and, in association with the British Amateur Rugby League Association (BARLA), the community game. It also provides match officials for every level as well as administering the England national team

The Rugby Football League has been a member of the International Rugby League (IRL) since 1948 and European Rugby League (ERL) since its foundation in 2003.

==History==

===Formation===

On Tuesday 27 August 1895, as a result of an emergency meeting in Manchester, prominent Lancashire rugby clubs Broughton Rangers, Leigh, Oldham, Rochdale Hornets, St Helens, Tyldesley, Warrington, Widnes and Wigan declared that they would support their Yorkshire colleagues in their proposal to form a Northern Union.

Two days later, on Thursday 29 August 1895, representatives of 21 clubs met in the George Hotel, Huddersfield to form the &quot;Northern Rugby Football Union&quot; (usually termed Northern Union or NU). Twenty clubs agreed to resign from the Rugby Football Union, but Dewsbury felt unable to comply with the decision. The Cheshire club, Stockport, had telegraphed the meeting requesting admission to the new organisation and was duly accepted with a second Cheshire club, Runcorn, admitted at the next meeting.

The 22 clubs were:
# Batley
# Bradford FC (switched to association football in 1907 and became Bradford Park Avenue)
# Brighouse Rangers (Folded in 1906, now survives as an amateur club)
# Broughton Rangers (Folded in 1955)
# Halifax
# Huddersfield
# Hull FC
# Hunslet (Folded in 1973 but were resurrected as a Phoenix club)
# Leeds
# Leigh
# Liversedge (Folded in 1902, survive as an amateur club)
# Manningham (Switched to association football in 1903 and became Bradford City)
# Oldham
# Rochdale Hornets
# Runcorn (Folded in 1918)
# St Helens
# Stockport (Folded in 1902)
# Tyldesley (Disbanded in 1902) 
# Wakefield Trinity
# Warrington
# Widnes
# Wigan

===Subsequent events===
Upon its founding, the Northern Union created in league competition with the first season being the 1895–96 season. The Challenge Cup came two years later in 1896–97.

1904 saw the creation of the England national rugby league team who played the Other Nationalities rugby league team in rugby league&#x27;s first international matches.

In 1906, the Northern Union reduced the sport from 15-a-side to 13-a-side.

In 1907, the Northern Union&#x27;s brand of rugby was introduced to New Zealand and saw the first ever rugby league tours of New Zealand to Great Britain. For this tour the Wales national rugby league team was formed with the match between Wales and New Zealand being the first recognised international test match by the International Rugby League. On this tour New Zealand played England, and the newly formed Great Britain national rugby league team combining the best players of England and Wales. The Northern Union would go on to favour the use of a Great Britain side over separate England and Wales sides. A year later, the sport was introduced to Australia and saw a similar tour carried out the Australians.

In 1922, Northern Rugby Union became known as &quot;Rugby League&quot;.

In 1929, the Challenge Cup final moved to the national stadium.

In 1933, an Ashes match was held in France. The following year, with the help of the RFL, the French Rugby League Federation was formed and rugby league reached its fourth country.

In 1954, the first Rugby League World Cup was held in France and was won by Great Britain.

In 1971, the RFL introduced the 6 tackle rule.

The British Amateur Rugby League Association (BARLA) was created in 1973 in Huddersfield by a group of enthusiasts concerned about the dramatic disappearance of many amateur leagues and clubs. Fewer than 150 amateur teams remained with a mere 30 youth rugby league teams. The &#x27;breakaway&#x27; from the RFL was acrimonious and was strongly contested, with a vote 29–1 against recognising BARLA. Thanks to Tom Mitchell, this changed to a unanimous vote of approval for BARLA within 12 months.

In 1976, the RFL created the World Club Challenge, seeing the British champions play the champions of Australia, the only other major rugby league.

1991 saw the introduced of a formalised youth leagues.

Maurice Lindsay became the Chief Executive of the RFL in 1992, proposing the Super League, which replaced Championship as the sport&#x27;s premier league competition from 1996 onwards. Lindsay returned to Wigan in 1999 for his second stint at the club after Sir Rodney Walker, then chairman of the RFL, sacked him from the RFL after a campaign to unseat him failed.

In 1995, the RFL appointed its first Development Officer for Ireland with the aim of assisting Rugby League Ireland in the sports development across the Irish Sea. 1995 also saw the Great Britain side reserved to tours with England and Wales competing separately in the World Cup.

1996 saw the switch to summer rugby and the creation of the Super League. The competition aimed to be a European competition outside of the British rugby league system, however this never materialised. Despite this, Paris Saint-Germain F.C. formed a rugby league team who competed in the first two seasons, marking the first foreign team to complete in the British game.

The RFL accumulated losses of £1.9 million at the end of 2001, shortly before a major restructuring of the governing body and the appointment of Richard Lewis as executive chairman in May 2002. Within a year of joining the RFL, he oversaw reunification with BARLA after nearly 30 years of division. Lewis left in 2012 to become Chief Executive of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. The RFL net value has been positive every year since 2004, being £1.7 million in 2011.

In 2002, London Skolars became the first amateur club to join the professional system, being the first club to do so in 80 years, and marked the start of a period where a number of clubs moved up, each with various levels of success and failure.

In 2006, Catalans Dragons joined the British game, marking the second French team to do so. Unlike PSG, Catalans would go on to be a success in the British game.

In 2011 a major change to the game was agreed, changing from a winter to a summer game, starting in 2012 with a playing season from March to November, aligning with the Super League, which has played this way since 1996. The regional leagues may include winter competitions in addition.

In 2012, the Rugby Football League were awarded the Stonewall Sport Award in recognition of their work in embracing inclusivity and tackling homophobia. They also became the first UK sporting organisation to make the top 100 employers in the Stonewall Index that measures attitudes towards lesbian, gay and bisexual staff.

Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex served as patron until February 2021. He was replaced by his sister in law The Princess of Wales. Lindsay Hoyle the speaker of the House of Commons is the current president a role which is usually filled by a high-profile individual for 1–2 years with the aim of promoting the game.

==Responsibility==
The Rugby Football League began in 1895 as a rival governing body for rugby in England (rugby league and rugby union had not yet formally diverged at this time) and operated in Northern England only. By 1907, rugby league had begun in Wales with Welsh clubs being incorporated into the Northern English league and saw a separate short lived Wales only league being run by the RFL. 1909 saw the sport&#x27;s introduced in Scotland, but did not see the same response as Wales. Despite this, the RFL established itself as the governing body for rugby league in Great Britain.

This was the norm until 1994 and the founding of Scotland Rugby League and Wales Rugby League a year later. These bodies became the official governing body for Scotland and Wales leaving the RFL as the official governing body for rugby league in England only. Despite this, Scotland Rugby League is partnered with the RFL in attempt to aid the sport&#x27;s development in Scotland, and Wales Rugby League shares governance with the RFL over the domestic competition but has full control of the national team. The RFL never attempted to govern rugby league in Ireland but does assist the sport&#x27;s development with Rugby League Ireland who were formed in 1988.

Internationally, the RFL established the England national rugby league team in 1904, and Wales and Great Britain in 1907. English, Welsh, Scottish, and Irish players were selected for Great Britain. National teams of Scotland and Ireland were never established under the RFL. The Wales national team has been run by Wales Rugby League since 1995.

==Competitions==
The RFL operates a five-tier system and is responsible for running the top three professional divisions as well as the National Conference League and various regional leagues below that. The RFL also runs two cup competitions for professional clubs and is involved with the organisation of the World Club Challenge alongside Australia&#x27;s National Rugby League.

==Teams==
===English national team===
The England national rugby league team represent England in international rugby league football tournaments. The team has now seen a revival, having largely formed from the Great Britain team, who also represented Wales, Scotland and Ireland. The team is run under the auspices of the Rugby Football League. As of 2023, the team now participates in all World Cups and Test matches.

The team dates back to 1904 when they played against a mixture of Welsh and Scottish players in Wigan. Since then, and right up until the 1950s, they regularly toured Australia and New Zealand and played both home and away matches against neighbours Wales and France. But when it was decided that Great Britain would tour the Southern Hemisphere instead of England, France and Wales became the only regular opponents. Even then though, there are some long periods where England barely played any matches. Their first appearance in the Rugby League World Cup was in 1975, and since then they have been runners-up in 1975, 1995 (as hosts) and 2017. In 2022 England hosted the delayed 2021 World Cup. For many years England also competed in the European Nations Cup and in 2006, an England &#x27;A&#x27; team, competed for the Federation Shield. In the past England&#x27;s main rivals have been Wales and France, with the rivalry stretching back to 1908 and 1934 respectively. However, England&#x27;s main rivals would now be Australia, New Zealand and, to a lesser extent, France.

Traditionally a predominantly white kit is worn including white shorts and socks. However the shirt usually features some form of red, like red stripes, crosses or chevrons. These colours are similar to other English sporting teams and are the colours used on the national flag. In 2008 a new kit was introduced featuring a red cross on the front and red strips down the sides of the shirt, shorts and socks were white too with red strips. Also in 2008 the Rugby Football League chose to abandon the traditional English lion on the badge in favour of a much simpler shield and cross design, nevertheless the team will still be known as &quot;The Lions&quot;.

As of September 2024 the team is ranked third in the world, behind Australia and New Zealand. Shaun Wane is head coach and George Williams is the current captain.

===Great Britain national team===

The Great Britain national rugby league team represents Great Britain in rugby league football. Administered by the Rugby Football League (RFL), the team is nicknamed the &quot;Great Britain Lions&quot;, or simply &quot;The Lions&quot;.

For most of the 20th century the Great Britain team was assembled to go on tours overseas, and to play against foreign touring teams, as well as competing in Rugby League World Cup tournaments. They were one of the strongest teams in rugby league, though usually playing second fiddle to Australia. They won the Rugby League World Cup on three occasions: 1954, 1960 and 1972.

Since 1995 the RFL have sent the home nations as separate teams for World Cup purposes. Great Britain continued to compete as a test playing nation both home and away. They competed against Australia for the Ashes, and New Zealand for the Baskerville Shield, as well the Tri-Nations series with both Australia and New Zealand. Great Britain also played in series and tours against other nations such as France, Papua New Guinea and Fiji.

In 2006, the RFL announced that after the 2007 All Golds Tour the Great Britain team would no longer compete on a regular basis, and that players would be able to represent England, Wales and Scotland at Test level. It is planned that the Great Britain team will come together in future only for occasional tours, similar to the British and Irish Lions in rugby union.

==Board of directors==
The RFL board consists of the following:
===Young People&#x27;s Advisory Panel===

The RFL launched the Young People&#x27;s Advisory Panel in 2010, a group consisting of young people aged 16–25 from across England. The national panel meet at least three times a year at the RFL&#x27;s headquarters to discuss and debate the following:

* Changes in the structure of youth rugby;
* Communications between young rugby league enthusiasts and the RFL;
* RFL policies which impact on young people.

Two nominated members will also sit on the youth &amp; junior forum, a key device used to advance youth rugby league.

==Presidents==
==Logo==
The first logo used by the RFL was an oval shape, representing the ball with XIII and 13 over it and &quot;The Rugby Football League&quot; around it. The logo was also seen on the sleeve of teams shirts.

In the late 1990s the logo was changed to a more simplistic design to the old one. It had a rugby ball shape with three small lines, representing 13 players, and two long lines, representing goalposts, arranged on a rugby ball so as to suggest a hand carrying or passing it. The &quot;Rugby Football League&quot; was abbreviated to &quot;RFL&quot;.

In 2017 the RFL had its most radical rebrand since the formation of Super League. The new logo was a rectangular background meant to represent The George Hotel in Huddersfield, where rugby league was founded and 1895 the year it was founded. Thirteen stripes inside it represent thirteen players. The oval on top represents the ball and the appreciation RFL has been replaced with &quot;Rugby Football League&quot;.

==Headquarters==
The RFLs current headquarters are at Sportcity Eithad Campus in East Manchester. The RFL first moved into permanent headquarters in 1922 at 180 Chapeltown Road, Leeds, where it stayed for 73 years before leaving in 1995 to Red Hall in Leeds, a Grade II listed brick building dating from 1642. The RFL left Red Hall and Leeds in May 2021 with the building becoming a private hospital.

In 2015, some departments including Super League, moved to offices at Quay West in Trafford Wharf, Greater Manchester.

<doc id="878257" wikidata="Q4532505" url="?curid=878257" title="AutoAlliance Thailand">
<text>Auto Alliance Co., Ltd. or AutoAlliance Thailand (AAT) is the name of a joint venture automobile assembly firm co-owned by Ford and Mazda in Rayong province, Thailand. Modeled after the Ford-Mazda AutoAlliance International joint venture in the United States, AAT builds compact pickup trucks and SUVs primarily for the Southeast Asian market, with exports to Australia and other developing markets as well.

The factory in Thailand is designed to be similar to Mazda&#x27;s Hofu plant, and is arranged as four squares.

==History==
Ford&#x27;s sales in Thailand began in 1913 with the Model T, and in 1961 Ford began assembling vehicles there. &quot;Anglo-Thai Motors Company&quot;, Ford&#x27;s distributor (which sold Ford Europe and Ford Australia products), announced in 1960 that it would build a factory in the country, with &quot;Thai Motor Company&quot; the result. This was the first time cars had been built in Thailand: Ford Capris and Cortinas were assembled locally using components from the UK. Mazda first began exporting utility vehicles to Thailand in 1950. In 1974 &quot;Sukosol &amp; Mazda Motor Industry&quot; was founded, opening Mazda&#x27;s first knock-down assembly plant in 1975.

Ford brought Thai Motor under its corporate umbrella in 1973, but closed the factory just three years later. Ford&#x27;s presence returned in 1985 with the formation of the &quot;New Era Company&quot; to sell cars and trucks in the country.

Construction on the AutoAlliance plant began on 28 November 1995, and the plant began mass production on 29 May 1998. The grand opening ceremony on 1 July 1998, was attended by Chuan Leekpai, the then-prime minister of Thailand.

== Ford Thailand Manufacturing ==
A separate second plant for Ford, &quot;Ford Thailand Manufacturing (FTM)&quot; was opened in 2012. Located 14 km from AAT, the new plant has a production capacity of 150,000 vehicles a year, boosting the annual Ford Thailand production capacity to 445,000 vehicles. The US$450 million (THB 15 billion) assembly plant is fully integrated to support body assembly, paint, trim, and final assembly. Up to 85 percent of the plant&#x27;s production will be for markets outside Thailand. Initially, it produced passenger cars including the Fiesta, Focus and EcoSport. The plant started manufacturing the Ranger pickup truck in 2016, and ended the production of passenger cars in 2018. In December 2021, Ford announced it had invested $900 million to modernise both the Ford Thailand Manufacturing and AutoAlliance Thailand plants.

<text>Clementine Ogilvy Spencer-Churchill, Baroness Spencer-Churchill, (; 1 April 1885 – 12 December 1977) was the wife of Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and a life peer in her own right. While she was legally the daughter of Sir Henry Hozier, her mother Lady Blanche&#x27;s known infidelity and his suspected infertility makes her paternity uncertain. 

Clementine met Churchill in 1904 and they began their marriage of 56 years in 1908. They had five children together, one of whom (named Marigold) died aged two from sepsis. During the First World War, Clementine organised canteens for munitions workers and during the Second World War, she acted as Chairman of the Red Cross Aid to Russia Fund, President of the Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association War Time Appeal and Chairman of Maternity Hospital for the Wives of Officers, Fulmer Chase, South Bucks.

Throughout her life she was granted many titles, the final being a life peerage following the death of her husband in 1965. In her later years, she sold several of her husband&#x27;s portraits to help support herself financially. She died in her London home aged 92.

== Early life ==
Although legally the daughter of Sir Henry Hozier and Lady Blanche Ogilvy (a daughter of David Ogilvy, 10th Earl of Airlie), her paternity is a subject of debate, as Lady Blanche was well known for infidelity. After Sir Henry found Lady Blanche with a lover in 1891, she managed to avert her husband&#x27;s suit for divorce because of his own infidelities, and thereafter the couple separated.

Clementine&#x27;s biographer, Joan Hardwick, has surmised (due in part to Sir Henry Hozier&#x27;s reputed sterility) that all Lady Blanche&#x27;s &quot;Hozier&quot; children were actually fathered by her sister&#x27;s husband, Bertram Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale (1837–1916), who is also known as the grandfather of the famous Mitford sisters. While Mitford is considered the most probable candidate, it has also been asserted that Bay Middleton was her father. Whatever her true paternity, Clementine is recorded as being the daughter of Lady Blanche and Sir Henry.
In the summer of 1899, when Clementine was 14, her mother moved the family to Dieppe, a coastal community in the north of France. There the family spent an idyllic summer, bathing, canoeing, picnicking, and blackberrying. While in Dieppe, the family became well acquainted with &#x27;La Colonie&#x27;, or the other English inhabitants living by the sea. This group consisted of military men, writers and painters, such as Aubrey Beardsley and Walter Sickert. The latter came to be a great friend of the family.

According to Clementine&#x27;s daughter, Mary Soames, Clementine was deeply struck by Sickert and thought he was the most handsome and compelling man she had ever seen. The Hoziers&#x27; happy life in France ended when Kitty, the eldest daughter, was struck with typhoid fever. Blanche Hozier sent Clementine and her sister Nellie to Scotland so she could devote her time completely to Kitty. Kitty died on 5 March 1900.

Clementine was educated first at home, then briefly at the Edinburgh school run by Karl Fröbel, the nephew of the German educationist, Friedrich Fröbel, and his wife Johanna and later at Berkhamsted School for Girls in Berkhamsted Hertfordshire (The School has now evolved into Berkhamsted School) and at the Sorbonne in Paris. She was twice secretly engaged to Sir Sidney Peel, who had fallen in love with her when she was 18.

==Marriage and children==
Clementine first met Winston Churchill in 1904 at a ball in Crewe Hall, the home of the Earl and Countess of Crewe. In March 1908, they met again when seated side by side at a dinner party hosted by Lady St Helier, a distant relative of Clementine. On their first brief encounter, Winston had recognised Clementine&#x27;s beauty and distinction; now, after an evening spent in her company, he realised she was a girl of lively intelligence and great character. After five months of meeting each other at social events, as well as frequent correspondence, Winston proposed to Clementine during a house party at Blenheim Palace on 11 August 1908, in a small summer house known as the Temple of Diana.

Winston and Clementine were married on 12 September 1908 in St. Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster. They honeymooned in Baveno, Venice and Veveří Castle in Moravia before settling into a London home at 33 Eccleston Square. They had five children: Diana (1909–1963), Randolph (1911–1968), Sarah (1914–1982), Marigold (1918–1921) and Mary (1922–2014). Only Mary, the youngest, shared their parents&#x27; longevity (Marigold died aged two and Diana, Sarah, and Randolph died in their 50s or 60s). The Churchills&#x27; marriage was close and affectionate despite the stresses of public life.

During the First World War, Clementine Churchill organised canteens for munitions workers on behalf of YMCA in the North East Metropolitan Area of London, for which she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1918.

Clementine travelled to Dundee in 1922, campaigning on behalf of her husband in the 1922 general election while he was incapacitated after having his appendix removed.

In the 1930s, Clementine travelled without Winston aboard Lord Moyne&#x27;s yacht, the &quot;Rosaura&quot;, to exotic islands: Borneo, Celebes, the Moluccas, New Caledonia, and the New Hebrides. During this trip, many believe that she had an affair with Terence Philip, a wealthy art dealer seven years her junior. However, no conclusive evidence of this has been produced: indeed, Philip was believed by many to have been homosexual. She brought back from this trip a Bali dove. When it died, she buried it in the garden at Chartwell beneath a sundial. On the sundial&#x27;s base, she had inscribed:

&lt;poem style=&quot;font-style:italic; margin-left:1.6em&quot;&gt;
HERE LIES THE BALI DOVE
It does not do to wander
Too far from sober men.
But there’s an island yonder,
I think of it again.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Clementine edited and rehearsed Churchill&#x27;s speeches, as well as managing and attending high-level diplomatic summits.

As the wife of a politician who often took controversial stands, Clementine was used to being snubbed and treated rudely by the wives of other politicians. However, she could take only so much. Once, traveling with Lord Moyne and his guests, the party was listening to a BBC broadcast in which the speaker, a vehemently pro-appeasement politician, criticised Winston by name. Vera, Lady Broughton, a guest of Moyne, said &quot;hear, hear&quot; at the criticism of Churchill. Clementine waited for her host to offer a conciliatory word but, when none came, she stormed back to her cabin, wrote a note to Moyne, and packed her bags. Lady Broughton came and begged Clementine to stay, but she would accept no apologies for the insult to her husband. She went ashore and sailed for home the next morning.

During the Second World War, she was Chairman of the Red Cross Aid to Russia Fund, the president of the Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association War Time Appeal and the Chairman of Maternity Hospital for the Wives of Officers, Fulmer Chase. While touring Russia near the end of the war, she was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.
In 1946, she was appointed Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire, becoming Dame Clementine Churchill .

She was awarded honorary degrees by the University of Glasgow, University of Oxford and University of Bristol.

==Later life and death==
After more than 56 years of marriage, Clementine was widowed on 24 January 1965 when her husband died aged 90.

After Sir Winston&#x27;s death, on 17 May 1965, she was created a life peer as Baroness Spencer-Churchill, of Chartwell in the County of Kent. She sat as a cross-bencher, but her growing deafness precluded her taking a regular part in parliamentary life.
In her final few years, inflation and rising expenses left Lady Spencer-Churchill in financial difficulties and in early 1977 she sold at auction five paintings by her late husband. After her death, it was discovered that she had destroyed the Graham Sutherland portrait of her husband because Sir Winston had disliked it.

Lady Spencer-Churchill died at her London home, at 7 Princes Gate, Knightsbridge, of a heart attack on 12 December 1977. She was 92 years old and had outlived her husband by almost 13 years, as well as three of her five children.

She is buried with her husband and children at St Martin&#x27;s Church, Bladon, near Woodstock in Oxfordshire.

==Memorials==
The Clementine Churchill Hospital in Harrow, Middlesex, is named after her.

A plaque on the Berkhamsted house where the young Clementine Hozier had lived during her education at Berkhamsted School for Girls was unveiled in 1979 by her youngest daughter, Baroness Soames. A blue plaque also commemorates her residence there.

==In popular culture==
Churchill was played by Virginia McKenna in the 1974 television biopic &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot; opposite Richard Burton. She was played by Vanessa Redgrave in the 2002 biographical television movie &quot;The Gathering Storm.&quot; Dame Harriet Walter depicted her in the first series of Peter Morgan&#x27;s Netflix drama &quot;The Crown&quot;, and she was played by Dame Kristin Scott Thomas in the 2017 film &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;.

She was also featured in Jack Thorne&#x27;s 2023 play &quot;When Winston Went to War with the Wireless&quot;, played by Laura Rogers.

<doc id="878273" wikidata="Q213146" url="?curid=878273" title="Prince Patrick Island">
<text>A member of the Arctic Archipelago, Prince Patrick Island is the westernmost of the Queen Elizabeth Islands in the Northwest Territories of Canada, lying northwest of Melville Island. The area of Prince Patrick Island is , making it the 55th largest island in the world and Canada&#x27;s 14th largest island. It has historically been icebound all year, making it one of the least accessible parts of Canada. Located at the entrance of the M&#x27;Clure Strait, Prince Patrick Island is uninhabited.

The first known sighting of the island was in 1853 by the Irish naval officer George Mecham, when it was explored by him and his fellow Irish explorer Francis Leopold McClintock in the spring of that year during the Edward Belcher expedition. Much later, it was named for Prince Arthur William Patrick, Duke of Connaught, who was Governor General of Canada from 1911 to 1916.

The island rises to only about , and the area is seismically active.

==Weather Station==
A High Arctic Weather Station (&quot;HAWS&quot;) and associated airstrip called Mould Bay were opened in 1948 as part of a joint Canada-US military effort to support a weather station network. Regular weather observations began on May 14, 1948. It had a temporary staff of between 10 and 40 people. Staff size normally increased during summer months, when the station was resupplied from the south.

During the period of US National Weather Service participation, the site was known as a Joint Arctic Weather Station (&quot;JAWS&quot;). Executive officers alternated between Canadians and their US counterparts. US participation ended in 1972. The station was closed in 1997, owing to budget cuts. It was replaced with an automated weather station at a new location on the airstrip, downhill from the central buildings and observatory. The last staffed weather observations were taken on March 31, 1997, ending the continuous weather record of 1948–1997.

The buildings still stand, but as of 2017, most have deteriorated to an unrepairable state. The station represented the only known long-term human settlement of the Island.

==Climate==
Mould Bay has a Polar climate (ET) with cool, intermittent summers and long, severely cold winters. September is the snowiest month of the year, averaging of snowfall.
==In popular culture==
Prince Patrick Island is the setting for a work of fiction, the novel &quot;The Lost Ones&quot; (1961) by Ian Cameron (Donald G. Payne). It was filmed as the Walt Disney Pictures film &quot;The Island at the Top of the World&quot; in 1974. The novel tells of a lost colony of Vikings living in a lost valley in the island, which, thanks to the volcanoes on the island, is warm and habitable.

<text>Richard Montgomery Gano (June 17, 1830 – March 27, 1913) was a physician, Protestant minister, and brigadier general in the army of the Confederate States during the American Civil War.

==Early life==
Richard Gano was born June 17, 1830, near Springdale in Bourbon County, Kentucky, the son of John Allen Gano, who was the son of Gen. Richard M. Gano, veteran of the War of 1812. John Allen Gano was a minister in the Disciples of Christ and was active in the Restoration Movement with Alexander Campbell and Barton W. Stone. The first General Richard Gano was the son of Rev. John Gano and Sarah Stites. (Rev. John Gano was the first pastor of the First Baptist Church of New York City and was known as the &quot;Fighting Chaplain&quot; for his Revolutionary War exploits. He is also credited with having baptized George Washington in the Potomac River although this is disputed.) Gano was of Huguenot descent. Through John Gano he was a cousin of Union General William Price Sanders and Texas State Legislator William Hubbel Price.

Richard was baptized into the church at age ten, and at twelve he entered Bacon College in Harrodsburg, Kentucky (Bacon was the progenitor of the University of Kentucky). He completed his course of studies at Bethany College in Bethany, Virginia (now West Virginia) about 1847, and then attended Louisville Medical Institute in Louisville, Kentucky, from which he graduated in 1849.

Gano practiced medicine first in Kentucky, then in Baton Rouge, Louisiana (including two years as physician to the Louisiana State Prison), until 1858. He married Martha (&quot;Mattie&quot;) Jones Welch of Crab Orchard, Kentucky, March 15, 1853, in Garrard County, Kentucky, and they had twelve children, nine of whom lived to adulthood. Martha was born October 8, 1832, and died September 22, 1895, in Dallas, Texas. Allene Stone Gano, mother of aviation billionaire Howard Hughes, was General Gano&#x27;s granddaughter.

In 1859, Gano moved his family to Grapevine Prairie, Texas, in northeast Tarrant County (roughly on the present site of the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport), and began farming and stockraising, as well as continuing to practice medicine. He was particularly interested in introducing Kentucky race horse breeds to Texas. He was soon involved in community efforts to pursue Comanche raiding parties, and was presented a sword for his efforts by local citizens. In 1860, he was elected to the Texas legislature from Tarrant County, where he was active in debates on frontier defense and agricultural issues.

==Civil War==

He resigned his seat early in 1861 to enter Confederate service and on June 1 was elected captain of the &quot;Grapevine Volunteers&quot;, a company of mounted riflemen he had raised. By early March 1862, he had reorganized his unit into a partial cavalry squadron of two companies, which was mustered into direct Confederate service and was assigned to Col. John Hunt Morgan&#x27;s 2nd Kentucky Cavalry at Chattanooga, Tennessee. Capt. Gano, commanding Company G, took part in Morgan&#x27;s first Kentucky raid in July 1862 as well as Morgan&#x27;s raid on the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad in August. During the latter campaign, he was promoted to major in command of a full cavalry squadron (his original two companies plus a third company raised in Tennessee), which he led at the Battle of Gallatin.

In September 1862, Gano&#x27;s squadron became the nucleus of the new 7th Kentucky Cavalry Regiment and he was promoted to colonel in Gen. Morgan&#x27;s new cavalry brigade. The regiment took part in all the actions of Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith&#x27;s invasion of Kentucky in the fall of 1862, culminating in the Battle of Perryville on October 8, the Battle of Lexington on October 17, and the retreat into east Tennessee. The 7th Kentucky Cavalry subsequently took part in Morgan&#x27;s second Kentucky raid, December 1862 to January 1863, and by February Gano (though still a colonel) was in command of the First Cavalry Brigade of Gen. Morgan&#x27;s cavalry division. On April 3, the brigade was attacked at Snows Hill, Tennessee, by some 8,000 Union infantry and cavalry and was forced to withdraw to McMinnville. Shortly after this, Morgan&#x27;s forces were essentially destroyed during Morgan&#x27;s Raid, and the remnants rejoined Gano&#x27;s depleted brigade. On September 18, 1863, Col. Gano commanded both his own brigade and Morgan&#x27;s survivors under Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest at the Battle of Chickamauga.

Gano left active service for a period because of illness, then was promoted to brigadier general (though he did not receive his &quot;official&quot; promotion until March 17, 1865) and took the eighty-odd survivors of his original Texas cavalry unit (now called the &quot;Gano Guards&quot;) back to Bonham, Texas. There he assumed command, October 10, 1863, of all Texas cavalry operating in the Trans-Mississippi Department. On December 27, Gano&#x27;s brigade captured and occupied Waldron, Arkansas, and in April 1864 he suffered an arm wound at a skirmish at Moscow, Arkansas. Two months later, he commanded the attack on Fort Smith, Arkansas, and on July 27, 1864, he led an attack on the 6th Kansas Cavalry at the Battle of Massard Prairie.

A few weeks later, Gano&#x27;s brigade, with accompanying artillery, moved to Indian Territory and on September 19 he commanded both the Fifth Texas Cavalry Brigade (made up of the 29th, 30th, and 31st Texas Cavalry and the 11th Field Battery (Howell&#x27;s Company, Light Artillery) and Brig. Gen. Stand Watie&#x27;s Indian cavalry (consisting of Cherokee, Creek, and Seminole) at the second Battle of Cabin Creek. His commission reportedly predated Stand Watie&#x27;s by one month, putting him in command by seniority. In this action, the general was wounded again but Confederate forces totaling about 2,000 captured a federal supply train of some three hundred wagons and 750 mules, valued at more than two million dollars. In a congratulatory telegram, Gen. Kirby Smith called this &quot;one of the most brilliant raids of the entire war&quot;.

In January 1865, as part of a last reorganization of troops west of the Mississippi by Kirby Smith, the brigade was ordered to Nacogdoches, but on May 26, the Army of the Trans-Mississippi surrendered to federal forces. Gano had been recommended for promotion to major general but the war ended before this could be acted upon.

==Postwar career==
In 1866, Gano returned to Kentucky, where he was ordained a minister in the Disciples of Christ by his father and by Winthrop Hobson of the Old Union Church. By 1870, he had taken up residence in Dallas, where he resumed stockraising and preached regularly. Over the next thirty years, he was instrumental in establishing a number of churches, both in north Texas and in Kentucky, and was active in the Prohibition movement of the 1880s. Western Heights Church of Christ, South MaCarthur Church of Christ and Highland Oaks Church of Christ, are some of the historic church that trace their beginnings to Gano&#x27;s work.

As a stockman in the later 19th century, Gano imported a number of important bloodlines into Texas, including cattle, horses, sheep, and hogs. He also was a general businessman, forming a real estate company with two of his sons, and serving as a director of the Bankers and Merchants National Bank in Dallas. These involvements led to his becoming a millionaire. He also was active in United Confederate Veterans.

With his sons, John T. Gano and Clarence M. Gano, he formed the Estado Land and Cattle Company, where he served as vice president. The company established the G4 Ranch in the Big Bend region of Texas in late 1880s and early 1890s. The G4 was one of the largest in the Trans-Pecos in that period. The G4 Ranch comprised 55,000 acres in survey Block G4 (hence the name of the ranch) and leased other watered sections nearby. Ranch headquarters were at Oak Spring or Ojo de Chisos, just west of the basin in what is now Big Bend National Park. The ranch extended from Agua Fria Mountain on the north to the Rio Grande on the south, and from Terlingua Creek on the west to the Chisos Mountains on the east; it thus covered most of what is now southwestern Brewster County, Texas. The Ganos persuaded James B. Gillett to resign as marshal of El Paso to manage the ranch. This was land that had never been stocked; at the time, recalled Gillett, &quot;The Ganos had it all to themselves.&quot;

Richard Gano died March 27, 1913, at the home of his daughter Mrs. Emma Scurry, 1903 Bennett Ave in Dallas and is buried in Oakland Cemetery.

In 1974, the &quot;dog-trot&quot; house he purchased at Grapevine Prairie in 1857 was moved to Dallas Heritage Village, which is located on Gano Street, named for Richard Gano. The house was originally built of logs and was later covered with white clapboard siding.

<text>General elections were held in the Netherlands on 25 June 1952. The Catholic People&#x27;s Party and the Labour Party both won 30 of the 100 seats in the House of Representatives. It was the first time since 1913 that the Catholic People&#x27;s Party and its predecessors had not received a plurality of the vote.

The elections led to a continuation of the previous four-party government, consisting of Labour, the Catholic People&#x27;s Party, People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy and the Christian Historical Union. However, three months after the elections the VVD left the government and were replaced by the Anti-Revolutionary Party.

<text>Les Nubians is a French musical duo, composed of sisters Hélène and Célia Faussart from Paris, France. In 1985, the sisters moved with their parents to Chad. Seven years later, they returned to Bordeaux, France, and began singing a cappella, producing poetry slams in Bordeaux and Paris, and singing background vocals for various artists worldwide. The duo&#x27;s debut album &quot;Princesses Nubiennes&quot; was released by Virgin Records, France, in 1998.

They have become one of the most successful French-language musical groups in the U.S., best known for their Billboard R&amp;B Single &quot;Makeda&quot; from their Grammy nominated album &quot;Princesses Nubiennes&quot;. Les Nubians were the 1999 Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards winners for Best New Artist, Group or Duo and received two NAACP Image Awards nominations in 2000.

In May 2020, the sisters were featured in the Visual Collaborative Polaris catalog. In a series titled &quot;TwentyEightyFour&quot; released during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, their interview announced a music single LIBERATION. Rika Muranaka, Dakore Akande appeared in the same periodical. The duo executive-produced &quot;Echos, Chapter One&quot; in 2005 on their label Nubiatik; a joint venture with Triloka Records. The project features artists from France, and the U.S. performing poetry and music from the urban edge. &quot;Echos, Chapter One: Nubian Voyager&quot; was released in 2006 as a book accompaniment to the CD.

<text>General elections were held in the Netherlands on 13 June 1956. For the first time, the Labour Party (PvdA) emerged as the largest party, winning 50 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives.

The elections led to the continuation of the four-party coalition government, consisting of the PvdA, Catholic People&#x27;s Party, Anti-Revolutionary Party and Christian Historical Union.

==Electoral system==
Prior to the elections the number of seats in the House of Representatives was raised from 100 to 150. This meant that the electoral threshold was reduced from 1% to 0.67%.

<text>The Virginia Range is a mountain range of western Nevada, primarily within Storey County, and extending east into Lyon County. The range is named after James Finney, &quot;Old Virginny&quot;, an early discoverer of gold associated with the Comstock Lode.

==Geography==
The mountain range forms a portion of the drainage divide between the Truckee River (north) and the Carson River (south). Truckee Meadows and the Washoe Valley are to the west, and the Lahontan Valley is to the east. It is associated with the Flowery Range.

Several paths lead into the Virginia Range. The highest peak is Mount Davidson at , near Virginia City, Nevada. Other nearby peaks are Mount Bullion at and Ophir Hill at .

==Flora==
Jeffrey pine (&quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot;) is the dominant species at higher elevations. Other trees in the range include the Single-leaf Pinyon Pine (&quot;Pinus monophylla&quot;) and Utah Juniper (&quot;Juniperus osteosperma&quot;).

<doc id="878311" wikidata="Q356186" url="?curid=878311" title="Lenticular printing">
<text>Lenticular printing is a technology in which lenticular lenses (a technology also used for 3D displays) are used to produce printed images with an illusion of depth, or the ability to change or move as they are viewed from different angles.

Examples include flip and animation effects such as winking eyes, and modern advertising graphics whose messages change depending on the viewing angle. It can be used to create frames of animation, for a motion effect; offsetting the various layers at different increments, for a 3D effect; or simply to show sets of alternative images that appear to transform into each other.

Colloquial terms for lenticular prints include &quot;flickers&quot;, &quot;winkies&quot;, &quot;wiggle pictures&quot;, and &quot;tilt cards&quot;. The trademarks &quot;Vari-Vue&quot; and &quot;Magic Motion&quot; are often used for lenticular pictures, without regard to the actual manufacturer.

==Process==

Lenticular printing is a multi-step process that consists of creating a lenticular image from at least two images, and placing it behind a lenticular lens. 

=== Creation and interlacing of images ===
Once the images are collected, they are arranged in individual frame files, then digitally combined into a single file in a process called interlacing. Interlacing can be done manually using a raster graphics editor or using dedicated interlacing software.

=== Printing and assembly ===
The interlaced image may be printed directly on the back (smooth side) of the lens, or on a substrate (ideally a synthetic paper) that is laminated to the lens. When printing on the backside of the lens, the critical registration of the fine &quot;slices&quot; of interlaced images must be absolutely correct during the lithographic or screen printing process to avoid &quot;ghosting&quot; and poor image definition.

=== Variations and effects ===
The combined lenticular print shows two or more images by changing the angle from which the print is viewed. If a sequence of images is used, it can even show a short animation.

Though normally produced in sheet form by interlacing simple images or colors throughout the artwork, lenticular images can also be created in roll form with 3D effects or multi-color changes. Alternatively, several images of the same object, taken from slightly different angles, can be used to create a lenticular print with a stereoscopic 3D effect. 3D effects can be achieved only in a lateral (side-by-side) orientation, as each of the viewer&#x27;s eyes must see them from a slightly different angle to achieve the stereoscopic effect. Other effects, like morphs, motion, and zooms work better (with less ghosting or latent effects) in top-to-bottom orientation, but can be achieved in both orientations.

=== Materials and manufacturing processes ===
There are many commercial processes in the manufacture of lenticular images, which can be made from PVC, APET, acrylic, and PETG, as well as other materials. While PETG and APET are the most common, other materials are becoming popular to accommodate outdoor use and special forming due to the increasing use of lenticular images on items such as gift cards. Lithographic lenticular printing allows for the flat side of the lenticular sheet to have ink placed directly onto the lens, while high-resolution photographic lenticulars typically have the image laminated to the lens.

Lenticular images saw a surge in popularity in the first decade of the 21st century, appearing on the cover of the May 2006 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, trading cards, sports posters, and signs in stores that help to attract buyers.

== Construction ==

Each image is arranged (slicing) into strips, which are then interlaced with one or more similarly arranged images (splicing). These are printed on the back of a piece of plastic, with a series of thin lenses molded into the opposite side. Alternatively, the images can be printed on paper, which is then bonded to the plastic. With the new technology, lenses are printed in the same printing operation as the interlaced image, either on both sides of a flat sheet of transparent material, or on the same side of a sheet of paper, the image being covered with a transparent sheet of plastic or with a layer of transparent, which in turn is printed with several layers of varnish to create the lenses.

The lenses are accurately aligned with the interlaces of the image, so that light reflected off each strip is refracted in a slightly different direction, but the light from all pixels originating from the same original image is sent in the same direction. The result is that a single eye looking at the print sees a single whole image, but two eyes will see different images, which leads to stereoscopic 3D perception.

==Types of lenticular prints==
There are three distinct types of lenticular prints, distinguished by how great a change in angle of view is required to change the image:

;Transforming prints: Here two or more different pictures are used, and the lenses are designed to require a relatively large change in angle of view to switch from one image to another. This allows viewers to easily see the original images, since small movements cause no change. Larger movement of the viewer or the print causes the image to flip from one image to another (the &quot;flip effect&quot;). An example of this is the lenticular print of hockey player Mario Tremblay at Centre Mario-Tremblay in Alma, Quebec, where he is transformed from a minor hockey playing boy as an Alma Eagle into the professional hockey playing man, four years later, as a Montreal Canadien.

;Animated prints: Here the distance between different angles of view is &quot;medium&quot;, so that while both eyes usually see the same picture, moving a little bit switches to the next picture in the series. Two or more sequential images are used, with only small differences between each image and the next. This can be used to create an image that moves (&quot;motion effect&quot;), or can create a &quot;zoom&quot; or &quot;morph&quot; effect, in which part of the image expands in size or changes shape as the angle of view changes. The movie poster of the film Species II is an example of this technique.
;Stereoscopic effects: Here the change in viewing angle needed to change images is small, so that each eye sees a slightly different view. This creates a 3D effect without requiring special glasses, using two or more images. For example, the Dolby-Philips Lenticular 3D display produces 28 different images.

==Motorized lenticular==
With static (non-motorized) lenticular, the viewer either moves the piece or moves past the piece in order to see the graphic effects. With motorized lenticular, a motor moves the graphics behind the lens, enabling the graphic effects while both the viewer and the display remain stationary.

==History==

===Predecessors===

====Tabula scalata====

Corrugated images that change when viewed from different angles predate the development of lenticular printing. A few examples from the paleolithic era exist in French caves. &quot;Tabula scalata&quot; or &quot;turning pictures&quot; were popular in England since the 16th century. Extant double paintings, with two distinct images on a corrugated panel, are known from the 17th century.

H.C.J. Deeks used a similar technique with minute vertical corrugations pressed into photographic paper and then exposed to two different images from two different angles. Under a 1906 patent H.C.J. Deeks &amp; Co marketed a &quot;Puzzle Post Card&quot; or &quot;Photochange Post Card&quot;. In 1907 a &quot;Colorchange Post Card&quot; followed, featuring identical pictures on each side of the corrugations that were sprayed with different &quot;liquid pigment or coloring matter&quot; on (parts of) each side.

====Barrier grid autostereograms and animation====
The oldest known publication about using a line sheet as a parallax barrier to produce an autostereogram is found in an article by Auguste Berthier in the French scientific magazine &quot;Le Cosmos&quot; of May 1896. Berthier&#x27;s idea was hardly noticed, but American inventor Frederic Eugene Ives had more success with his similar &quot;parallax stereogram&quot; since 1901. He also patented the technique for a &quot;Changeable sign, picture, &amp;c.&quot; in 1903, which showed different pictures from different angles (instead of one stereoscopic image from the right angle and distance). Léon Gaumont introduced Ives&#x27; pictures in France and encouraged Eugène Estanave to work on the technique. Estanave patented a barrier grid technique for animated autostereograms. Animated portrait photographs with line sheets were marketed for a while, mostly in the 1910s and 1920s. In the US &quot;Magic Moving Picture&quot; postcards with simple 3 phase animation or changing pictures were marketed after 1906. Maurice Bonnett improved barrier grid autostereography in the 1930s with his relièphographie technique and scanning cameras.

On 11 April 1898 John Jacobson filed an application for US patent No. 624,043 (granted 2 May 1899) for a &quot;Stereograph&quot; of an interlaced stereoscopic picture and &quot;a transparent mount for said picture having a corrugated or channeled surface&quot;. The corrugated lines or channels were not yet really lenticular, but this is the first known autostereogram that used a corrugated transparent surface rather than the opaque lines of most barrier grid stereograms.

===Gabriel Lippmann&#x27;s integral photography===

French Nobel Prize winning physicist Gabriel Lippmann represented Eugène Estanave at several presentations of Estanave&#x27;s works at the French Academy of Sciences. On 2 March 1908 Lippmann presented his own ideas for &quot;photographie intégrale&quot;, based on insect eyes. He suggested to use a screen of tiny lenses. Spherical segments should be pressed into a sort of film with photographic emulsion on the other side. The screen would be placed inside a lightproof holder and on a tripod for stability. When exposed each tiny lens would function as a camera and record the surroundings from a slightly different angle than neighboring lenses. When developed and lit from behind the lenses should project the life-size image of the recorded subject in space. He could not yet present concrete results in March 1908, but by the end of 1908 he claimed to have exposed some Integral photography plates and to have seen the &quot;resulting single, full-sized image&quot;. However, the technique remained experimental since no material or technique seemed to deliver the optical quality desired. At the time of his death in 1921 Lippmann reportedly had a system with only twelve lenses.

===Early lenticular methods===
On 11 April 1898, John Jacobson filed an application for US patent No. 624,043 (granted 2 May 1899) for a &quot;Stereograph&quot; of an interlaced stereoscopic picture and &quot;a transparent mount for said picture having a corrugated or channeled surface&quot;.

In 1912, Louis Chéron described in his French patent 443,216 a screen with long vertical lenses that would be sufficient for recording &quot;stereoscopic depth and the shifting of the relations of objects to each other as the viewer moved&quot;, while he suggested pinholes for integral photography.

In June 1912, Swiss Nobel Prize winning physiologist Walter Rudolf Hess applied for a US patent for a &quot;Stereoscopic picture&quot; with a &quot;celluloid covering having a surface composed of cylindrical lens elements&quot;. US patent 1,128,979 (published 16 February 1915) was one of several patents in different countries he would register for this technique. The company Stereo-Photographie A.G., registered in Zürich in 1914 and 1915, would produce pictures on transparencies through Hess&#x27; process. Few examples of these pictures are still known to have survived. They are circa 3 1/6 × 4 inches black and white pictures (with discolored or intentional hues) and labeled on their passe-partouts &quot;Stereo-Photo nach W.R. Hess - Stereo-Photographie A.G. Zürich. Patente: &quot;Schweiz / Deutschland / Frankreich / Italien / England / Oesterreich / Vereinigte Staaten angemeldet&quot;. The Société française de photographie has three lenticular &quot;Stereo-photo&quot; plates in their collection, three more were on auction in 2017.

Herbert E. Ives, son of Frederic Eugene Ives, was one of several researchers who worked on lenticular sheets in the 1920s. These were basically simpler versions of Lippmann&#x27;s integral photography and had a linear array of small plano-convex cylindrical lenses (lenticules).

The first successful commercial application of the lenticular technique was not used for 3D or motion display but for color movies. Eastman Kodak&#x27;s 1928 Kodacolor film was based on Keller-Dorian cinematography. It used 16 mm black and white sensitive film embossed with 600 lenses per square inch for use with a filter with RGB stripes. In the 1930s several US patents relating to lenticular techniques were granted, mostly for color film.

On 15 December 1936, Douglas F. Winnek Coffey was granted US patent 2,063,985 (application 24 May 1935) for an &quot;Apparatus for making a composite stereograph&quot;. The description does not include changing pictures or animation concepts.

===Further history===
During World War II, research for military purposes was done into 3D imaging, including lenticular technologies. Mass production of plastics and the technique of injection moulding came about around the same period and enabled commercially viable production of lenticular sheets for novelty toys and advertisements.

====Victor Anderson and Vari-Vue====
Victor G. Anderson worked for the Sperry Corporation during World War II where 3D imaging was used for military instructional products, for instance on how to use a bomb sight. After the war Anderson started his company &quot;Pictorial Productions Inc&quot;. A patent application for a &quot;Process in the assembling of changeable picture display devices&quot; was filed on 1 March 1952 and granted on 3 December 1957 (US patent 2,815,310. Anderson stated in 1996 that the company&#x27;s first product was the &quot;I Like Ike&quot; button. The presidential campaign button&#x27;s image changed from the slogan &quot;I Like Ike&quot; (in black letters on white) into a black and white picture of Ike Eisenhower when viewed from different angles. It was copyrighted on 14 May 1952. In December 1953 the company registered their trademark &quot;Vari-Vue.&quot; Vari-Vue further popularized lenticular images during the 1950s and 1960s. By the late sixties, the company marketed about two thousand stock products including moving pattern and color sheets, large images (many religious), billboards, and novelty toys. The company went bankrupt in 1986.

====Xograph====
&quot;Look&quot; magazine of 25 February 1964 introduced the publisher&#x27;s &quot;parallax panoramagram&quot; technology with 8 million copies of a 10x12 cm black and white card with a photographic 3D image of an Edison bust surrounded by some inventions. A 10 x 12 cm full color picture of a model promoting Kodel followed on 7 April. The technique was soon trademarked as &quot;xograph&quot; by Cowles&#x27; daughter company Visual Panographics Inc. Magazines like &quot;Look&quot; and &quot;Venture&quot; published xographs until the mid-1970s. Some baseball cards were produced as xographs. Images produced by the company ranged from just a few millimeters (0.1 inch) to .

====Other early companies====
In the 1960s, more companies manufactured lenticular products, including Hallmark Cards (registering the &quot;Magic Motion&quot; trademark in 1964), Reflexa (Nürnberg, Germany), Toppan (Tokyo, Japan) and Dai-Nippon (Japan).

OptiGraphics Corporation of Grand Prairie, Texas was formed in 1970 and—under the guidance of Victor Anderson, working well into his 80s. The company trademarked &quot;Magic Motion&quot; in 1976. Optigraphics produced the lenticular prizes for Cracker Jack in the 1980s, 7-Eleven Slurpee lenticular sports coins from 1983 to 1987, and in 1986 it produced the first set of 3D traditional baseball cards marketed as Sportflics, which ultimately led to the creation of Pinnacle Brands. In 1999 Performance Companies bought OptiGraphics after Pinnacle Trading Card Company went bankrupt in 1998.

While lenticular images were popular in the 1960s and 1970s, by the 1980s OptiGraphics was the only significant manufacturer remaining in the US.

====21st century====
The techniques for lenticular printing were further improved in the 21st century. Lenticular full motion video effects or &quot;motion print&quot; enabled viewing of up to 60 video frames within a print.

==Common and notable products==
===Political campaign and pop star &quot;flasher&quot; badges===
After their first presidential campaign badge &quot;I like Ike&quot; in 1952, Pictorial Productions Inc. made many more similar political campaign buttons, including presidential campaign badge like &quot;Don&#x27;t blame me!I voted democratic&quot; (1956), &quot;John F. KennedyThe Man for the 60s&quot; (1960), &quot;I Like Ben&quot; (1963) and &quot;I&#x27;m for Nixon&quot; (1968?).

Official &quot;flasher&quot; badges for pop stars like Elvis Presley were manufactured by Vari-Vue at least since 1956, including badges for Beatles, Rolling Stones&#x27; and other bands in the 1960s.

===Cheerios and Cracker Jack prizes===
Pictorial Productions/Vari-Vue produced small animated picture cards for Cheerios in the 1950s, of which founder Victor Anderson claimed to have produced 40 million. He also stated that the cards were originally stuck to the outside of the packaging and were put inside the boxes only after too many cards were stolen before the boxes reached the store shelves.

Many different lenticular &quot;tilt cards&quot; were produced as prizes in Cracker Jack boxes. These were first produced by Vari-Vue (1950s-1970s), later by Toppan Printing, Ltd. (1980s), and Optigraphics Corporation (1980s-1990s).

===Novelty toys===
In 1958 Victor Anderson patented an &quot;Ocular Toy&quot;: an eye glass mount with lenticular winking eyes.

Lenticular images were used in many small and cheap plastic toys, often as gumball machine prizes. These include: miniature toy televisions with an animated lenticular screen, charms in the shape of animals with lenticular faces, &quot;flicker rings&quot;, etc.

In 1960 Takara&#x27;s Dakkochana little plastic golliwog toy with lenticular eyesoriginally intended for toddlers, became popular with Japanese teenagers as a fashion accessory worn around the arm.

===Postcards===
Around 1966 several companies started producing lenticular postcards. Common themes are winking girls, religious scenes, animals, dioramas with dolls, touristic sites and pin-up models wearing clothes when viewed from one angle and nude when viewed from another angle.

===Covers for books, music albums and movies===
The lenticular picture on the album cover for the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1967 LP &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; was manufactured by Vari-Vue, as well as the postcards and other promotional items that accompanied the release. Other lenticular LP covers include Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;The Holy Land&quot; (1969) and The Stranglers&#x27; &quot;The Raven&quot; (1979).
In the 2010s lenticular covers for LPs became a bit more common, especially for deluxe re-releases.
In 1973, the band Saturnalia had lenticular labels on their &quot;Magical Love&quot; picture disc LP.

From around the mid-1990s some lenticular CD covers were produced (mostly for limited editions), including Pet Shop Boys&#x27; &quot;Alternative&quot; (1995) with an image of Chris changing into Neil, the Supersuckers&#x27; &quot;The Sacrilicious Sounds of the Supersuckers&quot; (1995), Download&#x27;s &quot;Furnace&quot; album (1995) and &quot;Microscopic&quot; EP (1996), Tool&#x27;s &quot;Ænima&quot; (1996), The Wildhearts&#x27; &quot;Fishing for Luckies&quot; (1996), Kylie Minogue&#x27;s &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; (1997), the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;Loaded&quot; 2CD version (1997), Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;Expo 2000&quot; (1999) and David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Hours&quot; (1999). Ministry&#x27;s &quot;The Last Sucker&quot; album (2007) had an image of George W. Bush changing into a monstrous, alien-like face. In 1996, alternative rock band Garbage produced a lenticular covered 7&quot; vinyl for their &quot;Milk&quot; single release. 

In the 2010s, lenticular covers for movies on DVD and Blu-ray became quite common.

Lenticular covers have also been used as a collectible cover variant for comic books since the 1990s; Marvel, DC, and other publishers have created such covers with animated or 3D effects.

===Lentograph===
In August 1967 the trademark &quot;Lentograph&quot; was filed by Victor Anderson 3D Studios, Inc. (registered in October 1968). Lentographs were marketed as relatively large lenticular plates (16 x 12 inches / 12 × 8 inches), often found in an illuminated brass frame. Commonly found are 3D pictures of Paul Cunningham&#x27;s biblical displays with sculpted figurines in dramatic poses based on paintings (Plate 501–508), a family of teddy bears in a domestic scene, &quot;Plate No. 106 Evening Flowers&quot;, &quot;Plate No. 115 Goldilocks and 3 bears&quot;, &quot;Plate No. 124 Bijou&quot; (a white poodle), &quot;Plate No. 121 Midday Respite&quot; (a taxidermied young deer in a forest setting), &quot;Plate No. 213 Red Riding Hood&quot;. Also known are a harbor scene (Plate No. 114), &quot;Plate No. 118 Japanese Floral&quot;, &quot;Plate No. 123 Faustus&quot; (a yorky dog) and Plate No. 212 of a covered bridge.

===Lenticular postage stamps===
In 1967 Bhutan introduced lenticular 3D postage stamps as one of the many unusual stamp designs of the Bhutan Stamp Agency initiated by American businessman Burt Kerr Todd. Countries like Ajman, Yemen, Manama, Umm Al Qiwain and North Korea released lenticular stamps in the 1970s. Animated lenticular stamps have been issued since the early 1980s by countries like North Korea.

In 2004 full motion lenticular postage stamps were issued in New Zealand. Over the years many other countries have produced stamps with similar lenticular full motion effects, mostly depicting sport events. In 2010 Communications agency KesselsKramer produced the &quot;Smallest Shortest Film&quot; on a Dutch stamp, directed by Anton Corbijn and featuring actress Carice van Houten.

In 2012, Design Consultancy GBH.London created the UK&#x27;s first &#x27;Motion Stamps&#x27; for Royal Mail&#x27;s Special Stamp Issue, &quot;The Genius of Gerry Anderson&quot;. The minisheet featured four fully lenticular stamps based on Gerry and Sylvia Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; TV series. The Stamps and their background border used 48 frame &#x27;MotionPrint’ technology and were produced by Outer Aspect from New Zealand.

In August 2018 the United States Postal Service introduced &quot;The Art of Magic&quot; lenticular stamp, sold in a souvenir sheet of three. The stamp was designed to celebrate the art of magic and &quot;by rotating each stamp, you can see a white rabbit popping out of a black top hat.&quot;

In August 2019 the United States Postal Service introduced a second stamp with lenticular technology, this time featuring the dinosaur Tyrannosaurus Rex. The USPS explained that &quot;two of the four designs show movement when rotated. See the skeletal remains with and without flesh and watch as an approaching T. rex suddenly lunges forward.&quot;

===Books===
In 2012, Dan Kainen&#x27;s first &quot;photicular&quot; book &quot;Safari&quot; was published, with processed video images animated by having a lens sheet slide by turning the page, much like Rufus Butler Seder&#x27;s &quot;scanimation&quot; process. It was followed by &quot;Ocean&quot; (2014), &quot;Polar&quot; (2015), &quot;Jungle&quot; (2016), &quot;Wild&quot; (2017), &quot;Dinosaur&quot; (2018) and &quot;Outback&quot; (2019).

===Posters===
In 2013, the Spanish ANAR Foundation &quot;(Aid to Children and Adolescents at Risk)&quot; released a lenticular poster with the image of a battered child and in Spanish, &quot;If somebody hurts you, phone us and we&#x27;ll help you,&quot; and a helpline number, visible only from the viewpoint of an average 10-year-old. People over 4&#x27;5&quot; tall see an uninjured face and in Spanish, &quot;Sometimes, child abuse is visible only to the child suffering it.&quot; The organisation claimed that an accompanying adult may dissuade an abused child from seeking help if the hidden message could be seen by the adult.

==Related techniques==
A related product, produced by a small company in New Jersey, was Rowlux. Unlike the Vari-Vue product, Rowlux used a microprismatic lens structure made by a process they patented in 1972, and no paper print. Instead, the plastic (polycarbonate, flexible PVC and later PETG) was dyed with translucent colors, and the film was usually thin and flexible (from 0.002&quot; or in thickness).

While not a true lenticular process, the Dufex Process (manufactured by F.J. Warren Ltd.) does use a form of lens structure to animate the image. The process consists of imprinting a metallic foil with an image. The foil is then laminated onto a thin sheet of card stock that has been coated with a thick layer of wax. The heated lamination press has the Dufex embossing plate on its upper platen, which has been engraved with &#x27;lenses&#x27; at different angles, designed to match the artwork and reflect light at different intensities depending on angle of view.

== Lenticular cinema and television ==
Since at least the early 1930s many researchers have tried to develop lenticular cinema. Herbert E. Ives presented an apparatus on 31 October 1930 with small autostereoscopic motion pictures viewable only by small groups at a time. Ives would continue to improve his system over the years. However, producing autostereoscopic movies was deemed too costly for commercial purposes. A November 1931 &quot;New York Times&quot; article entitled &quot;New screens gives depth to movies&quot; describes a lenticular system by Douglas F. Winnek and also mentions an optical appliance fitted near the screen by South African astronomer R.T.A. Innes.

Lenticular arrays have also been used for 3D autostereoscopic television, which produces the illusion of 3D vision without the use of special glasses. At least as early as 1954 patents for lenticular television were filed, but it lasted until 2010 before a range of 3D televisions became available. Some of these systems used cylindrical lenses slanted from the vertical, or spherical lenses arranged in a honeycomb pattern, to provide a better resolution. While over 40 million 3D televisions were sold in 2012 (including systems that required glasses), by 2016 3D content became rare and manufacturers had stopped producing 3D TV sets. While the need to wear glasses for the more affordable systems seemed to have been a letdown for customers, affordable autostereoscopic televisions were seen as a future solution.

==Manufacturing process==

===Printing===
Lenticular front sheeting and image-processing software are both sold for home computer printing, where the interlaced image backing is inkjet printed in photo resolution and affixed behind the lenticular sheet.

Creation of lenticular images on a commercial scale requires printing presses that are adapted to print on sensitive thermoplastic materials. Lithographic offset printing is typically used, to ensure the images are good quality. Printing presses for lenticulars must be capable of adjusting image placement in steps, to allow good alignment of the image to the lens array.

Typically, ultraviolet-cured inks are used. These dry quickly by direct conversion of the liquid ink to a solid form, rather than by evaporation of liquid solvents from a mixture. Powerful () ultraviolet (UV) lamps have been used to rapidly cure the ink. This allowed lenticular images to be printed at high speed.

In some cases, electron beam lithography has been used instead. The curing of the ink was then initiated directly by an electron beam scanned across the surface.

===Defects===

====Design defects====

;Double images on the relief and in depth:
Double images are usually caused by an exaggeration of the 3D effect from some angles of view, or an insufficient number of frames. Poor design can lead to doubling, small jumps, or a fuzzy image, especially on objects in relief or in depth. For some visuals, where the foreground and background are fuzzy or shaded, this exaggeration can prove to be an advantage. In most cases, the detail and precision required do not allow this.

;Image ghosting:
Ghosting occurs due to poor treatment of the source images, and also due to transitions where demand for an effect goes beyond the limits and technical possibilities of the system. This causes some of the images to remain visible when they should disappear. These effects can depend on the lighting of the lenticular print.

====Prepress defects====
;Synchronization of the print (master) with the pitch:
This effect is also known as &quot;banding&quot;. Poor calibration of the material can cause the passage from one image to another to not be simultaneous over the entire print. The image transition progresses from one side of the print to the other, giving the impression of a veil or curtain crossing the visual. This phenomenon is felt less for the 3D effects, but is manifested by a jump of the transverse image. In some cases, the transition starts in several places and progresses from each starting point toward the next, giving the impression of several curtains crossing the visual, as described above.

;Discordant harmonics:
This phenomenon is unfortunately common, and is explained either by incorrect calibration of the support or by incorrect parametrization of the prepress operations.
It is manifested in particular by streaks that appear parallel to the lenticules during transitions from one visual to the other.

====Printing defects====
;Color synchronization
One of the main difficulties in lenticular printing is color synchronization. The causes are varied, they may come from a malleable material, incorrect printing conditions and adjustments, or again a dimensional differential of the engraving of the offset plates in each color.

This poor marking is shown by doubling of the visual; a lack of clarity; a streak of color or wavy colors (especially for four-color shades) during a change of phase by inclination of the visual.

;Synchronization of parallelism of the printing to the lenticules
The origin of this problem is a fault in the printing and forcibly generates a phase defect.
The passage from one visual to another must be simultaneous over the entire format. But when this problem occurs, there is a lag in the effects on the diagonals. At the end of one diagonal of the visual, there is one effect, and at the other end, there is another.

;Phasing
In most cases, the phasing problem comes from imprecise cutting of the material, as explained below. Nevertheless, poor printing and rectification conditions may also be behind it.

In theory, for a given angle of observation, one and the same visual must appear, for the entire batch. As a general rule, the angle of vision is around 45°, and this angle must be in agreement with the sequence provided by the master. If the images have a tendency to double perpendicularly (for 3D) or if the images provided for observation to the left appear to the right (top/bottom), then there is a phasing problem.

====Cutting defects====
Defects, in the way the lenticular lens has been cut, can lead to phase errors between the lens and the image.

Two examples, taken from the same production batch:
The first image shows a cut that removed about 150 μm of the first lens, and that shows irregular cutting of the lenticular lenses. The second image shows a cut that removed about 30 μm of the first lens. Defects in cutting such as these lead to a serious phase problem. In the printing press the image being printed is aligned relative to the edges of the sheet of material. If the sheet is not always cut in the same place relative to the first lenticule, a phase error is introduced between the lenses and the image slices.

<text>Non-standard poker hands are hands which are not recognized by official poker rules but are made by house rules. Non-standard hands usually appear in games using wild cards or bugs. Other terms for nonstandard hands are special hands or freak hands. Because the hands are defined by house rules, the composition and ranking of these hands is subject to variation. Any player participating in a game with non-standard hands should be sure to determine the exact rules of the game before play begins.

==Types==
The usual hierarchy of poker hands from highest to lowest runs as follows (standard poker hands are in &quot;italics&quot;):

* &quot;Royal Flush&quot;: The highest straight flush, A-K-Q-J-10 suited.
* Skeet flush: The same cards as a skeet (see below) but all in the same suit.
* Straight Flush House: Same as Flush House (see below), but all cards are in consecutive order.
* Flush House: A Full House (see below) where all the cards are of the same suit.
* &quot;Straight flush&quot;: When wild cards are used, a wild card becomes whichever card is necessary to complete the straight flush, or the higher of the two cards that can complete an open-ended straight flush. For example, in the hand 10♠ 9♠ (Wild) 7♠ 6♠, it becomes the 8♠, and in the hand (Wild) Q♦ J♦ 10♦ 9♦, it plays as the K♦ (even though the 8♦ would also make a straight flush).
* &quot;Four of a kind&quot;: Between two equal sets of four of a kind (possible in wild card and community card poker games or with multiple or extended decks), the kicker determines the winner.
* Big bobtail: A four-card straight flush (four cards of the same suit in consecutive order).
* &quot;Full house&quot;
* &quot;Flush&quot;: When wild cards are used, a wild card contained in a flush is considered to be of the highest rank not already present in the hand. For example, in the hand (Wild) 10♥ 8♥ 5♥ 4♥, the wild card plays as the A♥, but in the hand A♣ K♣ (Wild) 9♣ 6♣, it plays as the Q♣. (As noted above, if a wild card would complete a straight flush, it will play as the card that would make the highest possible hand.) A variation is the &quot;double-ace flush rule&quot;, in which a wild card in a flush always plays as an ace, even if one is already present (unless the wild card would complete a straight flush). In such a game, the hand A♠ (Wild) 9♠ 5♠ 2♠ would defeat A♦ K♦ Q♦ 10♦ 8♦ (the wild card playing as an imaginary second A♠), whereas by the standard rules it would lose (because even with the wild card playing as a K♠, the latter hand&#x27;s Q♦ outranks the former&#x27;s 9♠).

* Big cat: See cats and dogs below.
* Little cat: See cats and dogs below.
* Big dog: See cats and dogs below.
* Little dog: See cats and dogs below.
* &quot;Straight&quot;: When wild cards are used, the wild card becomes whichever rank is necessary to complete the straight. If two different ranks would complete a straight, it becomes the higher. For example, in the hand J♦ 10♠ 9♣ (Wild) 7♠, the wild card plays as an 8 (of any suit; it doesn&#x27;t matter). In the hand (Wild) 6♥ 5♦ 4♥ 3♦, it plays as a 7 (even though a 2 would also make a straight).
* Wrap-around straight: Also called a round-the-corner straight, consecutive cards including an ace which counts as both the high and low card. (Example Q-K-A-2-3).
* Skip straight: Also called alternate straight, Dutch straight, skipper, or kangaroo straight, Cards are in consecutive order, skipping every second rank (example 3-5-7-9-J).
* Five and dime: 5-low, 10-high, with no pair (example 5-6-7-8-10).
* Skeet: Also called pelter or bracket, a hand with a deuce (2), a 5, and a 9, plus two other un-paired cards lower than 9 (example 2-4-5-6-9).
* &quot;Three of a kind&quot;
* Little bobtail: A three-card straight flush (three cards of the same suit in consecutive order).
* Flash: One card of each suit plus a joker.
* Blaze: Also called blazer, all cards are jacks, queens, and/or kings.
* &quot;Two pair&quot;: any two pair of the same cards regardless of suit.
* Bobtail flush: Also called four flush, Four cards of the same suit.
* Bobtail straight: Also called four straight, four cards in consecutive order.
* &quot;One pair&quot;: any pair of the same cards regardless of suit.
* &quot;High card&quot;: any five cards of sequential rank or non-sequential rank regardless of suit such as A-K-Q-T-9, or T-9-7-6-4.
Some poker games are played with a deck that has been stripped of certain cards, usually low-ranking ones. For example, the Australian game of Manila uses a 32-card deck in which all cards below the rank of 7 are removed, and Mexican Stud removes the 8s, 9s, and 10s. In both of these games, a flush ranks above a full house, because having fewer cards of each suit available makes full houses more common.

==Cats and dogs==
&quot;Cats&quot; (or &quot;tigers&quot;) and &quot;dogs&quot; are types of no-pair hands defined by their highest and lowest cards. The remaining three cards are kickers. Dogs and cats rank above straights and below Straight Flush houses. Usually, when cats and dogs are played, they are the only unconventional hands allowed.

* Little dog: Seven high, two low (for example, 7-6-4-3-2). It ranks just above a straight, and below a Straight Flush House or any other cat or dog. In standard poker seven high is the lowest hand possible.
* Big dog: Ace high, nine low (for example, A-K-J-10-9). Ranks above a straight or little dog, and below a Straight Flush House or cat.
* Little cat (or little tiger): Eight high, three low. Ranks above a straight or any dog, but below a Straight Flush House or big cat.
* Big cat (or big tiger): King high, eight low. It ranks just below a Straight Flush House, and above a straight or any other cat or dog.

Some play that dog or cat flushes beat a straight flush, under the reasoning that a plain dog or cat beats a plain straight. This makes the big cat flush the highest hand in the game.

==Kilters==
A Kilter, also called Kelter, is a generic term for a number of different non-standard hands. Depending on house rules, a Kilter may be a Skeet, a Little Cat, a Skip Straight, or some variation of one of these hands. According to Paul Anthony Jones, it can simply mean a hand of little value. According to Penn Jillette and Mickey D. Lynn, a Kelter is &quot;a nonstandard hand given value in home games.&quot;

<text>Engineering notation or engineering form (also technical notation) is a version of scientific notation in which the exponent of ten is always selected to be divisible by three to match the common metric prefixes, i.e. scientific notation that aligns with powers of a thousand, for example, 531×103 instead of 5.31×105 (but on calculator displays written without the ×10 to save space). As an alternative to writing powers of 10, SI prefixes can be used, which also usually provide steps of a factor of a thousand.
On most calculators, engineering notation is called &quot;ENG&quot; mode as scientific notation is denoted SCI.

==History==
An early implementation of engineering notation in the form of range selection and number display with SI prefixes was introduced in the computerized HP 5360A frequency counter by Hewlett-Packard in 1969.

Based on an idea by Peter D. Dickinson the first calculator to support engineering notation displaying the power-of-ten exponent values was the HP-25 in 1975. It was implemented as a dedicated display mode in addition to scientific notation.

In 1975, Commodore introduced a number of scientific calculators (like the SR4148/SR4148R and SR4190R) providing a &quot;variable scientific notation&quot;, where pressing the and keys shifted the exponent and decimal point by ±1 in &quot;scientific&quot; notation. Between 1976 and 1980 the same &quot;exponent shift&quot; facility was also available on some Texas Instruments calculators of the pre-LCD era such as early SR-40, TI-30 and TI-45 model variants utilizing () instead. This can be seen as a precursor to a feature implemented on many Casio calculators since 1978/1979 (e.g. in the FX-501P/FX-502P), where number display in &quot;engineering&quot; notation is available on demand by the single press of a () button (instead of having to activate a dedicated display mode as on most other calculators), and subsequent button presses would shift the exponent and decimal point of the number displayed by ±3 in order to easily let results match a desired prefix. Some graphical calculators (for example the fx-9860G) in the 2000s also support the display of some SI prefixes (f, p, n, μ, m, k, M, G, T, P, E) as suffixes in engineering mode.

==Overview==

Compared to normalized scientific notation, one disadvantage of using SI prefixes and engineering notation is that significant figures are not always readily apparent when the smallest significant digit or digits are 0. For example, 500 μm and cannot express the uncertainty distinctions between , , and . This can be solved by changing the range of the coefficient in front of the power from the common 1–1000 to 0.001–1.0. In some cases this may be suitable; in others it may be impractical. In the previous example, 0.5 mm, 0.50 mm, or 0.500 mm would have been used to show uncertainty and significant figures. It is also common to state the precision explicitly, such as &quot;&quot;

Another example: when the speed of light (exactly by the definition of the meter) is expressed as or then it is clear that it is between and , but when using , or , , or the unusual but short , this is not clear. A possibility is using or .

On the other hand, engineering notation allows the numbers to explicitly match their corresponding SI prefixes, which facilitates reading and oral communication. For example, can be read as &quot;twelve-point-five nanometers&quot; (10−9 being &quot;nano&quot;) and written as 12.5 nm, while its scientific notation equivalent would likely be read out as &quot;one-point-two-five times ten-to-the-negative-eight meters&quot;.

Engineering notation, like scientific notation generally, can use the E notation, such that can be written as 3.0E−9 or 3.0e−9. The E (or e) should not be confused with the Euler&#x27;s number e or the symbol for the exa-prefix.

==Binary engineering notation==
Just like decimal engineering notation can be viewed as a base-1000 scientific notation (103 = 1000), binary engineering notation relates to a base-1024 scientific notation (210 = 1024), where the exponent of two must be divisible by ten. This is closely related to the base-2 floating-point representation (B notation) commonly used in computer arithmetic, and the usage of IEC binary prefixes, e.g. 1B10 for 1 × 210, 1B20 for 1 × 220, 1B30 for 1 × 230, 1B40 for 1 × 240 etc.

<doc id="878331" wikidata="Q475802" url="?curid=878331" title="Zaranj">
<text>Zaranj (Persian/Pashto/) is a city in southwestern Afghanistan, which has a population of 160,902 people as of 2015. It is the capital of Nimruz Province and is linked by highways with Lashkargah and Kandahar to the east, Farah to the north and the Iranian city of Zabol to the west.

The Abresham border crossing is located to the west of Zaranj, on the Afghanistan–Iran border. It is one of three important trade-routes that connect Central Asia, East Asia and South Asia with the Middle East. Zaranj Airport is located some to the east of the city.

The history of Zaranj dates back over 2,500 years and Ya&#x27;qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar, founder of the Saffarid dynasty, was born in this old civilization.

== History ==

Modern Zaranj bears the name of an ancient city whose name is also attested in Old Persian as &quot;Zranka&quot;. In Greek, this word became Drangiana. Other historical names for Zaranj include Zirra, Zarangia, Zarani etc. Ultimately, the word Zaranj is derived from the ancient Old Persian word &quot;zaranka&quot; (&quot;waterland&quot;).

Achaemenid Zranka, the capital of Drangiana, was almost certainly located at Dahan-e Gholaman, southeast of Zabol in Iran. After the abandonment of that city, its name, Zarang or Zaranj in later Perso-Arabic orthography, was transferred to the subsequent administrative centers of the region, which itself came to be known as Sakastān, then Sijistan and finally Sistān. Medieval Zaranj is located at Nād-i `Alī, 4.4 km north of the modern city of Zaranj. According to the Arab geographers, prior to medieval Zaranj, the capital of Sistan was located at Ram Shahristan (Abar shariyar). Ram Shahristan had been supplied with water by a canal from the Helmand River, but its dam broke, the area was deprived of water, and the populace moved three days&#x27; march to found Zaranj. This Zaranj appears on the Peutinger Map of late Antiquity.
The area came under Muslim rule in 652, when Zaranj surrendered to the governor of Khurāsān; it subsequently became a base for further caliphal expansion in the region. In 661, a small Arab garrison reestablished its authority in the region after having temporarily lost control due to skirmishes and revolts. A Nestorian Christian community is recorded in Zaranj in the sixth century, and by the end of the eighth century there was a Jacobite diocese of Zaranj. In the 9th century Zaranj was the capital of the Saffarid dynasty, whose founder was the local coppersmith turned warlord, Ya&#x27;qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar. It became part of the Ghaznavids, Ghorids, Trimurids, Safavids and others. Defeated by the Samanids in 900, the Saffarids sank to a position of regional importance, until conquered by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1003. Subsequently, Zaranj served as the capital of the Nasrid (1029–1225) and Mihrabānid (1236–1537) &quot;maliks&quot; of Nīmrūz.

In the early 18th century, the city became part of the Afghan Hotaki dynasty until they were removed from power in 1738 by Nader Shah of Khorasan. Zaranj came under Khanate of Kalat in the mid-18th century. Under the modern Afghan governments, the area was known as Farah-Chakansur Province until 1968, when it was separated to form the provinces of Nimruz and Farah. The city of Zaranj became the capital of Nimroz province.

=== Early 21st century ===

A new highway called Route 606 was built between Zaranj and Delaram in Farah province by the Indian Government&#x27;s Border Roads Organization at a cost of about US$136 million to open up a link between the deep sea port at Chabahar in Iran to Afghanistan&#x27;s main ring road highway system which connects Kabul, Kandahar, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif and Kunduz. The highway, a symbol of India&#x27;s developmental work in the war-ravaged country, was handed over to Afghan authorities by Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee in January 2009 in the presence of Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Foreign Minister Rangeen Dadfar Spanta. &quot;Completion of the road reflects the determination of both India and Afghanistan that nothing can prevent or hinder collaboration between the two countries,&quot; Mukherjee said at a function to mark this handover. On the occasion, Karzai said, the completion of the project is a message to those who want to stop cooperation between India and Afghanistan. &quot;Our cooperation will not stop&quot;. The Taliban was opposed to this project and launched frequent attacks on the construction workers in an attempt to force the winding up of the work. A total of six Indians, including a Border Roads Organisation driver and four ITBP soldiers, and 129 Afghans were killed in these attacks.

The province has been one of the 7 (Nimruz, Helmand, Kandahar, Uruzgan, Ghazni, Paktika and Zabul) where the Taliban have been recently regrouping. On 14 August 2012 dozens of civilians were killed in Zaranj by several suicide-bombers in a major terrorist attack on the city.

Due to Zaranj&#x27;s close proximity to Iran, the city relies mostly on Iranian products. With the increase of trade the Afghan Border Police is dealing with a rise in smuggling, particularly illegal drugs and weapons. The overall economic situation is becoming better for the local population of the city. Hundreds of trucks containing merchandise from the Middle East enter the city on a daily basis.

In the last decade, the U.S. Marines and others of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) have been visiting Zaranj city. The US Marines and other U.S. officials are involved with the Afghan government in major development projects. This includes improvement made to the irrigation network of the city, building of Afghan military and Afghan National Police barracks as well as a hospital and a school.

The city is served by Zaranj Airport, which is also being improved by the United States. US Marines assigned to 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing have been visiting Zaranj since US Marine Base Forward Operating Base Delaram was built in Delaram district of Zaranj. The 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing built two concrete helicopter landing zones on western side of the gravel runway of Zaranj Airport to ease the landing of USMC V-22 Osprey helicopters from 3rd Battalion 4th Marines. The helipads now serve all helicopters landing at Zaranj airport.

=== Taliban capture ===

On 6 August 2021, local sources confirmed that the city had been captured by the Taliban, making it the first provincial capital captured by the Taliban during their advances after the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan. Afghan officials stated the Taliban faced &quot;little resistance&quot; in capturing the city with the 215th Corps of the Afghan National Army focusing instead on the Battle of Lashkargah. Shortly after entering the city, the Taliban broke into the city&#x27;s prison, releasing a large number of prisoners into Zaranj.

On March 8, 2022, the New York Times reported a boom in the business of smugglers helping - for payment - the escape of hundreds of thousands of Afghans seeking to cross into Iran, to escape the Taliban rule and/or the harsh economic conditions. According to the report, &quot;nearly everyone in Zaranj is involved, in one way or another, in the smuggling business&quot;. As described in the paper, &quot;Zaranj is lively. Newcomers buy kebabs from street vendors, peruse shops and sit around plastic tables, eager to learn more about the grueling journey ahead&quot;.

== Climate ==
Zaranj has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;) with very hot summers and cool winters. Precipitation is very low and mostly falls in winter. Temperatures in summer may approach . Snowfall in Zaranj is a rare event. On 27 November 2016, it snowed in this city.
== Demographics ==

According to the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) along with UNHCR and Central Statistics Office (CSO) of Afghanistan, the population of Zaranj was around 49,851 in 2004. The ethnic groups are as follows: Baloch 44%, Pashtun 34% and Tajik 22%.

The city of Zaranj has a population of 160,902 people.

There are 17,878 residential dwellings in Zarat and 1,759 hectares of agricultural land. Commercial land use is clustered on the main road to Iran.

== Notable people ==

==Route 606: Delaram-Zaranj Highway==

The Delaram–Zaranj Highway, also known as Route 606, is a 217-km or 135-mile-long two-lane road built by India in Afghanistan, connecting Delaram in Farah Province with Zaranj in neighbouring Nimruz Province near the Iranian border. It connects the Afghan–Iranian border with the Kandahar–Herat Highway in Delaram, which provides connectivity to other major Afghan cities via A01, including to India&#x27;s planned mining operation in Hajigak mining concession. Route 606 reduces travel time between Delaram and Zaranj from the earlier 12–14 hours to just 2 hours. India-Iran signed an agreement in May 2016 to connect it to Port of Chabahar with rail and road links.

<text>Horace White (October 7, 1865 – November 27, 1943) was an American lawyer and politician from New York. He was the 37th governor of New York from October 6, 1910, to December 31, 1910.

==Life==
He attended Syracuse Central High School, Cornell University (graduated 1887), and Columbia Law School (graduated 1889), and opened the firm of White, Cheney, Shinaman, and O&#x27;Neill in Syracuse, New York, in the late 1880s or early 1890s. While at Cornell he was a member of Kappa Alpha Society.

He was a member of the New York State Senate (36th D. and 38th D.) from 1896 to 1906 and from 1907 to 1908 sitting in the 119th, 120th, 121st, 122nd, 123rd, 124th, 125th, 126th, 127th, 128th, 129th, 130th and 131st New York State Legislatures; and participated in the drawing of the consolidation charter of the City of New York.

He was Lieutenant Governor of New York from 1909 to 1910, elected at the New York state election, 1908 on the Republican ticket with Governor Charles Evans Hughes. Hughes resigned in October 1910 when he was appointed to the United States Supreme Court, and White succeeded to the governorship, remaining in office until the end of the year.

White served as a trustee of Cornell University from 1916 to 1943. White, who was the nephew of Cornell&#x27;s first President, Andrew Dickson White, left three-quarters of his estate to the university, and that fund had grown to $1.5 million by 1973. In White&#x27;s honor, in 1973, Cornell named two professorships after him: the first two Cornell faculty to become Horace White Professors were Michael Fisher and Jack Kiefer. He was also active in Syracuse, serving as president of the Post-Standard Company and participating in numerous other civil, social, and business organizations.

White once owned Fox Island in the east of Lake Ontario, located in the Town of Cape Vincent.

White was the last governor to come from Western New York until Kathy Hochul became Governor after the resignation of Andrew Cuomo in 2021.

He was buried at Oakwood Rural Cemetery in Syracuse, New York.

<text>Coimbra Fado (Portuguese: &quot;Fado de Coimbra&quot;) is a genre of fado originating in the city of Coimbra, Portugal. While adopted by students at the University of Coimbra, and sometimes known as Student Fado (&quot;Fado de Estudante&quot;), it is usually considered the typical music of Coimbra itself. Developed from the Iberian lyric style of trovadorismo popular during the Middle Ages, the genre shares roots with Occitan troubadors.

Performed with the traditional &quot;Guitarra de Coimbra&quot; (a kind of Portuguese guitar originating in Coimbra), a modified version of Lisbon&#x27;s fado guitar allegedly created by Artur Paredes, it is usually accompanied by classic acoustic guitar and male voices.

Guitarists Artur Paredes and his son Carlos Paredes are considered the pioneers and masters of this musical genre. Among its most renowned singers were Edmundo Bettencourt and António Menano, in the 1930s and 1940s, and José Afonso, Adriano Correia de Oliveira, Luís Goes and João Maria Tudela, in the 1950s and 1960s, the two so called &quot;golden ages&quot; of the genre. Other noted names in the genre include Loubet Bravo and Fernando Machado Soares.

The Coimbra Academic Association (Associação Académica de Coimbra) has a fado section, teaching the genre to musically inclined students and promoting musical projects and events related to it. Its fame throughout Portugal has led to the creation of similar structures in other cities, such as Lisbon and Porto, where there are also &quot;Fado de Coimbra&quot; groups organized by students and local people.

<doc id="878340" wikidata="Q422618" url="?curid=878340" title="Ritonavir">
<text>Ritonavir, sold under the brand name Norvir, is an antiretroviral medication used along with other medications to treat HIV/AIDS. This combination treatment is known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor, though it now mainly serves to boost the potency of other protease inhibitors. It may also be used in combination with other medications to treat hepatitis C and COVID-19. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects of ritonavir include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and numbness of the hands and feet. Serious side effects include liver complications, pancreatitis, allergic reactions, and arrhythmias. Serious interactions may occur with a number of other medications including amiodarone and simvastatin. At low doses, it is considered to be acceptable for use during pregnancy. Ritonavir is of the protease inhibitor class. However, it is also commonly used to inhibit the enzyme that metabolizes other protease inhibitors. This inhibition allows lower doses of these latter medications to be used.
Ritonavir was patented in 1989 and came into medical use in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Ritonavir capsules were approved as a generic medication in the United States in 2020.

==Medical uses==
===HIV===
Ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1-infected patients. Though initially developed as an independent antiviral treatment, it is most commonly used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, in order to increase the plasma concentrations of other antiretrovirals. Ritonavir is effective in preventing the replication of HIV-1. Protease inhibitors, including ritonavir, effectively block HIV-1 protease, a crucial enzyme in the reproductive cycle of HIV-1.

===COVID-19===
Two SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors are prepackaged with ritonavir to enhance their blood concentration.

In December 2021, the combination of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir was granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of coronavirus disease COVID-19. The co-packaged medications are sold under the brand name Paxlovid. Paxlovid is not authorized for the pre-exposure or post-exposure prevention of COVID-19 or for initiation of treatment in those requiring hospitalization due to severe or critical COVID-19. On December 31, 2021, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approved the same combination &quot;for people with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19&quot;.

In January 2023, simnotrelvir/ritonavir was conditionally approved by China&#x27;s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for COVID-19.

=== Other uses ===
The use of ritonavir as a CYP3A inhibitor is also seen in the Hepatitis C medication ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir.

==Side effects==
When administered at the initially tested higher doses effective for anti-HIV therapy, the side effects of ritonavir are those shown below.
* Asthenia, malaise
* Diarrhea
* Nausea and vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Kidney failure
* Sweating
* Taste abnormality
* Metabolic effects, including
** Hypercholesterolemia
** Hypertriglyceridemia
** Elevated transaminases
** Elevated creatine kinase
===Adverse drug reactions===
Ritonavir exhibits hepatic activity. It induces CYP1A2 and inhibits CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant therapy of ritonavir with a variety of medications may result in serious and sometimes fatal drug interactions.

Due to it being a strong inhibitor (that causes at least a five-fold increase in the plasma AUC values, or more than 80% decrease in clearance) of both cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, ritonavir can severely potentiate and prolong the half-life and/or increase the blood concentration of phenobarbital, primidone, carbamazepine, phenytoin, PDE5 inhibitors like sildenafil, opioids such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, pethidine and fentanyl, antiarrhythmic agents such as amiodarone, propafenone and disopyramide, immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus, voclosporin and sirolimus, neuroleptics like lurasidone and pimozide, as well as some chemotherapeutic agents, benzodiazepines and some ergot derivatives. The FDA has issued a boxed warning for this type of drug interactions.

CYP3A4 inducers can counteract the inhibiting effects of ritonavir and lead to drastically reduced levels of &quot;boosted&quot; drugs, increasing the risk of developing drug resistance. Other CYP3A4 inhibitors may have an additive effect with ritonavir, causing increased drug levels.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Ritonavir was originally developed as an inhibitor of HIV protease, one of a family of pseudo-&quot;C&quot;-symmetric small molecule inhibitors.

Ritonavir is rarely used for its own antiviral activity but remains widely used as a booster of other protease inhibitors. More specifically, ritonavir is used to inhibit a particular enzyme, in intestines, liver, and elsewhere, that normally metabolizes protease inhibitors, cytochrome P450-3A4 (CYP3A4). The drug binds to and inhibits CYP3A4, so a low dose can be used to enhance other protease inhibitors. This discovery drastically reduced the adverse effects and improved the efficacy of protease inhibitors and HAART.. However, because of the general role of CYP3A4 in xenobiotic metabolism, dosing with ritonavir also affects the efficacy of numerous other medications, adding to the challenge of prescribing drugs concurrently. See above.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Ritonavir at a 200 mg dose reaches maximum plasma concentration in about 3 hours and has a half life of 3–4 hours. Importantly, the pharmacokinetics of Ritonavir are not linear—the half life increases at higher doses or under repeated dosing. For instance, the half life of a 500 mg tablet is 4–6 hours rather than 3–4 hours for a 200 mg tablet. The drug has high bioavailability but about 20% is lost due to first-pass metabolism. Rivonavir capsules are not absorbed as quickly as Ritonavir tablets and may exhibit different bioavailability.

Ritonavir was demonstrated to have an &quot;in vitro&quot; potency of EC50=0.02 μM on HIV-1 protease and highly sustained concentration in plasma after oral administration in several species.

==Chemistry==
Ritonavir was initially derived from a moderately potent and orally bioavailable small molecule, A-80987. The P3 and P2′ heterocyclic groups of A-80987 were redesigned to create an analogue, now known as ritonavir, with improved pharmacokinetic properties to the original.

Full details of the synthesis of ritonavir were first published by scientists from Abbott Laboratories.

In the first step shown, an aldehyde derived from phenylalanine is treated with zinc dust in the presence of vanadium(III) chloride. This results in a pinacol coupling reaction which dimerizes the material to provide an intermediate which is converted to its epoxide and then reduced to (2S,3S,5S)-2,5-diamino-1,6-diphenylhexan-3-ol. Importantly, this retains the absolute stereochemistry of the amino acid precursor. The diamine is then treated sequentially with two thiazole derivatives, each linked by an amide bond, to provide ritonavir.

==History==
Ritonavir is sold as Norvir by AbbVie, Inc. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ritonavir on March 1, 1996, As a result of the introduction of &quot;highly active antiretroviral thearap[ies]&quot; the annual U.S. HIV-associated death rate fell from over 50,000 to about 18,000 over a period of two years.

In 2014, the FDA approved a combination of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4.

After the start of the COVID pandemic in 2020, many antivirals, including protease inhibitors in general and ritonavir in particular, were repurposed in an effort to treat the new infection. Lopinavir/ritonavir was found not to work in severe COVID-19. Virtual screening followed by molecular dynamics analysis predicted ritonavir blocks the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor, which is critical for the virus entry into human cells.

Finally in 2021, a combination of ritonavir with nirmatrelvir, a newly developed orally active 3C-like protease inhibitor, was developed for the treatment of COVID-19. Ritonavir serves to slow down metabolism of nirmatrelvir by cytochrome enzymes to maintain higher circulating concentrations of the main drug. In November that year, Pfizer announced positive phase 2/3 results, including 89% reduction in hospitalizations when given within three days after symptom onset.

==Polymorphism and temporary market withdrawal==
Ritonavir was originally dispensed as a capsule that did not require refrigeration. This contained a crystal form of ritonavir that is now called form I. However, like many drugs, crystalline ritonavir can exhibit polymorphism, i.e., the same molecule can crystallize into more than one crystal type, or polymorph, each of which contains the same repeating molecule but in different crystal packings/arrangements. The solubility and hence the bioavailability can vary in the different arrangements, and this was observed for forms I and II of ritonavir.

During development—ritonavir was introduced in 1996—only the crystal form now called form I was found; however, in 1998, a lower free energy, more stable polymorph, form II, was discovered. This more stable crystal form was less soluble, which resulted in significantly lower bioavailability. The compromised oral bioavailability of the drug led to temporary removal of the oral capsule formulation from the market. As a consequence of the fact that even a trace amount of form II can result in the conversion of the more bioavailable form I into form II, the presence of form II threatened the ruin of existing supplies of the oral capsule formulation of ritonavir; and indeed, form II was found in production lines, effectively halting ritonavir production. Abbott (now AbbVie) withdrew the capsules from the market, and prescribing physicians were encouraged to switch to a Norvir suspension. It has been estimated that Abbott lost more than US$250 million as a result, and the incident is often cited as a high-profile example of disappearing polymorphs.

The company&#x27;s research and development teams ultimately solved the problem by replacing the capsule formulation with a refrigerated gelcap. In 2000, Abbott (now AbbVie) received FDA-approval for a tablet formulation of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) which contained a preparation of ritonavir that did not require refrigeration. Ritonavir tablets produced in a solid dispersion by melt-extrusion was found to remain in form I, and was re-introduced commercially in 2010.

==Society and culture==
===Economics===
In 2003, Abbott (AbbVie, Inc.) raised the price of a Norvir course from per day to per day, leading to claims of price gouging by patients&#x27; groups and some members of Congress. Consumer group Essential Inventions petitioned the NIH to override the Norvir patent, but the NIH announced on August 4, 2004, that it lacked the legal right to allow generic production of Norvir.

<text>General elections were held in the Netherlands on 15 May 1963. The Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP) remained the largest party, winning 50 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives.

The elections led to a four-party coalition government initially consisting of the KVP, People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy, Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) and Christian Historical Union. In 1965 this coalition was replaced by one consisting of the KVP, Labour Party and ARP.

<doc id="878352" wikidata="Q6662750" url="?curid=878352" title="Lloyd Stinson">
<text>Lloyd Cleworth Stinson (February 29, 1904 – August 28, 1976) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada, and the leader of that province&#x27;s Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) from 1953 to 1959. Although widely regarded as a capable leader, he was unable to achieve a major electoral breakthrough for his party.

Stinson was born in Treherne, Manitoba, and received education there and in Winnipeg. He graduated from Theology United College in 1933, and was ordained as a United Church minister. He received his B.D. in 1935, and took post-graduate courses in history and political science in 1940 and 1941.

Stinson stepped down as an active minister in 1942, and become Provincial Secretary for the provincial CCF the following year. He edited the &quot;Manitoba Commonwealth&quot; newspaper from 1943 to 1946, and served as a Winnipeg alderman from 1943 to 1944.

Unusually for a social democrat, Stinson&#x27;s base was in the southern part of Winnipeg (after the General Strike of 1919, the north end generally elected socialist and labour candidates while the south supported pro-business figures). Stinson was defeated in Winnipeg South Centre in the federal election of 1945, though coming a respectable second to the victorious Liberal candidate. Later in the year, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as one of ten members for the city of Winnipeg. (Winnipeg elections were determined by prefential balloting, with the entire city as one constituency). Stinson placed second among the CCF candidates, trailing only party leader Seymour Farmer.

The electoral map was redrawn in 1949, with Winnipeg divided into three ridings (each of which elected four members). Stinson was the only CCF candidate elected in Winnipeg South that year; he came very close to outpolling longtime Liberal-Progressive cabinet minister John Stewart McDiarmid for first position on the first count. The larger election picture was disappointing for the CCF, with the party winning only seven of 57 seats.

Stinson became one of the leading CCF figures in the legislative, often outshining party leader Edwin Hansford. Hansford resigned as CCF house leader in 1952, and Stinson was chosen to replace him on December 19, 1952. He was acclaimed as the official party leader on April 25, 1953, by the CCF council, and was subsequently confirmed without opposition by a provincial convention.

Stinson was a capable politician, and had the ability to reach out to centre-left voters previously alienated from the CCF. He was also a skilled networker, soliciting support from Saskatchewan Premier Tommy Douglas in designing his election platform.

He could not, however, bring the CCF above third-party status in the election of 1953. The Liberal-Conservative coalition which governed the province from 1940 to 1950 had dissolved, and most of the electorate was polarized between these two parties. The Liberal-Progressives (or Liberals) won 32 seats and a majority; the CCF were reduced to only five. Stinson fell to third place on Winnipeg South&#x27;s first count, and had to wait for a later count to be re-elected.

The Liberal-Progressive government of Douglas Campbell grew unpopular between 1953 and 1958, and the CCF made some gains at Campbell&#x27;s expense. They climbed to eleven seats in the 1958 election, and Stinson was elected in the new Winnipeg riding of Osborne. (Winnipeg&#x27;s multi-member constituencies were replaced by single-seat ridings for this election; Osborne is located in the city&#x27;s centre.)

The 1958 election resulted in a hung parliament, with the Progressive Conservatives winning 26 seats and the Liberal-Progressives 19. Campbell initially tried to form an alliance with the CCF (Stinson would have served as Minister of Welfare), but these plans came to nothing. The CCF allowed the Tories under Dufferin Roblin to form government.

Roblin&#x27;s government placed the CCF in a paradoxical situation. His Progressive Conservative party was actually to the left of Campbell&#x27;s Liberals, and introduced many significant reforms. The CCF had little choice but to support Roblin&#x27;s legislation, thereby giving the Tories the record they needed to win another election the following year. The CCF fell to ten seats in the 1959 election, and Stinson was personally defeated by Tory candidate Obie Baizley. He resigned as party leader in 1960, and was replaced by Russell Paulley.

During Stinson&#x27;s time as party leader, the CCF was unable to make significant inroads beyond its urban support base (though future Premier Ed Schreyer was elected in a rural constituency). The party made limited gains in the late 1950s, however, and was poised to become the official opposition (if Liberal support continued to decline).

In the late 1950s, Stinson supported the call to transform the national CCF into a broader party. He campaigned for its merger with the Canadian Labour Congress to create the New Democratic Party.

In 1962, Stinson ran as an NDP candidate in Wellington (north-west Winnipeg), but lost to Tory Richard Seaborn by about 200 votes. In 1963, he ran for the federal NDP in Winnipeg South and fared poorly (receiving only 7,867 votes of about 56,000 cast).

Later in 1963, Stinson was re-elected to the second ward of the Winnipeg City Council. He retained his seat in the 1967 municipal election, where he remained until his retirement in 1971. In 1969, he was chosen as chair of Winnipeg&#x27;s traffic commission.

In 1975, he published a book entitled &quot;Political Warriors: Recollections of a Social-Democrat&quot;.

<doc id="878356" wikidata="Q546785" url="?curid=878356" title="Kiln People">
<text>Kiln People is a 2002 science fiction novel by American writer David Brin. It was published in the United Kingdom under the title &quot;Kil&#x27;n People&quot;. It was short-listed in four different awards for best SF/fantasy novel of 2002 – the Hugo Award, the Locus Award, the John W. Campbell Award, and the Arthur C. Clarke Award – each time finishing behind a different book.

==Plot introduction==
The novel takes place in a future in which people can create clay duplicates (called &quot;dittos&quot; or golems) of themselves. A ditto retains all of the archetype&#x27;s memories up until the time of duplication. The duplicate lasts only about a day, and the original person (referred to in the book as an archie, from &quot;archetype&quot;, or &quot;rig&quot;, from &quot;original&quot;) can then choose whether or not to upload the ditto&#x27;s memories. Most dittos want to inload, so that their experience will be continuous with that of their archie. Most people use dittos to do their work, as they are affordable even for the poor. Many also use dittos to experience pleasure which could hurt a real person. Dittos come in many colors, which signify their quality and intended role. A cheap ditto suitable for housework is green, whereas a quality one for business is gray. Ebonies are highly specialized dittos that are good at intelligent data analysis; platinums are only used by the very rich, and closely resemble real people. Ivory dittos specialize in the reception of pleasure and sexual fulfillment. Other colors of ditto (such as purple, red, and yellow) exist, but are rarely mentioned in the novel.

==Plot summary==

Albert Morris is a private detective who uses dittos extensively. His dittos are usually imprinted faithfully; indeed, his dittos have a fidelity rate rarely seen in the novel&#x27;s world. The book opens with a green ditto being chased across the city by ditto thugs of Beta, a criminal figure engaged in copyright violation by kidnapping desirable dittos and duplicating them. Albert&#x27;s green makes it to safety, allowing Albert to inload his memories and bust Beta&#x27;s latest scheme. The next morning, Albert makes three dittos (two grays and a green) and sends them off to do his business. After four hours of sleep, he imprints an ebony to help him work on a case.

One gray meets with Ritu Maharal, the daughter of Yosil Maharal, one of the founders of Universal Kilns (UK) who has disappeared under suspicious circumstances. Yosil is later discovered dead, and Albert&#x27;s gray meets the surviving Maharal ditto (or ghost, a ditto that survives after the original has died). ditMaharal runs away, and when the gray follows, he is captured by the ditto.

The second gray gets involved in a plan to infiltrate Universal Kilns to see if they are illegally withholding technical advancements to the duplicating process. He is a dupe of unknown forces, and is actually carrying a bomb into the UK factory, but he realizes just in time and manages to minimize the damage done when he blows up.

The green comes out of the kiln and starts doing the chores he was made to do, but soon displays a lack of motivation to complete his assigned tasks and instead heads off to the beach. Once there, he decides that he is an imperfect copy of Albert, or a &quot;frankie&quot; (a fictional slang word derived from Frankenstein&#x27;s monster). This is an unprecedented occurrence for Albert due to his unusual ditto-making prowess. The green decides not to continue doing chores, and claims independence. Though an imperfect copy of Albert, the green figures prominently in the plot.

Meanwhile, real Albert disguises himself as a gray ditto and meets with Ritu, who is also disguised as a gray. On the way to investigate Yosil&#x27;s cabin, where the eccentric scientist spent much of his time, they both are made aware of an attack on Albert&#x27;s home. Shortly after, Albert and Ritu end up stranded in the desert after an attempt on their lives. They eventually make it to ditMaharal&#x27;s secret lab where the first gray is being held. The green frankie makes it there as well, soon to expire.

ditMaharal has constructed an apparatus that he plans to use to elevate himself to godhood, using two of Albert&#x27;s dittos to amplify himself and the deaths of over a million people to fuel his elevation. The green and the real Albert join forces to destroy the apparatus and disable the bioweapons that would have been used in an attack on a nearby city. However, the real Albert&#x27;s mind winds up elevating, leaving his body in a comatose-like state. As the book ends, Albert and the green frankie agree to upload the green&#x27;s memories into Albert&#x27;s body, effectively replacing Albert&#x27;s personality and memories with the frankie&#x27;s: Albert will attempt to ascend to the higher plane of existence, and the frankie gets to lead the life he wanted, in Albert&#x27;s body, with Clara (Albert&#x27;s girlfriend).

<doc id="878365" wikidata="Q271797" url="?curid=878365" title="Mohéli">
<text>Mohéli , also known as Mwali, is an autonomously-governed island that forms part of the Union of the Comoros. It is the smallest of the three major islands in the country. It is located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa and it is the smallest of the four major Comoro Islands. Its capital and largest city is Fomboni.

== History ==
Until 1830, Mohéli was part of the Ndzuwani Sultanate, which also controlled the neighbouring island of Anjouan. In 1830, migrants from Madagascar led by Ramanetaka, who later changed his name to Abderemane, took over the island and established the sultanate of Mwali. In the mid-nineteenth century its ruler was Queen Jumbe-Souli. In 1886, France made the island a protectorate.

Until 1889, Mwali had its own French resident, but the island was then subjugated to the residency of Anjouan. The sultanate was dismantled in 1909 following the French annexation of the island. French colonial stamps bearing the inscription &quot;Mohéli&quot; were circulated between 1906 and 1912.

===Comoros===
In 1975, Mohéli agreed to join the Comoros nation, along with Grande Comore and Anjouan. Political, economic and social turmoil affected Mohéli and the Comoros in general.

===Independence===
On 11 August 1997, Mohéli seceded from the Comoros, a week after Anjouan. Mohéli&#x27;s secessionist leaders were Said Mohamed Soefu who became president, and Soidri Ahmed, who became prime minister.

===Rejoining Comoros===
Mohéli rejoined Comoros in 1998. In 2002, Mohéli ratified the new Comorian constitution, which provided for a less centralized federal government and more power to the island governments. It helped settle continuing political turmoil on Comoros and continuing secessionism on Anjouan. The same year, Mohamed Said Fazul was elected president. His supporters won most seats in Mohéli&#x27;s delegation to Parliament in the legislative elections of 2004.

== Politics ==
Mohamed Said Fazul was elected president of Mohéli in 2002 against Mohamed Hassanaly.

The legislative assembly of the autonomous island of Moheli has ten seats and was elected on 14 and 21 March 2004. Nine seats were won by the supporters of Said Mohamed Fazul and the last by a supporter of Azali Assoumani. In 2007, Mohamed Ali Said was elected president of the autonomous island of Moheli (currently president instead of governor) against Said Mohamed Fazul. 

After shortening his two-year term, which was to end in 2012, due to problems with the electoral calendar, Mohamed Ali Said was re-elected governor of the autonomous island of Moheli in December 2010 against the presidential majority candidate Said Ali Hilali. The election of the island&#x27;s councillors was won by an absolute majority by Mohamed Ali Said&#x27;s camp.

Following the legislative and communal elections held in 2015, it was Governor Mohamed Ali Said&#x27;s party that won the majority in the island assembly, allying with the councillors (equivalent to deputies at the national level) of those of President Ikililou&#x27;s supporters and related parties (UPDC party).

In May 2016, following the island governors&#x27; elections, it was Mohamed Said Fazul who won against President Ikililou&#x27;s wife (Hadidja Dhoinine) in the 5-year governorship elections. It is therefore the second time he takes the reins of the island of Moheli.

As a reminder, at the national level, it is the former president (2002-2006) Azali Assoumani who won the elections before Mohamed Ali Soilih. This is his second term (2016-2021) as President of the Union of the Comoros.

==Population==
Mohéli&#x27;s population, , is about 38,000. Its main ethnic group, as on the other Comoros islands Grande Comore and Anjouan as well as the French territory Mayotte, is the Comorian ethnic group, a synthesis of Bantu, Arab, Malay and Malagasy culture. The main religion is Sunni Islam.

===Communities===
*Fomboni - 19,000
*Nioumachoua - 3,400
*Wanani - 2,500
*Djoièzi - 1,636

==Environment==

===Protected areas===
On 19 April 2001, the first protected area in this countryMohéli Marine Parkwas gazetted. This was the culmination of a unique process by which the local communities in the ten villages around the park boundaries negotiated a collaborative arrangement with the government for the establishment and management of the park. The marine park programme was among the 27 finalists selected from nearly 500 nominations by the Equator Initiative, a partnership between the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), IUCN, the UN Foundation and four other international groups, to promote community-based initiatives aimed at furthering sustainable development. The marine park was redesignated Mohéli National Park in 2010, and in 2015 was expanded to include approximately three-quarters of the island&#x27;s land area.

===Important Bird Area===
A 6,268 ha tract encompassing the highlands of the interior of the western part of the island, including Mount Mlédjélé, has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of Comoro olive pigeons, Comoro blue pigeons, tropical shearwaters, Moheli scops owls, Malagasy harriers, Moheli brush warblers, Moheli bulbuls, Comoro thrushes, Humblot&#x27;s sunbirds and red-headed fodies.

== Flags ==
== Airport ==
Mohéli Bandar Es Eslam Airport between the villages of Fomboni and Djoièzi on the north coast of the island is the only airport on Mohéli.

<doc id="878370" wikidata="Q634564" url="?curid=878370" title="Frank S. Black">
<text>Frank Swett Black (March 8, 1853 – March 22, 1913) was an American newspaper editor, lawyer and politician. A Republican, he was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1895 to 1897, and the 32nd governor of New York from 1897 to 1898.

A native of Limington, Maine, Black graduated from Dartmouth College in 1875 and moved to New York, where he edited and reported for newspapers in Johnstown and Troy. He studied law, attained admission to the bar in 1879, and practiced in Troy.

Black became involved in politics by giving speeches for Republican candidates and serving as chairman of the party in Rensselaer County. In 1894, he was a successful candidate for the United States House of Representatives, and he served a partial term, March 1895 to January 1897. Black resigned before the end of his term because he had been elected governor.

In 1896, Black was the successful Republican nominee for governor. He served one term, January 1897 to December 1898. He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1898, losing at the party&#x27;s state convention to Theodore Roosevelt, who went on to win the general election.

After leaving office, Black resumed the practice of law and remained active in politics as a campaign speaker for Republican candidates. He died in Troy on March 22, 1913, and was buried at his summer home, a farm in Freedom, New Hampshire.

==Early life==
Frank S. Black was born near Limington, Maine, on March 8, 1853, one of eleven children born to farmer Jacob Black and Charlotte (Butters) Black. His father moved the family to Alfred, Maine, after accepting an appointment as keeper of the York County jail. Black attended Limerick Academy, graduated from Lebanon Academy in 1871, then taught school while attending Dartmouth College. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1875, was an editor of all three of the school&#x27;s student publications, and won prizes for oratory. While in college, Black joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.

==Start of career==
After completing his education, Black moved Rome, New York, where he sold chromolithographs. He soon moved to Johnstown, New York, to become editor of the &quot;Johnstown Journal&quot;, the publisher of which was a member of the Stalwart faction of Republicans who were loyal to Roscoe Conkling. A member of the Half-Breed faction of the Republican Party and follower of James G. Blaine, Black changed the political stance of the paper while its publisher was out of town, for which he was promptly fired. He then moved to Troy, New York, where he worked for the &quot;Troy Whig&quot; and &quot;Troy Times&quot;. While working as a night reporter, clerk in the Troy post office, and process server, he studied law at the firm of Robertson &amp; Foster. Black attained admission to the bar in 1879 and began to practice in Troy as a partner in the firm of Smith, Wellington &amp; Black.

In 1888, Black campaigned for Benjamin Harrison for president. In 1892, he campaigned for Harrison&#x27;s reelection, but Harrison was defeated by former President Grover Cleveland. His continued political activities included serving as chairman of the Republican Party in Rensselaer County. In March 1894, an election day dispute between Republicans and Democrats in Troy culminated with the murder of Robert Ross, a Republican. Black assisted in the prosecution of the defendants, Democrats Bartholomew &quot;Bat&quot; Shea and John McGough, who were convicted. McGough was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Shea was executed.

==U.S. House==
Largely as the result of publicity from the Ross murder case, in November 1894, Black was elected to the 54th United States Congress, representing New York&#x27;s 19th congressional district. He served from March 4, 1895, to January 7, 1897, when he resigned because he had been elected governor. During his House term, Black was a member of the Committee on Pacific Railroads and the Committee on Private Land Claims. He was a delegate to the 1896 Republican National Convention and supported William McKinley for president.

==Governor==
Black was elected governor in 1896 and served from January 1, 1897, to December 31, 1898. A highlight of his governorship was completion of construction on the New York State Capitol, which had fallen far behind schedule and had been plagued with cost overruns.

As governor, Black advocated for conservation of the area now known as the Adirondack State Park. As part of this effort, he oversaw the establishment of the New York State College of Forestry. During Black&#x27;s governorship, the boroughs that now make up New York City were consolidated into one municipality.

Black also oversaw New York&#x27;s participation in the Spanish–American War. Under his leadership, 16,000 New York soldiers were raised, trained, and equipped for accession into the United States Army as it expanded for the war. In addition, he successfully advocated for election reforms, including allowing soldiers to vote while they were out of state or outside the United States.

In his 1894 and 1896 campaigns, Black had been nominated at Republican conventions by political operative Louis F. Payn, who was widely regarded as a corrupt associate of Thomas C. Platt, the boss of New York State&#x27;s Republican Party. As governor, Black caused a controversy when he appointed Payn as state insurance superintendent. Despite criticism from advocates of good government and civil service reform, Black continued to support Payn. Even though he backed Payn, Black incurred Platt&#x27;s displeasure when Black successfully opposed a bill Platt favored, which would have banned from newspapers editorial cartoons critical of state government officials. (As governor, Theodore Roosevelt won a showdown with Platt over Payn&#x27;s reappointment, which resulted in the selection of another candidate.)

Late in Black&#x27;s term, state officials were accused of squandering taxpayer money on a project to expand the Erie Canal, which had come to be regarded as a boondoggle because of delays and excessive costs. Black&#x27;s chances for reelection were jeopardized, so Republicans replaced him as their 1898 gubernatorial nominee with Theodore Roosevelt, who had recently attained hero status in Cuba during the Spanish–American War. Roosevelt won the November general election by narrowly defeating Democratic nominee Augustus Van Wyck. In 1899, an investigating commission appointed by Black, in conjunction with two special counsels appointed by Roosevelt, exonerated those involved of criminal wrongdoing.

==Later life==

After leaving office, Black resumed his law practice. Among the noteworthy cases in which he was involved, Black took part in the defense of Roland B. Molineaux in the famed &quot;People v. Molineux&quot; case. After Molineaux was convicted of murder, the conviction was overturned and he won an acquittal at retrial. The case was the source of the well-known &quot;Molineux rule&quot; which limits the ability of prosecutors to use prior crimes as proof that a defendant committed the crime with which he is charged. Black also took part in the defense of Caleb Powers for the assassination of Kentucky governor William Goebel.

Black maintained his interest in politics even after leaving office. He was a delegate to the 1904 Republican National Convention, and nominated President Theodore Roosevelt for election to a full term. Later that year, he was a candidate for the Republican nomination for United States Senator, but withdrew in favor of incumbent Chauncey Depew, who went on to win reelection. In 1908, Black, who had fallen out with Roosevelt, supported Charles Evans Hughes for president over Roosevelt&#x27;s choice, William Howard Taft.

Black remained a popular and sought-after speaker for political events and other occasions. Among his best-known orations was a 1903 commemorative eulogy for Abraham Lincoln delivered to the Republican Club of the City of New York during its annual Lincoln&#x27;s Birthday celebration.

==Death and burial==

<text>José Manuel Cerqueira Afonso dos Santos (2 August 1929 – 23 February 1987), known professionally as José Afonso and also popularly known as Zeca Afonso, was a Portuguese singer-songwriter. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of Portugal&#x27;s folk and protest music scene. His music played a significant role in the resistance against the dictatorial Estado Novo regime, making him an icon in Portugal.

Afonso&#x27;s song &quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot; was used as a radio-broadcast signal by the Portuguese Armed Forces during their military coup operation in the morning of 25 April 1974, which led to the Carnation Revolution and the transition to democracy in Portugal. Subsequently, Afonso&#x27;s music, along with &quot;Grândola, Vila Morena,&quot; became emblematic of the revolution, anti-fascism, the Portuguese labor movement, and the political left.

== Biography ==

=== 1929–1940: Early life ===
José Afonso was born in Aveiro on 2 August 1929. His parents were José Nepomuceno Afonso dos Santos, a magistrate, and Maria das Dores Dantas Cerqueira, a primary school teacher.

In 1930, his parents travelled to Angola, a Portuguese colony at the time, where his father had been placed as a judge in the city of Silva Porto (present-day Cuíto). For health reasons, Afonso stayed in Aveiro, in a house near the Fonte das Cinco Bicas, with his aunt Gigé and his uncle Xico, a &quot;republican and anticlerical&quot; man. In 1933 Afonso travelled to Angola at his mother&#x27;s request. On the ship he met a missionary who became his companion during the voyage. Afonso stayed for three years in Angola, where he began his primary education.

In 1936, he returned to Aveiro. In 1937 he went to live overseas for the second time, this time to Mozambique, another Portuguese colony in Africa, where his parents were then living with his siblings João and Mariazinha.

He returned to Portugal in 1938, this time to the house of his uncle Filomeno, mayor of the town of Belmonte. There he finished the fourth grade. His uncle, a fierce fascist supporter, made him a join the &quot;Mocidade Portuguesa&quot;, a paramilitary style political indoctrination youth organization conceived by the right-wing regime of Salazar and the Estado Novo, to provide regime aligned cadres and future leaders.

=== 1940–1956: The Coimbra years ===
He went to Coimbra in 1940 to continue his studies. He studied in the D. João III Lyceum and lived with his aunt Avrilete. His family went from Mozambique to East Timor, also a Portuguese overseas territory at that time, where his father continued his job as a judge. Mariazinha went with them while his brother João returned to Portugal. After the occupation of Timor by the Japanese, Afonso received no news from his parents for three years, until the end of World War II in 1945.

When he was in his 5th year of lyceum studies, Afonso started singing seranades as a &quot;bicho&quot; (meaning a non-human ugly or scary creature), a rank used in the University of Coimbra &quot;praxe&quot; for lyceum students. He became known as the &quot;bicho-cantor&quot; (singing creature).

From 1946 to 1948 he worked to finish his lyceum studies, after failing two years. He met Maria Amália de Oliveira, whom he married secretly due to his parents&#x27; opposition. He traveled with some of the most important university musical groups, such as Orfeon Académico de Coimbra, and played football for Associação Académica de Coimbra.

In 1949 he started studying History and Philosophy at Coimbra University. With the Orfeon Académico de Coimbra, he travelled to Angola and Mozambique.

In January 1953, his first son José Manuel was born. Later that year, his first recordings were released. These were two 78-rpm records of Coimbra fado songs, of which no copies exist today.

Between 1953 and 1955, he served compulsory military service. He was mobilized to Macau, a Portuguese territory at the time, but due to health problems he was discharged. He was afterwards stationed in Coimbra until completing military service. His daughter Helena was born in 1954. During this time he experienced many economic difficulties and eventually divorced his wife.

=== 1956–1968: Work as a teacher, first albums and early political action ===
In 1956 Afonso released his first EP, &quot;Fados de Coimbra&quot;. After his military service, he started working as a teacher. From January to September 1957 he worked at a private school in Mangualde and afterwards worked at the Industrial and Commercial School of Lagos between October 1957 and July 1959. Due to his financial problems, he sent his children to the Portuguese overseas territory of Mozambique in 1958, to live with his parents. In that year he became enthralled by Humberto Delgado&#x27;s presidential campaign; Delgado lost due to massive electoral fraud perpetrated by the authoritarian Estado Novo regime.

Between October 1959 and July 1960 he worked at the Technical School of Alcobaça. It was during 1959 and 1960 that he started singing in his trademark musical style, coloured with political and social connotations, touring with many popular groups around the country and gradually becoming a favourite among the working class and the rural population. He toured for a month in Angola with the Orfeon Académico de Coimbra. In 1960 he released another EP, &quot;Balada do Outono.&quot; 

From 1961 to 1962 he followed the pro-democracy student strikes and demonstrations demanding the end of the authoritarian Estado Novo regime, which were brutally repressed by the police. He continued releasing many of his songs and introduced important new guitar arrangements. He played in Switzerland, Germany and Sweden, with a fado guitar group that included Adriano Correia de Oliveira, José Niza, Jorge Godinho, Durval Moreirinhas and the singer Esmeralda Amoedo.

He released a new EP, named &quot;Baladas de Coimbra&quot;, in 1962. He completed his university studies in 1963 with a thesis about Jean-Paul Sartre, which got a grade of 11 out of 20. That year he also finalized his divorce from his wife Maria Amália.

In 1964 he released his first studio album, &quot;Baladas e Canções&quot; (&quot;Ballads and Songs&quot;). In May 1964, Afonso performed at the &quot;Sociedade Musical Fraternidade Operária Grandolense&quot; (Workers&#x27; Fraternity Musical Society of Grândola&quot;)&quot; in Grândola, where he found the inspiration to compose his most famous song, &quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot;. The song would be recorded years later for his album &quot;Cantigas do Maio&quot;, and would become one of signals for the start of the Carnation Revolution in April 1974.

From 1964 to 1967, Afonso was in Lourenço Marques (now Maputo) and Beira, in Mozambique, with his second wife Zélia, where he reunited with his children. In his last two years in the overseas province, he taught in Beira and composed music for the Bertolt Brecht play &quot;The Exception and The Rule&quot;. In 1965 his daughter Joana was born and by 1967, marked by the colonial reality and the Portuguese Colonial War, he returned to Lisbon. He left his older son, José Manuel, with his grandparents in Mozambique.

Back in Portugal, Afonso took up a secondary school teacher position in Setúbal, where he developed a severe health crisis which left him hospitalized for 20 days. After receiving hospital discharge, he found out that he had been expelled from public school teaching because the regime censors disapproved of his leftist political ideals and considered his songs highly subversive. Later, the book &quot;Cantares de José Afonso&quot; (Songs of José Afonso) was published. The Portuguese Communist Party leadership invited him to become a party member but Afonso refused. He signed a contract with the record label Orfeu, which would record 70% of his works.

=== 1968–1974: Prolific period and anti-regime activities ===
In 1968, after being dismissed from the government teaching job, Afonso became a private tutor and started singing more regularly with popular groups from the south bank of the Tagus river, a region which had a stronger influence of the Portuguese Communist Party. Around Christmas, Afonso released the album &quot;Cantares do Andarilho&quot; (&quot;Songs of the Wanderer&quot;), in collaboration with Rui Pato, the first album recorded for the label Orfeu. Afonso had a special contract with Orfeu, for he was paid 15,000 escudos per month, a princely sum at the time, under the condition that he recorded an album per year.

In 1969, with the replacement of hardliner António de Oliveira Salazar by the more moderate Marcelo Caetano as head of the Estado Novo regime, the nation got a slight taste of democracy, such as permission to rebuild a democratic Labour Union movement. José Afonso joined the movement and supported it by all the means he could while also taking part in the second wave of student rebellion against the regime in the university town of Coimbra. That year, his album &quot;Contos Velhos Rumos Novos&quot; (&quot;Old Tales New Courses&quot;) was released. For the first time an instrument other than the guitar was used on a José Afonso album. For this album he was awarded the prize for best album of the year by &quot;Casa da Imprensa&quot;, a distinction he would repeat in 1970 and 1971. His fourth and last son, Pedro, was also born in 1969.

In 1970, Afonso released the album &quot;Traz Outro Amigo També&quot;m &quot;(&quot;&quot;Bring Another Friend as Well&quot;), which was recorded in London at the Pye Studios. It was the first album without frequent collaborator Rui Pato, who had been forbidden to travel by the Portugal&#x27;s secret police. On 21 March, &quot;Casa da Imprensa&quot; (representing the Portuguese press) gave Afonso an honorary award for his &quot;high quality work as a singer and composer and for his decisive influence upon Portuguese popular music&quot;. He participated in an international festival in Cuba.

At the end of 1971, the album &quot;Cantigas do Maio&quot; (&quot;Songs of May&quot;) was released. The album was recorded at Château d&#x27;Hérouville, near Paris. This album is generally considered the best album of his career. In 1972, he released the album &quot;Eu Vou Ser Como a Toupeira&quot; (&quot;I Will Be Just Like The Mole&quot;), recorded in Madrid at the Cellada Studios.

In 1973, José Afonso continued his &quot;pilgrimage&quot;, singing all over Portugal. Many of his appearances were forcibly cancelled by the PIDE/DGS. In April he was arrested and sentenced to 20 days in the Caxias prison (a facility used mostly to jail political prisoners). In the prison he wrote the poem &quot;Era Um Redondo Vocábulo&quot;. For Christmas, he released the album &quot;Venham Mais Cinco&quot; (&quot;Let Five More Come&quot;), recorded in Paris and on which José Mário Branco collaborated. Janine de Waleyne from the Blue Stars of France, a prominent vocalist in French chanson, guested on the title track.

On 29 March 1974, Afonso participated in a concert event at the Coliseu dos Recreios in Lisbon, called &quot;First Meeting of the Portuguese Song&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;Primeiro Encontro da Canção Portuguesa&quot;). This was an event sponsored by &quot;Casa da Imprensa&quot; in which several folk singer-songwriters and musicians with anti-Estado Novo inclinations participated. The state censorship still operated in the event, and Afonso was forbidden from performing some of his songs with more political messages, such as &quot;Venham Mais Cinco&quot; and &quot;A Morte Saiu à Rua&quot;. &quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot;, however, was not seen as a subversive song and was allowed to be performed. Almost one month later, on 25 April 1974, the Portuguese Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a nearly bloodless military coup, known as the Carnation Revolution. &quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot; was one of the two songs used as a radio-broadcast signal by the Portuguese Armed Forces Movement during their coup operation and is considered ever since the anthem of the revolution.

=== 1974–1980: Revolutionary period ===

In December 1974, Afonso released the album &quot;Coro dos Tribunais&quot; (&quot;Courthouse Chorus&quot;), which was recorded in London, again at the Pye Studios, with musical arrangements by Fausto Bordalo Dias. The album includes two Brechtian songs, composed in Mozambique in the period between 1964 and 1967: &quot;Coro dos Tribunais&quot; and &quot;Eu Marchava de Dia e de Noite&quot;.

From 1974 to 1975 he became directly involved in the popular revolutionary movements. The PREC (Ongoing Revolutionary Process) became his passion. He performed on 11 March 1975 (the day of a failed coup led by António de Spínola) in the RALIS, a leftist military stronghold. Afonso established a collaboration with the far-left movement LUAR (Revolutionary Action and Unity League). LUAR released his single &quot;Viva o Poder Popular&quot; (Hail to the People&#x27;s Power). In Italy, the revolutionary organizations &quot;Lotta Continua&quot;, &quot;Il Manifesto&quot; and &quot;Avanguardia Operaia&quot; released the album &quot;República&quot;, recorded in Rome on 30 September and 1 October 1975. The money received from the sales of the album went to support the striking workers of the newspaper &quot;República&quot;.

In 1976 he supported Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho&#x27;s presidential candidacy. Otelo was an important commander of the Carnation Revolution military operations, and Afonso would support him again in 1980. He released the album &quot;Com as Minhas Tamanquinhas&quot; (&quot;With My Little Clogs&quot;).

The album &quot;Enquanto Há Força&quot; (&quot;While There is Strength&quot;), released in 1978, another collaboration with Fausto, shows some of Afonso&#x27;s concerns about colonialism and imperialism and is also a critique of the Catholic Church. It includes the participation of other Portuguese artists such as Adriano Correia de Oliveira and Sérgio Godinho.

In 1979 the album &quot;Fura Fura&quot; (&quot;Drill Drill&quot;) was released, with the collaboration of Júlio Pereira and the band Trovante. It contains eight songs that were meant for theater plays. He participated in the Anti-Eurovision Festival in Brussels.

=== 1980–1987: Zeca&#x27;s last years ===

In 1981, after two years out of the spotlight, Afonso returned to his Coimbra roots with the album &quot;Fados de Coimbra e Outras Canções&quot; (&quot;Coimbra fados and other songs&quot;). He played in Paris at the Théâtre de la Ville.

In 1982 he started developing the first symptoms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a severe disease that would affect him for the rest of his life. He played in Bruges at the Printemps Festival.

On 23 January 1983, Afonso, already weakened by the disease, played a sold-out show at the Coliseu dos Recreios in Lisbon. This show was recorded and immortalized in the live album &quot;Ao Vivo no Coliseu,&quot; released later that year. Afonso&#x27;s last concert was on 25 May 1983, at the Coliseu do Porto, in Porto. At the end of 1983 he released the album &quot;Como Se Fora Seu Filho&quot; (&quot;As If He Was His Son&quot;) The city of Coimbra awarded him its Golden Medal of the City. &quot;Thank you Zeca, come back whenever you wish, this is your home&quot;, the mayor of Coimbra, Mendes Silva, told him; to which Afonso replied &quot;I don&#x27;t want to become an institution, but I feel very grateful for the homage&quot;. The President of Portugal Ramalho Eanes wanted to bestow upon him the Order of Liberty, but Afonso refused to fill in the papers. Also in 1983 Afonso was reinstated in his official teaching position, whence he had been expelled in 1968; he was sent to a school in Azeitão to teach History and Portuguese. His disease worsened.

In 1985 his last album, &quot;Galinhas do Mato&quot; (&quot;Guineafowls&quot;), was released. Afonso was unable to sing all the songs on the album, being replaced by Luís Represas, Helena Vieira, Janita Salomé, José Mário Branco, Né Ladeiras and Marta Salomé. Musical arrangements were done by Júlio Pereira and Fausto.

In 1986 he supported the presidential candidacy of Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo, a progressive Catholic woman; she was not elected.

José Afonso died in Setúbal at 3 a.m. on 23 February 1987, aged 57, a victim of the sclerosis that had been diagnosed in 1982. His funeral in Setúbal occurred the following day and was attended by more than 30,000 people. The procession took two hours to cover 1300 meters. His coffin was covered with a red flag with no symbols, as he had wished, and it was borne by, among others, his fellow musicians Sérgio Godinho, Júlio Pereira, José Mário Branco, Luís Cília and Francisco Fanhais. Afonso is buried in the Nossa Senhora da Piedade cemetery in Setúbal.

== Legacy ==

On 18 November 1987, the Associação José Afonso was created with the objective of fulfilling Afonso&#x27;s intentions in the areas of Portuguese music and art.

In 1991, the city of Amadora inaugurated a statue of José Afonso in the city&#x27;s Central Park.

On 30 June 1994, as part of Lisboa-94, European Capital of Culture, a festival in homage to José Afonso took place. Many Portuguese musicians, both veterans and younger artists, joined in the tribute festival, called &quot;Filhos da Madrugada&quot; (&quot;Children of Dawn&quot;, the title of one of Afonso&#x27;s most famous songs). Earlier that year, BMG had released an album with the same title as the festival, and with the same artists performing their own versions of Afonso&#x27;s songs. Performers at this event included Brigada Victor Jara, Censurados, Delfins, Diva, Entre Aspas, Essa Entente, Frei Fado D&#x27;El Rei, GNR, Madredeus, Mão Morta, Opus Ensemble, Peste &amp; Sida, Resistência, Ritual Tejo, Sérgio Godinho, Sétima Legião, Sitiados, Tubarões, UHF, Vozes da Rádio, and Xutos &amp; Pontapés. Thirteen years earlier, Afonso had remarked that &quot;If rock is the musical style that the young prefer, then we should ask for good quality rock music&quot;.

In 1995 José Mário Branco, Amélia Muge, and João Afonso, José Afonso&#x27;s nephew, released another album in homage to Afonso, called &quot;Maio, Maduro Maio&quot;, that included many of his songs and two previously unreleased ones, &quot;Entre Sodoma e Gomorra&quot; and &quot;Nem Sempre os Dias São Dias Passados&quot;.

For the 10th anniversary of Afonso&#x27;s death, in 1997, EMI released for the first time in CD format the 1964 album &quot;Baladas e Canções&quot;.

In 1998, Vitorino and Janita Salomé took part in a concert in homage to José Afonso, included in Expo&#x27;98&#x27;s programme.

In 2007 he was elected the 29th Greatest Portuguese.

<text>General elections were held in the Netherlands on 28 April 1971. The Labour Party (PvdA) emerged as the largest party, winning 39 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives. The elections were the first without compulsory voting, causing a sharp fall in voter turnout, down to 79% from 95% in the 1967 elections. Barend Biesheuvel of the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) became prime minister, leading the first Biesheuvel cabinet.

His cabinet contained a broad coalition of parties, with ministers from ARP, Christian Historical Union (both Protestant), the Catholic People&#x27;s Party, the conservative-liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy and moderate socialist Democratic Socialists &#x27;70 (DS&#x27;70), which had just split off from the PvdA.

However, Biesheuvel&#x27;s government was short-lived; following a decision to cut government spending, DS&#x27;70 withdrew from the government, causing it to lose its majority and fresh elections to be held after just a year and seven months.

<doc id="878381" wikidata="Q6765470" url="?curid=878381" title="Marionberry">
<text>The marionberry (&quot;Rubus L.&quot; subgenus &quot;Rubus&quot;) is a cultivar of blackberry released in 1956 by the USDA Agricultural Research Service breeding program in cooperation with Oregon State University. It is named after Marion County, Oregon, where the berry was bred and tested extensively in the mid-20th century. 

A cross between the &#x27;Chehalem&#x27; and &#x27;Olallie&#x27; varieties, it is the most widely planted trailing blackberry in the world. Oregon accounts for over 90% of the worldwide acreage of marionberries.

== Description and flavor ==
Marionberries may be called &quot;caneberries&quot; due to their typical extensive growth on long &quot;canes&quot; (vines) and brambles. Marionberries are an aggregate fruit formed in a cluster of many juice filled sacks called drupelets. 

The marionberry plant is a vigorously growing trailing vine, with some canes up to long. The vines have many large spines, and the fruiting laterals are long and strong, producing many berries. The berry is glossy and, as with many blackberries, appears black on the plant, but turns a deep, dark purple when frozen and thawed. It is medium in size and tends to be conical, longer than it is wide. The berry has a somewhat tart, earthy and sweet flavor.

== Development and cultivation ==
The marionberry was developed by the United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon. It was bred by George F. Waldo as a mix between the small, flavorful &#x27;Chehalem&#x27; berry and the larger, better-producing &#x27;Olallie&#x27; berry. Both the &#x27;Chehalem&#x27; and &#x27;Olallie&#x27; berries are caneberry hybrids. Waldo made the initial cross in 1945, selected it as OSC 928 in 1948 in Corvallis, and tested it in Marion County and elsewhere in the Willamette Valley. The berry was released in 1956 under the name Marion the county where it was first cultivated and tested. It is considered to be a &quot;trailing&quot; blackberry vine suitable for management in cultivation.

Oregon produces 90% of the US grown, frozen blackberries found in US grocery stores, with Marion County and the Willamette Valley collectively accounting for most of that production. The marionberry is well-adapted to the mild, maritime western Oregon climate, with its frequent rains and warm summers.

Marionberries ripen throughout spring and early summer, reaching their peak during July when they are hand-picked or machine-harvested. Some 900 Oregon growers produced marionberries, as of the early 2000s. The harvesting season is typically between July 10 and August 10, with a single acre producing up to in a harvest.

There is a hybrid variety with boysenberry in Australia called &quot;Silvanberry&quot;. Classed under the blackberry family, Silvanberry plants have many characteristics commonly found among other blackberry varieties. These plants are long living (15 to 20 years) perennials, hardy and cold tolerant, easy to grow, and productive spreaders.

===Not an invasive species===
Although related to a blackberry species considered to be a noxious weed the &quot;Himalaya&quot; blackberry (&quot;R. armeniacus&quot;) which is an aggressive invasive species marionberries are not invasive because they do not readily germinate to grow new canes from seed. They are commonly pruned and trained on trellises.

== Marionberry pedigree ==
The pedigree of marionberries involves 44% of &quot;Rubus ursinus&quot;, 25% of &quot;R. armeniacus&quot;, and 6% of &quot;R. idaeus&quot; (the red raspberry).




==In popular culture==
Marionberries as fresh or frozen fruit or in various products, such as jam, syrup or ice cream are widely consumed and prized by visitors to the Willamette Valley as a souvenir.

The berry was the inspiration for the West Coast League&#x27;s Marion Berries collegiate summer baseball team, which was founded in 2024 and begin play in 2025.

<text>Cost estimation models are mathematical algorithms or parametric equations used to estimate the costs of a product or project. The results of the models are typically necessary to obtain approval to proceed, and are factored into business plans, budgets, and other financial planning and tracking mechanisms.

These algorithms were originally performed manually but now are almost universally computerized. They may be standardized (available in published texts or purchased commercially) or proprietary, depending on the type of business, product, or project in question. Simple models may use standard spreadsheet products.

Models typically function through the input of parameters that describe the attributes of the product or project in question, and possibly physical resource requirements. The model then provides as output various resources requirements in cost and time. Some models concentrate only on estimating project costs (often a single monetary value). Little attention has been given to the development of models for estimating the amount of resources needed for the different elements that comprise a project.

Cost modeling practitioners often have the titles of cost estimators, cost engineers, or parametric analysts.

Typical applications include:
*Construction
*Software Development
*Manufacturing
*New product development

<doc id="878406" wikidata="Q131190958" url="?curid=878406" title="Donair">
<text>The donair is a variation of the doner kebab which originated in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada in the early 1970s. A donair consists of five main ingredients: donair meat, tomato, onions, donair sauce, and pita bread; additional toppings create a different product. Donair meat is made from spiced ground beef sliced off a rotating cone. The toppings typically include chopped onions and tomatoes, while the distinctive sweet sauce is made from condensed milk, sugar, vinegar, and garlic powder (optional). All of these ingredients are wrapped together in a soft white pita.

== History ==
Originating from traditional Turkish &quot;doner&quot;, the Halifax donair was created in the 1970s by Greek immigrant Peter Gamoulakos. Initially offering traditional gyros at Velos Pizza in Bedford, Nova Scotia, Gamoulakos modified the recipe to better suit local tastes. He replaced lamb with beef and developed a sweet sauce made from evaporated milk, vinegar, and garlic powder.

== Development ==
Donairs have their origins in Turkey, traditionally known as &quot;doners&quot;, &quot;gyros&quot;, or &quot;doner kebabs&quot;. The modern fast food doner was reportedly invented by Mahmut Aygun, a Turkish immigrant in Berlin, in 1971. Velos Pizza in Bedford, Nova Scotia, is credited with creating the &quot;Halifax&quot; donair around 1971-1973, featuring a very sweet sauce made from condensed milk, sugar, garlic, and vinegar. 

In 1973, Gamoulakos opened the King of Donair restaurant on Quinpool Road in Halifax, where the donair recipe was developed further. The dish quickly gained popularity, becoming a staple of late-night dining. The classic donair consists of spiced ground beef cooked on a rotating spit, served in a pita with tomatoes, onions, and the signature sweet sauce.

== Expansion and recognition ==
Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, the donair continued to grow in popularity. In 2015, Halifax officially recognized the donair as the city&#x27;s official food. The motion, which saw an equal split among councillors, was decided by Mayor Mike Savage, who cast the deciding vote to elevate the donair to its official status.

== Cultural impact ==
The donair&#x27;s influence extends beyond Halifax, with its presence in other Canadian cities and endorsements from notable figures like Anthony Bourdain. Despite evolving and inspiring new culinary creations, the donair remains a beloved symbol of Halifax&#x27;s culinary heritage.

== Regional variations and current status ==
The Halifax donair has inspired numerous regional variations across Canada. In New Brunswick, donairs include lettuce, while in Alberta, variations include cheese and pepperoni. Despite these adaptations, the authentic donair remains a Nova Scotian specialty, and its popularity continues to grow. Today, Tony&#x27;s Meats, which acquired the Mr. Donair brand, continues to expand its reach, offering a range of donair-related products across Canada and recently into the U.S.

=== Edmonton donair scene ===
Edmonton has embraced the donair, with nearly 120 shops featuring donairs in their names. The city&#x27;s Lebanese community played a significant role in popularizing donairs in Edmonton. Notable establishments like Athena Donair contributed to its local fame. Unlike Halifax, Edmonton donairs often include variations like lettuce, tzatziki sauce, and unique flavors such as barbecue and pineapple curry. Recently, Prime Time Donair made headlines by winning an auction for a donair costume, paying $16,025 to keep the Alberta-made costume within the province.

== Health concerns ==
In summer 2008, after numerous cases of &quot;E. coli&quot; related food poisoning due to the consumption of undercooked donair meat in Alberta, the federal government came out with a set of guidelines for the preparation of donairs. The principal guideline was that the meat should be cooked at least twice: once on the spit, and then grilled as the donair is being prepared. Many Atlantic Canadian establishments already did this; however, some restaurants in Alberta omitted the grilling step.

<doc id="878415" wikidata="Q587677" url="?curid=878415" title="Republic of Minerva">
<text>The Republic of Minerva was a micronation consisting of the Minerva Reefs. It was one of the few modern attempts at creating a sovereign micronation on the reclaimed land of an artificial island in 1972. The architect was Las Vegas real estate millionaire and political activist Michael Oliver, who went on to other similar attempts in the following decade. Lithuanian-born Oliver formed a syndicate, the Ocean Life Research Foundation, which had considerable finances for the project and had offices in New York and London. They anticipated a libertarian society with &quot;no taxation, welfare, subsidies, or any form of economic interventionism.&quot; In addition to tourism and fishing, the economy of the new nation would include light industry and other commerce. 

On 24 February 1972 Tonga made a claim over the Minerva Reefs, which was backed by Australia, New Zealand (including the Cook Islands), Fiji, Nauru and Samoa. A Tongan expedition was sent to enforce the claim, arriving on 18 June 1972. In 1982 a group of Americans led by Morris C. &quot;Bud&quot; Davis tried to occupy the reefs, but were forced off by Tongan troops after three weeks. No known claimant group since 1982 has made any attempt to take possession of the Minerva Reefs. According to &quot;Reason&quot;, Minerva has today been &quot;more or less reclaimed by the sea&quot;.

==History==
The reefs were put on the charts by Captain John Nicholson of LMS Haweis in December 1818 as reported in The Sydney Gazette 30 January 1819 and had been marked on charts as &quot;Nicholson&#x27;s Shoal&quot; since the late 1820s. Captain H. M. Denham of HMS &quot;Herald&quot; surveyed the reefs in 1854 and renamed them after the Australian whaler &quot;Minerva&quot;, which collided with South Minerva Reef on 9 September 1829.

In 1971 barges loaded with sand arrived from Australia, bringing the reef level above the water and allowing construction of a small tower and flag. The Republic of Minerva issued a declaration of independence on 19 January 1972, in letters to neighboring countries and even created their own currency. Morris C. &quot;Bud&quot; Davis was elected as President of the Republic of Minerva.

Prior to 1972, Tonga had not claimed sovereignty over the Minerva Reefs. In 1887, when King George Tupou I of Tonga first proclaimed Tonga’s territory, the Minerva Reefs were not included. When asked about the Minervan&#x27;s project, the King of Tonga, Taufaahau Tupou IV, denied rumors that Tonga meant to claim sovereignty over it, yet said &quot;it was in the best interest of Tonga not to allow a group of people, whose objects were to make money and whose activities could be harmful, to become established on the reefs.&quot; Neighboring countries agreed; Fiji’s Prime Minister, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, claimed the actions of the Minervans set a dangerous precedent: &quot;If these people can claim Minerva, what would stop them from doing it here?&quot;

Consequently, a conference of the neighboring states (Australia, New Zealand, Tonga, Fiji, Nauru, Samoa, and territory of Cook Islands) met on 24 February 1972 at which Tonga made a claim over the Minerva Reefs, and the rest of the states recognized its claim.

On 15 June 1972 the following proclamation was published in a Tongan government gazette:
 A Tongan expedition was sent to enforce the claim, arriving on 18 June 1972. The Flag of Tonga was raised on 19 June 1972 on North Minerva and on South Minerva on 21 June 1972. Tonga&#x27;s claim was recognized by the South Pacific Forum in September 1972. Meanwhile, Provisional President Davis was fired by founder Michael Oliver and the project collapsed in confusion. Nevertheless, Minerva was referred to in O. T. Nelson&#x27;s post-apocalyptic children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Girl Who Owned a City&quot;, published in 1975, as an example of an invented utopia that the book&#x27;s protagonists could try to emulate.

In 1982 a group of Americans led again by Davis tried to occupy the reefs, but were forced off by Tongan troops after three weeks.

In November 2005, Fiji lodged a complaint with the International Seabed Authority concerning Tonga&#x27;s maritime waters claims surrounding Minerva. Tonga has lodged a counter claim.

<doc id="878417" wikidata="Q2420686" url="?curid=878417" title="Tim Hunkin">
<text>Timothy Mark Trelawney Hunkin (born 27 December 1950 in London) is an English engineer, cartoonist, writer, and artist living in Suffolk, England. He is best known for creating the Channel Four television series &quot;The Secret Life of Machines&quot;, in which he explains the workings and history of various household devices. He has also created museum exhibits for institutions across the UK, and designed numerous public engineering works, chiefly for entertainment. Hunkin&#x27;s works are distinctive, often recognisable by his unique style of papier-mâché sculpture (made from unpainted newsprint), his pen and ink cartoons, and his offbeat sense of humour.

==Education==
Hunkin enrolled in 1969, and graduated in engineering science from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in 1972.

==Work and career==
Hunkin&#x27;s &quot;Under the Pier Show&quot; at Southwold Pier, England, is a penny arcade featuring a number of humorous, coin-operated machines of his creation. Attractions include the &quot;Autofrisk&quot; (a device that simulates the experience of being frisked by multiple, inflated rubber gloves), the &quot;Bathyscape&quot; (a device that simulates a brief submarine adventure) and a somewhat rude sculptural clock. Hunkin has also opened Novelty Automation, an amusement arcade in Holborn, London, which has a more satirical tone, of which Hunkin has said &quot;I don’t think political art has an enormous effect, but in the short term it is satisfying to reinforce people’s disrespect of the villains.&quot;

Many of his other projects are large-scale and theatrical, including gigantic clocks of unconventional designs, bonfires and pyrotechnic displays. In 1976, he designed the flying pigs and sheep for rock band Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;In The Flesh&quot; tour, promoting their &quot;Animals&quot; album.
His displays are also featured in episodes of &quot;The Secret Life of Machines&quot; and relate to the machine covered by the programmes. These included a mountain of flaming televisions; flying vacuum cleaners fitted with rocket motors; a carhenge; a ballet of self-propelled portable radios; and a bizarre &quot;pilgrimage&quot; of an internal combustion engine carried, shoulder high, on a bier into the centre of Carhenge. The Pink Floyd inflatable pig was also featured in the vacuum cleaner episode. Other displays featured in the series were more informative, such as a free-standing central heating system and a &quot;human sewing machine.&quot; The programmes also include his cartoons in voiced and animated form.

In 2013 he created a large, unfolding clock for the San Francisco Exploratorium.

During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic Hunkin was inspired by other creators online to make a new series called The Secret Life of Components that was distributed on YouTube beginning in March 2021. A second installment was distributed beginning 30 March 2022. 

===Books===
Hunkin has published several books in his distinctive cartoon style. His first was a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Mrs Gronkwonk and the Post Office Tower&quot; () in 1973, which he recently made available again at Lulu.com. In 1988 he published &quot;Almost Everything There Is To Know&quot;, a compilation of his comic strip &quot;The Rudiments of Wisdom&quot;, first published in &quot;The Observer&quot;. He is also the author of the book &quot;Hunkin&#x27;s Experiments&quot; which describes a variety of science-based pranks, games, and curiosities. Content from both books is freely available online.

<text>Tama Janowitz (born April 12, 1956) is an American novelist and a short story writer. She is often referenced as one of the main &quot;brat pack&quot; authors, along with Bret Easton Ellis and Jay McInerney. Her novel-in-stories &quot;Slaves of New York&quot; (1986) was adapted into the movie of the same name in 1989.

==Life and career==
Her parents, psychiatrist Julian Janowitz and Phyllis Janowitz (née Winer), a literature professor at Cornell University, divorced when she was ten. She and her brother David grew up with her mother in Massachusetts, and, for two years in the late 1960s, in Israel.

Janowitz graduated from Barnard College with a B.A. in 1977 and from Hollins College with an M.A. in 1979. In 1985 she received an M.F.A from the Columbia University School of the Arts.

Upon settling in New York City, Janowitz started writing about life there, becoming well-known in Manhattan literary and social circles. She began socializing with pop artist Andy Warhol through her relationship with artist Ronnie Cutrone. Janowitz&#x27;s collection of short stories, &quot;Slaves of New York&quot;, brought her wider fame in 1986. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described the book as seven stories featuring a woman named Eleanor, &quot;a diffident young woman who gains entree to the arty milieu of lower Manhattan, which seems to combine elements of Oz and Never-Never-Land with Dante&#x27;s Inferno.&quot; Warhol mentioned in his diary that the characters Eleanor and Stash in the stories are based on Janowitz and Cutrone. The book was adapted into the 1989 film &quot;Slaves of New York&quot;, which was directed by James Ivory and starring Bernadette Peters. Janowitz wrote the screenplay and also appeared, playing Peters&#x27; friend.

Janowitz has published seven novels, one collection of stories and one work of nonfiction. She left Manhattan to live in Brooklyn with her British husband and art-gallery owner, Tim Hunt, and their daughter. She now lives near Ithaca, New York.

Her memoir, &quot;Scream: A Memoir of Glamour and Dysfunction&quot;, was published in August 2016 to reviews both positive and negative. In &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, Ada Calhoun noted Janowitz&#x27;s deadpan, almost careless way of looking at her own life and the glamor of hanging out with Andy Warhol and dancing at Studio 54. The review also addressed the concern with material goods and financial security that drives many of Janowitz&#x27;s novels and led her to appear in ads for Amaretto and other products. Calhoun wrote, &quot;This memoir—which spans her childhood (partly spent in 1968 Israel, where her family was booted from a hotel for not paying), her adventuresome youth (she had a fling with a 63-year-old Lawrence Durrell when she was 19), her career struggles and successes, and her more recent life as caretaker to her dying mother — shows that she comes by her obsession with money honestly.&quot;

<doc id="878427" wikidata="Q333563" url="?curid=878427" title="Niccolò dell'Abbate">
<text>Niccolò dell&#x27;Abbate, sometimes Nicolò and Abate (1509 or 15121571) was a Mannerist Italian painter in fresco and oils. He was of the Emilian school, and was part of the team of artists called the School of Fontainebleau that introduced the Italian Renaissance to France. He may be found indexed under either &quot;Niccolò&quot; or &quot;Abbate&quot;, though the former is more correct.

==Biography==
Niccolò dell&#x27;Abbate was born in Modena, the son of a violinist.

He trained together with Alberto Fontana in the studio of Antonio Begarelli, a local Modenese sculptor; early influences included Ferrarese painters such as Garofalo and Dosso Dossi. He specialized in long friezes with secular and mythological subjects, including for the &quot;Palazzo dei Beccherie&quot; (1537); in various rooms of the &quot;Rocca di Scandiano&quot; owned by the counts Boiardo (whom he portrayed in the late 1530s) he created 12 frescoes, one for each book of &quot;The Aeneid&quot;, and notably a courtly ceiling &quot;Concert&quot; composed of a ring of young musicians seen in perspective, &quot;Sotto in Su&quot; (early 1540s), and the Hercules Room in the &quot;Rocca Meli Lupi&quot; at Soragna (c. 1540–43), and possibly the loggia frescoes removed from Palazzo Casotti at Reggio Emilia.

His style was modified by exposure to Correggio and Parmigianino, when he moved to Bologna in 1547. In Bologna, most of his painting depicted elaborate landscapes and aristocratic genre scenes of hunting and courtly loves, often paralleled in mythologic narratives. It was during this time that he decorated the &quot;Palazzo Poggi&quot;, and executed a cycle of frescoes illustrating &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; in the ducal palace at Sassuolo, near Modena. Bologna is also the location of his illustrations for Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;, and where he was celebrated in a sonnet which compares him to Raphael and Titian among others. One of his early pieces that cemented his reputation was the &quot;Martyrdom of St. Peter and St. Paul&quot;, in the church of the abbey of San Pietro, Modena.

He spent 1548 through 1552 in Bologna, where he gained influence from Correggio and Parmigianino. His surviving stucco-surface landscape in the Palazzo dell&#x27;Università shows his maturing style.

In 1552, Niccolò moved to France, where he worked at the royal Château de Fontainebleau as a member of the decorating team under the direction of Francesco Primaticcio. Within two years of his arrival he was drawing a project for a decor commemorating Anne de Montmorency (preparatory drawing at the Louvre). In Paris, he frescoed the chapel ceiling in the Hôtel de Guise (destroyed), following Primaticcio&#x27;s designs. He also executed private commissions for portable canvases of mythological subjects sited in landscapes. He designed a series of tapestries titles &quot;Les Mois Arabesques&quot;, some of which were used by the painted enamel industry of Limoges. Much of his output reflected an often overlooked function of artists of the time: the ephemeral festive decorations erected to celebrate special occasions in the court circle, for example, the decorations for the triumphal entry into Paris staged for Charles IX and his bride Elisabeth of Austria. His final pieces, in 1571, were 16 murals which were done with the assistance of his son Giulio Camillo. That year, Niccolò died in Fontainebleau, France.

Niccolò&#x27;s great-nephew, Ercole Abbate of Modena (1573–1613), was one of his pupils.

==Works==
Niccolò is best known for his mythological landscape subjects, which introduced the Flemish world landscape into French art, such as the &quot;Orpheus and Landscape with the Death of Eurydice&quot; in the National Gallery, London and the &quot;Rape of Proserpine&quot; in the Louvre, and for his profuse and elegant drawings. Not many of his frescoes have survived; however, the Louvre does have a collection of his drawings. Many of his canvasses were burnt in 1643, by the Austrian regent, Anne. Some of his landscapes for Charles IX were influential for the 17th century painters Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin.

<text>The Roaring River is a tributary of the Cumberland River in the U.S. state of Tennessee. Via the Cumberland and Ohio rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed.

It rises on the Highland Rim approximately south of Livingston, Tennessee in Overton County. It initially flows roughly north, then turns largely west for the balance of its course. After crossing into Jackson County, it begins a relatively steep descent, resulting in the namesake &quot;roar&quot; during periods of high flow. The lower portion of its course is designated as a &quot;State Scenic River&quot; under the terms of the Tennessee Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.

The Roaring River empties into the Cordell Hull Lake impoundment of the Cumberland River. A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers recreation area is at and around the actual confluence, which is very near the Jackson County seat of Gainesboro.

<text>Richard Topcliffe (14 November 1531 – late 1604) was a priest hunter and practitioner of torture during the reign of Elizabeth I of England. A landowner and Member of Parliament, he became notorious as the government&#x27;s chief enforcer of the penal laws against the practice of Catholicism.

== Early life ==
Topcliffe was the eldest son of Robert Topcliffe of Somerby, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Thomas Burgh, 1st Baron Burgh of Gainsborough, who had been chamberlain of the household to queen Anne Boleyn. His uncle Edward Burgh was queen Katherine Parr&#x27;s first husband — so Topcliffe was extremely well-connected. When his father died in 1544, the twelve-year-old Topcliffe became the ward of his uncle, Sir Anthony Neville. In 1548, aged sixteen, like other well-to-do young Elizabethan gentlemen he entered Gray&#x27;s Inn, though he never practised law. On coming of age in 1553, he entered upon a large property, over 4,000 acres.

== Career ==
According to his own account, he entered the service of the Queen in 1557, a year before her accession to the throne, when they were both in their mid-twenties, but he did not begin his service of the state until the Northern Rebellion of 1569 when he armed a troop of thirty horses at his own expense. In his early years, too, he had served the 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, but then became one of Leicester&#x27;s men. There is no foundation for the frequently-repeated assertion that he worked for Burghley and Walsingham. As an independent, self-financed operator with his own squadron of &quot;instruments&quot; as he called them, he worked with both Burghley and Walsingham under commission from the Privy Council, and was on very good terms with them both, though he always considered himself the Queen&#x27;s personal servant and friend.

He represented Beverley in Parliament in 1572. He would later return to Parliament as MP for Old Sarum in 1584 and 1586.

Topcliffe was a tireless agent of the English government&#x27;s determination to eradicate Catholicism from England. At the height of his power, from the late 1580s until 1595, he hunted, captured, arrested, and interrogated many prisoners - often with torture. Topcliffe&#x27;s infamous interrogations took place either in the Tower of London, in Bridewell prison, or even at his own house in Westminster, next to the Gatehouse prison. Exiled Catholic intelligencer Richard Verstegan regularly reported on Topcliffe&#x27;s activities, condemning him &quot;whose inhuman cruelty is so great, as he will not spare to extend any torture whatsoever&quot;. His favourite method (which he may have introduced) was to hang a prisoner by the hands in the gauntlets or manacles, a procedure which, though exquisitely painful, left no permanent injury if properly administered. Improperly administered, it caused permanent internal injury and even death. There is some evidence that he used psychological torture as well, keeping prisoners awake, for instance.

Having seen his prisoners through to trial and condemnation, he would then attend the executions as a kind of master of the ceremonies, usually putting up a notice or &quot;titulus&quot; on the gallows indicating the sufferer&#x27;s name and offence, and making sure that the full rigours of the sentence — hanging, drawing, and quartering while still alive for those convicted of treason — were carried out. Under the law after 1585, merely being a priest in England was treason. The British literary critic Frank Kermode notes in &quot;The Age of Shakespeare&quot; that &quot;Topcliffe&#x27;s copy of a history of the Jesuit mission survives, with his gloating marginalia: beside the name of a missionary the words ‘I racked him,’ beside the name of someone hanged a little stick figure dangling from a gallows.” Unfortunately, Kermode&#x27;s reference cannot be verified, though Topcliffe, whose official police career began with the searching out of Catholic books, was fond of annotating the books he confiscated and kept.

Topcliffe&#x27;s victims included the Jesuits Robert Southwell, and Henry Walpole. Topcliffe features numerous times in John Gerard, S.J.&#x27;s autobiography of his days as a hunted priest in Elizabethan England. In it, he is described as, &quot;old and hoary and a veteran in evil&quot;. In early 1592, he or one of his men, Nicholas Jones, raped or seduced a prisoner in the Gatehouse prison, Anne Bellamy, and persuaded her to arrange the capture of the Jesuit priest Robert Southwell at her family&#x27;s house outside London. When Bellamy married Jones, Topcliffe tried to force her father to give the couple an estate. What became of them is unknown, but the Bellamy family was ruined. Anne Bellamy was the Queen&#x27;s prisoner, and therefore entitled to her protection, yet no action was taken against Topcliffe over this affair, even though the Queen knew about the pregnancy, and knew that Topcliffe had spirited the woman away to his house in Lincolnshire.

In August 1597, the Council commissioned Topcliffe to investigate the play by Ben Jonson and Thomas Nashe, &quot;The Isle of Dogs&quot;, which upset the authorities so badly. Fortunately for Jonson, by then Topcliffe&#x27;s general commission had been withdrawn, and his power much curtailed, though he never lost favour with the Queen and the Cecils. It is possible, though unlikely, that he initiated the inquiry.

== The Fitzherberts ==
Topcliffe, who was engaged in a long-running attempt to destroy the Catholic Fitzherberts of Derbyshire and Staffordshire, persuaded Sir Thomas Fitzherbert&#x27;s heir, also Thomas, to assist him. He entered into a bond under which Thomas Fitzherbert would pay him £3,000 for bringing about the deaths of his uncle Sir Thomas, his father John, and a cousin, William Bassett. The uncle and the father died in prison, and the cousin remained alive. When Fitzherbert refused to pay up, Topcliffe sued him in Chancery for the money. Scandalised, the Privy Council intervened. Topcliffe insulted them, and they put him in prison. The Queen released him after a couple of weeks in response to his personal letters to her. He did not get the money, but he had succeeded in tricking Thomas into deeding an estate in Padley, Derbyshire, to him. Under King James I, though, the 7th Earl of Shrewsbury ejected him, and the Fitzherberts recovered the property.

== Death ==
Topcliffe died in November or December 1604 at the age of about 73. His heir, Charles, succeeded to a heavily encumbered estate. Like Walsingham, Topcliffe impoverished himself by his service to the crown.

== Depictions ==
Richard Topcliffe was portrayed by Brian Wilde in the 1971 British television mini-series &quot;Elizabeth R&quot;. Topcliffe is featured in Rory Clements&#x27; &quot;John Shakespeare&quot; murder mystery novel series as a sadistic torturer. Topcliffe is also portrayed as a torturer and persecutor of Catholics in the Sir Robert Carey and James Enys novels by P.F. Chisholm/Patricia Finney.

Topcliffe is portrayed by Ewen Bremner in the 2017 American television series &quot;Will&quot;, a fictional look at the life of young William Shakespeare. In the series, Shakespeare bases the scheming title character of &quot;Richard III&quot; on Topcliffe.

Topcliffe is the master villain in the latter half of Robert Hugh Benson&#x27;s 1912 novel, &quot;Come Rack! Come Rope!&quot;, in which the Topcliffe character pursues and ultimately executes several priests, including Edmund Campion and the protagonist of the novel, Robin Audrey.

In Modern literature in Irish, Topcliffe is fictionalised as the malevolent priest hunter Elias Creepe in Liam Mac Cóil&#x27;s 2014 prizewinning novel &quot;I dTír Strainséartha&quot; (In a Strange Land).

==Quote==
The morrow after Simon and Jude&#x27;s day I was hanged at the wall from the ground, my manacles fast locked into a staple as high as I could reach upon a stool: the stool taken away where I hanged from a little after 8 o&#x27;clock in the morning till after 4 in the afternoon, without any ease or comfort at all, saving that Topcliffe came in and told me that the Spaniards were come into Southwark by our means: &quot;For lo, do you not hear the drums&quot; (for then the drums played in honour of the Lord Mayor). The next day after also I was hanged up an hour or two: such is the malicious minds of our adversaries.—Saint Eustace White, S.J., written to Father Henry Garnet from prison. 23 November 1591. Quoted in &quot;The Other Face; Catholic Life Under Elizabeth I,&quot; by Father Philip Caraman, pages 235–236.
The Chief Justice asked how old he was, seeming to scorn his youth. He answered that he was near about the age of our Saviour, Who lived upon the earth thirty-three years; and he himself was as he thought near about thirty-four years. Hereat Topcliffe seemed to make great acclamation, saying that he compared himself to Christ. Mr. Southwell answered, &quot;No he was a humble worm created by Christ.&quot; &quot;Yes&quot;, said Topcliffe, &quot;you are Christ&#x27;s fellow.&quot;—Father Henry Garnet, &quot;Account of the Trial of Robert Southwell.&quot; Quoted in Caraman&#x27;s &quot;The Other Face&quot;, page 230.

<doc id="878446" wikidata="Q5153075" url="?curid=878446" title="Committee on Jewish Law and Standards">
<text>The Committee on Jewish Law and Standards is the central authority on halakha (Jewish law and tradition) within Conservative Judaism; it is one of the most active and widely known committees on the Conservative movement&#x27;s Rabbinical Assembly. Within the movement it is known as the CJLS. The current chairman of the CJLS is Rabbi Pamela Barmash.

== History ==
The Committee on Jewish Law was created by the Rabbinical Assembly (RA) in 1927. Max Drob was the first chair of the committee. The committee was tasked with including representatives from the &quot;Various tendencies&quot; of the Rabbinical Assembly. Of the ten members of the committee, four were to represent a &quot;more conservative tendency,&quot; four were to represent &quot;the liberal tendency,&quot; and two more were to be chosen by the eight. The more conservative rabbis on the initial committee were Louis Epstein, Louis Finkelstein, Julius Greenstone, and Chairman Drob. The liberals were Mordecai Kaplan, Jacob Kohn, Herman Rubenovitz, and Solomon Goldman. The two additional members were Harry S. Davidowitz and Morris Levine. Drob viewed the creation of the committee as &quot;the first step towards the organization of an American &quot;beit din hagadol&quot; [supreme court of Jewish law] which will study the problems arising in our new environment and solve them in the spirit of our Torah.&quot;

Drob was succeeded by Julius Greenstone, who chaired the committee from 1932 to 1936 and Louis Epstein (1936–1940). Boaz Cohen, a professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, served as chair from 1940 to 1948.

In 1948, the committee was expanded to 25 members and renamed the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards. The new name signaled the Rabbinical Assembly&#x27;s hopes that Jewish practice should be guided by the highest moral standards along with traditional law. The committee was tasked with &quot;raising the standards of piety, understanding, and participating in Jewish life&quot; among Conservative Jews. In 1986 Amy Eilberg became the first woman appointed to serve on the committee.

In 1950, Rabbi Milton Steinberg was notably still listed as a consultant to the committee while also being listed as deceased.

In 1949, the Rabbinical Assembly commissioned a &quot;Special Committee on Scope of the Law Committee.&quot; This special committee was chaired by Rabbi Israel H. Levinthal and included Rabbis Morris Adler, Ben Zion Bokser, Max D. Davidson, Ira Eisenstein and Theodore Friedman. The special committee lasted through 1950.

== Process ==
Conservative rabbis hold that the boundaries of Jewish law are determined through the halakhic process, a religious-ethical system of legal precedents. In this system, one may re-interpret or change the law through a formal argument. These arguments are effectively peer-reviewed. When a rabbi proposes a new interpretation of a law, that interpretation is not normative for the Jewish community until it becomes accepted by other committed and observant members in the community. New legal precedents are based on the standard codes of Jewish law, and the responsa literature. The Hebrew term for the responsa is &#x27;&quot;She&#x27;elot U-Teshuvot&quot;&#x27;, literally &quot;Questions and Answers&quot;.

There is no formal peer-review process for the entire Jewish community in general, since the Jewish community has no one central body that speaks for all of Judaism. However, within certain Jewish communities formal organized bodies exist: Each strand of Orthodox Hasidic Judaism has their own rebbe, who is their ultimate decisor of Jewish law. Within Modern Orthodox Judaism, there is no one committee or leader, but Modern Orthodox rabbis generally agree with the views set by consensus by the leaders of the Rabbinical Council of America. Within Conservative Judaism, the Rabbinical Assembly has the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards.

Conservative Judaism teaches that one can make use of literary and historical analysis to understand how Jewish law has developed, and to help them understand how such laws should be understood in our own day. It generally view the laws and customs from the various law codes as the basis for normative Jewish law. Solomon Schechter writes &quot;however great the literary value of a code may be, it does not invest it with infallibility, nor does it exempt it from the student or the Rabbi who makes use of it from the duty of examining each paragraph on its own merits, and subjecting it to the same rules of interpretation that were always applied to Tradition&quot;.

In fundamental ways Orthodox Judaism has a significantly different understanding of how halakha is determined; thus Orthodox rabbis generally do not respect the decisions of the CJLS as valid or normative.

The CJLS is composed of 25 rabbis (voting members), and five laypeople, who participate in deliberations but who do not have a vote. When any six (or more) members vote in favor of a position, that position becomes an official position of the committee. Any particular issue can generate from one to four official positions. When multiple positions are validated, they usually have much common ground.

When more than one position is validated, a congregation&#x27;s rabbi functions as its &quot;mara de-atra&quot; (local authority), adopting for their congregation the position he or she considers most compelling. As Aaron Mackler states:
&quot;The positions authorized by the Committee offer important guidance for Conservative Jews and others. Still, each Conservative rabbi has the authority to make halakhic judgments. Eash rabbi formulates decisions about numerous issues not discussed explicitly by the Committee, relying on other halakhic sources and his or her own judgment. For issues the Committee has addressed, each rabbi may choose among various positions endorsed by the Committee, or may even find a different position best mandated by halakhah.&quot;

Gordon Tucker has argued that RA members should give &quot;extraordinary weight&quot; to CJLS decisions, while remaining free to disagree with then:

Because it is a body that seeks to coalesce judgment around particular halakhic opinions, and not simply to give voice to individually held positions, it is right and proper that six members of the CJLS be required to define an authoritative position. Because it is a body that is ultimately here to provide service and guidance to Rabbinical Assembly members, it is also right and proper that authoritative opinions not be categorized by the number of votes they received, and that they not be binding on Rabbinical Assembly members in a coercive sense, but rather only in the sense that we are bound by our covenant to one another to give extraordinary weight to CJLS responsa in reaching our own legal decisions. Should an RA member choose, upon study and consideration, not to follow any CJLS position on a given matter, he or she would thus be unable to claim any authority or backing for that position from the CJLS, a &quot;sanction&quot; which in some circumstances could be substantial, in others not.

While responsa are not enforceable on rabbis, there are a few standards of rabbinic practice which are enforced by the RA. Willful violations of these standards have led to resignations or expulsions from membership of the Rabbinical Assembly (RA). At present, three standards of rabbinic practice have been issued, containing four rules:

:1) A complete prohibition on rabbis and cantors to officiate in any way at intermarriages.

:2) A complete prohibition against officiating at the remarriage of a Jew whose previous marriage has not been halakhically terminated, whether by a halakhic divorce [get], hafka&#x27;at Kiddushin [annulment], or death.

:3a) A complete prohibition against taking any action that would intimate that native Jewishness can be confirmed in any way but matrilineal descent.

:3b) A complete prohibition against supervising a conversion to Judaism that does not include circumcision for males, and immersion in a Mikvah for both males and females.

== Responsa ==
A separate article exists on Conservative responsa, the body of responsa created by Conservative rabbis (primarily by the CJLS.)

== Difference in methodology from Orthodoxy ==
A key practical difference between Conservative and Orthodox approaches to halakhah is that Conservative Judaism holds that rabbis in our day and age are empowered to issue &quot;takkanot&quot; (decrees) modifying Biblical prohibitions, when perceived to be necessary.

The Conservative position is that the Talmud states that in exceptional cases rabbis have the right to uproot Biblical prohibitions for a variety of reasons; it gives examples of how this was done in practice, e.g. Talmud Bavli, tractate Yevamot 89a-90b, and tractate Nazir 43a. See the discussion by Rabbi Arnold Goodman in &quot;Solemnizing the Marriage Between a Kohen and a Divorcee&quot; p. 2 (bottom) p. 3 (top.) Goodman notes that &quot;Later authorities were reluctant to assume such unilateral authority... Later authorities thus imposed severe limitations on the conditions and situations where it would be appropriate and necessary to uproot..&quot; but then states on p. 3 that &quot;Yet the right to uproot was never completely prohibited. There was often the need for an escape hatch, and the right of Rabbinic authorities to do so was articulated by the Rashba as follows: It was not a matter of the sages deciding on their own to uproot a matter of the Torah, but it is one of the mitzvot in the Torah to obey the &#x27;judges in your day&#x27; and anything they see necessary to permit is permissible from the Torah.&quot; (Chidushai Rashba, Nedarim, p. 90b)

Conservative Jewish philosophy does not allow the use of popular will to overturn Biblical or rabbinic laws. Conservative Judaism requires responsa citing a full range of precedential authorities as part of any halakhic decision. Changes in halakhah must come about through the halakhic process. For examples of this view see Rabbi David Golinkin&#x27;s essay &quot;The Whys and Hows of Conservative Halakhah,&quot; Elliot N. Dorff&#x27;s &quot;The Unfolding Tradition&quot; (esp. introduction and chapter 1), Joel Roth &quot;The Halakhic Process&quot; (Chapter 1, but throughout the entire book)

The CJLS has on a number of occasions accepted teshuvot which include moral and aggadadic reasoning alongside and within a precedent-based halakhic framework. As such they often come to conclusions that differ from their Orthodox peers.

=== Takkanot: Significant legislative changes in Jewish law ===
The CJLS has passed &quot;takkanot&quot; which significantly change Jewish law. The following is a list of such takkanot; note that the reasoning behind these changes is not here explained in depth; for details please see the Conservative Halakha article.

* Driving to synagogue on Shabbat. The CJLS accepted a responsa which holds that if a person rides to synagogue on Shabbat with the intention of fulfilling various Shabbat mitzvot, and that if no other driving on Shabbat is done, than that person will not be held as being in violation of halakhah. (&quot;Responsum on the Sabbath&quot; by Rabbis Morris Adler, Jacob B. Agus and Theodore Friedman.)
* The CJLS issued emergency takkanot effectively lifting biblical restrictions on Kohen marriages. These responsa argue that the high rate of intermarriage and need to keep married Jews in the Jewish community meets traditional rabbinic standards for such actions, and notes &quot;Should the current rate of intermarriage be reversed, a future Law Committee may well decide to review this issue. At this time, however, we face a crisis of such proportion that we dare not, in good conscience, stand between the marriage of two Jews whose union as forbidden by virtue of his being a Kohen and she a divorcee. Our steadfast refusal to solemnize their marriage, or even to agree to do this only after seeking to dissuade them, may well lead the couple to be married either in a civil ceremony or in a ceremony without full chuppah and kiddushin. ...&quot;
* The CJLS effectively passed a takkanah ruling that women may be counted as witnesses in all areas of Jewish law. The CJLS does not view this as a change in Torah law, but rather as a lifting of a rabbinical prohibition that was rooted in social dynamics. See Myron S. Geller, &quot;Woman is Eligible to Testify&quot;; Susan Grossman, &quot;Edut Nashim k&#x27;Edut Anashim: The Testimony of Women is as the Testimony of Men&quot; and Joseph H. Prouser, &quot;On Women Serving as Witnesses–A Dissent&quot;.
* The CJLS passed a takkanah which allowed Jewish women to count in the prayer minyan. In August 1973 a motion was passed which stated that &quot;Men and women should be counted equally for a minyan.&quot;, with nine in favor and four opposed.

In other areas the CJLS did not issue takkanot, but found procedures to follow classical halakhah while maintaining what they view as the highest standards of moral behavior. For instance:

* The CJLS, in declaring that its rabbis would not accept evidence or entertain questions as to the existence of &quot;mamzerim&quot;, declared that Biblical law represents only the beginning of a relationship with the divine and that in the Conservative movement, biblical law can be overridden on grounds of inconsistency with contemporary morality because &quot;Aggadah controls Halacha&quot;.
* In December 2006, a majority vote of the CJLS (13 members for, 12 against) accepted a controversial responsum that allows homosexual Jews to become rabbis and cantors. The responsum was titled &quot;Homosexuality, Human Dignity &amp; Halakhah&quot;, and it was written by Rabbis Elliot N. Dorff, Daniel S. Nevins, and Avram I. Reisner. The responsum abolished rabbinic laws restricting homosexual conduct other than male-male anal sex, concluding that the CJLS has authority to do this on grounds of the talmudic principle of Kavod HaBriyot, which it translated as &quot;human dignity&quot;, on grounds that the existence of such sexual restraints represents an affront to human dignity as modern society perceives it. Four members of the CJLS resigned to protest this decision.
*In December, 2006, a majority vote of the CJLS (13 members for) also adopted a responsum titled &quot;Homosexuality Revisited&quot;, written by Rabbi Joel Roth, maintaining the traditional prohibitions on homosexual conduct. The Roth responsum maintained that the Dorff responsum was untenable, claiming that virtually all classical authorities hold that the Biblical prohibition extends to a wider range of homosexual conduct. It also claimed that the concept of Kavod HaBriyot, which it translated as &quot;respect&quot; or &quot;honor&quot;, permits setting aside rabbinic prohibitions in deference to others&#x27; honor, but does not permit setting aside prohibitions set up for God&#x27;s honor in deference to one&#x27;s own.
* In 2011, the responsum &quot;The Status of the Heresh [one who is deaf] and of Sign Language&quot; was unanimously passed by the CJLS. This responsa declared that, among other things, &quot;The Committee on Jewish Law and Standards rules that the deaf who communicate via sign language and do not speak are no longer to be considered mentally incapacitated. Jews who are deaf are responsible for observing mitzvot. Our communities, synagogues, schools, and camps must strive to be welcoming and accessible, and inclusive. Sign language may be used in matters of personal status and may be used in rituals. A deaf person called to the Torah who does not speak may recite the berakhot in sign language. A deaf person may serve as a shaliah tzibbur in sign language in a minyan whose medium of communication is sign language.

== Criticisms of the CJLS ==
There exist significant disagreements in the interpretation of Jewish law between all Jewish groups, even different groups within the same denomination (for instance, there are half a dozen large, different Orthodox Jewish rabbinical groups, none of which accepts the rulings of the other as necessarily correct or authoritative.

Rabbi Joel Roth (cited above as one of the two opinions on the issue of homosexuals serving as rabbis) left the CJLS after the ruling on homosexual rabbis. He does not agree with Rabbi David Wolpe that the Conservative movement is not halakhic, and in fact publicly reaffirmed his commitment to staying in the Conservative movement and in the movement&#x27;s Rabbinical Assembly. However, he felt that the members of the CJLS were no longer following the parameters of the halakhic system, and as such quit the CJLS.

Of the criticism of the committee are its voting methods. Currently, as stated, a position must garner six votes to be held as legitimatized view. In times past, it was one. This has caused many to claim that the committee is very waved by popular opinion and creates inner fractions instead of attempting to making a conclusive ruling.

When dealing with rulings on Jewish law between entirely different denominations (Orthodox vs. Conservative, Conservative vs. Reform, etc.) it is thus to be expected that significant disagreements can be found.

As well, there is also a more extreme criticism that the committee is a failure in being able to balance modernity and traditional practice. Citing for example the &quot;takana&quot; of driving on Shabbat for the exclusive purpose of going back and forth to synagogue, critics note today few Conservative actually just drive to synagogue (including the Rabbinical and Lay leadership) while some do not drive at all. Meaning that neither those who drive nor decide to refrain completely from driving have any revelancy to the original committee&#x27;s decision, which in effect just allowed the doing whatever the individual member of the movement wanted to do based on everything but the committee itself. The explanation by many critics that the committee would rather try to please everyone within its broad tent than make a decision that would be considered more correct but in any way controversial (thus the wanting to approve all sides of all controversies.) Also explained as an overemphasis of modern political and philosophical thought over traditional Jewish thought.

<doc id="878457" wikidata="Q244978" url="?curid=878457" title="Grande Comore">
<text>Grande Comore (; ) is an island in Comoros off the coast of Africa. It is the largest island in the Comoros nation. Most of its population is of the Comorian ethnic group. Its population is about 316,600. The island&#x27;s capital is Moroni, which is also the national capital. The island is made up of two shield volcanoes, with Mount Karthala being the country&#x27;s highest point at above sea level. According to the 2009 revision of the constitution of 2002, it is governed by an elected Governor, as are the other islands, with the federal government being much reduced in power. The name Ngazidja is sometimes seen in the now nonstandard form Njazidja.

==History==

For several centuries, Grande Comore was divided into a number of sultanates, including Bambao, Itsandra, Mitsamihuli, Mbajini, Hambuu, Washili, Hamahame, Mbwankuu, Mbude and Domba. The sultans were also known as &quot;mfaume&quot;. In 1886, the ruler of Anjouan, Sultan Said Ali bin Said Omar declared a &quot;state of Ngazidja&quot;, usurping the other sultanates and accepting a French protectorate over the island. In 1893, Sultan Said Ali was sent into exile on Réunion. In 1908, France annexed the island and the sultanates were abolished. In 1975, Grande Comore, Anjouan and Mohéli declared independence as the nation of Comoros.

On 23 November 1996, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961 was hijacked while in Ethiopian airspace en route from Addis Ababa to Nairobi. The Boeing 767-260ER crash-landed in the Indian Ocean near Grande Comore after running out of fuel, killing 125 out of the 175 people on board, including 3 of the hijackers.

In 1997, the Comoros nation began to fall apart as Anjouan and Moheli seceded. Grande Comore became the only island under federal control. By 2002, however, Grande Comore was reunited with the other islands under the new constitution. Abdou Soule Elbak was elected President of Grande Comore in May 2002. He received only 17% of the vote in the first round, coming in first place, and received 60% of the vote in the runoff. He remained in his post until the July 2007 elections, at which point Mohamed Abdoulwahab won the island&#x27;s presidency. The position of the President of Grande Comore was later transferred into the position of Governor of Grande Comore.

<text>The Spanish treasure fleet, or West Indies Fleet (, also called silver fleet or plate fleet; from the meaning &quot;silver&quot;), was a convoy system of sea routes organized by the Spanish Empire from 1566 to 1790, which linked Spain with its territories in the Americas across the Atlantic. The convoys were general purpose cargo fleets used for transporting a wide variety of items, including agricultural goods, lumber, various metal resources such as silver and gold, gems, pearls, spices, sugar, tobacco, silk, and other exotic goods from the overseas territories of the Spanish Empire to the Spanish mainland. Spanish goods such as oil, wine, textiles, books and tools were transported in the opposite direction.

The West Indies fleet was the first permanent transatlantic trade route in history. Similarly, the related Manila galleon trade was the first permanent trade route across the Pacific. The Spanish West and East Indies fleets are considered among the most successful naval operations in history and, from a commercial point of view, they made possible key components of today&#x27;s global economy.

==History==
===Origin===

Spanish ships had carried goods from the New World since Christopher Columbus&#x27;s first expedition of 1492. The organized system of convoys dates from 1564, but Spain sought to protect shipping prior to that by organizing protection around the largest Caribbean island, Cuba, and the maritime region of southern Spain and the Canary Islands because of attacks by pirates and foreign navies. In the 1560s, the Spanish government created a system of convoys in response to the sacking of Havana by French privateers.

The main procedures were established based on the recommendations of Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, an experienced admiral and personal adviser of King Philip II. The treasure fleets sailed along two sea lanes. The main one was the Caribbean Spanish West Indies fleet or &quot;Flota de Indias&quot;, which departed in two convoys from Seville, where the &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot; was based, bound for ports such as Veracruz, Portobelo and Cartagena before making a rendezvous at Havana in order to return together to Spain. A secondary route was that of the Manila Galleons or &quot;Galeón de Manila&quot;, which linked the Philippines to Acapulco in Mexico across the Pacific Ocean. From Acapulco, the Asian goods were transhipped by mule train to Veracruz to be loaded onto the Caribbean treasure fleet for shipment to Spain. To better defend this trade, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés and Álvaro de Bazán designed the definitive model of the galleon in the 1550s.

===&quot;Casa de Contratación&quot;===

Spain controlled the trade through the &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot; based in Seville, a river port in southern Spain. By law, the colonies could trade only with Seville, the one designated port in the mother country. Maritime archaeology has shown that the quantity of goods transported was sometimes higher than that recorded at the &quot;Archivo General de Indias&quot;. Spanish merchants and Spaniards acting as fronts (&quot;cargadores&quot;) for foreign merchants sent their goods on these fleets to the New World. Some resorted to contraband to transport their cargoes untaxed. The Crown of Spain taxed the wares and precious metals of private merchants at a rate of 20%, a tax known as the &quot;quinto real&quot; or royal fifth.

By the end of the 16th century, Spain became the richest country in Europe. Much of the wealth from this trade was used by the Spanish Habsburgs to finance armies to protect its European territories in the 16th and 17th centuries against the Ottoman Empire and most of the major European powers. The flow of precious metals in and out of Spain also stimulated the European economy as a whole.

The flow of precious metals made many traders wealthy, both in Spain and abroad. As a result of the discovery of precious metals in Spanish America, Spain&#x27;s money supply increased tenfold. The increase in gold and silver on the Iberian market caused high inflation in the 17th century, affecting the Spanish economy. As a consequence, the Crown was forced to delay the payment of some major debts, which had negative consequences for its creditors, mostly foreign bankers. By 1690 some of these creditors could no longer offer financial support to the Crown. The Spanish monopoly over its West and East Indies colonies lasted for over two centuries.

===Decline, revival and abolition===
The economic importance of exports later declined with the drop in production of the American precious metal mines, such as Potosí. However, the growth in trade was strong in the early years. Numbering 17 ships in 1550, the fleets expanded to more than 50 much larger vessels by the end of the century. By the second half of the 17th century, that number had dwindled to less than half of its peak. As economic conditions gradually recovered from the last decades of the 17th century, fleet operations slowly expanded again, once again becoming prominent during the reign of the Bourbons in the 18th century.

The Spanish trade of goods was sometimes threatened by its colonial rivals, who tried to seize islands as bases along the Spanish Main and in the Spanish West Indies. However, the Atlantic trade was largely unharmed. The English acquired small islands like St Kitts in 1624; expelled in 1629, they returned in 1639 and seized Jamaica in 1655. French pirates established themselves in Saint-Domingue in 1625, were expelled, only to return later, and the Dutch occupied Curaçao in 1634. Other losses to foreign powers came later. In 1713 as part of the Treaty of Utrecht after the War of the Spanish Succession, the Spanish crown was forced to make concessions which included trading privileges for England that violated the previous Spanish monopoly on legal trade to its colonial holdings. In 1739 during the War of Jenkin&#x27;s Ear, the British admirals Francis Hosier and later Edward Vernon blockaded Portobello in an attempt to prevent the return sailing of the treasure fleet. In 1741 Vernon&#x27;s campaign against Cartagena de Indias ended in defeat, with high losses of men and ships. Spain dealt with the temporary British seizures of Havana and Manila (1762–4), during the Seven Years&#x27; War, by using a larger number of smaller fleets visiting a greater variety of ports.

The end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713 marked the beginning of the rule of the Bourbon dynasty over the Spanish Empire, which brought with it the Bourbon Reforms. These reforms, designed to halt Spain&#x27;s decline and increase tax revenue, resulted in a series of changes to the fleet system throughout the 18th century. Philip V began the reforms by sending investigators to report on conditions in Spanish America, who brought back evidence of fraud. He and following Bourbon kings, notably including Charles III, would make a concerted effort to centralize the administration of Spanish America and more efficiently tax profits from overseas trade. One of these reforms was the granting of trading monopolies for certain regions to trading companies ran by peninsulares, such as the Guipuzcoan Company. Another involved the increased use of registered ships, or &quot;navíos de registro&quot;, traveling solo outside the fleet system to transport goods. These reforms gradually decreased reliance on the escorted convoys of the fleet system. In the 1780s, Spain opened its colonies to freer trade. In 1790, the &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot; was abolished, bringing to an end the great general purpose cargo convoys. Thereafter small groups of naval frigates were assigned specifically to transferring bullion as required.

==The fleets==

Every year, two fleets left Spain loaded with European goods in demand in Spanish America; they were guarded by military vessels. Valuable cargo from the Americas, most significantly silver from Mexico and Peru, were sent back to Spain. Fleets of fifty or more ships sailed from Spain, one bound for the Mexican port of Veracruz and the other for Panama and Cartagena. From the Spanish ports of Seville or Cádiz, the two fleets bound for the Americas sailed together down the coast of Africa, and stopped at the Spanish territory of the Canary Islands for provisions before the voyage across the Atlantic. Once the two fleets reached the Caribbean, the fleets separated. The New Spain fleet sailed to Veracruz in Mexico to load not only silver and the valuable red dye cochineal, but also porcelain and silk shipped from China on the Manila galleons. The Asian goods were carried overland from Acapulco to Veracruz by mule train.

The &quot;Tierra Firme&quot; fleet, or galeones, sailed to Cartagena to load South American products, especially silver from Potosí. Some ships went to Portobello on the Caribbean coast of Panama to load Peruvian silver. This had been shipped from the Pacific coast port of Callao and transported across the isthmus of Panama by mule. Other ships went to the Caribbean island of Margarita, off the coast of Venezuela, to collect pearls which had been harvested from offshore oyster beds. After loading was complete, both fleets sailed for Havana, Cuba, to rendezvous for the journey back to Spain.

The overland journey by mule train, as well as supplies provided by local farmers to prepare the fleets for long ocean voyages, invigorated the economy of colonial Spanish America. Preparation and the transport of goods required porters, innkeepers, and foodstuffs to help facilitate travel. However, in Mexico in 1635, there was an increase of the sales tax levied to finance the fleet, the Armada de Barlovento.

Between 1703 and 1705 Spanish corsair Amaro Pargo began to participate in the West Indies Fleet. In this period he was the owner and captain of the frigate &quot;El Ave María y Las Ánimas&quot;, a ship which he sailed from the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife to Havana. He reinvested the benefits of the Canarian-American trade in his estates, devoted to the cultivation of the grapevines of Malvasía and Vidueño, whose wine products (mainly Vidueño) were sent to America.

==The flow of Spanish treasure==
Walton gives the following figures in pesos. For the 300-year period the peso or piece of eight had about 25 grams of silver, about the same as the German thaler and Dutch rijksdaalder. A single galleon might carry 2 million pesos. The modern approximate value of the estimated 4 billion pesos produced during the period would come to $530 billion or €470 billion (based on silver bullion prices of May 2015). Of the 4 billion pesos produced, 2.5 billion was shipped to Europe, of which 500 million was shipped around Africa to Asia. Of the remaining 1.5 billion 650 million went directly to Asia from Acapulco and 850 million remained in the Western Hemisphere. Little of the wealth stayed in Spain. Of the 11 million arriving in 1590, 2 million went to France for imports, 6 million to Italy for imports and military expenses, of which 2.5 went up the Spanish Road to the Low Countries and 1 million to the Ottoman Empire. 1.5 million was shipped from Portugal to Asia. Of the 2 million pesos reaching the Dutch Republic in that year, 75% went to the Baltic for naval stores and 25% went to Asia. The income of the Spanish crown from all sources was about 2.5 million pesos in 1550, 14 million in the 1590s, about 15 million in 1760 and 30 million in 1780. In 1665 the debts of the Spanish crown were 30 million pesos short-term and 300 million long-term. Most of the New World production was silver, but Colombian mines produced mostly gold. The following table gives the estimated legal production. It necessarily excludes smuggling, which was increasingly important after 1600. The crown legally took one fifth (quinto real) at the source and obtained more through other taxes.

==Losses==
Despite the general perception that many Spanish galleons were captured by foreign privateers and pirates, relatively few ships were lost to Spain&#x27;s enemies in the course of the &quot;flota&#x27;s&quot; two and a half centuries of operation; more flota galleons were lost to hurricanes. Only the Dutch admiral Piet Hein managed to capture an entire fleet, in the Battle in the Bay of Matanzas in 1628, after which its cargo was taken to the Dutch Republic. The English admiral Robert Blake twice attacked the fleet, in the Battle of Cádiz in 1656 and in the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in 1657, but he captured only a single galleon and Spanish officers managed to prevent most of the silver from falling into English hands. 

The West Indies fleet was destroyed in the Battle of Vigo Bay in 1702 during the War of the Spanish Succession, when it was surprised in port unloading its goods, but the Spanish sailors had already unloaded most of its cargo, including all of its silver. None of these attacks took place in open seas. In the case of the Manila galleons, only four were ever captured by British warships: the &quot;Santa Anna&quot; by Thomas Cavendish in 1589, the &quot;Encarnación&quot; by Woodes Rogers in 1709, the &quot;Covadonga&quot; by George Anson in 1743, and the &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; in 1762. The attempts to take the &quot;Rosario&quot; in 1704 and the &quot;Begonia&quot; in 1710 were foiled.

==Famous shipwrecks==
Wrecks of Spanish treasure ships, whether sunk in naval combat or, as was more usually the case, by storms (with the ones which occurred 1622, 1715, 1733 and 1750 being among the worst), are a prime target for modern treasure hunters. Many, such as the &quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot; and the &quot;Santa Margarita&quot;, have been salvaged. In August 1750, at least three Spanish merchantmen ran aground in North Carolina during a hurricane. The &quot;El Salvador&quot; sank near Cape Lookout, the &quot;Nuestra Señora De Soledad&quot; went ashore near present-day Core Banks and the &quot;Nuestra Señora De Guadalupe&quot; went ashore near present-day Ocracoke.

=== Treasure ship &quot;Encarnación&quot;===
The wreck of the Spanish merchant ship &quot;Encarnación&quot;, part of the Tierra Firme fleet, was discovered in 2011 with much of its cargo still aboard and part of its hull intact. The &quot;Encarnación&quot; sank in 1681 during a storm near the mouth of the Chagres River on the Caribbean side of Panama. The &quot;Encarnación&quot; sank in less than 40 feet of water. The remains of the &quot;Urca de Lima&quot; from the 1715 fleet and the &quot;San Pedro&quot; from the 1733 fleet, after being found by treasure hunters, are now protected as Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserves.

===Capitana===
The &quot;Capitana&quot; (&quot;El Rubi&quot;) was the flagship of the 1733 fleet; it ran aground during a hurricane near Upper Matecumbe Key, then sank. Three men died during the storm. Afterward, divers recovered most of the treasure aboard.

The &quot;Capitana&quot; was the first of the 1733 ships to be found again in 1938. Salvage workers recovered items from the sunken ship over more than 10 years. Additional gold was recovered in June 2015. The ship&#x27;s location: is 24° 55.491&#x27; north, 80° 30.891&#x27; west.

===San José===
The &quot;San José&quot; was sunk in 1708 by British forces near Colombian&#x27;s coasts. Its wreckage was discovered in 2015 and is believed to contain the record 17B US$ in gold, silver, and other precious stones. Its place is a national secret. In November 2023 the Colombian government are looking to recover the treasure.

===Nuestra Señora de las Maravillas===
The &quot;Nuestra Señora de las Maravillas&quot; (de) () which had collided with another ship in the fleet suffered damage to its hull and sunk into a coral reef off the Bahamas in January 1656. The ship&#x27;s cargo with almost 3.5 million items was recovered between 1650s and 1990s, while latest discoveries would be exhibited at the Bahamas Maritime Museum.

Ignoring the influence of other Solar System bodies, Earth&#x27;s orbit, also called Earth&#x27;s revolution, is an ellipse with the Earth–Sun barycenter as one focus with a current eccentricity of 0.0167. Since this value is close to zero, the center of the orbit is relatively close to the center of the Sun (relative to the size of the orbit).

As seen from Earth, the planet&#x27;s orbital prograde motion makes the Sun appear to move with respect to other stars at a rate of about 1° eastward per solar day (or a Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours). Earth&#x27;s orbital speed averages , which is fast enough to cover the planet&#x27;s diameter in 7 minutes and the distance to the Moon in 4 hours. The point towards which the Earth in its solar orbit is directed at any given instant is known as the &quot;apex of the Earth&#x27;s way&quot;. 

From a vantage point above the north pole of either the Sun or Earth, Earth would appear to revolve in a counterclockwise direction around the Sun. From the same vantage point, both the Earth and the Sun would appear to rotate also in a counterclockwise direction.

==History of study==

Heliocentrism is the scientific model that first placed the Sun at the center of the Solar System and put the planets, including Earth, in its orbit. Historically, heliocentrism is opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. Aristarchus of Samos already proposed a heliocentric model in the third century BC. In the sixteenth century, Nicolaus Copernicus&#x27; &quot;De revolutionibus&quot; presented a full discussion of a heliocentric model of the universe in much the same way as Ptolemy had presented his geocentric model in the second century. This &quot;Copernican Revolution&quot; resolved the issue of planetary retrograde motion by arguing that such motion was only perceived and apparent. According to historian Jerry Brotton, &quot;Although Copernicus&#x27;s groundbreaking book ... had been [printed more than] a century earlier, [the Dutch mapmaker] Joan Blaeu was the first mapmaker to incorporate his revolutionary heliocentric theory into a map of the world.&quot;

==Influence on Earth==
Because of Earth&#x27;s axial tilt (often known as the obliquity of the ecliptic), the inclination of the Sun&#x27;s trajectory in the sky (as seen by an observer on Earth&#x27;s surface) varies over the course of the year. For an observer at a northern latitude, when the north pole is tilted toward the Sun the day lasts longer and the Sun appears higher in the sky. This results in warmer average temperatures, as additional solar radiation reaches the surface. When the north pole is tilted away from the Sun, the reverse is true and the weather is generally cooler. North of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle, an extreme case is reached in which there is no daylight at all for part of the year, and continuous daylight during the opposite time of year. This is called polar night and midnight sun, respectively. This variation in the weather (because of the direction of the Earth&#x27;s axial tilt) results in the seasons.

==Events in the orbit==

By astronomical convention, the four seasons are determined by the solstices (the two points in the Earth&#x27;s orbit of the maximum tilt of the Earth&#x27;s axis, toward the Sun or away from the Sun) and the equinoxes (the two points in the Earth&#x27;s orbit where the Earth&#x27;s tilted axis and an imaginary line drawn from the Earth to the Sun are exactly perpendicular to one another). The solstices and equinoxes divide the year up into four approximately equal parts. In the northern hemisphere winter solstice occurs on or about December 21; summer solstice is near June 21; spring equinox is around March 20, and autumnal equinox is about September 23. The effect of the Earth&#x27;s axial tilt in the southern hemisphere is the opposite of that in the northern hemisphere, thus the seasons of the solstices and equinoxes in the southern hemisphere are the reverse of those in the northern hemisphere (e.g. the northern summer solstice is at the same time as the southern winter solstice).

In modern times, Earth&#x27;s perihelion occurs around January 3, and the aphelion around July 4. In other words, the Earth is closer to the Sun in January, and further away in July, which might seem counter-intuitive to those residing in the northern hemisphere, where it is colder when the Earth is closest to the sun and warmer when it is furthest away. The changing Earth-Sun distance results in an increase of about 7% in total solar energy reaching the Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Since the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that the Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. However, this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of surface covered by water in the southern hemisphere.

The Hill sphere (gravitational sphere of influence) of the Earth is about 1,500,000 kilometers (0.01 AU) in radius, or approximately four times the average distance to the Moon. This is the maximal distance at which the Earth&#x27;s gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects orbiting the Earth must be within this radius, otherwise, they may become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.

The following diagram illustrates the positions and relationship between the lines of solstices, equinoxes, and apsides of Earth&#x27;s elliptical orbit. The six Earth images are positions along the orbital ellipse, which are sequentially the perihelion (periapsis—nearest point to the Sun) on anywhere from January 2 to January 5, the point of March equinox on March 19, 20, or 21, the point of June solstice on June 20, 21, or 22, the aphelion (apoapsis—the farthest point from the Sun) on anywhere from July 3 to July 5, the September equinox on September 22, 23, or 24, and the December solstice on December 21, 22, or 23. 

==Future==
Mathematicians and astronomers (such as Laplace, Lagrange, Gauss, Poincaré, Kolmogorov, Vladimir Arnold, and Jürgen Moser) have searched for evidence for the stability of the planetary motions, and this quest led to many mathematical developments and several successive &quot;proofs&quot; of stability for the Solar System. By most predictions, Earth&#x27;s orbit will be relatively stable over long periods.

In 1989, Jacques Laskar&#x27;s work indicated that Earth&#x27;s orbit (as well as the orbits of all the inner planets) can become chaotic and that an error as small as 15 meters in measuring the initial position of the Earth today would make it impossible to predict where Earth would be in its orbit in just over 100 million years&#x27; time. Modeling the Solar System is a subject covered by the n-body problem.

<text>Silvaco Group, Inc., develops and markets electronic design automation (EDA) and technology CAD (TCAD) software and semiconductor design IP (SIP). The company is headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and has offices in North America, Europe, and throughout Asia. Founded in 1984, Silvaco is a publicly traded EDA company. The company has been known by at least two other names: Silvaco International, and Silvaco Data Systems.

==History==

Founded by Dr. Ivan Pesic (13 September 1951, Resnik, Montenegro — 20 October 2012, Japan) in 1984, the company was privately held and internally funded until its May 2024 initial public offering. It is headquartered in Santa Clara, California, with fourteen offices worldwide.

In 2003 Silvaco acquired Simucad Inc., a privately held company founded in 1981 that provided logic simulation EDA software. Silvaco re-launched the brand by spinning out its EDA product line in 2006 under the Simucad name. As of 17 February 2010, Simucad Design Automation and Silvaco Data Systems were merged back together forming Silvaco, Inc.

In 2006, Silvaco sued Intel for misappropriation of trade secrets in the case of &quot;Silvaco Data Systems v. Intel Corp.&quot;, however ultimately the judgment of the Court was in favor of Intel.

In 2012, David Halliday was appointed CEO after the death of the company founder Ivan Pesic.

In 2015, Silvaco appointed a new CEO, David Dutton. The company also acquired Invarian, Inc., a privately held company providing power integrity analysis software, and acquired Infiniscale SA, a privately held company in France providing variability analysis software.

In 2016, Silvaco added semiconductor design IP (SIP) to its portfolio with the acquisition of the privately held company IPextreme, Inc. Silvaco also entered into another new market segment with the acquisition of the privately held company edXact in France. The tools from edXact are used for analysis, reduction, and comparison of extracted parasitic netlists.

In 2017, Silvaco acquired SoC Solutions, a privately held company providing semiconductor IP.

In 2018, Silvaco acquired NanGate, a privately held company providing tools and services for creation, optimization, characterization, and validation of physical library IP. The company also announced a partnership with Purdue University and the Purdue Research Foundation for the commercialization of the NEMO tool suite, which is used for nanoelectronics modeling and atomistic simulation.

in 2018, Silvaco appointed Dr. Babak Taheri as Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President of Products.

In 2019, Silvaco appointed Dr. Babak Taheri as its new Chief Executive Officer. Prior to his appointment, he was Silvaco&#x27;s Chief Technical Officer.

In 2020, Silvaco acquired the assets of Coupling Wave Solutions S.A., a privately held company providing silicon substrate noise analysis software. 

In 2020, Silvaco acquired memory compiler technology of Dolphin Design SAS. The acquisition expanded company’s design IP portfolio to provide embedded memories for SoC applications

In 2021, Silvaco acquired Physical Verification Solution Provider POLYTEDA CLOUD LLC. The acquisition expanded company’s capabilities for rapid physical verification of IC designs prior to mask creation and manufacturing and for cloud enablement of EDA tools

<text>Hugh Nanton Romney Jr. (born May 15, 1936), known as Wavy Gravy, is an American entertainer and peace activist best known for his role at Woodstock, as well as for his hippie persona and countercultural beliefs.

Romney has founded or co-founded several organizations, including the activist commune the Hog Farm, and later, as Wavy Gravy, Camp Winnarainbow and the Seva Foundation. He founded the Phurst Church of Phun in the 1960s, a secret society of comics and clowns that aimed to support the ending of the Vietnam War through political theater, and has adopted a clown persona in support of his political activism, and more generally as a form of entertainment work, including as the official clown of the Grateful Dead.

As Wavy Gravy, he has had two radio shows on Sirius Satellite Radio&#x27;s &quot;Jam On&quot; station. A documentary film based on his life, &quot;Saint Misbehavin&#x27;: The Wavy Gravy Movie&quot;, was released in late 2010 to generally positive reviews. Romney was awarded the Kate Wolf Memorial Award by the World Folk Music Association in 1992.

==Early life and education==
Hugh Nanton Romney Jr. was born in East Greenbush, New York, on May 15, 1936. His father, Hugh Romney Sr., was an architect. Romney was raised in early life in Princeton, New Jersey, and by middle school age his family moved to West Hartford, Connecticut. He attended William Hall High School, graduating in 1954. After high school graduation, he volunteered for the United States Army, serving as a sign painter, to take advantage of the G.I. Bill. He was honorably discharged after 22 months.

Romney entered Boston University Theater Department in the late 1950s under the G.I. Bill, and then attended the Neighborhood Playhouse for the Theater in New York City.

In 1958, he began reading poetry regularly at The Gaslight Cafe in Greenwich Village in New York City, where he eventually became the cafe&#x27;s entertainment director, befriending musicians such as Bob Dylan, Tom Paxton, and Dave Van Ronk. He lived with Bob Dylan upstairs at 116 MacDougal Street.

==Career==
His early career was managed by Lenny Bruce who brought Romney to California in 1962 where he did a live recording of &quot;Hugh Romney, Third Stream Humor&quot; as the opening act for Thelonious Monk at Club Renaissance in Los Angeles.

===The Hog Farm===
The Hog Farm collective was established through a chain of events beginning with Ken Babbs hijacking the Merry Pranksters&#x27; bus, &quot;Furthur&quot;, to Mexico, which stranded the Merry Pranksters in Los Angeles. First Romney assembled a collective in North Hollywood, visited by musicians such as Ravi Shankar and Tiny Tim (whom he managed).

After moving to Sunland, a suburb in the San Fernando Valley, north of Los Angeles, Romney was evicted from his one-bedroom cabin after the landlord discovered that a large group of assorted pranksters and musicians were staying there. Two hours later, a neighbor informed Romney that a nearby hog farm needed caretakers after the farmer had suffered a stroke, and Romney accepted an offer to work at the farm in exchange for rent. Local people, musicians, artists, and members of other communes began staying at the mountain-top farm. In his book &quot;Something Good for a Change&quot;, Gravy described this early period as a &quot;bizarre communal experiment&quot; where the &quot;people began to outnumber the pigs&quot;.

Throughout the mid-1960s, both Romney and his wife, Bonnie Beecher, were employed in Los Angeles. He worked for Columbia Pictures teaching improvisation skills to actors. Beecher was a successful television actress, appearing in episodes of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and &quot;The Fugitive&quot;.

By 1966, the Hog Farm had coalesced into an entertainment organization providing light shows at the Shrine Exposition Hall in Los Angeles for music artists such as the Grateful Dead, Cream, and Jimi Hendrix. Beginning in 1967, the collective began traveling across the country in converted school buses purchased with money earned as extras in Otto Preminger&#x27;s feature film &quot;Skidoo&quot; (1968).

The Hog Farm relocated to the Black Oak Ranch in Laytonville, Mendocino County, in Northern California in the early 1990s.

===Woodstock Festival===
At the first Woodstock Festival, Romney and the Hog Farm collective accepted festival executive Stan Goldstein&#x27;s offer to help with preparations.

Romney called his group the &quot;Please Force,&quot; a reference to their non-intrusive tactics at keeping order, e.g., &quot;Please don&#x27;t do that, please do this instead&quot;. When asked by the press—who were the first to inform him that he and the rest of the Hog Farm were handling security—what kind of tools he intended to use to maintain order at the event, his response was &quot;Cream pies and seltzer bottles&quot; (both being traditional clown props). In Gravy&#x27;s words: &quot;They all wrote it down and I thought, &#x27;the power of manipulating the media&#x27;, ah ha!&quot;

Romney made announcements from the concert stage throughout the festival. He later wrote in his memoir that &quot;the reason that I got to do all those stage announcements was because of my relationship with Chip Monk [sic]. Chip built the stage at Woodstock.&quot;

At the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum&#x27;s psychedelic tribute to the 1960s &quot;I Want To Take You Higher&quot;, Romney&#x27;s sleeping bag and tie-dyed false teeth were displayed. He and Paul Krassner appeared there on the last day of the exhibit on February 28, 1998.

Romney, as Wavy Gravy after the first Woodstock, has been the Master of Ceremonies of, and the only person to appear on the bill of all three Woodstock festivals: the original festival in 1969, the 25thanniversary Woodstock &#x27;94 festival in 1994, and the 30thanniversary Woodstock &#x27;99 festival in 1999. On the morning of the 20th Anniversary of the Woodstock Festival, he and author Ken Kesey were interviewed on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, live from the Bethel concert site, where he discussed his experience as the MC of the event.

===Wavy Gravy name origin===
At the 1969 Texas International Pop Festival, two weeks after Woodstock, Romney was lying onstage, exhausted after spending hours trying to get festival-goers to put their clothes back on. He later explained, &quot;They had these conga drummers on the stage, and I said, &#x27;Don&#x27;t dance on the wavy gravy&#x27;. Then someone announced that B.B. King was there, and he was going to play for free. I started to get up, and I felt this hand on my shoulder and it was B.B. King. And he said, &#x27;Are you Wavy Gravy?&#x27; and I just said, &#x27;Yes, sir,&#x27; and he said, &#x27;Wavy Gravy, I can work around you.&#x27; And he stood me up next to his amplifier, and Johnny Winter comes from the other side, and they played all night long.&quot; Romney said he considered this a mystical event, and assumed Wavy Gravy as his legal name.

===Phurst Church of Phun and clowning===

After frequent arrests at demonstrations, Wavy Gravy decided that his arrest would be less likely if he dressed as a clown. Romney therefore co-founded the Phurst Church of Phun, a secret society of comics and clowns dedicated to ending the Vietnam War through the use of political theater. Romney also performs more generally as a clown, including entertaining children, work that includes such traditional clown activities as joke-telling and magic tricks. As Wavy Gravy, he has served as an official clown of the Grateful Dead.

===Art===
Wavy Gravy has also been recognized for his work as a collage artist, with work presented at a solo exhibition in April 1999 at the Firehouse Gallery in New York under gallery owner Eric Gibbons. He had an exhibition, entitled &quot;Wavy Gravy Retrospective&quot; (1996), at the Firehouse Gallery of Bordentown, New Jersey.

He began exploring collage in the early 1960s, and his first works were created in the period where he lived above the Gaslight in Greenwich Village; he has stated that he was inspired by a Max Ernst collage he saw at the Bitter End, when he opened for Peter, Paul and Mary. His collage work includes larger pieces done for celebrities in the San Francisco Bay Area.

===Neo-pagan appearances===
Wavy Gravy&#x27;s first appearance at an event in the Neo-Pagan community was at the WinterStar Symposium in 1998 with Paul Krassner. He appeared there again in 2000 with Phyllis Curott, where he joined Rev. Ivan Stang in a joint ritual of the Church of the SubGenius and his Church of the Cosmic Giggle.

==Ventures==
===Seva Foundation===
Wavy Gravy co-founded the Seva Foundation in 1978, along with spiritual leader Ram Dass and public health expert Dr. Larry Brilliant. Based in Berkeley, California, Seva Foundation is an international health organization working to build sustainable sight restoration programs in many of the globe&#x27;s most under-served communities. Gravy is famous for throwing all-star benefit concerts regularly featuring members of the Grateful Dead, Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Ani DiFranco, Ben Harper, Elvis Costello, and many other musicians.

===Camp Winnarainbow===
Gravy co-founded, with his wife, the circus and performing arts camp Camp Winnarainbow, now located in Laytonville, California near the Hog Farm. He co-ran the camp alongside Txi Whizz (also known as Barbara Hanna), his &quot;right-hand woman&quot;.

=== &quot;Tornado of Talent&quot; ===
In September 1981 there was an anti-nuclear protest, which included trespassing, blockade, occupation, and civil disobedience action at Diablo Canyon Power Plant, organized by the Abalone Alliance. Approximately 640 protesters were arrested, and Wavy Gravy and Jackson Browne were in attendance.

Browne was able to have an acoustic guitar and performed in the gymnasium at Cuesta College; where the male incarcerated were being held. Gravy organized and acted as MC for a variety show there that he called the, &quot;Tornado of Talent&quot;. Wavy arrived at the holding facility dressed in a pair of bright green coveralls. After settling into his &quot;bunk&quot; (a thin mattress on the gym floor) he removed the coveralls to reveal a Santa Claus suit.

=== Nobody for President and Nobody&#x27;s Business ===

&quot;Wavy Gravy nominated &quot;Nobody&quot; for president at the &quot;Yippie National Convention&quot; outside the Republican National Convention in Kansas City in 1976. It was the second time the Hog Farm had nominated a candidate for the Presidency, following the nomination of the hog, Pigasus, eight years prior.&quot;

Wavy Gravy ran a &quot;Nobody for President&quot; campaign that held a rally across from the White House on November 4, 1980, which included Yippies and a few anarchists to promote the option of &quot;none of the above&quot; choice on the ballot—as in, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Perfect&quot;, &quot;Nobody Keeps All Promises&quot;, &quot;Nobody Should Have That Much Power&quot;, and &quot;Who&#x27;s in Washington right now working to make the world a safer place? Nobody!&quot;. After criticizing Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and John B. Anderson, the committee offered the &quot;perfect&quot; candidate: Nobody. &quot;Nobody makes apple pie better than Mom. And Nobody will love you when you&#x27;re down and out,&quot; Gravy told a crowd of 50 onlookers at the rally. The allusion had been used previously, in the 1932 short film &quot;Betty Boop for President&quot;.

Gravy established the store Nobody&#x27;s Business across the road from the Hog Farm. reminiscent of his &quot;Nobody for President&quot; campaign.

== Personal life ==

He was briefly married to a &quot;Frenchwoman&quot; in the early 1960s; the marriage ended in divorce.

In 1965, Wavy Gravy married the actress Bonnie Jean Beecher, who later adopted the name Jahanara Romney. They have a son, born in 1971 as Howdy Do-Good Gravy Tomahawk Truckstop Romney, who has since become known as Jordan Romney.

<text>Napoleon Mateusz Tadeusz Orda (; ; 11 February 1807 – 26 April 1883) was a Polish-Lithuanian musician, pianist, composer, and artist, best known for numerous sketches of historical sites of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==Biography==
Napoleon Orda was born in the village of Varacevičy in the Pinsky Uyezd of Minsk Governorate (now in Ivanava District of Belarus) in his father&#x27;s manor. His father, Michał Orda, was an impoverished noble of Lithuanian ancestry and the marshal of the powiat of Kobryn. His mother was Józefa (nee Butrymowicz). After finishing Svislach gymnasium in 1823, he started mathematical studies at the Imperial University of Vilnius. However, his university career came to an end on 27 August 1826, when he was arrested by the Russian secret police for taking part in a secret student society &quot;Zorzanie&quot;, which was active in Svislach and Białystok gymnasiums. Although he was released soon afterwards, he was expelled from the university and was not allowed to continue his studies.
Orda took part in the failed November Uprising of 1830 against Russian Empire and served with distinction in the famous 4th Regiment (&quot;Czwartacy&quot;). For his bravery he received the highest Polish military decoration, the Virtuti Militari. After the uprising his manor was confiscated and Orda had to flee abroad in order to avoid being imprisoned and sent to Siberia.

He travelled through many European countries, including Italy and Switzerland. Finally in 1833, he settled in Paris, where he became one of the prominent members of the Polish diaspora there and one of the close friends of Fryderyk Chopin. He learned to play the piano under the guidance of Chopin and Franz Liszt and wrote several mazurkas, waltzes and polonaises. While in Paris he also studied painting briefly with Pierre Girard and started to portray his long lost motherland in countless sketches.
In Paris, Orda married Irene Bougle and worked as the head of &quot;Maison de Commission&quot; shop. He was also the head of the Italian Opera in Paris, until it was closed due to the February Revolution of 1848. He was also an active member of various Polish political and social organisations, including the Committee of Polish Emigrants. Most of his spare time he spent travelling. He visited France, England, Scotland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Lorraine, Spain, Portugal and Algeria.

During the Post-Sevastopolian Thaw in 1856 he was pardoned by tsar Alexander II and was allowed to return home. He was also restored the rights to his village of Varacevičy. In 1859 he requested from tzar and had received back his money that were confiscated together with his estate. In 1862, he moved to Wierzchownia where he served as a manager of general Adam Rzewuski&#x27;s domain.
In 1872, Orda started to travel through the lands of the partitioned Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and document its historical landmarks and architecture. During his summer trips throughout the country he made more than 1,000 sketches depicting various towns, cities and historical landscapes. He also depicted landscapes, urban and rural architecture, churches and palaces of the partitioned Commonwealth, which included the regions of present-day Belarus, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine, as well as several regions of France, Germany, Portugal and Switzerland. His works are pencil sketches tinted with watercolour, gouache and sepia. Between 1872 and 1874 he visited most of the notable castles, manors and towns in Volhynia, Podolia and Ukraine. Until 1877 he documented the historical heritage of Lithuania, Samogitia, Livonia and Belarus. In 1878 and 1879 he made a trip to Galicia, Greater Poland and Royal Prussia and finally in 1880 he portrayed the Congress Poland. Approximately 260 of his sketches were turned into lithographies by Alojzy Misierowicz and published in Warsaw by Maksymilian Fajans in a series of eight albums under the collective title &quot;Album of Polish Historical Landscapes&quot; () between 1873 and 1883.

In his testament he bequeathed his sketches to the Polish people and currently most of his works are kept in the National Museum in Kraków and Warsaw. Besides their artistic value, they are a priceless source of information on the history and architecture of Poland, Belarus and Ukraine, whose historical heritage was largely destroyed by the Germans during World War II.

Orda died on 26 April 1883 in Warsaw, but according to his last will he was buried in his native land, in Ivanava village, near Kobryn in his family crypt. In the 1980s, the cemetery was destroyed by Soviet authorities in order to build a kindergarten in its place. After some time the gravestone from Orda&#x27;s tomb was found and moved to a museum in Pinsk.

Orda&#x27;s niece was the artist Helena Skirmunt.

==Commemoration of Orda in Belarus==

In 1997, a monument to Orda was erected in the town of his burial by sculptor Ivan Holubieu.

In 2007, the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus issued silver and copper-nickel memory coins, devoted to the 200th anniversary of Orda&#x27;s birth. His work of Niasvizh Castle was also placed on the banknote of 100 000 BYR.

The streets in Minsk and Grodno are named after Orda.

In 2010, Google commemorated Orda&#x27;s date of birth by placing special logo with his work in Belarusian version of the search service.

<doc id="878470" wikidata="Q5487858" url="?curid=878470" title="Frank Lary">
<text>Frank Strong Lary (April 10, 1930 – December 13, 2017) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher for the Detroit Tigers (–), New York Mets (1964, ), Milwaukee Braves (1964), and Chicago White Sox (1965). He led the American League with 21 wins in 1956 and ranked second in the same category with 23 wins in 1961. Lary was selected to the American League All-Star team in 1960 and 1961 and won the Gold Glove Award in 1961. He was known variously as &quot;Taters&quot;, &quot;Mule&quot;, and the &quot;Yankee Killer.&quot; The latter nickname was won due to his 27–10 record against the New York Yankees from 1955 to 1961.

==Early years==
Lary was born in Northport, Alabama, in April 1930 as the sixth of seven children in the family. He was raised with his six brothers at a two-bedroom house in his family&#x27;s farm near Northport. His father, Joseph Milton &quot;Mitt&quot; Lary, was a cotton farmer and a former semipro spitball pitcher, who coached young Lary and five of his brothers when they were not working in the farm. His mother, Margaret, was a fiddle maker. Lary attended Tuscaloosa County High School and then went on to play baseball for the University of Alabama. His older brother Al Lary was briefly a pitcher for the Chicago Cubs, but spent most of his baseball career in the minor leagues. Lary followed his older brothers to the University of Alabama, where he had a 10–1 record in 1950 and won two more games in the College World Series. Lary dropped out of Alabama after two years to play professional baseball.

==Minor leagues==
After his performance in the 1950 College World Series, Lary signed a $6,000 contract with the Toledo Mud Hens, the Detroit Tigers&#x27; American Association farm club. He began his minor league career playing at Thomasville, Georgia, in the Georgia–Florida League. After winning four consecutive games in Thomasville, he moved to Jamestown, New York, in the PONY League, where he compiled a 5–2 record. Lary missed the 1951 and 1952 seasons due to service in the U.S. Army. He was considered a leading prospect with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League in and . During the 1953 season, he compiled a 17–11 record and threw a no-hitter against Ottawa. In 1954, he compiled a 15–11 record and won 10 of his last 12 games.

==Detroit Tigers==
Lary was called up to the Tigers late in the 1954 season, making his Major League debut on September 14. He played in parts of 11 seasons for the Tigers, and his 123 wins rank tenth in team history.

In , Lary stepped into the Tigers&#x27; rotation as a starter and compiled a record of 14–15 in 36 games.

In , Lary compiled a 21–13 record and became the Tigers&#x27; first 20-game winner since Hal Newhouser won 21 games in 1948. His record was 17-3 after July 1. Lary also led the American League in multiple statistical categories in 1956, including wins (21), games started (38), innings pitched (294), hits allowed (289), hit batsmen (12), and batters faced (1,269), and finished 17th in the voting for Most Valuable Player in the American League. His total of 1,269 batters faced was the highest total by a pitcher in the American League during the 1950s.

During his years with the Tigers, Lary became known as &quot;The Yankee Killer.&quot; He had a 27–10 record against the New York Yankees from 1955 to 1961, years during which the Yankees won six American League pennants. In 1956, he compiled a record of 5–1 against a Yankees team that had an overall record of 97–57. In , he was 7–1 against a Yankees team that had an overall record of 92–62. He became the first pitcher to win seven games in one year against the Yankees since Ed Cicotte accomplished the feat in 1916. A good hitting pitcher, Lary defeated the Yankees 4–3 on May 12, 1961, by hitting a lead off home run in the top of the ninth inning. This took place immediately following the ejection of teammate, outfielder Rocky Colavito, who had bolted into the stands at Yankee Stadium when he observed a Yankee fan tussling with his father. In &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, Joe Falls wrote: &quot;As far as Frank Lary is concerned, the war between the states never did end. There merely was an 89-year interlude between Lee&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox in 1865 and Lary&#x27;s arrival in the major leagues in 1954. The objective has remained the same: rout the Yankees.&quot; He was also 5–1 against the Yankees in . Yankees manager Casey Stengel once delayed the appearance of his star pitcher, Whitey Ford, by one day so Ford would not have to face Lary. Stengel explained to reporters, &quot;If Lary is going to beat us anyway, why should I waste my best pitcher?&quot;
Lary also was known by the nickname &quot;Taters&quot; after a teammate noticed him write &quot;Taters&quot; for potatoes on a dining car order during a 1955 road trip. &quot;He has been &#x27;Taters&#x27; around the clubhouse and in the dugout ever since.&quot; In a 1961 profile of Lary, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; wrote:&quot;Frank Lary is a classic kind of ballplayer—the type, alas, you don&#x27;t see much of these days. He is a throwback to the Cardinals of the 30s, a cotton pickin&#x27;, gee-tar strummin&#x27;, red clay Alabama farm boy, unspoiled by a little college or a lot of success. He is mean on the mound and a joker off it. To strangers he is quiet, but to the Tigers he is the Jonathan Winters of the dugout, keeping them loose and laughing. Sometimes he is a Casey Stengel, his legs bowed, his pants rolled above his knees. Then he is the trainer, complete in white shirt, white trousers and with a Turkish towel wrapped around his head.&quot;

In , Lary was selected for the first time as an All-Star. He led the American League that year in games started (36), complete games (15), innings pitched (279.1) and hit batsmen (19).

In , Lary had the best season of his career. With a record of 23–9, he was the top pitcher on a 1961 Detroit Tigers team that compiled a record of 101–61. Lary&#x27;s 23 wins were a career-high and second in the American League to Ford. Lary also threw a career-high and league-leading 22 complete games in 1961. Lary was also selected for the American League All-Star team and won the Gold Glove Award in 1961. He finished third in the 1961 Cy Young Award behind Ford and Warren Spahn.

Lary was a workhorse for the Tigers from 1955 to 1961. During that seven-year span, Lary led the American League in wins (117), complete games (115), innings pitched (), games started (242), and batters faced (7,569). He started more than 30 games in each of those seven season and led the American League in complete games three times in four years from 1958 to 1961.

In , the workload caught up with Lary, as he began having shoulder problems. He began the season with a 2–6 record and had only two complete games in 13 starts. He was placed on the disabled list in August 1962. Lary started the 1963 season in the minor leagues, and compiled a record of 4-9 after being recalled to the Tigers. He began the 1963 season with an 0–2 record for Detroit, giving him a record of 6–17 in his final three seasons in Detroit.

==Mets, Braves and White Sox==
In May 1964, the New York Mets purchased Lary from the Tigers. Lary compiled a 2–3 record for the Mets, and threw a two-hit shutout in his last game for the team during the 1964 season. In August 1964, the Mets traded Lary to the Milwaukee Braves in exchange for Dennis Ribant and $25,000. He was reacquired by the Mets in March 1965. Lary had a 1–3 record for the Mets in 1965. In July 1965, the Mets traded Lary to the Chicago White Sox for a player to be named later. Lary appeared in 14 games for the White Sox and compiled a 1–0 record.

==Career statistics==
In 12 seasons, Lary recorded a 128-116 won-loss record, a .525 winning percentage with a 3.49 earned run average in 350 appearances with 21 shutouts and 1,099 strikeouts in 2,162.1 innings pitched. As a hitter, Lary posted a .177 batting average (130-for-734) with 68 runs, 6 triples, 6 home runs, 54 RBI and 39 bases on balls. Defensively, he finished his career with a .962 fielding percentage

==Pitching style==
When Lary first came up, he relied on a hard fastball and a slider. Ned Garver suggested he try adding a changeup to fool hitters, though Garver later reflected that this new approach did not help Lary much. However, pitching coach Johnny Sain got Lary to try throwing a knuckleball. Lary had difficulty with the pitch at first but ultimately improved at throwing it, to the point that he could throw it as a strike.

==Later years==
After finishing his pitching career, Lary went on to coach and scout for various teams. After retiring from baseball, Lary lived in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where he began a construction business. In 1986, he was living in Northport and working for a company that paved roads. In the 1968 election, Lary endorsed third party candidate and fellow Alabamian, George C Wallace.

Lary died on the night of December 13, 2017 at a hospital in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, south of Northport from pneumonia at the age of 87.

<text>Paul Pope (born September 25, 1970) is an American alternative cartoonist. Pope&#x27;s work combines the precision and romance of European comics artists with the energy and page design of the manga tradition. Pope&#x27;s two protagonist types are the silent, lanky outsider male of &quot;The One Trick Rip-Off&quot;, &quot;Escapo&quot;, and &quot;Heavy Liquid&quot;; or the resourceful, aggressive, humorous young teenage girls of &quot;THB&quot;. He has self-published some of his work, most notably &quot;THB&quot;, through his own Horse Press, with other work for such publishers as DC Comics/Vertigo and First Second Books.

==Early life==
Born in Philadelphia, Pope grew up in Bowling Green, Ohio, with stops in Columbus, Ohio, San Francisco, and Toronto in between. He describes his influences as Daniel Torres, Bruno Premiani, Jack Kirby, Alex Toth, Tony Salmons, Hugo Pratt, Silvio Cadelo, Vittorio Giardino, and Hergé.

==Career==
Pope introduced &quot;THB&quot; in 1995, the same year he began work for Kodansha, Japan&#x27;s manga publisher. Pope eventually developed the manga &quot;Supertrouble&quot; for Kodansha, which mined the &quot;cutie-pie&quot; girl adventure vein that &quot;THB&quot; exists in. His storytelling narratives continue to mature with well-paced, deftly-shaded combinations of science fiction, hardboiled crime stories and the Romeo and Juliet archetype.

Pope&#x27;s &quot;One-Trick Ripoff&quot; was published by Dark Horse Comics, and &quot;Heavy Liquid&quot; and &quot;100%&quot; were published under DC Comics&#x27; Vertigo imprint.

In 2006, Pope received an Eisner Award for Best Short Story for his work, &quot;Teenage Sidekick&quot;, published in &quot;Solo&quot; No. 3.

In 2007, Pope won two additional Eisners, Best Writer/Artist and Best Limited Series, for his Batman mini-series, &quot;&quot;. Discussing the story, which is set in 2039, one hundred years after the first appearance of the caped crusader, Pope said: &quot;I wanted to present a new take on Batman, who is without a doubt a mythic figure in our pop-psyche. My Batman is not only totally science fiction, he&#x27;s also a very physical superhero: he bleeds, he sweats, he eats. He&#x27;s someone born into an overarching police state; someone with the body of David Beckham, the brain of Tesla, and the wealth of Howard Hughes... pretending to be Nosferatu.&quot; The story, colored by José Villarrubia, was originally presented in a four-part prestige format in 2006. DC Comics later published a trade paperback collecting &quot;Batman: Year 100&quot; in early 2007. The trade also includes Pope&#x27;s &quot;Berlin Batman&quot; story from &quot;The Batman Chronicles&quot; No. 11. &quot;Berlin Batman&quot; involves a version of Batman who lives in the German Weimar Republic on the eve of World War II. The Weimar Batman helps keep the papers of Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises from falling into Nazi hands. Both Batman stories in the collection reflect implicit libertarian themes that often appear in Pope&#x27;s work. He also wrote &quot;Endgame&quot; for Toonami&#x27;s website and came up with the character Orcelot Rex.

Aside from comics, in the fall of 2006 Pope worked with Italian clothing company Diesel on a big store installation during their fall fashion week campaign, and a screenprint series based on their &#x27;Chelsea Hotel&#x27; campaign as a 51st birthday present to Diesel&#x27;s founder, Renzo Rosso. In the fall of 2008, Pope went a step further by partnering with DKNY to create the DKNY:2089 collection.

Pope&#x27;s first art book, titled &quot;&quot;, came out in June 2007. A collection of his most representative work, the 224-page hardcover was published by AdHouse Books.

In 2009, Pope was featured in &quot;The Cartoonist,&quot; a documentary film on the life and work of cartoonist Jeff Smith.

Pope spoke at the 2005 New York and 2006 Sydney Semi-Permanent creative conference.

In 2010, Pope served as a Master Artist with the Atlantic Center for the Arts, a Florida-based artists&#x27; community providing artists an opportunity to work and collaborate with contemporary artists in the fields of composing, visual, literary, and performing arts.

Pope lives and works in New York City.

<doc id="878474" wikidata="Q656375" url="?curid=878474" title="Colomban Cri-cri">
<text>The Colomban Cri-Cri, also spelled Cricri, is the smallest twin-engined crewed aircraft in the world, designed in the early 1970s by French aeronautical engineer Michel Colomban.

The name &quot;Cri-Cri&quot; comes from the nickname of Christine, one of Colomban&#x27;s daughters. &#x27;Cri-cri&#x27; &#x27;or &#x27;cricri&#x27; is also the French term for the sound of a cricket or a cicada, or an informal name for the insects themselves, but it is unclear if this double meaning was intended by Colomban himself.

==Design and development==
Colomban designed the aircraft to be easy to build and fly, and the closeness of the two engines to each other, around the centreline, meant that it could be flown by pilots only qualified to fly single-engined aircraft because even with the complete failure of one engine, with hands and feet off the controls, the only effect would be a gentle turn. The cockpit canopy was carefully designed to direct effective airflow over the tail surfaces in this situation. The plans-built aircraft was also designed to be easy to store in a garage and tow on a trailer, with assembly and disassembly each taking only five minutes.

The Cri-Cri features a cantilever low-wing, a single-seat enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed tricycle landing gear and twin engines mounted on pylons to the nose of the aircraft in tractor configuration. The aircraft is made from aluminum sheet glued to Klegecell foam. Its span wing employs a Wortmann 21.7% mod airfoil, and has an area of . The aircraft is also capable of aerobatics within the limitations of twin-engined aircraft.

The first flight of the prototype was made on 19 July 1973 and within a few days it had proved to be easy to fly and capable of aerobatics, being stressed to +10g and -5g. It was powered by two Rowena 6507J single cylinder two-stroke engines, each giving and weighing .

==Variants==
;MC-10 Cri-Cri
:Prototype and early examples
;MC-12 Cri-Cri
:Model with a cruising speed of 185 km/h (100 knots, or 114.9 miles per hour) and range of 500 km (310.6 statute miles, 270 nautical miles). 
;MC-15 Cri-Cri
:Model powered by two JPX PUL 212 engines.
;MC-15 Cri-Cri Jet
:Model powered by two PBS VB TJ20 turbojet engines.

==Operational use==
As with any homebuilt aircraft, the existing Cri-Cri planes have often been modified by their builders, departing from the original design to a varying degree, resulting in varying performance. Most versions can climb with one engine inoperative.

In June 2010, EADS partnered with Aero Composites Saintonge and the Greencri-cri Association to present an electric-powered Cri-Cri at the Green Aviation Show in Le Bourget. The modified airframe with composite components can fly for 30 minutes at 110 km/h. The aircraft uses four brushless electric motors with counter-rotating propellers, which makes the aircraft one of the world&#x27;s smallest four-engine aircraft.

On September 5, 2010 Electravia accomplished a world record speed of 262 km/h (162.33 mph) for a lithium polymer-powered aircraft using a Cri-Cri with two electric motors (each producing 25 hp) during the attempt. The company claimed engine and cooling drag reductions of 46 per cent versus the conventional combustion engine arrangement.

On 9 July 2015 the electric-powered Electravia version of the design flew across the English Channel hours before the Airbus E-Fan, becoming the third electric aircraft to do so. It was pulled aloft by another aircraft and did not take off on its own. The first was the MacCready Solar Challenger in 1981 and the second used electric motors powered by hydrogen.

Edwards played for the Lynx during the 2003 and 2004 seasons. Afterwards, her contract expired and she became a free agent. But no other WNBA team offered her a contract for the 2005 season.

In December 2006, Edwards returned to Lynx, as an assistant coach.

Edwards served as an analyst for NBC Sports coverage of Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

In 2011, Edwards was named as assistant coach of the Tulsa Shock. She would later become the interim head coach after Nolan Richardson resigned on July 9, 2011.

On March 4, 2014, Edwards was hired by the Atlanta Dream as the assistant coach.

==International career==
After Edwards graduated, she played abroad for nine seasons splitting time between Vicenza- Italy, Nagoya- Japan, Spain (Dorna Godella), and France (Tarbes and Valenciennes). During this time, she also continued to appear in international competition.

After the 1994 season, she stayed in the United States to train for her fourth Olympic appearance at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Edwards was selected to take the competitors&#x27; oath at the Opening Ceremonies in Atlanta (the opening ceremonies took place on her 32nd birthday). She was named the 1996 Sportswoman of the Year (in the team category) by the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation.

She competed for the United States in international competition a total of 19 times. Her teams won 14 gold medals.

In 1984, the USA sent its National team to the 1984 William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan, for pre-Olympic practice. The team easily beat each of the eight teams they played, winning by an average of just under 50 points per game. Edwards averaged 5.5 points per game.

Edwards is the first female basketball player to have played in five Olympics. She is jointly (with Australian Andrew Gaze) the third basketball player to compete at five Olympics along with Puerto Rican Teófilo Cruz and Brazilian Oscar Schmidt.

She also holds the unique distinction of being the youngest gold medalist in women&#x27;s basketball (age 20 in 1984) and the oldest gold medalist in women&#x27;s basketball (age 36 in 2000).

She made a record fifth Olympic basketball team, earning a fourth gold medal to go with her bronze medal. She returned to Europe in 2002.

Edwards was named to the team representing the US at the 1987 William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan. The team won all seven games to win the gold medal for the event. Edwards led the team in scoring with 23 points against China. The USA won the gold medal game by a single point over South Korea, helped by Edwards key free throws with a minute left in the game. She was the team&#x27;s second leading scorer with 12.4 points per game over the seven games, and was named to the all-tournament team. In the following year, 1988, Edwards was also named to the Jones Cup team. The USA team was not as successful, with a 3–2 record, but that was enough to secure the silver medal. She averaged 15.4 points per game to lead her team in scoring.

Edwards was a member of the 1987 gold medal-winning USA Women&#x27;s Pan American Team in Indiana, and the 1991 bronze medal-winning team in Havana, Cuba.

Edwards was a member of the USA National team at the 1990 World Championships, held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The team won their opening round games fairly easily, with the closest of the first three games a 27-point victory over Czechoslovakia. Then they faced Cuba, a team that had beaten the US in exhibition matches only a few weeks earlier. The USA team was losing at halftime, but came back to win 87–78. Edwards hit four of her five three-point attempts, and scored 32 points, along with five steals. The USA team found itself behind at halftime to Canada in their next game, but came back to win easily 95–70. After an easy match against Bulgaria, the USA team faced Czechoslovakia again, end achieved an almost identical result, winning 87–59. In the title match, the USA team won the gold medal with a score of 88–78. Edwards led the team in scoring and assists, averaging 21.9 points per game and recording 24 assist for the event.

Edwards was named to the USA national team and competed in the 1994 World Championships, held in June 1994 in Sydney, Australia. The team was coached by Tara VanDerveer, and won their first six games, when they faced Brazil. In a closely contested, high-scoring game, Brazil hit ten of ten free throws in the final minute to secure a 110–107 victory. The USA won a close final game against Australia 100–95 to earn the bronze medal. Edwards had the second highest scoring average on the team with 12.7 points per game.

She also holds the record for points in an ABL game with 46.

<doc id="878479" wikidata="Q8006658" url="?curid=878479" title="William Cecil Ross">
<text>William Cecil Ross (May 11, 1911 – June 4, 1998) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada, the leader of the Young Communist League and later the leader of that province&#x27;s Communist Party from 1948 until his retirement in 1981.

Ross was raised in a secular Jewish family that moved from Ukraine to Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1917. He was originally named Cecil Zuken, but legally changed his name in 1936 (in part to protect his family from anti-Communist harassment). His brother Joseph Zuken also became a Communist politician, and was for many years a prominent alderman from Winnipeg&#x27;s working-class North End.

With the editorial backing of &quot;Dos Yiddishe Vort&quot; (a local Jewish newspaper), Ross was elected to the Winnipeg school board in 1936 and served in that capacity until 1939. He was also active in labour organization outside the city, and was imprisoned for six months on sedition charges after leading a strike in Flin Flon. In 1940, Ross campaigned for Leslie Morris in the federal riding of Winnipeg North, and thereby contributed to the defeat of Co-operative Commonwealth Federation incumbent Abraham Albert Heaps, the most prominent Jewish politician in the city.

Ross first ran for provincial office in the 1945 election, campaigning for the &quot;Labor-Progressive Party&quot; (as the Communist Party had renamed itself) in the riding of Assiniboia. He finished well behind the winner, Ernest Draffin of the Manitoba CCF.

Ross became leader of the provincial LPP on December 12, 1948, being elected by acclamation after former leader Bill Kardash resigned due to health concerns. Ross did not run in the election of 1949 because of a decision by the party to concentrate its resources—the LPP ran only two candidates, one of whom was elected. Ross continued to lead the LPP (which was renamed the Communist Party in 1959) for thirty-three years, though he was unable to prevent it from declining to a marginal political force.

Ross and Joseph Zuken had a strained relationship in the 1970s, due to Zuken&#x27;s frequent criticisms of the Soviet Union and official Communist Party policy. While Zuken voiced concerns about anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union and restrictions on Jewish travel, Ross was unwilling to make public statements which violated the principle of party unity. Ross defended the Communist government of Czechoslovakia against accusations of anti-Semitism in 1952, following the trials of Rudolf Slánský and others.

Despite their differences, the brothers remained close throughout their lives. Ross played a prominent role at Zuken&#x27;s funeral in 1986.

During the 1980s, Ross wrote in opposition to the Winnipeg School Board&#x27;s education policy concerning the Ukrainian famine of the early 1930s. Ross acknowledged the death of millions, but denied that the government of Joseph Stalin had consciously planned an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people. (Mary Kardash, a Winnipeg school trustee of Ukrainian background, made essentially the same arguments as Ross during the course of these debates).

Ross&#x27;s wife, Anne Ross, was also a public figure, serving as an administrator at the Mount Carmel Clinic in Winnipeg. In the early 1970s, this clinic became involved in a public controversy over its decision to offer abortion referral services.

Ross campaigned for federal and provincial office a total of fourteen times. Aside from the 1945 campaign mentioned above, he was a candidate in:

*Winnipeg Ward Two (municipal), 1953 Winnipeg election, (635 votes)
*Winnipeg North Centre (federal), 1953 (1606 votes), winner: Stanley Knowles (CCF)

<text>Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a statistical technique for examining differences in brain activity recorded during functional neuroimaging experiments. It was created by Karl Friston. It may alternatively refer to software created by the Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience at University College London to carry out such analyses.

==Approach==
===Unit of measurement===
Functional neuroimaging is one type of &#x27;brain scanning&#x27;. It involves the measurement of brain activity. The measurement technique depends on the imaging technology (e.g., fMRI and PET). The scanner produces a &#x27;map&#x27; of the area that is represented as voxels. Each voxel represents the activity of a specific volume in three-dimensional space. The exact size of a voxel varies depending on the technology. fMRI voxels typically represent a volume of 27 mm3 in an equilateral cuboid.

===Experimental design===
Researchers examine brain activity linked to a specific mental process or processes. One approach involves asking &#x27;which areas of the brain are significantly more active when doing task A compared to task B?&#x27;. Although the tasks might be designed to be identical, except for the behaviour under investigation, the brain is still likely to show changes in activity between tasks due to factors other than task differences (as the brain coordinates many parallel functions unrelated to the task). Further, the signal may contain noise from the imaging process itself.

To filter out these random effects, and to highlight the areas of activity linked specifically to the process under investigation, statistics look for the most significant differences. This involves a multi-stage process to prepare the data, and to analyse it using a general linear model.

===Image pre-processing===
Images from the scanner may be pre-processed to remove noise or correct for sampling errors.

A study usually scans a subject several times. To account for the motion of the head between scans, the images are typically adjusted so voxels in each image correspond (approximately) to the same site in the brain. This is referred to as &quot;realignment&quot; or &quot;motion correction&quot;, see image realignment.

Functional neuroimaging studies usually involve multiple participants, each of whom have differently shaped brains. All are likely to have the same gross anatomy, saving minor differences in overall brain size, individual variation in topography of the gyri and sulci of the cerebral cortex, and morphological differences in deep structures such as the corpus callosum. To aid comparisons, the 3D image of each brain is transformed so that superficial structures line up, via &quot;spatial normalization&quot;. Such normalization typically involves translation, rotation and scaling and nonlinear warping of the brain surface to match a standard template. Standard brain maps such as the Talairach-Tournoux or templates from the Montréal Neurological Institute (MNI) allow researchers from across the world to compare their results.

Images can be smoothed to make the data less noisy (similar to the &#x27;blur&#x27; effect used in some image-editing software) by which voxels are averaged with their neighbours, typically using a Gaussian filter or by wavelet transformation.

===Statistical comparison===
Parametric statistical models are assumed at each voxel, using the general linear model to describe the data variability in terms of experimental and confounding effects, with residual variability. Hypotheses expressed in terms of the model parameters are assessed at each voxel with univariate statistics.

Analyses may examine differences over time (i.e. correlations between a task variable and brain activity in a certain area) using linear convolution models of how the measured signal is caused by underlying changes in neural activity.

Because many statistical tests are conducted, adjustments have to be made to control for type I errors (false positives) potentially caused by the comparison of levels of activity over many voxels. A type I error would result in falsely assessing background brain activity as related to the task. Adjustments are made based on the number of resels in the image and the theory of continuous random fields in order to set a new criterion for statistical significance that adjusts for the problem of multiple comparisons.

===Graphical representations===
Differences in measured brain activity can be represented in various ways.

They can be presented as a table, displaying coordinates that show the most significant differences in activity between tasks. Alternatively, differences in brain activity can be shown as patches of colour on a brain &#x27;slice&#x27;, with the colours representing the location of voxels with statistically significant differences between conditions. The color gradient is mapped to statistical values, such as t-values or z-scores. This creates an intuitive and visually appealing map of the relative statistical strength of a given area.

Differences in activity can be represented as a &#x27;glass brain&#x27;, a representation of three outline views of the brain as if it were transparent. Only the patches of activation are visible as areas of shading. This is useful as a means of summarizing the total area of significant change in a given statistical comparison.

<doc id="878486" wikidata="Q4385654" url="?curid=878486" title="Spanish Main">
<text>During the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the Spanish Main was the collective term used by English speakers for the parts of the Spanish Empire that were on the mainland of the Americas and had coastlines on the Caribbean Sea or Gulf of Mexico. The term was used to distinguish those regions from the numerous islands Spain controlled in the Caribbean, which were known as the Spanish West Indies.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;main&quot; in the expression is a contraction of mainland.

== Composition ==
The Spanish Main included Spanish Florida and New Spain, the latter extending through modern-day Texas, Mexico, all of Central America, to Colombia and Venezuela on the north coast of South America. Major ports along this stretch of coastline included Veracruz, Porto Bello, Cartagena de Indias and Maracaibo.

The term is sometimes used in a more restricted sense that excludes the territories on the Gulf of Mexico. The Spanish Main then encompassed the Caribbean coastline from the Isthmus of Darien in Panama to the Orinoco delta on the coast of Venezuela. In this sense, the Spanish Main roughly coincides with the 16th century Province of Tierra Firme (Spanish for &quot;mainland province&quot;).

== Economic importance and piracy ==
From the 16th to the early 19th century, enormous wealth was shipped from the Spanish Main to Spain in the form of gold, silver, gemstones, spices, hardwoods, hides and other valuable goods. Much of the wealth was silver in the form of pieces of eight, from the mines near Potosí. It was carried to the Spanish Main by llama and mule trains via the Pacific coast. Other goods originated in the Far East, having been carried to the Pacific coast of Spain&#x27;s possessions on the Manila galleons, often through the port of Acapulco, then transported overland to the Spanish Main for onward shipment to Europe.

The Spanish Main became a frequent target for pirates, buccaneers, privateers and countries at war with Spain, seeking to capture some of these riches. To protect this wealth, the Spanish treasure fleet was equipped with heavily armed galleons. The organization of the fleets in large convoys proved highly successful, with only a few successful examples of major privateer attacks along the Spanish Main, such as the capture of Cartagena de Indias by Francis Drake in 1586; the capture of a Spanish treasure fleet sailing from Mexico by the Dutch West India Company in 1628; the capture of Chagres and Panama City by Henry Morgan in 1670–71; and the Raid on Cartagena by the French in 1697. Pirates operating in the area included the Dutchman Laurens de Graaf, who raided Veracruz in 1683 and Cartagena in 1697.

<text>The Pah Rah Range is a mountain range located in western Nevada in Washoe County just to the northeast of Reno. It is a hook shaped range with the main eastern portion oriented northwest–southeast, approximately long. The northwest flowing Cottonwood Creek in Warm Springs Valley is bounded on three sides by the range. To the south and east the Truckee River forms the boundary and Pyramid Lake is at the northeast. Spanish Springs Valley north of Reno forms the southwest margin. To the north, the narrow Mullen Pass separates the Pah Rah Range from the Virginia Mountains.

The highest peaks (in order from south to north) are Pond Peak (elevation ), Virginia Peak (elevation ) and Pah Rah Peak (elevation ). In the southwest portion Spanish Springs Peak (elevation ) is the highest. Both Pond Peak and Virginia Peak host several radio towers. Virginia Peak is also the site of a doppler radar station.

Interstate 80 follows the Truckee River basin to the south of the range. Nevada State Route 445 follows the Spanish Springs Valley to the west of the range, Nevada State Route 446 crosses through Mullen Pass to the north and Nevada State Route 447 follows the lakeshore and the Truckee Valley on the east side of the range.

The Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation occupies the eastern portion of the range.

&quot;Pah Rah&quot; is a Paiute term which translates roughly to &quot;Lake Mountain&quot; in reference to Pyramid Lake adjacent to the northeast margin of the range. This term applies to the Virginia Mountains better. This apparent mix-up is likely due to confusion on the part of the early surveyors of the region.

==Olinghouse mining district==
The former community and historic mining district of Olinghouse is located in the southeastern foothills of the Pah Rah Range about WNW of Wadsworth, Nevada and east of Pond Peak. The mines of the district produced gold from placer deposits and veins associated with granite porphyry dikes in a faulted basaltic to andesitic volcanic terrain of Oligocene to Miocene age. Mining for gold as collector&#x27;s specimens occurred during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The area had four names: White Horse, McLanesville, Ora and finally Olinghouse. The district and the former town that served it were named for Elias Olinghouse, who settled there and ran a mule team transport service.

The Olinghouse post office was in operation from October 1903 until July 1923.

==Fauna of Pah Rah Range==
Wildlife of the range include pronghorn antelope, bighorn sheep, coyote, mountain lion and the wild horse. The bighorn was seen wandering in the foothills of the range in Sparks(Wingfield Springs). It is thought to be from a group of bighorns transplanted to the nearby Virginia Range. Bird species include golden eagles, prairie falcons and red-tailed hawks.

<doc id="878498" wikidata="Q379999" url="?curid=878498" title="Harold Jeffreys">
<text>Sir Harold Jeffreys, FRS (22 April 1891 – 18 March 1989) was a British geophysicist who made significant contributions to mathematics and statistics. His book, &quot;Theory of Probability&quot;, which was first published in 1939, played an important role in the revival of the objective Bayesian view of probability.

==Education==
Jeffreys was born in Fatfield, County Durham, England, the son of Robert Hal Jeffreys, headmaster of Fatfield Church School, and his wife, Elizabeth Mary Sharpe, a school teacher. He was educated at his father&#x27;s school and at Rutherford Technical College, then studied at Armstrong College in Newcastle upon Tyne (at that time part of the University of Durham) and with the University of London External Programme. 

Jeffreys subsequently won a scholarship to study the Mathematical Tripos at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he established a reputation as an excellent student: obtaining first-class marks for his papers in Part One of the Tripos, he was a Wrangler in Part Two, and in 1915 he was awarded the prestigious Smith&#x27;s Prize.

==Career==

Jeffreys became a fellow of St John&#x27;s College in 1914, retaining his fellowship until his death 75 years later. At the University of Cambridge he taught mathematics, then geophysics and finally became the Plumian Professor of Astronomy.

In 1940, he married fellow mathematician and physicist, Bertha Swirles (1903–1999), and together they wrote &quot;Methods of Mathematical Physics&quot;.

One of his major contributions was on the Bayesian approach to probability (also see Jeffreys prior), as well as the idea that the Earth&#x27;s planetary core was liquid.

By 1924 Jeffreys had developed a general method of approximating solutions to linear, second-order differential equations, including the Schrödinger equation. Although the Schrödinger equation was developed two years later, Wentzel, Kramers, and Brillouin were apparently unaware of this earlier work, so Jeffreys is often neglected when credit is given for the WKB approximation.

Jeffreys received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1937, the Royal Society&#x27;s Copley Medal in 1960, and the Royal Statistical Society&#x27;s Guy Medal in Gold in 1962. In 1948, he received the Charles Lagrange Prize from the Académie royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique. He was knighted in 1953.

From 1939 to 1952 he was established as Director of the International Seismological Summary further known as International Seismological Centre.

The textbook &quot;Probability Theory: The Logic of Science,&quot; written by the physicist and probability theorist Edwin T. Jaynes, is dedicated to Jeffreys. The dedication reads, &quot;Dedicated to the memory of Sir Harold Jeffreys, who saw the truth and preserved it.&quot;

It is only through an appendix to the third edition of Jeffreys&#x27; book &quot;Scientific Inference&quot; that we know about Mary Cartwright&#x27;s method of proving that the number is irrational.

==Opposition to continental drift and plate tectonics==
Jeffreys, like many of his peers, staunchly opposed the concept of continental drift as put forth by Alfred Wegener and Arthur Holmes. This opposition persisted even into the 1960s among his colleagues at Cambridge. For him, continental drift was &quot;out of the question&quot; because no force even remotely strong enough to move the continents across the Earth&#x27;s surface was evident. As geological and geophysical evidence for continental drift and plate tectonics mounted in the 1960s and after, to the point where it became the unifying concept of modern geology, Jeffreys remained a stubborn opponent of the theory to his death.

<text>Michael James Boddicker (born August 23, 1957) is an American right-handed former Major League Baseball pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles (1980–1988), Boston Red Sox (1988–1990), Kansas City Royals (1991–1992), and Milwaukee Brewers (1993). He was the ALCS MVP in 1983 and was an American League All-Star in 1984.

==Early years==
Boddicker was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on August 23, 1957. His ancestors (Johan &amp; Elisabeth (Jacobi) Boddicker) emigrated in 1861 from the village of Brilon, Province of Westphalia, which was situated in current-day Germany, and were among the original settlers of Norway, Iowa, where he was raised. He was the youngest of five children to Harold and Dolly. His father, who was commonly known as Bus, operated a travelling hammermill for grain milling before becoming a custodian at the local elementary school. He is a distant cousin of the musician Michael Boddicker.

He was drafted by the Montreal Expos in 1975, but decided to attend the University of Iowa. He was a First-team All-Big Ten pitcher in 1978 and third-team All-Big Ten as an infielder in 1976. In 1978, he led the NCAA with an average 11.5 strikeouts per game. He held school records with six career shutouts and 0.79 ERA in a season. He led the team in innings and strikeouts in 1978 and 1979 and led the team in batting average in 1978 (.350) and doubles in 1978 (9) and 1976 (9). He finished his career with 189 strikeouts, ranking in the top 10 in school history.

==Baseball career==
Boddicker&#x27;s pitching repertoire, once called &quot;Little League slop&quot; by Rod Carew, featured off-speed pitches and deception to compensate for a lack of power. He was able to throw from three different arm angles. He had a fastball that never came close to reaching 90 miles per hour. The one pitch that made him famous was the fosh, which he called &quot;a glorified changeup.&quot; Another one he used with success was the slurve. Tony Phillips once commented, &quot;What I noticed about him is that he lets you get yourself out. I find myself sometimes actually jumping at his pitches, being overanxious because he doesn&#x27;t throw very fast, and I wind up popping the ball up.&quot;

Boddicker had a win–loss record of 134–116 with a 3.80 ERA during his career. In his rookie season, 1983, he went 16–8 with a 2.77 ERA and led the majors with five shutouts. Perhaps his best season was 1984, when he went 20–11 with a 2.79 ERA (leading the American League in both wins and ERA). He also won the Gold Glove Award in 1990.

Boddicker had a notable performance in the 1983 postseason. With his team down 1–0 in both the ALCS and World Series, Boddicker pitched his team out of the hole by winning Game 2 of the ALCS 4–0 against the Chicago White Sox (complete game shutout) and Game 2 of the World Series 4–1 against the Philadelphia Phillies en route to a world championship.
After going 0–8 with a 5.83 ERA to begin the 1988 campaign, Boddicker rebounded with a 6–4 record and a 2.95 ERA in his last 13 starts with the Orioles. On a team that lost its first 21 games of the season and was never in postseason contention, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox for Brady Anderson and Curt Schilling on July 29, 1988, two days prior to the non-waivers trade deadline. Contending for the American League East title, the Red Sox outbid the Minnesota Twins and Oakland Athletics to land him. Boddicker went 7–3 down the stretch for the Sox, helping them win the AL East crown that year. He went 15–11 in 1989 and in 1990 went 17–8 with a 3.36 ERA while helping the Red Sox win another division title.

After signing with the Royals, he finished 12–12 with a 4.08 ERA in 1991, his last full season (30 games). After his contract was purchased by the Brewers, he pitched 54 innings for them in 1993, his final year. He finished 3–5 with a 5.67 ERA that year.

<text>The Waitresses were an American new wave band from Akron, Ohio, best known for their singles &quot;I Know What Boys Like&quot; and &quot;Christmas Wrapping.&quot; The band released two albums, &quot;Wasn&#x27;t Tomorrow Wonderful?&quot; and &quot;Bruiseology&quot;, and one EP, &quot;I Could Rule the World If I Could Only Get the Parts&quot;.

The group was led by guitarist-songwriter Chris Butler with lead vocals performed by Patty Donahue.

==History==
The Waitresses were formed by Butler (formerly of the Numbers Band) in 1978 as a side project while he was still a member of Tin Huey. He wrote and recorded &quot;I Know What Boys Like&quot; that year, with guest vocals by friend Donahue (as &quot;Patty Darling&quot;) and saxophone from Tin Huey member Ralph Carney, although the song remained unreleased at the time. A debut single, &quot;In &quot;Short Stack&quot;&quot; (featuring the songs &quot;Slide&quot; and &quot;Clones&quot;), recorded solely by Butler, was issued by Clone Records in 1978. Both tracks from the single, plus another early song, &quot;The Comb&quot;, appeared that year on &quot;The Akron Compilation&quot;, issued by Stiff Records.

Butler moved to New York City and shopped &quot;I Know What Boys Like&quot;. The song landed him a deal with ZE Records, which released the single in 1980. It was an underground hit, but did not chart. With the deal in place, Butler put together an actual band lineup for the Waitresses, featuring lead vocalist Donahue, jazz saxophonist Mars Williams, former Television drummer Billy Ficca, keyboardist Dan Klayman, bassist Dave Hofstra and backing vocalist Ariel Warner. The Waitresses played their debut concert on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1980.

1981 saw the band record its first and most successful album and its most enduring hit. During the recording sessions for the album &quot;Wasn&#x27;t Tomorrow Wonderful?&quot; Warner resigned from the band because of stage fright. Later that year, Hofstra quit. He was replaced by Tracy Wormworth, who would supply the bass line for &quot;Christmas Wrapping&quot;, a Christmas song written by Butler in August at ZE&#x27;s insistence. 

The Waitresses released &quot;Wasn&#x27;t Tomorrow Wonderful?&quot; on January 11, 1982, on the Polydor label, licensed from ZE. It peaked at No. 41 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The album included &quot;I Know What Boys Like&quot;, which was re-released as a single later in the year and peaked at No. 62 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100,
No. 23 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Tracks chart,
No. 14 on the Australian Singles Chart (Kent Music Report),
and also charted in the UK. &quot;Christmas Wrapping&quot;, originally released on the ZE Records album &quot;A Christmas Record&quot; in 1981, became a No. 45 hit in the United Kingdom in 1982.

The Waitresses recorded the theme song of the television program &quot;Square Pegs&quot;,
starring Sarah Jessica Parker and Amy Linker, which aired during the 1982–1983 season, and the band appeared as themselves in the pilot episode. Polydor issued the song as a single in 1982, and included it (along with &quot;Christmas Wrapping&quot;) on the 1982 EP &quot;I Could Rule the World If I Could Only Get the Parts&quot;.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Bruiseology&quot;, was released by Polydor in May 1983. During that summer, Donahue left the band and was replaced by Holly Beth Vincent, formerly of Holly and the Italians, but Vincent herself left after just two weeks and Donahue returned. 

The Waitresses split up later in 1983.

==Post-breakup and legacy==
Butler later worked as a producer, and played with numerous bands and artists including Half Cleveland, Purple K&#x27;nif and Richard Lloyd. Ficca played in Gods and Monsters and returned to his former group Television when they reunited in 1991. Williams played with the Psychedelic Furs, NRG Ensemble, Liquid Soul, Hal Russell and Ken Vandermark. Williams died of ampullary cancer at the age of 68 on November 20, 2023. Wormworth has played bass for the B-52&#x27;s since 1992. 

Donahue died of lung cancer at the age of 40 on December 9, 1996. &quot;King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents the Waitresses&quot;, a live album recorded in 1982 at My Father&#x27;s Place in Roslyn, New York, was issued in 1997 by King Biscuit Flower Hour. Polydor issued two compilation albums, &quot;The Best of the Waitresses&quot; (1990) and &quot;20th Century Masters – The Millennium Collection: The Best of The Waitresses&quot; (2003). In 2013, Omnivore Recordings released the compilation &quot;Just Desserts: The Complete Waitresses&quot;, collecting virtually all of the band&#x27;s recordings for Polydor, while ZE Records issued a digital collection of their ZE releases, &quot;Deluxe Special: Ze Complete Recordings&quot;.

&quot;Christmas Wrapping&quot; was covered by the Spice Girls in 1998, as the B-side of their single &quot;Goodbye&quot;, which peaked at number 1 in the UK. A version of &quot;I Know What Boys Like&quot; recorded by English female pop duo Shampoo reached No. 42 on the UK Singles Chart in September 1996. The first line in the debut single by American recording artist Chris Brown, &quot;Run It!&quot; references &quot;I Know What Boys Like&quot;. &quot;Run It!&quot; topped the charts in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. VH1 named the song the 82nd greatest one-hit wonder of all-time in 2002 as well as the 34th greatest one-hit wonder of the 1980s in 2009.

<text>Mustafa Osman Ismail (born 1955 in Dongola, Sudan) was the head of the National Congress Party, the ruling party in Sudan. Ismail was the Foreign Minister of Sudan from 18 February 1998 to 18 September 2005.

His main job as foreign minister was to be the government&#x27;s main spokesman in diplomatic efforts to solve the Sudanese civil wars. He was the longest-serving foreign minister in Sudanese history. He was replaced by southerner Lam Akol when the national unity government took office. Ismail was appointed Presidential Advisor after stepping down as Foreign Minister. He has been on many official trips abroad and has been criticized as being an active shadow Foreign Minister for the National Congress Party. His tireless efforts at unsuccessfully mediating crises outside of Sudan, roles in the domestic politics of the National Congress Party and his long tenure in public office have drawn the criticism of sections of the Sudanese media.

<text>Thomas George Farr (12 March 1913 – 1 March 1986) was a Welsh boxer from Clydach Vale, Rhondda, nicknamed &quot;The Tonypandy Terror&quot;. Prior to 1936, Farr boxed in the light heavyweight division, in which he was the Welsh champion. He became British and Empire heavyweight champion on 15 March 1937. Farr is considered to be one of the greatest British heavyweight fighters ever, and was inducted into the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame in 1997.

In the United States, Farr is remembered for his 1937 world title challenge against Joe Louis. Considered one of Louis&#x27; toughest ever fights, the bout lasted the full 15 rounds and the large crowd saw Farr hurt Louis on numerous occasions. However the final result was controversial, being a wide unanimous decision in favour of Louis, with the referee awarding him the fight thirteen rounds to one, while the judges scored the fight eight to five and nine to six, both in Louis&#x27;s favour. The announcement of the decision was roundly booed by the spectators. The bout was named The Ring magazine Fight of the Year for 1937.

== Boxing career ==

=== Early career ===
In his early career he didn&#x27;t have much success. He garnered some wins but losses specked his record every two or three wins. Most of his losses were against unknowns. He soon started improving, with a win over top contender Tommy Loughran in 1936. In 1937 he bested ex-champion Max Baer and earned a title shot against Joe Louis.

===World title fight vs Joe Louis===
On 30 August 1937, Farr fought world heavyweight champion Joe Louis at the height of his career at Yankee Stadium, New York City. He earned respect despite losing a controversial points decision after 15 rounds. Louis had knocked out eight of his previous nine opponents and proceeded to knock out his next seven, but was attacked and hurt by Farr. The 50,000 crowd booed when Louis won. Referee Arthur Donovan, Sr. had seemingly raised Farr&#x27;s glove in victory, causing controversy. Seven years later, in his published account of the fight, Donovan apologised for the &#x27;mistake&#x27;, claiming he had meant to shake Farr&#x27;s hand to congratulate him for what he saw as an impressive fight. &quot;Mistakes&quot; hardly ended there, however. Donovan&#x27;s own scorecard, had 13 rounds going to Louis.

Though mixed accounts say Louis deserved the nod, 13 frames out of 15 prompted these words from a British sportswriter: &quot;The verdict is that of a man either blindly partisan or afflicted with astigmatism. It is a verdict that justifies the beliefs that nothing short of the annihilation of Louis would have given Farr victory. That Louis won may not be disputed, but as I read the fight, there was only a fractional difference in his favour at the finish.&quot; However, In Donovan&#x27;s account, he stands by his scoring of the fight, claiming that while Farr&#x27;s punches may have appeared to have done more damage than Louis&#x27;s from the crowd&#x27;s point of view, from his perspective and that of the ringside judges the opposite was true.

Contrary views of the fight&#x27;s result continued for many years. In The Encyclopedia of Boxing, as compiled by Gilbert Odd in the 1980s, Tommy&#x27;s listing concludes its thumbnail on the championship bout with &quot;...Louis came back strongly and clinched a narrow points verdict.&quot; The actual ferocity of the battle and its level of competition, seldom contested, may be summed up by Tommy Farr, later on in life: &quot;When I talk about that fight, my nose still bleeds.&quot;

===Later career===
After the Louis fight, Farr was unsuccessful in several contests at Madison Square Garden, New York. These included a ten-round fight on 21 January 1938, against former heavyweight champion James J. Braddock, &quot;the Cinderella Man&quot;. He also lost to Max Baer the same year, even though he had defeated him before. Farr returned to the UK early in 1939, enjoying a run of victories that year. He retired in 1940, but personal tragedies saw him lose his fortune. He ended up bankrupt, having to return to the ring at the age of 36 to make a living, during this time, he was taken under the wing of businessman Lesie T.Salts, the owner of Gwrych Castle. Farr later ran a pub in Brighton, Sussex, in final retirement, and died on Saint David&#x27;s Day, 1986, aged 72. He is buried at Trealaw Cemetery.

==In popular culture==
In 2007, &quot;Contender&quot;, a musical based on Farr&#x27;s career, was composed by Mal Pope and premiered at the United Nations building in New York, followed by a season at Swansea&#x27;s Grand Theatre. A theme of the musical is that Farr&#x27;s lack of success in the US resulted wholly from his refusal to co-operate with fight-fixing mobsters and bookmakers.

<text>Shanballymore (, colloquially &quot;Shanbla&quot;) is a small village in County Cork, Ireland. It neighbours the towns of Doneraile, Kildorrery and Castletownroche, and is off the main route from Mallow to Mitchelstown. Shanballymore is part of the Cork East Dáil constituency.

The village has a pub &quot;The Corner House&quot;, a school and a Catholic church. The church is dedicated to Christ the King. Shanballymore GAA is the local GAA club.

The village had a population of 165 people as of the 2016 census.

== History==

Shanballymore, also historically referred to as &quot;Templeruan – Sonnachgowan&quot; (old town), is situated on the North bank of the Awbeg River – Spenser&#x27;s &#x27;Mulla Fair&#x27; – astride the road from Mallow to Mitchelstown. It is also traversed by the &#x27;Bianconi Road&#x27; .This is the old road which crosses Wallstown Hill over the river and Clogher Hill, the cobbled surface of which can still be seen in a few places. The modern &#x27;New Line&#x27; was built as a public work around the hills during one of the famines in the 19th century.

Of the variant names of Shanballymore, the earliest, Sonnach Gobunn, appears in the Críchad an Chaoilli (c. 1100) and the Papal Taxation of Pope Nicholas of 1291. The second name, Templeroan, makes its appearance as an alternative name about 1400 and remains as the name of the Civil (legal) or Church of Ireland parish. Census figures and other official information for the parish are found under this second title. The third and most recent name, Shanballymore, is the name of the Roman Catholic parish.

Within the area are four tower houses or castles, including at Ballinamona, Sonnach (or Shannagh), Castleruan and Dannanstown, and three churches, Kilelly, kilclagmusey &amp; Templeroan. There is also a reference to a Shanballymore Castle, but that would appear to be in error for Castleruahn.

The vicinity of Shanballymore was part of the &quot;tuath&quot; (area of control) of &quot;Ui Bece Abha Uachtarach&quot; with Castletownroche and Wallstown parishes, as shown in the &quot;Críchad_an_Chaoilli&quot;, a description of the area now known as the Barony of Fermoy. The text appears in &quot;The Book of Lismore&quot; (more correctly the book of Mac carthaigh Riabhach, which was found in the early 19th century, hidden in the walls of Lismore Castle). The Crichad portion of the text provides a description of Irish land holding c. 1100, the limits of the estates and the major families of the area. It was edited and translated on three occasions, first in Patrick, Cardinal Moran&#x27;s editing of Mervyn Archdall&#x27;s &quot;Monasticon Hibernicus&quot;, 1873; second by J. G. O&#x27;Keeffe in the scholarly journal &quot;Eriu&quot; in 1928; and third in Patrick Power&#x27;s publication of 1932.

The parish is represented in the crichad by the &#x27;bailies&#x27; of Sonnach Gobann and cluain Lochluinn and the main family were the Hi Gobunn. This is possibly the family who gave their to Ballygowan in Killavullen Parish. Sonnach remains in the townland of Shannagh.

The parish was valued in the papal taxation of Pope Nicholas in 1291 at 5 marks (2 old pounds 13 shillings and 4 pence) and taxed at a tithe or tenth. It is not mentioned in the pipe Roll of Cloyne (c. 1370). it appears from other documents of the period and later, to have been united with Wallstown &amp; Ballygrigan parishes rather than Doneraile.

In 1821 the population of the Parish was 1,413 people, 668 males and 745 females divided into 253 families and living in 236 houses. 413 were unemployed. In 1831 1,788 and in 1941 1802 people 564 males and 590 females, in these years the village population rose from 199 in 1821, to 415 in 80 houses in 1831, and in 1841, some 471 people in 89 houses (mostly thatched) and 392 in 1851.

In 1821 there were 164 boys and 54 girls in school in the parish. In 1826 there were 2 schools in Shanballymore and Ballyhourode, where Matthew Reardon taught 32 boys and 18 girls, all Roman Catholics in a wretched hovel which beggars description and the other in Shanballymore where James Riall was Master to either 122 or 100 pupils in a sonte and mud thatched house. The primary valuation of 1851 listed Patrick O&#x27;Keefe as the National Teacher in Shanballymore.

&quot;Shanballymore&quot; was also the name of the winner of the Irish Derby Stakes in 1911, but the horse had no connection to the village in County Cork, as it refers to a townland of Donohill, Tipperary.

===Ballinamona===
One of the townlands in the area is Ballinamona (&quot;The town of the bog&quot;). In this townland are the remains of a Nagle Castle – one of the many in Shanballymore, Annikisha and Killavullen. Those still showing above ground are Monanimy, Carrigacunna and Ballinamona. Annakisha has disappeared completely. The Nagles were a Norman family of considerable strength almost from their arrival in Ireland; Sir Richard Nagle of Clogher was Solicitor General for Ireland under James II and was one of the most influential members of the &quot;Patriot Parliament&quot; of 1689. Also descended from the Nagle family was Nano Nagle, foundress of the presentation Convent Order, from whom some people of Shanballymore received their education in nearby Doneraile.

One part of the Nagle Castle, no longer to be seen, is a Sheela na gig which was found built into the wall and later destroyed. Sheela na gig reliefs, often carved in stone and set into castle and church walls to &quot;ward off evil&quot;, take the form of figurative carvings of naked women displaying an exaggerated vulva. Legend has it that Garret Nagle of Ballinamona was in London for the coronation of King George IV, when his workmen found the carving in the castle. Being upset by the lewd figure, they broke it. They reputedly also broke the &#x27;luck&#x27;, as shortly afterwards Nagle had to sell the castle and lands to cover his debts.

== Townlands in Shanballymore ==
The electoral division of Shanballymore, which shares its name with the village, contains 20 townlands. These include: Ballinamona - Ballydoyle - Ballyguyroe - Ballyhourode - Ballywalter - Carriganuroe - Carrigleagh - Cliadh Dubh - Clogher - Commons - Clustogue &amp; Kilconnors - Dannanstown - Graig - Graig upper - Oldtown - Parksouth - Pike - Pouleagh - Castle Ruane - Shanagh - Shanballymore - Templeruan - Waterdyke.

==Early career==
Carr was born Allan Solomon to an American Jewish family in Chicago, Illinois. He attended Lake Forest College and Northwestern University, but his interest was always in show business. While at Northwestern, he invested $750 in the Broadway musical &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; starring Tallulah Bankhead. Though the show was not a hit, he had also invested $1,250 in 1967 film &quot;The Happiest Millionaire,&quot; which gave him the success he needed to leave school and embark upon a career in entertainment.

In Chicago in the 1960s, he opened the Civic Theater and financed &quot;The World of Carl Sandburg&quot; starring Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, as well as Eva Le Gallienne in &quot;Mary Stuart,&quot; directed by Sir Tyrone Guthrie, and Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;Garden District&quot;, featuring Cathleen Nesbitt and Diana Barrymore. Carr worked behind the scenes at &quot;Playboy&quot; with Hugh Hefner and was a co-creator of the &quot;Playboy Penthouse&quot; television series, which in turn launched the Playboy Club.

Through the years, he became known as a great planner of promotional events and parties. One such event, a black-tie affair for Truman Capote, took place in an abandoned Los Angeles jail.

==Management career==
In 1966, Carr founded the talent agency Allan Carr Enterprises, managing the actors Tony Curtis, Peter Sellers, Rosalind Russell, Dyan Cannon, Melina Mercouri, and Marlo Thomas. Some of the other entertainment figures whose careers he managed were Ann-Margret, a string of whose television specials he also produced: Nancy Walker, Marvin Hamlisch, Joan Rivers, Peggy Lee, Cass Elliot, Paul Anka, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, George Maharis and Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass.

Carr was responsible for the invention of the false and much-derided story that Cass Elliot died by choking on a ham sandwich. In 2020, journalist Sue Cameron admitted that she promulgated the story at Carr&#x27;s request by writing it into Elliot&#x27;s obituary for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;; Carr decided that the humiliating falsehood was preferable to the implication that Elliot&#x27;s heart attack was associated with substance abuse.

Carr is also credited for having discovered numerous celebrities, including some who also became his clients, such as Mark Hamill, Michelle Pfeiffer, Steve Guttenberg and Lisa Hartman.

==&quot;Grease&quot; and Broadway success==
Producer Robert Stigwood hired him in 1975 as marketing and promotion consultant, with his first project being for the film version of the rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot;. The film was a hit and he expanded his involvement for his next film, re-editing and overdubbing a low-budget foreign film about a real-life disaster. The result was &quot;Survive!&quot; (The disaster in question was also described in Piers Paul Read&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;.) The surprise box office success of &quot;Survive!&quot; in 1976 made Carr a wealthy man and gave him clout at Paramount Pictures.

In 1977, Stigwood asked him to produce the ad campaign for &quot;Saturday Night Fever,&quot; and he turned the film&#x27;s premiere into a star-studded television special. It worked so well that Stigwood gave him &quot;Grease&quot; (1978). Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for &quot;Grease&quot;, but also co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client Olivia Newton-John. It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five Golden Globe Awards and won two People&#x27;s Choice Awards, for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the Angie Dickinson television series &quot;Police Woman&quot;. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 Oscar-winning &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;.

The following year, 1979, he produced the Village People film musical &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop The Music,&quot; a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members&#x27; presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and Cher. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop. Because of this, Carr &quot;won&quot; the first annual Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce &quot;Grease 2&quot; (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop The Music&quot; had been.

When Carr was in Paris for the premiere of &quot;Grease,&quot; a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, &quot;La Cage aux Folles.&quot; By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced a musical version of the 1973 play, which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called &quot;The Birdcage.&quot; With a book by Harvey Fierstein and music and lyrics by Jerry Herman, the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances. Nominated in 1984 for eight Drama Desk Awards and eight Tony Awards, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a &quot;Best Musical&quot; win for Carr.

==Snow White and the Academy Awards==
Carr&#x27;s reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led AMPAS to hire him to produce the 61st Academy Awards on March 29, 1989. Carr made a promise to shift the show from its perceived dry and dull stature to something different, one that would be inspired by &quot;Beach Blanket Babylon&quot; (created by Steve Silver), the musical revue show featuring Snow White during the Golden Age of Hollywood. Three time Academy Award winner Marvin Hamlisch was brought in as conductor. With the promise of being &quot;the antithesis of tacky,&quot; for which the ceremony would have no host, as it would rotate actors and actresses instead generally put in pairs as part of Carr&#x27;s theme of &quot;couples, companions, costars, and compadres&quot;, with the most notable pair being Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (in her final public appearance before her death just a few weeks later). The criticism for the ceremony stemmed mostly from the musical numbers that attempted to cross both Old and New Hollywood together. It began with a booming voice stating that the &quot;star of all time&quot; would arrive soon, which came in the form of Snow White, played by Eileen Bowman (Lorna Luft declined, much to her subsequent relief), who proceeded to try and shake the hands of stars in the audience in the theater (much to the embarrassment of nominated actress Michelle Pfeiffer). Merv Griffin started the show with his 1950 hit “I’ve Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts!”, complete with a re-creation of the Cocoanut Grove nightclub that featured a collection of established stars such as Vincent Price, Alice Faye, and Roy Rogers. Bowman returned to the stage afterwards to sing a duet of &quot;Proud Mary&quot; with Rob Lowe, which lasted twelve minutes. A second production number was done later with &quot;The Stars of Tomorrow&quot; doing a number called &quot;I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner&quot; that featured actors in their teens/mid-20s such as Christian Slater (sword fighting Tyrone Power Jr.), Chad Lowe (shouting &quot;I am a Thespian&quot;), and Patrick Dempsey (tap dancing along the stairwell).

Steve Silver, asked about the opening number while looking at the reviews, stated, &quot;Janet Maslin says it is the worst production number in the history of the Oscars. I guess you can&#x27;t top that. The publicity for Beach Blanket Babylon ought to be wonderful.” An open letter was released on April 7, featuring 17 figures of Hollywood (such as former Academy president Gregory Peck) that called the ceremony an embarrassment to the Academy and the industry. Two days later, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; dedicated its entire letter section (ten in total) to hate mail about the ceremony, titling it “For Some, the Oscar Show Was One Big Carr Crash.&quot; The Walt Disney Company sued the Academy shortly after the ceremony for copyright infringement (no one at the Academy had asked for permission from Disney regarding Snow White), which forced the Academy to make a formal apology. Lowe defended his appearance by describing himself as a &quot;good soldier&quot; doing it for the Academy, while Bowman would state later that the show looked like a &quot;gay bar mitzvah&quot;, doing so years after the fact after having signed a gag order that had her not talk about the show for thirteen years. Carr&#x27;s reputation in Hollywood did not fully recover from the blowback the ceremony received, although there were some retaining benefits. The ratings for the show were marginally better than the previous ceremony, as over 42 million viewers in 26 million homes saw the ceremony in the United States. The choice of no host for the ceremony would be replicated for the 2019 ceremony. Carr&#x27;s decision to change the announcement from &quot;And the winner is...&quot; to &quot;And the Oscar goes to..&quot; has been utilized for each Academy ceremony since. Carr elected to have retailer Fred Hayman get designers to dress the stars for arrival on the red carpet, which became its own segment of focus in later years. Comedian Bruce Vilanch, hired as a writer for the show, would work on the show for the next two decades, which included a promotion to head writer. Carr did not produce another film or television show again.

==Later work==
That same year Carr helmed the project &quot;&quot; with Freddie Gershon and CBS Records, a concept album and, later, an off-Broadway musical theater production written by Maury Yeston (&quot;Nine&quot;) and featuring Plácido Domingo as artist Francisco Goya. Still in development for a full Broadway production, the music has been recorded by Domingo with Dionne Warwick in English and Gloria Estefan in Spanish, and a version of the duet &quot;Till I Loved You&quot; was a top-40 single for Barbra Streisand and Don Johnson.

Carr continued his work in theater, sponsoring the 1984-85 Royal Shakespeare Company productions of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; and &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; at Washington&#x27;s Kennedy Center and Broadway&#x27;s Gershwin Theatre, earning 10 Tony nominations between them including one more for Carr.
Carr had returned to Paramount Pictures to handle the re-release of &quot;Grease&quot; in 1998, which included producing a VH1 television special of the twentieth anniversary Hollywood &quot;premiere&quot; screening and party, and special edition re-releases of the video, DVD, and soundtrack album.

==Production filmography==
Carr was a producer of numerous movies, including:
*&quot;The First Time&quot; (1969)
*&quot;C.C. and Company&quot; (1970)
*&quot;Grease&quot; (1978)
*&quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot; (1980)
*&quot;Grease 2&quot; (1982)
*&quot;Where the Boys Are &#x27;84&quot; (1984)
*&quot;Cloak &amp; Dagger&quot; (1984)

==Personal life and death==
Carr died from liver cancer on June 29, 1999, in Beverly Hills, California. His ashes were scattered in front of his former Diamond Head house on Oahu by Ann-Margret, her husband Roger Smith, and Martin Menard. At the time of his death, he split his time between his homes in Beverly Hills and Palm Springs, and was working on bringing Ken Ludwig&#x27;s Tony-winning comedy &quot;Lend Me a Tenor&quot; to Australia and the UK, and was preparing a new Broadway show, &quot;The New Musical Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;.

Director Roman Polanski, who had recently been arrested in a statutory rape case, received a standing ovation at Carr&#x27;s &quot;Rolodex&quot; party.

In 2017, a documentary about Carr&#x27;s life was released entitled &quot;The Fabulous Allan Carr&quot;. The film&#x27;s director, Jeffrey Schwarz, said, &quot;Although it was no secret that Allan Carr was gay, he never formally acknowledged it publicly. The word &#x27;flamboyant&#x27; was used to describe him, a code word.&quot;

<text>Directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS, also known as TB-DOTS) is the name given to the tuberculosis (TB) control strategy recommended by the World Health Organization. According to WHO, &quot;The most cost-effective way to stop the spread of TB in communities with a high incidence is by curing it. The best curative method for TB is known as DOTS.&quot; DOTS has five main components:
* Government commitment (including political will at all levels, and establishment of a centralized and prioritized system of TB monitoring, recording and training)
* Case detection by sputum smear microscopy
* Standardized treatment regimen directly of six to nine months observed by a healthcare worker or community health worker for at least the first two months
* Drug supply
* A standardized recording and reporting system that allows assessment of treatment results

==History==

The technical strategy for DOTS was developed by Karel Styblo of the International Union Against TB &amp; Lung Disease in the 1970s and 80s, primarily in Tanzania, but also in Malawi, Nicaragua and Mozambique. Styblo refined &quot;a treatment system of checks and balances that provided high cure rates at a cost affordable for most developing countries.&quot; This increased the proportion of people cured of TB from 40% to nearly 80%, costing up to $10 per life saved and $3 per new infection avoided.

In 2007, WHO and the World Bank began investigating the potential expansion of this strategy. In July 2008, the World Bank invited Styblo and WHO to design a TB control project for China. By the end of 2007 this pilot project was achieving phenomenal results, more than doubling cure rates among TB patients. China soon extended this project to cover half the country.

During the early 1990s, WHO determined that of the nearly 700 different tasks involved in Styblo&#x27;s meticulous system, only 100 of them were essential to run an effective TB control program. From this, WHO&#x27;s relatively small TB unit at that time, led by Arata Kochi, developed an even more concise &quot;Framework for TB Control&quot; focusing on five main elements and nine key operations. The initial emphasis was on &quot;DOT, or directly observed therapy, using a specific combination of TB medicines known as short-course chemotherapy as one of the five essential elements for controlling TB. In 1993, the World Bank&#x27;s &quot;Word Development Report&quot; claimed that the TB control strategies used in DOTS were one of the most cost-effective public health investments.

In the Fall of 1994, Kraig Klaudt, WHO&#x27;s TB Advocacy Officer, developed the name and concept for a marketing strategy to brand this complex public health intervention. To help market &quot;DOTS&quot; to global and national decision makers, turning the word &quot;dots&quot; upside down to spell &quot;stop&quot; proved a memorable shorthand that promoted &quot;Stop TB. Use Dots!&quot;

According to &quot;POZ Magazine&quot;, &quot;You know the worldwide epidemic of TB is entering a critical stage when the cash-strapped World Health Organization spends a fortune on glossy paper, morbid photos and an interactive, spinning (!) cover for its 1995 TB report.&quot; India&#x27;s Joint Effort to Eradicate TB NGO observed that, &quot;DOTS became a clarion call for TB control programmes around the world. Because of its novelty, this health intervention quickly captured the attention of even those outside of the international health community.&quot;

The DOTS report was released to the public on March 20, 1995, at New York City&#x27;s Health Department. At the news conference, Tom Frieden, head of the city&#x27;s Bureau of TB Control captured the essence of DOTS, &quot;TB control is basically a management problem.&quot; Frieden had been credited for using the strategy to turn around New York City&#x27;s TB outbreak a few years earlier.

On March 19, 1997, at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, Germany, WHO announced that &quot;DOTS was the biggest health breakthrough of the decade.&quot; According to WHO Director-General Hiroshi Nakajima, &quot;We anticipate that at least 10 million deaths from TB will be prevented in the next ten years with the introduction and extensive use of the DOTS strategy.&quot; Upon Nakajima&#x27;s death in 2013, WHO recognized that the promotion of DOTS was one of WHO&#x27;s most successful programs developed during his ten-year administration.

==Impact==
There has been a steady uptake of DOTS TB control services over the subsequent decades. Whereas previously less than 2% of infectious TB patients were being detected and cured, with DOTS treatment services in 1990 approximately 60% have been benefitted from this care. Since 1995, 41 million people have been successfully treated and up to 6 million lives saved through DOTS and the Stop TB Strategy. 5.8 million TB cases were notified through DOTS programs in 2009.

A systematic review of randomized clinical trials found no difference for cure rates as well as the treatment completion rates between directly observed therapy (DOT) and self-administered drug therapy. A 2013 meta-analysis of both clinical trials and observational studies too did not find any difference between DOTS and self-administered therapy. However, the WHO and all other TB programs continue to use DOTS as an important strategy for TB delivery for fear of drug resistance.

DOTS-Plus is for multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).

<text>Eriya Kategaya (4 July 1945 – 2 March 2013) was a Ugandan lawyer and politician. At the time of his death he was Uganda&#x27;s First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for East African Community Affairs. He was also an &quot;ex officio&quot; Member of the Ugandan Parliament, on account of being a cabinet minister.

==Background==
Kategaya was born on 4 July 1943 in Karagwe Itojo, Ntungamo District, in Western Uganda. He was a longtime associate of President Yoweri Museveni. They had studied together at Mbarara High School and later at Ntare School from 1961 to 1966. Kategaya and Museveni also attended the University of Dar es Salaam at the same time.

==Education==
Kategaya held a Bachelor of Laws (LLB), degree from the University of Dar-es-Salaam. At the time of his graduation the university was part of the University of East Africa.

==Military and political training==
Kategaya was part of Museveni&#x27;s Front for National Salvation (FRONASA), a group of Ugandan exiles in Tanzania who eventually helped topple Idi Amin in 1979 with the help of the Tanzania People&#x27;s Defence Force. In 1980, he was a founder of the Uganda Patriotic Movement, headed by Museveni to contest in the elections. When Museveni launched the guerrilla struggle against the Milton Obote II administration (1981 - 1985), Kategaya served in the &#x27;External Wing&#x27; of the rebel National Resistance Movement (NRM) and National Resistance Army (NRA). The NRM transformed into the National Resistance Movement political party, while the NRA became the Uganda People&#x27;s Defence Force (UPDF). He was a Brigadier General in the National Resistance Army from 1987 holding army number RO-002 although he never served in any military position as he was all the time serving in other government offices as a senior cabinet minister.

==Political career==
When the NRM and NRA eventually took power in January 1986, Kategaya was one of the groups&#x27; top leadership and considered by most as the &quot;Number Two&quot; after Museveni. Between 1986 and 2001, Kategaya served in various capacities as National Political Commissar for the NRM and Minister in Museveni&#x27;s governments.

During Museveni&#x27;s second term as elected President (2001 - 2006), Kategaya, then serving as Internal Affairs Minister, famously fell out with the President when he opposed moves to have the Constitution amended to remove presidential term limits. In May 2003, he was dropped from his ministerial position during a Cabinet reshuffle, along with other ministers who opposed the removal of term limits. Kategaya continued to speak out against amending the term limits provision until eventually the heavily pro-Museveni Parliament pushed the amendment through.

From the time he was dropped from the Cabinet, Kategaya returned to practice as a private lawyer with J.B.Byamugisha Advocates, a law firm based in Kampala.

In December 2004, he participated in the formation of the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) an anti-Museveni coalition which went on to become the main opposition group in Uganda after the 2006 general elections. Kategaya, however, maintained a low profile and rarely participated in FDC affairs.

Following Museveni and NRM&#x27;s win in the 2006 general elections, rumours began spreading that Kategaya was in reconciliation talks with Museveni. The rumours proved well-founded when Museveni nominated his old ally for approval by the Parliament as a Cabinet Minister. Subsequently, he was appointed to the posts of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for East African Community Affairs. Kategaya has been instrumental in the continued growth of the East African Community.

In the cabinet reshuffle of 27 May 2011, Eriya Kategaya maintained all his cabinet posts.

Eriya Kategaya died on 2 March 2013 in Nairobi, where he had been hospitalised for a while.

<doc id="878523" wikidata="Q460644" url="?curid=878523" title="Manto Tshabalala-Msimang">
<text>Mantombazana &quot;Manto&quot; Edmie Tshabalala-Msimang OMSS (née Mali; 9 October 1940 – 16 December 2009) was a South African politician. She was Deputy Minister of Justice from 1996 to 1999 and served as Minister of Health from 1999 to 2008 under President Thabo Mbeki. She also served as Minister in the Presidency under President Kgalema Motlanthe from September 2008 to May 2009. 

Her emphasis on treating South Africa&#x27;s AIDS epidemic with easily accessible vegetables such as African potato, garlic and beetroot, rather than with antiretroviral medicines, was the subject of local and international criticism. These policies led to the deaths of over 300,000 infected South Africans.

==Education==
Born as Mantombazana Edmie Mali in Durban, Tshabalala-Msimang graduated from Fort Hare University in 1961. As one of a number of young African National Congress cadres sent into exile for education, she received medical training at the First Leningrad Medical Institute in the Soviet Union from 1962 to 1969. She then trained as a registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology in Tanzania, finishing there in 1972. In 1980 she received a master&#x27;s in public health from the University of Antwerp in Belgium. 

She was an official within the exiled ANC leadership in Tanzania and Zambia during the latter decade of apartheid, with job responsibilities focused on the health and well-being of ANC militants there.

==AIDS policies==
Tshabalala-Msimang&#x27;s administration as Minister of Health was controversial, because of her reluctance to adopt a public sector plan for treating AIDS with anti-retroviral medicines (ARVs). When interviewed by Radio 702 presenter John Robbie in 2000, Tshabalala-Msimang refused to say whether she believed HIV caused AIDS. She was called &quot;Dr. Beetroot&quot; for promoting the benefits of beetroot, garlic, lemons, and African potatoes as well as good general nutrition, while referring to the possible toxicities of AIDS medicines. She was widely seen as following an AIDS policy in line with the ideas of South African President Thabo Mbeki, who for a time publicly expressed doubts about whether HIV caused AIDS.

In 2002, the South African Cabinet affirmed the policy that &quot;HIV causes AIDS&quot; which as an official statement silenced any further speculation on this topic by Cabinet members, including the President. In August 2003, the cabinet also voted to make anti-retrovirals available in the public sector, and instructed Tshabalala-Msimang to carry out the policy.

The Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) and its founder Zackie Achmat often targeted the minister for criticism, accusing the government and the Ministry of Health in particular of an inadequate response to the AIDS epidemic. The TAC led a campaign calling for her resignation or dismissal.

The TAC accused Tshabalala-Msimang of being aligned with Matthias Rath, a German physician and vitamin entrepreneur, who had charges laid against him for discouraging the use of ARVs.

Tshabalala-Msimang placed her emphasis on broad public health goals, seeing AIDS as only one aspect of that effort and one which, because of the incurable nature of HIV and financial costs of HIV treatment, might impede broader efforts to improve public health. A report making the case that AIDS is such a burden on the public health system that treating it would actually free up costs was sent back for clarification and not released in the summer of 2003, until it was obtained and leaked by TAC. After the cabinet vote to accept the findings of this report, Tshabalala-Msimang was in charge of the ARV roll-out, but continued to emphasise the importance of nutrition in AIDS and to urge others to see AIDS as only one problem among many in South African health.

A case that attracted much public attention was Nozipho Bhengu, daughter of an African National Congress legislator, who rejected anti-retroviral treatments for AIDS in favour of Tshabalala-Msimang&#x27;s garlic and lemon diet. The minister declined to attend her funeral, and her stand-in was booed off the podium.

In February 2005, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) criticised the health department for their failure to ensure that most of the 30 million rand used to establish the government&#x27;s AIDS trust in 2002 had been spent. They said only R520,000 of this money was used and of this a large portion had been squandered on unoccupied offices for the SANAC secretariat, something that drew criticism from the auditor-general.

In August 2006, at the International AIDS Conference in Toronto, Stephen Lewis, the United Nations special envoy for AIDS in Africa, closed the conference with a sharp critique of South Africa&#x27;s government. He said South Africa promoted a &quot;lunatic fringe&quot; attitude toward HIV and AIDS, describing the government as &quot;obtuse, dilatory, and negligent about rolling out treatment&quot;.
After the conference, sixty-five of the world&#x27;s leading HIV/AIDS scientists (most of them were attending the conference) asked in a letter that Thabo Mbeki dismiss Tshabalala-Msimang.

==Traditional medicines==
At a meeting with traditional healers to discuss future legislation in February 2008, Tshabalala-Msimang argued that traditional remedies should not become &quot;bogged down&quot; in clinical trials, also saying, &quot;We cannot use Western models of protocols for research and development&quot;.

In September 2008, Tshabalala-Msimang called for greater protection of the intellectual rights of Africa&#x27;s traditional medicines. Speaking at the 6th commemoration of The African Traditional Medicine Day in Cameroon&#x27;s capital of Yaoundé, she said that the continent should benefit more from its ancient traditional knowledge.

==Personal==
Tshabalala-Msimang married her first husband, Mandla Tshabalala, while both were in exile in the Soviet Union. Later she married Mendi Msimang, the treasurer of the African National Congress.

Concern over Tshabalala-Msimang&#x27;s health came to the fore in late 2006. She was admitted to the Johannesburg Hospital on 20 February 2007, suffering from anaemia and pleural effusion (an abnormal accumulation of fluid around the lungs). The Department of Health approached President Thabo Mbeki, and asked him to appoint an acting minister, and on 26 February Jeff Radebe was appointed acting health minister. On 14 March 2007, Tshabalala-Msimang underwent a liver transplant. The stated cause was autoimmune hepatitis with portal hypertension, but the transplant was surrounded by accusations of heavy drinking.
She subsequently recovered her health and returned to her Ministerial duties until her replacement as health minister in 2008.

On 16 December 2009, she died due to complications related to her liver transplant.

==Scandal==

On 12 August 2007, four days after the controversial dismissal of her deputy minister, Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge, the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; ran an article titled &quot;Manto&#x27;s hospital booze binge&quot; about a previous hospital stay in 2005 for a shoulder operation. The article alleged that she sent hospital workers out to fetch wine, whisky and food items, in one case at 1:30 am. Tshabalala-Msimang threatened legal action against the newspaper on the grounds that they were in possession of her medical records. The paper defended its statements, stating that &quot;a retraction was not under consideration&quot;. The article also reported speculation among &quot;many top medical experts at state and private institutions, who refused to be named as they feared retribution from the health ministry&quot; that her liver condition was alcohol-induced, cirrhosis.

According to a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; article titled &quot;Manto: A Drunk and a Thief&quot; published on 19 August 2007, the minister was a convicted thief who had stolen patient items at a hospital in Botswana, and had been deported from Botswana and declared a prohibited immigrant.

==ANC politics and replacement as Health Minister==
With the endorsement of Jacob Zuma&#x27;s supporters, Tshabalala-Msimang was re-elected to the ANC&#x27;s 80-member National Executive Committee in December 2007 in 55th place, with 1,591 votes.

Mbeki was forced to resign by the ANC in September 2008. When his successor, Kgalema Motlanthe, took office on 25 September 2008, he moved Tshabalala-Msimang to the post of Minister in the Presidency, appointing Barbara Hogan to replace her as Minister of Health.

Tshabalala-Msimang was not included in the first Cabinet of President Jacob Zuma, announced on 10 May 2009.

==Death==
Tshabalala-Msimang died on 16 December 2009 at the Wits University Donald Gordon Medical Centre and Medi-Clinic ICU. Her doctor, Professor Jeff Wing, announced that she died due to complications arising from a liver transplant.

Political opponents and friends alike expressed shock at the announcement of her death:
* The Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) – &quot;We don&#x27;t wish ill on any human being even though we had a very difficult time with her as minister of health. We are sending our condolences to her family and children.&quot;
* Helen Zille, leader of the Democratic Alliance – &quot;We extend our sincere regrets to her family and loved ones. It is sad when anyone dies. Like many politicians she was controversial. However, that doesn&#x27;t detract from the sadness of her death&quot;.
* COSATU president Sidumo Dlamini – &quot;This is shocking news. Somebody asked me yesterday what message we were going to send her in hospital and I said we hoped and wished her a speedy recovery. She made some mistakes by driving those policies but she was a human being. Her loss is a great loss. South Africa is losing a great leader of the ANC.&quot;

<doc id="878526" wikidata="Q5449269" url="?curid=878526" title="Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap">
<text>Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap is a BBC sitcom produced in 1986 and broadcast in 1987. The series featured former &quot;The Young Ones&quot; co-stars Nigel Planer, Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson as its three titular characters. It was written by Ben Elton (with additional material credited to Mayall), and produced and directed by Paul Jackson (who also directed &quot;The Young Ones&quot;), with film sequences directed by Ed Bye. The show&#x27;s music was written by Peter Brewis. One series consisting of six half-hour episodes was produced. Despite the continuity announcer saying that the show would return the following year, only one series was ever made due to a fall-out between Mayall and Elton over creative control.

The series enjoyed a resurgence of interest in 2004 when it was officially released on DVD by independent DVD production company Playback. The VHS and DVD versions were cut for musical rights. Cuts included Richie singing &quot;Where Is Love?&quot;, &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot;, and &quot;Consider Yourself&quot;; and Eddie singing &quot;Roxanne&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Pick a Pocket or Two&quot;, and &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;. A 25th-anniversary DVD was released in 2012.

==Characters==
*Ralph Filthy (Nigel Planer): Richie&#x27;s showbiz agent. He is sleazy and sickly and has, to quote writer Elton, &quot;the morals of a dog caught short on a croquet lawn&quot; (a line he would re-use as the tag line for his 1989 novel &quot;Stark&quot;). Quote: &quot;Boys. It&#x27;s not often I get excited but right now I feel like I&#x27;ve been locked in an off-licence&quot;. His speech is peppered with Polari and he refers to Richie as &quot;Daughter&quot;; his lapel also features a blue rose, a symbol of a quest for the impossible.
*Gertrude Richard &quot;Richie&quot; Rich (Rik Mayall): a half-witted perennially &quot;resting&quot; (out of work) comedian/TV presenter whose most prominent work to date includes links on TVS. Despite this, he considers himself a &quot;veritable superstar&quot; and has paranoid delusions about everyone he meets wanting to either cash in on his fame or assassinate him. Hence, he hires a bodyguard.
*Edward Didgeridoo Catflap (Adrian Edmondson): Richie&#x27;s faithless minder; permanently drunk, disloyal and violent. Occasionally, Catflap holds up the pretence of being Richie&#x27;s best friend, although this is usually for personal gain. (Edmondson&#x27;s character in &quot;Bottom&quot;, Eddie Hitler, is similar but not identical.)

==Summary==
During the run of the series Richie kills several milkmen, Eddie blackmails Richie with a paternity suit scam, Ralph gets sent to prison and hanged, Richie is blackmailed by The Nolans, they spoof newspaper tycoon Rupert Murdoch and feature bodyguards wearing Federation Stormtrooper uniforms that previously featured in the sci-fi show &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;. Richie appeared as a guest on a panel game called &quot;Ooer!! Sounds a Bit Rude!&quot;, which bore more than a passing resemblance to the BBC quiz show &quot;Blankety Blank&quot; (which itself is mentioned several times throughout the show). Richie finally becomes famous by slandering everyone in showbiz and becoming the only person censors deem clean enough to host every show on television (precisely everybody, from the &quot;A-list&quot; names down to the entire cast of &quot;Grange Hill&quot;). This leads to a song-and-dance routine from Richie, celebrating the fact that, in his words, he has &quot;made it!&quot;.

As well as the Nolans, other people appearing as &quot;themselves&quot; included Midge Ure and Anne Diamond (then an anchor woman for breakfast TV station TV-am). The show also featured cameos by Barbara Windsor, Lynda Bellingham and Jools Holland. Contemporaries from the alternative comedy scene who also appeared include Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Helen Lederer, Gareth Hale, Norman Pace, Arthur Smith, Mel Smith, Chris Barrie, Lee Cornes, David Baddiel, Andy de la Tour, John Bird and Harry Enfield. Many of these guests had previously appeared in &quot;The Young Ones&quot;.

==Episodes==
All episodes directed by Ed Bye and Paul Jackson. All episodes written by Ben Elton, with additional material by Rik Mayall.

<doc id="878528" wikidata="Q403463" url="?curid=878528" title="Aicardi syndrome">
<text>Aicardi syndrome is a rare genetic malformation syndrome characterized by the partial or complete absence of a key structure in the brain called the corpus callosum, the presence of retinal lacunes, and epileptic seizures in the form of infantile spasms. Other malformations of the brain and skeleton may also occur. The syndrome includes intellectual disability that is usually severe or moderate. So far, the syndrome has only been diagnosed in girls and in boys with two X chromosomes (Klinefelter syndrome).

Those with Aicardi syndrome are in need of various specialist and habilitation instances. Epilepsy is treated with medication, but additional treatment may also be needed. In order to utilize the individual&#x27;s eyesight and investigate the need for visual aids, examination by ophthalmologist is indicated early in life. Problems from the gastrointestinal tract are frequent. In adulthood, continued habilitation efforts and support in daily life are needed.

The syndrome is named after the French child neurologist Jean Dennis Aicardi, who in 1965 described it in eight girls. A causative gene has not been identified. Symptoms typically appear before a baby reaches about 5 months of age.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Those with Aicardi syndrome develop normally during the first months, but later various symptoms appear due to the syndrome&#x27;s characteristic malformations in the brain. It is common for people with Aicardi syndrome to have a small head (microcephaly).

At three to six months of age, the child begins to have epileptic seizures, often of the infantile spasm type caused by changes in the brain&#x27;s gray matter, the cerebral cortex. The seizures occur either as so-called flexor spasms, when the child&#x27;s neck suddenly bends forward while the arms make a clasping movement, or as other types of epileptic seizures. Seizures come in series at short intervals and may increase in number from day to day until they are broken with medication. Epilepsy usually persists for life.

Most have a severe intellectual disability with a major impact on language, communication and motor skills. A few have a moderate intellectual disability. Mild intellectual disability also occurs but is very rare.

The eyes are always affected, and most people have impaired vision. During an eye examination, areas with less pigment (retinal lacunae) appear as white spots in the fundus, which is due to the absence of retinal pigment cells and other structures in these areas. If the lacunae are located in the macula, they affect acuity. Other types of eye abnormalities are also common, such as one eye being smaller than normal (microphthalmia), changes in the optic nerve, and incomplete closure/slitting of the membranes of the eye (coloboma). Rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus) are common. Since people with Aicardi syndrome have an intellectual disability that makes it difficult to participate in an eye examination, it is difficult to measure vision accurately.

Problems from the gastrointestinal tract are common, for example constipation, diarrhea and that the normal valve mechanism between the stomach and the esophagus (upper mouth of the stomach) does not work normally and the stomach contents therefore leak up into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux). Some may also have difficulty eating.

Puberty may be entered earlier than normal, but delayed puberty has also been described. Drooling and bruxism is common.

Extra ribs or lack of ribs and vertebral deformities often occur. A crooked back (scoliosis) may develop while growing up. There are reports of isolated cases of tumors, especially brain tumors.

Aicardi syndrome is a non-progressive condition and in itself does not lead to any deterioration, but various complications mean that there is an increased mortality associated with the syndrome. Very little is known about the long-term prognosis, but there are occasional reports that the epilepsy may become milder with increasing age. The oldest people with the syndrome described so far are in their 40s.

A number of tumors have been reported in association with Aicardi syndrome: choroid plexus papilloma (the most common), medulloblastoma, gastric hyperplastic polyps, rectal polyps, soft palate benign teratoma, hepatoblastoma, parapharyngeal embryonal cell cancer, limb angiosarcoma and scalp lipoma.

==Genetics==
The syndrome is probably caused by a change (mutation) in one or more genes on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp22), but which gene or genes are mutated is not yet (2015) known.

Male fetuses with this change are unlikely to survive, which is because they only have one X chromosome. The individual boys with the syndrome described have also had the sex chromosome abnormality XXY syndrome (Klinefelter syndrome). Girls, who usually have two X chromosomes, can be born with the syndrome, because their second (normal) X chromosome compensates to some extent for the mutated gene.

The mutation leads to a characteristic malformation of the brain stem with a complete absence of the corpus callosum. As a rule, there are also signs that groups of brain cells have migrated incorrectly and placed themselves in the wrong place in the brain (heterotopias), an incorrect folding of the cerebral cortex (gyration abnormalities) or that the brain hemispheres are of different size.

=== Heredity ===
Aicardi syndrome is an X-linked dominant disease and arises as a new mutation. The mutation has then usually occurred in one of the parents&#x27; germ cells (eggs or sperm). The probability that they will again have a child with the disease is then estimated at less than 1 percent. However, the new mutation in the child becomes hereditary and can theoretically be passed on to the next generation. All cases of Aicardi syndrome are thought to be due to new mutations. No person with Aicardi syndrome is known to have transmitted the X-linked gene responsible for the syndrome to the next generation.

== Diagnosis ==

Aicardi syndrome is typically characterized by the following triad of features - however, one of the &quot;classic&quot; features being missing does not preclude a diagnosis of Aicardi Syndrome, if other supporting features are present.
# Partial or complete absence of the corpus callosum in the brain (agenesis of the corpus callosum);
# Eye abnormalities known as &quot;lacunae&quot; of the retina that are quite specific to this disorder; optic nerve coloboma; and
# The development in infancy of seizures that are called infantile spasms.

Other types of defects of the brain such as microcephaly, polymicrogyria, porencephalic cysts and enlarged cerebral ventricles due to hydrocephalus are also common in Aicardi syndrome.

Suspicion of infantile spasms or other epileptic seizures during the first months of life should always be urgently investigated. There can be many different causes besides Aicardi syndrome. The investigation includes EEG (electroencephalogram), which in case of infantile spasms shows a characteristic pattern (hypsarrhythmia), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, blood and urine samples and examination of the spinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid).

In Aicardi syndrome, MRI of the brain shows that the cerebral cortex is completely or partially missing. Sometimes it is possible to see that the cerebral cortex is thin and underdeveloped. Other changes can occur at the same time, for example fluid bubbles (cysts) in the brain&#x27;s fluid-producing structures (plexus choriodeus), different sized brain hemispheres and islands of nerve cells that did not migrate to the right place in the brain during fetal development. It is also possible to see that the fold pattern on the surface of the cerebrum has a different appearance (polygyry, microgyry). Absence of the cerebral cortex and other malformations of the brain also occur in conditions other than Aicardi syndrome.

On eye examination, the retinal lacunae appear as white spots in the fundus, where the retina is missing. Sometimes there are slits in the eye (coloboma), retinal detachment and abnormally small or differently sized eyes.

When X-raying the skeleton, it is sometimes possible to see that there are vertebral changes and extra ribs or that ribs are missing.

== Treatment ==

Treatment of Aicardi syndrome primarily involves management of seizures and early/continuing intervention programs for developmental delays.Additional comorbidities and complications sometimes seen with Aicardi syndrome include porencephalic cysts and hydrocephalus, and gastro-intestinal problems. Treatment for porencephalic cysts and/or hydrocephalus is often via a shunt or endoscopic of the cysts, though some require no treatment. Placement of a feeding tube, fundoplication, and surgeries to correct hernias or other gastrointestinal structural problems are sometimes used to treat gastro-intestinal issues.

Children with Aicardi syndrome come into contact with many different specialists in healthcare early on. It is therefore important that efforts are coordinated.

The drug treatment given for infantile spasms and other types of epilepsy is also given in cases of Aicardi syndrome. Epilepsy is often difficult to treat.

If medication does not help, after an examination at a regional hospital, a decision can be made as to whether another treatment may be appropriate. Since the cause of the epileptic seizures is found in many different places in the brain, however, epilepsy surgery is rarely an option in Aicardi syndrome.

Treatment with a ketogenic diet may be considered. It involves a carefully calculated diet that is rich in fat, contains a minimum of carbohydrates and provides the daily need for protein. The excess of fat forms starvation bodies (ketones) which can be used instead of glucose as a fuel source for the metabolism in the brain. For some children, this leads to fewer seizures. Treatment is started at regional hospitals by special teams with doctors, nurses and dieticians.

Another treatment option when the drug treatment of the epilepsy does not help is a so-called vagus nerve stimulator (VNS). The vagus nerve is one of twelve nerves that originate directly from the brain (cranial nerves). A small battery-powered box (generator) is operated under the skin under the left collarbone and a thin wire (electrode) from the generator is operated around the left vagus nerve. The generator is then set so that it sends electrical impulses to the brain via the vagus nerve at fixed intervals and fixed strength, which can be gradually increased if necessary. This can lead to a reduction in the number and strength of the seizures but almost never results in the seizures disappearing completely. This treatment is also started and followed up at the regional hospitals.

It is important that the child&#x27;s eyesight is used in the best possible way, and should therefore be examined by a pediatric ophthalmologist at an early stage to investigate visual function and the need for visual aids.

Problems from the gastrointestinal tract need to be investigated and can be treated with medication. If there is difficulty eating, nutrition may need to be received via a nasal tube or a so-called button (PEG, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), an operatively created connection to the stomach via the abdominal wall. It is important to closely monitor the child&#x27;s growth.

Preventive dental care and contact with a children&#x27;s dental care specialist (pedodontist) is needed, as the child may find it difficult to participate in tooth brushing and dental treatments.

Due to the risk of developing scoliosis, the back should be examined regularly. Scoliosis is primarily treated with a brace but may sometimes require surgery.

Children with Aicardi syndrome need rehabilitation interventions that also include vision rehabilitation. A habilitation team includes professional categories with special knowledge of disabilities and their effects on everyday life, health and development. The interventions take place in the medical, educational, psychological, social and technical fields. They consist, among other things, of investigation, treatment, testing of assistive devices, information about the disability and conversational support. Information about society&#x27;s support and advice on adapting the home and other environments in which the child lives is also given. Parents, siblings and other relatives also receive support. The family may need help with the coordination of various efforts.

The interventions are planned based on the needs of the child and the family, vary over time and always take place in close collaboration with people in the child&#x27;s network. In order to develop the ability to communicate, it is important to work early on with educational efforts as well as alternative and supplementary communication routes (AKK).

A close collaboration takes place with the municipality, which can offer various forms of interventions to facilitate the family&#x27;s everyday life. Personal assistance can be given to those who, due to severe and permanent disabilities, need help with basic needs, but also to expand the possibility of an active life despite extensive disabilities. Respite care, a contact family or short-term accommodation are other examples of support measures.

=== Adults ===
Adults with Aicardi syndrome need continued habilitation efforts and support in daily life. This could be, for example, support and care in a home with special services and daily activities.

== Prognosis ==

The prognosis varies widely from case to case, depending on the severity of the symptoms. However, almost all people reported with Aicardi syndrome to date have experienced developmental delay of a significant degree, typically resulting in mild to moderate to profound intellectual disability. The age range of the individuals reported with Aicardi syndrome is from birth to the mid-40s.

There is no cure for this syndrome.

== Epidemiology ==

Worldwide prevalence of Aicardi syndrome is estimated at several thousand, with approximately 900 cases reported in the United States. There is no definite information on how common Aicardi syndrome is, but the incidence is estimated to be around one in 100,000 newborns. There may be people who do not have the fully developed syndrome and who have not been diagnosed.

== History ==

This disorder was first recognized as a distinct syndrome in 1965 by Jean Aicardi, a French pediatric neurologist and epileptologist.

<text>A carrack (; ; ; ) is a three- or four-masted ocean-going sailing ship that was developed in the 14th to 15th centuries in Europe, most notably in Portugal and Spain. Evolving from the single-masted cog, the carrack was first used for European trade from the Mediterranean to the Baltic and quickly found use with the newly found wealth of the trade between Europe and Africa and then the trans-Atlantic trade with the Americas. In their most advanced forms, they were used by the Portuguese and Spaniards for trade between Europe, Africa and Asia starting in the late 15th century, before being gradually superseded in the late 16th and early 17th centuries by the galleon.

In its most developed form, the carrack was a carvel-built ocean-going ship: large enough to be stable in heavy seas, and capacious enough to carry a large cargo and the provisions needed for very long voyages. The later carracks were square-rigged on the foremast and mainmast and lateen-rigged on the mizzenmast. They had a high rounded stern with aftcastle, forecastle and bowsprit at the stem. As the predecessor of the galleon, the carrack was one of the most influential ship designs in history; while ships became more specialized in the following centuries, the basic design remained unchanged throughout this period.

==Name==

English &quot;carrack&quot; was loaned in the late 14th century, via Old French &quot;caraque&quot;, from &quot;carraca&quot;, a term for a large, square-rigged sailing vessel used in Spanish, Italian and Middle Latin.

These ships were called &quot;carraca&quot; in Portuguese, Genoese and Spanish, &quot;caraque&quot; or &quot;nef&quot; in French, and &quot;kraak&quot; in Dutch.

The origin of the term &quot;carraca&quot; is unclear, perhaps from Arabic &quot;qaraqir&quot; &quot;merchant ship&quot;, itself of unknown origin (maybe from Latin &quot;carricare&quot; &quot;to load a car&quot; or Greek &quot;καρκαρίς &quot;&quot;load of timber&quot;) or the Arabic القُرْقُورُ (&quot;al-qurqoor&quot;) and from thence to the Greek (&quot;kerkouros&quot;) meaning approximately &quot;lighter&quot; (barge) literally, &quot;shorn tail&quot;, a possible reference to the ship&#x27;s flat stern). Its attestation in Greek literature is distributed in two closely related lobes. The first distribution lobe, or area, associates it with certain light and fast merchantmen found near Cyprus and Corfu. The second is an extensive attestation in the Oxyrhynchus corpus, where it seems most frequently to describe the Nile barges of the Ptolemaic pharaohs. Both of these usages may lead back through the Phoenician to the Akkadian &quot;kalakku&quot;, which denotes a type of river barge. The Akkadian term is assumed to be derived from a Sumerian antecedent. A modern reflex of the word is found in Arabic and Turkish &quot;kelek&quot; &quot;raft; riverboat&quot;.
== Origins ==

By the Late Middle Ages, the cog and cog-like square-rigged vessels equipped with a rudder at the stern, were widely used along the coasts of Europe, from the Mediterranean, to the Baltic. Given the conditions of the Mediterranean, galley type vessels were extensively used there, as were various two masted vessels, including the caravels with their lateen sails. These and similar ship types were familiar to Portuguese navigators and shipwrights. As the Portuguese and Spaniards gradually extended their trade ever further south along Africa&#x27;s Atlantic coast and islands during the 15th century, they needed larger, more durable and more advanced sailing ships for their long oceanic ventures. Gradually, they developed their own models of oceanic carracks from a fusion and modification of aspects of the ship types they knew operating in both the Atlantic and Mediterranean, generalizing their use in the end of the century for inter-oceanic travel with a more advanced form of sail rigging that allowed much improved sailing characteristics in the heavy winds and waves of the Atlantic Ocean and a hull shape and size that permitted larger cargoes. In addition to the average tonnage naus, some naus (carracks) were also built in the reign of John II of Portugal, but were widespread only after the turn of the century. The Portuguese carracks were usually very large ships for their time, often over 1000 tons displacement, and having the future naus of the India run and of the China and Japan trade, also other new types of design.

A typical three-masted carrack such as the &quot;São Gabriel&quot; had six sails: bowsprit, foresail, mainsail, mizzensail and two topsails.

In the Republic of Ragusa, a kind of a three or four masted carrack called &quot;Dubrovačka karaka&quot; (Dubrovnik Carrack) was used between the 14th and the 17th century for cargo transport.

In the middle of the 16th century, the first galleons were developed from the carrack. The galleon design came to replace that of the carrack although carracks were still in use as late as the middle of the 17th century due to their larger cargo capacity.

== In Asia ==
Starting in 1498, Portugal initiated for the first time direct and regular exchanges between Europe and India—and the rest of Asia thereafter—through the Cape Route, a voyage that required the use of more substantial vessels, such as carracks, due to its unprecedented duration, about six months.

On average, four carracks connected Lisbon to Goa carrying gold to purchase spices and other exotic items, but mainly pepper. From Goa, one carrack went on to Ming China in order to purchase silks. Starting in 1541, the Portuguese began trading with Japan, exchanging Chinese silk for Japanese silver; in 1550 the Portuguese Crown started to regulate trade to Japan, by leasing the annual &quot;captaincy&quot; to Japan to the highest bidder at Goa, in effect conferring exclusive trading rights for a single carrack bound for Japan every year. In 1557 the Portuguese acquired Macau to develop this trade in partnership with the Chinese. That trade continued with few interruptions until 1638, when it was prohibited by the rulers of Japan on the grounds that the ships were smuggling Catholic priests into the country. The Japanese called Portuguese carracks &quot;Black Ships&quot; (&quot;kurofune&quot;), referring to the colour of the ship&#x27;s hulls. This term would eventually come to refer to any Western vessel, not just Portuguese.
The Islamic world also built and used carracks, or at least carrack-like ships, in the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. A picture of an Ottoman &quot;barca&quot; on Piri Reis&#x27; map shows a deep-hulled ship with a tall forecastle and a lateen sail on the mizzenmast. The &quot;harraqa&quot; (Saracen: &quot;karaque&quot;) was a type of ship used to hurl explosives or inflammable materials (firebomb in earthenware pots, naphtha, fire arrows). From the context of Islamic texts, there are two types of &quot;harraqa&quot;: The cargo ship and the smaller longship (galley-like) that was used for fighting. It is unclear whether the nomenclature &quot;harraqa&quot; has a connection with European &quot;carraca&quot; (carrack), or whether one influences the other. One Muslim &quot;harraqa&quot; named &quot;Mogarbina&quot; was captured by the Knights of St. John in 1507 from the Ottoman Turks and renamed &quot;Santa Maria&quot;. Gujarati ships are usually called &quot;naos&quot; (carracks) by the Portuguese. Gujarati &quot;naos&quot; operated between Malacca and the Red Sea, and were often larger than Portuguese carracks. The Bengalis also used carracks, sometimes called &quot;naos mauriscas&quot; (Moorish carracks) by the Portuguese. Arabs merchants of Mecca apparently used carracks too, since Duarte Barbosa noted that the Bengali people have &quot;great &quot;naos&quot; after the fashion of Mecca&quot;.

<doc id="878544" wikidata="Q3364342" url="?curid=878544" title="Centennial Olympic Park">
<text>Centennial Olympic Park is a public park located in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, owned and operated by the Georgia World Congress Center Authority. It was built by the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) as part of the infrastructure improvements for the 1996 Summer Olympics. It plays host to millions of visitors a year and several events, including a summer popular music concert series (Wednesday WindDown), the annual SweetWater 420 Fest and an annual Independence Day concert and fireworks display.

==History==
The park property had previously been a variety of vacant lots and abandoned or run-down industrial buildings. ACOG&#x27;s chief executive, Billy Payne, conceived the park both as a central gathering location for visitors and spectators during the Olympics and as a lasting legacy for the city. With the park being the showcase to the world during the Olympics, ACOG decided to hold a design competition to lay out and build the park. Landscape Architect EDAW, with the joint construction team of Beers/Russell, were selected to design and build the park by the Georgia World Congress Center Authority.

Centennial Olympic Park was constructed in two phases. Phase I of construction was completed July 1996, just in time for 1996 Olympic Summer Games at a cost of US$28 million. During the Olympics, the park contained sponsor exhibits, hosted entertainment and medal presentations, and was a hotbed for pin trading. Phase II construction took place shortly after the Olympics were over and was completed during the following year, in 1998, at the cost of US$15 million.

The celebrations in the park were marred by the July 27 bombing which killed two people (one from a heart attack) and injured 111 others. Security at the park and at all sporting venues was subsequently raised to include bag searches and metal detectors at all entrances. The bombing site is adjacent to the Park&#x27;s &quot;Centennial Tree&quot;. It was closed shortly after the Olympics for renovations, including installation of grass, until spring 1998.

On March 14, 2008, the park sustained minor damage when a tornado tore through downtown Atlanta. Two of the tall light towers were blown down. It was the first tornado to hit the downtown area since weather record keeping began in the 1880s.

On July 16, 2016, the park held events commemorating the 20th anniversary of the 1996 Olympics and Paralympics, including a volunteer reunion, concessions, and a fireworks show. In November, a commemorative plaque honoring the Games was unveiled.

On May 29, 2020, Centennial Olympic Park was the scene of the start of what was supposed to be a peaceful protest in respect of the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota four days earlier. The protest route was supposed to head to the capital and return to the park, but it was stopped at the CNN Center by the Atlanta Police Department. A riot subsequently broke out, resulting in damage and looting to several buildings, including the CNN Center.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Georgia, the park was closed to the public in July 2020. GWCCA executive director Frank Poe stated that Centennial Olympic Park relied on revenue from events taking place at the Georgia World Congress Center for the park&#x27;s upkeep. By April 2021, portions of Centennial Olympic Park were reopened to the public; however, the park only operated from 10:00 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday and public restrooms, visitors&#x27; center, the Fountain of Rings, and the amphitheater remain closed. On October 14, 2021, GWCCA officials announced that the park would be open daily from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. starting on October 18 and most of the previously closed areas would reopen; however, the Fountain of Rings would not have any music shows and public restrooms remain closed.

==Location==
The park is surrounded by many major Atlanta Landmarks; the Georgia World Congress Center, College Football Hall of Fame, State Farm Arena, the CNN Center, and Mercedes-Benz Stadium are all on the west side of the park and the Georgia Aquarium, National Center for Civil and Human Rights, and the World of Coca-Cola on the north side of the park. It is bounded by Marietta Street to the west, Baker Street to the north and Centennial Olympic Park Drive to the east and south.

Andrew Young International Boulevard, named for the former Atlanta mayor and United Nations ambassador, runs through the southern portion of the park. Since 2008, the area around the park has been marketed, and increasingly referred to in the press, as the Luckie Marietta District.
The Atlanta Streetcar passes along the east side of the park, with a stop for the park on Centennial Olympic Drive.



==Features==
A key feature of the park is the Fountain of Rings interactive fountain, which features computer-controlled lights and jets of water synchronized with music played from speakers in light towers surrounding it. It forms a splash pad that was designed for children to frolic in, as well as for concert-goers and joggers to cool off in on hot summer days. It consists of 251 jets that shoot in the air, and also creates a water sculpture that is essentially the front yard of the nearby museum. An important formal architectural landmark that is also a fun and playful space, the computer controlled fountain concept has since been replicated in other urban designs such as Dundas Square in Toronto and in commercial uses such as the Bellagio Fountains at the Bellagio Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The fountain area is surrounded by flags representing the host countries of each Summer Olympics preceding the 1996 games and eight light towers reminiscent of classical Greek marker columns. There are several pieces of sculpture scattered through the park, including &quot;Gateway of Dreams&quot;, a monument honoring Pierre de Coubertin, the father of the modern Olympic movement. A small amphitheatre is located at the southern end of the park.

The park has shows at the fountain all 365 days of the year, four times daily. They play at 12:30 p.m., 3:30 p.m., 6:30 p.m., and 9:30 p.m.

In July 2013, SkyView Atlanta, a transportable Ferris wheel, debuted across the street from the park. The wheel features 42 air-conditioned cars and views of the park and the surrounding area.

===Engraved bricks===
The park was paid for in part by the donations of thousands of individuals who bought bricks engraved with the short message of their choice and laid as pavers throughout the park. The contribution for each brick was $35. The message was allowed 15 characters on each of two lines. The finished bricks were laid in alternating light (tan) and dark (brick red) groups comprising a large portion of the 800,000 bricks used in the park&#x27;s construction. Many contributors ordered replica bricks to keep for themselves as souvenirs.

==Economic impact==
The park has become a catalyst for new development in Atlanta&#x27;s downtown. The new World of Coca-Cola opened on May 24, 2007, next to the Georgia Aquarium just north of the park, and the Imagine It! Children&#x27;s Museum of Atlanta opened on March 1, 2004, on a corner northeast of the park. Other significant attractions or developments surrounding the park include The Georgia World Congress Center, the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau, the Atlanta Apparel Mart, the Omni Hotel, the Tabernacle (formerly a House of Blues location during the games), SkyView Atlanta, a Ferris Wheel, the CNN Center, and the College Football Hall of Fame, State Farm Arena, and Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

In 2016, the park received the Downtown Economic Impact Award from Central Atlanta Progress Inc. Centennial Olympic Park was cited for attracting more than $2.4 billion in investment since opening in 1996.

<text>Mozilla was the mascot of Netscape Communications Corporation and subsequently the Mozilla Foundation. The mascot has varied in appearance, and was retired from active use in 2012.

== History ==

=== Name ===
The mascot&#x27;s name comes from a portmanteau of Mosaic, the original name of Netscape Navigator, and Godzilla. The name stood for &quot;Mosaic killer&quot;, as the company&#x27;s goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the world&#x27;s number one web browser, and was used as the codename for Netscape Navigator 1.0. Programmer Jamie Zawinski came up with the name during a meeting while working at the company. The name &quot;Mozilla&quot; later became more prominent when it was used for the open source browser of the same name.

=== Green design ===
Initially the mascot took various forms, including that of a helmeted astronaut, but the eventual choice of a Godzilla-like lizard went well with the theme of &quot;crushing the competition&quot;, and paid homage to the origin of its name. This design rendered Mozilla in the form of a green and purple cartoon lizard, designed by Dave Titus in 1994. Mozilla was featured prominently on Netscape&#x27;s web site in the company&#x27;s early years, but the need to project a more professional image (especially towards corporate clients) led to him being removed. 

Mozilla continued to be used inside Netscape, though, often featuring on T-shirts given to staff or on artwork adorning the walls of the Netscape campus in Mountain View. When Netscape acquired the website directory NewHoo in 1998, they rebranded it the Open Directory Project with the nickname &quot;DMOZ&quot; (Directory of Mozilla) due to its similarity to the Mozilla project. A green and purple image of Mozilla was placed on every page of the site, which continued even after Netscape&#x27;s disbanding when it was acquired by AOL.

=== Red design ===

With the launch of the mozilla.org web site in 1998, the mascot was redesigned as a larger, fiercer red &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;. The new design was by Shepard Fairey of &quot;Obey Giant&quot; and Barack Obama &quot;Hope&quot; poster fame. By September 2012, the mascot – referred to as &quot;the dino&quot; and &quot;he&quot; – had been &quot;retired from active duty&quot;, removed from official Mozilla branding, and replaced by a &quot;Mozilla&quot; wordmark, all lowercase and set in Meta Bold typeface. Subsequently, in July 2019, the latter had been replaced by &quot;moz://a&quot;, in Mozilla&#x27;s Zilla Slab Highlight typeface and within a rectangle of a tone or color contrasting with that of the lettering.

<text>The Stillwater Range is a mountain range located in western Nevada in the United States. It is a SSW–NNE running ridge, approximately long. It cuts across the center of Churchill County and extends partway into Pershing County.

The Stillwater Range separates the Carson Sink (to the west) from Dixie Valley (to the east). To the north, a low pass separates it from the East Range. To the south, the Sand Springs Pass separates it from the Sand Springs Range. Nestled against the south end of the range is Sand Mountain, an enormous tall sand dune which draws off-road vehicle enthusiasts from across Nevada and California.

A series of earthquakes measuring 6.6–7.1 on the Richter Scale, centered beneath or near the Stillwater Range, occurred between July and December 1954. As the area was then (and still is) sparsely populated, no fatalities and little property damage resulted. Extensive surface rupturing can be seen on the east slope of the range.

Several small mines can be found in the cliffsides of the mountains, many of which may not be marked on maps. Water running off the mountains is sometimes used to irrigate alfalfa fields. A notable point is the Steam Tractor Trail that begins of the eastern side. At the top of the trail is a steam tractor that was left there when the road was originally made.

The principal peaks of the Stillwater Range include Table Mountain (), Mount Lincoln () and Job Peak ().

<text>Joseph Matthews &quot;Wingy&quot; Manone (February 13, 1900 – July 9, 1982) was an American jazz trumpeter, composer, singer, and bandleader. His recordings included &quot;Tar Paper Stomp&quot;, &quot;Nickel in the Slot&quot;, &quot;Downright Disgusted Blues&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;ll Come a Time (Wait and See)&quot;, and &quot;Tailgate Ramble&quot;.

== Biography ==

Manone (pronounced &quot;ma-KNOWN&quot;) was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, of Sicilian descent. He lost his right arm in a streetcar accident when he was ten years old, which resulted in his nickname of &quot;Wingy&quot;. He used a prosthesis so naturally and unnoticeably that his disability was not apparent to the public.

After playing trumpet and cornet professionally with various bands in his hometown, he began to travel across America in the 1920s, working in Chicago, New York City, Texas, Mobile, Alabama, California, St. Louis, Missouri, and other locations. 

Manone&#x27;s style was similar to that of fellow New Orleans trumpeter Louis Prima: hot jazz with trumpet leads, punctuated by good-natured spoken patter in a pleasantly gravelly voice. Manone was an esteemed musician who was frequently recruited for recording sessions. He played on some early Benny Goodman records, for example and fronted various pickup groups under pseudonyms like &quot;The Cellar Boys&quot; and &quot;Barbecue Joe and His Hot Dogs.&quot; His hit records included &quot;Tar Paper Stomp&quot; (an original riff composition of 1929, later used as the basis for Glenn Miller&#x27;s &quot;In the Mood&quot;), and a hot 1934 version of a sweet ballad of the time &quot;The Isle of Capri&quot;, which was said to have annoyed the songwriters despite the royalties it earned them.

Manone&#x27;s group, like other bands, often recorded alternative versions of songs during the same sessions; Manone&#x27;s vocals would be used for the American, Canadian, and British releases, and strictly instrumental versions would be intended for the international, non-English-speaking markets. Thus, there is more than one version of many Wingy Manone hits. Among his better records are &quot;There&#x27;ll Come a Time (Wait and See)&quot; (1934, also known as &quot;San Antonio Stomp&quot;), &quot;Send Me&quot; (1936), and the novelty hit &quot;The Broken Record&quot; (1936). He and his band did regular recording and radio work through the 1930s and appeared with Bing Crosby in the 1940 film &quot;Rhythm on the River&quot;.

His 1939 recording, &quot;Boogie Woogie&quot;, featured the piano of Conrad Lanoue, who was part of Manone&#x27;s band from 1936 to 1940. In 1943, Manone recorded several tunes as &quot;Wingy Manone and His Cats&quot;; that same year he performed in Soundies movie musicals. One of his Soundies reprised his recent hit, &quot;Rhythm on the River.&quot;

Manone&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Trumpet on the Wing&quot;, was published in 1948.

From the 1950s, he was based mostly in California and Las Vegas, Nevada, although he also toured through the United States, Canada, and parts of Europe to appear at jazz festivals. In 1957, he attempted to break into the teenage rock-and-roll market with his version of &quot;Party Doll&quot;, the Buddy Knox hit. His version on Decca 30211 made No. 56 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop chart and it received a UK release on Brunswick 05655.

Manone&#x27;s compositions include &quot;There&#x27;ll Come a Time (Wait and See)&quot; with Miff Mole (1928), &quot;Tar Paper Stomp&quot; (1930), &quot;Tailgate Ramble&quot; with Johnny Mercer, &quot;Stop the War (The Cats Are Killin&#x27; Themselves)&quot; (1941), &quot;Trying to Stop My Crying&quot;, &quot;Downright Disgusted Blues&quot; with Bud Freeman, &quot;Swing Out&quot; with Ben Pollack, &quot;Send Me&quot;, &quot;Nickel in the Slot&quot; with Irving Mills, &quot;Jumpy Nerves&quot;, &quot;Mannone Blues&quot;, &quot;Easy Like&quot;, &quot;Strange Blues&quot;, &quot;Swingin&#x27; at the Hickory House&quot;, &quot;No Calling Card&quot;, &quot;Where&#x27;s the Waiter?&quot;, &quot;Walkin&#x27; the Streets (Till My Baby Comes Home)&quot;, and &quot;Fare Thee Well (Annabelle)&quot;. In 2008, &quot;There&#x27;ll Come a Time (Wait and See)&quot; was used in the soundtrack to the Academy Award-nominated movie &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot;.
==Death==
Manone died on July 9, 1982 in Las Vegas, Nevada, at age 82. He was survived by his son, Joseph Matthew Manone II, a musician, and grandsons Jimmy Manone (also a musician), Joseph Matthew Manone III, and Jon Scott (Manone) Harris.

Manone was featured in Episode 2, &quot;The Gift&quot;, in the 2001 documentary &quot;Jazz&quot; by Ken Burns on PBS on the topic of jazz in the 1920s.

<text>Dicksonia is a genus of tree ferns in the order Cyatheales. It is regarded as related to &quot;Cyathea&quot;, but is considered to retain more primitive traits, dating back at least to the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossil record includes stems, pinnules, and spores.

The genus contains 20–25 species, distributed from Mexico to Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Chile, St. Helena, New Zealand, New Caledonia, Australia, Indonesia, New Guinea, and the Philippines. New Guinea has the greatest diversity, with five species.

Species of &quot;Dicksonia&quot; found in cultivation include:
*&quot;D. antarctica&quot;, soft tree fern
*&quot;D. fibrosa&quot;, woolly tree fern
*&quot;D. squarrosa&quot;, rough or slender tree fern

The genus was first described by Charles Louis L&#x27;Héritier de Brutelle in 1788. The name honors James Dickson, a prominent nurseryman and botanist.

<doc id="878563" wikidata="Q1234019" url="?curid=878563" title="Kizil Caves">
<text>The Kizil Caves (also romanized as Qizil or Qyzyl; ; ) are a set of Buddhist rock-cut caves located near Kizil Township () in Baicheng County, Aksu Prefecture, Xinjiang, China. The site is located on the northern bank of the Muzat River 65 kilometres (75 km by road) west of Kucha. This area was a commercial hub of the Silk Road. The caves have an important role in Central Asian art and in the Silk Road transmission of Buddhism, and are said to be the earliest major Buddhist cave complex in China, with development occurring between the 3rd and 8th centuries CE. The caves of Kizil are the earlier of their type in China, and their model was later adopted in the construction of Buddhist caves further east. Another name for the site has been Ming-oi (), although this term is now mainly used for the site of Shorchuk to the east.

The Kizil Caves were inscribed in 2014 on the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Silk Roads: the Routes Network of Chang&#x27;an-Tianshan Corridor World Heritage Site.

==Caves==

The Kizil Caves complex is the largest of the ancient Buddhist cave sites that are associated with the ancient Tocharian kingdom of Kucha, as well as the largest in Xinjiang. Other famous sites nearby are the Kizilgaha caves, the Kumtura Caves, Subashi Temple and the Simsim caves. The Kizil Caves are &quot;the earliest representative grottoes in China&quot;. At the time the caves were created, the area of Kucha was following the orthodox Sarvastivadin school of Hinayana Buddhism, although an early and minority Dharmagupta presence has also been noted. The simpler square caves may have been established by the Dharmagupta from the 4th century CE or earlier, while the &quot;central pillar&quot; caves, which flourished from the mid-6th century CE, can rather be associated with the Sarvastivadin school.

===Overview===
There are 236 cave temples in Kizil, carved into the cliff stretching from east to west for a length of 2 km. Of these, 135 are still relatively intact. The earliest caves are dated, based in part on radioactive carbon dating, to around the year 300. Most researchers believe that the caves were probably abandoned sometime around the beginning of the 8th century, after Tang influence reached the area. Documents written in Tocharian languages were found in Kizil and a few of the caves contain Tocharian and Sanskrit inscriptions which give the names of a few rulers.

Many of the caves have a central pillar design, whereby pilgrims may circumambulate around a central column incorporating a niche for a statue of the Buddha, which is a representation of the stupa.

There are three other types of caves: square caves, caves &quot;with a colossal image&quot;, and monastic cells (kuti). Around two-thirds of the caves are kutis which are monks&#x27; living quarters and store-houses and these caves do not contain mural paintings. Chronology remains the subject of debate.

===&quot;Central pillar&quot; cave structure===
In the typical &quot;central pillar&quot; design, pilgrims can circumambulate around a central column incorporating a niche for a statue of the Buddha, which is a representation of the stupa. The so-called &quot;central pillar&quot; which appears on a plan is actually not a pillar at all but only the rock at the back of the cave, into which was bored a circular corridor allowing for circumambulation.

A large vaulted chamber is located in front of the &quot;central pillar&quot; column and a smaller rear chamber behind with two tunnel-like corridors on the sides linking these spaces. In the front chamber, a three-dimensional image of Buddha would have been housed in a large niche serving as the focus of the interior, however, none of these sculptures have survived at Kizil. The rear chamber may feature the parinirvana scene in the form of a mural or large sculpture, and in some cases, a combination of both. The &quot;central pillar&quot; layout is possibly related to the structural design of Kara Tepe in northern Bactria.

The program of the paintings in the &quot;central pillar&quot; caves generally follows a fixed arrangement: the walls of the main cella show sermons of the Buddha, the ceiling has rhomboid vignettes alluding to Jatakas, the central niche has the scene of the Indrasala Cave. The back room or corridor has scenes related to the Parinirvana, and finally the painting over the exit is related to the Tusita Heaven and the future Buddha Maitreya.

==Exploration==
The Kizil Caves were first discovered and explored in 1902–1904 by the Ōtani expedition, a Japanese expedition under Tesshin Watanabe (渡辺哲信) and Kenyu Hori (堀賢雄), funded by Count Otani, but the expedition left hurriedly after four months of exploration in the area of Kucha, following a local earthquake.

The Kizil caves were then explored by Albert Grünwedel, head of the Third German Turfan Expedition (December 1905 – July 6, 1907). Albert von Le Coq was also part of the third German expedition and was under the direction of Albert Grünwedel, but only remained until June 1906, when he had to leave for British India due to a heavy illness. The caves were photographed, drawings were made, and large portions of the murals were removed and sent to Germany.

Grünwedel removed a great number of paintings, but was careful to make records before doing so in order to retain their archaeological value, and to photograph or draw them before cutting them out, out of fear that they could be destroyed upon removal or during transport. He used a canvas to take quite precise records of the paintings. For example, Grünwedel recounts how he discovered a very interesting mural with warriors in the Cave of the Painters (207). Intending to remove it, he first made a precise drawing. But once the drawing was made, the mural disintegrated upon removal and was lost, except for a few fragments still in-situ. Altogether, the Third German Expedition still removed many paintings, and shipped almost 120 crates of murals to Berlin. Grünwedel published the result of his explorations in 1912 in &quot;Altbuddhistische Kultstätten in Chinesisch Turkistan, Bericht über archäologische Arbeiten von 1906 bis 1907 bei Kuča, Qarašahr und in der Oase Turfan&quot;.

Grünwedel discovered that the Kizil Caves were essential in the understanding of the development of Buddhist art, and suggested some forms of Western artistic influences as well:

The French explorer Paul Pelliot and his photographer Charles Nouette, who were in Kucha from January 1907, visited Kizil soon after the German mission, from September 1, 1907, over a few days, and Charles Nouette took many beautiful and informative photographs.

Albert von Le Coq came back to Kizil and surrounding areas in 1913–1914, heading the Fourth German Expedition, removing many paintings, including those Grünwedel had left in place, but generally taking much fewer records than his predecessor.

==Datation schemes==
===Albert Grünwedel and the German school===

In 1912 Grünwedel proposed in 1912 a structural scheme which remained influential throughout the 20th century. It is essentially based on the definition of two schools of art, &quot;Style 1&quot; and &quot;Style 2&quot;. Style I, qualified as &quot;Indo-Iranian&quot;, derives from the Art of Gandhara, and murals tend to have dark cinnabar backgrounds with green and orange color schemes and natural shading, and the architecture tends to consist in squarish caves with cupola ceilings. Style II derives from Sasanian art, and is characterized by a strong contrast between brilliant green-blue pigments. Architecturally, the caves of Style II have a central stupa-pillar surrounded by a circular corridor for circumambulation. According to Grünwedel, Style II was before the 8th century CE. After Grünwedel, Albert von Le Coq and Ernst Waldschmidt proposed dates, based in the epigraphic inscriptions found in the caves. They proposed to date Style I from 500 to 600, and Style II from 600 to 650 CE. These chronological guidelines remained extremely influential throughout the 20th century, as late as the 1980s.

===Modern attempts at Carbon 14 dating===
Various attempts at radio-carbon analysis were made over the years, with various degrees of success, but with the main effect of pushing back the dates of the first caves to circa 300 BCE, and challenging the German classification according to styles and colors schemes.

In 1979, a Chinese institute (文物保护科学技术研究所, &quot;Wenwu baohu kexue jishu yanjiusuo&quot;) carbon-tested caves 63, 47, 13.

====Su Bai====

In 1979–1981, Su Bai (宿白) of Beijing University (北京大学历史系考古教研室, &quot;Beijing daxue lishi xi kaogu jiaoyanshi&quot;) made an influential carbon-testing campaign for caves 47, 3, 38, 6, 171, 17, 190, 8. Based on these dates and on an analysis of the architecture of the caves (from the simpler to the more sophisticated), Su Bai proposed an influential dating scheme, pushing back the dates of the first caves to circa 300 CE.

====Huo and Wang====
In 1989–1993, Huo and Wang (中国社会科学院考古研究所, &quot;Zhongguo shehui kexueyuan kaogu yanjiusuo&quot;) tested the following caves: 224, 76, 4, 8, 34, 68, 77, 98, 104, 114, 117, 118, 119, 125, 129, 135, 162, 171, 180, 189, 196, 198, 206, 212, 219, 227, 27, 39, 48, 60, 69, 84, 91, 92, 99, 123, 139, 161, 165, 178, 207. They proposed a chronology which has some significant differences with the chronology previously proposed by Su Bai.

Japanese teams of Nagoya University (日本名古屋大学) tested in 1995, 1997, 1998 and 2011 the following caves: 8, 171, 224, 13, 67, 76, 77, 92, 205.

Many of the results remain inconclusive, sometimes even contradictory, and the historical period in question is rather too short in relation to the uncertainty margin of Carbon 14 datation, to provide a meaningful segmentation of the caves. Most narrow Carbon dates given for the Kizil Caves refer to a 68% probability level (1σ), which implies a significant level of uncertainty, and when dates are adjusted to the 95% probability level (2σ) as standard archaeological practice requires, then the timespan between the earliest and lowest dates becomes so large (about 200 to 300 years), as to make individual comparisons between the caves meaningless. Most researchers now use an approach combining artistic and architectural analysis together with carbon-dating, as a way to approach a reliable nomenclature, as proposed by Marylin Martin Rhie from 2001.

==Caves, murals and architecture==

In 1906, the German expedition team of Albert Grünwedel explored the Kizil Caves. Albert von Le Coq, who worked under the direction Grünwedel, had to leave in June 1906 due to health problems. Grünwedel generally photographed and copied the murals, before removing those he considered essential. Most of the fragments removed are now in Museum of Asian Art (formerly Museum für Indische Kunst) in Dahlem, Berlin. Other explorers removed some fragments of murals, that may now be found in museums in Russia, Japan, Korea and United States. Although the site has been both damaged and looted, around 5000 square metres of wall paintings remain, These murals mostly depict Jataka stories, avadanas, and legends of the Buddha, and are an artistic representation in the tradition of the Hinayana school of the Sarvastivadas.

Carbon-testing and stylistical analysis helped determine three main periods in the paintings at Kizil, which cover a period from 300 CE to 650 CE. The early art of Kizil correspond to the Western school of art in the Tarim Basin, and mainly displays influences from Gandhara and the Iranian world, particularly influence from the Hephthalites, and no influence from East Asia.

The Kizil Caves were designated by the Germans by a series of names, and have been separately numbered by the Chinese. A correspondence chart has been produced by Rhie.

Some very early caves, now numbered 90–17 to 90–24, have been discovered since the 1990s in the lower parts of the cliff at the entrance of the central valley. These caves were square or rectangular with barrel-vaulted ceilings, but without any decorations.

===General characteristics===

A notable feature of the murals in Kizil is the extensive use of blue pigments, including the precious ultramarine pigment derived from lapis lazuli from Afghanistan. In the classification of the art of the region by Ernst Waldschmidt, there are three distinct periods: the murals from the first phase are characterized by the use of reddish pigments, while those from the second phase used bluish pigments in abundance. The earlier paintings reflect more Greco-Indian or Gandharan influences, while the second ones show Iranian (Sassanian) influences. Later caves seem to have fewer legends and/or jatakas, being replaced by the repetitive designs of numerous small Buddhas (the so-called thousand Buddha motif), or sitting Buddhas with nimbuses. The paintings of the first two phases showed a lack of Chinese elements. The last phase, the Turkic-Chinese period, is most in evidence in the Turfan area, but in Kizil only two caves showed Tang Chinese influence.
Another characteristic of the Kizil murals is the division into diamond-shaped blocks in the vault ceilings of the main room of many caves. Buddhist scenes are depicted inside these diamond-shapes in many layers on top of one another to show the narrative sequences of the scenes.

====Color pigments====
The pigments in the painting of the Kizil Caves have been analysed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The reds are primarily vermilion and red lead, which today are greatly discolored, and red ocher. Blue pigments are from lapis lazuli. Green pigments are from copper
hydroxy chloride minerals such as atacamite. Brownish-black pigments are PbO2, obtained from the oxidation of red lead. White pigments were mainly obtained from gypsum.

====Style periods====
A broad classification of styles, formalized by Le Coq and Waldschmidt in 1933, has been generally accepted.

The first style is called &quot;Indo-Iranian style I&quot;, and cover all the early caves with delicate tone-on-tone paintings, using browns, oranges and greens. The name &quot;Indo-Iranian&quot; broadly denotes the artistic influence from India, combined with elements of Iranian art, that presided over the creation of the first cave paintings at Kizil. The main representative caves of this style are the &quot;Cave of the Hippocampi&quot; (Cave 118), the &quot;Cave of the Painters&quot; (Cave 207), the &quot;Peacock Cave&quot; (Cave 76), the &quot;Overpainted Cave&quot; (Cave 117), the &quot;Cave of the Statues&quot; (Cave 77), and the &quot;Cave of the Seafarers&quot; (Cave 112). The small group of the &quot;Treasure Cave&quot; (Cave 83, 84) is considered as contemporary, but in a slightly personal style, sometimes called &quot;Special Style&quot; (&quot;Sonderstil&quot;). The first style is only found in Kizil, except for one cave in nearby Kumtura: the &quot;Cave with the cupola&quot;.

The second style is called &quot;Indo-Iranian style II&quot;, and cover most of the other caves of Kizil, which use strongly contrasted colors and strong line strokes, using browns, oranges and greens and especially a vivid lapis-lazuli blue. The name &quot;Indo-Iranian&quot; again broadly denotes the artistic influence from India, combined with important influences from Central Asian and the Iranian world. This style is further divided in three broad periods.

Finally, a third Uighur-Chinese style appears in only two caves at Kizil.

==First Indo-Iranian Style: delicate &quot;orange and green&quot; paintings==
The Kingdom of Kucha, the most populous oasis in the Tarim Basin, occupied a strategic position on the Northern Silk Road, which brought it prosperity, and made it a wealthy center of trade and culture. Kucha was part of the Silk Road economy, and was in contact with the rest of Central Asia, including Sogdiana and Bactria, and thus also with the cultures of India, Iran, and coastal areas of China. Early visitors are known, such Maes Titianus. Since the 2nd century CE, under the auspices of the Han dynasty and the Kushan Empire, numerous great Buddhist missionaries passed through the Tarim Basin on their way to China, such as the Parthian An Shigao, the Yuezhis Lokaksema and Zhi Qian, or the Indian Chu Sho-fu (竺朔佛). Culture flourished, and Indian Sanskrit scriptures were being translated by the Kuchean monk and translator Kumarajiva (344–413 CE), himself the son of a Buddhist man from Kashmir and a Kuchean princess, sister of the King.

The 1st Style, sometimes called &quot;First Indo-Iranian style&quot; to denote influences from India and Central Asia, covers a period from 300 to 500 CE, and is characterized by Gandharan themes and orange and green hues, having a strong flavour of India: female dancers and musicians are often naked or half-naked with full breasts. The art of these paintings is quite refined, and forms the &quot;Classical&quot; period of the art of Kizil: the shades are delicate, the lines are fine and elegant, the colors blend progressively to give a sense of texture and volume. The paintings of Bamiyan in northern Afghanistan are generally considered as the precussors of the art of the Kizil Caves. Towards the end of the period, the influence of the art of Gandhara is considered as a consequence of the political unification of the area between Bactria and Kucha under the Hephthalites, which lasted from 480 to 560 CE, or a few decades later.

===Period 1: &quot;Classical&quot; early style (circa 300–400 CE)===
The earliest paintings at Kizil belong to a &quot;Classical&quot; stage. Their style is very elegant and &quot;painterly&quot;, with sophisticated shading of the bodies to express sculptural volume. The lines are refined and subtle, the colors blend softly. This style is also characteristically Indian, and may be related to Gandhara or Kashmir. This early style is exemplified by the &quot;Cave of the Hippocampi&quot; (Cave 118), and may form a distinctive school. This contrasts with the style of the following stage, as seen in the panels in the cella of the &quot;Cave of the Statues&quot;, such as the &quot;Cowherd Nanda&quot;, which is much bolder, using intense colors (but still browns, greens and oranges only), thicker lines and simpler patterns.

====Early paintings====
Early inscriptions in Tocharian, an Indo-European language using a derivation of the Indian Brahmi script is used in several early paintings on tablets, as found in the &quot;Cave above the cave of the coffered ceiling&quot; (Cave 171), or the &quot;Cave of the Niche&quot; (Cave 27).

====Earliest painted caves====

According to the Chinese chronicles of the Jin dynasty (265-316 CE), there were already a thousand Buddhist stupas and temples in Kucha by the 3rd century CE.

The earliest painted caves at Kizil are thought to be &quot;Cave of the Hippocampi&quot; (Cave 118) and &quot;Treasure Caves C and B&quot; (Caves 83 and 84 respectively). Cave 118, possibly the earliest of the three, is located deep inside the central valley. Cave 83 and 84 are located at the entrance of the same valley. These caves have simple architectural structures, together with paintings in a clear style, reflecting Indian influences. Noble or wealthy Tocharian donors from Kucha, wearing tunics, sometimes appear kneeling at the side of devotional paintings.

=====&quot;Cave of the Hippocampi&quot; (Cave 118, 300–350 CE)=====
The &quot;Cave of the Hippocampi&quot; (Cave 118) was visited and photographed by the Third German Expedition of 1906–1907, and by the French expedition of Paul Pelliot in 1907. Large portions of the murals were removed and sent to Germany, especially by von Le Coq in 1914, who removed the lunettes and the sides of the vault.

The cave consists of a rectangular room (3.6 x 4.8 meters), the entrance being on the long side, and the ceiling of which forms a transverse barrel vault. In front of the cave, which is accessible through a door, there used to be an equally wide open space, perhaps adorned with paintings, with remains of a pyramid roof. The two rooms are separated by a 1-meter-thick wall. The model for this kind of vaulted cave can be found in Bactria at Kara Tepe, dating from the 2nd-3rd century CE.

In the middle of the back wall of the main cella stands a large painting (3.42 m wide and 2.16 m high), with an unidentified scene of a King with attendants, possibly &quot;The skill and music in the heavenly palace&quot; (天宫伎乐). The attitudes and postures of the figures remind the reliefs of 3rd–4th century CE Nagarjunakonda. A king is seated at the center, with numerous attendants surrounding him, especially a near-naked woman seated to his left. They wear heavy round earrings with a central rosette design. The modeling of the faces reminds of the statuary of Hadda in Gandhara. The picture is elaborately framed by five successive decorative borders with naturalistic vine rinceau, suggestive of Roman art.

The colors of the murals are various shades of brown, with smatterings of light green, but no blue, defining the so-called &quot;orange and green&quot; style. The center of the ceiling has motifs of the sun and moon, two monks, and a bird flying with a human figure in its claws. The sides of the ceiling are composed of diamond-shaped mountains, around which are naturalistic motifs of humans, animals, lakes and trees, a possibly Near-Eastern design which was generally adopted in later caves at Kizil. A band of fantastic animals separated the ceiling from the side walls. The general style appears to be early, and possibly derived from Kashmir and Cave 24 at Bamiyan.

The lunettes bordering the ceiling display ornate Buddhist scenes. The right lunette is difficult to identify, but seems to represent a king or a Bodhisattava bending towards a warrior figure. The bottom portion shows a palatial scene, with a figure on a couch surrounded by devatas. The left lunette shows the Buddha of the future Maitreya in the Tusita Heaven. Below this is a depiction of Mount Sumeru surrounding by various Nagas, figures of devotees, and animals.

Small figures of kneeling devotees in tunics, about 40 centimeters tall, some armed with a dagger, appear next to the left and right corners of the back-wall mural: probably noble and wealthy Kuchean donors of the 4th century CE. One of the donors holds three burning incense cones. He is dressed in a bordered and turned-up, collarless tunic with close-fitting sleeves. The tunic, which reaches slightly above the knee, is belted. The pants are of the same color and have the same border. He wears gray calf boots with cruciate ligaments that run under the sole. The figure behind holds a wreath and a kind of censer, is dressed in a black belted lap jacket with tight-fitting sleeves, which is provided with a red border all around, and an ample green dress. Their hair is cut straight to the nuque, a hair style also referenced for the people of Kucha in the contemporary Chinese chronicles Jin Shu. A kneeling monk appeared next to the top left corner of the main mural, in a red robe and with ocher shorn hair, engaged in shaping a ceremonial jar with a hammer, while behind him appeared a painter wearing a tunic similar to those of the donors on the other side, but whose head only remained.

=====&quot;Treasure Cave C&quot; (Cave 83, 300–350 CE)=====

Cave 83 (Treasure Cave C) is part of the compact group of the four &quot;Treasure Caves&quot; (82, 83, 84, 85) located at the entrance of the central valley. It is a relatively small square cave (3.6x3.6m), with a podium in the middle, probably for a statue or a stupa. Here the ceiling has collapsed, but probably formed a cupola.

The back wall had a well-preserved scene of a Jataka story, the Rudrayana Legend from the Divyavadana, with king Rudrayana observing the dance of his Queen Chandraprabha, who appears nude except for thin veils and jewelry. During the dance, the king had a premonition that his wife would soon die, and she asked to become a Buddhist nun. The style and attitudes of the figures are generally Indian, such as the Tribhanga posture of the dancer, of the way the King is seated. The flutering ribbons of the diadem worn by the king however, were adopted from Iranian royal symbolism.

In this cave, the frames of the paintings, especially the vine rinceaux, are probably derived from Roman art of the 1st century CE. This cave may be slightly earlier then Cave 84. The mural was sent to Berlin by Grünwedel (Ref: MIK III 8443).

These paintings are soft and delicate: volumes are defined by gradations of shades and colors, not by the sharp limit of a line. Overall, &quot;the brush has the priority over drawing&quot;.

=====&quot;Treasure Cave B&quot; (Cave 84, 300–350 CE)=====
Cave 84 (Treasure Cave B) was a square, probably domed cave (4x4m, here too the ceiling has collapsed), examplifying an earlier, simpler cave structure at Kizil, which is also known from Bamiyan (Cave 24). The origin of the paintings in caves 84 seems Indian, probably from Kashmir. They show groups of people standing around figures of the Buddha, who is either seated or standing. The depth of placement is rather shallow, the figures are graceful with curved torsos. The faces are round and plump. Rhies suggest a date of the first half of the 4th century for Cave 84. All the paintings were sent to Berlin by Grünwedel.

These two caves are adjoined to cave 82, an undecorated vihara also dated to 300–350 CE, and cave 85, a small ruined cave.


====&quot;Peacock Cave&quot; (Cave 76, circa 400 CE)====

The &quot;Peacock Cave&quot; (&quot;Pfauenhöhle&quot; in German) is also an early cave, although dated slightly later to circa 400 CE, and next located &quot;Cave of the statues&quot; (Cave 77), in the second rocky outcrop just outside of the central valley. It has been carbon dated to mid 4th-end 5th century CE. It is said to be &quot;the most recognizably Indian in the whole Kizil cycle&quot;. The paintings echo the Art of Gandhara and the murals of Ajanta Caves.

A rectangular vestibule, the vaulted roof of which is now collapsed, preceded the main chamber. The main chamber has a domed ceiling, an innovation first seen in early caves at Bamiyan, and in caves 83 and 84 at Kizil. Numerous statuettes of the Buddha, as well as decorated wooden benches and low display tables were discovered in the antechamber of the cave.

In the center of the main chamber, there is a large podium, on which probably stood some major statuary associated with the Buddha. The architecture of the cave displays a marked advancement compared to earlier caves, but is anterior to the &quot;central pillar&quot; cave structure. Several paintings illustrate the life of the Buddha. Only the left wall of the main cella had remained in great part intact by the time Grünwedel visited. The top part of the wall showed four important moments of the life of the Buddha, while celestial observers stand on a balcony above: 1) the Birth of Siddharta and the first Three Steps in which the Buddha appears naked and already tall, 2) the Four Encounters outside of the palace, 3) the Seduction of Mara&#x27;s daughters, who are turned into old women, and 4) the Assault of Mara. The middle row was almost entirely damaged, although scenes of the Preaching Buddha were identifiable. The panels can be numbered 5 to 9, but 5 and 9 being half-panels going over the adjacent walls. In one of the panels appear soldiers similar to those of the Cave of the Painters. The bottom of the wall contained fragments of panels showing: 10) the Parinirvana, 11) devotees looking at the Buddha being put in a coffin, 11) The Buddha in his coffin, and 12) would have been the Cremation of the Buddha. The upper part of the mural was removed by Grünwedel, and sent to Germany in panels, where some are still held in the Museum für Indische Kunst.

This presentation of the various events of the life of the Buddha in successive panels reminds of examples from Gandhara, such as the Sikri stupa, although the panels in the Cave of the Peacock are remarkable by their rigorous chronological arrangement. Similar types of narrative panels have also been found in Andhra.

The dome over the cella is composed of eight pairs of segments filled with a flying apsara among peacock feather. Numerous devatas and Buddhas of the past are painted around the dome.

According to Historian of Art Benjamin Rowland, commenting one of the remaining fragments, the &quot;group of sword-bearing figures are recognizable Indian ethnic types&quot;.

Pictures of monks and one Kuchean donor holding a basket of flowers, all labeled with Brahmi inscriptions, appeared on the door wall. In the art of Kizil explanatory labels were often added to pictures of donors. On the contrary, such labels were never used for narrative representations.


====The &quot;Cave of the Seafarers&quot; (cave 212, circa 400 CE)====

The &quot;Cave of the Seafarers&quot; (&quot;Höhle der Seereise&quot;) is dated by Rhies to the early 5th century CE, based on stylistic analysis. Carbon dates are significantly later, circa 561-637 CE. The cave contained long narrative sequences about various paths to enlightenment. Most of the panels are now in the Dahlem Museum. The content of the paintings in the &quot;Cave of the Seafarers&quot; is clearly derived from Gandharan prototypes.

A painter &quot;Rumakama&quot; (, &quot;the one from Rome&quot;), appears in a Sanskrit inscription in the cave. The inscription, scribbled on the right side of the mural, reads:


According to Grünwedel, &quot;the circles (mandalâni) undoubtedly refer to the edges made of foliage and human skulls&quot;, that is the Classical border of acanthus leaves and Buddhist skulls painted along the inferior border of the mural.

The word Rumakama, or Romakam appears in the Kizil paintings as well as in the later Tibetan document, and is thought to refer to a painter who came from the Roman Empire or the Byzantine Empire.


===Period 2: &quot;New school&quot; with bolder style (circa 400–500 CE)===

Following the earliest &quot;Classical&quot; style of the paintings at Kizil, which was especially elegant and &quot;painterly&quot;, with sophisticated shading of the bodies to express sculptural volume, a new school appears with the &quot;Cave of the Statues&quot;, with works such as the &quot;Cowherd Nanda&quot;, which is much bolder, using intense colors (but still limited to browns, greens and oranges), thicker lines and simpler patterns, somewhat like &quot;colored drawings&quot;. This style is thought to be derived from the confluence of Hellenistic, Iranian and Indian influences under the Kushans, and its main center of creation was at Bamiyan, which became &quot;a kind of parent monastery for the settlement of monks in Central Asia&quot;.

This evolution in style is accompanied by a change in the main themes being portrayed. In the Classical period the story of the life of the Buddha and numerous Jataka tales took center stage. Now the main accent is on the sermons of the Buddha, which typically cover the walls of the main cella, together with the appearance of side and rear corridors in which are pictured the events of the death of the Buddha, the Parinirvana.

Rhie attributes the sudden variations of styles at Kizil, without much signs of internal evolution (especially in the early stages), to the sudden arrival of new groups of artists from other regions, bringing their own artistic idioms and techniques. This period is also marked by the appearance of the self-portraits of painters in long tunics and highboots armed with short daggers, such as the 
painter of the &quot;Cave of the Statues&quot; or the several painters of the &quot;Cave of the Painters&quot;, with often their own identifying labels in Sanskrit. The clothing style and type of these painters has often been described as Sasanian, but has recently been proposed as being rather Hephthalite, due to the similarities with the Hephthalite figures in Dilberjin Tepe, Balalyk Tepe or Bamiyan, and because the Hepthalites did control the Tarim Basin for nearly a century around this time period.

====&quot;Cave of the statues&quot; (Cave 77, 375–400 CE)====

The &quot;Cave of the Statues&quot; (&quot;Statuenhöhle&quot;) was a magnificent cave, located next to the &quot;Peacock Cave&quot; (Cave 76). It is a &quot;colossal image cave&quot;, with no niche in the main cella, but a podium on which a colossal standing statue of the Buddha probably stood. In an atypical design, the back corridor is quite large and wider than the main cella, with a width of 8.70 meters, for a height of 5.10 meters. Only seven other &quot;Colossal image caves&quot; are known in Kizil, including caves 47, 48, 70, 136, 139, 146. They are characterized by a very tall main cella designed to accommodate a gigantic image of the Buddha, the height of the cella reaching around 5 meters and sometimes as high as 16.5 meters (such as in cave 47), and also a rather tall back room (often around 5–6 meters high).

The numerous statues of the cave were made of clay and straw, fibers or hair for reinforcement, and often dated to the 6th century CE, but now rather dated to 375–400 CE in conjunction with carbon dates. Many of the statues were made from molds, which had Sanskrit names on them, which are probably the names of the crafsmen or the owners.

The cave is a &quot;central pillar&quot; cave, but the roof of the main cella, which formed a vault culminating at around 6 meters, has entirely collapsed. A few paintings remained on the walls of the main cella: they were sermons of the Buddha organized in several rows, the size of each of these pictures being 1.34 m wide and 96 cm high. The sermon images were &quot;of pure Gandhara style&quot;. Their style was very close to those of the &quot;Cave of the Painters (Cave 207)&quot;, and, according to Grünwedel, &quot;they seem to have been executed by the same hand&quot;. Albert Grünwedel attributed both caves to the same &quot;Stage I&quot; period (500–600 CE).

Several fine fragments of very fine painting have reached us, which are attributed to the Cave of the Statues. Grünwedel explained that only three paintings remained in the cella, all scenes of the sermon of the Buddha:

1) On the right wall of the cella, Grünwedel described the picture of a sermon, with &quot;a youth in light undergarment praying in front of Buddha&quot;, corresponding to the picture now described as the &quot;cowherd Nanda&quot;, known to have come from the Cave of the Statues. &lt;br&gt;
2) In the opposite location, on the left wall, Grünwedel described a sermon scene in which the Buddha &quot;only had his feet remaining&quot;, corresponding to the panel photographed by Charles Nouette in-situ in 1907.&lt;br&gt;
3) Finally Grünwedel described a sermon scene with only a &quot;kneeling adorant&quot; remaining, corresponding to the kneeling Vajrapani, known to have come from the Cave of the Statues.

The style of these panels from the main cella is markedly different from the refined, &quot;classical&quot; style of the side corridor vaults and the back corridor. They suggests different painters and different schools of art. In the cella, the paintings are much bolder, using intense colors, thicker lines and simpler patterns, as in the &quot;Cowherd Nanda&quot;. The colors of the paintings in the cella, although more intense, are still limited to browns, greens and oranges. The big eyes and wide eyelids remind of late Kushana works. These new types of paintings suggest the emergence of a bold new style in Kucha around that time.

A painter, holding a cup of paint, and whose clothes &quot;exactly match&quot; the painters in the &quot;Cave of the Painters&quot; (caftan, boots...) is visible in one of the murals of the cave. Originally at the front end of the left corridor, behind the first statue, the painting is now located in the Hermitage Museum. Two more devotee figures with the same clothes were located in the back corridor as well. 
One of the statues is a man in a particular type of armour with sectioned areas, which used to stand as a protector (possibly a Vajrapani) to the left side of the colossal Buddha of the main cella. This type of armour was in use for several centuries in art of the Northern segment of the Silk Road, and later became prevalent in China. The head is a tentative addition. Lü Guang, a Chinese general sent by Emperor Fu Jian (r. 357–385) of the Former Qin dynasty (351–394), who temporarily conquered Kucha in 383–385 CE, mentioned the powerful armour of Kuchaen soldiers, a type of chainmail and lamellar armour of Sasanian inspiration which can also be seen in the paintings of the Kizil Caves:


The side corridors are structurally highly sophisticated and remain visible to this day. A low platform runs along the external wall of each corridor, on which rows of statues were displayed, with murals behind them including the figure of the painter in tunic and boots. Above them, the top of each corridor formed a high vault, equipped with a lunette on the southern side, and decorated over its length with rows of devatas behind a balustrade, standing around a Buddha Maitreya, and on top of them landscapes with rhombus losange designs with monks, animals, trees and ponds, of the type seen in vault of the Cave of the Hippocampi (Cave 118).
The back corridor, also visible today, is quite unusual, as its vault is trabeated, formed of three flat longitudinal surfaces, on which figures of devatas are aligned like a deck of cards. On the bench along the back wall, stood a colossal reclining Buddha image in a scene of the Parinirvana, with elegant flying devatas hovering over the Buddha. Remains of female statues seated on the back bench were visible, with, at their, feet the bust of a man-elephant.

The style of the paintings in this cave, especially in the side and back corridors is very elegant and &quot;painterly&quot;, with sophisticated shading of the bodies to express sculptural volume. It is quite similar to the style of the &quot;Cave of the Hippocampi&quot; (Cave 118), and may belong to the same school. This refined style contrasts with the style of panels in the cella, the &quot;Cowherd Nanda&quot;, which is much bolder, using intense colors (browns, greens and oranges), thicker lines and simpler patterns. This divergence suggests that the &quot;Cave of the Statues&quot; may be transitional between these two early styles. Later caves such as the &quot;Cave of the Musicians&quot; point to an even more different style, using vivid colors and &quot;Ligne claire&quot; sharp lines to delineate body shapes together with the abundant use of intense blue pigments, with different roots inspired by the Western art of the 4th century CE.


====&quot;Cave of the Painters&quot; (Cave 207, dated 478–536 CE)====

The &quot;Cave of the Painters&quot; (&quot;Malerhöhle&quot;, 画家窟, Cave 207) is one of the earliest caves of Kizil, and one of the most beautiful. The cave contained a statue of the Buddha against the rear wall of the cella, and a barrel-vaulted ambulatory surrounded it. The main cellar contained nine murals of the preaching Buddha on each side wall.

The name of the cave comes from the numerous self-portraits of painters standing at the side of the murals, holding paint cupellas and brushes. Several of the painters have a label, such as the written label in Sanskrit (Gupta script): &quot;Painting of Tutuka&quot; ( &quot;Citrakara Tutukasya&quot;) next to the painter in question. &quot;Citrakara&quot; is not Tocharian, but Sanskrit (and later Hindi, ) for &quot;painter/ painting&quot;. In the art of Kizil identifying labels were often added to pictures of donors, but never to narrative scenes.

Paleography, stylistic analysis and carbon dating combine to give a date of circa 500 CE for these paintings. Some stylistic elements have a strong Classical touch, such as Roman-style friezes at the top of the walls, over scenes of the Buddha.

The Cave of the Painters, as some other caves at Kizil, depicts men in caftans with a triangular collar on the right side, and a unique hairstyle. Another marker is the two-point suspension system for swords, which seems to have been a Hephthalite innovation, and was introduced by them in the territories they controlled. These paintings appear to have been made during Hephthalite rule in the region, circa 480–550 CE. The influence of the art of Gandhara in some of the paintings at the Kizil Caves, dated to circa 500 CE, is considered as a consequence of the political unification of the area between Bactria and Kucha under the Hephthalites.

The paintings of the Caves of the Painters have been carbon dated to 478–536 CE. Albert Grünwedel in 1912 considered that the murals of the &quot;Cave of the Statues&quot; had been &quot;made by the same artists as those of the Cave of the Painters&quot;, and that they were in &quot;pure Gandhara style&quot;. Also, a self-portraited painter in the Caves of the Statues, holding a cup of paint, has clothes which &quot;exactly match&quot; those of the painters in the &quot;Cave of the Painters&quot; (caftan, boots...). The clothing style of the painters at Kizil has often been described as Sasanian, but is now rather considered as Hephthalite due to the similarities with the figures in Bamiyan, Dilberjin Tepe or Balalyk Tepe. Grünwedel attributed both caves to the same &quot;Stage I&quot; period (500–600 CE).

The main cella contains 18 scenes of the Buddha preaching. The niche must have contained a monumental statue of the Buddha, and paintings related to the Indrasala Cave narrative. The ceiling is prismatic, reproducing a type of architecture known from Bamiyan. The right corridor contained murals related to the War for the Relics and the Sharing of the relics of the Buddha, one of them showing armoured warriors on horses. The murals of the back corridor were almost entirely gone by 1912. Only a few traces remained, suggesting scenes of the Parinirvana. The left corridor had a beautiful mural showing a monk transmitting the teachings of the Buddha to a kneeling royal family, whether the mural in front of it on the external wall was entirely gone.

Similarities have been noted between the paintings of the Cave of the Painters and those of Dilberjin Tepe and Penjikent of the 5th–6th centuries.

====Cave 60: &quot;Largest Cave&quot;====
Cave 60, also called the &quot;Largest Cave&quot;, is a cave which was expanded over several periods, and still contained a few paintings belonging to the refined style of the Classical First Period, while most of the paintings are from the later Second Period. The cave is known for its portrait of royal donors, characteristically accompanied by a label in Brahmi script. This is the only known possible instance of a portrait of royal donors in a painting of the First Style, whereas they occur very often during the second period. The style of painting is very similar to that seen in the Cave of the Painters (Cave 207). The hairstyle of the male donor is quite similar to that of the famous painter in the Cave of the Painters.

The cave is also remarkable for the presence of Sasanian-style ducks in a bead roundel frames, a well-known motif which spread through Central Asia, and is known from the dress of a Central Asian ambassador from Afrasiab. This motif was likely painted later than the portraits of the royal donors.

==Second Indo-Iranian Style: strongly contrasted &quot;blue and green&quot; paintings==

The &quot;Second Indo-Iranian style&quot; evolved with a few intermediate stages, expressing continuous influence from India, combined with influence from the Eastern Iran sphere, at that time occupied by the Sasanian Empire and the Hephthalites, with strong Sogdian cultural elements. The Hephthalites lost political power circa 550 CE after being defeated by the Sasanids and the Western Turks, but they remained influential for a long time, having fragmented into semi-independent Principalities. Sogdia, at the center of a new Silk Road between China to the Sasanian Empire and the Byzantine Empire became extremely prosperous around that time.

=== Central-Asian stylistic elements ===
This style is characterized by strong Iranian-Sogdian elements probably brought with intense Sogdian-Tocharian trade during the period, the influence of which is especially apparent in the Central-Asian caftans with Sogdian textile designs, as well as Sogdian longswords of many of the figures. Other characteristic Sogdian designs are animals, such as ducks, within pearl medallions. Indo-Iranian influence also appears in mythological figures, such as the bird Garuda with snakes in its beak, the wind god Vayu, the sun god Aditya or the moon god Chandra.

The use of strongly contrasted &quot;blue and green&quot; colours, made possible by the importation of lapis lazuli blue pigments from Central Asia, and the drawing of a line for contours, are characteristic of this style. This style, exemplified by the &quot;Cave of the Musicians&quot;, using vivid colors and &quot;Ligne claire&quot; sharp lines to delineate body shapes, seems to be inspired by the Western art of the 4th century CE, and is very different from the style of the Kizil caves of the earlier period, which on the contrary is very elegant and &quot;painterly&quot; with nuanced colors and sophisticated shading of the bodies to express sculptural volume, and which probably points to different artistical roots. Still no East-Asian influence is visible in these paintings.

===Period 1: Initial transitional style===
The first period consist in a short interval of transitional style, in which paintings remain subtil and rather nuanced, but blue pigments have started to appear. The &quot;Cave of the Devil C&quot; (Cave 198) and &quot;Cave of the Devil A&quot; (Cave 199), as well as the &quot;Cave with the Steps&quot; (Cave 110) and sometimes the &quot;Red-domed Cave A&quot; (Cave 67) are considered as the first period of this new style.

===Period 2: main stylistic period===
==== &quot;Cave of the Musicians&quot; (Cave 38) ====

According to Rhie, the &quot;Cave of the Musicians&quot; is probably the earliest of the &quot;central pillar&quot; caves at Kizil, dated to the mid-4th century CE, and its iconography is also among the earliest. Carbon testing by Su Bai gave dates ranging from 310 +/-80 CE to 350 +/-60 CE (i.e. a maximum range of 230-410 CE). Huo and Wang attributed the cave to the Second Period, giving it a date from mid-4th to late 5th century (circa 350–499 CE). The traditional German datation estimated the cave to be from the 600–650 CE period, and presented it as an example of the later &quot;Blue-green style&quot;, said to succeed chronologically the &quot;Orange-green style&quot; group.

The so-called &quot;central pillar&quot; which appears on a plan is actually not a pillar at all but only the rock at the back of the cave, into which was bored a circular corridor allowing for circumambulation. There is a niche in the &quot;central pillar&quot; designed to house a statue of the Buddha, and two other niches on each side of the main entrance, and niches in the back corridor. The central niche probably depicted the Buddha meditating in the Indrasala Cave, with a background decoration of a mountain, a recurring central theme at Kizil. Maitreya, the Buddha of the future, in the Tusita Heaven, appears in a beautiful mural over the exit door. Structurally, the cave remains relatively simple, as it does not have an anteroom or vestibule.

The style of the paintings is derived from the Art of Gandhara and Kashmir, the Art of Mathura and early Gupta art, with striking influences from Roman art and the art of Palmyra. Kumārajīva is known to have travelled repeatedly between Kucha and Kashmir around this time, and he may have been instrumental, among many others, in the transmission of this art. The structural prototype of the cave may be Kara Tepe in Bactria. The flat, well-delineated surfaces of the paintings remind of the Roman Opus sectile technique, which prospered circa 331–359 CE.

==== Cave 14: Central Asian traders====

Cave 14, a small and nearly square room with a vaulted ceiling (2.17x2.17 meters), is considered as later than the &quot;Cave of the Musicians&quot;, and dated to the late 4th century CE to early 5th century CE, circa 400 CE, by Rhie. The cave has many designs showing Central Asian traders encountering various dangers on their way, such as being lost in the dark, and being saved by the Dragon-King Mabi. Cave 14 is considered as an important historical marker for the dress styles or the armour types worn by some of the figures.

==== Cave 17: Tocharian royalty (circa 500 CE) ====

Cave 17 (&quot;Cave of the Bodhisattva Vault&quot;) is large &quot;central pillar&quot; cave located near Cave 14, and high up on the rock to the right of Cave 8. It was probably the main cave of the group of caves from 14 to 19, which also includes several undecorated living quarters or viharas, and was dedicated to religious services. Su Bai dates Cave 17 to the Second Stage (395–465 CE -+65), together with Cave 14. Luo and Wang date it to 465 CE +-65. Rhie attributes Cave 17 to circa 500, based on stylistic considerations. It is a &quot;central pillar&quot; cave, with a small, very colorful, square cella (3.80x3.90 meters) with a vaulted ceiling, a central pillar with two side corridors, and a back room. These caves were possibly small chapels to nearby viharas.

In Cave 17, on the lower left panel of the entrance wall, appeared a Royal family, composed of the King, Queen and two young Princes. They are accompanied by monks, and men in caftan. The relief is now in the Hermitage Museum. The King wears a crown and a triple halo, with Sasanian-type royal ribbons. He wears a long white caftan decorated with small diamond designs, and has long boots. His right hand is in front of his chest, holding an incense lamp, and he holds an akinakes sword and a red bag in the left hand. The end of a long knight&#x27;s sword is visible behind the first boot. The king can be identified as a Tocharian king of Kucha. His Queen wears a long robe, and his two sons, Princes, wear ornate caftan and are fair-haired.

According to Historian of Art Benjamin Rowland, the portraits in Kizil show &quot;that the Tocharians were European rather than Mongol in appearance, with light complexions, blue eyes, and blond or reddish hair, and the costumes of the knights and their ladies have haunting suggestions of the chivalric age of the West&quot;. The Chinese named Kuchean kings by adding the prefix &quot;白&quot;, meaning &quot;white&quot;, probably pointing to the fair complexion of the Kucheans. The Chinese Monk Xuanzang in 645 CE, noted that &quot;they clothe themselves with ornamented garments of silk and embroidery&quot;.

This cave also shows Central Asian traders encountering various dangers on their way, such as being lost in the dark, and being saved by the Dragon-King Mabi. Another is the story of the good merchant Sabu (萨缚), who, in order to show the way to a party of 500 merchants lost in the darkness, puts his own arms on fire to use them as torches, and successfully rescues them. The story appears in numerous paintings, in which the merchants are in Central Asian garb and accompanied by camels, and Sab has the attributes of a Bodhisattva.

Cave 17 is contemporary with the earliest decorated Mogao Caves near Dunhuang (caves 268, and ), which were built and decorated by the Northern Liang between 419 and 439 CE, before the invasion of the Northern Wei. They have many stylistic characteristics in common.


==== &quot;Cave of the Sixteen sword bearers&quot; (Cave no. 8, 432–538 CE) ====

The &quot;Cave of the Sixteen sword bearers&quot; (&quot;Höhle der Schwertträger&quot;, 十六带剑者窟) is a famous cave with a series of murals showing swordsmen wearing caftans and armed with long sword and daggers. These murals have been carbon dated to 432–538 CE. The swordsmen have also been dubbed the &quot;Tocharian donors&quot;.

The interpretations of the nationality or ethnicity of the donors have varied. Some authors claim that the donors are indeed Tocharians, an elusive people of the Tarim Basin who spoke the well-documented Tocharian language, the easternmost Indo-European language. According to this thesis, the donors in the murals are of the Indo-European type, wearing Iranian-style clothes and reddish hair.

A more recent interpretation is that the sword-bearers are actually Hephthalites, who are known to have occupied the Tarim Basin from 490 to 560 CE, precisely at the time the paintings were made. Kucha was specifically part of their dominion between 502 and 556 CE. The clothing style, the iconography and the physionomy of the donors are said to be extremely close to those depicted in the paintings of Tokharistan (Bactria), the center of Hephthalite power, at sites such as Balalyk tepe or Dilberjin Tepe. In particular, the coat with single folded lapel is considered as a result of Hephthalite influence, whereas traditional Kuchean coats had two lapels. At present, the most prevalent opinion among academics seems to be that the Hephthalites were initially of Turkic origin.

Similar donors can be seen in the Kumtura Caves.

In the &quot;Cave of the Sixteen sword bearers&quot;, the murals of the sixteen sword-bearers are located in the lateral left and right corridors around the central pillar, simulating a procession of devotees. The sides of the main room are occupied by panels showing groups around seated Buddhas, while the vault is decorated with a myriad of small Buddhas with emanating flames.


The rear corridor, forming a back-room behind the central pillar, is a barrel-vaulted rectangular room with the two corridors for side access. It was decorated by many spectacular murals, including a large mural showing the sharing of the relics, with soldiers in armour riding horses and elephants (β on the plan). The vault was lavishly decorated with flying asparas holding musical instruments. The back wall had a depiction of the Parinirvana with a reclining image of the Buddha, and asparas flying over. The murals were photographed in black and white in-situ by Charles Nouette in September 1907, but all of them were later taken to Germany by Von Le Coq. A reconstruction of the rear corridor was recently built in the Museum für Asiatische Kunst.


==== Cave 181: Cave of the High Place in the Small Valley====

The &quot;Cave of the High Place in the Small Valley&quot; (Cave 181), also called the &quot;Highest Cave&quot;, is described extensively by Albert Grünwedel, as a particularly interesting cave of the small ravine. He explains that the cave is located high up on the right side of the ravine, which accounts for the fact that its murals have been preserved from the usual iconoclastic vandalism: the faces in particular are well preserved. Also, the murals did not use gold foils for decoration, which reduced the incentive for theft. In his plates, Grünwedel illustrates the murals of the cave, where he names the cave by its official name: &quot;Hochliegende Höhle der 2. Schlucht&quot; (&quot;Cave of the High Place in the 2nd Valley&quot;), which is the German name for cave 181.

Grünwedel explains that the structure of the cave is extremely rare, as it is not a barrel-vaulted cave: instead, the ceiling has the shape of a tent. The flatness of the sides of the tent-like ceiling is the reason why Grünwedel was able to remove easily most of the ceiling paintings in large panels, something which is impossible with the strongly curved surface of a barrel-vaulted ceiling. The tent-like ceiling is bordered by a row of seven bejewelled princes on each side.

The side wall depict rather tumultuous scenes of the sermon of the Buddha, no fewer than eight of them, with a multitude of attendants in various attitudes and clothing. The entrance wall had paintings of Tocharian donors and monks on both side. Above the entrance was the usual painting of Maitreya with surrounding Devaputras. The side corridors had paintings of Jataka stories, while the back corridor behind the niche had a bench or pedestal along the back wall for the display of the Parinirvana of the Buddha, with deities flying over. On the opposite wall was a scene of the Cremation of the Buddha. Grünwedel sent most of the murals to Germany.

A headless wooden statue of a &quot;Dhyanasana&quot; Buddha, about 164 cm tall, was found in the cave.

The murals and the paintings of the ceiling are generally attributed to Cave 181, but some authors attribute them to Cave 178 instead. To add to the confusion, von Le Coq wrote in 1924 that the paintings of the ceiling actually came from barrel-vaulted Cave 184, and he claimed that Grünwedel, who accomplished the removal of the murals in 1906–1907, wrongly described the vault as being &quot;tent-like&quot;. Access to cave 181 has remained difficult, and it has also been claimed that it was never painted.

===Period 2 (later phase, 500–700 CE)===

The 3rd phase covers a period from the mid-6th century CE to the early 7th century CE. Carbon testing from this period gave dates ranging from 545 +/-75 CE to 685 +/-65 CE (i.e. a maximum range of 470–750 CE). Maya Cave (n.224) is one of the famous caves from this period. Historically, the paintings of this period seem to correspond to the Turk expansion, following their uprising against the Rouran Khaganate in 552 and their subsequent territorial expansion. This can also be seen the style of armour of some of the soldiers in the murals, especially with their pear-shaped helmets.

Vivid colors are used, with great contrast, sometimes quite unnaturally and in a garish manner. A lot of lapis lazuli blue is incorporated in the palette of this artist. Skin color or hair color are often quite unnatural. Backgrounds often have plenty of flowers, fruits or leaves. Ornaments are often extravagant. Again, no East-Asian influence is visible in these paintings.

==== Māyā Cave (Third complex, cave 224, c.550–600 CE) ====
&quot;Maya Cave (Cave 224)&quot; of &quot;III Anlage&quot; is one of the most famous caves of the Third Period. It is dated to circa 550–600 CE, and possibly follows the events of the Turk uprising against the Rouran Khaganate in 552 CE and the subsequent Turk expansion. The helmets of the Knights depicted in some of the murals have been said to be characteristic pear-shaped segmented helmets of the Turkic type.

A famous mural of the Mourning of the Buddha at his Cremation appears in Maya Cave (224), from the rear passage of the cave, with various figures in ethnic costumes. Three of the men among the mourners cut their forehead skin or chest with their knives, a practice of self-mutilation practiced by the Scythians. One of the mourners if is thought to be a Turk.

==== Māyā Cave (Second complex, Cave 205, end 6th century CE) ====

&quot;Maya Cave of &quot;II Anlage&quot; (Cave 205)&quot; has been carbon-dated to the 6th–7th century CE. The cave has an inscriptions in Sanskrit mentioning the King of Kucha Anantavarma. He is shown accompanied by two armed attendants.

A Prince appears with his wife in the adjacent frescoes, mentioned in a nearby inscription as the future king Tottika and his princess Swayamprabha.

This cave has been rather precisely dated to the end of the 6th century CE, based on the names of the rulers found in the inscriptions, particularly King Tottika and his wife Svayamprabha (a Sanskrit name), who also appear together with Suvarnapushpa (known to have ruled 600–625 CE) and his son Suvarnadeva in the inscriptions on the walls of the Red-dome Cave. The epigraphy also suggest dates later than the Cave of the Painters, with its more ancient inscription about the &quot;painter Tutuka&quot;.

==== Red-dome Cave 67: more royal dedications ====
Another nearby cave, the &quot;Red-domed Cave A&quot; (Cave 67) also has inscriptions mentioning a list of donors including a queen and six kings, among them Suvarnapuspa (ruled 600–625 CE) and his son Suvarnadeva (ruled 625–648 CE). Also included in the inscriptions are the names of King Tottika and his wife Svayamprabha (a Sanskrit name), who also appear in the Maya Cave of the Second Group (Cave 205), suggesting proximity in time of these two caves. The epigraphy also suggest dates later than the Cave of the Painters, with its more ancient inscription about the &quot;painter Tutuka&quot;.

The Red-dome cave contained a library in which were found very old manuscripts, including one of the oldest known manuscripts in Sanskrit.

==== Cave 69: portrait and dedication of the king of Kucha (securely dated to 600–647 CE) ====

This period has the only known secure dating in the Kizil Caves: Cave 69 has a painting of a royal Kuchean couple with an inscription in the halo of the King: &quot;Temple Constructed for the Benefit of Suvarnapushpa by His Son&quot;, Suvarnapuspa having ruled between 600 and 625, and his three sons died before 647 CE according to Chinese sources.

When he visited Kucha in 630 CE, the Chinese monk Xuanzang received the favours of Suvarnadeva, the son and successor of Suvarna-puspa, and Hinayana king of Kucha.

Xuanzang described in many details the characteristics of Kucha (屈支国 &quot;qūzhīguó&quot;, in &quot;大唐西域记&quot; &quot;Tang Dynasty Account of the Western Regions&quot;), and probably visited Kizil:&lt;br&gt; 
1) &quot;The style of writing is Indian, with some differences&quot;&lt;br&gt;
2) &quot;They clothe themselves with ornamental garments of silk and embroidery. They cut their hair and wear a flowing covering (over their heads)&quot;&lt;br&gt;
3) &quot;The king is of Kuchean (&quot;屈支&quot; &quot;qūzhī&quot;) race&quot;&lt;br&gt;
4) &quot;There are about one hundred convents (saṅghārāmas) in this country, with five thousand and more disciples. These belong to the Little Vehicle of the school of the Sarvāstivādas (Shwo-yih-tsai-yu-po). Their doctrine (teaching of Sūtras) and their rules of discipline (principles of the Vinaya) are like those of India, and those who read them use the same (originals).&quot;&lt;br&gt;
5) &quot;About 40 li to the north of this desert city there are two convents close together on the slope of a mountain&quot;.

These events were soon before the Tang campaign against Kucha in 648 CE.

===Period 3: final narrative evolution===
The final stage at Kizil is Period 3 of the Second Indo-Iranian Style. Towards the end of its florescence, Kizil saw the emergence of the domed central pillar cave, a type of &quot;central pillar&quot; structure, with niche and circumambulating corridor, but with a very uncharacteristic near-cubic main cella crowned by a magnificent cupola decorated with divinities. The style of painting is very refined, and can also be seen in some other caves in the region such as in Kumtura. The iconography too has evolved, with a cosmological Buddha becoming omnipresent and majestic, often surrounded by myriads of emanations of smaller Buddhas. This exceptional and very refined type of cave is exemplified by Cave 123, the &quot;Cave with the Ring-Bearing Doves&quot;. It represents a final narrative evolution, in which the figures of the cosmological Buddha predominate, while secondary figures and stories take an ever-smaller role.

====&quot;Cave with the Ring-Bearing Doves&quot; (Cave 123) ====

The &quot;Cave with the Ring-Bearing Doves&quot; (Cave 123) had a type of &quot;central pillar&quot; structure, with niche and circumambulating corridor, but with a very uncharacteristic cubic main cella crowned by a magnificent dome decorated with divinities. The main cella forms a square vestibule or main hall (3.42 x 3.42 meters) in front of the pillar forming the back wall, the vestibule being surmounted by a decorated dome. The prototype for the dome decorated with standing Buddhist deities is to be found in Group C of the caves at Bamiyan. It can also be seen in some other caves in the region, such as in Kumtura.

The cave is named after a pattern of &quot;flying geese holding a wreath&quot; (or ring). This pattern is also known from Cave 69, which is dated to 625–647 CE because of the depiction and inscription of a historically identified king. Because of this marker, Cave 123 may be dated to the same period.

Two monumental Buddha images occupy the sides of the main cella. They have full-body &quot;mandorla&quot; halos filled with a multitude of sitting or standing Buddhas. These monumental images represent the second Great Miracle of the Sakyamuni Buddha at Shravasti. The myriads of Buddhas emanating from him, each standing on a lotus, are a result of his deep meditation at Shravasti, as recounted in the &quot;Divyavadana&quot;. This understanding of the Great Miracle is most prominent among the Sarvastivadin and the Mulasarvastivadin. The two monumental Buddhas are surrounded by attendants, some light-skinned and some dark-skinned, and a Vajrapani.

The side corridors also have similar Buddha images, but this time with a supplementary decorated band around the Buddha, which is filled with a row of ring-bearing doves, hence the name given to the cave. All Buddha images are surrounded with numerous attendants, Devatas and Vajrapanis.
The paintings were in great part brought to Europe by the fourth Royal prussian expedition to Central Asia of 1913–1914 led by Albert von Le Coq. The cave was reconstructed in Berlin around 1928, but suffered damage during the war. It has been reconstructed again recently in the Museum für Asiatische Kunst. The painting of the left side wall remains in-situ, quite damaged.

The cave is quite outstanding and refined, either in terms of architecture and decoration, and departs from the mainstream of other caves at Kizil. Marianne Yaldiz has called it &quot;One of Xinjiang&#x27;s Mysteries&quot;. Untypically, the narrative scenes are placed over the entrance, taking second position to the monumental standing Buddhas of the side wall. This is a layout which became popular farther east in Gansu. In a final narrative evolution, the cave magnifies the figure of the Buddha, and gives an ever smaller role to secondary figures and stories.


====Other caves of the third period====
The &quot;Center Cave&quot; (Cave 186), the &quot;Third to Last Cave&quot; (Cave 184) and the &quot;Third Cave from the Front&quot; (Cave 187) are also considered as representatives of this third period.

==Uighur-Chinese Style (8th–9th century CE)==

A 4th period, also described as &quot;The third style&quot; receives strong influence from Chinese painting, a result of the artistic activity and expansion of the Tang dynasty. The civilization of Kucha, with the whole Tarim Basin from Turfan to Khotan, fell to the Chinese punitive invasion of 648 CE, putting an end to the Indo-Iranian styles of Kucha. Ashina She&#x27;er, the East Turkic general leading the Tang dynasty expeditionary corps, ordered the execution of eleven thousand Kuchean inhabitants by decapitation. It was recorded that &quot;he destroyed five great towns and with them many myriads of men and women... the lands of the west were seized with terror.&quot;

Two caves at Kizil have art of the Tang period: cave 43 and cave 229. In nearby Kumtura and in Turfan, Chinese styles now prevailed.

In 670 CE, the Tibetan Empire conquered most of the Tarim Basin, including Khotan, Kucha, Karashahr and Kashgar, which they kept until the Chinese took back the control of the area in 692.

In 753 CE, the northern part of the Tarim Basin was taken over by the Turks of the Uyghur Khaganate, based in Turfan. A new Tibetan conquest took place in 790 CE. By 900 CE, the area was under Muslim domination.

==Texts and inscriptions==
===Love poem===
Most of the texts known from the Tocharians are religious, except for one known love poem in Tocharian B, found in Kizil and dated circa 600 CE (manuscript B-496):

===&quot;Kyzil library&quot;===
The Kyzil library had some of &quot;the oldest copies of the Indian theatre known today&quot; written in Sanskrit or in Tokharian B: these Indian plays, called Nāṭaka in Sanskrit literature, alternate prose and verse, music and pantomime, and also provide scenic indications so that a single performer can enact a complete play by changing attitudes and voices. These plays are at the origin of the &quot;chantefables&quot; or Chinese &quot;transformation texts&quot; called &quot;Bianwen&quot;.

===13th century Tibetan document about Kizil===

Albert Grünwedel, one of the German discovers of the Kizil Caves, found in Saint-Peterburg a 13th-century Tibetan text related to Kucha and the Kizil Caves, including a map, which describes the caves from the perspective of Tantric Buddhism. According to the Tibetan text, the paintings in some of the caves were commissioned by a Tokharian (Thogar) king called &quot;Mendre&quot; (probably Māndhātṛ) with the advice of Anandavarman, a high-ranking monk. The king ordered an Indian artist, Naravahanadatta, and a Syrian artist, Priyaratna, with their disciples to paint the caves. The neighbouring Khotanese kings Vijayavardhana and Murlimin also assisted with the painting of another cave by sending artists to the site.

The Japanese Buddhist scholar gave a rather different translation:

According to a recent translation by Sam van Schaik, the text should be:

According to Sam van Schaik, &quot;Mendre&quot; could be the Indo-Greek king Menander, or the mythical king Manadhatṛ of Buddhist sources; &quot;Polosi&quot; could be a Chinese abbreviation for king Prasenajit; &quot;Romakam&quot; may be the Byzantine Empire; the &quot;naked ones&quot; would be the Niganthas.

In Tibetan, the country named &quot;Tho-gar&quot; &quot;Thod-kar&quot; corresponds to Tokharistan (ancient Bactria).

==Influences==

The Kizil Caves are &quot;the earliest representative grottoes in China&quot;. The art of the Kizil Caves is thought to have influenced cave art at Dunhuang, in the Mogao Caves, as early as during the Northern Liang dynasty (421–439 CE), and pictorial arts in China thereafter.

According to historian Daniel C. Waugh:

==Decay, vandalism, dismantlement, and tourism==
Since their construction and decoration between the 4th and 8th centuries CE, the Kizil Caves have suffered numerous periods of religious vandalism and decay.

Western archaeologists orchestrated the massive sampling on the best remaining works of art in the early 20th century. Aside from their colonial outlook, one of their alleged motivations was to protect these works of arts from vandalism due to Islamic iconoclasm and the depredations of treasure hunters. Most of the dismantled panels were sent to the Museum für Indische Kunst, Berlin, Germany, but many were destroyed in World War II, with only photographs or drawings remaining in the best cases. A significant number of the murals were also captured by the Soviets in Berlin, and turned up recently in the Hermitage Museum.

In more recent times, the Red Guards also contributed to the destruction of the site, and last but not least, the transformation of the site for touristic purposes since 2005 has led to the disfigurement of many caves and the irretrievable loss of archaeological knowledge. Today, none of the caves can be said to have remained entirely intact, although many remain quite impressive.

==Major Kizil caves==
The caves were first named in German by Albert Grünwedel based on various individual characteristics. Many of these names have remained in English. More recently, a numbering system was adopted by the Chinese, generally based on the geographical position of the caves from West to East.
