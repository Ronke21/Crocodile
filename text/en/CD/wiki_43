<text>Pink Fairies are an English proto-punk rock band initially active in the London (Ladbroke Grove) underground and psychedelic scene of the early 1970s. They promoted free music, drug use, and anarchy, and often performed impromptu gigs and other stunts, such as playing for nothing outside the gates at the Bath and Isle of Wight pop festivals in 1970, as well as appearing at Phun City, the first Glastonbury and many other free festivals including Windsor and Trentishoe.

==History==
===Paul Rudolph incarnation, 1969–1972===
The group were formed after the three musicians from the Deviants (Paul Rudolph, guitar and vocals, Duncan Sanderson, bass and Russell Hunter, born Barry Russell Hunter, drums), dismissed their singer and leader Mick Farren during a disastrous tour of the West Coast of the United States. Prior to the tour, these musicians had collaborated on the &quot;Think Pink&quot; solo album by Twink, former drummer of the Pretty Things. Most of the musicians involved were members of a drinking club called the &quot;Pink Fairies Motorcycle Club and All-Star Rock and Roll Band&quot;, their name taken from a story written by Jamie Mandelkau. While the former Deviants&#x27; sidemen were still stranded in America after the tour, Twink, Farren and former Tyrannosaurus Rex percussionist Steve Peregrin Took had used the Pink Fairies name for various activities, including one shambolic gig in Manchester (with Farren on vocals, Took on guitar, Twink on drums, and Twink&#x27;s girlfriend Sally Meltzer, also known as &quot;Silver Darling&quot;, on keyboards) as well as the recording of Farren&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Mona – The Carnivorous Circus&quot;. Within a few months Twink had left, followed by Farren, by which point Took had renamed the embryonic band Shagrat. In February 1970, Twink recruited the remaining Deviants to a new Pink Fairies line-up. Took, meanwhile, continued with Shagrat as a vehicle for his own songs, and the two bands would appear as separate acts at the Phun City festival that summer.

Their music was upbeat good-time rock and roll, often jamming on the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, the Ventures&#x27; &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot;, &quot;Ghost Riders in the Sky&quot; and other standards. Their sets climaxed with the lengthy &quot;Uncle Harry&#x27;s Last Freakout&quot;, essentially an amalgam of old Deviants riffs that included extended guitar and double drum solos. They were closely associated with the UK underground, being based in the Ladbroke Grove scene and playing festivals, benefits, and free concerts. The band had strong connections with Farren&#x27;s hometown Worthing, playing gigs for the Worthing Workshop. These included an appearance on a float in the Worthing Rotary Club Carnival Procession and a free open-air concert in Beach House Park. Playing for free in June 1970 outside the Bath Festival, they encountered another Ladbroke Grove based band, Hawkwind, who shared similar interests in music and recreational activities. A friendship developed which would lead to the two bands becoming running partners and performing as Pinkwind. Sensationalist coverage in the (Mick Farren edited) &quot;International Times&quot; solidified their rebel reputation.

Polydor Records commissioned the group to record a single, &quot;The Snake&quot; backed with &quot;Do It&quot;, and were happy enough with the results to offer the group an album contract. The debut album &quot;Never Never Land&quot; was released in 1971. It featured live favourites &quot;Uncle Harry&#x27;s Last Freakout&quot; and &quot;Do It&quot;. An appearance at 1971&#x27;s Glastonbury Fair led to them being given one side of the &quot;Glastonbury Fayre&quot; various artists triple album. In July 1971, Twink left to travel to Morocco. The band continued as a three-piece, occasionally augmented by former The Move bassist Trevor Burton on guitar. They released their second album &quot;What a Bunch of Sweeties&quot; in 1972, which featured some contributions from Burton. On the album&#x27;s release and with a promotional tour pending Rudolph departed, going on to play on albums for Robert Calvert and Brian Eno. He would eventually replace Lemmy in Hawkwind.

===Larry Wallis incarnation, 1973–1978===
Mick Wayne (born Michael Wayne, 1945, Hull, Yorkshire and died 26 June 1994), was Rudolph&#x27;s replacement, having previously recorded on sessions for Took with Sanderson and Hunter at Olympic Studios, and later on loose sessions (along with sundry other underground musicians) in Took&#x27;s flat in the basement of manager Tony Secunda&#x27;s office, the fruits of which were released by Cleopatra Records in 1995. Feeling that Took&#x27;s exceptionally heavy drug consumption would not make him a going concern, the remaining three instead formed a new version of The Pink Fairies, releasing the single &quot;Well, Well, Well&quot; backed with &quot;Hold On&quot;, as well as doing a radio session for BBC Radio One.

However, Sanderson and Hunter became unhappy with the musical direction Wayne was taking the band. They convinced Larry Wallis, who had played with Shagrat and later UFO and Motörhead, to join the group as a second guitarist. Shortly after, they dismissed Wayne, passing songwriting and singing duties onto Wallis. This new three-piece then recorded the 1973 album &quot;Kings of Oblivion&quot;. Out of contract with Polydor, the band continued touring to a decreasing audience, until finally calling it a day. Wallis went on to join Lemmy in the first incarnation of Motörhead, then became the in-house record producer for Stiff Records. Sanderson joined The Lightning Raiders. Hunter left the music business.

Ted Carroll, head of Chiswick Records, organised a one-off re-union concert at The Roundhouse on 13 July 1975, featuring all five previous major members of the group (released in 1982 as &quot;Live at the Roundhouse 1975&quot;). Following this concert, Wallis, Sanderson and Hunter gave the Pink Fairies another try. This line-up eventually gave numerous &#x27;farewell tours&#x27; before disbanding. After a period of inactivity they entered the burgeoning punk rock scene as one of the few &#x27;hairy&#x27; bands revered by the new guard. Recruiting former Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers guitarist Martin Stone, they toured and released the single &quot;Between the Lines&quot; (backed with &quot;Spoiling for a Fight&quot;) on Stiff Records but, with little interest being shown in them, they once again split up. Rudolph and Wallis resumed playing for Farren in 1977/78, releasing the EP &quot;Screwed Up&quot; as The Deviants again on Stiff, but Rudolph returned to his native Canada prior to the recording of 1978&#x27;s &quot;Vampires Stole My Lunch Money&quot; and follow up single &quot;Broken Statue&quot;.

===1980s and 1990s===
In the early 1980s, Wallis, Sanderson and drummer George Butler (ex-Lightning Raiders) recorded and played live, the albums &quot;Previously Unreleased&quot; (1982) and The Deviants&#x27; &quot;Human Garbage&quot; (live 1984) being released. The band went under many names including The Police Cars, The Police Sleighs, The Donut Dunkers Of Death, and finally The Love Pirates Of Doom, the most settled line-up being Wallis, Sanderson, Butler and second guitarist Andy Colquhoun (ex-Warsaw Pakt &amp; Brian James&#x27; Tanz Der Youth).

In 1987, Jake Riviera, head of Demon Records, offered a recording contract for a reformed Pink Fairies. Of the five group members, Paul Rudolph was not involved, so the second guitarist position was taken up by Colquhoun. This band released the album &quot;Kill &#x27;Em and Eat &#x27;Em&quot; and toured following a sell-out show at London&#x27;s Town &amp; Country Club before once again splitting up in 1988. After Twink&#x27;s departure, they carried on until Wallis also left, at which point the remaining members toured and recorded as Flying Colours. An archive live album &quot;Chinese Cowboys: Live 1987&quot; was issued in Japan in 2005 on Captain Trip Records.

Following this period the magazine UHCK (Uncle Harry&#x27;s City Kids - run initially by Jeff Holmes and later by Tim Rundall) collaborated with the band to produce two tape releases (&quot;Silence Of The Hams&quot; and &quot;Son Of Ham&quot;) and two CDs (&quot;Son Of Ham&quot; extended version and &quot;Hogwatch&quot;) for subscribers, all featuring entirely unreleased music by members of the band in various side projects (the Deviants, Lightning Raiders, etc.), radio sessions and specially written material. In common with many &#x27;official&#x27; Pink Fairies releases the artwork was by the late underground cartoonist Edward J. Barker (I.T., Nasty Tales) noted for his Largactalites cartoons and his pig and crow caricatures. Much of the magazine was actually written by ex-band members and by longtime associate, road manager, &#x27;wet nurse&#x27; and manager of Dingwalls, Boss Goodman, who went on to become a renowned chef, once cooking for US President Bill Clinton at the Portobello Gold.

In the mid-1990s Twink collaborated with Rudolph and the pair recorded 1996&#x27;s &quot;Pleasure Island&quot; and 1997&#x27;s &quot;No Picture&quot;, released as the Pink Fairies on Twink&#x27;s own label. Twink also issued a plethora of albums featuring outtakes, alternative versions, BBC sessions and live material including: &quot;The Golden Years 1969-1971&quot;, &quot;Do It&quot;, &quot;Live at Weeley Festival 1971&quot; and &quot;Mandies and Mescaline Round at Uncle Harry&#x27;s&quot; (1998).

===21st century===
During the early 2000s, Polydor remastered and released their Pink Fairies catalogue with bonus cuts, and issued the sampler albums &quot;Master Series&quot; and &quot;Up the Pinks: An Introduction&quot;.

The &quot;Kings of Oblivion&quot; line-up (Wallis, Sanderson and Hunter) were scheduled to play at a one-off gig on 22 January 2007 at the Roundhouse, London and record a BBC session for Stuart Maconie&#x27;s &quot;Freakzone&quot; radio programme, but activities were cancelled at the last minute due to ill-health. In 2007, the biography &quot;Keep it Together! Cosmic Boogie with the Deviants and Pink Fairies&quot; by Rich Deakin, Mick Farren&#x27;s webmaster, was published by Headpress. In September 2009, the &quot;What a Bunch of Sweeties&quot; line-up (Rudolph, Sanderson and Hunter) re-united in the studio to record a new version of &quot;Do It&quot; for the various artists CD &quot;Portobello Shuffle: A Testimonial To Boss Goodman And Tribute To The Deviants &amp; Pink Fairies&quot;. The CD was a fund-raiser for Goodman, who was suffering from the after-effects of a stroke.

In 2011, Farren and Colquhoun returned to the UK from Los Angeles after nearly 20 years in exile. They teamed up with the rhythm section of Hunter and Sanderson, along with second guitarist Tim Rundall and percussionist Jaki Windmill, for a number of appearances. This line-up performed on the &#x27;Spirit of 71&#x27; stage at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival - 40 years after the Pink Fairies&#x27; previous appearance at that event - under the name &#x27;Mick Farren &amp; The Last Men Standing&#x27;. Without Rundall, they later performed as The Deviants until Farren&#x27;s death in 2013.

In 2014, the Pink Fairies reformed with a line-up of Hunter, Sanderson, Colquhoun, Windmill and second drummer Butler. Initially announcing two dates - The Robin 2 in Bilston on 15 May and 100 Club in London on 17 May - more dates were later added up to October 2015. A new album called &quot;Naked Radio&quot; was released after a Pledgemusic campaign ended on 12 February 2017.

Rudolph completed recordings with Motörhead&#x27;s first drummer Lucas Fox and Hawkwind bass player Alan Davey in Austin, Texas, to be released as a Pink Fairies album on Cleopatra Records in 2018. One track appeared on the 2017 compilation &quot;Halloween Garage Blues&quot;. The LP &quot;Resident Reptiles&quot; was released on August 24, 2018. A second album by this line-up was released in July 2023.

Butler died in January 2018. Goodman died on 22 March 2018. Wallis died on 19 September 2019, and Sanderson died just two months later on 20 November 2019. Rundall died in January 2022, and Hunter died on 19 December 2023, at the age of 77.

<doc id="886594" wikidata="Q335182" url="?curid=886594" title="Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich">
<text>Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich, (27 July 1625 – 28 May 1672), was an English military officer, politician and diplomat from Barnwell, Northamptonshire. During the First English Civil War, he served with the Parliamentarian army, and was a Member of Parliament at various times between 1645 and 1660. Under The Protectorate, he was also a member of the English Council of State and General at sea. 

In the political infighting that followed the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658, he played an important role in bringing about the Stuart Restoration in May 1660. Created Earl of Sandwich by Charles II, he served as Ambassador to Portugal from 1661 to 1662. Appointed Ambassador to Spain in 1666, he helped negotiate the 1667 Treaty of Madrid. 

When the Second Anglo-Dutch War began in 1665, he commanded a naval squadron but was later suspended in a dispute over prize money. Restored to command when the Third Anglo-Dutch War began in May 1672, he was killed at the Battle of Solebay in June. Montagu is one of the best-known characters of the 1660s, being a central figure in the diaries of his distant cousin, the naval official Samuel Pepys.

==Personal details==
Montagu was born on 25 July 1625, only surviving son of Sir Sidney Montagu ( 1572-1644) and his first wife Paulina Pepys (died 1638), great-aunt of Samuel Pepys. On 7 November 1642, Montagu married Jemima Crew, daughter of John Crew, 1st Baron Crew and Jemima Waldegrave, whom Pepys in his Diary refers to with great affection as &quot;My Lady&quot;. The couple had ten children:
Paulina&#x27;s death in February 1669, aged only twenty, was a great source of grief to her father. Pepys, who called her &quot;a peevish lady&quot;, called to pay his condolences, but found him &quot;shut away for sorrow&quot;.

==First English Civil War and Interregnum==
Although his father was a Royalist, when the First English Civil War began in August 1642, Montagu served in the Eastern Association army led by his Parliamentarian cousin, the Earl of Manchester. He raised a regiment of infantry which during the 1644 campaign fought at Marston Moor, the Siege of York and Second Newbury. Despite his family relationship, Montagu supported those in Parliament who expressed dissatisfaction with the conduct of the war by Manchester and Essex. 

This resulted in the creation of the New Model Army in February 1645 and the passing of the Self-denying Ordinance, requiring those holding military commissions to resign from Parliament. As members of the House of Lords, Manchester and Essex were automatically removed, since unlike MPs they could not resign their titles. Montagu&#x27;s regiment was incorporated into the New Model, taking part in the June 1645 Battle of Naseby, followed by the capture of Bristol. In October, he resigned from the army as required by the Ordinance when was appointed MP for Huntingdonshire, a seat formerly held by his father who died in September 1644.

Montagu played no part in the Second English Civil War and retired from Parliament after Pride&#x27;s Purge in December 1648 to live quietly at home. He returned to politics in 1653 when his neighbour Oliver Cromwell nominated him to the Barebones Parliament as MP for Huntingdonshire, a seat formerly held by his father who died in September 1644. He was also appointed to the English Council of State, an office he held until it was dissolved in 1659, and was re-elected to the First Protectorate Parliament in 1654, then the Second Protectorate Parliament in 1656. 

During the Anglo-Spanish War (1654–1660), he was appointed joint General at Sea with Robert Blake, taking part in an expedition into the Mediterranean. This experience made him a leading advocate of establishing a British naval base in the region, an ambition realised with the acquisition of English Tangier in 1661. In February 1657, he was one of the so-called &quot;New Cromwellians&quot; who supported the Humble Petition and Advice, inviting Cromwell to declare himself king and advocating the re-establishment of a national church. The measure was opposed by army radicals including Charles Fleetwood and John Lambert and ultimately rejected. 

In June 1658 he commanded the naval squadron that blockaded Dunkirk and when Cromwell died in September, Montagu remained loyal to his son and appointed successor Richard Cromwell. During his brief and disastrous rule as Lord Protector, Montagu remained at sea and in early 1659 was sent to mediate between Sweden and Denmark; however, he was suspected of secret communication with the exiled Charles II and the republicans Algernon Sidney and Sir Robert Honywood were sent to monitor his activity. He was recalled and investigated by the newly installed Rump Parliament; although no evidence was found, he was dismissed from command.

==Restoration==
By the end of 1659, England appeared to be drifting into anarchy, with widespread demands for new elections and an end to military rule. In February 1660, George Monck, military commander in Scotland, marched into London and declared his support for the Rump against the Republican faction led by John Lambert. Montagu resumed command of the navy and was returned as MP for the important port of Dover when elections were held for a Convention Parliament in April. 

This placed him in a powerful position during negotiations for the Restoration; when Parliament resolved to proclaim Charles king and invited him to return to England, Montagu commanded the fleet that brought him from the Dutch Republic on 24 May. Two months later, on 12 July 1660, he was created Baron Montagu of St Neots, Viscount Hinchingbrooke, and Earl of Sandwich. King Charles also made him a Knight of the Garter and appointed him Master of the Great Wardrobe, Admiral of the narrow seas (the English Channel and southern North Sea), and Lieutenant Admiral to The Duke of York, Lord High Admiral of England. He carried St. Edward&#x27;s staff at Charles&#x27; subsequent coronation. Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, who liked and admired Sandwich, wrote that the conferring of these honours caused much resentment among those Royalists who had gone into exile with their King, and regarded Sandwich as a &quot;diehard&quot; Cromwellian; yet adds that his charm of manner made it almost impossible to dislike him.

He was appointed Ambassador to Portugal in 1661, and strongly favoured the Portuguese marriage, through which England obtained Mumbai and Tangier. Sandwich, like others, saw a great future for Tangier as an international trade centre, and he commanded the fleet which took possession of the city in January 1662, purchasing a house there. Returning to England, in his capacity as Ambassador, he escorted the new Queen, Catherine of Braganza, from Lisbon.

Montagu was a signatory to &quot;The Several Declarations of The Company of Royal Adventurers of England Trading into Africa&quot;, a document published in 1667 which led to the expansion of the Royal Africa Company.

==The Prize Goods Scandal==
In the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665 to 1667 he fought at the Battle of Lowestoft, an English victory, but defeat at the Battle of Vågen led to him being removed from active service. His reputation suffered another serious blow when he failed to prevent his sailors from plundering a number of Dutch VOC prize ships, loaded with precious spices from the East Indies, which he had brought in. By long-standing custom the sailors could take any goods they found between the decks, but they were strictly forbidden to &quot;break the bulk&quot; i.e. ransack the ship&#x27;s hold; yet this is just what Sandwich, an easy-going man with a notoriously poor understanding of money matters, permitted. When this became widely known, the rumour spread that Sandwich had unlawfully helped himself to a fortune (in fact he seems to have taken less than he was entitled to), and the public, who were still enduring the horrors of the Great Plague of London, reacted with such unexpected fury that a minor mishap became a national affair: &quot;the Prize Goods Scandal&quot;. Although Clarendon wrote that Sandwich was too likeable to have any personal enemies, he did have political opponents, including his own superior at the Admiralty, James, Duke of York, and James&#x27; influential secretary Sir William Coventry, who were happy to exploit the scandal. He felt obliged to obtain a royal pardon: the King, mindful of his good services at the Restoration, willingly granted it.

==Ambassador to Spain==
During his absence from battle, Sandwich served as England&#x27;s ambassador to Spain, replacing Sir Richard Fanshawe. This is further evidence that despite his unpopularity, he retained the King&#x27;s confidence, although his political fortunes, like those of his friend and patron Clarendon, were in decline. Sandwich himself had told Pepys the previous year not to put too much reliance on the friendship of any &quot;great man&quot;. After the Great Fire of London Sandwich downplayed the damage to the Spanish King, claiming that London&#x27;s slums were the only thing in ashes. This slant on the events was also practised by England&#x27;s ambassadors throughout Europe.

As Ambassador his most notable achievement was the Anglo-Spanish Commercial Treaty of 1667, which laid the foundations for a prosperous trading relationship between the two countries which lasted for over a century. He also acted as mediator in the peace negotiations between Spain and Portugal which resulted in the Treaty of Lisbon. Like all Ambassadors of the era, he found the cost of running an embassy ruinous (he had never had a good head for business) and on his return to England in the autumn of 1668 one of his first actions was to borrow money from his cousin Samuel Pepys. On his way back from Spain, he again visited Tangier to report on the condition of the garrison there.

In 1670 he escorted the King&#x27;s sister Henrietta of England, Duchess of Orleans, from France to England to negotiate the Secret Treaty of Dover between her brother and Louis XIV. Of the existence of the Treaty&#x27;s secret clauses, notably that by which Charles II pledged to convert to the Roman Catholic faith, Sandwich, like the general public, was quite unaware. In the same year he was appointed President of the Privy Council Committee on Foreign Plantations; he had always had a keen interest in international trade, despite his notorious inability to keep his own finances in order.

==Last campaign and death==

He was subsequently reappointed to a naval command, and by 1672 at the start of the Third Anglo-Dutch War, he was Vice-Admiral of the Blue with the &quot;Royal James&quot; as his flagship. At the Battle of Solebay on 28 May, his ship was attacked by a group of fire ships and was destroyed with the loss of many lives, including Sandwich himself. His body was washed ashore a week later, recognisable only from his clothing; it was unmarked and he appeared to have drowned. Sandwich opposed the war and is said to have predicted his own death. Certainly, he told his friend John Evelyn, just before he sailed, that &quot;he would see him no more&quot;.

On Wednesday 3 July 1672 he was buried in Westminster Abbey after a state funeral that started with a procession along the River Thames of five decorated barges from Deptford. The body was landed at Westminster at about 5 pm and carried to the Abbey in a grand procession.

==Sandwich and Samuel Pepys==
Sandwich on his mother&#x27;s side was the first cousin of John Pepys, the father of Samuel Pepys. Pepys started his career as a minor member of the Sandwich household and owed his appointments first to the Wardrobe and then as Clerk of the Acts to the Navy Board to Sandwich&#x27;s influence. Pepys&#x27; diary provides a detailed primary source of Sandwich&#x27;s career in the 1660s.

They had a serious quarrel in 1663, when Pepys reprimanded Sandwich for living openly with his mistress, Elizabeth Becke, at her &quot;mean house&quot; in Chelsea. Pepys was concerned at the damage to their family&#x27;s reputation, Sandwich&#x27;s neglect of his official duties (thus risking the loss of any remaining influence he had at Court) and also at the insult to Sandwich&#x27;s wife, to whom Pepys was deeply attached. Following a brief estrangement, friendly relations were resumed, although the two men were probably never as close again as they had been (Pepys, for example, is not mentioned in Sandwich&#x27;s last will). For Pepys to raise the issue at all took considerable courage, considering how much he owed to his patron, and his Diary shows that he was strongly tempted to let the matter lie. Even when he did raise it he chose to write rather than confront Sandwich face to face.

In 1668 Pepys was somewhat perturbed when his wife Elizabeth, during one of the violent quarrels which followed the discovery of his affair with her companion Deb Willet, told him that Sandwich had asked her to be his mistress. Since Pepys was in no doubt that she had refused, he decided to treat the matter as being closed, and friendly relations continued: Sandwich dined at their house for the first time a few months later. Pepys, on reflection, may have thought it possible that Elizabeth in her anger had invented the story to upset him, (as she undoubtedly invented the story that she was attending Roman Catholic services). Whatever their differences, Pepys in later life always remembered Sandwich, whom he called &quot;that noble and unparalleled Lord&quot;, and his wife (who died in 1674) with affection and gratitude.

<doc id="886597" wikidata="Q703081" url="?curid=886597" title="Peace of Passau">
<text>The Peace of Passau was an attempt to resolve religious tensions in the Holy Roman Empire. After Emperor Charles V won a victory against Protestant forces in the Schmalkaldic War of 1547, he implemented the Augsburg Interim, which largely reaffirmed Roman Catholic beliefs. This angered many Protestant princes, and led by Maurice of Saxony, in January 1552 several formed an alliance with Henry II of France in the Treaty of Chambord. In return for French funding and assistance, Henry was promised lands in western Germany. In the ensuing Princes&#x27; Revolt, also known as the Second Schmalkaldic War, Charles was driven out of Germany to his ancestral lands in Austria by the Protestant alliance, while Henry captured the three Rhine Bishoprics of Metz, Verdun and Toul.

In August 1552, weary from three decades of religious civil war, Charles guaranteed Lutheran religious freedoms in the Peace of Passau. The implementation of the Augsburg Interim was cancelled. The Protestant princes taken prisoner during the Schmalkaldic War, John Frederick of Saxony and Philip of Hesse, were released. A precursor to the Peace of Augsburg of September 1555, the Peace of Passau effectively surrendered Charles V&#x27;s lifelong quest for European religious unity.

In August 1552 his younger brother Archduke Ferdinand I of Austria concluded the Peace of Passau, whereby he formally accepted the Lutheran Augsburg Confession, confirmed by the emperor himself in the 1555 Peace of Augsburg.

<text>Avram Finkelstein is an American artist, writer, gay rights activist and member of the AIDS art collective Gran Fury.

Finkelstein describes himself as a &quot;red diaper baby&quot;, raised by leftist parents who encouraged him to develop an interest in radical politics. He began by protesting against the Vietnam War in the 1960s, and has worked on many activist causes, including The Student Mobilization Committee, The Poor People&#x27;s Campaign and The Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Rights. He was a founding member of the AIDS advocacy group ACT UP. In 1986, Finkelstein was a co-founder of the group Silence=Death Project, which created the &quot;Silence=Death&quot; anti-AIDS logo to combat institutional silence surrounding homophobia and HIV/AIDS, later donated to ACT UP. In 1994, in preparation for the Gay Games in New York City, he wrote a tract for ACT UP, entitled &quot;Welcome to New York&quot;, which asked gay men and lesbians who attended the games and other festivities surrounding the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Stonewall Riots to take action to stop the AIDS epidemic.

In 2018, Finkelstein created &quot;YOU CARE ABOUT HIV CRIMINALIZATION (YOU JUST DON’T KNOW IT YET)&quot;, a broadside and site-specific project for Visual AIDS and the 2018 New York City Pride March.

Finkelstein has covered art and culture for &quot;Artwrit&quot;, &quot;Italian Vogue&quot;, &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, &quot;Visionaire&quot;, &quot;Pride&quot;, &quot;Genre&quot;, &quot;Van&quot; and &quot;Dune&quot;. With Gran Fury, he collaborated on public awareness campaigns and public art projects for publications, museums and foundations including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Venice Biennale, ArtForum, the New Museum of Contemporary Art, Creative Time and the Public Art Fund. Finkelstein has been interviewed about art, activism and communication in the public sphere by publications including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Interview&quot;, and &quot;The Forward&quot; and has spoken at Harvard, Exit Art, Fordham, Rhode Island School of Design, Massachusetts College of Art and Design, the School of Visual Arts and City University of New York.

Finkelstein&#x27;s archive can be found at the Fales Library and Special Collections at New York University.

<doc id="886600" wikidata="Q4356863" url="?curid=886600" title="Alex Fraser Bridge">
<text>The Alex Fraser Bridge (also known as the Annacis Bridge) is a cable-stayed bridge over the Fraser River that connects Richmond and New Westminster with North Delta in Greater Vancouver, British Columbia. The bridge is named for Alex Fraser, a former British Columbia Minister of Transportation. The bridge was the longest cable-stayed bridge in the world when it opened on September 22, 1986, and was the longest in North America until the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge, in the U.S. state of South Carolina, opened in 2005.

==Overview==
The Alex Fraser Bridge is long with a main span of . The towers are tall. It consists of seven lanes, three in each direction with the middle lane acting as a reversible lane, and had a maximum speed limit of until July 24, 2019, when the speed limit was lowered to to accommodate the additional reversible lane. Upon opening in 1986, only four of the six available lanes were open. Cyclists and pedestrians share two narrow sidewalks one on each side. All six lanes opened in 1987 after traffic demand justified the need.

The bridge&#x27;s southern end is in North Delta and its northern end is on Delta&#x27;s Annacis Island. Connections on its southern end lead to White Rock and the Canada–United States border at the Peace Arch border crossing. The connections on the northern end lead into the cities of New Westminster, Richmond, and Burnaby, and on into Vancouver itself. It is a major artery in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia.

The bridge was constructed for the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and was designed by a joint venture of Klohn Crippen Berger and Buckland &amp; Taylor (now COWI North America). Its total cost was $58 million.

==Recent history==
In December 2016, &quot;ice bombs&quot; (also called &quot;slush bombs&quot;) dropped from the Alex Fraser Bridge and the nearby Port Mann Bridge onto vehicles, causing damage to windshields. The Alex Fraser has its cables along the sides of the driving lanes, whereas on the Port Mann, they cross over top of the driving lanes. In addition to 2016, this also happened on the Alex Fraser in 2005, 2008, and 2012. The Alex Fraser needed to be closed a few times during December 2016 due to the possibility of ice bombs; this caused major traffic problems in the region. To combat this issue, the BC government announced that a heavy lift helicopter will be used to blow snow and ice off the cables to prevent it from accumulating and falling onto the cars below.

An announcement was made on January 19, 2017, that a new seventh travel lane would be added on the bridge by slightly narrowing the existing lanes and removing the shoulders. A reversible lane system with a movable barrier was added to help ease traffic during morning and afternoon rush hours. The new seventh lane opened to traffic on September 14, 2019, with the moveable reversible zipper in operation beginning December 16, 2019.

<text>The Battle of Tampa, also known as the &quot;Yankee Outrage at Tampa&quot;, was a minor engagement of the American Civil War fought June 30 – July 1, 1862, between the United States Navy and a Confederate artillery company charged with &quot;protecting&quot; the village of Tampa, Florida. Although small, Tampa&#x27;s port was a key hub of trade for Central Florida, and several blockade runners from Tampa regularly slipped past the Union naval blockade that extended down the Atlantic coast around to Florida&#x27;s west coast.

On June 30, 1862, the Union gunboat USS &quot;Sagamore&quot; steamed into Tampa Bay to demand the surrender of the small Confederate (CSA) garrison at Fort Brooke. This demand was rebuffed by Captain John William Pearson, to which Captain A.J. Drake of the &quot;Sagamore&quot; responded with a warning that his ship would open fire at 6:00 p.m. that same day. The gunboat began a long-range bombardment of the fort and town that evening as scheduled, to which the fort responded by returning fire with its three larger canons. Neither side inflicted real damage or suffered any casualties, and after firing several more rounds the next morning from beyond the range of the fort&#x27;s guns, the &quot;Sagamore&quot; returned to its blockade station near the mouth of Tampa Bay.

Later, more aggressive Union attacks resulted in the destruction of several moored blockade runners during the Battle of Fort Brooke in October 1862 and a brief occupation of Fort Brooke by Union forces in May 1864.

==Background==
On April 13, 1862, at 11 a.m., the alarm went up when a Union schooner anchored behind an island two miles from Tampa. Confederate pickets were posted on all the roads into town to sound the alarm because it was feared the ship was a decoy. According to the diary of Robert Watson, a member of the “Key West Avengers” (Captain H. Mulrennan&#x27;s company of Florida volunteers), “[W]e are of opinion that the Yankees have landed men below us and came in the schooner to draw our attention while they march up in our rear.” After an hour the schooner launched a boat under a flag of truce. It was met by two Confederate boats. The Federals demanded the surrender of Tampa. According to Watson, “Major Thomas told them that he would not surrender it. The Yankee officer then gave him twenty-four hours to take the women and children out of the town as they would attack the place at the end of that time. Our men gave three cheers at the prospect of having a fight which made the men in the Yankee boat look down in the mouth as they expected to see us all look frightened and ready to surrender. Capt. Smith told us to take all of our clothing and carry them up the river as the enemy might come too strong for us and should we have to retreat it would be impossible to carry anything with us. A strong picket guard on all day and night.” On April 14 Watson wrote, “No sign of the enemy but there is a bright lookout for them.”

By the summer of 1862, plans were in place in Washington to further tighten this blockade by capturing major ports throughout the Confederacy, &quot;à la&quot; New Orleans, which was captured in April 1862, as well as other towns along the Mississippi River (most notably Vicksburg). It was common knowledge among the Union&#x27;s chief military strategists that the sooner the blockade could effectively seal off the Confederacy from any level of commerce, the sooner the import-dependent Confederates would be forced to surrender, lacking the materiel necessary to sustain a war of attrition, as the Union infantry would ultimately have to attempt to put on the Confederacy at various points in the war.
==Battle action==
On June 30, USS &quot;Sagamore&quot;, a Union gunboat, came into Tampa Bay, opened her ports, and turned her broadside on the town. The gunboat then launched a boat with 20 men flying a flag of truce. In his post-action report, Captain John William Pearson, CSA, reported to Gen. Joseph Finegan, CSA, what transpired. “I immediately manned one of my boats with 18 men met them in the bay, determined that they should not land on my shore, and on meeting the boat the lieutenant in command reported he had been sent by Captain Drake to demand an unconditional surrender of the town. My reply to him was that we did not understand the meaning of the word surrender; there was no such letter in our book; we don’t surrender. He then said they would commence shelling the town at 6 o’clock, and I told him to pitch in. We then gave three hearty cheers for the Southern Confederacy and the Federal boat crew said nothing…. At 6 o’clock they promptly opened fire on us with heavy shell and shot, and after two from them we opened from our batteries, consisting of three 24-pounder cannon. Both parties then kept up a regular fire until 7 p.m.” At that point, U.S.S. &quot;Sagamore&quot; withdrew. On July 1, between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m., the gunboat fired from beyond the range of the Confederate cannon. After a two-hour break for lunch, USS &quot;Sagamore&quot; fired two more rounds, weighed anchor, and sailed away. There were no Confederate casualties.

Capt. Pearson’s after-action report singled out Capt. James Gettis of Hillsborough County and originally from Pennsylvania for his decisive leadership of one of the Confederate batteries.

==Aftermath==

The Battle of Fort Brooke was a more significant action fought in Tampa the following October. In this engagement, a Union gunboat again bombarded Fort Brooke while secretly landing a small raiding force. The raiding party was able to find and destroy several Confederate blockade runners hidden up the Hillsborough River before departing.

Union forces returned to Tampa once more in May 1864. By this time, the Confederate war effort was faltering, and Fort Brooke&#x27;s defenders had been transferred to more pressing stations. Troops from the USS &quot;Adela&quot; landed in Tampa without opposition, destroyed or took remaining supplies in unoccupied Fort Brooke, and left town after two days. Two cannons from Fort Brooke that were dumped in the Hillsborough River during this raid were found and restored and are now on display in Plant Park on the University of Tampa campus.

<text>Savusavu () is a town in the Fijian Province of Cakaudrove. The town is located on the south coast of Vanua Levu Island and had a population of 3,372 in the 2007 census.

Savusavu is known as &quot;the hidden paradise of Fiji.&quot;

== Geography ==
Savusavu is located on Fiji&#x27;s northern island of Vanua Levu. It can be reached by plane from Nadi (one hour) or by ferry from Suva or Lautoka (approx 12-hour trip).

It is famous for its hot springs, located mostly opposite the Hot Springs Hotel – although at low tide the steam from numerous smaller outlets all along the foreshore can be seen. In the late 19th century, these hot springs turned into 12 – 18 m tall geysers for a period of two months.

The old Copra Shed Marina, built in the 19th century, is a major landmark in Savusavu. Renovated in recent years by geologist and Savusavu resident Geoff Taylor, it now houses the Savusavu Yacht Club. Fiji Air offices, Pacific Sun reservations (formerly Sunflower Air) offices, a chandlery shop, a geologist&#x27;s office, a gift shop, a travel agency and two rental apartments. There are also moorings for yachts, along with shower and toilet facilities.

Another significant landmark is the Savarekareka Mission, 10 kilometres north of Savusavu. The chapel, the first Roman Catholic mission on Vanua Levu, was built around 1870 and is still functioning.

== Climate ==

== Economic activities ==

Savusavu was originally established as a trading centre for sandalwood, beche-de-mer, and copra, and is the site of a major copra mill. Tourism is growing in importance, owing to its SCUBA diving and yachting facilities.

Savusavu hosts a number of resorts, some of which have interesting specialities. Namale Resort hosts regular seminars in the Tony Robbins Life Mastery programme; the Jean Michel Cousteau Resort is one of the few 5 star resorts to offer a children&#x27;s camp; Daku Resort runs a programme of learning holidays in art, yoga, singing snorkelling and birdwatching throughout the year. The birdwatching tour visits the rare silktail which is only found in the island of Vanua Levu, in a habitat about an hour and a half from Savusavu. The silktail is one of the species listed by Birdlife International as being under threat.

Geothermal energy is a resource waiting to be tapped. A geological survey has found that Savusavu&#x27;s hot springs could generate enough electricity to power the entire island of Vanua Levu. Known locally as Nakama hot springs water from the geothermally heated pools which can reaches close to 100 degrees Celsius, have been used by local villagers for centuries to cook taro, breadfruit and other local foods.

On 2 August 2022, the geothermal pools become an official tourist attraction. A F$75,000 project orchestrated by the Blue Town Committee and promoted by the Savusavu Tourism Association refurbished Nakama hot spring with landscaping, stone walls, signage, steps and drains around the springs. Locals are still permitted to cook their food on the premises and even sell prepared dishes.

Most land in Fiji is owned by native land owners – the mataqali (extended family unit). Savusavu and surrounding areas has a large amount of freehold land, much of it once used for coconut plantations. Increasingly this land has been subdivided and sold, often to expats seeking a retirement or holiday home. As a result, Savusavu is now home to a small but significant community of Americans, Australians, New Zealanders and Europeans which has helped fuel its economic development.

== Politics ==

Incorporated as a town in 1969, Savusavu is governed by a 9-member town council, elected for a three-year term. The councillors elect a mayor from among themselves for a one-year term, which may be renewed any number of times. Following the victory of the Savusavu Ratepayers and Citizens Party in the municipal elections held on 22 October 2005, Ram Pillay was chosen as mayor, succeeding Peni Naulu of the Lighthouse Party.

In 2009, the Military-backed interim government dismissed all municipal governments throughout Fiji and appointed special administrators to run the urban areas. As of 2015, elected municipal government has not been restored. The special administrator of Savusavu, along with nearby Labasa, is Vijay Chand.

<text>Joseph Rucker Lamar (October 14, 1857 – January 2, 1916) was an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court appointed by President William Howard Taft. A cousin of former associate justice Lucius Lamar, he served from 1911 until his death in 1916.

==Biography==
Born in Ruckersville, Elbert County, Georgia, Lamar was the son of a minister and attended the Academy of Richmond County in Augusta, Georgia and the Martin Institute in Jefferson, Georgia. During his time in Augusta, he lived next door to and was the &quot;closest friend&quot; of future president Woodrow Wilson, whose father was the local Presbyterian minister. They both also attended Joseph T. Derry&#x27;s school for boys in a local warehouse, a school whose other students would also become a future Congressman, major newspaper owner/ambassador and the dean of Columbia Law School. After Lamar graduated from the Penn Lucy School near Baltimore, Maryland, he attended the University of Georgia where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society. After his family moved he completed his degree at Bethany College in 1877, where he was a member of Beta Theta Pi. After attending law school at Washington and Lee University School of Law, he left and completed his legal education by reading law with a prominent Augusta attorney, then returned to Bethany College to teach Latin for a year, afterward practicing law in Augusta.

From 1886 to 1889, he served in the Georgia House of Representatives, and then was appointed by the Supreme Court of Georgia in 1893 as a member of the Commission to Recodify the Laws of Georgia, which prepared a code of laws for the state. Two years later, that code was adopted by the state General Assembly.

On January 1, 1901, Lamar was appointed to fill an unexpired term of Justice William A. Little in the Supreme Court of Georgia, then was re-elected in 1903. He wrote more than 200 opinions before resigning in 1905 to again practice law, defending railroads and many other large corporations.

On December 12, 1910, Lamar was nominated by President William Howard Taft as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, to a seat vacated by William H. Moody. Lamar was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 15, 1910, and was sworn into office on January 3, 1911.

At a reception after Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s inauguration in 1913, the two friends were able to meet again and swapped stories of their Georgia youth. They remained in contact while they were in Washington. In 1915, Lamar wrote two short individual opinions in the famed Leo Frank case. He declined to grant a petition for &quot;habeas corpus&quot; brought by Frank to challenge the fairness of his trial, but subsequently granted a writ of error allowing Frank to bring his claims before the court. The full Court went on to reject Frank&#x27;s claim in &quot;Frank v. Mangum&quot;; Lamar voted with the majority but did not write a separate opinion.

Lamar, together with Frederick W. Lehmann, was selected in 1914 to represent the United States at the ABC Powers Conference convened to avert a war over the Veracruz Incident. In the fall of 1915, Lamar suffered a paralytic stroke. Legislation was proposed to allow Lamar to retire with full pay, but his death just months later made the issue a moot point.

He died in Washington, D.C., on January 2, 1916.

==Legacy and honors==
Lamar&#x27;s professional papers, including correspondence concerning his years as a Justice, are archived at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia, and available for research. The Joseph Rucker Lamar Boyhood Home in Augusta, Georgia is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Brunswick, Georgia, and named in his honor.

<text>Mary Martha Byrne (born December 23, 1969) is an American actress. She played the role of Lily Walsh Snyder on the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from 1985 to 1989, then again from 1993 to 2008; as well as, from 2000 to 2003, Lily&#x27;s twin sister, Rose D&#x27;Angelo. Byrne has also appeared in other stage, television and movie roles, including the title role in the 1983 film &quot;Anna to the Infinite Power&quot;. She is currently executive producer of the digital drama series &quot;Anacostia&quot;, where she has played the role of Alexis Jordan since 2011. Byrne has won three Daytime Emmy Awards for acting.

==Early life==
Byrne was born in Ridgewood, New Jersey, the daughter of Terrence Joseph and Mary Adele (née TuMulty) Byrne.

==Career==

===Featured roles===
Byrne began acting at a young age when she joined the cast of the Broadway musical &quot;Annie&quot;, where she played the role of July.

She was a featured actor on a number of prime time episodic television programs, including &quot;Kate and Allie&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot;; &quot;Jake and the Fatman&quot;; &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;; and &quot;Hearts are Wild&quot;. Byrne also appeared in several television movies, with featured roles in &quot;When the Cradle Falls&quot; and &quot;Pink Lightning&quot;.

Byrne&#x27;s best known film role was as the title character in the 1983 film &quot;Anna to the Infinite Power&quot;. In 2010 she provided the commentary for the film&#x27;s DVD release.

===Daytime television===
Byrne is best known for portraying Lily Walsh Snyder on the CBS Daytime soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. She started in May 1985 at age 15, taking over from another teenage actress. Byrne soon became part of a &quot;supercouple&quot; when then-head writer Douglas Marland paired &quot;poor little rich girl&quot; Lily with hard-luck farmhand Holden Snyder, played by Jon Hensley. The show attracted controversy in 1987 when Byrne—months shy of her 18th birthday—and equally underage actor Brian Bloom played out a storyline in which they lost their virginity to each other.

Byrne won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in 1987. She left &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in 1989, and returned in April 1993. From 2000 until 2003, Byrne also played a second role, Lily&#x27;s long-lost twin, Rose D&#x27;Angelo. She won another Daytime Emmy in 2001, this time as Outstanding Lead Actress.

Byrne left &quot;As the World Turns&quot; again in April 2008. The show&#x27;s executive producer Christopher Goutman stated, &quot;We made Martha an incredibly generous offer in hopes that she would remain a valuable member of the &quot;ATWT&quot; cast. Unfortunately, Martha has decided to leave despite our best efforts to keep her.&quot; Byrne later asserted that the contract negotiations fell through because the show refused to guarantee her the same number of episodes of work she had previously been guaranteed. She added that a casting call was made for her successor during her contract negotiations, which fueled her drive to leave. Byrne&#x27;s last airdate on the show was April 22, 2008; her successor, Noelle Beck, appeared in the role of Lily from May 2008 until the series&#x27; end in 2010.

Byrne was hired as a script writer by Bradley Bell for &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; in early 2009. From June 17 though September 9, 2009, she portrayed Andrea Floyd on the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

Byrne began portraying Alexis Jordan (née Joanne Edwards) on the soap opera web series &quot;Anacostia&quot; in 2011, winning a 2012 Indie Series Award for Best Guest Appearance (Drama), and a 2015 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a New Approaches Drama Series. The entire cast won a 2015 Indie Series Award for Best Ensemble (Drama). Byrne served as a co-executive producer, director and writer for the series from 2012-2016, and was promoted to Executive Producer in the show&#x27;s 2017 fifth season. As a producer, Byrne was also nominated for the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding New Approaches Drama Series in 2015.

===Music===
Byrne is also a singer. She contributed a Christmas medley to the 1994 RCA release, &quot;A Soap Opera Christmas.&quot; She released her self-titled album &quot;Martha Byrne&quot; in 1996.

She has also released a second album, &quot;Woman Thing Music&quot;. Byrne again was the subject of controversy, as the sponsor of the second album was Philip Morris. The CD could only be purchased in conjunction with the purchase of cigarettes, or at one of the &quot;Woman Music Thing&quot; concerts that Philip Morris sponsored. Byrne eventually withdrew endorsement from the music label, as she did not want to be associated with a product that could encourage underage smoking.

In 2006 Byrne released a third album, &quot;The Other Side&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==
Byrne is a ten-time Daytime Emmy Award-nominee as actress and producer, winning Outstanding Younger Actress in 1987, Outstanding Lead Actress in 2001, and Outstanding Performer in a New Approaches Drama Series in 2015.

==Personal life==
Byrne married Michael McMahon, a former undercover officer in the New York City Police Department, on November 12, 1994. She grew up in Waldwick, New Jersey and lives in nearby Ridgewood.

Their first child, Michael Terrence McMahon, was born on May 29, 1998. An episode of the TLC series &quot;A Baby Story&quot; chronicled her second pregnancy and the birth of her son, Maxwell Vincent McMahon, on September 3, 2002. Their third child and first daughter, Annmarie, was born June 12, 2006.

<doc id="886617" wikidata="Q3749881" url="?curid=886617" title="Semiperimeter">
<text>In geometry, the semiperimeter of a polygon is half its perimeter. Although it has such a simple derivation from the perimeter, the semiperimeter appears frequently enough in formulas for triangles and other figures that it is given a separate name. When the semiperimeter occurs as part of a formula, it is typically denoted by the letter .

==Motivation: triangles==
The semiperimeter is used most often for triangles; the formula for the semiperimeter of a triangle with side lengths 
:formula_1

===Properties===

In any triangle, any vertex and the point where the opposite excircle touches the triangle partition the triangle&#x27;s perimeter into two equal lengths, thus creating two paths each of which has a length equal to the semiperimeter. If are as shown in the figure, then the segments connecting a vertex with the opposite excircle tangency (, shown in red in the diagram) are known as splitters, and

:formula_2

The three splitters concur at the Nagel point of the triangle.

A cleaver of a triangle is a line segment that bisects the perimeter of the triangle and has one endpoint at the midpoint of one of the three sides. So any cleaver, like any splitter, divides the triangle into two paths each of whose length equals the semiperimeter. The three cleavers concur at the center of the Spieker circle, which is the incircle of the medial triangle; the Spieker center is the center of mass of all the points on the triangle&#x27;s edges.

A line through the triangle&#x27;s incenter bisects the perimeter if and only if it also bisects the area.

A triangle&#x27;s semiperimeter equals the perimeter of its medial triangle.

By the triangle inequality, the longest side length of a triangle is less than the semiperimeter.

==Formulas involving the semiperimeter==

=== For triangles ===
The area of any triangle is the product of its inradius (the radius of its inscribed circle) and its semiperimeter:

:formula_3

The area of a triangle can also be calculated from its semiperimeter and side lengths using Heron&#x27;s formula:

:formula_4

The circumradius of a triangle can also be calculated from the semiperimeter and side lengths:
:formula_5
This formula can be derived from the law of sines.

The inradius is

: formula_6

The law of cotangents gives the cotangents of the half-angles at the vertices of a triangle in terms of the semiperimeter, the sides, and the inradius.

The length of the internal bisector of the angle opposite the side of length is

:formula_7

In a right triangle, the radius of the excircle on the hypotenuse equals the semiperimeter. The semiperimeter is the sum of the inradius and twice the circumradius. The area of the right triangle is formula_8 where are the legs.

=== For quadrilaterals ===
The formula for the semiperimeter of a quadrilateral with side lengths is
:formula_9

One of the triangle area formulas involving the semiperimeter also applies to tangential quadrilaterals, which have an incircle and in which (according to Pitot&#x27;s theorem) pairs of opposite sides have lengths summing to the semiperimeter—namely, the area is the product of the inradius and the semiperimeter:

:formula_10

The simplest form of Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral has a form similar to that of Heron&#x27;s formula for the triangle area:

:formula_11

Bretschneider&#x27;s formula generalizes this to all convex quadrilaterals:

:formula_12

in which and are two opposite angles.

The four sides of a bicentric quadrilateral are the four solutions of a quartic equation parametrized by the semiperimeter, the inradius, and the circumradius.

=== Regular polygons ===
The area of a convex regular polygon is the product of its semiperimeter and its apothem.

==Circles==
The semiperimeter of a circle, also called the semicircumference, is directly proportional to its radius :

:formula_13

The constant of proportionality is the number pi, .

<text>Labasa (; ) is a town in Fiji with a population of 28,500 at the 2010 census.

Labasa is located in Macuata Province, in the north-eastern part of the island of Vanua Levu, and is the largest town on the island. The town itself is located on a delta formed by three rivers – the Wailevu, the Labasa (after which the town is named), and the Qawa. The township historically served the sugar cane farms and farm workers with harvesting season resulting in significant seasonal employment, although the township is now less dependent on the sugar industry. The farmers&#x27; market offers seasonal produce and seafood. The main street is lined with small family run businesses, supermarkets and restaurants offering a lively pedestrian thoroughfare.

==Demographics &amp; culture==
Labasa is heavily Indo-Fijian, and downtown Labasa is consequently filled with curry houses and sari shops. It is the fourth-largest city in Fiji.

Known as the Friendly North for its warm, hospitable culture, Labasa is home to the popular Festival of the Friendly North, which has run for over 40 years and has resulted in over 1.3 million in charitable projects in the region.

==Climate==

==Economic activities==

The surrounding areas of Labasa are mostly farming areas, which contribute to much of the industry in the town. The largest crop grown is sugar cane. The large Fiji Sugar Corporation-1894 sugar mill on the outskirts of Labasa town is the only such mill on the island.

Recently, due to political changes and loss of overseas markets, sugar cane farming and production has been steadily decreasing. This has been reflected in the increasing migration of people to the main island of Viti Levu, in search of employment opportunities.

Labasa Hospital is the referral centre for all health centres and hospital on the island of Vanua Levu, and has recently been expanded.

Labasa is generally an agricultural town, off the tourist track. The Labasa Airport is located in Waiqele about 7 km from the town centre with multiple daily domestic flights to Nausori and Nadi international airports. Passenger ferry connections require an overland trip to either Nabouwalu or Savusavu. Labasa has a couple of hotels to stay in (Takia/Travel Lodge and Grand Eastern Hotel). There is at least one movie theatre and several restaurants in the main street providing a range of local and Chinese flavours.

There is a fairly large market towards the end of the town where one can buy and sample a range of foods, spices, fish, poultry, goats and other local products. A large taxi stand and a bus stop is also by the market.

It also has some popular tourist spots while the people of Labasa are quite well known for their hospitality.

==Sports==
Labasa is a soccer loving town. 
The Labasa soccer team is known as the &quot;Babasiga Lions&quot; and play their home games at Subrail Park. Its most famous talent is Roy Krishna, born and bred in Siberia, a farming community about five kilometres from Labasa town. Roy Krishna is also Fiji&#x27;s flag bearer to the 2019 Pacific Games held in Samoa.

Labasa FC prides itself for having featured prodigious talents such as Ivor Evans, Simon Peters and Taniela Tuilevuka.

Labasa and Fiji soccer legend, Simon Peters, was known as the Maradona of Fiji soccer.

The former national soccer striker died at his Labasa home in 2009 a day after his son Misaele Draunibaka was selected to be part of the national Under 20 team.
The former Labasa striker and military officer began his soccer career at 17 in 1987 after being chosen to play for the national U20 team alongside Maritino Nemani, Ravuama Madigi, Abdul Mannan and Raymond Stoddart.

He was also a member of the national team that defeated Australia in 1988, later won gold in the 1991 South Pacific Games.

His peer Ravuama Madigi said this about him: A very obedient man who demonstrated his discipline on and off the field. His disciplined military background is what helps Simon a lot during our soccer days. He is a role model to many of us who played with him since the u20 grade in 1987.
He never gives up or loses hope and always keeps on fighting for the best.
A soft-spoken and humble gentleman whom many players learnt self respect and discipline from.
He should be a role model to Fiji soccer and to the current and upcoming players; following Simon&#x27;s footsteps could lead to a far better soccer career for many of our youths if they want to succeed.

Raymond Stoddart, a National soccer broadcaster Stoddard said: The most special thing for Simon during his soccer days is his footwork. It is a delight to watch.
Whenever he takes the ball, the public watching the game know what he is going to do with it.
He has got a caliber that current players should follow if they want to be successful strikers.
His ball control skills speed and game finishing is what make Simon counts.
In Fiji, and across the South Pacific, Simon &#x27;Maradona&#x27; Peters was one of the deadliest finishers known in his playing days.

==Local government==
Incorporated as a town in 1939, Labasa is governed by a 12-member town council, whose members elect a Mayor from among themselves. Councillors serve three-year terms; the Mayor&#x27;s term is for one year, but may be extended any number of times. Labasa&#x27;s current Mayor, elected on 28 October 2005 following the municipal election to the town council one week earlier, is Dr Pradeep Singh of the Fiji Labour Party (FLP). Leslie Williams was chosen as his deputy, but was replaced by Shivlal Nagindas on 30 October 2006.

In 2009, the Military-backed interim government dismissed all municipal governments throughout Fiji and appointed special administrators to run the urban areas. As of 2015, elected municipal government has not been restored. The special administrator of Labasa, along with nearby Savusavu, is Vijay Chand.

<doc id="886639" wikidata="Q1272642" url="?curid=886639" title="Neck-through-body construction">
<text>Neck-through-body (commonly neck-thru or neck-through) is a method of electric guitar construction that combines the instrument&#x27;s
neck and core of its body into a single unit. This may be made of a solid piece of wood, or two or more laminated together. The strings, nut, fretboard, pickups and bridge are all mounted on this central core. Additional body side components (if any) that fill-out its shape are glued or mechanically attached to this central core. These are referred to as &quot;wings&quot;. The construction technique is also used on electric bass guitars.

Neck-through-body construction is considerably more expensive than the traditional glued set-in neck and bolt-on neck style construction methods. However, it&#x27;s less costly than the very rare and difficult &quot;one-piece&quot; fabrication of an entire instrument made from a single piece of material.

== History ==
The first electric bass guitar, the solid-body &quot;Audiovox 736&quot; created by Paul Tutmarc circa 1937, had a neck-through construction.

&quot;The Log&quot;, a prototype solid-body guitar built by Les Paul in 1941, can be considered as a forerunner of neck-through designed instrument. Les Paul built the model using a recycled 4x4 fence post as the neck and body core, and mounted the disassembled parts of an Epiphone and Gibson archtop guitar onto it. 

The 1952-57 Harmony H44 had this construction feature.

In 1956 Rickenbacker was one of the first guitar manufacturers to use the modern variant of this technique, although this was originally restricted exclusively to semi-hollowbody guitars.

== Pros and cons == 

The most important benefit for the player of a neck-thru guitar is the reduction of heel mass. The heel is the term used to describe the thickened area of the end of the neck and/or body where the neck is attached to the body. Body-neck connection area thickening is required for structural integrity. In violins this area&#x27;s called the &quot;button&quot;, &quot;saddle&quot; or &quot;nose&quot;.

The area where the neck attaches to the body is naturally a weak zone. There&#x27;s a lot of pressure exerted on the instrument due to the combined tension of all the strings pulling on the instrument between the tuners and the bridge. The neck-body connection area is weaker if you have to join a separate neck to a body. The screws (bolt-on) or glue (set-neck) used to connect the neck to the body requires significant area to be able to provide sound structural integrity to act against the string&#x27;s tension and bond body to neck totally stably to ensure tuning stability of the instrument. Heel mass then becomes an obstacle when attempting to reach higher registers of the fretboard.

Neck-through construction allows easier access to higher frets because there is no need for a bulky heel as there is no neck-to-body connection. In such an instrument, the neck morphs into the body of such an instrument. When constructing a neck-through guitar the luthier can chamfer the neck-body transition area (which would be the heel) to a minimum, sometimes almost relieving the heel entirely. This allows easier, sometimes unhindered, access to the upper registers.

For players of rhythm or open chords alone, or players that do not reach up to the highest registers of the fretboard in lead or solo playing, this benefit is very minimal and will still necessitate increased cost of the production method. 

However, some opine that a neck-thru guitar sounds different to a bolt-on construction instrument. This opinion asserts that neck-through construction provides greater sustain, richer overtones and increased tuning stability inherent in the design when compared to a bolt-on construction. But hard physical evidence for any of these is lacking, and the attribution of long sustain has been definitively contradicted by experimentation.

Neck-through construction is significantly harder to mass-produce than bolt-on or set-in neck constructions. As such, guitars with this construction method tend to be more expensive than guitars made by other methods. This method of construction may be somewhat more common in basses than in guitars.

Repairs to the neck are usually expensive and tedious. In many cases, it is usually easier to remove the old neck completely, either by taking the wings off and putting an entirely new core in, or by converting the guitar to a bolt-on or set-neck by creating a heel and affixing the new neck to the core already in place, rather than to try to repair the neck itself. However, thanks to excellent stability and reaction to string tension and pressure, neck-through guitars tend to be more sturdy.

== Use ==
This structure is used by many companies, including Parker Guitars, BC Rich, Yamaha, Cort Guitars, Ibanez (primarily on basses), Jackson, Alembic, Schecter, Carvin, ESP Guitars, .strandberg*, Dean, Halo, Rickenbacker and many others.

Many configurations of the Gibson Firebird and Thunderbird are also built neck-through.

The construction method is also popular with independent guitar builders, who can typically devote more time to such a labour-intensive neck joint than a mass-producing company could.

<doc id="886647" wikidata="Q918409" url="?curid=886647" title="MOS Technology 8502">
<text>The MOS Technology 8502 is an 8-bit microprocessor designed by MOS Technology and used in the Commodore 128 (C128). It is an improved version of the MOS 6510 used in the Commodore 64 (C64). It was manufactured using the HMOS process, allowing it to have higher transistor density, and lower cost, while dissipating less heat. The 8502 allows the C128 to run at double the clock rate of the C64 with some limitations.

==Description==
===Memory access in 8-bit machines===
Common random-access memory (RAM) of the Commodore C64-era allowed accesses at 2 MHz. If the CPU and display chip both shared the same memory to communicate, which was the common solution in the era when RAM was expensive, then one would normally have to have the CPU and display chip arbitrate access to the bus so that only one of them used it at a time, generally by having one of them pause the other. Assuming the two chips require roughly equal access, that means the chips are paused half of the time, each effectively running at 1 MHz.

The 6502-family had a feature that eased the design of such systems. The 6502 used a two-phase clock to drive its internal circuitry, but only accessed memory during one of the two phases. That meant the display chip could access memory during alternating clock phases without having to pause the CPU. The major advantage of this style of access is that the two chips do not have to communicate to pause each other, they simply watch the already-existing clock signal present on the 6502&#x27;s pins. In the original C64, this timing trick was used to allow the VIC-II to interleave its access to main memory with that of the 6510.

===8502===
The 8502 is mostly a conversion of the original 6502 to be fabricated on Intel&#x27;s HMOS-II process, introduced in 1979 and available for 3rd party use. This process used smaller feature sizes, which allowed the same chip to be produced within a smaller area, and thus to cost less (not only for using less material but also because of greater yield). As a result of being smaller, the chip also required less energy to run and dissipated less heat. This made it useful in some roles where the original 6502 might not be appropriate.

The original 6502 came in three versions, A, B and C, differing in their maximum speed, 1, 2 or 4 MHz, respectively. There was no physical difference between these designs; if a particular chip ran successfully at 2 MHz in testing it was labeled B, otherwise A. With the move to the HMOS process, most of the 8502s were capable of running at 2 MHz, the equivalent of the 6502B.

Changing the running speed of a 6502-based processor is as simple as changing the input clock signal, which meant the 8502 could easily switch between 2 MHz and the 6510&#x27;s 1 MHz. When the clock runs at double-speed, it faces the problem that there is not enough time for the VIC to access memory during the free half-cycles. For this reason, the 8502 could only run at double-speed full-time when being used with the 80-column VDC in the C128, which had separate memory for the display that was not being directly accessed by the CPU.

When running a VIC display mode, the two chips began to share access as was the case in the C64, and this meant the CPU had to return to its normal ~1 MHz speed. Programs could disable the screen during CPU-intensive calculations to allow the CPU to run at its faster speed. A smaller speed gain, about 35%, was also possible while keeping the VIC display active by switching the CPU to 2 MHz only while the VIC is drawing the empty border along the top and bottom of the screen, since the VIC performs no RAM access during that time.

The pinout is slightly different than the 6510. The 8502 has an extra I/O-pin (the built-in I/O port mapped to addresses 0 and 1 is extended from 6 to 7 bits) and lacks the ϕ2-pin that the 6510 had. The 8502 family also includes the MOS 7501, 8500 and 8501.

Eskişehir has a cold semi-arid steppe climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) according to Köppen climate classification. It features warm to hot dry summers and cold to freezing winters.

==Districts==

Eskişehir Province is divided into 14 districts:

* Alpu
* Beylikova
* Çifteler
* Günyüzü
* Han
* İnönü
* Mahmudiye
* Mihalgazi
* Mihalıççık
* Odunpazarı
* Sarıcakaya
* Seyitgazi
* Sivrihisar
* Tepebaşı
==Demographics==

Eskişehir&#x27;s population has a high literacy level of 99%. Many universities and military installations are located in and around the city. Turkish technical students are concentrated in the Eskişehir universities. Infrastructural problems have been partially solved in 2004 with the construction of a tram system.

Eskisehir, and neighboring cities were the major settlement area for the descendants of the founders of the Ottoman Empire, about 1000 years ago. Many villages in the province carry the names of the Turkish tribes/clans from those times. Some people in the city of Eskişehir trace their family origin back to Crimea and the Caucasus. There are also descendants of Turkish immigrants from the Balkans fleeing war and persecution.

==Meerschaum==
Eskişehir is internationally known as the source of Meerschaum, a white foamy stone which is used for making smoking pipes with detailed carvings. The stone is called &quot;lületaşı&quot; in Turkish.

== Archaeological discoveries ==
In August 2019, researchers head by Prof. Murat Türkteki announced the discovery of two skeletons dating back about 5,000 years in the same sarcophagus in Early Bronze Age settlement Küllüoba. Excavators assumed that one of the skeletons was a 13-year-old girl and other was a man in his late 30s.

In August 2020, archaeologists head by Prof. Murat Türktaki revealed a 5,000-year-old paint palette made of stone in the Seyitgazi district at the Küllüoba site. According to Türktaki, this palette was used for painting dishes. 

In March 2021, discovery of the marble sarcophagus which is 1.5 meters tall and 33 centimeters wide in the Seyitgazi district at the Küllüoba site was announced by the municipal workers while construction work.

<doc id="886668" wikidata="Q1225098" url="?curid=886668" title="Digital zoom">
<text>Digital zoom is a method of decreasing the precise angle of view of a digital photograph or video image. It is accomplished by cropping an image down to an area with the same aspect ratio as the original, and scaling the image up to the dimensions of the original. The camera&#x27;s optics are not adjusted. It is accomplished electronically, so no optical resolution is gained. Digital zooming may be enhanced by computationally expensive algorithms which sometimes involves artificial intelligence.

In cameras that perform lossy compression, digital zoom is preferred to enlargement in post-processing, as the zooming may be applied before detail is lost to compression. In cameras that save in a lossless format, resizing in post-production yields results equal or superior to digital zoom.

Lower-end camera phones use only digital zoom and do not have optical zoom, while many higher-end phones have additional rear cameras, including fixed telephoto lenses that allow for the simulation of optical zoom. Full-sized cameras generally have an optical zoom lens, but some apply digital zoom automatically once the longest optical focal length possible has been reached. Professional cameras generally do not feature digital zoom.

==Not-deteriorated zoom limit==
An optical zoom camera can be zoomed to its optical limit, and further zooming is sometimes allowed by digital zoom. Digital zoom uses the centre area of the optical image to enlarge the image. By reducing the image size, digital zoom occurs without image deterioration of the output image, and some cameras have a &quot;not-deteriorated image&quot; mode or an image deterioration indicator.

The table below shows the not-deteriorated zoom limit for some megapixel (MP) image sizes of a particular camera with optical zoom 24x, and digital zoom 4x for its maximum capability:


Some camera firmwares store lossily digitally zoomed images with accordingly reduced dimensions (width and height) rather than upscaling it to the original raster resolution. The benefits are reduced file sizes and the ability to calculate the zoom level from the image&#x27;s dimensions, if not included in its meta data.

Cameras may have an intelligent zoom feature that allows an additional magnification of 2.0× on top of its optical zoom. Many cameras have 2 options: 1.4× and 2.0×. The intelligent zoom only uses the centre of the image sensor and does not interpolate the original resolution, so the resulting image quality is good in reduced resolution.

Hybrid zoom is a concept used in smartphones that takes advantage of optical zoom, digital zoom, and software to get improved results when zooming in further than the lens&#x27; physical capabilities. Smartphones with optical zoom have lenses with 3× or 5× magnification. Trying to zoom in further than this limit may result in loss of quality as the camera switches to digital zoom, though hybrid zoom may mitigate this. Many cameras, including mobile phone cameras, also employ lossless digital zoom for video recording by using the spare resolution of the image sensor for cropping by taking advantage of used video frame resolutions often being significantly below the available resolution of the image sensors.

This means that, for example, if implemented correctly by the camera hardware and software, a 2160p image sensor would enable up to 2× lossless digital zoom for 1080p video recording, 3× for 720p video, and 4.5× for 480p video by using image sensor cropping.

The terms among camera and image sensor manufacturers are &quot;Smart Zoom&quot; (Sony), &quot;Safe Zoom&quot; (Canon), &quot;Sensor Crop&quot; (Cisco) and &quot;Intelligent Zoom&quot; (Panasonic and others). There are also cameras with digital zoom functions as high as 7.2× and Smart Zoom with approximately 30× total zoom (optical zoom 20× and digital zoom 1.5×) for 7MP from 16MP total resolution, and also 144× total zoom (optical zoom 20× and digital zoom 7.2×) for VGA 640x480.

==Aesthetic==
Photographers can purposefully employ digital zoom for the characteristic low-fidelity appearance of the images it produces. The appearance of poor quality in photographs can be intentionally used to imply carelessness on the part of the photographer and a sense of candidness in the photograph.

<doc id="886672" wikidata="Q3015580" url="?curid=886672" title="Dans une galaxie près de chez vous">
<text>Dans une galaxie près de chez vous (English: &quot;In a galaxy near you&quot;) is a Quebec French language television series that aired on Canal Famille (later Vrak.TV) from January 25, 1999 to November 25, 2001, and a movie of the same name, released in 2004. The second movie, &quot;Dans une galaxie près de chez vous 2&quot;, was released in April 2008. There have been rumours of a third movie since 2016, but no official announcements have been made. It is a humorous sci-fi parody.

==Television show==

===Synopsis===
The series chronicles the long, futuristic voyage of a team of Québécois space explorers who venture outside our galaxy, looking for a planet capable of sustaining life for all humankind in the year 2034, after the destruction of the ozone layer through excessive human pollution, prompting the need to find a new planet Earth. The few habitable planets encountered are ultimately abandoned either because they are already occupied (emphasizing the wrongdoing of invading other civilizations and cultures), or because upon closer inspection they are found to have other problems, such as cow-sized mosquitoes, high radiation levels, dog overpopulation, unsuitable living environment, and other issues.

Using the classic sitcom style, the characters&#x27; interactions drive the main plot in the same recurring spaceship sets (the bridge, dormitories, medical room, hallways). Occasionally, scenes are shot outside of the ship on alien planets being explored; these generic alien-world scenes tend to be shot in-studio. The satirical humor of the show is heightened by playing on the fact that the characters themselves recognize the farfetchedness of the universe in which they live and much of the series&#x27; comic relief is derived from the look and feel of low-budget set (an alien is obviously a human only painted green, gadgets are recognizable objects, etc.). The script, written by Claude Legault who also plays Flavien, and Pierre-Yves Bernard, plays a lot on clichés of all types, word play (especially Quebec slang), parodies and sketch comedy. A lot of the comedy is also based on the group&#x27;s dynamics and reactions to certain events, such as the entire crew turning their heads in the same direction every time the captain says the word &quot;mission&quot;. Many aspects of the show reflect Québécois culture; some scenes involve a complete picture of traditional Quebec.

The starship, christened &quot;Romano Fafard&quot;, is led by Captain Charles Patenaude (played by Guy Jodoin), a presumptuous but endearing man prone to making pompous, solemn declarations, with a knack for screwing up when saying proverbs or quoting philosophers. Other members include: Flavien Bouchard (Claude Legault), the radar operator who possesses heightened senses and is in desperate search for his father (it is learned in the last season that his dad is an alien), Bob Dieudonné Marcellin (Didier Lucien), a bald, black chubby man who is the spaceship pilot (the spaceship&#x27;s dashboard is a bus dashboard, complete with steering wheel) who is best friends with Flavien and who obsesses over two things: food and Petrolia Staneslavsky (Mélanie Ménard). Petrolia is a half-Russian space orphan whose inventiveness seems to cause just as many problems as it solves. She is in a relationship with Flavien. Serge (Réal Bossé) is a humanoid robot Petrolia created, stricken with multiple personalities and abilities and who is constantly falling into disrepair. Valence Leclerc (Isabelle Brossard first season and Sylvie Moreau subsequent seasons) is the ship&#x27;s psychologist but assumes all medical functions as well. She and the captain are secretly in love (until the last episode of the 3rd season). Brad Spitfire (Stéphane Crête), the resident scientist, is cause for most of the plot conflicts and complications. His main objective is to become captain. He is anti-social, power-hungry, egotistic, Machiavellian and incredibly weak and sensitive, though generally not of other&#x27;s feelings. Despite these, actor Stéphane Crête makes Brad one of the series&#x27; most amusing and lovable characters.

The show evolved greatly between the first and last season. In the first episode of the second season, two characters disappeared: Falbo Gotta (Paul Ahmarani), the ship&#x27;s mercenary and protector, and Mirabella Romario (Pascale Montpetit), the ship&#x27;s doctor who turned out to be a criminal who faked her way to employment on the ship in order to run away from the world police. It is after being finally revealed as an impostor that Mirabella left the ship, followed by Falbo who got lost looking for her. Not long after their departure, Petrolia and Serge were found and filled in their spots. It is revealed in a later episode that Falbo and Mirabella have survived and are living peacefully on the planet they were left on.

===Background===
The series is a parody of science-fiction works like &quot;Star Trek&quot; or &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; and often dealt with environmentalism, humanitarianism, pacifism and ethics. Most members of the team subscribe to these noble morals, with the notable exception of Brad Spitfire.

The title translates to &quot;In a galaxy near you&quot;, a pun on the classic cinema advertising line &quot;Coming to a theatre near you&quot;. It was initially set to be broadcast on a mainstream network under the name &quot;Vadrouille de l&#x27;espace&quot;. &quot;Patrouille du cosmos&quot; &quot;(Space Patrol)&quot; is the Quebec French language title of &quot;Star Trek&quot; (France knows it by its original title); &quot;Vadrouille de l&#x27;espace&quot; basically translates to &quot;Casual Space Journey&quot;. Science fiction being rare in Quebec fiction, the main networks ultimately did risk broadcasting the show. The creators turned to the youth-oriented &quot;Canal Famille&quot;, the former name of &quot;Vrak TV&quot;, who welcomed the project. Even though it was presented on a children&#x27;s channel, its humour is, while caricatural, often relatively mature and sophisticated.

==Movie==
A movie of the same title and premise was released in 2004. It proved to be a hit with younger and older viewers, and drew unanticipatedly good reviews from intellectual critics. It was also groundbreaking for its impressive special effects accomplished with a small budget and a short filming time, and for being one of the few sci-fi Quebec films, along with &quot;In the Belly of the Dragon (Dans le ventre du dragon)&quot;. The second &quot;Galaxie&quot; movie, &quot;Dans une galaxie près de chez vous 2&quot;, was released to theatres on April 18, 2008. A third chapter of &quot;Galaxie&quot; was planned; however, only very little information about it has been made public.

<text>HEP is a major shopping mall and entertainment center in the Umeda commercial district of Kita-ku, Osaka, Japan. It is a shopping mall consisting of a HEP Five and HEP Navio.

HEP stands for &quot;Hankyu Entertainment Park&quot;. The building is operated by Hankyu Hanshin Holdings&#x27;s real estate investment trust (REIT) subsidiary Hankyu REIT and co-owned by Hankyu REIT (45%) and Hankyu Realty Co. (55%).

==HEP Five==
HEP Five receives about 17 million visitors annually (2007), making it one of the most visited fashion boutique buildings in the Osaka urban region. The core customers at HEP Five are young people, mostly female, from high school age to their early twenties.

The building itself houses over 100 shops (mostly fashion retail shops catering to young consumers), with restaurants, an event hall, amusement facilities (such as Joypolis and the Ferris wheel), a hanging replica of 2 whales designed by Tatsuya Ishii.

===Ferris wheel===
The HEP Five building is easily located as it has a large red Ferris wheel with a diameter of 75 metres protruding from its roof (the highest point of the wheel is 106m above the ground, including the height of the building), which is accessible for a fee.

<text>Digital poetry is a form of electronic literature, displaying a wide range of approaches to poetry, with a prominent and crucial use of computers. Digital poetry can be available in form of CD-ROM, DVD, as installations in art galleries, in certain cases also recorded as digital video or films, as digital holograms, on the World Wide Web or Internet, and as mobile phone apps.

According to Saum-Pascual (2019), digital poetry is the artistic heir to the avant-garde movements of the second half of the 20th century, including Lettrism, concrete poetry, and conceptual poetry.

A significant portion of current publications of poetry are available either only online or via some combination of online and offline publication. Digital poetry types hypertext, kinetic poetry, computer generated animation, digital visual poetry, interactive poetry, code poetry, experimental video poetry, and poetries that take advantage of the programmable nature of the computer to create works that are interactive, or use a generative or combinatorial approach to create text (or one of its states), or involve sound poetry, or take advantage of things like listservs, blogs, and other forms of network communication to create communities of collaborative writing and publication (as in poetical wikis).

Digital platforms allow the creation of art that spans different media: text, images, sounds, and interactivity via programming. Contemporary poetries have, therefore, taken advantage of this toward the creation of works that synthesize both arts and media. Whether a work is poetry visual art music or programming is sometimes not clear, but we expect an intense engagement with language in poetical works.

==History==
Early digital poems include Christopher Strachey&#x27;s love letter generator (1952), the stochastic texts which were indirectly produced by the German mathematician Theo Lutz in 1959 by programming a Z22 of Konrad Zuse; Nanni Balestrini&#x27;s &quot;Tape Mark I&quot; in Italian, published in 1961; and Brion Gysin&#x27;s English permutation poems from around 1959, done automatically with the collaboration of Ian Somerville. These and other early digital poems are discussed in C. T. Funkhouser&#x27;s &quot;Prehistoric Digital Poetry.&quot;

==Hypertext==
Hypertext poetry refers to creative works that are interconnected through the mechanics of digitization. This form of cyberpoetry has a specific focus on visual arts that are connected across different mediums. In other words, hypertext poetry is a classification of digital poetry that links the reader to different places in a document or different documents on the Internet. In general, hypertext poetry combines the elements of culture and intertextuality to marry poetry to various digital mediums such as images, videos, texts, and songs.

Hypertext usually falls into two categories: exploratory and constructive. Exploratory hypertext poetry allows users to navigate through a text by interest, engagement, and reflection. This means readers can explore and think creatively about a poem that is digitized on a computer. Constructive hypertext poetry takes a different approach. This poetry is built by an audience over time to create a fully fleshed-out final draft. Along with this, audiences can look at previous versions of the text. In all, the focus of constructive hypertext poetry is how computer software and machinery can enhance the creation of poetry. As such, users can see first-hand the amalgamation of an author&#x27;s inspiration, writing process, and cultural influences.

The advent of hypertext poetry can be dated back to the mid-1980s. Ted Nelson is often credited for coining the term in the 1960s. Ted Nelson coined the term as he believed printed text would soon be outdated and that literature would move to a more digital sphere. Some people disagree on when exactly the term came to be. &quot;Hypertext&quot; has origins in the 18th century. Moreover, it is believed that Vannevar Bush&#x27;s description of &quot;the memex&quot; in 1945 also referred to hypertext.

While there are a variety of factors that have caused hypertext to be as well known as it is today, its popularization can be traced back to two particular events. One event is Apple&#x27;s invention and heavy promotion of the &quot;Hypercard&quot; in 1987. This made hypertext less niche, where thousands of people could now recognize and understand the concept. In addition, there was a large national conference on hypertext held in 1987, drawing participants from multiple studies and disciplines.

==Interactivity==
Interactive poetry is a form of digital poetry by which the reader may or must contribute to the content, form, or performance of the work, thereby influencing the meaning and experience of the poem. Interaction allows the reader to participate and influence the work and their experience of it.

Interactive poetry is limited to a digital medium as it cannot perform the same function in other media such as print, which limits accessibility. Interactive poetry can also provide a different experience with each reading or from reader to reader so analysis of this type of poetry can be challenging as the experience is not static.

An example of audience participatory poetry is &quot;haikU&quot; by Nanette Wylde. Elit scholar, Scott Rettberg writes of this project &quot;Nanette Wylde’s &quot;haikU&quot; (2001) is a project based on principles of user participation and on the use of a randomizing function to produce haiku that startle in the sense of producing unintended juxtapositions—no single author has determined which lines will appear together. The reading interface is a simple, spare web page. Every time a reader reloads the page, a new haiku is produced. Following a link to “Write haiku” individuals can submit their own haiku in three lines, each of which has its own button to post the line to bins of first, middle, and last lines. The poems delivered on each reload of the site are not the individual haiku as submitted by readers, but recombinations of these first, middle, and last lines of haiku pulled together in a variable way. Reloading the page twenty times or so, it is remarkable how many of the poems read as if they have been individually intended by a human intelligence. Most of the haiku, perhaps 80%, cohere quite well as poetry.&quot;

<doc id="886681" wikidata="Q1230327" url="?curid=886681" title="Ditone">
<text>In music, a ditone (, from , &quot;of two tones&quot;) is the interval of a major third. The size of a ditone varies according to the sizes of the two tones of which it is compounded. The largest is the Pythagorean ditone, with a ratio of 81:64, also called a comma-redundant major third; the smallest is the interval with a ratio of 100:81, also called a comma-deficient major third.

==Pythagorean tuning==
The Pythagorean ditone is the major third in Pythagorean tuning, which has an interval ratio of 81:64, which is 407.82 cents. The Pythagorean ditone is evenly divisible by two major tones (9/8 or 203.91 cents) and is wider than a just major third (5/4, 386.31 cents) by a syntonic comma (81/80, 21.51 cents). Because it is a comma wider than a &quot;perfect&quot; major third of 5:4, it is called a &quot;comma-redundant&quot; interval. 

&quot;The major third that appears commonly in the [Pythagorean] system (C–E, D–F, etc.) is more properly known as the Pythagorean ditone and consists of two major and two minor semitones (2M+2m). This is the interval that is extremely sharp, at 408c (the &quot;pure&quot; major third is only 386c).&quot;

It may also be thought of as four justly tuned fifths minus two octaves. 

The prime factorization of the 81:64 ditone is 3^4/2^6 (or 3/1 * 3/1 * 3/1 * 3/1 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2).

==Just intonation==
In Didymus&#x27;s diatonic and Ptolemy&#x27;s syntonic tunings, the ditone is a just major third with a ratio of 5:4, made up of two unequal tones—a major and a minor tone of 9:8 and 10:9, respectively. The difference between the two systems is that Didymus places the minor tone below the major, whereas Ptolemy does the opposite.

==Meantone temperament==
In meantone temperaments, the major tone and minor tone are replaced by a &quot;mean tone&quot; which is somewhere in between the two. Two of these tones make a ditone or major third. This major third is exactly the just (5:4) major third in quarter-comma meantone. This is the source of the name: the note exactly halfway between the bounding tones of the major third is called the &quot;mean tone&quot;.

==Equal temperament==
Modern writers occasionally use the word &quot;ditone&quot; to describe the interval of a major third in equal temperament. For example, &quot;In modern acoustics, the equal-tempered semitone has 100 cents, the tone 200 cents, the ditone or major third 400 cents, the perfect fourth 500 cents, and so on. …”

<text>Active Citizens Transform was founded in 2004 by Charles Secrett, former Executive Director of the environmental organisation, Friends of the Earth, and Ron Bailey, as a new non-party political movement in the United Kingdom. It aims to mobilise citizens to transform the United Kingdom into a vibrant, participatory and sustainable society. It opposes the &quot;first-past-the-post&quot; electoral system.

ACT published an advertisement in 2005 criticising Labour party members of parliament who promised to support environmental policies but, under pressure from the Labour party&#x27;s leadership, voted against environmental measures opposed by the British government. The &quot;advertisement&quot; was criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority for making misleading claims.

One of ACT&#x27;s main projects was Local Works the successful campaign for the Sustainable Communities Bill. ACT inherited this campaign from the New Economics Foundation.

In 2006, ACT formally merged with Charter88, which in turn merged with the New Politics Network in 2007 to form Unlock Democracy.

<text>Robert Martin Culp (August 16, 1930 – March 24, 2010) was an American actor and screenwriter widely known for his work in television. Culp earned an international reputation for his role as Kelly Robinson on &quot;I Spy&quot; (1965–1968), the espionage television series in which he and co-star Bill Cosby played secret agents. Before this, he starred in the CBS/Four Star Western series &quot;Trackdown&quot; as Texas Ranger Hoby Gilman in 71 episodes from 1957 to 1959. The 1980s brought him back to television as FBI Agent Bill Maxwell on &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot;. Later, he had a recurring role as Warren Whelan on &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, and was a voice actor for various computer games, including &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;. Culp gave hundreds of performances in a career spanning more than 50 years.

==Early life and education==
Culp was born on August 16, 1930, in either Oakland, California, or Berkeley, California. He was the only child of Crozier Cordell Culp, an attorney, and his wife, Bethel Martin Culp (née Collins). He graduated from Berkeley High School, where he was a pole vaulter and took second place at the 1947 CIF California State Meet.

Culp attended the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California, and later Washington University in St. Louis, San Francisco State, and the University of Washington School of Drama, but never completed an academic degree. He also received acting training at HB Studio in New York City.

==Career==
===Television performances===
Culp came to national attention early in his career as the star of the 1957–1959 CBS Western television series &quot;Trackdown&quot;, in which he played Texas Ranger Hoby Gilman, based in the town of Porter, Texas. It was one of Culp&#x27;s many appearances in TV Westerns. The pilot for &quot;Trackdown&quot; was &quot;Badge of Honor&quot;, a 1956 episode of &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot;, in which Culp starred as Gilman. 

In 1960, he appeared in two more episodes of &quot;Zane Grey Theatre&quot;, playing different roles in &quot;Morning Incident&quot; and &quot;Calico Bait&quot;. After &quot;Trackdown&quot; ended in 1959 after two seasons, Culp continued to work in television, including a guest-starring role as Stewart Douglas in the 1960 episode &quot;So Dim the Light&quot; of CBS&#x27;s anthology series &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;. In the summer of 1960, he guest-starred on David McLean&#x27;s NBC Western series &quot;Tate&quot;.

He played Clay Horne in the series finale, &quot;Cave-In&quot;, of the CBS Western &quot;Johnny Ringo&quot;, starring Don Durant. In 1961, Culp played the part of Craig Kern, a morphine-addicted soldier, in the episode &quot;Incident on Top of the World&quot; in the CBS series &quot;Rawhide&quot;. About this time, Culp was cast on the NBC anthology series, &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot; and in the NBC Civil War drama, &quot;The Americans&quot;. Culp was cast as Captain Shark in a first-season episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (1964). Some of his more memorable performances were in three episodes of the science-fiction anthology series on &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; (1963–1965), including the classic &quot;Demon with a Glass Hand&quot;, written by Harlan Ellison. In the 1961 season, he guest-starred on the NBC&#x27;s Western &quot;Bonanza&quot;. In the 1961–1962 season, he guest-starred on ABC&#x27;s crime drama &quot;&quot; and that network&#x27;s &quot;The Rifleman.&quot; In the 1962–1963 season, he guest-starred in NBC&#x27;s modern Western series &quot;Empire&quot; starring Richard Egan.

In 1964, Culp played Charlie Orwell, an alcoholic veterinarian, in an episode of &quot;The Virginian&quot; (NBC 1962–1971) titled &quot;The Stallion&quot;. That same year, he appeared in yet another Western, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. In the series&#x27; episode &quot;Hung High&quot;, he portrays an outlaw named Joe Costa, who attempts to frame Matt Dillon for lynching a prisoner who had killed the marshal&#x27;s friend. In 1965, he was cast as Frank Melo in &quot;The Tender Twigs&quot; of James Franciscus&#x27;s NBC education drama series, &quot;Mr. Novak&quot;.

Culp then played perhaps his most memorable character, American secret agent Kelly Robinson, who operated undercover as a touring tennis professional, for three years on the hit NBC series &quot;I Spy&quot; (1965–1968), with co-star Bill Cosby. Culp wrote the scripts for seven episodes, one of which he also directed and an episode earned him an Emmy nomination for writing. For all three years of the series, he was also nominated for an acting Emmy (Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Series category), but lost each time to Cosby.
In 1968, Culp also made an uncredited cameo appearance as an inebriated Turkish waiter on &quot;Get Smart&quot;, the spy-spoof comedy series, in an &quot;I Spy&quot; parody episode titled &quot;Die Spy&quot;. In this, secret agent Maxwell Smart played by Don Adams in effect assumes Culp&#x27;s Kelly Robinson character, as he pretends to be an international table-tennis champion. The episode faithfully recreates the &quot;I Spy&quot; theme music, montage graphics, and back-and-forth banter between Robinson and Scott, with actor/comedian Stu Gilliam imitating Cosby.

In 1971, Culp, Peter Falk, Robert Wagner, and Darren McGavin each stepped in to take turns with Anthony Franciosa&#x27;s rotation of NBC&#x27;s series &quot;The Name of the Game&quot; after Franciosa was fired, alternating a lead role of the lavish, 90-minute show about the magazine business with Gene Barry and Robert Stack. Also in 1971, he portrayed an unemployed actor, the husband of ambitious Angie Dickinson, in the TV movie &quot;See the Man Run&quot;. Culp played the murderer in three &quot;Columbo&quot; episodes (&quot;Death Lends a Hand&quot; in 1971, &quot;The Most Crucial Game&quot; in 1972, &quot;Double Exposure&quot; in 1973) and also appeared in the 1990 episode &quot;Columbo Goes to College&quot; as the father of one of two young murderers. He also played the murderer in the pilot episode of &quot;Mrs. Columbo&quot; starring Kate Mulgrew in the title role.

In 1973, Culp almost took the male lead in the sci-fi television series &quot;&quot;. During negotiations with creator and executive producer Gerry Anderson, Culp expressed himself to be not only an asset as an actor, but also as a director and producer for the proposed series. The part instead went to Martin Landau.

Culp co-starred in &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot; as tough veteran FBI Special Agent Bill Maxwell, who teams up with a high-school teacher who receives superpowers from extraterrestrials. He wrote and directed the second-season finale episode &quot;Lilacs, Mr. Maxwell&quot;, with free rein to do the episode as he saw fit. The show lasted three years from 1981 to 1983. He reprised the role in the spin-off pilot &quot;The Greatest American Heroine&quot; and a voice-over on the stop-motion sketch comedy &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;. During that time, Culp was rumored to replace Larry Hagman as J. R. Ewing in &quot;Dallas.&quot; However, Culp firmly denied this, insisting he would never leave his role as Bill Maxwell. In 1987, he reunited with Cosby on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, playing Dr. Cliff Huxtable&#x27;s old friend Scott Kelly. The name was a combination of their &quot;I Spy&quot; characters&#x27; names.

Culp had a recurring role on &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; as Warren Whelan, the father of Debra Barone and father-in-law of Ray Barone. He appeared on episodes of other television programs, including a 1961 season-three episode of &quot;Bonanza&quot; titled &quot;Broken Ballad&quot;, as well as &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;The Nanny&quot;, &quot;The Girls Next Door&quot;, and &quot;Wings&quot;. He was the voice of the character Halcyon Renard in the Disney adventure cartoon &quot;Gargoyles&quot;.

In &quot;I Spy Returns&quot; (1994), a nostalgic television movie, Culp and Cosby reprised their roles as Robinson and Scott for the first time since 1968. Culp and Cosby reunited one last time on the television show &quot;Cosby&quot; in an episode entitled &quot;My Spy&quot; (1999), in which Cosby&#x27;s character, Hilton Lucas, dreams he is Alexander Scott on a mission with Kelly Robinson. Robert Culp also appeared on &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; as Lyle Pike in the episode &quot;Trust No One&quot; (February 18, 1995). In 1997, he played a CIA agent and the father of Dr. Jesse Travis on &quot;Diagnosis Murder&quot; along with Barbara Bain, Robert Vaughn, and Patrick Macnee.

===Film performances===
Culp worked as an actor in many theatrical films, beginning with three in 1963: As naval officer John F. Kennedy&#x27;s good friend Ensign George Ross in &quot;PT 109&quot;, as legendary gunslinger Wild Bill Hickok in &quot;The Raiders&quot;, and as the debonair fiancé of Jane Fonda in &quot;Sunday in New York&quot;.

He starred in &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot; in 1969, with Natalie Wood. Another memorable role came as another gunslinger, Thomas Luther Price, in &quot;Hannie Caulder&quot; (1971) opposite Raquel Welch. A year later, &quot;Hickey &amp; Boggs&quot; reunited him with Cosby for the first time since &quot;I Spy&quot;. Culp also directed this feature film, in which Cosby and he portray over-the-hill private eyes. In 1986, he had a primary role as General Woods in the comedy &quot;Combat Academy&quot;. Culp played the U.S. President in Alan J. Pakula&#x27;s 1993 murder mystery, &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;.

===Other appearances===
Culp appeared in the 1993 live action video game &quot;Voyeur&quot; as the game&#x27;s villain, industrialist/politician Reed Hawke. He lent his voice to the digital character Dr. Wallace Breen, the prime antagonist in the 2004 computer game &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;. The video clip of &quot;Guilty Conscience&quot; features Culp as an erudite and detached narrator describing the scenes where Eminem and Dr. Dre rap lyrics against each other. He only appears in the music video. In the album version, the narrator is Mark Avery.

On November 9, 2007, on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, host Bill O&#x27;Reilly interviewed Culp about the actor&#x27;s career and awarded Culp with the distinction &quot;TV Icon of the Week&quot;. Culp played Simon, Blanche&#x27;s beau, in the episode &quot;Like the Beep Beep Beep of My Tom Tom&quot; when Blanche needs a pacemaker on &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;.

===Screenwriter===
Culp wrote scripts for seven &quot;I Spy&quot; episodes, one of which he also directed. He later wrote and directed two episodes of &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot;, including the series finale. Culp also wrote scripts for other television series, including &quot;Trackdown&quot;, a two-part episode from &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, and &quot;Cain&#x27;s Hundred&quot;.

==Personal life==
Culp was married five times: to Elayne Carroll (1951–1956), Nancy Ashe (1957–1966), French actress France Nuyen, whom he met when she guest-starred on &quot;I Spy&quot; (1967–1970), Sheila Sullivan (1971–1976), and Candace Faulkner (from 1981).

In addition to appearing in four episodes of &quot;I Spy&quot;, two of them written by Culp, in 1969 Nuyen also co-hosted the second episode of the TV comedy &quot;Turn-On&quot; with him, but the program was never shown, as the series was cancelled after its first airing.

Culp had three sons and a daughter with his second wife, and a daughter with his fifth wife. His son Joseph Culp is an actor and director; his son Jason Culp is a voice actor who has narrated many audiobooks. Culp&#x27;s grandson, Elmo Kennedy O&#x27;Connor, is a rapper and performs under the alias Bones.

==Death==
On March 24, 2010, Culp died at age 79 after a fall while walking near Runyon Canyon Park in Los Angeles. He was buried at Sunset View Cemetery in El Cerrito. A memorial service was held at Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles on April 10, 2010.
At the time of his death, Culp had just completed performing a supporting role as Blakesley in the film &quot;The Assignment&quot;. He was also working on several screenplays, including an adaptation of the story of &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; that had already been accepted for filming and was scheduled to start production in Hong Kong in 2012, with Culp directing. &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; had been Culp&#x27;s favorite comic strip as a boy, and it was his longtime wish to make a film based on it.

<text>Moyez G. Vassanji (born 30 May 1950 in Kenya) is a Canadian novelist and editor, who writes under the name M. G. Vassanji. Vassanji&#x27;s work has been translated into several languages. As of 2020, he has published nine novels, as well as two short-fiction collections and two nonfiction books. Vassanji&#x27;s writings often focus on issues of colonial history, migration, diaspora, citizenship, gender and ethnicity.

==Early life and education==
M. G. Vassanji was born in Kenya to Indian immigrants and raised in Tanganyika (now Tanzania). He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania, where he specialised in nuclear physics, before moving to Canada as a postdoctoral fellow in 1978.

==Career==
From 1980 to 1989 Vassanji was a research associate at the University of Toronto. During this period he developed an interest in medieval Indian literature and history, co-founded and edited a literary magazine (&quot;The Toronto South Asian Review&quot;, later renamed &quot;The Toronto Review of Contemporary Writing Abroad&quot;), and began writing fiction. Between 1989 and 2012, Vassanji published six novels, two collections of short stories, a memoir of his travels in India, and a biography of Mordecai Richler.

In 1989, after the publication of his first novel, &quot;The Gunny Sack&quot;, Vassanji was invited to spend a season at the International Writing Program of the University of Iowa. &quot;The Gunny Sack&quot; won a regional Commonwealth Writers Prize in 1990. He won the inaugural Giller Prize in 1994 for &quot;The Book of Secrets&quot;. That year, he also won the Harbourfront Festival Prize in recognition of his &quot;achievement in and contribution to the world of letters,&quot; and was one of twelve Canadians chosen for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s Magazine&quot;″s Honour Roll. In 1996 he was a Fellow of the Indian Institute of Advanced Study in Shimla, India. 

He again won the Giller Prize in 2003 for &quot;The In-Between World of Vikram Lall&quot;, the first writer to win this prize twice. In 2006, &quot;When She Was Queen&quot; was shortlisted for the City of Toronto Book Award. &quot;The Assassin&#x27;s Song&quot;, released in 2007, was short-listed for the 2007 Giller Prize, the Rogers Prize, and the Governor General&#x27;s Prize in Canada, as well as the Crossword Prize in India. In 2009 his travel memoir, &quot;A Place Within: Rediscovering India&quot;, won the Governor-General&#x27;s Prize for nonfiction. He has also been awarded the Commonwealth Regional Prize (Africa).

His novel &quot;The Magic of Saida&quot;, set in Tanzania, was published in Canada in 2012, and in 2014 he published his memoirs, &quot;Home Was Kariakoo&quot;, based on his childhood and recent travels in East Africa. and in 2016 he published another novel, &quot;Nostalgia&quot;. In 2019, his ninth novel &quot;A Delhi Obsession&quot; was published.

He is a member of the Order of Canada. In 2016, he received the Canada Council Molson Prize for his career achievement.

==Themes==
Vassanji&#x27;s works have been reviewed by literary critics, such as in works edited by 2021 Nobel prize winner Abdulrazak Gurnah. Several themes emerge. Mainly, his characters are the Asians of East Africa (Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania), whose historical record, as of that region as a whole, is sparse. In telling the story of his subjects, in his earlier novels he has used memory, written record, and folklore, in an intersection of oral and written histories. Thus in &quot;The Gunny Sack&quot;, his first novel, he starts with many memories, but his narrator has to delve into written history, primarily through colonial journals and travelogues, to complete and give shape to his created history. His third novel, &quot;The Book of Secrets&quot; starts with the journal of a colonial administrator at the border between German and British East Africa and brings to his creation memories and archival material. In &quot;The In-between World of Vikram Lal&quot;l, he looks at the condition and involvement of the Asians of Kenya during the Mau Mau War of the 1950s. The past and unresolved issues cast strong shadows in his works. In his other works, for example No New Land, his characters have undergone a second migration, starting in the 1970s, to Europe, Canada, or the United States. Vassanji then examines how the lives of these characters are affected by their migrations. Though few of his African Asian characters ever return to India, the country&#x27;s presence looms throughout his work. His 2007 novel &quot;The Assassins Song&quot;, inspired by the devotional, mystical songs of his Khoja Ismaili community, which deeply influenced him in childhood, is set almost entirely in India, where it was received as an Indian novel and short-listed for the Crossword Prize. His second novel, &quot;No New Land,&quot; describes the travails of Asian immigrants arrived in Canada from Tanzania; as the title implies, there is no new land, the characters continue in their minds to lead the same lives. In the dystopic novel &quot;Nostalgia Vassanji&quot; tackles the topic of assimilation, in which characters can have their memories erased and replaced by new ones in order to be better integrated. But, the novel asks, is the process of erasure perfect? 

Vassanji writes about the effects of history and the interaction between personal and public histories, including folk and colonial history. Vassanji&#x27;s narratives follow the personal histories of his main characters; the historical perspective provided often leaves mysteries unsolved. The colonial history of Kenya and Tanzania serves as the backdrop for much of his work; in the &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Song&quot;, however, he tackles Indian folk culture and myths.

<text>A compression release engine brake, compression brake, or decompression brake is an engine braking mechanism installed on some diesel engines. When activated, it opens exhaust valves to the cylinders, right before the compression stroke ends, releasing the compressed gas trapped in the cylinders, and slowing the vehicle.

Clessie Cummins was granted a patent for the engine compression brake in 1965, and the first company to manufacture them was Jacobs Vehicle Systems. 

==Function==
When the driver releases the accelerator on a moving vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine, the vehicle&#x27;s forward momentum continues to turn the engine&#x27;s crankshaft. Most diesel engines do not have a throttle body, so regardless of the throttle setting, air is always drawn into the cylinders (excluding the valve fitted to certain diesels, such as fire appliances and generators on oil and gas platforms, to prevent diesel engine runaway). The fuel-free air mix that is compressed on the compression stroke now starts to act as an air spring. After the piston reaches maximum compression, the compressed air mixture returns its energy to the piston by pushing the piston back down. The result is that even if the fuel supply to the cylinder is stopped, some energy absorbed during the compression stroke is still returned to the crankshaft. Because of this returned energy, there is very little engine braking applied to the vehicle.

The typical compression brake consists of a hydraulic system using engine oil which transfers the motion of the fuel injector rocker arm to the engine&#x27;s exhaust valve(s). When activated, the exhaust valve opens very briefly near the engine&#x27;s top dead center, and releases the compressed air in the cylinder so that the air compression energy is not returned to the crankshaft. A compression release engine brake can assist a vehicle to maintain or even reduce speed with minimal use of friction brakes. The power of this type can be around the same as the engine power.

In contrast, a gasoline engine under deceleration runs with a closed throttle that prevents free flow of air into the cylinders, resulting in little pressure to release at the top of the compression stroke. The closed throttle provides engine braking by forcing the engine to generate a vacuum between the throttle and the cylinders.

Typically, the controls for a compression brake consist of an on/off switch and often a selector that controls the number of cylinders on which the brake is active. Throttle and clutch switches are integral with the system. Activation occurs when both the clutch and the throttle are released with the transmission in gear. It is the driver&#x27;s job to ascertain the correct transmission gear to use, depending on factors such as the steepness of the grade and the vehicle&#x27;s load.

==Limitations==
The use of engine compression brakes may cause a vehicle to make a loud &quot;growling&quot;, &quot;machine gun&quot;, or &quot;jackhammer&quot; like exhaust noise, especially vehicles having no mufflers, which has led many communities in the United States, Canada, and Australia to prohibit compression braking within municipal limits. Drivers are notified by roadside signs with text such as &quot;Brake Retarders Prohibited,&quot; &quot;No Engine Brake,&quot; &quot;No Jake Brakes,&quot; &quot;Compression Braking Prohibited,&quot; or &quot;Unmuffled Engine Braking Prohibited,&quot; and enforcement is typically through traffic fines. Such prohibitions have led to the development of new types of mufflers and turbochargers to better silence braking noise.

Jacobs claims that the use of the term &quot;Jake Brake&quot; on signs prohibiting engine retarding brakes violates their trademark and discriminates against Jacobs-brand products.

In the U.S. state of Ohio, state law allows a board of county commissioners or township trustees to prohibit the use of compression brakes within unincorporated areas. These local regulations apply to all state- and locally-maintained roads except Interstate highways. The state&#x27;s standard &quot;No Engine Brake&quot; sign is designed to avoid discriminating against the Jacobs brand name.

<doc id="886693" wikidata="Q316864" url="?curid=886693" title="Vladislav Tretiak">
<text>Vladislav Aleksandrovich Tretiak (; born 25 April 1952) is a Russian former goaltender for the Soviet Union national ice hockey team. He was inducted into the inaugural class of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Hall of Fame in 1997. Considered to be one of the greatest goaltenders in the history of the sport, he was voted one of six players to the IIHF Centennial All-Star Team in a poll conducted by a group of 56 experts from 16 countries. Tretiak is the current president of the Ice Hockey Federation of Russia and was the general manager of the Russian 2010 Winter Olympic team.

== Early years ==
Tretiak grew up in the USSR. His parents are from Dmitrovsky District. His father served 37 years as a military pilot, and his mother was a physical education teacher. Although he initially followed his brother as a swimmer, as a child Tretiak excelled at many sports, and is remembered for his ambition to master all of them. However, like many children of his generation, he loved hockey, and at age 11 entered the Children and Youth Sports School of the Central Sports Club of the Army (known by its abbreviation CSKA). His first trainer was Mike Jaure. He began playing goaltender when he saw that no one else had the desire or courage to play the position.

== International playing career ==

Although Tretiak did not play his first hockey game until the age of eleven (1963), he was well known in the USSR by 1971 (aged 19), when he was named to the Soviet Ice Hockey League&#x27;s First All-Star Team, while playing for the powerhouse Red Army team, CSKA Moscow. He also played well in the 1972 Winter Olympics, in which the Soviets took the gold medal.

Tretiak became internationally famous after his outstanding performance in the Summit Series in 1972, when he helped surprise the world, including the Canadian team, en route to a narrow loss to the Canadians. A famous story was told of how Canadian scouts seriously underestimated his goaltending ability prior to the series; they witnessed him let in eight goals on a particular night, not knowing that he had been married the previous evening (and most of the team had been in attendance). Of the entire Soviet roster, Canadian players and fans held Tretiak in the highest regard and respect and Tretiak was one of the most famous players of the Series along with Phil Esposito, Paul Henderson, Alexandr Iakushev and Valeri Kharlamov. As a result of Tretiak&#x27;s stellar performance, many NHL teams wanted to draft him – Montreal ultimately did, in 1983 – and Tretiak was willing, but the Soviet government did not let him leave.

During the 1976 Super Series, Tretiak put on a dominant performance against the Montreal Canadiens, holding them to a 3–3 tie despite his team being outshot 38–13.

Tretiak went on to star for the Soviet Union, helping them win gold medals in the 1976 Winter Olympics, and again in the 1984 Winter Olympics and the 1981 Canada Cup. Tretiak also back-stopped the Soviets to ten IIHF World Championships victories and nine in the IIHF European Championships.

In the 1980 Winter Olympics, a USSR team loss to team USA in a medal round game denied Tretiak a chance at another gold. The Soviet team won silver, as they had the second-highest number of points in the tournament..

Though he was only 32 in 1984 and still capable of playing top-level hockey, Tretiak retired. It is said that he wanted to spend more time with his family and asked the national team coach Viktor Tikhonov for a training regime, in which he could live at home and come to the training camp before games. Since the rest of the team spent most of their time away from home in the training camp, Tikhonov refused. This move by Tikhonov contributed to Tretiak&#x27;s decision to retire.

== Post retirement ==
Tretiak was one of the guests who spoke at the ceremony during which the Montreal Canadiens retired the jersey number of Ken Dryden on 29 January 2007. Dryden had been one of Team Canada&#x27;s goaltenders during the 1972 Summit Series, opposite Tretiak.

Tretiak retired in 1984, following a 2–0 victory over Czechoslovakia. He was awarded Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1984). In 1987 Tretiak wrote an autobiography, &quot;Tretiak, The Legend&quot;. He was named to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1989, the first Soviet player to be honored.

In 1990, Mike Keenan hired Tretiak as a goaltender coach for the Chicago Blackhawks, which allowed him to coach goaltenders including Ed Belfour, Dominik Hašek, and Jocelyn Thibault. Keenan was so impressed with Tretiak&#x27;s abilities in practice that he suggested the 38-year-old might still be able to play in the NHL. Tretiak said that coaching was the next best thing to playing in the NHL. After leaving the Blackhawks, Belfour wore uniform number 20 as a tribute to Tretiak. Numerous other goalies, including Evgeni Nabokov, also wore number 20 as a tribute to Tretiak.

In 2000, he was voted &#x27;Best Russian Hockey Player&#x27; of the 20th century. He was a vital cog for some of the most dominant hockey teams in history and is now considered one of hockey&#x27;s greatest ambassadors.

Tretiak was elected to the State Duma as a member of the United Russia party in December 2003, representing the Saratov constituency. He is chairman of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sport, and Youth.

He continued to work for the Chicago Blackhawks until the start of 2006–07 season. On 25 April 2006, his 54th birthday, Tretiak was elected head of the Russian Ice Hockey Federation. He obtained 93 out of the possible 96 votes, with the remaining three voters abstaining. A few days later, on 28 April, the Governor General of Canada, Michaëlle Jean, awarded Tretiak the Meritorious Service Medal in a ceremony at Rideau Hall. Tretiak earned the award for, among other things, his founding of the Friends of Canada organization to foster good relations between Canada and Russia. He was the first Russian to be conferred this honor.

He also ran a goalie school at the Canlan Ice Sports in Toronto, Ontario. Called the Vladislav Tretiak Elite School of Goaltending, it was considered one of the most physically punishing goaltending schools in the world, and students could be refused admittance if not in top physical condition. He also ran a goalie school in Montreal during the 1990s where he trained many famous NHL goaltenders including Jose Theodore and Martin Brodeur. Tretiak also ran a goalie hockey camp in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota in the early 2000s.

On 28 March 2007, Tretiak went to Ottawa to discuss with Canadian officials the possibilities of holding another Summit Series during the summer of 2007, which would be 35 years after the initial event. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov had also discussed with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper about the possibilities of holding another event. In the end, a series was held in September 2007 between the national junior teams of Canada and Russia.

On 21 December 2012, he voted in favor of the &quot;Dima Yakovlev Law&quot; in the State Duma. This legislation bars the adoption of Russian children by U.S. citizens. The legislation was the response to the Magnitsky bill, whose purpose was punishing Russian officials responsible for the death of Russian tax lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow prison in 2009 and also to grant permanent normal trade relations status to Russia.

Tretiak was the final torchbearer in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia and lit the Olympic Flame during the opening ceremony along with Irina Rodnina.

==Personal==
Tretiak married his wife Tatiana (born 1950) on 23 August 1972, six weeks after they met. Their first son, Dmitri, was born the following year and their daughter, Irina, was born 3 years later. Tatiana is qualified as a Russian literature teacher, although she no longer works. Tretiak is a devout Russian Orthodox Christian.

Tretiak was sanctioned financially by the United Kingdom government in 2022, in relation to the Russo-Ukrainian War. Canada also implemented sanctions in 2024.

<text>PT 109 is a 1963 American Technicolor Panavision biographical war film depicting the actions of John F. Kennedy as an officer of the United States Navy in command of Motor Torpedo Boat &quot;PT-109&quot; in the Pacific theater of World War II. The film was adapted by Vincent Flaherty and Howard Sheehan from the book &quot;PT 109: John F. Kennedy in World War II&quot; by Robert J. Donovan, and the screenplay was written by Richard L. Breen. Cliff Robertson stars as Kennedy, and the film features performances by Ty Hardin, James Gregory, Robert Culp and Grant Williams.

&quot;PT 109&quot; was the first commercial theatrical film about a sitting U.S. president released while he was still in office (although FDR was often depicted in small roles during his administration, most notably in &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;). It was released domestically on June 19, 1963, five months before Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas.

==Plot==
In August 1942 the American forces are fighting the Japanese in the South Pacific during World War II. Fresh out of PT boat training school in Melville, Rhode Island, U.S. Navy Lieutenant, junior grade John F. Kennedy used his wealthy and powerful family&#x27;s influence to get himself assigned to the fighting in the Solomon Islands, a hotbed in the Pacific Theater.

Once there he lobbies for command and is given the well worn &quot;PT 109&quot;. Initially, Tulagi&#x27;s irascible boat maintenance officer Commander C. R. Ritchie is unimpressed with the young, untested Kennedy, but the lieutenant is undaunted. With a hodge-podge crew anchored by Ensign Leonard J. Thom as executive officer and initially skeptical sailors &quot;Bucky&quot; Harris and Edmund Drewitch he gets the 109 seaworthy again.

Without enough fuel for the return trip, the &quot;PT 109&quot; is dispatched on an emergency mission to evacuate paramarines pinned down on a distant beach after disrupting the Japanese in the Raid on Choiseul. Under heavy fire Kennedy rescues the survivors, but barely gets out of range before his engines run out of fuel. Drawn shoreward by an incoming tide, the boat and its passengers are saved from disaster when a tow arrives just in time.

The &quot;109&quot; is then relocated to a base on Rendova. While on patrol one dark, moonless night in August 1943, the radar-less boat is throttled down and searching for a Japanese convoy returning from a supply mission via &quot;The Slot&quot;. Out of nowhere an Imperial Navy destroyer appears, and before Kennedy can react the &quot;PT 109&quot; is rammed and sliced in half, killing two of her 13 crewmen.

Towing a badly burned crew member by a life jacket strap clenched in his teeth, Kennedy leads the survivors to Plum Pudding Island. The next day the abandoned wreckage is spotted by a reconnaissance plane, and the &quot;109&quot;&#x27;s crew is presumed lost with all hands. After dark, Kennedy swims out into the channel with a signal lantern, staying out all night in the hope of flagging down a passing U.S. vessel. The next night, he sends out a friend who tagged along on the mission, Ensign George Ross.

After several fruitless days morale drops and Kennedy is forced to quell an uprising determined to surrender. Hoping for better prospects of food and water on a nearby island, he leads the crew on another three-mile swim. There two rifle-armed natives show up in a canoe and hold the men at gunpoint, confused as to their identity and affiliation. As the pair do not understand English but appear receptive, Kennedy carves a message on a coconut requesting rescue and gives it to them. They take it to Australian coastwatcher Lieutenant Reginald Evans. Evans notifies the U.S. Navy, and the men are rescued by PT boat without any further loss of life.

As a result of their ordeal Kennedy and his men are eligible for leave back in the U.S., but he and several loyal crewmembers elect to stay and continue the fight on a new combat-weathered boat.

==Production==
Kennedy&#x27;s father, Joseph Kennedy Sr., had been the U.S. ambassador to Great Britain at the onset of World War II, as well as an influential Hollywood producer and former head of RKO studio. He negotiated the film rights to Donovan&#x27;s 1961 biography of his son. The film was made under the &quot;personal supervision&quot; of Warner&#x27;s head of production, Jack L. Warner. The White House sent former PT boat commander Alvin Cluster, a wartime buddy of President Kennedy and his former commanding officer, to act as a liaison between Warner Bros. and the White House.

Among other actors considered for the lead were Peter Fonda, who objected to having to deliver his screen test using an impersonation of Kennedy&#x27;s voice; Warren Beatty (Jacqueline Kennedy&#x27;s choice); Jeffrey Hunter, who had just finished playing Jesus Christ in &quot;King of Kings&quot;; and Warner Bros Television contract stars Edd Byrnes, Peter Brown, Chad Everett and Roger Smith. Kennedy set three conditions on the film: that it be historically accurate, that profits go to the survivors of the &quot;PT 109&quot; and their families, and that he would have the final choice of lead actor. He selected and then met with Robertson after viewing the screen tests.

Though Robertson was stockier and 13 years older than Kennedy had been in the South Pacific, having served in the Merchant Marine as a third mate during World War II, he was chosen because (as Alvin Cluster told him), &quot;The President picked you not only because you were a fine actor but because you&#x27;re young looking, yet mature enough so that the world won&#x27;t get the idea the President was being played by a parking lot attendant or something.&quot; This was a reference to Edd Byrnes, who played &quot;Kookie&quot; in that role on the then hit television series 77 Sunset Strip.

Kennedy also vetoed Raoul Walsh as director after screening and panning Walsh&#x27;s &quot;Marines Let&#x27;s Go&quot;. Original director Lewis Milestone, who had previously filmed &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, &quot;A Walk in the Sun&quot; and &quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot;, left the production, either because Milestone thought that the script was inadequate or because the studio was unhappy with cost overruns. Milestone was replaced by Leslie Martinson, a television director with little experience making films.

The exteriors were filmed at Little Palm Island (formerly Little Munson Island), now a resort in the Florida Keys. Power and fresh water were run out to the island for the film, allowing the resort to be built years later. The construction of the sets and the presence of boats and other paraphernalia during filming gave rise to rumors of another U.S. invasion of Cuba.

Australian actor Michael Pate played a real Australian coastwatcher who helped save Kennedy.

At the time the film was being planned it was found that the few surviving 80-foot Elco PT boats were not in operational condition. Though a further search was conducted it was determined that none could be located for use in the film, as almost all had been destroyed in-Theatre at the end of World War II. Former World War II-era United States Army Air Forces 85-foot crash rescue boats were converted to resemble Elco PT boats. These were designed by Dair N. Long in 1944, and their use as movie props was ideal because they possessed performance and profiles similar to the Elcos. American AT-6 Texan training planes stood in for Japanese Zeros.

U.S. Navy support included the destroyer USS &quot;Saufley&quot;, the landing ship USS Duval County and smaller vessels, such as landing craft and motor whaleboats from nearby Naval Station Key West.

After seeing the film, Kennedy called &quot;PT 109&quot; a &quot;good product,&quot; but worried about the two hour, 20-minute length. &quot;It&#x27;s just a question of whether there&#x27;s too much of it.&quot;

==Accuracy==
In the film the &quot;PT 109&quot; and all other PT boats are painted in the same standard gray paint scheme used by larger warships of the U.S. Navy. Although many Higgins and Elco PT boats were likely delivered from the manufacturer (to be shipped upon oceangoing navy cargo vessels) with such a paint scheme, historical records indicate that &quot;PT 109&quot; and the other boats in its squadron were painted dark green once in the Solomons in order to better blend into jungle backdrops at forward operating bases.

The film also depicts &quot;PT 109&quot; as reported missing and a search is started. According to &quot;National Geographic&quot; and the original book, though the boat explosion was observed from other PT boats in the vicinity and the vessel was given up as lost, at least an air reconnaissance was later conducted. When it was unsuccessful, a memorial service was held at the motor torpedo boat squadron&#x27;s forward operating base at Rendova while the crew was still marooned on the islands in the vicinity of Japanese-held Kolombagara Island.

Solomon Islanders Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana are portrayed as random natives, when in fact they were dispatched by the coastwatcher, Reg Evans, to find the sailors. The film shows Ensign Ross first suggesting the idea of using a coconut for a message, using a knife to carve it. Gasa later claimed to have suggested the idea and to have sent Kumana to pluck a fresh coconut. The actors playing Gasa and Kumana were not credited, though the senior native is mentioned by name when the large canoe arrives.

The scene showing the rescue of ambushed Marines actually occurred after the sinking of the &quot;PT 109&quot;, when Kennedy had been given command of &quot;PT 59&quot;. It was an older model 77-foot Elco PT boat that had had its torpedo launchers removed and was reconfigured into a heavily armed gunboat at Kennedy&#x27;s request, as U.S. Navy Mark 8 torpedoes of that era were notoriously inaccurate and Kennedy had already provisionally mounted a .37 mm antitank gun on the bow of the &quot;109&quot; before its loss. It was the &quot;59&quot;&#x27;s exceptional firepower that allowed it to be successful in its rescue of Marines pinned down in close quarters on Choiseul.

==Reception==
&quot;PT 109&quot; was released to lukewarm critical response, although Robertson received good reviews. , Rotten Tomatoes rates the film at 64% approval. One review comments that &quot;One of the screenplay&#x27;s pluses ... is its concentration on the minor but still deadly activities that were undertaken by thousands of men during World War II. Not everyone was involved with the major assaults; many spent their time risking their lives in places and situations of which most people are totally unaware, and it&#x27;s a nice change of pace to see this aspect of the war dramatized.&quot;

During its initial run, prior to Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, a theater marquee in Georgia showing the film declared &quot;See how the Japs almost got Kennedy.&quot;

The film earned theatrical rentals of $2.7 million in the United States and Canada before it was withdrawn following Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. They estimated it would go on to earn $3.5 million.

==Canadian release==
In some Canadian cities, such as Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, &quot;PT 109&quot; premiered in theaters on November 22, 1963, the day that Kennedy was assassinated.

==Home media==
Warner Home Video released the film on VHS on February 9, 1983, as part of its &quot;A Night At the Movies&quot; series, featuring a Hearst Metrotone Newsreel, a Warner Bros. animated short and a coming-attractions trailer of films from 1963. Warner Archives released the film on DVD in the United States on May 10, 2011.

The film has occasionally aired on Turner Classic Movies and has also periodically aired in letterbox format on the Military Channel in the United States.

According to Oliver Stone during a 2013 interview with Nerdist, &quot;PT 109&quot; would be included in his &quot;Untold History&quot; documentary miniseries box set.

<text>Alpha Street productions and later Alpha Sports Productions (ASP) were an Australian kit car and racing car manufacturer. It has made sports cars and open wheeler cars. Originally building cars based on the Lotus Seven but have evolved to construct their own distinctive designs.

== History ==
Alpha street productions was founded by Ray Lewis and Rory Thompson in the early sixties after the two had met through a common interest in sportscars. Ray, the part owner of Lewis Brothers Buses amongst other businesses provided the premises for their venture at his family home of Alpha house on Alpha Street Kensington Park in Adelaide. Rory however provided the technical knowledge after earning qualifications in mechanical engineering from the South Australian Institute of Technology.

Working initially on a Lotus 7 for Derek Jolly Rory decided certain deficiencies of the Lotus design could be overcome with the design of a new chassis. This first attempt at an entire car was named the Bacchus after the Greek god of wine. The first of the chassis was sold bare but further cars were built with a variety of drivetrains fitted.

After Ray returned from an overseas trip work began on what was now the Mk4 Bacchus Clubman. This car was renamed twice though, first from Bacchus to Shrike and then from Shrike to ASP, the company&#x27;s initials. This first road car was known as the ASP 320A and was the only one of its type built. This car was sold to Paul Hannon who worked for the Savings Bank of South Australia and had spent time at the ASP premises when he was younger. The connection to the bank led the car to being used in an advertising campaign, driving sales of what was now the B spec of the new ASP Clubman.

Starting with the ASP 320B ASP started to build a car specifically for racing with four 320B&#x27;s produced for this purpose, although most have found their way onto road registration since. From these 320B Clubmans came a short wheelbase version renamed the 340A. this was the beginning of a series of racing Clubmans. This first car known also as the Potts lightweight was owned by Doug Potts was powered by a Galant motor and was later converted to a road car by ASP employee Colin Reilly.

At about this time, 1971, ASP branched out into open wheeler formula cars with Formula 2 and 3 cars, the ASP 330. Four of these cars were built in period, three racing in Formula 3 and one in Formula 2. After this ASP returned exclusively to Clubman-style sports cars.

In 1972 two 340B cars were produced of a completely new design. One of these cars, Chassis 23 was built for Jim Doig who was still racing the car in 2021 and despite a large crash at The Bend in South Australia is intending to fix the car and have it back on track in 2022 for the cars 50th year. This design was followed closely by the 340C built from 1972 to 73. Six of these cars were built and all but one seem to have survived the intervening years.

These cars followed the Clubman Formula of the day: single camshaft engine of no more than 1.3 litres capacity, front engine two seat racing cars. All were powered by either the Toyota Corolla 3K or Datsun A12 engine and ran a differential from a Morris. These highly effective sports cars were affordable and quick, able to embarrass much more powerful sports cars and smaller formula type cars regularly.

By 1974 it had become clear that the company&#x27;s finances were not as they should be, and a series of issues caused Ray to decide to wind the company up with Ray and Rory going their separate ways. However, after building some new road going ASP Clubmans in his spare time Rory decided to start a new business Alpha Sports Productions to build new models of the ASP 320. These were built by their owners under the supervision of Rory at his premises in Salisbury and not only resulted in a car, but the learning of all the skills to build the car being acquired by the owner. The final cars were known as the ASP 320G and were generally powered by 4AGE engines from a Toyota with some later owners moving to Mazda engines.

Ray Lewis died in November 2005. His previous years had been affected by an adverse reaction to prescription medication changing his personality. He was however still involved with the design of ASP cars, helping to design the Targa-style rollbar seen on the later cars. Rory Thompson followed him in 2020 bringing production of ASP sportscars to an end at least with one of the original founders at the helm.

== Models ==

=== Bacchus ===
The Bacchus represented the first original car from the Alpha Street factory. Named after the Greek god of wine these Lotus 7 inspired Clubman cars were powered by a variety of engines with a total of six cars completed under this name.

=== ASP 320 ===
The ASP 320 was born out of the previous Bacchus series of cars. Initially referred to as the Bacchus Mk 4 the car was renamed twice, once as the Shrike and then the ASP 320A. 320s continued to be made right up until the end of the company making it all the way to a G spec car with modern running gear in the traditional ASP 320 bodywork.

=== ASP 330 ===
The ASP 330 represented a change in ASP by branching out into open wheeler formula cars. Four cars were built in period, three Formula 3&#x27;s and one Formula 2.

=== ASP 340 ===

==== 340A ====
The 340A, otherwise known as the Potts lightweight, was based on a 320B race chassis but shortened and lightened. campaigned by Doug Potts in period this car was later converted to road spec by ASP employee Colin Reilly.

==== 340B ====

The new for 1972 340B was a new dedicated race chassis very different from its predecessors from the Alpha Street factory. Two cars of this type were produced original owners and chassis numbers are as follows.

* #23 J Doig: Toyota Celica 1600 
* #24 D Wallace: Ford 1500

Chassis #23 still owned and driven by Jim Doig in particular is a well known car in its native South Australia and beyond having been in almost constant use since new with well over 1000 races to date. Chassis #24 however has since been converted to road use. 

==== 340C ====

The 340C further developed the ideas introduced in the 340B in a dedicated lightweight racing chassis. In all six cars were built all to Clubman sports 1300 regulations with 1300cc engines. the original owners, car chassis numbers and engines are as follows

* #29 Alby Middleton: Datsun A12 
* #30 David Mc Bean: Toyota 3K 
* #31 David Walsh: Toyota 3K 
* #32 Ken Durward: Datsun A12 
* #33 John Blanden: Datsun A12 
* #34 Jim Bidstrup: Toyota 3K

These cars were built using 19x1.2 square steel tube nickel bronze welded to create a very light dedicated racing chassis with a short wheelbase. Front suspension was by unequal length non-parallel wishbones with externally mounted coilover shock absorbers. The rear suspension used a Morris live axle located by an A frame at the bottom which provided both fore-and-aft and lateral location while two short arms were used at the top. More than one car was later updated in period to longer wheelbase and four long arms and a Panhard rod for rear axle location.

=== ASP 350 ===
The ASP 350 was an attempt at building a new design of sports car by Rory Thompson based on readily available running gear. this car featured Holden commodore engine and drivetrain.

<text>Lawrence Joseph Doyle (July 31, 1886 – March 1, 1974), nicknamed &quot;Laughing Larry&quot;, was an American second baseman in Major League Baseball from 1907 to 1920 who played almost his entire career for the New York Giants. The National League&#x27;s outstanding second baseman during the 1910s, he was awarded the Chalmers Award as the league&#x27;s best player, and won the batting title with a .320 average. The team captain and top everyday star on three consecutive pennant winners (1911–1913), his .408 career slugging average was the top mark by an NL second baseman when he retired, as were his career totals in hits (1887), doubles (299), triples (123), total bases (2654) and extra base hits (496). He ended his career among the major league leaders in career games (5th, 1730), putouts (9th, 3635), assists (9th, 4654), total chances (9th, 8732) and double plays (5th, 694) at second base, and set Giants franchise records for career games, at bats and doubles, each of which was broken by Bill Terry.

==Biography==
Doyle was a third baseman in the minor leagues before his contract was purchased by the Giants for a then-record $4,500. He debuted with the Giants on July 22, , arriving late after taking the wrong boat across the Hudson River; he cost his team the game with a ninth-inning error, though he also had a pair of hits. He expected to be returned to the minor leagues; instead, he was retained by manager John McGraw, who named him the team&#x27;s field captain in 1908 – a year in which he finished third in the batting race with a .308 average. Doyle, who also became the roommate of Christy Mathewson for several years, followed up with a season in which he led the NL in hits (172) and was among the league&#x27;s top four players in batting (.302), slugging (.419), home runs (6) and total bases (239). 1910 saw a slight dropoff, though he was still third in the NL in home runs (8) and fourth in runs scored (97). He then entered the strongest part of his career; in he finished third in the voting for the initial Chalmers Award after hitting .310 and finishing second in the league with a .527 slugging average – the highest by an NL second baseman since Ross Barnes slugged .590 in the league&#x27;s inaugural 1876 campaign. Doyle also led the league with 25 triples, the most by an NL player since 1899; it remains the highest total by a Giant since 1900. He stole 30 bases for the third consecutive year, and finished fourth in the league in home runs (13) and fifth in runs (102). In the 1911 World Series against the Philadelphia Athletics, he batted .304; with the Giants facing elimination in Game 5, he went 4 for 5, doubling and scoring an intensely disputed run in the 10th inning for a 4–3 victory. He again doubled and scored for a 1–0 lead in the first inning of Game 6, but the Giants lost the game 13–2, and with it the Series.
Doyle then had a 1912 season which was perhaps even better, winning the Chalmers Award after hitting a career-high .330 as the Giants repeated as NL champions. In the 1912 World Series against the Boston Red Sox he only hit .242, though he scored the first run in a Game 6 victory and was 3 for 4 with a home run in an 11–4 rout in Game 7. But he was 0 for 5 in Game 8 as the Red Sox won 3–2 in ten innings, after New York took a 2–1 lead in the top of the 10th, to capture the title. In 1913 the Giants won their third straight pennant; although he batted only .280, he stole 30 bases for the fifth year in a row and was eighth in the NL with 73 runs batted in. That year, he became the first player to hit a home run out of the Polo Grounds. He had an even more dismal 1913 World Series, hitting only .150 against the Athletics as the Giants lost in five games, though he did drive in the first run of the Series. In he slipped to a .260 average, but was fourth in the league in runs. On July 17, he hit a home run in the top of the 21st inning to defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates 3–1.

He enjoyed renewed success in 1915, however, winning the batting crown with a .320 average; it was the first title won by an NL second baseman since Barnes in 1876. He also led the league in hits (189) for the second time, and in doubles with 40 – a Giants franchise record until George Kelly hit 42 in . Doyle was also second in the NL in runs (86) and fifth in slugging (.442). He began 1916 with a .278 average before being traded to the Chicago Cubs in late August, a painful move for the fiercely loyal player who had famously said in 1911 that it was &quot;great to be young and a Giant.&quot; After hitting .395 for the Cubs in nine games that year, he batted .254 for the team in 1917, finishing fourth in the league with 6 home runs, before a pair of January 1918 trades brought him back to New York. He hit .261 in his return to the Giants before having his last outstanding season in 1919; that year he again was league runner-up in slugging with a .433 average, and was fifth in home runs (7). He batted .285 in his final season in , and was granted his release so he could manage the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. At the time, he was within five games of Johnny Evers&#x27; league record for career games at second base.

Doyle ended his career with a .290 batting average, putting him behind only Nap Lajoie (.338), Eddie Collins (then at .329) and Cupid Childs (.306) among players with 1000 games at second base. His 74 home runs placed him third at his position behind Fred Pfeffer (94) and Lajoie (83). He also had 960 runs and 794 RBI in 1766 games, as well as 298 stolen bases including 17 steals of home plate; he held the Giants club record for career steals from 1918 to 1919, when teammate George Burns passed him. &quot;Baseball Magazine&quot; selected Doyle as the second baseman on their NL All-America Team in 1911 and 1915.

Doyle contracted tuberculosis in 1942, and entered the Trudeau Sanitorium in Saranac Lake, New York. When the institution closed in 1954 due to the development of an effective antibiotic treatment, he was the last resident to leave; &quot;Life Magazine&quot; photographers covered his last meal and his departure, on foot, from the grounds. He stayed on in Saranac Lake, and died there 20 years later, at age 87.

<doc id="886722" wikidata="Q1888734" url="?curid=886722" title="Transcoding">
<text>Transcoding is the direct digital-to-digital conversion of one encoding to another, such as for video data files, audio files (e.g., MP3, WAV), or character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO/IEC 8859). This is usually done in cases where a target device (or workflow) does not support the format or has limited storage capacity that mandates a reduced file size, or to convert incompatible or obsolete data to a better-supported or modern format.

In the analog video world, transcoding can be performed just while files are being searched, as well as for presentation. For example, Cineon and DPX files have been widely used as a common format for digital cinema, but the data size of a two-hour movie is about 8 terabytes (TB). That large size can increase the cost and difficulty of handling movie files. However, transcoding into a JPEG2000 lossless format has better compression performance than other lossless coding technologies, and in many cases, JPEG2000 can compress images to half-size.

Transcoding is commonly a lossy process, introducing generation loss; however, transcoding can be lossless if the output is either losslessly compressed or uncompressed. The process of transcoding into a lossy format introduces varying degrees of generation loss, while the transcoding from lossy to lossless or uncompressed is technically a lossless conversion because no information is lost; however, when the conversion is irreversible, it is then more correctly known as &quot;destructive&quot;.

==Process==
Transcoding is a two-step process in which the original data is decoded to an intermediate uncompressed format (e.g., PCM for audio; YUV for video), which is then encoded into the target format.

==Re-encoding/recoding ==
One may also re-encode data in the same format, for a number of reasons:

; Editing
: If one wishes to edit data in a compressed format (for instance, perform image editing on a JPEG image), one will generally decode it, edit it, then re-encode it. This re-encoding causes digital generation loss; thus if one wishes to edit a file repeatedly, one should only decode it &quot;once&quot;, and make all edits on that copy, rather than repeatedly re-encoding it. Similarly, if encoding to a lossy format is required, it should be deferred until the data is finalised, e.g. after mastering.
; Lower bitrate
: Transrating is a process similar to transcoding in which files are coded to a lower bitrate without changing video formats; this can include sample rate conversion, but may use an identical sampling rate with higher compression. This allows one to fit given media into smaller storage space (for instance, fitting a DVD onto a Video CD), or over a lower bandwidth channel.
; Image scaling
: Changing the picture size of video is known as transsizing, and is used if the output resolution differs from the resolution of the media. On a powerful enough device, image scaling can be done on playback, but it can also be done by re-encoding, particularly as part of transrating (such as a downsampled image requiring a lower bitrate).

One can also use formats with bitrate peeling, that allow one to easily lower the bitrate without re-encoding, but quality is often lower than a re-encode. For example, in Vorbis bitrate peeling as of 2008, the quality is inferior to re-encoding.

==Drawbacks==
The key drawback of transcoding in lossy formats is decreased quality. Compression artifacts are cumulative, so transcoding causes a progressive loss of quality with each successive generation, known as digital generation loss. For this reason, transcoding (in lossy formats) is generally discouraged unless unavoidable.

For users wanting to be able to re-encode audio into any format, and for digital audio editing, it is best to retain a master copy in a lossless format (such as FLAC, ALAC, TTA, WavPack, and others) that take around half the storage space needed when compared to original uncompressed PCM formats (such as WAV, and AIFF), as lossless formats usually have the added benefit of having meta data options, which are either completely missing or very limited in PCM formats. These lossless formats can be transcoded to PCM formats or transcoded directly from one lossless format to another lossless format, without any loss in quality. They can be transcoded into a lossy format, but these copies will then not be able to be transcoded into another format of any kind (PCM, lossless, or lossy) without a subsequent loss of quality.

For image editing users are advised to capture or save images in a raw or uncompressed format, and then edit a copy of that master version, only converting to lossy formats if smaller file sized images are needed for final distribution. As with audio, transcoding from lossy format to another format of any type will result in a loss of quality.

For video editing, (for video converting), images are normally compressed directly during the recording process due to the huge file sizes that would be created if they were not, and because the huge storage demands being too cumbersome for the user otherwise. However, the amount of compression used at the recording stage can be highly variable, and is dependent on a number of factors, including the quality of images being recorded (e.g. analog or digital, standard def. or high def., etc.), and type of equipment available to the user, which is often related to budget constraints – as highest quality digital video equipment, and storage space, may be expensive. Effectively this means that any transcoding will involve some cumulative image loss, and hence the most practical solution insofar as minimizing loss of quality is for the original recording to be deemed the master copy, and for desired subsequent transcoded versions, which will often be in a different format and smaller file size, to be transcoded only from that master copy.

==Usage==
Although transcoding can be found in many areas of content adaptation, it is commonly used in the area of mobile phone content adaptation. In this case, transcoding is a must, due to the diversity of mobile devices and their capabilities. This diversity requires an intermediate state of content adaptation in order to make sure that the source content will adequately function on the target device to which it is sent.

Transcoding video from most consumer digital cameras can reduce the file size significantly while keeping the quality about the same. This is possible because most consumer cameras are real-time, power-constrained devices having neither the processing power nor the robust power supplies of desktop CPUs.

One of the most popular technologies in which transcoding is used is the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), which is the technology used to send or receive messages with media (image, sound, text and video) between mobile phones. For example, when a camera phone is used to take a digital picture, a high-quality image of usually at least 640x480 pixels is created. When sending the image to another phone, this high resolution image might be transcoded to a lower resolution image with fewer colors in order to better fit the target device&#x27;s screen size and color limitations. This size and color reduction improves the user experience on the target device, and is sometimes the only way for content to be sent between different mobile devices.

Transcoding is extensively used by home theatre PC software to reduce the usage of disk space by video files. The most common operation in this application is the transcoding of MPEG-2 files to the MPEG-4 or H.264 format.

Real-time transcoding in a many-to-many way (any input format to any output format) is becoming a necessity to provide true search capability for any multimedia content on any mobile device, with over 500 million videos on the web and a plethora of mobile devices.

==History==
Before the advent of semiconductors and integrated circuits, realtime resolution and frame rate transcoding between different analog video standards was achieved by a CRT/camera tube combination. The CRT part does not write onto a phosphor, but onto a thin, dielectric target; the camera part reads the deposited charge pattern at a different scan rate from the back side of this target. The setup could also be used as a genlock.

<text>Lydia Estes Pinkham (born Estes; February 9, 1819 – May 17, 1883) was an American inventor and marketer of a herbal-alcoholic &quot;women&#x27;s tonic&quot; for menstrual and menopausal problems, which medical experts dismissed as a quack remedy, but which is still on sale today in a modified form.
It was the aggressive marketing of Pinkham&#x27;s Vegetable Compound that raised its profile, while also rallying the skeptics. Long, promotional copy would dramatize &quot;women&#x27;s weakness&quot;, &quot;hysteria&quot;, and other themes commonly referenced at the time. Pinkham urged women to write to her personally, and she would maintain the correspondence in order to expose the customer to more persuasive claims for the remedy. Clearly the replies were not all written by Pinkham herself, as they continued after her death.

Pinkham and her &quot;medicinal compound&quot; for feminine disorders became the subject of a bawdy drinking song, &quot;Lily the Pink&quot;, of which a sanitized version became a number one hit by The Scaffold in the United Kingdom.

==Biography==
Pinkham was born in the manufacturing city of Lynn, Massachusetts, the tenth of the twelve children of William and Rebecca Estes. The Estes were an old Quaker family tracing their ancestry to one William Estes, a Quaker who migrated to America in 1676, and through him to the thirteenth-century Italian House of Este. William Estes was originally a shoemaker but by the time Lydia was born in 1819, he had become wealthy through dealing in real estate and had risen to the status of &quot;gentleman farmer&quot;. Pinkham was educated at Lynn Academy and worked as a schoolteacher before her marriage in September 1843.

The Estes were a strongly abolitionist and anti-segregation family. The fugitive slave and abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass was a neighbor and a family friend. The Estes&#x27; household was a gathering place for local and visiting abolitionist leaders such as William Lloyd Garrison. The Estes broke from the Quakers over the slavery issue in the 1830s. Pinkham joined the Lynn Female Anti-slavery Society when she was sixteen. In the controversies which divided the abolitionist movement during the 1840s, Pinkham would support the feminist and moral persuasion positions of Nathaniel P. Rogers. Her children would continue in the anti-slavery tradition.

Isaac Pinkham was a 29-year-old shoe manufacturer when he married Lydia in 1843. He would try various businesses without much success, including real estate. Lydia gave birth to their first child, Charles Hacker Pinkham, in 1844. She lost their second child to gastroenteritis, but gave birth to their second surviving child, Daniel Rogers Pinkham, in 1848. A third son, William Pinkham, was born in 1852, and a daughter, Aroline Chase Pinkham, in 1857. All the Pinkham children would eventually be involved in the Pinkham medicine business.

Like many women of her time, Pinkham brewed home remedies for which she continually collected recipes. Her remedy for &quot;female complaints&quot; became very popular among her neighbors to whom she gave it away. One story is that her husband was given the recipe as part payment for a debt. Whatever truth may be in this, the ingredients of her remedy were generally consistent with the herbal knowledge available to her through such sources as John King&#x27;s &quot;American Dispensary,&quot; which she is known to have owned and used.

In Pinkham&#x27;s time and place, the reputation of the medical profession was low. Medical fees were too expensive for most Americans to afford except in emergencies. In some cases, the remedies were more likely to kill than cure. For example, a common &quot;medicine&quot;, calomel, was in fact not a medicine, but instead a deadly mercurial toxin. Although mercury was not an ingredient of Pinkham&#x27;s compound, the unreliable nature of medicines was sufficiently well known to be the subject of a popular comic song. In these circumstances, many preferred to trust unlicensed &quot;root and herb&quot; practitioners, and especially to trust women who were prepared to share their domestic remedies, such as Pinkham.

Isaac Pinkham was ruined financially in the economic depression of the early 1870s. The fortunes of the Pinkham family had long been patchy, but they now entered on hard times. In 1875, the idea of making a family business of the remedy was formed. Lydia initially made the remedy on her stove before its success enabled production to be transferred to a factory. She answered letters from customers and probably wrote most of the advertising copy. Mass marketed from 1876, on, &quot;Lydia E. Pinkham&#x27;s Vegetable Compound&quot; became one of the best known patent medicines of the 19th century. Descendants of this product are still available today. Pinkham&#x27;s skill was in marketing her product directly to women, and her company continued her shrewd marketing tactics after her death. Her own face was on the label, and her company was particularly keen on the use of testimonials from grateful women.

Advertising copy urged women to write to Pinkham. They did, and they received answers. They continued to write and receive answers for decades after Pinkham&#x27;s own death. These staff-written answers combined forthright talk about women&#x27;s medical issues, advice, and, of course, recommendations for the company product. In 1905, the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; published a photograph of Pinkham&#x27;s tombstone and exposed the ruse. The Pinkham company insisted that it had never meant to imply that the letters were being answered by &quot;Lydia&quot; Pinkham, but by her daughter-in-law, &quot;Jennie&quot; Pinkham.

Although Pinkham&#x27;s motives were economic, many modern-day feminists admire her for distributing information on menstruation and the &quot;facts of life&quot;, and they consider her to be a crusader for women&#x27;s health issues in a day when women were poorly served by the medical establishment. The Lydia Pinkham House, located near her factory on Western Ave in Lynn, Massachusetts, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places September 25, 2012. In 1922, Lydia&#x27;s daughter Aroline Pinkham Chase Gove founded the Lydia E. Pinkham Memorial Clinic in Salem, Massachusetts, to provide health services to young mothers and their children. The clinic has been controlled since 1990 by Stephen Nathan Doty, a fourth-generation descendant of Lydia, who also uses the memorial building as his personal residence. The clinic is in operation . It is designated Site 9 of the Salem Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail.

==Lydia E. Pinkham&#x27;s Vegetable Compound==
The five herbs contained in Pinkham&#x27;s original formula are:

* Pleurisy root is diaphoretic, anti-spasmodic, carminative, and anti-inflammatory.
* Life root is a traditional uterine tonic, diuretic, anti-inflammatory, and emmenagogue used for amenorrhea or dysmenorrhea.
* Fenugreek is vulnerary, anti-inflammatory, anti-spasmodic, tonic, emmenagogue, galactogogue, and hypotensive.
* Unicorn Root was used by several Native American tribes for dysmenorrhea, uterine prolapse, pelvic congestion, and to improve ovarian function.
* Black cohosh is an emmenagogue, anti-spasmodic, restorative, nervine, and hypotensive and is used traditionally for menopausal symptoms.
The formula also contains drinking alcohol, which relieves muscular stress, reduces pain, and can affect mood.

Of the newer additions, motherwort is a nervine, emmenagogue, anti-spasmodic, hepatic, cardiac tonic, and hypotensive. Piscidia erythrina (Jamaican dogwood) is an eclectic remedy effective for painful spasms, pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and ovarian pain. Licorice is anti-inflammatory, anti-hepatotoxic, anti-spasmodic, and a mild laxative. Gentian is a sialagogue, hepatic, cholagogue, anthelmintic, and emmenagogue. Dandelion is a potassium-sparing diuretic, hepatic, cholagogue, anti-rheumatic, laxative, tonic, and a bitter.

Advertisements for Lydia E. Pinkham&#x27;s Vegetable Compound included popular myths of women&#x27;s health, problematizing &quot;women&#x27;s weakness&quot; of emotionality and &quot;hysteria&quot;. Some of the original product advertised such notions as encouraging sexual activity with husbands, encouraging reproduction, and &quot;restoring women&#x27;s pep&quot; so that they might prove better wives and mothers.

Medical experts dismissed Pinkham&#x27;s claims as quackery. In 1922, it was described as a &quot;valueless preparation kept on the market for about fifty years by means of lying advertisements and worthless testimonials.&quot;

The popularity of Pinkham&#x27;s compound long after her death is testament to its acceptance by women who sought relief from menstrual and menopausal symptoms. The company continued under family control until the 1930s. Although Lydia Pinkham&#x27;s company continued increasing profit margins 50 years after her death, eventually the advent of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) caused changes in the formula.

In 2005–6 the National Institutes of Health performed a &quot;12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, [which] compared several herbal regimens and menopausal hormone therapy (estrogen with or without progesterone) to placebo in women ages 45 to 55 [...] Newton and colleagues found no significant difference between the number of daily hot flashes and/or night sweats in any of the herbal supplement groups when compared to the placebo group.&quot;

==Popular culture==
===Drinking songs===
Pinkham and her &quot;medicinal compound&quot; are memorialized in the folk song &quot;The Ballad of Lydia Pinkham&quot;, also known as &quot;Lily the Pink&quot; (Roud number 8368). There is no definitive version, but one variant is known to have been in existence by the time of World War I (when it is ascribed to Canadian soldiers). Drinking songs describing the humorous invigorating effects of some food or medicine form are widespread, and the fact that Pinkham&#x27;s medicine was marketed for &quot;female complaints&quot; made it especially vulnerable to ribald fantasies about what it might cure. A further reason that a humble women&#x27;s tonic could become the subject of such a song – and an increasing success in the twenties and early thirties – was its availability as a 40 proof drink during the Prohibition era.

A sanitized version, &quot;Lily the Pink&quot;, was a number one hit for The Scaffold in the United Kingdom in 1968/69. The Irish Rovers also released the Scaffold version of the song in 1969, on the album &quot;Tales to Warm Your Mind&quot; and, as a single, it reached the Top 30 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The song was successfully adapted into French in 1969 by Richard Anthony, humorously describing the devastating effects of a so-called &quot;panacée&quot; (universal medicine).

<text>The Carme group is a group of retrograde irregular satellites of Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Carme and are thought to have a common origin.

Their semi-major axes (distances from Jupiter) range between 22.7 and 23.6 Gm, their orbital inclinations between 164.4° and 164.9°, and their orbital eccentricities between 0.25 and 0.28 (with one exception).

The Carme group members are:


The International Astronomical Union (IAU) reserves names ending in -e for all retrograde moons.

==Origin==
The very low dispersion of the mean orbital elements among the core members (the group is separated by less than 900,000 km in semi major axis and only 0.5° in inclination) suggests that the Carme group may once have been a single body that was broken apart by an impact. The dispersion can be explained by a very small velocity impulse (5 &lt; δV &lt; 50 m/s). The parent body was probably about the size of Carme, 46 km in diameter; 99% of the group&#x27;s mass is still located in Carme.

Further support to the single body origin comes from the known colours: all the satellites appear light red, with colour indices B-V= 0.76 and V-R= 0.47 and infrared spectra, similar to D-type asteroids. These data are consistent with a progenitor from the Hilda family or a Jupiter trojan.

<doc id="886737" wikidata="Q52153460" url="?curid=886737" title="Killing of Satomi Mitarai">
<text>The , also known as the Nevada-tan murder, was the murder of a 12-year-old Japanese schoolgirl, , by an 11-year-old female classmate referred to as &quot;Girl A&quot; (a common placeholder name used for female criminals in Japan). The murder occurred on June 1, 2004, at an elementary school in the city of Sasebo in Nagasaki Prefecture. The murderer slit Mitarai&#x27;s throat and arms with a box cutter.

Reactions to the incident included Internet memes and a discussions about lowering the age of criminal responsibility in Japan. The killer&#x27;s name was not released to the press, as per Japanese legal procedures prohibiting the identification of juvenile offenders; the Nagasaki District Legal Affairs Bureau cautioned Internet users against revealing her photos. However, members of the Japanese Internet community 2channel read a name on a classroom drawing believed to be made by Girl A, and publicized the name on June 18, 2004.

==Murder==
On June 1, 2004, Girl A murdered her 12-year-old classmate, Satomi Mitarai, in an empty classroom during the lunch hour at Okubo Elementary School in Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture. Girl A returned to her classroom, her clothes covered in blood. The girls&#x27; teacher, who had noticed that both girls were missing, stumbled upon the body and called the police.

After being taken into custody, Girl A was reported to have confessed to the crime, saying &quot;I am sorry, I am sorry&quot; to police officers. She spent the night at the police station, often crying, and refusing to eat or drink. Girl A initially mentioned no motive for the killing. Shortly afterward, she confessed to police that she and Mitarai had quarreled as a result of messages left on the Internet. Girl A claimed that Mitarai slandered her by commenting on her weight and calling her a &quot;goody-goody&quot;.

On September 15, 2004, a Japanese Family Court ruled to institutionalize Girl A, putting aside her young age because of the severity of the crime. She was sent to a reformatory in Tochigi Prefecture. The Nagasaki family court originally sentenced Girl A to two years of involuntary commitment, but the sentence was extended by two years in September 2006, following a psychological evaluation. On May 29, 2008, local authorities announced that they did not seek an additional sentence.

Because of her issues with communication and obsessive interests, Girl A was diagnosed after the murder with Asperger syndrome.

==Reaction==
The killing provoked a debate in Japan whether the age of criminal responsibility, lowered from 16 to 14 in 2000 due to the 1997 Kobe child murders, needed to be lowered again. Girl A was considered to be a normal and well-adjusted child before the incident, which made the public more anxious.

Members of the Japanese Diet, such as Kiichi Inoue and Sadakazu Tanigaki, came under criticism for comments made in the wake of the killing. Inoue was criticized for referring to Girl A as &quot;genki&quot; (vigorous, lively), a word with positive connotations. Tanigaki was criticized for referring to the method of killing, slitting of the throat, as a &quot;manly&quot; act.

Girl A became the subject of an Internet meme on Japanese web communities such as 2channel. She was nicknamed &quot;Nevada-tan&quot; because a class photograph showed a young girl believed to be her wearing a University of Nevada, Reno sweatshirt, with being a childlike pronunciation of the Japanese honorific suffix , generally used to refer to young girls.

Akio Mori cited this case in support of his controversial &quot;game brain&quot; theory, which has been criticized as pseudoscience. Girl A was reported to be a fan of the death-themed flash animation &quot;Red Room&quot;, a claim used in support of the theory. It was also known that Girl A had read the controversial novel &quot;Battle Royale&quot; and had seen its film adaptation, which centers on young students fighting to the death.

On March 18, 2005, during the Okubo Elementary graduation ceremony, students were given a graduation album with a blank page in honor of Mitarai&#x27;s death on which they could put pictures of Mitarai, Girl A, or class pictures containing both girls. Mitarai was posthumously awarded a graduation certificate, which her father accepted on her behalf. Girl A was also awarded a certificate, as one is required in Japan in order to enter a junior high school and the school believed it would aid her &quot;reintegration into society&quot;.

<text>Louis Jacobs (17 July 1920 – 1 July 2006) was a leading writer, Jewish theologian, and rabbi of the New London Synagogue in the United Kingdom. He was also the focus in the early 1960s of what became known as the &quot;Jacobs Affair&quot; in the British Jewish community.

==Early career==
Jacobs was born in Manchester on 17 July 1920. He studied at Manchester Yeshiva, and later at the kolel in Gateshead. His teachers included leading Rabbi Eliyahu Dessler. Jacobs was ordained as a rabbi at Manchester Yeshiva. Later in his career, he studied at University College London where he gained his PhD on the topic of &quot;The Business Life of the Jews in Babylon, 200–500 CE&quot;. Jacobs was appointed rabbi at Manchester Central Synagogue in 1948. In 1954, he was appointed to the New West End Synagogue in London.

Jacobs became Moral Tutor at Jews&#x27; College, London, where he taught Talmud and homiletics during the last years of Rabbi Dr Isidore Epstein&#x27;s tenure as principal. By this time, Jacobs had drifted away from the strictly traditional approach to Jewish theology that had marked his formative years. Instead, he struggled to find a synthesis that would accommodate Orthodox Jewish theology and modern day higher biblical criticism. Jacobs was especially concerned with how to reconcile modern-day Orthodox Jewish faith with the documentary hypothesis. His ideas about the subject were outlined in the book, &quot;We Have Reason to Believe&quot;, which was published in 1957. The work was originally written to record the essence of discussions held on its title&#x27;s subject at weekly classes given by Jacobs at the New West End Synagogue, and resulted in some mild criticism (but not in any major censure) at the time.

==&quot;We Have Reason to Believe&quot;==
Most of Jacobs&#x27; book titled &quot;We Have Reason to Believe&quot; deals with such topics as proof of God&#x27;s existence, pain, miracles, the afterlife, and election: ideas which were not in and of themselves controversial. Debate on the book was eventually to centre on chapters 6, 7, and 8: &quot;The Torah and Modern Criticism, A Synthesis of the Traditional and Critical Views&quot; and &quot;Bible Difficulties&quot;.

In these chapters, Jacobs took on discussion biblical criticism. Specifically, Jacobs was concerned with source criticism of the Torah and the documentary hypothesis; the latter of which suggests that the Torah derives from multiple sources rather than having been given, as Orthodox rabbinical traditions have it, complete in its present form by God to Moses during the period beginning on Mount Sinai and ending with Moses&#x27;s death.

Jacobs comments: &quot;While Judaism stands or falls on the belief in revelation, there is no &#x27;official&#x27; interpretation on the way in which God spoke to man&quot;. He writes that, &quot;according to some rabbis, [the Pentateuch] was given to Moses at intervals during the sojourn in the Wilderness&quot;. He also comments that, given the arguments of textual criticism, &quot;no work of Jewish apologetics, however limited in scope, can afford to fight shy of the problem&quot;. Here there is an implied rebuke of the tendency of many Jewish authorities of the period simply to gloss over the inconveniences of the thoughts of the &quot;modern critics&quot; – a rebuke which may have rankled some.

Jacobs concludes: &quot;There is nothing to deter the faithful Jew from accepting the principle of textual criticism&quot;. He is aware that &quot;to talk about &#x27;reconciling&#x27; the Maimonidean idea and the Documentary Hypothesis […] is futile, for you cannot reconcile two contradictory theories. But to say this is not to preclude the possibility of a &quot;synthesis&quot; between the old knowledge and the new knowledge&quot;.

Jacobs provides numerous examples from the Talmud and other rabbinical writings indicating acceptance of the idea of Divine intervention in human affairs with &quot;God revealing his Will not alone &quot;to&quot; men but &quot;through&quot; men&quot;. He concludes that, even if the documentary hypothesis is partly (or even entirely) correct,
God&#x27;s power is not lessened because He preferred to co-operate with His creatures in producing the Book of Books […] We hear the authentic voice of God speaking to us through the pages of the Bible […] and its message is in no way affected in that we can only hear that voice through the medium of human beings.

==The &quot;Jacobs Affair&quot;==
It had been widely assumed that after Epstein&#x27;s retirement as principal of Jews&#x27; College he would be succeeded by Jacobs. When this assumption was translated into a definite invitation by the College&#x27;s Board of Trustees in 1961, the then Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom, Israel Brodie, interdicted the appointment &quot;because of his [Jacobs&#x27;s] published views&quot;. This was a reference to &quot;We Have Reason to Believe&quot;.

The British newspaper, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;, took up the issue and turned it into a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; which was reported in the national press, including &quot;The Times&quot;. It wasan event that threatened to become the biggest schism in Anglo-Jewish history.
The events in 1964 that came to be known as &quot;the Jacobs Affair&quot; dominated not just the Jewish media but the whole of Fleet Street and the newsrooms of both the BBC and ITN. Not that Jacobs himself was a willing participant in the affair. He was dragged into it by the religious establishment of the day. When Jacobs wished to return to his pulpit at the New West End Synagogue, Brodie vetoed his appointment. A number of members then left the New West End Synagogue to found the New London Synagogue.

Public interest in Jacobs&#x27;s differences with the Anglo-Jewish establishment is also demonstrated by the television interview of Dr. Jacobs of 1966 conducted by Bernard Levin.

==The New London Synagogue==
The defecting congregation purchased the old St John&#x27;s Wood synagogue building, and installed Jacobs as its rabbi – a post which he held until 2001 and to which he returned in 2005. This congregation, The New London Synagogue, became the &quot;parent&quot; of the Masorti movement in the United Kingdom, which now numbers several congregations.

While holding the position of rabbi at the New London Synagogue, Dr Jacobs was also for many years Lecturer in Talmud and Zohar at the Leo Baeck College, a rabbinical college preparing students to serve as Masorti, Reform and Liberal rabbis in the UK and Europe. Rabbi Jacobs served as Chairman of the Academic Committee for some years.

When the Masorti Movement in Britain was created its founders asked him to be its spiritual guide. Despite his ambivalence about the need and purpose of a new movement, he agreed. But he refused to be regarded as its founder. He always described Masorti as a mood not a movement&quot;.

Since the founding of the New London Synagogue, Jacobs and the Masorti movement were subject to hostility from Orthodox British Jewish institutions. On his 83rd birthday, in the Bournemouth United Synagogue on the sabbath before his granddaughter&#x27;s wedding, Jacobs was not provided the honour of an &quot;aliyah&quot; customarily given to the father of the bride, which gave rise to heated correspondence in the Jewish press including accusations of pettiness and vindictiveness. The Chief Rabbi, Lord Jonathan Sacks, and the head of the London Beth Din, Dayan Chanoch Ehrentreu, responded that, because of what they considered to be Jacobs&#x27;s heretical beliefs, &quot;they believed that had Jacobs uttered the words &#x27;Our God […] who gave us the Torah of truth […] &#x27;, he would have made a false statement&quot;.

==Witness for Chabad-Lubavitch==
Jacobs testified on behalf of the Chabad Lubavitch movement during the Chabad library controversy. Being an acknowledged scholar on Chasidism, Jacobs was called as an expert witness to testify on the Chabad practice of &quot;ma&#x27;amad&quot; (support), the method by which the members of the Chabad community supported their Rebbe.

Jacobs testified that &quot;[ma&#x27;mad] is a due, for which every member of the movement is expected to consider himself responsible, and ... there is an amount according to means which every member pays or is expected to pay. It is best compared to membership dues of a learned society or a sacred society, and the dues are expected as [a] token of membership.&quot; Jacobs noted that other Chasidic groups support their Rebbes by gifts known as &quot;pidyon&quot; (redemption) or &quot;pidyon nefesh&quot; (redemption of the soul) delivered personally to a rebbe. Pidyon is understood by Jacobs as &quot;a personal gift, as it were ... for [spiritual] services rendered.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Jacobs died on 1 July 2006 and is buried at Western Cemetery (Cheshunt) alongside his wife Sophie (Shulamit) (1921–2005).

A few months before he died, Jacobs donated his book collection to the Leopold Muller Memorial Library at the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies.

In December 2005, a poll by &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; of its subscribers, in which 2,000 readers made their nominations, voted Jacobs the &quot;greatest British Jew&quot; in the community&#x27;s 350-year history in England. Jacobs commented &quot;I feel greatly honoured – and rather daft.&quot; Nevertheless, reports that Louis Jacobs had been nominated greatest British Jew received wide press coverage in Britain.

<doc id="886762" wikidata="Q482779" url="?curid=886762" title="Giresun Province">
<text>Giresun Province (Greek : Κερασούντα, ; ) is a province of Turkey on the Black Sea coast. Its adjacent provinces are Trabzon to the east, Gümüşhane to the southeast, Erzincan to the south, Sivas to the southwest, and Ordu to the west. Its area is 6,972 km2, and its population is 450,862 (2022). The provincial capital is Giresun. Its license-plate code is 28.

==Geography==

Giresun is an agricultural region and its lower areas, near the Black Sea coast. It is Turkey&#x27;s second largest producer of hazelnuts and it is famously home to the best quality hazelnuts in the world; a Giresun folk song tells &quot;I will not eat a single hazelnut, unless you are by my side,&quot; while another tells of a lover shot dead under a hazelnut tree.

Forests and pasture cover the high mountainous regions, and in places there is mining of copper, zinc, iron and other metals. The mountain villages are remote, with poor roads and little else in the way of infrastructure. The hillsides are too steep for most forms of agriculture, and as a result, cornbread is the traditional meal, as wheat cannot be grown.

The climate is typical of this stretch of the Black Sea coast, i.e. very wet. Local flora includes bilberries (Turkish &quot;taflan&quot;).

== Demographics ==
The province is traditionally inhabited mostly by Chepni Turks as well as a minority of Cheveneburi Georgians in select rural villages and towns. 

Due to migration, more Giresunians live outside of Giresun than inside it.

==Districts==

Giresun province is divided into 16 districts (capital district in bold):

==Culture==
Giresun province is culturally divided into two regions from north to south. North Giresun having virtually the same culture as the neighbouring Ordu and Trabzon, while south Giresun (aka. the Şebinkarahisar region) being much closer to the neighbouring Sivas province and the Central Anatolia region. Because of the northern part dominating much of the province&#x27;s economic and demographic sides, south of the province is more often than not ignored. 

===Handcrafts===
Due to the dense forestry in Giresun, woodwork is among the common handcrafts in the region. Some small wooden handcrafts peculiar to the city are churns, külek (a storing pot for cheese), and spoons. One of the oldest handcrafts in the city is weaving. Wool, linen threads and similar raw materials are spun in handlooms to produce various local clothes, heybe (shoulder bags) and bags. Strong threads and knitted threads are also produced in handlooms.

===Cuisine===
Some of the dishes peculiar to the city are corn soup (Mısır çorbası), kale soup (kara lahana çorbası or pancar çorbası), cabbage leaves stuffed with a meat filling (etli lahana sarması or pancar sarması/dolması), black cabbage dish (karalahana yemeği or pancar yemeği), pilaf with anchovy (hamsili pilav), pilaf with cabbage (dible), kaygana, kuymak (made of cheese, cornmeal and butter)

<text>A Bell test, also known as Bell inequality test or Bell experiment, is a real-world physics experiment designed to test the theory of quantum mechanics in relation to Albert Einstein&#x27;s concept of local realism. Named for John Stewart Bell, the experiments test whether or not the real world satisfies local realism, which requires the presence of some additional local variables (called &quot;hidden&quot; because they are not a feature of quantum theory) to explain the behavior of particles like photons and electrons. The test empirically evaluates the implications of Bell&#x27;s theorem. , all Bell tests have found that the hypothesis of local hidden variables is inconsistent with the way that physical systems behave.

Many types of Bell tests have been performed in physics laboratories, often with the goal of ameliorating problems of experimental design or set-up that could in principle affect the validity of the findings of earlier Bell tests. This is known as &quot;closing loopholes in Bell tests&quot;.

Bell inequality violations are also used in some quantum cryptography protocols, whereby a spy&#x27;s presence is detected when Bell&#x27;s inequalities &quot;cease&quot; to be violated.

==Overview==

The Bell test has its origins in the debate between Einstein and other pioneers of quantum physics, principally Niels Bohr. One feature of the theory of quantum mechanics under debate was the meaning of Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle. This principle states that if some information is known about a given particle, there is some other information about it that is impossible to know. An example of this is found in observations of the position and the momentum of a given particle. According to the uncertainty principle, a particle&#x27;s momentum and its position cannot simultaneously be determined with arbitrarily high precision.

In 1935, Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen published a claim that quantum mechanics predicts that more information about a pair of entangled particles could be observed than Heisenberg&#x27;s principle allowed, which would only be possible if information were travelling instantly between the two particles. This produces a paradox which came to be known as the &quot;EPR paradox&quot; after the three authors. It arises if any effect felt in one location is not the result of a cause that occurred in its past light cone, relative to its location. This action at a distance seems to violate causality, by allowing information between the two locations to travel faster than the speed of light. However, it is a common misconception to think that any information can be shared between two observers faster than the speed of light using entangled particles; the hypothetical information transfer here is between the particles. See no-communication theorem for further explanation.

Based on this, the authors concluded that the quantum wave function does not provide a complete description of reality. They suggested that there must be some local hidden variables at work in order to account for the behavior of entangled particles. In a theory of hidden variables, as Einstein envisaged it, the randomness and indeterminacy seen in the behavior of quantum particles would only be apparent. For example, if one knew the details of all the hidden variables associated with a particle, then one could predict both its position and momentum. The uncertainty that had been quantified by Heisenberg&#x27;s principle would simply be an artifact of not having complete information about the hidden variables. Furthermore, Einstein argued that the hidden variables should obey the condition of locality: Whatever the hidden variables actually are, the behavior of the hidden variables for one particle should not be able to instantly affect the behavior of those for another particle far away. This idea, called the principle of locality, is rooted in intuition from classical physics that physical interactions do not propagate instantly across space. These ideas were the subject of ongoing debate between their proponents. In particular, Einstein himself did not approve of the way Podolsky had stated the problem in the famous EPR paper.

In 1964, John Stewart Bell proposed his famous theorem, which states that no physical theory of hidden local variables can ever reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics. Implicit in the theorem is the proposition that the determinism of classical physics is fundamentally incapable of describing quantum mechanics. Bell expanded on the theorem to provide what would become the conceptual foundation of the Bell test experiments.

A typical experiment involves the observation of particles, often photons, in an apparatus designed to produce entangled pairs and allow for the measurement of some characteristic of each, such as their spin. The results of the experiment could then be compared to what was predicted by local realism and those predicted by quantum mechanics.

In theory, the results could be &quot;coincidentally&quot; consistent with both. To address this problem, Bell proposed a mathematical description of local realism that placed a statistical limit on the likelihood of that eventuality. If the results of an experiment violate Bell&#x27;s inequality, local hidden variables can be ruled out as their cause. Later researchers built on Bell&#x27;s work by proposing new inequalities that serve the same purpose and refine the basic idea in one way or another. Consequently, the term &quot;Bell inequality&quot; can mean any one of a number of inequalities satisfied by local hidden-variables theories; in practice, many present-day experiments employ the CHSH inequality. All these inequalities, like the original devised by Bell, express the idea that assuming local realism places restrictions on the statistical results of experiments on sets of particles that have taken part in an interaction and then separated.

To date, all Bell tests have supported the theory of quantum physics, and not the hypothesis of local hidden variables. These efforts to experimentally validate violations of the Bell inequalities resulted in John Clauser, Alain Aspect, and Anton Zeilinger being awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics.

== Conduct of optical Bell test experiments ==
In practice most actual experiments have used light, assumed to be emitted in the form of particle-like photons (produced by atomic cascade or spontaneous parametric down conversion), rather than the atoms that Bell originally had in mind. The property of interest is, in the best known experiments, the polarisation direction, though other properties can be used. Such experiments fall into two classes, depending on whether the analysers used have one or two output channels.

=== A typical CHSH (two-channel) experiment ===

The diagram shows a typical optical experiment of the two-channel kind for which Alain Aspect set a precedent in 1982. Coincidences (simultaneous detections) are recorded, the results being categorised as &#x27;++&#x27;, &#x27;+−&#x27;, &#x27;−+&#x27; or &#x27;−−&#x27; and corresponding counts accumulated.

Four separate subexperiments are conducted, corresponding to the four terms &quot;E&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) in the test statistic &quot;S&quot; (equation (2) shown below). The settings &quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;′, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;b&quot;′ are generally in practice chosen to be 0, 45°, 22.5° and 67.5° respectively — the &quot;Bell test angles&quot; — these being the ones for which the quantum mechanical formula gives the greatest violation of the inequality.

For each selected value of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, the numbers of coincidences in each category (&quot;N&quot;++, &quot;N&quot;−−, &quot;N&quot;+− and &quot;N&quot;−+) are recorded. The experimental estimate for &quot;E&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) is then calculated as:

 {N_{++} + N_{+-} + N_{-+}+ N_{--}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Once all four &quot;E&quot;’s have been estimated, an experimental estimate of the test statistic

can be found. If &quot;S&quot; is numerically greater than 2 it has infringed the CHSH inequality. The experiment is declared to have supported the QM prediction and ruled out all local hidden-variable theories.

A strong assumption has had to be made, however, to justify use of expression (2), namely, that the sample of detected pairs is representative of the pairs emitted by the source. Denial of this assumption is called the fair sampling loophole.

=== A typical CH74 (single-channel) experiment ===
Prior to 1982 all actual Bell tests used &quot;single-channel&quot; polarisers and variations on an inequality designed for this setup. The latter is described in Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt&#x27;s much-cited 1969 article as being the one suitable for practical use. As with the CHSH test, there are four subexperiments in which each polariser takes one of two possible settings, but in addition there are other subexperiments in which one or other polariser or both are absent. Counts are taken as before and used to estimate the test statistic.

where the symbol ∞ indicates absence of a polariser.

If &quot;S&quot; exceeds 0 then the experiment is declared to have infringed the CH inequality and hence to have refuted local hidden-variables. This inequality is known as CH inequality instead of CHSH as it was also derived in a 1974 article by Clauser and Horne more rigorously and under weaker assumptions.

== Experimental assumptions ==
In addition to the theoretical assumptions, there are practical ones. There may, for example, be a number of &quot;accidental coincidences&quot; in addition to those of interest. It is assumed that no bias is introduced by subtracting their estimated number before calculating &quot;S&quot;, but that this is true is not considered by some to be obvious. There may be synchronisation problems — ambiguity in recognising pairs because in practice they will not be detected at &quot;exactly&quot; the same time.

Nevertheless, despite all the deficiencies of the actual experiments, one striking fact emerges: the results are, to a very good approximation, what quantum mechanics predicts. If imperfect experiments give us such excellent overlap with quantum predictions, most working quantum physicists would agree with John Bell in expecting that, when a perfect Bell test is done, the Bell inequalities will still be violated. This attitude has led to the emergence of a new sub-field of physics known as quantum information theory. One of the main achievements of this new branch of physics is showing that violation of Bell&#x27;s inequalities leads to the possibility of a secure information transfer, which utilizes the so-called quantum cryptography (involving entangled states of pairs of particles).

== Notable experiments ==
Over the past half century, a great number of Bell test experiments have been conducted. The experiments are commonly interpreted to rule out local hidden-variable theories, and in 2015 an experiment was performed that is not subject to either the locality loophole or the detection loophole (Hensen et al.). An experiment free of the locality loophole is one where for each separate measurement and in each wing of the experiment, a new setting is chosen and the measurement completed before signals could communicate the settings from one wing of the experiment to the other. An experiment free of the detection loophole is one where close to 100% of the successful measurement outcomes in one wing of the experiment are paired with a successful measurement in the other wing. This percentage is called the efficiency of the experiment. Advancements in technology have led to a great variety of methods to test Bell-type inequalities.

Some of the best known and recent experiments include:

=== Kasday, Ullman and Wu (1970) ===
Leonard Ralph Kasday, Jack R. Ullman and Chien-Shiung Wu carried out the first experimental Bell test, using photon pairs produced by positronium decay and analyzed by Compton scattering. The experiment observed photon polarization correlations consistent with quantum predictions and inconsistent with local realistic models that obey the known polarization dependence of Compton scattering. Due to the low polarization selectivity of Compton scattering, the results did not violate a Bell inequality.

=== Freedman and Clauser (1972) ===
Stuart J. Freedman and John Clauser carried out the first Bell test that observed a Bell inequality violation, using Freedman&#x27;s inequality, a variant on the CH74 inequality.

=== Aspect et al. (1982) ===

Alain Aspect and his team at Orsay, Paris, conducted three Bell tests using calcium cascade sources. The first and last used the CH74 inequality. The second was the first application of the CHSH inequality. The third (and most famous) was arranged such that the choice between the two settings on each side was made during the flight of the photons (as originally suggested by John Bell).

=== Tittel et al. (1998) ===
The Geneva 1998 Bell test experiments showed that distance did not destroy the &quot;entanglement&quot;. Light was sent in fibre optic cables over distances of several kilometers before it was analysed. As with almost all Bell tests since about 1985, a &quot;parametric down-conversion&quot; (PDC) source was used.

=== Weihs et al. (1998): experiment under &quot;strict Einstein locality&quot; conditions ===
In 1998 Gregor Weihs and a team at Innsbruck, led by Anton Zeilinger, conducted an experiment that closed the &quot;locality&quot; loophole, improving on Aspect&#x27;s of 1982. The choice of detector was made using a quantum process to ensure that it was random. This test violated the CHSH inequality by over 30 standard deviations, the coincidence curves agreeing with those predicted by quantum theory.

=== Pan et al. (2000) experiment on the GHZ state ===
This is the first of new Bell-type experiments on more than two particles; this one uses the so-called GHZ state of three particles.

=== Rowe et al. (2001): the first to close the detection loophole ===
The detection loophole was first closed in an experiment with two entangled trapped ions, carried out in the ion storage group of David Wineland at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder. The experiment had detection efficiencies well over 90%.

=== Go et al. (Belle collaboration): Observation of Bell inequality violation in B mesons ===
Using semileptonic B0 decays of Υ(4S) at Belle experiment, a clear violation of Bell Inequality in particle-antiparticle correlation is observed.

=== Gröblacher et al. (2007) test of Leggett-type non-local realist theories ===
A specific class of non-local theories suggested by Anthony Leggett is ruled out. Based on this, the authors conclude that any possible non-local hidden-variable theory consistent with quantum mechanics must be highly counterintuitive.

=== Salart et al. (2008): separation in a Bell Test ===
This experiment filled a loophole by providing an 18 km separation between detectors, which is sufficient to allow the completion of the quantum state measurements before any information could have traveled between the two detectors.

=== Ansmann et al. (2009): overcoming the detection loophole in solid state ===
This was the first experiment testing Bell inequalities with solid-state qubits (superconducting Josephson phase qubits were used). This experiment surmounted the detection loophole using a pair of superconducting qubits in an entangled state. However, the experiment still suffered from the locality loophole because the qubits were only separated by a few millimeters.

=== Giustina et al. (2013), Larsson et al (2014): overcoming the detection loophole for photons ===
The detection loophole for photons has been closed for the first time by Marissa Giustina, using highly efficient detectors. This makes photons the first system for which all of the main loopholes have been closed, albeit in different experiments.

=== Christensen et al. (2013): overcoming the detection loophole for photons ===
The Christensen et al. (2013) experiment is similar to that of Giustina et al. Giustina et al. did just four long runs with constant measurement settings (one for each of the four pairs of settings). The experiment was not pulsed so that formation of &quot;pairs&quot; from the two records of measurement results (Alice and Bob) had to be done after the experiment which in fact exposes the experiment to the coincidence loophole. This led to a reanalysis of the experimental data in a way which removed the coincidence loophole, and fortunately the new analysis still showed a violation of the appropriate CHSH or CH inequality. On the other hand, the Christensen et al. experiment was pulsed and measurement settings were frequently reset in a random way, though only once every 1000 particle pairs, not every time.

=== Hensen et al., Giustina et al., Shalm et al. (2015): &quot;loophole-free&quot; Bell tests ===

In 2015 the first three significant-loophole-free Bell-tests were published within three months by independent groups in Delft, Vienna and Boulder. All three tests simultaneously addressed the detection loophole, the locality loophole, and the memory loophole. This makes them “loophole-free” in the sense that all remaining conceivable loopholes like superdeterminism require truly exotic hypotheses that might never get closed experimentally.

The first published experiment by Hensen et al. used a photonic link to entangle the electron spins of two nitrogen-vacancy defect centres in diamonds 1.3 kilometers apart and measured a violation of the CHSH inequality (&quot;S&quot; = 2.42 ± 0.20). Thereby the local-realist hypothesis could be rejected with a &quot;p&quot;-value of 0.039.

Both simultaneously published experiments by Giustina et al.
and Shalm et al.
used entangled photons to obtain a Bell inequality violation with high statistical significance (p-value ≪10−6). Notably, the experiment by Shalm et al. also combined three types of (quasi-)random number generators to determine the measurement basis choices. One of these methods, detailed in an ancillary file, is the “&#x27;Cultural&#x27; pseudorandom source” which involved using bit strings from popular media such as the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; films, &quot;Star Trek: Beyond the Final Frontier&quot;, &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, and the television shows &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; and &quot;Dr. Who&quot;.

=== Schmied et al. (2016): Detection of Bell correlations in a many-body system ===
Using a witness for Bell correlations derived from a multi-partite Bell inequality, physicists at the University of Basel were able to conclude for the first time Bell correlation in a many-body system composed by about 480 atoms in a Bose–Einstein condensate. Even though loopholes were not closed, this experiment shows the possibility of observing Bell correlations in the macroscopic regime.

=== Handsteiner et al. (2017): &quot;Cosmic Bell Test&quot; - Measurement Settings from Milky Way Stars ===
Physicists led by David Kaiser of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Anton Zeilinger of the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information and University of Vienna performed an experiment that &quot;produced results consistent with nonlocality&quot; by measuring starlight that had taken 600 years to travel to Earth. The experiment “represents the first experiment to dramatically limit the space-time region in which hidden variables could be relevant.”

=== Rosenfeld et al. (2017): &quot;Event-Ready&quot; Bell test with entangled atoms and closed detection and locality loopholes ===
Physicists at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics published results from an experiment in which they observed a Bell inequality violation using entangled spin states of two atoms with a separation distance of 398 meters in which the detection loophole, the locality loophole, and the memory loophole were closed. The violation of S = 2.221 ± 0.033 rejected local realism with a significance value of P = 1.02×10−16 when taking into account 7 months of data and 55000 events or an upper bound of P = 2.57×10−9 from a single run with 10000 events.

=== The BIG Bell Test Collaboration (2018): “Challenging local realism with human choices” ===
An international collaborative scientific effort used arbitrary human choice to define measurement settings instead of using random number generators. Assuming that human free will exists, this would close the “freedom-of-choice loophole”. Around 100,000 participants were recruited in order to provide sufficient input for the experiment to be statistically significant.

=== Rauch et al (2018): measurement settings from distant quasars ===
In 2018, an international team used light from two quasars (one whose light was generated approximately eight billion years ago and the other approximately twelve billion years ago) as the basis for their measurement settings. This experiment pushed the timeframe for when the settings could have been mutually determined to at least 7.8 billion years in the past, a substantial fraction of the superdeterministic limit (that being the creation of the universe 13.8 billion years ago).

The 2019 PBS Nova episode &quot;Einstein&#x27;s Quantum Riddle&quot; documents this &quot;cosmic Bell test&quot; measurement, with footage of the scientific team on-site at the high-altitude Teide Observatory located in the Canary Islands.

=== Storz et al (2023): Loophole-free Bell inequality violation with superconducting circuits ===
In 2023, an international team led by the group of Andreas Wallraff at ETH Zurich demonstrated a loophole-free violation of the CHSH inequality with superconducting circuits deterministically entangled via a cryogenic link spanning a distance of 30 meters.

== Loopholes ==
Though the series of increasingly sophisticated Bell test experiments has convinced the physics community that local hidden-variable theories are indefensible; they can never be excluded entirely. For example, the hypothesis of superdeterminism in which all experiments and outcomes (and everything else) are predetermined can never be excluded (because it is unfalsifiable).

Up to 2015, the outcome of all experiments that violate a Bell inequality could still theoretically be explained by exploiting the detection loophole and/or the locality loophole. The locality (or communication) loophole means that since in actual practice the two detections are separated by a time-like interval, the first detection may influence the second by some kind of signal. To avoid this loophole, the experimenter has to ensure that particles travel far apart before being measured, and that the measurement process is rapid. More serious is the detection (or unfair sampling) loophole, because particles are not always detected in both wings of the experiment. It can be imagined that the complete set of particles would behave randomly, but instruments only detect a subsample showing quantum correlations, by letting detection be dependent on a combination of local hidden variables and detector setting.

Experimenters had repeatedly voiced that loophole-free tests could be expected in the near future. In 2015, a loophole-free Bell violation was reported using entangled diamond spins over a distance of and corroborated by two experiments using entangled photon pairs.

The remaining possible theories that obey local realism can be further restricted by testing different spatial configurations, methods to determine the measurement settings, and recording devices. It has been suggested that using humans to generate the measurement settings and observe the outcomes provides a further test. David Kaiser of MIT told the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2015 that a potential weakness of the &quot;loophole-free&quot; experiments is that the systems used to add randomness to the measurement may be predetermined in a method that was not detected in experiments.

===Detection loophole===
A common problem in optical Bell tests is that only a small fraction of the emitted photons are detected. It is then possible that the correlations of the detected photons are unrepresentative: although they show a violation of a Bell inequality, if all photons were detected the Bell inequality would actually be respected. This was first noted by Philip M. Pearle in 1970, who devised a local hidden variable model that faked a Bell violation by letting the photon be detected only if the measurement setting was favourable. The assumption that this does not happen, i.e., that the small sample is actually representative of the whole is called the &quot;fair sampling&quot; assumption.

To do away with this assumption it is necessary to detect a sufficiently large fraction of the photons. This is usually characterized in terms of the detection efficiency formula_1, defined as the probability that a photodetector detects a photon that arrives at it. Anupam Garg and N. David Mermin showed that when using a maximally entangled state and the CHSH inequality an efficiency of formula_2 is required for a loophole-free violation. Later Philippe H. Eberhard showed that when using a &quot;partially&quot; entangled state a loophole-free violation is possible for formula_3, which is the optimal bound for the CHSH inequality. Other Bell inequalities allow for even lower bounds. For example, there exists a four-setting inequality which is violated for formula_4.

Historically, only experiments with non-optical systems have been able to reach high enough efficiencies to close this loophole, such as trapped ions, superconducting qubits, and nitrogen-vacancy centers. These experiments were not able to close the locality loophole, which is easy to do with photons. More recently, however, optical setups have managed to reach sufficiently high detection efficiencies by using superconducting photodetectors, and hybrid setups have managed to combine the high detection efficiency typical of matter systems with the ease of distributing entanglement at a distance typical of photonic systems.

===Locality loophole===
One of the assumptions of Bell&#x27;s theorem is the one of locality, namely that the choice of setting at a measurement site does not influence the result of the other. The motivation for this assumption is the theory of relativity, that prohibits communication faster than light. For this motivation to apply to an experiment, it needs to have space-like separation between its measurements events. That is, the time that passes between the choice of measurement setting and the production of an outcome must be shorter than the time it takes for a light signal to travel between the measurement sites.

The first experiment that strived to respect this condition was Aspect&#x27;s 1982 experiment. In it the settings were changed fast enough, but deterministically. The first experiment to change the settings randomly, with the choices made by a quantum random number generator, was Weihs et al.&#x27;s 1998 experiment. Scheidl et al. improved on this further in 2010 by conducting an experiment between locations separated by a distance of .

===Coincidence loophole===
In many experiments, especially those based on photon polarization, pairs of events in the two wings of the experiment are only identified as belonging to a single pair after the experiment is performed, by judging whether or not their detection times are close enough to one another. This generates a new possibility for a local hidden variables theory to &quot;fake&quot; quantum correlations: delay the detection time of each of the two particles by a larger or smaller amount depending on some relationship between hidden variables carried by the particles and the detector settings encountered at the measurement station.

The coincidence loophole can be ruled out entirely simply by working with a pre-fixed lattice of detection windows which are short enough that most pairs of events occurring in the same window do originate with the same emission and long enough that a true pair is not separated by a window boundary.

===Memory loophole===
In most experiments, measurements are repeatedly made at the same two locations. A local hidden variable theory could exploit the memory of past measurement settings and outcomes in order to increase the violation of a Bell inequality. Moreover, physical parameters might be varying in time. It has been shown that, provided each new pair of measurements is done with a new random pair of measurement settings, that neither memory nor time inhomogeneity have a serious effect on the experiment.

===Superdeterminism===

A necessary assumption to derive Bell&#x27;s theorem is that the hidden variables are not correlated with the measurement settings. This assumption has been justified on the grounds that the experimenter has &quot;free will&quot; to choose the settings, and that such is necessary to do science in the first place. A (hypothetical) theory where the choice of measurement is determined by the system being measured is known as &quot;superdeterministic&quot;.

=== Many-worlds loophole ===
The many-worlds interpretation, also known as the Hugh Everett interpretation, is deterministic and has local dynamics, consisting of the unitary part of quantum mechanics without collapse. Bell&#x27;s theorem does not apply because of an implicit assumption that measurements have a single outcome.

<text>Giuseppe Fanelli (13 October 1827 – 5 January 1877) was an Italian revolutionary anarchist, best known for his tour of Spain in 1868, introducing the anarchist ideas of Mikhail Bakunin.

== Life and revolutionary path ==
Fanelli was born in Naples, Italy on 13 October 1827. At the age of 18, he enrolled in Giovine Italia, a political movement with the goal to create a united Italian republic.

He was active in the insurrectionary, united Italian republic Young Italy movement and fought in the Milan insurrection of the 1848 revolution. He went on to fight alongside Garibaldi&#x27;s Redshirts in the &quot;Expedition of the Thousand&quot; in Sicily in 1860; he also fought in the Polish uprising in 1863. He was elected to Italian Parliament in November 1865 and fought against the Austrians in 1866.

Fanelli met Bakunin at Ischia in 1866. In October 1868 Bakunin sponsored Fanelli to travel to Barcelona to share his libertarian visions and recruit revolutionists to the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association. Fanellis trip and the meeting he organised during his travels provided the catalyst for the Spanish exiles, the largest workers&#x27; and peasants&#x27; movement in modern Spain and the largest anarchist movement in modern Europe.

Fanelli&#x27;s tour took him first to Barcelona, where he met and stayed with Élisée Reclus. Reclus and Fanelli were at odds over Reclus&#x27; friendships with Spanish republicans, and Fanelli soon left Barcelona for Madrid. Fanelli stayed in Madrid until the end of January 1869, conducting meetings to introduce Spanish workers, including Anselmo Lorenzo, to the First National. In February 1869 Fanelli left Madrid, journeying home via Barcelona. While in Barcelona again, he met with painter Josep Lluís Pellicer and his cousin, Rafael Farga Pellicer along with others who were to play an important role establishing the International in Barcelona.

== Death ==
Fanelli died of tuberculosis in Naples in 1877.

<text>Ordu Province () is a province and metropolitan municipality of Turkey, located on the Black Sea coast. Its area is 5,914 km2, and its population is 763,190 (2022). Its adjacent provinces are Samsun to the northwest, Tokat to the southwest, Sivas to the south, and Giresun to the east. Its license-plate code is 52. The capital of the province is the city of Ordu.

==Geography==
 

Ordu is a strip of Black Sea coast and the hills behind, historically an agricultural and fishing area and in recent years, tourism has seen an increase, mainly visitors from Russia and Georgia, as Ordu boasts some of the best beaches, rivers, and lush, green mountains on the Black Sea coast. Walking in the high pastures is now a popular excursion for Turkish holidaymakers. The higher altitudes are covered in forest.

Melet River, Bolaman River, Elekçi River, Turnasuyu Stream, Akçaova Stream and Civil Stream are the main rivers of the province. The topography of the province is not conducive to lake formation and only two major lakes, Gaga Lake and Ulugöl, are present in Ordu.

==Economy==
The economy of the province depends on agriculture. Ordu is famous for hazelnuts. Turkey as a whole produces about 70 percent of the world&#x27;s hazelnuts, and Ordu is the chief producer in Turkey, responsible for 150,000–180,000 tonnes per year, which amounts to around 30% of Turkey&#x27;s production. Hazelnuts production takes around 88% of Ordu&#x27;s arable land, the remainder mainly consists of corn and wheat fields. Whilst covering only 0.1% of the arable land of the province, Ordu&#x27;s kiwi production is the second largest in the country after Yalova. Beekeeping is also important in Ordu, which produced in 2010 12.8% of honey produced in Turkey.

==Demographics==
In recent decades many people from Ordu have migrated away to jobs in Bursa, Samsun, Sakarya, Istanbul (where almost 500,000 people of Ordu descendent live) or abroad (espacially to Austria).

<doc id="886778" wikidata="Q483481" url="?curid=886778" title="Rize Province">
<text>Rize Province () is a province of northeast Turkey, on the eastern Black Sea coast between Trabzon and Artvin. The province of Erzurum is to the south. Its area is 3,835 km2, and its population is 344,016 (2022). The capital is the city of Rize. It was formerly known as Lazistan, however the designation of the term of Lazistan was officially banned in 1926.

The province is home to Turkish, Laz, Hemshin and Georgian communities.

==Etymology==
The name comes from Greek (riza), meaning &quot;mountain slopes&quot;. The Georgian, Laz, and Armenian names also have Greek origins: their names in respective order are &quot;Rize&quot; (რიზე), &quot;Rizini&quot; (რიზინი), and &quot;Rize&quot; (Ռիզե).

==History==
===Pre-antiquity===

We have little information as to the prehistory of this region, which being covered in thick forest is difficult to excavate and reveals little. Colchis, which existed from the 13th to the 1st centuries BC, is regarded as an early proto-Georgian polity that may have reached this area.

===Antiquity===
According to Pliny the Elder, the Aegean Ancient Greek community of Miletus established a series of trading posts along the Black Sea coast in 670 BC, of which one was Rize. In the mid-6th century BC, the tribes living in the southern Colchis (Tibareni, Mossynoeci, Macrones, Moschi, and Marres) were incorporated into the nineteenth Satrapy of Persia.

The Achaemenid Empire was defeated by Alexander the Great, but following Alexander&#x27;s death, a number of separate kingdoms were established in Anatolia, including Pontus, in the corner of the south-eastern Black Sea, ruled by Mithridates. Rize was brought into the Kingdom of Pontus by Pharnaces in 180 BC. The small number of Hellenistic Greek inscriptions that have been found in Pontus suggest that Greek culture did not substantially extend beyond the coastal cities and the court. The kingdom was absorbed into the Roman Empire between 10 AD and 395 AD, when it passed to the Byzantines. By this time, writers such as Pliny and Arrian were describing the inhabitants as Laz.

===Medieval era===

During the medieval era, the region was under Byzantine control, and was mainly populated by Greeks and indigenous Lazs. During the reign of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I ( 527–565), the tribes of the interior, called Sannoi or Tzannoi, the ancestors of modern Laz people, were subdued, Christianized and brought to central rule. Locals began to have closer contact with the Greeks and acquired various Hellenic cultural traits, including in some cases the language. Locals were under nominal Byzantine suzerainty in the theme of Chaldia, with its capital at Trebizond, governed by native semi-autonomous rulers, like the Gabras family. In 790 AD, Armenians fleeing from the Arab invasion of Armenia settled in Hemshin and established the Principality of Hamamshen. Following the invasion of the Seljuk Turks, there was a larger influx of Armenians in the area, resulting in partial Armenization of the local Tzan population.

With the Georgian intervention in Chaldia and collapse of Byzantine Empire in 1204, the Empire of Trebizond was established along the southeastern coast of the Black Sea, populated by a large Lazian-speaking population. In the eastern part of the same empire, an autonomous coastal theme of Greater Lazia was established. Byzantine authors, such as Pachymeres, and to some extent Trapezuntines such as Lazaropoulos and Bessarion, regarded the Trapezuntian Empire as being merely a Lazian border state. Though Greek in higher culture, the rural areas of Trebizond empire appear to have been predominantly Laz in ethnic composition. Laz family names, with hellenized terminations, are noticeable in the records of the mediaeval empire of Trebizond.

In 1282, the kingdom of Imereti besieged Trebizond, however after the failed attempt to take the city, the Georgians occupied several provinces, and the Trebizontine province of Lazia threw off its allegiance to the king of the &#x27;Iberian&#x27; and &#x27;Lazian&#x27; tribes and united itself with the Georgian Kingdom of Imereti.

===The Ottoman era===

The Laz populated area was often contested by different Georgian principalities. Through the Battle of Murjakheti (1535), the Principality of Guria finally ensured control over the area until 1547, when it was conquered by resurgent Ottoman forces and reorganized into the Lazistan Sanjak as part of eyalet of Trabzon.

From the late-17th century onwards, the Ottoman administration built multiple bridges across the Fırtına River and its tributaries.

The province was a site of battles between Ottoman and Russian armies during the Caucasus Campaign of World War I, and was occupied by Russian forces in 1916–1918. It was returned to the Ottomans with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918.

Since 1924, Rize has been a province of the Republic of Turkey. Until tea plantations were established in the 1940s, the province was a poor area at the far end of the country, with only the Soviet Union beyond the Iron Curtain. Many generations of people in Rize left to look for jobs in Istanbul or overseas.

=== In Turkey ===
In September 1935, the third Inspectorate General (&quot;Umumi Müfettişlik,&quot; UM) was created, to which the Rize province was included. Its establishment was based on the Law 1164 from June 1927, which was passed in order to turkefy the population. The third UM spanned across the provinces of Erzurum, Artvin, Rize, Trabzon, Kars, Gümüşhane, Erzincan and Ağrı. It was governed by an Inspector General seated in the city of Erzurum. The Inspectorate General was dissolved in 1952 during the government of the Democrat Party.

===Life in Rize today===
The city of Rize is a coastal town on a narrow strip of flat land between the mountains and the sea. Today, the area is wealthier, although there is a marked difference between the lifestyle of the people in the relatively wealthy city of Rize and those in the remote villages where wooden houses perch on the steep mountainside with the rain beating down. The province is known in Turkey for the production of Rize tea.

==Geography==
Rize is located between the Pontic Mountains and the Black Sea. It is considered to be the &quot;wettest&quot; corner of Turkey and is the country&#x27;s main tea producing region. In addition to tea, the region is also known for growing kiwi fruit. The province is largely rural and very scenic, containing many mountain valleys and elevated &quot;yayla&quot;s (meadows). The district of Çamlıhemşin is one of Turkey&#x27;s most popular venues for trekking and outdoor holidays. Roads are scarce in some of the more remote regions, so electrical powered cable cars have been installed to transport people and supplies into the mountains. Summers are cool (July average 22 °C) and winters are mild (January average 7 °C) with high levels of precipitation all year long.

The new Black Sea coast road has made Rize more accessible, but has drawn criticism for its negative effect on the region&#x27;s wildlife. Since the early 2000s, Rize has seen an increase in visitors from outside the province, particularly tourist from urban areas. This increase in tourism has raised concerns among locals that the traditional way of life and the unblemished character of the natural surroundings is being endangered. The provincial governor, Enver Salihoglu (as of 2005) has stated his opposition to the expansion of the road network and has advocated a commercial focus on beekeeping, trout farming, and the growing of organic teas.

Native plants include the Cherry Laurel (), the fruit of which is an edible small dark plum that leaves a dark stain on the mouth and teeth. In addition, the Bilberry, which are now being actively cultivated, can be found growing the region. Rize is traversed by the northeasterly line of equal latitude and longitude.

===Geology===
Part of the Pontic Mountains (Eastern Black Sea Mts.), Rize was formed in the Palaeozoic period. Valleys first appeared during the Cretaceous period and have since expanded due to erosion.

===Climate===

The region&#x27;s climate is characterized by relatively mild to warm temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. The Köppen Climate Classification subtypes for this climate are &quot;Cfa&quot; (Humid Subtropical Climate) and &quot;Cfb&quot; (Oceanic Climate).

== Culture ==

===Cuisine===
The anchovy forms the basic for many of the dishes peculiar to the region. Soups, salads, pilafs and even desserts are made of anchovy. Some of the local dishes are hamsi buğulama (boiled anchovy), hamsi stew, and kamsi köfte (anchovy meatballs). Lahana çorbası (cabbage soup), muhlama (made of cheese, cornmeal and butter) and pides (pita bread topped with various fillings) are also other local delicacies.

=== Rize tea ===

Rize tea is a major agricultural product to the region and has changed the local economy. Rize Province is also one of the largest consumers of Rize tea too.

The province of Rize has prided itself of being the largest tea producer within Turkey. In 2021, the Rize Commerce Exchange started the construction of a seven-floor building in the shape of the traditional tulip-shaped tea glasses called &quot;ince belli,&quot; in hopes to boost local tourism&quot;.&quot;

===Folk dances and traditional costumes===
Folk dancers perform horon energetically when it is accompanied by kemenche. However this folk dance can also be accompanied by Tulum or kaval.

<text>Kars Province (; Azerbaijani: Qars Rayonu; ; ) is a province of Turkey, located in the northeastern part of the country. It shares part of its closed border with Armenia. Its area is 10,193 km2, and its population is 274,829 (2022). The provincial capital is the city of Kars. The provinces of Ardahan and Iğdır were part of Kars Province until 1992.

==History==
In ancient times, Kars () was part of the province of Ararat in the Kingdom of Armenia. The first known people were the followers of Vanand (Վանանդ), for whom Kars was their main settlement and fortress. In 928, Kars became the capital of Bagratid Armenia. In 968, the capital of Armenia was moved to Ani, but Kars remained the capital of the feudal principality of Vanand.

The Seljuks quickly relinquished direct control over Kars and it became a small emirate whose territory corresponded closely to that of Vanand, and which bordered the similarly created but larger Shaddadid emirate centered at Ani. The Kars emirate was a vassal of the Saltukids in Erzurum, whose forces were effective in opposing Georgian attempts at seizing Kars. Later on, in 1207, Georgian and Armenian forces commanded by David Soslan and brothers Ivane and Zakare Zakarian-Mkhargrzeli captured Kars after a long siege. It was a part of Zakarid Armenia, 
principality under rule of Zakarians–Mkhargrdzeli, vassals of Bagrationi dynasty of Georgia. George IV son of Tamar, was appointed as a viceroy of Kars. It was conquered in 1242 by the Mongols; was regained by Georgian Kingdom during the reign of George V the Brilliant (1314–1346) and remained as part of the Kingdom before its disintegration, which then passed into the hands of Georgian Atabegs belonging to the House of Jaqeli. During the rule of the Persian Empire and the Ottoman Empire, the fortress of Kars, located in what was then the eastern part of the city, fell into disrepair. However, as Kars was within a border region its defensive structures were often renewed, and they continued to advance to such a degree, that in the 19th century Kars was well known around the world as a castle.

As a result of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877 to 1878, the province of Kars was incorporated into the Russian Empire as part of the militarily administered Kars Oblast and remained so until 1918. It was seen as a border province of a Russian Empire which was seeking to expand yet further by the conquest of more territory belonging to the Ottoman Empire. The period from 1878 to 1918 was marked in the province of Kars by the settlement by the Russian authorities of a very heterogeneous mix of Christian populations, including Armenians, Caucasus Greeks, Russians, Georgians, and even smaller numbers from other Christian communities hitherto with little or no historical links to the region, such as ethnic Germans, Poles, Estonians, Lithuanians, and Russian sectarian communities such as Molokans and Doukhobors. Many from the non-Russian Christian Orthodox communities (Georgians, Caucasus Greeks, and the minority of Armenians who were Lessor Orthodox) had themselves fought in or collaborated with the Russian Imperial army to capture Kars province from the Muslim Ottomans. They saw this as a means of fulfilling their own ambitions to recapture Christian territory on the back of the Russian imperial enterprise.

=== As a part of Turkey ===
In September 1935 the third Inspectorate General (&quot;Umumi Müfettişlik,&quot; UM) was created. The Inspectorates Generals regions ruled with wide-ranging authority over the population in order to Turkify its population. The third UM span over the provinces of Erzurum, Artvin, Rize, Trabzon, Kars Gümüşhane, Erzincan and Ağrı. It was governed by an Inspector General seated in the city of Erzurum. The Inspectorate General was dissolved in 1952 during the Government of the Democrat Party.

==Kars nature, wildlife and ecotourism==

Kars has a wealth of wildlife that is being documented by the Kars-Iğdır Biodiversity Project run by the KuzeyDoğa Society. The project has recorded 356 of Turkey&#x27;s 486 bird species in the region, including Ardahan and Iğdır provinces that were formerly part of Kars. At least 233 of these occur at Lake Kuyucuk, that is the most important wetland in the region. Sarıkamış Forests in the south harbor Indian wolves, Syrian brown bear, Caucasian lynx and other animals, and Aras (Araxes) River wetlands comprise a key stop-over site for many migrating birds. Aras River Bird Research and Education Center at Yukarı Cıyrıklı village has recorded 303 bird species at this single location alone.

==Economy==
The economy of Kars Province is dominated by agriculture, livestock breeding and forestry. 85% of the active population in Kars Province are farmers or herders. 60% of the gross domestic income is received from those sectors. Industry, tourism and commerce is developing.

The climate limits the cultivation of plants in the region. In Kağızman and Tuzluca, cotton, sugar beet, beans and vetches are grown. Vegetable gardening and orchards are not very developed. Wheat, barley, cotton and in small quantity tobacco are grown in the province.

Livestock breeding in the region is more important than agriculture. Grassland, meadows and the rich vegetation led to the development of livestock breeding. The grassland and meadows, which make out 70% of the area of Kars Province, are capable of providing at least ten times of the current livestock potential&#x27;s breeding. Kars is the biggest cattle breeding province in Turkey, and is the center of livestock trade. Efforts are being made to increase goose breeding, which is very special to Kars region. Aside its meat taking a special place in the Kars cuisine, goose liver and down feather started already to be exported to Europe.

Kars Province is not abundant with woods although the region is favorable for forests. Only 4% of the province area is covered with woods. Scots Pine, spruce and alder are the tree species most found in the woods of Kars. Around timber is produced by logging in forestry.

Ore beds of rock salt, arsenic, asbestos, magnesite, gypsum and perlite are explored, however, only rock salt is mined.

Main industrial plants in Kars are of meat processing, livestock feed processing, gristmill, yarn, tannery, footwear, cement and brick factories.

==Cuisine==
Among the most famous food products special to Kars region are Kars honey, Kars Kasseri, Kars Gruyère cheese, which tastes like Swiss Emmental cheese, and Kars style roasted goose.

==Monuments==
Kars contains numerous monuments, the most notable being the ruined Armenian city of Ani and the 9th century Church of the Apostles.

==In popular culture==
Kars was the setting for the popular novel &quot;Snow&quot; by Orhan Pamuk.

&quot;The Siege of Kars, 1855&quot; is a book published by The Stationery Office, 2000, and is an account of its defence and capitulation as reported by one General Williams, one of many British officers lent to the Turkish army to lead garrisons and train regiments in the war against Russia.

In the book, Life and Times of Alexis Zorbas by Nikos Kazantzakis, Zorbas talks about his visit to the Kars province in order to find work and where he also attended an extravagant wedding in Kars.

<text>Monteverde is the twelfth canton of the Puntarenas province of Costa Rica, located in the Cordillera de Tilarán (Tilarán range). Roughly a four-hour drive from the Central Valley, Monteverde is one of the country&#x27;s major ecotourism destinations, with the Reserva Biológica Bosque Nuboso Monteverde (Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve) being the largest, in addition to several other natural attractions which draw considerable numbers of tourists and naturalists, both from Costa Rica and abroad.

&quot;National Geographic&quot; has called the Monteverde Cloud Forest &quot;the jewel in the crown of cloud forest reserves&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; ranked Monteverde the world&#x27;s No. 14 &quot;place to remember before it disappears&quot;; by popular vote in Costa Rica, Monteverde was deemed one of the seven natural wonders of the nation, along with Isla del Coco, Volcán Arenal, Cerro Chirripó, Río Celeste, Tortuguero, and Volcán Poás.

Santa Elena is the head town in the region, serving as the area&#x27;s principal tourist and visitors&#x27; hub. Together with the nearby neighborhood of Cerro Plano, and the community of Monteverde proper, visitors have diverse options for accommodations, dining, guided tours, and more when visiting the area&#x27;s numerous reserves and natural attractions.

==Toponymy==
&quot;Monteverde&quot; translates directly to &quot;green mountain&quot;, in English, a tribute to the region&#x27;s wealth of natural beauty. For comparison, the word&#x27;s French equivalent would be &quot;vermont&quot;—or &quot;montanha verde&quot; in Portuguese. Officially, the name is Monte Verde — written with two words.

==Climate==
Monteverde rests at roughly at above sea level, located in a lush, misty and wet, yet breezy and cool, spot in the mountains. The region&#x27;s mean annual temperature is (Nadkarni 2000: 17). Annual precipitation averages around , and ambient humidity oscillates between 74% and 97% (Nadkarni 2000: 34).

==History==

Various pre-Columbian artifacts testify to the existence of early populations of Clovis Native Americans, who once farmed in villages in the area and hunted the forests, ca. 3000 BC. From around 3300 BC to 2000 BC, nearby tribes of the Arenal area experienced a population decline, but re-established villages in the region between 2000 and 500 BC. Agriculture intensified in the centuries between 500 BC and 300 CE, with simple chiefdom societies replacing the formerly smaller, tribal settlements; some level of deforestation accompanied this rise in population, farming and horticulture. Early stone foundations dating to this period can also be found. Jade, and creating valuable objects with the stone, was a prized material and defining characteristic of these villages. From 300 to 800 CE, complex chiefdoms supplanted simpler chiefdoms as more intricate villages appeared; along with early modern examples of cemeteries, businesses and public squares, goldsmiths were seen as extremely valuable. intertribal trade and conflict. Around 1300, a general decline in population occurred, possibly due to the Arenal Volcano&#x27;s increased activity.

After the Spanish made landfall in 1502, Costa Rica endured two generations of warfare. Total indigenous populations in what is now Costa Rica fell drastically, from an estimated 400,000 pre-European contact to 80,000 within less than 50 years of contact. Countless innocent people lost their lives for a multitude of reasons, from deplorable living conditions brought about by enslavement (and harsh forced labor and servitude) to outright sadistic punishments, and even murder, of anyone who challenged the conquistadores. Many thousands more quickly succumbed to the vast array of Old World pathogens and infectious diseases that their systems had no immunity against, including diseases such as measles, influenza, chickenpox, bubonic plague, typhus, scarlet fever, pneumonia, syphilis and malaria. However, in a somewhat cruel &quot;twist of fate&quot;, unlike neighboring Nicaragua and Panama, Costa Rica did not yield considerable amounts of indigenous labor or mineral resources, and thus the region experienced colonization at a much slower rate than many other Spanish colonies.

===Early 20th century===

During the first three decades of the 20th century, from roughly 1900–1930, Creole populations arrived in small numbers to the area that is now Monteverde; many men worked within the Guacimal gold mines; many more, still, with their wives and families, provided these miners and their greater communities with needed goods and services. Some families also settled in the lower, warmer valley of nearby San Luís.

===1950s and forward===

What is now considered Monteverde was founded by Quakers from the United States whose pacifist values led them to defy the American draft before the Korean War. The majority of these settlers hailed from Fairhope, Alabama, and included some non-Quaker pacifists and conscientious objectors. The spokesman of the group was Hubert Mendenhall, a dairyman who had visited Costa Rica in 1949 as part of a farmer&#x27;s tour. These Quakers and pacifists chose the area for its cool climate, which would facilitate dairy farming, due to the country&#x27;s non-violent, army-free constitution, and its friendly Costa Rican inhabitants. The Quakers stewarded and farmed a large tract of land, part of which they eventually set aside for conservation, today the Reserva Biológica Bosque Nuboso Monteverde (Monteverde Cloud Forest Biological Reserve). This has become a major tourist attraction.

===2005 bank raid===
On March 8, 2005, a group of three armed Nicaraguan men raided and attempted to rob the Santa Elena branch of the state National Bank (&quot;Banco Nacional&quot;). A guard killed two of the armed men. However, one assailant held bank customers hostage for 28 hours. When authorities successfully attempted to retake the bank, a senior police officer and nine civilians died, and only one of the attackers survived. This event raised tensions between Nicaraguans and Costa Ricans nationwide and prompted higher security in many national banks.

===Canton creation===
As a district of Puntarenas canton, Monteverde had its own local government, a Municipal District Council, due to the long distance from the offices of the municipality of Puntarenas canton. As a result, its inhabitants pushed for Monteverde to become its own canton.

On 4 August 2021, the Legislative Assembly approved the file N.º 21618, which was then signed into law N.º 10019 by President Carlos Alvarado Quesada on 29 September 2021, which segregates the district from Puntarenas canton to become Monteverde canton. However, due to law N.º 6068 the change was deferred to after 3 April 2022 as it was not possible to change the Territorial Administrative Division fourteen months before elections, which was the case due to the second round of the 2022 Costa Rican general election held on that date.

The canton voted for its first municipal government and mayor in the 2024 Costa Rican municipal elections. PRSC won the local election.

===Today===

In recent years, the area&#x27;s rapidly increasing numbers of tourists has brought a sizable influx of Costa Ricans from other towns and cities. Now, an estimated 250,000 tourists visit Monteverde a year. Improved goods and services, including partially paved roads, have arrived in recent years. In 2007, Costa Ricans voted Monteverde one of Costa Rica&#x27;s Seven Wonders, along with Isla del Coco, Tortuguero, Arenal Volcano, Cerro Chirripó, Rio Celeste and Poás Volcano.

== Geography ==
The district of Monteverde has an area of km2 and an average elevation of metres.

==Administrative territorial division==
The canton of Monteverde is subdivided into only one district, occupying the same area as the whole canton:
# Monteverde, with postal code 61201

Santa Elena is the head town (). The district also includes the neighborhoods and towns of Cerro Plano, Cuesta Blanca, La Lindora, Los Llanos, Monte Verde and San Luis.

==Demographics==

According to the 2011 census, Monteverde had a population of inhabitants.

The official and most-spoken language is Spanish, as in the majority of Costa Rica. However, English-Spanish bilingualism is widespread due to the presence of Quakers and three bilingual schools.

==Education==
The area has several public grade and middle schools. These include the Escuela Santa Elena, the Escuela Cerro Plano, and two schools in San Luis. The Colegio San Rafael and Colegio Técnico Professional (also known as the Colegio Santa Elena) are responsible for the majority of secondary education in the area.

Private education is fairly robust in the Monteverde region. In 1951, the Quakers constructed a Quaker Meeting house, which served as classrooms and a general store. This became known as Monteverde Friends School (MFS) and today offers bilingual education to Pre-K through 12th grade to roughly 120 students.

A larger, non-Quaker bilingual (English/Spanish) institution, the Cloud Forest School, founded in 1991, now enrolls roughly 200 students from Pre-K through 11th grade, over 90% of whom are Costa Ricans. The CFS is accredited by the government of Costa Rica and over 50% of its graduates pursue higher education.

The small private Adventist school, the Escuela Adventista, is also bilingual.

While there is only one institution of higher education in Monteverde, the Distance State University (UNED), the region is home to a considerable number of local and foreign undergraduate and graduate programs. These include the Monteverde Institute, EAP, CIEE, and the University of Georgia (see below). Most residents of Monteverde pursue higher education in the Central Valley at institutions such as the University of Costa Rica.

Monteverde is also home to a substantial number of foreign-born scientists. A long-term resident of the town is the former lead guitarist of British new wave band Japan, Robert Dean, working as a professional ornithology writer.

== Transportation ==
=== Road transportation ===
The district is connected to and transversed by the following road routes:
* National Route 606
* National Route 619
* National Route 620

==Economy==

===Agriculture===

Agriculture has historically been the area&#x27;s main source of income and sustenance for both Costa Ricans and Quakers. The original Creole populations relied mostly on subsistence agriculture and trade with the mining town of Guacimal. Initially locals hunted tapirs, deer, pacas, monkeys, and birds, but diminished those populations. They turned to pigs, corn, beans, vegetables, fruits, herbs and livestock. In the 1950s, both Quakers and Costa Ricans produced garlic, beef, flax, and homestead cheese. Quakers took advantages of the infrastructure improvements of the 1960s and exported cheese and beef to the rest of the country. However, due to overgrazing, the dairy industry declined in the 1970s. This led the population to turn to coffee. By the mid-1990s, coffee farmers were receiving some of the highest prices in the world for their coffee beans. In the mid-1990s 210 families were contributing milk to the local dairy factory, with a revenue of $5.2 million.

===Tourism===

Tourism is a growing sector in Monteverde&#x27;s economy. In 1975, the region received fewer than one hundred visitors. This increased to around 50,000 in the mid-1990s. In recent years, the average has risen to 250,000 yearly tourists. Hotels, taxis, guides, and other tourist-geared services have operated since the early 1990s.

==Places of interest==
===Nature===

Due to the area&#x27;s cloud forests and rain forests (including seven different ecological life zones), Monteverde has become a major part of the Costa Rican tourist trail – despite difficult access. Readers of the country&#x27;s leading newspaper &quot;La Nación&quot; voted it one of the &quot;7 Wonders of Costa Rica&quot;. Of Monteverde&#x27;s quarter-million annual tourists, around 70,000 tourists visit the reserve.

The bulk of Monteverde&#x27;s cloud forest can be found in the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve. The area around the park entrance is the most visited, and features six main trails, which total 13 km, are well-kept and easy to access. The reserve features a large network of less-accessible trails and a number of research stations, two of which house ten persons each, as well as one larger station that can house as many as forty-three persons, though these are now restricted to use by researchers only.

To the east of Monteverde lies the Children&#x27;s Eternal Rainforest (El Bosque Eterno de los Niños) conservation area, a project funded by schools and children from all over the world. The Bosque Eterno is the largest preserve in the area with . Farther north is the Reserva Santa Elena. This area attracts fewer tourists than the Monteverde Reserve, but offers a field station and views of Arenal Volcano.

===Preserve===

The massive Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve is the region&#x27;s main draw, due largely to its excellent virgin and semi-virgin environment and world-class biodiversity. Scientists have determined this region to be home to the planet&#x27;s largest number of orchids, at 500, with 34 being recent discoveries. Fifty-eight species of amphibians, including the extinct Monteverde-endemic golden toad, have been found here. This area is also a stop for ninety-one species of migratory birds. The famed quetzal resides here seasonally. Monteverde&#x27;s one-hundred-and-thirty-four mammal species include representatives from both North and South America, including six species of marsupials, three muskrats, at least fifty-eight bats, three primates, seven edentates, two rabbits, one ground hog, three species of squirrels, one species of spiny mouse, at least fifteen species of long-tailed rats and mice (family Muridae), one species of porcupine, one species of agouti, one paca, two canids, five mustelids, four species of procyonids, six species of felines, two species of wild pigs, two species of deer, and one tapir.

===UGA Costa Rica===

The University of Georgia uses a 155-acre satellite campus outside of the Monteverde region in the lower San Luis community. UGA Costa Rica operates numerous study abroad programs, ecological and forestry research, as well as ecotourism via on-campus lodging, the Ecolodge San Luis. Additionally, UGA Costa Rica is responsible for various conservation and sustainability initiatives in the San Luis Valley, namely its Carbon Offset Program and reforestation efforts in the Pájaro Campana Biological Corridor. In May 2019, ownership of the campus was transferred to CIEE (Council on International Educational Exchange), which only hosts University of Georgia and other academic groups, not tourists.

<text>Çanakkale Province () is a province of Turkey, located in the northwestern part of the country. It takes its name from the city of Çanakkale. Its area is 9,817 km2, and its population is 559,383 (2022).

Like Istanbul, Çanakkale province has a European (Thrace) and an Asian (Anatolia) part. The European part is formed by the Gallipoli (Gelibolu) peninsula, while the Asian part is largely coterminous with the historic region of Troad in Anatolia. They are separated by the Dardanelles strait, connecting the Sea of Marmara and the Aegean Sea.

The archaeological site of Troy is found in the Çanakkale province, near the village Tevfikiye.

Çanakkale District is the most populous district of the province. The European and Asian parts of the province were connected to each other with the completion of the Çanakkale 1915 Bridge in March 2022.

==History==
In the early Turkish Republic, the Çanakkale Province came into existence with the abolition of the Ottoman-era &quot;sanjaks&quot; of Biga and Gelibolu. According to a population census in 1927, Çanakkale had 8,500 inhabitants, except its neighbouring villages. It is recorded that Çanakkale, which was also called as &quot;Hellespontos&quot; and &quot;Dardanelles&quot; in ancient times, has accommodated many civilizations for about 3,000 years. Even the Archaic Troy (Troia) city, formerly governed by Lydians and destroyed by the devastating earthquake in 2500 BC, has ruins surviving to today. In 336 BC, the Persian Empire, which became the crucial power in Anatolia, was conquered by Alexander the Great. Also with the ruin of the Anatolian beylik of Karesi, most of the territory of Çanakkale was conquered in the Ottoman era, with the assistance of the castles in remuneration for helping to Byzantine Empire, locating Gelibolu. Afterwards, the Çanakkale strait was given to the Ottoman Empire.

The province was included in the Second Inspectorate General on the 19 February 1934 which span over the provinces of Edirne, Çanakkale, Kırklareli, Tekirdağ. It was ruled by an Inspector General who had wide-ranging authorities over civilian, military and educational matters. The office of the Inspectorate-General was abandoned in 1948 but the legal framework of the Inspectorate-Generals was only abolished in 1952, under the Government of the Democrat Party.

==Agriculture==
The province of Çanakkale is a notable region for viticulture and winemaking in Turkey. The region between Saros Gulf and Gelibolu on the Gallipoli peninsula is cultivated with vineyards. Wine producer &quot;Suvla&quot; is located in Suvla.

==Environment==
 several of the country&#x27;s coal fired power stations are here, some with smokestack filters which do not meet regulations.

== Districts ==

Çanakkale province is divided into 12 districts, including the capital district Çanakkale (or Merkez):

<text>Under the Constitution of the Philippines, the president of the Philippines () is both the head of state and government, and serves as the commander-in-chief of the country&#x27;s armed forces. The president is directly elected by qualified voters to a six-year term and must be &quot;a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, a registered voter, able to read and write, at least forty years of age on the day of the election, and a resident of the Philippines for at least ten years immediately preceding such election&quot;. No elected president can seek re-election. Upon resignation, or removal from the office, the vice president assumes the post. A president&#x27;s successor who hasn&#x27;t served for more than four years can still seek a full term for the presidency.

==History==
Emilio Aguinaldo became the inaugural president of the Philippines under the Malolos Republic, which was considered the First Philippine Republic. He held that office until 1901 when he was captured by United States forces during the Philippine–American War (1899–1902). The American colonization of the Philippines abolished the First Republic, which led to an American governor-general exercising executive power.

In 1935, the United States, pursuant to its promise of full Philippine sovereignty, established the Commonwealth of the Philippines following the ratification of the 1935 Constitution, which also restored the presidency. The first national presidential election was held, and Manuel L. Quezon (1935–44) was elected to a six-year term with no provision for re-election as the second Philippine president and the first Commonwealth president. In 1940, however, the Constitution was amended to allow re-election but shortened the term to four years. However, a change in the government occurred three years later when the Second Philippine Republic was organized with the enactment of the 1943 Constitution, which Japan imposed after the occupied the Philippines in 1942 during World WarII. José P. Laurel acted as puppet president of the new Japanese-sponsored government; his &quot;de facto&quot; presidency, not legally recognized until the 1960s, overlapped with that of the president of the Commonwealth, which went into exile. The Second Republic was dissolved after the Japan surrendered to the Allies in 1945; the Commonwealth was then restored in the Philippines in the same year with the election of Sergio Osmeña (1944–46) as president.

Manuel Roxas (1946–1948) then followed Osmeña when he won the first post-war election in 1946. He became the first president of the independent Philippines when the Commonwealth ended on July4 of that year. The Third Republic was ushered in and would cover the administrations of the next five presidents, the last of which was Ferdinand Marcos (1965–86), who performed a self-coup by imposing martial law in 1972. The dictatorship of Marcos saw the birth of the New Society () and the Fourth Republic. His tenure lasted until 1986 when he was deposed in the People Power Revolution. The current constitution came into effect in 1987, marking the beginning of the Fifth Republic.

Of the individuals elected as president, three died in office: two of natural causes (Manuel L. Quezon and Manuel Roxas) and one in a plane crash (Ramon Magsaysay, 1953–57). The longest-serving president is Ferdinand Marcos with in office; he is the only president to have served more than two terms. The shortest is Sergio Osmeña, who spent in office.

Two women have held the office: Corazon Aquino (1986–92), who ascended to the presidency upon the successful People Power Revolution of 1986, and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (2001–10), who, as vice president, ascended to the presidency upon Estrada&#x27;s resignation and was elected to a full six-year term in 2004.

==Presidents==
=== Timeline ===

== Unofficial presidents ==
Andrés Bonifacio is considered by some historians to be the first president of the Philippines. He was the third Supreme President (Spanish: &quot;Presidente Supremo&quot;; Tagalog: &quot;Kataastaasang Pangulo&quot;) of the &quot;Katipunan&quot; secret society. Its Supreme Council, led by the Supreme President, coordinated provincial and district councils. When the &quot;Katipunan&quot; went into open revolt in August 1896 (the Cry of Balintawak), Bonifacio transformed it into a revolutionary government with him as president. While the term &quot;Katipunan&quot; remained, Bonifacio&#x27;s government was also known as the Tagalog Republic (Tagalog: &quot;Republika ng Katagalugan&quot;; Spanish: &quot;Republica Tagala&quot;). (Although the word &quot;Tagalog&quot; refers to a specific ethnicity, Bonifacio used it to denote all indigenous people in the Philippines in place of &quot;Filipino&quot; which had colonial origins.)

Some historians contend that including Bonifacio as a past president would imply that Macario Sakay and Miguel Malvar y Carpio should also be included. Miguel Malvar y Carpio continued Emilio Aguinaldo&#x27;s leadership of the First Philippine Republic after the latter&#x27;s capture until his own capture in 1902. Macario Sakay revived the Tagalog Republic in 1902 as a continuation of Bonifacio&#x27;s Katipunan. They are still both considered by some scholars as &quot;unofficial presidents&quot;. Along with Bonifacio, Malvar and Sakay are not recognized as presidents by the Philippine government.

Emilio Aguinaldo is officially recognized as the first president of the Philippines, but this is based on his term of office during the Malolos Republic, later known as the First Philippine Republic. Prior to this Aguinaldo had held the presidency of several revolutionary governments which are not counted in the succession of Philippine republics.

Manuel L. Quezon delegated his presidential duties to José Abad Santos, the then Chief Justice, when the former fled the Philippines amidst Japanese occupation of the islands to establish a government-in-exile. He is believed to have in effect become the acting president of the Philippine Commonwealth though no legal document has been retrieved detailing the official transfer of the title of President to Abad Santos.

<text>Mount Bierstadt is a mountain summit in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, in the U.S. state of Colorado. The fourteener is located in the Mount Evans Wilderness of Pike National Forest, south by east (bearing 171°) of the Town of Georgetown in Clear Creek County. It was named in honor of Albert Bierstadt, an American landscape painter who made the first recorded summit of the mountain in 1863.

==Mountain==
Mount Bierstadt is located WSW of Mount Blue Sky and WSW of downtown Denver.

Mount Bierstadt is one of the most popular mountains to climb in Colorado due to its proximity to Denver and non-technical reputation. As with most peaks in Colorado, July and August make the best months for climbing Mount Bierstadt.

The most popular base from which to begin ascent of Mount Bierstadt is Guanella Pass, located to the west. From Guanella Pass it is approximately a hike, with a climb of . The trail descends slightly into the fairly level marshlands surrounding Scott Gomer Creek before reaching Bierstadt&#x27;s western slopes. It then begins a cairn-marked ascent to a relatively flat area just below the main summit block, which is rated Class 2.

Once at the summit, a popular option is to continue the hike to nearby Mount Blue Sky along a ridge known as The Sawtooth, an intermediate-level hike that overlooks Abyss Lake, which occupies the bottom of the valley separating Bierstadt and Blue Sky. This route is rated as class 3.

Albert Bierstadt&#x27;s painting &quot;A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Rosalie&quot; is based on sketches he made during his 1863 visit to the area. That painting shows either Mount Spalding or Mount Blue Sky (it is ambiguous) from the Chicago Lakes, north-northwest, but Bierstadt and his guide William Byers climbed onward to the summit of either Blue Sky or Spalding (the account is ambiguous).

<text>Intertextuality is the shaping of a text&#x27;s meaning by another text, either through deliberate compositional strategies such as quotation, allusion, calque, plagiarism, translation, pastiche or parody, or by interconnections between similar or related works perceived by an audience or reader of the text. These references are sometimes made deliberately and depend on a reader&#x27;s prior knowledge and understanding of the referent, but the effect of intertextuality is not always intentional and is sometimes inadvertent. Often associated with strategies employed by writers working in imaginative registers (fiction, poetry, and drama and even non-written texts like performance art and digital media), intertextuality may now be understood as intrinsic to any text.

Intertextuality has been differentiated into referential and typological categories. Referential intertextuality refers to the use of fragments in texts and the typological intertextuality refers to the use of pattern and structure in typical texts. A distinction can also be made between iterability and presupposition. Iterability makes reference to the &quot;repeatability&quot; of certain text that is composed of &quot;traces&quot;, pieces of other texts that help constitute its meaning. Presupposition makes a reference to assumptions a text makes about its readers and its context. As philosopher William Irwin wrote, the term &quot;has come to have almost as many meanings as users, from those faithful to Julia Kristeva&#x27;s original vision to those who simply use it as a stylish way of talking about allusion and influence&quot;.

==History==

Julia Kristeva coined the term &quot;intertextuality&quot; (&quot;intertextualité&quot;) in an attempt to synthesize Ferdinand de Saussure&#x27;s semiotics: his study of how signs derive their meaning from the structure of a text (Bakhtin&#x27;s dialogism); his theory suggests a continual dialogue with other works of literature and other authors; and his examination of the multiple meanings, or &quot;heteroglossia&quot;, of texts (especially novels) or individual words. According to Kristeva, &quot;the notion of intertextuality replaces the notion of intersubjectivity&quot; when we realize that meaning is not transferred directly from writer to reader but is instead mediated or filtered by &quot;codes&quot; imparted to the writer and reader by other texts. For example, when we read James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; we decode it as a modernist literary experiment or as a response to the epic tradition, or as part of some other conversation, or as part of many conversations at once. This intertextual view of literature, as shown by Roland Barthes, supports the concept that the meaning of a text does not reside in the text, but is produced by the reader in relation both to the text in question and the complex network of texts evoked by the reading process.

While the theoretical concept of intertextuality is associated with post-modernism, the device itself is not new. New Testament passages quote from the Old Testament and Old Testament books such as Deuteronomy or the prophets refer to the events described in Exodus (for discussions on using &#x27;intertextuality&#x27; to describe the use of the Old Testament in the New Testament, see Porter 1997; Oropeza 2013; Oropeza &amp; Moyise, 2016). Whereas a redaction critic would use such intertextuality to argue for a particular order and process of the authorship of the books in question, literary criticism takes a synchronic view that deals with the texts in their final form, as an interconnected body of literature. This interconnected body extends to later poems and paintings that refer to Biblical narratives, just as other texts build networks around Greek and Roman Classical history and mythology.

=== Post-structuralism ===
More recent post-structuralist theory, such as that formulated in Daniela Caselli&#x27;s &quot;Beckett&#x27;s Dantes: Intertextuality in the Fiction and Criticism&quot; (MUP 2005), re-examines &quot;intertextuality&quot; as a production within texts, rather than as a series of relationships between different texts. Some postmodern theorists like to talk about the relationship between &quot;intertextuality&quot; and &quot;hypertextuality&quot; (not to be confused with hypertext, another semiotic term coined by Gérard Genette); intertextuality makes each text a &quot;living hell of hell on earth&quot; and part of a larger mosaic of texts, just as each hypertext can be a web of links and part of the whole World-Wide Web. The World-Wide Web has been theorized as a unique realm of reciprocal intertextuality, in which no particular text can claim centrality, yet the Web text eventually produces an image of a community—the group of people who write and read the text using specific discursive strategies.

== Examples in literature ==
Some examples of intertextuality in literature include:
* Perhaps the earliest example of a non-anonymous author alluding to another is when Euripides, in his &quot;Electra&quot; (410s BC), spoofs (in lines 524-38) the recognition scene from Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot;.
* &quot;The House of Asterion&quot; (1947) by Jorge Luis Borges: A retelling of the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur told from the perspective of Asterion, the Minotaur.
* &quot;East of Eden&quot; (1952) by John Steinbeck: A retelling of the account of Genesis, set in the Salinas Valley of Northern California.
* &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922) by James Joyce: A retelling of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, set in Dublin.
* &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; (1936) by William Faulkner: A retelling of the Absalom story from Samuel, set in antebellum Mississippi.
* &quot;Earthly Powers&quot; (1980) by Anthony Burgess: A retelling of Anatole France&#x27;s &quot;Le Miracle du grand saint Nicolas&quot; during the 20th century.
* &quot;The Dead Fathers Club&quot; (2006) by Matt Haig: A retelling of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, set in modern England.
* &quot;A Thousand Acres&quot; (1991) by Jane Smiley: A retelling of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;, set in rural Iowa.
* &quot;Perelandra&quot; (1943) by C. S. Lewis: Another retelling of the account of Genesis, also leaning on Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, but set on the planet Venus.
* &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; (1966) by Jean Rhys: A metatextual intervention on Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, the story of the &quot;mad woman in the attic&quot; told from her perspective.
* &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot; (1996) by Steven Pressfield: A retelling of the Bhagavad Gita, set in 1931 during an epic golf game.
* &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1996) by Helen Fielding: A modern &quot;chick lit&quot; romantic comedy replaying and referencing Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.
* &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; (1935) by John Steinbeck: A retelling of the Arthurian legends, set in Monterey, California, during the interwar period.
* &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; (1931) by Eugene O&#x27;Neill: A retelling of Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;The Oresteia&quot;, set in post-American Civil War New England.
* &quot;The Gospel of Matthew&quot; narrates the early years of the life of Jesus while following a pattern from the Hebrew Bible&#x27;s Book of Exodus.
* &quot;Frankissstein&quot; (2019) by Jeanette Winterson: A retelling of Mary Shelley&#x27;s 1818 classic &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, examining updated issues of the monstrous, i.e. sex-bots and cryonics.

=== Related concepts ===
Linguist Norman Fairclough states that &quot;intertextuality is a matter of recontextualization&quot;. According to Per Linell, recontextualization can be defined as the &quot;dynamic transfer-and-transformation of something from one discourse/text-in-context ... to another&quot;. Recontextualization can be relatively explicit—for example, when one text directly quotes another—or relatively implicit—as when the &quot;same&quot; generic meaning is rearticulated across different texts.

A number of scholars have observed that recontextualization can have important ideological and political consequences. For instance, Adam Hodges has studied how White House officials recontextualized and altered a military general&#x27;s comments for political purposes, highlighting favorable aspects of the general&#x27;s utterances while downplaying the damaging aspects. Rhetorical scholar Jeanne Fahnestock has found that when popular magazines recontextualize scientific research they enhance the uniqueness of the scientific findings and confer greater certainty on the reported facts. Similarly, John Oddo stated that American reporters covering Colin Powell&#x27;s 2003 U.N. speech transformed Powell&#x27;s discourse as they recontextualized it, bestowing Powell&#x27;s allegations with greater certainty and warrantability and even adding new evidence to support Powell&#x27;s claims.

Oddo has also argued that recontextualization has a future-oriented counterpoint, which he dubs &quot;precontextualization&quot;. According to Oddo, precontextualization is a form of anticipatory intertextuality wherein &quot;a text introduces and predicts elements of a symbolic event that is yet to unfold&quot;. For example, Oddo contends, American journalists anticipated and previewed Colin Powell&#x27;s U.N. address, drawing his future discourse into the normative present.

===Allusion===
While intertextuality is a complex and multileveled literary term, it is often confused with the more casual term &#x27;allusion&#x27;. Allusion is a passing or casual reference; an incidental mention of something, either directly or by implication. This means it is most closely linked to both obligatory and accidental intertextuality, as the &#x27;allusion&#x27; made relies on the listener or viewer knowing about the original source. It is also seen as accidental, however, as the allusion is normally a phrase so frequently or casually used that the true significance is not fully appreciated. Allusion is most often used in conversation, dialogue or metaphor. For example, &quot;I was surprised his nose was not growing like Pinocchio&#x27;s.&quot; This makes a reference to &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;, written by Carlo Collodi when the little wooden puppet lies. If this was obligatory intertextuality in a text, multiple references to this (or other novels of the same theme) would be used throughout the hypertext.

==Plagiarism==

Sociologist Perry Share describes intertextuality as &quot;an area of considerable ethical complexity&quot;. Intertextuality does not necessarily involve citations or referencing punctuation (such as quotation marks) and can be mistaken for plagiarism.
While the two concepts are related, the intentions behind using another&#x27;s work is critical in distinguishing the two. When making use of intertextuality, usually a small excerpt of a hypotext assists in the understanding of the new hypertext&#x27;s original themes, characters, or contexts. Aspects of existing texts are reused, often resulting in new meaning when placed in a different context. Intertextuality hinges on the creation of new ideas, while plagiarism attempts to pass off existing work as one&#x27;s own.

Students learning to write often rely on imitation or emulation and have not yet learned how to reformulate sources and cite them according to expected standards, and thus engage in forms of &quot;patchwriting,&quot; which may be inappropriately penalized as intentional plagiarism. Because the interests of writing studies differ from the interests of literary theory, the concept has been elaborated differently with an emphasis on writers using intertextuality to position their statement in relation to other statements and prior knowledge. Students often find it difficult to learn how to combine referencing and relying on others&#x27; words with marking their novel perspective and contribution.

== Non-literary uses ==
In addition, the concept of intertextuality has been used analytically outside the sphere of literature and art. For example, Devitt (1991) examined how the various genres of letters composed by tax accountants refer to the tax codes in genre-specific ways. In another example, Christensen (2016) introduces the concept of intertextuality to the analysis of work practice at a hospital. The study shows that the ensemble of documents used and produced at a hospital department can be said to form a corpus of written texts. On the basis of the corpus, or subsections thereof, the actors in cooperative work create intertext between relevant (complementary) texts in a particular situation, for a particular purpose. The intertext of a particular situation can be constituted by several kinds of intertextuality, including the complementary type, the intratextual type and the mediated type. In this manner the concept of intertext has had an impact beyond literature and art studies.

In scientific and other scholarly writing intertextuality is core to the collaborative nature of knowledge building and thus citation practices are important to the social organization of fields, the codification of knowledge, and the reward system for professional contribution. Scientists can be skillfully intentional in the use of references to prior work in order to position the contribution of their work. Modern practices of scientific citation, however, have only developed since the late eighteenth century and vary across fields, in part influenced by disciplines’ epistemologies.

<doc id="886827" wikidata="Q7942106" url="?curid=886827" title="Vote-by-mail in Oregon">
<text>The U.S. state of Oregon established vote-by-mail as the standard mechanism for voting with Ballot Measure 60, a citizen&#x27;s initiative, in 1998. The measure made Oregon the first state in the United States to conduct its elections exclusively by mail. The measure passed on November 3, 1998, by a margin of 69.4% to 30.6%. Political scientists say Oregon&#x27;s vote by mail system contributes to its highest-in-the-nation rate of voter turnout, at 61.5% of eligible voters.

==History of postal voting in Oregon==
Vote-by-mail had already been implemented to a lesser degree in Oregon:
*1981 The Oregon Legislative Assembly approves vote-by-mail for local elections, at the discretion of the county; at least one polling place in the county had to remain open on election day. The move came after efforts by Del Riley, the County Clerk for Linn County.
*1987 Vote-by-mail becomes permanent, with the majority of Oregon&#x27;s counties making use of it.
*1989 A House bill to extend vote-by-mail to include the 1990 primary elections was defeated in a 33–27, non-party-line vote.
* 1992 Governor&#x27;s Task Force on Local Government Services identifies statewide vote-by-mail as one of the most significant opportunities to save money on conducting elections.
*1995 Oregon becomes the first state to conduct a federal primary election totally by mail.
*1996 U.S Senator Ron Wyden is elected by mail with a 66% turnout, succeeding Bob Packwood. &quot;
*1998 Oregonians confirm their overwhelming support for vote-by-mail by passing Measure 60.
*2000 Oregon becomes the first state in the nation to conduct a presidential election entirely by mail. About 80% of registered voters participated.
*2019 Oregon becomes the first state not to require paid postage on ballot return envelopes.

Measure 60 eliminated restrictions on vote-by-mail and established it as the single form of voting for elections in Oregon. It also required vote-by-mail to be used for biennial primaries and general elections as well as eliminating polling places.

==Supporters==
Organizations which supported the initiative included the League of Women Voters of Oregon, the Oregon League of Conservation Voters, AARP of Oregon, and Oregon Education Association. Individuals which supported the measure included then-Governor John Kitzhaber, Oregon Secretary of State Phil Keisling, and former U.S. Senator Mark Hatfield. Supporters of the measure asserted that it would increase voter participation and make elections more convenient for voters. The State of Oregon would also save an estimated $3 million a year, in years which a primary and general election occur.

==Opponents==
Notable opposition to the measure included State Representative Lynn Snodgrass and anti-tax activist Bill Sizemore. Opponents claimed the system would invite election fraud as well as the possibility of people pressuring each other in terms of how they vote.

==Lasting popularity==
Vote-by-mail in Oregon has maintained a high level of support since it was passed in 1998. A survey done in 2003 by Dr. Priscilla Southwell, a professor of Political Science at University of Oregon, shows that 81% of respondents favored the vote-by-mail system while 19% favored traditional voting at poll booths. The poll also shows high favorability among registered Democrats (85%) and registered Republicans (76%) alike. Thirty percent of respondents said they voted more often since vote-by-mail was enacted.

<text>Minnie Marx (born Miene Schönberg, 9 November 1864 – 13 September 1929) was the mother and manager of the Marx Brothers, a family of top-billed vaudevillians, top Broadway stars and, finally, film stars. She was also the sister of comedian and vaudeville star Al Shean.

==Early life==
Marx was born Miene Schönberg in Dornum, Kingdom of Hanover. Her parents Fanny née Salomons (1829–April 10,1901) and Levy &quot;Lafe&quot; Schönberg (1823–1919) were members of the local Jewish community. Her mother was a yodeling harpist, her father a ventriloquist. Her younger brother, Abraham Elieser Adolf, the future &quot;Al Shean,&quot; was born in 1868.
About 1880 the family immigrated to New York City, where Minnie married Samuel &quot;Frenchie&quot; Marx in 1884.

Her son Manfred died in infancy in 1886. Her other children were Leonard Joseph (born 1887), Adolph (1888), Julius (1890), Milton (1892) and Herbert (1901), who would grow up to perform as the Marx Brothers.

==Career==
While managing the Marx Brothers, she went under the name of Minnie Palmer, so that booking agents would not know that the agent representing the Marx Brothers was their mother. She played the harp.

As a tribute to her, all the brothers&#x27; daughters were given names that began with &#x27;M&#x27;: Chico with Maxine; Harpo with Minnie; and Groucho with Miriam and Melinda. Gummo and Zeppo had no daughters.

Minnie lived long enough to see her sons&#x27; 1929 film debut in &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot;, but died later that year of a stroke.

==Death==
Marx died from a stroke on September 13, 1929, aged 64. She was buried at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Glendale, Queens. When her husband died four years later, he was buried next to her.

==In popular culture==
Marx and some of her sons appear briefly as characters in Glen David Gold&#x27;s novel &quot;Carter Beats the Devil&quot;; the narrative identifies her as Minnie Palmer, and only gradually offers clues that the struggling vaudeville act traveling with her are the later-famous Marx Brothers. Marx (played by Shelley Winters) was also the main character in the stage musical &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Boys&quot;.

<doc id="886839" wikidata="Q1721737" url="?curid=886839" title="Resistentialism">
<text>Resistentialism is a jocular theory to describe &quot;seemingly spiteful behavior manifested by inanimate objects&quot;, where objects that cause problems (like lost keys, a malfunctioning printer, or a runaway bouncy ball) are said to exhibit a high degree of malice toward humans. The theory posits a war being fought between humans and inanimate objects, and all the little annoyances that objects cause throughout the day are battles between the two. The concept was not new in 1948 when humorist Paul Jennings coined this name for it in a piece titled &quot;Report on Resistentialism&quot;, published in &quot;The Spectator&quot; that year and reprinted in &quot;The New York Times&quot;; the word is a blend of the Latin &quot;res&quot; (&quot;thing&quot;), the French &quot;résister&quot; (&quot;to resist&quot;), and the existentialism school of philosophy. The movement is a spoof of existentialism in general, and Jean-Paul Sartre in particular, Jennings naming the fictional inventor of Resistentialism as Pierre-Marie Ventre. The slogan of Resistentialism is &quot;Les choses sont contre nous&quot; (&quot;Things are against us&quot;).

==Similar concepts==
As discussed regarding the history of Murphy&#x27;s law and of similar laws or corollaries such as Finagle&#x27;s law and Sod&#x27;s law, the perceived perversity of the universe has long been a subject of comment, and the concept may be as old as humanity. Examples from literature include the following:
* The autobiography of American businessman A.B. Farquhar records that soon after he first came to York, Pennsylvania, in 1856, one of the friends he met there &quot;was reading in a magazine an article that set up the natural perversity of inanimate things. I entered into an argument with her. I urged that Nature was not cruel but kind, and that there was no perversity.&quot; 
* Friedrich Theodor Vischer (1807–1887), in his novel &quot;Auch Einer&quot;, first published in 1879, developed the concept of &quot;Die Tücke des Objekts&quot; (the spite of the object), a comic theory that inanimate objects conspire against humans.
* M. R. James (1862–1936), in his horror short story &quot;The Malice of Inanimate Objects&quot;, first published in 1933, prefigures Jennings&#x27; theories, but suggests a more sinister aspect to the phenomenon involving supernatural sentience and malevolence.
* In the 1920s Theodore M. Bernstein formulated what he jocularly called Bernstein&#x27;s first law, which is that small dropped objects, such as cufflinks, will be found only in the place most inaccessible for retrieval.
* Writing in 1942, Louise Dickinson Rich mentioned the idea in a way plainly suggesting that it was not novel. Describing efforts to clear ground of brush and large stones for vegetable growing, she said facetiously, &quot;I do believe in the malevolence of the inanimate, and of all inanimate objects, stones are the most malevolent.&quot;
* Resistentialism is the basis for the poem &quot;Nightmare Number Three&quot; by Stephen Vincent Benét, which was dramatized by George Lefferts for the 1950s radio drama series &quot;X Minus One&quot;.
* In Clifford D. Simak&#x27;s science fiction short story &quot;Skirmish&quot;, first published in 1950, machines start to become self-aware and revolt against human control.
* In Avram Davidson&#x27;s science fiction short story &quot;Or All the Seas with Oysters&quot;, first published in 1958, inanimate objects breed and undergo metamorphosis.
* The concept appears in the &quot;Discworld&quot; novels of English author Terry Pratchett, where it is referred to as &quot;malignity&quot; or &quot;malignance&quot;; one practical example the author gives is the tendency of garden hoses, no matter how carefully one coils and stores them, to unloop themselves overnight and tie the bicycle to the lawnmower. It is associated with Pratchett&#x27;s Auditors of Reality, and possibly also with Anoia, whom he describes as a &quot;goddess of things that stick in drawers.&quot; 
* Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novel &quot;V.&quot; features the character of Benny Profane, who is under the impression that he can only deal successfully with animate objects. Throughout the novel, the dividing line between animate and inanimate objects become blurred, such as the Bad Priest, who is mostly machine, a talking protective suit named SHROUD, and sewer-dwelling alligators who are aware that they were intended to be toy pets for children.
* Farin Urlaub&#x27;s single &quot;Dusche&quot; is a rock song in which the singer believes the contents of his house are planning to assassinate him.

<text>The Pasiphae group is a group of retrograde irregular satellites of Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Pasiphae and are thought to have a common origin.

Their semi-major axes (distances from Jupiter) range between 22.6 and 24.3 million km (similar range as the Carme group), their inclinations between 141.5° and 157.3°, and their eccentricities between 0.22 and 0.44.

The members of the Pasiphae group are:
The International Astronomical Union (IAU) reserves names ending in -e for all retrograde moons.

==Origin==
The Pasiphae group is believed to have been formed when Jupiter captured an asteroid which subsequently broke up after a collision. The original asteroid was not disturbed heavily: the original body is calculated to have been 60 km in diameter, about the same size as Pasiphae; Pasiphae retains 99% of the original body&#x27;s mass. However, if Sinope belongs to the group, the ratio is much smaller, 87%.

Unlike the Carme and Ananke groups, the theory of a single impact origin for the Pasiphae group is not accepted by all studies. This is because the Pasiphae group, while similar in semi-major axis, is more widely dispersed in inclination. Alternatively, Sinope might be not a part of the remnants of the same collision and captured independently instead. The differences in color class between the objects (grey for Pasiphae, light red for Callirrhoe and Megaclite) also suggest that the group could have a more complex origin than a single collision.

<doc id="886852" wikidata="Q2160208" url="?curid=886852" title="Roch Thériault">
<text>Roch Thériault (; May 16, 1947 – February 26, 2011) was a Canadian cult leader and convicted murderer. Thériault, a self-proclaimed prophet under the name Moïse (French for &quot;Moses&quot;), founded the Ant Hill Kids in 1977. They were a doomsday cult whose beliefs were based on those of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. In April 1978, Thériault was removed from the Seventh-day Adventist Church. He maintained multiple wives and concubines, impregnating all female members as a religious requirement, and fathering 26 children. Thériault&#x27;s followers, including 12 adults and 22 children, lived under his totalitarian rule in a commune and were subject to severe physical and sexual abuse.

Thériault was arrested for assault in 1989, dissolving the cult, and in 1993 was convicted for the murder of follower Solange Boilard. He had previously killed an infant named Samuel Giguère, while two of his disciples, Geraldine Gagné Auclair and Gabrielle Nadeau, died following homeopathic treatments administered to them by Thériault. Thériault received a life sentence, which he was serving when he was murdered at Dorchester Penitentiary in 2011. Thériault, along with Robert Pickton, Clifford Olson and Paul Bernardo, has been considered one of Canada&#x27;s most notorious criminals since the 1980s.

==Early life==
Roch Thériault was born on May 16, 1947, into a French-Canadian family, and raised in Thetford Mines. As a child Thériault was considered to be very intelligent, but dropped out of school in the seventh grade and began to teach himself the Old Testament of the Bible. Thériault believed that the end of the world was near and would be brought on by the war between good and evil. Thériault converted from Catholicism to the Seventh-day Adventist Church in January 1977, and began practising the denomination&#x27;s regular holistic beliefs which encouraged a healthy lifestyle free of unhealthy foods and tobacco.

==Ant Hill Kids==
In the mid-1970s, Thériault convinced a group of people to leave their jobs and homes to join him in a religious movement. Thériault formed the cult in 1977 in Sainte-Marie, Quebec with the goal to form a commune where people could freely listen to his motivational speeches, live in unity and equality, and be free of sin. He prohibited the group from remaining in contact with their families and with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, as this was against his cult&#x27;s values of freedom. Thériault&#x27;s fear of the end of the world grew, claiming that God had warned him that it would come in February 1979, and used the commune to prepare for it. In 1978, in preparation, Thériault moved his commune by hiking to a mountainside he called &quot;Eternal Mountain&quot; in Hope, in the sparsely populated Gaspé Peninsula, where he claimed they could all be saved. There, Thériault made the commune build their town while he relaxed, comparing them to ants working in an ant hill and naming the group the Ant Hill Kids. In February 1979, when the apocalypse did not occur, people started questioning Thériault&#x27;s wisdom, but he defended himself by saying that time on Earth and in God&#x27;s world were not parallel, and that therefore it was a miscalculation. To expand the community as well as keep the members devoted, Thériault married and impregnated all of the women in the commune, fathering over 20 children with 9 female members of the group. By the 1980s, there were nearly 40 members. Followers were made to wear identical tunics to represent equality and their devotion to the commune.

In 1984, the group relocated from Quebec to a new site near Burnt River, a hamlet in Central Ontario which is now part of the city of Kawartha Lakes.

===Abuse===
Following the cult&#x27;s formation, Thériault began to move away from being a motivational leader as his drinking problem worsened, exerting an increasingly totalitarian control over the lives of his followers and becoming irrational in his beliefs. Members were not allowed to speak to each other when he was not present, nor to have sex with each other without his permission. Thériault used his charisma to cover for his increasingly abusive and erratic behaviour, and none of the other members questioned his judgement or openly blamed him for any physical, mental or emotional damage. Thériault began to inflict punishments on followers that he considered to be straying, by spying on them and claiming that God told him what they did. If a person wished to leave the commune, Thériault would hit them with either a belt or hammer, suspend them from the ceiling, pluck each of their body hairs individually, or even defecate on them. The Ant Hill Kids raised money for living by selling baked goods, and members who did not bring in enough money were also punished.

Over time, Thériault&#x27;s punishments became increasingly extreme and violent, including making members break their own legs with sledgehammers, sit on lit stoves, shoot each other in the shoulders, and eat dead mice and feces. A follower would sometimes be asked to cut off another follower&#x27;s toes with wire cutters to prove loyalty. The abuse extended to the cult&#x27;s children, who were sexually abused, held over fires, or nailed to trees while other children threw stones at them. One of Thériault&#x27;s wives left a newborn child, Eleazar Lavallée, outside to die in freezing temperatures to keep him away from the abuse. Thériault attempted to backtrack to the original religious mission of the commune, beginning to strongly believe in purifying his followers and ridding them of their sins through abusive purification sessions where the members would be completely nude as he whipped and beat them. Thériault claimed to be a holy being, and started performing unnecessary amateur surgical operations on sick members to demonstrate his healing powers. These &quot;surgeries&quot; included injecting a 94% ethanol solution into stomachs, or performing circumcisions on the children and adults of the group. In 1987, social workers removed 17 of the children from the commune. However, Thériault faced no repercussions for his abusive acts.

In 1989, when follower Solange Boilard complained of an upset stomach, Thériault performed another amateur surgery without anaesthesia. He laid her naked on a table, and punched her in the stomach, then forced a plastic tube into her rectum to perform a crude enema with molasses and olive oil. He cut open her abdomen with a knife and ripped out part of her intestines with his bare hands. Thériault made another member, Gabrielle Lavallée, stitch her up using needle and thread, and had the other women shove a tube down her throat and blow through it. Boilard died the next day from the damage inflicted by the procedures. Claiming to have the power of resurrection, Thériault had his followers saw off the cap of Boilard&#x27;s skull and he ejaculated onto her brain. When Boilard did not return to life, her corpse was buried a short distance from the Ant Hill Kids&#x27; commune.

==Arrest and conviction==
Lavallée underwent harsh treatment at the Ontario commune during the late 1980s, suffering welding torch burns to her genitals, a hypodermic needle breaking off in her back, and eight of her teeth being forcibly removed. Lavallée attempted to escape from the commune after Thériault cut off parts of her breast and smashed her head in with the blunt side of an axe, but upon her return he removed one of her fingers with wire cutters, pinned her hand to a wooden table with a hunting knife, and then used a cleaver to amputate her arm.

In 1989, Thériault was arrested for assault after Lavallée had fled the commune again and contacted authorities, effectively dissolving the Ant Hill Kids. Provincial authorities had long-held suspicions about Thériault&#x27;s cult due to the particularly primitive living conditions of its membership, but because the commune was officially registered as a church, officials were legally unable to investigate the adults, and could not do much except ensure the welfare of the children. Thériault was found guilty of assault for the amputation of Lavallée&#x27;s arm and received a sentence of 12 years&#x27; imprisonment. The vast majority of the cult&#x27;s followers abandoned Thériault after his arrest, but during his imprisonment he fathered another four children with remaining female members during conjugal visits. Lavallée&#x27;s report allowed further investigation into Thériault&#x27;s actions, exposing the wider abuses at the communes and Solange Boilard&#x27;s murder. In 1993, Thériault pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for the death of Solange Boilard, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. In 2000, Thériault was transferred to Dorchester Penitentiary, a medium-security prison in Dorchester, New Brunswick. In 2002, Thériault was rejected for parole as he was considered too high a risk to re-offend, and he never applied again.

In 2009, Thériault tried to sell his artwork on a United States-based website MurderAuction.com, which called itself a &quot;true crime auction house&quot; and was willing to sell some of Thériault&#x27;s drawings and poetry. The Correctional Service of Canada prevented Thériault&#x27;s works leaving Dorchester Penitentiary, and Stockwell Day, the Canadian federal Public Safety Minister at the time, wrote to the Correctional Service to express concern that the killer was benefiting from work in prison.

==Death and aftermath==
On February 26, 2011, at age 63, Thériault was found dead near his cell at Dorchester Penitentiary. His death is believed to be the result of an altercation with his cellmate, Matthew Gerrard MacDonald, a 60-year-old convicted murderer from Port au Port, Newfoundland and Labrador, who was charged with the killing. MacDonald pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison, having already been serving a life sentence for a previous murder charge. MacDonald had stabbed Thériault in the neck with a shiv, walked to the officers station, handed them the weapon, and proclaimed &quot;That piece of shit is down on the range. Here&#x27;s the knife, I&#x27;ve sliced him up.&quot;

The 2002 film &quot;Savage Messiah&quot; depicts Thériault&#x27;s crimes against his followers and the ensuing legal recourse. The film stars Luc Picard as Thériault, and Polly Walker as Paula Jackson, the social worker whose investigation revealed the crimes. Gabrielle Lavallée wrote a memoir of her life in the sect entitled &quot;L&#x27;alliance de la brebis&quot; (&quot;Alliance of the Ewe&quot;), .

<text>Tapirus is a genus of tapir which contains the living tapir species. The Malayan tapir is usually included in &quot;Tapirus&quot; as well, although some authorities have moved it into its own genus, &quot;Acrocodia&quot;.

==Extant species==
The Kabomani tapir was at one point recognized as another living member of the genus, but is now considered to be nested within &quot;T. terrestris&quot;.

==Evolution==
The genus &quot;Tapirus&quot; first appeared during the Middle Miocene (around 16-10 million years ago), known fossils in both Europe (&quot;T. telleri&quot;) and North America (&quot;T. johnsoni&quot; and &quot;T. polkensis&quot;). The youngest tapir in Europe, &quot;Tapirus arvernensis&quot; became extinct at the end of the Pliocene, around 2.6 million years ago. &quot;Tapirus&quot; dispersed into South America during the Early Pleistocene as part of the Great American Interchange, around 2.6-1 million years ago.

Tapirs suffered considerable extinctions at the end of the Pleistocene, and went completely extinct north of southern Mexico.

<text>Fort Wayne Community Schools (FWCS) is the Fort Wayne, Indiana area public school district, and is the largest in Indiana. The second largest is the Indianapolis Public Schools. It operates five high schools, ten middle schools, one intermediate school (1-8 grades) and over thirty elementary schools, serving 30,992 students (nearly 3% of Indiana&#x27;s K-12 population) in 2012-2013. FWCS&#x27;s current superintendent is Dr. Mark Daniel. FWCS is divided into several departments, including Technology, Transportation, Academic Services, Continuing Education, Nutrition Services, and Public Affairs.

==Boundary==
The district&#x27;s boundary includes St. Joseph, Washington, and Wayne townships, as well as a block of Adams Township. The majority of Fort Wayne and a small section of New Haven are this district.

==School Board==
The FWCS Board of School Trustees serves as the district&#x27;s governing and fiscal body, and its meetings are open to the public in the Grile Administrative Center in downtown Fort Wayne and broadcast on local cable channels, Comcast 54 and FiOS/Frontier 24. The School Board approves the FWCS tax rate and any borrowing that will be paid off by property taxes.

Current FWCS board members include Steve Corona, Anne Duff, Julie Hollingsworth, Rohli Booker, Jennifer Matthias, Maria Norman and Noah Smith. Board of School Trustees

===Property tax remonstrace===
On April 23, 2007, the School Board voted to fight a remonstrance by property taxpayers in the FWCS district opposing a $500 million Facilities Improvement Plan. The organization Code Blue Schools led the remonstrance. Remonstrance petitions were submitted to the Allen County Auditor on July 1, 2007. Those against the $500 million bond issue submitted over 33,000 signatures, in contrast with the 11,000 signatures collected in favor of the bond issue.

===Elmhurst High School closure===
On March 22, 2010, a vote was taken by the FWCS School Board to accept a recommendation of the FWCS administration regarding ways to reduce the 2010 district budget by $15 million. The administration&#x27;s report included the step of closing Elmhurst High School. The budget moves were required because current economic conditions reduced federal and state funds available to the district. The closing of Elmhurst was controversial. By a unanimous vote of 7-0, the board agreed to accept the administration&#x27;s recommendation for closure, effective upon completion of the 2009-2010 academic year. Returning students were reallocated to other high schools in the FWCS system.

==Schools==
As well as offering public education during the day, FWCS offers continuing education classes and events that meet in its buildings in the evenings and on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).

<text>Colloidal gold is a sol or colloidal suspension of nanoparticles of gold in a fluid, usually water. The colloid is coloured usually either wine red (for spherical particles less than 100 nm) or blue-purple (for larger spherical particles or nanorods).
Due to their optical, electronic, and molecular-recognition properties, gold nanoparticles are the subject of substantial research, with many potential or promised applications in a wide variety of areas, including electron microscopy, electronics, nanotechnology, materials science, and biomedicine.

The properties of colloidal gold nanoparticles, and thus their potential applications, depend strongly upon their size and shape. For example, rodlike particles have both a transverse and longitudinal absorption peak, and anisotropy of the shape affects their self-assembly.

==History==
Used since ancient times as a method of staining glass, colloidal gold was used in the 4th-century Lycurgus Cup, which changes color depending on the location of light source.

During the Middle Ages, soluble gold, a solution containing gold salt, had a reputation for its curative property for various diseases. In 1618, Francis Anthony, a philosopher and member of the medical profession, published a book called &quot;Panacea Aurea, sive tractatus duo de ipsius Auro Potabili&quot; (Latin: gold potion, or two treatments of potable gold). The book introduces information on the formation of colloidal gold and its medical uses. About half a century later, English botanist Nicholas Culpepper published a book in 1656, &quot;Treatise of Aurum Potabile&quot;, solely discussing the medical uses of colloidal gold.

In 1676, Johann Kunckel, a German chemist, published a book on the manufacture of stained glass. In his book &quot;Valuable Observations or Remarks About the Fixed and Volatile Salts-Auro and Argento Potabile, Spiritu Mundi and the Like&quot;, Kunckel assumed that the pink color of Aurum Potabile came from small particles of metallic gold, not visible to human eyes. In 1842, John Herschel invented a photographic process called chrysotype (from the Greek meaning &quot;gold&quot;) that used colloidal gold to record images on paper.

Modern scientific evaluation of colloidal gold did not begin until Michael Faraday&#x27;s work in the 1850s. In 1856, in a basement laboratory of Royal Institution, Faraday accidentally created a ruby red solution while mounting pieces of gold leaf onto microscope slides. Since he was already interested in the properties of light and matter, Faraday further investigated the optical properties of the colloidal gold. He prepared the first pure sample of colloidal gold, which he called &#x27;activated gold&#x27;, in 1857. He used phosphorus to reduce a solution of gold chloride. The colloidal gold Faraday made 150 years ago is still optically active. For a long time, the composition of the &#x27;ruby&#x27; gold was unclear. Several chemists suspected it to be a gold tin compound, due to its preparation. Faraday recognized that the color was actually due to the miniature size of the gold particles. He noted the light scattering properties of suspended gold microparticles, which is now called Faraday-Tyndall effect.

In 1898, Richard Adolf Zsigmondy prepared the first colloidal gold in diluted solution. Apart from Zsigmondy, Theodor Svedberg, who invented ultracentrifugation, and Gustav Mie, who provided the theory for scattering and absorption by spherical particles, were also interested in the synthesis and properties of colloidal gold.

With advances in various analytical technologies in the 20th century, studies on gold nanoparticles has accelerated. Advanced microscopy methods, such as atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy, have contributed the most to nanoparticle research. Due to their comparably easy synthesis and high stability, various gold particles have been studied for their practical uses. Different types of gold nanoparticle are already used in many industries.

== Physical properties ==

=== Optical ===

Colloidal gold has been used by artists for centuries because of the nanoparticle’s interactions with visible light. Gold nanoparticles absorb and scatter light resulting in colours ranging from vibrant reds (smaller particles) to blues to black and finally to clear and colorless (larger particles), depending on particle size, shape, local refractive index, and aggregation state. These colors occur because of a phenomenon called localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), in which conduction electrons on the surface of the nanoparticle oscillate in resonance with incident light.

==== Effect of size, shape, composition and environment ====
As a general rule, the wavelength of light absorbed increases as a function of increasing nanoparticle size. Both the surface plasmon resonance frequency and scattering intensity depend on the size, shape composition and environment of the nanoparticles. This phenomenon may be quantified by use of the Mie scattering theory for spherical nanoparticles. Nanoparticles with diameters of 30–100 nm may be detected easily by a microscope, and particles with a size of 40 nm may even be detected by the naked eye when the concentration of the particles is 10−4 M or greater. The scattering from a 60 nm nanoparticle is about 105 times stronger than the emission from a fluorescein molecule.

==== Effect of local refractive index ====
Changes in the apparent color of a gold nanoparticle solution can also be caused by the environment in which the colloidal gold is suspended. The optical properties of gold nanoparticles depend on the refractive index near the nanoparticle surface, so the molecules directly attached to the nanoparticle surface (i.e. nanoparticle ligands) and the nanoparticle solvent may both influence the observed optical features. As the refractive index near the gold surface increases, the LSPR shifts to longer wavelengths. In addition to solvent environment, the extinction peak can be tuned by coating the nanoparticles with non-conducting shells such as silica, biomolecules, or aluminium oxide.

==== Effect of aggregation ====
When gold nanoparticles aggregate, the optical properties of the particle change, because the effective particle size, shape, and dielectric environment all change.

==Medical research==
===Electron microscope labelling===

Colloidal gold and various derivatives have long been among the most widely used labels for antigens in biological electron microscopy. Colloidal gold particles can be attached to many traditional biological probes such as antibodies, lectins, superantigens, glycans, nucleic acids, and receptors. Particles of different sizes are easily distinguishable in electron micrographs, allowing simultaneous multiple-labelling experiments.

In addition to biological probes, gold nanoparticles can be transferred to various mineral substrates, such as mica, single crystal silicon, and atomically flat gold(III), to be observed under atomic force microscopy (AFM).

===Drug delivery system===

Gold nanoparticles can be used to optimize the biodistribution of drugs to diseased organs, tissues or cells, in order to improve and target drug delivery.
Nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery is feasible only if the drug distribution is otherwise inadequate. These cases include drug targeting of unstable (proteins, siRNA, DNA), delivery to the difficult sites (brain, retina, tumors, intracellular organelles) and drugs with serious side effects (e.g. anti-cancer agents). The performance of the nanoparticles depends on the size and surface functionalities in the particles. Also, the drug release and particle disintegration can vary depending on the system (e.g. biodegradable polymers sensitive to pH). An optimal nanodrug delivery system ensures that the active drug is available at the site of action for the correct time and duration, and their concentration should be above the minimal effective concentration (MEC) and below the minimal toxic concentration (MTC).

Gold nanoparticles are being investigated as carriers for drugs such as Paclitaxel. The administration of hydrophobic drugs require molecular encapsulation and it is found that nanosized particles are particularly efficient in evading the reticuloendothelial system.

===Tumor detection===
In cancer research, colloidal gold can be used to target tumors and provide detection using SERS (surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy) &quot;in vivo&quot;. These gold nanoparticles are surrounded with Raman reporters, which provide light emission that is over 200 times brighter than quantum dots. It was found that the Raman reporters were stabilized when the nanoparticles were encapsulated with a thiol-modified polyethylene glycol coat. This allows for compatibility and circulation &quot;in vivo&quot;. To specifically target tumor cells, the polyethylenegylated gold particles are conjugated with an antibody (or an antibody fragment such as scFv), against, e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor, which is sometimes overexpressed in cells of certain cancer types. Using SERS, these pegylated gold nanoparticles can then detect the location of the tumor.

Gold nanoparticles accumulate in tumors, due to the leakiness of tumor vasculature, and can be used as contrast agents for enhanced imaging in a time-resolved optical tomography system using short-pulse lasers for skin cancer detection in mouse model. It is found that intravenously administered spherical gold nanoparticles broadened the temporal profile of reflected optical signals and enhanced the contrast between surrounding normal tissue and tumors.
===Gene therapy===
Gold nanoparticles have shown potential as intracellular delivery vehicles for siRNA oligonucleotides with maximal therapeutic impact.

Gold nanoparticles show potential as intracellular delivery vehicles for antisense oligonucleotides (single and double stranded DNA) by providing protection against intracellular nucleases and ease of functionalization for selective targeting.

===Photothermal agents===
Gold nanorods are being investigated as photothermal agents for in-vivo applications. Gold nanorods are rod-shaped gold nanoparticles whose aspect ratios tune the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band from the visible to near-infrared wavelength. The total extinction of light at the SPR is made up of both absorption and scattering. For the smaller axial diameter nanorods (~10 nm), absorption dominates, whereas for the larger axial diameter nanorods (&gt;35 nm) scattering can dominate. As a consequence, for in-vivo studies, small diameter gold nanorods are being used as photothermal converters of near-infrared light due to their high absorption cross-sections. Since near-infrared light transmits readily through human skin and tissue, these nanorods can be used as ablation components for cancer, and other targets. When coated with polymers, gold nanorods have been observed to circulate in-vivo with half-lives longer than 6 hours, bodily residence times around 72 hours, and little to no uptake in any internal organs except the liver.

Despite the unquestionable success of gold nanorods as photothermal agents in preclinical research, they have yet to obtain the approval for clinical use because the size is above the renal excretion threshold. In 2019, the first NIR-absorbing plasmonic ultrasmall-in-nano architecture has been reported, and jointly combine: (i) a suitable photothermal conversion for hyperthermia treatments, (ii) the possibility of multiple photothermal treatments and (iii) renal excretion of the building blocks after the therapeutic action.

===Radiotherapy dose enhancer===
Considerable interest has been shown in the use of gold and other heavy-atom-containing nanoparticles to enhance the dose delivered to tumors. Since the gold nanoparticles are taken up by the tumors more than the nearby healthy tissue, the dose is selectively enhanced. The biological effectiveness of this type of therapy seems to be due to the local deposition of the radiation dose near the nanoparticles. This mechanism is the same as occurs in heavy ion therapy.

===Detection of toxic gas===
Researchers have developed simple inexpensive methods for on-site detection of hydrogen sulfide present in air based on the antiaggregation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Dissolving into a weak alkaline buffer solution leads to the formation of HS-, which can stabilize AuNPs and ensure they maintain their red color allowing for visual detection of toxic levels of .

===Gold nanoparticle based biosensor===

Gold nanoparticles are incorporated into biosensors to enhance its stability, sensitivity, and selectivity. Nanoparticle properties such as small size, high surface-to-volume ratio, and high surface energy allow immobilization of large range of biomolecules. Gold nanoparticle, in particular, could also act as &quot;electron wire&quot; to transport electrons and its amplification effect on electromagnetic light allows it to function as signal amplifiers. Main types of gold nanoparticle based biosensors are optical and electrochemical biosensor.

====Optical biosensor====

Gold nanoparticles improve the sensitivity of optical sensors in response to the change in the local refractive index. The angle of the incidence light for surface plasmon resonance, an interaction between light waves and conducting electrons in metal, changes when other substances are bounded to the metal surface. Because gold is very sensitive to its surroundings&#x27; dielectric constant, binding of an analyte significantly shifts the gold nanoparticle&#x27;s SPR and therefore allows for more sensitive detection. Gold nanoparticle could also amplify the SPR signal. When the plasmon wave pass through the gold nanoparticle, the charge density in the wave and the electron I the gold interact and result in a higher energy response, referred to as electron coupling. When the analyte and bio-receptor both bind to the gold, the apparent mass of the analyte increases and therefore amplifies the signal.
These properties had been used to build a DNA sensor with 1000-fold greater sensitivity than without the Au NP. Humidity sensors have also been built by altering the atom interspacing between molecules with humidity change, the interspacing change would also result in a change of the Au NP&#x27;s LSPR.

====Electrochemical biosensor====
Electrochemical sensor convert biological information into electrical signals that could be detected. The conductivity and biocompatibility of Au NP allow it to act as &quot;electron wire&quot;. It transfers electron between the electrode and the active site of the enzyme. It could be accomplished in two ways: attach the Au NP to either the enzyme or the electrode. GNP-glucose oxidase monolayer electrode was constructed use these two methods. The Au NP allowed more freedom in the enzyme&#x27;s orientation and therefore more sensitive and stable detection. Au NP also acts as immobilization platform for the enzyme. Most biomolecules denatures or lose its activity when interacted with the electrode. The biocompatibility and high surface energy of Au allow it to bind to a large amount of protein without altering its activity and results in a more sensitive sensor. Moreover, Au NP also catalyzes biological reactions. Gold nanoparticle under 2 nm has shown catalytic activity to the oxidation of styrene.

====Immunological biosensor====
Gold nanoparticles have been coated with peptides and glycans for use in immunological detection methods. The possibility to use glyconanoparticles in ELISA was unexpected, but the method seems to have a high sensitivity and thus offers potential for development of specific assays for diagnostic identification of antibodies in patient sera.

=== Thin films ===
Gold nanoparticles capped with organic ligands, such as alkanethiol molecules, can self-assemble into large monolayers (&gt;cm2). The particles are first prepared in organic solvent, such as chloroform or toluene, and are then spread into monolayers either on a liquid surface or on a solid substrate. Such interfacial thin films of nanoparticles have close relationship with Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers made from surfactants.

The mechanical properties of nanoparticle monolayers have been studied extensively. For 5 nm spheres capped with dodecanethiol, the Young&#x27;s modulus of the monolayer is on the order of GPa. The mechanics of the membranes are guided by strong interactions between ligand shells on adjacent particles. Upon fracture, the films crack perpendicular to the direction of strain at a fracture stress of 11 formula_1 2.6 MPa, comparable to that of cross-linked polymer films. Free-standing nanoparticle membranes exhibit bending rigidity on the order of 10formula_2 eV, higher than what is predicted in theory for continuum plates of the same thickness, due to nonlocal microstructural constraints such as nonlocal coupling of particle rotational degrees of freedom. On the other hand, resistance to bending is found to be greatly reduced in nanoparticle monolayers that are supported at the air/water interface, possibly due to screening of ligand interactions in a wet environment.

== Surface chemistry ==
In many different types of colloidal gold syntheses, the interface of the nanoparticles can display widely different character – ranging from an interface similar to a self-assembled monolayer to a disordered boundary with no repeating patterns. Beyond the Au-Ligand interface, conjugation of the interfacial ligands with various functional moieties (from small organic molecules to polymers to DNA to RNA) afford colloidal gold much of its vast functionality.

=== Ligand exchange/functionalization ===
After initial nanoparticle synthesis, colloidal gold ligands are often exchanged with new ligands designed for specific applications. For example, Au NPs produced via the Turkevich-style (or Citrate Reduction) method are readily reacted via ligand exchange reactions, due to the relatively weak binding between the carboxyl groups and the surfaces of the NPs. This ligand exchange can produce conjugation with a number of biomolecules from DNA to RNA to proteins to polymers (such as PEG) to increase biocompatibility and functionality. For example, ligands have been shown to enhance catalytic activity by mediating interactions between adsorbates and the active gold surfaces for specific oxygenation reactions. Ligand exchange can also be used to promote phase transfer of the colloidal particles. Ligand exchange is also possible with alkane thiol-arrested NPs produced from the Brust-type synthesis method, although higher temperatures are needed to promote the rate of the ligand detachment. An alternative method for further functionalization is achieved through the conjugation of the ligands with other molecules, though this method can cause the colloidal stability of the Au NPs to breakdown.

=== Ligand removal ===
In many cases, as in various high-temperature catalytic applications of Au, the removal of the capping ligands produces more desirable physicochemical properties. The removal of ligands from colloidal gold while maintaining a relatively constant number of Au atoms per Au NP can be difficult due to the tendency for these bare clusters to aggregate. The removal of ligands is partially achievable by simply washing away all excess capping ligands, though this method is ineffective in removing all capping ligand. More often ligand removal achieved under high temperature or light ablation followed by washing. Alternatively, the ligands can be electrochemically etched off.

=== Surface structure and chemical environment ===
The precise structure of the ligands on the surface of colloidal gold NPs impact the properties of the colloidal gold particles. Binding conformations and surface packing of the capping ligands at the surface of the colloidal gold NPs tend to differ greatly from bulk surface model adsorption, largely due to the high curvature observed at the nanoparticle surfaces. Thiolate-gold interfaces at the nanoscale have been well-studied and the thiolate ligands are observed to pull Au atoms off of the surface of the particles to form “staple” motifs that have significant Thiyl-Au(0) character. The citrate-gold surface, on the other hand, is relatively less-studied due to the vast number of binding conformations of the citrate to the curved gold surfaces. A study performed in 2014 identified that the most-preferred binding of the citrate involves two carboxylic acids and the hydroxyl group of the citrate binds three surface metal atoms.

==Health and safety==
As gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are further investigated for targeted drug delivery in humans, their toxicity needs to be considered. For the most part, it is suggested that AuNPs are biocompatible, but the concentrations at which they become toxic needs to be determined, and if those concentrations fall within the range of used concentrations. Toxicity can be tested &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot;. &quot;In vitro&quot; toxicity results can vary depending on the type of the cellular growth media with different protein compositions, the method used to determine cellular toxicity (cell health, cell stress, how many cells are taken into a cell), and the capping ligands in solution. &quot;In vivo&quot; assessments can determine the general health of an organism (abnormal behavior, weight loss, average life span) as well as tissue specific toxicology (kidney, liver, blood) and inflammation and oxidative responses. &quot;In vitro&quot; experiments are more popular than &quot;in vivo&quot; experiments because &quot;in vitro&quot; experiments are more simplistic to perform than &quot;in vivo&quot; experiments.

===Toxicity and hazards in synthesis===
While AuNPs themselves appear to have low or negligible toxicity, and the literature shows that the toxicity has much more to do with the ligands rather than the particles themselves, the synthesis of them involves chemicals that are hazardous. Sodium borohydride, a harsh reagent, is used to reduce the gold ions to gold metal. The gold ions usually come from chloroauric acid, a potent acid. Because of the high toxicity and hazard of reagents used to synthesize AuNPs, the need for more “green” methods of synthesis arose.

===Toxicity due to capping ligands===
Some of the capping ligands associated with AuNPs can be toxic while others are nontoxic. In gold nanorods (AuNRs), it has been shown that a strong cytotoxicity was associated with CTAB-stabilized AuNRs at low concentration, but it is thought that free CTAB was the culprit in toxicity . Modifications that overcoat these AuNRs reduces this toxicity in human colon cancer cells (HT-29) by preventing CTAB molecules from desorbing from the AuNRs back into the solution.
Ligand toxicity can also be seen in AuNPs. Compared to the 90% toxicity of HAuCl4 at the same concentration, AuNPs with carboxylate termini were shown to be non-toxic. Large AuNPs conjugated with biotin, cysteine, citrate, and glucose were not toxic in human leukemia cells (K562) for concentrations up to 0.25 M. Also, citrate-capped gold nanospheres (AuNSs) have been proven to be compatible with human blood and did not cause platelet aggregation or an immune response. However, citrate-capped gold nanoparticles sizes 8-37 nm were found to be lethally toxic for mice, causing shorter lifespans, severe sickness, loss of appetite and weight, hair discoloration, and damage to the liver, spleen, and lungs; gold nanoparticles accumulated in the spleen and liver after traveling a section of the immune system.
There are mixed-views for polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified AuNPs. These AuNPs were found to be toxic in mouse liver by injection, causing cell death and minor inflammation. However, AuNPs conjugated with PEG copolymers showed negligible toxicity towards human colon cells (Caco-2).
AuNP toxicity also depends on the overall charge of the ligands. In certain doses, AuNSs that have positively-charged ligands are toxic in monkey kidney cells (Cos-1), human red blood cells, and E. coli because of the AuNSs interaction with the negatively-charged cell membrane; AuNSs with negatively-charged ligands have been found to be nontoxic in these species.
In addition to the previously mentioned &quot;in vivo&quot; and &quot;in vitro&quot; experiments, other similar experiments have been performed. Alkylthiolate-AuNPs with trimethlyammonium ligand termini mediate the translocation of DNA across mammalian cell membranes &quot;in vitro&quot; at a high level, which is detrimental to these cells. Corneal haze in rabbits have been healed &quot;in vivo&quot; by using polyethylemnimine-capped gold nanoparticles that were transfected with a gene that promotes wound healing and inhibits corneal fibrosis.

===Toxicity due to size of nanoparticles===
Toxicity in certain systems can also be dependent on the size of the nanoparticle. AuNSs size 1.4 nm were found to be toxic in human skin cancer cells (SK-Mel-28), human cervical cancer cells (HeLa), mouse fibroblast cells (L929), and mouse macrophages (J774A.1), while 0.8, 1.2, and 1.8 nm sized AuNSs were less toxic by a six-fold amount and 15 nm AuNSs were nontoxic. There is some evidence for AuNP buildup after injection in &quot;in vivo&quot; studies, but this is very size dependent. 1.8 nm AuNPs were found to be almost totally trapped in the lungs of rats. Different sized AuNPs were found to buildup in the blood, brain, stomach, pancreas, kidneys, liver, and spleen.

Biosafety and biokinetics investigations on biodegradable ultrasmall-in-nano architectures have demonstrated that gold nanoparticles are able to avoid metal accumulation in organisms through escaping by the renal pathway.

== Synthesis ==

Generally, gold nanoparticles are produced in a liquid (&quot;liquid chemical methods&quot;) by reduction of chloroauric acid (). To prevent the particles from aggregating, stabilizing agents are added. Citrate acts both as the reducing agent and colloidal stabilizer.

They can be functionalized with various organic ligands to create organic-inorganic hybrids with advanced functionality.

=== Turkevich method ===
This simple method was pioneered by J. Turkevich et al. in 1951 and refined by G. Frens in the 1970s. It produces modestly monodisperse spherical gold nanoparticles of around 10–20 nm in diameter. Larger particles can be produced, but at the cost of monodispersity and shape. In this method, hot chloroauric acid is treated with sodium citrate solution, producing colloidal gold. The Turkevich reaction proceeds via formation of transient gold nanowires. These gold nanowires are responsible for the dark appearance of the reaction solution before it turns ruby-red.

===Capping agents===
A capping agent is used during nanoparticle synthesis to inhibit particle growth and aggregation. The chemical blocks or reduces reactivity at the periphery of the particle—a good capping agent has a high affinity for the new nuclei. Citrate ions or tannic acid function both as a reducing agent and a capping agent. Less sodium citrate results in larger particles.

===Brust-Schiffrin method===
This method was discovered by Brust and Schiffrin in the early 1990s, and can be used to produce gold nanoparticles in organic liquids that are normally not miscible with water (like toluene). It involves the reaction of a chlorauric acid solution with tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB) solution in toluene and sodium borohydride as an anti-coagulant and a reducing agent, respectively.

Here, the gold nanoparticles will be around 5–6 nm. NaBH4 is the reducing agent, and TOAB is both the phase transfer catalyst and the stabilizing agent.

TOAB does not bind to the gold nanoparticles particularly strongly, so the solution will aggregate gradually over the course of approximately two weeks. To prevent this, one can add a stronger binding agent, like a thiol (in particular, alkanethiols), which will bind to gold, producing a near-permanent solution. Alkanethiol protected gold nanoparticles can be precipitated and then redissolved. Thiols are better binding agents because there is a strong affinity for the gold-sulfur bonds that form when the two substances react with each other. is a commonly used strong binding agent to synthesize smaller particles.
Some of the phase transfer agent may remain bound to the purified nanoparticles, this may affect physical properties such as solubility. In order to remove as much of this agent as possible, the nanoparticles must be further purified by soxhlet extraction.

===Perrault method===
This approach, discovered by Perrault and Chan in 2009, uses hydroquinone to reduce HAuCl4 in an aqueous solution that contains 15 nm gold nanoparticle seeds. This seed-based method of synthesis is similar to that used in photographic film development, in which silver grains within the film grow through addition of reduced silver onto their surface. Likewise, gold nanoparticles can act in conjunction with hydroquinone to catalyze reduction of ionic gold onto their surface. The presence of a stabilizer such as citrate results in controlled deposition of gold atoms onto the particles, and growth. Typically, the nanoparticle seeds are produced using the citrate method. The hydroquinone method complements that of Frens, as it extends the range of monodispersed spherical particle sizes that can be produced. Whereas the Frens method is ideal for particles of 12–20 nm, the hydroquinone method can produce particles of at least 30–300 nm.

===Martin method===
This simple method, discovered by Martin and Eah in 2010, generates nearly monodisperse &quot;naked&quot; gold nanoparticles in water. Precisely controlling the reduction stoichiometry by adjusting the ratio of NaBH4-NaOH ions to HAuCl4-HCl ions within the &quot;sweet zone,&quot; along with heating, enables reproducible diameter tuning between 3–6 nm. The aqueous particles are colloidally stable due to their high charge from the excess ions in solution. These particles can be coated with various hydrophilic functionalities, or mixed with hydrophobic ligands for applications in non-polar solvents. In non-polar solvents the nanoparticles remain highly charged, and self-assemble on liquid droplets to form 2D monolayer films of monodisperse nanoparticles.

=== Nanotech studies===
&quot;Bacillus licheniformis&quot; can be used in synthesis of gold nanocubes with sizes between 10 and 100 nanometres. Gold nanoparticles are usually synthesized at high temperatures in organic solvents or using toxic reagents. The bacteria produce them in much milder conditions.

=== Navarro et al. method ===
For particles larger than 30 nm, control of particle size with a low polydispersity of spherical gold nanoparticles remains challenging. In order to provide maximum control on the NP structure, Navarro and co-workers used a modified Turkevitch-Frens procedure using sodium acetylacetonate as the reducing agent and sodium citrate as the stabilizer.

=== Sonolysis ===
Another method for the experimental generation of gold particles is by sonolysis. The first method of this type was invented by Baigent and Müller. This work pioneered the use of ultrasound to provide the energy for the processes involved and allowed the creation of gold particles with a diameter of under 10 nm. In another method using ultrasound, the reaction of an aqueous solution of HAuCl4 with glucose, the reducing agents are hydroxyl radicals and sugar pyrolysis radicals (forming at the interfacial region between the collapsing cavities and the bulk water) and the morphology obtained is that of nanoribbons with width 30–50 nm and length of several micrometers. These ribbons are very flexible and can bend with angles larger than 90°. When glucose is replaced by cyclodextrin (a glucose oligomer), only spherical gold particles are obtained, suggesting that glucose is essential in directing the morphology toward a ribbon.

=== Block copolymer-mediated method ===
An economical, environmentally benign and fast synthesis methodology for gold nanoparticles using block copolymer has been developed by Sakai et al. In this synthesis methodology, block copolymer plays the dual role of a reducing agent as well as a stabilizing agent. The formation of gold nanoparticles comprises three main steps: reduction of gold salt ion by block copolymers in the solution and formation of gold clusters, adsorption of block copolymers on gold clusters and further reduction of gold salt ions on the surfaces of these gold clusters for the growth of gold particles in steps, and finally its stabilization by block copolymers. But this method usually has a limited-yield (nanoparticle concentration), which does not increase with the increase in the gold salt concentration. Ray et al. improved this synthesis method by enhancing the nanoparticle yield by manyfold at ambient temperature.

== Applications ==
=== Antibiotic conjugated nanoparticle synthesis ===
Antibiotic functionalized metal nanoparticles have been widely studied as a mode to treat multi-drug resistant bacterial strains. For example, kanamycin capped gold-nanoparticles (Kan-AuPs) showed broad spectrum dose dependent antibacterial activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains in comparison to kanamycin alone.

<text>Superquinn was an Irish supermarket chain, founded in 1960 and entirely privately owned by the Quinn family. Select Retail Holdings, a property buying consortium, purchased the company from the Quinn family in 2005. A receiver was appointed to the company on 18 July 2011, and the following day the company was bought by Musgrave Group for an undisclosed sum. On 13 February 2014 all remaining units were rebranded as SuperValu.

==Products and services==
The company operated 20 supermarkets under the Superquinn brand and 4 convenience shops under the &quot;Superquinn Select&quot; brand. It had three levels of own brand products of increasing quality; &quot;Euro Shopper&quot;, &quot;Superquinn&quot; and &quot;Superior Quality&quot;. In 2011, the Euroshopper brand was replaced by &quot;Superquinn Essentials&quot;, their low cost, but still high quality, own brand products. Superquinn was known for having a very high level of customer service compared to other supermarket chains, its former owner having written a manual on customer service, Crowning the Customer&quot;. It was also known for having introduced a number of innovations, including Ireland&#x27;s first supermarket loyalty card in 1993, SuperClub re branded in 2007 as Reward Card. It also introduced self-scanning of goods by customers in a number of its outlets (Reward Card SuperScan). Superquinn was known as one of the better retail grocery companies to work for.

Superquinn was part of an Irish Internet shopping portal Buy4Now, which provides Internet shopping services for a number of Irish retailers.

==History==

The business was founded in 1960 as &#x27;Quinns Supermarkets&#x27; in Dundalk by Feargal Quinn, and the company headquarters were later moved to Sutton, Dublin. The trading name was subsequently changed to Superquinn, in part to differentiate it from rival Quinnsworth, which had started in the early 1970s. In 1970, the company name was legally registered and founded.

In 1991, Feargal&#x27;s son Eamonn Quinn took a key management role as deputy chairman.

In January 2005, it was announced that Superquinn was to be sold to a company called Select Retail Holdings, consortium which had been formed in 2002. On 26 August 2005 it was announced that the sale had been completed. Simon Burke replaced Feargal Quinn as Executive Chairman of the company, with Quinn becoming non-executive President of the business. Eamonn Quinn left the company.

In January 2009, the company made the decision to close the Dundalk supermarket. This was the second time Superquinn had failed in Dundalk, but in September 2010 a High Court order forced Superquinn to re-open in its home town again.

==Expansion==
In February 2007 Superquinn purchased the Montrose Hotel in Donnybrook from Jury&#x27;s Doyle for €40 million and planned to develop the site as a supermarket and apartments. Superquinn expanded after the SRH takeover. It opened supermarkets in Heuston South Quarter, Rathborne, Rathgar, Ranelagh and Portlaoise and planned to open in Clongriffin.

In early 2010 it was confirmed that the Heuston South Quarter shop was on schedule for a planned opening in October 2010, it opened on 14 October 2010.

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Home section reported in May 2010 that Superquinn Clongriffin was on hold, with Superquinn quoting that they were &quot;not yet in a position to confirm a likely opening date for a store in Clongriffin&quot;. Residents of Clongriffin and surrounding neighbourhoods feared the planned opening would not transpire.

On 3 September 2008, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; reported that a number of approaches had been made to buy Superquinn, including from BWG Foods Limited, The Musgrave Group plc, J Sainsbury plc, and Asda Stores Limited. However, later that day Simon Burke told RTÉ News and Current Affairs that the company was not for sale.

Superquinn opened its refurbished flagship supermarket in Blackrock, Co Dublin in October 2012. The retailer invested over €2m in the layout of the shop, including a complete overhaul of the fresh food section and an expansion of the fish counter, butchery, cheesemonger and parking spaces area. It had also completed work on Ballinter, Blanchardstown, Bray, Knocklyon, Northside, Ranelagh, Swords and Walkinstown.

==Failed ventures==
The company&#x27;s innovations did not all become successful. One side effort of the company was the failed bank &quot;Tusa&quot; (the Irish word for you in the accusative case), a joint venture with TSB Bank (now part of Permanent TSB). A joint venture with Texaco to introduce small Superquinn convenience shops at petrol forecourts, SuperQ, also failed.

Perhaps more importantly for the company was its failure to expand - Superquinn had less than a third of the branches of its other full-service rivals, Tesco Ireland and Dunnes Stores, and was even eclipsed by discount retailers Aldi and Lidl, who have been very aggressive in acquiring sites compared to Superquinn. Its supermarkets were heavily located in the Dublin and Leinster areas (with 3 in Munster, and none at all in Connacht or Ulster) in contrast to the other operators which operated nationwide.

==Receivership and sale==
On 18 July 2011, it was announced that receivers had been appointed to the Superquinn chain. This was triggered by a consortium of banks believed to be owed around €400m. On 19 July 2011, the chain was reported to have been sold to wholesale group Musgrave Group for just over €100m. Staff were informed that there would be no change to their terms and conditions, or their pensions under the takeover by Musgrave.

The &quot;Irish Times&quot; reported on 23 July 2011 that two high court actions had been initiated to challenge the receivership and instead place the business in examinership. Lithuanian VP Group was named as a possible bidder for the company.

On 27 July 2011, RTÉ reported that the petition for examinership had been withdrawn, allowing the proposed buyout to proceed. Musgrave provided a €10 million fund to benefit suppliers owed money by Superquinn. The Superquinn name disappeared from Ireland&#x27;s main streets on 13 February 2014 after owner, the Musgrave Group, announced its decision to rebrand all 24 Superquinn units as SuperValu.

The SuperQuinn brand has been retained for a limited range of products, including sausages.

<text>Vengalil Krishnan Krishna Menon (3 May 1896 – 6 October 1974) was an Indian academic, independence activist, politician, lawyer, and statesman. During his time, Menon contributed to the Indian independence movement and India&#x27;s foreign relations. He was among the major architects of Indian foreign policy, and acted as Jawaharlal Nehru&#x27;s diplomat.

In 1928, Menon founded the India League in London to demand total independence from the British rule in the Indian subcontinent. Towards the end of the 1940s, he presided Indo-British matters and caused the selection of the last British Viceroy of India, Louis Mountbatten. He worked with Nehru, Mountbatten, Sardar Patel, and V.P. Menon to work out the mechanics of Indian independence.

After the independence of India, he facilitated international diplomacy and resolutions in situations such as the Suez Crisis, Korean War, invasion of Hungary, Cyprus, Indochina, Taiwan, and the Chinese capture of American airmen, while supporting the anti-colonial ethos of what he would eventually name the Non-Aligned Movement. Since the independence of India, he served as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Ambassador to the United Nations, and Defence minister. As a Defence minister, he played a role in military conflicts such as Congo Crisis, Annexation of Goa, and Sino-Indian War. During his tenure as defence minister, India saw establishment of domestic military-industrial complex and educational systems, the Sainik Schools, the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), and other defence and military institutions, while professionalizing the National Cadet Corps and similar entities.

He was elected to both houses of the Indian parliament from constituencies such as Mumbai, Bengal, and Trivandrum in his native state of Kerala. He remained a member of the Lok Sabha until his death.

==Early life ==

=== Family ===
Menon was born into an aristocratic Nair family at Thiruvangad Thalassery, later moving to Panniyankara in Kozhikode, Kerala, where the Vengalil family had a tharavad house, He was named after his father Adv Komath. Krishna Kurup one of the leading criminal advocates of Thalassery and Calicut Bar, only son of reigning Raja, Orlathiri Udaya Varma raja of Kadathanad kingdom and Smt. Komath Sreedevi kettilamma kurup, one of the richest men of Kerala at that time who maintained Komath Ettukettu, Sree Thazhe Komath Bhagavathi Temple in Ayanchery and also maintained vast estates in Ayanchery and Kuttiyadi regions of Vatakara

=== Education ===
Menon had his early education in Ayanchery and Thalassery and later pursude his higher education at the Zamorin&#x27;s College, Kozhikode. In 1918, he graduated from Presidency College, Chennai, with a B.A. in History and Economics. While studying in the Madras Law College, he was involved in Theosophy and was associated with Annie Besant and the Home Rule Movement. He was a member of the &quot;Brothers of Service&quot;, founded by Annie Besant who helped him travel to England in 1924.

===Life and activities in England===
Menon studied at London School of Economics, securing Bachelor of Science in economics and Master of Science in economics from University of London. Later, he studied at University College London and in 1930, he was awarded an M.A. in Industrial Psychology with first class honours from University of London, for a thesis entitled &quot;An Experimental Study of the Mental Processes Involved in Reasoning.&quot; In 1934, he secured a MSc in Political Science with first class honours from the London School of Economics, for a thesis titled &quot;English Political Thought in the Seventeenth Century&quot;.

In 1934, he continued to study law and was called to the bar at Middle Temple, marking the end of his formal education at the age of 37. As a barrister, Menon represented poor lascas pro bono, and, Udham Singh, in his trial for the killing of Michael O&#x27;Dwyer in vengeance for the Amritsar Massacre.

During the 1930s, Menon worked as an editor for The Bodley Head and its &quot;Twentieth Century Library&quot; (1932-1935), for Selwyn &amp; Blount and its &quot;Topical Books&quot; series, and then, from 1937, for Penguin Books and its founder Sir Allen Lane. Menon was the editor of the educational series Pelican Books since its inception.

====Political life in the UK====
After joining the Labour Party he was elected borough councillor of St Pancras, London, in which context he befriended Edwina Mountbatten, wife of Lord Mountbatten. Due to the patronage of the Mountbattens, in the pre-war British society, Menon was able to consolidate political alliances with Labour potentates like Clement Attlee (future prime minister), Sir Stafford Cripps (future chancellor) and Aneurin Bevan, while gaining entry to the social circles of George VI and the then-Queen Elizabeth. Additional intimates included, political and intellectual figures such as Bertrand Russell, J.B.S. Haldane, Michael Foot, E.M. Forster, and Queen Frederica of Greece. St. Pancras, later gave him the &quot;Freedom of the Borough&quot;, the other person having received this, was George Bernard Shaw. In 1939, the Labour Party began preparations to nominate him as its candidate for the Dundee Parliamentary constituency but that fell through because of his perceived connections with the Communist Party. He resigned (or was expelled, according to other sources) from the Labour Party in protest but rejoined in 1944.

====India League and the independence movement====

In 1928, Menon founded India League to demand total independence of India from the British rule. He worked as a journalist and as president of the India League from 1928 to 1947. In 1930s, Menon along with other contributors had created a 554-page report on the situation in India. The report was banned in India. Menon worked to help Nehru succeed Mahatma Gandhi as the moral leader and executive of the Indian independence movement, and to support Nehru&#x27;s accession as the first Prime Minister of an independent India. As Secretary, he built the India League into the Indian lobby in the British Parliament, and turned British sentiment towards the cause of Indian independence. In 1931, Mahatma Gandhi praised the efforts of the Indian League for its &quot;hurricane propaganda on the danger to world peace of a rebellious India in bondage&quot;.

He also took interest in the Colonial Seamen&#x27;s Association from which he met Chris Braithwaite and Surat Alley.The origins of the policy of non-alignment were evident in Menon, where he condemned Britain and Germany, although he marched several times in anti-Nazi demonstrations. When asked whether India would prefer to be ruled by the British or the Germans, Menon replied that &quot;[one] might as well ask a fish if it prefers to be fried in butter or margarine&quot;.

==Roles in post-independence India==
===High Commissioner to the United Kingdom===
After India gained independence in 1947, Menon was appointed High Commissioner of India to the United Kingdom, a post in which he remained until 1952. Menon&#x27;s distrust of the West extended to the United Kingdom, and his opposition to British political manoeuvres led MI5 to deem him a &quot;serious menace to security&quot;. From 1929 onwards, Menon had been kept under surveillance, with a warrant to intercept his correspondence being issued in December 1933, identifying him as an &quot;important worker in the Indian revolutionary movement&quot;. Clandestine surveillance intensified following Menon&#x27;s 1946 meeting in Paris with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, and Indian independence. In 2007, hundreds of pages of MI5 files documenting their coverage of Menon were released, including transcripts of phone conversations and intercepted correspondences with other statesmen and Nehru himself.

During his tenure as the high commissioner, Menon was accused of being involved in the &quot;jeep scandal case&quot;, it was the first alleged case of corruption in independent India. In 1948, Menon had ignored protocols and signed a Rs 8 million contract for the purchase of army jeeps with a foreign firm for the Indo-Pakistani war of 1947–1948. The deal was later rescinded by the Indian deputy High Commissioner in London due to the failure of the completion of the order. The investigation into the matter was closed in 1955 after nothing was found against anybody including Menon.

===India&#x27;s representative to the United Nations===

In 1949, Menon accepted the command of the Indian delegation to the United Nations, a position he held until 1962. He headed India&#x27;s diplomatic missions to the United Kingdom and the United Nations, and established himself in diplomatic matters including the Suez crisis. He engineered solutions to complex international political issues, including a peace plan for Korea, a ceasefire in Indo-China, the deadlocked disarmament talks, and the French withdrawal from the UN over Algeria.

Earlier, he led the overseas wing of the Indian independence movement, launching the India League in London in 1928, rallying within the United Kingdom to win public support for Indian independence, and of world powers such as the Soviet Union.

====Diplomacy and non-alignment====
During this period, Menon was a spokesman for Nehru&#x27;s foreign policy, dubbed non-alignment in 1952, charting a third course between the US and the Soviet Union. Menon was critical of the United States, and expressed sympathies with Soviet policies, earning the ire of many Indians by voting against a UN resolution calling for the USSR to withdraw troops from Hungary, although he reversed his stance three weeks later under pressure from New Delhi.

In 1966, Indira Gandhi had consulted Menon for drafting Vietnam plan which called for international effort to rehabilitate Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia and criticised the United States for its role in the Vietnam War.

====China and the United Nations====
Menon also supported the admission of China to the United Nations, which earned him the enmity of many American statesmen, including Senator William F. Knowland. In 1955, Menon intervened in the case of several American airmen who had been held by China, meeting with Chinese premier Zhou Enlai before flying to Washington to confer with and counsel American President Dwight Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, at the request of British Prime Minister Anthony Eden.

====Nuclear disarmament====
Menon was an opponent of nuclear weapons, and partnered with many in his quest against their proliferation.

====Suez Crisis====
During the Suez Crisis, Menon attempted to persuade Gamal Nasser to compromise with the West, and facilitated moving Western powers towards an awareness that Nasser might prove willing to compromise. During the emergency conference on Suez convened in London, Menon, invited by British Prime Minister Anthony Eden, offered a counterproposal to John Foster Dulles&#x27; plan for resolution, in which Egypt would be allowed to retain control of the Suez Canal.

While known for his alignment with the British Labour party and its Commonwealth analogues, by the 1950s, world diplomats referred to Menon&#x27;s allies, comprising Eden, British foreign minister Selwyn Lloyd, Canadian foreign minister and future premier Lester Pearson, Australian foreign minister and future governor-general Richard Casey, particularly to the fury of US Secretary of State Dean Acheson. Menon&#x27;s proposal was estimated by US diplomats to have more support than the Dulles plan, and was viewed as an attempt to hybridise the Dulles plan with Egypt&#x27;s claims. The Dulles plan passed, with Menon voting against, alongside Russia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. Menon, however, softened his opposition in the final hours, leaving Soviet Foreign Minister Dmitri Shepilov in contraposition.

====Speech on Kashmir====
On 23 January 1957 Menon delivered an eight-hour speech defending India&#x27;s stand on Kashmir. To date, the speech is the longest delivered in the United Nations, covering five hours of the 762nd meeting on 23 January, and two hours and forty-eight minutes on the 24th, concluding with Menon&#x27;s collapse on the Security Council floor. Between the two parts, Menon collapsed from exhaustion and had to be hospitalized.

During the filibuster, Nehru went onto consolidate Indian power in Kashmir. Menon&#x27;s defence of Indian sovereignty in Kashmir enlarged his base of support in India, and led to the Indian press dubbing him the &quot;Hero of Kashmir&quot;.

===Minister of Defence===
Krishna Menon became a member of the Rajya Sabha in 1953 from Madras. In 1956, he joined the Union Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio and was made Minister of Defence in April 1957, after winning the North Mumbai seat to the Lok Sabha.

Menon developed India&#x27;s domestic military-industrial complex and educational systems. During his reign as defence minister, India saw establishment of the Sainik Schools, the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), and other defence and military institutions, while professionalizing the National Cadet Corps and similar entities.

Menon brought with him a degree of governmental, public, and international attention that India&#x27;s military had not previously known. He suspended the seniority system within the army, replacing it with a merit-based method of promotion, and restructured much of India&#x27;s military command system, eventually leading to the resignation of the Chief of the Army Staff, General K.S. Thimayya.

====Congo Crisis====

In 1960, Menon remarked on Congo crisis that freedom for African countries meant not only political independence but also the right to be able to develop economically and defend themselves from subversion from both inside and outside the country. Menon criticized the Belgians for not providing military training to the Congolese before leaving the country. In 1961, Nehru sent an Indian Army brigade of about 4,700 troops for the United Nations Operation in the Congo.

====Annexation of Portuguese India====
The annexation of Goa was linked with the 1961 elections to the Lok Sabha. Menon addressed the issue of Indian sovereignty over the Portuguese colony of Goa, in a partial reprise of his earlier defence of Kashmir. In New York, Menon met US Ambassador and two-time presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson behind closed doors, before meeting with President John F. Kennedy, who had expressed his reservations about Menon&#x27;s anti-imperialism during the state visit of Nehru. Menon lectured Kennedy on the importance of US-Soviet compromise, before returning to India. On 17 December 1961, Menon and the Indian Army overran Goa, leading to Western condemnation. Menon dismissed the admonishments of Kennedy and Stevenson as &quot;vestige(s) of Western imperialism&quot;. Indian annexation of Goa had subtle ramifications throughout Asia, as in the case of Indonesian president Sukarno, who refrained from invading the Portuguese colony of East Timor partially from fear of being compared to Menon. The invasion also spawned a complex mass of legal issues relating to differences between eastern and western interpretations of United Nations law and jurisdiction.

====The Sino-Indian War====
In 1962 China attacked India, leading to the Sino-Indian War, and a temporary reversal in India&#x27;s non-aligned foreign policy. On 14 October, about 6 days before the war, Menon gave a speech in Bangalore where he announced that India would fight &quot;to the last man, to the last gun&quot;. Menon was criticised both inside and outside parliament for his handling of the conflict. The Indian government&#x27;s analysis, the Henderson Brooks–Bhagat Report remains classified. Menon believed that Pakistan – not China – is the real threat on the border. Menon was held responsible for India&#x27;s lack of military preparation to repel China in the full-scale war to the extent that Indian politicians invested more effort in getting Menon removed than in actually waging war. Menon had resigned on 31 October 1962 as Minister of Defence. Nevertheless, Menon remained a counselor to Nehru and continued to assist the Indian government with foreign policy.

===As a Supreme Court advocate===

Following his resignation from the cabinet ministry, Menon practiced as a Senior Advocate in the Supreme Court with a group of lawyers. He specifically focused on the Labour matters and he took them up without taking any fees. Former Supreme Court Judge V. R. Krishna Iyer remarked Menon&#x27;s legal career as: &quot;Great human causes, not petty problems, find the jurist in him. He is halting in humdrum areas but heroic in the higher values of our legalpolitical system.&quot;

==Elections==
===Rajya Sabha===
Menon was elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1953 from Madras.

===1957===
In 1957, Menon sought a seat in the Lok Sabha, contesting a constituency from North Mumbai. Admired for his defence of India&#x27;s sovereignty in Kashmir on the world stage, Menon was met with rapturous receptions on the campaign trail, and won in a contest against PSP candidate Alvares Peter Augustus by 47,741 votes (171,708 to 123,967).

===1961===

In October 1961, Menon, the sitting Defence Minister, was challenged by the 74-year-old Acharya Kripalani, a previous president of the Indian National Congress. The race, which witnessed the direct intervention of Jawaharlal Nehru, was viewed as of importance due to the personas and influence of the two candidates. Having previously endorsed Menon&#x27;s foreign policies, Kripalani attacked Menon&#x27;s persona, seeking to avoid confrontation with the prestige of Nehru and the Congress Party. Menon won nearly doubling the vote total of Kripalani, and winning majorities in all six of North Mumbai&#x27;s districts. The electoral results established Menon as second to Nehru in Indian politics.

===1967===
In 1967, Menon was denied a seat from Mumbai by the Congress on the grounds that he was a non-Maharashtrian after Congress leadership in Delhi had succumbed to the demands of the Bombay Provincial Congress Committee. This move by the committee had appalled Prime Minister Indira Gandhi who remarked that: &quot;Here is a question of whom the party wants and whom the people want. My position among people is uncontested.&quot; Menon resigned from the Congress and stood for elections as an independent candidate from the North East Mumbai constituency, of which he was the sitting member of parliament. He lost to the Congress candidate, Mr. S.G. Barve, a retired ICS officer, by a margin of 13,169 votes. Mr. Barve died later that year, and his sister, Mrs. Tara Sapre, contested the by-election which ensued as the Congress candidate. Menon again stood as an independent, and lost to Mrs. Tara Sapre by a wider margin than had been the case with her brother. In both, 1967 and 1969 elections, Shiv Sena had campaigned for both of the Congress candidates.

===1969===
In 1969, Menon contested a seat in the Lok Sabha from the Bengal constituency of Midnapore, running as an independent in a by-election, and defeating his Congress rival by a margin of 106,767 votes in May of that year.

===1971===

In 1971, Menon contested as an independent candidate and was elected to the Lok Sabha from Trivandrum, in his home state of Kerala.

==Legacy==
===Evaluations===
Menon was a significant figure of the Indian politics during his life, and has remained so even well after his death. In response to US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles&#x27; assertion that US weapons supplied to Pakistan were intended for defence against a Soviet invasion, Menon stated that &quot;the world has yet to see an American gun that can only shoot in one direction&quot;, and that &quot;I am yet to come across a vegetarian tiger&quot;. In London, Menon responded to novelist Brigid Brophy: &quot;my English is better than yours. You merely picked it up: I learnt it.&quot; When criticised for the Rolls-Royces he kept as official vehicles, he replied, &quot;I can scarcely hire a bullock-cart to call on 10 Downing Street&quot;. 

Indian President R. Venkataraman described him as &quot;the epitome of a representative of the Indian State, personally abstemious but at the same time uncompromising in maintaining the prestige of his high office.&quot;

His meteroic rise was resented by many senior Congress leaders. At one time some used to believe that he would become successor to Nehru. Some of his Indian colleagues had a mixed view. Foreign Secretary Subimal Dutt commented that Menon, &quot;did not always measure his words&quot;, while statesman K. R. Narayanan said, &quot;India has been fortunate to have had not only a glorious heritage of culture and civilisation but a succession of great men from the Buddha to Gandhi, from Ashoka to Nehru, from Kautilya to Krishna Menon.&quot;

Menon was reviled by Western statesmen who loathed his arrogance and anti-Western stances. American President Dwight D. Eisenhower considered Menon a &quot;menace&quot;, governed by ambition to prove himself the international manipulator and politician of the age&quot;. Western publications referred to him as &quot;India&#x27;s Rasputin&quot; or &quot;Nehru&#x27;s Evil Genius&quot;.

Menon&#x27;s role in the development of India&#x27;s military infrastructure has attracted attention of analysts and scholars with regards to the importance of Menon&#x27;s vision and foresight in military development. Political figures as varied as President and Minister of Defence R. Venkataraman and Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer of the Supreme Court of India have analysed and defended Menon&#x27;s role in India&#x27;s rise as a military power. Menon is often noted as the architect of self-sufficiency in India&#x27;s defence production.

=== Intellectual reputation ===
Whether by his supporters or critics, Menon inspired adulation as well as detraction in both India and the West. To his supporters, he was an advocate of India in the face of Western imperialism, who &quot;taught the white man his place&quot;. According to &quot;The Tribune&quot;, &quot;Few Indians have dominated global politics or aroused as much awe and antagonism as V. K. Krishna Menon, one of the prominent personalities of the 20th century.

As a student, his tutor, Harold Laski, described him as the &quot;best&quot; and &quot;brilliant&quot; student he had, and the only one from whom he had learnt anything. While his thesis supervisor, Charles Spearman, in reviewing his work with C.E. Beeby, judged that &quot;by virtue of intense intellectual study, together with natural capacity, he appears to have acquired mastery of psychological science. Furthermore he has shown capacities for both original investigation and also for exposition. He has, I believe, a distinguished career before him.&quot;

Another supervisor, John Flugel, predicted that when published Menon&#x27;s dissertation &quot;would (render him) one of the young and brilliant psychologists of this century.&quot; Bertrand Russell remarked that Menon was a &quot;particularly brilliant young man&quot; and &quot;an exceptionally gifted and experienced speaker and typically representative of the advanced thought of modern young India&quot;.

P.N. Haksar attested to the &quot;vastness of his intellectual perception&quot;. “From a intellectual point of view, I cannot remember having met any person with a keener intellect”, commented Nehru in 1951. Shashi Tharoor, while noting his intolerance of those intellectually inferior to him and habitual rudeness, nonetheless highlighted his &quot;brilliance and intellectual stamina&#x27; and mastery &quot;of the extensive discourse on world affairs, human history and international politics that Menon so magisterially managed.&quot; Swedish Ambassador Alva Myrdal attributed Menon&#x27;s hold over Nehru to Menon&#x27;s brilliance and for being the &quot;only genuinely intellectual foil Nehru had in his government, with whom he could discuss Marx and Mill, Dickens and Dostoevsky.
==Death==

Menon fell ill about three months before his death when he was in London to attend a musical event, organised for raising donations for Nehru memorial fund. He was hospitalised on 4 October following exhaustion. He died at the age of 78 due to heart attack on 6 October 1974.

Indian President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed said on his death that the country has lost an &quot;eminent statesman and great leader&quot;. He added that:

&quot;Menon was an intrepid fighter for the freedom of the country and carried on the struggle from England. He served free India with remarkable distinction and played a crucial role in the international forum. His mastery of the world, legal acumen and oratorical skill were always used to serve great causes.&quot;

Prime Minister Indira Gandhi described Menon as &quot;unusually forceful contemporary who has left a distinctive mark on our political life&quot;. She added that:

&quot;A volcano is extinct. Krishna Menon was a person of deep conviction, great intellectual power and passionate dedication to the country&#x27;s cause. His pioneering work as spokesman of our freedom movement in Europe and as a link with radical movements of other countries is part of our nation&#x27;s history. After independence he was one of the most eloquent exponents in the United Nations and other world forums, of policy of non-alignment and peaceful co-existence and our opposition to all forms of colonialism and racialism.&quot;

James Callaghan, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and later PM of the United Kingdom, said:

&quot;Krishna Menon was a man of remarkable talents and personality would have shone in any circumstances and at any time but for us he was also the embodiment of the movement within Britain for India&#x27;s freedom.&quot;

An all-party meeting of the members of parliament was held in Central Hall of Parliament to mourn Menon&#x27;s death. On his funeral, wreaths were placed by president Ahmed, vice-president B. D. Jatti, PM Indira Gandhi and her cabinet members, MPs and also high commissioner for Britain and the Egyptian ambassador. Louis Mountbatten, Jayaprakash Narayan, J. B. Kripalani and other prominent figures also shared their condolences.

==Personal life==

In private, Menon abstained from tobacco, alcohol and meat, fasting for days, and forwent his luxury townhouse in Kensington Palace Gardens in favour of a single room in the Indian High Commission during his official tenure in London. As high commissioner, Menon drew the token salary of one rupee per month, later refusing a salary outright. Menon dressed publicly in bespoke suits, earning him the epithet &quot;Mephistopheles in a Savile Row suit&quot;.

==Awards==

In 1954, Menon was awarded with the Padma Vibhushan. In 1968, he was awarded with the Syrian Order of Merit by the Syrian President Nureddin al-Atassi. In 2008 he was posthumously awarded with the Order of the Companions of O. R. Tambo.

==Commemoration==

The V. K. Krishna Menon Institute was established in 2006 to commemorate and facilitate the life, times and achievements of Menon. One of the Institute&#x27;s objectives include awarding people from India and diaspora from Asia for their accomplishments in the fields of science, literature, economics, politics, diplomacy and human rights. A blue plaque commemorating Menon was placed at 30 Langdon Park Road, in Highgate, London by English Heritage in 2013.

<text>A company store is a retail store selling a limited range of food, clothing and daily necessities to employees of a company. It is typical of a company town in a remote area where virtually everyone is employed by one firm, such as a coal mine. In a company town, the housing is owned by the company but there may be independent stores there or nearby.

Employee-only company stores often accept scrip or non-cash vouchers issued by the company in advance of periodic cash paychecks, and gives credit to employees before payday. Except in very remote areas, company stores in mining towns became scarcer after the miners bought automobiles and could travel to a range of stores. Even so, the stores could survive because they provided convenience and easy credit. Company stores served numerous additional functions, as well, such as a locus for the government post office, and as the cultural and community center where people could freely gather.

Company stores were monopolistic institutions, funneling workers&#x27; incomes back to the owners of the company. This is because company stores often faced little or no competition for workers&#x27; earnings on account of their geographical remoteness, the inability and/or unwillingness of other nearby merchants (if any existed) to accept company scrip, or both. Prices, therefore, were typically high. Allowing purchases on credit enforced a kind of debt slavery, obligating employees to remain with the company until the debt was cleared.

Regarding this reputation, economic historian Price V. Fishback wrote:
&quot;The company store is one of the most reviled and misunderstood of economic institutions. In song, folktale, and union rhetoric the company store was often cast as a villain, a collector of souls through perpetual debt peonage. Nicknames, like the &quot;pluck me&quot; and more obscene versions that cannot appear in a family newspaper, seem to point to exploitation. The attitudes carry over into the scholarly literature, which emphasizes that the company store was a monopoly.&quot;
The songs Fishback mentions include the popular song &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot;, which contains such lines as &quot;Saint Peter, don&#x27;t you call me, &#x27;cuz I can&#x27;t go. I owe my soul to the company store.&quot;

===Mexico===

In Mexico, during the Porfiriato period (late 1800 to early 1900), the &quot;tiendas de raya&quot; (company stores) were a prominent symbol of labor and peasant exploitation. These stores, operated by the owners of haciendas or factories, sold essential items to workers, often at inflated prices and typically paying with vouchers instead of cash. This kept workers in a continuous debt cycle to the hacienda or company, binding them almost like slaves to the land or industrial work without the possibility of escaping poverty.

A notable instance of the oppressive nature of tiendas de raya occurred in the early 1900s at Río Blanco, Veracruz, home to Mexico&#x27;s largest cotton mill. Workers there were paid in scrip, which could only be used at the company&#x27;s store. In 1907, textile workers, fed up with this system, went on labor strike and attacked and looted the company store. The Mexican military responded harshly, gunning down many of the strikers. Despite the tragic violence, the aftermath saw the opening of more retail outlets in Río Blanco, as if to reinforce the tienda de raya system.

From the earliest insurrections of the Mexican revolution, led and promoted by the Mexican Liberal Party, the looting and destruction of the tiendas de raya became key symbolic and strategic actions. With the actual outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910, this resentment intensified. The deep social discontent, built up after years of exploitation, was primarily directed towards these stores and their managers.

Finally, in 1915, Venustiano Carranza, one of the revolutionary leaders and eventual president of Mexico, took decisive action against this oppressive system. By his order, the tiendas de raya were eliminated across the country, marking a significant shift in the fight for social and economic justice. This act was intended not only to relieve the direct economic exploitation of workers but also to break down the economic power that large landowners and businessmen held over the working class.

===Hawaii===
Possibly the first company store in the world was in Hawaii. William Hooper started Hawaiiʻs first sugar plantation in 1835 at Koloa, on the island of Kauai. He hired 23 Hawaiian locals and paid them in a cardboard scrip, notated in various amounts. The scrip could only be exchanged for merchandise at his store.

<text>Rocket from the Crypt is an American punk rock band from San Diego, California, originally active from 1990 to 2005, then active during 2011 and again from 2013 to the present.

The band gained critical praise and the attention of major record labels after the release of their 1992 album &quot;&quot;, leading to a recording contract with Interscope Records. They experienced a surge of popularity with the release of the albums &quot;Scream, Dracula, Scream!&quot; (1995) and &quot;RFTC&quot; (1998), accompanied by numerous vinyl singles and EPs released on independent labels. However, album sales did not meet expectations and Interscope soon turned their attention to higher-grossing acts. The band left the label, and shortly thereafter drummer Atom Willard departed the group.

After a period of inactivity in 1999 and 2000, during which singer/guitarist John Reis formed Hot Snakes and Sultans and launched his Swami Records label, the band signed to Vagrant Records and recruited new drummer Ruby Mars. They experienced a revitalization of creative energy and released two more albums, but were not as prolific as in the past.

Over the next few years the band members became increasingly involved with other projects and Rocket from the Crypt became less of a focus. They decided to disband in 2005, playing a sold-out farewell show on Halloween in their hometown of San Diego.

The band reunited in 2011 for a one-off appearance on the television program &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot;, and in 2013 reformed once more for a series of performances in the US, Europe and Australia.

Rocket From the Crypt have had a significant impact on alternative music, being cited as an influence by such bands as Jimmy Eat World, the Get Up Kids, and Unbroken.

==Band history==
===Formation===
After the breakup of his post-hardcore band Pitchfork in 1990, Reis formed both Rocket from the Crypt and Drive Like Jehu in July and August of that year respectively. Envisioned as a punk-inspired rock and roll band, Rocket from the Crypt&#x27;s original lineup consisted of Reis, guitarist Andy Stamets, bassist Pete Reichert, drummer Sean, and backing vocalist Elaina. The band took their name from the then-defunct 1970s underground punk band Rocket from the Tombs. This lineup lasted roughly six months and recorded the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Paint as a Fragrance&quot;, released in 1991 on local label Cargo Music. At this time, Reis began to use the pseudonym &quot;Speedo&quot; when working with the band. He was also simultaneously performing in Drive Like Jehu, who recorded their debut album around the same time. When Sean and Elaina moved away from San Diego, drummer Adam Willard joined the band under the stage name &quot;Atom.&quot; The rest of the band also assumed stage monikers, with Stamets performing as &quot;ND&quot; and Reichert as &quot;Petey X.&quot;

The band soon added a horn section, recruiting saxophone player Paul &quot;Apollo 9&quot; O&#x27;Beirne. They developed a reputation for their creative and energetic live shows, taking unusual measures to encourage audience participation such as handing out homemade lyric booklets and noisemakers. They released many vinyl singles around this time and began to attract a dedicated underground following. Reis recalls:
&quot;It was really immediate; that&#x27;s why we loved putting out singles early on. We recorded some songs for Sympathy for the Record Industry, and two weeks later, we had some finished copies of them. The turnaround time was amazing. And by the time people were able to get them, it was still under a month. They&#x27;re hearing something that is completely fresh–this is something we&#x27;re doing &quot;at the moment&quot;. We did that for, like, a three-year period.&quot;
Their second album &quot;&quot; was released in 1992, followed by their first tour and music videos for the songs &quot;Ditchdigger&quot; and &quot;Sturdy Wrist.&quot; The band also added a second member to its horn section, bringing in trumpeter Jason &quot;JC 2000&quot; Crane. Around this time Reis announced in a fanzine that all fans with Rocket from the Crypt tattoos would be allowed into the band&#x27;s shows for free, for life, causing tattoos of their logo to become an international phenomenon.

===Signing to Interscope===
Fueled by a label interest in Drive Like Jehu, both Rocket from the Crypt and Drive Like Jehu signed to Interscope Records in 1992, with Rocket negotiating a deal that included the freedom to record vinyl releases for other labels. Many of the band&#x27;s vinyl singles and other rarities were compiled and released as &quot;All Systems Go&quot;, while Interscope re-released &quot;Circa: Now!&quot; and pushed for the band to continue touring in support of the album. Even with market saturation high, however, the band members decided to take a six-month break in 1994 while Reis recorded a second and final album with Drive Like Jehu.

Regrouping after their hiatus, the band experienced a flurry of creative energy that resulted in several more vinyl singles and a trilogy of records in 1995, beginning with the EP &quot;The State of Art is on Fire&quot; and continuing with the critically acclaimed &quot;Hot Charity&quot;. They embarked on a six-week &quot;free tour&quot; in support of &quot;Hot Charity&quot;, with Interscope covering the costs so that fans were not charged admission to any of the band&#x27;s performances across the United States. This was followed by the recording of their first album for Interscope, the critically acclaimed &quot;Scream, Dracula, Scream!&quot; The band took advantage of their large recording budget, bringing in string sections and hiring producers to make the album sound as epic as possible, and it would later be regarded by most as their creative peak. Music videos were filmed for the singles &quot;On a Rope,&quot; &quot;Born in &#x27;69&quot; and &quot;Young Livers&quot; and the band embarked on tours of the US, UK and Europe. They experienced a surge of popularity in the UK, where &quot;On a Rope&quot; entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 12, and was a hit on MTV Europe, earning them rave reviews in &quot;NME&quot; and allowing them to play &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. 1996 also saw them win The Phillip Hall Radar award at the NME awards event.

They were also an alternative rock hit in the US, where their videos were featured on MTV and the band received many positive reviews in both mainstream and underground music presses. Then-ubiquitous MTV VJ Kennedy sported a tattoo of the band&#x27;s logo on her ankle on national television, and increased radio and MTV airplay continued. A large headlining tour ensued in 1996, as well as supporting tours with Rancid and Soundgarden. The band also gained a reputation for a series of interesting and, at times, seemingly ludicrous gimmicks and stage antics which included holding raffles during live performances, spinning a large game show wheel to determine set lists, onstage fire breathing, annual Halloween and New Year&#x27;s shows, and the wearing of coordinated and progressively more ornate stage costumes. In Europe the band also hosted a German variety show, played children&#x27;s shows and morning shows, and did interviews with fashion magazines.

===Lineup change===
In 1998, Rocket from the Crypt released &quot;RFTC&quot;. For the accompanying tour they were joined by Chris Prescott from San Diego bands Tanner and No Knife, who performed as touring percussionist and keyboardist. Though overall reaction was positive and singles &quot;Break it Up&quot; and &quot;Lipstick&quot; received radio airplay, the album failed to sell well. The band settled some contractual obligations and then left their label. In 1999 San Diego music magazine &quot;SLAMM&quot; named them the &quot;best San Diego band of all time&quot; in their coverage of local acts leading up to New Year&#x27;s Eve 2000. The band tried to maintain their creativity with the release of the EP &quot;Cut Carefully and Play Loud&quot; that year, but disagreements between members over the band&#x27;s direction resulted in drummer Atom Willard departing the group in early 2000 (he would go on to act as Weezer&#x27;s drum technician and play in The Special Goodness, later becoming permanent drummer in both The Offspring and Angels &amp; Airwaves). Rocket took a brief hiatus, during which Reis launched his own record label Swami Records and released a second rarities collection called &quot;All Systems Go 2&quot;, as well as debut albums by his newly formed bands Hot Snakes and Sultans.

===Signing to Vagrant===
In 2000, the band signed to independent label Vagrant Records and began work on the album &quot;Group Sounds&quot;, with Superchunk drummer Jon Wurster filling in on drums. Partway through the recording process they recruited San Diego drummer and professional skateboarder Mario Rubalcaba as their full-time drummer, giving him the stage name &quot;Ruby Mars.&quot; The addition of Rubalcaba gave the band renewed energy, and &quot;Group Sounds&quot; was released in 2001 to positive reviews. Some touring followed, but band members drifted into other projects and Rocket became less the focus. In 2002 Rocket released what would prove to be their final studio album, &quot;Live From Camp X-Ray&quot;, after which Reis devoted more energy to recording and touring with Hot Snakes and Sultans and to signing and producing bands for his Swami label. Rocket would perform infrequently over the next few years.

===Demise===
In August 2005, after breaking up Hot Snakes, Reis announced that Rocket from the Crypt would play their final show that Halloween in San Diego. After a final east coast performance in New York, they played a farewell show before a capacity crowd at the Westin Horton Plaza Hotel in downtown San Diego on Halloween, which was filmed for a DVD release.

Following the band&#x27;s breakup Reis focused his energy on running Swami Records and continued to play with the Sultans until their breakup in January 2007. He then formed The Night Marchers, with whom he currently performs. Reichert founded and runs the online merchandise company Merch Lackey. O&#x27;Beirne teaches project management and marketing at a San Diego high school, while Crane left San Diego semi-permanently for Belize. Stamets continues to perform in San Diego-area bands such as Beehive &amp; the Barracudas. Rubalcaba became part-owner of the independent record store Thirsty Moon Records in the Hillcrest area of San Diego and plays with the bands Earthless and Off!. He also joined Reis in the Sultans for infrequent performances until that group&#x27;s breakup in January 2007.

Swami Records released a &quot;rough cut&quot; of the Rocket from the Crypt farewell concert DVD in October 2006, but a fire at the offices of Fourth Project, the video company producing the DVD, pushed back the final version. It was eventually released in February 2008 as a CD/DVD set entitled &quot;R.I.P.&quot; A third installment in their rarities series, &quot;All Systems Go 3&quot;, was released on August 28, 2008. A fourth, and final, volume of the All Systems Go series is in the works, and will be a CD/DVD set.

===Reunion===
Rocket from the Crypt reunited, with drummer Adam Willard, in October 2011 for an episode of the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot; Reis, who plays a recurring role on the show as &quot;The Swami&quot;, remarked that the band was &quot;only interested in playing to audiences of 5 to 10 people between the ages of 3 to 6&quot; and would &quot;most likely never play as a band ever again&quot;. They performed an original song, &quot;He&#x27;s a Chef&quot;, which was released as a single exclusively through Volcom clothing stores. In December 2012 the band announced a full reunion, resulting in gigs in the US, Europe and Australia. In March 2015, &quot;Vintage Piss&quot; was released by Sonny Vincent and Rocket from the Crypt. The album was originally recorded with Vincent in 2003 following a tour with Rocket from the Crypt serving as his backing band however the album was left unmixed and unfinished until twelve years later following the reunion of Rocket from the Crypt when John Reis decided to go back and complete the album, which he also produced.

The band continues to play sporadically, and regularly performs their annual Halloween show.

<text>George Rayner Hoff (27 November 1894 – 19 November 1937) was a British-born sculptor who mainly worked in Australia. He fought in World War I and is chiefly known for his war memorial work, particularly the sculptures on the Anzac War Memorial in Sydney.

==Early life and training==

Hoff was born on the Isle of Man, the son of a stone and wood carver of Dutch descent. He began helping his father on architectural commissions at a very young age and attended the Nottingham School of Art where he studied drawing, design, and modelling, from 1910 to 1915. During World War I, he was in the British Army and fought in the trenches in France, an experience from which he was to draw most passionately in the creation of his various war memorials. Later in the war, he made maps based on aerial photographs.

Returning from the trenches following the War he enrolled in the Royal College of Art in London studying under Francis Derwent Wood for three years. In 1922, Hoff won the British Prix de Rome which allowed him the opportunity to study in Rome. There he did little work in sculpture beyond making sketch models but drew much and mentally studied the many examples of classical and Renaissance art to be found in that country. In May 1923, on the recommendation of Sir George Frampton, R.A., and F. Derwent Wood, R.A., he became director of sculpture and drawing at the East Sydney Technical College (Australia) and set up his private studio. In 1933, he was named the head of the ESTC Art School.

==Australian work==


Hoff came to Australia as a young man of 28. He soon adapted himself to Australian conditions, and his quiet, slightly whimsical personality made him generally liked. He was a quick worker and an artist of great originality, although his work, originally based on the Greeks, shows he had paid attention to tradition. He had studied much that was best in Italian work of the Renaissance, the Assyrian friezes, the attempt to retain only the essentials, characteristic of some of the moderns, and the simple sincerity of the Chinese.

His modelling is in a lyrical, classical art-deco manner which effortlessly combines sensuous curves with geometric line patterns.

Hoff&#x27;s coming to Sydney was a great gain to Australia. He speedily reorganized the school and succeeded in winning the enthusiasm of the students. He became a member of the Society of Artists and later the Sculptors’ Society of Australia, and submitted work to their exhibitions and competitions. In 1924 he designed the Society of Artists&#x27; medal, and in 1927 was responsible for sculpture for the National War Memorial at Adelaide. In the same year he was awarded the Wynne prize at Sydney. His best-known works are the figures on the exterior of the Anzac War Memorial in Hyde Park, Sydney, the central group in the interior, and the bronze reliefs. The figures on the exterior and the interior group, including &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, are cited by sculptor, Ron Robertson-Swann as &quot;Sydney&#x27;s most moving example of publicly visible architecture&quot;. Art historian, Professor Virginia Spate, wrote in 1999: &quot;Even incomplete, [it] is the most perfect sculptural monument in Australia.&quot; An example of his sculpture associated with architecture is at the University of Sydney, where four medallion portraits of great scientists are on the façade of the physics building.

Rayner also produced a variety of smaller work, built up a fine school of sculpture, and in 1934 was commissioned to design the Victorian centenary medal. His use of a ram&#x27;s head as the design for one side of it was much criticised, and it is not one of his most successful efforts. At the time of his death on 19 November 1937 he was engaged on the George V Memorial for Canberra. He had recently been commissioned to design part of the new coinage for the Commonwealth, and earlier in 1937 had become an invited foundation member of Robert Menzies&#x27; anti-modernist organisation, the Australian Academy of Art.

Among his works is the emblem of the Holden Australian car company, a stylised &#x27;Lion and Stone&#x27; symbol representing a legend of man&#x27;s invention of the wheel.

== Architectural sculpture ==
The Anzac War Memorial, completed in 1934, is the main commemorative military monument in Sydney, designed by C. Bruce Dellit, has an exterior adorned with monumental figural reliefs and sculptures by Rayner Hoff, and is arguably the finest Art Deco structure in Australia.

<text>The Gelfond–Schneider constant or Hilbert number is two to the power of the square root of two:
:2 ≈ ...
which was proved to be a transcendental number by Rodion Kuzmin in 1930.
In 1934, Aleksandr Gelfond and Theodor Schneider independently proved the more general &quot;Gelfond–Schneider theorem&quot;, which solved the part of Hilbert&#x27;s seventh problem described below.

==Properties==

The square root of the Gelfond–Schneider constant is the transcendental number 
:formula_1 ...

This same constant can be used to prove that &quot;an irrational elevated to an irrational power may be rational&quot;, even without first proving its transcendence. The proof proceeds as follows: either formula_2 is a rational which proves the theorem, or it is irrational (as it turns out to be) and then
:formula_3
is an irrational to an irrational power that is a rational which proves the theorem. The proof is not constructive, as it does not say which of the two cases is true, but it is much simpler than Kuzmin&#x27;s proof.

==Hilbert&#x27;s seventh problem==

Part of the seventh of Hilbert&#x27;s twenty-three problems posed in 1900 was to prove, or find a counterexample to, the claim that &quot;ab&quot; is always transcendental for algebraic &quot;a&quot; ≠ 0, 1 and irrational algebraic &quot;b&quot;. In the address he gave two explicit examples, one of them being the Gelfond–Schneider constant 2.

In 1919, he gave a lecture on number theory and spoke of three conjectures: the Riemann hypothesis, Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, and the transcendence of 2. He mentioned to the audience that he didn&#x27;t expect anyone in the hall to live long enough to see a proof of this result. But the proof of this number&#x27;s transcendence was published by Kuzmin in 1930, well within Hilbert&#x27;s own lifetime. Namely, Kuzmin proved the case where the exponent &quot;b&quot; is a real quadratic irrational, which was later extended to an arbitrary algebraic irrational &quot;b&quot; by Gelfond and by Schneider.

Attempting to break into show business at a time when there was much prejudice against Latino performers, Victor professionally adopted the surname &quot;Argo&quot; to better his casting chances, stating in an interview that he &quot;felt the prejudice was against the name, not even against me.&quot; While performing in an Off-Broadway play during the 1960s, Argo met Yoko Ono, with whom he participated in the so-called &quot;Happening&quot; movement. He met Harvey Keitel during the early stages of his career; the two actors remained close friends for nearly forty years and worked together on several films, including &quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot; which Argo helped persuade Keitel to accept the lead role for. In 1977, Argo became a founding member of the Riverside Shakespeare Company on New York City&#x27;s Upper West Side. As a member, he toured the parks of Manhattan playing Lord Montague. 

In the 1970s, Argo made his film debut with a small part in &quot;Unholy Rollers&quot; and his television debut in a made-for-TV film &quot;Smile Jenny, You&#x27;re Dead&quot;. Often playing the part of the New York City &#x27;heavy&#x27; or mobster on film, Argo was a favorite of such directors as Martin Scorsese, Abel Ferrara and Woody Allen. His film credits include &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, &quot;King of New York&quot;, &quot;The Rose&quot;, &quot;New York Stories&quot;, &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;, &quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot;, &quot;True Romance&quot; and &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;. He played the father of Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s character in the 2001 romantic drama &quot;Angel Eyes&quot;. His television guest appearances include &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. Argo lent his talents to seventy-five films and twenty-one television guest roles in total.

Outside of acting on the screen and stage, another deep passion for Argo was country music, the actor at one time having traveled to Nashville to cut several song demos.

==Later years==
Shortly before his death, Argo realized a lifelong dream of performing on Broadway when he was cast as Santiago, the owner of a cigar factory, in the Pulitzer Prize-winning drama &quot;Anna in the Tropics&quot;. In his last on-screen role, in the independent film &quot;Lustre&quot; by director Art Jones, Argo portrayed a New York City loan shark who retreats from his everyday, hard-nosed rants to a deeply spiritual disconnect from the world. The film was released in 2005. Argo died in New York City at Saint Vincent&#x27;s Catholic Medical Center on April 7, 2004, from complications of lung cancer at age 69. His body was donated to Manhattan College for medical science. In 2005, Electronic music group Bodega System released a 12&quot; vinyl LP which includes the track &quot;Victor Argo&quot;.

<doc id="886873" wikidata="Q460540" url="?curid=886873" title="The Tussauds Group">
<text>The Tussauds Group was an entertainment company which is now a part of Merlin Entertainments. It was based in Poole, Dorset from where it managed a portfolio of brands and over 50 attractions that included the Madame Tussauds waxworks, Legoland Theme Parks, Legoland Discovery Centres, Sea Life Centres, PortAventura Park in Spain, Gardaland in Italy, Heide Park Resort in Germany, The Dungeons, The London Eye, The Blackpool Tower attractions, The Orlando Eye, Warwick Castle, Alton Towers, Thorpe Park, and Chessington World of Adventures.

Merlin Entertainments bought the company in 2007, thus becoming the world&#x27;s second largest leisure group after Disney.

== History ==
=== The 1700s ===
The physician, Philippe Curtius began to create organs and biological structures from wax. After creating organs, Curtius went on to recreate notable people in society out of the medium too. Curtius put these models on display to the public in Berne, Switzerland where they caught the attention of the French royal family. In 1765, the royal family invited Curtius to display his exhibits in Paris. When moving to Paris, Curtius bought with him a housekeeper and her daughter, Marie Grosholtz, who Curtius then took on as an apprentice of his work.

Under Curtius’ teaching, Marie became renowned for her modelling, completing portraits of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire. This led to Marie being invited to the royal court at Versailles where she was employed as a teacher. In 1795, Marie married François Tussaud with whom she had two sons. After the French Revolution in 1789, Marie continued her modelling and made death masks of her deceased ex-employers. Upon the death of Curtius in 1794, Marie inherited his estate, including his properties and his workshop.

=== The 1800s ===
Overseas interest in the French Revolution led Marie Tussaud to travel to England and display her work there. Tussaud travelled the British Isles with her work as she was prevented from returning to France due to the war between Britain and France. After travelling with her models, Tussauds bought her first property in London&#x27;s Baker Street in 1835, for the purpose of displaying her wax figures. The large property allowed her to display the exhibits that she used on tour as well as create new models and exhibitions. Marie Tussaud died in 1850 and the business was left to her two sons. Her grandchildren then moved the business to a permanent residence in Marylebone Road.

=== The 1900s ===

In 1926, Madame Tussauds became a limited company. In the 1960s, Tussauds was looking to expand beyond the United Kingdom and opened their first international exhibition in Amsterdam. This exhibition featured different wax figures to those on show in London. The Dutch exhibition moved to the more central location of Dam Square in 1991. The company made its first acquisition with Wookey Hole Caves and Mill in Somerset and in 1976 bought Tolgus tin plant in Cornwall.

In 1978, Madame Tussauds was acquired by S. Pearson and Son, now Pearson PLC. The company had been seeking to expand beyond their own attractions before acquiring the group. Chessington Zoo was already owned by Pearson and became a Tussauds attraction after the buyout. This sector expanded quickly throughout the year with the purchase of Warwick Castle. Poor profits at Chessington Zoo led the group to reopen the site as Chessington World of Adventures. This incorporated the animals from the zoo alongside the theme park. This combination enabled visitor figures to triple.

In 1989, the Tussauds Group sold Wookey Hole. In the same year, they opened the Rock Circus in the London Pavilion which focused on a rock and roll theme. Several other small acquisitions were made before 1990.

In 1990, the company bought Alton Towers for £60 million. The park had initially been developed as an American style amusement park but was in need of renovation by the end of the eighties. After Tussauds took over Alton Towers, it was redeveloped into a theme park that intended to challenge the opening of Disneyland Paris. During the mid-nineties, the group continued to expand its theme parks with new attractions at both Warwick Castle and Alton Towers. The Alton Towers expansion included the introduction of the £20 million Alton Towers Hotel in 1996. The Madame Tussauds site in London also underwent development during the nineties, with renovations costing £1 million. The increase in the group&#x27;s attractions as well as management portfolio meant that in 1992 the company moved to larger headquarters.

In 1997, Madame Tussauds reintroduced travelling exhibitions. The tour started in Melbourne, Australia, before moving on to Sydney. After touring Australia, the site travelled to Singapore in 1999 then on to Hong Kong in 2000. However, the company liked Hong Kong&#x27;s location and established a permanent exhibition in the Peak Tower.

The Tussauds group moved into the European market in 1995, with a 40% stake in a new £300 million theme park, Port Aventura in Spain. Tussauds was in charge of the development as they were the primary shareholder. The new development quickly bought in 2.7 million new visitors annually. The 40% stake was sold in 1998 as the company looked to increase its portfolio in the United Kingdom. Tussauds’ management of Port Aventura ceased with the sale of the property. The money from the sale allowed the company to purchase Thorpe Park, in south-east England.

In 1998, the group looked to open a Tussauds site in Las Vegas, with plans to open the exhibition in the Venetian Hotel and Casino complex. The Las Vegas site eventually opened in 1999 to large success, which led the company to look for another exhibition location in the United States. In 2000, the company opened a site in New York on 42nd Street.

In 1999, after being part of Pearson for twenty years, Charterhouse Development Capital acquired the group. The new company bought in new management and sought to increase profits whilst continuing the company&#x27;s growth.

=== The 2000s ===
In 2000, the London Eye launched, in which Tussauds had a 33% stake, along with British Airways and Marks Barfield. The site was managed by Tussauds and soon became one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s most popular attractions.

Tussauds continued to look for acquisitions in Europe and in 2002 opted to buy Heide Park in Soltau, Germany. The park was among the country&#x27;s largest, and helped to make Tussauds one of the most popular attraction groups. In the same year, the company shut down the Rock Circus exhibition in the London Pavilion because of falling visitor figures.

Charterhouse Development Capital allowed the company to invest £300 million into its attractions which helped increase profits by £185 million as of 2002. The Tussauds group launched a new £100 million investment plan which led to the development of a new £40 million themed hotel, at Alton Towers. The themed hotel, Splash Landings, opened in 2003. Tussauds and Charterhouse Development Capital then looked to increase its stake in the London Eye, hoping to buy out British Airways.

In 2004, one of the shareholders of the London Eye, Marks Barfield, accused the Tussauds group of purposefully opposing a refinancing offer in order to gain full control of the wheel. The attraction made a trading profit, but the company had 25% interest payments on a debt that arose from a £56 million loan from British Airways in 1999. By this point the debt had accumulated to be around £130 million. David Marks, the director at Marks Barfield, said that British Airways supported the idea of refinancing the London Eye but the Tussauds group blocked the deal at every opportunity. Marks went on to comment that without a refinancing deal the London Eye would not have long-term financial security in the future as it would not be able to develop as an attraction. The company also went on to say that the running costs of the London Eye and the large debt repayments prevented the company from making developments at the attraction that would cost £4 million. The company had hoped to redevelop a gift shop and the ticketing system at the London Eye but without refinancing it would not be able to complete them. The Tussauds group denied blocking any deals, in turn suggesting that no alternative methods had been put forward. In a statement, the company said that it had offered to buy out the other two shareholders in 2003, and again in 2004, believing that one primary shareholder would be able to negotiate better terms on their debt repayments.

In November 2005, the company bought British Airways’ stake in the London Eye for £95 million. The other shareholder, Marks Barfield, also offered to buy British Airways&#x27; stake but the latter chose the Tussauds group as they felt that their offer was more beneficial for the company&#x27;s shareholders. In February 2006, the group began negotiations to buy the final 33% of the attraction from Marks Barfield for up to £80 million.

In 2005, the Tussauds group was sold to Dubai International Capital, a branch of the government that deals with investment, for £800 million ($1.5 billion).

In May 2007, The Blackstone Group purchased The Tussauds Group for US$1.9 billion and merged it into Merlin Entertainments with management by Merlin. Dubai International Capital then held 20% of Merlin Entertainment. The Tussauds Group as a separate entity ceased to exist. About the merger, the chief executive of Merlin Entertainment, Nick Varney, said that the combination of the two groups, as well as their audiences, would place the new company in the global market. He also believed that both groups expertise in the management business would benefit the company too. Peter Phillipson, the chief executive of the Tussauds group added that the new group would be able to help the developments of Tussauds theme parks and attractions as well as increase the number of Madame Tussauds around the world.

On 17 July 2007, Madame Tussauds was sold to private investor Nick Leslau and his investment firm Prestbury under a sale and leaseback agreement. It is said that the company would be using the money from the sale for investment purposes and to pay off some outstanding debts. Although the attraction sites are owned by Prestbury, they continue to be operated by Merlin based on a renewable 35-year lease.

<text>Crowd simulation is the process of simulating the movement (or ) of a large number of entities or characters. It is commonly used to create virtual scenes for visual media like films and video games, and is also used in crisis training, architecture and urban planning, and evacuation simulation.

Crowd simulation may focus on aspects that target different applications. For realistic and fast rendering of a crowd for visual media or virtual cinematography, reduction of the complexity of the 3D scene and image-based rendering are used, while variations (changes) in appearance help present a realistic population.

In games and applications intended to replicate real-life human crowd movement, like in evacuation simulations, simulated agents may need to navigate towards a goal, avoid collisions, and exhibit other human-like behavior. Many crowd steering algorithms have been developed to lead simulated crowds to their goals realistically. Some more general systems are researched that can support different kinds of agents (like cars and pedestrians), different levels of abstraction (like individual and continuum), agents interacting with smart objects, and more complex physical and social dynamics.

== History ==
There has always been a deep-seated interest in the understanding and gaining control of motional and behavior of crowds of people. Many major advancements have taken place since the beginnings of research within the realm of crowd simulation. Evidently many new findings are continually made and published following these which enhance the scalability, flexibility, applicability, and realism of simulations:

In 1987, behavioral animation was introduced and developed by Craig Reynolds. He had simulated flocks of birds alongside schools of fish for the purpose of studying group intuition and movement. All agents within these simulations were given direct access to the respective positions and velocities of their surrounding agents. The theorization and study set forth by Reynolds was improved and built upon in 1994 by Xiaoyuan Tu, Demetri Terzopoulos and Radek Grzeszczuk. The realistic quality of simulation was engaged with as the individual agents were equipped with synthetic vision and a general view of the environment within which they resided, allowing for a perceptual awareness within their dynamic habitats.

Initial research in the field of crowd simulation began in 1997 with Daniel Thalmann&#x27;s supervision of Soraia Raupp Musse&#x27;s PhD thesis. They present a new model of crowd behavior in order to create a simulation of generic populations. Here a relation is drawn between the autonomous behavior of the individual within the crowd and the emergent behavior originating from this.

In 1999, individualistic navigation began its course within the realm of crowd simulation via continued research of Craig Reynolds. Steering behaviors are proven to play a large role in the process of automating agents within a simulation. Reynolds states the processes of low-level locomotion to be dependent and reliant on mid-level steering behaviors and higher-level goal states and path finding strategies. Building off of the advanced work of Reynolds, Musse and Thalmann began to study the modeling of real time simulations of these crowds, and their applications to human behavior. The control of human crowds was designated as a hierarchical organization with levels of autonomy amongst agents. This marks the beginnings of modeling individual behavior in its most elementary form on humanoid agents or virtual humans.

Coinciding with publications regarding human behavior models and simulations of group behaviors, Matt Anderson, Eric McDaniel, and Stephen Chenney&#x27;s proposal of constraints on behavior gained popularity. The positioning of constraints on group animations was presented to be able to be done at any time within the simulation. This process of applying constraints to the behavioral model is undergone in a two-fold manner, by first determining the initial set of goal trajectories coinciding with the constraints, and then applying behavioral rules to these paths to select those which do not violate them.

Correlating and building off of the findings proposed in his work with Musse, Thalmann, working alongside Bratislava Ulicny and Pablo de Heras Ciechomski, proposed a new model which allowed for interactive authoring of agents at the level of an individual, a group of agents and the entirety of a crowd. A brush metaphor is introduced to distribute, model and control crowd members in real-time with immediate feedback.

== Crowd dynamics ==
One of the major goals in crowd simulation is to steer crowds realistically and recreate human dynamic behaviors.

There exists several overarching approaches to crowd simulation and AI, each one providing advantages and disadvantages based on crowd size and time scale. Time scale refers to how the objective of the simulation also affects the length of the simulation. For example, researching social questions such as how ideologies are spread amongst a population will result in a much longer running simulation since such an event can span up to months or years. Using those two characteristics, researchers have attempted to apply classifications to better evaluate and organize existing crowd simulators.

;Flow-based Approach: Flow based crowd simulations focus on the crowd as a whole rather than its components. As such individuals do not have any distinctive behaviors that occur due to input from their surroundings and behavioral factors are largely reduced. This model is mainly used to estimate the flow of movement of a large and dense crowd in a given environment. Best used in studying large crowd, short time objectives.

;Entity-based Approach: Models that implement a set of physical, predefined, and global laws meant to simulate social/psychological factors that occur in individuals that are a part of a crowd fall under this category. Entities in this case do not have the capacity to, in a sense, think for themselves. All movements are determined by the global laws being enforced on them. Simulations that use this model often do so to research crowd dynamics such as jamming and flocking. Small to medium-sized crowds with short term objectives fit this approach best.

;Agent-based Approach: Characterized by autonomous, interacting individuals. Each agent of a crowd in this approach, is given a degree of intelligence; they can react to each situation on their own based on a set of decision rules. Information used to decide on an action is obtained locally from the agent&#x27;s&#x27; surroundings. Most often, this approach is used for simulating realistic crowd behavior as the researcher is given complete freedom to implement any behaviors.

== Particle systems ==
One way to simulate virtual crowds is to use a particle system. Particle systems were first introduced in computer graphics by W. T. Reeves in 1983. A particle system is a collection of a number of individual elements or &quot;particles&quot;. Each particle is able to act autonomously and is assigned a set of physical attributes (such as color, size and velocity).

A particle system is dynamic, in that the movements of the particles change over time. A particle system&#x27;s movement is what makes it so desirable and easy to implement. Calculating the movements of these particles takes very little time. It simply involves physics: the sum of all the forces acting on a particle determines its motion. Forces such as gravity, friction and force from a collision, and social forces like the attractive force of a goal.

Usually each particle has a velocity vector and a position vector, containing information about the particle&#x27;s current velocity and position respectively. The particles next position is calculated by adding its velocity vector to its position vector. A very simple operation (again why particle systems are so desirable). Its velocity vector changes over time, in response to the forces acting on the particle. For example, a collision with another particle will cause it to change direction.

Particles systems have been widely used in films for effects such as explosions, for water effects in the 2000 movie &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;, and simulated gas in the 1994 film &quot;the Mask&quot;.

Particles systems, however, do have some drawbacks. It can be a bad idea to use a particle system to simulate agents in a crowd that the director will move on command, as determining which particles belong to the agent and which do not is very difficult.

=== Algorithm by Patil and Van Den Berg ===
This algorithm was designed for relatively simplistic crowds, where each agent in the crowd only desires to get to its own goal destination while also avoiding obstacles. This algorithm could be used for simulating a crowd in Times Square.

Patils algorithm&#x27;s most important and distinctive feature is that it utilizes the concept of &quot;navigation fields&quot; for directing agents. This is different from a guidance field; a guidance field is an area around the agent in which the agent is capable of &quot;seeing&quot;/detecting information. Guidance fields are typically used for avoiding obstacles, dynamic obstacles (obstacles that move) in particular. Every agent possesses its own guidance field. A navigation field, on the other hand, is a vector field which calculates the minimum cost path for every agent so that every agent arrives at its own goal position.

The navigation field can only be used properly when a path exists from every free (non-obstacle) position in the environment to one of the goal positions. The navigation field is computed using coordinates of the static objects in the environment, goal positions for each agent, and the guidance field for each agent. In order to guarantee that every agent reaches its own goal the navigation field must be free of local minima, except for the presence of sinks at the specified goals.

the algorithm is only dependent on the grid resolution and not dependent on the number of agents in the environment. However, this algorithm has a high memory cost.

=== Individual behavior modelling ===
One set of techniques for AI-based crowd simulation is to model crowd behavior by advanced simulation of individual agent motivations and decision-making. Generally, this means each agent is assigned some set of variables that measure various traits or statuses such as stress, personality, or different goals. This results in more realistic crowd behavior though may be more computationally intensive than simpler techniques.

==== Personality-based models ====
One method of creating individualistic behavior for crowd agents is through the use of personality traits. Each agent may have certain aspects of their personality tuned based on a formula that associates aspects such as aggressiveness or impulsiveness with variables that govern the agents&#x27; behavior. One way this association can be found is through a subjective study in which agents are randomly assigned values for these variables and participants are asked to describe each agent in terms of these personality traits. A regression may then be done to determine a correlation between these traits and the agent variables. The personality traits can then be tuned and have an appropriate effect on agent behavior.

The OCEAN personality model has been used to define a mapping between personality traits and crowd simulation parameters. Automating crowd parameter tuning with personality traits provides easy authoring of scenarios with heterogeneous crowds.

==== Stress-based model ====
The behavior of crowds in high-stress situations can be modeled using General Adaptation Syndrome theory. Agent behavior is affected by various stressors from their environment categorized into four prototypes: time pressure, area pressure, positional stressors, and interpersonal stressors, each with associated mathematical models.

&quot;Time pressure&quot; refers to stressors related to a time limit in reaching a particular goal. An example would be a street crossing with a timed walk signal or boarding a train before the doors are closed.

&quot;Area pressure&quot; refers to stressors as a result of an environmental condition. Examples would be noise or heat in an area. The intensity of this stressor is constant over a particular area.

&quot;Positional stressors&quot; refer to stressors associated with a local source of stress. The intensity of this stressor increases as an agent approaches the source of the stress. An example would be a fire or a dynamic object such as an assailant. 
Examples of notable crowd AI simulation can be seen in New Line Cinema&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films, where AI armies of thousands of characters battle each other. This crowd simulation was done using Weta Digital&#x27;s Massive software.

=== Sociology ===
&quot;Crowd simulation&quot; can also refer to simulations based on group dynamics, crowd psychology, and even social etiquette. In this case, the focus is on the behavior of the crowd, not necessarily on the visual realism of the simulation. Crowds have been studied as a scientific interest since the end of the 19th century. A lot of research has focused on the collective social behavior of people at social gatherings, assemblies, protests, rebellions, concerts, sporting events and religious ceremonies. Gaining insight into natural human behavior under varying types of stressful situations will allow better models to be created which can be used to develop crowd controlling strategies, often in public safety planning.

&quot;Emergency response teams&quot; such as policemen, the National Guard, military and even volunteers must undergo some type of crowd control training. Using researched principles of human behavior in crowds can give disaster training designers more elements to incorporate to create realistic simulated disasters. Crowd behavior can be observed during both panic and non-panic conditions. Military programs are looking more towards simulated training involving emergency responses due to their cost-effective technology, as well as how effective the learning can be transferred to the real world. Many events that may start out controlled can have a twisting event that turns them into catastrophic situations, where decisions need to be made on the spot. It is these situations in which crowd dynamical understanding could play a vital role in reducing the potential for chaos.

&quot;Modeling&quot; techniques of crowds vary from holistic or network approaches to understanding individualistic or behavioral aspects of each agent. For example, the Social Force Model describes a need for individuals to find a balance between social interaction and physical interaction. An approach that incorporates both aspects, and is able to adapt depending on the situation, would better describe natural human behavior, always incorporating some measure of unpredictability. With the use of multi-agent models understanding these complex behaviors has become a much more comprehensible task. With the use of this type of software, systems can now be tested under extreme conditions, and simulate conditions over long periods of time in the matter of seconds.

In some situations, the behavior of swarms of non-human animals can be used as an experimental model of crowd behavior. The panic behavior of ants when exposed to a repellent chemical in a confined space with limited exit routes has been found to have both similarities and differences to equivalent human behavior.

=== Modeling individual behaviors ===

Hacohen, Shoval and Shvalb formulated the drivers-pedestrians dynamics at congested conflict spots. In such scenarios, the drivers and/or pedestrians do not closely follow the traffic laws. The model is based on the Probabilistic Navigation function (PNF), which was originally developed for robotics motion planning. The algorithm constructs a trajectory according to the probability for collision at each point in the entire crossing area. The pedestrian then follow a trajectory that locally minimizes their perceived probability for collision.

Helbing proposed a model based on physics using a particle system and socio-psychological forces in order to describe human crowd behavior in panic situation, this is now called the Helbing Model. His work is based on how the average person would react in a certain situation. Although this is a good model, there are always different types of people present in the crowd and they each have their own individual characteristics as well as how they act in a group structure. For instance, one person may not react to a panic situation, while another may stop walking and interfere in the crowd dynamics as a whole. Furthermore, depending on the group structure, the individual action can change because the agent is part of a group, for example, returning to a dangerous place in order to rescue a member of that group. Helbing&#x27;s model can be generalized incorporating individualism, as proposed by Braun, Musse, Oliveira and Bodmann.

In order to tackle this problem, individuality should be assigned to each agent, allowing to deal with different types of behaviors. Another aspect to tackle this problem is the possibility to group people, forming these group causes people to change their behavior as a function of part of the group structure. Each agent (individual) can be defined according to the following parameters:

# Id – Agent identifier
# IdFamily – Identifier of the family. A family is a predefined group formed by agents who know each other
# DE – Dependence level of the agent which mimics the need for help. Values [0,1]
# AL – Altruism level representing the tendency to help other agents. Values [0,1]
# vi – Speed of the agent

To model the effect of the dependence parameter with &quot;individual agents.&quot;

When evaluating the speed of the agent, it is clear that if the value of the dependence factor, DE, is equal to one, then the person would be fully disabled making him unable to move. If the dependence factor is equal to zero, then the person is able to run at his max speed.

Group formation is related to the Altruism force which is implemented as an interaction force between two or more agents who are part of the same family.

The places where this would be helpful would be in an evacuation scenario. Take for example, an evacuation of a building in the case of a fire. Taking into account the characteristics of individual agents and their group performances, determining the outcome of how the crowd would exit the building is critically important in creating the layout of the building.

=== Leader behavior during evacuation simulations ===
As described earlier, the Helbing Model is used as the basics for crowd behavior. This same type of behavior model is used for evacuation simulations.

In general, the first thing that has to be assumed is that not everyone has knowledge about the environment or where there are and aren&#x27;t hazards. From this assumption we can create three types of agents. The first type is a trained leader, this agent knows about the environment and is able to spread knowledge to other agents so they know how to exit from an environment. The next type of agent is an untrained leader, this agent does not know about the environment, however, as the agent explores the environment and gets information from other types of leaders, the agent is able to spread the knowledge about the environment. The last type of agent is a follower, this type of agent can only take information from other leaders and not be able to share the information with other agents.

The implementation of these types of agents is fairly straightforward. The leaders in the environment have a map of the environment saved as one of their attributes. An untrained leader and followers will start out with an empty map as their attribute. Untrained leaders and followers will start exploring an environment by themselves and create a map of walkable and unwalkable locations. Leaders and untrained leaders (once they have the knowledge), will share information with other agents depending on their proximity. They will share information about which points on the grid are blocked, the local sub-graphs and the dangers in the area.

There were two types of searching algorithms tried out for this implementation. There was the random search and the depth first search. A random search is where each of the agents go in any direction through the environment and try to find a pathway out. The depth first search is where agents follow one path as far as it can go then return and try another path if the path they traversed does not contain an exit. If was found that depth first search gave a speed up of 15 times versus a random search.

=== Scalable simulations ===
There are many different case situations that come into play in crowd simulations. Recently, crowd simulation has been essential for the many virtual environment applications such as education, training, and entertainment. Many situations are based on the environment of the simulation or the behavior of the group of local agents. In virtual reality applications, every agent interacts with many other agents in the environment, calling for complex real-time interactions. Agents must have continuous changes in the environment since agent behaviors allow complex interactions. Scalable architecture can manage large crowds through the behavior and interactive rates. These situations will indicate how the crowds will act in multiple complex scenarios while several different situations are being applied. A situation can be any circumstance that has typical local behaviors. We can categorize all situations into two different kinds.

&quot;Spatial situation&quot; is a situation that has a region where the environment affects the local agents. For instance, a crowd waiting in line for a ticket booth would be displaying a spatial situation. Other examples may be a bus stop or an ATM where characters act upon their environment. Therefore, we would consider &#x27;bus stop&#x27; as the situation if the behavior of the agents are to be getting on or off a bus.

&quot;Non-Spatial situation&quot; has no region in the environment because this only involves the behavior of the crowd. The relationship of the local agents is an important factor to consider when determining behavior. An example would be a group of friends walking together. Typical behavior of characters that are friends would all move along with each other. This means that &#x27;friendship&#x27; would be the situation among the typical behavior of walking together.

The structure of any situation is built upon four components, Behavior functions, Sensors, States, and Event Rules. Behavior functions represent what the characters behaviors are specific to the situation. Sensors are the sensing capability for agents to see and respond to events. States are the different motions and state transitions used only for the local behaviors. Event rule is the way to connect different events to their specific behaviors. While a character is being put into a situation, these four components are considered at the same time. For spatial situations, the components are added when the individual initially enters the environment that influences the character. For non-spatial situations, the character is affected only once the user assigns the situation to the character. The four components are removed when the agent is taken away from its situations region or the situation itself is removed. The dynamic adding and removing of the situations lets us achieve scalable agents.

== Human-like behaviors and crowd AI ==
To simulate more aspects of human activities in a crowd, more is needed than path and motion planning. Complex social interactions, smart object manipulation, and hybrid models are challenges in this area. Simulated crowd behavior is inspired by the flow of real-world crowds. Behavioral patterns, movement speeds and densities, and anomalies are analyzed across many environments and building types. Individuals are tracked and their movements are documented such that algorithms can be derived and implemented into crowd simulations.

Individual entities in a crowd are also called agents. In order for a crowd to behave realistically each agent should act autonomously (be capable of acting independently of the other agents). This idea is referred to as an &quot;agent-based model.&quot; Moreover, it is usually desired that the agents act with some degree of intelligence (i.e. the agents should not perform actions that would cause them to harm themselves). For agents to make intelligent and realistic decisions, they should act in accordance with their surrounding environment, react to its changes, and react to the other agents. Terzopoulos and his students have pioneered agent-based models of pedestrians, an approach referred to as multi-human simulation to distinguish it from conventional crowd simulation.

=== Rule-based AI ===

In rule-based AI, virtual agents follow scripts: &quot;if this happens, do that&quot;. This is a good approach to take if agents with different roles are required, such as a main character and several background characters. This type of AI is usually implemented with a hierarchy, such as in Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs, where the lower the need lies in the hierarchy, the stronger it is.

For example, consider a student walking to class who encounters an explosion and runs away. The theory behind this is initially the first four levels of his needs are met, and the student is acting according to his need for self-actualization. When the explosion happens his safety is threatened which is a much stronger need, causing him to act according to that need.

This approach is scalable, and can be applied to crowds with a large number of agents. Rule-based AI, however, does have some drawbacks. Most notably the behavior of the agents can become very predictable, which may cause a crowd to behave unrealistically.

=== Learning AI ===
In learning AI, virtual characters behave in ways that have been tested to help them achieve their goals. Agents experiment with their environment or a sample environment which is similar to their real one.

Agents perform a variety of actions and learn from their mistakes. Each agent alters its behavior in response to rewards and punishments it receives from the environment. Over time, each agent would develop behaviors that are consistently more likely to earn high rewards.

If this approach is used, along with a large number of possible behaviors and a complex environment agents will act in a realistic and unpredictable fashion.

==== Algorithms ====
There are a wide variety of machine learning algorithms that can be applied to crowd simulations.

Q-Learning is an algorithm residing under machine learning&#x27;s sub field known as reinforcement learning. A basic overview of the algorithm is that each action is assigned a Q value and each agent is given the directive to always perform the action with the highest Q value. In this case learning applies to the way in which Q values are assigned, which is entirely reward based. When an agent comes in contact with a state, s, and action, a, the algorithm then estimates the total reward value that an agent would receive for performing that state action pair. After calculating this data, it is then stored in the agent&#x27;s knowledge and the agent proceeds to act from there.

The agent will constantly alter its behavior depending on the best Q value available to it. And as it explores more and more of the environment, it will eventually learn the most optimal state action pairs to perform in almost every situation.

The following function outlines the bulk of the algorithm:

:&quot;Q(s, a) ←− r + maxaQ(s&#x27;, a&#x27;)&quot;

Given a state s and action a, r and s are the reward and state after performing (s,a), and a&#x27; is the range over all the actions.

== Crowd rendering and animation ==
Rendering and animating a large number of agents realistically, especially in real time, is challenging. To reduce the complexity of 3D rendering of large-scale crowds, techniques like culling (discarding unimportant objects), impostors (image-based rendering) and decreasing levels of detail have been used.
Variations in appearance, body shape and size, accessories and behavior (social or cultural) exist in real crowds, and lack of variety affects the realism of visual simulations. Existing systems can create virtual crowds with varying texture, color, size, shape and animation.

== Real world applications ==

=== Virtual cinematography ===
Crowd simulations have been used widely across films as a cost-effective and realistic alternative from hiring actors and capturing shots that would otherwise be unrealistic. A significant example of its use lies in The Lord of the Rings (film series). One of the most glaring problems for the production team in the initial stages were large-scale battles, as the author of the novels, J. R. R. Tolkien, envisioned them to have at least 50,000 participants. Such a number was unrealistic had they decided to only attempt to hire real actors and actresses. Instead they decided to use CG to simulate these scenes through the use of the Multiple Agent Simulation System in a Virtual Environment, otherwise known as MASSIVE. The Human Logic Engine based Maya plugin for crowd simulation, Miarmy, was used for the development of these sequences. The software allowed the filmmakers to provide each character model an agent based A.I. that could utilize a library of 350 animations. Based on sight, hearing, and touch parameters generated from the simulation, agents would react uniquely to each situation. Thus each simulation of the scene was unpredictable. The final product clearly displayed the advantages to using crowd simulation software.

=== Urban planning ===
The development of crowd simulation software has become a modern and useful tool in designing urban environments. Whereas the traditional method of urban planning relies on maps and abstract sketches, a digital simulation is more capable of conveying both form and intent of design from architect to pedestrian. For example, street signs and traffic lights are localized visual cues that influence pedestrians to move and behave accordingly. Following this logic, a person is able to move from point A to point B in a way that is efficient and that a collective group of people can operate more effectively as a result. In a broader sense, bus systems and roadside restaurants serve a spatial purpose in their locations through an understanding of human movement patterns. The SimCity video game series exemplifies this concept in a more simplistic manner. In this series, the player assigns city development in designated zones while maintaining a healthy budget. The progression from empty land to a bustling city is fully controlled by the player&#x27;s choices and the digital citizens behave as according to the city&#x27;s design and events.

=== Evacuation and riot handling ===
Simulated realistic crowds can be used in training for riots handling, architecture, safety science (evacuation planning).

=== Military ===
Being that crowd simulations are so prevalent in use for public planning and general order with regards to chaotic situations, many applications can be drawn for governmental and military simulations. Crowd modeling is essential in police and military simulation in order to train officers and soldiers to deal with mass gatherings of people. Not only do offensive combatants prove to be difficult for these individuals to handle, but noncombatant crowds play significant roles in making these aggressive situations more out of control. Game technology is used in order to simulate these situations for soldiers and technicians to practice their skills.

=== Sociology ===
The behavior of a modeled crowd plays a prominent role in analytical matters. These dynamics rely on the physical behaviors of individual agents within a crowd rather than the visual reality of the model itself. The social behaviors of people within these constructs have been of interest for many years, and the sociological concepts which underpin these interactions are constantly studied. The simulation of crowds in different situations allows for sociological study of real life gatherings in a variety of arrangements and locations. The variations in human behavior in situations varying in stress-levels allows for the further development and creation of crowd control strategies which can be more specifically applied to situations rather than generalized.

<text>Breaker Morant is a 1980 Australian war drama film directed by Bruce Beresford, who co-wrote the screenplay based on Kenneth G. Ross&#x27;s 1978 play of the same name.

The film concerns the 1902 court martial of lieutenants Harry Morant, Peter Handcock and George Witton—one of the first war crime prosecutions in British military history. Australians serving in the British Army during the Second Anglo-Boer War, Morant, Handcock, and Witton stood accused of murdering captured enemy combatants and an unarmed civilian in the Northern Transvaal. The film is notable for its exploration of the Nuremberg Defence, the politics of the death penalty and the human cost of total war. As the trial unfolds, the events in question are shown in flashbacks.

In 1980, the film won ten Australian Film Institute Awards including: Best Film, Best Direction, Leading Actor, Supporting Actor, Screenplay, Art Direction, Cinematography, and Editing. It was also nominated for the 1980 Academy Award for the Best Writing (Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium).

&quot;Breaker Morant&quot; remains the movie with which Beresford is most identified and has &quot;hoisted the images of the accused officers to the level of Australian icons and martyrs&quot;. In a 1999 interview Beresford explained that &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; &quot;never pretended for a moment&quot; that the defendants were not guilty as charged. He had intended the film to explore how wartime atrocities can be &quot;committed by people who appear to be quite normal&quot;. Beresford concluded that he was &quot;amazed&quot; that so many people see his film as being about &quot;poor Australians who were framed by the Brits&quot;.

==Plot==
&quot;Breaker Morant&quot; concerns the murder trial of three Australian soldiers, officers of the elite Bushveldt Carbineers, in South Africa. Harry &quot;Breaker&quot; Morant, Peter Handcock and George Witton are accused of the murder of one Boer prisoner, the subsequent murders of six more; Morant and Handcock are accused of the sniper-style death of a German missionary, the Rev. Hesse. Their counsel, Major Thomas, has had only one day to prepare their defense.

Lord Kitchener, who ordered the trial, hopes to bring the Boer War to an end with a peace conference. To that end, he uses the Morant trial to show that he is willing to judge his own soldiers harshly if they disobey the rules of war. Though there are great complexities associated with charging active-duty soldiers with murder, Kitchener is determined to have a guilty verdict, and the chief of the court supports him.

The causes and occurrences relating to the trial are developed. Morant&#x27;s execution of the Boer prisoners was revenge for the mutilation and death of his friend and commanding officer, Captain Hunt. Angered by the incident, Morant led an attack on a Boer camp, where a Boer wearing Hunt&#x27;s khaki jacket was captured. Morant had him executed.

The killing of six prisoners was in much the same fashion. Morant later justifies their deaths, saying, &quot;You know the orders from Whitehall. If they show a white flag, we don&#x27;t see it. I didn&#x27;t see it.&quot; Before their execution, Morant notices Hesse speaking with the prisoners. Morant, furious, is convinced that Hesse is a spy, though he has no proof. A conversation with Handcock leads to the latter taking a rifle and horse and following Hesse, who is found shot the next morning.

During the trial, the court&#x27;s bias toward a guilty verdict becomes apparent, as well as the political machinations behind it. The focus is on whether or not orders were issued by Kitchener to shoot all Boer prisoners; Thomas&#x27; case is that there were standing, though unwritten, orders to do so. Since these were verbally relayed to Hunt, and by Hunt to Morant, there is no way to prove that the orders existed.

Ironically, it transpires that while Morant acted under orders by shooting the prisoners, he and Handcock were in fact responsible for the murder of Hesse. Handcock, who took care to set up an alibi with two &quot;ladyfriends,&quot; admits to Witton that he actually followed Hesse and shot him. However, the court acquits them of the murder of Hesse but finds them guilty of the other two charges.

Kitchener is conveniently absent and therefore unavailable for pleas for a reprieve, though he does commute Witton&#x27;s sentence to life imprisonment before leaving. Morant and Handcock are shot in the morning as Witton is taken to the prison transport. As a final insult Handcock&#x27;s coffin is built too small for his tall frame, and the soldiers are forced to clumsily cram his body in.

A summary at the end of the movie reveals what happens to some of the characters. Thomas returns to his native Australia and continues his law practice, which is otherwise confined to estate planning and wills. Witton serves three years of his sentence, but is released after a national outcry and writes a book entitled &quot;Scapegoats of the Empire&quot;, an account of the Morant affair. This proves so inflammatory and anti-British that it is suppressed during the World Wars.

==Cast==
==Production==
Funding came from the SAFC, the Australian Film Commission, the Seven Network and PACT Productions. The distributors, Roadshow, insisted that Jack Thompson be given a role. The movie was the second of two films Beresford intended to make for the South Australian Film Corporation. He wanted to make &quot;Breakout&quot;, about the Cowra Breakout but could not find a script with which he was satisfied, so he turned to the story of Breaker Morant.

==Historical accuracy==
===Alleged German pressure===
In conversation with Bolton, Lord Kitchener states that Kaiser Wilhelm II has formally protested about the murder of Hesse, whom he describes as a German citizen. He says that the German people support the Boer cause, that their government covets the gold and diamond mines of the Boer Republics, and that the British Government fears German entry into the war. This, Kitchener explains, is why Morant, Handcock, and Witton must be convicted at all costs.

According to the South African historian Charles Leach, the legend that the German Foreign Office protested about the murder of Hesse &quot;cannot be proved through official channels&quot;. &quot;No personal or direct communication&quot; between the Kaiser and his uncle, King Edward VII, &quot;has been found despite widespread legend that this was definitely the case&quot;. Questions raised in the House of Commons on 8 April 1902 were answered by an insistence that the War Office, the Foreign Office, or Lord Kitchener had not received &quot;any such communication on this subject&quot; &quot;on behalf of the German government&quot;.

Under international law, the German government had no grounds to protest. Despite being attached to the Berlin Missionary Society, Hesse had been born in Cape Colony and &quot;was, technically speaking, a British subject, and not a German citizen&quot;. Yet, the scene contains a kernel of truth. Leach writes, &quot;Several eminent South African historians, local enthusiasts, and commentators share the opinion that had it not been for the murder of Hesse, none of the other Bushveldt Carbineers would have been brought to trial&quot;.

===Three defendants===
Although only Morant, Handcock, and Witton are shown as being on trial, there were three other defendants:
* Lieutenant Henry Picton, a British-born Australian officer of the Bushveldt Carbineers, was charged along with Morant, Handcock, and Witton of &quot;committing the offense of murder&quot; for delivering a &quot;coup de grâce&quot; after the execution of the wounded prisoner Floris Visser. Picton was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to be cashiered from the British Armed Forces.
* Captain Alfred James Taylor, the Anglo-Irish commander of military intelligence at Fort Edward, stood accused of the murder of six unarmed Afrikaner men and boys, the theft of their money and livestock, and the subsequent murder of a Bushveldt Carbineers Trooper. He was acquitted.
* Major Robert Lenehan, the Australian Field Commander of the Bushveldt Carbineers, who stood accused of concealing the murder of a Bushveldt Carbineers Trooper who had disapproved of shooting prisoners. The official charge was &quot;When on active service by culpable neglect failing to make a report which it was duty to make&quot;. Lenehan was found guilty and sentenced to a reprimand.

===Role of other ranks and Colonel Hall===
The soldiers from the Fort Edward garrison who testify against Morant, Handcock and Witton are depicted as motivated by grudges against their former officers. A prime example is Corporal Sharp, who expresses a willingness to walk across South Africa to serve in the defendants&#x27; firing squad. Other prosecution witnesses have been thrown out of the Bushveldt Carbineers by the defendants for looting, drunkenness and other offences. All are portrayed with British accents.

Hall, the officer commanding at Pietersburg, is depicted as fully aware and even complicit in the total war tactics of the Fort Edward garrison. He is also described as having been sent to India to prevent him from giving testimony favourable to the defence. Surviving documents tell that the arrest of the six defendants was &quot;ordered&quot; by Hall after a letter from the other ranks at Fort Edward. The letter, dated 4 October 1901, was written by BVC Trooper Robert Mitchell Cochrane, a former justice of the peace from Western Australia and signed by 15 members of the Fort Edward garrison.

After listing numerous murders and attempted murders of unarmed Boer prisoners, local civilians and BVC personnel who disapproved, the letter concluded, &quot;Sir, many of us are Australians who have fought throughout nearly the whole war while others are Afrikaners who have fought from Colenso till now. We cannot return home with the stigma of these crimes attached to our names. Therefore we humbly pray that a full and exhaustive inquiry be made by Imperial officers in order that the truth be elicited and justice done. Also we beg that all witnesses may be kept in camp at Pietersburg till the inquiry is finished. So deeply do we deplore the opprobrium which must be inseparably attached to these crimes that scarcely a man once his time is up can be prevailed to re-enlist in this corps. Trusting for the credit of thinking you will grant the inquiry we seek&quot;.

===Arrest at Fort Edward===
During his conversation with Handcock and Witton in the prison courtyard, Morant alleges that the British Army has marked them for death &quot;ever since they arrested us at Fort Edward&quot; but their arrests took place elsewhere. After the letter Hall summoned all Fort Edward officers and non-commissioned officers to Pietersburg on 21 October 1901. All were met by a party of mounted infantry five miles outside Pietersburg on the morning of 23 October 1901 and &quot;brought into town like criminals&quot;. Morant was arrested after returning from leave in Pretoria, where he had gone to settle the affairs of his deceased friend Captain Hunt.

===Rejection of deals for leniency===
In the film, the British military is determined to kill the defendants. According to the Australian historians Margaret Carnegie and Frank Shields, Morant and Handcock rejected an offer of immunity from prosecution in return for turning king&#x27;s evidence. Military prosecutors allegedly hoped to use them as witnesses against BVC Major Robert Lenehan, who was believed to have issued orders to take no prisoners. Towards the end of the film, Taylor informs Morant that the British Army will never dare to prosecute him, as he really can implicate Kitchener in war crimes. According to the South African historian Andries Pretorius, the trial of Alfred Taylor was almost certainly saved for the last because &quot;The prosecution must have been hoping&quot;, in vain for the accused officers, &quot;to implicate Taylor&quot;. Their refusal to do so seems to have ensured that Taylor was not convicted at his trial.

===Captain Hunt===
In the film, Hunt is inaccurately depicted as having an Australian accent. According to the South African historian Charles Leach, Captain Hunt &quot;was an Englishman, a former Lieutenant in Kitchener&#x27;s Fighting Scouts, and a fine horseman&quot;. A surviving photograph of Hunt also reveals that he was far younger than the actor who plays him on screen.

=== Witton&#x27;s death date ===
The movie states that Witton died in 1943. In reality, he died of complications after suffering a heart attack on 14 August 1942.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
Rotten Tomatoes gave &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; a 100% approval rating, based on 23 reviews, with an average score of 8.39/10.

The film also stirred debate on the legacy of the trial with its pacifist theme. D. L. Kershen wrote &quot;&quot;Breaker Morant&quot; tells the story of the court martial of Harry Morant, Peter Handcock, and George Witton in South Africa in 1902. Yet, its overriding theme is that &quot;war is evil&quot;. &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; is a beautiful antiwar statement – a plea for the end of the intrigues and crimes that war entails&quot;.

<text>The Dead Zone, also known as Stephen King&#x27;s The Dead Zone (in the USA) is a science fiction drama television series starring Anthony Michael Hall as Johnny Smith, who discovers he has developed psychic abilities after a coma. The show, credited as &quot;based on characters&quot; from Stephen King&#x27;s 1979 novel of the same name, first aired in 2002, and was produced by Lionsgate Television and Paramount Network Television (later CBS Paramount Network Television) for the USA Network.

The show was originally commissioned for UPN, but the network dropped the show and it was picked up by USA. The series was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada for its first five seasons. The sixth and last season was billed as &quot;The season that changes everything&quot; and production was moved to Montreal.

&quot;The Dead Zone&quot; was expected to be renewed for a seventh season, but due to financial concerns and fear of low ratings on the part of the producers, the series was cancelled on a major cliffhanger in December 2007 without a series finale. Syfy was rumored to possibly pick up the series after it was cancelled by USA, but it did not occur.

==Plot==

Small-town teacher Johnny Smith is involved in a car accident that leaves him comatose for about six years. After regaining consciousness, Johnny begins having visions of the past and future triggered by touching items or people; doctors attribute the visions to activity in a previously unused &quot;dead zone&quot; of his brain that is attempting to compensate for the impaired function of the portions injured in the accident. Johnny also learns that his fiancée, Sarah, gave birth to his son in the interim following the accident, but has since married another man.

With the help of Sarah, her husband (and town sheriff) Walt Bannerman, and physical therapist Bruce, Johnny begins using his abilities to help solve crimes. His attempts to do good, though, are complicated by intermittent visions of apocalyptic events brought about following the future election of congressional candidate Greg Stillson.

===Characters===
* Johnny Smith (played by Anthony Michael Hall) is a retired schoolteacher who, as a result of a car accident, has developed psychic abilities. An encounter with a carnival trickster in the first episode (before the car accident) makes it clear Johnny already has some psychic abilities, but after the coma, their nature changes from &quot;intuition&quot; to &quot;visions&quot;, the latter requiring urgent action, even when personally inconvenient, whereas earlier, Johnny only uses his ability on a carnival trickster to amuse his fiancée Sarah. Whenever he undergoes one of his visions in his eye, Johnny has shown to be capable of manipulating the time localized around the vision, allowing him to stop, slow, reverse, or forward the time relative to himself within the vision, leaving him as the only one aware of his temporal alterations within it, thus allowing him to further examine the details from the past, future, and occasionally the present.
* Sarah Bracknell Bannerman (played by Nicole de Boer) is Johnny&#x27;s former fiancée and the mother of his son, J.J. Sarah married Walt Bannerman during Johnny&#x27;s coma, and the two are raising J.J. together. Sarah knew Johnny when they were children, and later taught at the same school as he did. Sarah&#x27;s mother died when she was a teenager, which strained her relationship with her father. At the end of season 5, Sarah was pregnant with Walt&#x27;s child. At the beginning of season 6, she gives birth to Walt&#x27;s daughter and names her &quot;Hope&quot;.
* Sheriff Walt Bannerman (played by Chris Bruno) initially has very rocky relationship with Johnny, who often feels that Walt stole Sarah from him. Since then, as Johnny displays his powers more and more often in law enforcement situations, Johnny becomes an asset to Walt, and the two become friends. The name Walt Bannerman is a combination of the names George Bannerman and Walt Hazlett; in the novel, George Bannerman was the sheriff, and Walt Hazlett was the man Sarah married. At the beginning of season 6, Walt is killed in a fire at the Faith Heritage Chapel, but he continued to pop up throughout the season in visions and flashbacks, and even briefly as a ghost.
* Bruce Lewis (played by John L. Adams) is a physiotherapist who helps Johnny regain his strength after his coma. Bruce is an open-minded spiritual person as a result of a religious upbringing by his pastor father. He is Johnny&#x27;s best friend and frequently his voice of reason, and may very well be the reason for the divergence in this series when compared to the novel or 1983 movie (Johnny never tried to kill Greg Stillson before the election). An episode in season 2 even featured a vision of an alternate reality where instead of being a physical therapist, Bruce was a reverend who never met Johnny after waking up from his coma. Thus, with the absence of his guidance, this version of Johnny became unstable, deranged, and driven mad by his abilities.
* Rev. Gene Purdy (played by David Ogden Stiers), another original character in the series, is a religious leader and head of a prestigious university and foundations funded by Vera Smith, Johnny&#x27;s mother. Johnny always speculated that Purdy&#x27;s interest in Vera was for financial gain, but his powers allowed him to discover that Purdy had been in love with Vera for more than 35 years. Upon Vera&#x27;s suicide over the grief of the loss of her son, Purdy covered up the incident and made everyone believe she died of a heart attack, thus preserving her dignity in the public eye. Purdy has long been involved with somewhat shady dealings, but is always in the constant service of God. His devotion sometimes clouds his judgment, and he has even gone as far as to cover up a murder to protect better interests. At the end of the season-six premiere &quot;Heritage&quot;, Purdy leaves Cleaves Mills after being involved in a fire that killed Walt Bannerman and Malcolm Janus at the Faith Heritage Chapel.
* Dana Bright (played by Kristen Dalton) is a journalist for the &quot;Bangor Daily News&quot;. Dana covered much of Johnny&#x27;s early work, and later became romantically linked with him; she was also in a relationship with Gene Purdy. She left the show for some time, and her absence was not explained until the season 5 episode &quot;Articles of Faith&quot;. Because of her coverage of Johnny, Dana was able to move on up to reporting for a Boston television station, choosing her career ambitions above her increasingly complex relationship with Johnny. At the end of that episode when she leaves, both are shown to harbor, to some degree, feelings for each other.
* Greg Stillson (played by Sean Patrick Flanery) is a mentally unstable politician who has taken many illegal steps to secure an election. Upon meeting with Johnny Smith, Stillson clearly would become responsible for an apocalyptic event that Johnny has seen in his visions and is trying to prevent. After the death of Malcolm Janus (see below), Johnny&#x27;s visions of a Stillson-created apocalypse ceased, but after some further revelations, they returned at the end of the season.
* Deputy Roscoe (played by Bill Mondy) is a deputy who works for Walt. Roscoe is usually first on the scene and very dependable.
* Johnny &quot;J.J.&quot; Bannerman (played by Spencer Achtymichuk (seasons 1–5) and Connor Price (season 6)) is the biological son of Johnny and Sarah. Sarah was pregnant when Johnny had his accident, and she ultimately married Walt, who raised J.J. as his own son. As of the third season, Walt and Sarah have told J.J. that Johnny is his biological father, and Johnny has taken on more fatherly duties. In the season-six episode &quot;Big Top&quot;, Johnny starts to believe that J.J. has inherited his powers, but J.J. appears to be covering up his innate abilities. In the series finale, J.J. has his first actual vision when he sees Armageddon in the pupil of his eye sharing it within Johnny&#x27;s eye during a scuffle with Greg Stillson.
* Malcolm Janus (played by Martin Donovan) is a power broker who believes that Greg Stillson is &quot;destined for great things&quot;. His ultimate goal is to place Stillson in the White House. He also gave Reverend Purdy a global sphere of influence, in return for financial support of Stillson&#x27;s campaigns. Janus is apparently a member of the Illuminati, as he wears a ring with their symbol. At the beginning of season-six episode &quot;Heritage&quot;, Janus is killed in self-defense by Purdy at the Faith Heritage Chapel.
* Christopher Wey (played by Frank Whaley)is a man from the future who has been comatose since 2003. He wakes after the apocalypse to discover that he has a &quot;dead zone&quot; similar to Johnny&#x27;s, and that he can communicate with the present-day Johnny when both are in contact with the head of his cane. Wey is revealed to be in league with a future Johnny Smith and J.J.
* Rebecca Caldwell (played by Sarah Wynter) is child psychiatrist who met Johnny during his investigation of the murder of her sister Rachel. Rebecca became Johnny&#x27;s girlfriend, and at one time, found out that Greg Stillson may have been responsible for her sister&#x27;s murder and will be responsible for the upcoming apocalypse. As of the third-season finale, she has purchased a gun in an attempt to assassinate Stillson. Rebecca was stopped by Johnny and discovered that Stillson did not kill Rachel. She left Johnny, seeking to sort things out for herself.
* Alex Sinclair (played by Jennifer Finnigan) is a female psychic who discovered her &quot;dead zone&quot; when she was stung by a swarm of bees (presumably &quot;killer bees&quot;) as a child and became hyperallergic to bee stings and products. Alex first appears in the fourth-season episode &quot;Double Vision&quot;, where Johnny and she track down a sniper together. At the end of the episode, Johnny and she clearly have developed feelings for each other, but she decides that she is not ready to pursue the relationship. Alex does later appear in the fourth-season Christmas episode &quot;A Very Dead Zone Christmas&quot;, where the idea of Johnny and her getting together is further explored.
* Anna Turner (played by Cara Buono) is the sheriff &quot;pro tem&quot; of Penobscot County; Anna investigated the final unofficial case of the recently deceased Sheriff Walt Bannerman.

==Music==
* In the pilot episode, the music class practices the song &quot;Mr. Sandman.&quot; In the same episode, Johnny and Sarah make out in his car to &quot;Sleep Walk&quot;, a song by Santo &amp; Johnny, which also featured in the Stephen King movie &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot;.
* The theme song from seasons 1-3 is &quot;New Year&#x27;s Prayer&quot; by Jeff Buckley.
* The new theme song since season 4 is &quot;Dead Zone Epic&quot; by Blues Saraceno.
* The promos for season 4 featured the song &quot;Brace Yourself&quot; by Howie Day.
* The promos for season 5 featured the song &quot;By My Side&quot; by INXS.
* The promos for season 6 featured the song &quot;Touch Me&quot; by The Doors.

<doc id="886895" wikidata="Q6966232" url="?curid=886895" title="Narrativity">
<text>Narrativity is the extent to which a media tells a story, which is a storyteller&#x27;s account of an event or a sequence of events leading to a transition from an initial state to a later state or outcome. There are four theoretical foundations of narrativity, represented by the notions of 
# narrative content,
# narrative discourse,
# narrative transportation, and
# narrative persuasion.
Narrative content and discourse are the linguistic antecedents of narrativity. Narrative content reflects the linear sequence of events as characters live through them—that is, the backbone and structure describing who did what, where, when, and why. Narrative discourse represents how the story is told—that is, storytellers&#x27; use of literary devices to expand on the narrative content, such as emotional change over the course of the story line and sequencing of events to create drama. Narrative transportation is the engrossing, transformational experience of being swept away by a story. Narrative persuasion is the effect of narrative transportation, which manifests itself in story receivers&#x27; positive attitudes toward the story, story-consistent attitudes toward the experience described therein, and story-consistent intentions. The higher the quality of narrative content and discourse in a text, the greater its narrativity and its real-world implications, such as narrative transportation and persuasion, as van Laer, Escalas, Ludwig, and van den Hende show.

== The theory of narrativity ==
The extent to which story receivers experience narrative transportation and are &quot;lost&quot; in the narrative world depends on the level of narrativity of a text. Narratologists distinguish two components of narrativity: content and discourse. The difference between narrative content and narrative discourse is the difference between what is conveyed and how it is conveyed. The features of narrative content align with the structural components of a story (i.e., characters and events). Literary devices, which grant storytellers the power to frame the narrative, are associated with narrative discourse. Variations in these narrative elements affect transportation into the narrative and subsequent persuasion, as the theory of narrativity proposes.

<doc id="886904" wikidata="Q11309086" url="?curid=886904" title="Jake Daubert">
<text>Jacob Ellsworth Daubert (April 7, 1884 – October 9, 1924) was an American first baseman in Major League Baseball who played for the Brooklyn Superbas and Cincinnati Reds. His career lasted from 1910 until his death in 1924.

Daubert was recognized throughout his career for his performance on the field. He won the 1913 and 1914 National League batting titles and the 1913 Chalmers Award as the National League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. Between 1911 and 1919, &quot;The Baseball Magazine&quot; named him to their All-American team seven times. Baseball historian William C. Kashatus observed that Daubert was &quot;a steady .300 hitter for 10 years of the Deadball Era&quot; who &quot;never fielded below the .989 mark.&quot;

==Early life==
Daubert was born in Shamokin, Pennsylvania to Jacob and Sarah Daubert. The lack of child labor laws enabled Daubert to go to work early in his life. In 1895, at the age of eleven, the young Daubert joined his father and two brothers at work in the local coal mines.

In 1906, Daubert left his job at the mines and signed a contract with a baseball team in Lykens, Pennsylvania. He was originally a pitcher on the team before he converted to first base. At the end of the 1906 season, Daubert left Pennsylvania and traveled west to Ohio. There, he spent the 1907 season on teams in Kane, Pennsylvania and Marion, Ohio.

==Baseball career==

In 1908, Daubert was signed by the Cleveland Indians. However, Daubert never played for Cleveland as they released him shortly thereafter. He left Cleveland and signed with the Nashville club of the Southern Association. He spent the remainder of the season with Nashville.

Daubert returned to Ohio for the start of the 1909 season. After playing the first part of the season with Toledo of the American Association, Daubert went back to Tennessee and joined the Memphis club. Like Nashville, Memphis&#x27;s team played in the Southern Association. While playing for Memphis, Larry Sutton, a scout for the Brooklyn Dodgers, observed his play. Shortly thereafter, the Dodgers purchased Daubert&#x27;s contract and brought him to Brooklyn for the 1910 season.

While Daubert hit just .264 in 1910, he hit over .300 in each of the next six seasons. On May 6, 1910, Daubert recorded 21 putouts in a single game, one short of the major league record.

In 1911 and 1912, Daubert placed ninth and eighth in the Chalmers Award voting. The following year, he won the award. On August 15, 1914, Daubert tied Cy Seymour&#x27;s MLB record with four sacrifice bunts in one game. In 1916 he batted .316 and Brooklyn won their first NL pennant. His season ended in disappointment, however, after he hit only .176 in the 1916 World Series and Brooklyn lost the series to the Boston Red Sox.

Daubert hit .261 in 1917, but the following year he hit .308 and led the NL in triples. When the season was cut short due to World War I and the Spanish flu epidemic, major league owners prorated player salaries. Daubert, who had been among the founding members of the Players&#x27; Fraternity, sued for the balance of his salary. Eventually, Jake recovered most of the $2,150 he was due. After the dispute started, Brooklyn owner Charles Ebbets traded him to Cincinnati for outfielder Tommy Griffith. Once in Cincinnati, Daubert served as the Reds&#x27; captain for the remainder of his career.

In 1919, although he hit only .276, Daubert was second in the league in runs scored and third in triples. The Reds won their first pennant since the inaugural season of the American Association in 1882. In the 1919 World Series, noted for the Black Sox Scandal, he batted .241. In the 9-1 Game One victory, he had three hits, including a triple, and he had two hits and scored twice in the final 10-5 victory in the decisive Game Eight.

Daubert hit over .300 in the next three seasons. In 1922, Daubert hit for a .336 average, led the NL in triples and had a career-high 12 home runs. By 1923, at age 39, he was the oldest regular position player in the major leagues, and he hit .292 that season.

Daubert also excelled in sacrifice hits. His career total of 392 sacrifice hits is second in MLB history, behind Hall of Famer Eddie Collins.

In his career, he had 56 home runs, 1,117 runs, 722 runs batted in, 250 doubles, 165 triples and 251 stolen bases. He recorded a .991 fielding percentage playing every inning of his MLB career at first base. When he left Brooklyn for Cincinnati, Daubert held the Brooklyn franchise record for games played at first base (1,206). The record was broken by Gil Hodges in 1956.

==Baseball unionization efforts==
Daubert was a trailblazer in baseball&#x27;s unionization movement, a controversial role that may have been a factor in his omission from the Hall of Fame. In 1913, he served as vice president of the Baseball Players&#x27; Fraternity, which petitioned the National Baseball Commission for improved labor conditions. The petition included the following requests: 1) permission for players to negotiate with any team following their unconditional release, 2) a guarantee that clubs would provide players with 10 days&#x27; notice before releasing them unconditionally, 3) a guarantee that clubs would inform players of the terms of their contract when they are sent to another team, 4) a guarantee that a veteran players would not be sent to the minor leagues when his services are of interest to another major league club, 5) a guarantee that clubs would furnish uniforms and shoes to players free of charge, 6) a guarantee that clubs would provide traveling expenses to players between their homes and spring training camps, and 7) that players should receive written notice concerning any fine or suspension levied against them.

Although Daubert was unsuccessful in pressuring the commissioners to accept the terms of the fledgling baseball union&#x27;s petition, he lobbied continuously for his own interests as a player, thereby earning a reputation as a &quot;troublemaker&quot; within the baseball establishment. A salary dispute with Charles Ebbets, owner of the Dodgers, was a major factor in Daubert&#x27;s transfer to Cincinnati in 1919.

==Life outside baseball and death==
While Daubert was in Brooklyn, he was nominated for city Alderman. He also spent time as a businessman and invested in several business ventures. His holdings included a pool hall, a cigar business, a semi-pro baseball team, a moving-picture business and a coal breaker. His most profitable business was reportedly the coal breaker, which was located in his hometown.

Daubert left the Reds late in the 1924 season after falling ill during a road trip to New York. Against his doctor&#x27;s advice, he returned to play in the team&#x27;s final home game of the season. On October 2, he had an appendectomy performed by Dr. Harry H. Hines, the Reds&#x27; team doctor. Complications from the operation arose, and a blood transfusion did not improve his health. He died in Cincinnati one week after the operation, with the doctor citing &quot;exhaustion, resulting in indigestion, [as] the immediate cause of death&quot;. It was later discovered that Daubert suffered from a hereditary blood disorder called hemolytic spherocytosis, which contributed to his death. He was interred at the Charles Baber Cemetery in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Daubert was survived by his wife Gertrude, his son George, and his daughter Louisa. As of 2022, he remains the oldest ballplayer to die while in the majors.

During his career, Daubert compiled a .303 lifetime batting average. At the time of his death, he ranked among the major league career leaders in games (4th, 2,001), putouts (4th, 19,634), assists (5th, 1,128), total chances (4th, 20,943) and double plays (3rd, 1,199) at first base; he was also among the NL&#x27;s leaders in hits (7th, 2,326), triples (9th, 165), at bats (9th, 7,673), games played (10th, 2,014) and total bases (10th, 3,074). Daubert currently holds the NL record for most sacrifice hits (392). He was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1966 and the Brooklyn Dodgers Hall of Fame in 1990.

Dandurand, a Montreal lawyer, was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1898 by Sir Wilfrid Laurier. He served as Speaker of the Senate of Canada from 1905 to 1909 and was either Leader of the Government in the Canadian Senate or Leader of the Opposition in the Canadian Senate from 1921 until 1942. As Government Leader in the Senate he served in every Cabinet formed by William Lyon Mackenzie King from 1921 until Dandurand&#x27;s death in 1942.
He also served as President of the League of Nations Assembly in 1925 and was Canada&#x27;s delegate to the League&#x27;s council from 1927 to 1930. He is perhaps best remembered for having said, in 1927, that in international affairs Canada was “a fireproof house, far from inflammable materials.”

King relied heavily on Dandurand and Ernest Lapointe for advice on Quebec as well as on international affairs and it was Dandurand who suggested Louis St. Laurent for King&#x27;s Cabinet after Lapointe&#x27;s death.

After his death, he was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

==Family==
In January 1886, Dandurand married Joséphine Marchand, daughter of Quebec premier and dramatist Hon Félix-Gabriel Marchand and his wife, Marie Herselie Turgeon. Josephine was born in Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Iberville, and was educated at the Convent of Les Dames de la Congregation de Notre Dame a branch of Villa-Maria. Her literary works included dramatic pieces, papers and essays on subjects of public interest and in relation to women&#x27;s duties, rights and place. She founded and edited &quot;Le Coin du Feu&quot;, a women&#x27;s paper. They were parents to daughter Gabrielle-Marie-Melinda Dandurand (1886–1933).

She was a member and office-bearer of the National Council of Women of Canada, in which she advanced practical schemes for the promotion of the industrial and fine arts in Canada and the establishment of a Department of Art. She was a member and office-bearer of the Women&#x27;s Historical Society, the Victorian Order of Nurses. She was President of the Crèche of the Sisters of Mercy, Montreal, Quebec. In 1898, she was created an Officier Academic by the French government. In 1900, she was appointed as a Commissioner from the Canadian government of Canada to the Paris Exposition in Ottawa. In March 1903, she delivered an address before the Alliance française on &quot;La Sociabilite.&quot;

<text>Jim Munroe is a Canadian science fiction author, independent game developer, filmmaker, and cultural organizer. Munroe was managing editor at the magazine &quot;Adbusters&quot; in the 1990s, before publishing his debut novel &quot;Flyboy Action Figure Comes With Gasmask&quot; in 1999. The novel was put out by HarperCollins, a major publishing company owned by Rupert Murdoch, and though the book was successful, Munroe so disliked the experience that he launched No Media Kings as a venue for publishing and promoting his own works independently, and a guide to self-publishing for other prospective writers. The book was shortlisted for the Books in Canada First Novel Award in 2000.

In 2000, Munroe released &quot;Angry Young Spaceman&quot; through No Media Kings. He followed up with &quot;Everyone in Silico&quot; in 2002, which was promoted partly by Munroe&#x27;s attempt to invoice corporations mentioned in the novel for product placement. &quot;An Opening Act of Unspeakable Evil&quot;, a novel written in the form of blog entries, followed in 2004.

Munroe wrote the graphic novels &quot;Therefore Repent!&quot;, published in 2007, and &quot;Sword of My Mouth&quot;, published in 2010, both set in post-Rapture Chicago and Detroit. In 2022, he released &quot;We Are Raccoons&quot;, a science fiction novel about independent video game designers who accidentally create a superintelligence.

== Video games ==
Munroe wrote the game &quot;Unmanned&quot; (2012), which places the player in the role of a drone bomber pilot, which was featured in the Sundance Film Festival New Frontier section and which won the Grand Jury Award at IndieCade and two Games for Change awards. &quot;Guilded Youth&quot; (2012), one of his interactive fiction works, came in third place in the 2012 Interactive Fiction Competition and won the Best NPC Award at the 2012 XYZZY Awards.

In 2009, Munroe co-founded the Toronto-based Hand Eye Society, which supports the creation and appreciation of video games as an artistic medium. He currently runs the Game Arts International Network, a registered not-for-profit focused on interconnecting existing game arts organizations and nurturing new structures in emerging regions. GAIN’s projects include Toronto Games Week and Game Arts International Assembly (GAIA).

Munroe was the Artist-in-Residence at the Art Gallery of Ontario in 2014, where he introduced interactive installations such as the Torontrons, classic arcade cabinets modified to showcase locally developed video games.

<text>Grays Peak is the tenth-highest summit of the Rocky Mountains of North America and the U.S. state of Colorado. The prominent fourteener is the highest summit of the Front Range and the highest point on the Continental Divide and the Continental Divide Trail in North America. (There are higher summits, such as Mount Elbert, which are near, but not on, the Divide.) Grays Peak is located in Arapahoe National Forest, southeast by east (bearing 122°) of Loveland Pass on the Continental Divide between Clear Creek and Summit counties. The peak is the highest point in both counties.

Grays Peak is one of 53 fourteeners (mountains of over in elevation) in Colorado. Botanist Charles C. Parry made the first recorded ascent of the summit in 1861 and named the peak in honor of his botanist colleague Asa Gray. Gray did not see (and climb) the peak until 1872, eleven years later. Grays Peak is commonly mentioned in conjunction with adjacent Torreys Peak. In the Arapaho language Gray&#x27;s Peak and the adjacent Torrey&#x27;s Peak are named, &quot;Heeniiyoowuu&quot; or &quot;Ant Hills&quot;.

==Climbing==
Like the other fourteeners nearby, Grays Peak is considered to be an easy hike by fourteener standards, and is very popular among weekend climbers. Often a climb to the summit of Grays Peak is accompanied by continuing on to Torreys Peak, less than a mile away. The main trail, Grays Peak Trail, departs from Stevens Gulch. With cuts in the road over two feet deep and large stones in the path, travel to the trailhead is only feasible for high-clearance four-wheel-drive vehicles, motorcycles or all-terrain vehicles.

From the trailhead, it is a hike of about and a climb of . The trail, well-marked and well-trodden, begins by following the gulch for a slow rise in elevation, before hitting the steeper slopes. The summit includes a very small U-shaped rock shelter where a log book is maintained. Extensive views stretch south to Pike&#x27;s Peak and the San Luis Valley, east to the Great Plains, West to Silverthorne, and north to Longs Peak and Rocky Mountain National Park. At the climber&#x27;s option, the trail continues from the summit north to Torreys Peak. The trail descends the saddle down to before climbing back to the summit of Torreys Peak at .
==Climate==
==Wildlife==
Wildlife in the area includes, mountain goat, pika, cougar or mountain lion, mule deer, elk, marmot, coyote, ptarmigan, American red squirrel, and Canada jay. Wildflowers that bloom in the tundra area on the Continental Divide of the Americas include moss campion (&quot;Silene acaulis&quot;), alpine forget-me-not (&quot;Myosotis alpestris&quot;), sky pilot (&quot;Polemonium viscosum&quot;), sea pink, old-man-of-the-mountain (&quot;Rydbergia grandiflora&quot;), and mountain gentian (&quot;Gentiana&quot;). Below the tree-line, the blooms of monkshood or wolfsbane, blue columbine, fireweed, and paintbrush (&quot;Castilleja&quot;) can be found.

<doc id="886915" wikidata="Q6747391" url="?curid=886915" title="Manchester docks">
<text>Manchester docks were nine docks in Salford, Stretford and Manchester, at the eastern end of the Manchester Ship Canal in North West England, which formed part of the Port of Manchester from 1894 until their closure in 1982. They marked the upper reaches of the ship canal, and were a destination for both coastal and ocean-bound vessels carrying cargo and passengers, often travelling to and from Canada.

Manchester docks were divided into two sections; the larger Salford docks to the west of the Trafford Road swing bridge and Pomona docks to the east. Each section consisted of four docks in total, the largest being to the west; Dock 5 at Pomona was never fully completed. Of the eight working docks only one, Dock 1 at Pomona, was within Manchester itself. 

In the 1970s the docks began a rapid decline, largely due to containerisation. The increasing size of freight-carrying ships meant they could no longer navigate the Manchester Ship Canal and this, combined with increased trading with Europe and the East, saw use of Manchester Docks decrease. In 1982, the remaining docks closed and the area became derelict. Salford City Council bought the docks in 1984 using a derelict land grant and their redevelopment as Salford Quays began 1985, transforming the area for commercial, residential and leisure use.

==Salford docks==

The Salford docks are the western (downstream) block, made of four large docks running ENE from the canal, numbered 9, 8, 7 and 6, the last three off a turning basin. They have now been redeveloped into Salford Quays.

*Dock 9 is the largest of the docks and was the site of the Manchester Liners container service to Montreal, Quebec. Today the upper reaches contain cleaned water and have been cut off from their former connection to the ship canal. This cleaned water is accessed from Dock 8 via a new canal through Pier 8, while the lower section remains open to ship canal traffic. This dock was the last to be constructed, built on the former New Barnes site of Manchester Racecourse, and opened in the early years of the 20th century.
*Dock 8 remains largely intact, although its entrance to the ship canal has been made considerably narrower. It is now accessed through a lock beneath a pedestrian drawbridge, which is used as a buffer to separate the cleaned water of docks 7, 8 and 9 from the relatively untreated water of the ship canal. This is the only route into the redeveloped basins of docks 9 and 7. The lock and drawbridge are mechanised and controlled from the Salford Quays Operations Tower.
*Dock 7 has been cut off from the ship canal and divided into a series of small basins, linking Piers 6 and 7 by road and pedestrian footbridges. The basins provide a habitat for wildlife and the introduced fish stock. Access is again from Dock 8, at its north eastern end.
*Dock 6 is retained in largely its original configuration.

The smaller basins into which the docks have been divided are all named after North American lakes, reflecting the area&#x27;s strong trading links the docks had with North America.

Upstream of Dock 6 there is a triangular depression in the canal wall on a similar alignment to the other docks: this was originally a second navigable channel under a fixed road bridge. At the end of the 19th century the channel was infilled above the bridge and the remainder retained as a wharf. Later this arm was further truncated into the vestige seen today.

While Dock 9 was being built there were plans to construct a further dock (Dock 10) downstream of, and parallel to, Dock 9. Maps from 1921 still show the proposed dock, but it is omitted on later editions.

==Pomona docks==
Pomona docks was a set of five docks on the Manchester Ship Canal. Unlike the former docks in what is now Salford Quays, there has been little redevelopment.

Dock 5, Ordsall Dock, was a rectangular dock on the opposite bank to the other docks, and was situated directly opposite docks 3-4. Docks 4-2 left the canal at an angle, running east from the canal, each around long, whilst Dock 1 (mostly in the City of Manchester) was somewhat longer at , and ran almost parallel to the canal in a NE direction.

*Dock 5 was infilled at the end of the 19th century, during the construction of Dock 9.
*Dock 4 has now been entirely infilled, and almost no trace remains on the ground, although vague outlines of the dock can still be seen on aerial photographs.
*Dock 3 remains intact, having been later used as the point for Pomona Lock (which connects the Manchester Ship Canal to the Bridgewater Canal, replacing the redundant Hulme Lock further upstream).
*Dock 2 has been infilled along most of its length, although a short stump of the dock remains connected to the canal.
*Dock 1 has been infilled, although a depression in the canal bank exists across the former dock mouth.

The official terminus of the canal is several hundred metres further up the canal, at a point where it is crossed by a footbridge. Between the four main docks and Pomona docks was a swinging road bridge. In the 1960s its openings and closings were announced by a man blowing a hunting horn.

The Pomona docks were built on the site of the Pomona Gardens, named after the Roman goddess Pomona. The swinging roadbridge separating Salford Quays from Pomona docks is now permanently closed, and only small pleasure craft can pass under it into Pomona docks. The gardens gave their name to a public house at Cornbrook. The area is served by the Pomona tram stop on the Manchester Metrolink.

<text>The 600-ship Navy was a strategic plan of the United States Navy during the 1980s to rebuild its fleet after cutbacks that followed the end of the Vietnam War. The plan, which originated with Republican leaders, was an important campaign plank of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election, who advocated a larger military and strategic confrontation with the Soviet Union.

The number of ships peaked at 594 in 1987, before declining sharply after the end of the Cold War in 1989–1992.

The program included:
* Recommissioning the s
* Keeping older ships in service longer
* A large new construction program
* Stepping up production of s

The idea was supported by John F. Lehman, who became Reagan&#x27;s Secretary of the Navy, and Caspar Weinberger, Reagan&#x27;s Secretary of Defense.

==Background==
The idea behind the 600-ship Navy can be traced back to the Vietnam War. During the war, the armed services rapidly expanded to meet the demands placed on them.

The Soviet Union, which had been supporting North Vietnam, began staging their naval vessels from former U.S. ports in South Vietnam. Building on this gain, Soviet vessels began to sail in all seven seas with increased vigor and even ventured into the Gulf of Mexico. Soviet forces also stepped up infantry, armor, and air force deployments in Eastern Europe.

==Reagan plan==
It was against this backdrop in 1980 that the United States began an election year. President Reagan continued this in 1984, releasing a campaign commercial &quot;Bear,&quot; which played on the use of the bear as a national symbol of Russia in order to promote higher vigilance and defense expenditures against the Soviet Union.

The overseas strategic retaliation arm was strengthened and the development of new weaponry like the B-1B bomber, the Bradley fighting vehicle, and the Abrams tank was completed and they were put into production.

Lehman attempted to &quot;front-load&quot; the program, by committing the Navy to the building program, but in the end the funds were not available and it fell short.

==Ships and weapons systems deployed during the plan==
The Navy saw the largest benefit of the rebuilding. Under the Reagan administration, the first of the ballistic missile submarines were completed. This class was the largest submarine ever built in the U.S. The ship carried 24 Trident I nuclear-capable missiles, each one with a range. Construction of the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class of supercarriers and attack submarines were dramatically stepped up. The revolutionary new Aegis Combat System was installed on the upcoming ships, production of which was also stepped up. Several aircraft carriers were put through Service Life Extension Programs (SLEPs) aimed at keeping them in service longer. The &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships, built in the 1940s, were all recommissioned and refitted with RGM-84 Harpoon, BGM-109 Tomahawk, and Phalanx CIWS system capabilities, plus their armor plating would be more resilient against anti-ship missiles. The first Harpoons, Tomahawks, and AGM-88 HARM missiles all debuted on the navy&#x27;s ships. Naval aviation was stepped up with the introduction of the F/A-18 Hornet, along with improved versions of the EA-6 Prowler electronic countermeasure aircraft, the A-6 Intruder, and the F-14 Tomcat. In addition, the nation&#x27;s strategic retaliatory arm was strengthened with advanced B-1B bombers and deploying Pershing II theater missiles to Europe. The initiative also included deployment of Abrams main battle tanks and Bradley armored fighting vehicles. U.S. Navy unclassified miscellaneous ships, auxiliary ships, and yard ships are not included in the ship count.

==End of the plan==
Eventually political pressure to reduce the national budget deficit resulted in Congress reversing itself and passing a series of declining defense budgets beginning in 1986. Weinberger clashed with Congress over the cuts, resigning in late 1987, and was succeeded by Frank Carlucci. Furthermore, concerns were raised about how the expansion of the Navy would reduce attention and resources needed in other scenarios where the Soviets also had to be confronted such as Europe.

Lehman&#x27;s successor as Navy Secretary, Jim Webb, remained a fierce proponent of the expanded fleet, and disagreed with Carlucci over how to cut the Navy budget in line with other services. Webb resigned rather than endorse Carlucci&#x27;s cut of 16 frigates. As revealed in &quot;The Reagan Diaries&quot;, Reagan reflected about Webb&#x27;s resignation on 22 February 1988: &quot;Present Sec. Webb resigned over budget cuts. I don&#x27;t think Navy was sorry to see him go.&quot;

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the lack of a perceived threat against the United States, several of the Reagan Administration&#x27;s policies and plans, such as the &quot;600-ship Navy&quot;, were scaled back or abandoned. U.S. bases across Europe and North America were slowly decommissioned and closed, others were mothballed through the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process. In the Navy, this resulted in the retirement of several older carriers, the decommissioning of all four of the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships and the cancellation of the remaining s.

<text>Strathgordon is a rural locality in the local government area (LGA) of Derwent Valley in the South-east LGA region of Tasmania. The locality is about west of the town of New Norfolk. The 2016 census recorded a population of 15 for the state suburb of Southwest, which includes Strathgordon.
It is on the road to the Gordon River Dam the most south westerly road in the south west of Tasmania. It is a tourist destination for visitors wishing to visit the Southwest National Park and World Heritage listed wilderness.

It is remote by Tasmanian standards; however, fuel can be purchased at the Lake Pedder Wilderness Lodge which also provides accommodation and meals. The nearest basic services, otherwise, are away along a winding road from Maydena. From Maydena, access can be made along the Gordon River Road to the major population centers of Tasmania. The road is maintained by Hydro Tasmania and has views of the South Western Wilderness.

==History== 
Strathgordon was gazetted as a locality in 1968.
The town was the &#x27;company&#x27; town for construction by the Hydro Tasmania of the hydro-electric structures that resulted in damming of Lake Pedder and Lake Gordon. Its post office opened on 16 July 1969.

==Geography==
The locality is completely surrounded by the much larger locality of Southwest.

==Road infrastructure==
Route B61 (Gordon River Road) runs through from south-east to south-west.

<text>Cross-cutting is an editing technique most often used in films to establish action occurring at the same time, and often in the same place. In a cross-cut, the camera will cut away from one action to another action, which can suggest the simultaneity of these two actions but this is not always the case. Cross-cutting can also be used for characters in a film with the same goals but different ways of achieving them.

Suspense may be added by cross-cutting. It is built through the expectations that it creates and in the hopes that it will be explained with time. Cross-cutting also forms parallels; it illustrates a narrative action that happens in several places at approximately the same time. For instance, in D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;A Corner in Wheat&quot; (1909), the film cross-cuts between the activities of rich businessmen and poor people waiting in line for bread. This creates a sharp dichotomy between the two actions, and encourages the viewer to compare the two shots. Often, this contrast is used for strong emotional effect, and frequently at the climax of a film. The rhythm of, or length of time between, cross-cuts can also set the rhythm of a scene. Increasing the rapidity between two different actions may add tension to a scene, much in the same manner of using short, declarative sentences in a work of literature.

Cross-cutting was established as a film-making technique relatively early in film history (two examples being Edwin Porter&#x27;s 1903 short &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; and Louis J. Gasnier&#x27;s 1908 short &quot;The Runaway Horse&quot;); Griffith was its most famous practitioner. The technique is showcased in his Biograph work, such as &quot;A Corner in Wheat&quot; and 1911&#x27;s &quot;The Lonedale Operator&quot;. His 1915 film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; contains textbook examples of cross-cutting and firmly established it as a staple of film editing. Mrinal Sen has used cross-cutting effectively in his agit-prop film &quot;Interview&quot;, which achieved significant commercial success. Christopher Nolan uses cross-cutting extensively in films such as &quot;Interstellar&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; and &quot;Inception&quot; - particularly in the latter, in which sequences depict multiple simultaneous levels of consciousness. &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; is known for its numerous cross-cuts between the film&#x27;s six different stories, some lasting only a few seconds yet spanning across hundreds of years in different locations around the world. Its cuts are eased by the similar emotional tone depicted by each side&#x27;s action.

Cross-cutting is often used during phone-conversation sequences so that viewers see both characters&#x27; facial expressions in response to what is said.
