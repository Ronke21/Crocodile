<text>A keychain () (also keyring) is a small ring or chain of metal to which several keys, or fobs can be attached. The terms keyring &amp; keychain are often used interchangeably to mean both the individual ring, or a combined unit of a ring and fob. 

The length of a keychain or fob may also allow an item to be used more easily than if connected directly to a keyring. Some keychains allow one or both ends to rotate, keeping the keychain from becoming twisted, while the item is being used.

==Use of keychains==
=== Advertising &amp; Souvenirs ===
Keychains are one of the most common souvenir and advertising items. 

In the 1950s and 1960s, with the improvement of plastic manufacturing techniques, promotional items including keychains became unique. Businesses could place their names and logos on promotional keychains that were three-dimensional for less cost than the standard metal keychains.

Keychains are small and inexpensive enough to become promotional items for larger national companies that might give them out by the millions. For example, with the launch of a new movie or television show, those companies might partner with food companies to provide a character keychain in each box of cereal.

These same qualities also make them cheap and easy to produce for consumers, and these have become popular souvenir and novelty items. Destination souvenir keychains will often bear the name of the destination or be shaped like something people relate to the destination, such as a sandal for a beach, or skis for a mountain. The ease of production has created a wide range of options for consumers and businesses alike. 

=== Securing keys and other items ===
A keychain can also be a connecting link between a keyring and the belt, bag, or other garment. Keychains with an actual chain or string are usually used by personnel whose job demands frequent use of keys, such as a security guard, prison officer, janitor, or retail store manager. The chain is often retractable, and therefore may be a nylon rope, instead of an actual metal chain. The chain ensures that the keys remain attached to the individual using them, makes accidental loss less likely, and saves on wear and tear on the pockets of the user.

Many keychains also offer other functions that the owner wants easily accessible as well. These can include army knives, bottle openers, nail clippers, pill cases, or pepper spray among many others. An electronic key finder is also a useful item found on many keys that will beep when summoned for quick finding when misplaced.

== Keyring ==

A keyring or &quot;split ring&quot; is a circle cotter that holds keys and other small items sometimes connected to keychains. Other types of keyrings are made of leather, wood and rubber. These are the central component to a keychain.

Keyrings were invented in the 19th century by Samuel Harrison. The most common form of the keyring is a single piece of metal in a &#x27;double loop&#x27;. Either end of the loop can be pried open to allow a key to be inserted and slid along the spiral until it becomes wholly engaged onto the ring. Novelty carabiners are also commonly used as keyrings for ease of access and exchange. Often the keyring is adorned with a fob for self-identification or decor. Other forms of rings may use a single loop of metal or plastic with a mechanism to open and securely close the loop.

== Key fob ==

A key fob is a generally decorative and at times useful item many people often carry with their keys, on a ring or a chain, for ease of tactile identification, to provide a better grip, or to make a personal statement. Key fob can also specifically refer to modern electronic car keys, or smart keys, which serve as both a key and remote.

The word &quot;fob&quot; may be linked to the low German dialect for the word &quot;Fuppe&quot;, meaning &quot;pocket&quot;; however, the real origin of the word is uncertain. Fob pockets (meaning &#x27;sneak proof&#x27; from the German word &quot;foppen&quot;) were pockets meant to deter thieves. A short &quot;fob chain&quot; was used to attach to items, like a pocket watch, placed in these pockets. 

Fobs vary considerably in size, style and functionality. Most commonly they are simple discs of smooth metal or plastic, typically with a message or symbol such as that of a logo (as with conference trinkets) or a sign of an important group affiliation. A fob may be symbolic or strictly aesthetic, but it can also be a small tool. Many fobs are small flashlights, compasses, calculators, penknives, discount cards, bottle openers, security tokens, and USB flash drives. As electronic technology continues to become smaller and cheaper, miniature key-fob versions of (previously) larger devices are becoming common, such as digital photo frames, remote control units for garage door openers, barcode scanners and simple video games (e.g. Tamagotchi) or other gadgets such as breathalyzers.

Some retail establishments such as gasoline stations keep their bathrooms locked and customers must ask for the key from the attendant. In such cases the key often has a very large fob so that customers will not automatically pocket and walk off with the key after completing their ablutions. Key fobs offering added functionalities connected to online services may require additional subscription payment to access them.

===Access control key fobs===
Access control key fobs are electronic key fobs that are used for controlling access to buildings or vehicles. They are used for activating such things as remote keyless entry systems on motor vehicles. Early electric key fobs operated using infrared and required a clear line-of-sight to function. These could be copied using a programmable remote control. More recent models use challenge–response authentication over radio frequency, so these are harder to copy and do not need line-of-sight to operate. Programming these remotes sometimes requires the automotive dealership to connect a diagnostic tool, but many of them can be self-programmed by following a sequence of steps in the vehicle and usually requires at least one working key.

Key fobs are used in apartment buildings and condominium buildings for controlling access to common areas (for example, lobby doors, storage areas, fitness room, pool). These usually contain a passive RFID tag. The fob operates in much the same manner as a proximity card to communicate (via a reader pad) with a central server for the building, which can be programmed to allow access only to those areas in which the tenant or owner is permitted to access, or only within certain time frames.

Remote workers may also use a security token – an electronic device often referred to as a fob – that provides one part of a three-way match to log in over an unsecure computer network connection to a secure network. (A well-known example is the RSA SecurID token.) This kind of key fob may have a keypad on which the user must enter a PIN to retrieve an access code, or it could be a display-only device.

RFID key fobs can be easily cloned with tools like the Proxmark3, and there are several companies in America that offer this service.

== Costs ==

The cost of keychains in the United States varies widely depending on their purpose. Advertising keychains begin at only a few cents to a few dollars each when purchased in large quantities as giveaways. Souvenir keychains or novelty keychains representing bands, movies, games, etc., are also considered to be inexpensive, ranging from US$1 up to US$15. 

Electronic keychains including games and small organizers start at a few dollars and can be up to US$50. Other keychain electronics including cameras, digital photo frames, and USB drives cost US$10 to US$100.

== As a collectible item ==
The most popular focused keychain collections are advertising, souvenir, monument, popular characters and nostalgia-related items. Keychains are typically not made specifically for collecting on large scale, and do not hold their value as well as other collections. A standard keychain that was purchased for ten dollars new may only be worth less than a dollar once it has been owned regardless of condition.
Collectors display and store their keychains in several different ways. Some collections are small enough that the collector can place all of their keychains on their standard key ring. Some larger collections can be stored and displayed on dowels, cork boards, tool racks, on large link chains, in display cases, hung on walls, or displayed on Christmas trees. Some collections are large enough that entire rooms are dedicated to the keychain collection.

According to Guinness World Records, the largest collection of keychains consists of 62,257 items, achieved by Angel Alvarez Cornejo in Sevilla, Spain, as verified on 25 June 2016. His collection began at the age of 7. Due to the tremendous size of his collection he now stores his keychains in his garage and a rented warehouse. The previous record holder was Brent Dixon of Georgia, United States with the largest collection of keychains, at 41,418 non-duplicated ones.

== Computer keychains ==
By analogy to the physical object, the terms &quot;keychain&quot; and &quot;keyring&quot; are often used for software that stores cryptographic keys. The term keychain was first introduced in a series of IBM developerWorks articles. The term is used in GNU Privacy Guard to store known keys on a keyring. Mac OS X uses a password storage system called Keychain. A &quot;keyring&quot; is also the name of a password manager application working under the GNOME desktop manager (used for example in Ubuntu operating system). In cryptography a keyring is a database of multiple keys or passwords. There are also portable password manager programs, such as Keepass and KeePassX.

<doc id="884782" wikidata="Q237864" url="?curid=884782" title="Vera Miles">
<text>Vera June Miles (née Ralston; born August 23, 1929) is an American retired actress. She is known for appearing in John Ford&#x27;s Western films &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956) and &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; (1962), and for playing Lila Crane in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) and Richard Franklin&#x27;s sequel &quot;Psycho II&quot; (1983). 

Miles&#x27; other film credits include &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Hidden Jungle&quot; (1955), &quot;The Wrong Man&quot; (1956), &quot;A Touch of Larceny&quot; (1959), &quot;Follow Me, Boys!&quot; (1966), &quot;Hellfighters&quot; (1968), &quot;Sergeant Ryker&quot; (1968), and &quot;Molly and Lawless John&quot; (1972).

==Early life==
Vera June Ralston was born in Boise City, Oklahoma, on August 23, 1929.

She grew up first in Pratt, Kansas, and later lived in Wichita, where she worked nights as a Western Union operator-typist and graduated from Wichita North High School in 1947. She was crowned Miss Kansas in 1948 and was the third runner-up in the Miss America contest.

==Career==
Miles moved to Los Angeles in 1949 and landed small roles in television and film, including a minor role as a chorus girl in &quot;Two Tickets to Broadway&quot; (1951), a musical starring Janet Leigh, with whom Miles would co-star nine years later in the classic Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;Psycho&quot;. She used her first husband&#x27;s name, Miles, because there already was a Vera Ralston film actress. Miles eventually was put under contract at various studios. She once recalled, &quot;I was dropped by the best studios in town.&quot;

Miles&#x27;s first credited film appearance was in &quot;The Rose Bowl Story&quot; (1952), a romantic comedy in which she played a Tournament of Roses queen. While under contract to Warner Bros., Miles was cast alongside her future husband Gordon Scott in the 1955 film &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Hidden Jungle&quot; as Tarzan&#x27;s love interest. The following year, she was cast by director John Ford as Jeffrey Hunter&#x27;s love interest in the John Wayne Western &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956), and appeared in the movies &quot;Wichita&quot;, directed by Jacques Tourneur and &quot;23 Paces to Baker Street&quot; with Van Johnson. Also in 1956, Miles starred as Rose Balestrero, the fragile wife of Manny Balestrero, a musician falsely accused of a crime and played by Henry Fonda, in the film &quot;The Wrong Man&quot;. The movie was directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and is one of only a few Hitchcock films based on real-life events.

Signing a five-year personal contract with Hitchcock in 1957, Miles was widely publicized as the director&#x27;s potential successor to Grace Kelly. Two years prior, Hitchcock had directed Miles in the role of Ralph Meeker&#x27;s emotionally troubled new bride in &quot;Revenge&quot;, the pilot episode of his television series &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;.

&quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958), a project Hitchcock designed as a showcase for his new star, was met with production delays. Miles&#x27;s subsequent pregnancy would cost her the lead role, which eventually went to Kim Novak. &quot;Vertigo&quot; (which also starred James Stewart) was not a financial or critical success at the time, with Hitchcock claiming that Novak was miscast. Despite Hitchcock&#x27;s disappointment regarding &quot;Vertigo&quot;, he continued to work with Miles, eventually casting her in what is arguably the role for which she is most remembered, that of Lila Crane in &quot;Psycho&quot;. In the film, she portrayed the determined sister of the doomed motel guest Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), who teams up with Marion&#x27;s boyfriend and a private investigator to find her. Miles later appeared in two episodes of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; (in 1962 and 1965).

In 1962, Miles reunited with director John Ford for the film &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot;. Starring alongside her former co-star from &quot;The Searchers&quot;, John Wayne, she is courted by both Wayne and James Stewart, two very different men competing for her hand in marriage.In addition to her film appearances, Miles was featured in many popular television shows throughout her career, including &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Laramie&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, and the Western series &quot;Riverboat&quot;, starring Darren McGavin and Burt Reynolds. She co-starred in the first episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (titled &quot;Fear in a Desert City&quot;) and guest-starred in episodes of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, and &quot;Ironside&quot;.

In 1965, Miles had a supporting role in three episodes of the CBS series &quot;My Three Sons&quot;. The same year, she co-starred with lead actors Robert Culp and Bill Cosby in the pilot episode of the TV series &quot;I Spy&quot; entitled &quot;Affair in T&#x27;Sien Cha&quot; (although the pilot was not actually broadcast until midway through the series&#x27;s first season).

Other notable films in which Miles appeared included the Walt Disney film &quot;Follow Me, Boys!&quot; (1966) with Fred MacMurray. In &quot;Hellfighters&quot; (1968), she played Katharine Ross&#x27; mother, although she is only nine years Ross&#x27;s senior. The film also reunited her with John Wayne. Miles had filmed scenes with Wayne for the movie &quot;The Green Berets&quot; (also 1968), playing Wayne&#x27;s character&#x27;s wife. However, with Warner Bros. wanting more action in the film, her scenes were cut.

Miles continued to appear in numerous TV films and TV series during the 1970s, including the pilot for the TV series &quot;Cannon&quot; (broadcast in March 1971) as the wife of a deceased war comrade of private investigator Frank Cannon&#x27;s, played by William Conrad. Miles also appeared on the pilot of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; in 1966. She guest-starred in a further two episodes of the series in different roles during its run. In 1973, she appeared alongside Peter Falk in &quot;Lovely but Lethal&quot;, an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Columbo&quot;, playing a cosmetics queen who commits murder. She also made guest appearances in episodes of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, and &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;.

In 1983, more than 20 years after &quot;Psycho&quot;, Miles reprised the role of Lila Crane in &quot;Psycho II&quot;, joining Anthony Perkins in the sequel. Miles and Perkins were the only stars of the original film to appear in this second installment. Miles continued to appear in a number of TV and film productions during the 1980s, with appearances in the movies &quot;The Initiation&quot; (1984) and &quot;Into the Night&quot; (1985), and guest-starring in episodes of the TV series &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (1982 and 1984) and &quot;Hotel&quot; (1984 and 1987). She appeared in three episodes of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; (broadcast in 1985, 1990, and 1991). The 1991 episode, titled &quot;Thursday&#x27;s Child&quot;, was her final television role. Her last acting role was in the film &quot;Separate Lives&quot; (1995). She then retired from the industry.

==Personal life==
Miles has been married three times. Her first husband was stuntman and bit-part actor Bob Miles. They were married from 1948 to 1954, and had two daughters, Debra and Kelley. Her second husband was actor and bodybuilder Gordon Scott, her co-star in &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Hidden Jungle&quot;. They were married from 1956 to 1960 and had one son, Michael. Her third husband was actor Keith Larsen. They were married from 1960 to 1971 and had one son, Erik. 

One of her grandsons, actor Jordan Essoe, met with actress Jessica Biel in 2012 in preparation for Biel&#x27;s portrayal of Miles in the film &quot;Hitchcock&quot;.

Miles is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She also has been a frequent visitor to Salt Lake City, Utah, was greatly involved in the Boy Scouts of America, and is a member of the Hollywood California Stake.

Miles supported the re-election of Dwight D. Eisenhower during the 1956 United States presidential election.

<text>Luigi Vanvitelli (; 12 May 1700 – 1 March 1773), known in Dutch as (), was an Italian architect and painter. The most prominent 18th-century architect of Italy, he practised a sober classicising academic Late Baroque style that made an easy transition to Neoclassicism.

==Biography==

Vanvitelli was born in Naples, the son of an Italian woman, Anna Lorenzani, and a Dutch painter of land and cityscapes (veduta), Caspar van Wittel, who also used the name Vanvitelli.

He was trained in Rome by the architect Nicola Salvi, with whom he worked on the construction of the Trevi Fountain. Following his notable successes in the competitions for the facade of the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano (1732) and the facade of Palazzo Poli behind the Trevi Fountain, Pope Clement XII sent him to the Marche to build some papal projects. At Ancona in 1732, he devised the vast Lazaretto, a pentagonal building covering more than 20,000 square meters, built to protect the military defensive authorities from the risk of contagious diseases potentially reaching the town with the ships. Later it was used also as a military hospital or as barracks.

In Rome, Vanvitelli stabilized the dome of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica when it developed cracks and found time to paint frescos in a chapel at Sant Cecilia in Trastevere. He also built a bridge over the Calore Irpino in Benevento.

Beginning in 1742 Vanvitelli designed (along with Nicola Salvi) the Chapel of St. John the Baptist for King John V of Portugal. It was built in Rome, disassembled in 1747, and shipped to Lisbon, where it was reassembled in the Church of St. Roch (Igreja de São Roque). It was completed in 1750, although the mosaics in it were not finished until 1752. Built of many precious marbles and other costly stones, as well as gilt bronze, it was held to be the most expensive chapel in Europe up to that time.

==Reggia di Caserta==

Vanvitelli&#x27;s technical and engineering capabilities, together with his sense of scenographic drama led Charles VII of Naples (later King Charles III of Spain) to commission the grand Palace of Caserta, intended as a fresh start for administering the ungovernable Kingdom of Naples. Charles VII of Naples desired a palace which would rival the Palace of Versailles and therefore commissioned Vanvitelli to create what he desired to be the most beautiful palace in Europe. Of all the royal palaces in the world, Caserta is by far the largest in terms of volume, with more than 2 million m³.

Included in the Reggia di Caserta was the fan-shaped &quot;Vigna del Ventaglio&quot; vineyard. Planted on sloping terrain in the San Leucio &quot;frazione&quot; near the palace, the vineyard was planted in a semicircle design subdivided into 10 segments (or &quot;fan blades&quot;) each planted to a different grape variety. Among the varieties known to have been planted in the &quot;Vigna del Ventaglio&quot; were native Campanian varieties Pallagrello bianco and Pallagrello nero.

Vanvitelli worked on the project for the rest of his life, for Charles and for his successor Ferdinand IV. In Naples, he added to the city&#x27;s royal palace (1753) and some aristocratic palaces, and churches such as the new church and monastery for the Missione ai Vergini. His engineering talents were exercised as well: for Caserta, he devised the great aqueduct system that brought water to run the cascades and fountains.

Luigi Vanvitelli died at Caserta in 1773.

<text>The Snoqualmie Valley is a farming and timber-producing region located along the Snoqualmie River in Western Washington, United States. The valley stretches from the confluence of the three forks of the river at North Bend to the confluence of the Snoqualmie River and the Skykomish River (home to the &quot;Skykomish / Skai-whamish&quot;, a Snoqualmie band), forming the Snohomish River at Monroe. This stretch of the river includes Snoqualmie Falls. Towns in the valley are North Bend, Snoqualmie, Preston, Fall City, Carnation, and Duvall.

Hops were the major crop of this region in the late 19th century.

The valley is the ancestral home of the Snoqualmie people. The name Snoqualmie comes from the native word for &quot;Moon the Transformer&quot; and originates in the creation myth of the Snoqualmie people.

== Culture ==
Although the Snoqualmie Valley consists of several cities, the main ones are Snoqualmie, North Bend, Carnation, and Duvall.

David Lynch&#x27;s show Twin Peaks was filmed in the area including Snoqualmie, North Bend, and Fall City.

== Transportation ==

The eastern side of the Snoqualmie Valley is served by State Route 203, which runs from Fall City to Monroe.

<text>Haghpat () is a village in the Lori Province of Armenia, located near the city of Alaverdi and the state border with Georgia.

The village is notable for Haghpat Monastery, a medieval monastery complex founded in the 10th century, and included in the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1996 along with nearby Sanahin Monastery.

== Geography ==
The village lies on a dissected plateau, a large flat area dissected by deep &quot;cracks&quot; formed by rivers, including the river Debed. The villages of Sanahin and Akner, as well as a part of Alaverdi, lie in plain view on neighbouring sections of the plateau. However, a steep and long descent to and ascent from the river is required to travel to them.

<doc id="884805" wikidata="Q6556376" url="?curid=884805" title="Lipidomics">
<text>Lipidomics is the large-scale study of pathways and networks of cellular lipids in biological systems. The word &quot;lipidome&quot; is used to describe the complete lipid profile within a cell, tissue, organism, or ecosystem and is a subset of the &quot;metabolome&quot; which also includes other major classes of biological molecules (such as amino acids, sugars, glycolysis &amp; TCA intermediates, and nucleic acids). Lipidomics is a relatively recent research field that has been driven by rapid advances in technologies such as mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, dual polarisation interferometry and computational methods, coupled with the recognition of the role of lipids in many metabolic diseases such as obesity, atherosclerosis, stroke, hypertension and diabetes. This rapidly expanding field complements the huge progress made in genomics and proteomics, all of which constitute the family of systems biology.

Lipidomics research involves the identification and quantification of the thousands of cellular lipid molecular species and their interactions with other lipids, proteins, and other metabolites. Investigators in lipidomics examine the structures, functions, interactions, and dynamics of cellular lipids and the changes that occur during perturbation of the system.

Han and Gross first defined the field of lipidomics through integrating the specific chemical properties inherent in lipid molecular species with a comprehensive mass spectrometric approach. Although lipidomics is under the umbrella of the more general field of &quot;metabolomics&quot;, lipidomics is itself a distinct discipline due to the uniqueness and functional specificity of lipids relative to other metabolites.

In lipidomic research, a vast amount of information quantitatively describing the spatial and temporal alterations in the content and composition of different lipid molecular species is accrued after perturbation of a cell through changes in its physiological or pathological state. Information obtained from these studies facilitates mechanistic insights into changes in cellular function. Therefore, lipidomic studies play an essential role in defining the biochemical mechanisms of lipid-related disease processes through identifying alterations in cellular lipid metabolism, trafficking and homeostasis. The growing attention on lipid research is also seen from the initiatives underway of the LIPID Metabolites And Pathways Strategy (LIPID MAPS Consortium). and The European Lipidomics Initiative (ELIfe).

== Structural diversity of lipids ==
Lipids are a diverse and ubiquitous group of compounds which have many key biological functions, such as acting as structural components of cell membranes, serving as energy storage sources and participating in signaling pathways. Lipids may be broadly defined as hydrophobic or amphipathic small molecules that originate entirely or in part from two distinct types of biochemical subunits or &quot;building blocks&quot;: ketoacyl and isoprene groups. The
huge structural diversity found in lipids arises from the biosynthesis of various combinations of these building blocks. For example, glycerophospholipids are composed of a glycerol backbone linked to one of approximately 10 possible headgroups and also to 2 fatty acyl/alkyl chains, which in turn may have 30 or more different molecular structures. In practice, not all possible permutations are detected experimentally, due to chain preferences depending on the cell type and also to detection limits - nevertheless several hundred distinct glycerophospholipid molecular species have been detected in mammalian cells.

Plant chloroplast thylakoid membranes however, have &quot;unique lipid composition&quot; as they are deficient in phospholipids. Also, their largest constituent, &quot;monogalactosyl diglyceride or MGDG&quot;, does not form aqueous bilayers. Nevertheless, dynamic studies reveal a normal lipid bilayer organisation in thylakoid membranes.

== Experimental techniques ==

=== Lipid extraction ===
Most methods of lipid extraction and isolation from biological samples exploit the high solubility of hydrocarbon chains in organic solvents. Given the diversity in lipid classes, it is not possible to accommodate all classes with a common extraction method. The traditional Bligh/Dyer procedure 
uses chloroform/methanol-based protocols that include phase partitioning into the organic layer. However, several protocols now exist, with newer methods overcoming the shortcomings of older ones and solving problems associated with, for example, targeted lipid isolation or high throughput data collection 
. Most protocols work relatively well for a variety of physiologically relevant lipids but they have to be adapted for species with particular properties and low-abundance and labile lipid metabolites

=== Lipid separation ===
The simplest method of lipid separation is the use of thin layer chromatography (TLC). Although not as sensitive as other methods of lipid detection, it offers a rapid and comprehensive screening tool prior to more sensitive and sophisticated techniques.
Solid-phase extraction (SPE) chromatography is useful for rapid, preparative separation of crude lipid mixtures into different lipid classes. This involves the use of prepacked columns containing silica or other stationary phases to separate glycerophospholipids, fatty acids, cholesteryl esters, glycerolipids, and sterols from crude lipid mixtures.
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC or LC) is extensively used in lipidomic analysis to separate lipids prior to mass analysis. Separation can be achieved by either normal-phase (NP) HPLC or reverse-phase (RP) HPLC. For example, NP-HPLC effectively separates glycerophospholipids on the basis of headgroup polarity, whereas RP-HPLC
effectively separates fatty acids such as eicosanoids on the basis of chain length, degree of unsaturation and substitution. For global, untargeted lipidomic studies it is common to use both RP and NP or Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatrography (HILC) columns for increased lipidome coverage. The application of nano-flow liquid chromatography (nLC) proved thereby to be most efficient to enhance both general measurement sensitivity and lipidome coverage for a global lipidomics approach. Chromatographic (HPLC/UHPLC) separation of lipids may either be performed offline or online where the eluate is integrated with the ionization source of a mass spectrometer.

=== Lipid detection ===
The progress of modern lipidomics has been greatly accelerated by the development of spectrometric methods in general and soft ionization techniques for mass spectrometry such as electrospray ionization (ESI), desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) in particular. &quot;Soft&quot; ionization
does not cause extensive fragmentation, so that comprehensive detection of an entire range of lipids within a complex mixture can be correlated to experimental conditions or disease state. In addition, the technique of atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) has become increasingly popular for the analysis of nonpolar lipids.

==== ESI MS ====
ESI-MS was initially developed by Fenn and colleagues for analysis of biomolecules. It depends on the formation of gaseous ions from polar, thermally labile and mostly non-volatile molecules and thus is completely suitable for a variety of lipids. It is a soft-ionization method that rarely disrupts the chemical nature of the analyte prior to mass analysis. Various ESI-MS methods have been developed for analysis of different classes, subclasses, and individual lipid species from biological extracts. Comprehensive reviews of the methods and their application have recently been published. The major advantages of ESI-MS are high accuracy, sensitivity, reproducibility, and the applicability of the technique to complex solutions without prior derivatization. Han and coworkers have developed a method known as&quot;shotgun lipidomics&quot; which involves direct infusion of a crude lipid extract into an ESI source optimized for intrasource separation of lipids based on their intrinsic electrical properties.

==== DESI MS ====
DESI mass spectrometry is an ambient ionization technique developed by Professor Zoltan Takáts, et al., in Professor Graham Cooks&#x27; group from Purdue University. It combines the ESI and desorption ionization techniques, by directing an electrically charged mist to the sample surface that is a few millimeters away. The technique has been successfully applied to lipidomics as imaging tool to map the lipid distributions within tissue specimens. One of the advantages of DESI MS is that no matrix is required for tissue preparation, allowing multiple consecutive measurements on the same tissue specimen. DESI MS can also be used for imaging of lipids from tissue sections.

==== MALDI MS ====
MALDI mass spectrometry is a laser-based soft-ionization method often used for analysis of large proteins, but has been used successfully for lipids. The lipid is mixed with a matrix, such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and applied to a sample holder as a small spot. A laser is fired at the spot, and the matrix absorbs the energy, which is then transferred to the analyte, resulting in ionization of the molecule. MALDI-Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS has become a very promising approach for lipidomics studies, particularly for the imaging of lipids from tissue slides.

==== APCI MS ====
The source for APCI is similar to ESI except that ions are formed by the interaction of the heated analyte solvent with a corona discharge needle set at a high electrical potential. Primary ions are formed immediately surrounding the needle, and these interact with the solvent to form secondary ions that ultimately ionize the sample. APCI is particularly useful for the analysis of nonpolar lipids such as triacylglycerols, sterols, and fatty acid esters.

== Imaging techniques ==
The high sensitivity of DESI in the lipid range makes it a powerful technique for the detection and mapping of lipids abundances within tissue specimens. Recent developments in MALDI methods have enabled direct detection of lipids in-situ. Abundant lipid-related ions are produced from the direct analysis of thin tissue slices when sequential spectra are acquired across a tissue surface that has been coated with a MALDI matrix. Collisional activation of the molecular ions can be used to determine the lipid family and often structurally define the molecular species. These techniques enable detection of phospholipids, sphingolipids and glycerolipids in tissues such as heart, kidney and brain. Furthermore, distribution of many different lipid molecular species often define anatomical regions within these tissues.

== Lipid profiling ==

Lipid profiling is a targeted metabolomics platform that provides a comprehensive analysis of lipid species within a cell or tissue. Profiling based on electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) is capable of providing quantitative data and is adaptable to high throughput analyses. The powerful approach of transgenics, namely deletion and/or overexpression of a gene product coupled with lipidomics, can give valuable insights into the role of biochemical pathways. Lipid profiling techniques have also been applied to plants and microorganisms such as yeast. A combination of quantitative lipidomic data in conjunction with the corresponding transcriptional data (using gene-array methods) and proteomic data (using tandem MS) enables a systems biology approach to a more in-depth understanding of the metabolic or signaling pathways of interest.

== Informatics ==
A major challenge for lipidomics, in particular for MS-based approaches, lies in the computational and bioinformatic demands of handling the large amount of data that arise at various stages along the chain of information acquisition and processing.
 Chromatographic and MS data collection requires substantial efforts in spectral alignment and statistical evaluation of fluctuations in signal intensities. Such variations have a multitude of origins, including biological variations, sample handling and analytical accuracy. As a consequence several replicates are normally required for reliable determination of lipid levels in complex mixtures. Within the last few years, a number of software packages have been developed by various companies and research groups to analyze data generated by MS profiling of metabolites, including lipids. The data processing for differential profiling usually proceed through several stages, including input file manipulation, spectral filtering, peak detection, chromatographic alignment, normalization, visualization, and data export. An example of metabolic profiling software is the freely-available Java-based Mzmine application. Another is Metabolon, Inc’s commercial applications for metabolomic analysis using proprietary software. Recently MS-DIAL 4 software was integrated with a comprehensive lipidome atlas with retention time, collision cross-section and tandem mass spectrometry information for 117 lipid subclasses and 8,051 lipids. Some software packages such as Markerview include multivariate statistical analysis (for example, principal component analysis) and these will be helpful for the identification of correlations in lipid metabolites that are associated with a physiological phenotype, in particular for the development of lipid-based biomarkers. Another objective of the information technology side of lipidomics involves the construction of metabolic maps from data on lipid structures and lipid-related protein and genes. Some of these lipid pathways are extremely complex, for example the mammalian glycosphingolipid pathway. The establishment of searchable and interactive databases of lipids and lipid-related genes/proteins is also an extremely important resource as a reference for the lipidomics community. Integration of these databases with MS and other experimental data, as well as with metabolic networks offers an opportunity to devise therapeutic strategies to prevent or reverse these pathological states involving dysfunction of lipid-related processes.

<text>The UNIVAC 1100/60, introduced in 1979, continued the venerable UNIVAC 1100 series first introduced in 1962 with the UNIVAC 1107. The 1107 was the first 1100-series machine introduced under the Sperry Corporation name.

Like its predecessors, it had support for multiple CPUs; initially only two, but later up to four. It continued the naming convention introduced with the 1100/10, where the last digit represented the number of CPUs (thus, a four CPU system would be an 1100/64).

The 1100/60 introduced a new feature to the line: the CPUs used microcode that was loaded during the booting process. The booting process was controlled by a microcomputer (called the &quot;SSP&quot; - &quot;System Support Processor&quot;) that ran from 8-inch floppy disks. The microcode was stored on these disks.

The system included an optional (extra-cost) set of additions to the instruction set (referred to as the Extended Instruction Set or EIS), which contained features to enhance the execution of COBOL programs, when appropriately compiled.

The UNIVAC 1100/70 shared much of the same architecture, including the same console and microcode.

<doc id="884809" wikidata="Q132401" url="?curid=884809" title="Pikaia">
<text>Pikaia gracilens is an extinct, primitive chordate marine animal known from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia. Described in 1911 by Charles Doolittle Walcott as an annelid, and in 1979 by Harry B. Whittington and Simon Conway Morris as a chordate, it became &quot;the most famous early chordate fossil&quot;, or &quot;famously known as the earliest described Cambrian chordate&quot;. It is estimated to have lived during the latter period of the Cambrian explosion. Since its initial discovery, more than a hundred specimens have been recovered.

The body structure resembles that of the lancelet and it swam perhaps much like an eel. A notochord and myomeres (segmented blocks of skeletal muscles) span the entire length of the body, and are considered the defining signatures of chordate characters. Its primitive nature is indicated by the body covering, a cuticle, which is characteristic of invertebrates and some protochordates. A reinterpretation in 2024 found evidence of the gut canal, dorsal nerve cord and myomeres, and suggested that the taxon was previously interpreted upside down.

The exact phylogenetic position is unclear, though recent studies suggest that it is likely a stem-chordate with crown group traits. Previously proposed affinities include those of cephalochordata, craniata, or a stem-chordate not closely related to any extant lineage. Popularly but falsely attributed as an ancestor of all vertebrates, or the oldest fish, or the oldest ancestor of humans, it is generally viewed as a basal chordate alongside other Cambrian chordates; it is a close relative of vertebrate ancestors but it is not an ancestor itself.

==Discovery==

The fossils of &quot;Pikaia gracilens&quot; was discovered by Charles Walcott from the Burgess shale member of the Stephen formation in British Columbia, and described it in 1911. He named it after Pika Peak, a mountain in Alberta, Canada. Based on the obvious and regular segmentation of the body, as is the feature of annelids, Walcott classified it as a polychaete worm and created a new family Pikaidae for it. (Princeton palaeontologist Benjamin Franklin Howell changed the name of the family to Pikaiidae in 1962.) Walcott was aware of the limitation of his classification, as he noted: &quot;I am unable to place it within any of the families of the Polychaeta, owing to the absence of parapodia [paired protrusions on the sides of polychaete worms] on the body segments back of the fifth.&quot;

University of Cambridge palaeontologist Harry B. Whittington and his student Simon Conway Morris re-examined the Burgess Shale fauna and noted the anatomical details of &quot;Pikaia&quot; for the first time. The fossil specimens bears features of notochord and muscle blocks that are fundamental structures of chordates, and not of annelids. In 1977, Conway Morris presented a paper that indicated the possible chordate position, without further explanation. He and Whittington were convinced that the animal was obviously a chordate, as they wrote in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 1979:Finally, we find among the Burgess Shale fauna one of the earliest-known invertebrate representatives of our own conspicuous corner of the animal kingdom: the chordate phylum... The chordates are represented in the Burgess Shale by the genus &quot;Pikaia&quot; and the single species &quot;P. gracilens&quot;.Conway Morris formally placed &quot;P. gracilens&quot; among the chordates in a paper in the &quot;Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics&quot; that same year. However, he provided no structural analyses such as using microscopes to confirm the chordate features. The comparative description only earned a &quot;putative&quot; chordate status. The fossil&#x27;s chordate nature was received sceptically for several decades. Only in 2012, when detailed analysis was reported by Conway Morris and Jean-Bernard Caron, that the chordate position became generally accepted.

The fossils are found only in a restricted series of horizons in the strata exposed on Fossil Ridge, close to the Yoho National Park. From the same location, other fish-like animal fossils named &quot;Metaspriggina&quot; were discovered in 1993. Conway Morris identified the animals as another Cambrian chordate. The fossil specimens are preserved in the Smithsonian Institution and the Royal Ontario Museum.

== Description ==
&quot;Pikaia&quot; has a lancelet-like body, tapering at both ends, laterally flat and lacked a well-defined head. It measures an average of about in length. Walcott recorded the longest individuals as in length. &quot;Pikaia&quot; has a pair of large, antenna-like tentacles on its head that resembles those of invertebrates such as snails. The attachment of the tentacles makes a two-lobed structure of the head. The tentacles may be comparable to those in the present-day hagfish, a jawless chordate. It has a small circular mouth that could be used to eat small food particles in a single bite. There is a series of short appendages on either side of the underside of the head just after the mouth, and their exact nature or function is unknown. The pharynx is associated with six pairs of slits with tiny filaments that could be used for respiratory apparatus. In these ways, it differs from the modern lancelets, which have distinct pharyngeal gill slits on either sides of the pharynx and are used for filter feeding.

A major primitive structure of &quot;Pikaia&quot; is a cuticle as its body covering. Cuticle is a hard protein layer predominantly found in invertebrates such as arthropods, molluscs, echinoderms and nematodes. Unlike a typical cuticle, the cuticle of &quot;Pikaia&quot; does not have hard extracellular (exoskeleton) protection, and the entire body is essentially soft-bodied. Although primitive, &quot;Pikaia&quot; shows the essential prerequisites for vertebrates. When alive, &quot;Pikaia&quot; was a compressed, leaf-shaped animal with an expanded tail fin; the flattened body is divided into pairs of segmented muscle blocks, seen as faint vertical lines. The muscles lie on either side of a flexible structure resembling a rod that runs from the tip of the head to the tip of the tail.

&quot;Pikaia&quot; was an active and free swimmer. It likely swam by throwing its body into a series of S-shaped, zigzag curves, similar to the movement of eels; fish inherited the same swimming movement, but they generally have stiffer backbones. These adaptations may have allowed &quot;Pikaia&quot; to filter particles from the water as it swam along. &quot;Pikaia&quot; was probably a slow swimmer, since it lacked the fast-twitch fibers that are associated with rapid swimming in modern chordates.

=== Reinterpretations ===

Walcott&#x27;s original summary of the description of &quot;Pikaia&quot; reads:Body elongate, slender, and tapering at each end. It is formed of many segments that are defined by strong annular shiny lines. Head small with two large eyes and two tentacles... Back of the head the first five segments carry short parapodia that appear to be divided into two parts. The enteric canal extends from end to end without change in character... This was one of the active, free-swimming annelids that suggest the Nephthydidae of the Polychaeta.Whittington and Conway Morris were the first to realise that Walcott&#x27;s description and classification were not reliable and mostly inaccurate. They compared the body segments as described by Walcott with living animals and found that they were similar to the muscle bundles of chordates such as the living &quot;Amphioxus&quot; (&quot;Branchiostoma&quot;) as well as fishes, and not to superficial segments of annelids. They pictured that the muscles would be essential for swimming in water in wriggling motions. The enteric canal as observed by Walcott was not an ordinary digestive tract, it runs along with a stiff rod that resembles a notochord. They reported in 1979: &quot;Although &quot;Pikaia&quot; differs from &quot;Amphioxus&quot;, in several important respects, the conclusion is that it is not a worm but a chordate appears inescapable.&quot;

Conway Morris was convinced that the longitudinal rod was a notochord and the segments were muscle blocks that he concluded that &quot;Pikaia&quot; &quot;is a primitive chordate rather than a polychaete. The earliest fish scales are Upper Cambrian, and &quot;Pikaia&quot; may not be far removed from the ancestral fish.&quot; In 1982, he added further description in his &quot;Atlas of the Burgess Shale&quot; that &quot;Pikaia&quot; had one or more fins, but did not specify where they were present.

&quot;Pikaia&quot; was not popularly known as a chordate fossil or as an ancient chordate until 1989. That year, Harvard University palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould wrote in his book &quot;Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History&quot;: &quot;&quot;Pikaia&quot; is not an annelid worm. It is a chordate, a member of our own phylum—in fact, the first recorded member of our immediate ancestry.&quot; From this remark &quot;Pikaia&quot; became generally recognised as a chordate and ancestor of vertebrates.

In 1993, Conway Morris came up with another possible chordate feature. He identified structures that looked like gill slits but gave a cautious remark: &quot;[They] may have been present, but are hard to identify with certainty in the compressed material available. The tiny pores on the side of the pharynx are normally gill slits in living chordates. He also noticed that &quot;Pikaia&quot; is similar to &quot;Amphioxus&quot; in most general aspects, with major difference in its notochord not reaching the anterior end.

Not all palaeontologists were convinced of the chordate designation without better analysis. In 2001, Nicholas D. Holland from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Junyuan Chen from the Chinese Academy of Sciences criticised the presentation in &quot;Wonderful Life&quot;, saying that the &quot;reinterpretation [of &quot;Pikaia&quot; as a chordate] became almost universally accepted after its unqualified and forceful endorsement by Gould&quot;; concluding that &quot;the cephalochordate affinity of &quot;Pikaia&quot; is at best only weakly indicated by the characters visible in fossils discovered so far.&quot; In 2010, an international team of palaeontologists argued that &quot;Pikaia&quot; has sufficiently invertebrate characters, and that it mostly look like a much younger extinct animal, the Tully monster (&quot;Tullimonstrum gregarium&quot;)&quot;,&quot; which is still debated as either an invertebrate or a chordate.

Another component of &quot;Pikaia&quot; fossils that constrains the animal to be accepted as a chordate is its distinct invertebrate character; its preservational mode suggests that it had cuticle. The cuticle as a body covering is uncharacteristic of the vertebrates, but is a dominant feature of invertebrates. The presence of earlier chordates among the Chengjiang, including &quot;Haikouichthys&quot; and &quot;Myllokunmingia&quot;, appears to show that cuticle is not necessary for preservation, overruling the taphonomic argument, but the presence of tentacles remains intriguing, and the organism cannot be assigned conclusively, even to the vertebrate stem group. Its anatomy closely resembles the modern creature &quot;Branchiostoma&quot;.

A fossil species &quot;Myoscolex ateles&quot;, discovered in 1979 from Cambrian Emu Bay shale of Kangaroo Island in South Australia, had been debated as among the oldest annelids, or at least other invertebrate groups. Polish palaeontologist Jerzy Dzik in his formal description in 2003 notes that it &quot;closely resembles the slightly geologically younger &quot;Pikaia&quot;&quot; in having smooth cuticle as well as muscular segmentation, and projections on its backside (ventral chaetae) that look like &quot;Pikaia&quot;&#x27;s tentacles. He concluded:In fact, there is little evidence for chordate affinities of &quot;Pikaia&quot;. Its relationship with &quot;Myoscolex&quot; [as annelid in his proposition] appears a much better solution. Both were initially identified as polychaetes and this line of inference perhaps deserves confrontation with more recent evidence than that available to the authors who proposed these genera. 

=== Comprehensive description ===
The first comprehensive description of &quot;Pikaia&quot; was published by Conway Morris and Jean-Bernard Caron in the May 2012 issue of &quot;Biological Reviews&quot;. The anatomical examination and interpretation based on 114 fossil specimens confirm the classification as a chordate. According to the new assessment, &quot;Pikaia&quot; fossils indicate important features that define the animal as a primitive chordate. All &quot;Pikaia&quot; fossils are in the range of in length, with an average of . Having a laterally compressed (taller than wide) and fusiform (tapering at both ends) body, the exact width and height are variable, and normally its height is twice that of its width throughout it body.

The head is bilaterally symmetrical with a distinct pair of tentacles. Due to its small size, only about 1 mm in diameter, the structural details are indistinguishable. Some specimens show a darker central line on the tentacles which may represent a nervous fibre; thus making the tentacles as sensory feelers. A mouth is marked by a small opening at the anterior end of the gut towards the underside of the head. There are no jaws and teeth. Walcott had mentioned the presence of two large eyes, but no specimens, including Walcott&#x27;s original collection, show any evidence of eyes.

One of the most unusual body parts is a series of appendages just posterior to the tentacles. Walcott had called the appendages parapodia, as a kind of body protrusions that aid locomotion in snails, and mentioned five parapodia in each individual. He was even puzzled by the absence on the major part of the body, with other specimens having up to nine such appendages that could not be parapodia. These external appendages were reinterpreted as gills in a 2024 study. Fins are present as an expansion of the body on the dorsal and ventral sides. They are not present in many specimens indicating that they are delicate membranes and were lost during fossilisation. However, the 2024 study suggested that &quot;Pikaia&quot; was previously interpreted upside down, indicating that the &#x27;dorsal and ventral&#x27; sides of &quot;Pikiaia&quot; were actually inverted.

The backside of &quot;Pikaia&quot; fossils show a hollow tubular structure that extends throughout most of the body length, but not the anterior region. It is easily noticeable as a highly light-reflective portion and is known as the dorsal organ. Once described as the notochord, its nature is not yet fully resolved and could be a storage organ. The true notochord, along with a nerve cord, is a fine lateral line that runs just beneath the thick dorsal organ. A 2024 study instead found evidence of the gut canal, dorsal nerve cord and myomeres from the specimens, providing more evidence with diagnostic features that &quot;Pikaia&quot; is a chordate.

The main chordate character is a series of myomeres that extends from the anterior to the posterior region. On average, there are 100 such myomeres in each individual. The muscle segments are not simply &quot;annular shiny lines&quot; as Walcott described, but are in concentric bends in the form of V-shaped chevron. The myomeres at the anterior end as simpler in appearance and show circular arrangement. Conway Morris and Caron concluded:Whilst the possibility that &quot;Pikaia&quot; is simply convergent on the chordates cannot be dismissed, we prefer to build a scenario that regards &quot;Pikaia&quot; as the most stem-ward of the chordates with links to the phylogenetically controversial yunnanozoans. This hypothesis has implications for the evolution of the myomeres, notochord and gills.

==Evolutionary importance==
Much debate on whether &quot;Pikaia&quot; is a vertebrate ancestor, its worm-like appearance notwithstanding, exists in scientific circles. It looks like a worm that has been flattened sideways (lateral compression). The fossils compressed within the Burgess Shale show chordate features such as traces of an elongate notochord, dorsal nerve cord, and blocks of muscles (myotomes) down either side of the body – all critical features for the evolution of the vertebrates.

The notochord, a flexible rod-like structure that runs along the back of the animal, lengthens and stiffens the body so that it can be flexed from side to side by the muscle blocks for swimming. In the fish and all subsequent vertebrates, the notochord forms the backbone (or vertebral column). The backbone strengthens the body, supports strut-like limbs, and protects the vital dorsal nerve cord, while at the same time allowing the body to bend.

A &quot;Pikaia&quot; lookalike, the lancelet &quot;Branchiostoma&quot;, still exists today. With a notochord and paired muscle blocks, the lancelet and &quot;Pikaia&quot; belong to the chordate group of animals from which the vertebrates descended. Molecular studies have refuted earlier hypotheses that lancelets might be the closest living relative to the vertebrates, instead favoring tunicates in this position; other extant and fossil groups, such as acorn worms and graptolites, are more primitive.

The presence of cuticle, one of the principal characters of higher invertebrates, in &quot;Pikaia&quot; can be understood from the evolutionary trends. A Cambrian invertebrate, &quot;Myoscolex ateles&quot; was described to be structurally similar to &quot;Pikaia&quot; particularly in having smooth cuticle as well as muscular segmentation, and projections on its backside (ventral chaetae) that look like &quot;Pikaia&quot;&#x27;s tentacles. Although chordates normally lack the cuticle, a type of cuticle is present in some cephalochordates, indicating that primitive characters are retained in lower chordates.

Subsequently, Mallatt and Holland reconsidered Conway Morris and Caron&#x27;s description, and concluded that many of the newly recognized characters are unique, already-divergent specializations that would not be helpful for establishing &quot;Pikaia&quot; as a basal chordate.

=== Development of the head ===
The first sign of head development, cephalization, is seen in chordates such as &quot;Pikaia&quot; and &quot;Branchiostoma&quot;. It is thought that development of a head structure resulted from a long body shape, a swimming habit, and a mouth at the end that came into contact with the environment first, as the animal swam forward. The search for food required ways of continually testing what lay ahead so it is thought that anatomical structures for seeing, feeling, and smelling developed around the mouth. The information these structures gathered was processed by a swelling of the nerve cord (&quot;efflorescence&quot;) – the precursor of the brain. Altogether, these front-end structures formed the rather indistinct heads of these chordates during the Cambrian period.

=== Evolutionary interpretation ===
Once thought to be closely related to the ancestor of all vertebrates, &quot;Pikaia&quot; has received particular attention among the multitude of animal fossils found in the famous Burgess Shale and other Cambrian fauna. In 1979, Whittington and Conway Morris first explained the evolutionary importance of &quot;Pikaia&quot;. Realising the fossil to be that of a chordate in the Cambrian rocks, chordates could have originated much earlier than expected, as they commented: &quot;The superb preservation of this Middle Cambrian organism [&quot;Pikaia&quot;] makes it a landmark history of the phylum [Chordata] to which all vertebrates, including man, belong.&quot; It is for this knowledge Pikaia as an old chordate that it is often misleadingly and falsely attributed to as an ancestor of all vertebrates, or the oldest fish, or the oldest ancestor of humans.

Before Pikaia and other Cambrian chordates were fully appreciated, it was generally believed that the first chordates appeared much later, such as in Ordovician (484–443 mya). The establishment of Cambrian chordates, according to Stephen Jay Gould, prompted &quot;revised views of evolution, ecology and development,&quot; and remarked: &quot;So much for chordate uniqueness marked by slightly later evolution.&quot; However, Gould did not believe that &quot;Pikaia&quot; itself was unique as an early chordate or that it was &quot;the actual ancestor of vertebrates;&quot; he presumed that there could be undiscovered fossils that are more closely linked to vertebrate ancestry.

=== Gould&#x27;s interpretation and evolutionary contingency ===
Gould, in his presidential address of the Paleontological Society on 27 October 1988, cited &quot;Pikaia&quot; to explain the trends of evolutionary changes:
Wind back life&#x27;s tape to the Burgess (first erasing what actually came after), let it play again, and this time a quite different cast may emerge. If the cast lacked &quot;Pikaia&quot;, the first chordate, we might not be here—and the world would be no worse... Let us thank our lucky stars for the survival of &quot;Pikaia&quot;.
He elaborated the same idea in &quot;An epilogue on &quot;Pikaia&quot;&quot; in his book &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; &quot;to save the best for the last,&quot; in which he made a statement:&quot;Pikaia&quot; is the missing and final link in our story of contingency—the direct connection between Burgess decimation and eventual human evolution... Wind the tape of life back to Burgess times, and let it play again. If &quot;Pikaia&quot; does not survive in the replay, we are wiped out of future history—all of us, from shark to robin to orangutan...

And so, if you wish to ask the question of the age—why do humans exist?—a major part of the answer, touching those aspects of the issue that science can treat at all, must be: because &quot;Pikaia&quot; survived the Burgess decimation.This interpretation that the chances of evolutionary products are unpredictable is known as evolutionary contingency. Gould, from this statement, is regarded as &quot;the most famous proponent&quot; of the concept. His idea has inspired many research involving evolutionary contingency from palaeontology to molecular biology. He used &quot;Pikaia&quot; among the Cambrian animals as an epitome of contingent event in the entire evolution of life; if &quot;Pikaia&quot; had not existed, the rest of chordate animals might not have evolved, thus completely changing the diversity of life as we know. According to him, contingency is a major factor that drives large-scale evolution (macroevolution) and dictates that evolution has no inevitable destiny or outcome. However, as Gould explained, &quot;The bad news is that we can&#x27;t possibly perform the experiment.&quot;

== Ecology ==
&quot;Pikaia&quot; is suggested to have been an active swimming organism that swam close to the seafloor (nektobenthic) using side to side undulations of its flattened posterior for propulsion. The anterior appendages are unlikely to have been used in feeding, and may have had a respiratory function. &quot;Pikaia&quot; is suggested to have fed on small particles of organic matter.

<text>Ranger 6 was a lunar probe in the NASA Ranger program, a series of robotic spacecraft of the early and mid-1960s to obtain close-up images of the Moon&#x27;s surface. It was launched on January 30, 1964 and was designed to transmit high-resolution photographs of the lunar terrain during the final minutes of flight until impacting the surface. The spacecraft carried six television vidicon cameras—two wide-angle (channel F, cameras A and B) and four narrow-angle (channel P)—to accomplish these objectives. The cameras were arranged in two separate chains, or channels, each self-contained with separate power supplies, timers, and transmitters so as to afford the greatest reliability and probability of obtaining high-quality television pictures. No other experiments were carried on the spacecraft. Due to a failure of the camera system, no images were returned.

==Spacecraft design==

Rangers 6, 7, 8, and 9 were called Block 3 versions of the Ranger spacecraft. The spacecraft consisted of a hexagonal aluminum frame base 1.5m across on which was mounted the propulsion and power units, topped by a truncated conical tower that held the TV cameras. Two solar panel wings, each 739mm wide by 1537mm long, extended from opposite edges of the base with a full span of 4.6m, and a pointable high-gain dish antenna was hinge mounted at one of the corners of the base away from the solar panels. A cylindrical quasi omnidirectional antenna was seated on top of the conical tower. The overall height of the spacecraft was 3.6m.

Propulsion for the mid-course trajectory correction was provided by a 224N thrust monopropellant hydrazine engine with four jet-vane vector control. Orientation and attitude control about three axes were enabled by twelve nitrogen gas jets coupled to a system of three gyros, four primary Sun sensors, two secondary Sun sensors, and an Earth sensor. Power was supplied by 9,792 silicon solar cells contained in the two solar panels, giving a total array area of 2.3 square meters and producing 200W. Two 1200 watt-hour AgZnO batteries rated at 26.5V with a capacity for 9 hours of operation provided power to each of the separate communication/TV camera chains. Two 1000 watt-hour AgZnO batteries stored power for spacecraft operations.

Communications were through the quasi omnidirectional low-gain antenna and the parabolic high-gain antenna. Transmitters aboard the spacecraft included a 60W TV channel F at 959.52MHz, a 60W TV channel P at 960.05MHz, and a 3W transponder channel 8 at 960.58MHz. The telecommunications equipment converted the composite video signal from the camera transmitters into an RF signal for subsequent transmission through the spacecraft high-gain antenna. Sufficient video bandwidth was provided to allow for rapid framing sequences of both narrow- and wide-angle television pictures.

==Mission profile==

The Cuban Missile Crisis had momentarily diverted attention from the failure of Ranger 5, but that mission forced a wholesale review of the entire Ranger program. Numerous theories were put forward about the cause of the failures, including poor management at JPL, overly-ambitious spacecraft designs that were unworkable and unreliable with contemporary technology, and some lesser reasons such as heat sterilization of the probes.

NASA established a Ranger Board of Inquiry on October 29, 1962, headed by Albert J. Kelley, with the mission of establishing by November 30 the reasons for the continued program failures. The board&#x27;s findings included the verdict that the Ranger design was &quot;more complicated than necessary&quot; for a lunar mission and also required a very high degree of engineering and workmanship, neither of which were being delivered. They also concluded that heat sterilization was damaging to the delicate spacecraft systems and should be abandoned at once. They also found that JPL&#x27;s handling of the program was poor, the spacecraft lacked redundant systems in the event of a malfunction, NASA&#x27;s deep-space tracking network crews were not trained adequately and had deficiencies in their equipment, and finally, the Atlas-Agena booster&#x27;s reliability was poor, having malfunctioned on eight Air Force and NASA launches as November 1962 ended. If the Thor-Agena was also counted in, there had been a total of nine times that an Agena B stage had malfunctioned in flight.

The board&#x27;s recommendations included improving the management of projects, abandoning heat sterilization and testing of components designed for future planetary missions on Ranger, outsourcing assembly of the probes to a subcontractor, and excluding JPL from involvement in procurement and launching of the Atlas-Agena. Moreover, it suggested that NASA needed to improve their prelaunch testing and preparation of launch vehicles.

The Block III spacecraft would be stripped down to a minimum of instrumentation with the eight scientific instruments on Rangers 3-5 removed so that more space could be devoted to redundant systems hardware. This caused some protests from the scientific community that the gamma-ray and other measurements were far more valuable than simply returning photography of the Moon. Jet Propulsion Laboratory began more thorough testing of Ranger components and the second review board was put to work evaluating the reliability of the Atlas-Agena.

The booster problems would prove a particularly vexing one to solve because the U.S. Air Force, not NASA, was in charge of Atlas-Agena. Although NASA had hoped to launch planetary probes on Centaur, which was entirely under their control, that program was delayed by serious technical issues and would not be flight-ready for a long time. Having to share the booster with the U.S. Air Force and its Department of Defense missions on the West Coast created repeated mixups, delays, and technical problems. Therefore, it was recommended that NASA be given complete oversight in the procurement and launch of Atlas-Agena without the Air Force&#x27;s involvement.

One of the important parts of the Ranger program was monitoring all Atlas and Thor-Agena launches to check for failures that could directly affect it. This job had been assigned to the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, but was instead moved to the Lewis Research Center (LRC) in Cleveland, Ohio. LRC sent additional personnel to the Convair assembly plant in San Diego to monitor the construction of Atlas vehicles.

The review board focused on the malfunctions plaguing Atlas-Agena, in particular, the General Electric guidance system, both the Mod III-G variant used on East Coast Atlas Agenas and the Mod II-A used on West Coast vehicles, which had malfunctioned repeatedly. They recommended putting forward more detailed and stringent requirements for testing Atlas vehicles and making sure the guidance package could withstand in-flight vibration levels along with improved fabrication of wiring harnesses. Also, it was recommended that Convair establish one standardized booster configuration for all U.S. Air Force and NASA launches instead of custom modifications for each mission, replacing hardware with known design flaws with better substitutes, and improved testing of everything. Since the Air Force was in charge of Atlas-Agena, it followed that all these changes required their approval.

Finally, NASA for the first time would be given complete oversight of all its space launches. Air Force involvement in procuring, preparing, and flying launch vehicles, as well as drafting postflight mission reports for NASA missions, was to end, a step that would greatly streamline and improve program efficiency.

Problems continued, this time with getting the TV cameras for Ranger 6 in working order. The camera tubes, supplied by Radio Corporation of America, were of variable quality and it took some time to find one that matched JPL&#x27;s standards.

During testing of Atlas guidance systems at General Electric, it was found that gold coating on diodes was flaking off and causing electrical shorts. Even worse, Ranger 6 had hundreds of the same diodes. This problem had easily eluded testing; moreover, ground tests could not simulate a &quot;zero gravity&quot; environment in space where the gold flakes would float around and form a short between the legs of the diode. In the end, there was no choice except to replace every one of the several hundred diodes inside Ranger 6&#x27;s circuitry.

In April 1963, the United States Congress also decided to cut funding to the Ranger program by nearly 50% on the grounds that &quot;no success had been achieved with any of the missions to date&quot;. This meant that plans for Ranger probes up to 13 were cancelled. Only Rangers 6-9 would be flown and they would carry little more than a TV camera.

One of the Ranger program&#x27;s goals was looking for potential landing sites for crewed lunar missions. At this point, it was not clear exactly what the Moon&#x27;s surface was like and widespread fears existed of there being bottomless quicksand that would swallow up spacecraft and astronauts. Since the basic design of the Apollo lunar module had already been finalized by 1963, landing on the Moon would only &quot;confirm or deny that design&quot;. JPL decided to go for an impact point near the lunar equator, in the Sea of Tranquility, partially because it was considered a prime Apollo landing spot, and also because the target had to match lighting conditions during the time of launch in January–February.

Ranger 6 and its launch vehicle (Atlas 199D and Agena 6008) arrived at Cape Canaveral in mid-December and, with the nation still mourning President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination the previous month, began preflight tests.

Liftoff took place at 10:49 AM EST on January 30, 1964. The Atlas lifted smoothly into an overcast sky and disappeared from view. All went well during the boost phase and the launch vehicle&#x27;s performance was excellent, indicating the hard-fought effort to improve booster reliability.

Shortly after Atlas BECO and staging, an ominous development occurred when telemetry indicated that the telemetry for the TV camera on Ranger 6 had turned itself on and then back off again 67 seconds later. Telemetry data showed everything else appears to function normally and tensions at JPL eased. The Agena placed the probe into a parking orbit and then fired for translunar injection 25 minutes after launch. After separation of Ranger 6, the solar panels and high-gain antenna were extended and all appeared normal. The launch vehicle had placed the probe on an accurate enough flight path that only a short midcourse correction burn would be required. However, the activation of the TV camera telemetry during launch remained a cause for concern. JPL technicians wanted to turn the camera on to verify its operability, however, they were running the risk of not being able to turn it off again if an electrical short had indeed occurred somewhere. Since the camera had its own batteries and did not use the probe&#x27;s main power bus, they would be depleted before it could get to the Moon and eliminate any chance of returning pictures. They decided that it was not worth compromising the mission and the camera would not be touched until descent to the Moon began.

Early on the morning of January 31, the command was sent to fire the midcourse correction engine, which performed flawlessly and set the probe on an impact course with the Sea of Tranquility. On February 2, JPL technicians prepared for the final phase of the mission. Ranger 6 began its descent and trajectory calculations determined that impact would occur close to the intended area. With the probe&#x27;s angle suitable for taking images, the order was given to turn on the camera with 13 minutes and 10 seconds until impact. After an initial warm-up phase, the command to power them on was sent. However, no imagery or any sign of camera operation appeared. Two more commands were sent to turn on the camera, but still, nothing happened even though all other systems continued to operate normally. At 01:24 AM, impact with the Moon occurred and telemetry transmission from Ranger 6 ceased. The mission was over and for the 12th time in a row, a U.S. attempt to send a probe to the Moon had malfunctioned. Even worse, it had occurred one week before NASA officials were planning to announce to Congress their projected US$5.3 billion budget for FY 1965, a good deal of it related to crewed and uncrewed lunar missions. NASA attempted to put a positive spin on the mission by noting that, aside from the cameras, Ranger 6 and its Atlas-Agena booster had both functioned &quot;extremely well&quot;.

Ranger 6 was launched into an Earth parking orbit and injected on a lunar trajectory by a second Agena burn. The midcourse trajectory correction was accomplished early in the flight by ground control. On February 2, 1964, 65.5 hours after launch, Ranger 6 impacted the Moon on the eastern edge of &quot;Mare Tranquillitatis&quot; (Sea of Tranquility in English). The orientation of the spacecraft to the surface during descent was correct, but no video signal was received and no camera data obtained. A review board determined the most likely cause of failure was due to an arc-over in the TV power system when it inadvertently turned on for 67 seconds approximately 2 minutes after launch during the period of booster-engine separation.

This fourth American attempt at lunar impact was the closest success. The spacecraft, the first Block III type vehicle with a suite of six TV cameras, was sterilized to avoid contaminating the lunar surface. The series would also serve as a test bed for future interplanetary spacecraft by deploying systems (such as solar panels) that could be used for more ambitious missions. The Block III spacecraft carried a 173-kilogram TV unit (replacing the impact capsule carried on the Block II Ranger spacecraft). The six cameras included two full-scan and four partial-scan cameras. Ranger 6 flew to the Moon successfully and impacted precisely on schedule at 09:24:32 GMT on February 2. Unfortunately, the power supply for the TV camera package had short-circuited three days previously during Atlas booster separation and left the system inoperable. The cameras were to have transmitted high-resolution photos of the lunar approach from 1448 kilometers to 6.4 kilometers range in support of Project Apollo. Impact coordinates were 9°24&#x27; north latitude and 21°30&#x27; east longitude.

<doc id="884813" wikidata="Q406815" url="?curid=884813" title="U.S. Route 8">
<text>U.S. Highway 8 (US 8) is a United States Numbered Highway that runs primarily east–west for , mostly within the state of Wisconsin. It connects Interstate 35 (I-35) in Forest Lake, Minnesota, to US 2 at Norway, Michigan. Except for the short freeway segment near Forest Lake, a section near the St. Croix River bridge, the interchange with US 51, and a stretch west of Rhinelander, Wisconsin, it is mostly an undivided surface road. As a state highway in the three states, US 8 is maintained by the Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan departments of transportation (MnDOT, WisDOT, and MDOT, respectively).

The highway was originally commissioned on November 11, 1926, with the rest of the original U.S. Highway System. At the time, it ran between Forest Lake, Minnesota, and Pembine, Wisconsin, with a planned continuation to Powers, Michigan. Several changes have been made to the routing of the highway since then. The western end was extended south to Minneapolis before it was truncated back to Forest Lake. Other changes on the east end have moved that terminus from the originally planned end location at Powers to the current location in Norway. Internal WisDOT and MDOT map files at various times have shown plans to reroute the highway to connect to the original planned 1926 terminus. US 8&#x27;s course through the three states has also been shifted to follow different alignments over the years.

WisDOT built a bypass around the city of Rhinelander in the 1990s and created a business loop along the old highway through the town. This loop was a locally maintained route through the central business district in Rhinelander. The signage for the loop was removed in 2005.

== Route description ==

=== Forest Lake to St. Croix Falls ===
US 8 begins at an interchange with I-35 in Forest Lake. This interchange is incomplete: traffic can only access US 8 directly from northbound I-35, and westbound traffic on US 8 merges onto southbound I-35. The first segment of roadway to Forest Lake is a freeway, with an interchange at US 61. East of this junction, the highway follows Lake Boulevard North around Forest Lake and continues northeasterly through the community to cross the Washington–Chisago county line. The highway continues to the northeast along farmland and the shore of Green Lake to Chisago City, where it meets up with County State-Aid Highway 22 (CSAH 22). US 8 follows Lake Boulevard through Chisago City along the isthmus between the larger Chisago Lake and the smaller Wallmark Lake on the eastern side of town. The highway turns along a more easterly path in Lindström between North and South Lindström lakes. East of those lakes, US 8 crosses into the town of Center City.

In Center City, US 8 runs between North and South Center lakes, curving around the north shore of South Center Lake. On the eastern edge of town, it turns due east for several miles and runs through Shafer. US 8 merges with Minnesota State Highway 95 (MN 95) at a roundabout about southwest of Taylors Falls. The two highways concurrently turn northeast along the St. Croix River, entering town. At this point, MN 95 continues north along the river while US 8 turns east to cross the St. Croix River, exiting the state of Minnesota into Wisconsin.
Legally, the Minnesota section of US 8 is defined as Constitutional Route 46 and Legislative Route 98 in the Minnesota Statutes §§ and ; the roadway is not marked with those numbers. The section of US 8 in Chisago County was officially designated the Moberg Trail in 1990.

=== St. Croix Falls to Rhinelander ===
US 8 enters Polk County at St. Croix Falls as a multilane roadway. It joins State Trunk Highway 35 (WIS 35) at a diamond interchange located approximately from the state line. The two highways run concurrently for before WIS 35 turns off to the north at a location in the Town of St. Croix Falls west of Deer Lake. US 8 continues eastward through forest lands, and WIS 46 joins from the north for a concurrency before splitting off to the south. Continuing eastward, US 8 passes through Range and crosses into Barron County at Turtle Lake. US 63 merges from the south near Turtle Lake and departs to the north in the downtown area. The roadway passes through Poskin and intersects WIS 25 in Barron. East of Barron, US 8 meets US 53 at a mixed diamond/cloverleaf interchange and turns north into Cameron, then turns east in downtown to leave the latter community. After a straightaway, the highway crosses into Rusk County, and then it continues due east for an additional before turning northeast and passing through Weyerhaeuser. Continuing northeasterly, the roadway crosses WIS 40 in Bruce. East of town, the highway continues through rural Rusk County, and US 8 meets WIS 27 in downtown Ladysmith.
Upon leaving Ladysmith, US 8 passes through the communities of Tony, Glen Flora, Ingram (where it meets the northern terminus of WIS 73) and Hawkins on its way out of Rusk County. In Price County, US 8 passes through Kennan and Catawba. WIS 111 terminates at its south end on US 8 just east of Catawba. US 8 meets WIS 13 at a diamond interchange northwest of Prentice and passes north of the city. The highway passes through Brantwood and enters Lincoln County at Clifford. Further east, US 8 crosses Tripoli and McCord and runs north of Tomahawk as it passes through the Lake Nokomis area. US 51 crosses US 8 northeast of Tomahawk. US 8 turns northeast into Oneida County and onto a forested twisting northeasterly alignment. For much of this segment the highway follows the Soo Line Railroad. The highway passes through Woodboro and passes several lakes. A few miles before Rhinelander, the highway expands to a divided highway into Rhinelander. During this stretch, the highway has an exempt railroad crossing with only crossbucks. It merges with WIS 47 at a roundabout on the southwest side of Rhinelander. WIS 17 north joins the highways to the southeast, creating a wrong-way concurrency with WIS 47; along this section of highway, eastbound US 8 is also southbound WIS 47 and northbound WIS 17 and vice versa. WIS 17 turns to the north southeast of there, and US 8 and WIS 47 head eastbound out of the Rhinelander area.

=== Rhinelander to Norway ===
US 8 intersects US 45 south in Monico, and WIS 47 splits from US 8 to follow US 45 south. Immediately east of the same intersection, US 45 north follows US 8 for before splitting to the north. US 8 enters Forest County east of Monico. into the county, the highway merges with WIS 32 from the north in Crandon and the two highways head east to Laona where US 8 turns north and WIS 32 turns south. US 8 turns east again at Cavour and passes through the community of Armstrong Creek from the Marinette County line. The highway passes through Goodman and Dunbar as it meanders through the county and joins US 141 at Pembine. The two routes split further north near Niagara; after the split, US 8 heads east. The highway takes a northward turn and heads across the Menominee River into Michigan near Pier&#x27;s Gorge Park.
Entering Michigan south of Norway at the Menominee River crossing in Norway Township, US 8 proceeds north into the city where it ends at US 2. US 8 in Michigan is long; in this segment, the road passes by the Dickinson County fairgrounds and Norway Speedway.

== History ==

=== 20th century ===
Starting in 1918, the Wisconsin Highway Commission erected highway numbers along state-maintained roadways. The highway across the state from St. Croix Falls to Armstrong Creek was numbered WIS 14 at that time. The remainder of what is now US 8 was unnumbered secondary highways, and WIS 14 continued north of Armstrong Creek to Florence. When Michigan numbered its highway system the following year, the future US 8 was not included in the system. In Minnesota, US 8 would follow what was Constitutional Route 46, which was designated in a state constitutional amendment adopted on November 2, 1920; that roadway originally ran between Forest Lake and Chisago City through Wyoming.
The first changes to the routings of the predecessor highways were made by Wisconsin by 1920. A series of curves were added between Turtle Lake and Barron adding &quot;stair steps&quot; to the routing while similar jogs were removed near Cameron, Weyerhauser, Hawkins and Prentice. WIS 14 was rerouted between Rhinelander and Pelican Lake to run via Monico, and WIS 38 (the future US 141) was extended northward from Wausaukee to terminate at the state line near Niagara. The realignment between Rhinelander and Pelican Lake was shown as reversed by 1922. By 1925, the highway in that area was again rerouted to run directly from Rhinelander to Monico, but instead of turning south to Pelican Lake, it was run directly to Crandon. That same year, WIS 14 was extended eastward from Armstrong Creek to Pembine and northward to Niagara. The north–south section, previously numbered WIS 38, was also redesignated as part of WIS 57.

US 8 was created with the beginnings of the United States Numbered Highway System on November 26, 1926. The highway was originally shown on maps running between Forest Lake, Minnesota and Powers, Michigan. At the time, its planned routing was not previously designated as part of the State Trunkline Highway System in Michigan. The trunkline connection from Quinnesec south into Wisconsin was part of M-57, which met WIS 57 at the state line. US 8 ended at WIS 57 in Pembine at the time, with no connection into Michigan shown on official maps. A map by the American Automobile Association does show the highway continuing east through Faithorn and Hermansville in Michigan to end at US 2. The Wisconsin Highway Commission previously indicated an unnumbered state highway on their 1925 state map that connected Pembine with the Menominee River near Hermansville. A later extension in 1927 moved US 8 to run along US 141, which had replaced WIS 57 and M-57, ending in Quinnesec at US 2. By the next year, the highway was shifted to end in Norway, utilizing a separate crossing of the Menominee River to enter Michigan.

In 1931, US 8 was extended south from Forest Lake into downtown Minneapolis. West of the Rhinelander area, US 8 and US 51 overlapped for about as US 8 jogged northward along US 51. This concurrency was altered in 1934, and two years later the short east–west section of US 8/US 51 was removed when changes to US 51&#x27;s routing were finished in the area. A jog in the routing near Almena was removed in 1937 when Wisconsin rerouted the highway to a more direct alignment in the area.

The last segment of US 8 in Wisconsin was paved in 1937 between Cavour and Armstrong Creek; the highway in Minnesota was paved in its entirety by 1940. Near Hawkins, a pair of sharp curves near the Rusk–Price county line were removed as the State Highway Commission realigned the highway to follow a straighter course. The US 8/US 51 concurrency was altered the next year to a shorter overlap running southward near Heafford Junction. The former routing of US 8 was redesignated County Trunk Highway K (CTH-K) after it was transferred back to county control.

Starting around the year 1955, US 8 was moved to a more direct routing between Forest Lake and Chisago City; US 8 replaced MN 98 along Legislative Route 98. The former routing between Wyoming and Chisago City along Constitutional Route 46 was then redesignated MN 98 until it was decommissioned in the late 1990s.

As late as 1959, the Michigan State Highway Department still had plans to build the section of US 8 west of Hermansville to the Menominee River. The control section atlas published on January 1, 1959, showed this segment of highway on the Menominee County map, complete with a control section number. The section of highway is shown as &quot;proposed&quot; or &quot;under construction&quot;. However, a new bridge was built over the Menominee River to carry the highway across the Michigan–Wisconsin state line near Norway in 1966. WisDOT still shows the section of highway needed in their state to extend US 8 to the original eastern terminus in Michigan on internal maps. The December 31, 2004, edition of their &quot;Official State Trunk Highway System Maps&quot; shows this section as a &quot;mapped corridor&quot;.

In the late 1970s, with ongoing construction and completion of the I-35W freeway in Minnesota, US 8 was routed along I-35W; US 8 was truncated again by 1981 to its current terminus in Forest Lake. The section in New Brighton is currently known as Old Highway 8.

WisDOT built a bypass of the city of Rhinelander during the early 1990s; the new highway was constructed south of town as a new two-lane highway that opened to traffic by 1993. The former route through downtown Rhinelander and near Clear and George lakes was redesignated as Business US 8 (Bus. US 8).

=== 21st century ===

In 2002, US 8 was widened from two lanes to four lanes with a grass median between North Rifle Road and WIS 47 near Rhinelander, Wisconsin. At the time, officials with WisDOT had plans to extend the four-lane divided highway as far west as US 51 near Tomahawk. Problems related to wetlands in the construction area and bad weather pushed completion of the project back almost a year. Contractors had to install metal sheeting to stabilize the marshy ground. Originally scheduled to end in late 2002, the project did not finish until August 2003. The delays and additional work increased the price tag of the project from the original $4.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) to $6.0 million (equivalent to $ in ). A section of the project was only designed for speeds for safety reasons. The design also allowed planners to limit the amount of land needed for the expansion.

Bill and Jerri Osberg sued the state and seven other parties in April 2003 over runoff from the construction, claiming that it killed hundreds of trees and polluted ponds on their property. Later investigation uncovered damage to wildlife habitat in the Wisconsin River. Included in the original lawsuit were six individual WisDOT employees, the primary contractor and a local pet supply company. The court of appeals partially upheld a ruling by the district court dismissing the employees and the contractor from the lawsuit in March 2006. The pet supply company was reinstated in the case by the appeals court. The couple settled their claims, and the state pursued the matter against Pagel Construction in a related lawsuit. WisDOT alleged that the contractor did not follow proper erosion controls and failed to remediate the erosion damage to the Osbergs&#x27; property. The state wanted the construction company to forfeit their $70,000 retainer (equivalent to $ in ) and pay damages of $150,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Pagel Construction faulted WisDOT&#x27;s erosion control plan and said that the state&#x27;s engineers controlled the project and was seeking the return of its retainer. In September 2007, a jury ruled in favor of Pagel Construction and awarded them $70,898.13 in damages (equivalent to $ in ).

== Future ==
WisDOT has completed the environmental studies of bypasses of Barron and Cameron in Barron County. These bypasses would form a continuous expressway through the area. No funding has been identified to complete the projects. The entire length of US 8 in the state has been classified as a North Country Corridor in the Connections 2030 Plan by the department. This designation marks the highway as a priority in &quot;continued safety, enhanced mobility and efficiency&quot; as well as &quot;modernization to correct outdated infrastructure design&quot;.

== Major intersections ==














== Business route ==

Business U.S. Highway 8 (Bus. US 8) in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, was a locally maintained business loop highway routing through the central business district of the city. The route was designated when US 8 was shifted to a bypass of downtown in 1992. The former routing of US 8 through the area was designated as a business loop, and it was turned over to the city and county for maintenance. The local authorities erected signs along this route to designate it as a business loop of the main highway south of town. The signs along the road were scheduled to be removed on July 1, 2005, when the business loop was to be redesignated CTH-P.

Before the signage was removed, Bus. US 8 started at the western junction of US 8 and WIS 47. The business loop ran east from this intersection along Kemp Street, crossing the Wisconsin River north of the convergence with the Pelican River. The loop jogged north along Oneida Street for three blocks and turned east again on Lincoln Street. East of town, Bus. US 8 intersected WIS 17 and turned to the southeast. Outside of town, the business loop ran through wooded terrain and turned south near Clear Lake. Near the larger George Lake, the roadway curved back east along the lake&#x27;s southern shore, running parallel to the main highway before turning south to connect to the main highway. At this intersection with US 8/WIS 47, the business loop ended after a total run of .

<doc id="884829" wikidata="Q1345113" url="?curid=884829" title="Toxocariasis">
<text>Toxocariasis is an illness of humans caused by the dog roundworm (&quot;Toxocara canis&quot;) and, less frequently, the cat roundworm (&quot;Toxocara cati&quot;). These are the most common intestinal roundworms of dogs, coyotes, wolves and foxes and domestic cats, respectively. Humans are among the many &quot;accidental&quot; or paratenic hosts of these roundworms.

While this zoonotic infection is usually asymptomatic, it may cause severe disease. There are three distinct syndromes of toxocariasis: &quot;covert toxocariasis&quot; is a relatively mild illness very similar to Löffler&#x27;s syndrome. It is characterized by fever, eosinophilia, urticaria, enlarged lymph nodes, cough, bronchospasm, wheezing, abdominal pain, headaches, and/or hepatosplenomegaly. &quot;Visceral larva migrans&quot; (VLM) is a more severe form of the disease; signs and symptoms depend on the specific organ system(s) involved. Lung involvement may manifest as shortness of breath, interstitial lung disease, pleural effusion, and even respiratory failure. Brain involvement may manifest as meningitis, encephalitis, or epileptic seizures. Cardiac involvement may manifest as myocarditis. &quot;Ocular larva migrans&quot; (OLM) is the third syndrome, manifesting as uveitis, endophthalmitis, visual impairment or even blindness in the affected eye.

==Signs and symptoms==
Physiological reactions to &quot;Toxocara&quot; infection depend on the host&#x27;s immune response and the parasitic load. Most cases of &quot;Toxocara&quot; infection are asymptomatic, especially in adults. When symptoms do occur, they are the result of migration of second-stage &quot;Toxocara&quot; larvae through the body.

===Covert toxocariasis===
Covert toxocariasis is the least serious of the three syndromes and is believed to be due to chronic exposure. Signs and symptoms of covert toxocariasis are coughing, fever, abdominal pain, headaches, and changes in behavior and ability to sleep. Upon medical examination, wheezing, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenitis are often noted.

===Visceral larva migrans===
High parasitic loads or repeated infection can lead to visceral larva migrans (VLM). VLM is primarily diagnosed in young children because they are more prone to exposure and ingestion of infective eggs. &quot;Toxocara&quot; infection commonly resolves itself within weeks, but chronic eosinophilia may result. In VLM, larvae migration incites inflammation of internal organs and sometimes the central nervous system. Symptoms depend on the organs affected. Children can present with pallor, fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, fever, headache, urticaria skin rash, cough, asthma, chest tightness, increased irritability, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Sometimes the subcutaneous migration tracks of the larvae can be seen. Children are commonly diagnosed with pneumonia, bronchospasms, chronic pulmonary inflammation, hypereosinophilia, hepatomegaly, hypergammaglobulinaemia (IgM, IgG, and IgE classes), leukocytosis, and elevated anti-A and anti-B isohaemagglutinins. Severe cases have occurred in people who are hypersensitive to allergens; in rare cases, epilepsy, inflammation of the heart, pleural effusion, respiratory failure, and death have resulted from VLM.

===Ocular larva migrans===
Ocular larva migrans (OLM) is rare compared with VLM. A light &quot;Toxocara&quot; burden is thought to induce a low immune response, allowing a larva to enter the host&#x27;s eye. Although there have been cases of concurrent OLM and VLM, these are extremely exceptional. OLM often occurs in just one eye and from a single larva migrating into and encysting within the orbit. Loss of vision occurs over days or weeks. Other signs and symptoms are red eye, white pupil, fixed pupil, retinal fibrosis, retinal detachment, inflammation of the eye tissues, retinal granulomas, and strabismus. Ocular granulomas resulting from OLM are frequently misdiagnosed as retinoblastomas. &quot;Toxocara&quot; damage in the eye is permanent and can result in blindness.

===Other===
Skin manifestations commonly include chronic urticaria, chronic pruritus, and miscellaneous forms of eczema.
A case study published in 2008 supported the hypothesis that eosinophilic cellulitis may also be caused by infection with &quot;Toxocara&quot;: the adult patient presented with eosinophilic cellulitis, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and a positive ELISA for &quot;T. cani&quot;s.

==Cause==
===Transmission===
&quot;Toxocara&quot; is usually transmitted to humans through ingestion of infective eggs. &quot;T. canis&quot; can lay around 200,000 eggs per day. These eggs are passed in cat or dog feces, but the defecation habits of dogs cause &quot;T. canis&quot; transmission to be more common than that of &quot;T. cati&quot;. Both &quot;Toxocara canis&quot; and &quot;Toxocara cati&quot; eggs require a several week incubation period in moist, humid weather outside a host before becoming infective, so fresh eggs cannot cause toxocariasis.

Many objects and surfaces can become contaminated with infectious &quot;Toxocara&quot; eggs. Flies that feed on feces can spread &quot;Toxocara&quot; eggs to surfaces or foods. Young children who put contaminated objects in their mouths or eat dirt (pica) are at risk of developing symptoms. Humans can also contaminate foods by not washing their hands before eating.

Humans are not the only accidental hosts of &quot;Toxocara&quot;. Eating undercooked rabbit, chicken, or sheep can lead to infection; encysted larvae in the meat can become reactivated and migrate through a human host, causing toxocariasis. Special attention should be paid to thoroughly cooking giblets and liver to avoid transmission.

===Incubation period===

The incubation period for &quot;Toxocara canis&quot; and &quot;cati&quot; eggs depends on temperature and humidity. &quot;T. canis&quot; females, specifically, are capable of producing up to 200,000 eggs a day that require 2–6 weeks minimum up to a couple months before full development into the infectious stage. Under ideal summer conditions, eggs can mature to the infective stage after two weeks outside of a host. Provided sufficient oxygen and moisture availability, &quot;Toxocara&quot; eggs can remain infectious for years, as their resistant outer shell enables protection from most environmental threats. However, as identified in a case study presented within the journal of helminthology, the second stage of larvae development poses strict vulnerabilities to certain environmental elements. High temperatures and low moisture levels will quickly degrade the larvae during this developmental stage.
===Reservoir===

Dogs and foxes are the reservoir for &quot;Toxocara canis&quot;, but puppies and cubs pose the greatest risk of spreading the infection to humans. Infection in most adult dogs is characterized by encysted second-stage larvae. However, these larvae can reactivate in pregnant females and cross the placental barrier to infect the pups. Vertical transmission can also occur through breast milk. Infectious mothers, and puppies under five weeks old, pass eggs in their feces. Approximately 50% of puppies and 20% of adult dogs are infected with &quot;T. canis&quot;.

Cats are the reservoir for &quot;Toxocara cati&quot;. As with &quot;T. canis&quot;, encysted second-stage larvae in pregnant or lactating cats reactivate. However, vertical transmission can only occur through breastfeeding.

Flies can act as mechanical vectors for &quot;Toxocara&quot;, but most infections occur without a vector. Most incidents with Toxocariasis result from prokaryotic expression vectors and their transmission through direct physical contact with feces that results in the contraction of the illness.

===Morphology===

Both species produce eggs that are brown and pitted. &quot;T. canis&quot; eggs measure 75-90 μm and are spherical, whereas the eggs of &quot;T. cati&quot; are 65-70 μm in diameter and oblong. Second-stage larvae hatch from these eggs and are approximately 0.5mm long and 0.02mm wide. Adults of both species have complete digestive systems and three lips, each composed of a dentigerous ridge.

Adult &quot;T. canis&quot; are found only within dogs and foxes and the males are 4–6 cm in length, with a curved posterior end. The males each have spicules and one “tubular testis.” Females can be as long as 15 cm, with the vulva stretching one-third of their body length. The females do not curve at the posterior end.

&quot;T. cati&quot; adult females are approximately 10 cm long, while males are typically 6 cm or less. The &quot;T. cati&quot; adults only occur within cats, and male &quot;T. cati&quot; are curved at the posterior end.

===Life cycle===

Cats, dogs, and foxes can become infected with &quot;Toxocara&quot; through the ingestion of eggs or by transmission of the larvae from a mother to her offspring. Transmission to cats and dogs can also occur by ingestion of infected accidental hosts, such as earthworms, cockroaches, rodents, rabbits, chickens, or sheep.

Eggs hatch as second-stage larvae in the intestines of the cat, dog, or fox host (for consistency, this article will assume that second-stage larvae emerge from &quot;Toxocara&quot; eggs, although there is debate as to whether larvae are truly in their second or third stage of development). Larvae enter the bloodstream and migrate to the lungs, where they are coughed up and swallowed. The larvae mature into adults within the small intestine of a cat, dog, or fox, where mating and egg-laying occurs. Eggs are passed in the feces and only become infective after three weeks outside of a host. During this incubation period, molting from first to second (and possibly third) stage larva takes place within the egg. In most adult dogs, cats and foxes, the full lifecycle does not occur, but instead second stage larvae encyst after a period of migration through the body. Reactivation of the larvae is common only in pregnant or lactating cats, dogs and foxes. The full lifecycle usually only occurs in these females and their offspring.

Second-stage larvae will also hatch in the small intestine of an accidental host, such as a human, after ingestion of infective eggs. The larvae will then migrate through the organs and tissues of the accidental host, most commonly the lungs, liver, eyes, and brain. Since L2 larvae cannot mature in accidental hosts, after this period of migration, &quot;Toxocara&quot; larvae will encyst as second stage larvae.

==Diagnosis==
Finding &quot;Toxocara&quot; larvae within a patient is the only definitive diagnosis for toxocariasis; however, biopsies to look for second-stage larvae in humans are generally not very effective. PCR, ELISA, and serological testing are more commonly used to diagnose &quot;Toxocara&quot; infection. Serological tests are dependent on the number of larvae within the patient, and are unfortunately not very specific. ELISAs are much more reliable and currently have a 78% sensitivity and a 90% specificity. A 2007 study announced an ELISA specific to &quot;Toxocara canis&quot;, which will minimize false positives from cross reactions with similar roundworms and will help distinguish if a patient is infected with &quot;T. canis&quot; or &quot;T. cati&quot;. OLM is often diagnosed after a clinical examination. Granulomas can be found throughout the body and can be visualized using ultrasound, MRI, and CT technologies.

==Prevention==
Actively involving veterinarians and pet owners is important for controlling the transmission of &quot;Toxocara&quot; from pets to humans. A group very actively involved in promoting a reduction of infections in dogs in the United States is the Companion Animal Parasite Council -- CAPC. Since pregnant or lactating dogs and cats and their offspring have the highest, active parasitic load, these animals should be placed on a deworming program. Pet feces should be picked up and disposed of or buried, as they may contain &quot;Toxocara&quot; eggs. Practicing this measure in public areas, such as parks and beaches, is especially essential for decreasing transmission. Up to 20% of soil samples of U.S. playgrounds have found roundworm eggs. Also, sandboxes should be covered when not in use to prevent cats from using them as litter boxes. Hand washing before eating and after playing with pets, as well as after handling dirt will reduce the chances of ingesting &quot;Toxocara&quot; eggs. Washing all fruits and vegetables, keeping pets out of gardens, and thoroughly cooking meats can also prevent transmission. Finally, teaching children not to place nonfood items, especially dirt, in their mouths will drastically reduce the chances of infection.

Toxocariasis has been named one of the neglected diseases of US poverty, because of its prevalence in Appalachia, the southern U.S., inner city settings, and minority populations.

There is currently no vaccine available or under development. 
The mitochondrial genomes of both &quot;T. cati&quot; and &quot;T. canis&quot; have been sequenced in 2008, which could lead to breakthroughs in treatment and prevention.

==Treatment==
Toxocariasis will often resolve itself because the &quot;Toxocara&quot; larvae cannot mature within human hosts. Corticosteroids are prescribed in severe cases of VLM or if the patient is diagnosed with OLM. Either albendazole (preferred) or mebendazole (“second line therapy”) may be prescribed. Granulomas can be surgically removed, or laser photocoagulation and cryoretinopexy can be used to destroy ocular granulomas.

Visceral toxocariasis in humans can be treated with antiparasitic drugs such as albendazole or mebendazole, tiabendazole or diethylcarbamazine usually in combination with anti-inflammatory medications. Steroids have been utilized with some positive results. Anti-helminthic therapy is reserved for severe infections (lungs, brain) because therapy may induce, due to massive larval killing, a strong inflammatory response. Ocular toxocariasis is more difficult to treat and usually consists of measures to prevent progressive damage to the eye.

==Epidemiology==
Humans are accidental hosts of &quot;Toxocara&quot;, yet toxocariasis is seen throughout the world. Most cases of toxocariasis are seen in people under the age of twenty. Seroprevalence is higher in developing countries but can be considerable in first world countries, as well. In Bali, St. Lucia, Nepal, and other countries, seroprevalence is over fifty percent. Previous to 2007, the U.S. seroprevalence was thought to be around 5% in children. However, Won et al. discovered that U.S. seroprevalence is 14% for the population at large. In many countries, toxocariasis is considered very rare. Approximately 10,000 clinical cases are seen a year in the U.S., with ten percent being OLM. Permanent vision loss occurs in 700 of these cases.

Young children are at the greatest risk of infection because they play outside and tend to place contaminated objects and dirt in their mouths. Dog ownership is another known risk factor for transmission. There is also a significant correlation between high &quot;Toxocara&quot; antibody titers and epilepsy in children.

Parasitic loads as high as 300 larvae in a single gram of liver have been noted in humans. The &quot;excretory-secretory antigens of larvae ... released from their outer epicuticle coat [and] ... readily sloughed off when bound by specific antibodies&quot; incite the host&#x27;s immune response. The tipping point between the development of VLM and OLM is believed to be between 100 and 200 larvae. The lighter infection in OLM is believed to stimulate a lower immune response and allow for the migration of a larva into the eye. Larvae are thought to enter the eye through the optic nerve, central retinal artery, short posterior ciliary arteries, soft tissues, or cerebrospinal fluid. Ocular granulomas that form around a larva typically are peripheral in the retina or optic disc.

Visceral larva migrans seems to affect children aged 1–4 more often while Ocular larva migrans more frequently affects children aged 7–8. Between 4.6% and 23% of US children have been infected with the dog roundworm egg. This number is much higher in other parts of the world, in tropical countries there is seroprevalence of up to 80–90%, such as Colombia, where up to 81% of children have been infected, or Honduras where seroprevalence among school-age children was reported to be 88%. In the western part of the world, seroprevalence is lower, around 35–42%.

==History==
Werner described a parasitic nematode in dogs in 1782 which he named &quot;Ascaris canis&quot;. Johnston determined that what Werner had described was actually a member of the genus &quot;Toxocara&quot; established by Stiles in 1905. Fülleborn speculated that &quot;T canis&quot; larvae might cause granulomatous nodules in humans. In 1947 Perlingiero and Gyorgy described the first case of what was probably toxocariasis. Their patient was a 2-year-old boy from Florida who had classical symptoms and eosinophilic necrotizing granulomas. In 1950, Campbell-Wilder was the first to describe toxocariasis in humans; she published a paper describing ocular granulomas in patients with endophthalmitis, Coat&#x27;s disease, or pseudoglioma. Two years later, Beaver et al. published the presence of &quot;Toxocara&quot; larvae in granulomas removed from patients with symptoms similar to those in Wilder&#x27;s patients. The dangers of toxocariasis were first raised in Britain in the 1970s, leading to a public health scare.

==Other animals==
===Cats===
Some treatments for infection with &quot;Toxocara cati&quot; include drugs designed to cause the adult worms to become partially anaesthetized and detach from the intestinal lining, allowing them to be excreted live in the feces. Such medications include piperazine and pyrantel. These are frequently combined with the drug praziquantel which appears to cause the worm to lose its resistance to being digested by the host animal. Other effective treatments include ivermectin, milbemycin, and selamectin. Dichlorvos has also been proven to be effective as a poison, though moves to ban it over concerns about its toxicity have made it unavailable in some areas.

Treatment for wild felids, however, is difficult for this parasite, as detection is the best way to find which individuals have the parasite. This can be difficult as infected species are hard to detect. Once detected, the infected individuals would have to be removed from the population, to lower the risk of continual exposure to the parasites. A primary method that has been used to lower the amount of infection is removal through hunting. Removal can also occur through landowners, as Dare and Watkins (2012) discovered through their research on cougars. Both hunters and landowners can provide samples that can be used to detect the presence of feline roundworm in the area, as well as help remove it from the population. This method is more practical than administering medications to wild populations, as wild animals, as mentioned before, are harder to find in order to administer medicinal care.

Medicinal care, however, is also another method used in roundworm studies; such as the experiment on managing raccoon roundworm done by Smyser et al. (2013) in which they implemented medical baiting. However, medicine is often expensive and the success of the baiting depends on whether the infected individuals consume the bait. Additionally, it can be costly (in time and resources) to check on baited areas. Removal by hunting allows agencies to reduce costs and gives agencies a more improved chance of removing infected individuals.

<text>Ranger 8 was a lunar probe in the Ranger program, a robotic spacecraft series launched by NASA in the early-to-mid-1960s to obtain the first close-up images of the Moon&#x27;s surface. These pictures helped select landing sites for Apollo missions and were used for scientific study. During its 1965 mission, Ranger 8 transmitted 7,137 lunar surface photographs before it crashed into the Moon as planned. This was the second successful mission in the Ranger series, following Ranger 7. Ranger 8&#x27;s design and purpose were very similar to those of Ranger 7. It had six television vidicon cameras: two full-scan and four partial-scan. Its sole purpose was to document the Moon&#x27;s surface.

==Spacecraft design==
=== General ===

Ranger spacecraft were originally designed, beginning in 1959, in three distinct phases called &quot;blocks&quot;. Rangers 6, 7, 8, and 9 were the Block 3 versions. The spacecraft consisted of a hexagonal aluminum frame base 1.5 m across on which was mounted the propulsion and power units, topped by a truncated conical tower that held the television cameras. Two solar panel wings, each 739 mm wide by 1537 mm long, extended from opposite edges of the base with a full span of 4.6 m, and a pointable high-gain dish antenna was hinge mounted at one of the corners of the base away from the solar panels. A cylindrical quasi-omnidirectional antenna was seated on top of the conical tower. The overall height of the spacecraft was 3.6 m.

Propulsion for the mid-course trajectory correction was provided by a 224 N thrust monopropellant hydrazine engine with four jet-vane vector control. Orientation and attitude control about three axes was enabled by twelve nitrogen gas jets coupled to a system of three gyroscopes, four primary Sun sensors, two secondary Sun sensors, and an Earth sensor. Power was supplied by 9,792 silicon solar cells contained in the two solar panels, giving a total array area of 2.3 square meters and producing 200 W. Two 1200-watt-hour AgZnO batteries rated at 26.5 V with a capacity for 9 hours of operation provided power to each of the separate communication/TV camera chains. Two 1000-watt-hour AgZnO batteries stored power for spacecraft operations.

=== Cameras ===
The spacecraft carried six television vidicon cameras —two wide-angle (channel F, cameras A and B) and four narrow-angle (channel P) —to accomplish these objectives. The cameras were arranged in two separate chains, or channels; each was self-contained with separate power supplies, timers, and transmitters, to afford the greatest reliability and probability of obtaining high-quality television pictures. No other experiments were carried on the spacecraft.

=== Communications ===
Communications were through the quasiomnidirectional low-gain antenna and the parabolic high-gain antenna. Transmitters aboard the spacecraft included a 60-watt television channel F at 959.52 MHz, a 60-watt television channel P at 960.05 MHz, and a 3-watt transponder channel 8 at 960.58 MHz. The telecommunications equipment converted the composite video signal from the camera transmitters into a radio-frequency signal for subsequent transmission through the spacecraft&#x27;s high-gain antenna. Sufficient video bandwidth was provided to allow for rapid framing sequences of both narrow- and wide-angle television pictures.

==Mission profile==

The Atlas 196D and Agena B 6006 boosters performed nominally, injecting the Agena and Ranger 8 into an Earth parking orbit at 185 km altitude after launch. Fourteen minutes later a 90-second burn of the Agena put the spacecraft into lunar transfer trajectory, and several minutes later the Ranger and Agena separated. The Ranger solar panels were deployed, attitude control activated, and spacecraft transmissions switched from the omniantenna to the high-gain antenna by 21:30 UT. On February 18, at a distance of 160,000 km from Earth, the planned mid-course maneuver took place, involving reorientation and a 59-second rocket burn. During the 27-minute maneuver, spacecraft transmitter power dropped severely, so that lock was lost on all telemetry channels. This continued intermittently until the rocket burn ended, at which time power returned to normal. The telemetry dropout had no serious effects on the mission. A planned terminal sequence to point the cameras more in the direction of flight just before reaching the Moon was cancelled to allow the cameras to cover a greater area of the Moon&#x27;s surface. 

Ranger 8 reached the Moon on February 20, 1965. The first image was taken at 9:34:32 UT at an altitude of 2510 km. Transmission of 7,137 photographs of good quality occurred over the final 23 minutes of flight. The final image taken before impact has a resolution of 1.5 meters. The spacecraft encountered the lunar surface in a direct hyperbolic trajectory, with incoming asymptotic direction at an angle of −13.6 degrees from the lunar equator. The orbit plane was inclined 16.5 degrees to the lunar equator. After 64.9 hours of flight, impact occurred at 09:57:36.756 UT on February 20, 1965, in Mare Tranquillitatis at approximately 2.67° N, 24.65° E. (The impact site is listed as about 2.72° N, 24.61° E in the initial report &quot;Ranger 8 Photographs of the Moon&quot;.) Impact velocity was slightly less than 2.68 km/s, approximately 6,000 mph. The spacecraft performance was excellent.

The impact crater of Ranger 8, approximately 13.5 m wide, was later photographed by &quot;Lunar Orbiter 4&quot;.

<text>U.S. Route 7 (US 7) is a north–south United States Numbered Highway in western New England that runs for through the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont. The highway&#x27;s southern terminus is at Interstate 95 (I-95) exit 15 in Norwalk, Connecticut. Its northern terminus is at I-89 exit 22 near the village of Highgate Springs, Vermont, immediately south of the Canada–United States border.

===Connecticut===

US 7 in Connecticut (also known as Route 7, Ethan Allen Highway, and Super 7) is mostly a surface road but has two short expressway sections in the Norwalk and Danbury areas. US 7 begins in Norwalk with a expressway to nearly the Wilton town line. There are three exits on this short section, signed as &quot;The Forty Third Infantry Division Memorial Highway&quot;, named after the 43rd Infantry Division. Exit 1, just past I-95 (the southern terminus), leads to the Central Norwalk Business District and US 1. Exit 2 leads to Route 123 which extends from US 1 in Norwalk to the New York state line, passing through the town of New Canaan. After exit 2, the expressway reduces to four lanes from six. Exit 3 leads to Route 15 southbound, also known as the Merritt Parkway. This interchange was half built and only allows southbound access from the expressway; northbound access is gained via Route 123 at exit 2. The expressway section ends at Grist Mill Road in Norwalk, about past exit 3. US 7 then passes through Wilton as a four-lane highway until just after Cannondale, where it becomes a two-lane highway. It continues through Ridgefield as a two-lane highway.

Near Danbury, another expressway section was built beginning south of I-84 near Danbury Municipal Airport. This section is also signed as &quot;The Forty Third Infantry Division Memorial Highway&quot;. Through Danbury proper, US 7 overlaps with I-84 for about . Through this section of expressway, I-84, US 7, US 6, and US 202 are concurrent. US 7 and Route 202 then leave I-84 at exit 7 and travel on their own expressway for approximately to just south of the New Milford town line. On this section there are two exits. At exit 11 (Federal Road), US 202 exits the expressway and at exit 12, US 202 crosses back over US 7. On southbound US 7, the exit for I-84 eastbound is signed as exit 10. There is no exit number for I-84 west because of the concurrency. The US 7 expressway then bypasses Brookfield to the west and terminates at an intersection with US 202 at the Fairfield–Litchfield county line. Construction on the section between I-84 and exit 12 began in 1974 and completed in 1976. The Brookfield bypass segment between exit 12 and the current expressway terminus opened in November 2009, after two years of construction. The former US 7 route through Brookfield is now signed solely as US 202.

US 7 is cosigned with US 202 until central New Milford, where US 202 turns east with Route 67 while US 7 continues north. Recent construction has also made large parts of US 7 between the terminus of the expressway and New Milford a four-lane divided highway with at-grade intersections. North of New Milford center, US 7 remains a two-lane road through the rest of Connecticut and leaves Connecticut in the town of North Canaan.

===Massachusetts===

US 7 enters Massachusetts in the town of Sheffield and remains a two-lane road until Lenox. There, a four-lane bypass of Lenox was built in two pieces, and the old US 7 is now Route 7A. US 7 continues on as a four-lane road to Pittsfield, where it is then a three-lane road, narrowing to two lanes for a short time, then widening to four lanes in downtown Pittsfield. US 7 leaves downtown Pittsfield as a two-lane surface arterial and continues as a rural highway with occasional three-lane stretches for climbing the grades along the Berkshires. It passes west of Mount Greylock before passing through Williamstown, connecting the Taconic Trail with the Mohawk Trail. The road passes Williams College before entering Vermont.

Like Connecticut, Massachusetts planned a US 7 expressway from the existing bypass in Lenox all the way to Lanesborough. This plan was never initiated, although land takings occurred. The highway was ultimately canceled due to environmental and community opposition.

In Massachusetts, US 7 passes through the towns of Sheffield, Great Barrington, Stockbridge, Lee, Lenox, Pittsfield, Lanesborough, New Ashford, and Williamstown, before crossing into Pownal, Vermont.

===Vermont===


US 7 remains a rural two-lane highway from the Massachusetts line to Bennington, where it becomes a grade separated freeway north of Bennington. Once complete, US 7 will utilize this new bypass, while the existing two-lane road into town will become part of Vermont Route 7A (VT 7A). North of town, the highway then again returns to expressway status. For , it is a four-lane freeway with a grass median. US 7 then narrows down to an undivided two-lane freeway, with brief passing lanes in each direction. Just north of Manchester, the expressway ends. From Manchester to Wallingford, the road is two lanes and rural. North of Wallingford, US 7 becomes a four-lane divided highway with at-grade intersections, until its southern junction with US 4, south of the city of Rutland. From Rutland north, the road is either two-lane or four-lane undivided, uncontrolled road all the way to the Canada–United States border, except between Shelburne and Burlington, which is a four-lane divided highway. US 7 and US 2 run concurrently from Burlington to Chimney Corners in Colchester. It is known as the Ethan Allen Highway for much of the path through Vermont.

In Vermont, it passes through the towns of Pownal, Bennington, Shaftsbury, Glastenbury, Arlington, Sunderland, Manchester, Dorset, Danby, Mount Tabor, Wallingford, Clarendon, and Rutland; the city of Rutland; the towns of Pittsford, Brandon, Leicester, Salisbury, Middlebury, New Haven, Waltham, Ferrisburg, Charlotte, and Shelburne; the cities of South Burlington (at which point I-89 begins to parallel it), Burlington, and Winooski; the towns of Colchester, Milton, Georgia, and St. Albans; the city of St. Albans; and the towns of Swanton and Highgate before ending at I-89 just south of the customs offices at the Canada–United States border.

==History==

Prior to the U.S. Numbered Highway System, the alignment of US 7 from Great Barrington, Massachusetts, to the Canada–United States border north of Highgate Springs, Vermont, was part of the New England road marking system&#x27;s Route 4. When first commissioned in 1927, US 7 ran along the entire length of Route 4, continuing south from Great Barrington along current Route 41. Route 41 continues into Connecticut up to the town of Sharon. Route 4 then went west along Route 343 to the New York state line, where the road continues along New York State Route 343 (NY 343) to Amenia. US 7 originally extended further south of Amenia all the way to New York City along NY 22 but was never signed within the city. By 1929, the southern terminus had been shifted to Norwalk, Connecticut. The previous designations of the new alignment south of Great Barrington were: Route 17 to North Canaan, State Highway 134 to New Milford, State Highway 128 to Danbury, Route 3 to Ridgefield, and State Highway 126 to Norwalk.

Until the 1970s, US 7 reached the Canada–United States border, with the road continuing as provincial route 7. US 7 was then cut back to the I-89 interchange mentioned above, with I-89 continuing to the Canada–US border and becoming Route 133.

<text>Sanahin () is a district of the city of Alaverdi in the northern province of Lori in Armenia. Once a separate village, it is the location of the Sanahin Monastery complex, founded in the 10th century and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with the nearby Haghpat Monastery.

==Notable people==
Sanahin was the birthplace of the brothers Anastas and Artem Mikoyan. Artem was a famous aircraft designer, and co-founder of the Mikoyan-Gurevich (MiG) design bureau along with Mikhail Gurevich. Anastas was a Soviet statesman and long-serving Politburo member, known for his roles in the Soviet food industry, de-Stalinization, and international diplomacy, especially during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In addition to Sanahin Monastery, many visitors also stop at the nearby Mikoyan Brothers Museum, run by relatives of the Mikoyan family.

<text>Ranger 9 was a Lunar probe, launched in 1965 by NASA. It was designed to achieve a lunar impact trajectory and to transmit high-resolution photographs of the lunar surface during the final minutes of flight up to impact. The spacecraft carried six television vidicon cameras—two wide-angle (channel F, cameras A and B) and four narrow-angle (channel P)—to accomplish these objectives. The cameras were arranged in two separate chains, or channels, each self-contained with separate power supplies, timers, and transmitters so as to afford the greatest reliability and probability of obtaining high-quality television pictures. These images were broadcast live on television to millions of viewers across the United States. No other experiments were carried on the spacecraft.

==Spacecraft design==

Rangers 6, 7, 8, and 9 were the so-called Block 3 versions of the Ranger spacecraft. The spacecraft consisted of a hexagonal aluminium frame base 1.5 m across on which was mounted the propulsion and power units, topped by a truncated conical tower which held the TV cameras. Two solar panel wings, each 739 mm wide by 1537 mm long, extended from opposite edges of the base with a full span of 4.6 m, and a pointable high-gain dish antenna was hinge mounted at one of the corners of the base away from the solar panels. A cylindrical quasiomnidirectional antenna was seated on top of the conical tower. The overall height of the spacecraft was 3.6 m.

Propulsion for the mid-course trajectory correction was provided by a 224-N thrust monopropellant hydrazine engine with four jet-vane thrust vectoring. Orientation and attitude control about three axes was enabled by 12 nitrogen gas jets coupled to a system of three gyroscopes, four primary Sun sensors, two secondary Sun sensors, and an Earth sensor. Power was supplied by 9792 Si solar cells contained in the two solar panels, giving a total array area of 2.3 square meters and producing 200 W. Two 1,200 watt-hour batteries rated at 26.5 V with a capacity for 9 hours of operation provided power to each of the separate communication/TV camera chains. Two 1,000 watt-hour batteries stored power for spacecraft operations.

Communications were through the quasiomnidirectional low-gain antenna and the parabolic high-gain antenna. Transmitters aboard the spacecraft included a 60 W TV channel F at 959.52 MHz, a 60 W TV channel P at 960.05 MHz, and a 3 W transponder channel 8 at 960.58 MHz. The telecommunications equipment converted the composite video signal from the camera transmitters into an RF signal for subsequent transmission through the spacecraft high-gain antenna. Sufficient video bandwidth was provided to allow for rapid framing sequences of both narrow and wide-angle television pictures.

==Mission profile==
The Atlas 204D and Agena B 6007 boosters performed nominally, injecting the Agena and Ranger 9 into an Earth parking orbit at altitude. A 90-second Agena second burn put the spacecraft into lunar transfer trajectory. This was followed by the separation of the Agena and Ranger. Seventy minutes after launch, the command was given to deploy solar panels, activate attitude control, and switch from the omniantenna to the high-gain antenna. The accuracy of the initial trajectory enabled delay of the planned mid-course correction from 22 to 23 March when the maneuver was initiated at 12:03 UT. After orientation, a 31-second rocket burn at 12:30 UT, and reorientation, the maneuver was completed at 13:30 UT.

Ranger 9 reached the Moon on 24 March 1965. At 13:31 UTC, a terminal maneuver was executed to orient the spacecraft so the cameras were more in line with the flight direction to improve the resolution of the pictures. 20 minutes before impact, the one-minute camera system warm-up began. The first image was taken at 13:49:41 UTC at an altitude of . Transmission of 5,814 good contrast photographs was made during the final 19 minutes of flight. The final image taken before impact has a resolution of . The spacecraft encountered the lunar surface with an incoming asymptotic direction at an angle of -5.6 degrees from the lunar equator. The orbit plane was inclined 15.6 degrees to the lunar equator. After 64.5 hours of flight, impact occurred at 14:08:19.994 UTC at approximately 12.83 S latitude, 357.63 E longitude in the Alphonsus crater. Impact velocity was . The spacecraft performance was excellent. Real-time television coverage with live network broadcasts of many of the F-channel images (primarily camera B but also some camera A pictures) were provided for this flight.

<text>John Williams Gunnison (November 11, 1812 – October 26, 1853) was an American military officer and explorer.

==Biography==
Gunnison was born in Goshen, New Hampshire, in 1812 and attended Hopkinton Academy in Hopkinton, New Hampshire. He graduated from West Point in 1837, second in his class of fifty cadets. His military career began as an artillery officer in Florida, where he spent a year in the campaign against the Seminoles. Due to his poor health he was reassigned to the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers the next year. Initially he explored unknown areas of Florida, searching for provision routes. However, his health soon forced him out of Florida entirely.

From 1841 to 1849 Gunnison explored the area around the Great Lakes. He surveyed the border between Wisconsin and Michigan, the western coast of Lake Michigan, and the coast of Lake Erie. On May 9, 1846, he was promoted to first lieutenant.

In the spring of 1849 Gunnison was assigned as second in command of the Howard Stansbury expedition to explore and survey the valley of the Great Salt Lake. That winter was particularly heavy and the expedition was unable to leave the valley. Gunnison took the opportunity to befriend some Mormons and study the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. When he finally returned to Washington, DC, he wrote a book titled &quot;The Mormons or Latter-Day Saints, in the Valley of the Great Salt Lake: A History of Their Rise and Progress, Peculiar Doctrines, Present Condition.&quot;

Gunnison returned to the Great Lakes from 1851 to 1853, mapping the Green Bay area, and was promoted to captain on March 3, 1853.

==Gunnison–Beckwith expedition==
On May 3, 1853, he received orders to take charge of an expedition to survey a route for a Pacific railroad between the 38th and 39th parallels. The surveying party left St. Louis, Missouri, in June 1853 and arrived by mid-October in Manti, Utah Territory. In Utah Territory, with Lieutenant E. G. Beckwith as assistant commander, Gunnison began the survey of a possible route, surveying areas across the Rocky Mountains via the Huerfano River, through Cochetopa Pass, and by way of the present Gunnison and Green rivers to the Sevier River. His journey took him through the Tomichi Valley in Colorado, where the town of Gunnison is named in his honor. After crossing the Tomichi Valley, the survey team encountered the Black Canyon, carved by the Gunnison River which was also named in his honor. The team was forced to turn south to get around the canyon.

===Attack and massacre===

The weather was beginning to turn &quot;cold and raw&quot; with snow flurries, and Captain Gunnison sought to speed up mapping before returning to winter quarters. Several miles upstream of Sevier Lake (about the site of the present Gunnison Bend Reservoir), the team was divided into two detachments. Gunnison and his party of 11 men moved downstream, while the other party moved upstream. On the morning of October 26, 1853, Gunnison&#x27;s party was attacked by a band of Pahvants (Ute). In the resulting massacre, Gunnison and seven of his men were killed. Several survivors of the attack alerted the other detachment of the survey team, who rode to aid Gunnison and his party. An additional survivor of the attack and the bodies of the victims were retrieved later that day. The remains of the eight dead were found in a mutilated state. Killed with Gunnison were Richard Hovenden Kern (topographer &amp; artist; 1821-1853), Frederick Creutzfeldt (German botanist), William Washington Potter (Mormon guide; 1819-1853), Private Caulfield, Private Liptoote, Private Mehreens, and John Bellows (camp roustabout). The site of the massacre was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 30, 1976.

===Investigations and allegations===
Most contemporary accounts of the massacre maintain that the Mormons warned Gunnison that his party might be in danger from local bands of Pahvant Utes. It seems that Gunnison had entered Utah in the midst of the Walker War, a sometimes bloody conflict between the Mormons and the Ute Chief Walkara. Indeed, Lt. Beckwith later wrote that the expedition found the local Mormons &quot;all gathered into a village for mutal protection against the Utah Indians.&quot; But after the killings, rumors circulated that the Pahvants involved in the massacre were acting under the direction of Brigham Young and an alleged secret militia known as the Danites. Some claim that leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were initially concerned that the railway would increase the influx of non-Mormon settlers and non-Mormon economic concerns into the territory. However, the Utah Legislature (dominated by LDS officials) had repeatedly petitioned Congress for both a transcontinental railroad and telegraph lines to pass through the region. When the railroad finally came to Utah, LDS leaders organized cadres of Mormon workers to build the railway, welcoming the income for the economically depressed community.

Martha Gunnison, widow of Captain Gunnison, was one of those who maintained that the attack was planned and orchestrated by militant Mormons under the direction of Brigham Young. Gunnison&#x27;s letters to his wife throughout the expedition left her with the impression that &quot;the Mormons were the directors of my husband&#x27;s murder.&quot; She wrote to Associate Justice W.W. Drummond, the 1855 federal appointee to the Supreme Court of the Territory of Utah. She received confirmation of this belief in his response to her letter. Drummond drew this conclusion from informant and witness testimonies in several trials after the murders. He cited numerous reports by whites and natives of white attackers dressed up as Indians during the massacre.

In 1854 Lieutenant Colonel Edward Steptoe was sent by the War Department to investigate the attack and determine the truth of rumors that Mormons had colluded with the Indians in the ambush. As a result of his investigation eight Ute Indians were charged and tried for the attack. Three were convicted of manslaughter. He did not uncover evidence of Mormon involvement.

Lt. Beckwith also concluded that the Mormons had nothing to do with the attack and that the Pahvants acted alone. He wrote in his official report that the &quot;statement which has from time to time appeared (or been copied) in various newspapers...charging the Mormons or Mormon authorities with instigating the Indians to, if not actually aiding them in, the murder of Captain Gunnison and his associates, is, I believe, not only entirely false, but there is no accidental circumstance connected with it affording the slightest foundation for such a charge.&quot;

Nevertheless, the Gunnison Massacre resulted in much controversy and added additional strain to the relationship between Governor Brigham Young of the Utah Territory and the federal government. This incident contributed to tensions eventually leading to the Utah War, wherein President Buchanan sent the U.S. Army to the Utah Territory in order to stop a reported Mormon insurrection.

<text>Neftchala District () is one of the 66 districts of Azerbaijan. It is located in the southeast of the country and belongs to the Shirvan-Salyan Economic Region. The district borders the districts of Jalilabad, Bilasuvar, Salyan, Lankaran, and Masally. Its capital and largest city is Neftchala. As of 2020, the district had a population of 88,900.

== History ==
The Neftchala District was formed as a district in the composition of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic on February 11, 1940. Until this time, it was located in the area of modern Salyan District, and during that year it became part of the Khilly region, organized on January 24, 1939. As Neftchala was an exceptionally industrial region, it was liquidated in December 1959 and unified with the Salyan region. However, after 4 years it was split off from the Salyan District again and became a separate industrial zone. But it was felt that this mixed system for control did not justify itself, and once again Neftchala region was liquidated in 1965 and became part of the Salyan. The region was finally made separate again after 7 years on April 27, 1973.

== Territory ==
There is one city (Neftchala), 48 villages, and 3 settlements (Banke, Khylly, and Hasanabad) in the district. Neftchala district is bordered by Masally, Salyan, Jelilabad, Bilesuvar, and Lankaran.

The total area of the district is 1,451 km 2, of which 825 km 2 is productive lands. Agricultural lands cover 390 km 2 of the territory. Cattle-breeding pastures occupy 355 km 2, while the total area of planted lands is 470 km 2. Fruit gardens and saline lands cover 5 km 2 and 13 km 2, respectively.

== Population ==
== Geography and climate ==
The territory of the district is mainly lowland. The district is situated 22 meters lower than sea level. Shirvan and Mugan Lowlands covers the southeast of the district. The river Kura flows into the Caspian Sea in Neftchala district. There are mud volcanos that occupy the area from Baligchi to Gizilagaj bay. There are several underwater plains in the coastal area of the Neftchala district. They are Karagedov, Kalmichkov, Kur, Borisov, Kornilov-Pavlov, Plita, Pogorelaya, and Golovachev. There is a lake named Duzdag, which is situated between Babazanan and Durovdag peaks, on the border of the Salyan district.

The district has a semi-desert and warm climate. The average temperature is 3C in January and 25-36 C in July.

== Flora and fauna ==
Lands of the district are divided as grey-meadow, alluvial meadow, and swampy meadow. There are saline soils as well. Vegetation in the district is semidesert and desert type. There can be found Tugay forests.

The district&#x27;s fauna is diverse. The dominant fauna of the Neftchala district includes gazelle, pelican, boar, wolf, wild cat, rabbit and such.

== Economy ==
&quot;Khazar&quot; is an automobile factory belonging to Azermash Company located in Neftchala, Azerbaijan.

Agriculture, fishing, oil, and gas are the cores of the district economy. 
== Municipalities ==
There are 17 municipalities in the district which consist of 163 members. Neftchala municipality has 15 members, Khylly municipality has 9, Hasanabad municipality has 11, and other village municipalities have 128 members. The municipalities of Neftchala district are situated in the city, with two settlements, and 14 villages.

== Court ==
The court was established on 20 April 1974. The initial name of the court was Neftchala District People&#x27;s Court. Its name was changed to Neftchala District Court in 2000.

<text>Bragi Boddason, known as Bragi the Old (Old Norse: &quot;Bragi hinn gamli&quot;) was a Norwegian skald active in the first half of the 9th century, the earliest known skald from whom verses have survived. Portions of his &quot;Ragnarsdrápa&quot; are preserved in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Edda&quot;.

==Life and career==
Bragi is known as &quot;the Old&quot; to distinguish him from a 12th-century skald, Bragi Hallsson. He was a member of a prominent family in southwestern Norway; according to &quot;Landnámabók&quot;, he married Lopthœna, the daughter of Erpr lútandi, another skald, and among their descendants was the early 11th-century skald Gunnlaugr ormstunga. &quot;Skáldatal&quot; lists him as a court poet to three kings, Ragnarr Loðbrók, Eysteinn Beli, and Bjǫrn at haugi, which has led to his life being dated to the 9th century, usually to the first half of that century. However, the dating of the reigns of all but King Bjǫrn in Sweden suggest a later date, and some including Guðbrandur Vigfússon have preferred dates of 835–900. &quot;Landnámabók&quot; also reports that when visiting Ljúfvina, the wife of king Hjǫrr of Hǫrðaland, he perceived that she had substituted the fair-skinned son of a thrall woman for her dark-skinned twin sons Geirmundr and Hámundr and persuaded her to reinstate her own sons. This story and the story of his confronting a troll-woman, are probably legends.

Bragi has the same name as the god Bragi, which has led some to doubt his historicity, but there are enough mentions of him to attest to his having lived, so that it is likely he was deified and gave his name to the god. He has been credited with inventing the &quot;dróttkvætt&quot; meter characteristic of skaldic poetry, possibly under the influence of Irish verse forms, but although later skalds imitated some of his kennings, the complexity of his verse makes it more probable that earlier poetry representing the development of the tradition has been lost.

==Works==
In &quot;Egils saga&quot;, ch. 59, Bragi is said to have composed a poem to &quot;ransom his head&quot; after angering King Bjǫrn; Egill Skallagrímsson is persuaded to follow his example by his friend and Bragi&#x27;s great-grandson Arinbjǫrn, leading him to compose his &quot;Hǫfuðlausn&quot; for Erik Bloodax.

Most of his verses that we have preserved appear to be part of his &quot;Ragnarsdrápa&quot;. This is a shield lay, composed in return for the gift of a decorated shield, according to Snorri from Ragnarr Loðbrók, but many scholars consider it more likely the poem was dedicated to a different Ragnarr. It appears to have consisted of an introductory verse followed by four sets of four verses, each describing a scene depicted on the shield: two mythological, Gefjon plowing the island of Zealand out of Sweden and Thor fishing for the World Serpent Jǫrmungandr, and two heroic, Hamðir and Sǫrli&#x27;s attack on King Jǫrmunrekkr, and the never-ending battle between Heðinn and Hǫgni, and presumably a concluding verse. Parts or all of twenty verses survive; one verse attributed to Bragi in all but one manuscript of the &quot;Edda&quot; is probably correctly assigned to Úlfr Uggason&#x27;s &quot;Húsdrápa&quot;, which also describes a portrayal of Thor&#x27;s fishing expedition.

<doc id="884879" wikidata="Q3192874" url="?curid=884879" title="Kapton">
<text>Kapton is a polyimide film used in flexible printed circuits (flexible electronics) and space blankets, which are used on spacecraft, satellites, and various space instruments. Invented by the DuPont Corporation in the 1960s, Kapton remains stable across a wide range of temperatures, from . Kapton is used in electronics manufacturing, space applications, with x-ray equipment, and in 3D printing applications. Its favorable thermal properties and outgassing characteristics result in its regular use in cryogenic applications and in situations where high vacuum environments are experienced.

== History ==

Kapton was invented by DuPont in the 1960s. Kapton remains manufactured by DuPont to this day.

The name &quot;Kapton&quot; is a registered trademark of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company.

== Chemistry and variants ==

Kapton synthesis is an example of the use of a in step polymerization. The intermediate polymer, known as a &quot;poly(amic acid)&quot;, is soluble because of strong hydrogen bonds to the polar solvents usually employed in the reaction. The ring closure is carried out at high temperatures of .

The chemical name for Kapton K and HN is &quot;poly (4,4&#x27;-oxydiphenylene-pyromellitimide)&quot;. It is produced from the condensation of pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) and 4,4&#x27;-oxydiphenylamine (ODA).

Kapton E is a mix of two dianhydrides, PMDA and biphenyltetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (BPDA), and two diamines, ODA and p-phenylenediamine (PPD). The BPDA component adds greater dimensional stability and flatness in flexible circuitry applications. Kapton E offers reduced coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), reduced moisture absorption, and reduced coefficient of hygroscopic expansion (CHE) compared to Kapton H.

== Characteristics ==

In isolation, Kapton remains stable across a wide range of temperatures, from . 

The thermal conductivity of Kapton at temperatures from 0.5 to 5 Kelvin is rather high for such low temperatures, κ = 4.638×10−3 &quot;T&quot;0.5678 W·m−1·K−1. 

Kapton insulation ages poorly: an FAA study shows degradation in hot, humid environments or in the presence of seawater. It was found to have very poor resistance to mechanical wear, mainly abrasion within cable harnesses due to aircraft movement. Many aircraft models have had to undergo extensive rewiring modifications—sometimes completely replacing all the Kapton-insulated wiring—because of short circuits caused by the faulty insulation. Kapton-wire degradation and chafing due to vibration and heat has been implicated in multiple crashes of both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft, with loss of life. The &quot;New York Times&quot;, citing a NASA OIG document, reported in 2005 that Kapton-insulated cables on the Space Shuttle &quot;tended to break down over time, causing short circuits and, potentially, fires.&quot; The STS-93 mission saw electrical shorts on Kapton insulation disable two engine controllers and nearly cause catastrophe.

== Usage ==
===Electronics manufacturing===
Due to its large range of temperature stability and its electrical isolation ability, Kapton tape is usually used in electronic manufacturing as an insulation and protection layer on electrostatic-sensitive and fragile components. As it can sustain the temperature needed for a reflow soldering operation, its protection is available throughout the whole production process, and Kapton is often still present in the final consumer product.

=== Spacecraft ===
The descent stage of the Apollo Lunar Module, and the bottom of the ascent stage surrounding the ascent engine, were covered in blankets of aluminized Kapton foil to provide thermal insulation. During the return journey from the Moon, Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong commented that during the launch of the Lunar Module &quot;Eagle&quot; ascent stage, he could see &quot;Kapton and other parts of the LM staging scattering all around the area for great distances.&quot;

The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory has considered Kapton as a good plastic support for solar sails because of its durability in the space environment.

NASA&#x27;s &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft used Kapton in an innovative &quot;Thermos bottle&quot; insulation design to keep the craft operating between throughout its more than nine-year, journey to rendezvous with the dwarf planet Pluto on 14 July 2015. The main body is covered in lightweight, gold-colored, multilayered thermal insulation which holds in heat from operating electronics to keep the spacecraft warm. The thermal blanketing of 18 layers of Dacron mesh cloth sandwiched between aluminized Mylar and Kapton film also helped to protect the craft from micrometeorites.

The James Webb Space Telescope sunshield is made of five Kapton E sheets coated with aluminum and doped silicon to reflect heat away from the spacecraft body.

The crew aboard the International Space Station used Kapton tape to temporarily repair a slow leak in a Soyuz spacecraft attached to the Russian segment of the orbital complex in August 2018. It was used again in October 2020 to temporarily seal a leak in the transfer chamber of the Zvezda Service Module of the ISS.

===X-rays ===

Kapton is also commonly used as a material for windows used with all kinds of X-ray sources (synchrotron beam-lines and X-ray tubes) and X-ray detectors. Its high mechanical and thermal stability as well as high transmittance of X-rays make it the preferred material. It is also relatively insensitive to radiation damage.

===3D printing===

Kapton and ABS adhere to each other very well, which has led to widespread use of Kapton as a build surface for 3D printers. Kapton is laid down on a flat surface and the ABS is extruded onto the Kapton surface. The ABS part being printed will not detach from the build platform as it cools and shrinks, a common cause of print failure by warping of the part. A more durable alternative is to use a polyetherimide surface.

Researchers have devised a method to 3D-print polyimide material including Kapton. The polyamic acid precursor to Kapton is mixed with an acrylate cross linker and photoinitiator that can form a gel when exposed to ultraviolet light during 3D printing. Subsequent heating of the 3D printed part up to 400 °C removes the sacrificial crosslinks and imidizes the part forming Kapton with a 3D printed geometry.

=== Others ===

Kapton&#x27;s relatively high thermal conductivity at very low temperatures, together with its good dielectric qualities and its availability as thin sheets, have made it a favorite material in cryogenics, as it provides electrical insulation at low thermal gradients.

Kapton is regularly used as an insulator in ultra-high-vacuum environments due to its low outgassing rate.

Kapton-insulated electrical wiring has been widely used in civil and military aircraft because it is lighter than other insulators and has good insulating and temperature characteristics.

<text>Suspension bondage is a form of sexual bondage where a bound person is hung from one or more overhead suspension points. It carries a higher risk than other forms of sexual bondage.

== Stimulation ==
In &quot;partial suspension&quot;, the person is bound in a way that part of their body weight is held by suspension ropes, cables or chains. The classic partial suspension position is to have the person balancing on one foot with part of their weight supported through a chest harness and the other leg pulled up in some direction. A person lying on their upper back with legs tied upwards to a suspension point to pull their lower back off the ground would also qualify as partial suspension.

In &quot;full suspension&quot;, the person is completely supported by suspension ropes, cables or chains, and they have no contact with the ground. The position of the person&#x27;s body in a full suspension is only limited by their endurance and the skill of the binder.

The main effect of suspension bondage is to create a heightened sense of vulnerability and inescapability, so that the subject is made to feel that by attempting to free themselves, they may fall and hurt themselves. This is meant to create a form of mental bondage. Being suspended, especially in a large open space, also creates a sense of objectification, submissiveness and erotic helplessness for the subject, which can be erotically stimulating for them and for those observing them. Rope suspension is sometimes done as performance art at BDSM conventions and fetish-themed nightclubs.

Suspension can alternatively create a sense of liberation in that one can glide around the room, and some styles of rigging are optimal for the suspendee to have control over their spin rate, body position, and general activities. Trance-like states are also common, resulting alternatively or simultaneously from the sensations of anti-gravity, the heightened awareness of one&#x27;s body, and the sacrifice of one&#x27;s natural physical strengths.

Self-induced suspension bondage may involve autoerotic asphyxia.

== Three main positions ==
The three main suspension positions are vertical, horizontal and inverted.

=== Vertical suspension ===

This primarily involves the person being lifted from the ground by their wrists. This is usually achieved by use of rope or by special suspension cuffs. When using rope, extreme damage can be caused to the soft tissues of the wrists, as well as reducing circulation, so being suspended by ropes can only normally be achieved for a very short period of time. Often in fiction and movies a person may be pictured hanging from metal cuffs or handcuffs. This is possible, although extremely painful and will leave deep marks in the wrists. The safest and &quot;most comfortable&quot; method of suspension by the wrists is to use suspension cuffs as they are specifically designed to spread the weight around the wrist as much as possible.

An alternative method of vertical suspension is to use a bondage rope harness. With the ropes tied around the body and in particular around the upper arms close to the shoulders as well as around the upper leg and through the groin, it is possible to suspend a person with ropes attached to these areas similar to the way a parachute is attached to a person. In this position the arms and legs may be left to hang free, as the person would have great difficulty getting free without assistance.

=== Horizontal suspension ===
The horizontal suspension position has the subject bound in a horizontal position, sometimes face up but usually face down. The body is lifted into this position either by attaching bondage equipment to the wrists and ankles, or to other areas of the body, or a mixture of both, with the subject&#x27;s weight born by these areas. The ankles or wrists may be brought together or kept apart by a spreader bar. In case of the wrists and ankles, ropes or suspension cuffs can be used. When the body itself is used to suspend the person, they may first be tied into a conventional bondage position such as a hogtie or ball tie, then by attaching ropes or chains to ropes under areas of the body able to take weight the person is lifted into the air.

A variation on this position is to secure the wrists to either the spreader bar or to a securing point between their ankles forming a hogtie, resulting in what is called a suspension bow. In this position, if the subject is a female and facing down, her breasts would be pointing almost straight down depending on the strictness of the position, and nipple clamps and weights can be added for painful stimulation. The clamps may alternatively be secured to a point on the floor, limiting the subject&#x27;s ability to struggle or move at all without causing pain.

=== Inverted suspension ===

Being suspended upside down can be a very hard position to maintain as a result of the position causing the blood to rush to the head. This means that this position probably cannot be maintained for any length of time. To be suspended in this position, ropes or suspension cuffs are used to lift the person into the air by their ankles.

Unlike when a person is suspended by their wrists, rope suspension around the ankles can be maintained for much longer as the ankle region naturally is able to take far more weight and stress than the wrists. This is especially so if boots are used as the ropes can run around the outside surface of the boot thus protecting the skin from damage. The person may be suspended with their legs together, or held apart either by using a spreader bar or by securing the ankles to two separate locations. With the legs held in this position, the subject may have an increased sense of vulnerability as their genital region would be easily accessible.

==Risks==

The danger most often associated with suspension bondage, over and above the usual risks inherent in bondage, is falling; whether due to a weak suspension point, faulty equipment or poor technique. Inverted positions are especially hazardous in this regard since a head-first fall of only a few inches can kill or paralyze a person. Less obvious dangers include nerve compression and resulting damage, circulation problems and fainting, and the recently recognized harness hang syndrome. Harness hang syndrome appears to relate to suspension with the legs below the heart, as in the case when someone is suspended in a standing position, with no weight on their legs. Extracting a person safely out of suspension bondage can be difficult if they are unconscious, or if a winch or hoist jams. Suspension tops will often work with spotters who can help get the person down in an emergency.

== Experts ==
Suspension bondage is a difficult subject to find information on. 
While many famous riggers regularly perform suspensions, they have expressed hesitation in committing such knowledge for dissemination, due to the increased risk of injury to amateurs attempting to imitate without enough prior research or practice. Although most suspension bondage educational material is found on the Internet, there are books available on the topic.

<text>Jan Brzechwa (; 15 August 1898 – 2 July 1966) was a Polish poet, author and lawyer, known mostly for his contribution to children&#x27;s literature. He was born Jan Wiktor Lesman to a Polish family of Jewish descent.

== Early life ==

Brzechwa was born in Żmerynka, Podolia. His father was a railway engineer and his mother Michalina, née Lewicka, was a French teacher. Jan spent a lot of his childhood travelling around Eastern Poland (&quot;Kresy&quot;) with his family. Brzechwa studied at the Jesuit college in Chyrów, (present day Khyriv in Ukraine), and upon moving from Podolia to Warsaw, he graduated from the School of Law at the Warsaw University. During the Polish-Soviet War, he volunteered for the 36th Regiment of the Academic Infantry Legion, a formation composed of university students and was decorated for his service. His formal writing debut took place in 1920 by way of various humor magazines. He worked as a lawyer and attorney for the Polish Society of Authors and Composers (ZAIKS) where he specialized and excelled in copyright law.

Brzechwa was a cousin of another famous Polish poet, Bolesław Leśmian. He was married three times; first to Maria Sunderland, his first cousin once removed and a niece of the renowned Polish artist Celina Sunderland, then to Karolina Lentowa (née Meyer), and finally to Janina Magajewska (1915–1989). His daughter from his first marriage, Krystyna (born 1928), is a painter.

==Literary output==

&quot;Jan Brzechwa&quot; was the writer&#x27;s pseudonym. The name Brzechwa translates into &#x27;fletching&#x27; (the tail section of an arrow). His poetry was written mostly in the melodic style of the 8-syllable accentual verse, the most popular rhythmic structure among the Polish stylistic variations.

In 1926 he published &quot;Oblicza zmyślone&quot; (&quot;Imaginary visages&quot;), his first book of poems. His first set of poems for children &quot;Tańcowała igła z nitką&quot; (&quot;Danced the needle with the thread&quot;) was published in 1937. Among his most popular works is &quot;Chrząszcz&quot; (&quot;The Beetle&quot;), a poem proverbial for containing one the hardest-to-pronounce phrases in Polish literature. Its first line &quot;W Szczebrzeszynie chrząszcz brzmi w trzcinie&quot; (&quot;In the town of Szczebrzeszyn a beetle buzzes in the reeds&quot;) is the best known Polish tongue-twister, in which almost all of the consonants make distinct buzzing sounds. Brzechwa is also popular in Poland for having written a number of lyrical children&#x27;s poems. He was a translator of Russian literature, translating works by Aleksandr Pushkin, Sergey Yesienin and Vladimir Mayakovskiy.

Brzechwa also wrote a long-running series of children&#x27;s books based on the adventures of Pan Kleks, the headmaster of a magical academy, and his students. Many of the Kleks books and plot points were made into a series of films in the 1980s, while the poem &quot;Pchła Szachrajka&quot; (&quot;Adventures of a Cheating Flea&quot;) was developed into an animated film in 1989.

Many of Brzechwa&#x27;s texts have been translated into English by Walter Whipple, but as of 2004 they have yet to be published. Brzechwa died in Warsaw in 1966 and is buried at the Powązki Cemetery, the most famous cemetery in the city.

<text>Astara (; ) is a city in the Central District of Astara County, Gilan province, Iran, serving as the capital of both the county and the district. It lies on the border with the Republic of Azerbaijan and on the Caspian Sea. It is an important border trade center between Iran and the Caucasus.

== History ==
The earliest mention, under the name &quot;Astārāb&quot;, comes in the Ḥodūd al-ʿālam, written toward the end of the 10th century. In the 14th century, Astara became the seat of the small principality of the Esfahbad or Espahbad (-bod) of Gīlān. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, the Ṭālešī Khans of Āstārā were either autonomous or nominally subordinate to the governors of Gīlān or Ardabīl; on several occasions they played an important role in the history of the Caspian provinces. According to Minorsky, we do not know whether the later governors of Astara still continued the line of the Ispahbads. Even after the conquest of Northern Tālish by the Russians (1813) the family of the Tālish-khans retained certain rights.

Astara was part of the short lived Talysh Khanate in the 18th and 19th centuries, and for a short while it was the capital of the Khanate before it was moved to Lankaran. In 1828, with the signing of the Treaty of Turkmenchay, Astara was split into two. The city of Astara in Azerbaijan is located just across the Astarachay River.

<text>Domenico Allegri (c. 1585 – 5 September 1629) was an Italian composer and singer of the early Baroque Roman School. He was the second son of the Milanese coachman Costantino Allegri, who lived in Rome with his family, and was a younger brother of the more famous Gregorio Allegri. Costantino sent three sons, Gregorio, Domenico and Bartolomeo, to study music at San Luigi dei Francesi, under the &quot;maestro di capella&quot; Giovanni Bernardino Nanino, brother of Giovanni Maria Nanino. The little boy had as schoolmates his elder brother Gregorio and then Antonio Cifra, Domenico Massenzio and Paolo Agostini.

In 1606, Allegri was &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; of the church of Santa Maria at Spello, and from September 1609 until April 1610 served in the same role at the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere in Rome. From 3 April 1610 until his death, he held the same position at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, where he was buried.

Allegri is mainly famous for being one of the first to include specific instrumental accompaniments to sacred vocal music on a small scale. While much of his music is lost, one piece which has survived is the &quot;Modi quos expositis in choris&quot; of 1617 which has accompaniments to the voices by two violins.

<text>Christopher Knowles (born 1959) is an American poet and painter. He was born in New York City on May 4, 1959, and at an early age received a diagnosis of possible brain damage. He is often referred to as autistic. In 1976, his poetry was used by Robert Wilson for the avant-garde minimalist Philip Glass opera, &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;. Wilson described his discovery of the then 13-year-old Knowles, in the extended notes to the Tomato Records release of &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;:
Wilson cast the teenager Knowles in a number of his productions, including &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;.

In 1978, the American poet John Ashbery wrote in the magazine &quot;New York&quot; of a volume of Knowles&#x27;s poetry:

Early in 2013, Knowles presented several of his poems in a reading at Gavin Brown&#x27;s Enterprise in the West Village which had mounted an exhibition of his paintings. The same year, the Museum of Modern Art acquired several of Knowles&#x27; paintings, or rather &quot;typings&quot; or &quot;typed designs&quot; – pictures created with a typewriter and using colored ink to make patterns from letters and numbers. He starts creating the pictures by writing his signature and works his way up and to the left. Knowles said, he paints all the reds, then all the blues, and so on. One of his pictures consists only of the words &quot;John Simon pollute your anger&quot;, inspired by the art critic&#x27;s dismissive treatment of Robert Wilson (Simon had described Wilson as a charlatan and accused him of exploiting Knowles).

In 2015, Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia staged &quot;Christopher Knowles: In A Word&quot;—solo exhibition of work spanning Knowles&#x27; career. The exhibition traveled to the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston in 2017.

<doc id="884893" wikidata="Q5347761" url="?curid=884893" title="Calabaza">
<text>Calabaza is the generic name in the Spanish language for any type of winter squash. Within an English-language context it specifically refers to the West Indian pumpkin, a winter squash typically grown in the West Indies, tropical America, and the Philippines. Calabaza is the common name for &quot;Cucurbita moschata&quot; in Cuba, Florida, Puerto Rico, Mexico and the Philippines (where it is also spelled &quot;kalabasa&quot;). &quot;C. moschata&quot; is also known as &quot;auyama&quot; in Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Venezuela; &quot;ayote&quot; in Central America; &quot;zapallo&quot; in certain countries of South America; and &quot;pumpkin&quot;, &quot;squash&quot;, or &quot;calabash&quot; in English-speaking islands.

==Etymology==
The French term &quot;calebasse&quot;, and hence the English &quot;calabash&quot;, is based on the older Spanish. The spanish word is of pre-Roman origin. It comes from the Iberian &quot;calapaccu&quot;, from -cal which means house or shell. It is a doublet of carapace and galapago.

==Cultivars==
In North America, the Spanish word &quot;calabaza&quot; may refer to any of several species of squash of the genus &quot;Cucurbita&quot;. The term is most commonly used for cultivars of the species &quot;C. moschata&quot;, which is native to the Caribbean. The skin color typically varies from dark green to light yellow. The flesh can also vary in color, but most common is bright orange or yellow. Varieties differ somewhat in taste and texture, but are generally slightly sweet with a firm but soft texture. Cultivars of the species &quot;C. maxima&quot; may also use the term if they resemble the &quot;C. moschata&quot; cultivars, and widespread species &quot;C. foetidissima&quot; specifically identifies &quot;calabaza&quot; as one of its common names.

==Botanical description==
Calabaza plants are monoecious and are pollinated by insects like honeybees and bumblebees. The plants have long internodes and vines that are up to from the crown of the fruit to the plant. Most plants have vine-type growth; however, there are some &quot;Cucurbita moschata&quot; that are recorded to have bush-type growth. They typically yield between two and fifteen fruits, but the bush types provide higher yields. The fruit may weigh , and fruit shape varies from oval, spheroid, obovate, pear, oblate, to elliptic. Improved types tend to be spheroid, oblate or flat. The rind varies in color from a light to dark green when immature and a light orange to beige when mature, and can be smooth or warted. The inside flesh is green-yellow to orange in color and is about thick.

==Uses==

Calabaza is eaten many different ways, such as in stews, cakes, and candies. It can also be used in place of pumpkin varieties. The taste is smooth and somewhat sweet. Calabaza is a good source of beta-carotene, some of which can be converted into vitamin A.

Under Spanish colonial influence, &quot;C. moschata&quot; became established in the Philippines and is a staple vegetable used in a variety of dishes. It is known in Filipino as &quot;kalabasa&quot;, or in Philippine English as &quot;squash&quot; or &quot;pumpkin&quot;.

The flower (&quot;flor de calabaza&quot;) is used as an ingredient in quesadillas, empanadas and other dishes in Mexican cuisine and New Mexican cuisine, and in pupusas in Salvadoran cuisine. The flowers (&quot;bulaklak ng kalabasa&quot;) are also commonly eaten stuffed (&quot;relyeno&quot; or &quot;relleno&quot;), or as ingredients in soups in Philippine cuisine, along with young leaves (&quot;talbos ng kalabasa&quot;).

The seeds, toasted and seasoned, known as &quot;pepitas&quot;, are a common snack.

<doc id="884895" wikidata="Q820940" url="?curid=884895" title="Siyazan District">
<text>Siyazan District () is one of the 66 districts of Azerbaijan. It is located in the north-east of the country and belongs to the Guba-Khachmaz Economic Region. The district borders the districts of Shabran, Khizi, and the exclaves of Quba. Its capital and largest city is Siyazan. As of 2020, the district had a population of 42,600.

== Etymology ==
The name is believed to be derived from Persian, meaning &quot;White Women&quot;, a reference to the original inhabitants, Tats. Another theory links the name with the Persian word &quot;siyah&quot;, meaning &quot;black&quot;.

== History ==
The villages of Agh Siyazan (&quot;White Siyazan&quot;) and Gara Siyazan (&quot;Black Siyazan&quot;) formerly existed in the territory of the Siyazan District and the city was formerly called &quot;Gizilburun&quot; (). When the Baku-Shollar Pipeline was being constructed between 1911 and 1916, people started moving in from the surrounding villages as a labour force. The &quot;Gizilburun&quot; railway station also played a role in the transformation of these places into residential area.

Between 1938 and 1939, geologists discovered oil deposits in the Siyazan District. Subsequently, the first oil wells were drilled in the area, which attracted more people to move into the district.

The Siyazan District was part of the Absheron District until 11 February 1939, when it was combined with the neighbouring Khizi and Siyazan as a single district. Gizilburun, later renamed Siyazan in 1954, was its centre. However, in 1959 it was abolished and merged into the Shabran District. The district was re-established on 2 April 1992 by the order of Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan.

<text>In organic chemistry, an imide is a functional group consisting of two acyl groups bound to nitrogen. The compounds are structurally related to acid anhydrides, although imides are more resistant to hydrolysis. In terms of commercial applications, imides are best known as components of high-strength polymers, called polyimides. Inorganic imides are also known as solid state or gaseous compounds, and the imido group (=NH) can also act as a ligand.

==Nomenclature==
Most imides are cyclic compounds derived from dicarboxylic acids, and their names reflect the parent acid. Examples are succinimide, derived from succinic acid, and phthalimide, derived from phthalic acid. For imides derived from amines (as opposed to ammonia), the &quot;N&quot;-substituent is indicated by a prefix. For example, N-ethylsuccinimide is derived from succinic acid and ethylamine. Isoimides are isomeric with normal imides and have the formula RC(O)OC(NR′)R″. They are often intermediates that convert to the more symmetrical imides. Organic compounds called carbodiimides have the formula RN=C=NR. They are unrelated to imides.

===Imides from dicarboxylic acids===
The PubChem links gives access to more information on the compounds, including other names, ids, toxicity and safety.

==Properties==
Being highly polar, imides exhibit good solubility in polar media. The N–H center for imides derived from ammonia is acidic and can participate in hydrogen bonding. Unlike the structurally related acid anhydrides, they resist hydrolysis and some can even be recrystallized from boiling water.

==Occurrence and applications==
Many high strength or electrically conductive polymers contain imide subunits, i.e., the polyimides. One example is Kapton where the repeat unit consists of two imide groups derived from aromatic tetracarboxylic acids. Another example of polyimides is the polyglutarimide typically made from polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and ammonia or a primary amine by aminolysis and cyclization of the PMMA at high temperature and pressure, typically in an extruder. This technique is called reactive extrusion. A commercial polyglutarimide product based on the methylamine derivative of PMMA, called Kamax, was produced by the Rohm and Haas company. The toughness of these materials reflects the rigidity of the imide functional group.

Interest in the bioactivity of imide-containing compounds was sparked by the early discovery of the high bioactivity of the Cycloheximide as an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis in certain organisms. Thalidomide, famous for its adverse effects, is one result of this research. A number of fungicides and herbicides contain the imide functionality. Examples include Captan, which is considered carcinogenic under some conditions, and Procymidone.
In the 21st century new interest arose in thalidomide&#x27;s immunomodulatory effects, leading to the class of immunomodulators known as immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs).

==Preparation==
Most common imides are prepared by heating dicarboxylic acids or their anhydrides and ammonia or primary amines. The result is a condensation reaction:
: (RCO)2O + R′NH2 → (RCO)2NR′ + H2O
These reactions proceed via the intermediacy of amides. The intramolecular reaction of a carboxylic acid with an amide is far faster than the intermolecular reaction, which is rarely observed.

They may also be produced via the oxidation of amides, particularly when starting from lactams.
: R(CO)NHCH2R&#x27; + 2 [O] → R(CO)N(CO)R&#x27; + H2O

Certain imides can also be prepared in the isoimide-to-imide Mumm rearrangement.

==Reactions==
For imides derived from ammonia, the N–H center is weakly acidic. Thus, alkali metal salts of imides can be prepared by conventional bases such as potassium hydroxide. The conjugate base of phthalimide is potassium phthalimide. These anion can be alkylated to give &quot;N&quot;-alkylimides, which in turn can be degraded to release the primary amine. Strong nucleophiles, such as potassium hydroxide or hydrazine are used in the release step.

Treatment of imides with halogens and base gives the &quot;N&quot;-halo derivatives. Examples that are useful in organic synthesis are &quot;N&quot;-chlorosuccinimide and &quot;N&quot;-bromosuccinimide, which respectively serve as sources of &quot;Cl+&quot; and &quot;Br+&quot; in organic synthesis.

<doc id="884897" wikidata="Q145958" url="?curid=884897" title="Polyimide">
<text>Polyimide (sometimes abbreviated PI) is a polymer containing imide groups belonging to the class of high-performance plastics. With their high heat-resistance, polyimides enjoy diverse applications in roles demanding rugged organic materials, such as high temperature fuel cells, displays, and various military roles. A classic polyimide is Kapton, which is produced by condensation of pyromellitic dianhydride and 4,4&#x27;-oxydianiline.

==History==
The first polyimide was discovered in 1908 by Bogart and Renshaw. They found that 4-amino phthalic anhydride does not melt when heated but does release water upon the formation of a high molecular weight polyimide. The first semialiphatic polyimide was prepared by Edward and Robinson by melt fusion of diamines and tetra acids or diamines and diacids/diester.

However, the first polyimide of significant commercial importance - Kapton - was pioneered in the 1950s by workers at DuPont who developed a successful route for synthesis of high molecular weight polyimide involving a soluble polymer precursor. Up to today this route continues being the primary route for the production of most polyimides. Polyimides have been in mass production since 1955. The field of polyimides is covered by various extensive books and review articles.

==Classification==
According to the composition of their main chain, polyimides can be:
* Aliphatic,
* Semi-aromatic (also referred to as &quot;alipharomatic&quot;),
* Aromatic: these are the most used polyimides because of their thermostability.

According to the type of interactions between the main chains, polyimides can be:
* Thermoplastic: very often called &quot;pseudothermoplastic&quot;.
* Thermosetting: commercially available as uncured resins, polyimide solutions, stock shapes, thin sheets, laminates and machined parts.

==Synthesis==
Several methods are possible to prepare polyimides, among them:
* The reaction between a dianhydride and a diamine (the most used method).
* The reaction between a dianhydride and a diisocyanate.

The polymerization of a diamine and a dianhydride can be carried out by a two-step method in which a poly(amidocarboxylic acid) is prepared first, or directly by a one-step method. The two-step method is the most widely used procedure for polyimide synthesis. First a soluble poly(amidocarboxylic acid) (2) is prepared which is cyclized after further processing in a second step to the polyimide (3). A two-step process is necessary because the final polyimides are in most cases infusible and insoluble due to their aromatic structure.

Dianhydrides used as precursors to these materials include pyromellitic dianhydride, benzoquinonetetracarboxylic dianhydride and naphthalene tetracarboxylic dianhydride. Common diamine building blocks include 4,4&#x27;-diaminodiphenyl ether (DAPE), meta-phenylenediamine (MDA) and 3,3&#x27;-diaminodiphenylmethane. Hundreds of diamines and dianhydrides have been examined to tune the physical and especially the processing properties of these materials. These materials tend to be insoluble and have high softening temperatures, arising from charge-transfer interactions between the planar subunits.

===Analysis===
The imidization reaction can be followed via IR spectroscopy. The IR spectrum is characterized during the reaction by the disappearance of absorption bands of the poly(amic acid) at 3400 to 2700 cm−1 (OH stretch), ~1720 and 1660 (amide C=O) and ~1535 cm−1 (C-N stretch). At the same time, the appearance of the characteristic imide bands can be observed, at ~1780 (C=O asymm), ~1720 (C=O symm), ~1360 (C-N stretch) and ~1160 and 745 cm−1 (imide ring deformation).⁠　Detailed analyses of polyimide and carbonized polyimide and graphitized polyimide have been reported.

==Properties==
Thermosetting polyimides are known for thermal stability, good chemical resistance, excellent mechanical properties, and characteristic orange/yellow color. Polyimides compounded with graphite or glass fiber reinforcements have flexural strengths of up to and flexural moduli of . Thermoset polymer matrix polyimides exhibit very low creep and high tensile strength. These properties are maintained during continuous use to temperatures of up to and for short excursions, as high as . Molded polyimide parts and laminates have very good heat resistance. Normal operating temperatures for such parts and laminates range from cryogenic to those exceeding . Polyimides are also inherently resistant to flame combustion and do not usually need to be mixed with flame retardants. Most carry a UL rating of VTM-0. Polyimide laminates have a flexural strength half life at of 400 hours.

Typical polyimide parts are not affected by commonly used solvents and oils – including hydrocarbons, esters, ethers, alcohols and freons. They also resist weak acids but are not recommended for use in environments that contain alkalis or inorganic acids. Some polyimides, such as CP1 and CORIN XLS, are solvent-soluble and exhibit high optical clarity. The solubility properties lend them towards spray and low temperature cure applications.

==Applications==

=== Insulation and passivation films===
Polyimide materials are lightweight, flexible, resistant to heat and chemicals. Therefore, they are used in the electronics industry for flexible cables and as an insulating film on magnet wire. For example, in a laptop computer, the cable that connects the main logic board to the display (which must flex every time the laptop is opened or closed) is often a polyimide base with copper conductors. Examples of polyimide films include Apical, Kapton, UPILEX, VTEC PI, Norton TH and Kaptrex.
Polyimide is used to coat optical fibers for medical or high temperature applications.

An additional use of polyimide resin is as an insulating and passivation layer in the manufacture of Integrated circuits and MEMS chips. The polyimide layers have good mechanical elongation and tensile strength, which also helps the adhesion between the polyimide layers or between polyimide layer and deposited metal layer. The minimum interaction between the gold film and the polyimide film, coupled with high temperature stability of the polyimide film, results in a system that provides reliable insulation when subjected to various types of environmental stresses. Polyimide is also used as a substrate for cellphone antennas.

Multi-layer insulation used on spacecraft is usually made of polyimide coated with thin layers of aluminum, silver, gold, or germanium. The gold-colored material often seen on the outside of spacecraft is typically actually single aluminized polyimide, with the single layer of aluminum facing in. The yellowish-brown polyimide gives the surface its gold-like color.

=== Mechanical parts ===
Polyimide powder can be used to produce parts and shapes by sintering technologies (hot compression molding, direct forming, and isostatic pressing). Because of their high mechanical stability even at elevated temperatures they are used as bushings, bearings, sockets or constructive parts in demanding applications. To improve tribological properties, compounds with solid lubricants like graphite, PTFE, or molybdenum sulfide are common. Polyimide parts and shapes include P84 NT, VTEC PI, Meldin, Vespel, and Plavis.

=== Filters ===
In coal-fired power plants, waste incinerators, or cement plants, polyimide fibres are used to filter hot gases. In this application, a polyimide needle felt separates dust and particulate matter from the exhaust gas.

Polyimide is also the most common material used for the reverse osmotic film in purification of water, or the concentration of dilute materials from water, such as maple syrup production.

=== Flexible circuits ===
Polyimide is used as the core of flexible circuit boards and flat-flex cables. Flexible circuit boards are thin and can be placed in odd-shaped electronics.

=== Other ===
Polyimide is used for medical tubing, e.g. vascular catheters, for its burst pressure resistance combined with flexibility and chemical resistance.

The semiconductor industry uses polyimide as a high-temperature adhesive; it is also used as a mechanical stress buffer.

Some polyimide can be used like a photoresist; both &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; types of photoresist-like polyimide exist in the market.

The IKAROS solar sailing spacecraft uses polyimide resin sails to operate without rocket engines.

<text>Latrell Fontaine Sprewell (born September 8, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player who played for the Golden State Warriors, the New York Knicks, and the Minnesota Timberwolves in the National Basketball Association (NBA). During his career, Sprewell received four NBA All-Star selections, an All-NBA First Team selection, and an NBA All-Defensive Second Team selection. He helped the Knicks reach the 1999 NBA Finals and the Timberwolves to the 2004 Western Conference finals. Sprewell&#x27;s career was overshadowed by a 1997 incident in which he choked and punched then-Warriors coach P. J. Carlesimo during practice, which resulted in a 68-game suspension.

==Early life==
Sprewell attended Washington High School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

== College career ==
Sprewell played competitively with the Three Rivers Community College Raiders Basketball Team in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, from 1988 to 1990, and from 1990 to 1992 for the Alabama Crimson Tide, where he was a teammate of future NBA players Robert Horry, Jason Caffey, James Robinson, and Marcus Webb.

== Professional career ==

=== Golden State Warriors (1992–1998) ===

Sprewell was selected 24th overall in the 1992 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. Sprewell, nicknamed &quot;Spree&quot;, made an immediate impact, starting 69 of the 77 games he played in during his rookie season and averaging 15.4 points per game. He was a member of the NBA All-Rookie Second Team in 1993 and the NBA All-Defensive Second Team in 1994. His performance steadily improved, leading the team in scoring and representing the Western Conference in the 1994, 1995, and 1997 NBA All-Star Games. In 1993–1994 he led the league in games played and minutes per game as the Warriors, led by Sprewell and NBA Rookie of the Year power forward Chris Webber, made it back to the playoffs. They lost in the first round to the Phoenix Suns in three games.

====1997 choking incident====
On December 1, 1997, Sprewell attacked head coach P. J. Carlesimo during a Warriors practice in Oakland. When Carlesimo yelled at him to make crisper passes (specifically asking him to &quot;put a little mustard&quot; on a pass), Sprewell responded that he was not in the mood for criticism and told the coach to keep his distance. When Carlesimo approached, Sprewell threatened to kill him and dragged him backward by his throat, choking him for 7–10 seconds before his teammates and assistant coaches pulled him off Carlesimo. Sprewell returned about 20 minutes later after showering and changing and again accosted Carlesimo. He landed a glancing blow at Carlesimo&#x27;s right cheek before being dragged away again by the assistant coaches. This was not Sprewell&#x27;s first violent incident with the Warriors; in 1995, he fought with teammate Jerome Kersey, returned to practice carrying a two-by-four, and reportedly threatened to return with a gun. In a 1993 practice, Sprewell fought with Byron Houston, who was 50 pounds heavier than Sprewell and had what many teammates described as a Mike Tyson-like demeanor and physique.

Sprewell was initially suspended for 10 games without pay. The next day, in the wake of a public uproar, the Warriors voided the remainder of his contract, which included $23.7 million over three years, and the NBA suspended him for a year. Sprewell took the case to arbitration and the contract voiding was overturned, but the league suspended him for the rest of the season without pay, which amounted to 68 games. He sought to vacate the arbitration contract under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. His case went through all appeals, and was remanded. During the time he was serving his suspension, Sprewell was charged with reckless driving for his role in a 90-mile-per-hour accident that injured two people. He spent three months under house arrest as part of a no-contest plea.

Sprewell&#x27;s 68-game suspension was the second longest suspension ever issued by the NBA, only eclipsed by Ron Artest in 2004.

=== New York Knicks (1999–2003) ===

Due to the NBA lockout, Sprewell did not play again until February 1999, after the Warriors traded him to the New York Knicks for John Starks, Chris Mills, and Terry Cummings. Sprewell played 37 games for the Knicks that season, playing off the bench in all but four games.

Many pundits felt that trading for the allegedly volatile Sprewell was too big a gamble for the Knicks, but Sprewell vowed he was a changed man. The Knicks, who at the time still revolved around veteran All-Star center Patrick Ewing, narrowly qualified for the 1999 playoffs, making the field as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference. They navigated past the Miami Heat, Atlanta Hawks and Indiana Pacers, becoming the first eighth seed in NBA history to reach the Finals, where they met the San Antonio Spurs, who beat them in five games. Sprewell enjoyed a good series for the most part, averaging 26.0 ppg. He tallied 35 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in the Knicks&#x27; 78-77 Game 5 loss, and was featured on the cover of the September 1999 issue of &quot;SLAM Magazine&quot;.

Sprewell moved into the Knicks&#x27; starting lineup for the 1999–2000 season at small forward, and averaged 18.6 points, helping the Knicks to a 50–32 record, good enough for the third seed in the Eastern Conference, led by Sprewell, Ewing and shooting guard Allan Houston. The Knicks navigated past the Toronto Raptors in three hard-fought games and the Miami Heat in seven even harder-fought games in the first two rounds of the playoffs, en route to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers. But their quest for back-to-back NBA Finals appearances came to an end when they lost to the Pacers in 6 games in the Eastern Conference Finals. Sprewell averaged 19.7 ppg in the series, and the Knicks gave him a five-year $62 million contract extension.

The 2000–01 season saw Sprewell step up as the Knicks&#x27; leader with Ewing traded to the Seattle SuperSonics, making his only All-Star appearance for the Knicks that year, scoring 17.7 points. But despite another impressive season from Sprewell, the Knicks lost in the first round to the Toronto Raptors in five games in the playoffs. In 2001–02 Sprewell averaged 19.4 ppg, including 49 points in a game against the Boston Celtics, one of three times he scored 40 or more points that season; but the Knicks missed the playoffs for the first time in 15 years.

Before the 2002–03 season, Sprewell reported to training camp with a broken hand, which he claimed occurred when he slipped on his yacht; the Knicks fined him a record $250,000 for failing to report the incident. He then sued the &quot;New York Post&quot; for claiming he had broken his hand in a fight. Sprewell lost the lawsuit.

That season, Sprewell made NBA history as he hit 9 of 9 three-point shots in one game, making the most three-pointers without a single miss for the first time en route to a season-high 38 points versus the Los Angeles Clippers. The record has since been tied twice by Ben Gordon once as a Chicago Bull and once as a Detroit Piston. Later Knick Jalen Brunson also tied the record. After that season, in which the Knicks missed the playoffs for the second year in a row, Sprewell was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in a four-team trade involving Keith Van Horn, Glenn Robinson, and Terrell Brandon.

=== Minnesota Timberwolves (2003–2005) ===

In the 2003–04 season, Sprewell became part of the league&#x27;s highest-scoring trio alongside superstar power forward Kevin Garnett and point guard Sam Cassell. With a 58–24 record, the Timberwolves qualified for the 2004 playoffs as the top seed in the Western Conference. They navigated past the Denver Nuggets in five games and the Sacramento Kings in seven in the first two rounds of the playoffs. In the Western Conference Finals they met the Los Angeles Lakers, who defeated them in six games, the Timberwolves&#x27; only appearance in the conference finals until 2024. Sprewell finished third in team scoring at 16.8 ppg, behind Garnett&#x27;s 24.2 and Cassell&#x27;s 19.8.

On October 31, 2004, the Minnesota Timberwolves offered Sprewell a three-year, $21 million contract extension, a substantial pay cut. Claiming to feel insulted by the offer, he publicly expressed outrage, declaring, &quot;I have a family to feed.&quot; He declined the extension and the Timberwolves offered him nothing more. Having once more drawn the ire of fans and sports media, Sprewell had the worst season of his career in the final year of his contract. In the summer of 2005, the Denver Nuggets, Cleveland Cavaliers and Houston Rockets all expressed interest in signing Sprewell, but none ended up signing him. His final NBA game was on April 20, 2005 against the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs.

One month into the 2005–06 season and without a contract, Sprewell&#x27;s agent, Bob Gist, said his client would rather retire than play for the NBA minimum salary, telling &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Latrell doesn&#x27;t need the money that badly. To go from being offered $7 million to taking $1 million, that would be a slap in the face.&quot; Several days later, Gist said that Sprewell planned to wait until &quot;teams get desperate&quot; around the trade deadline in February, and then sign with a contending team—an eventuality that never materialized. Gist said that Sprewell would not be interested in signing for any team&#x27;s $5 million mid-level exception, calling that amount &quot;a level beneath which [Sprewell] would not stoop or kneel!&quot;

In March 2006, Sprewell was offered contracts by the Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs, both of which were considered at the time strong favorites to win the NBA Championship, but Sprewell failed to respond and remained a free agent as the season closed. The Los Angeles Lakers also showed some interest in him at the start of that season, but nothing came of it.

Over the course of his career, Sprewell started 868 of the 913 games he played in, averaging 18.8 ppg, 4.2 apg, and 4.1 rpg with playoff career averages of 19.7 ppg, 3.4 apg, and 4.3 rpg. He was an All-NBA First Team selection at the end of his second season and made the All-NBA Defensive second team that same season.

==Personal life==
In October 1994, Sprewell&#x27;s four-year old daughter was mauled in the family backyard by one of two pet pit bulls, having an ear bitten off and suffering bites to her face. Sprewell has nine children.

===Legal issues===
On August 30, 2006, Milwaukee police investigated a claim by a 21-year-old female that she and Sprewell were having consensual sex aboard his yacht when Sprewell began to strangle her. Police allegedly observed red marks on her neck. Police investigating the allegation searched Sprewell&#x27;s yacht for evidence. On September 6, police declined to press charges. Sprewell then sought a restraining order along with &quot;civil remedies&quot; against the accuser.

On January 31, 2007, Sprewell&#x27;s long-term companion sued him for $200 million for ending their relationship agreement. She claimed Sprewell agreed to support her and their four children through college.

On August 22, 2007, Sprewell&#x27;s $1.5 million yacht was repossessed by a federal marshal. He had failed to continue paying for and insuring the vessel, for which he reportedly still owed approximately $1.3 million. In February 2008, the yacht was auctioned for $856,000 after Sprewell defaulted on the mortgage. Three months later, a Milwaukee-area home Sprewell owned went into foreclosure status. In July 2009, a Westchester County, New York mansion Sprewell owned went into foreclosure status, but that action was dismissed on motion of another party&#x27;s attorney.

In 2011, Sprewell owed the state of Wisconsin $3.5 million in unpaid income taxes. On January 1, 2013, he was arrested for disorderly conduct after police received numerous complaints about loud music. 

As of 2022, Sprewell&#x27;s Instagram profile stated he was working in community relations with the Knicks and as a media personality for the Madison Square Garden.

<text>The Conejo Valley (Spanish: &quot;Valle del Conejo&quot;, meaning &quot;Valley of the Rabbit&quot;) is a region spanning both southeastern Ventura County and northwestern Los Angeles County in Southern California, United States. It is located in the northwestern part of the Greater Los Angeles area.

Communities in the Conejo Valley are Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park, Westlake Village, Oak Park, Agoura Hills, Lake Sherwood and a portion of Calabasas.

==Etymology==
In 1803, the Spanish land grant in the area was given the name Rancho El Conejo.

In Spanish, &quot;conejo&quot; means &quot;rabbit&quot;, and refers to the rabbits common to the region, specifically the desert cottontail and brush rabbit species.

==History==
===Pre-colonial===

The Chumash people inhabited region for thousands of years. Notable Chumash villages included Satwiwa (&quot;The Bluffs&quot;) in Newbury Park, Sap&#x27;wi (&quot;House of Deer&quot;) in Thousand Oaks, and Hipuk in Westlake Village. Sap&#x27;wi (Šihaw Ven-632i) is located near Chumash Indian Museum in Oakbrook Regional Park. This park is also home to 4-6,000 year old pictographs, which can be observed on docent-led tours. Satwiwa, which was first settled 13,000 years ago, was located at the foothills of Mount Boney, a sacred mountain to the Chumash people. The Satwiwa Native American Indian Culture Center is available for visitors.

Two additional Chumash villages were found by Ventu Park Road. These had a population of 100-200 in each village, and were settled around 2,000 years ago. These former villages, known as Ven-65, Ven-260 and Ven-261, are located on private lands near Ventu Park Road in Newbury Park. A smaller village, known as Yitimasɨh, was located where Wildwood Elementary School is located today. Artifacts retrieved in nearby Wildwood Regional Park include shell beads, arrowheads, and stone tools.

===European exploration===

Local villagers&#x27; first contact with Europeans came in 1770. The Spanish exploratory party led by Gaspar de Portolá, returning from its journey up the coast as far as San Francisco, entered the valley from the northwest. On the outward bound journey, the explorers had traveled up the Los Angeles River, then north to Castaic Junction, then followed the Santa Clara River back down to the coast. On the return trip, they sought a shorter route to the San Fernando Valley, and were guided by natives up and over the Conejo Grade. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi kept a diary of the expedition, and gave Conejo Valley one name that survives today – Triunfo (Spanish for &quot;triumph&quot;). Crespi gave the name &quot;El triunfo del Dulcísimo Nombre de Jesús&quot; (in English: &quot;The Triumph of the Sweetest Name of Jesus&quot;) to a camping place by a creek – today&#x27;s Triunfo Canyon Road begins between Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village.

Later, explorer Juan Bautista de Anza used Portolá&#x27;s shortcut on his way north in 1774, mentioning in his diary a stop at &quot;El Triunfo&quot;. On de Anza&#x27;s second expedition (1775–76), diarist Father Pedro Font referred to &quot;many watering places, like those of El Triunfo and Los Conejos&quot;.

===Ranching===
Harold and Edwin Janss purchased ten thousand acres (40 km²) of land of what is now central Thousand Oaks from the heir of John Edwards, who had purchased the land from the de la Guerra heirs (all of the land was originally a portion of the Rancho El Conejo land grant) in 1910. A ranch, named the Janss Conejo Ranch, was utilized as a farm and to raise thoroughbred horses with the Santa Susanna Mountains and Simi Hills framing it. Television Westerns such as &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, and &quot;Bonanza&quot; were filmed in Janss Conejo between the 1950s and 1960s. It was also used as the filming locations for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier&quot; and &quot;Westward Ho, the Wagons!&quot; both starring Fess Parker.

==Geography==

Conejo Valley is a valley. The area is bordered by the San Fernando Valley and the city of Los Angeles to the east, Simi Hills to the north, Las Posas Hills and the Santa Rosa Valley to the northwest, Conejo Mountain (also known as Conejo Hills) and Oxnard Plain to the west, and the Santa Monica Mountains to the south. The valley is located in the Santa Monica Mountains on an elevated area.

==Economy==
The largest non-retail employers in the Conejo Valley include Amgen, the Conejo Valley Unified School District, Los Robles Regional Medical Center, Anthem Blue Cross, California Lutheran University, Shire Biotechnology, Skyworks Solutions, PennyMac Mortgage and Sage Publications. Other notable employers include Jafra Cosmetics, Teledyne, J.D. Power, Dole Food Company, Guitar Center, Bank of America and Teradyne.

==Media==
The Ventura County Star is a daily newspaper published in Camarillo, California and serves all of Ventura County, including the Conejo Valley.

&quot;The Acorn&quot; is a local weekly newspaper covering Agoura Hills, Hidden Hills, Oak Park, North Ranch and Calabasas, while &quot;Thousand Oaks Acorn&quot; covers the cities of Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park and Westlake Village.

===Radio===
KCLU is the only public radio station in Ventura County.

==Tourism==
In 2013 the Conejo Valley Tourism Improvement District (CVTID) was formed by the cities of Thousand Oaks and Agoura Hills. CVTID is a non-profit corporation that markets Conejo Valley as a Tourist Destination. Conejo Valley&#x27;s two largest tourist attractions are the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley and the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.

<text>Zardab District () is one of the 66 districts of Azerbaijan. It is located in the centre of the country and belongs to the Central Aran Economic Region. The district borders the districts of Agdash, Ujar, Kurdamir, Imishli, Beylagan, Aghjabadi, and Barda. Its capital and largest city is Zardab. As of 2020, the district had a population of 59,300.

== Overview ==
The regional name Zardab is mentioned in historical publication dating back to the 16th century. As a raion, Zardab was established on February 5, 1935. Located in central Azerbaijan, the raion is 231 km to the west of the capital Baku. It is a part of the larger Arran economic region which also includes Agjabadi, Agdash, Beylagan, Barda, Bilasuvar, Goychay, Hajigabul, Imishli, Kurdamir, Neftchala, Saatli, Sabirabad, Salyan, Ujar raions. The raion lies in a lowland area, in some areas below sea level. The area is 860 km3. Zardab constitutes about 1% of the country and 4% of the Arran economic area.

=== Weather ===
The winters in Zardab are mild while the summers are hot with dry subtropic conditions. The temperature reaches 41–44 °C in the summer and +3 °C in the winter. Annual rainfall is 335 mm.

== Population ==
According to the State Statistics Committee, as of 2018, the population of city recorded 58,200 persons, which increased by 11,600 persons (about 19.9 percent) from 46,600 persons in 2000. 29,500 of total population are men, 29,300 are women. More than 26,2 percent of the population (about 15,300 persons) consists of young people and teenagers aged 14–29.

== Etymology ==
Zardab is a Persian word (زردآب &quot;Zardab&quot;) meaning Yellow Water. There are several interpretations of the translation. Some interpret Yellow Water as &quot;dirty water&quot; referring to the dirty debris left after historic floods of the Kura River which goes through the Zardab raion. These floods do not take place any more since the construction of Mingachevir reservoir which prevented the Kura river from overflowing. Another version states the term &quot;yellow&quot; refers to the golden colour. That is, after the floods, the overflown river used to deliver the water necessary for arrogation, therefore making it as precious as gold. And finally, the third version states the reference is made to the second interpretation of the word &quot;Zard&quot; which also means &quot;eatable bird&quot; which in turn refers to the Zərd-əncirquşu birds which are in Zardab&#x27;s habitat.

<text>Build–operate–transfer (BOT) or build–own–operate–transfer (BOOT) is a form of project delivery method, usually for large-scale infrastructure projects, wherein a private entity receives a concession from the public sector (or the private sector on rare occasions) to finance, design, construct, own, and operate a facility stated in the concession contract. The private entity will have the right to operate it for a set period of time. This enables the project proponent to recover its investment and operating and maintenance expenses in the project.

BOT is usually a model used in public–private partnerships. Due to the long-term nature of the arrangement, the fees are usually raised during the concession period. The rate of increase is often tied to a combination of internal and external variables, allowing the proponent to reach a satisfactory internal rate of return for its investment.

Countries where BOT is prevalent include Thailand, Turkey, Taiwan, Bahrain, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Israel, India, Iran, Croatia, Japan, China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Egypt, Myanmar and a few US states (California, Florida, Indiana, Texas, and Virginia). However, in some countries, such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Nepal, the term used is build–own–operate–transfer (BOOT).
The first BOT was for the China Hotel, built in 1979 by the Hong Kong listed conglomerate Hopewell Holdings Ltd (controlled by Sir Gordon Wu).

==BOT framework==

BOT finds extensive application in infrastructure projects and public–private partnership. In the BOT framework a third party, for example the public administration, delegates to a private sector entity to design and build infrastructure and to operate and maintain these facilities for a certain period. During this period, the private party has the responsibility to raise the finance for the project and is entitled to retain all revenues generated by the project and is the owner of the regarded facilities. The facility will be then transferred to the public administration at the end of the concession agreement, without any remuneration of the private entity involved. 
Some or even all of the following different parties could be involved in any BOT project:
*The host government: Normally, the government is the initiator of the infrastructure project and decides if the BOT model is appropriate to meet its needs. In addition, the political and economic circumstances are main factors for this decision. The government provides normally support for the project in some form (provision of the land/ changed laws).
*The concessionaire: The project sponsors who act as concessionaire create a special purpose entity which is capitalised through their financial contributions.
*Lending banks: Most BOT projects are funded to a big extent by commercial debt. The bank will be expected to finance the project on &quot;non-recourse&quot; basis meaning that it has recourse to only the special purpose entity and all its assets for the repayment of the debt.
*Other lenders: The special purpose entity might have other lenders such as national or regional development banks.
*Parties to the project contracts: Because the special purpose entity has only limited workforce, it will subcontract a third party to perform its obligations under the concession agreement. Additionally, it has to assure that it has adequate supply contracts in place for the supply of raw materials and other resources necessary for the project.
A BOT project is typically used to develop a discrete asset rather than a whole network and is generally entirely new or greenfield in nature (although refurbishment may be involved). In a BOT project the project company or operator generally obtains its revenues through a fee charged to the utility/ government rather than tariffs charged to consumers. A number of projects are called concessions, such as toll road projects, which are new build and have a number of similarities to BOTs.

In general, a project is financially viable for the private entity if the revenues generated by the project cover its cost and provide sufficient return on investment. On the other hand, the viability of the project for the host government depends on its efficiency in comparison with the economics of financing the project with public funds. Even if the host government could borrow money on better conditions than a private company could, other factors could offset this particular advantage. For example, the expertise and efficiency that the private entity is expected to bring as well as the risk transfer. Therefore, the private entity bears a substantial part of the risk. These are some types of the most common risks involved: 
*Political risk: especially in the developing countries because of the possibility of dramatic overnight political change.
*Technical risk: construction difficulties, for example unforeseen soil conditions, breakdown of equipment
*Financing risk: foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate fluctuation, market risk (change in the price of raw materials), income risk (over-optimistic cash-flow forecasts), cost overrun risk

==Alternatives to BOT==
The scale of investment by the private sector and type of arrangement means there is typically no strong incentive for early completion of a project or to deliver a product at a reasonable price. This type of private sector participation is also known as design-build.

Modified versions of the &quot;turnkey&quot; procurement and BOT &quot;build-operate-transfer&quot; models exist for different types of public-private partnership (PPP) projects, in which the main contractor is appointed to design and construct the works. This contrasts with the traditional procurement route (the build-design model), where the client first appoints consultants to design the development and then a contractor to construct the work.

The private contractor designs and builds a facility for a fixed fee, rate, or total cost, which is one of the key criteria in selecting the winning bid. The contractor assumes the risks involved in the design and construction phases.

Turnkey procurement under a design-build contract means that the design-build team would serve as the owner’s representative to determine the specific needs of the user groups; meet with the vendors to select the best options and pricing; advise the owner on the most logical options; plan and build the spaces to accommodate the function of the project; coordinate purchases and timelines; install the infrastructure; facilitate training of staff to use the equipment; and outline care and maintenance. In addition to being responsible for the design and construction of the work to the employer’s requirements, the contractor is also responsible for operating and maintaining the completed facility. The operation and maintenance period will span decades, during which time the contractor is said to have the &quot;concession,&quot; is responsible for the operation of the facility, and benefits from operational income. The facility itself, however, remains the property of the employer. 

A DBO(design-build-operate) contract is a project delivery model in which a single contractor is appointed to design and build a project and then to operate it for a period of time.

The common form of such a contract is a PPP (public-private partnership), in which a public client (e.g., a government or public agency) enters into a contract with a private contractor to design, build, and then operate the project, while the client finances the project and retains ownership.

DBFO stands for design-build-finance-operate, which also assigns the responsibility to the private organization to design, build, finance, and operate. Financing your competitive project may be easy when there is a high demand for a service right now, and investors will throw money at any project that claims the spoils, such as opening a new airport in a busy metropolis.

BLT stands for build-lease-transfer, in which the public sector partner leases the project from the contractor and also takes responsibility for its operation.

ROT (renovate-operate-transfer) is a procurement method for infrastructure that already exists but is performing substandardly.

As you know, when essential services are no longer operating efficiently or effectively, repairs can be costly. When an obsolete facility or amenity (any public service such as telephone lines, etc.) becomes outdated and requires expensive repairs, it can be financed through public-private partnerships between public entities and private contractors that are able to provide renovation services and operate the project management after the repairs have been completed.

== Economic theory ==
In contract theory, several authors have studied the pros and cons of bundling the building and operating stages of infrastructure projects. In particular, Oliver Hart (2003) has used the incomplete contracting approach in order to investigate whether incentives to make non-contractible investments are smaller or larger when the different stages of the project are combined under one private contractor. Hart (2003) argues that under bundling incentives to make cost-reducing investments are larger than under unbundling. However, sometimes the incentives to make cost-reducing investments may be excessive because they lead to overly large reductions of quality, so it depends on the details of the project whether bundling or unbundling is optimal. Hart&#x27;s (2003) work has been extended in many directions. For example, Bennett and Iossa (2006) and Martimort and Pouyet (2008) investigate the interaction of bundling and ownership rights, while Hoppe and Schmitz (2013, 2021) explore the implications of bundling for making innovations.

<text>Calabash (; &quot;Lagenaria siceraria&quot;), also known as bottle gourd, white-flowered gourd, long melon, birdhouse gourd, New Guinea bean, New Guinea butter bean, Tasmania bean, and opo squash, is a vine grown for its fruit. It can be either harvested young to be consumed as a vegetable, or harvested mature to be dried and used as a utensil, container, or a musical instrument. When it is fresh, the fruit has a light green smooth skin and white flesh.

Calabash fruits have a variety of shapes: they can be huge and rounded, small and bottle-shaped, or slim and serpentine, and they can grow to be over a metre long. Rounder varieties are typically called calabash gourds. The gourd was one of the world&#x27;s first cultivated plants grown not primarily for food, but for use as containers. The bottle gourd may have been carried from Asia to Africa, Europe, and the Americas in the course of human migration, or by seeds floating across the oceans inside the gourd. It has been proven to have been globally domesticated (and existed in the New World) during the Pre-Columbian era.

There is sometimes confusion when discussing &quot;calabash&quot; because the name is shared with the unrelated calabash tree (&quot;Crescentia cujete&quot;), whose hard, hollow fruits are also used to make utensils, containers, and musical instruments.

== Etymology ==
The English word &quot;calabash&quot; is loaned from , which in turn derived from meaning gourd or pumpkin. The Spanish word is of pre-Roman origin. It comes from the , from -cal which means house or shell. It is a doublet of carapace and galapago. The English word is cognate with (&quot;pumpkin; orange colour&quot;), (&quot;gourd, pumpkin, squash; calabash (container)&quot;), , , , (&quot;gourd; calabash (container)&quot;) and (and ).

== History ==

The bottle gourd has been recovered from archaeological contexts in China and Japan dating to c. 8,000–9,000 BP, whereas in Africa, despite decades of high-quality archaeobotanical research, the earliest record of its occurrence remains the 1884 report of a bottle gourd being recovered from a 12th Dynasty tomb at Thebes dating to ca. 4,000 BP. When considered together, the genetic and archaeological information points toward &quot;L. siceraria&quot; being independently brought under domestication first in Asia, and more than 4,000 years later, in Africa.
The bottle gourd is a commonly cultivated plant in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, and was eventually domesticated in southern Africa. Stands of &quot;L. siceraria&quot;, which may be source plants and not merely domesticated stands, were reported in Zimbabwe in 2004. This apparent wild plant produces thinner-walled fruit that, when dried, would not endure the rigors of use on long journeys as a water container. Today&#x27;s gourd may owe its tough, waterproof wall to selection pressures over its long history of domestication.

Gourds were cultivated in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas for thousands of years before Columbus&#x27; arrival to the Americas. Polynesian specimens of calabash were found to have genetic markers suggesting hybridization from Asian and American cultivars. In Europe, Walahfrid Strabo (808–849), abbot and poet from Reichenau and advisor to the Carolingian kings, discussed the gourd in his &quot;Hortulus&quot; as one of the 23 plants of an ideal garden.

The mystery of the bottle gourd – namely that this African or Eurasian species was being grown in the Americas over 8,000 years ago – comes from the difficulty in understanding how it arrived in the Americas. The bottle gourd was theorized to have drifted across the Atlantic Ocean from Africa to South America, but in 2005 a group of researchers suggested that it may have been domesticated earlier than food crops and livestock and, like dogs, was brought into the New World at the end of the ice age by the native hunter-gatherer Paleo-Indians, which they based on a study of the genetics of archaeological samples. This study purportedly showed that gourds in American archaeological finds were more closely related to Asian variants than to African ones.

In 2014 this theory was repudiated based on a more thorough genetic study. Researchers more completely examined the plastid genomes of a broad sample of bottle gourds, and concluded that North and South American specimens were most closely related to wild African variants and could have drifted over the ocean several or many times, as long as 10,000 years ago.

== Cultivation ==
Bottle gourds are grown by direct sowing of seeds or transplanting 15- to 20-day-old seedlings. The plant prefers well-drained, moist, organic rich soil. It requires plenty of moisture in the growing season and a warm, sunny position, sheltered from the wind. It can be cultivated in small places such as in a pot, and allowed to spread on a trellis or roof. In rural areas, many houses with thatched roofs are covered with the gourd vines. Bottle gourds grow very rapidly and their stems can reach a length of 9 m in the summer, so they need a solid support along the stem if they are to climb a pole or trellis. If planted under a tall tree, the vine may grow up to the top of the tree. To obtain more fruit, farmers sometimes cut off the tip of the vine when it has grown to 6–8 feet in length. This forces the plant to produce side branches that will bear flowers and yield more fruit.

The plant produces night blooming white flowers. The male flowers have long peduncles and the females have short ones with an ovary in the shape of the fruit. Sometimes the female flowers drop off without growing into a gourd due to the failure of pollination if there is no night pollinator (probably a kind of moth) in the garden. Hand pollination can be used to solve the problem. Pollens are around 60 microns in length.

First crop is ready for harvest within two months; first flowers open in about 45 days from sowing. Each plant can yield 1 fruit per day for the next 45 days if enough nutrients are available.

Yield ranges from 35 to 40 tons/ha, per season of 3 months cycle.

== Toxicity ==
Like other members of the family Cucurbitaceae, gourds contain cucurbitacins that are known to be cytotoxic at a high concentration. The tetracyclic triterpenoid cucurbitacins present in fruits and vegetables of the cucumber family are responsible for the bitter taste, and could cause stomach ulcers. In extreme cases, people have died from drinking the juice of gourds.
The toxic cases are usually due to the gourd being used to make juice, which the drinkers described as being unusually bitter. In three of the lethal cases, the victims were diabetics in their 50s and 60s. In 2018, a healthy woman in her 40s was hospitalized for severe reactions after consuming the juice and died three days later from complications.

The plant is not normally toxic when eaten. The excessively bitter (and toxic) gourds are due to improper storage (temperature swings or high temperature) and over-ripening.

==Nutrition==
Boiled calabash is 95% water, 4% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a reference amount of , cooked calabash supplies a moderate amount of vitamin C (10% of the Daily Value), with no other micronutrients in significant amounts (table).

== Culinary uses ==
=== Central America ===
In Central America the seeds of the bottle gourd are toasted and ground with other ingredients (including rice, cinnamon, and allspice) to make one type of the drink &quot;horchata&quot;.

=== East Asia ===
==== China ====
The calabash is frequently used in southern Chinese cuisine in either a stir-fry dish or a soup.

==== Japan ====

In Japan, it is commonly sold in the form of dried, marinated strips known as &quot;kanpyō&quot; and is used as an ingredient for making &quot;makizushi&quot; (rolled sushi).

==== Korea ====
Traditionally in Korea, the inner flesh has been eaten as &quot;namul&quot; vegetable and the outside cut in half to make bowls. Both fresh and dried flesh of &quot;bak&quot; is used in Korean cuisine. Fresh calabash flesh, scraped out, seeded, salted and squeezed to draw out moisture, is called &quot;baksok&quot;. Scraped and sun-dried calabash flesh, called &quot;bak-goji&quot;, is usually soaked before being stir-fried. Soaked &quot;bak-goji&quot; is often simmered in sauce or stir-fried before being added to &quot;japchae&quot; and gimbap. Sometimes uncooked raw &quot;baksok&quot; is seasoned to make &quot;saengchae&quot;.

=== Southeast Asia ===

==== Burma ====
In Burma, it is a popular fruit. The young leaves are also boiled and eaten with a spicy, fermented fish sauce. It can also be cut up, coated in batter and deep fried to make fritters, which are eaten with Burmese mohinga.

==== Philippines ====
In the Philippines, calabash (known locally as ) is commonly cooked in soup dishes like tinola. They are also common ingredients in noodle (&quot;pancit&quot;) dishes.
==== Vietnam ====
In Vietnam, it is a very popular vegetable, commonly cooked in soup with shrimp, meatballs, clams, various fish like freshwater catfish or snakehead fish or crab. It is also commonly stir-fried with meat or seafood, or incorporated as an ingredient of a hotpot. It is also used as a medicine. Americans have called calabashes from Vietnam &quot;opo squash&quot;.

The shoots, tendrils, and leaves of the plant may also be eaten as greens.

=== South Asia ===
==== India ====
A popular north Indian dish is &quot;lauki chana&quot;, (&quot;chana dal&quot; and diced gourd in a semi-dry gravy). In the state of Maharashtra in India, a similar preparation called &quot;dudhi chana&quot; is popular. The skin of the vegetable is used in making a dry spicy chutney preparation. It is consumed in Assam with fish curry, as boiled vegetable curry and also fried with potato and tomatoes. &quot;Lauki kheer&quot; (grated bottle gourd, sugar and milk preparation) is a dessert from Telangana, usually prepared for festive occasions. In Andhra Pradesh it is called &quot;sorakaya&quot; and is used to make &quot;sorakaya pulusu&quot; (with tamarind juice), &quot;sorakaya palakura&quot; (curry with milk and spices) and &quot;sorakaya pappu&quot; (with lentils). &quot;Lau chingri&quot;, a dish prepared with bottle gourd and prawn, is popular in West Bengal. The edible leaves and young stems of the plant are widely used in Bengali cuisine. Although popularly called &quot;lauki&quot; in Hindi in northern part of the country, it is also called &quot;kaddu&quot; in certain parts of country like eastern India. (However, &quot;kaddu&quot; popularly translates to &quot;pumpkin&quot; in northern India.) It can be consumed as a dish with rice or roti for its medicinal benefits. In Gujarat, a traditional Gujarati savoury cake called handvo is made primarily using bottle gourd (in Gujarati, &quot;dudhi&quot;), sesame seeds, flour, and often lentils. In Karnataka, bottle gourd is called &quot;Sorekayi&quot; and is used to prepare &quot;palya&quot; (stir-fry) and &quot;Sambaru&quot; (a south Indian stew). Also, crispy &quot;sorekayi dosé&quot; (dosa) is one of the popular breakfasts in Karnataka.

==== Bangladesh ====
In Bangladesh the fruit is served with rice as a common dish.

==== Nepal ====
In Nepal, in the Madheshi southern plains, preparations other than as a normal vegetable include &quot;halva&quot; and &quot;khichdi&quot;.

==== Pakistan ====
In Pakistan, the calabash is cultivated on a large scale as its fruit are a popular vegetable.

==== Sri Lanka ====
In Sri Lanka, it is used in combination with rice to make a variety of milk rice, which is a popular dish in Sri Lanka. Different types of curries are also made using this, specially white curries with coconut milk.

=== Europe ===

==== Italy ====
In Southern Italy and Sicily, the variety Lagenaria siceraria var. longissima, called zucca da vino, zucca bottiglia, or cucuzza, is grown and used in soup or along with pasta.

In Sicily, mostly in the Palermo area, a traditional soup called &quot;Minestra di Tenerumi&quot; is made with the tender leaves of var. Longissima along with peeled tomato and garlic. The young leaves are themselves called &quot;tenerumi&quot;, and Lagenaria in Sicily is cultivated both professionally and in home orchards mostly to use the leaves as a vegetable, the fruit being treated almost as a secondary product.

It is also grown by the Italian diaspora.

== Cultural uses ==

=== Africa ===
Hollowed-out and dried calabashes are a very typical utensil in households across West Africa. They are used to clean rice, carry water, and as food containers. Smaller sizes are used as bowls to drink palm wine. Calabashes are used in making the West African instruments like the Ṣẹ̀kẹ̀rẹ̀, a Yoruba instrument similar to a maraca, &quot;kora&quot; (a harp-lute), &quot;xalam&quot;/&quot;ngoni&quot; (a lute) and the &quot;goje&quot; (a traditional fiddle). They also serve as resonators underneath the &quot;balafon&quot; (West African marimba). The calabash is also used in making the &quot;shegureh&quot; (a Sierra Leonean women&#x27;s rattle) and &quot;balangi&quot; (a Sierra Leonean type of&quot; balafon&quot;) musical instruments. Sometimes large calabashes are simply hollowed, dried and used as percussion instruments by striking them, especially by Fulani, Songhai, Gur-speaking and Hausa peoples. In Nigeria the calabash has been used by some motorcyclists as an imitation helmet in an attempt to circumvent motorcycle helmet laws. In South Africa it is commonly used as a drinking vessel and a vessel for carrying food by communities, such as the Bapedi and AmaZulu. Erbore children of Ethiopia wear hats made from the calabash to protect them from the sun. South Africa&#x27;s FNB Stadium, which hosted the 2010 FIFA World Cup, is known as The Calabash as its shape takes inspiration from the calabash. The calabash is also used in the manufacture of puppets.

Calabash also has a large cultural significance. In many African legends, Calabash (commonly referred to as gourds) are presented as a vessel for knowledge and wisdom.

=== China ===
The &quot;húlu&quot; (/), as the calabash is called in Mandarin Chinese&quot;,&quot; is an ancient symbol for health. Hulu had fabled healing properties due to doctors in former times carrying medicine inside it. The &quot;hulu&quot; was believed to absorb negative, earth-based &quot;qi&quot; (energy) that would otherwise affect health, and is a traditional Chinese medicine cure. The bottle gourd is a symbol of the Eight Immortals, and particularly Li Tieguai, who is associated with medicine. Li Tieguai&#x27;s gourd was said to carry medicine that could cure any illness and never emptied, which he dispensed to the poor and needy. Some folk myths say the &quot;gourd had spirals of smoke ascend from it, denoting his power of setting his spirit free from his body,&quot; and that it &quot;served as a bedroom for the night...&quot; The gourd is also an attribute of the deity Shouxing and a symbol of longevity.

Dried calabash were also used as containers for liquids, often liquors or medicines. Calabash gourds were also grown in earthen molds to form different shapes with imprinted floral or arabesque designs. Molded gourds were also dried to house pet crickets. The texture of the gourd lends itself nicely to the sound of the insect, much like a musical instrument. The musical instrument, &quot;hulusi&quot;, is a kind of flute made from the gourd.

=== Jewish culture ===
In the Safaradi Jewish culture, the gourd is eaten during Rosh Hashana (Jewish New Year&#x27;s Eve). According to the texts the gourd is eaten as a symbol of tearing apart the enemies who may come and attack. It is called Qaraa, which in Hebrew means &quot;torn&quot; קרע. 
&quot;שיקרעו אויבנו מעלינו&quot; meaning &quot;may our enemies be torn apart over from us&quot;.

=== Polynesia ===
The plant is spread throughout Polynesia known by &quot;hue&quot; in many related languages.

In Hawaii the word &quot;calabash&quot; refers to a large serving bowl, usually made from hardwood rather than from the calabash gourd, which is used on a buffet table or in the middle of the dining table. The use of the calabash in Hawaii has led to terms like &quot;calabash family&quot; or &quot;calabash cousins&quot;, indicating an extended family grown up around shared meals and close friendships. This gourd is often dried when ripe and used as a percussion instrument called an &quot;ipu heke&quot; (double gourd drum) or just Ipu in contemporary and ancient hula.

The Māori people of New Zealand grew several cultivars of calabash for particular uses like &quot;ipu kai&quot; cultivars as food containers and &quot;tahā wai&quot; cultivars as water gourds. They believed the gourd as a representation of Pū-tē-hue, one of Tāne (their god of forests)&#x27;s offspring. Several types of taonga pūoro (musical instruments) are made from gourds, including types of flute (ororuarangi, kōauau ponga ihu) and shakers (hue rarā, hue puruwai).

===India===
The calabash is used as a resonator in many string instruments in India. Instruments that look like guitars are made of wood, but can have a calabash resonator at the end of the strings table, called &quot;toomba&quot;. The &quot;sitar&quot;, the &quot;surbahar&quot;, the &quot;tanpura&quot; (north of India, &quot;tambura&quot; south of India), may have a &quot;toomba&quot;. In some cases, the &quot;toomba&quot; may not be functional, but if the instrument is large, it is retained because of its balance function, which is the case of the &quot;Saraswati veena&quot;. Other instruments like &quot;rudra veena&quot; and &quot;vichitra veena&quot; have two large calabash resonators at both ends of the strings table. The instrument, Gopichand used by the Baul singers of Bengal is made out of calabash. The practice is also common among Buddhist and Jain sages.

These &quot;toombas&quot; are made of dried calabash gourds, using special cultivars that were originally imported from Africa and Madagascar. They are mostly grown in Bengal and near Miraj, Maharashtra. These gourds are valuable items and they are carefully tended; for example, they are sometimes given injections to stop worms and insects from making holes in them while they are drying.

Hindu ascetics (&quot;sadhu&quot;) traditionally use a dried gourd vessel called the &quot;kamandalu&quot;. The juice of a bottle gourd is considered to have medicinal properties and be very healthy (see juice toxicity above).

In parts of India a dried, unpunctured gourd is used as a float (called &quot;surai-kuduvai&quot; in Tamil) to help people learn to swim in rural areas.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, dried calabash gourds are one common material for making a traditional &quot;salakot&quot; hat.

In 2012, Teófilo García of Abra in Luzon, an expert artisan who makes the Ilocano &quot;tamburaw&quot; variant using calabash, was awarded by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts with the &quot;Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan&quot; (National Living Treasures Award). He was cited for his dedication to practising and teaching the craft as an intangible cultural heritage of the Philippines under the Traditional Craftsmanship category.
=== New Guinea ===
Among some New Guinea highland tribes, the calabash is used by men as a penis sheath.

=== South America ===
In Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile and southern Brazil, calabash gourds are dried and carved into &quot;mates&quot; (from the Quichua word &quot;mathi&quot;, adopted into the Spanish language), the traditional container for mate, the caffeinated, tea-like drink brewed from the yerba mate plant. In the region the beverage itself is called &quot;mate&quot; as well as the calabash from which the drinking vessels are made. In Peru it is used in a popular practice for the making of mate burilado; &quot;&quot;burilado&quot; is the technique adopted for decorating the &quot;mate&quot; calabashes.

In Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador calabash gourds are used for medicinal purposes. The Inca culture applied symbols from folklore to gourds, this practice is still familiar and valued.

=== North America ===
Calabash&#x27;s watertight features allowed it to be often used as container to ship seeds across the translantic slave trade. They were also used by enslaved people to carry seeds for planting on plantation fields. On plantations that held enslaved African Americans, the Calabash symbolized freedom—as alluded to in the song &quot;Follow the Drinking Gourd&quot; that referenced the Big Dipper constellation that was used to guide the Underground Railroad.

== Other uses ==
=== Tobacco smoking pipe ===

The gourd can be dried and used to smoke pipe tobacco. According to American consular reports from the early 20th century calabash pipes were commonly used in South Africa. Calabash was said to bestow a &quot;special softness&quot; of flavor that could not be duplicated by other materials. The lining was made of meerschaum, though tin was used for low-grade models. A typical design yielded by this squash is recognized (theatrically) as the pipe of Sherlock Holmes, but the inventor of this character, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, never mentioned Holmes using a calabash pipe. It was the preferred pipe for stage actors portraying Holmes, because they could balance this pipe better than other styles while delivering their lines.

=== Enema equipment ===
The gourd is used traditionally to administer enemas. Along the upper Congo River an enema apparatus is made by making a hole in one end of the gourd for filling it, and using a resin to attach a hollow cane to the gourd&#x27;s neck.

<text>Miss USA is an American beauty pageant that has been held annually since 1952 to select the entrant from United States in the Miss Universe pageant. The Miss Universe Organization operated both pageants, as well as Miss Teen USA, until 2020, when the organization announced it was licensing operation of the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants to Crystle Stewart, Miss USA for 2008 prior to her suspension in October 2022, thus returning the said pageants to the Miss Universe Organization. The pageants are now operated by Laylah Rose. 

The pageant was owned by Donald Trump from 1996 to 2015 and was previously broadcast on NBC. In September 2015, WME/IMG purchased the pageant from Trump. In 2020, for the first time, the FYI network broadcast the competition. In October 2022, JKN Global Group acquired the pageant from WME/IMG. It is currently broadcast on The CW.

The current reigning Miss USA is Alma Cooper of Michigan, who won the title on August 4, 2024 at the Peacock Theater, in Los Angeles, California.

==History==
The Miss USA pageant was conceived in 1950 when Yolande Betbeze, winner of the Miss America pageant, refused to pose for publicity pictures while wearing a swimsuit. Pageant sponsor Catalina decided to pull their sponsorship of the pageant and create their own competition. Other owners have included a subsidiary of Gulf+Western Industries, Procter &amp; Gamble under division of Madison Square Productions and Donald Trump.

The first Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants were held concurrently in Long Beach, California, in 1952; the first Miss USA winner was Miss New York USA Jackie Loughery. There were 30 delegates in the first year of competition. Many states did not compete every year during the first two decades of the pageant&#x27;s history. Since the 1970s, each state and the District of Columbia have sent a delegate each year. Alaska first competed in 1959 and Hawaii in 1960. Both had competed at Miss Universe until this time.

The pageant aired on CBS from 1963 until 2002 and for many years was known for having a CBS game show host as pageant host. The show&#x27;s highest ratings were in the early 1980s when it regularly topped the Nielsen ratings. Viewership dropped sharply from the 1990s to the 2000s, from an estimated viewership of 20 million to an average of 7 million from 2000 to 2001. In 2002, then-owner Donald Trump brokered a deal with NBC, giving it half-ownership of the Miss USA, Miss Universe, and Miss Teen USA pageants and moving them to the network on an initial five-year contract. The pageant first aired on NBC in 2003.

The Miss USA title winner historically represented the U.S. in its sister pageant, Miss Universe. Since its inception, nine Miss USA titleholders have gone on to win Miss Universe. In the mid-1960s, the organization established a rule that when a Miss USA wins the Miss Universe title, the first runner-up assumes the Miss USA title for the remainder of the year. This occurred in 1980, 1995, 1997, 2012, and 2022. In 1967, the first runner-up Susan Bradley of California declined the title and the crown went to the second runner-up Cheryl Patton of Florida. The only instance when a first runner-up assumed the title of Miss USA before this period was in 1957, when Mary Leona Gage of Maryland resigned after it was discovered she was married.

The winner is assigned a one-year contract with the Miss Universe Organization, traveling across the United States and sometimes overseas to spread messages about their chosen causes. Aside from the job, the winner also receives a cash allowance for her entire reign, a modeling portfolio, beauty products, clothes, shoes, styling, healthcare, and fitness services from different pageant sponsors. She also gains exclusive access to events such as fashion shows and opening galas, as well as access to casting calls and modeling opportunities throughout New York City. When Donald Trump owned the pageant, the winner was given the use of a Trump Place apartment in New York City during her reign, which she shared with the Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA titleholders.

If the winner cannot fulfill her duties as Miss USA for any reason, including if she wins the Miss Universe title, her 1st runner-up takes over.

After losing its television partners, it was announced that Miss USA 2015 would be streamed on the pageant&#x27;s website. Shortly before the pageant, however, Reelz Channel announced that it would broadcast Miss USA 2015.

In September 2015, IMG acquired the Miss Universe Organization for an undisclosed amount. The company had previously been involved in licensing and production for the events. The following month, Fox announced that it had acquired the U.S. television rights to Miss USA and Miss Universe, beginning with Miss Universe 2015 and Miss USA 2016.

Starting with the 2023 edition of the pageant, the Miss Universe Organization announced in August 2022 that it would accept divorced, maritally annulled, married, or widowed women and mothers to compete in the pageant, and the next year adult women of any age could compete. In October, JKN Global Group through JKN Metaverse Inc. acquired the Miss Universe Organization for US$14 million.

Later in September 2023, 2022 winner R&#x27;Bonney Gabriel announced that the organization would be forgoing the age limit, even for all its related pageants, not just Miss USA. Accordingly, beginning with Miss USA 2024, adult women 29 years old and above will also be eligible to participate. Also that same month, the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants would move The CW, with Miss USA 2023 airing on the network and Miss Teen USA 2023 streaming on its app. On April 25, 2024, The CW extended its broadcast rights to the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants in a three-year deal; as part of the deal, the Miss Teen USA pageant will air on broadcast television for the first time since 2007.

===Miss USA 2015 controversy===

In late-June 2015, both NBC and Spanish-language network Univision (which was to begin a new five-year contract for Spanish rights replacing Telemundo) announced that they would cut their ties with Donald Trump and the Miss Universe Organization in response to remarks Trump made relating to undocumented immigrants during the launch of his 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Trump threatened to sue both companies over the decision; on June 30, 2015, Trump sued Univision for defamation and breach of contract. In February 2016, Donald Trump and Univision reached a settlement ending the litigation. The terms of the settlement remain confidential but included an agreement for Trump to buy back NBCUniversal&#x27;s stake in the MUO.

===Response to COVID-19 pandemic===
The Miss USA 2020 was impacted by scheduling delays, difficulty finding a location, and broadcasting issues amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. In August 2020 it was announced that it would be televised at FYI and would be held in November.

===2020–2022: Split from MUO===
In the summer of 2020, the Miss Universe organization finalized licensing of future annual operation of the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants to Crystle Stewart, who was Miss USA 2008, until her suspension in October 2022. The first pageant competitions under her directorship as Miss USA Organization were the 2021 productions.

===2022–2023: Miss USA 2022 controversy and MUO investigation===
Shortly after the Miss USA 2022 competition, the Miss Universe Organization suspended the organizers of the Miss USA pageant (headed by Crystle Stewart) after allegations of favoritism toward the eventual winner, R&#x27;Bonney Gabriel, while she was still Miss Texas USA.

In August 2023, it was announced that Stewart had stepped down as president of the Miss USA Organization. She was replaced by fashion designer Laylah Rose.

===2024–present: Resignation of both National Titleholders===
On May 6, 2024, the reigning Miss USA 2023, Noelia Voigt, resigned from the title citing a desire to prioritize her mental health. Two days later, the reigning Miss Teen USA 2023, UmaSofia Srivastava, also resigned from her title. Voigt&#x27;s resignation statement, which she posted to Instagram, seemingly spelled out (with the first letter of the beginning of each sentence): &quot;I Am Silenced&quot;; although, the last three sentences did not fit this message, spelling out &quot;HIP&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; later obtained Voigt&#x27;s internal resignation letter to the Miss USA organization where she cited &quot;a toxic work environment&quot;, &quot;bullying and harassment&quot;, and delayed delivery of her prize winnings as reasons for her resignation. Both Voigt and Srivastava hold contracts with the Miss USA organization which have confidentiality agreements.

Voigt&#x27;s first runner-up, Savannah Gankiewicz of Hawaii, assumed the title of Miss USA 2023 on May 9, 2024. Srivastava&#x27;s first runner-up, Stephanie Skinner of New York, declined to assume the title of Miss Teen USA 2023, and as of May 14, 2024, the Miss Teen USA 2023 title is vacant.

On May 15, 2024, the mothers of former Miss USA, Noelia Voigt, and Miss Teen USA, UmaSofia Srivastava, came forward to discuss the circumstances surrounding their daughters&#x27; unexpected resignations from their titles. Bound by non-disclosure agreements with the Miss USA organization, the young women could not personally address the situation. Their mothers, however, stated in an interview on Good Morning America: &quot;The job of their dreams turned out to be a nightmare&quot;. They claimed that their daughters were exposed to ill-treatment, abuse, bullying, and felt cornered within the organization. UmaSofia Srivastava announced her resignation on Instagram, stating her values “no longer aligned” with those of the organization. Similarly, Noelia Voigt referenced her mental health in her resignation statement. The nature of her cryptic statement hinted at the idea of being silenced, spelled out in the first 11 sentences of her post. Her mother, Jackeline Voigt, responding to queries about the implied message, avoided confirming its deliberate intent but underscored that her daughter felt silenced due to the ongoing provisions of the non-disclosure agreement.

==Competition==
The modern pageant consists of a preliminary competition held a week before the pageant when all contestants are judged in swimsuit, evening gown, and interview competitions.

==State competitions==
Every year, applicants must have to choose their delegate for the Miss USA pageant who is at the age of 18 or above on the annual state pageant season. Each state holds a preliminary competition. In some states, local pageants are also held to determine delegates for the state competition. The state winners hold the title &quot;Miss (State) USA&quot; for the year of their reign.

The most successful state is Texas; ten Texas representatives have gone on to win the Miss USA title, more than any other state, including five consecutive winners from 1985 until 1989. California has the second most wins at six, while the District of Columbia, New York, Hawaii, and Illinois each have four.

==Miss USA titleholders==

==Awards==
The awards most frequently presented at Miss USA are Miss Amity (also known as Miss Congeniality) and Miss Photogenic.

The Miss Amity Award is chosen by the delegates, and recognizes those who are the friendliest and make the pageant experience the most enjoyable. From 1952 to 1964, when the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants were concurrent events, the award could be won by a contestant competing either for Miss USA or Miss Universe. In fact, in 1960, there was a tie, with the award going to Miss Universe Burma, Myint Myint May, and Miss Louisiana USA, Rebecca Fletcher. In 2015, Alaska and Delaware tied for the Miss Congeniality award. Vermont and Wyoming have won five Miss Amity/Congeniality awards, two more than any other state.

The Miss Photogenic prize was first awarded in 1965 and was chosen by journalists until 1996 when it was chosen by an internet vote for the first time. There has been only one tie in this award&#x27;s history: in 1980, when it was shared between Jineane Ford of Arizona and Elizabeth Kim Thomas of Ohio. The state that has won the most Photogenic awards is Virginia.

Louisiana won both the first Miss Amity and Photogenic awards given to a Miss USA contestant.

Other awards that have been presented include Best State Costume (1962–1993, 2021–present), Style (1995–2001) and Most Beautiful Eyes (1993). In 1998, a special Distinguished Achievement award was given to Halle Berry. Berry was Miss Ohio USA 1986 and placed 1st runner-up to Christy Fichtner of Texas. She later went on to become an acclaimed actress and Oscar winner.

<text>Tod Hiro Mikuriya (20 September 193320 May 2007) was an American physician and psychiatrist. Known as an outspoken advocate for the use of cannabis for medical purposes and its legalization, he is often regarded as the grandfather of the medical cannabis movement in the United States.

==Life and education==
Mikuriya was born at his Aunt Mary Schwenk Wallace&#x27;s home in Brownsville, Pennsylvania, to German teacher Anna Schwenk and civil engineer Tadafumi Mikuriya, an Issei descendant of the Japanese samurai nobility. He had two sisters. His mother followed the Baháʼí Faith, and his father was a converted Christian. Mikuriya and his sisters grew up in the Quaker community of Fallsington, Pennsylvania and were raised as Quakers. He attended Quaker schools such as the George School.

Mikuriya claimed he first heard of cannabis in a children&#x27;s book in 1959 and is quoted to have drawn a connection between his family&#x27;s faith and his views on cannabis:
Mikuriya attended Haverford and Guilford College before enrolling at Reed College. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology in 1956 and conducted some graduate work at the University of Oregon School of Psychiatry. Shortly thereafter, he enlisted in the Army where he served as an attendant in the psychiatric ward of Brooke Army Hospital. He earned his medical degree from Temple University in 1962. Mikuriya completed an internship at Southern Pacific Hospital (San Francisco) and residencies in psychiatry at Oregon State Hospital and at Mendocino State Hospital.

Mikuriya died at his home in Berkeley, California on 20 May 2007 at age 73 after a battle with lung cancer. He was survived by his two sisters, son, and daughter.

==Professional career==
===Clinical practice===
Mikuriya directed the drug addiction center of the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric Institute in Princeton, New Jersey from 1966–1967 before becoming a consulting research psychiatrist in charge of non-classified marijuana research at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Center for Narcotics and Drug Abuse Studies in 1967.

After two months, Mikuriya left the NIMH due to its lack of funding and support for research into positive applications of marijuana. He moved to Berkeley, California where he opened a private psychiatric practice specializing in biofeedback therapy and substance abuse. Mikuriya also worked for the Alameda County Alcoholism Clinic and the state Department of Rehabilitation. During the 1970s, Mikuriya served as Chair of the Department of Psychiatry at Eden Medical Center. To facilitate his private practice Mikuriya founded the company Mikuriya Data Systems and worked out of an office at the Claremont Hotel until he was forced to leave over his support of Proposition 215. He continued to see patients at his home for clinical consultation on cannabis until his death. He approved marijuana for medical purposes for over nine thousand patients, not solely in terminal cases, but also alleviation of physical and emotional pain in non-terminal cases.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Mikuriya authored a number of academic publications which inspired renewed debate on the therapeutic use of cannabis within the medical community, including the proposal of cannabis as a substitution agent as well as on issues related to the legality of cannabis. His 1972 self-published book &quot;Marijuana: Medical Papers, 1839–1972&quot; became a landmark in the modern movement for the legalization of medical marijuana. Mikuriya continued to publish editorials throughout the 1970s and 1980s.
A collection of Mikuriya&#x27;s papers dated 1933–2015 is held by the National Library of Medicine. 

Mikuriya&#x27;s practices drew him into conflict with authorities. In 2000, the Medical Board of California (MBC) accused him of improper recommendation of cannabis without physical examinations. Law enforcement in only eleven rural northern California counties responded to solicitation by MBC investigators and officials in the California Attorney General&#x27;s office. There were no complaints from patients, families or community physicians. Following their investigation, the MBC placed him on a five-year probation in 2004.

=== Political activism ===
Mikuriya was involved early on in political and civil movements focused on changing cannabis laws. In 1971, Mikuriya joined the group Amorphia, &quot;a special interest group that was spearheading the California Marijuana Initiative.&quot; He took part in the redaction of the failed California Prop. 19 in 1972, and helped Dennis Peron organize San Francisco&#x27;s Proposition P which supported medical marijuana use and passed with 79% of the vote in 1991. He is well known for helping to author 1996 California Proposition 215. He declared: &quot;As one of the authors of the Prop 215, my claim to fame is getting the phrase ‘for any other condition that Cannabis is helpful’ included.&quot;

In 1980, he ran in the House of Representatives elections as a member of the Libertarian Party, against incumbent Ron Dellums, a Democrat, and Republican Charles V. Hughes for California&#x27;s 8th congressional district seat. He lost, with 10,465 votes to Dellums&#x27;s 108,380 and Hughes&#x27;s 76,580.

In 1999, Mikuriya founded the California Cannabis Research Medical Group (CCRMG) to help physicians share and exchange data about cannabis use by their patients. Its main project, the Society of Cannabis Clinicians (SCC), facilitated voluntary medical standards for physician-approved cannabis under California law (HSC §11362.5). The CCRMG was later renamed as the SCC in 2004.

<text>Tedy Lacap Bruschi (; born June 9, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons. He played college football for the Arizona Wildcats, where he earned two-time consensus All-American. He was selected by the New England Patriots in the third round of the 1996 NFL draft, and played his entire professional career with them. Bruschi won three Super Bowls and was a two-time second-team All-Pro selection.

He served as the senior advisor to the head coach at the University of Arizona from 2021 to 2023.

==Early life==
Bruschi was born in San Francisco, California. His paternal grandparents were from Bedonia in Italy (specifically, the frazione of Bruschi di Sopra), while his mother is of Filipino ancestry. He attended Roseville High School in Roseville, California, where he lettered in football, wrestling and track and field (shot put). He was an all-conference selection as a defensive tackle for the Roseville Tigers.

==College career==
Bruschi attended the University of Arizona, where he played for the Arizona Wildcats football team from 1991 to 1995. In his four-year college career, he compiled 185 total tackles (137 solos), with 74 tackles for losses, six fumbles and recovered five others and tied the NCAA Division I-A sack record with 52 sacks. He was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American in 1994 and 1995, and won the 199 Morris Trophy as the Pacific-10 Conference&#x27;s best defensive lineman.

In 1991, he missed the first three games of the season due to a pinched nerve in his neck. He returned and started two games as a true freshman, but suffered a broken left thumb and was redshirted. In 1992, he played strongside outside linebacker prior to his transition to the defensive line in 1993 and started just one of 12 games and still managed to post 4.5 sacks for the season. In 1993, he earned second-team All-America honors after setting a school record with 19 sacks as a sophomore, received first-team All-Pac-10 honors, and was named the Wildcats&#x27; most valuable player. His 27.5 tackles for losses and 19 sacks in 1993 were each career highs. In 1994, he was one of four finalists for the Lombardi Award and again was a first-team All-Pac-10 selection. He totaled 39 tackles, including 10 sacks and 15 tackles for losses. In 1995, he totaled 60 tackles (48 solos), including 18.5 sacks and 22.5 tackles for losses. Bruschi was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2013.

==Professional career==

===1996–2001===
Prior to the NFL Draft, Bruschi was invited to play in the East West Shrine Bowl Game.

The New England Patriots selected Bruschi in the third round (86th overall) of the 1996 NFL draft. Coming into the draft he was listed at 6&#x27;0 250 pounds and was considered too small to be a defensive end but was a good size to be a linebacker, which is the position that the New England coaches moved him to.

He played for the Patriots from to . Bruschi never used an agent during his time with the New England Patriots.

In 1996, he played in every game as a rookie, a pass rush specialist who played on many special teams units and finished the season with 11 tackles, including four sacks. He ranked third on the team with 17 special teams tackles, and ran a blocked punt back for a TD in October. Bruschi recorded two sacks in Super Bowl XXXI against the Green Bay Packers, just one shy of the Super Bowl record (Reggie White, 3.0). In 1997, he saw action in every game for the second consecutive season and posted 30 defensive tackles, including four sacks, and added 13 special teams stops. His four sacks and 13 special teams tackles each ranked third on the team, and he also forced two fumbles, and recovered one. In 1998, Bruschi played in every game for the third consecutive year and started the last eight games of the season, including the Patriots wild-card playoff game in Jacksonville (January 3, 1999). He finished fourth on the team with a career-high 81 tackles, including a pair of sacks.

In 1999, he started 14 games at outside linebacker and recorded a career-high 138 total tackles, including two sacks. Bruschi finished second on the team in tackles, despite missing two games due to a right knee sprain. He made his first career interception, one of six passes defensed on the year. 2000 saw Bruschi start all 16 games at weakside linebacker and finished with 105 tackles (68 solos). It was his second consecutive season with over 100 tackles. In 2001, he started nine of 15 regular season games at linebacker and finished third on the team with 73 tackles. He was credited with two sacks, forced three fumbles, recovering one, and two interceptions.

===2002–2004===
In 2002, Bruschi was voted a defensive captain for the season by his teammates. He ranked seventh on the team with 65 tackles (45 solos) despite missing five games due to injury. He returned two interceptions for touchdowns (at Oakland, November 17, and at Detroit, November 28), the seventh time a Patriot interceptor has reached the end zone twice in a single season and the first time a linebacker has accomplished the feat. In 2003 he started all 16 games at inside linebacker as one of four defensive players to start all 16 games and he was voted a defensive captain for the season by his teammates. He ranked second on the team with 137 tackles (87 solo) and finished third on the team with 16 pass defenses. He was named AFC Defensive Player of the Week in Weeks Two and 14. In the 2004 regular season, Bruschi finished second on the team with 122 tackles (84 solo) and tied for second on the team with three interceptions. His solid play continued in the playoffs, where he finished second on the squad with 23 tackles (18 solo) and added a sack, an interception, a forced fumble and two fumble recoveries. Bruschi was named the AFC Defensive Player of the Week three times in 2004: Weeks 4 and 17 and in the Divisional Playoffs, when he forced a fumble and recovered two fumbles as the Patriots defense held the highly regarded Colts offense to just three points.

===2005 stroke===
On February 15, 2005, at age 31 and just two days after playing in the 2005 Pro Bowl, Bruschi woke up with symptoms including left sided numbness, weakness, and vision problems. He was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital, where he diagnosed with an ischemic stroke, caused by a blocked artery in the brain. He was found to have a patent foramen ovale, a congenital heart defect that leaves a small hole in the wall separating the left and right atria of the heart. After several months of rehabilitation working with Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston, Bruschi announced he would sit out the 2005 NFL season.

On October 16, 2005, the Patriots announced that Bruschi had been medically cleared to resume playing football; he rejoined the team on the practice field three days later. The Patriots officially activated him on October 29, and he played the following night against the Buffalo Bills; ESPN&#x27;s broadcast of the game had several features and interviews on Bruschi&#x27;s return. Following the game, Bruschi was named AFC Defensive Player of the Week. Bruschi played most of the remaining games that season, except for the final regular season game against Miami and the first playoff game against Jacksonville. Bruschi was named the 2005 NFL Comeback Player of the Year, an honor he shared with Carolina Panthers wide receiver Steve Smith.

===2006–2008===

At the start of training camp, Bruschi broke his right scaphoid bone which he had surgery on August 8. He was listed as questionable, and didn&#x27;t play in the first game of the 2006 season against the Buffalo Bills. Bruschi was voted a defensive captain by his teammates and started the final 14 games at linebacker. He finished first on the team with 124 tackles. In the 2006 playoffs, Bruschi led the Patriots with 24 tackles (16 solo), marking the highest playoff tackle total of his career. He also led the team with 23 tackles (15 solo) in the 2007 playoffs. In 2007, he played in and started all 16 regular-season games for the fourth time in his career and was voted a defensive captain for the 2007 season. He tied a single-game career high with a two-sack performance against the Cleveland Browns on October 7, 2007, and ran his career total to 30.5 sacks, becoming the 13th player in Patriots&#x27; history to reach that milestone. Also he led the team in tackles (99) and solo tackles (69) in 2007. In 2008, he played in 13 games, starting 12, and was named a defensive captain by his teammates for the seventh season.

===Touchdowns===
Bruschi was the first player in NFL history to return four consecutive interceptions for touchdowns and his career total of four interceptions returned for touchdowns ranks second in Patriots history. He is tied for fourth in NFL history among linebackers, and Bruschi is the only Patriots linebacker to return multiple interceptions for touchdowns in a single season (2002 and 2003). Additionally, since 2002 Bruschi&#x27;s defensive play has created seven defensive touchdowns. He scored four of those touchdowns on interception returns (two in both 2002 and 2003), forced two fumbles that were picked up and returned for touchdowns (October 3 and November 28, 2004), and tipped a pass that was intercepted by James Sanders and returned for a touchdown (December 11, 2005). This is in addition to his first career touchdown at Baltimore (October 6, 1996) when Bruschi recovered a blocked punt by Larry Whigham and returned it four yards for a touchdown, making 8 total touchdowns to which Bruschi contributed.

===Retirement===
On the August 30, 2009 broadcast of &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;, Al Michaels reported that Bruschi would announce his retirement after 13 seasons in the NFL. Bruschi confirmed his retirement on August 31, 2009, at a press conference alongside New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick and owner Robert Kraft. During this broadcast, Bruschi described how fulfilled he felt in completing his 13 years of playing football. He described how it felt to know that he had reached all of the goals he wanted to reach.

Bruschi joined ESPN as an analyst following his retirement.

Bruschi has indicated that he would prefer that his number, 54, not be retired. It was worn by six-time Pro Bowl guard Brian Waters in 2011 and by Dont&#x27;a Hightower the following season. The New England Patriots held a special ceremony in Bruschi&#x27;s honor during halftime on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; on December 6, 2010.

On May 21, 2013, Bruschi was voted by fans as the 19th player to enter the New England Patriots Hall of Fame. Bruschi&#x27;s Patriots Hall of Fame induction ceremony occurred on July 29, 2013.

On February 1, 2015, Bruschi was an honorary captain at Super Bowl XLIX.

<text>Mohamed Khelifati (; born 11 July 1966), better known by his stage name Cheb Mami (), is an Algerian musician and singer-songwriter. He sings and speaks in Algerian Arabic and sometimes in Eastern Arabic dialects or in French. Internationally, he is known for contributing vocals to the 1999 Sting single &quot;Desert Rose&quot;.

==Early life==
Cheb Mami was born in Graba-el-Wed, a populous quarter of Saïda, a city located 170 km south of Oran, on the high mesas of northwestern Algeria.

==Career==

===Early years and music styles adopted===
Cheb Mami came to prominence in 1982, when, aged 16, he finished as runner-up in the televised Algerian talent show &quot;Alhane wa chabab&quot; (melodies and youth). He followed this by launching a career as a raï singer, performing at weddings and releasing cassettes after he drew the attention of music producers. In 1985, he moved to Paris, France. He later performed military service for two years in Algeria while working as an entertainer on army bases. In May 1989, he returned to Paris and subsequently toured the United States, Germany, England, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Spain.

Cheb Mami&#x27;s music is a blend of Mediterranean and Western influences, including Flamenco, Greek and Turkish music, as well as Latin music, and his voice is tinged with Andalusian accents.

===International recognition===
When Sting&#x27;s album &quot;Brand New Day&quot; was released in 1999, the pair&#x27;s duet, &quot;Desert Rose&quot;, appeared on singles charts around the world and led to television appearances on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, the &quot;Today Show&quot;, &quot;Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;David Letterman&quot;, the Grammy Awards telecast, and even a live performance at the Super Bowl.

==Arrest, imprisonment, and release==
Cheb Mami was under an international arrest warrant after being indicted in October 2006 for &quot;voluntary violence, sequestration, and threats&quot; against an ex-wife, and failing to answer a court summons on 14 May 2007. He was accused of attempting to force an abortion on his then-girlfriend, magazine photographer Isabelle Simon. During a trip to Algeria in the summer of 2005, Simon was locked in a house belonging to one of Cheb Mami&#x27;s friends, where an abortive procedure was attempted on her. Afterwards in France, she realized the fetus was still alive, and she later gave birth to a daughter. Cheb Mami had accused his manager Michel Lecorre (a.k.a. Michel Levy) of organizing the abortion plan; Levy was later sentenced to four years for plotting and organizing the assault. Cheb Mami was arrested in France several days before his trial and taken into custody by officials at a Paris airport as he arrived in the country from Algeria on 22 June 2009.

In July 2009, a Paris court found him guilty of drugging and attempted forcible abortion, and sentenced him to five years in prison.

On 21 September 2010, his lawyers applied for conditional release, a request that was turned down on 12 October 2010. Upon a second appeal however, the French court agreed for his conditional release on 23 March 2011.

==Plagiarism==
In July 2015, Cheb Mami had to pay 200,000 euros to Cheb Rabah (born Rabah Zerradine) for plagiarizing his texts. The songs in question are &quot;Le raï c&#x27;est chic&quot;, &quot;Madanite&quot;, &quot;Ma vie deux fois&quot;, and &quot;Gualbi Gualbi&quot;.

<doc id="884945" wikidata="Q706878" url="?curid=884945" title="Marek Židlický">
<text>Marek Židlický (; born ) is a Czech former professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected in the sixth round, 176th overall, by the New York Rangers in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft.

==Playing career==
Marek Židlický was selected 176th overall, in the sixth round of the 2001 NHL Entry Draft on June 24, 2001. He was selected as the sixth choice of the New York Rangers. Židlický had a very strong 2000–01 season with HIFK of the Finnish SM-liiga, ranking third on his team in assists (25) and tied for second on his team in points (37). He also led the league in points by a defenceman. This was enough for the Rangers to draft him in the NHL entry draft that next summer.

Židlický and the Rangers, however, could never agree to contract terms. The major sticking point was that Židlický wanted a one-way contract which would pay him the same amount of money regardless of whether he was playing in the NHL or the American Hockey League (AHL). He wanted this contract because he was worried about the depth of the Rangers and did not want to spend too much time in the minor leagues. The Rangers, however, would not agree to such a deal and only offered a two-way contract, one that would pay him at a lower rate if he played in the AHL. Because of these contract differences, Židlický opted to stay in Finland and continue playing for HIFK.

Židlický had two more very strong years for HIFK leading the team in points in 2001–02 with 40 points. The next season, he tied for the team lead in points with 47. Realizing that Židlický would not come to North America to play without a one-way contract and unwilling to give him one, the Rangers traded him, along with Rem Murray and Tomáš Klouček, for goaltender Mike Dunham on December 12, 2002, to the Nashville Predators.
Židlický joined the Predators in Nashville for the 2003–04 season, which proved to be a very successful season for Židlický. He recorded his first NHL point in his NHL debut on October 10, 2003, in a 3–1 win over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He scored his first NHL goal the next day in the second period of a 3–1 loss to the Dallas Stars. He became the first Predator to play all 82 games in his first season in the league (he was not considered a rookie because of his age).

Židlický was injured when he was checked in the opening minutes of the first ever Predators playoff game against the Detroit Red Wings. He suffered a concussion and was unable to return for any more games in the playoff series. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Židlický returned to play for HIFK in Helsinki. On May 8, 2006, it was announced that the Predators and Židlický had agreed on terms for a new four-year contract worth $13.5 million.

On July 1, 2008, Židlický was traded to the Minnesota Wild for Ryan Jones and a second round draft pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. During his second season with the Wild, Židlický was re-signed to a three-year contract extension on March 2, 2010.

On February 24, 2012, Židlický was traded to the New Jersey Devils from the Minnesota Wild in exchange for Kurtis Foster, Nick Palmieri, Stephane Veilleux, a Washington Capitals&#x27; second round draft pick in 2012 and a conditional pick in 2013. In July 2013, he was re-signed by the Devils. On June 3, 2014, Zidlicky was re-signed by the Devils to a one-year contract worth $3 million, plus $1 million with incentives.

On March 2, 2015, the Devils traded Židlický to the Detroit Red Wings for a conditional third-round pick in the 2016 NHL Draft. Initially, the Red Wings were nearing a trade with the Toronto Maple Leafs for captain Dion Phaneuf, however, the deal fell through at the last minute, forcing the Red Wings to look elsewhere for a defenceman. The Red Wings were in need of a veteran right-handed shot to fit in on their powerplay, and Židlický filled this quota almost immediately after arriving in Detroit. During his first game with the Red Wings on March 4, Židlický scored the game-winning overtime goal, in a 2–1 win over the New York Rangers.

On September 18, 2015, Židlický signed as a free agent to a one-year contract with the New York Islanders.

<doc id="884948" wikidata="Q4589419" url="?curid=884948" title="Rover V8 engine">
<text>The Rover V8 engine is a compact OHV V8 internal combustion engine with aluminium cylinder block and cylinder heads, designed and produced by Rover in the United Kingdom, based on a General Motors engine. It has been used in a wide range of vehicles from Rover and other manufacturers since its British debut in 1967.

==History==
The Rover V8 began life as the Buick 215, an all-aluminium OHV pushrod engine introduced in 1960 for the 1961 US model year (it was on their drawing boards in the late 1950s). The compact alloy engine was light, at just , and capable of high power outputs: the most powerful Buick version of this engine rated , and the very similar Oldsmobile &quot;Jetfire&quot; turbocharged version made , both numbers SAE gross. Based on sales volume and press reports, the engine was a success. Buick produced 376,799 cars with this engine in just three years. A comparable number of Oldsmobile 215 engines were produced. In addition, some Pontiac models were fitted with the Buick 215, leading to the nickname &quot;BOP 215&quot; for the engine (BOP standing for Buick/Oldsmobile/Pontiac). The aluminium engine was relatively expensive to produce, however, and it suffered problems with oil and coolant sealing, as well as with radiator clogging from use of antifreeze incompatible with aluminium. As a result, GM ceased production of the all-aluminium engine after 1963, although Buick retained a similar 300/340/350 cid engine (iron block and alloy heads, later all-iron) (1964–1980), as well as a V6 derivative (1962–2008) which proved to have a very long and successful life.

In January 1964 Rover gave American operations head J. Bruce McWilliams permission to investigate the possible purchase of an American V8 engine for Rover cars. History relates that McWilliams first saw the Buick V8 at the works of Mercury Marine, where he was discussing the sale of Rover gas turbines and diesel engines to the company (Mercury Marine did indeed use the Land Rover diesel engine in marinised form). However, it is likely that McWilliams was aware of the Buick engine before this. In any case, McWilliams realised that the lightweight Buick V8 would be ideal for smaller British cars (indeed, it weighed less than many straight-4 engines it would replace). McWilliams and William Martin-Hurst began an aggressive campaign to convince GM to sell the tooling, which they finally agreed to do in January 1965. Retiring Buick engineer Joe Turlay moved to the UK to act as a consultant.

The Rover V8 has long been a relatively common engine for kit car use in Britain, much as the Chevrolet small-block V8 is for American hot rod builders (though many British hot rods have traditionally used four cylinder engines, like the Ford Pinto and Crossflow units). Even in the US there is a strong contingent of builders who select the Buick or Rover aluminium V8 engine for use in small sporty cars like the MGB . The 1964 Buick iron-block engine had aluminium cylinder heads, 3.75 bore and a longer 3.4&quot; stroke crankshaft, which with modification can be used with the Buick 215 or Rover engine blocks to produce a high-output, very light weight V8 with displacement of up to about . The 300 crank, after machining the mains to the 215 size in the 215 block yields . Traco in the USA were prominent builders of such engines.

The British made engines were run on two SU carburettors, initially HS6 then HIF6 and HIF44 variants (14 years), then two CD175 Stromberg carburettors (2–3 years), Bosch L-Jetronic (7–8 years, aka Lucas 4CU Flapper), then Hitachi Hotwire (5 years, aka Lucas 14CUX), then the GEMS system (many years) and finally Bosch Motronics for 2 years. The engine is still cast now (2011), in an improved version, by Coscast in Birmingham, UK.

As well as appearing in Rover cars, the engine was sold by Rover to small car builders, and has appeared in a wide variety of vehicles. Rover V8s feature in some models from Morgan +8, TVR, Triumph TR8, Land Rover and MGB V8, among many others.

By the late 1990s, the Rover V8 had become uncompetitive with other V8 engines in its class. Compared to modern V8 engines, It produced less horsepower, it used much more fuel, and used an aged pushrod architecture, whereas V8 engines made by other automakers often used overhead-cam designs. After Land Rover switched to the BMW M62 V8 in the 2003 Range Rover, and the petrol-powered Land Rover Discovery 3 switched to the Jaguar AJ-V8 engine, the last mass-produced Rover V8 was made in May 2004, after 37 years of production, and just under 1 million engines produced. The 2004 Land Rover Discovery II was the last mass-produced vehicle to use it.

The last Rover-badged vehicle that used the Rover V8 was the Rover SD1, which was discontinued in 1986 and replaced by the Rover 800, which used a 2.7 litre variant of the Honda C engine as its top engine choice. MG Rover Group used the 4.6 L SOHC 2-valve Ford Modular V8 engine in the Rover 75 and MG ZT 260 from 2003-2005. 

The Rover V8 remained with Land Rover when it was sold to Ford by BMW. Although Land Rover has switched to the Jaguar AJ-V8 engine for new applications, they wanted production of the engine to continue, and they arranged for production to restart in Weston-super-Mare under MCT, an engineering and manufacturing company. MCT will continue limited production of the engine for the foreseeable future, supplying engines for aftermarket and replacement use.

The Rover V8 based on the Buick design was not the first V8 engine produced by Rover. When the Rover Company was having engineering differences of opinion regarding the development of the Whittle turbine engine, the Wilks brothers did a deal with Rolls-Royce to swap technologies. The turbine engine project at Barnoldswick went to Rolls-Royce and Rover Co took over the V12 Meteor engine production used in a range of world war two tanks and the post war Centurion Tank - (the Meteor V12 was a &#x27;detuned&#x27; version of the Merlin aero engine). From this a V8 variant was developed.

The Rover Meteorite, also known as Rolls-Royce Meteorite, was a V8 petrol engine of capacity. In essence it was two-thirds of a V12 Meteor, and it shared the Meteor&#x27;s 60° bank angle. Meteorites were built for heavy duty vehicles, for marine use and as stationary power units: it powered the Thornycroft Antar or Mighty Antar Tank Transporter – and as such was used to transport Meteor-engined tanks – and also heavy transport on the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme in Australia.

==Racing==
As the aluminium block made this engine one of the lightest stock V8s built, it was an obvious choice for use in racing. Mickey Thompson entered a car powered by this engine in the 1962 Indianapolis 500. From 1946 to 1962 there had not been a single stock-block car entered in this famous race. In 1962 the Buick 215 was the only non-Offenhauser powered entry in the field of 33 cars. Rookie driver Dan Gurney qualified eighth and raced well for 92 laps before retiring with transmission problems.

The Rover version of this engine was extensively developed and used for rallying, especially in Triumph TR8 sports cars.

The Australian Repco V8 F1 engine being based on Buick 215 block is technically a common misconception, as the Rover/Buick V8 had only 5 cylinder head studs around each cylinder unit and that cannot accommodate the 6 stud Repco RB620 heads. The Repco V8 was based on the Oldsmobile 215 block of the same era, which was very similar in appearance, size and material, but used 6 cylinderhead studs per cylinder. The subtle difference in block design/head clamping originated in Oldsmobile&#x27;s intention to produce the higher power, turbo-charged Jetfire version of the small/light V8, however, the public/press tended not to be aware of the internal difference.

Hotstox use Rover V8 in their stock cars.

==3.5 L==

The initial Rover version of the engine had a displacement of . The bore and the stroke was . All Rover V8s were OHV pushrod engines with two valves per cylinder. It used a sand-cast block with pressed-in iron cylinder liners, and a new intake manifold with two HS6 type SU Carburettors. The Rover engine was heavier but stronger than the Buick engine, with a dry weight of about . It was first offered in the 1967 Rover P5B saloon, initially making (gross) / (net) at 5,200 rpm and (gross) / (net) of torque at 2,600 rpm on 10.5:1 compression (5-star petrol was then still available in the UK). With the introduction of the Rover SD1 in 1976, the engine was improved with the &#x27;rope&#x27; oil seals for the crankshaft ends replaced with lip seals, spark plug dimensions changed and the compression ratio lowered to 9.35:1.

===Project Iceberg===

In the late 1970s, British Leyland became aware of the increasing importance of diesel engined cars to the British, European and (especially) North American markets in the wake of the 1979 energy crisis. It was decided that a new series of diesel engines powerful, refined and economical enough for use in BL cars was needed. However, with development funding tight, it was necessary to use existing BL petrol engines as a base. This included a diesel version of the V8, the development project for which was code-named &#x27;Iceberg&#x27;.

BL collaborated with Perkins Engines of Peterborough to develop the engine. Both naturally aspirated and turbocharged versions were produced, both using a Stanadyne rotary mechanical fuel injection system. Power outputs of around 100 (naturally aspirated) and 150 (turbocharged) horsepower were achieved.

The Iceberg engine was slated for fitment in the Range Rover, Rover SD1 and the Jaguar XJ but the project encountered problems with failure of the alloy cylinder heads and internal cooling. They were limited by the need to use the same basic block casting as the petrol engine to allow the Iceberg engine to be produced on the same production line to reduce costs. Whilst these problems could have been overcome, the project ran into financial and logistical problems caused by the reorganisation of BL and specifically the splitting of Land Rover and Rover into separate divisions.

Land Rover took over production of the V8 engine in 1982, moving it from the main BL engine plant at Acock&#x27;s Green into a new, much lower-capacity production line in the Solihull works, where it was built alongside the other Land Rover engines. This meant that there was no spare capacity to build diesel versions of the engine. Coupled to this, it was clear that the market for large diesel engined cars in North America had not developed as expected.

BL finally pulled out of the project in 1983. Perkins initially decided to pursue the project alone, and even produced advertising brochures for the engine as an industrial power unit, but BL withdrew all technical support and Project Iceberg was wrapped up in late 1983. BL&#x27;s other collaboration with Perkins (producing a diesel version of the O-Series engine) produced the highly successful &#x27;Prima&#x27; unit. BL (and its Rover Group successor) bought in 2.5-litre 4-cylinder turbodiesel units from VM Motori to use in the SD1 and Range Rover.

==3.9/4.0==

Land Rover used a version of the Rover V8 throughout the 1990s. Bore was increased to and stroke remained the same at . The engine was revised in 1995 and thereafter referred to as a 4.0 to differentiate it from the earlier version, although displacement was unchanged. The revisions consisted of a new intake and exhaust system, extra block ribbing, revised pistons, and larger cross-bolted main bearings. The 1995 4.0 produced and .

Production of the 4.0 ended in 2003. The final version of the engine, used until 2004 in the Land Rover Discovery, produced at 4,750 rpm and at 2,600 rpm.

Applications:
* 1990–2004 Morgan Plus 8
* 1991–1995 Ginetta G33
* 1992–1996 MG RV8
* 1986–1993 TVR V8S
* 1989–1995 Land Rover Range Rover (known as a 3.9 in this application)
* 1991–2000 TVR Griffith
* 1992–2001 TVR Chimaera
* 1983–1993 Marcos Mantula
* 1992–1999 Marcos Mantara
* 1994–1998 Marcos LM400
* 1997 Marcos Mantaray
* 1995–1999 Land Rover Range Rover (P38A) in SE trim
* 1996-2004 Land Rover Discovery
* 1994–1998 Land Rover Defender (only used as standard on USA-spec vehicles- available only to special order in other markets.)
* 1998 Land Rover Defender 50th Anniversary Limited Edition

In the early 1980s TVR approached Andy Rouse with a view to using his race-developed variant of the V8 in their Rover-powered TVR 350i &#x27;wedge&#x27;; Rouse had successfully campaigned a Rover SD1 with a modified V8 on the track. For a number of reasons (primarily cost) Rouse&#x27;s version was not used, but the concept was passed to alternative engineering firms which resulted in a rare variant of the 3.9. This unit has cylinder bores (instead of Rover&#x27;s own that was introduced some years later) and thus has a capacity of . Flat-topped pistons and high-lift camshaft gave a compression ratio of 10.5:1. TVR claimed 275 bhp as the output and whilst this is generally disregarded by aficionados, a healthy engine will produce in excess of 240 bhp. Once a reproducible specification had been determined, the bulk of engine production was undertaken by North Coventry Kawasaki (NCK), which company was subsequently purchased by TVR to become their in-house engine division known as TVR Power.
About 100 cars (TVR 390SE) were built with the engine; TVR&#x27;s later &#x27;400&#x27; offering being based on the then-current Range Rover 4L of .

Applications:
* 1986–1989 TVR 390SE

==4.2==
Land Rover extended the engine for the top LSE specification of the Classic Range Rover. The &quot;4.2&quot;-litre engine had an actual displacement of , and used the crankshaft castings from the failed &quot;Iceberg&quot; diesel engine project. Bore remained the same at , while stroke increased to .

Applications:
* 1992–1995 Land Rover Range Rover

==4.3==

For the Griffith and Chimaera, TVR Power, a Coventry-based subsidiary of sportscar maker TVR, built a Rover V8-version with a displacement using the stroke crankshaft and bore size. The bore and stroke were identical to Rover&#x27;s 4.2 engine but Rover rounded down to 4.2 L while TVR rounded up to 4.3 L.

The main difference between the Land Rover and TVR versions lies in the usage of Land Rover 3.9 pistons (usually of the 9.35:1 compression version, some report of low compression (8.13:1) pistons being used in a small number of engines) of which the tops were machined down to match the deck height, thus increasing static compression ratio. Head gaskets were originally copper and slightly thicker than the composite gaskets of later engines. TVR 4.3 engines tended to have elaborately ported cylinder heads with minimized valve guide protrusion into the ports, and Duplex timing chain with timing adjustment by vernier gear were specified although in practice, not all engines received it. Camshafts were usually Kent Cams 214 spec, although &#x27;big valve&#x27; versions could have a 224 or even a 234 (race) cam installed.

The so-called &#x27;pre-cat&#x27; versions of the Griffith predominantly used this engine, although a 4.0-litre version was also available. The Chimaera was introduced with choice of 4.0- and 4.3-litre engines. A small number of &#x27;Big Valve&#x27; versions, sporting modified cylinder heads with intake and exhaust valves and a more radical camshaft profile, found their way to early Griffiths and Chimaeras.

Applications:
* 1992–1993 TVR Griffith
* 1993–1994 TVR Chimaera

==4.4==
Leyland of Australia produced a version of the aluminium V8 for their Australia-only 1973 Leyland P76. The bore and the stroke was , making it a square engine. The block deck height was extended and longer conrods were fitted between centres. 
A Bendix Stromberg two-barrel carburettor was used in place of SU carburettors. This rare engine produced and and, although export (to the UK) versions were planned, the closure by British Leyland of their Australian operations in 1975 precluded the widespread application of this engine.
British Leyland did import one complete P76 engine for assessment but it was never fitted to a vehicle and was sold off on the demise of the company.

Applications:
* 1973–1975 Leyland P76
* 1976–1979 Leyland Terrier truck

==4.5==

Not to be confused with the later 4.6-litre engine which TVR badged as a &#x27;4.5&#x27; for the Chimaera, there also existed a version with an crank and bore giving capacity, which was used by TVR in the low-volume special 450 SEAC, the race version thereof and the subsequent Tuscan Challenge racers. A tiny number of Griffith and Chimaera road cars were built with a version of this engine, known as the &#x27;450 BV&#x27; (Big Valve).

==4.6==
In 1995, Land Rover enlarged the Rover V8 to . The bore remained the same size as the previous 4.0 at , but the engine was stroked by giving in total. Output was and .

Production of the 4.6 ended at Solihull, UK, in 2004. The final version, introduced in the Range Rover P38, produced at 4,750 rpm and at 2,600 rpm.

The last mass-produced application of the Rover V8 was in the Land Rover Discovery, up until the vehicle was redesigned in 2005. It is still used by some hand-built sports cars built by some independent manufacturers.

Applications:
* 1995–2002 Land Rover Range Rover in the HSE trim (Optional for SE trim)
* 2003–2004 Land Rover Discovery (North American market)
* 1992–1999 Marcos Mantara
* 1997 Marcos Mantaray
* 1996–2002 TVR Chimaera
* 1996 Morgan Plus 8

==5.0==
A variant of the Rover V8 was used in two models by British sportscar manufacturer TVR. The bore and the stroke was . These models, the Griffith and Chimaera used the unit in their top-end specifications. The factory quotes up to and of torque.

Applications:
* 1990-1995 Lichfield Land Rovers
* 1992–2001 TVR Chimaera
* 1992–2000 TVR Griffith
* 1994–2001 Marcos LM500
* 2003 Marcos TS500
* 2002–2006 Bowler Wildcat- this used a hybrid 5.0-litre V8 with Land Rover cylinder heads and a TVR block and piston assembly.

Moreover, in the mid-1980s, hot rodders discovered the 215 could be stretched to as much as , using the Buick 300 crankshaft, new cylinder sleeves, and an assortment of non-Buick parts. It could also be fitted with high-compression cylinder heads from the Morgan +8. Using the 5-litre Rover block and crankshaft, a displacement of is possible and used primarily in racing applications, stretching the design to its limits it is possible to achieve displacements of over and possibly even displacements near of , though the latter has not been tested in practice as of yet.

<text>John Douglas Reynolds (born January 19, 1942) is a former Canadian politician. He was the member of Parliament for the riding of West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country in the House of Commons of Canada from 1997 to 2006 and a former Federal Opposition Leader. He had also been an MP in the 1970s as well as a provincial politician in British Columbia in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Life and career==
He was first elected to Parliament as a candidate of the Progressive Conservatives in 1972 and was re-elected in 1974. He resigned in 1977 after a series of disagreements with Joe Clark.

Beginning in 1983, he was active in the Social Credit Party of British Columbia and served as speaker of the British Columbia Legislative Assembly and as a cabinet minister (Minister of Environment). In 1986, he was a candidate at the Social Credit leadership convention coming in fifth. He remained in provincial politics until 1991 when he was defeated in his bid for re-election.

Reynolds returned to parliament in 1997 as a Reform MP and served as Chief Opposition Whip. He remained in this role when the Reform Party was folded into the Canadian Alliance. When Stockwell Day faced a revolt in his caucus in 2001 and Chuck Strahl resigned as House leader, Reynolds was named in his place. When Day resigned as Alliance leader, Reynolds was chosen as interim party leader and leader of the opposition and served until Stephen Harper was elected the new party leader.

Reynolds resigned as House leader on January 24, 2005, but continued as MP for his riding until his retirement at the 2006 federal election. He was the coordinator of the Conservative campaign in British Columbia. On the day after the election, which resulted in a Conservative minority government, Harper asked Reynolds to approach Liberal minister David Emerson about crossing the floor and serving as a minister in Harper&#x27;s government. Emerson eventually accepted the offer, which triggered a firestorm of criticism. However, Reynolds, who had strongly criticized Belinda Stronach&#x27;s switch from the Conservatives to the Liberals, told a suburban Vancouver newspaper that he was &quot;very happy&quot; that Emerson was a Conservative and claimed that the people of Emerson&#x27;s left-leaning Vancouver riding got the better end of the bargain. &quot;Instead of having someone in opposition,&quot; he said, &quot;they have someone who is a cabinet minister of a new government.&quot;

Reynolds supports the death penalty.

After his political career, in 2006 he accepted the role as Senior Strategic Advisor at McMillan LLP.

<text>Larry Tee (born October 12, 1959) is a LA-based DJ, club promoter, and music producer who curated the electroclash scene in New York in the early 2000s, and helped launch the careers of such artists as RuPaul, Scissor Sisters, Fischerspooner, Peaches, W.I.T., and Avenue D. He has written songs for and collaborated with Afrojack, Shontelle, Princess Superstar, Santigold, RuPaul, Sean Garrett, Steve Aoki, and Amanda Lepore. 

In January 2014, he launched his clothing line TZUJI at London Fashion Week. TZUJI has since been worn by popular stars like Jimmy Fallon on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Rihanna, Missy Elliott, and Sean Kingston; and sold in top stores like the Dover Street Market in New York and VFILES as well as in Los Angeles, London, Berlin, and Melbourne.

&quot;New York Press&quot; credited Tee as &quot;a hipster before there were hipsters, a club kid before Michael Alig dismembered one, and a man who made Williamsburg cool again&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; cites Larry&#x27;s club in Williamsburg as one of the reasons Williamsburg &quot;got its groove back.&quot; &quot;New York&quot; magazine celebrated Tee&#x27;s role in making RuPaul a star in the 1990s.

==Career==
Tee was born to two Canadian-born citizens in Seattle, Washington. He grew up in Seattle and then Marietta, Georgia. In the early 1980s, he moved to Atlanta, where he became a part of the music scene and hung out with personalities such as RuPaul, Michael Stipe of R.E.M., Lady Bunny, and Lahoma Van Zandt at the Celebrity Club in Atlanta.

In 1986, Tee, along with RuPaul, Lady Bunny, and Lahoma Van Zandt, moved to New York City. Living with videographer Nelson Sullivan, Tee quickly became involved with the Club Kids scene with his epic party, Love Machine. He hosted nights at Michael Alig&#x27;s infamous DISCO 2000, which is featured in the movie &quot;Party Monster&quot; (2003). He also DJed at the ROXY on a weekly basis.

During the 1990s, he became a prominent DJ by playing at highly regarded venues such as Palladium, the ROXY, and Twilo. In 1992, Tee co-wrote RuPaul&#x27;s top 40-hit &quot;Supermodel (You Better Work)&quot;.

In the early 2000s, while spinning at the Berliniamsburg party at the club Luxx, Tee trademarked the term &quot;electroclash&quot;, which became so well known that it appeared in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary&quot;. He coordinated and managed the 2001 Electroclash Festival, which featured Scissor Sisters, Fischerspooner, and Peaches. He also created and managed the nouveau-music electro girl group W.I.T.

In 2007, he and Andy Bell released the single &quot;Matthew&quot;, an homage to Matthew Shepard, who in 1998 was killed for being gay.

In 2009, Tee released the iTunes top 20 dance album &quot;Club Badd&quot;, featuring songs by Perez Hilton, Princess Superstar (the &quot;Licky&quot; single was later re-written by Sean Garrett of Beyoncé/Usher fame and re-recorded by Shontelle), Jeffree Star, Roxy Cottontail, Herve, Bart B More, and Christopher Just. &quot;Licky&quot; also appeared on the Steve Aoki mix album with Santogold rapping on it, and in the Russell Brand movie, &quot;Get Him To the Greek&quot;. In 2010, Tee released the single &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Nasty&quot; featuring Roxy Cottontail; it was re-released in the UK in 2011. 

In 2010, Tee collaborated with celebrity blogger Perez Hilton and Amanda Lepore to produce Hilton&#x27;s first music track. Tee has remixed artists including Sia, Iggy Azalea, Steve Aoki, REM, Lady Gaga, Roisin Murphy, Kele of Bloc Party, and Cher.

In 2011, Tee moved to Shoreditch, London. He ran a weekly night in east London called Super Electric Party Machine at East Bloc every Friday Night, and XOYO, which has featured artists like Charli XCX, Brooke Candy, AME from Duke Dumonts #1 smash, Le1f, Ssion, and 2 Bears&#x27; Rolf.

In June 2015, Tee moved to Berlin to run TZUJI from Germany and run KRANK parties in Berlin. TZUJI has since been featured on shows such as &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, &quot;X Factor&quot;, and similar shows in several countries. The brand is associated with such entertainers as Rhianna, Missy Elliott, and Sean Kingston, and is sold in such shops as La Petite Mort and the Dover Street Market in New York, V Files, Asos Marketplace, Flasher (on Melrose, in Los Angeles), Borderline Apparel (in London), and Chaos-Labs (in Berlin).

In 2020, Tee launched the Fashertainment Inc website for forthcoming reality TV project of the same name.

In 2023, Tee moved to Los Angeles with his partner, drag queen Morgan Wood. In 2024 he produced music with Love Bailey, DJ&#x27;d at Just Like Heaven Festival and appeared in a documentary about the Butthole Surfers.

<text>Daniel Keyes (August 9, 1927 – June 15, 2014) was an American writer who wrote the novel &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;. Keyes was given the Author Emeritus honor by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America in 2000.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Keyes was born in New York City, New York. His family was Jewish. He attended New York University briefly before joining the United States Maritime Service at 17, working as a ship&#x27;s purser on oil tankers. Afterward he returned to New York and in 1950 received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology from Brooklyn College.

A month after graduation, Keyes joined publisher Martin Goodman&#x27;s magazine company, Magazine Management. He eventually became an editor of their pulp magazine &quot;Marvel Science Stories&quot; (cover-dated Nov. 1950 – May 1952) after editor Robert O. Erisman, and began writing for the company&#x27;s comic-book lines Atlas Comics, the 1950s precursors of Marvel Comics. After Goodman ceased publishing pulps in favor of paperback books and men&#x27;s adventure magazines, Keyes became an associate editor of Atlas under editor-in-chief and art director Stan Lee. Circa 1952, Keyes was one of several staff writers, officially titled editors, who wrote for such horror and science fiction comics as &quot;Journey into Unknown Worlds&quot;, for which Keyes wrote two stories with artist Basil Wolverton.

As Keyes recalled, Goodman offered him a job under Lee after &quot;Marvel Science Stories&quot; ceased publication:

One story idea Keyes wrote but did not submit to Lee was called &quot;Brainstorm&quot;, the paragraph-long synopsis that would evolve into &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;. It begins: &quot;The first guy in the test to raise the I.Q. from a low normal 90 to genius level ... He goes through the experience and then is thrown back to what was.&quot; Keyes recalled, &quot;something told me it should be more than a comic book script.&quot;

From 1955 to 1956, Keyes wrote for EC Comics, including its titles &quot;Shock Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Confessions Illustrated&quot;, under both his own name and the pseudonyms Kris Daniels and A.D. Locke.

===&quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;===

The short story and subsequent novel, &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;, is written as progress reports of a mentally disabled man, Charlie, who undergoes experimental surgery and briefly becomes a genius before the effects tragically wear off. The story was initially published in the April 1959 issue of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; and the expanded novel in 1966. The novel has been adapted several times for other media, most prominently as the 1968 film &quot;Charly&quot;, starring Cliff Robertson (who won an Academy Award for Best Actor) and Claire Bloom. Keyes also won the Hugo Award in 1959 and the Nebula Award in 1966 for the story.

The inspiration for &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; came from Keyes&#x27;s experiences as a teacher. When he was teaching at a high school, he taught both mentally gifted and challenged students. One particular experience with a boy in his mentally challenged class sparked the inspiration to begin writing Flowers for Algernon. He was wondering what would happen if it was possible for a person to gain intelligence.

===Later career===
Keyes taught creative writing at Wayne State University, and in 1966 he became an English and creative writing professor at Ohio University, in Athens, Ohio, where he was honored as a professor emeritus in 2000.

===Death===
Keyes died at his home in Boca Raton on June 15, 2014, due to complications from pneumonia. His wife Aurea Georgina Vazquez, whom he married in 1952, had died on May 14, 2013. They had two daughters.

<text>A jeepney (), or simply a jeep (), is a type of public utility vehicle (PUV) that serves as the most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines. Known for its crowded seating and kitsch decorations, it is a cultural icon of the Philippines and has its own art, &quot;Jeepney art&quot;. At the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, a Sarao jeepney was exhibited in the Philippine pavilion as a national symbol for Filipinos.

Jeepneys originate from the American colonial period–share taxis known as &quot;auto calesas&quot;, commonly shortened to &quot;AC&quot;. These evolved to modified imported cars with attached carriages in the 1930s which served as a cheap passenger utility vehicles in Manila. These vehicles were mostly destroyed in World War II. The need for replacement transport vehicles led to the use of U.S. military jeeps left over from the war, which became the template for the modern jeepney. A jeepney modernization program launched by the Department of Transportation in 2017 seeks to use more environmentally-friendly vehicles, but has raised concerns regarding the preservation of the jeepney&#x27;s iconic look as most modern jeepneys resemble regular minibuses.

As of 2022, there were an estimated 600,000 drivers nationwide dependent on driving jeepneys for their livelihood. In Metro Manila, an estimated 9 million commuters take the jeepney each day.


==Etymology==
The word &quot;jeepney&quot; is a portmanteau of post–World War II &quot;jeep&quot; and pre-war &quot;jitney&quot;, both words common slang in the popular vernacular of the era.

== History ==
From the American colonial period up to shortly after World War II, jeepneys were known as &quot;auto calesa&quot; (or &quot;AC&quot; for short), named after the horse-drawn calesas of Manila, or simply &quot;jitney&quot; or &quot;baby bus.&quot; The term &quot;auto calesa&quot; was first attested in 1910, and originally referred to relatively cheap imported cars that were used as share taxis by local drivers for an hour. The first automobile to be modified for seating more passengers was introduced in 1932 by a Filipino entrepreneur, using cheap imported German DKW vehicles with side-entry carriages attached. These were operated by the DKW-AC Company.

By the mid-1930s, Emil Bachrach, a Russian American Jewish entrepreneur in the Philippines (who also owned the Ford Motor Co. franchise in the Philippines, as well as Manila&#x27;s first bus company), started the Bachrach Motor Company (BMC). They began manufacturing similar vehicles known as the BMC-AC. Unlike the DKW-ACs, they had a back-entry carriage style (similar to the &quot;carretela&quot;-type &quot;calesa&quot;) that was joined seamlessly with the chassis. It seated two people on each side. The automobiles used were cheap imported British Austin 7s and later on, American Bantams, both of which are the direct precursors of the Jeep. They later expanded to seat eight to ten people but were still much shorter than modern jeepneys. Most of these vehicles were destroyed in World War II.

When American troops began to leave the Philippines at the end of World War II, hundreds of surplus Jeeps were sold or given to the Filipinos. An American soldier named Harry Stonehill was involved in the disposal of military surplus, and reportedly created a black market for the surplus including jeeps.

The Jeeps were stripped down and altered locally: metal roofs were added for shade, and the vehicles were decorated in vibrant colours with chrome-plated ornaments on the sides and hood. The back part was reconfigured with two long parallel benches with passengers facing each other to accommodate more passengers. The size, length, and passenger capacity have increased as it evolved through the years. In assembly-built jeepneys (notably, those built by Sarao Motors and Francisco Motors), the passenger capacity reached a maximum of fourteen to eighteen (including two up front). These high-capacity jeepneys were the first versions to be referred to as &quot;Public Utility Jeepneys&quot; (PUJ) or &quot;passenger-type&quot; jeeps. The non-extended, original-seat configuration jeeps were labeled &quot;owners&quot;, short for &quot;owner-type&quot; jeeps, and are used non-commercially. To distinguish it from those used as public transportation, the term &quot;owner&quot; is used. The original jeepneys were refurbished military Jeeps by Willys and Ford. Modern jeepneys are now produced with engines and other parts from Japan or South Korea.

The jeepney rapidly emerged as a popular and creative way to re-establish inexpensive public transportation, much of which had been destroyed during World War II. Recognizing the widespread use of these vehicles, the Philippine government began to regulate their use. Drivers now must have special driver&#x27;s licenses. Routes are regulated and prices are fixed fares. Illegal (unfranchised) operators are referred to as &quot;&quot; operations.

Jeepneys have been reported to be exported to Papua New Guinea to replace buses and vans that are too costly to import. 4,000 jeepneys were exported to Papua New Guinea in 2004 with considerations to export them to Guam, India and Vietnam.

Recently, the jeepney industry has faced threats to its survival. Most of the larger builders have gone bankrupt or have switched to manufacturing other products, with the smaller builders forced to go out of business. Jeepney drivers also face rising cost of living and rising cost of diesel fuel due to government deregulation of oil prices. A 2017 study published in a Metro Manila newspaper compared the fuel use of a 16-passenger jeepney to a 54-passenger air-conditioned bus and found that the fuel consumption for both was the same, while no data was given for private vehicles.

The planned construction of bus rapid transit (BRT) systems in Manila and Cebu might lead to the removal of jeepneys.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, public buses and jeepneys were subject to strict lockdown measures that affected the livelihoods of those in the transport sector. Jeepney drivers struggled with the effects of lockdowns and other disease containment measures. In 2020, jeepney drivers filed a case with the Supreme Court against the government&#x27;s COVID-19 policies, which they argue were prejudicial to their livelihood and deprived them of income to provide for their families.

===Fleet modernization===


In 2016, the Department of Transportation imposed an age limit on jeepneys of 15 years, with older jeepneys starting to be phased out. Many jeepney operators oppose the phase-out, and George San Mateo, leader of the &quot;No to Jeepney Phaseout&quot; Coalition, called the modernization program &quot;corrupt&quot;. Leyte Representative Martin Romualdez urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to drop its jeepney modernization program. As part of the PUV modernization program all new and existing vehicles must be fitted with a tap card system which allows commuters to pay for their trip. After multiple failed attempts at implementation and crippling technical issues surrounding the existing Beep Card many of the proposed systems were rejected by the Department of Transportation (DOTr). Additionally, all Jeepney Drivers and Operators are urged to form or become a member of a Transport Cooperative or consolidated franchise as part of the modernization program.

== Design ==

Body designs of jeepneys vary by region. Some are plainly colored, while others can use massive variety. Some jeepneys can be decorated with stickers or spray paint, with designs consisting of caricatures, illustrations, or pictures inspired by popular cultures, such as actors and actresses, cartoons, animes, comics, games, or movie characters, abstract designs and lines, religious icons, and others.
In the central island of Cebu, the bulk of jeepneys are built from second-hand Japanese trucks, originally intended for cargo. These are euphemistically known as &quot;surplus trucks&quot;. Popular jeepney manufacturers in Cebu are Chariot and RDAK, known for its &quot;flat-nosed&quot; jeepneys made from surplus Suzuki Carry (also known as multicab) and Isuzu Elf trucks, which are no longer in use in Japan owing to road tax and obsolescence in their country of origin. These are equipped with high-powered sound systems, and racing themes, and are said to be bigger and taller than those in Manila.

In Bulacan, particularly in the city of Malolos, shorter extended &quot;owner&quot; jeeps called &quot;Karatig&quot; are used for short-distance, inter-city transportation. The size varies, with approximately of passenger space which is longer than and can seat at least twice as many passengers as private-use &quot;owner&quot; jeeps. The &quot;Karatigs&quot; are less ergonomic and fuel-efficient compared to the more standard-size public utility jeeps dominating the rest of the country. Despite this awkward size, &quot;Karatig&quot; jeeps&#x27; unique and even &quot;cute&quot; size has become an icon contributing to the culture and experience of Bulacan public transportation.

Nelson-type jeepneys are manufactured in Davao City and are known there as &quot;uso-uso&quot;. The designs of these jeepneys are very different from the traditional style. These jeepneys feature modern front grille and body designs, lowered ride height, and industrial-quality paint jobs. Newer models of Nelson-type jeepneys feature chrome wheels, equipped with radial tubeless tires. They are almost always equipped with a powerful stereo system, so they are often referred to as &quot;mobile discos.&quot;

Many manufacturers are moving to build modern-looking jeepneys such as Hummer and Jeep Wrangler Rubicon lookalikes and oversized van-style passenger jeepneys with headlights, hoods, bumpers and other components salvaged from AUVs and sport utility vehicles like the Honda CR-V or the Toyota Tamaraw. In Iloilo City, jeepneys called &quot;passad&quot; are known for bearing a resemblance to sedans or pickup trucks, with the front fascia taken off an existing SUV or AUV. The vehicle&#x27;s body has a much lower profile which resembles more of a sedan chassis with an elongated body.

In the Cordillera Administrative Region, especially in Baguio City and Benguet province, they have jeeps fitted with truck wheels, or jeeps based on a heavy truck platform, frame, and engine. The same goes for other parts of the Philippines with unpaved roads.

The launching of the jeepney modernization program raised concerns that the jeepney&#x27;s iconic look would be erased by other designs that would make them look like buses. In response, the LTFRB reassured the public that modern jeepneys can retain their traditional look. Several lawmakers have pushed to retain the jeepney&#x27;s iconic design in modern jeepneys.

=== 2nd-generation jeepneys ===


Fully assembled with refurbished engines, some also have air-conditioning units, which are popular in Makati. Most of these jeepneys have radically expanded passenger capacities, and are often flamboyant and noisy. Many jeepneys from this generation run on diesel fuel, though very rarely with gasoline and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).

Passenger jeepneys from this generation and beyond may employ tailgates especially if they traverse expressways. These are usually rigged mechanically to be controlled from the driver&#x27;s side in lieu of electronic locking systems.

=== 3rd-generation jeepneys ===
Two kinds of 3rd-generation jeepneys have surfaced over the years: Modernized jeepneys and truck-and-van-based jeepneys.

Modernized jeepneys are manufactured using new engine components and are built with air-conditioning, particularly with recent Euro 4 engine standards imposed in the country. Though some keep the traditional body of the contemporary jeepney, many of these closely resemble a minibus. Their doors may be situated at the side, or at the front, with doors functioning like that of an actual bus.

Cab/chassis variants of jeepneys are based on pick-up trucks and van platforms wherein local coachbuilders assemble rear bodies for passenger and cargo hauling purposes. Their doors are situated at the back as a tailgate and usually have parallel bench seats that can be lifted for more cargo space and air conditioning that may be standard or optional to some car manufacturers. These kind of vehicles are referred to as FB-type vans.

Early examples of the modern type of jeepney include the Toyota Tamaraw, Ford Fiera, and the Mitsubishi Cimmaron (Which predates the Tamaraw and Fiera by a whole decade, introduced as far back as 1961) which had parallel benches offered standard by their respective manufacturers. They were introduced back in the 1970s and were an alternative to the aging jeepney. Modern examples include the pick-up based Toyota Hilux, ISUZU IPV and Mitsubishi L200 to the van-based Hyundai H100, Mitsubishi L300, Kia K-2500 Karga, Isuzu Traviz and even truck-based Mitsubishi Fuso Canter, Hino Dutro and Isuzu N-Series to name a few.

Although they are often seen as commercial van rather than actual jeepneys, they are popularly used as school buses, delivery vehicles, and other modes of public transportation, mainly UV Express, though used sparingly in comparison to actual commercial vans such as the Toyota HiAce or the Nissan Urvan.

=== Modern jeepneys ===

Modern jeepneys are an updated version of the third-generation models, featuring additional regulatory standards. These include standardized seating, increased vehicle height, CCTV, fare collection systems (both traditional and Beep), speed limiters, GPS, and Wi-Fi. Typically, brand-new jeepneys of this generation are issued to transport cooperatives and are manufactured by major vehicle producers. However, some modern jeepneys are also built by coachbuilders, provided they adhere to the specified standards. Many modern jeepneys resemble truck vans in design and aesthetics, often featuring a hoodless front due to their industrial manufacturing process. This design choice makes them look more like buses than traditional jeepneys.

There are at least 3 classifications categorized by manufacturers, Class 1 is based on vans or microvans chassis cabs. Like 3rd-generation jeepneys, they have rear bodies made by coachbuilders, but the only difference is that they are taller in height and their passenger doors are now situated on the side. Classes 2 and 3 are based on medium-duty trucks (Often converted to a bus) or an actual minibus.

Class 1 and 2 PUVs have their seating configuration facing sidewards while Class 3 are front-facing seat configuration. For truck vans and minibuses, vehicle manufacturers/coachbuilders can sometimes offer both Class 2 and Class 3 configurations on their models.

=== E-jeepneys ===
Local automobile parts manufacturers are now planning the production of electric jeepneys. Electric jeepneys are now widely deployed in several parts of Metro Manila and in some provinces, either as a staple transportation that completely replaces conventional jeepneys or as a service vehicle. The deployments were in response to calls for reduced greenhouse gas emissions and the fluctuations in oil prices. E-jeepneys have come into the economic question as the average cost per kWh of electricity in the Philippines is unsustainable for owner-operators. However, considering the uncertainty in diesel prices, e-jeepneys seem more economical in the long run compared to diesel-fueled jeepneys.

In early 2023, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board assured the public that the modernization program could retain the traditional jeepney&#x27;s iconic look. Amid the proliferation of air-conditioned minibuses, often called &quot;modern jeepneys&quot;, local companies such as Francisco Motor Corp. plan to modernize jeepneys while keeping the jeepney&#x27;s traditional design intact.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The jeepney is the cheapest way to commute in the Philippines. Because of its open rear door design, picking up and dropping off is easy for both passengers and drivers, they can stop anywhere unlike buses. But also because of this convenience, some jeepney drivers are a source of traffic congestion by indiscriminately loading and unloading passengers in the middle of the street, blocking traffic and risking the safety of some passengers. Some drivers engage in practices such as jostling over passengers, blocking other jeepneys to get passengers in the middle of the lane and trip-cutting (not completing the route, dropping off passengers if there are less than three to return to the jeepney stand and wait for a new set of passengers as it is not profitable for them to continue the route). Hence, some people are requesting that this mode of transportation be phased out.

Some jeepneys have distorted subframes and poor emissions.

In response to the cons of the jeepneys, a modernization program has been launched. Newly manufactured jeepneys, such as e-jeepneys and modernized diesel jeepneys, are required to have at least a Euro 4-compliant engine or an electric engine and must contain safety features like speed limiters, accessibility features like ramps and seatbelts, closed-circuit television cameras, Wi-Fi and USB ports, GPS, and a dashboard camera. Motor manufacturers such as Toyota (and their truck subsidiary Hino), Mitsubishi (and their truck subsidiary Fuso), Isuzu, Hyundai, and even some Chinese truck brands such as Foton presented their own prototypes of the modernized jeepneys.

== Flying LuftCar super-jeepney==
In 2024, LuftCar signed a Memorandum of understanding with eFrancisco Motor Corporation in the Philippines, to develop, integrate, deploy, brand and market a series of Pinoy flying LuftCar super-jeepney (hydrogen Jeepney van eVTOL built around eFrancisco&#x27;s vehicle chassis for island hopping).

== In popular culture ==
*When season 5 of the American reality TV show &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; came to the Philippines in 2004, a segment of jeepney manufacturing was one of the tasks part of the eleventh leg. The episode, which was broadcast the same year, was shot at the Malagueña Motors factory.
*A BBC television program in 2011 called &quot;Toughest Place to be a … Bus Driver&quot;, a London bus driver goes to Manila and has to experience driving a jeepney around the busy streets of the city.
*In the first season of the Canadian reality TV show &quot;Don&#x27;t Drive Here&quot; in 2014, host Andrew Younghusband traveled to Manila with the goal of safely driving a jeepney through Manila as his final day challenge for the trip. After driving nearly 2/3rds of his 15 km route through Manila, he failed the challenge after accidentally switching the ignition off with his knee whilst in an intersection, and having the light turn red as he restarted the engine and proceeded forward (thus running the red light).
*In 2015 during his papal visit in the Philippines, Pope Francis rode a customized jeepney as a popemobile built by ECTK Solutions.

*In April 2022, Toro Y Moi released his seventh studio album, &quot;MAHAL&quot; with the cover featuring a custom-built (working) jeepney in front of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco&#x27;s Bay Area.
*One of the host city logos for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup, in particular the Manila host city logo, features a jeepney.
*In the BBC series &quot;Full Circle with Michael Palin&quot;, the host drives a jeepney while in the Philippines.

<text>PAMS Productions, Inc. (an acronym for Production, Advertising and Merchandising Service), based in Dallas, Texas, was one of the most famous jingle production companies in American broadcasting. It produced identification packages for radio stations around the world, as well as some commercial music.

==History==

The company was founded by William B. Meeks, Jr. (1921–1999) in 1951.

Meeks worked on the air and also sold advertising, often creating jingles for some of the clients he sold time to. Eventually he decided to devote all his time to advertising, and in 1951 he started PAMS Advertising Agency, Inc. Initially, very few station jingles were made, and it wasn&#x27;t until the mid-1950s that individual cuts were assembled into packages that could be syndicated to stations all over the country.

After the success of the first few PAMS jingle series, the company&#x27;s focus slowly shifted to providing IDs to the ever growing number of top-40 radio stations. By the end of 1964, PAMS&#x27; primary business had become station jingles, and the name of the company was shortened to PAMS, Inc.

Soon, PAMS was a leader in the usage of pre-recorded backing tracks with new vocals over them to create the syndication of ID Jingles.

It suspended operation in 1978, and for the next 12 years, PAMS jingles were produced under the CPMG/PAMS moniker run by Ken R. Deutsch (in Toledo, Ohio) and Benjamin R. Freedman (December 26, 1949—January 9, 2013) (both in the Buffalo, New York, area and Dallas, Texas). In 1990, the original PAMS corporation, including all its copyrights, was purchased by JAM Creative Productions (also based in Dallas).

JAM currently produces new versions of the classic PAMS jingle packages over the original &quot;PAMS&quot; backing tracks but technically is still a separate company from PAMS. JAM founder Jonathan M. Wolfert was employed by PAMS before he and wife Mary Lyn Wolfert started their own company in 1974.

Many of PAMS jingle packages were used exclusively in the 1960s and early 1970s by stations worldwide, including WABC in New York City, WLS in Chicago, European offshore radio stations like Wonderful Radio London and Swinging Radio England, and BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2 in the United Kingdom, KLCBS FM Bandung in Indonesia.

PAMS address was just as famous as its jingles. The studios were located at 4141 Office Parkway, which is now part of the Cityplace district of Dallas. It was also the home of Thompson Creative which entered the radio station ID business in the mid-1980s.

<doc id="884972" wikidata="Q322210" url="?curid=884972" title="Edwin Franko Goldman">
<text>Edwin Franko Goldman (January 1, 1878 – February 21, 1956) was an American composer and conductor. One of the most significant American band composers of the early 20th century, Goldman composed over 150 works, but is best known for his marches. He founded the renowned Goldman Band of New York City and the American Bandmasters Association. Goldman&#x27;s works are characterized by their pleasant and catchy tunes, as well as their fine trios and solos. He also encouraged audiences to whistle/hum along to his marches. He wrote singing and whistling into the score of &quot;On the Mall&quot; (which vies with &quot;Chimes of Liberty&quot; as his two most-enduring marches).

==Biography==

Goldman was born January 1, 1878, in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of David Henry and Selma Franko Goldman. The family moved to Evansville, Indiana in 1879 and, finally, to Terre Haute, Indiana. His father died in Terre Haute on December 18, 1886, when Goldman was only eight years old, and the following year, Selma and her four children, Edwin, Mayer, Irma and Alfred, moved to New York City. Before her marriage, Goldman&#x27;s mother was a professional pianist and part of the famous Franko Family, which made its debut at Steinway Hall in New York on September 17, 1869.

At the age of nine, Goldman studied cornet with George Wiegand at the Hebrew Orphan Asylum in New York City. In 1892, after winning a scholarship, he attended the National Conservatory of Music, where he studied music theory and played trumpet in the Conservatory orchestra. He also studied under master cornetist Jules Levy.

In 1893 he became a professional trumpet player, performing in such organizations as the Metropolitan Opera House orchestra alongside his uncle Nahan Franko, the orchestra&#x27;s concertmaster and assistant conductor. He married Adelaide Maibrunn (1885–1975) in 1908. The next year, he left the Metropolitan Opera orchestra and went to work for the publishing house Carl Fischer Music, where he remained for ten years.

Goldman founded the New York Military Band in 1911, later known as the famous Goldman Band. The band played in many summer band concerts throughout New York, especially The Green at Columbia University and then The Mall in Central Park. In the 1930s the band performed three nights a week at the bandstand in Brooklyn&#x27;s Prospect Park. They were also heard on many radio broadcasts. A feature every concert was the encore, almost always Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot; or Goldman&#x27;s own march composition &quot;On the Mall&quot; accompanied by the audience singing the theme. From 1920 to 1926, Goldman moonlighted as the first professional &quot;coach&quot; of the bands at Columbia University, directing both the Columbia University Marching Band and the university&#x27;s symphonic band.

During their nearly 50 years of their marriage, Adelaide wrote lyrics for several of Goldman&#x27;s more popular pieces (including &quot;On the Mall&quot;).

Goldman was known for his very congenial personality and dedication to music. He was very close to city officials and earned three honorary doctorates. Eventually in 1929, he founded the American Bandmasters Association and served as Second Honorary Life President after John Philip Sousa.

Edwin Franko Goldman died at Montefiore Hospital in New York on February 21, 1956, and his son Richard Franko Goldman succeeded him as conductor of the Goldman Band. For his contribution to the radio industry, Goldman has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6410 Hollywood Boulevard. The Goldman Band Shell in Allentown, Pennsylvania&#x27;s West Park is also named in his honor. For over 100 years, the band shell has been the home to the Allentown Band, of which Goldman was the first guest conductor in 1927.

In his lifetime, Goldman composed over 150 works, his most famous being:

<text>Daniil Ivanovich Kharms (;  – 2 February 1942) was a Russian avant-gardist and absurdist poet, writer and dramatist in the early Soviet era.

==Early years==
Kharms was born as Daniil Yuvachev in Saint Petersburg, then the capital of the Russian Empire, into the family of Ivan Yuvachev, a member of the revolutionary group &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot;. By the time of his son&#x27;s birth, Ivan Yuvachev had already been imprisoned for his involvement in subversive acts against Tsar Alexander III and had become a philosopher.

Daniil invented the pseudonym Kharms while attending Saint Peter&#x27;s School. While at Saint Peter&#x27;s, he learned the rudiments of both English and German, and it may have been the English words &quot;harm&quot; and &quot;charm&quot; that he incorporated into &quot;Kharms&quot;. His pseudonym might have been also influenced by his fascination with Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes, as the two words (Holmes and Harms) start and end similarly but there are a number of other theories regarding the pseudonym. Throughout his career, Kharms used variations on this name and the pseudonyms DanDan, Khorms, Charms, Shardam, and Kharms-Shardam, among others.

In 1924, he entered the Leningrad Electrotechnicum, from which he was expelled for &quot;poor attendance,&quot; &quot;not participating in community service,&quot; and not &quot;fitting into the class physiologically&quot;.

==Career==
After his expulsion, Kharms gave himself over entirely to literature. He joined the circle of Aleksandr Tufanov, a sound-poet, and follower of Velimir Khlebnikov&#x27;s ideas of zaum (or trans-sense) poetry. He met the young poet Alexander Vvedensky at this time, and the two became close friends and collaborators.

In 1927, the Association of Writers of Children&#x27;s Literature was formed, and Kharms was invited to be a member. From 1928 until 1941, Kharms continually produced children&#x27;s works, to great success.

In 1928, Kharms founded the &quot;avant-garde&quot; collective Oberiu, or Union of Real Art. He embraced the new movements of Russian Futurism laid out by his idols, Khlebnikov, Kazimir Malevich, and Igor Terentiev, among others. Their ideas served as a springboard. His aesthetic centered around a belief in the autonomy of art from real world rules and logic, and that intrinsic meaning is to be found in objects and words outside of their practical function.

In 1928, his play &quot;Elizaveta Bam&quot; (&quot;Елизавета Бам&quot;) premiered; it is said to have foreshadowed the Theatre of the Absurd. The play begins with Elizaveta being arrested by the secret police for the murder of one of the arresting officers, who is later killed by another character, and ends with the first scene repeating. It has been compared to Kafka&#x27;s &quot;Trial&quot; and Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Invitation to a Beheading&quot; for its &quot;depiction of a hapless individual destroyed by arbitrary governmental authority.&quot;

By the late 1920s, his anti-rational verse, nonlinear theatrical performances, and public displays of decadent and illogical behavior earned Kharms – who dressed like an English dandy with a calabash pipe – the reputation of a talented and highly eccentric writer.

In the late 1920s, despite rising criticism of the Oberiu performances and diatribes against the avant-garde in the press, Kharms sought to unite progressive artists and writers of the time (Malevich, Filonov, Terentiev, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Kaverin, Zamyatin) with leading Russian formalist critics (Viktor Shklovsky, Yuri Tynianov, Boris Eichenbaum, Lev S. Ginzburg, etc.) and a younger generation of writers (all from the OBERIU crowd: Alexander Vvedensky, Konstantin Vaginov, Nikolai Zabolotsky, Igor Bakhterev), to form a cohesive cultural movement of &quot;Left Art&quot;.

Kharms was arrested in 1931 and exiled to Kursk for most of a year. He was arrested as a member of &quot;a group of anti-Soviet children&#x27;s writers&quot;, and some of his works were used as evidence in the case. Soviet authorities, having become increasingly hostile toward the avant-garde in general, deemed Kharms&#x27; writing for children anti-Soviet because of its refusal to instil materialist and social Soviet values. Kharms continued to write for children&#x27;s magazines when he returned from exile, though his name would appear in the credits less often. His plans for more performances and plays were curtailed, the OBERIU disbanded, and Kharms receded into a mostly private writing life.

In the 1930s, as mainstream Soviet literature was becoming more and more conservative under the guidelines of Socialist Realism, Kharms found refuge in children&#x27;s literature. (He had worked under Samuil Marshak at Detgiz, the state-owned children&#x27;s publishing house since the mid-1920s, writing new material and translating children&#x27;s literature from the west, including Wilhelm Busch&#x27;s Max and Moritz). Many of his poems and short stories for children were published in the &quot;Chizh (Чиж)&quot;, &quot;Yozh (Ëж)&quot;, &quot;Sverchok (Сверчок)&quot; and &quot;Oktyabryata (Октябрята)&quot; magazines.
In 1937 Marshak&#x27;s publishing house in Leningrad was shut down, some of employees were arrested: Alexandr Vvedensky, Nikolai Oleinikov, Nikolai Zabolotsky, Tamara Gabbe, and later – Kharms; the majority was fired.

==Legacy==
His &quot;adult&quot; works were not published during his lifetime with the sole exception of two early poems. 
His notebooks were saved from destruction in the war by loyal friends and hidden until the 1960s, when his children&#x27;s writing became widely published and scholars began the job of recovering his manuscripts and publishing them in the west and in samizdat.

His reputation in the 20th century in Russia was largely based on his popular work for children. His other writings (a vast assortment of stories, miniatures, plays, poems, and pseudo-scientific, philosophical investigations) were virtually unknown until the 1970s, and not published officially in Russia until the era of &quot;glasnost&quot;. 

Kharms&#x27; stories are typically brief vignettes often only a few paragraphs long, in which scenes of poverty and deprivation alternate with fantastic, dreamlike occurrences and acerbic comedy. Occasionally they incorporate incongruous appearances by famous authors (e.g.: Pushkin and Gogol tripping over each other; Count Leo Tolstoy showing his chamber pot to the world; Pushkin and his sons falling off their chairs; etc.).

His manuscripts were preserved by his sister and, most notably, by his friend Yakov Druskin, a notable music theorist and amateur theologist and philosopher, who dragged a suitcase full of Kharms&#x27;s and Vvedensky&#x27;s writings out of Kharms&#x27;s apartment during the blockade of Leningrad and kept it hidden throughout difficult times.

Kharms&#x27; adult works were picked up by Russian &quot;samizdat&quot; starting around the 1960s, and thereby did have an influence on the growing &quot;unofficial&quot; arts scene.

A complete collection of his works was published in Bremen in four volumes, in 1978–1988. In Russia, Kharms&#x27; works were widely published only from the late 1980s. Now, several editions of Kharms&#x27;s collected works and selected volumes have been published in Russia, and collections are available in English, French, German, Italian and Finnish. In 2004, a selection of his works appeared in Irish.

Numerous English translations have appeared of late in American literary journals. In the 1970s, George Gibian at Cornell University published the first English collection of OBERIU writing, which included stories and a play by Daniil Kharms and one play by Alexander Vvedensky. Gibian&#x27;s translations appeared in &quot;Annex Press&quot; magazine in 1978. In the early 1990s a slim selected volume translated into British English by Neil Cornwell came out in England. New translations of all the members of the OBERIU group (and their closely knit group of friends, the Chinari) appeared in 2006 in the USA (&quot;OBERIU: An Anthology of Russian Absurdism&quot;. It contains poetry, drama and prose by Alexander Vvedensky, Daniil Kharms, Nikolai Zabolotsky, Nikolay Oleynikov, Leonid Lipavsky and Yakov Druskin, edited by Eugene Ostashevsky and translated by Matvei Yankelevich, Thomas Epstein, Genya Turovskaya, Eugene Ostashevsky and Ilya Bernstein), with an introduction by Eugene Ostashevsky (not Susan Sontag, who is listed on some websites as the author of the foreword). His short story cycle &quot;Incidences&quot; (1933–1939) was published in English in 1993. An English translation of a collection of his works, by Matvei Yankelevich, &quot;Today I Wrote Nothing&quot; was published in 2007. It includes poems, plays, short prose pieces, and his novella &quot;The Old Woman&quot; (1939). Another collection in the translation of Alex Cigale, &quot;Russian Absurd: Daniil Kharms, Selected Writings,&quot; appeared in the Northwestern World Classics series in 2017. A selection of Kharms&#x27;s dramatic works, &quot;A Failed Performance: Short Plays and Scenes&quot;, translated by C Dylan Bassett and Emma Winsor Wood, was released by Plays Inverse in 2018. Individual pieces have also been translated by Roman Turovsky.

==Personal life==
Kharms was married twice, to Esther Rusakova (1909 Marseilles, France – 1943 Magadan, USSR), and Marina Malich (1909 St. Petersburg, Russia – 2002 USA). His wives sometimes appear in some of his lyrical or erotic poems.
On 23 August 1941, Kharms was arrested for spreading &quot;libellous and defeatist mood&quot;. According to the NKVD report, Kharms said:
&quot;The USSR lost the war on its first day. Leningrad will be either besieged or starved to death. Or it will be bombed to the ground, leaving no stone standing. If they give me a mobilization order, I will punch the commander in the face, let them shoot me, but I will not put on the uniform and will not serve in the soviet forces, I do not wish to be such trash. If they force me to fire a machine-gun from rooftops during street-to-street fights with the Germans, I would shoot not at the Germans, but at them, from the very same machine gun&quot;.

To avoid execution, Kharms simulated insanity; the military tribunal ordered him to be kept in the psychiatric ward of the &#x27;Kresty&#x27; prison due to the severity of the crime. Daniil Kharms died of starvation 2 February 1942 during the siege of Leningrad. His wife was informed that he was deported to Novosibirsk. Only on 25 July 1960, at the request of Kharms&#x27; sister, E.I. Gritsina, Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office found him not guilty and he was exonerated.

<text>Barbara Winifred Wright (13 October 1915 – 3 March 2009) was an English translator of modern French literature.

==Early life==
Wright was born on 13 October 1915 in Worthing, West Sussex. After attending Godolphin School in Salisbury, she studied to be a pianist at the Royal College of Music in London and trained under Alfred Cortot in Paris. Wright taught at Dora Russell&#x27;s Beacon Hill School from 1936 to 1937. In 1938 she married Walter Hubbard, a kinsman of the Barons Addington – the couple had a daughter in 1944, before separating in 1957. 

Though she never formally studied as a translator, Wright believed that her work as an accompanist helped her capture the rhythm of the text. Her first major translation was Alfred Jarry&#x27;s Ubu Roi, published in 1951 by Gaberbocchus Press.

==Translator==
Wright specialised in the translation of poetic prose and drama with a focus on French surrealist and existential writing. While working on a translation, she immersed herself in the author&#x27;s world. Reading other texts by the writer, conferring with francophones about French idioms and, where possible, forging relationships with the authors were all aspects of her process. Over the course of her career Wright worked closely with, and befriended, Raymond Queneau, Robert Pinget and Nathalie Sarraute. In addition to her translations, Wright authored literary criticism and was a regular contributor to the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; as a reviewer.

After completing translations of two short stories by Queneau, the author proposed that Wright translate his &quot;Exercices de style&quot;. The work had been deemed &#x27;untranslatable&#x27; due to Queneau&#x27;s reliance on unique French writing styles and language. Trusting her skill, Queneau encouraged and endorsed Wright&#x27;s improvised English equivalents of French turns of phrase. The result was a resounding success with her text becoming the basis for translations of the work in other languages. In 2008 it was recognised as one of the best translations during a 50-year period by the Society of Authors.

In 1953 Wright was elected a member of the College of Pataphysics, as &quot;Régente de Zozologie Shakespearienne&quot;. She was elevated to Satrape in 2001, a position she held alongside Umberto Eco and Jean Baudrillard. In 1986 Wright was appointed Commandeur of l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. She was also a two-time recipient of the Scott Moncrieff Prize. Wright was recognised in 1987 for her translation of Pierre Albert-Birot&#x27;s &quot;Grabinoulor&quot; and again in 1992 for Michel Tournier&#x27;s &quot;The Midnight Love Feast&quot;.

After separating from her husband, Wright lived at Hampstead in north London, and died on 3 March 2009. Her literary translation papers are held by the Lilly Library at Indiana University. The authors she translated who are represented in the collection include Jean Hamburger, Eugène Ionesco, Alfred Jarry, Pierre Lauer, Robert Pinget, Raymond Queneau, Nathalie Sarraute and Stefan Themerson. Correspondence from publishers of Wright&#x27;s works, including Gaberbocchus Press, John Calder, Doubleday, Faber &amp; Faber, New Directions, the Atlas Press and Red Dust, are also present.

<text>In Canada, the dean of the House () is the sitting Member of the House of Commons with the longest unbroken record of service. The dean is responsible for presiding over the election of the Speaker of the House of Commons at the beginning of each Parliament. The position is the equivalent of the Father of the House in the British House of Commons.

Following a general election, or the resignation or death of the sitting Speaker, the House meets to elect a new Speaker. This was started in 1986, though Speaker John Bosley presided at the time. The first time the modern election system for speaker was used was in 1994.

During these elections, the Dean of the House takes the role of presiding officer. If the longest-serving member is a Cabinet Minister, party Leader, House Leader or Whip, they cannot act as presiding officer. In 1994, following the 1993 Canadian federal election, Liberal member Len Hopkins filled this role as his caucus mate Herb Gray, then the longest-serving member, was in Cabinet under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. Although Gray was in cabinet, he was still referred to as Dean both in Hansard and by the press. Gray was also the longest-serving dean of the House up until that point, holding the role for 14 years from 1988 until 2002.

The current dean of the House is Bloc Québécois MP Louis Plamondon, who was first elected to the Commons as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party at the 1984 federal general election. In 2023, Plamondon eclipsed Gray as the longest-serving dean of the House, with 15 years in the role. The second-longest serving MP is currently Liberal Lawrence MacAulay, who has served continuously since the 1988 federal election. MacAulay is currently serving as a minister in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#x27;s cabinet, however, so he would not be allowed to serve as Dean should Plamondon vacate his seat. Instead, MP Hedy Fry, a Liberal first elected in 1993, would act in his place. Upon the resignation of Speaker Anthony Rota in 2023, Plamondon served for the sixth time as presiding officer in the election of the Speaker.

The chart below refers to longest-serving members, some of whom served in frontbench roles and, as such, did not preside over the election of the Speaker.

<text>Samuel Robson &quot;Rob&quot; Walton (born October 27, 1944) is an American billionaire heir to the fortune of Walmart, the world&#x27;s largest retailer. He is the eldest son of Helen Walton and Sam Walton, and was chairman of Walmart from 1992 to 2015. As of December 2024, Forbes estimated his net worth to be US$110.8 billion, making him the 13th richest person in the world. He is also the principal owner of the Denver Broncos.

==Early life and family==

Rob Walton was born on October 27, 1944, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the oldest of four children of Sam Walton (1918–1992), cofounder of Walmart, and Helen Walton (1919–2007). He has a younger brother, Jim Walton, and a younger sister, Alice Walton. Another brother, John Walton, died in 2005.

Walton attended The College of Wooster and graduated from the University of Arkansas in 1966 with a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration, where he was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He received his juris doctor degree from Columbia Law School in 1969. Walton is also a trustee at The College of Wooster.

After graduation, Walton became a member of the law firm that represented Walmart, Conner &amp; Winters in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In 1978, he left Tulsa to join Walmart as a senior vice president, and in 1982, he was appointed vice chairman. He was named chairman of the board of directors on April 7, 1992, two days after his father&#x27;s death.

Along with his siblings, he has pledged about $2 billion to the Walton Family Foundation from 2008 to 2013.

On June 7, 2022, an ownership group led by Walton entered into an agreement to purchase the Denver Broncos from the estate of Pat Bowlen for $4.65 billion, which set the record for the most expensive sale of a sports franchise in history, subject to approval from the NFL&#x27;s finance committee and a 3/4 majority of the full NFL ownership group. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was announced as added to the ownership group on July 11, 2022. The family then announced on August 2, 2022, that Lewis Hamilton would be added to the ownership group. Walton delegated most day-to-day authority to his son-in-law, Walmart chairman Greg Penner, who took over as CEO of the franchise and the public face of the ownership group.

==Personal life==
By the time he left Tulsa in 1978, Walton had three children, was divorced from his first wife, and had remarried to Carolyn Funk. He and Carolyn filed for divorce in 2000. He married his third wife Melani Lowman-Walton in 2005. His children include Carrie Walton Penner.

In 2022, due to a decline in Walmart&#x27;s share price, Rob and his siblings lost more than $27 billion.

Walton is a well-known collector of automobiles.

<doc id="884995" wikidata="Q4758164" url="?curid=884995" title="Andrew Onderdonk">
<text>Andrew Onderdonk (30 August 1848 – 21 June 1905) was an American construction contractor who worked on several major projects in the West, including the San Francisco seawall in California and the Canadian Pacific Railway in British Columbia. He was born in New York City to an established ethnic Dutch family. He received his education at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

He married Sarah Delia Hilman of Plainfield, New Jersey. After starting his career surveying town sites and roads in New Jersey, he headed west to work as a general manager for financier Darius Ogden Mills on several engineering contracts. He died in Oscawana-on-the Hudson, New York, on June 21, 1905.

==San Francisco==
His first major project was the San Francisco seawall. This project took three years and involved constructing ferry slips and seawalls for the San Francisco Harbor.
His son Andrew Jr. was born in San Francisco.

==Canadian Pacific Railway==
In 1879, Onderdonk won a series of contracts to build the western section of what is now the Canadian Pacific Railway. Working directly for the Canadian government, he built the 227 mile (365 km) section from Port Moody, 11 miles east of Vancouver and tidewater at the coast, northeastward to Savona (near Kamloops). When those sections were complete, he continued building eastward under contract with the Canadian Pacific Railway, until he ran out of rail in Eagle Pass in 1885.

Onderdonk and his wife moved to Yale, British Columbia, so that he could supervise the construction. Yale was the head of navigation for steamships on the Fraser River and very near the starting point at Emory&#x27;s Bar for his first contract. It was not until 1882 that the contract was let for the section between Yale and Port Moody.

===Chinese workers===
One of the more controversial aspects of Onderdonk&#x27;s work in British Columbia was his use of Chinese workers as labourers. From Emory&#x27;s Bar to Savona, the railway had to be built through the Fraser Canyon, whose immense cliffs required extensive and expensive tunnelling. He got permission from the Canadian government to import Chinese workers from both California and China. This solution was opposed both by the Anglo-European white population in British Columbia and the new province&#x27;s government, which wanted to attract British railway workers as settler-colonists. The Canadian government wanted to save money by hiring workers at lower costs than would be possible with British workers. The white population feared wage decreases and job loss because of competition with the Chinese, as employers took advantage of their immigrant status and lack of language skills by paying them lower wages.

Onderdonk told the Canadian government that if he could not use Chinese workers, the railway could not be built. The people and government of British Columbia were forced to accept the Canadian government&#x27;s method of keeping costs down in order to get the railway built to complete a major transportation route through the mountains and to eastern markets.

Historians estimate Onderdonk arranged to bring in six and a half thousand Chinese from China and many more thousand from California. The Chinese workers were assigned to crews separate from the white workers and often given the most dangerous jobs, including the tunnel blasting, using the highly unstable nitroglycerin explosive. Many Chinese were killed in accidents or died of scurvy during the winter. Scurvy fatalities, due to a vitamin deficiency in the diet, were high because of the workers&#x27; dietary reliance on rice. They were given rice mats as part of their pay system, and the workers had little cash to buy supplements for their food. They owed debts to the Chinese labour contractors who had sold their services to Onderdonk. Unlike the white workers, injured Chinese workers were not provided access to the company hospital. They were left to the aid of their fellow workers. At the end of construction, the Chinese labour contracting companies abandoned their charges; thousands of workers were left stranded and living in caves without food and water in the desert heat of the mountains surrounding Spences Bridge. They were not able to leave the area until white charities in Vancouver sponsored tickets for their transport back to China or California.

Discrimination and racism led to occasional fights between the Chinese workers and the white workers. A white foreman was murdered by a mob of Chinese workers at Camp 23 near Lytton after three Chinese workers were fired. Generally management considered the Chinese to be efficient, hard-working and well-behaved workers, although many thousands deserted to the goldfields rather than stay in the harsh conditions of the railway camps.

===Canadian Pacific contracts===
When Onderdonk finished the five government contracts, he undertook contracts directly with the Canadian Pacific Railway to build eastward to meet the track being built from Eastern Canada and then ended at Golden, BC. Unlike the section in the Fraser Canyon, the section east of Savona was much easier to build. The route followed the south shore of Kamloops Lake, through the city of Kamloops, then along the South Thompson River, Little Shuswap Lake, the Little River to Shuswap Lake. The line generally follows the shore of Shuswap Lake except for a short cut through Notch Hill.

Leaving the lake at Sicamous (in Onderdonk&#x27;s day called Eagle Pass Landing), the line goes up the Eagle River towards Eagle Pass. Navigable waters along this entire section of the route enabled supply of construction materials by the steamboats that traveled the Thompson and Shuswap rivers. In the summer of 1885, Onderdonk&#x27;s workers ran out of rail at a location that was later called Craigellachie. The railway construction from the east reached that point in November and the last spike was hammered home on November 7, 1885.

==Other work==
After his work for the Canadian Pacific Railway, Onderdonk was successful in gaining more contracts for railway and canal construction, mostly in eastern Canada and the United States. In 1895, Onderdonk obtained a contract from the Canadian government to build sections of the Trent-Severn Waterway in Ontario. In 1899, he tendered a bid for constructing the initial portion of the New York City Subway, but was rejected in favor of John Bart McDonald. He won the bid to remove the rock and dirt from the tunnel beneath the Hudson River and used the debris to expand Governor&#x27;s Island.

==Legacy==
*Mount Onderdonk in British Columbia was named for him; it is located in the northern Selkirk Mountains, near the head of the Goldstream River, roughly between lower Revelstoke Lake and the Wood Arm of Kinbasket Lake.
* A station on the Canadian Pacific Railway has a sign &quot;Onderdonk,&quot; located at MP 107.5 (Pitt Meadows BC), Cascade Subdivision CPR.

<text>Fox Kids (originally known as Fox Children&#x27;s Network and later as the Fox Kids Network; stylized in all caps) was an American children&#x27;s programming block and branding for a slate of international children&#x27;s television channels. Originally a joint venture between the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox) and its affiliated stations, it was later owned by Fox Family Worldwide.

The Fox Kids brand originated on a programming block that launched on the Fox network from September 8, 1990, to September 7, 2002. The block aired on Saturday mornings throughout its existence (Sunday mornings in Canada), with an additional lineup on Monday through Friday afternoons airing until January 2002. Fox Kids is the only form of daytime television programming, outside of sports, aired by the Fox network to date. Following then-Fox parent News Corporation&#x27;s sale of Fox Kids Worldwide to The Walt Disney Company in July 2001, Fox put the remaining Saturday morning timeslot up for bidding, with 4Kids Entertainment winning and securing the rights to program that period. The Fox Kids block continued to air until September 7, 2002, and was replaced the following week (on September 14) by the 4Kids-programmed FoxBox block.

Fox Kids was best known for airing the most-popular programs on the network, such as &quot;Bobby’s World&quot; and the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series, with the latter dominating the block&#x27;s schedule with increased ratings and creating a franchise, resulting in Fox Kids frequently using &quot;Power Rangers&quot; for its promotions due to the shows’ popularity.

Outside the United States, the first Fox Kids-branded television channel was launched in Australia on October 1, 1995, on cable and satellite television provider Foxtel. It then expanded to the UK and Ireland, launching on BSkyB in 1996, and after that it started broadcasts in Latin America on November of that same year. The channel expanded between 1997 and 2001 in Europe and Middle East, and beginning in 2004, the international Fox Kids channels were gradually relaunched under the Jetix brand following Disney&#x27;s acquisition of Fox Family Worldwide.

==History==
According to James B. Stewart&#x27;s book &quot;DisneyWar&quot;, Fox Kids&#x27; history is intertwined with that of the syndicated children&#x27;s program block &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot;. &quot;DuckTales,&quot; the series that served as the launching pad for &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot;, premiered in syndication in September 1987, airing on Fox&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations as well as various Fox affiliates in many markets. This may have been due to the fact that the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s chief operating officer at the time, Michael Eisner, and his then-Fox counterpart, Barry Diller, had worked together at ABC and at Paramount Pictures.

In 1988, Disney purchased independent television station KHJ-TV in Los Angeles, changing its call letters to KCAL-TV the next year. The station&#x27;s new owners wanted &quot;DuckTales&quot; to be shown on KCAL, effectively taking the local television rights to the animated series away from Fox-owned KTTV. Furious at the breach of contract, Diller pulled &quot;DuckTales&quot; from all of Fox&#x27;s other owned-and-operated stations in the fall of 1989. Diller also encouraged the network&#x27;s affiliates to do the same, though most did not initially. As Disney went forward in developing &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot;, Fox (whose schedule at the time was limited to prime time programming on Saturday and Sunday nights) began the process of launching its own children&#x27;s programming lineup.

Fox Kids was launched on September 8, 1990, as the Fox Children&#x27;s Network, a joint venture between the Fox Broadcasting Company and its affiliates. Originally headed by division president Margaret Loesch, its programming aired for 30 minutes per day on Monday through Fridays, and for 3 hours on Saturday mornings.

In September 1991, the block was rebranded as the Fox Kids Network, with its programming expanding to 90 minutes on weekdays and 4 hours on Saturday mornings. The weekday editions of the block grew to three hours the following year.

In 1994, the Fox Kids brand extended to home video, where Fox Video launched a line, Fox Kids Video, initially releasing titles based on &quot;Bobby&#x27;s World&quot;, and it was extended in 1995 to add three more shows based on the three series on the same network, &quot;Eek! the Cat&quot;, &quot;The Tick&quot; and &quot;Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;. Two years later, it was extended further in 1997 to add shows from the CBS, Marvel and Saban libraries.

===Scheduling===
Throughout most of its history, Fox Kids aired several promos for its programs during commercial breaks, with no exact time slots announced for the shows. This was due to the programs airing at different times depending on the local Fox-affiliated station&#x27;s schedule in the viewer&#x27;s television market (i.e., if Fox Kids aired a promo for a show such as &quot;Power Rangers&quot;, it would not announce an exact Monday-Friday/Saturday time slot to viewers, forcing the viewers to check their local Fox station listings, such as their TV Guide or newspaper, to search for the air time of the show, and some stations use voiceovers to announce the time slot, similar to those like first-run syndicated programs and/or PBS&#x27; PTV and later, PBS Kids block at the time).

By the fall of 1992, Fox Kids increased its schedule to three hours on Monday through Fridays, airing usually from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM local time (making Fox the first network to air programming in the 4:00 p.m. hour since 1986), and four hours on Saturdays from 8:00 AM to noon Eastern and Pacific Time (7:00 AM to 11:00 AM Central and Mountain). Many stations split the weekday lineup programming into a one-hour block in the morning and a two-hour block in the afternoon (though this varied slightly in some markets), when network programs intertwined with syndicated children&#x27;s lineups. Other stations aired all three hours combined in the afternoon due to their carriage of local morning newscasts and/or syndicated talk shows; stations that aired such programming in this case had dropped children&#x27;s programs acquired via the syndication market, moving them to other &quot;independent&quot; stations. Very few Fox stations aired all three hours of the weekday block in the morning.

In 1992, Fox Kids began holding a &quot;TV Takeover&quot; event on Thanksgiving afternoon.

====Broadcasting ambiguities====
When Fox Kids launched, it was carried on virtually all of Fox&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations and affiliates, with few (if any) declining to carry it. The first Fox station to drop the block was Miami affiliate WSVN, the network&#x27;s first station to maintain a news-intensive format, in 1993 (the station had been a Fox affiliate since January 1989 as a result of NBC purchasing and moving its programming to longtime CBS affiliate WTVJ in a three-station ownership and affiliation swap in the Miami market).

The following year, in May 1994, Fox signed a multi-station affiliation agreement with New World Communications to switch that company&#x27;s CBS, ABC and NBC affiliates to the network between September 1994, and July 1995, in order to improve its affiliate coverage in certain markets after the National Football League awarded Fox the contract to the National Football Conference television package. Many of the stations owned by New World (which later merged with Fox&#x27;s then-parent company News Corporation in July 1996) declined to carry the block in order to air syndicated programs aimed at older audiences or local newscasts. In certain cities with an independent station, or beginning with the launches of those networks in January 1995, affiliates of UPN and The WB, Fox contracted the Fox Kids block to air on one of these stations if a Fox owned-and-operated station or affiliate chose not to carry it. In some cases, Fox Kids would be carried on the same station as one of its two competing children&#x27;s blocks, The WB&#x27;s Kids&#x27; WB and UPN&#x27;s UPN Kids block (the latter of which was replaced in 1999 by Disney&#x27;s One Too).

Between 1995 and early 1996, Fox acquired three former ABC-affiliated stations (WHBQ-TV/Memphis, KTVI/St. Louis, and WGHP/High Point). Meanwhile, SF Broadcasting (a joint venture between Savoy Pictures and Fox) acquired three former NBC affiliates and one ABC affiliate during the summer of 1994 (which were later sold to Emmis Communications in 1996). Those stations all aired early evening local newscasts, but wanted to continue to run general entertainment syndicated programming to lead into their news programs instead of cartoons; these stations opted to run Fox Kids one hour early, from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM. WGHP stopped airing the block in March 1996 after the station agreed to move it to WBFX (which aired the block for the remainder of its run). In August 1995, religious independent station KNLC assumed the rights to Fox Kids from KDNL-TV (which became an ABC affiliate) after KPLR-TV turned down; however, due to the station&#x27;s decision to air public service messages from its owner&#x27;s ministry about controversial topics in lieu of local advertisements, Fox pulled the block from KNLC in mid-1996. As a result, KTVI became the only Fox station that was involved in the network&#x27;s 1994 deal with New World Communications to carry the block.

Much of the Fox Kids lineup&#x27;s early programming was produced by Warner Bros. Animation, calling Fox Children&#x27;s Network a &quot;one-stop shop,&quot; essentially pulling out of the children&#x27;s syndication market by signing a $100-million deal with Fox in May 1991. This meant they moved all their existing programming to Fox Kids. Two of Fox Kids&#x27; most popular programs, &quot;Animaniacs&quot; (following a heated dispute with Fox after it ceded the program&#x27;s timeslot to carry &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, which became one of the block&#x27;s highest-rated programs when it debuted in 1993) and &quot;&quot;, moved to The WB after that network launched in January 1995, though &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot; would remain on Fox Kids until 1997. Both &quot;Animaniacs&quot; and a slightly revamped &quot;Batman&quot; served as the linchpin of The WB&#x27;s new children&#x27;s block, Kids&#x27; WB, when it launched in September of that year (&quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, another early Fox Kids program that Warner Bros. produced and also aired on Kids&#x27; WB in reruns, had already ended its run).

In 1996, after having established a &quot;strategic alliance&quot; with Fox, Saban Entertainment merged with Fox Children&#x27;s Productions to form a new company, Fox Kids Worldwide, with aims to become a public company and pursue international expansion. In 1997, the venture was renamed Fox Family Worldwide after it acquired International Family Entertainment—owner of the cable network The Family Channel, seeking a cable outlet for the Fox Kids programs to compete with services such as Cartoon Network (owned by Time Warner) and Nickelodeon (owned by Viacom).

In 1998, Fox bought out its affiliates&#x27; interest in Fox Kids as part of a deal to help pay for the network&#x27;s NFL package. The Fox Kids weekday block was reduced to two hours, and in an effort to help its affiliates comply with the recently implemented educational programming mandates defined by the Children&#x27;s Television Act, reruns of former PBS series &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot; were added to the lineup. In 2000, affiliates were given the option of pushing the block up one hour to air from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM rather than 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM In the six or so markets where a Fox affiliate carried Fox Kids and carried an early evening newscast at 5:00 PM (such as St. Louis and New Orleans), the station was already running the block an hour early by 1996. Some affiliates (such as WLUK-TV) would tape delay the block to air between 10:00 AM and 1:00 PM, one of the lowest-rated time periods on U.S. television (and when virtually all children 5 years of age and older are at school). A few only aired &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot; in this sort of graveyard slot as an act of malicious compliance with the Children&#x27;s Television Act. Fox Kids fought vehemently against the E/I rule during its development.

===End of Fox Kids===
By 2001, members of the Fox affiliate board had felt they were on much more even footing with the &quot;Big Three&quot; networks and wanted to take back the time allocated to the Fox Kids programming blocks to air their own programming. Saturday mornings, long the only province of children&#x27;s programming, had become a liability as the other networks started to extend their weekday morning news programs to weekends.

Fox Kids, which had been the top-rated children&#x27;s program block among the major networks since 1992, had been overtaken in the ratings by ABC&#x27;s &quot;One Saturday Morning&quot; block in 1997, then by Kids&#x27; WB a year later with the stronger animation block backed by Warner Bros. that included shows such as &quot;Pokémon&quot; and &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;. ABC and UPN aired mostly comedy-based cartoons at this time, with the exception of live-action teen-oriented sitcoms &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; and &quot;Even Stevens&quot; (both originated on Disney Channel as part of what would be a gradual takeover of ABC&#x27;s Saturday morning lineup by the cable channel&#x27;s programming), while Viacom-owned CBS aired E/I compliant preschool programming from Nick Jr., and NBC aired teen-oriented sitcoms (later to be replaced the following year by E/I-compliant programming sourced from Discovery Kids), splintering the audience. The added factor of Nickelodeon&#x27;s aggressive schedule that outrated all of the broadcast networks among children on Saturday mornings left Fox Kids behind, and programmers could not find a solution to catch up. Fox Family experienced a 35% audience decline, which led to Fox Family Worldwide, the stake in Fox Kids Europe, and Saban Entertainment being sold to The Walt Disney Company in 2001. The success of &quot;Digimon&quot; helped Fox Kids temporarily return to competitiveness with Nickelodeon and The WB in February 2001; by this point the rumors of a major restructure had already begun.

After Fox Family Worldwide was sold to The Walt Disney Company in July 2001, Fox Kids was placed under the oversight of Fox Television Entertainment and moved its programming operations to Fox&#x27;s headquarters on the 20th Century Fox studio lot; Fox discontinued daytime children&#x27;s programming in December 2001, giving the time back to its affiliates. In addition, from September 2001 until the weekday block was discontinued, network flagship stations WNYW and KTTV deferred it to their UPN-affiliated sister stations while continuing to air the block on Saturday mornings. Fox put its children&#x27;s programming block up for bidding, and 4Kids Entertainment, then-producers of the English dub of &quot;Pokémon&quot;, purchased the remaining four-hour Saturday time period. Fox Kids maintained a Saturday morning-only schedule until September 7, 2002, a week before it gave the time to 4Kids Entertainment.

Fox Kids was replaced by the 4Kids Entertainment-produced FoxBox block on September 14, 2002. The block, renamed 4Kids TV on January 22, 2005, ran until December 27, 2008, marking Fox&#x27;s complete withdrawal from children&#x27;s programming, with the exception of educational programming acquired from the syndication market, most notably &quot;Xploration Station&quot;, which began airing primary on Fox stations in 2014.

===After Fox Kids===
While Fox Kids ended its existence on broadcast television in the United States, Disney instituted a two-hour morning lineup on its newly acquired ABC Family cable channel (known as the &quot;ABC Family Action Block&quot;) that was programmed similarly to Fox Kids and featured content originated on the block.

Internationally, Fox Kids Europe continued to operate the international channels in both Europe and Israel, while The Walt Disney Company themselves took over the Latin America channel. The original intention of The Walt Disney Company after the acquisition was to rebrand all Fox Kids operations outside of the US with Toon Disney, a channel that had very little distribution internationally, but this was scrapped, with 20th Century Fox Film Corporation granting a non-fixed term license for Fox Kids Europe to continue using the &quot;Fox Kids&quot; brand at no charge.

On January 8, 2004, Fox Kids Europe, Fox Kids Latin America, and ABC Cable Networks Group announced the launch of Jetix, a brand that would take over the Fox Kids networks in Europe, Israel and Latin America, and operate as a block in all other territories, including North America. Within the global launch of the brand, the Fox Kids Europe company was renamed as Jetix Europe, with the first European Fox Kids network to make the rebranding being the French feed in August 2004, and ending with the German feed&#x27;s rebranding in June 2005.

In 2010, former Fox Kids president Margaret Loesch was appointed the position of president and CEO of the then newly-launched children&#x27;s network The Hub, which replaced Discovery Kids. A few shows that have once aired on Fox Kids, such as &quot;Goosebumps&quot;, &quot;Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, and &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, were reran on The Hub. Loesch stepped down of her position as Hub Network president and CEO in late 2014, ahead of network&#x27;s rebranding to Discovery Family.

The Fox Kids name was used again for the web series &quot;Fox Kids Movie Challenge&quot;, produced by 20th Century Fox for the Fox Family Entertainment YouTube channel despite having no affiliation with the brand.

==Programming==
==Radio==
In addition to the program block, Fox Kids had its own radio program in the United States, the &quot;Fox Kids Radio Countdown&quot;. This two-hour broadcast was hosted by Chris Leary of ZDTV and TechTV fame and consisted of contests and gags, with sound effects incorporated throughout the program. It was later renamed as &quot;Fox All Access&quot; (in effect, growing up with its original audience) and served primarily as a promotional vehicle for Fox television programs, current artists, and films in its later years, before eventually ending its run in 2012.

<text>Larry Wallis (19 May 1949 – 19 September 2019) was a British rock guitarist, songwriter and producer. He was best known as a member of the Pink Fairies and an early member of Motörhead.

==Biography==
===Early bands===
In 1968, he formed a band called The Entire Sioux Nation with Terry Nolder on vocals, Tim Taylor on bass and Paul Nichols on drums (born in 1949). The band split up in late 1969.

===Shagrat (Steve Peregrin Took - first time) ===

Steve Peregrin Took and Mick Farren formed Shagrat with Wallis and his ex-Entire Sioux Nation bandmate Taylor in February 1970. Previously, Took and Farren had been with Twink and girlfriend Sally &quot;Silver Darling&quot; Melzer in a prototype Pink Fairies line-up in 1969. Twink and Melzer left the band and Twink formed Pink Fairies &quot;Mark 2&quot; in February 1970 with Farren&#x27;s former bandmates from The Deviants. The Deviants had just returned to Britain after having previously sacked Farren in Canada in late 1969, leaving Farren bandless and then found themselves stranded in North America for several months. Very soon though, Farren left after having a falling-out with Took.

Shagrat thus became Took&#x27;s band outright. Took, Wallis and Taylor were joined by drummer Phil Lenoir, formerly of Black Cat Bones. This line-up recorded three tracks at Strawberry Studios in Stockport and played one gig at the Phun City Festival in July 1970 before Taylor and Lenoir left. Took and Wallis carried on with drummer Dave Bidwell and in early 1971 the trio recorded four acoustic Took songs. All seven tracks were released in the early 1990s on limited edition vinyl and were later compiled together on the CD &quot;Lone Star&quot; in 2001 by Japanese label Captain Trip Records, later re-released in 2016 on Cleopatra Records with bonus tracks from the 1972 sessions described below.

===Blodwyn Pig, UFO and Steve Peregrin Took (second time) ===
Wallis then joined Blodwyn Pig, which changed its name to &quot;Lancaster&#x27;s Bombers&quot; (later shortened to &quot;Lancaster&quot;) with Jack Lancaster. They were a short-lived band although they toured supporting Yes in 1971.

In February 1972, Wallis joined UFO, but left in October 1972, after a tour by Europe. Wallis did not record with the band, although a bootlegged live recording of a UFO performance featuring Wallis is known to exist, as does a black and white kinescope print of a live set on French TV show &quot;Rock En Stock&quot;, in which the band play Eddie Cochrane&#x27;s Rockabilly standard, C&#x27;mon Everybody.

Sometime during 1972 Wallis recorded sessions with Steve Peregrin Took at a basement flat below Tony Secunda&#x27;s office in Mayfair. These very casual sessions contain appearances by Twink, Mick Wayne, Duncan Sanderson, and almost certainly Syd Barrett. Material from these sessions was released in 1995 as &quot;The Missing Link To Tyrannosaurus Rex&quot;, a posthumous Took solo album on Cleopatra Records

===The Pink Fairies===
In November 1972, Wallis joined the Pink Fairies, substituting for Mick Wayne. The band released an album &quot;Kings of Oblivion&quot; which contained mostly Wallis-penned tracks. The band played with an extended line-up for a special gig in July 1975. Several years later, in 1982, their only live performance was released as &quot;Live at the Roundhouse 1975&quot;. In 1991, it was reissued under the name &quot;At the Roundhouse/Previously Unreleased&quot;, comprising the original live album, plus additional songs by Larry Wallis from 1984, and an EP by Twink from 1977.

===Motörhead===
While still a member of the Pink Fairies, in May 1975 Wallis joined a new band called Motörhead with Lemmy and Lucas Fox. In September 1975 Fox left the band and Motörhead recruited a new drummer, Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor. Wallis recorded an album with the band, &quot;On Parole&quot;. It remained unreleased until 1979 when Motörhead had established some reputation for themselves. In February 1976 Wallis was joined by &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke on guitar. Later in the same month Wallis left Motörhead.

===Steve Peregrin Took (third and fourth time) ===
During 1975 and 1976, Wallis did further recording work with Took although none of these sessions have been released to date. Wallis was present, by chance, at Pathway Studios on 29 November 1977 when Steve Took&#x27;s Horns recorded material which would eventually be released in 2004.

===Stiff Records - performer and producer===
Wallis remained with Pink Fairies, which continued as a trio, until July 1976 when they gained additional guitarist, Martin Stone. In September 1976 the band released a single, &quot;Between the Lines&quot;/&quot;Spoiling for a Fight&quot; on Stiff Records. Four months later in January 1977 the band split up. In the same month Wallis guested at a one-off gig with members of Thin Lizzy and Rat Scabies of The Damned.

Wallis then became an in-house producer at Stiff Records. He released a solo single, &quot;Police Car&quot;/&quot;On Parole&quot; produced by Nick Lowe, and backed by two members of Eddie And The Hot Rods; bassist Paul Gray, and drummer Steve Nicol. &quot;Police Car&quot; has been covered by The Members and Snips. As well as appearing on a compilation album &quot;A Bunch of Stiff Records&quot;, Wallis was part of an &quot;ad hoc&quot; line-up called The Takeaways which included Dave Edmunds, Nick Lowe and Sean Tyla. Wallis took part in the &quot;Live Stiffs Tour&quot; in 1977 and appears as &#x27;Larry Wallis&#x27; Psychedelic Rowdies&#x27; on the album, &quot;Live Stiffs Live&quot;, that was released later that year.

Wallis also produced albums for a number of Stiff Records artists including Wreckless Eric, The Adverts and Mick Farren&#x27;s EP &quot;Screwed Up&quot; (November 1977) and album &quot;Vampires Stole My Lunch Money&quot; (August 1978). His song, &quot;As Long As The Price is Right&quot;, first appeared on Dr. Feelgood&#x27;s 1977 album, &quot;Be Seeing You&quot;; and a live version of the track was later issued as a single in April 1979.

In 1980, Wallis recorded an album for Stiff Records but it was left unreleased when Wallis refused to sign a seven album contract with the label and was consequently dropped. Individual tracks have surfaced on various compilations or were rerecorded by Wallis for subsequent projects.

===Farren/MC5 collaborations and his own bands===
In September 1978, Wallis became a member of another Farren project Mick Farren &amp; The Good Guys; featuring Mick Farren (vocals), Andy Colquhoun (guitar), Willy Stallybrass (harmonica), Gary Tibbs (bassist from Adam and the Ants and Roxy Music) and Alan (Hawkwind) Powell (drums).

In March 1979 Wallis joined ex-MC5 band member Wayne Kramer, Andy Colquhoun and George Butler for a series of live gigs.

In February 1982 Wallis formed Larry Wallis &amp; The Death Commandos of Love with Johnny Reverb on guitar, Big George Webley on bass and Jim Toomey on drums. This line-up was short-lived and Wallis soon began playing a regular series of gigs, mostly at Dingwalls, with a line-up completed by Duncan Sanderson, Andy Colquhoun and George Butler. This line-up began life as &#x27;The Police Cars&#x27;, playing a Christmas gig as The Police Sleighs before using a large number of aliases such as The Pearl Divers of Death, The Starry Smoothounds, The Knob Artists, The Death Commandoes of Love, The Donut Dunkers of Death (as support to The Deviants, but actually the same band with Mick Farren on vocals) before settling on the more permanent Love Pirates of Doom. This line-up lasted up until the 1987 Pink Fairies reunion, though in 1986 Sanderson was replaced by another bassist called Tony.

In 1984 Wallis was once again working with Mick Farren, who resurrected The Deviants name to record a live album, &quot;Human Garbage&quot;, featuring Mick Farren on vocals, Wayne Kramer and Wallis on guitars, Duncan Sanderson on bass and vocals, and George Butler on drums.

===Pink Fairies resurrection===
In 1987 the Pink Fairies were revived with Wallis on guitar and vocals, Andy Colquhoun on guitar, Duncan Sanderson on bass and vocals, and both Twink and Russell Hunter on drums. This resulted in the album &quot;Kill &#x27;Em and Eat &#x27;Em&quot;. By 1988 Twink had left the band, who continued to gig sporadically, even playing European gigs in Germany and France, until Wallis too left. A final throw of the dice took place on 5 March 1989 at the Bob Calvert Memorial show in Brixton Academy under the umbrellas name &#x27;Pink Fairies Psychedelic Revue&#x27; though in reality this comprised separate sets from Flying Colours (Sanderson, Hunter, Colquhoun) and Larry Wallis&#x27; Bandanna Club, featuring various friends such as Pete Thomas (drums) and Canvey Islands Kennedy brothers,

===Dr. Feelgood links===
Around 1991 Wallis worked with Lee Brilleaux and Phil Mitchell (both from Dr. Feelgood) on the &quot;On The Bench&quot; recording, with Ian Gibbons. This led to the formation of Wallis&#x27;s new band, The Redbirds, featuring Wallis (guitar, vocals), Mitchell (bass) and Chris North (drums). The Redbirds released one 12 inch EP, &quot;Truth, Justice and a Wholesome Packed Lunch&quot;. Wallis also wrote many songs that Dr. Feelgood later performed, such as &quot;As Long as the Price is Right&quot;, &quot;Punch Drunk&quot;, &quot;Talk of the Devil&quot;, and &quot;Can&#x27;t Find the Lady&quot;, among others.

===Back in business===
2001 saw the first Wallis solo album to reach release stage, &quot;Death in the Guitarfternoon&quot;. A comeback gig for The Fairies was planned for The Roundhouse, Chalk Farm, London on 22 January 2007, however, this was cancelled due to Wallis having a trapped nerve in his back. It was never rescheduled.

===Death===
Wallis died on 19 September 2019, aged 70.

<doc id="885007" wikidata="Q1700152" url="?curid=885007" title="John G. Schmitz">
<text>John George Schmitz (August 12, 1930 – January 10, 2001) was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives and California State Senate from Orange County, California. He was also a member of the John Birch Society. In 1972 he was the candidate for President of the United States of the American Independent Party, later known as the American Party.

Schmitz was notable for his extreme right-wing sympathies and for his slurs against African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics, women, Jews and homosexuals. By one measure, he was found to be the third-most conservative member of Congress between 1937 and 2002, and the ultraconservative John Birch Society, of which Schmitz was a longtime leader, later expelled him for extremist rhetoric.

On October 25, 1971, Schmitz composed an introduction to the highly controversial book &quot;None Dare Call It Conspiracy&quot; written by Gary Allen with Larry Abraham.

In 1982, after it was revealed—and Schmitz admitted—that he had engaged in an extra-marital affair and fathered two children with one of his former college students, Schmitz&#x27;s career as a politician effectively ended, as did his wife Mary&#x27;s as a conservative political commentator. His seven children with his wife include politicians John P. Schmitz and Joseph E. Schmitz, and teacher Mary Kay Letourneau, convicted in 1997 of child sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;People_7/8/2020&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmitz died in 2001 at the age of 70 from prostate cancer; the former Marine Colonel was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Early life and military career==
Schmitz was born in Milwaukee, the son of Wilhelmina (Frueh) and Jacob John Schmitz. Schmitz graduated from Marquette University High School in 1948. He obtained his B.S. degree from Marquette University in Milwaukee in 1952 and an M.A. from California State University, Long Beach, in 1960. He served as a United States Marine Corps jet fighter and helicopter pilot from 1952 to 1960, and was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Marine Corps Reserve from 1960 to 1983. Schmitz was Catholic.

==Career in the California State Senate==
After leaving the Marines, Schmitz took a job as an instructor in philosophy and political science at Santa Ana College. He also became active in the John Birch Society. His views attracted the attention of wealthy Orange County conservatives such as fast-food magnate Carl Karcher, sporting goods heir Willard Voit and San Juan Capistrano rancher Tom Rogers. His personal appearance, in particular the pencil mustache, led to remarks that he was a strong lookalike of David Niven. While his academic career was mainly teaching teenagers and older adults, Schmitz had been noted for working well with children, and used this to his advantage by working part-time at Disneyland as a &quot;Cobblestone Cop&quot;.

With their help, Schmitz managed to defeat 74th State Assemblyman Bruce Sumner for the 35th district of the California State Senate, which had been vacated by John A. Murdy Jr, who much like Sumner, was part of the moderate to liberal wing of the California Republican Party. His views were very right-wing even by the standards of Orange County. Schmitz once joked that he had joined the John Birch Society in order to court the moderate vote in Orange County. He opposed sex education in public schools. He believed citizens should be able to carry loaded guns in their cars. He was also critical of the civil unrest that characterized the mid-1960s. He called the Watts riots of 1965 &quot;a Communist operation,&quot; and a year later sponsored a bill, which failed to pass, to investigate the backgrounds of teachers suspected of Communist affiliations. He also believed that state universities should be sold to private corporations as a curb against student protests.

Schmitz wrote the foreword for &quot;None Dare Call It Conspiracy&quot;, a book written by Gary Allen, a self-described former &quot;Americans for Democratic Action liberal&quot;, speechwriter for 1968 American Independent Party candidate George Wallace and fellow John Birch Society member. Schmitz believed in Allen&#x27;s conspiracy that socialists planned to set up a one-world government where they would control the banks, natural resources, commerce, finances and transportation, as well as the idea of Richard Nixon being an agent of the Rockefeller family, who, in Allen&#x27;s opinion, had financed the Bolshevik Revolution.

==US Representative and presidential campaign==
Schmitz served in the state senate until 1970, when he won a special election to succeed the late James B. Utt in the House from California&#x27;s 35th congressional district. He won a full term in November. Much like his successor, Utt had a penchant for conspiracy theories and often spoke positively of the John Birch Society. Schmitz was one of twenty-four people in the House of Representatives to oppose the Equal Rights Amendment and described the bipartisan Comprehensive Child Development Act as a &quot;massive government intrusion&quot;.

When Richard M. Nixon, whose permanent residence at the time was in San Clemente—located in Schmitz&#x27;s district— first went to China in 1972, Schmitz was asked if he supported President Nixon&#x27;s going to China. Schmitz replied, &quot;I didn&#x27;t care that Nixon went to China, I was only upset that he came back.&quot; Nixon recruited Orange County Tax Assessor Andrew J. Hinshaw, a more mainstream Republican, to run against Schmitz in the Republican primary for the renumbered 39th District. Hinshaw defeated Schmitz by 2.7 percentage points in the primary and went on to win the general election for the seat.

Schmitz, who believed Nixon had shifted to the left in social and economic issues, served as chairman of John M. Ashbrook&#x27;s 1972 campaign for the Republican Party presidential nomination. Ashbrook competed in the New Hampshire (9.8% of the vote), Florida (9%), and California (10%) primaries, then withdrew from the race.

Schmitz, angry at Nixon&#x27;s role in his defeat and at Ashbrook&#x27;s loss in the Republican primaries, changed his party registration to the American Independent Party after being nominated as their candidate for president in the 1972 election. His running mate was Thomas J. Anderson, a fellow member of the John Birch Society. The pair received 1,100,868 votes for 1.42% of the total. Three-time Academy Award winner and fellow John Birch Society member Walter Brennan helped Schmitz with his campaign, serving as finance chairman. Schmitz&#x27;s best showings were in the West. He received 9.30 percent of the vote in Idaho, where he finished second ahead of Democrat George McGovern in the archconservative Mormon counties of Fremont, Jefferson, Madison and Lemhi. In Jefferson County, Schmitz achieved the best result for a third-party presidential candidate in any non-Southern county since 1936, when William Lemke surpassed 28 percent of the vote in the North Dakota counties of Burke, Sheridan and Hettinger. Schmitz received 7.25 percent in Alaska, 5.97 percent in Utah, and between four and five percent in Oregon, Montana, Washington State and also Louisiana.

==Return to the State Senate==
Schmitz won the District 36 state senate seat in 1978, with 49.5% of the vote, and subsequently was named chairman of the Constitutional Amendments Committee.

In 1981, Schmitz—who was staunchly anti-abortion—chaired a committee hearing on abortion. Feminist attorney Gloria Allred testified at the hearing in support of the pro-abortion rights position, and afterward sarcastically presented Schmitz with a black leather chastity belt. Schmitz&#x27;s committee then issued a press release under the headline, &quot;Senator Schmitz and His Committee Survive Attack of the Bulldykes&quot;, describing the hearing room as filled with &quot;hard, Jewish and (arguably) female faces.&quot; Allred sued Schmitz for libel, claiming $10 million in damages, but settled for $20,000 and an apology. In his apology, Schmitz stated, &quot;I have never considered her (Allred) to be ... a slick, butch lawyeress.&quot; Allred later appeared at a press conference called by Senator Schmitz regarding Mid-East issues, handed Schmitz a box of frogs and shouted, &quot;A plague on the House of Schmitz!&quot;

The incident cost him his committee chairmanship and the John Birch Society stripped him of his membership for &quot;extremism.&quot; Despite this, Schmitz announced plans to run for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate in 1982.

==Extramarital affair and fall-out==
Early in 1982, John George Stuckle, an infant born on June 10, 1981, was treated at an Orange County hospital for an injured penis. A piece of hair was wrapped so tightly around the organ—&quot;in a square knot,&quot; according to one doctor—that it was almost severed. The surgery went well and the baby suffered no permanent injury. However, the baby&#x27;s mother, Carla Stuckle, a 43-year-old Swedish-born immigrant and longtime Republican volunteer, was not allowed to take John George home since some of the attending doctors were convinced the hair had been deliberately tied around his penis. Detectives threatened to arrest Carla and take the infant away permanently unless she identified the father. Carla then identified Schmitz as John George&#x27;s father.

During a custody hearing, Schmitz acknowledged fathering John George out of wedlock. He was also the father of Carla&#x27;s daughter, Eugenie. The admission effectively ended his political career, though he made an unsuccessful run for the 38th Congressional District in 1984. He was defeated by former Congressman Bob Dornan in the Republican primary 65% to 11%, with another candidate earning 24%. Dornan would go on to defeat Democratic incumbent Rep. Jerry M. Patterson in November.

Schmitz&#x27;s affair also ended his wife Mary&#x27;s career as a political commentator on television, where she advocated from the conservative position on the political roundtable debate show &quot;Free for All&quot;. Before entering television, Mary had already become known as the &quot;West Coast Phyllis Schlafly&quot;, having campaigned vigorously against the Equal Rights Amendment. When the ERA deadline ran out, Mary had altered a cardboard tombstone Halloween decoration to show the ERA going down in defeat and displayed it prominently on her front lawn. The Schmitzes briefly separated over the affair but reconciled.

Schmitz neither financially supported nor helped raise his two children with Carla Stuckle. When the detective investigating the possible child abuse claim against Stuckle confronted Schmitz about fathering J. George, Schmitz confirmed parentage and reportedly told the officer, &quot;I do not and will not support him financially. It is her [Carla Stuckle&#x27;s] responsibility to take care of him.&quot; Stuckle was not charged with any crime, and authorities returned J. George to her care. Schmitz denied any abuse to the child or any knowledge of the injury; and was eventually ruled out as being suspect to abuse. Stuckle raised both J. George and E. on her own, working long hours at two different jobs. In 1994, when J. George and E. were 13 and 11 respectively, Carla Stuckle died from complications of Type I diabetes. Schmitz refused custody of the children. Mary Schmitz&#x27;s close friend, high-profile astrologer and alleged psychic Jeane Dixon, took in the children. When Dixon died in 1997, the children became wards of the state and went to an orphanage.

==Later life and death==

After leaving the State Senate, Schmitz taught political science courses at Rancho Santiago and Santa Ana. In 1988, Schmitz, sporting a beard in honor of Robert Bork, blamed the fall of South Vietnam on the media&#x27;s failure to report communist involvement in the anti-war movement and called Watergate a plot to distract Nixon from focusing on the Vietnam War.

In the 1980s, Schmitz moved to Washington, where he lived in a house formerly owned by Joseph McCarthy, his political idol.

In the early 1990s, Schmitz worked part time at Political Americana, a political memorabilia store, and served as president of Chapelle Charlemagne, a family-owned vineyard in Virginia, from 1995 to his death in 2001.

Schmitz died of cancer at the age of 70 on January 10, 2001. Following a packed funeral service at the Fort Myer post chapel, he was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.

An obituary printed in the &quot;Journal of Historical Review,&quot; a publication of the organization the Institute for Historical Review, described Schmitz as a &quot;good friend of the Institute.&quot; Schmitz attended at least two IHR Conferences, and was a subscriber for many years to the &quot;Journal.&quot;&quot;

<text>Beatrice Benaderet ( ; April 4, 1906 – October 13, 1968) was an American actress and comedienne. Born in New York City and raised in San Francisco, she began performing in Bay Area theatre and radio before embarking on a Hollywood career that spanned over three decades. Benaderet first specialized in voice-over work in the golden age of radio, appearing on numerous programs while working with comedians of the era such as Jack Benny, Burns and Allen, and Lucille Ball. Her expertise in dialect and characterization led to her becoming Warner Bros.&#x27; leading voice of female characters in their animated cartoons of the early 1940s through the mid-1950s.

Benaderet was then a prominent figure on television in situation comedies, first with &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot; from 1950 to 1958, for which she earned two Emmy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress. In the 1960s, she had regular roles in four series until her death from lung cancer in 1968, including the commercial successes &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, and her best-known role as Kate Bradley in &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame honoring her work in television.

== Early life ==
Beatrice Benaderet was born on April 4, 1906, in New York City. Her mother, Margaret ( O&#x27;Keefe), was Irish American, and her father, Samuel David Benaderet, a Sephardic Jewish emigrant from what is now Turkey, was a tobacconist who relocated the family from New York City to San Francisco in 1915 after his participation in the Panama–Pacific International Exposition. The same year, he opened a smoke shop that operated for 65 years, making it the oldest such retailer in California at the time of its closure in 1980.

Benaderet was raised in her mother&#x27;s Catholic faith and attended grade school at a Dominican convent. She studied voice and the piano; her first acting performance came at 11 when she portrayed a bearded old man in a school play.

The following year, her participation in a children&#x27;s production of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; resulted in a local radio station manager inviting her to a one-time performance on one of his programs, for which she was paid $10. Benaderet made her professional theatre debut at 16 in a production of &quot;The Prince of Pilsen,&quot; and, after graduating from the Academy of St. Rose, a private, all-girls&#x27; high school, she attended the Reginald Travers School of Acting and joined his stock company The Players&#x27; Guild, appearing in stage productions of works such as &quot;Polly&quot;, &quot;Lysistrata&quot;, and &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;.

== Career ==
=== Radio ===

In 1926, Benaderet joined the staff of San Francisco radio station KFRC, which was under the new ownership of Don Lee and where her duties included acting, singing, writing, and producing.

Initially seeking work as a dramatic actress, she switched to comedy and performed on multiple programs, in particular the &quot;Blue Monday Jamboree&quot; variety show, where her castmates included Meredith Willson, Elvia Allman, and future &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; producer Jess Oppenheimer. Benaderet honed a variety of dialects such as French, Spanish, New York City English, and Yiddish, the latter from voicing a character named &quot;Rheba Haufawitz&quot;. She additionally hosted the musical variety show &quot;Salon Moderne&quot; and gained attention for her work as a female announcer, a rarity in 1930s radio.

Benaderet relocated to Hollywood in 1936 and joined radio station KHJ, making her network radio debut with Orson Welles for his Mercury Theatre repertory company heard on &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot;. The following year she received her first big break in the industry on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, where she played Gertrude Gearshift, a wisecracking telephone operator who gossiped about Jack Benny with her cohort Mabel Flapsaddle (Sara Berner). Intended as a one-time appearance, the pair became a recurring role starting in the 1945–46 season, and in early 1947, Benaderet and Berner momentarily took over the NBC switchboards in Hollywood for publicity photos. She performed in as many as five shows daily, causing her rehearsal dates to conflict with those of &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; and resulting in her reading live as Gertrude from a marked script she was handed upon entering the studio.

Other recurring characters Benaderet portrayed were Blanche Morton on &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;; school principal Eve Goodwin on &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot;; Millicent Carstairs on &quot;Fibber McGee &amp; Molly&quot;; maid Gloria on &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;; and Iris Atterbury on the Lucille Ball vehicle &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;, opposite Gale Gordon. Benaderet voiced various one-time parts before joining the main cast as Iris, neighbor and friend of Ball&#x27;s character Liz Cooper. The 1950 CBS program &quot;Granby&#x27;s Green Acres&quot;, a perceived spinoff of &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;, was her one radio lead role and reunited her with Gordon as a husband and wife who abandon city life to become farmers, but it lasted only eight episodes.

=== Voice acting ===
Beginning in 1943, Benaderet became Warner Bros.&#x27; primary voice of adult female supporting characters for their &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; and &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; animated shorts, initially sharing duties with Sara Berner. Her characterizations included an obnoxious teenaged bobbysox version of Little Red Riding Hood in &quot;Little Red Riding Rabbit&quot; (1944); Witch Hazel in &quot;Bewitched Bunny&quot; (1954); the spinster hen Miss Prissy in several Foghorn Leghorn cartoons; Tweety&#x27;s owner &quot;Granny&quot; including the Academy Award-winning &quot;Tweetie Pie&quot; (1947); and Mama Bear in a series of Three Bears shorts, which animator Chuck Jones called one of his favorite portrayals. Benaderet did not receive onscreen credit for her work because she was employed by Warner Bros. as a freelance actor who voiced peripheral characters, and unlike Mel Blanc, was not under contract with the studio. In 1955, she was succeeded by June Foray as Warner&#x27;s premier female voice artist.

=== Television ===
Benaderet was Lucille Ball&#x27;s first choice as Ethel Mertz for the sitcom &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;; Ball said in a 1984 interview that she had &quot;no other picture of anyone&quot; for the role. However, Benaderet had to turn down the offer since she was contracted to the television adaptation of &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;, so Vivian Vance was eventually cast. Benaderet guest-starred on the January 21, 1952, first-season episode &quot;Lucy Plays Cupid&quot; as the character of Miss Lewis, a love-starved spinster neighbor.

Benaderet continued her &quot;Burns &amp; Allen&quot; radio role of the Burns&#x27; neighbor Blanche Morton, Gracie&#x27;s friend and staunchest supporter in her escapades. She was the only secondary cast member who appeared in every episode and the first six shows were shot live in New York, resulting in Benaderet commuting to Los Angeles, where she was working several radio assignments at the time.

Blanche Morton&#x27;s long-suffering husband, Harry, was played by four actors over the show&#x27;s eight-year run; the last, Larry Keating, was introduced on the October 5, 1953 fourth-season premiere when George Burns entered the set and halted a scene of an angered Blanche preparing to hit Harry with a book. Burns introduced Keating to Benaderet and the audience, and she broke character to exchange pleasantries with Keating. The segment then resumed and Benaderet struck Keating with the book. Benaderet and Gracie Allen regularly shopped for their own on-set wardrobe and she developed a high-pitched laugh for Blanche that became a staple of the character and was used for comic effect: &quot;When we had a scene with some silent spots in it, George would say to me, &#x27;Laugh there, Bea. Benaderet garnered two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 1954 and 1955. Following Allen&#x27;s retirement in 1958 at the end of the eighth season, the program continued as &quot;The George Burns Show&quot; in 1958–59 with Blanche repackaged as George&#x27;s secretary, but it was canceled after one season due to low ratings. Benaderet worked sparsely in 1959, filming one-time appearances on &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; and &quot;The Restless Gun&quot;.

Benaderet became a fixture on television in the 1960s, which included working on two shows simultaneously from 1960 to 1964. She played housekeeper Wilma in the lone season of the 1960 sitcom &quot;Peter Loves Mary&quot;, a part she received because of references from Burns. Benaderet considered herself &quot;lucky&quot; to be cast in another series out of fear that she had become too closely associated with &quot;Burns &amp; Allen&quot;. The same year, she was then cast as the voice of Betty Rubble in the Hanna-Barbera primetime animated series &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. Benaderet auditioned with past radio coworker Jean Vander Pyl for Betty and Wilma Flintstone by exchanging dialogue before the show&#x27;s co-creator Joseph Barbera, who asked afterward what part they preferred. Vander Pyl recalled in 1994: &quot;I said, &#x27;Oh, I want to be Wilma!&#x27; [and] Bea said, &#x27;That&#x27;s fine with me. Benaderet voiced guest spots on the side for fellow Hanna-Barbera productions &quot;Top Cat&quot; and &quot;The Yogi Bear Show&quot; during 1961 and 1962. While filming the debut season of her show &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; the next year, she continued voicing Betty by recording her part alone or with her &quot;Flintstones&quot; castmates during evening hours until scheduling conflicts forced her to drop the role at the end of the fourth season in 1964. She was replaced by Gerry Johnson.

==== Collaboration with Paul Henning ====
In the late 1940s, Benaderet befriended Paul Henning, a scriptwriter on the radio production of &quot;Burns &amp; Allen&quot;. She appeared on the 19 episodes of the show he had written between 1947 and 1951. She became one of his regular players in the first two seasons of &quot;Burns &amp; Allen&quot;, a two-episode guest appearance on &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot; in 1956–57, and her involvement in three of the most successful sitcoms of the 1960s. After reading the 1961 first script for &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, Benaderet wanted to audition for the role of Granny. Despite considering her to be too buxom for his vision of the character as a small and wiry woman, Henning allowed her to test anyway. Irene Ryan ultimately won the role; according to Henning, &quot;Bea took one look at the way Irene did the part and said to me, &#x27;There&#x27;s your Granny! He additionally took Benaderet&#x27;s suggestion of casting Harriet MacGibbon as Granny&#x27;s rival Margaret Drysdale. Henning created for Benaderet the supporting character of Cousin Pearl Bodine, the middle-aged widowed mother of Jethro Bodine (Max Baer Jr.) and cousin of main character Jed Clampett (Buddy Ebsen), whom she convinces to move from his humble home in the Ozarks after he strikes oil on his property and becomes a millionaire. Prior to shooting the pilot, Benaderet enlisted a dialect coach to help her learn a hillbilly accent. Impressed with her performance while screening the pilot to potential sponsors, Henning made Cousin Pearl a recurring character in the 1962–63 first season as she moved into the Clampetts&#x27; Beverly Hills mansion, feuded with Granny, and pursued oil tycoon Mr. Brewster (Frank Wilcox) as a love interest. Bluegrass duo Flatt and Scruggs, who performed the show&#x27;s opening theme, recorded a comedic serenade in 1963 titled &quot;Pearl Pearl Pearl&quot; and Benaderet was pictured on the single&#x27;s cover. Benaderet described Pearl&#x27;s curly hair as &quot;just my mental image of the character. ... Pearl played the piano for the silent movies and she saw such high fashion and ridiculous hairdos. She could read and write, and the curled hair seemed to Pearl the height of smartness.&quot;

Henning had long admired Benaderet&#x27;s talents and strove to create a starring vehicle for her, as he felt she was worthy of headlining her own series after years of supporting parts. When CBS granted him an open time slot after the massive success of &quot;Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, he crafted the 1963 rural sitcom &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; around Benaderet, starring as Kate Bradley, the widowed proprietor of the Shady Rest Hotel. Cousin Pearl was consequently written out of the &quot;Beverly Hillbillies&quot; storyline as having moved back home. The character of Kate represented Benaderet&#x27;s first straight role: &quot;Kate Bradley is different from the characters I&#x27;ve played in the past. She has to walk a fine line between being humorous and tender. The other women I&#x27;ve played were strictly for laughs.&quot; Benaderet and director Richard Whorf auditioned the young actresses who would play Kate&#x27;s three teenaged daughters; she persuaded Henning to let his 18-year-old daughter Linda read (successfully) for the role of Betty Jo Bradley. Linda Henning and Benaderet&#x27;s son, Jack Bannon, were members of a young actors&#x27; theater group at the time. CBS promoted the show&#x27;s September 22, 1963, premiere with a print ad featuring an Al Hirschfeld caricature of Benaderet as Cousin Pearl. &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; was an immediate hit, peaking at fourth in the Nielsen ratings, and remained in the top 30 during Benaderet&#x27;s four full seasons on the show from 1963 to 1967. Her former &quot;Flintstones&quot; costars Alan Reed and Jean Vander Pyl filmed guest spots in later seasons.

Henning was again given free rein for a new show with no pilot needed, which he bestowed to colleague Jay Sommers due to his busy schedule. Sommers created the 1965 sitcom &quot;Green Acres&quot;, adapted from his 1950 radio program &quot;Granby&#x27;s Green Acres&quot; that had starred Benaderet, thus making it a spinoff of her own television show. Benaderet filmed six appearances as Kate in the first season as both shows&#x27; casts intermingled on several episodes in a process dubbed &quot;cross-pollination&quot;.

=== Film and other works ===
Benaderet played bit parts in six motion pictures from 1946 to 1962, four of which were uncredited. She was chosen from 200 actresses for the part of a government file clerk in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Notorious&quot; (1946) and completed filming in half an hour, but her scenes were cut from the final print. She told &quot;Radio Life&quot; magazine that year that after having struggled to remember her lines, &quot;Mr. Hitchcock looked me right in the eye and asked &#x27;You want to go back to radio?&#x27; I said yes&quot;. Her first onscreen appearance, also uncredited, was in the film &quot;On the Town&quot; (1949), as one of two women whom the main characters (played by Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra) encounter while riding the subway.

In 1945, Benaderet and fellow voice actresses Janet Waldo and Cathy Lewis were to appear on a televised fashion show on her former KFRC employer Don Lee&#x27;s W6XAO network before the project fell through. On Irving Taylor&#x27;s novelty album &quot;Drink Along with Irving&quot; (1960), she duetted with Elvia Allman and Mel Blanc, respectively, on tracks titled &quot;Sub-Bourbon Living&quot; and &quot;Separate Bar Stools&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Benaderet and her first husband, actor Jim Bannon, met while employed at KHJ in Los Angeles. They married in August 1938 and had two children: Jack (1940–2017), and Maggie (b. 1947). However, Bannon&#x27;s heavy filming and touring schedule required for his portrayal of fictional cowboy hero Red Ryder took a toll on their marriage and she filed for divorce in September 1950. In 1958, Benaderet married Eugene Twombly, a sound-effects technician for movies and television who had worked on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, and they remained together until her death in 1968. Her son Jack became an actor, making his television debut in bit parts on &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; (and working on the show as a dialogue coach), later appearing in &quot;Lou Grant&quot;.

In 1961, Benaderet dressed in a &quot;Flintstones&quot;-inspired leopard-print costume to collect donations for City of Hope and March of Dimes and worked with Welcome Wagon in the San Fernando Valley. On February 5, 1964, she was named an honorary sheriff of Calabasas, California, with her daughter Maggie accepting a badge on her behalf that was presented by her &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; co-star Edgar Buchanan in a public ceremony.

== Illness and death ==

During a routine checkup in 1963, a spot was discovered on one of Benaderet&#x27;s lungs. It was no longer visible at the time of her follow-up visit, but by November 1967, it had returned and grown in size. She resisted immediate exploratory surgery, as she was filming the fifth season of &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; and feared the show would be affected by her absence. On November 26, she underwent the surgery at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, when it was discovered the tumor could not be removed. Diagnosed with lung cancer, Benaderet underwent six weeks of radiation treatment via a linear particle accelerator at Stanford University Medical Center. A longtime smoker, she cut down her multiple-pack-a-day habit following her initial checkups and quit entirely after her surgery.

Benaderet&#x27;s treatment was initially successful and concluded in January 1968. She had missed 10 episodes of the show as she recuperated, during which her character of Kate Bradley was vaguely described in the storyline as being out of town. Expectations were that Benaderet would eventually recover and be able to resume filming. Rosemary DeCamp (Kate&#x27;s sister Helen) and Shirley Mitchell (Kate&#x27;s cousin Mae Jennings) filled in as temporary mother figures during her absence; Mitchell had previously worked with Benaderet on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; in 1954–55 as Mabel Flapsaddle. Benaderet returned for the March 30 fifth-season finale &quot;Kate&#x27;s Homecoming&quot;, but five months later, after shooting the first three episodes of the sixth season, she took leave from the series due to being too ill to continue. Initial plans were for her to record her voice to be inserted into future episodes. However, her condition dramatically declined; on September 26, chest pains related to her illness forced her to return to the hospital for the final time. The fourth show of the sixth season, &quot;The Valley Has a Baby&quot;, marked Benaderet&#x27;s last episode and featured only her voice with her stand-in filmed from the rear.

Benaderet died on October 13, 1968, of lung cancer and pneumonia, at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles. She was entombed in Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in North Hollywood. On October 17, four days after her death and the day after her funeral, her husband Eugene Twombly died at the age of 54 from a massive heart attack and was interred beside her.

== Acting style and reception ==

When Benaderet was cast in &quot;Petticoat Junction,&quot; she was hailed as having &quot;finally&quot; become a star. She had previously played supporting roles throughout her career, usually as a next-door neighbor, and had been openly averse to leading roles. However, in January 1963, following CBS&#x27; acquisition of &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, she enthused to columnist Eve Starr of &quot;The Mercury&quot;: &quot;Isn&#x27;t it nice? After all these years. ... [It] just never occurred to me that it might...golly, my own show!&quot; Benaderet often discussed facets of the acting profession in promotional interviews for the show, and believed that leading a series required a &quot;feeling of responsibility&quot;, including her being more observant of on-set activity and her costars&#x27; performances, while continuously evolving her character.

Benaderet garnered praise for her mastery of dialects and her work as a comedienne and character actress, while she is recognized for her voice characterizations in animation. MeTV considered her an &quot;icon&quot; of 1960s television. Donna Douglas said, &quot;Watching her timing is like watching a ballerina. She&#x27;s so effortless.&quot; Benaderet credited George Burns with mentoring her in comedy acting, but claimed that television scriptwriters focused more on her voice and delivery than her characters, which she believed stunted opportunities for her to play more dramatic roles. For her contributions to television, Benaderet received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960, on 1611 Vine Street, and she was the recipient of a Genii Award in 1966.

She is credited with over 1000 combined radio and television episode appearances, which earned her the nickname of &quot;Busy Bea&quot; from members of the press. &quot;The Pantagraph&quot; columnist Ernie Kreiling remarked in 1965 that &quot;probably no Hollywood personality has spent as many hours in our homes&quot;. Benaderet was good friends and a frequent collaborator with Mel Blanc, who wrote in his 1988 biography &quot;That&#x27;s Not All Folks!:&quot; &quot;[We] spent so much time together in studios that I used to refer jokingly to her as the &#x27;other woman&#x27; in my life.&quot;

Keeping the spelling of her surname, which has been misspelled as &quot;Benederet&quot; or &quot;Benadaret&quot;, was a choice she insisted on. She first resisted requests to change it early in her radio career: &quot;[T]hey&#x27;d say, &#x27;Anything&#x27;s better than Benaderet—How about Smith?&#x27;&quot; When she was introduced to Orson Welles in 1936, he remarked that her name &quot;sounded like something you ad lib in a mob scene.&quot; It was misspelled in a 1946 press release created specifically about its proper spelling, and &quot;Radio Life&quot; wrote in 1947: &quot;If someone were to conduct a survey to decide the radio personality with the most frequently misspelled name, Bea Benaderet would probably win hands down.&quot; Early in the first season of &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;, her full name appeared as &quot;Bee Benadaret&quot; in the closing credits.

<text>Joan Ganz Cooney (born Joan Ganz; November 30, 1929) is an American television writer and producer. She is one of the founders of Sesame Workshop (formerly &quot;Children&#x27;s Television Workshop&quot; or CTW), the organization famous for the creation of the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, which was co-created by her. Cooney grew up in Phoenix and earned a Bachelor of Arts in education from the University of Arizona in 1951. After working for the State Department in Washington, D.C., and as a journalist in Phoenix, she worked as a publicist for television and production companies in New York City. In 1961, she became interested in working for educational television, and became a documentary producer for New York&#x27;s first educational TV station WNET (Channel 13). Many of the programs she produced won local Emmys.

In 1966, Cooney hosted what she called &quot;a little dinner party&quot; at her apartment near Gramercy Park. In attendance was her then-husband Tim Cooney, her boss Lewis Freedman, and Lloyd Morrisett, an executive at the Carnegie Corporation, in which the potential of television to teach young children was discussed. Cooney was chosen to oversee and direct the creation of what eventually became the children&#x27;s television program &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, which premiered in 1969, and the CTW, the organization that oversaw its production. Cooney was named CTW&#x27;s first executive director. As one of the first female executives in American television, her appointment was called &quot;one of the most important television developments of the decade&quot;.

Cooney remained executive director of the CTW until 1990 when she became the chair of CTW&#x27;s executive board. She served on different boards, was the trustees of many organizations, and received many awards and honorary degrees. In 2007, the Sesame Workshop founded The Joan Ganz Cooney Center, named in her honor.

==Early life and education==
Joan Ganz was born on November 30, 1929, in Phoenix, Arizona, to Sylvan Ganz, a banker, and Pauline ( Reddon), a homemaker. Her father was from Phoenix. Her father was Jewish and her mother was Catholic. Her grandfather Emil Ganz was a tailor from Walldorf, Thuringia, in Germany, who immigrated to the U.S. in 1858 and was president of the First National Bank of Arizona and mayor of Phoenix for three terms. Joan Ganz was the youngest of three siblings. She described her childhood as &quot;upper middle class, country club atmosphere&quot; and stated, &quot;I was raised in the most conventional way, raised to be a housewife and a mother, to work an interesting job when I got out of college, and to marry at the appropriate age, which would have been twenty-five&quot;.

She attended North High School in Phoenix, where she was active in school plays. She stated that her biggest influence as a teenager was her teacher Bud Brown, whose lectures about the civil rights movement, poverty, the free press, and antisemitism in Europe &quot;absolutely inflamed&quot; her and changed her life. Brown was later investigated as a Communist. She went to Dominican College, an all-girls Catholic institution in San Rafael, California, for a year before transferring to the University of Arizona in 1948, where she was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta. She stopped acting in college because her father refused to support her in that career. She chose education, even though she was not interested in becoming a teacher, on the recommendation of her mother and because as she later stated, &quot;It was something that girls of my generation did because teaching was acceptable&quot;.

==Early career==

After graduating in 1951, Ganz moved to Washington, D.C., where she worked as a clerk and typist at the State Department. She was exposed to Father James Keller&#x27;s Christopher Movement, which inspired her to become involved with television and the media. Cooney later said, &quot;Father Keller said that if idealists didn&#x27;t go into the media, nonidealists would&quot;. She returned to Phoenix and despite no experience in journalism, took a job as a reporter at the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot;. Eighteen months later, in 1953 and at the age of 23, she moved to New York City and was a publicist for the next ten years, initially for David Sarnoff at RCA, then at NBC writing press releases and soap opera synopses, and then for the &quot;United States Steel Hour&quot; at CBS. During this time, she became involved with liberal Democratic politics and &quot;fell in with a literary set of young writers and editors who gathered at the West Side apartment of &quot;Partisan Review&quot; editor William Phillips&quot;. Some of this &quot;notable group&quot; included Jason Epstein and Norman Mailer. In 1956, after many years of depression, Cooney&#x27;s father committed suicide at his home in Phoenix.

While Cooney was working for the &quot;U.S. Steel Hour&quot;, a colleague left to work for the educational television station WGBH-TV in Boston; her reaction was life-changing: &quot;What?! There is educational television?!&quot; She later stated, &quot;I knew that I was born to be in educational television; it was St. Paul on the highway&quot;. In 1961, she began to track the progress of a court case in which a New York City nonprofit group was attempting to acquire Newark, New Jersey–based independent station WNTA-TV (channel 13), which would become the precursor of PBS station WNET, the first public television station in the New York area. When channel 13 became non-commercial two years later as WNDT, Cooney applied for a position as the station&#x27;s publicist, but the general manager told her they needed producers. &quot;I can produce&quot;, she told him, even though she had no experience in producing television shows. She later stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve never been qualified for any job I&#x27;ve been hired for&quot;. According to television historian Cary O&#x27;Dell, WNDT hired her because of the ties she had made through her political activities and associations with &quot;Partisan Review&quot;. Cooney later said during an interview with the Archive of American Television that the transition to becoming a documentary producer was not difficult for her because she was well-read and aware of the issues of the day, adding, &quot;I felt like I&#x27;d died and gone to heaven, dealing with foreign policy and domestic policy and civil rights, which became the great passion in those years for me&quot;.

Taking a pay cut, Cooney and her boss Lewis Freedman produced what author Michael Davis called &quot;a series of teach-ins on major issues&quot;. One of her first programs was called &quot;Court of Reason&quot;, a weekly live debate show; notable guests included Malcolm X and Calvin Butts. She produced a debate show on America&#x27;s policy about Cuba that aired the week before the Cuban Missile Crisis. She also produced another debate show called &quot;Poverty, Anti-Poverty, and the World&quot;, in which poor people were brought into the studio to confront the government officials responsible for developing anti-poverty programs. Although the ratings were low, Cooney and Freedman won Emmys for its production, and as Davis stated, &quot;the viewers who did tune in were serious-minded adults who cared about matters of race, injustice, and the imbalance of opportunity in New York and beyond&quot;. She also produced inexpensively-made documentaries that she later called &quot;Little Grandma Moses documentaries&quot; for WNDT that were well received by their viewers, including &quot;A Chance at the Beginning&quot;, which featured the precursor of Head Start that won her a local Emmy and was later used to train Head Start teachers. She later reported that WNDT had won eight out of 13 New York Emmys in one year.

In February 1964, at age 34, she married Timothy Cooney, a staff member of New York mayor Robert Wagner, Jr. They met while she was working on &quot;A Chance at the Beginning&quot;. He was also director of public relations for the New York City Department of Labor and director of New York&#x27;s Office of Civil Defense. Timothy Cooney would eventually become &quot;an unpaid advocate for the urban poor&quot;. Cooney credited him, whom Davis called &quot;a radical feminist&quot;, for making her into a feminist, and later said that he was very supportive and encouraging. Davis called the Cooneys &quot;a delightfully unmatched set, a Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn twosome who married despite differences in upbringing, station, and sobriety&quot;.

==&quot;Sesame Street&quot; and the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop==
In the winter of 1966, Cooney hosted what she called &quot;a little dinner party&quot; at her apartment near Gramercy Park. In attendance was her husband, her boss Lewis Freedman, and Lloyd and Mary Morrisett, whom the Cooneys knew socially. Lloyd Morrisett was a mid-level executive at Carnegie Corporation (who later became its CEO), and was then responsible for funding educational research. The conversation turned to the possibilities of using television to educate young children; Morrisett raised the question, &quot;Do you think television could be used to teach young children?&quot; Cooney replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;d like to talk about it.&quot; According to Davis, the party was the start of a five-decade-long professional relationship between Cooney and Morrisett. A week later, Cooney and Freedman met with Morrisett at the offices of Carnegie Corporation to discuss doing a feasibility study on creating an educational television program for preschoolers. Freedman was opposed to Cooney&#x27;s involvement because he did not think she would be interested in a project that focused on children and because he did not want to lose her at WNDT, but she was chosen to do the study.

In the summer of 1967, Cooney took a leave of absence from WNDT and, funded by Carnegie Corporation, traveled the U.S. and Canada interviewing experts in child development, education, and television. She reported her findings in a fifty-five-page document entitled &quot;The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education&quot;. The report, which Gikow called &quot;a schematic for the show &quot;Sesame Street&quot; would become&quot;, described what the new show would look like and proposed the creation of a company that oversaw its production, which eventually became known as the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW). Cooney later stated that her undergraduate training in Education helped her research and write the study, and that it, along with her Emmy, provided her with credibility in the eyes of both the experts she interviewed and the new show&#x27;s funding sources. Davis credited Cooney&#x27;s motivation to be involved with the project with her journalism skills, learned early in her career, and her idealism, which drove her to want to, as she put it, &quot;make a difference&quot;. She later told an interviewer, &quot;I could do a thousand documentaries on poverty and poor people that would be watched by a handful of the convinced, but I was never really going to have an influence on my times&quot;. She later told Davis, &quot;Preschoolers were not necessarily my thing. It was using television in a constructive way that turned me on&quot;.

At first, Cooney assumed that the project would be produced by WNDT, but when the station&#x27;s owner rejected the proposal and questioned Cooney&#x27;s credentials, she left the station and went to the Carnegie Corporation as a full-time consultant in May 1967. For the next two years, Cooney and Morrisett worked on researching and developing the new show, raising $8 million for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and establishing the CTW. According to Davis, despite her leadership in the project&#x27;s initial research and development, Cooney&#x27;s installment as CTW&#x27;s executive director was put in doubt due to her lack of high-level managerial experience and leadership, untested financial management skills, and lack of experience in children&#x27;s television and education. Davis also speculated that sexism was involved, stating, &quot;Doubters also questioned whether a woman could gain the full confidence of a quorum of men from the federal government and two elite philanthropies, institutions whose wealth exceeded the gross national product of entire countries&quot;. At first, Cooney did not fight for the position, but with the support of her husband and Morrisett, and after the investors of the project realized that they could not move forward without her, Cooney pursued it and was named executive director of CTW in February 1968. As one of the first female executives in American television, her appointment was called &quot;one of the most important television developments of the decade&quot;.

&quot;Sesame Street&quot; premiered on PBS on November 10, 1969. In its first season, the show won three Emmys, a Peabody, and was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. According to &quot;Newsday&quot;, &quot;Scores of glowing newspaper and magazine stories fluttered down on Mrs. Cooney and her workshop like confetti onto the heads of conquering heroes&quot;. Les Brown of &quot;Variety&quot; called Cooney &quot;St. Joan&quot;. Cooney later reported, &quot;The reception was so incredible. The press adored us; the parents adored us.&quot; The first year &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was on the air, Cooney was, as Davis put it, &quot;inundated with attention&quot;. Cooney reported that the requests for interviews from the press &quot;were endless&quot;, and attributed it to the emergence of the women&#x27;s movement in the early 1970s. Cooney also testified before Congressional hearings on children and television, starting before the show&#x27;s premiere.

In 1969, the Cooneys, who were childless, became &quot;&quot;de facto&quot; foster parents to an inner-city black child&quot; whom Tim met while working in Harlem for a civil rights organization. Eventually, the child returned to live with his mother and was killed in New York City before he turned 30. The Cooneys&#x27; marriage, which Davis called &quot;turbulent&quot;, ended in 1975. Due to Tim&#x27;s long history of alcoholism, he was unable to support himself, so Cooney paid him alimony until his death in 1999. In August 1975, nine months after separating from her husband, Cooney was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a radical mastectomy. In 1980, Cooney married businessman Peter G. &quot;Pete&quot; Peterson, former U.S. Secretary of Commerce under President Richard Nixon. They met when Peterson was on the board of National Educational Television, during her presentation of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; to them. They were married for 37 years, until his death in 2018. From her marriage to Peterson, she had five stepchildren and nine grandchildren.

==Later years==
Cooney remained the chairwoman and chief executive officer of the CTW until 1990 when she stepped down and was replaced by David Britt, whom Cooney called her &quot;right-hand for many years&quot;. Britt had worked for her at the CTW since 1975 and had been its president and chief operating officer since 1988. At that time, she became chairman of the CTW&#x27;s executive board, which oversaw its businesses and licensing, and became more involved in the organization&#x27;s creative side.

Cooney served on several committees and corporate boards, including the Mayo Foundation, Chase Manhattan Bank, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Metropolitan Life Insurance. Cooney recognized that she was invited to serve on these boards because she was a woman and because companies were trying to be more inclusive. She also did some public speaking on the behalf of the CTW and returning to her roots, worked on documentaries. She credited her involvement with the boards with teaching her how to run an organization and about the business world. In 2007, Sesame Workshop founded The Joan Ganz Cooney Center, an independent, non-profit organization which studies how to improve children&#x27;s literacy by using and developing digital technologies &quot;grounded in detailed educational curriculum&quot;, just as was done during the development of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. In 2014, Public Prep launched a full day pre-kindergarten program for low-income four-year-olds living in South Bronx NYC Housing Authority projects, called the Joan Ganz Cooney Early Learning Program.

<text>The Brothers Four is an American folk singing group formed in 1957 in Seattle, Washington, and best known for their 1960 hit song &quot;Greenfields&quot;.

== History ==
Bob Flick, John Paine, Mike Kirkland, and Dick Foley met at the University of Washington, where they were members of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity in 1956 (hence the &quot;Brothers&quot; appellation). Their first professional performances were the result of a prank played on them in 1958 by a rival fraternity, who had arranged for someone to call them, pretend to be from Seattle&#x27;s Colony Club, and invite them to come down to audition for a gig. Even though they were not expected at the club, they were allowed to sing a few songs and were subsequently hired. Flick recalls them being paid &quot;mostly in beer&quot;.

They left for San Francisco in 1959, where they met Mort Lewis, Dave Brubeck&#x27;s manager. Lewis became their manager and later that year secured them a contract with Columbia Records. Their second single, &quot;Greenfields&quot;, released in January 1960, hit No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Their first album, &quot;The Brothers Four&quot;, released toward the end of the year, made the top 20. Other highlights of their early career included singing their fourth single, &quot;The Green Leaves of Summer&quot;, from the John Wayne movie &quot;The Alamo&quot;, at the 1961 Academy Awards, and having their third album, &quot;&quot;, go top 10. They also recorded the title song for the Hollywood film &quot;Five Weeks in a Balloon&quot; in 1962 and the theme song for the ABC television series &quot;Hootenanny&quot;, &quot;Hootenanny Saturday Night&quot;, in 1963. They also gave &quot;Sloop John B&quot; a try, released as &quot;The John B Sails&quot;.The British Invasion and the ascendance of edgier folk rock musicians such as Bob Dylan put an end to the Brothers Four&#x27;s early period of success, but they kept performing and making records, doing particularly well in Japan and on the American hotel circuit.

The group attempted a comeback by recording a highly commercialized version of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, but were unable to release it because of licensing issues; The Byrds eventually licensed an agreement for their own version, with their &quot;Billboard&quot; No. 1 hit released in April 1965.

The group, in a business partnership with Jerry Dennon, built a radio station in Seaside, Oregon (KSWB) in 1968. The station was subsequently sold in 1972 to a group from Montana, and later to a self-proclaimed minister, and finally merged into a larger conglomerate of radio stations.

Mike Kirkland left the group in 1969 and was replaced by Mark Pearson, another University of Washington alumnus. In 1971, Pearson left and was replaced by Bob Haworth, who stayed until 1985 and was replaced by a returning Pearson. Dick Foley left the group in 1990 and was replaced by Terry Lauber. The group is still active after years in the business.

Founding former member Kirkland died of cancer on August 20, 2020, at age 82.

<text>The U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure is a standing committee of the United States House of Representatives.

==History==
The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure was formerly known as the Committee on Public Works and Transportation from 1975 to 1994, and the Committee on Public Works between 1947 and 1974.

Under the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 the Committees on Public Buildings and Grounds (1837–1946), Rivers and Harbors (1883–1946), Roads (1913–1946), and the Flood Control (1916–1946) were combined to form the Committee on Public Works. Its jurisdiction from the beginning of the 80th Congress (1947–1948) through the 90th Congress (1967–1968) remained unchanged.

While these four original committees retained their separate identities, they were reduced to subcommittees. Additional subcommittees were formed for issues on Beach Erosion, 80th Congress (1947–1948) and for Watershed Development, 86th–90th congresses (1959–1968). Special Subcommittees included those: to Investigate Questionable Trade Practices, 80th Congress; to Study Civil Works, 82nd Congress (1951–1952); on the Federal-Aid Highway Program, 86th–90th congresses; and on Economic Development Programs, 89th–90th congresses (1965–1968). Ad Hoc Committees were established on Montana Flood Damage, 88th Congress (1963–1964); on Appalachian Regional Development, 88th–90th congresses; and on the 1967 Alaska Exposition, 89th Congress.

<text>John Webster (born 18 December 1957) is a musician, engineer and producer who primarily plays keyboards. He began his musical career as a child, trained in classical piano until his early teens, and then moved on to playing in rock bands. One of his first bands, Stonebolt, landed a top 30 U.S. hit with its first release in 1978 and went on to record four successful albums.

Webster joined the band Red Rider in 1984, performing on that year&#x27;s &quot;Breaking Curfew&quot; album and remaining with the group until they disbanded in 1990. Webster then continued to work closely in productions with its leader, Tom Cochrane, including his highly successful &quot;Mad Mad World&quot; album.

Through the 1980s and 1990s, Webster worked on many major recordings done in Vancouver&#x27;s Little Mountain Sound Studios with producers Bruce Fairbairn and Bob Rock.

Webster has appeared on many albums by established artists all over the musical spectrum. His production achievements include two Juno awards, many nominations, and numerous multi-platinum Canadian releases in both languages. He also composes music for films, including &quot;Rapid Fire&quot; (2005) and &quot;Absolute Zero&quot;. He performed live with R.S.O (Richie Sambora/Orianthi) in 2016 with dates in Europe, Asia, and South America.

Webster&#x27;s partner is songwriter/artist Annette Ducharme.

<doc id="885041" wikidata="Q221449" url="?curid=885041" title="Shagrat (band)">
<text>Shagrat was a British supergroup formed by Steve Peregrin Took and Mick Farren in February 1970 after they split with Twink, their partner in the prototype Pink Fairies supergroup of late 1969. They recruited Larry Wallis (guitar, backing vocals) and Tim Taylor (bass), both formerly of The Entire Sioux Nation. Farren left the band shortly after its establishment and never recorded or performed with them (although he gave some press interviews on the formative band&#x27;s behalf during this time). Shagrat then became Took&#x27;s band outright with Wallis, Taylor, Phil Lenoir (drums), and later Dave Bidwell (percussion).

As well as being an offshoot of the birth of the original Pink Fairies incarnation of 1970–1972, Shagrat set the template for Took&#x27;s solo/frontman career (into which the band eventually mutated). Shagrat also proved to be an ancestor of both the 1973 Pink Fairies incarnation which recorded the &quot;Kings Of Oblivion&quot; album and also the founding Motörhead incarnation which recorded &quot;On Parole&quot;, in both cases after Farren recommended Wallis, based on his guitar playing with Shagrat, respectively to the Fairies as a guitarist/singer and to Lemmy as a guitarist.

Took discussed the band retrospectively in the &quot;NME&quot; and it would much later receive coverage in &quot;Rockerilla&quot;, &quot;Record Collector&quot; and &quot;Classic Rock&quot;

==Origin of the name==
The band was named after the Orc Shagrat from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and was a contraction of &#x27;Shagrat The Vagrant&#x27;, the name under which Steve Took had been credited on Mick Farren&#x27;s album &quot;Mona – The Carnivorous Circus&quot;. In 1991, Larry Wallis gave an alternative explanation. &quot;&#x27;Steve Took&#x27; was Steve Took&#x27;s real name as far as we were concerned, so he decided to take on another persona, &#x27;Shagrat&#x27; who was the guy with the slanty eyes, pointed beard and the suede shoes.&quot;

Interviewed in 1972, Took himself offered yet another explanation: &quot;I am gutter Rock, I&#x27;m a &quot;schneide&quot;. That&#x27;s why I had Shagrat – it was a rat trip. Rats turn over at an amazing pace and they have a lot of kids. Not only do they eat the poison but they thrive on it and get bigger and they can still slip under doorways. It&#x27;s the ecology trip. Do you know how many rats were killed in New York last year? &#x27;Cos I don&#x27;t! Hah! I can&#x27;t remember my figures.&quot;

==Career==
At Strawberry Studios in Stockport, they recorded a session, produced by Wallis&#x27;s father, consisting of three tracks, &quot;Peppermint Flickstick&quot;, &quot;Boo! I Said Freeze&quot; and &quot;Steel Abortion&quot;. Having been previously scheduled to appear at the May 1970 Hollywood Music Festival in Newcastle-under-Lyme, the band finally undertook their first gig, at the Phun City Festival near Worthing, Sussex on 24–26 July 1970. The band (minus Taylor, with Took playing bass) played a 30–45 minute set, including all three songs from the Strawberry Studios session plus a cover of &quot;7 and 7 Is&quot; by Love. The gig had certainly got the band off to a good start, but problems set in immediately afterwards. Phil Lenoir left (Took claimed that they never saw him again after the festival), leaving Shagrat in search of a new rhythm section.

A new drummer was recruited, Chicken Shack&#x27;s Dave Bidwell, while Took continued with bass guitar. They continued to rehearse together sometimes alongside prospective bassists, in preparation for a 13 December 1970 live date at the Roundhouse Christmas Spaced Party event which had been booked and they received approaches from several record labels. Shagrat&#x27;s eventual demise resulted from Took being the band&#x27;s only full-time member. Bidwell was one of three Chicken Shack members who, during 1970, transferred to Savoy Brown. Wallis meanwhile joined Blodwyn Pig and later UFO.

With the Roundhouse gig booking looming, and Took not wishing to cancel, his only option was to play the gig by himself, which he did. Wallis and Bidwell in early 1971 assisted Took in the recording of a set of four acoustic demos, – &quot;Amanda&quot;, &quot;Strange Sister&quot;, &quot;Still Yawning Stillborn&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Deceiver&quot;. The trio also rehearsed for possible live performances as an acoustic band, which Wallis recalled involved Bidwell &quot;pounding (the) fuck out of a telephone book.&quot;

==Legacy and retrospect==
Following a positive reaction to Took&#x27;s solo performance in lieu of a Shagrat band set at the Roundhouse, he continued with the solo format. Took made some headway as a live act, frequently supporting the Pink Fairies and Hawkwind, attracting some coverage in the UK music press and even performing a live radio session on Steve Bradshaw&#x27;s &quot;Breakthrough&quot; programme on BBC Radio London. Took continued to make use of the Shagrat bandname by occasionally billing himself as &#x27;Steve Shagrat Took&#x27; – notably on advertisements for his support slot for Hawkwind at Chatham Central Hall on 18 November 1971.

Wallis&#x27; guitar work for Shagrat earned him Farren&#x27;s recommendation in 1972 as the new guitarist/frontman for the Pink Fairies. Following Paul Rudolph&#x27;s departure from the band, remaining members Duncan Sanderson and Russell Hunter had been working with Took on a rerecording of acoustic Shagrat song &quot;Amanda&quot; as a possible single. Longtime Took friend Mick Wayne happened to be in the studios at the time and was roped into the session on guitar. Afterwards, Wayne, Sanderson and Hunter formed a new Pink Fairies lineup which recorded the single &quot;Well Well Well.&quot; Unhappy at Wayne&#x27;s songwriting and playing style however, the other two Fairies approached Farren to nominate a successor. Farren&#x27;s choice was Wallis and he repeated this choice two and a half years later when asked by Lemmy to suggest a guitarist for the founding lineup of Motörhead. The two band incarnations featuring Wallis recorded the &quot;Kings Of Oblivion&quot; and &quot;On Parole&quot; albums respectively. This was to be the start of a long personal and professional relationship between Wallis and Farren, which encompassed Wallis&#x27; production work and co-songwriting on Farren&#x27;s second solo album &quot;Vampires Stole My Lunch Money&quot;. The partnership was renewed in late 2001 when Wallis provided musical backing at Farren&#x27;s reading of his memoir &quot;Give The Anarchist A Cigarrette&quot; at London pub Filthy McNasty&#x27;s.

Looking back on Shagrat in 1972, Took opined that the band had suffered from being ahead of its time. Interviewed by Charles Shaar Murray in 1972 for the &quot;NME&quot;, Took commented that record companies &quot;didn&#x27;t want to buy Steel Abortion or Peppermint Flickstick. A bit naughty, the words, but then I&#x27;d taken in all this American culture and American society in general, and got chemicalised out of it, a general trip, and put it all into words. Now there&#x27;s Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot; and &quot;Killer&quot;, Hawkwind and the general thing is there now, and it wasn&#x27;t there then because they couldn&#x27;t accept that it was gonna sell. I was saying to &#x27;em. &quot;Look, man, look at the Yanks, because we&#x27;re about three years behind them as far as youth culture is concerned. This is what&#x27;s gonna sell.&quot; and they&#x27;d say, &#x27;Oh yes, lads sure, do they really want to hear this sort of thing?&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;Classic Rock&quot;&#x27;s Michael Heatley awarded Captain Trip Records&#x27; 2001 &quot;Lone Star&quot; album release of Shagrat&#x27;s studio sessions three stars out of five in the November 2001 edition, commenting &quot;They sound rather like Marc Bolan fronting Hawkwind. Plenty of personality that shines through despite the somewhat suspect sound quality.&quot;

&quot;Record Collector&quot; in April 2024 included &quot;Lone Star&quot; in a listing of &quot;Stars of Beards - 10 UK underground classics&quot; as a sidebar from a &quot;Freak Scene&quot; cover feature on the 1960s/1970s UK underground scene.

<text>Randolph Silliman Bourne (; May 30, 1886 – December 22, 1918) was a progressive writer and intellectual born in Bloomfield, New Jersey, and a graduate of Columbia University. He is considered to be a spokesman for the young radicals living during World War I. His articles appeared in journals including &quot;The Seven Arts&quot; and &quot;The New Republic&quot;. Bourne is best known for his essays, especially his unfinished work &quot;The State,&quot; discovered after he died. From this essay, which was published posthumously and included in &quot;Untimely Papers&quot;, comes the phrase &quot;war is the health of the state&quot; that laments the success of governments in arrogating authority and resources during conflicts.

==Life and works==

Bourne&#x27;s face was deformed at birth by misused forceps and the umbilical cord was coiled round his left ear, leaving it permanently damaged and misshapen. At age four, he suffered tuberculosis of the spine, resulting in stunted growth and a hunched back. He chronicled his experiences in his essay titled, &quot;The Handicapped - by one of them&quot;, considered a foundational work in disability studies. At age 23, he won a scholarship to study at Columbia University, from which he graduated in 1912 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Master&#x27;s degree in 1913. He was a journalist and editor of the Columbia Monthly, and he was also a contributor to the weekly &quot;The New Republic&quot; since it was first launched in 1914, but after America entered the war, the magazine found his pacifist views incompatible. From 1913 to 1914, he studied in Europe on a Columbia Fellowship.

World War I divided American progressives and pitted an anti-war faction—including Bourne and Jane Addams—against a pro-war faction led by pragmatist philosopher and educational theorist John Dewey. Bourne was a student of Dewey&#x27;s at Columbia, but he rejected Dewey&#x27;s idea of using the war to spread democracy. (He was a member of the Boar&#x27;s Head Society.) In his pointedly titled 1917 essay &quot;Twilight of Idols&quot;, he invoked the progressive pragmatism of Dewey&#x27;s contemporary William James to argue that America was using democracy as an end to justify the war, but that democracy itself was never examined. Although initially following Dewey, he felt that Dewey had betrayed his democratic ideals by focusing only on the facade of a democratic government rather than on the ideas behind democracy that Dewey had once professed to respect.

Bourne was greatly influenced by Horace Kallen&#x27;s 1915 essay, &quot;Democracy Versus the Melting-Pot&quot;. Like Kallen, Bourne argued that Americanism ought not to be associated with Anglo-Saxonism. In his 1916 article &quot;Trans-National America,&quot; Bourne argued that the United States should accommodate immigrant cultures into a &quot;cosmopolitan America,&quot; instead of forcing immigrants to assimilate to the dominant Anglo-Saxon-based culture.

Bourne was an enthusiast for Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s belief in the necessity of a general will. Bourne once exclaimed,

Bourne died in the Spanish flu pandemic after the war, in 1918. John Dos Passos, an influential American modernist writer, eulogized Bourne in the chapter &quot;Randolph Bourne&quot; of his novel &quot;1919&quot; and drew heavily on the &quot;war is the health of the state&quot; notion in the novel.

== &quot;Trans-National America&quot; ==
In this article, Bourne rejects the melting-pot theory and does not see immigrants assimilating easily to another culture. Bourne&#x27;s view of nationality was related to the connection between a person and their &quot;spiritual country&quot;, that is, their culture. He argued that people would most often hold tightly to the literature and culture of their native country even if they lived in another. He also believed this was true for the many immigrants to the United States. Therefore, Bourne could not see immigrants from all different parts of the world assimilating to the Anglo-Saxon traditions, which were viewed as American traditions.

This article goes on to say that America offers a unique liberty of opportunity and can still offer traditional isolation, which he felt could lead to a cosmopolitan enterprise. He felt that with this great mix of cultures and people, America would be able to grow into a trans-national nation, which would have interconnecting cultural fibers with other countries. Bourne felt America would grow more as a country by broadening people&#x27;s views to include immigrants&#x27; ways instead of conforming everyone to the melting-pot ideal. This broadening of people&#x27;s views would eventually lead to a nation where all who live in it are united, which would inevitably pull the country towards greatness. This article and most of the ideas in it were influenced by World War I, during which the article was written.

<doc id="885054" wikidata="Q1342583" url="?curid=885054" title="Hessdalen lights">
<text>The Hessdalen lights are unidentified lights which have been observed in a stretch of the Hessdalen valley in rural central Norway periodically since at least the 1930s.

== Background ==
The Hessdalen lights appear both by day and by night, and seem to float through and above the valley. They are usually bright white, yellow or red and can appear above and below the horizon. The duration of the phenomenon may be a few seconds to well over an hour. Sometimes the lights move with enormous speed; at other times they seem to sway slowly back and forth. On yet other occasions, they hover in mid‑air.

Unusual lights have been reported in the region since at least the 1930s. Especially high activity occurred between December 1981 and mid-1984, during which the lights were observed 15–20 times per week, attracting many overnight tourists. , the number of observations had dwindled, with only 10 to 20 sightings yearly.

Since 1983, &quot;Project Hessdalen&quot; initiated by UFO-Norge and UFO-Sverige have attempted to investigate the lights. This project was active as field investigations during 1983–1985. A group of students, engineers, and journalists collaborated as &quot;The Triangle Project&quot; in 1997–1998 and recorded the lights in a pyramid shape that bounced up and down. In 1998, the Hessdalen Automatic Measurement Station (Hessdalen ) was set up in the valley to register and record the appearance of lights.

Later, a programme named EMBLA was initiated to bring together established scientists and students to researching the lights. Leading research institutions are Østfold University College (Norway) and the Italian National Research Council.

== Hypotheses ==
Despite ongoing research, there is no consensus for an explanation of the phenomenon. A number of potentially plausible theories have been put forward.

There have been some sightings positively identified as misperceptions of astronomical bodies, aircraft, car headlights and mirages.

One explanation attributes the phenomenon to an incompletely understood combustion of airborne dust from mining in the area. The analysis identified hydrogen, oxygen and other elements including titanium. It was thought this occurs in Hessdalen because of the large deposits of scandium there. The publication of this research led to the Norwegian press proclaiming that &quot;The Mystery in Hessdalen is Solved&quot;.

One hypothesis put forward in 2010 suggests that the lights are formed by a cluster of macroscopic Coulomb crystals in a plasma produced by the ionization of air and dust by alpha particles during radon decay in the dusty atmosphere. Several physical properties including oscillation, geometric structure, and light spectrum, observed in the Hessdalen lights might be explained through a dust plasma model. Radon decay produces alpha particles (responsible by helium emissions in spectrum) and radioactive elements such as polonium. In 2004, physicist Massimo Teodorani showed an occurrence where a higher level of radioactivity on rocks was detected near the area where a large light ball was reported. Computer simulations show that dust immersed in ionized gas can organize itself into double helixes like some occurrences of the Hessdalen lights; dusty plasmas may also form in this structure.

Another hypothesis explains Hessdalen lights as a product of piezoelectricity generated under specific rock strains, because many crystal rocks in Hessdalen valley include quartz grains which produce an intense charge density.

=== Piezoelectricity ===

In a 2011 paper, based on the dusty plasma theory of Hessdalen lights, Gerson Paiva and Carlton Taft suggested that piezoelectricity of quartz cannot explain a peculiar property assumed by the Hessdalen lights phenomenonthe presence of geometrical structures in its center. Paiva and Taft have shown a mechanism of light ball cluster formation in Hessdalen lights by nonlinear interaction of ion-acoustic and dusty-acoustic waves with low frequency geoelectromagnetic waves in dusty plasmas. The theoretical velocity of ejected light balls is about , in good agreement with the observed velocity of some ejected light balls, estimated at .

The central ball is white, while the ejected balls that are observed are always green in colour. This is ascribed to radiation pressure produced by the interaction between very low frequency electromagnetic waves (VLF) and atmospheric ions (present in the central white-coloured ball) through ion-acoustic waves. O ions (electronic transition ), with green emission lines, are probably the only ones transported by these waves. Electronic bands of O ions occur in auroral spectra.

The estimated temperature of Hessdalen lights is about . At this temperature, the rate coefficients of dissociative recombination will be for the oxygen ions, and for the nitrogen ions. Thus, in the Hessdalen lights plasma, the nitrogen ions will decompose more rapidly than oxygen ions. Only ionic species are transported by ion acoustic waves. Therefore, oxygen ions will dominate in the ejected green light balls in Hessdalen lights, presenting a negative band of O with electronic transition after ion-acoustic wave formation.

Paiva and Taft presented a model for resolving the apparently contradictory spectrum observed in Hessdalen lights. The spectrum is nearly flat on the top with steep sides, due to the effect of optical thickness on the bremsstrahlung spectrum. At low frequencies self-absorption modifies the spectrum to follow the Rayleigh–Jeans part of the blackbody curve. Such a spectrum is typical of dense ionized gas. Additionally, the spectrum produced in the thermal bremsstrahlung process is flat up to a cutoff frequency, νcut, and falls off exponentially at higher frequencies. This sequence of events forms the typical spectrum of Hessdalen lights phenomenon when the atmosphere is clear, with no fog. 
According to the model, the spatial color distribution of luminous balls commonly observed in Hessdalen lights phenomenon is produced by electrons accelerated by electric fields during rapid fracture of piezoelectric rocks under the ground. In 2014, Jader Monari published a new Hessdalen Lights model involving a geological-like battery. Thus, two sides of the valley are the electrodes and the river Hesja can be acting as the electrolyte. Gas bubbles rise into the air and can become electrically charged producing gas luminesce and Hessdalen Lights phenomenon.

<text>Hamish MacCunn, &quot;né&quot; James MacCunn (22 March 18682 August 1916) was a Scottish composer, conductor and teacher.

He was one of the first students of the newly founded Royal College of Music in London, and quickly made a mark. As a composer he achieved early success with his orchestral piece &quot;The Land of the Mountain and the Flood&quot; (1887), and, later, his first opera, &quot;Jeanie Deans&quot; (1894). His subsequent compositions did not match those two successes, and although he continued to compose throughout his life, he became best known as a conductor and teacher. He held teaching appointments at the Royal Academy of Music and the Guildhall School of Music.

As a conductor MacCunn served as musical director to the Carl Rosa, Moody-Manners and D&#x27;Oyly Carte opera companies, and worked with Thomas Beecham in the latter&#x27;s London opera seasons in 1910 and 1915 and on tour.

==Life and career==
===Early years===

James MacCunn was born in Greenock, Scotland, the second son of James MacCunn and his wife Barbara, &quot;née&quot; Neill. It was a musical household: MacCunn senior, a prosperous shipowner by profession, was an amateur cellist; his wife, a former pupil of Sterndale Bennett, sang and played the piano. The parents encouraged the musical development of their second son, who, alongside his general education at the Greenock Academy and elsewhere, received private lessons from local teachers in violin, piano, organ, harmony and composition. When he was eight the family spent a full season in London, where the boy was allowed to attend all August Manns&#x27;s many concerts at the Crystal Palace. In 1883, at the age of fifteen, he won a scholarship to the newly established Royal College of Music (RCM) in London.

At the RCM MacCunn studied piano with Franklin Taylor, viola with Alfred Gibson and composition with Hubert Parry and Charles Villiers Stanford. While a student he had substantial compositions premiered: the cantata &quot;The Moss Rose&quot;, performed at the RCM in 1884, and the overture &quot;Cior Mhor&quot;, which was given by Manns in a concert at the Crystal Palace in October 1885. In 1885 MacCunn adopted the first name Hamish, a Gaelic version of the name James.

MacCunn resigned the scholarship in 1886 in what the music critic John Purser describes as &quot;a fit of pique&quot; because he felt he was not receiving the social status due to him. He left the RCM without taking a degree. Shortly afterwards he had a success with his concert overture &quot;The Land of the Mountain and the Flood&quot;, premiered at the Crystal Palace in 1887. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; commented, &quot;The work – which is spirited and bold in conception and brilliantly scored – was finely played and enthusiastically received&quot;. Bernard Shaw, in his capacity as a music critic, called it &quot;a charming Scotch overture that carries you over the hills and far away&quot;.

Some of the composer&#x27;s songs and other works were premiered at the house of the painter John Pettie, whose daughter Alison married MacCunn in June 1889. They had one child, Fergus, who became a soldier. Pettie portrayed MacCunn in his popular painting &quot;Two Strings to her Bow&quot; (1887). From 1888 to 1894 MacCunn was professor of harmony at the RCM&#x27;s older rival the Royal Academy of Music and also took private pupils.

===Opera and conducting===
In 1889 the opera manager Carl Rosa commissioned MacCunn to write a work for the Carl Rosa Opera Company, and in 1891 MacCunn contracted to write an opera for Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte&#x27;s new Royal English Opera House. The work for Carte was to be based on H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s 1888 novel &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, but the opera was never finished, and MacCunn&#x27;s failure to provide a work to continue Carte&#x27;s seasons (together with similar failures by two other British composers) led to the closure of the opera house and the abandonment of Carte&#x27;s English opera enterprise.

The commission for Rosa was eventually completed, although not produced until after the impresario&#x27;s death. This opera was &quot;Jeanie Deans&quot;, based on Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Heart of Midlothian&quot; and first produced in 1894 in Edinburgh, conducted by the composer. It was a considerable success, despite what &quot;The Times&quot; called &quot;the dubious advantage&quot; of a libretto by Joseph Bennett. In 1896 &quot;Jeanie Deans&quot; received a London performance, and MacCunn composed another opera, &quot;Diarmid and Ghrine&quot;. The following year Manns performed MacCunn&#x27;s new orchestral suite, &quot;Highland Memories&quot;, and the Carl Rosa company presented &quot;Diarmid and Ghrine&quot; at the Royal Opera House.

From the premiere of &quot;Jeanie Deans&quot; onward, MacCunn became associated with British opera companies as a conductor. For two seasons from 1898 he was musical director of the Carl Rosa company, conducting, among much else, the first English-language productions of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and &quot;Siegfried&quot;. In 1900 he signed a two-year contract as conductor of the Moody-Manners company, conducting a wide repertoire of operas, including &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, &quot;Carmen&quot;, &quot;La Juive&quot;, &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;, &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot; and &quot;Martha&quot;. In 1902 he was appointed musical director of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy Theatre, for the first production of Edward German&#x27;s &quot;Merrie England&quot;, and the following year German&#x27;s &quot;A Princess of Kensington&quot;. When the Savoy company dispersed thereafter, MacCunn, in the words of &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;had to accept work in various &#x27;musical comedy&#x27; productions, which did not contribute to his artistic advancement&quot;.

In 1910 MacCunn conducted &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; in Thomas Beecham&#x27;s opera season at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, and took over from Beecham in conducting &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; on tour. In 1915 he conducted &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; and &quot;Faust&quot; in Beecham&#x27;s season at the Shaftesbury Theatre.

From 1912 onwards MacCunn took opera classes at the Guildhall School of Music and continued to teach privately. Conducting and teaching took up much of his time, and he composed less in his later years. His works written after 1900 include &quot;The Masque of War and Peace&quot; (1900) produced at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, another opera – &quot;The Golden Girl&quot; – and a piece for chorus and orchestra, &quot;The Wreck of the Hesperus&quot; (both 1905). In 1908 his &quot;Pageant of Darkness and Light&quot; was performed in London.

MacCunn became ill with throat cancer in 1916 and died at his home in St John&#x27;s Wood, London on 2 August 1916, aged forty-eight, survived by his widow and son. His son was Captain Fergus MacCunn.

<text>The Min Min light is a light phenomenon that has often been reported in outback Australia.

== History ==
Stories about the lights can be found in several Aboriginal Australian cultures predating the European colonisation of Australia, and have since become part of wider Australian folklore. Some Indigenous Australians hold that the number of sightings has increased in conjunction with the ingression of Europeans into the outback. While it has been claimed that the first recorded sighting dates to 1838, in the book &quot;Six Months in South Australia&quot;, it is possible that the event described is a different phenomenon. 

The origin of the name &quot;Min Min&quot; is uncertain. It could be connected to an Australian Aboriginal language from the Cloncurry area, or it could be connected to the Min Min Hotel, located in a small settlement of the same name, where the light was observed by a stockman in 1918. Neither connection has been substantiated. Non-Indigenous folklore and tales of the Min Min lights tend to characterize them as a mysterious phenomenon and fit into understandings of the land which are characterised by the Australian Gothic; Min Min lights are often portrayed as benign, yet frightening and unknowable to those who experience them.

==Distribution==

Reports of the phenomenon are widespread throughout Australia from as far south as Brewarrina in western New South Wales, to as far north as Boulia in northern Queensland. The majority of sightings are reported to have occurred in Channel Country. Another district where Min Min lights are often reported is Yunta, South Australia, which is centred within a low-lying basin known for recording extreme heat. The Ngarluma people report Min Min lights in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, particularly in an area known as Pyramid Station.

==Appearance and behaviour==
Accounts of the light appearances vary, though they are most commonly described as being fuzzy, disc-shaped lights that appear to hover just above the horizon. They are often described as being white, though some accounts describe them as changing colour from white to red to green and back again. Some accounts describe them as being dim; others describe them as being bright enough to illuminate the ground under them and to cause nearby objects to throw clearly defined shadows. According to folklore, the lights sometimes follow or approach people and disappear when fired upon, sometimes very rapidly, only to reappear later on, and anyone who chases the lights and catches them will never return to tell the tale. Some witnesses describe the light as appearing to approach them several times before retreating. Others report that the lights were able to keep pace with them when they were in a moving motor vehicle.

==Hypotheses==
It is unknown whether the Min Min lights are a real phenomenon, and if so, what their source might be. Various hypotheses have been put forward to explain the lights, including:

===Bioluminescence===
Scientist Jack Pettigrew has hypothesized that the lights may be the result of insects swarming that have taken on bioluminescent characteristics after being contaminated by naturally occurring agents found in local fungi, or of species of owl with their own naturally occurring source of bioluminescence. To date, no one has captured or observed an animal with these characteristics. There is also no known bioluminescent source bright enough.

===Geophysical lights===
A second hypothesis by Pettigrew is that the lights are the result of known geophysical phenomena, such as piezoelectrics or marsh gas. However, the lights are often reported in areas without geological conditions conducive to these phenomena.

===Refraction===
Pettigrew also suggests that the Min Min lights could be a form of Fata Morgana mirage. A Fata Morgana is a specific form of mirage caused by a stark temperature difference between air layers, which causes remote lights or objects actually beyond the horizon to appear visible above the horizon, often with considerable distortion. This explanation would also explain how reports of the sightings have changed over the years: The first reports and Aboriginal legends were of stationary lights, which would have been refractions over the horizon of campfires. Later reports are of lights that actively move. With a Fata Morgana mirage, this would be a refraction of car headlights over the horizon being reflected and being seen to move. The area of the Min Min lights are in a desert with known temperature inversions in the atmosphere.

==In popular culture==
The Min Min lights appear in the first episode of the second season of the Australian web television series &quot;Wolf Creek&quot;.

The Min Min lights also appear in Episode 16 of Season 3 of the Australian television series &quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot;.

In 2020, Australian band &quot;Custard&quot; released a single titled &quot;The Min Min Lights&quot;
