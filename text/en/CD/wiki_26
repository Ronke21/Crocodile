<text>The Eagle Squadrons were three fighter squadrons of the Royal Air Force (RAF) formed with volunteer pilots from the United States during the early days of World War II (1940), prior to the United States&#x27; entry into the war in December 1941.

With the United States still neutral, many Americans simply crossed the border and joined the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) to learn to fly and fight. Many early recruits had originally gone to Europe to fight for Finland against the Soviet Union in the Winter War.

Charles Sweeny, a wealthy businessman living in London, persuaded the British Government to form an RAF squadron composed of Americans. (His uncle, also named Charles Sweeny, had been working along similar lines, recruiting American pilots to fight in France.) Sweeny&#x27;s efforts were also coordinated in Canada by the World War I air ace Billy Bishop and the artist Clayton Knight, who formed the Clayton Knight Committee, which by the time the United States entered the war, had processed and approved 6,700 applications from Americans to join the RCAF or RAF. Sweeny and his rich society contacts bore the cost (over $100,000) of processing and sending the men to the United Kingdom for training.

==Training==
The basic requirements for joining the Eagle Squadron were a high school diploma, age 20 to 31 years, visual acuity of 20/40 correctable to 20/20, and 300 hours of certified flying time. These requirements, with the exception of the flight time, were not as strict as those required for service in the United States Army Air Corps, which was why some of the pilots joined the squadron. Most Eagle Squadron pilots did not have a college education or prior military experience.

Once in Britain and having passed basic flight training, the new pilots were sent for advanced operational training to an operational training unit (OTU) for two to four weeks to learn to fly Miles Master trainers, Hawker Hurricanes, and Supermarine Spitfires before being ostensibly commissioned as RAF officers and posted to front-line RAF fighter squadrons. The American pilots assigned to the Eagle Squadrons never renounced their US citizenship and although they wore the uniforms and held the rank titles of RAF officers, their dress and duty uniform tunics were modified with the Eagle Squadron patch, a white bald eagle flanked by the letters &quot;ES&quot; for Eagle Squadron.

== Formation and evolution ==
Three Eagle Squadrons were formed between September 1940 and July 1941. On 29 September 1942, they were turned over to the Eighth Air Force of the U.S. Army Air Forces and became the 4th Fighter Group. Of the thousands who volunteered, only 244 Americans served with the Eagle Squadrons. Sixteen Britons also served as squadron and flight commanders.

The first Eagle Squadron, No. 71 Squadron, was formed in September 1940 as part of the RAF&#x27;s buildup during the Battle of Britain, and became operational for defensive duties on 5 February 1941. 71 Squadron commenced operations based at RAF Church Fenton in early 1941, before a move to RAF Kirton-in-Lindsey. In April, the squadron transferred to RAF Martlesham Heath in Suffolk for operations over Europe. During May, it suffered its first loss when Mike Kolendorski was killed during a fighter sweep over the Netherlands. The intensity of operations stepped up with a move into No 11 Group of Fighter Command, being based at RAF North Weald by June 1941. On June 21, 1941, 22 year-old Nathaniel Maranz became the first American pilot to become a prisoner of war when he was shot down by a Bf 109 over the English Channel and picked up by a German patrol boat after swimming for an hour and a half. He was a prisoner in Stalag Luft III. The squadron&#x27;s first confirmed victory came on 21 July 1941 when P/O William R. Dunn destroyed a Messerschmitt Bf 109F over Lille. In August, 71 Squadron replaced its Hurricanes and Spitfire Mk IIs, before quickly re-equipping with the latest Spitfire Mk Vs. The unit soon established a high reputation, and numerous air kill claims were made in RAF fighter sweeps over the continent during the summer and autumn of 1941. In December, the squadron was rested back at Martlesham Heath, before a move to Debden in May 1942.

The second Eagle Squadron, No. 121 Squadron, was formed at RAF Kirton-in-Lindsey in May 1941, flying Hurricanes on coastal convoy escort duties. On 15 September 1941, it destroyed its first German aircraft. The Hurricanes were replaced with Spitfires, and Spitfire Mk Vs arrived in November 1941. The following month, the squadron moved to RAF North Weald, replacing 71 Squadron. In 1942, its offensive activities over the English Channel included bomber escorts and fighter sweeps.

The third and final Eagle Squadron, No. 133 Squadron, was formed at RAF Coltishall in July 1941, flying the Hurricane Mk IIb. A move to RAF Duxford followed in August, and re-equipment with the Spitfire Mk V occurred early in 1942. In May, the squadron became part of the famed RAF Biggin Hill Wing. On 31 July 1942, during a bomber escort mission to Abbeville, 133&#x27;s Spitfires fought 52-kill Luftwaffe &#x27;ace&#x27; Oblt. Rudolf Pflanz of 11./JG 2 in combat; after shooting down one, Pflanz was himself shot down and killed in his Messerschmitt Bf 109G-1 over Berck-sur-Mer, France. 133 Squadron claimed three destroyed and one probable, while losing three aircraft. P/O &quot;Jessie&quot; Taylor accounted for two of the claims (a Bf 109F and an Focke-Wulf Fw 190) and P/O W. Baker was credited with a Fw 190 destroyed. On 26 September 1942, 11 of the unit&#x27;s 12 brand new Spitfire Mk IXs were lost on a mission over Morlaix while escorting USAAF Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses in heavy cloud cover. Strong winds blew the unit further south than realised and, short of fuel, the squadron let down directly over Brest. Six pilots were shot down and taken prisoner, four were killed, one bailed out and evaded capture, while one crash landed in England. One of the British pilots taken prisoner, Flight Lieutenant Gordon Brettell, was later to be shot as one of the escapees in The Great Escape from Stalag Luft III in 1944.

The Dieppe Raid was the only time all three Eagle Squadrons saw action operating together. No. 71 moved from Debden to Gravesend in mid-August in anticipation of the Dieppe action, while No. 121 operated from Southend. 133 Squadron moved with No. 401 Squadron RCAF from RAF Biggin Hill to Lympne on the English south coast. 71 Squadron claimed a Ju 88 shot down, 121 an Fw 190, while 133 claimed four Fw 190s, a Ju 88 and a Dornier Do 217. Six &#x27;Eagle&#x27; Spitfires were lost, with one pilot taken prisoner and one killed. Through to the end of September 1942, the squadrons claimed to have destroyed 73½ German planes while 77 American and 5 British members were killed. 71 Squadron claimed 41 kills, 121 Squadron 18, and 133 Squadron 14½.

When informed of the attack on Pearl Harbor, most of the Eagle Squadron pilots wanted to immediately join the fight against Imperial Japan. Representatives from 71 and 121 Squadrons went to the American embassy in London and offered their services to the United States. The pilots from 71 Squadron decided they wanted to go to Singapore to fight the Japanese and a proposal was put to RAF Fighter Command, but it was turned down.

On 29 September 1942, the three squadrons were officially transferred from the RAF to the Eighth Air Force of the United States Army Air Forces, with the American pilots becoming officers in the USAAF. The Eagle pilots had earned 12 Distinguished Flying Crosses and one Distinguished Service Order. Only four of the 34 original Eagle pilots were still present when the squadrons joined the USAAF. Typical were the fates of the eight original pilots in the third squadron: Four died during training, one was disqualified, two died in combat, and one became a prisoner of war. About 100 Eagle pilots had been killed, were missing or were prisoners.

Negotiations regarding the transfer between the Eagle Squadrons, the USAAF and the RAF had to resolve a number of issues. The RAF wanted some compensation for losing three front-line squadrons in which they had heavily invested. Determining what rank each pilot would assume in the USAAF also had to be negotiated, with most being given a rank equivalent to their RAF rank. For example, a flight lieutenant became a USAAF captain, while a wing commander became a lieutenant colonel. None of the Eagle Squadron pilots had previously served in the USAAF and did not have US pilot wings. As such, it was decided that they be awarded USAAF pilot wings upon their transfer. Due to their insistence, the Eagle Squadron pilots who transferred to the USAAF 4th Fighter Group were permitted to retain their RAF wings, reduced in size, on the opposite side of their uniform to their new USAAF pilots wings.

Major General Carl Spaatz, head of the USAAF in Europe, wanted to spread the experience of the Eagles amongst various new US fighter squadrons, but the pilots of the three Eagle Squadrons wanted to stay together. The 71, 121, and 133 Squadrons were renamed by the USAAF as the 334th, 335th and 336th and transferred as complete units, retaining their Spitfires until P-47 Thunderbolts became available in January 1943. The 4th Fighter Group flew Spitfires until its conversion to P-47s was completed in April 1943. All three units had switched to the P-51 Mustang by the second half of March 1944. The 4th Fighter Wing, along with the 334th, 335th and 336th Fighter Squadrons, exist today as F-15E Strike Eagle units at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in Goldsboro, North Carolina and are part of the Fifteenth Air Force.

==Individual pilots==

The first three members of the Eagle Squadrons were:

* Vernon Charles &quot;Shorty&quot; Keough, service number 81620
* Andrew B. Mamedoff, service number 81621
* Eugene Quimby &quot;Red&quot; Tobin, service number 81622

All three had served together in No. 609 Squadron RAF, at RAF Middle Wallop. They had joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR) together (receiving consecutive service numbers), were posted to No. 609 Squadron RAF together, fought in the Battle of Britain together, and were transferred to 71 Squadron together in September 1940. The trio had also all been killed by the time of the transfer of the Eagle Squadrons to the USAAF in 1942 (from the database of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC):

* Pilot Officer Keough was killed in February 1941, age 29
* Flight Lieutenant Mamedoff was killed in October 1941, age 29, after he had been transferred, with a promotion to be a flight commander, to another Eagle Squadron, No. 133 Squadron
* Flying Officer Tobin was killed in September 1941, age 24

Phillip Leckrone, service number 84653, was another Battle of Britain veteran. He was also killed before the USAAF took charge of the Eagle Squadrons. Pilot Officer Leckrone was killed in January 1941, age 28.

The lives of these four pilots have been described in &quot;The Few&quot; by Alex Kershaw.

It is reported that Pilot Officer Art Donahue DFC stayed with the Eagle Squadron only a short time before requesting a transfer back to his original RAF unit. He did not appreciate the unruly behavior of many of the American pilots. He was killed in action in 1942.

Captain Don Gentile was a pilot with 133 Squadron, claiming two air victories, and by March 1944 had become the 4th Fighter Group&#x27;s top ace in World War II, with 22 aerial kills.

Colonel Chesley &quot;Pete&quot; Peterson had 130 sorties with the Eagle Squadrons and became the youngest squadron commander in the RAF. When the Eagle Squadrons were transferred to the 4th Fighter Group, Peterson became the group&#x27;s executive officer, succeeding to command of the group in April 1943, and becoming at 23 the youngest (at the time) colonel in the USAAF.

Colonel Donald Blakeslee was a pilot in 121 and 133 Squadrons during 1942, making 120 sorties and claiming three aerial kills. He became deputy commander of the 4th Fighter Group under Chesley Peterson, then commanded the group from January to October 1944.

==Honours==
The Eagle Squadrons Memorial is located on Grosvenor Square opposite a statue of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

British composer Kenneth J. Alford wrote a march, &quot;Eagle Squadron&quot;, in honour of the pilots of the squadron. It is also a &quot;thank you&quot; to the American pilots: small sections of the &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; can be heard in the low brass during the trio.

<text>Expedition 7 was the seventh expedition to the International Space Station.

==Crew==

===Planned crew before &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster===
==Mission parameters==
*Perigee: 384 km
*Apogee: 396 km
*Inclination: 51.6°
*Period: 92 min

==Mission objectives==
The seventh crew of the International Space Station lifted off in Soyuz TMA-2 from the Russian Space Agency&#x27;s Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 April 2003, at 05:56:20 UTC. The Soyuz docked on 28 April 2003 and took over command of the ISS. The &quot;Space Shuttle&quot; fleet had been grounded due to the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, so the crew size was reduced to two, as opposed to the three that could be carried by the shuttle. The Expedition Seven crew—along with European Space Agency Astronaut Pedro Duque—landed back on Earth on 27 October 2003 at Kazakhstan at 02:41:20 UTC, after undocking from the International Space Station in their Soyuz spacecraft at 23:17 UTC.

Due to the reduced crew size, the scientific work had to be scaled down as well. Only 15 different experiments were conducted during the mission. Malenchenko and Lu were also tasked with periodic maintenance work on the station, as well as spacewalk training (although no spacewalks were planned). Supplies were delivered by &quot;Progress M1-10&quot; in June and &quot;Progress M-48&quot; in August.

From Houston, ISS Spacecraft Communicator Mike Fossum informed Expedition 7 Commander Yuri Malenchenko and Science Officer Edward Lu on 15 October 2003 of the successful launch of the Long March rocket carrying the Shenzhou 5 spacecraft and Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei. &quot;It&#x27;s really some exciting news to share. The world&#x27;s spacefaring nations have been joined by a new member tonight: China.&quot;

&quot;First off, we want to congratulate them,&quot; Lu replied. &quot;The more people that go into space, the better off we all are. This is a great achievement and good for everyone in the long run.&quot; In Chinese, he later added, &quot;Welcome to space. Have a safe journey.&quot;

&quot;I would also like to say I love to have somebody else in space instead of me and Ed,&quot; said Malenchenko. &quot;I also know this is great for thousands and thousands of people from China. I congratulate all of them.&quot;

Malenchenko and Lu were previously crewmates on the STS-106 shuttle mission and did a spacewalk together during that flight.

<text>A content delivery network or content distribution network (CDN) is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance (&quot;speed&quot;) by distributing the service spatially relative to end users. CDNs came into existence in the late 1990s as a means for alleviating the performance bottlenecks of the Internet as the Internet was starting to become a mission-critical medium for people and enterprises. Since then, CDNs have grown to serve a large portion of the Internet content today, including web objects (text, graphics and scripts), downloadable objects (media files, software, documents), applications (e-commerce, portals), live streaming media, on-demand streaming media, and social media sites.

CDNs are a layer in the internet ecosystem. Content owners such as media companies and e-commerce vendors pay CDN operators to deliver their content to their end users. In turn, a CDN pays Internet service providers (ISPs), carriers, and network operators for hosting its servers in their data centers.

CDN is an umbrella term spanning different types of content delivery services: video streaming, software downloads, web and mobile content acceleration, licensed/managed CDN, transparent caching, and services to measure CDN performance, load balancing, Multi CDN switching and analytics and cloud intelligence. CDN vendors may cross over into other industries like security, DDoS protection and web application firewalls (WAF), and WAN optimization.

Notable content delivery service providers include Akamai Technologies, Edgio, Cloudflare, Amazon CloudFront, Fastly, and Google Cloud CDN.

== Technology ==
CDN nodes are usually deployed in multiple locations, often over multiple Internet backbones. Benefits include reducing bandwidth costs, improving page load times, and increasing the global availability of content. The number of nodes and servers making up a CDN varies, depending on the architecture, some reaching thousands of nodes with tens of thousands of servers on many remote points of presence (PoPs). Others build a global network and have a small number of geographical PoPs.
Requests for content are typically algorithmically directed to nodes that are optimal in some way. When optimizing for performance, locations that are best for serving content to the user may be chosen. This may be measured by choosing locations that are the fewest hops, the lowest number of network seconds away from the requesting client, or the highest availability in terms of server performance (both current and historical), to optimize delivery across local networks. When optimizing for cost, locations that are the least expensive may be chosen instead. In an optimal scenario, these two goals tend to align, as edge servers that are close to the end user at the edge of the network may have an advantage in performance or cost.

Most CDN providers will provide their services over a varying, defined, set of PoPs, depending on the coverage desired, such as United States, International or Global, Asia-Pacific, etc. These sets of PoPs can be called &quot;edges&quot;, &quot;edge nodes&quot;, &quot;edge servers&quot;, or &quot;edge networks&quot; as they would be the closest edge of CDN assets to the end user.

== Security and privacy ==
CDN providers profit either from direct fees paid by content providers using their network, or profit from the user analytics and tracking data collected as their scripts are being loaded onto customers&#x27; websites inside their browser origin. As such these services are being pointed out as potential privacy intrusions for the purpose of behavioral targeting and solutions are being created to restore single-origin serving and caching of resources.

In particular, a website using a CDN may violate the EU&#x27;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For example, in 2021 a German court forbade the use of a CDN on a university website, because this caused the transmission of the user&#x27;s IP address to the CDN, which violated the GDPR.

CDNs serving JavaScript have also been targeted as a way to inject malicious content into pages using them. Subresource Integrity mechanism was created in response to ensure that the page loads a script whose content is known and constrained to a hash referenced by the website author.

== Content networking techniques ==
The Internet was designed according to the end-to-end principle.
This principle keeps the core network relatively simple and moves the intelligence as much as possible to the network end-points: the hosts and clients. As a result, the core network is specialized, simplified, and optimized to only forward data packets.
Content Delivery Networks augment the end-to-end transport network by distributing on it a variety of intelligent applications employing techniques designed to optimize content delivery. The resulting tightly integrated overlay uses web caching, server-load balancing, request routing, and content services.

Web caches store popular content on servers that have the greatest demand for the content requested. These shared network appliances reduce bandwidth requirements, reduce server load, and improve the client response times for content stored in the cache. Web caches are populated based on requests from users (pull caching) or based on preloaded content disseminated from content servers (push caching).

Server-load balancing uses one or more techniques including service-based (global load balancing) or hardware-based (i.e. layer 4–7 switches, also known as a web switch, content switch, or multilayer switch) to share traffic among a number of servers or web caches. Here the switch is assigned a single virtual IP address. Traffic arriving at the switch is then directed to one of the real web servers attached to the switch. This has the advantage of balancing load, increasing total capacity, improving scalability, and providing increased reliability by redistributing the load of a failed web server and providing server health checks.

A content cluster or service node can be formed using a layer 4–7 switch to balance load across a number of servers or a number of web caches within the network.

Request routing directs client requests to the content source best able to serve the request. This may involve directing a client request to the service node that is closest to the client, or to the one with the most capacity. A variety of algorithms are used to route the request. These include Global Server Load Balancing, DNS-based request routing, Dynamic metafile generation, HTML rewriting, and anycasting. Proximity—choosing the closest service node—is estimated using a variety of techniques including reactive probing, proactive probing, and connection monitoring.

CDNs use a variety of methods of content delivery including, but not limited to, manual asset copying, active web caches, and global hardware load balancers.

=== Content service protocols ===
Several protocol suites are designed to provide access to a wide variety of content services distributed throughout a content network. The Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) was developed in the late 1990s to provide an open standard for connecting application servers. A more recently defined and robust solution is provided by the Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) protocol. This architecture defines OPES service applications that can reside on the OPES processor itself or be executed remotely on a Callout Server. Edge Side Includes or ESI is a small markup language for edge-level dynamic web content assembly. It is fairly common for websites to have generated content. It could be because of changing content like catalogs or forums, or because of the personalization. This creates a problem for caching systems. To overcome this problem, a group of companies created ESI.

=== Peer-to-peer CDNs ===
In &quot;peer-to-peer (P2P)&quot; content-delivery networks, clients provide resources as well as use them. This means that, unlike client–server systems, the content-centric networks can actually perform better as more users begin to access the content (especially with protocols such as Bittorrent that require users to share). This property is one of the major advantages of using P2P networks because it makes the setup and running costs very small for the original content distributor.

=== Private CDNs ===
If content owners are not satisfied with the options or costs of a commercial CDN service, they can create their own CDN. This is called a private CDN. A private CDN consists of PoPs (points of presence) that are only serving content for their owner. These PoPs can be caching servers, reverse proxies or application delivery controllers. It can be as simple as two caching servers, or large enough to serve petabytes of content.

Large content distribution networks may even build and set up their own private network to distribute copies of content across cache locations. Such private networks are usually used in conjunction with public networks as a backup option in case the capacity of the private network is not enough or there is a failure which leads to capacity reduction. Since the same content has to be distributed across many locations, a variety of multicasting techniques may be used to reduce bandwidth consumption. Over private networks, it has also been proposed to select multicast trees according to network load conditions to more efficiently utilize available network capacity.

== CDN trends ==

=== Emergence of telco CDNs ===
The rapid growth of streaming video traffic uses large capital expenditures by broadband providers in order to meet this demand and retain subscribers by delivering a sufficiently good quality of experience.

To address this, telecommunications service providers have begun to launch their own content delivery networks as a means to lessen the demands on the network backbone and reduce infrastructure investments.

=== Telco CDN advantages ===
Because they own the networks over which video content is transmitted, telco CDNs have advantages over traditional CDNs. They own the last mile and can deliver content closer to the end-user because it can be cached deep in their networks. This deep caching minimizes the distance that video data travels over the general Internet and delivers it more quickly and reliably.

Telco CDNs also have a built-in cost advantage since traditional CDNs must lease bandwidth from them and build the operator&#x27;s margin into their own cost model. In addition, by operating their own content delivery infrastructure, telco operators have better control over the utilization of their resources. Content management operations performed by CDNs are usually applied without (or with very limited) information about the network (e.g., topology, utilization etc.) of the telco-operators with which they interact or have business relationships. These pose a number of challenges for the telco-operators who have a limited sphere of action in face of the impact of these operations on the utilization of their resources.

In contrast, the deployment of telco-CDNs allows operators to implement their own content management operations, which enables them to have a better control over the utilization of their resources and, as such, provide better quality of service and experience to their end users.

=== Federated CDNs and Open Caching ===

In June 2011, StreamingMedia.com reported that a group of TSPs had founded an Operator Carrier Exchange (OCX) to interconnect their networks and compete more directly against large traditional CDNs like Akamai and Limelight Networks, which have extensive PoPs worldwide. This way, telcos are building a Federated CDN offering, which is more interesting for a content provider willing to deliver its content to the aggregated audience of this federation.

It is likely that in a near future, other telco CDN federations will be created. They will grow by enrollment of new telcos joining the federation and bringing network presence and their Internet subscriber bases to the existing ones.

The Open Caching specification by Streaming Media Alliance defines a set of APIs that allows a Content Provider to deliver its content using several CDNs in a consistent way, seeing each CDN provider the same way through these APIs.

=== Improving CDN performance using Extension Mechanisms for DNS ===
Traditionally, CDNs have used the IP of the client&#x27;s recursive DNS resolver to geo-locate the client. While this is a sound approach in many situations, this leads to poor client performance if the client uses a non-local recursive DNS resolver that is far away. For instance, a CDN may route requests from a client in India to its edge server in Singapore, if that client uses a public DNS resolver in Singapore, causing poor performance for that client. Indeed, a recent study showed that in many countries where public DNS resolvers are in popular use, the median distance between the clients and their recursive DNS resolvers can be as high as a thousand miles. In August 2011, a global consortium of leading Internet service providers led by Google announced their official implementation of the edns-client-subnet IETF Internet Draft, which is intended to accurately localize DNS resolution responses. The initiative involves a limited number of leading DNS service providers, such as Google Public DNS, and CDN service providers as well. With the edns-client-subnet EDNS0 option, CDNs can now utilize the IP address of the requesting client&#x27;s subnet when resolving DNS requests. This approach, called end-user mapping, has been adopted by CDNs and it has been shown to drastically reduce the round-trip latencies and improve performance for clients who use public DNS or other non-local resolvers. However, the use of EDNS0 also has drawbacks as it decreases the effectiveness of caching resolutions at the recursive resolvers, increases the total DNS resolution traffic, and raises a privacy concern of exposing the client&#x27;s subnet.

=== Virtual CDN (vCDN) ===
Virtualization technologies are being used to deploy virtual CDNs (vCDNs) with the goal to reduce content provider costs, and at the same time, increase elasticity and decrease service delay. With vCDNs, it is possible to avoid traditional CDN limitations, such as performance, reliability and availability since virtual caches are deployed dynamically (as virtual machines or containers) in physical servers distributed across the provider&#x27;s geographical coverage. As the virtual cache placement is based on both the content type and server or end-user geographic location, the vCDNs have a significant impact on service delivery and network congestion.

=== Image Optimization and Delivery (Image CDNs) ===
In 2017, Addy Osmani of Google started referring to software solutions that could integrate naturally with the Responsive Web Design paradigm (with particular reference to the &lt;picture&gt; element) as Image CDNs. The expression referred to the ability of a web architecture to serve multiple versions of the same image through HTTP, depending on the properties of the browser requesting it, as determined by either the browser or the server-side logic. The purpose of Image CDNs was, in Google&#x27;s vision, to serve high-quality images (or, better, images perceived as high-quality by the human eye) while preserving download speed, thus contributing to a great User experience (UX).

Arguably, the &quot;Image CDN&quot; term was originally a misnomer, as neither Cloudinary nor Imgix (the examples quoted by Google in the 2017 guide by Addy Osmani) were, at the time, a CDN in the classical sense of the term. Shortly afterwards, though, several companies offered solutions that allowed developers to serve different versions of their graphical assets according to several strategies. Many of these solutions were built on top of traditional CDNs, such as Akamai, CloudFront, Fastly, Edgecast and Cloudflare. At the same time, other solutions that already provided an image multi-serving service joined the Image CDN definition by either offering CDN functionality natively (ImageEngine) or integrating with one of the existing CDNs (Cloudinary/Akamai, Imgix/Fastly).

While providing a universally agreed-on definition of what an Image CDN is may not be possible, generally speaking, an Image CDN supports the following three components:

* A Content Delivery Network (CDN) for the fast serving of images.
* Image manipulation and optimization, either on-the-fly through URL directives, in batch mode (through manual upload of images) or fully automatic (or a combination of these).
* Device Detection (also known as Device Intelligence), i.e. the ability to determine the properties of the requesting browser and/or device through analysis of the User-Agent string, HTTP Accept headers, Client-Hints or JavaScript.

<text>Javier &quot;Javy&quot; López Torres (born November 5, 1970) is a Puerto Rican former catcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Atlanta Braves (1992–2003), Baltimore Orioles (2004–2006) and Boston Red Sox (2006). He batted and threw right-handed. He was named Ponce, Puerto Rico&#x27;s Athlete of the Year from 1984 to 1987.

==Professional career==

===Atlanta Braves===
López was signed by the Atlanta Braves in 1987 as an amateur free agent, López made his debut on September 18, 1992, against the Houston Astros. After sharing duties with Charlie O&#x27;Brien and Eddie Pérez for four seasons, he established himself as the Braves&#x27; regular catcher in 1996. The same season, he led the Braves to win the National League Championship Series, earning the series Most Valuable Player honors. He also made the National League All-Star team from 1997–98. Lopez had his best season in 2003 with a .328 batting average, 43 home runs and 109 RBI in 129 games, including a .378 on-base percentage and a .687 slugging percentage. In that season he broke Todd Hundley&#x27;s record for most home runs hit in a season by a catcher (41) and was selected to the All-Star Game, winning the Silver Slugger Award and finishing fifth in the National League MVP ballot. While with the Braves, López caught Kent Mercker&#x27;s no-hitter on April 8, 1994.

While López starred for the Braves, he very rarely caught future Hall of Fame pitcher Greg Maddux, who was not comfortable pitching to him. Instead the Braves&#x27; backup catcher, which varied over the years, would become Maddux&#x27;s personal catcher.

===Baltimore Orioles===
Before the 2004 season, López signed as a free agent with the Baltimore Orioles. He hit .316 with 23 HR and 86 RBI, the following year López suffered a broken hand on a foul tip, ending the year with a .278 with 15 HR and 49 RBI while seeing a decline in his game time from 150 to 103 games.

===Boston Red Sox===
In the 2006 midseason, López was acquired by the Boston Red Sox from Baltimore in exchange for minor league outfielder Adam Stern and cash considerations. López debuted with Boston on the same day after Doug Mirabelli left the game early after an ankle injury. On September 8, the Red Sox released López due to Jason Varitek returning from the disabled list, which minimized playing time for López.

===Retirement===
In January 2007, it was reported that López reached a preliminary agreement on a $750,000, one-year contract with the Colorado Rockies, but he did not play for them during the regular season. Before the 2008 season he signed a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training with the Atlanta Braves, in an attempt to return to the majors. But after being told he would not make the opening day lineup, López retired for good. &quot;I feel perfect physically,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s just that the hitting wasn&#x27;t there and unfortunately I couldn’t throw anybody out on stealing attempts. That&#x27;s a concern. I don&#x27;t blame them. My role as a backup catcher is to be able to throw runners out.&quot; He plans to continue in the Atlanta Braves organization performing other duties. In a 15-season career, López posted a .287 average with 260 home runs and 864 RBI in 1,503 games. His 243 home runs as a catcher ranks eighth on the career list at that position. Strong defensively, he recorded a .992 fielding percentage. In 60 postseason games, he batted .278 (57-for-205) with 27 runs, 14 doubles, 10 home runs, 28 RBI and 14 walks. His final game was on September 2, 2006.

==Personal life==
López&#x27;s first marriage was to Analy Hernández. They have two children: Javier Alexander (born November 6, 1995) and Kelvin Gabriel (born October 17, 1999). The marriage ended in divorce. López married his second wife, Gina Brodbeck, on June 23, 2004. They have two sons: Brody Brodbeck Lopez, born in 2010, and Gavin Richard Lopez, born in 2013.

<text>Larry Pina (born November 12, 1947) is an author of five do-it-yourself repair manuals for Apple Macintosh computers and peripherals. Pina authored the Mac shareware utility &quot;Test Pattern Generator&quot; (TPG) which allowed users to test and measure various video screen characteristics via test patterns. Among other circumstances, Mac users could use the TPG utility after performing hardware upgrades to check if the screen alignment needed adjusting. According to several of the books, Pina was living in Westport, Massachusetts when they were published.

<doc id="880868" wikidata="Q211089" url="?curid=880868" title="Büyük Menderes River">
<text>The Büyük Menderes River (&quot;Great Meander&quot;, historically the Maeander or Meander, from Ancient Greek: Μαίανδρος, &quot;Maíandros&quot;; ), is a river in southwestern Turkey. It rises in west central Turkey near Dinar before flowing west through the Büyük Menderes graben until reaching the Aegean Sea in the proximity of the ancient Ionian city Miletus. The river was well known for its sinuous, curving pattern, and gives its name to the common term used to describe these characteristic bends in rivers.

==Modern geography==
The river rises in a spring near Dinar and flows to Lake Işıklı. After passing the Adıgüzel Dam and the Cindere Dam, the river flows past Nazilli, Aydın and Söke before it drains into the Aegean Sea.

==Ancient geography==
The Maeander was a celebrated river of Caria in Asia Minor. It appears earliest in the Catalog of Trojans of Homer&#x27;s Iliad along with Miletus and Mycale.

===Sources===
The river has its sources not far from Celaenae in Phrygia (now Dinar), where it gushed forth in a park of Cyrus. According to some its sources were the same as those of the river Marsyas; but this is irreconcilable with Xenophon, according to whom the sources of the two rivers were only near each other, the Marsyas rising in a royal palace. Others state that the Maeander flowed out of a lake on Mount Aulocrene. William Martin Leake reconciles all these apparently different statements by the remark that both the Maeander and the Marsyas have their origin in the lake on Mount Aulocrene, above Celaenae, but that the issue at different parts of the mountain below the lake.

===Course===
The Maeander was so celebrated in antiquity for its numerous windings, that its classical name &quot;Maeander&quot; became, and still is, proverbial. Its whole course has a southwesterly direction on the south of the range of Mount Messogis. South of Tripolis it receives the waters of the Lycus, whereby it becomes a river of some importance. Near Carura it passes from Phrygia into Caria, where it flows in its tortuous course through the Maeandrian plain, and finally discharges itself in the Gulf of Icaros (an arm of the Aegean Sea), between the ancient Greek cities Priene and Myus, opposite to the Ionian city of Miletus, from which its mouth is only 10 stadia distant.

===Tributaries===
The tributaries of the Maeander include the Orgyas, Marsyas, Cludrus, Lethaeus, and Gaeson, in the north; and the Obrimas, Lycus, Harpasus, and a second Marsyas in the south.

===Physical description===
The Maeander is a deep river, but not very broad. In many parts its depth equals its breadth and, so, it is navigable only by small craft. It frequently overflows its banks and, as a result of the quantity of mud it deposits at its mouth, the coast has been pushed about 20 or 30 stadia (about 4 to 6 kilometers in modern units) further into the sea and several small islands off the coast have become united with the mainland.

===Mythology===
The associated river god was also called Meander, one of the sons of Oceanus and Tethys.

There was a legend about a subterranean connection between the Maeander and the Alpheus River in Elis.

<doc id="880871" wikidata="Q1087682" url="?curid=880871" title="Background check">
<text>A background check is a process used by an organisation or person to verify that an individual is who they claim to be, and check their past record to confirm education, employment history, and other activities, and for a criminal record. The frequency, purpose, and legitimacy of background checks vary among countries, industries, and individuals. An employment background check typically takes place when someone applies for a job, but it can also happen at any time the employer deems necessary. A variety of methods are used to complete these checks, including comprehensive database search and letters of reference.

== History ==

=== In the United States ===
In the 2000s, background checks became far more common after 9/11.

== Purposes ==

There are 17 common types of background checks employers use to verify a new hire. The checks can include: 
* Criminal history
* Past employment verification
* Education verification
* Reference check
* Drug screening
* Credit background check
* Social media behavior check
* Driving record
* Professional license and certifications check
* Social security number trace/identity check
* Global sanctions check
* Civil offenses check
* Bankruptcy check
* Financial regulations check
* Psychometric tests
* International background check
* Gamer profile check
&lt;br&gt;
Each check is briefly explained along with its purpose and how it helps employers make informed hiring decisions.

=== Employment screening ===
Employers often request background checks on job candidates for employment screening, especially for candidates seeking a position that requires high security or a position of trust, such as in a school, courthouse, hospital, financial institution, airport, and government. Background checks in the corporate realm have become a commonplace practice for many companies, aimed at mitigating legal liabilities and preventing adverse actions within their workforce.

They can also be requested when purchasing a firearm (from a legal authorization). A government agency traditionally administers these checks for a nominal fee, but private companies can also administer them. Results of a background check typically include past employment verification, credit history, and criminal history. The objective of background checks is to ensure the safety and security of the employees in the organization.

These checks are often used by employers as a means of judging a job candidate&#x27;s past mistakes, character, and fitness, and to identify potential hiring risks for safety and security reasons. Background checks are also used to thoroughly investigate potential government employees to be given a security clearance. However, these checks can sometimes be used for illegal purposes, such as unlawful discrimination (or employment discrimination), identity theft, and violation of privacy.

Checks are frequently conducted to confirm information found on an employment application or résumé/curriculum vitae. One study showed that half of all reference checks done on prospective employees differed between what the job applicant provided and what the source reported. They are also conducted as a way to differentiate potential employees further and pick the one the employer feels is best suited for the position. Employers are obligated to ensure their work environment is safe for all employees and helps prevent other employment problems in the workplace.

===Firearms purchases===
In the United States under the Gun Control Act of 1968, citizens and US residents must be 18 years or older to purchase shotguns, rifles, or ammunition. All other firearms – such as handguns – can only be sold to individuals 21 or older. Restricted firearms (like machine guns), suppressors, explosives or large quantities of precursor chemicals, and concealed weapons permits also require criminal checks. Checks are also required for those working in positions with special security concerns, such as trucking, ports of entry, and airports (including airline transportation). Laws exist to prevent those who do not pass a criminal check from working in careers involving the elderly, disabled, or children.

==Pre-employment screening==
Pre-employment screening refers to the process of investigating the backgrounds of potential employees and is commonly used to verify the accuracy of an applicant&#x27;s claims as well as to discover any possible criminal history, workers compensation claims, or employer sanctions.

=== Brazil ===
The Brazilian legal system prohibits discrimination against people. Many people consider background checks to be discriminatory.

Regulation and Laws on Background Checks
* Brazilian Constitution, Article 3, IV
* Brazilian Constitution, Article 5, X
* Brazilian Constitution, Article 7, XXXI
* Law No. 9.029/95

=== Netherlands ===
It is the responsibility of the employer to treat all personal information collected from the employee as confidential information and to limit the access to this information within the organization. The employer cannot retain the personal information from the applicant and must have protective measures in case of data breach. The employer must give the applicant the ability to access the personal information being held about them. Dutch Data Protection Authority must be notified of the background check.

Restrictions and Laws on Background checks

* The Data Protection Act 2001
* The Equal Treatment Act 1994
* The Judicial Data and Criminal Records Act 2004
* The Medical Examinations Act 1998
* Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights

=== Poland ===
The first Polish research on the issue of pre-employment screening shows that 81% of recruiters have come across the phenomenon of lies in the CVs of candidates for the job. It is the responsibility of the employer to collect necessary information and to protect it so that only certain people in the organization can access it. The applicant must receive a copy of the background check so that the applicant has the opportunity to make sure that the information in the background check is correct. The employer is not permitted to keep the personal information for a longer period than necessary.

Restrictions and Laws on Background checks
* The Polish Constitution dated 2 April 1997
* Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights
* Act of 26 June 1974 on The Labour Code
* Act of 24 May 2000 on National Criminal Records
* Act of 4 March 1994 on the Company Social Fund
* Act of 29 August 1997 on Personal Data Protection
* Regulation of Work and Social Policy Minister dated 28 May 1996

=== United Kingdom ===
The employer has to treat the personal information from the applicant as confidential. The applicant has to receive a copy of the background to check or update the information that appears on the background check. The employer can not retain the information more than it is necessary. The employer has to give any one who comes in contact with the information of the applicant a code of conduct. The company has to go through an audit to make sure they are complying and protecting the data.

Restrictions and Laws on Background Checks

* Criminal records checks: Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975
* Ability to work in the UK: Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006
* The Equality Act 2010
* Data Protection Act 1998
* Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (and Human Rights Act 1998)

During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the level of fraud almost doubled. Background-checking firm Powerchex claimed the number of applicants lying on their applications increased after the start of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. In 2009, Powerchex claimed that nearly one in 5 applicants has a major lie or discrepancy on his or her application. Almost half (48%) of organizations with fewer than 100 staff experienced problems with vetted employees. The research shows how many failures occurred in the relationship between employer and employee over the years and what dangers it brings. Applicants usually lie about additional skills (85%), dates of employment (58%), responsibilities (53%) or positions (28%).

==== Regulation ====
 The Financial Services Authority states in their Training &amp; Competence guidance that regulated firms should have:
* Adequacy of procedures for taking into account knowledge and skills of potential recruits for the role
* Adequacy of procedures for obtaining sufficient information about previous activities and training
* Adequacy of procedures for ensuring that individuals have passed appropriate exams or have appropriate exemptions
* Adequacy of procedures for assessing competence of individuals for sales roles

The Financial Services Authority&#x27;s statutory objectives:

# Protecting consumers
# Maintaining market confidence
# Promoting public awareness
# Reducing financial crime

=== United States ===
The employer must obtain consent from the applicant granting approval of the background check. The employer must be in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The employers have to guarantee that they will not discriminate against the applicant.

Most notably, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) regulates the use of consumer reports (which it defines as information collected and reported by third party agencies) as it pertains to adverse decisions, notification to the applicant, and destruction and safekeeping of records. If a consumer report is used as a factor in an adverse hiring decision, the applicant must be presented with a &quot;pre-adverse action disclosure,&quot; a copy of the FCRA summary of rights, and a &quot;notification of adverse action letter.&quot; Individuals are entitled to know the source of any information used against them, including a credit reporting company. Individuals must also consent in order for the employer to obtain a credit report.

Title XLV, section 768.095 of the &quot;Florida Statutes&quot; is a law that allows former employers to disclose information about an employee to a future employer, protecting employers from negligent hiring liabilities. Employers use disclosed information from past employers when a background check does not provide enough information on the employee. Employers have to verify that the information disclosed to them is true because if it is false, the employer will be violating the civil rights of the employee.

There are a variety of types of investigative searches that can be used by potential employers. Many commercial sites will offer specific searches to employers for a fee. Services like these will actually perform the checks, supply the company with adverse action letters, and ensure compliance throughout the process. It is important to be selective about which pre-employment screening agency one uses. A legitimate company will maintain a background check policy and will explain the process.

Many employers choose to search the most common records such as criminal records, driving records, and education verification. Other searches such as sex offender registry, credential verification, skills assessment, reference checks, credit reports and Patriot Act searches are becoming increasingly common.

Larger companies are more likely to outsource than their smaller counterparts – the average staff size of the companies who outsource is 3,313 compared to 2,162 for those who carry out in-house checks. Financial service firms had the highest proportion of respondents who outsource the service, with over a quarter (26%) doing so, compared to an overall average of 16% who outsource vetting to a third party provider. The construction and property industry showed the lowest level of outsourcing, with 89% of such firms in the sample carrying out checks in-house, making the overall average 16%. This can increase over the years. Companies that choose to outsource must be sure to use companies that are Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) compliant. Companies that fail to use an FCRA compliant company may face legal issues.

As a general rule, employers may not take adverse action against an applicant or employee (not hiring or terminating them), solely on the basis of results obtained through a database search. Database searches, as opposed to source records searches (search of actual county courthouse records), are notoriously inaccurate, contain incomplete or outdated information, and should only be used as an added safety net when conducting a background check. Failure by employers to follow FCRA guidelines can result in hefty penalties.

== Criminal records ==
In the United States, the employer could use criminal records as verification as long as the employer does not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin, as analyzed under the disparate treatment and disparate impact frameworks. There are several types of criminal record searches available to employers, some more accurate and up to date than others. These &quot;third party&quot; background checking agencies cannot guarantee the accuracy of their information, thus many of them have incomplete records or inaccurate records. The only way to conduct an accurate background check is to go directly through the state. Most times using the state of choice is much cheaper than using a &quot;third party&quot; agency. Many websites offer the &quot;instant&quot; background check, which will search a compilation of databases containing public information for a fee. These &quot;instant&quot; searches originate from a variety of sources, from statewide court and corrections records to law enforcement records which usually stem from county or metro law enforcement offices. There are also other database-type criminal searches, such as statewide repositories and the national crime file. A commonly used criminal search by employers who outsource is the county criminal search.

== Social media ==
Employers could use social media as tool to conduct a background check on an applicant. An employer could check the applicant&#x27;s Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn accounts to see how the applicant behaves outside of work. U.S. employers are legally prohibited from taking into account anything they discover about a person&#x27;s marital status, sexual orientation, religion, or political views when making the final decision to hire or not hire the applicant.
Some companies provide Media Mentions Reports collected from open sources including Social Media public accounts.

== Character reference checks ==
Employers may investigate past employment to verify position and salary information. More intensive checks can involve interviews with anybody that knew or previously knew the applicant—such as teachers, friends, coworkers, neighbors, and family members; however, extensive hearsay investigations in background checks can expose companies to lawsuits. Past employment and personal reference verifications are moving toward standardization with most companies in order to avoid expensive litigation. These usually range from simple verbal confirmations of past employment and timeframe to deeper, such as discussions about performance, activities and accomplishments, and relations with others. The past experiences and the companies which have provided these experiences are also verified and researched upon to detect frauds.

== Identity and address verification ==
A fraudulent SSN may be indicative of identity theft, incorrect claims of citizenship status, or concealment of a &quot;past life&quot;. Background screening firms usually perform a Social Security trace to determine where the applicant or employee has lived. The hiring of undocumented workers has become an increasing issue for American businesses since the formation of the Department of Homeland Security and its Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) division, as immigration raids have forced employers to consider including legal working status as part of their background screening process. All employers are required to keep government Form I-9 documents on all employees and some states mandate the use of the federal E-Verify program to research the working status of Social Security numbers. With increased concern for right-to-work issues, many outsourcing companies are sprouting in the marketplace to help automate and store Form I-9 documentation.

== Credit check ==
Credit checks are conducted for applicants who are applying to positions that deal with financial records or deal with a lot of money. For example, in the state of Illinois, employers could use an applicant&#x27;s credit history, only the credit score is considered satisfactory. Individuals must also give consent in order for the employer to obtain a credit report. Pre-employment credit reports do not include a credit score. A pre-employment credit report will show up on an individual&#x27;s credit report as a &quot;soft inquiry&quot; and do not affect the individual&#x27;s credit score.

== Controversies ==
Drug tests and credit checks for employment are highly controversial practices. According to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a project of the Utility Consumers&#x27; Action Network (UCAN): &quot;While some people are not concerned about background investigations, others are uncomfortable with the idea of investigators poking around in their personal histories. In-depth checks could unearth information that is irrelevant, outdated, taken out of context, or just plain wrong. A further concern is that the report might include information that is illegal to use for hiring purposes or which comes from questionable sources.&quot;

In May 2002, allegedly improper post-hire checks conducted by Northwest Airlines were the subject of a civil lawsuit between Northwest and 10,000 of their mechanics.

In the case of an arrest that did not lead to a conviction, employment checks can continue including the arrest record for up to seven years, per § 605 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act:

: &quot;Except as authorized under subsection (b) of this section, no consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing . . . Civil suits, civil judgments, and records of arrest that from date of entry, antedate the report by more than seven years or until the governing statute of limitations has expired, whichever is the longer period.&quot;

Subsection (b) provides for an exception if the report is in connection with &quot;the employment of any individual at an annual salary which equals, or which may reasonably be expected to equal $75,000, or more&quot;.

Some proposals for decreasing potential harm to innocent applicants include:
* Furnishing the applicant with a copy of the report before it is given to the employer, so that any inaccuracies can be addressed beforehand; and
* Allowing only conviction (not arrest) records to be reported.

In New Zealand, criminal checks have been affected by the &quot;Criminal Records (Clean Slate) Act 2004&quot;, which allows individuals to legally conceal &quot;less serious&quot; convictions from their records provided they had been conviction-free for at least seven years.

In Michigan, the system of criminal checks has been criticized in a recent case where a shooting suspect was able to pass an FBI check to purchase a shotgun although he had failed the check for a state handgun permit. According to the spokesman of the local police department,

 &quot;... you could have a clear criminal history but still have contacts with law enforcement that would not rise to the level of an arrest or conviction [that can be used] to deny a permit whether or not those involved arrests that might show up on a criminal history.&quot;

The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence has criticized the federal policy, which denies constitutional rights based on a criminal check only if the subject has been accused of a crime.

<doc id="880878" wikidata="Q1306880" url="?curid=880878" title="FpML">
<text>FpML (Financial products Markup Language) is a business information exchange standard based on Extensible Markup Language (XML) that enables business-to-business over-the-counter (OTC) financial derivative transactions online by following W3C standards.

The standard is managed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) on behalf of a community of investment banks that make up the OTC derivatives industry. All categories of privately negotiated derivatives will eventually be included within the standard.

FpML is distinct from similar financial standards such as SWIFT and FIX because it does not specify a network or transport mechanism.

==History==
The FpML standard was first published by JPMorgan and PricewaterhouseCoopers on 9 June 1999 in a paper titled &quot;Introducing FpML: A New Standard for E-commerce&quot;. As a result, the FpML standards committee was founded.

The core scope includes the products of Foreign Exchange (FX) Swaps and Options, Interest Rate Swaps, Inflation Swaps, Asset Swaps, Swaptions, Credit Default Swaps, Credit Default Swap Indices and Baskets, Equity Derivatives, Equity Swaps, Total Return Swaps, and many others.

The core processes include trading, valuation, confirmation, novation, increase, amendment, termination, allocation, position reporting, cash flow matching, formal definition of party roles, as well as trade notification between asset managers and custodians.

As of December 2021, FpML 5.12 is the latest recommended version.

<text>Norse cosmology is the account of the universe and its laws by the ancient North Germanic peoples. The topic encompasses concepts from Norse mythology and Old Norse religion such as notations of time and space, cosmogony, personifications, anthropogeny, and eschatology. Like other aspects of Norse mythology, these concepts are primarily recorded from earlier oral sources in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, a collection of poems compiled in the 13th century, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, authored by Icelander Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century. Together these sources depict an image of Nine Worlds around a cosmic tree, Yggdrasil.

==Time and space==

Concepts of time and space play a major role in the Old Norse corpus&#x27;s presentation of Norse cosmology. While events in Norse mythology describe a somewhat linear progression, various scholars in ancient Germanic studies note that Old Norse texts may imply or directly describe a fundamental belief in cyclic time. According to scholar John Lindow, &quot;the cosmos might be formed and reformed on multiple occasions by the rising sea.&quot;

==Cosmogony==
Drawing in part on various eddic poems, the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; section of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; contains an account of the development and creation of the cosmos: long before the Earth came to be, there existed the bright and flaming place called Muspell—a location so hot that foreigners may not enter it—and the foggy land of Niflheim. In Niflheim was a spring, Hvergelmir, and from it flow numerous rivers. Together these rivers, known as Élivágar, flowed further and further from their source. Eventually the poisonous substance within the flow came to harden and turn to ice. When the flow became entirely solid, a poisonous vapor rose from the ice and solidified into rime atop the solid river. These thick ice layers grew, in time spreading across the void of Ginnungagap.

The northern region of Ginnungagap continued to fill with weight from the growing substance and its accompanying blowing vapor, yet the southern portion of Ginnungagap remained clear due to its proximity to the sparks and flames of Muspell. Between Niflheim and Muspell, ice and fire, was a placid location, &quot;as mild as a windless sky&quot;. When the rime and the blowing heat met, the liquid melted and dropped, and this mixture formed the primordial being Ymir, the ancestor of all jötnar. Ymir sweated while sleeping. From his left arm grew a male and female jötunn, &quot;and one of his legs begot a son with another&quot;, and these limbs too produced children.

Ymir fed from rivers of milk that flowed from the teats of the primordial cow, Auðumbla. Auðumbla fed from salt she licked from rime stones. Over the course of three days, she licked free a beautiful and strong man, Búri. Búri&#x27;s son Borr married a jötunn named Bestla, and the two had three sons: the gods Odin, Vili and Vé. The sons killed Ymir, and Ymir&#x27;s blood poured across the land, producing great floods that killed all of the jötnar but two (Bergelmir and his unnamed wife, who sailed across the flooded landscape).

Odin, Vili, and Vé took Ymir&#x27;s corpse to the center of Ginnungagap and carved it. They made the earth from Ymir&#x27;s flesh; the rocks from his bones; from his blood the sea, lakes, and oceans; and scree and stone from his molars, teeth, and remaining bone fragments. They surrounded the earth&#x27;s lands with sea, forming a circle. From Ymir&#x27;s skull they made the sky, which they placed above the earth in four points, each held by a dwarf (Norðri, Suðri, Austri and Vestri—Old Norse &#x27;north, south, east, and west&#x27;, respectively).

After forming the dome of the Earth, the brothers Odin, Vili and Vé took sparks of light from Muspell and placed them around the Earth, both above and below. Some remained fixed and others moved through the sky in predetermined courses. The trio provided land for the jötnar to leave by the sea. Using Ymir&#x27;s eyelashes, the trio built a fortification around the center of the landmass to contain the hostility of the jötnar. They called this fortification Miðgarðr (Old Norse &#x27;central enclosure&#x27;). Finally, from Ymir&#x27;s brains, they formed the clouds.

From Ymir&#x27;s eyebrows they crafted a stronghold named Midgard. When they were walking along the seashore, they found two trees and shaped humans of them. Odin gave them spirit and life, Vili gave them wit and feeling, and Vé gave them form, speech, hearing, and sight. They gave them clothing and names: the man was called Askr, and the woman Embla. They were the ancestors of mankind who lived in Midgard. The brothers made for themselves in the middle of the world a city called Asgard, where the gods lived.

==Personifications==
Personifications, such as those of astronomical objects, time, and water bodies occur in Norse mythology. The Sun is personified as a goddess, Sól (Old Norse &#x27;Sun&#x27;); the moon is personified as a male entity, Máni (Old Norse &#x27;moon&#x27;); and the Earth too is personified (Jörð, Old Norse &#x27;earth&#x27;). Night appears personified as the female jötunn Nótt (Old Norse &#x27;night&#x27;); day is personified as Dagr (Old Norse &#x27;day&#x27;); and Dagr&#x27;s father, the god Dellingr (Old Norse &#x27;shining&#x27;), may in some manner personify the dawn. Bodies of water also receive personification, such as the goddess Rán, her jötunn husband Ægir, and their wave-maiden children, the Nine Daughters of Ægir and Rán.

==Yggdrasil==
Yggdrasil is a tree central to the Norse concept of the cosmos. The tree&#x27;s branches extend into various realms, and various creatures dwell on and around it. The gods go to Yggdrasil daily to assemble at their things, traditional governing assemblies. The branches of Yggdrasil extend far into the heavens, and the tree is supported by three roots that extend far away into other locations; one to the well Urðarbrunnr in the heavens, one to the spring Hvergelmir, and another to the well Mímisbrunnr. Creatures live within Yggdrasil, including the dragon Níðhöggr, an unnamed eagle, and the stags Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Duraþrór.

==Nine Worlds==

Old Norse texts mention the existence of &quot;Níu Heimar&quot;, translated by scholars as &quot;Nine Worlds&quot;. According to the second stanza of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, the Nine Worlds surround the tree Yggdrasil. As recalled by a dead völva in the poem:
The Nine Worlds receive a second and final mention in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; in stanza 43 of the poem &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, where the wise jötunn Vafþrúðnir engages in a deadly battle of wits with the disguised god Odin:

The Nine Worlds receive a single mention in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, occurring section 34 of the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; portion of the book. The section describes how Odin threw Loki&#x27;s daughter Hel into the underworld, and granted her power over all Nine Worlds:
The Old Norse corpus does not clearly list the Nine Worlds, if it provides them at all. However, some scholars have proposed identifications for the nine. For example, Henry Adams Bellows (1923) says that the Nine Worlds consist of Ásgarðr, Vanaheimr, Álfheimr, Miðgarðr, Jötunheimr, Múspellsheimr, Svartálfaheimr, Niflheimr (sometimes Hel), and perhaps Niðavellir. Some editions of translations of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; feature illustrations of what the author or artist suspects the Nine Worlds to be in part based on the &quot;Völuspá&quot; stanza above.

==Anthropogeny==

Askr and Embla—male and female respectively—were the first two humans, created by the gods from driftwood they encounter on a shore. The gods who form these first humans vary by source: According to the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, they are Hœnir, Lóðurr and Odin, whereas in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; they are Odin, Vili, and Vé.

==Eschatology==

Ragnarök is a series of future events, including a great battle, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures (including various deities), the occurrence of various natural disasters, and the subsequent submersion of the world in water. Afterward, the world will resurface anew and fertile, the surviving and returning gods will meet, and mankind will be repopulated by Líf and Lífþrasir, who will emerge from Yggdrasil.

<text>Lilith: A Romance is a fantasy novel by Scottish writer George MacDonald, first published in 1895. It was reprinted in paperback by Ballantine Books as the fifth volume of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in September 1969.

&quot;Lilith: A Romance&quot; is considered among the darkest of MacDonald&#x27;s works, and among the most profound. It is a story concerning the nature of life, death, and salvation. In the story, MacDonald mentions a cosmic sleep that heals tortured souls, preceding the salvation of all. MacDonald was a Christian universalist, believing that all will eventually be saved. However, in this story, divine punishment is not taken lightly, and salvation is hard-won.

==Plot summary==
Mr. Vane, the protagonist of &quot;Lilith&quot;, owns a library that seems to be haunted by the former librarian, who looks much like a raven from the brief glimpses he catches of the wraith. After finally encountering the supposed ghost, the mysterious Mr. Raven, Vane learns that Raven had known his father; indeed, Vane&#x27;s father had visited the strange parallel universe from which Raven comes and goes and now resides therein. Vane follows Raven into the world through a mirror (this symbolistic realm is described as &quot;the region of the seven dimensions&quot;, a term taken from Jacob Boehme).

Inside the world, Vane learns of a house of beds where the dreamers sleep until the end of the world in death: a good death, in which life is found. Vane&#x27;s grandfather refused to sleep there and is, instead, forced to do battle with skeletons in a haunted wood. After a treacherous journey through a valley (where the moon is the only thing to keep him safe), Mr. Vane meets the Little Ones, children who never grow up, remaining pure children or becoming selfish and getting bigger and dumber, turning into &quot;bags&quot; or bad giants. After conversing with Lona, the eldest of the children, Mr. Vane decides to help them, and sets off to gather more information, although the Raven has warned Mr. Vane that he needs to sleep along with the dreamers before he can really help them. Mr. Vane learns that the Raven is also Adam and his wife is Eve.

While on his journey, he meets Lilith, Adam&#x27;s first wife and the princess of Bulika. Vane, although nearly blinded by Lilith&#x27;s beauty and charms, eventually leads the Little Ones in a battle against Bulika. Lona, Vane&#x27;s love, turns out to be Lilith&#x27;s daughter, and is killed by her own mother. Lilith, however, is captured and brought to Adam and Eve at the house of death, where they struggle to make her open her hand, fused shut, in which she holds the water the Little Ones need to grow. Only when she gives it up can Lilith join the sleepers in blissful dreams, free of sin. After a long struggle, Lilith bids Adam cut her hand from her body; it is done, Lilith sleeps, and Vane is sent to bury the hand; water flows from the hole and washes the land over. Vane is then allowed to join the Little Ones, already asleep, in their dreaming. He takes his bed, next to Lona&#x27;s, and finds true life in death.

Mr. Vane awakens in his home, then is afterwards unsure that he is really awake, but actually dreaming that he is awake. He does not attempt to re-enter the parallel world but waits &quot;all the days of (his) appointed time ...till (his) change come&quot;.

==Critical reception==
James Blish ranked &quot;Lilith&quot; as &quot;one of the great originals,&quot; saying that its &quot;allegory is far from obtrusive, and the story proper both tense and decidedly eerie.&quot; E. F. Bleiler described it as &quot;a long parabolic narrative heavily laden with Victorian Christian symbolism&quot; and noted that critical opinion of the novel was sharply divided: &quot;Some critics regard it highly for its fine images and verbal flashes&quot;, while others regard it as a most unpleasant work with an unpalatable message.&quot; Neil Barron argued that &quot;Lilith&quot; &quot;has parallels with &quot;Phantastes&quot; (1858) and shows the slight influence of Carroll, but it is easily the strangest product of Victorian fantasy. It is the obvious parent of Lindsay&#x27;s &quot;Voyage to Arcturus&quot; (1920) and fascinated C. S. Lewis; as an allegory of heterodox Christianity it bears an interesting relation to the works of T. F. Powys.&quot;

<text>Louis-René Beaudoin (May 5, 1912 – February 21, 1970) was Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada from 1953 to 1957.

Though trained as a lawyer, Beaudoin came from a working class background and financed his education by working as a bus driver and labourer. He became a legal advisor to the Quebec Federation of Labour and volunteered for the Quebec Liberal Party prior to winning election to Parliament. He founded a law firm in Montreal with Maurice Riel during the 1950s under the name Beaudoin, Riel, Geoffrion &amp; Vermette now known as Dunton Rainville.

Beadouin was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1945 election as a Liberal from Quebec. He became Deputy Speaker in 1952 and was appointed Speaker of the House of Commons on November 12, 1953.

Beaudoin&#x27;s nomination was seconded by Leader of the Opposition George Drew. His reputation as a competent Speaker grew until the Pipeline Debate in 1956 in which the government invoked closure repeatedly in an attempt to force legislation through the house and force a vote with a minimum of debate.

In the course of the debate, Beaudoin initially ruled that debate could occur on an appeal of a ruling by the Deputy Speaker. The next day, Beaudoin reversed his ruling and moved that the vote on the appeal proceed without debate. The Opposition was outraged and a number of Members of Parliament (MPs) stormed the Chair, calling the Speaker a &quot;traitor&quot; and &quot;coward&quot;.

The following Monday, George Drew introduced a motion of censure against Beaudoin whom he accused of destroying the Speakership. The Liberal majority defeated the motion, but less than a month later, Mr. Drew called attention to a newspaper in which there was a letter by Beaudoin criticizing the behaviour of opposition members during the pipeline debate. Beaudoin argued it was a private letter, not intended to be published. The following day, however, he placed his resignation before the House. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent was out of the country, but on returning, he persuaded Mr. Beaudoin to stay on until the end of the Parliament.

Beaudoin&#x27;s reputation was destroyed. While he was re-elected to the House in the 1957 election, he had lost interest in political life and did not contest the 1958 election.

After obtaining a Reno, Nevada divorce from his wife of 21 years, he married Alice Margaret Outram, 24 years his junior, and moved to the United States. Briefly enrolled in a doctoral program at Columbia University, he left without finishing his thesis and spent the remainder of his life drifting from job to job, eventually finding work as a bartender at Freddy&#x27;s Tavern in Tempe, Arizona. In 1964 his second marriage failed and the following year he returned to Canada. For part of 1965 he taught high school French at Morin Heights High School in the Quebec Laurentians.

In February 1970 he died aged 57 of a heart attack, &quot;virtually penniless and alone, in the back seat of a Montreal taxi.&quot;

<text>James Wood-Mason (December 1846 – 6 May 1893) was an English zoologist. He was the director of the Indian Museum at Calcutta, after John Anderson. He collected marine animals and lepidoptera, but is best known for his work on two other groups of insects, phasmids (stick insects) and mantises (praying mantises).

The genus &quot;Woodmasonia&quot; Brunner, 1907, and at least ten species of phasmids, are named after him.

==Life and career==

Wood-Mason was born in Gloucestershire, England, where his father was a doctor. He was educated at Charterhouse School and Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. He went out to India in 1869 to work in the Indian Museum, Calcutta, which in 2008 still housed his collection of insects.

In 1872 he sailed to the Andaman Islands, mostly studying marine animals, but also collecting and later describing two new phasmids, &quot;Bacillus hispidulus&quot; and &quot;Bacillus westwoodii&quot;.
Wood-Mason described 24 new species of phasmids, mostly from South Asia but also some from Australia, New Britain, Madagascar, the Malay peninsula and Fiji. His naming of &quot;Cotylosoma dipneusticum&quot; (Wood-Mason, 1878) is particularly curious as he never formally described the species; it was wrongly imagined to be semi-aquatic; it was &quot;described with what is probably the least precise measurement ever used for a phasmid&quot;, namely &quot;&quot;between three and four inches in length&quot;; and he gave its locality as Borneo, when in fact it came from Fiji.

In 1887 he became Superintendent of the Indian Museum. Also in 1887, he became vice-president of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.

In 1888 he sailed on the Indian Marine Survey steamship , working on and later describing new species of Crustacea, along with Alfred William Alcock, who recorded the voyage in his classic natural history book &quot;A Naturalist in Indian Seas&quot; (1902).

For several years he suffered from Bright&#x27;s disease. On 5 April 1893, unable to work, he left India for England, but died at sea on 6 May 1893.

===Flower mantis drawing===

Wood-Mason gave his flower mantis drawing to Alfred Russel Wallace, who wrote in his 1889 book &quot;Darwinism&quot;:

Wallace passed the drawing to Edward Bagnall Poulton, who published it in his 1890 book &quot;The Colours of Animals&quot;.

==Honours==
Wood-Mason was a Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society. In 1888 he became a Fellow of the University of Calcutta.

Over 10 marine animals have the specific name &quot;woodmasoni&quot; in his honour, including several described by Alcock of the &quot;Investigator&quot; : &quot;Heterocarpus woodmasoni&quot;, &quot;Coryphaenoides woodmasoni&quot;, &quot;Thalamita woodmasoni&quot;, and &quot;Rectopalicus woodmasoni&quot;.

Two species of snake are named in his honour: &quot;Oligodon woodmasoni&quot; and &quot;Uropeltis woodmasoni&quot;.

<doc id="880897" wikidata="Q1771310" url="?curid=880897" title="Scottish Aviation Bulldog">
<text>The Scottish Aviation Bulldog is a British two-seat side-by-side (with optional third seat) training aircraft designed by Beagle Aircraft as the B.125 Bulldog.

The prototype Bulldog flew on 19 May 1969 at Shoreham Airport. The first order for the type was for 78 from the Swedish Air Board. Before any production aircraft were built, Beagle Aircraft ceased trading and the production rights for the aircraft, with the Swedish order, were taken over by Scottish Aviation (Bulldog) Limited. All subsequent aircraft were built at Prestwick Airport by Scottish Aviation, and later by British Aerospace.

==Operational history==
=== Sweden ===
The first 58 aircraft (known as the SK 61A and SK 61B) were delivered to the Swedish Air Force in 1971. Twenty more aircraft were delivered to the Swedish Army as FPL 61C in 1972, although these were transferred to the Air Force in 1989 as SK 61C. By 2001 all the Swedish aircraft had been withdrawn from military service. 26 were bought in 2004 by the Hungarian company AVIA-Rent.

=== United Kingdom ===

The largest customer was the Royal Air Force, which placed an order for 130 Bulldogs in 1972, entering service as the Bulldog T.1 in 1975. It was used by the Royal Air Force as a basic trainer, in particular as the standard aircraft of the University Air Squadrons and, later, Air Experience Flights, providing flying training. The aircraft was also used by the Royal Navy for Elementary Flying Training (EFT) at RAF Topcliffe.

The RAF sold off its remaining Bulldog trainers in 2001 as general aviation light aircraft for a low price. They were replaced by the Grob Tutor.

== Variants ==

The following Bulldog models were produced:

;Bulldog Series 1: One prototype built by Beagle Aircraft (&quot;G-AXEH&quot;), one built by Scottish Aviation; now in the collection of the National Museum of Flight at East Fortune, East Lothian.

In the 1990s, Wehbe married her cousin Nasr Fayyad when she was 18 and traveled with him to Nigeria where he worked. During her pregnancy, she returned to Lebanon and separated from Fayyad, with whom she had one daughter, Zeinab.

On June 25, 2007, Wehbe survived an accident while filming a music video for the song &quot;Hasa Ma Bena&quot; in Lebanon.

== Criticism and controversy ==

=== Wardrobe incident ===
In November 2014, Wehbe caused controversy and was later heavily criticized, when she wore a revealing dress during a live episode of &quot;Arab Star Academy&quot;, where her bare buttocks were shown. She later apologized and blamed the stage lighting.

=== Allegations of Racism ===
In 2009, the lyrics to Baba Fein aroused controversy with Nubians, as the lyrics said &quot;Where is my teddy bear and the Nubian monkey?&quot; referring to Nubians as &quot;monkeys&quot;. Nubians in Egypt accused her that her song aroused racism and discrimination. The lyric has since been removed from multiple music platforms.

==Political and social views==
During the 2006 Israel–Lebanon War, she left her home, in Verdun, Beirut and moved to Egypt for the duration of the conflict. In a concert in the Lebanese town of Jounieh, Wehbe congratulated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah for his stand against Israel during the war.

Wehbe also refused to perform at any concert during the 34 days of the war, including fundraisers, saying that there were more ways than one to show support for Lebanon.

Another incident occurred after the 2009 Egypt–Algeria World Cup dispute, adding to the diplomatic tension between the two countries. Wehbe went on to make statements that she would not be performing in Algeria anytime soon, because Algerians &quot;...wouldn&#x27;t understand her music&quot;. Algeria&#x27;s cultural minister responded by stating that Wehbe would be banned from performing in Algeria for insulting Algeria and the Algerian people regardless of whether she apologizes.

In January 2012, Wehbe tweeted that she loves all her fans including her &quot;gay fan base&quot;. In June 2017, she replied to someone&#x27;s criticism on Twitter by writing: &quot;When a faggot speaks&quot;, which was later deleted. In 2018, she shared a photo on Snapchat with a rainbow flag, signaling her support for the LGBT community. In February 2019, Wehbe launched a fashion brand, &quot;Beau Voyou&quot;, which had rainbow colors, in which she commented, &quot;For me, equality goes all the way&quot;, then added, &quot;Get ready to celebrate unrestricted and boundless love&quot;.

== Image ==
Wehbe was ranked 8th in the 2006 Edition of the Top 99 Most Desirable Women by the website AskMen.com.

Some in the more conservative Arab countries deem her revealing outfits as scandalous. One Bahraini member of parliament called her a sexual singer who spoke with her body, not her voice. Wehbe said she was aware of the efforts to ban her from performing at the concert but had chosen to ignore their attempts to silence her.

In November 2014, Wehbe caused controversy and was later heavily criticized, when she wore a revealing dress during a live episode of &quot;Arab Star Academy&quot;. She later apologized and blamed the stage lighting.

In April 2008, the Islamic-dominated parliament of Bahrain passed a motion urging the government to ban Haifa Wehbe&#x27;s show in the country. As a result of the motion, Wehbe performed in Bahrain with more modest dress, wearing a long green gown with a low V-neckline during the performance.

<doc id="880903" wikidata="Q17188" url="?curid=880903" title="Expedition 6">
<text>Expedition 6 was the sixth expedition to the International Space Station (25 November 2002 – 3 May 2003). It was the last three-man crew to reside on the station until the arrival of STS-121 in 2006, delivering the final astronaut of Expedition 13. The crew performed two spacewalks in support of maintenance and assembly of the International Space Station.

==Crew==

== Mission parameters ==
* Perigee: 384 km
* Apogee: 396 km
* Inclination: 51.6°
* Period: 92 min

== Mission objectives ==
The station&#x27;s sixth crew was launched to the Station aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; STS-113 in November 2002. The mission was planned to be a four-month mission that was to end in March 2003 when &quot;Atlantis&quot; STS-114 was to fly to the station with the Expedition 7 crew. The &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, which occurred during the mission on 1 February 2003 and resulted in the indefinite suspension of shuttle flights, led to a change of plan such that the crew stayed on the station until May 2003. They returned to Earth on Soyuz TMA-1, and a reduced Expedition 7 crew with just two members was delivered to the ISS on Soyuz TMA-2. The Space Shuttle was expected to be grounded for up to two years. Ongoing logistical support for the ISS would have to be carried out by Soyuz and Progress flights until the Space Shuttle returned to flight.

The sixth crew of the International Space Station returned to Earth just after 10 p.m. EDT on 3 May 2003, the first time U.S. astronauts landed in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft, though a U.S. space tourist, Dennis Tito, had done so in 2001.

Russian Mission Control reported at approximately 2:45 a.m. on 4 May that the support helicopters had reached the crew, and all three crew members were in good health. The capsule touched down approximately 276 miles (444 km) from its planned landing zone.

Originally scheduled to fly on the Expedition 6 crew in place of Don Pettit was Donald A. Thomas.

== Spacewalks ==
The Expedition 6 crew conducted two spacewalks during its stay at the International Space Station. Both were based out of the Quest Airlock, and the spacewalkers used U.S. spacesuits, which are called Extravehicular Mobility Units, or EMUs. The crew was originally scheduled to conduct only one spacewalk, but a second was added to the manifest for 8 April in order to prepare for future assembly missions.

The two Expedition 6 extravehicular activities bring the total number of spacewalks conducted in support of ISS assembly and maintenance to 51. Of those 51 EVA&#x27;s, Twenty-six have been based out of the station, with 17 staged from Quest. Bowersox and Pettit accumulated 13 hours and 17 minutes of spacewalking time at the station.

== Cultural references ==
Expedition 6 is the subject of the book &quot;Too Far From Home: A Story of Life and Death in Space&quot;, by Chris Jones.

A dramatised account of Expedition 6 is told in &quot;Expedition 6&quot;, a play by actor/playwright Bill Pullman. The play was scheduled to run at San Francisco&#x27;s Magic Theater through 7 October 2007.

<text>Alfred William Alcock (23 June 1859 in Bombay – 24 March 1933 in Belvedere, Kent) was a British physician, naturalist, and carcinologist.

==Early life and education==
Alcock was the son of a sea-captain, John Alcock in Bombay, India who retired to live in Blackheath. His mother was a daughter of Christopher Puddicombe, the only son of a Devon squire.

Alcock studied at Mill Hill School, at Blackheath Proprietary School and at Westminster School. In 1876 his father faced financial losses and he was taken out of school and sent to India in the Wynaad district. Here he was taken care of by relatives engaged in coffee-planting. As a boy of 17 he spent time in the jungles of Malabar.

== Career ==
Coffee-planting in Wynaad declined and Alcock obtained a post at a commission agent&#x27;s office in Calcutta. This office closed soon, and he worked from 1878 to 1880 in Purulia as an agent recruiting unskilled labourers for the Assam tea gardens. While here an acquaintance, Duncan Cameron, left him a Macmillan book by Michael Foster &quot;Physiology Primer&quot;. This book, he wrote in his autobiographical notes, &quot;That little book was to me what the light from heaven was to St. Paul. It set my face towards natural science.&quot; He regretted that he never got to know Michael Foster, &quot;but throughout the rest of my life I have thought of him with the gratitude of a disciple, for his Primer and for his Textbook of Physiology which I got as soon as I had mastered his Primer. Its philosophical spirit impressed me very deeply.&quot;

Another friend he made in Purulia was Lieut.-Col. J. J. Wood, then deputy sanitary commissioner there. Wood invited him to the study of botany, natural history and chemistry. During this time Alcock even dug graves to study the bodies of humans. He studied bones using Holden&#x27;s Osteology – &quot;Thence I crept on by means of a Nicholson&#x27;s &#x27; Manual of Zoology &#x27; to the &quot;Descent of Man&quot; and the &#x27; &quot;Origin of Species&quot;.&#x27; I was now resolved to be a doctor, but I could not think how it was to come to pass.&quot;

In 1880 he took up a post as assistant master in a European boys school at Darjeeling. Here Colonel Wood left his son under the tutelage of Alcock. In 1881 Alcock&#x27;s elder sister moved to India as her husband was a distinguished officer in the Indian Civil Service. Alcock was then able to sail home to begin his medical training. He found Aberdeen University economical and entered Marischal College in October, 1881. In the first year he took the medal in Henry Alleyne Nicholson&#x27;s class of Natural History. Even when &quot;unqualified&quot; he served as house surgeon in the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. In 1885 he graduated M.B., C.M., &quot;with honourable distinction&quot; and joined the Indian Medical Service.

Alcock sailed to India in 1886 and served in the north-west frontier with Sikh regiment and Punjab regiments. In Baluchistan he dealt with his first case of a fatal snake bite from an &quot;Echis carinatus&quot;. In 1888 he became Surgeon-Naturalist to the Indian Marine Survey on the survey ship &quot;Investigator&quot;. Here he studied marine zoology and he published many papers along with the zoologist James Wood-Mason and others. He wrote about these years in &quot;A Naturalist in Indian Seas&quot; (1902) which is considered a classic in natural history travel.

In 1892 Alcock resigned (having attained the rank of major) and became Deputy Sanitary Commissioner for Eastern Bengal. In 1893 Wood-Mason went home and Alcock agreed to act for him during his absence. Wood-Mason died on his way to England and Alcock was appointed as the superintendent of the Indian Museum. In 1895–96 he was on the Pamis Boundary Commission and wrote the Natural History results of this expedition. At the Indian Museum, Alcock worked on improving the public galleries of Reptiles, Fishes and Invertebrates. Sir George King, who was the chairman of the trustees, supported him; however, after his retirement, Alcock was given little support. Lord Curzon decided to exhibit the collections of the Indian Museum as a memorial to Queen Victoria in 1903 and Alcock was ordered to &quot;vacate the gallery of Fishes at a moment&#x27;s notice.&quot; Alcock protested to the trustees that &quot;it would be disgraceful to dismantle a gallery of Invertebrates which included an exhibit of the recent mosquito-malaria discoveries, at a moment when those discoveries seemed at last to have driven into the thickest British skull the great truth that the study of zoology was of some use to mankind.&quot; The gallery was spared but the library was to be cleared. These experiences caused Alcock to quit and he returned home in 1906 writing to the Government &quot;telling him what an impossible post the Superintendentship of the Museum was and begging him to get it improved for the sake of the Science of Zoology and of my successors.&quot; In the letter Alcock wrote that Zoology was &quot;a branch of pure science pregnant with human interest&quot;, important to the state &quot;in matters of education, in matters agricultural and veterinary, and in the vital matter of public health.&quot; He suggested the establishment of &quot;an Indian Zoological Survey&quot; with a museum and laboratory administered by zoologists along the lines of the Geological and Botanical Surveys.

He was asked to withdraw his resignation and rejoin with promises of reform at the Indian Museum, however he wrote that &quot;I stuck to my resolve that if the position at the Indian Museum was to be improved by my efforts no cynical potentate at Simla should ever say that I had got it altered for my own benefit.&quot;

Back in London he made acquaintance with Sir Patrick Manson, who he had known since student days. He began to work on tropical medicine at the School of Tropical Medicine at the Albert Dock Seamen&#x27;s Hospital, Albert Dock.

Alcock was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1901. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in the 1903 Durbar Honours, and received the Barclay Medal from the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1907.

In 1897 he married Margaret Forbes Cornwall, of Aberdeen.

==Achievements==
Alcock was primarily a systematist, describing a wide range of species. He worked on aspects of biology and physiology of fishes, their distributions, evolution and behaviour. Some of his works were published in &quot;Zoological Gleanings from the R.I.M.S. &#x27; Investigator,&#x27; &quot; published in &quot; Scientific Memoirs by Medical Officers of the Army of India,&quot; Part XII, Simla, 1901.

He worked on Fishes, Decapod Crustacea, and Deep Sea Madreporarian Corals. He published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the Annals and Magazine of Natural History as well as catalogues published by the Indian Museum. His &quot;Illustrations of the Zoology of the R.I.M.S. &#x27; Investigator,&#x27; &quot;, a series with illustrations by Indian artists (mainly A. C. Chowdhary and S. C. Mondul) has been considered as exceptional in beauty and accuracy.

Alcock&#x27;s school education of classics and literature led him to write in a Victorian literary style. He specialized in medical entomology, wrote a textbook &quot;Entomology for Medical Officers &quot; (1st edition 1911, 2nd 1920), and worked on a biography of Sir Patrick Manson.

In herpetology, Alcock described five new species of reptiles, some in collaboration with the English ornithologist Frank Finn.

<text>Cape Engaño is a cape and northern point of Palaui Island, an island off the northeasternmost point of the island of Luzon in the Philippines. It is administratively part of the municipality of Santa Ana in Cagayan province and is known for its lush green landscape, white sand beach and the Cape Engaño Lighthouse.

It has given its name to the World War II battle off Cape Engaño, part of the larger Battle of Leyte Gulf, although the battle actually took place some 200 miles (322 km) to the east, in open ocean. The Japanese aircraft carriers &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, &quot;Zuihō&quot;, &quot;Chitose&quot; and &quot;Chiyoda&quot; were repeatedly bombarded and sank, as well as three light cruisers and nine destroyers.

<text>Cobscook Bay is located in Washington County in the state of Maine. It opens into Passamaquoddy Bay, within the Bay of Fundy. Cobscook Bay is immediately south of the island city of Eastport, the main island of which (Moose Island) straddles the two bays. In the 1930s, Cobscook Bay was part of the aborted Passamaquoddy Bay Tidal Power Project (a.k.a., &quot;Quoddy Dam Project&quot;) to generate electricity from its large tidal range.

==Geography==
Cobscook Bay is a large bay in Washington County, Maine that opens into Passamaquoddy Bay within the Bay of Fundy through a relatively narrow opening. It is about long and 10 wide and has a long, convoluted coastline with many islands. The mouth of the bay is bracketed by the island city of Eastport, which is principally on Moose Island, and by the town of Lubec. Other townships around the bay are Perry, Pembroke, Dennysville, Edmunds, and Tresscott. There are about 7,000 people living in the nine communities in the area, many of whom are fishermen or work in fish farming, shipping or tourism. There is a scallop fishery here.

The bay is both geologically and hydrologically complex. The tide has an average range of (and range that can exceed 26 feet) and there are strong currents as large volumes of sea water flow into and out of the bay twice a day. The bay is very shallow with the average depth being about and about one third of its area is exposed at low water. The volume of freshwater entering from streams is relatively small and the nutrient rich waters support a great diversity of phytoplankton and algae. These support a biodiverse community of fish, shellfish, marine worms and other invertebrates. Many birds feed on these and the bay is an important visiting place for migrating birds and waterfowl.

The area surrounding the bay is well-timbered, but as well as forests there are streams, lakes, bogs, marshes and mudflats interspersed by a network of trails. Cobscook Bay State Park takes up part of the shore of the bay.

==History==

Communities around the bay were traditionally involved in shipbuilding, logging, farming, fishing and trading.

In 1935, a proposal by FDR friend and engineer Dexter Cooper to build a barrage to harness the power of the tides in the area was inititiated. The Quoddy Dam Project was envisaged to impound the waters of Cobscook Bay and the adjoining Passamaquoddy Bay. Construction was started and some dikes were built, but a year later, the United States Congress withdrew its support and funding and the scheme was abandoned. The Quoddy Dam Model Museum at Eastport preserves a large model of the project.

The generation of electricity from the bay&#x27;s tidal currents was ultimately accomplished in September 2012 by Ocean Renewable Power Company. A turbine was installed in Cobscook Bay at the boundary of Eastport and Lubec capable of generating 180 kW of electricity, and was the first North American commercial tidal energy project to supply power to the electrical grid. The turbines did not need dams to function and were mounted on the sea bed. The turbine blades spin slowly in the current and testing seems to indicate they are harmless to marine life. Two more turbines were planned for installation in the bay within a year&#x27;s time.

==Ecology==
This coastal area is home to many resident birds. One of these is the bald eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;) and Cobscook Bay has more pairs of these rare birds per square mile than the rest of Maine. It also houses 25% of the state&#x27;s black duck (&quot;Anas rubripes&quot;) population. In the fall, the bay is used by large numbers of birds migrating southwards from their summer breeding grounds. Rare species of bird to be seen here include the harlequin duck (&quot;Histrionicus histrionicus&quot;). An invertebrate of special concern is the mystery snail (&quot;Vertigo paradoxa&quot;), an air-breathing land snail. In the summer several species of whale enter the bay, including the minke, fin whale and right whale.

==Conservation==
Efforts are being made to preserve the biodiversity of the bay. A buffer zone has been created adjacent to the foreshore where no development is allowed. The alewife &quot;(Alosa pseudoharengus)&quot; is a species of anadromous fish which goes upstream to spawn. Efforts are being made to enable these fish to reach their traditional spawning grounds in the upper waters of the Pennamaquan River, Little River and Boyden Stream. These fish are thought to be important in the bay&#x27;s ecosystem by providing food for the eagles.

==Other uses of the name==
&quot;Cobscook Bay&quot; is also the title of a song by The Mountain Goats from their EP &quot;Isopanisad Radio Hour.&quot;

<text>John Anderson (4 October 1833 – 15 August 1900) was a Scottish anatomist and zoologist who worked in India as the curator of the Indian Museum, Calcutta.

== Early life ==
Anderson was born in Edinburgh, the second son of Thomas Anderson, who worked in the National Bank of Scotland, and his wife Jane Cleghorn. He took an interest in natural history at an early age as did his brother Thomas Anderson, who worked at the Royal Botanic Garden in Calcutta from 1861 to 1863. He went to school at George Square Academy and Hill Street Institution before joining work at the Bank of Scotland. He left the bank to study medicine, and graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1861. He studied anatomy under John Goodsir and received his MD in 1862 with a gold medal for his thesis in zoology. He was also associated with the founding of the Royal Physical Society which grew out of the Wernerian Society over which he presided. He was appointed to the chair of natural history in the Free Church College in Edinburgh and worked there for the next two years. During this period he studied marine organisms based on dredging off the coast of Scotland, and published notes in the &quot;Annals and Magazine of Natural History&quot;.

He married Grace Scott Thoms, daughter of Patrick Hunter Thoms of Aberlemno, Forfar.

== India ==

Anderson moved to India in 1864 to take up the position as the first curator of the Indian Museum at Calcutta in 1865. He catalogued the mammal and archaeological collections. He held the position of curator until 1887, when he was succeeded by James Wood-Mason and made superintendent of the museum. He made several collection expeditions to China and Burma. In 1867 he accompanied Colonel Edward Bosc Sladen as a naturalist on an expedition to Upper Burma and Yunnan. This expedition allowed him to collect the Irrawaddy dolphin, &quot;Orcaella brevirostris&quot; and compared with &quot;Orcaella fluminalis&quot; and the Gangetic dolphin, &quot;Plantanista gangetica&quot;. In 1875–6, he travelled to the same area under Colonel Horace Browne. This was cut short due to the murder of the consular officer Augustus Raymond Margary. Anderson made a third expedition for the Indian Museum in 1881–2 to the Mergui archipelago, Burma.

Anderson made comparative studies of anatomy of the species that he collected. He worked on reptiles, birds as well as mammals such as of the genus &quot;Hylomys&quot;. He also wrote on the ethnology of the Selungs of the Mergui archipelago. Many of the plant specimens that he collected are at Calcutta, Kew and the Natural History Museum, London. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1879 and was made honorary LLD of the University of Edinburgh in 1885. During the time that he held the office of superintendent of the Calcutta museum he also served as professor of comparative anatomy at the medical school in Calcutta. He and his wife Gracei travelled to Japan in 1884, forming an extensive collection of Ainu artefacts, which was donated to the British Museum and the National Museum of Scotland.

== Return to Britain ==
He retired from service in India in 1886 just a few years after his marriage. He later made extensive zoological collections in Egypt, forming the basis of his &quot;Zoology of Egypt&quot;. He died in Buxton, England and was survived by his wife Grace Scott Thoms. They are buried together on the south side of Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh. The portrait head was sculpted by David Watson Stevenson.

== Taxon named in his honor ==
*&quot;Sacculina andersoni&quot; , a parasitic barnacle.
*&quot;Japalura andersoniana&quot; , a lizard
*&quot;Opisthotropis andersonii&quot; , a snake
*&quot;Trimeresurus andersonii&quot; , a venomous snake
*&quot;Glaridoglanis andersonii&quot; , a catfish that inhabits the Irrawaddy drainage, Myanmar and China. It has also been recorded from the Brahmaputra drainage in China.

<text>were a five-piece all-girl pop/rock band from Kitami, Hokkaido, Japan. Although not reaching the cult status they enjoyed at home, the group gained a loyal following abroad with their recordings and live performances.

==History==
The band - vocalist Yuki Maeda, guitarist Aya Inatsuki, bassist Yukari Hasegawa, keyboardist Rimi Mizusawa, and drummer Erika Kawamura - formed in 1994 while the members - all lifelong friends, while Maeda and Kawamura were also cousins - were in elementary school. A few years and a string of local performances later, the group came to the notice of members of popular Japanese rock band Judy and Mary and were offered a recording deal with Sony Japan&#x27;s Pop Artist imprint in 1999.

The group, still in high school at the time, recorded and released their first EP After School, which they quickly followed up with several singles, all original material with the exception of their fourth, a cover of the Jitterin&#x27; Jinn hit &quot;Natsu Matsuri&quot;. The single became the band&#x27;s most popular number and is now more identified with them than with the original group. Capitalizing on the momentum, the group completed and released their debut full-length album, &quot;Hatsu&quot;. 

After a fifth single, &quot;Akubi&quot; (a rearranged new recording of a song from their EP), the group divided their time between completing their high school education and working on the follow-up album, &quot;Chameleon&quot;. The record&#x27;s release was preceded by three new singles, &quot;Sakura Nakimichi&quot;, &quot;Kakurenbo&quot; (which was tied into the Japanese release of an opening of the anime Pokémon), and &quot;Tachiiri Kinshi&quot;. The latter song, whose title translates to &quot;Off Limits&quot;, raised quite a few eyebrows with its uncharacteristic aggressiveness and its music video which depicted the band in rugby uniforms, bumrushing a corporate boardroom and performing their song atop a conference table while businessmen looked on in horror. 

&quot;Chameleon&quot; was released in January 2002 and was complimented by reviewers as being a superior follow up to &quot;Hatsu&quot;. Whiteberry featured some darker-themed songs on the album, a contrast from some of the overtly happy material they had done before.

After a short tour behind the album, the group began to finish their final year of high school, in the meantime releasing a trilogy of three singles in late 2002 that featured a cover version of a favorite classic J-Pop or J-Rock hit on the A-side and a new Whiteberry original on the B-side. The first of these, &quot;Jitensha Dorobou&quot;, was accompanied by a fully animated video.

Whiteberry spent most of 2003 off the road and out of the studio as their education took precedence, but were commissioned to record two songs for the soundtrack album to the TV series Superior Defender Gundam Force. Both songs were released as a single in February 2004; the A-side, &quot;Shinjiru Chikara&quot;, featured lyrics written by all five group members stating how much they missed each other after the graduation of the band members from high school and the decision of some members to attend college. A week after the single was released, the group issued a statement announcing that after ten years together, they were amicably disbanding the group because of Aya, Yukari, Rimi, and Erika&#x27;s college commitments. The group played tearful farewell shows in Tokyo and their native Hokkaidō in late March 2004. A posthumous anthology, &quot;Kiseki&quot;, was released in May 2002, and a DVD counterpart, &quot;Videoberry Final&quot;, followed the month afterward. 

Yuki Maeda and Yukari Hasegawa re-emerged in 2006 with a new four-piece pop/punk band, Yukki; the quartet released a five-song EP, &quot;Sotsugyou&quot;, in May 2006 on the Japanese independent label Deadgirls. 

As of December 2007 Yuki finished with &quot;yukki&quot; solo artist works. In April 2008 she formed a new band, &quot;THE HUSKY&quot;. Yukari &amp; Rimi now live in Tokyo, whereas Aya &amp; Erika live in Kitami City, Hokkaido.

<doc id="880938" wikidata="Q733404" url="?curid=880938" title="Erasmo of Narni">
<text>Erasmo Stefano of Narni (1370 – 16 January 1443), better known by his nickname of Gattamelata (meaning &quot;Honeyed Cat&quot;), was an Italian &quot;condottiero&quot; of the Renaissance. He was born in Narni, and served a number of Italian city-states: he began with Braccio da Montone, served the Papal States and Florence, as well as the Republic of Venice in 1434 in the battles with the Visconti of Milan.

He was the subject of Donatello&#x27;s equestrian bronze sculpture in the main square of Padua, the same city over which he became podestà in 1437.

In Narni, the farmhouse in which Gattamelata was born bears a plaque reading &quot;Narnia me genuit Gattamelata fui&quot; (&quot;I was born in Narni, I was Gattamelata&quot;).

==Biography==
Erasmo of Narni was born in Narni, in Umbria, into a poor family. His station in life led him to the military, initially under the Assisi lord Cecchino Broglia. Later, together with his friend Brandolino Brandolini, he served under Braccio da Montone, one of the leading Italian &quot;condottieri&quot; of the 15th century, lord of Perugia from 1416.

With Braccio, he participated in the conquest of Todi, Rieti, Narni, Terni and Spoleto, and, in 1419, in the battle of Viterbo against Muzio Attendolo. At the War of L&#x27;Aquila (June 1424), Braccio&#x27;s army was utterly defeated, and the condottiero himself killed; Erasmo led the remaining troops into the service of the Republic of Florence. In 1427 Pope Martin V hired him to regain the lands captured by Braccio da Montone. Città di Castello fell in 1428, but Erasmo had moved to the northern Papal States to counter the rebellion of Imola, Forlì and Bologna. He entered the latter in 1431 as the General Captain of the Papal States, and he also suppressed Antonio Ordelaffi&#x27;s rebellion in Forlì.

Mostly because of his discontent with late wages, Erasmo abandoned the Papal services in 1434. He was subsequently hired by the Republic of Venice. In the course of the war against the Filippo Maria Visconti of Milan, he defended Bologna and fought against Niccolò Piccinino. The latter defeated him at Castelbolognese on 28 August 1434, in a battle in which Gattamelata was wounded. After a series of clashes and counter-manoeuvers, often lost by the anti-Visconti league (Gattamelata&#x27;s side), he successfully defended Brescia and Verona in 1438. For this he was granted the title of General Commander of the armies of the Republic of Venice. However, the following year the Venetians lost numerous cities, including Legnago, Soave and finally Verona itself. This defeat led to strong criticism of Gattamelata. The Venetian Republic then called on Francesco Sforza to fight alongside Gattamelata, and the two re-entered Verona on 9 July 1439.

In 1440, while mustering a flotilla on Lake Garda, Gattamelata was struck down by a cerebral haemorrhage. He never fully recovered, nor led further substantial military campaigns. He died at Padua in 1443.

== Personal life ==
Erasmo&#x27;s daughter Polissena Romagnola married Tiberto Brandolini, the son of his best friend Brandolino Brandolini of Bagnacavallo, a descendant of the lords of Brandenburgh, and Giovanna dei Signori della Tela. Polissena and Tiberto had two sons Sigismondo and Leonello. Therefore, the counts of Brandolini d&#x27;Adda appear to be the only known descendants of Erasmo of Narni. On the 8th of February 1458, Sigismondo married Antonia, daughter of Annibale Bentivoglio. His second marriage was to Margherita Scotti, which showed that Sigismondo was a sufficiently important personality to be able to form an alliance with the most notable family in Piacenza.

<text>Expedition 5 was the fifth long-duration stay on the International Space Station (ISS). The crew, consisting of three people, remained in space for 184 days, 178 of which were spent aboard the ISS. Expedition 5 was a continuation of an uninterrupted human presence in space, as of November 2022, which was begun by Expedition 1 in 2000–2001.

The crew of Expedition 5 launched to space aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; aboard the STS-111 mission on 5 June 2002. Their tenure aboard the station, however, did not begin until they docked with the ISS two days later on 7 June.

The Expedition 5 crew took charge of ISS operations on 7 June 2002. An official ceremony between expedition crews took place 10 June, with the ceremonial ringing of the station&#x27;s brass bell, symbolizing the transfer of command. The Expedition Five crew carried out approximately 25 new investigations on board the ISS, as well as continued with various science investigations begun before their stay. The crew wrapped up a 184-day stay in space when they returned home on STS-113 7 December 2002.

Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; delivered the Expedition 5 crew during mission STS-111, which launched 5 June 2002. The fifth crew to live aboard the International Space Station was led by Russian Valery Korzun and joined by fellow cosmonaut Sergey Treshchev and U.S. astronaut Peggy A. Whitson, both flight engineers. While on board, Dr. Whitson was named NASA&#x27;s first ISS science officer by NASA administrator O&#x27;Keefe.

== Spacewalks ==
The Expedition Five crewmembers conducted two spacewalks during their stay at the International Space Station. Both were based out of the &quot;Pirs&quot; Docking Compartment and used Russian Orlan space suits.

<doc id="880956" wikidata="Q4657189" url="?curid=880956" title="A Grief Observed">
<text>A Grief Observed is a collection of C. S. Lewis&#x27;s reflections on his experience of bereavement following the death of his wife, Joy Davidman, in 1960. The book was published in 1961 under the pseudonym N.W. Clerk because Lewis wished to avoid the connection. Though republished in 1963 under his own name after his death, the text still refers to his wife as “H” (her seldom used first name was Helen).

The book is compiled from the four notebooks used by Lewis to vent and explore his grief. He illustrates the everyday trials of life without Joy and explores fundamental questions of faith and theodicy. Lewis&#x27; stepson (Joy&#x27;s son) Douglas Gresham pointed out in his 1994 introduction that the indefinite article &#x27;a&#x27; in the title makes it clear that Lewis&#x27; grief is not the quintessential experience of the loss of a loved one but just one individual&#x27;s perspective among countless others.

The book helped inspire a 1985 television movie, &quot;Shadowlands&quot;, as well as a 1993 film of the same name.

==Summary==
&quot;A Grief Observed&quot; explores the processes undergone by the human brain and mind over the course of grieving. The book questions the nature of grief and whether or not returning to normality afterward is even possible within the realm of human existence on earth. Based on a personal journal that he kept, Lewis refers to his wife as &quot;H&quot; throughout the series of reflections, and he reveals that she had died from cancer only three years after their marriage.

Extremely candid, the book details the anger and bewilderment that he felt towards God after H&#x27;s death as well as his impressions of life without her. The period of his bereavement was marked by a process of moving in and out of various stages of grief and remembrance, and it becomes obvious that it heavily influenced his spirituality.

In fact, Lewis ultimately comes to a revolutionary redefinition of his own characterization of God: experiencing gratitude for having received and experienced the gift of a true love.

The book is divided into four parts. Each is headed with a Roman numeral and has a collection of excerpts from his journals documenting scattered impressions and his continuously-evolving state of mind.

==Reactions==
Lewis exhibits doubt and asks many fundamental questions of faith throughout the work. Because of his candid account of his grief and the doubts he voices, some of his admirers found it troubling. They were disinclined to believe that the Christian writer could be so close to despair. Some thought that it might be a work of fiction. Others, such as his critics, suggested that he was wisest when he was overcome with despair.

When Lewis was first attempting to publish his manuscript, his literary agent, Spencer Curtis Brown, sent it to the publishing company Faber and Faber. One of the directors of the company at the time was T.S. Eliot, who found the book intensely moving.

Madeleine L’Engle, an American author best known for her young adult fiction, wrote a foreword for the 1989 printing of the book. In the foreword, she speaks of her own grief after losing her husband and notes the similarities and differences. She makes a point similar to Douglas Gresham&#x27;s: each grief is different, even if they bear similarities.

==Relation to other works==
The book is often compared to another book by Lewis, &quot;The Problem of Pain&quot;, written approximately twenty years before &quot;A Grief Observed&quot;.

&quot;The Problem of Pain&quot; seeks to provide theory behind the pain in the world. &quot;A Grief Observed&quot; is the reality of the theory in the former book.

It was more difficult to apply the theories that he posited to a pain with which he was so intimately involved. At first, it is hard for Lewis to see the reason of his theories during the anguish of his wife&#x27;s death but throughout the book, the gradual reacceptance of his theories and the reacceptance of the necessity of suffering can be seen.

Lewis&#x27; difficulty is specifically reflected in the following passage from the book: &quot;Is anything more certain than that in all those vast times and spaces, if I were allowed to search them, I should nowhere find her face, her voice, her touch? She died. She is dead. Is the word so difficult to learn?&quot;

Also, Lewis&#x27; ultimate resolution of his dilemma is partly articulated in the book: &quot;I will not, if I can help it, shin up either the feathery or the prickly tree. Two widely different convictions press more and more on my mind. One is that the Eternal Vet is even more inexorable and the possible operations even more painful than our severest imaginings can forebode. But the other, that &#x27;all shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well&#x27;&quot;.

<text>Olive is a dark yellowish-green color, like that of unripe or green olives.

As a color word in the English language, it appears in late Middle English.

== Variations ==

=== Olivine ===
Olivine is the typical color of the mineral olivine.

The first recorded use of &quot;olivine&quot; as a color name in English was in 1912.
=== Olive drab === 

Olive drab is variously described as a &quot;A brownish-green colour&quot; (&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;); &quot;a shade of greenish-brown&quot; (&quot;Webster&#x27;s New World Dictionary&quot;); &quot;a dark gray-green&quot; (&quot;MacMillan English dictionary&quot;); &quot;a grayish olive to dark olive brown or olive gray&quot; (&quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot;); or &quot;A dull but fairly strong gray-green color&quot; (&quot;Collins English Dictionary&quot;). It is widely used as a camouflage color for uniforms and equipment in the armed forces.

The first recorded use of &quot;olive drab&quot; as a color name in English was in 1892. Drab is an older color name, from the middle of the 16th century. It refers to a dull light brown color, the color of cloth made from undyed homespun wool. It took its name from the old French word for cloth, &quot;drap&quot;.

There are many shades and variations of olive drab. Various shades were used on United States Army uniforms in World War II. The shade used for enlisted soldier&#x27;s uniforms at the beginning of the war was officially called &quot;Olive Drab #33&quot; (OD33), while officer&#x27;s uniforms used the much darker &quot;Olive Drab #51&quot; (OD51). Field equipment was in &quot;Olive Drab #3&quot; (OD3), a very light, almost khaki shade. In 1943 new field uniforms and equipment were produced in the darker &quot;Olive Drab #7&quot; (OD7). This was in turn replaced by the slightly grayer &quot;Olive Green 107&quot; (OG-107) in 1952, which continued as the color of combat uniforms through the Vietnam War until the adoption in 1981 of the four-color-camouflage-patterned M81 Battle Dress Uniform, which retained olive drab as one of the color swatches in the pattern. The shade used for painting vehicles is defined by Federal Standard 595 in the United States.

As a solid color, it is not as effective for camouflage as multi-color patterns, though it is still used by the U.S. military to color webbing and accessories. The armies of Israel, India, Cuba, and Venezuela wear solid-color olive drab uniforms.

In the American novel &quot;A Separate Peace&quot;, Finny says to Gene, &quot;...and in these times of war, we all see olive drab, and we all know it is the patriotic color. All others aren&#x27;t about the war; they aren&#x27;t patriotic.&quot;

Pantone 448 C, &quot;the ugliest color in the world&quot; commonly used in plain tobacco packaging, was initially described as a shade of olive green.

=== Black olive ===

Black olive is a color in the RAL color matching system. It is designated as RAL 6015.

The color &quot;black olive&quot; is a representation of the color of black olives.

== Olive in culture ==
Ethnography
* The term &quot;olive-skinned&quot; is sometimes used to denote shades of medium-toned skin that is darker than the average color for White people, especially in connection with a Mediterranean ethnicity.

<text>Expedition 4 was the fourth expedition to the International Space Station (7 December 2001 – 15 June 2002).

==Crew==

==Mission parameters==
*Perigee: 384 km
*Apogee: 396 km
*Inclination: 51.6°
*Period: 92 min

==Mission objectives==
The International Space Station expanded its science investigations, almost doubling the previous amount of experiments performed during the Expedition Four mission. The fourth resident crew launched on 5 December 2001 on board Space Shuttle Endeavour during mission STS-108. They became official station residents at 20:03 UTC on 7 December 2001, and remained on board until June 2002, when they landed on STS-111.

An international crew of three were the fourth crew to live aboard the International Space Station. The team was led by Russian Yuri I. Onufrienko and joined by American crewmates Daniel W. Bursch and Carl E. Walz, both flight engineers. As a part of the STS-108 mission, Endeavour delivered the Expedition 4 crew to the station. They returned to Earth 19 June 2002, aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour following the STS-111 mission.

==Spacewalks==
The Expedition Four crew conducted three spacewalks during its stay on board the International Space Station. The crew spent a total of 17 hours and 51 minutes outside the station. These spacewalks brought the total up to 34—nine station-based and 25 shuttle-based—that have been conducted at the station for total of 208 hours and 5 minutes.

<doc id="880980" wikidata="Q730310" url="?curid=880980" title="Nathaniel Wallich">
<text>Nathaniel Wolff Wallich (28 January 1786 – 28 April 1854) was a surgeon and botanist of Danish origin who worked in India, initially in the Danish settlement near Calcutta and later for the Danish East India Company and the British East India Company. He was involved in the early development of the Calcutta Botanical Garden, describing many new plant species and developing a large herbarium collection which was distributed to collections in Europe. Several of the plants that he collected were named after him.

==Early life and education==

Nathaniel Wallich was born in Copenhagen in 1786 as Nathan Wulff Wallich. His father Wulff Lazarus Wallich (1756–1843) was a Sephardic Jewish merchant originally from the Holsatian town Altona near Hamburg, who settled in Copenhagen late in the 18th century. His mother was Hanne née Jacobson (1757–1839).

Wallich attended the Royal Academy of Surgeons in Copenhagen, where his professors trained in the botanical science included Erik Viborg, Martin Vahl, Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher and Jens Wilken Hornemann. He obtained the diploma from the Academy in 1806, and at the end of the year was appointed as surgeon in the Danish settlement at Serampore, then known as &quot;Frederiksnagore&quot; in Bengal.

==Career==
Wallich sailed for India in April 1807 via the African cape and arrived at Serampore the following November. However, the Danish alliance with Napoleonic France resulted in many Danish colonies being seized by the British, including the outpost at Frederiksnagore. When the British East India Company took over Frederiksnagore, Wallich was imprisoned, but released on parole in 1809 on the merit of his scholarship.

===Service in East India Company===

From August 1814, Wallich became an assistant surgeon in the East India Company&#x27;s service and resigned as superintendent of the Indian Museum in December 1814. 

===First curator of Indian Museum===

Wallich proposed the forming of a museum in a letter dated 2 February 1814 to the Council of the Asiatic Society. Wallich offered his services to the society and some items from his own collections for the museum. The society heartily supported the proposal and resolved to set up a museum and to appoint Wallich to be the honorary curator and then superintendent of the Oriental Museum of the Asiatic Society. Dr. Nathaniel Wallich took charge of the museum on 1 June 1814. The museum thus inaugurated, grew rapidly under the guidance of its founder Wallich and private collectors. Most of these private contributors were Europeans except for one Indian, Babu Ramkamal Sen, initially a collector and later the first Indian secretary to the Asiatic Society. Wallich was not only the enthusiastic founder and the first curator the Indian Museum, he was one of the largest donors to the museum at its inception. Out of one hundred seventy four items donated to the museum till 1816, Wallich donated forty-two botanical specimens.

=== Royal Botanical Garden, Calcutta ===

Wallich was also temporarily appointed superintendent of the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta, and later permanently joined the garden in 1817, and served there until 1846, when he retired from the service. Ill health forced Wallich to spend the years 1811–1813 in the more temperate climate of Mauritius, whence he continued his studies. In 1822, at the behest of his friend Sir Stamford Raffles he travelled to Singapore to design the botanical garden, but returned to Calcutta the following year.

Wallich prepared a catalogue of more than 20,000 specimens, known informally as the &quot;Wallich Catalogue&quot;. The specimens in the catalogue were either collected by Wallich himself or from other collectors around the same period, including Roxburgh, Gomez, Griffith and Wight. The collector of each specimen is clearly cited in the catalogue itself. Today, Wallich&#x27;s personal collection is housed at the Kew Herbarium as the Wallich Collection. In addition to the specimens there, Wallich also distributed duplicates of his specimens to herbaria, including some to Sir Joseph Banks, which are in the Kew general collection.

He published two books, &quot;Tentamen Florae Nepalensis Illustratae&quot; and &quot;Plantae Asiaticae Rariores&quot;, and went on numerous expeditions. One of Wallich&#x27;s greatest contributions to the field of plant exploration was the assistance he regularly offered to the many plant hunters who stopped in Calcutta on their way to the Himalayas.

The three volumes of &quot;Plantae Asiaticae Rariores&quot; made use of artists employed by the Calcutta Botanic Garden: 146 drawings by Gorachand, 109 by Vishnupersaud and one work by Rungiah (the artist employed by Robert Wight); the rest of the plates were by John Clark and three by William Griffith. Two hundred and fifty copies of the work were printed, of which 40 were purchased by the East India Company.

=== Scholarly distinctions ===
Wallich received an M.D. from Aberdeen in 1819. Wallich was later appointed assistant to William Roxburgh, the East India Company&#x27;s botanist in Calcutta. By 1813 he had become interested in the flora of India, and undertook expeditions to Nepal, West Hindustan, and lower Burma. During 1837 and 1838, Nathaniel Wallich served as professor of botany at Calcutta Medical College. Two years later in 1821, he was coferred the degree of honorary doctor at the University of Copenhagen and in 1826, elected member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters. Wallich became a freemason early in his Calcutta life.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1822 his proposer being John Yule. This was followed in 1828 by his being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.

===Retirement, death, and legacy===

Wallich had suffered deteriorating health for many years, at one time contracting cholera, and he was finally obliged to resign his post in 1846 and retire to London, where he became vice-president of the Linnean Society, of which he had been a fellow since 1818. 

Wallich remained in London until his death seven years later. He died at Gower Street in Bloomsbury on 28 April 1854 aged 68. He was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

Part of Wallich&#x27;s herbarium collections held at Kew, and known as the Wallich Herbarium, is the largest separate herbarium. Another part of the collection is the Central National Herbarium of the Botanical Survey of India in Calcutta, making in all about 20,500 specimens. Wallich is also credited with the authorship of 35 papers, mostly botanical. 

===Family===
Wallich&#x27;s was the maternal uncle of the Danish zoologist Theodore Cantor. Wallich married Juliane Marie Hals (born 1797), later known as Mary Ann, on 30 May 1812, but she died only two months later. In 1815, Wallich married Sophia Collings (1797–1876). Together, they had seven children, two of whom died in infancy. Their eldest son George Charles became a distinguished oceanographer.

<text>Salmon is a warm color ranging from light orange to pink, named after the color of salmon flesh.

The first recorded use of &quot;salmon&quot; as a color name in English was in 1776.

The actual color of salmon flesh varies from almost white to light orange, depending on their levels of the carotenoid astaxanthin, which in turn is the result of the richness of the fish&#x27;s diet of krill and shrimp; salmon raised on fish farms are given non-synthetic or artificial coloring in their food.

The flesh of Atlantic salmon (&quot;Salmo salar&quot;) is lighter and oranger than that of the various Pacific salmon species (from the genus &quot;Oncorhynchus&quot;).


==Variations of salmon==


Salmon pink (or &quot;salmon&quot; in Crayola crayons) was introduced by Crayola in 1949. See the List of Crayola crayon colors.

Light salmon has a yellower hue and less saturation when compared to &quot;salmon&quot;.

Dark salmon resembles the color &quot;light salmon&quot;, but is grayer. Like the web colors shown above, it is used in HTML and CSS.

Terra cotta is a tone with relatively low brightness. It resembles terracotta pottery.

<text>The  ( ; ) – also anglicized as skene-dhu – is a small, single-edged knife () worn as part of traditional Scottish Highland dress. It is now worn tucked into the top of the kilt hose with only the upper portion of the hilt visible. The is normally worn on the same side as the dominant hand.

==Etymology and spelling==
The name comes from the Scottish Gaelic , from &quot;sgian&quot; (&#x27;knife&#x27;) and &quot;dubh&quot; (&#x27;black&#x27;, also with the secondary meaning of &#x27;hidden&#x27;.). 
Although &quot;sgian&quot; is feminine, so that a modern Gael might refer to a black knife as &quot;sgian dhubh&quot;, the term for the ceremonial knife is a set-phrase containing a historical form with blocked lenition. 
Other spellings are found in English, including &quot;skean-dhu&quot; and &quot;skene-dhu&quot;. The Gaelic plural, , is only rarely encountered in English.

==Origins==

The may have evolved from the , a dagger that could be concealed under the armpit. Used by the Scots of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, this knife was slightly larger than the average modern and was carried in the upper sleeve or lining of the body of the jacket.

Draconian Scots laws introduced by the Scots Privy Council under the Stewart King in the late 1500&#x27;s; intended to reduce honour interclan feuds and duelling included the outlawing of hidden weapons. {Basilikon Doron 1599}. This writ by the Scots King was impossible to enforce North of the Highland Line and so the carrying of weapons continued in the Highlands until the suppression period post Culloden in 1746. Never the less, the transition from the carrying of the last resort weapon (Sgian) may have begun to transition from armpit pocket to top of hose on the leg at this time.
However, codes of Highland courtesy and etiquette would demand that when entering the home of a friend, any concealed weapons would be revealed. It follows that the would be removed from its hiding place and displayed in the stocking top held securely by the garters.

The also resembles the small skinning knife that is part of the typical set of hunting knives. These sets contain a butchering knife with a blade, and a skinner with a blade of about . These knives usually had antler handles, as do many early sgian-dubhs. The larger knife is likely the ancestor of the modern dirk.

The can be seen in portraits of kilted men of the mid-19th century. A portrait by Sir Henry Raeburn of Colonel Alasdair Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry hangs in the National Gallery of Scotland; it shows hanging from his belt on his right hand side a Highland Scottish dirk, and visible at the top of his right stocking what appears to be a nested set of two sgian-dubhs. A similar sgian-dubh is in the collection of The National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland.

==Construction==
The early blades varied in construction, some having a &quot;clipped&quot; (famously found on the Bowie knife) or &quot;drop&quot; point. The &quot;spear-point&quot; tip has now become universal. The earliest known blades, some housed in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, are made from German or Scandinavian steel, which was highly prized by the Highlanders. Scalloped filework on the back of the blade is common on all Scottish knives. A short blade of is typical.

Traditionally the scabbard is made of leather reinforced with wood and fitted with mounts of silver or some other metal which may be cast or engraved with designs ranging from Scottish thistles, Celtic knotwork, or heraldic elements such as a crest. While this makes for more popular and expensive knives, the sheath is hidden from view in the stocking while the is worn. The sheaths of many modern sgian-dubhs are made of plastic mounted with less expensive metal fittings.

Since the modern is worn mainly as a ceremonial item of dress and is usually not employed for cutting food or self-defence, blades are often of a simple construction. These are typically made from stainless steel. The hilts used on many modern sgian-dubhs are made of plastic that has been molded to resemble carved wood and fitted with cast metal mounts and synthetic decorative stones. Some are not even knives at all, but a plastic handle and sheath cast as one piece. Other examples are luxurious and expensive art pieces, with hand-carved ebony or bog wood hilts, sterling silver fittings and may have pommels set with genuine cairngorm stones and blades of Damascus steel or etched with Celtic designs or heraldic motifs.

==Legality==
When worn as part of the national dress of Scotland, the is legal in Scotland, England, and Wales: in Scotland under the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 s. 49(5)(c); in England and Wales under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (s. 139) and the Offensive Weapons Act 1996 (s. 4).

However, the wearing of the is sometimes banned in areas with zero tolerance weapons policies or heightened security concerns. For example, they were banned from a school dance in Scotland, and initially banned for the June 2014 celebration of the Battle of Bannockburn.

Air travellers are now globally required by airport security to put in their checked baggage.

A Montreal piper received a ticket from police for wearing his &quot;sgian-dubh&quot; in public. Police gave Jeff McCarthy a $221 ticket for sporting it in his kilt hose while performing at the McGill University convocation ceremony on 2 November 2016. McCarthy immediately contested the fine and after some delay the ticket was cancelled by The City of Montreal in May 2018, and his knife was returned.

<text>MonarC Entertainment was an American record label formed by Mariah Carey, under Island Records. The name comes from Carey&#x27;s well-documented fascination with butterflies. The only albums released with the Monarc Entertainment logo were &quot;Charmbracelet&quot; and &quot;The Remixes&quot;. In the summer of 2004, Carey reportedly shut down her MonarC label, as her subsequent releases were released under just Island Records alone. The label was founded by Mariah Carey and longtime music business executive Jerry Blair, supported by A&amp;R power player Faith Newman, and radio promotions handled by veteran promoter Rick Hendrix.

<doc id="881005" wikidata="Q705850" url="?curid=881005" title="Liu Binyan">
<text>Liu Binyan (; 7 February 1925 – 5 December 2005) was a Chinese author, journalist, and political dissident.

Many of the events in Liu&#x27;s life are recounted in his memoir, &quot;A Higher Kind of Loyalty&quot;.

==Early life==

Liu Binyan, whose family hails from Shandong province, was born in 1925, in the city of Changchun, Jilin Province. He grew up in Harbin, in Heilongjiang province, where he went to school until the ninth grade, after which he had to withdraw for lack of tuition money. He persisted in reading voraciously, especially works about World War II, and in 1944, he joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). After 1949 he worked as a reporter and editor for China Youth News and began a long career of writing rooted in an iron devotion to social ideals, an affection for China&#x27;s ordinary people, and an insistence on honest expression even at the cost of great personal sacrifice.

==Outspoken Critic in Early Years of PRC==
Liu Binyan published influential critiques of the consequences of Party management in the 1950s. In rapid succession he encountered recognition, approval, criticism, and finally prosecution for crimes against the Party. In October 1955, he acted as the interpreter for visiting Soviet writer Valentin Ovechkin, who later tried to help Liu Binyan by writing a letter to Zhou Enlai. Liu Binyan learned from Ovechkin&#x27;s style and wrote the work &quot;On the Bridge Worksite&quot;.

===A Pair of Articles with a Big Impact===

In 1956, he published &quot;On the Bridge Worksite&quot; (《在桥梁工地上》 &quot;Zai qiaoliang gongdi shang&quot;), which exposed bureaucratism and corruption, and &quot;The Inside Story of Our Newspaper&quot; ( 《本报内部消息》 &quot;Benbao neibu xiaoxi&quot;), about press control. The two works had a powerful nationwide impact.

According to Liu, &quot;&#x27;On the Bridge Construction Site&#x27; had been the first piece to criticize the Party itself since Mao Zedong had laid down the dictum in 1942 in his &#x27;Talks at the Yan&#x27;an Forum&#x27; that writers should &#x27;extol the bright side of life&#x27; and &#x27;not expose&#x27; the darkness.

===Labeled a &quot;Rightist&quot;===
In 1957, following the publication of &quot;On the Bridge Worksite&quot; and &quot;The Inside Story of Our Newspaper,&quot; Liu was labeled a &quot;rightist&quot; and expelled from the CCP (see Hundred Flowers Campaign). The campaign against Liu Binyan was closely associated with the campaign against another social critic and author, Wang Meng, who had recently published a highly influential work, &quot;A New Arrival at the Organization Department.&quot;

===Interim Years===

After being rehabilitated in the 1960s, he again fell out of favor in 1969, and was condemned to a forced labor detention camp, where he spent eight years. After being rehabilitated again, he built up a sound reputation as a reformer and a corruption watchdog. From 1957 onward, he spent a total of 21 years in and out of labor camps.

==Second Big Impact: &quot;People or Monsters&quot; in 1979==
In 1978, after the &quot;rightist&quot; label was removed, Liu was re-admitted to the CCP but continued, in even starker terms than before, to write &quot;reportage literature&quot; (baogao wenxue) about injustices and the sufferings of ordinary people.

&quot;People or Monsters&quot; (), a literary work about a corrupt official in the northern Chinese province of Heilongjiang named Wang Shouxin, created a sensation when it was published in 1979, and became a central element in the effort in China to reflect on and understand the course of Chinese social development, particularly over the course of the Cultural Revolution.

&quot;People or Monsters&quot; was widely read in China, and was broadly re-distributed following initial publication. &quot;What was powerful about Liu&#x27;s piece was it universality: everyone in China knew people like Wang Shouxin, and it made everyone think of all those who had not been brought to justice.&quot;

&quot;People or Monsters&quot; was the first in a series of works describing corruption and social problems, and was noteworthy for its use of fact-based reporting (reportage) in place of pure fiction.

&quot;Di&#x27;erzhong Zhongcheng&quot;(《第二种忠诚》)[A Second Kind of Loyalty] (1985) and other essays made him a household name among Chinese readers and cemented his reputation as &quot;China&#x27;s conscience.&quot; In 1985, when the Chinese Writers&#x27; Association was allowed (for the first and last time) to elect its own leaders, Liu Binyan received the second-highest number of votes to Ba Jin, the surviving May-Fourth era writer.

==Liu in the United States==
In December 1986, college students demonstrated in over a dozen Chinese cities in order to demand greater economic and political freedoms. Deng Xiaoping, after two straight weeks of student demonstrations, believed that the student movement was a result of &quot;bourgeois liberalization&quot;, and named three CCP members to be expelled, including Fang Lizhi, Liu Binyan, and Wang Ruowang. Deng directed then-CCP General Secretary Hu Yaobang to expel them from the CCP, but Hu refused. Because of his refusal, Hu was dismissed from his position as General Secretary, effectively ending his period of influence within the Chinese government.

In January 1987, as part of Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s crackdown on &quot;bourgeois liberalism,&quot; Liu Binyan was again expelled from the CCP. In spring of 1988 he came to the United States for teaching and writing; then, after publicly denouncing the Chinese government for the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, he was barred from returning to China and never saw his homeland again. Although largely isolated from his Chinese readers, he continued to write about China where his sources often came from interviewing visitors from China.

He published articles critical of Chinese corruption for the Hong Kong media, and offered commentary for the U.S. government funded Radio Free Asia (nonetheless, he was reported to &quot;detest American capitalism&quot; and expressed dismay at a certain Chinese dissident&#x27;s support for the Iraq war). Until the end, he remained an adherent of socialism with a human face, was critical of social inequality and consumerist cynicism in China, and stressed that the CCP, which he had joined as a youth, had many positive achievements before the Maoist crimes and its transformation into the &quot;foul, reactionary force&quot; that it was today.

He died in East Windsor, New Jersey in December 2005, from complications due to colon cancer. He was survived by his wife, Zhu Hong.

<text>The genus Fringilla is a small group of finches from the Old World, which are the only species in the subfamily Fringillinae.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Fringilla&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The genus name &quot;Fringilla&quot; is Latin for &quot;finch&quot;. Linnaeus included 30 species in the genus (&quot;Fringilla zena&quot; was listed twice) and of these the Eurasian chaffinch (&quot;Fringilla coelebs&quot;) is considered as the type species.

===Species===
The genus now contains eight species:
The Eurasian chaffinch is found primarily in forest habitats, in Europe, North Africa, and western Asia; the blue chaffinches are island endemics; and the brambling breeds in the northern taiga and southern tundra of Eurasia.

The eight species are about the same size, in length, and are similar in shape. They have a bouncing flight with alternating bouts of flapping and gliding on closed wings. They are not as specialised as other finches, eating both insects and seeds. While breeding, they feed their young on insects rather than seeds, unlike other finches.

In 2016, it was proposed that the extremely rare Gran Canaria subspecies &quot;F. teydea polatzeki&quot; be treated as a separate species, thus creating a fourth species, &quot;F. polatzeki&quot;.

<doc id="881013" wikidata="Q7355136" url="?curid=881013" title="Rocket Science (band)">
<text>Rocket Science are an Australian alternative rock band from Melbourne, Victoria, formed in June 1998. They released four studio albums in their initial run: &quot;Welcome Aboard the 3C10&quot; (2000), &quot;Contact High&quot; (2002), &quot;Eternal Holiday&quot; (2004) and &quot;Different Like You&quot; (2008), the lattermost of which was released months before their split. The band reunited in 2014, and have since released a further two studio albums: &quot;Snake&quot; (2019) and &quot;Push Play&quot; (2023). 

&quot;Contact High&quot; and &quot; Eternal Holiday&quot; charted at 60, and 67, in the top 100 of the ARIA Albums Chart, while &quot;Contact High&quot;″s single &quot;Being Followed&quot; charted at number 91 in the triple j Hottest 100 of 2002.

== History ==
===1998–2003: &quot;Welcome Aboard the 3C10&quot; and &quot;Contact High&quot;===
Rocket Science were formed in Melbourne in June 1998 by Dave Gray (of The Hogs) on semi-acoustic bass guitar, Paul Maybury (Freeloaders) on guitar, Roman Tucker (The Martians) on lead vocals and keyboards, and Kit Warhurst (Velvet Tongue) on drums. The group released their debut single &quot;Burn in Hell&quot; in 1999.

Their debut album, &quot;Welcome Aboard the 3C10&quot;, was issued on 1 May 2000 via Modular Recordings. Several tracks from their first rehearsal were used for the album.

Rocket Science&#x27;s second album, &quot;Contact High&quot;, was released on 11 February 2002, which reached No. 60 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Michael Dwyer from &quot;The Age&quot; described it as &quot;a refinement of a unique sonic formula that read something like this: schlock-horror/weird sci-fi films plus obscure garage-punk music plus massive vintage keyboard contraption complete with theremin equals Rocket Science.&quot; Carmine Pascuzzi of MediaSearch opined that &quot;[it] shows good improvement – showcasing powerful rock and electronic grooves. They give a genuine tilt at the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll styling&quot; where the group &quot;demonstrates a purpose and ambition in delivering some infectious tracks. They are an interesting band with interesting ideas.&quot;

===2004–2007: &quot;Eternal Holiday&quot; and Tucker&#x27;s coma===
By April 2004, the band&#x27;s their third album had been recorded and Tucker suffered a serious injury from a fall and was put into an induced coma for ten days. This forced the band to cancel all scheduled performances until June. For an appearance at the Fuji Rock Festival in 2004, Maybury was replaced on guitar by Andre Warhurst (brother of Kit) when Maybury was unable to travel due to a broken leg. Andre Warhurst features in the video for the single &quot;Eternal Holiday&quot;, which was filmed in Japan during the visit. The album, &quot;Eternal Holiday&quot; was released on 15 September 2004, and produced by Jim Diamond. The album reached No. 67 on the ARIA Albums Chart. 

The Australian Record Industry Association reported that after his accident Tucker had &quot;remembered precious little of the experience, but, when the other members played him the finished product, he thought that whoever it was, it was pretty good.&quot; Dwyer reviewed the album, which showed &quot;a noticeable shift in the creative base. Warhurst&#x27;s increased input as a writer and harmony singer has resulted in a more melodic and accessible finish to an ever-tighter band chemistry.&quot; The title track was released as the album&#x27;s lead single, which a FasterLouder reviewer described as, &quot;Despite the morbid undertones that inspired the song, it carries a surprisingly upbeat feeling overall with only a slight sense of gloom seeping in through the lyrics.&quot;

The group were dropped by their label but they recorded a fourth album, &quot;Different Like You&quot; which was released on 26 July 2008. It was engineered and produced by Maybury at his own recording studio. Luke McGrath from &quot;BMA Magazine&quot; felt it was &quot;not so much a progression as a refinement – &quot;Different Like You&quot; is as loud, as brash and as concentrated a dose of Rocket Science as any fan could want.&quot; Shane Arnold from &quot;Music Feeds&quot; described its &quot;raw high energy songs infused with theremin and rock &amp; roll&quot; and the group as &quot;easily one of the best (and craziest) live acts going around currently and any albums like this are only going to enhance their reputation.&quot;

The album was preceded by the single &quot;Psychic Man&quot; Trevor Block of Mess+Noise website found it as &quot;three-and-a-half minutes of growling Seeds/Stones hybrid, bursting with energy and plenty of the Science&#x27;s trademark Farfisa organ honking all over a simple borrowed riff.&quot; By August 2008 Mickey Heartbreak (The Dead South) had joined on guitar. The group disbanded in late 2008. 

===2014–present: Reformation and new music===
In 2014, the group reformed. In October 2014 Rocket Science reconvened for a benefit concert for Mick Blood of Lime Spiders at The Tote Hotel, Collingwood. They performed at the Leaps and Bounds Festival in July 2015.

In April 2018, Rocket Science released their first single, &quot;Lipstick Red&quot;, from their then-unnamed fifth studio album. The album, &quot;Snake&quot;, was released in August of 2019. Two further singles were released from the album: &quot;I Hate Hate&quot; and &quot;Cheers Pinger&quot;. In July 2020, the band released their first live album entitled &quot;Live 2020&quot;. In September 2023, the band released their sixth studio album &quot;Push Play&quot;.

<text>Expedition 3 was the third expedition to the International Space Station. Commander Frank L. Culbertson Jr. was the only American crew member, and as such the only American not on Earth during the 9/11 attacks, which the crew photographed and videoed from the ISS.

== Crew ==

== Mission objectives ==

Research in space begun by two previous crews aboard the International Space Station (ISS) expanded during the Expedition Three mission. The third resident crew launched on 10 August 2001 on Space Shuttle Discovery during mission STS-105 and took control of the complex on 13 August 2001. The crew conducted a science-intensive increment and completed four spacewalks. The Expedition Three crew ended their 117-day residency on board the ISS on 8 December 2001 when their custom Soyuz seat-liners were transferred to Space Shuttle Endeavour for the return trip home during mission STS-108.

The Expedition Three crew of the International Space Station enjoyed a unique view of the 2001 Leonid meteor storm. &quot;It looked like we were seeing UFOs approaching the earth flying in formation, three or four at a time,&quot; recalls astronaut Frank Culbertson. &quot;There were hundreds per minute going beneath us, really spectacular!&quot; News reports had warned sky watchers in advance: On 18 November 2001, Earth was due to plow through a minefield of debris shed by Comet Tempel-Tuttle. Innumerable bits of comet dust would become meteors when they hit Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at . Experts predicted an unforgettable display ... and it came. Millions of people saw the show, but only three of them—the ones on board the space station—saw it from above. &quot;We had to look down to see the meteors,&quot; says Culbertson. &quot;That&#x27;s because the atmosphere (where comet dust burns up) is below the station.&quot;

An international crew of three were the third crew to live aboard the International Space Station. The team was led by American Commander Frank Culbertson, and joined by Russian crewmates Vladimir Dezhurov, mission pilot, and flight engineer Mikhail Tyurin. As a part of the STS-105 mission, &quot;Discovery&quot; delivered the Expedition 3 crew to the station. During their four-month stay, the crew saw the orbital complex expand and research work grow. The Expedition 3 crew returned home on mission STS-108.

==Spacewalks==
All four of the spacewalks during Expedition 3 were completed using the Russian Orlan spacesuit and from the Pirs air lock on the Russian segment of the International Space Station.

== Mission patch ==
The Expedition 3 mission patch depicts the book of space history, turning from the chapter with the Russian space station Mir and the space shuttle to the next chapter, one that will be written on the blank pages of the future by space explorers working for the benefit of the entire world. Above the book is a layout of what the station will look like when completed, docked with the space shuttle.

==9/11 satellite pictures==

On 11 September 2001, the International Space Station passed over New York City and astronaut Frank L. Culbertson Jr. photographed the smoke clouds billowing from the World Trade Center site in Downtown Manhattan.

<text>Antoine Ghonda Mangalibi (born February 19, 1965) was the foreign minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from June 30, 2003, until July 23, 2004.

Ghonda was born in Leuven, Belgium, and grew up in the Bas Congo province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which was then known as Zaire. He did university studies in the United States, and earned a B.A. degree in International Relations from Florida International University in 1992. From 1992 to 2000, he worked in his family&#x27;s businesses, and developed a lucrative career in international trade. He took a keen interest in politics during these years, but did not align himself politically during the late years of the Mobutu Sese Seko presidency, nor during the early part of the presidency of Laurent-Désiré Kabila.

In 2000, however, he plunged into politics, joining the Congolese Liberation Movement, a rebel group led by Jean-Pierre Bemba. In 2003, the Congolese Liberation Movement made peace with the national government led by Joseph Kabila and joined a transitional government in which there were four vice-presidents, including two heading major rebel groups. Bemba became one of the vice-presidents and was given the power to appoint the foreign minister. Ghonda was given the post.

In July 2004 Bemba demanded that Ghonda be sacked, and President Kabila was forced to oblige. Although there was active speculation in Kinshasa&#x27;s newspapers about the reasons for Bemba&#x27;s demand, there was not a consensus, and several reasons were advanced. They included Ghonda&#x27;s criticism of troops from Rwanda and Uganda operating on Congolese soil, Ghonda&#x27;s friendship with Joseph Kabila, and the mentioning of Ghonda by George W. Bush as one of the three pillars of the new Congo, with Bemba not being mentioned.

After losing the confidence of Bemba, however, Ghonda became more influential with President Kabila. In the cabinet reshuffle of March 7, 2005, Ghonda was named as one of two roving ambassadors (ambassadeurs itinérants) for the Congolese President. In the 2006 legislative elections, Ghonda was elected to a seat in National Assembly, representing a district in Bas-Congo province whose main town is Kisantu. The Foundation Antoine Ghonda in this town is a leading source of socio-economic development in the area.

<doc id="881027" wikidata="Q3534576" url="?curid=881027" title="Kerala model">
<text>The Kerala model refers to the practices adopted by the Indian state of Kerala to further human development. It is characterised by results showing strong social indicators when compared to the rest of the country such as high literacy and life expectancy rates, highly improved access to healthcare, and low infant mortality and birth rates. Despite having a lower per capita income, the state is sometimes compared to developed countries. These achievements along with the factors responsible for such achievements have been considered characteristic results of the Kerala model. Academic literature discusses the primary factors underlying the success of the Kerala model as its decentralization efforts, the political mobilization of the poor, and the active involvement of civil society organizations in the planning and implementation of development policies.

More precisely, the Kerala model has been defined as:
*A set of high material quality of life indicators coinciding with low per-capita incomes, both distributed across nearly the entire population of Kerala.
*A set of wealth and resource redistribution programmes that have largely brought about the high material quality-of-life indicators.
*High levels of political participation and activism among ordinary people along with substantial numbers of dedicated leaders at all levels. Kerala&#x27;s mass activism and committed cadre are able to function within a large democratic structure, which their activism has served to reinforce.

==History==

The Kerala model originally differed from conventional development thinking which focuses on achieving high GDP growth rates, however, in 1990, Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq changed the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people centered policies. To produce the Human Development Report (HDRs), Haq brought together a group of well-known development economists including: Paul Streeten, Frances Stewart, Gustav Ranis, Keith Griffin, Sudhir Anand, and Meghnad Desai.
Economists have noted that despite low income rates, the state had high literacy rates, healthy citizens, and a politically active population. Researchers began to delve more deeply into what was going in the Kerala model, since human development indices seemed to show a standard of living which was comparable with life in developed nations, on a fraction of the income. The development standard in Kerala is comparable to that of many first world nations, and is widely considered to be the highest in India at that time.

Despite having high standards of human development, the Kerala model ranks low in terms of industrial and economic development. The high rate of education in the region has resulted in a brain drain, with many citizens migrating to other parts of the world for employment. The job market in Kerala is forcing many to relocate to other places.

==Human Development Index==
The United Nations developed the Human Development Index (HDI) in 1990 as a composite statistic used to rank countries by level of &quot;human development&quot; and separate developed (high development), developing (middle development), and underdeveloped (low development) countries. The HDI is used in the United Nations Development Programme&#x27;s annual Human Development Reports and is composed from data on life expectancy, education and per-capita GDP (as an indicator of Standard of living) collected at the national level using a formula. This index, which has become one of the most influential and widely used indices to compare human development across countries, gave the Kerala model international recognition since Kerala has consistently had scores comparable to developed countries since the HDI&#x27;s inception.

In 2021, Kerala again tops the HDI among the Indian states with a score of 0.782, according to the Global Data Lab.

==Public health==

=== History ===
Kerala&#x27;s improved public health relative to other Indian states and countries with similar economic circumstances is founded on a long history of successful health-focused policies.

One of the first key strategies Kerala implemented was making vaccinations mandatory for public servants, prisoners, and students in 1879 prior to Kerala becoming a state, when it was composed of autonomous territories. Moreover, the efforts of missionaries in setting up hospitals and schools in underserved areas increased access to health and education services. Though class and caste divisions were rigid and oppressive, a rise in subnationalism in the 1890s resulted in the development of a shared identity across class and caste groups and support for public welfare. Simultaneously, the growth in agriculture and trade in Kerala also stimulated government investment in transportation infrastructure. Thus, leaders in Kerala began increasing spending on health, education, and public transportation, establishing progressive social policies. By the 1950s, Kerala had a significantly higher life expectancy than neighboring states as well as the highest literacy rate in India.

Once Kerala became a state in 1956, public scrutiny of schools and health care facilities continued to increase, along with residents&#x27; literacy and awareness of the necessity of access health services. Gradually, health and education became top priorities, which was unique to Kerala according to a local public health researcher. The state&#x27;s high minimum wages, road expansion, strong trade and labor unions, land reforms, and investment in clean water, sanitation, housing, access to food, public health infrastructure, and education all contributed to the relative success of Kerala&#x27;s public health system. In fact, declining mortality rates during this time period doubled the state&#x27;s population, and immunization services, infectious disease care, health awareness activities, and antenatal and postnatal services became more widely available. In the 1970s, a decade before India initiated its national immunization program with WHO, Kerala launched an immunization program for infants and pregnant women. In addition, smaller private medical institutions complemented the government&#x27;s efforts to increase access to health services and provided specialized healthcare. As a result, life expectancy continued to increase in Kerala, though household income remained low. Thus, the concept of the &quot;Kerala model&quot; was coined by development researchers in Kerala in the 1970s and the state received international recognition for its health outcomes despite a relatively low per capita income.

In the mid-1970s to the early 1990s, a fiscal crisis caused the government to reduce spending on health and other social services. Reductions in federal health spending also affected Kerala&#x27;s health budget. As a result, the quality and abilities of public healthcare facilities declined and residents protested. Eventually, private health services began to take over, enabled by a lack of government regulation. In fact, by the mid-1980s, only 23% of households regularly utilized government health services, and from 1986 to 1996, private-sector growth significantly surpassed public-sector growth.

In 1996, Kerala began to decentralize public healthcare facilities and fiscal responsibilities to local self-governments by implementing the People&#x27;s Campaign for Decentralized Planning in response to public distrust and national recommendations. For instance, new budgetary allocations gave local governments control of 35 to 40% of the state budget. Moreover, the campaign emphasized improving care and access, regardless of income level, caste, tribe, or gender, reflecting a goal of not just effective but also equitable coverage. A three-tier system of self-governance was established, consisting of 900 panchayats (villages), 152 blocks, and 14 districts. The current healthcare system arose from local self-governments supporting the construction of sub-centers, primary health centers that support five to six sub-centers and serve a village, and community health centers. The new system also allowed local self-governments to create hospital management committees and purchase necessary equipment.

=== Present ===
The basis for the state&#x27;s health standards is the state-wide infrastructure of primary health centers. Under the current system, the primary health centers and sub-centers were brought under the jurisdiction of local self-governments to respond to local health needs and work more closely with local communities. As a result, health outcomes and access to healthcare services have improved. There are over 9,491 government and private medical institutions in the state, which have about 38000 beds for the total population, making the population to bed ratio 879—one of the highest in the country.

There is an active, state-supported nutrition programme for pregnant and new mothers and about 99% of child births are institutional/hospital deliveries, leading to infant mortality in 2018 being 7 per thousand, compared to 28 in India, overall and 18.9 for low- middle income countries generally. The birth rate is 40 percent below that of the national average and almost 60 percent below the rate for impoverished countries in general. Kerala&#x27;s birth rate is 14.1 (per 1,000 people) and decreasing. India&#x27;s rate is 17 the rate of the U.S. is 11.4. Life expectancy at birth in Kerala is 77 years, compared to 70 years in India and 84 years in Japan, one of the highest in the world. Female life expectancy in Kerala exceeds that of the male, similar to that in developed countries. Kerala&#x27;s maternal mortality ratio is the lowest in India at 53 deaths per 100,000 live births.

According to the India State Hunger Index, in 2009, Kerala was one of the four states where hunger was only moderate. The hunger index score of Kerala was 17.66 and was second only to Punjab, the state with the lowest hunger index. The nationwide hunger index of India was 23.31. Despite the fact that Kerala has a relatively low dietary intake of 2,200 kilocalories per day, the infant-mortality rate and the percentage of the population facing severe undernutrition in Kerala is far lower than in other Indian states. In early 2000, more than a quarter of the population faced severe undernutrition in three states—Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh—though they had a higher average dietary intake than Kerala. Kerala&#x27;s improved nutrition is primarily due to better healthcare access as well as greater equality in food distribution across different income groups and within families.
District-wise Hospital Bed Population Ratio as per the 2011
The Health Index, ranking the performance of the States and the Union Territories in India in Health sector, published in June 2019 by the NITI Ayong, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India and The World Bank has Kerala on top with an overall score of 74.01.Kerala has already achieved the SDG 2030 targets for Neonatal Mortality Rate, Infant Mortality Rate, Under-5 Mortality rate and Maternal Mortality Ratio.

The Economist has recognized the Kerala government for providing palliative care policy (it is the only Indian state with such a policy) and funding for community-based care programmes. Kerala pioneered universal health care through extensive public health services. Hans Rosling also highlighted this when he said Kerala matches U.S. in health but not in economy and took the example of Washington, D.C. which is much richer but less healthy compared to Kerala.

Key Health Development indicators- Kerala &amp; India 

==Education==

Pallikkoodam, a school model started by Buddhists was prevalent in the Malabar region, Kingdom of Cochin, and Kingdom of Travancore. This model was later acquired by Christian missionaries and paved the way for an educational revolution in Kerala by making education accessible to all, irrespective of caste or religion. Christian missionaries introduced Western education methods to Kerala. Communities such as Ezhavas, Nairs and Dalits were guided by monastic orders (called ashrams) and Hindu saints and social reformers such as Sree Narayana Guru, Sree Chattampi Swamikal and Ayyankali, who exhorted them to educate themselves by starting their own schools. That resulted in numerous Sree Narayana schools and colleges, Nair Service Society schools. The teachings of these saints have also empowered the poor and backward classes to organize themselves and bargain for their rights. The Government of Kerala instituted the Aided School system to help schools with operating expenses such as salaries for running these schools.

Kerala had been a notable centre of Vedic learning, having produced one of the most influential Hindu philosophers, Adi Shankaracharya. The Vedic learning of the Nambudiris is an unaltered tradition that still holds today, and is unique for its orthodoxy, unknown to other Indian communities. However, in feudal Kerala, though only the Nambudiris received an education in Vedas, other castes as well as women were open to receive education in Sanskrit, mathematics and astronomy, in contrast to other parts of India. Tirunavaya was a centre of Vedic learning in early medieval period. Ponnani in Kerala was a global centre of Islamic learning during the medieval period.

The upper castes, such as Nairs, Tamil Brahmin, Ambalavasis, St Thomas Christians, as well as lower castes such as Ezhavas had a strong history of Sanskrit learning. In fact, many Ayurvedic physicians (such as Itty Achudan) were from the lower-caste Ezhava community and Muslim community (such as the father of renowned Mappila Paattu poet Moyinkutty Vaidyar). Vaidyaratnam P. S. Warrier was a prominent Ayurvedic physician. This level of learning by lower-caste people was not seen in other parts of India. Also, Kerala had been the site of the notable Kerala School which pioneered principles of mathematics and logic, and cemented Kerala&#x27;s status as a place of learning. 

The prevalence of education was not only restricted to males. In pre-colonial Kerala, women, especially those belonging to the matrilineal Nair caste, received an education in Sanskrit and other sciences, as well as Kalaripayattu, a martial art. This was unique to Kerala, but was facilitated by the inherent equality shown by Kerala society to females and males, since Kerala society was largely matrilineal, as opposed to the rigid patriarchy in other parts of India which led to a loss of women&#x27;s rights.

The rulers of the princely state of Travancore also were at the forefront in the spread of education. A school for girls was established by the Maharaja in 1859, which was an act unprecedented in the Indian subcontinent. In colonial times, Kerala exhibited little defiance against the British Raj. However, they had mass protests for social causes such as rights for &quot;untouchables&quot; and education for all. Popular protest to hold public officials accountable is a vital part of life in Kerala.

The following table shows the literacy rate of Kerala from 1951 to 2011, measured every decade:

The Kerala State Literacy Mission Authority (KSLMA) had set up &quot;continuing education programmes for transgenders&quot; (&quot;Samanwaya&quot;) to educate transgender people in Kerala who are ostracised by their family and society and &quot;forced to go out of homes as they are harassed in schools, colleges and in society&quot;. The Social Justice Department of Kerala has various welfare programmes for transgender people like &quot;Yatnam&quot; which provides financial assistance for transgender students preparing for competitive exams, &quot;Varnam&quot; for distance education programmes, there are also other financial assistant programmes for hostel facility etc. Although these policies help some of the transgender people positively they still face disproportionate amount of discrimination in their daily life which makes it harder for these policies to have a meaningful impact on the transgender community.

== Gender ==
Kerala has the highest score on the Gender Development index in India, as demonstrated by the relatively high literacy rate, sex ratio, and mean age at marriage for women, as well as low fertility and infant mortality rates compared to the rest of the country. In fact, women in Kerala have played a crucial role in increasing the state&#x27;s literacy rates, with the mobilization of educated, unemployed women making up two-thirds of volunteer teachers involved in the literacy drive during a 1990 campaign to eliminate illiteracy. The literacy gap between males and females in India is lowest in Kerala, with the female literacy rate just 5% lower than that of males. Moreover, as of 2021, the life expectancy for females is 79.98 years in Kerala compared to 72.09 years in India as a whole. The infant mortality rate is 7 per 1,000 live births in Kerala, as opposed to 28 in India. Another indicator of gender equality and women&#x27;s health is the maternal mortality rate, which is 53.59 per 100,000 live births in Kerala and 178.35 in the rest of India.

Historically, women in Kerala are thought to have possessed more autonomy relative to other Indian states, which is often attributed to its matrilineal structure which ultimately changed into a patrilineal system in the 20th century. Matriliny, in which property was inherited collectively through the female line, was largely practiced by the Hindu Nair caste as well as some other upper-caste Hindus such as the Ezhavas and even some Muslims, who are exclusively patriarchal in other parts of India. However, Christian succession laws in the early 20th century in Kerala were severely restrictive against women. For instance, unmarried daughters could only claim between a quarter and a third of each son&#x27;s share of paternal property, or 5,000 rupees, whichever was less, if the father died without making a will. In all other instances, daughters&#x27; inheritances were restricted to dowries. These laws were challenged when Mary Roy, a Syrian Christian woman who had not received a dowry sued her brother to gain equal access to their inheritance. She ultimately won the case and it was considered a landmark ruling for female succession. Beginning in the 1920s, the Hindu matriarchal system fragmented, especially once the Travancore Nayar Regulation Act of 1925 was passed, which was initiated by the British and began the transition to a strictly patriarchal structure. By the 1970s, the matrilineal system had virtually disappeared and the Kerala family organization became exclusively patrilineal and women&#x27;s rights to property were significantly restricted.

Though women in Kerala are highly educated, recent studies have called attention to the &quot;gender paradox&quot; in Kerala, in which despite the literacy and education of women in Kerala, they are still oppressed in similar or greater regards by the patriarchy relative to other Indian states. Societal and cultural norms are argued by scholars to continue to restrict women&#x27;s freedoms and maintain their subservience to men both at home and in the labor market. High female unemployment rates, discrimination in the labor market, and elevated female suicide rates and gender-based violence, are all indicators of the &quot;gender paradox&quot; in Kerala. In addition, the persistence of the long-standing tradition of dowry across lines of caste, class, and religion, and the finding that women do about twenty times as much housework as men in Kerala suggest the restricted autonomy and oppression that Kerala women continue to face. Furthermore, economic participation and involvement of women is declining in Kerala, and male casual laborers receive almost double that of women. However, some policies such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and Kudumbashree microenterprises have promoted female entrepreneurship, encouraged women&#x27;s economic empowerment, and decreased gender disparities in Kerala, according to academic literature analyzing gender sensitive policies.

== State policy ==
In 1957 Kerala elected a communist government headed by EMS Namboothiripad, introduced the revolutionary Land Reform Ordinance. The land reform was implemented by the subsequent government, which had abolished tenancy, benefiting 1.5 million poor households. This achievement was the result of decades of struggle by Kerala&#x27;s peasant associations. In 1967 in his second term as Chief Minister, EMS again pushed for reform. The land reform initiative abolished tenancy and landlord exploitation, effective public food distribution that provides subsidised rice to low-income households, protective laws for agricultural workers, pensions for retired agricultural laborers, and a high rate of government employment for members of formerly lower-caste communities.

India is a multinational state home to provincial states with differing policies, and Kerala&#x27;s place within this federalist system can be seen through analyses of its regime type. Two coalitions containing all-India parties have alternately been in power in Kerala—not dissimilar to the neighboring South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Kerala has a strong leftist movement presence that has contributed to changes in the traditional feudal-caste system in India. Democratization of the state has surrounded significant increases in components of welfare and has led to a large social transformation since the early 20th century.

Kerala and Tamil Nadu have comparable increases in social development, albeit with Kerala to a much higher degree—yet Tamil Nadu has been ruled by Tamil nationalist parties for over half a century. In comparison, West Bengal is seen as even stronger in terms of Leftist movement and governmental policy compared to Kerala yet is ranked far lower in disparities in rural areas, urban areas, scheduled castes, and scheduled tribes. Further, there is hardly any per capita consumption expenditure and literacy levels between Muslims and Hindus in Kerala—while Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and the country as a whole have relatively high levels of disparities among the two predominant religious groups.

Interestingly enough, those political radicals involved in the original social integration movements in Kerala were politically conservative. Nonetheless, the social discrimination due to caste of the early 20th century contributed to the cultural revolt and political mobilization of depressed castes. It was the success of these movements that allowed for the creation of Leftist movements that elevates the social status of lower classes as a whole.

==Gaps in the Kerala Model==
Kerala has had consistently high levels of development when compared to the rest of the country. The state has the highest record of per capita consumer expenditure, and this level has been progressively increasing since 1993. Kerala has now begun a high growth regime driven mainly by its service and construction industries. The all-India and statewise trend in the estimates of poverty headcount ratio (HCR) and Gini coefficient show that Kerala reduced its HCR by 10.3% between 1988-1993 and then again by another 12.2% in the 11 years proceeding until 2004–2005. Comparatively, Himachal Pradesh—which did not benefit from the same Gulf boom that Kerala did—reduced its post-reform rural poverty to a lower HCR of 10.9% in 2004–05. Moreover, though there was a marginal decline in the Gini coefficient for rural Kerala in 1993-1994 compared to previous years, there is a jump to 38.3% in 2004-2005—the highest figure compared to all-India figures and all other states. The urban Gini coefficient for Kerala in 2004-05 was 41%, second only to Chhattisgarh. Comparisons of scheduled tribes, castes, and religions also show growing income disparities, reflected by increasing incidence of suicides, family violence, gang activity, and alcoholism, among others.

Even public provisioning of equitable access to healthcare and education, which are the foundation of the Kerala model, have decreased overall. The percentage of public spending on education to total government expenditure decreased from 29.28% in 1982–83 to 23.17% 1992-93 and 17.97% in 2005–06. In terms of education, the educational expenditure size of 6% which Kerala followed in the 1960s and 70s declined to just over 4% in the 1980s and below that in 11 of the 16 years during the post-reform regime. While decline of public expenditure on education decreased during the pre-reform period (from 1980 to 1991) at a rate of 0.97% yearly, the post-reform period has seen an even sharper decline of 2.13% a year. With regard to public expenditure on health and family welfare, there too has been an equally sharp fall in spending, from 11.67% of state domestic product (SDP) to 1983–84 to 9.94% in 1989-90 and down to 6.36% in 2005–06. Social security entitlements as a percentage of SDP fell significantly too, while it was increasing at a rate of 1.83% in the pre-reform period it fell to 0.15% during the reform period. Under the current neoliberal regime there has been accelerated commercialization of  the education and health sectors—which has altered the equity base of the Kerala model as a whole. For example, the proportion of students at private unaided schools rose from 2.5% of the 5.9 million total student population in 1990–91 to 7.4% in 2005-06. This is coupled with a 7.5% of intake in government schools over the same time, and only those with the means to pay high fees can go to these private unaided schools.

The marine fishery sector in Kerala is an example of the extent to which disparities still exist despite the Kerala Model&#x27;s emphasis placed on equality. Though fish and fisheries have a very significant place within Kerala as a whole, fishing communities in Kerala have not benefited from state&#x27;s overall efforts at improving quality of life nor the increased value of output in the sector. Data from 1965 to 1975 indicate an eleven-fold increase in the value of output from Rs 68.5 million to 741.4 million in current prices. However, a major deceleration in the rate of increase of value of output is observed from 1975 to 1985 where the level grew from Rs 741.4 million to just Rs 906.4 million as a result of declining fish harvests and prices. While the net state domestic product has increased by about 18% in the same decade, the fishery sector product has decreased by 20% in comparison. This can be seen in the 29% increase in the gap between per capita state domestic product and product per fisherperson between 1975–76 and 1984–85. Poverty is also prevalent in marine fishing communities that are often located on the geographical margins of the land who depend exclusive on the sea for their livelihood. These and other communities on the fringe of state borders have been left behind in the economic and socio-cultural progress that has been widely witnessed by the rest of the state. Poor quality of life and substandard conditions in marine fishing communities can be attributed specifically to the crowding of entire groups of people on the narrow strip of line along the length of Kerala&#x27;s coastline: a total of 222 fishing villages along the state&#x27;s 590 km coastline—none more than a half kilometer wide. Population density in marine fishing villages was measured to be around 2113 persons per square kilometer in 1981, compared to a state figure of 655 per square kilometer. Basic amenities such as electric lighting, access to running water, toilet facilities, etc. are also at far lower standards in these fishing villages when compared to the state as a whole. The lack of basic facilities and hygiene has led to rapid spread of contagious diseases in these areas which express high levels of respiratory and skin infections, diarrheal disorders and hook worm infections to state a few. Though the all-Kerala infant mortality rate was 17 per 1000 live births in 1991, the corresponding rate is 85 per 1000 births in marine fishing communities. There is also a clear gender bias evidenced by the sex ratio of 972 females to 1000 males in these communities, compared to the all-Kerala 1084:1000 ratio of females to males. Thus, marine fishing communities clearly represent an outlier community that has faced restricted levels of capabilities while the state of Kerala has seen progress overall.

==Opinions==
British Green activist Richard Douthwaite interviewed a person who remembers once saying that &quot;in some societies, very high levels – virtually First World levels – of individual and public health and welfare are achieved at as little as sixtieth of US nominal GDP per capita and used Kerala as an example&quot;. Richard Douthwaite states that Kerala &quot;is far more sustainable than anywhere in Europe or North America&quot;. Kerala&#x27;s unusual socioeconomic and demographic situation was summarized by author and environmentalist Bill McKibben:

Kerala continues to lead low-income areas compared to the rest of India. Recent criticisms of the Kerala Model suggest that Kerala is losing its lead within India. K. K. George cites figures indicating that Punjab spends more per capita on education and that both Rajasthan and Punjab spend more per capita on health than Kerala. He also compares Kerala unfavorably with Maharashtra, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Nagaland, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh in pension payments to destitutes. These weaknesses should not be overlooked, but they remain minor compared with Kerala&#x27;s continuing overall ability to deliver a high material quality of life to its people as the indicators show. Oommen and Anandaraj district-level profile (1996) found 9 of Kerala&#x27;s 14 districts among the top 12 in all of India on a composite of literacy, life expectancy, and several economic variables. Kerala&#x27;s lowest district of Malappuram was 31st on a list of 372 districts.

The liberalization-cum-structural adjustment package of the Fund and the Bank presents a philosophy that asserts that the working masses need to make sacrifices today for the sake of providing incentives to capitalists for higher growth, from which those same workers would benefit later. This ‘trickle down’ effect emphasizes the means augmenting supply-side measures necessary for the success of the Kerala Model. Thus, there is an argument that Kerala itself is not self-sufficient but part of a larger region which has this characteristic. The ‘reforms’ observed, then, are more of a reflection of the structural changes made by the Indian economy which has increased supply side incentives for capitalists. This has led to a rise in the degree of exploitation of the working people by cutting their so-called social wage and wrecking the internal balance of the production-structure, which should be taken into consideration when looking at the Kerala Model as a worthwhile example for other third world states.

<text>This is a list of state parks and natural areas in the U.S. state of Tennessee.

==State parks==
Tennessee has 59 designated state parks, operated by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC). The largest park, Justin P. Wilson Cumberland Trail, is made up of land along the Cumberland Trail, stretching from Cumberland Gap at the Virginia state line to Prentice Cooper State Forest in Marion County, just northwest of Chattanooga. The smallest state park is Bicentennial Capitol Mall, at just .

==State natural areas==
Tennessee has 85 state natural areas that are divided into two classes:
*Class I – Scenic-Recreational
*Class II – Natural-Scientific

Nine areas have restricted access and are not open to the public; a tenth, Hubbard&#x27;s Cave, has limited access during the summer.

==State scenic rivers==
Tennessee state scenic rivers are divided into three classes:
*Class I – Natural River Area – Free flowing, unpolluted, and with primitive shorelines and scenic vistas generally inaccessible except by trail.
*Class II – Pastoral River Area – Free flowing, unpolluted, and with shorelines and scenic vistas partially or predominantly used for agricultural and other recreational activities.
*Class III – Developed/Partially Developed River Area – Free flowing, unpolluted, and with shorelines and vistas more developed.

==Former state parks and natural areas==
===State parks===
* Poor Valley Creek State Park (cancelled)
* Ross Creek Landing

===State natural areas===
* Morril&#x27;s Cave (Worley&#x27;s Cave) State Natural Area, Sullivan County
* Short Mountain-Jim Cummings State Natural Area, Cannon County,

<text>James William Turner, known as Jim Turner (born February 6, 1946), is an American lawyer and politician who was the Democratic U.S. Representative for Texas&#x27;s 2nd congressional district from 1997 until 2005.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Turner was born in Fort Lewis, Washington, but reared in Crockett in Houston County in East Texas. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business, and simultaneously earned an MBA and a J.D., all from the University of Texas at Austin. Following graduation, he was commissioned in the United States Army and served eight years (active and reserve), attaining the rank of captain. His legal career in Texas included his own law practice in his hometown of Crockett, his partnership in the Austin office of Hughes &amp; Luce, LLP and serving Of Counsel with Hance Scarborough, LLP.

==State politics==
Prior to being elected to Congress, Turner held several state and local offices. He was a member of the Texas House of Representatives from 1981 to 1984, mayor of Crockett from 1989 to 1991, and a member of the Texas Senate from 1991 to 1996. He succeeded Kent Caperton of Bryan in the Senate. Caperton did not seek reelection in 1990, and Turner defeated the Republican Lou Zaeske, also of Bryan, head of the Texas English-only movement. For two years, Turner was an executive assistant to Texas Governor Mark White.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 1996, 2nd district U.S. Representative Charlie Wilson, known for his role in funding the resistance to Afghanistan&#x27;s communist government, decided not to run for a thirteenth term. Turner won the Democratic nomination to succeed him and was handily elected in November 1996, when Bill Clinton was reelected as U.S. President. He was reelected three times with no substantive opposition. Congressman Turner sat on the House Armed Services Committee, and was the Ranking Member of the House Committee on Homeland Security. Considered a somewhat fiscally Conservative Democrat, Turner co-chaired the Blue Dog Coalition and was a member of the New Democrat Coalition.

In 2003, Turner was one of the targets of a highly controversial redistricting engineered by Tom DeLay. The Texas Legislature dismantled his district, which covered a large portion of East Texas stretching from Lufkin to the suburbs of Houston, and split its territory among three districts. The largest portion was shifted to the 8th District, represented by Republican Kevin Brady, who had been elected the same year as Turner. While Turner had represented more of the new 8th than Brady, most of the 8th&#x27;s vote was cast in heavily Republican Montgomery County, which has as much population as the rest of the district combined. His home in Crockett was thrown into the Fort Worth/Arlington-based 6th district, an even more Republican area represented by the then ten-term incumbent Joe Barton. Barton represented 96 percent of the population of the new district. Believing that he stood no realistic chance of staying in Congress, Turner decided not to seek a fifth term in 2004.

==Post-political career==
He was briefly mentioned in 2006 as a potential candidate for governor of Texas against Rick Perry or the United States Senate seat then held by Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison but now the domain of Senator Ted Cruz.

In 2005, Turner joined the Washington office of Arnold &amp; Porter, LLP as the head of the Public Policy and Legislative Practice Group. In 2017, he became associated with the Austin law firm of Hance Scarborough, LLP, where he is Of Counsel and works in their government relations practice group.

==Personal life==
He and his wife, Ginny, were married in 1970. They have two children: John Turner, who represented District 114 in the Texas House of Representatives and practices at the Dallas law firm Haynes and Boone; and Susan Turner Nold, who is Director of the Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life at the Moody College of Communication.

<text>The Fairfax District is a neighborhood in the Central region of Los Angeles, California.

Historically the Fairfax District has been a center of the Jewish community in Los Angeles. It is known for the Farmers Market, The Grove, CBS Television City broadcasting center, the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust in Pan Pacific Park, the Beverly-Fairfax Historic District neighborhood, and Fairfax Avenue restaurants and shops.

==Geography==
Beverly–Fairfax (sometimes simply called &quot;Fairfax&quot;) is a 3.2-square-mile neighborhood bordered by Willoughby Avenue on the north, Wilshire Boulevard on the south, La Brea Avenue on the east, and La Cienega Boulevard on the west.

ArcGIS, Here Maps, Bing Maps, and MapQuest do not mark boundaries, but center the words &quot;Fairfax&quot; or &quot;Fairfax District&quot; near the intersection of Beverly Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue.

The Mapping L.A. project of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, in a departure from its first draft, reduces the Fairfax District to the 1.23 square miles of the neighborhood that lie east of Fairfax Avenue. Using the Mapping L.A. boundaries, the Fairfax District is flanked on the north and northeast by the city of West Hollywood, on the northeast by Hollywood, on the east by Hancock Park, on the south by Mid-Wilshire, and on the west by Beverly Grove. Street boundaries are Willoughby Avenue or Romaine Street on the north, La Brea Avenue on the east, West Third Street on the south, and Fairfax Avenue on the west. The Beverly–Fairfax (or Fairfax) neighborhood, as it has historically been called, includes both Fairfax and Beverly Grove. In the first draft of Mapping L.A., &quot;Beverly Grove&quot; was not included as a distinct neighborhood; rather, the area was shown as part of Fairfax. An even earlier &quot;L.A. Times&quot; profile of the Fairfax District described the boundaries as &quot;Santa Monica Boulevard on the north and Sixth Street on the south; La Brea Avenue forms its eastern edge with Sweetzer Avenue as its western border.&quot;

==Demographics==

The following data applies to the boundaries of Fairfax set by Mapping L.A.:

The 2000 U.S. census counted 12,490 residents in the 1.23-square-mile neighborhood—an average of 10,122 people per square mile, about the same population density as all of Los Angeles. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 13,360.

The median age for residents was 33, a general average within Los Angeles. The percentage of residents aged 65 and older was among the county&#x27;s highest.

Fifty-four percent of Fairfax residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, a high figure for both the city and the county.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $65,938, average in comparison to the rest of Los Angeles. The average household size of two people was low for the city of Los Angeles. Renters occupied 71.5% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment owners 28.5%.

The percentages of never-married men (54.9%) and never-married women (45.5%) were among the county&#x27;s highest.

===Ethnic composition===
The neighborhood was &quot;not especially diverse&quot; ethnically, with a high percentage of white people. The breakdown was whites, 84.7%; Latinos, 5.9%; Asians, 4.5%; blacks, 2.2%, and others, 2,8%. Ukraine (8.9%) and Mexico (7.8%) were the most common places of birth for the 23.2% of the residents who were born abroad, a low ratio compared to the rest of Los Angeles.

== History ==
Historically, the Fairfax District has been a center of the Jewish community in Los Angeles, after the earlier Boyle Heights period, which was home to the largest Jewish community west of Chicago in the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1935, there were four synagogues in the Fairfax District; by 1945, there were twelve. After World War II, more Jews began to populate the area. As more families moved in, religious schools and a Jewish Community Center sprang up. In 1974, Bet Tzedek Legal Services - The House of Justice, a legal aid charity, opened its doors across from the Farmers Market.

The Farmers Market at Fairfax Avenue and 3rd Street still retains a 1930s atmosphere, with open-air vegetable stalls and cafes, and many Jewish residents of the area still frequent the market as part of their shopping or routine. The Grove, a commercial retail and entertainment center, opened in 2002 next to the Farmer&#x27;s Market.

The neighborhood east of Fairfax Avenue and north of Beverly Boulevard, consisting primarily of still-standing 1920s apartment buildings, was named the Beverly Fairfax Historic District by the City of Los Angeles in 2019. Now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, buildings in the neighborhood must have any exterior alterations approved by the Los Angeles Office of Historic Resources.

The intersection of Fairfax Avenue and Beverly Boulevard is officially recognized as Raoul Wallenberg Square, in honor of the Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of Hungarian Jews from deportation to Nazi death camps. The Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust is located nearby, within Pan Pacific Park.
CBS Television City was built in 1952 on the former site of Gilmore Stadium at Fairfax Avenue and Beverly Boulevard. The facility has been used to tape several shows both for CBS and other entities, the most notable being &quot;The Price is Right&quot;, which has shot in Studio 33 (later renamed for the game show&#x27;s longtime host, Bob Barker) continuously since 1972.

<doc id="881048" wikidata="Q6628357" url="?curid=881048" title="List of mergers and acquisitions by Gen Digital">
<text>Gen Digital, formerly known as Symantec and NortonLifeLock, is a multinational computer software company founded on March 1, 1982. It is an international corporation that specializes in selling security and information management software. Gary Hendrix founded the company in 1982 with the help of a National Science Foundation grant. Symantec was originally focused on artificial intelligence-related projects, and Hendrix hired several Stanford University natural language processing researchers as the company&#x27;s first employees. After the company&#x27;s initial public offering in 1989, Hendrix left the company in 1991 and moved to Texas. The company has acquired 57 companies, purchased stakes in 2 firms, and divested 26 companies, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. Of the companies that Symantec has acquired, 50 were based in the United States. Symantec has not released the financial details for most of these mergers and acquisitions.

Symantec&#x27;s first acquisition was C&amp;E Software on January 1, 1984, and the founder of C&amp;E Software, Gordon Eubanks, became the new chief executive officer of Symantec. The company has made five acquisitions with a value greater than $1 billion: LifeLock was acquired on Feb 9, 2017 for $2.3 billion, Blue Coat Systems was acquired on Aug 1, 2016 for $4.65 billion, VeriSign was acquired on May 19, 2010, for $1.250 billion, Altiris was acquired on April 6, 2007, for $1.038 billion, and Symantec purchased Veritas Software on July 2, 2005, for $13 billion. The deal with Veritas was Symantec&#x27;s largest acquisition and made Symantec the fifth-largest software company in the world. Symantec made the most acquisitions in 2004 with six: ON Technology, Brightmail, TurnTide, @stake, LIRIC Associates, and Platform Logic. The company divested its enterprise-security software business to Broadcom for $10.7 billion in 2019 and adopted the NortonLifeLock name. On November 7, 2022, NortonLifeLock rebranded to Gen Digital after completed its merger with Avast in last September.

<doc id="881062" wikidata="Q263666" url="?curid=881062" title="M0n0wall">
<text>m0n0wall was an embedded firewall distribution of FreeBSD, one of the BSD operating system descendants. It provided a small image which could be put on Compact Flash cards as well as on CD-ROMs and hard disks. It ran on a number of embedded platforms and generic PCs. The PC version could be run with just a Live CD and a floppy disk to store configuration data, or on a single Compact Flash card (with an IDE adapter). This eliminated the need for a hard drive, which reduces noise and heat levels and decreases the risk of system failure through elimination of moving parts found in older hard drives.

On February 15, 2015 Manuel Kasper announced the &quot;m0n0wall project has officially ended. No development will be done anymore, and there will be no further releases,&quot; encouraging &quot;all current m0n0wall users to check out OPNsense and contribute if they can.&quot;

== Features ==
m0n0wall provided an web-based configuration and used PHP exclusively for the GUI and bootup configuration. Additionally, it adopted a single XML file for configuration parameters.

Some functions of m0n0wall were:
* Stateful packet filter firewall
* IPsec and PPTP VPNs
* Inbound and Outbound Network Address Translation
* Captive portal
* Traffic shaper
* Inbound and Outbound port filtering
* Support for 802.1q compatible VLANs
* Multiple IP addresses on LAN and WAN ports
* IPS

==Hardware==

m0n0wall was installed on embedded hardware designed and manufactured by some companies.

== Derivatives ==
;Similar hardware requirements:
* t1n1wall: 2015 fork of m0n0wall after it was discontinued, no activity since 2020.
* SmallWall: Another 2015 fork of m0n0wall after its end-of-life, no activity since 2016.
* m0n0wall mod: Original m0n0wall with additional features (DHCP+PPTP, DHCP+PPPoE, static+PPPoE, L2TP, WAN eth interface), no activity since 2013.

;Extended hardware requirements:
* OPNsense: Forked from pfSense in 2015.
* pfSense: Forked from the m0n0wall project in 2004, first released in 2006.

;Other usages (not a firewall):
* AskoziaPBX: An embedded telephone system.
* XigmaNAS: Network-attached storage software using FreeBSD, uses portions of m0n0wall web GUI. Formerly NAS4Free.
* TrueNAS: Network-attached storage software with versions in FreeBSD and Linux. Developed and maintained by iXsystems

<doc id="881063" wikidata="Q5402865" url="?curid=881063" title="Ethan Allen (armsmaker)">
<text>Ethan Allen (September 2, 1808 – January 7, 1871) was a major American arms maker from Massachusetts. He is unrelated to the revolutionary Ethan Allen. His first firearm, the &quot;Pocket rifle&quot; was developed in 1836, and his first patent was granted in 1837.

==Early life==

Allen began his career as a cutlery maker in Milford, Massachusetts, in 1831. He gained knowledge of metalworking and manufacturing processes by producing knives and shoemaking tools before moving his business to Grafton.

While working on a cane gun for a doctor, Allen came up with the idea for an underhammer pocket rifle and designed it in 1836. The following year he applied for a patent for a &quot;tube hammer&quot; pocket pistol and went into business with his brother-in-law, Charles Thurber. Ethan proved to be a true family man, investing and partnering with a nephew in a New York sporting goods retailer, hiring another brother-in-law Thomas Wheelock who was eventually made a partner, and similarly hiring and later making partners his two sons-in-law Sullivan Forehand and Henry Wadsworth. The latter two continued the business under their own names after Allen died in 1871.

==Trade names==
: 1831–1837: E. Allen (Grafton)
: 1837–1842: Allen &amp; Thurber (Grafton)
: 1842–1847: Allen &amp; Thurber (Norwich)
: 1847–1854: Allen &amp; Thurber (Worcester)
: 1854–1856: Allen Thurber &amp; Co (Worcester)
: 1856–1865: Allen &amp; Wheelock (Worcester)
: 1865–1871: E. Allen &amp; Company (Worcester)

In 1843, the company relocated to Norwich, Connecticut. In addition to arms making, they built prototypes of Thurber&#x27;s typewriter designed for the blind, disabled, and those “nervous” about writing by hand. Though patented, the typewriter was never manufactured for commercial sale.

In 1847, the company moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, and in 1854 Wheelock became an equal partner with the firm&#x27;s name changing to Allen Thurber &amp; Co. In 1856, following Thurber&#x27;s death, the company reorganized as Allen &amp; Wheelock. After the death of Wheelock in 1865, Allen&#x27;s two sons-in-law, Sullivan Forehand, and H. C. Wadsworth, began working for him and the company changed names to Allen &amp; Company. Upon Allen&#x27;s death in 1871, the two operated the company under their own names: Forehand &amp; Wadsworth, until Forehand reorganized the company in 1890 as the Forehand Arms Company after Wadsworth&#x27;s retirement.

Ethan Allen&#x27;s companies made a vast variety of firearms. Most recognized are the Allen &amp; Thurber &quot;pepper-box&quot; revolving pistol—known as the &quot;Gun that won the East&quot;. This pistol was actually much more common than the early Patterson Arms revolvers made by Colt. Few records survive, so much is derived from the physical weapons still in existence and by extrapolating from advertisements, patent dates, etc.

==Single-shot and double-shot percussion pistols==

Pocket rifle

Allen&#x27;s first firearm was the &quot;Pocket rifle&quot;, a single-shot under-hammer percussion pistol. The name likely derives from the fact that most pistols of the day did not have rifled barrels, rather than any claim to extraordinary size. The hammer located on the bottom of the weapon allowed for target sights to be mounted on the top axis of the barrel. Made in .28 to .44 caliber, the average barrel length was 12 inches. Typically sold in pairs, the pocket rifle was produced from 1837–1847. Though most of this period was during the Thurber partnership, markings show exclusively &#x27;Ethan Allen&#x27;, and evidence from an accounting ledger indicates that supply and distribution orders were processed separately from other models of firearms. This likely indicates that Allen retained ownership of this model after establishing the partnership with Thurber. A second pocket rifle was produced under the Allen and Thurber name retaining the under-hammer design but with much smoother lines. The pictures the author has seen show a barrel much shorter than 12 inches, and the caption reads .36 caliber.

Tube Hammer pistol

A single-shot percussion pocket pistol with the hammer in the more usual top position for contemporary pistols. The spectacular innovation was the &#x27;double action&#x27; which allowed firing simply by pulling the trigger. Most firearms of the day and for decades thereafter were &#x27;single action&#x27;, requiring the user to manually cock the firearm prior to pulling the trigger. The barrel had a smooth bore with no rifling. With no sights, this was a close-range personal defense weapon used with a &#x27;point and shoot&#x27; method rather than careful aiming. This model also introduced a screw barrel, allowing for easy disassembly and cleaning. Judging solely from patent dates, production of this pistol began around 1837 and continued beyond 1844 when a patent reissue was granted.

Model 9 Bar Hammer pistol

The tube hammer was followed shortly by the Bar Hammer single-shot percussion pistol. Produced in a wide variety of calibers and barrel lengths, the Model 9 introduced a bar-shaped hammer on the top of the barrel which would be less likely to catch on clothing when drawn from a coat pocket. Barrel length was typically 2-6 inches with a smooth bore, while the most common calibers were .30-.36. Retaining the double action, single shot, screw-barrel design of the tube-hammer, the Model 9 was a success and was produced well into the Allen and Wheelock era. Though made possibly as early as 1837–1838, the bar hammer was eventually marked with an 1845 patent date.

==Revolver pepperbox percussion pistols==
An entire volume could be written about the variations of the Allen and Thurber iconic pepperbox &#x27;revolving pistols&#x27;. Often referred to as &#x27;the gun that won the east&#x27;, the Allen and Thurber pepperbox was a favorite of &#x27;49ers&#x27; and other early immigrants to the western United States. Mark Twain famously quipped that these pistols often discharged more than one barrel when fired, and were not much of a danger to the target, but were dangerous to the shooter. Holding several patents, Allen and Thurber pepperboxes were the most popular multi-shot pistols of the 1830s and 1840s, slowly losing market share in the 1850s to Colt&#x27;s 1849 Pocket and 1851 Navy revolvers. The later revolver pepperboxes were produced well into the Allen and Wheelock era. With the shortage of pistols in the American Civil War, many soldiers on both sides carried an Allen &amp; Thurber pepperbox as a backup arm. Harley Van Cleve and his son Phillip collected and categorized 22 distinct models/variations of the Allen pepperbox, and were an invaluable early 20th century resource for these interesting pistols. Patent dates of 1837 and 1845 help to demarcate sub-models to a limited extent, but many improvements were incorporated on the fly to reduce manufacturing costs and/or create a more reliable product. The 1845 patent represents several simplifications to the design that likely achieved both of these aims. Pepperbox production did not survive the end of the Allen and Wheelock era (c 1864). Due to the number produced, smaller pepperbox pistols are common on the secondary market in a wide spectrum of condition. The Dragoon model noted below is quite rare and commands a premium even in scruffy condition. Please see the cited work for extensive descriptions, illustrations, and a wide variety of photographs. 

4-barrel pepperbox pistols

The four-shot pepperbox was introduced during the Allen and Wheelock era, highlighting that the pepperbox was still an important design through the end of the 1850s. A patent dated 1857 shows that the four-shot barrel assembly attached to the frame in a different manner than the six-shot and five-shot pepperboxes. The standard caliber was .34. All of the pictures this author has seen do not show a nipple shield.

5-barrel pepperbox pistols

It was during the Worcester period that the five-shot pepperbox was introduced. Percussion nipples were integrated into the barrels. It would have been expensive to make the machining, but likely reduced production costs significantly. Made with a bar hammer and standard trigger, models have been encountered with or without an integral nipple shield. .32 Was the most common caliber. The five-barrel is relatively rare compared to the six-barrel models

6-barrel pepperbox pistols

Only six-barrel pepperbox pistols were produced during the Grafton and Norwich periods (1837–1847), and all had smooth barrel external contours until the later Worcester and Allen and Wheelock period, when fluted barrels became the norm. Six-barrel pepperboxes usually have a standard trigger, but some examples have a ring trigger. Most were double-action with the iconic &#x27;bar hammer&#x27;, but some were single-action with standard hammers. While simplifying shooting (no manual cocking of the hammer), the bar hammer did preclude the inclusion of usable sights. However, this early example of a double-action pistol must have been quite a selling point. As these were considered &#x27;point and shoot&#x27; short-range defensive weapons or &#x27;belly guns&#x27;, the market did not seem to object to the limitation of not having sights. Barrel length varied between three and six inches. There were four frame sizes, accommodating various calibers. Most common were .32 and .34 caliber, though the .28 and .30 caliber &#x27;pocket size&#x27; have been reported. The &#x27;Dragoon&#x27; model was the king, typically sporting six-inch barrels and .36 caliber. Except for early models and later Allen and Wheelock era production, most have beautiful engraving on the frame.

==Percussion revolvers==

Bar-Hammer percussion revolver 

The bar-hammer revolver is an interesting type. It is uncertain when production began or ended. The 1845 patent on the bar-hammer is the same as on the pepperbox and some single-shot pistol models. It is likely some number of years after 1845 before this type was produced. A patent for (oddly enough) Rollin White was issued in 1858 that pictured a modified Allen bar-hammer revolver. This would seem to indicate that production started no later than 1856–1857. However, it is possible that production started several years earlier. Production almost certainly ended before the end of the Wheelock era (c 1864). This is based on no more than the logic of simplifying production. In 1861, it is possible that Allen produced the bar-hammer, side-hammer, and center-hammer percussion revolvers as well as the rimfire and lipfire cartridge revolvers simultaneously! Because demand from the Civil War was consuming just about any arm produced, it would have made sense to cease production of the less advanced models. The lineage of the pepperbox is clear in the cylinder design, grip design, standard-style trigger, and patented bar hammer double-action design. This may represent a simple design evolution, as the double-action pepperbox &#x27;pocket pistols&#x27; were very popular in the market. Allen may have been counting on visual and functional design similarity to help sell these revolvers. The design may also be very thoughtful in regards to avoiding patent issues. By incorporating his unchallenged 1845 patent for the bar-hammer double-action mechanism, Allen may have wished to avoid any patent infringement problems from Colt for his own revolving mechanism if the revolver was produced before the expiry of the Colt patent in 1857. Considering all of the evidence that Allen was a thoughtful and frugal businessman, it may simply demonstrate that using common parts was less expensive than designing new ones. The finish was blued, with wood grips as standard, though ivory could be had for an extra cost. The Allen bar-hammer is quite advanced in that pulling the trigger advances the cylinder, cocks the hammer, and drops the hammer, firing the weapon. The cylinder can be removed for cleaning with the removal of the cylinder pin. A separate ramrod would be needed for loading. The cylinder would likely be removed for loading, so reloading under duress is not practical. The author finds these revolvers aesthetically pleasing and very practical for a pocket pistol. This style was manufactured and sold in three different sizes.

Small frame Bar-Hammer revolver

The small frame is a five-shot, .28 caliber revolver, though some .30 caliber models are known. The barrel is 2.5 inches long. The cylinder is engraved with a scene of forest animals identical to the &#x27;pocket-size&#x27; side-hammer percussion revolver. As with many models, changes were made during production, and collectors note an &#x27;early&#x27; and &#x27;late&#x27; variation.

Mid frame Bar-Hammer revolver

The mid-frame is a five-shot, .32 caliber revolver. The barrel is approximately 3 inches long. The cylinder is engraved with a scene of forest animals identical to the &#x27;belt-size&#x27; side-hammer percussion revolver, and a few examples have the frame surface finely engraved as well. As with many models, changes were made during production, and collectors note an &#x27;early&#x27; and &#x27;late&#x27; variation.

Large frame Bar-Hammer revolver 

The large frame is a five-shot, .34 caliber revolver. The barrel is 3.5-4 inches long. The cylinder is engraved with a scene of forest animals identical to the &#x27;belt-size&#x27; side-hammer percussion revolver, and a few examples have the frame surface finely engraved as well. As with many models, changes were made during production, and collectors note an &#x27;early&#x27; and &#x27;late&#x27; variation.

Side-Hammer percussion revolver 

The author has found the side-hammer models to be the most interesting of all of the Allen revolvers. Allen&#x27;s design was clearly influenced by Colt&#x27;s 1855 &#x27;Root&#x27; revolver, adopting the top strap above the cylinder for strength, rigidity and thus accuracy, and the side-hammer rather than the center hammer more usual on the Colt models 1847, 1848, 1849 and 1851. Another &#x27;borrowed&#x27; feature was that the cylinder pin unscrewed from the rear, which the author finds far superior to the various methods of removing to the fore of the pistol. Though influenced by this near contemporary, Allen attempted to build the &#x27;better mousetrap&#x27; by incorporating several unique and patented design features. One change was to retain the standard trigger used in the bar-hammer revolvers rather than Root&#x27;s spur trigger. The most interesting new feature is the combination trigger guard/loading lever. Unlike Colts, Remingtons, and other percussion revolvers that aligned a lever to load the cylinders under the barrel, Allen designed his revolvers to incorporate the trigger guard for this function. A catch is tripped, and the trigger guard and attached arm swing down to push a rammer into the bottom cylinder, thus seating the ball fully into the chamber. This reduced the number of parts and likely cost of manufacture. This patented, unique feature carried on into the later center-hammer percussion models. There were four distinct cylinders, varying in the machining. All models are single-action. Finish was blued, with wood grips as standard. Ivory or silver grips could be had for an additional cost. Though manufactured in much smaller numbers than the Colts, Remingtons, Starr, and other revolvers of the Civil War, Allen and Wheelock revolvers are clearly visible in many pictures of the era. The dates of manufacture are uncertain, possibly beginning as early as the expiry of the Colt patent in 1857. This is supported by a patent granted to Allen in January 1857 covering the loading lever as described. As frugal as Allen was, it is unlikely that production would have ended before the consumption of all parts, even though the new center-hammer percussions were also being produced. It is unlikely that production survived the end of the Wheelock era (c 1864)

Navy model Side-hammer revolver

The Navy model is a six-shot, .36 caliber weapon. The cylinder is beautifully engraved with a scene of forest animals. The Navy model used the first and fourth cylinder type, which is inches long. Barrels were available in six- and eight-inch lengths. Although there are many small variations, there are no essential design changes. There are no known government contracts, though the Army Ordnance Department did purchase 338 on the open market.

Belt model Side-hammer revolver

The Belt model is a five-shot, .32-caliber weapon. As the patent shows a five-shot pistol, the belt model likely was the first produced. There are some examples in .31 and .34 caliber. The cylinder is beautifully engraved with a scene of forest animals. Standard barrel lengths included 4, 5, 6 and inch. The Belt model used the second, third, and fourth cylinder type, which was inches long. Three different model variations are generally accepted.

Pocket model Side-hammer revolver 

The Pocket model is a five-shot, .28 caliber weapon. The cylinder is beautifully engraved with a scene of forest animals. The pocket model only used the fourth cylinder type, which was 1 9/16 inches long. The standard barrel length is four inches. Three different model variations are generally accepted by collectors.

Center-Hammer percussion revolver 

The center-hammer percussion models bear a striking resemblance to the larger lipfire revolvers. All were single-action. Ethan Allen showed much evidence of being astute and frugal, and the design likely evolved as a way to share between a percussion series and the new lipfire weapons. Why would Allen make percussion arms at all when the more advanced cartridge revolvers were available? The oft-referenced patent lawsuit may have caused Allen to &#x27;hedge his bets&#x27; in case he lost and would have to cease production of cartridge revolvers (as happened in 1863). It may be that cartridge firearms were a new and uncertain technology. A conservative market, as epitomized by the US Army Ordnance Department, was buying the established technology percussion weapons by the thousand. Even Smith and Wesson failed to obtain a government contract during the war for their cartridge revolvers. In any event, the center-hammer percussion revolvers were likely seen as a replacement for the side-hammer and possibly bar-hammer revolvers in production. As with many Allen arms, the start date of manufacture is uncertain. With patent dates including 1857, 1858, 1860, and 1861, many have posed that this revolver was not made until after the settlement of the patent lawsuit in 1863. However, records indicate that the US Ordnance Department purchased about 200 from a Boston merchant in December 1861. Perhaps 1860 or early 1861 is accurate. Advertised and marketed to the military, the center-hammer was designed to be stronger and more rugged than the side-hammer revolver. In addition to the stronger frame, the cylinder pin access was moved to the front of the cylinder. The center-hammer revolvers retained the innovative combination trigger guard/loading lever of the side-hammer models.

Navy model revolver 

The Navy model is a six-shot, .36 caliber percussion weapon with a standard 5-, 6-, or -inch barrel. There is an early and late production variant recognized by collectors. The detailed design of variations would seem to indicate that the Navy followed the Army by some margin of time. The finish would be blued, with standard wood grips. Production likely continued until the end of Allen&#x27;s life. Approximately 500 are thought to have been made. Only a few examples are known which have been converted to cartridges.

Army model revolver 
The Army model is a six-shot, .44 caliber percussion weapon with a standard -inch barrel. There is an early and late production variant recognized by collectors. The finish would be blued, with standard wood grips. Production likely continued until the end of Allen&#x27;s life. Approximately 750 are thought to have been made. Only a few examples are known which have been converted to cartridge. A fine &#x27;custom&#x27; nickel Army with extensive engraving by Gustav Young and hand-carved ivory grips is thought to have been the personal weapon of Ethan Allen. This model is pretty beefy, larger, and heavier than the contemporary Colt Model 1860 Army.

Providence Police model revolver 

This model is an anomaly that has bedeviled collectors for years. It is unmarked but has some distinctive design features patented by Allen. It is a five-shot .36 caliber weapon with samples including 3-, 4-, and 5-inch barrels. It is a bit of a throwback, without a loading lever and sporting a spur trigger. Known examples had a blue finish and wood grips. There are records indicating purchase by the Providence Rhode Island police department, hence the name commonly attributed to this model. It is possible that this was a specific contract, and the model was never marketed to the public. This may indicate production very late into the E Allen and Company era shortly before Allen&#x27;s death. His sons-in-law Forehand and Wadsworth may have deemed an obsolescent percussion pistol unworthy of bringing into the inventory of the company now sporting their names, and discontinued the model after that initial run.

==Cartridge pistols==

Like many other arms makers, Ethan Allen saw the bored-through cylinder allowing for the rear loading of self-contained metallic cartridges as the wave of the future. Unfortunately, the patent holder Rollin White, had sold exclusive rights to this innovation to Smith and Wesson, preventing other companies from making firearms leveraging the bored-through cylinder. This legal constraint proved no barrier to Ethan Allen, who made two different rimfire revolvers that hit the market possibly as early as 1857—simultaneous to the Smith and Wesson model 1. As a holder of many patents, it is unlikely that Ethan Allen was ignorant of patent law—he simply chose to ignore it. Perhaps, he reckoned that he could outlast the upstart Smith and Wesson in legal maneuvering. He soon invented the &#x27;lipfire&#x27; cartridge, a modified rimfire that only held the priming compound in approximately 1/8th of the circumference of the base of the cartridge. This made the cartridge base much stronger, as early rimfire cartridges tended to split at the base, causing extraction malfunction. It was also more economical, as only 1/8th of the expensive fulminate was required. Ethan Allen then invented manufacturing equipment for metallic cartridges that far exceeded the competition in quality and efficiency. Allen was awarded a patent for the lipfire cartridge. Production of lipfire revolvers likely began around 1859. With the coming of the Civil War, Allen likely smelled immense profits for his &#x27;better mousetrap&#x27;. However, the conservative procurement agents of the US Government awarded only small contracts—likely not trusting the technology or the supply of cartridges. By 1863, Rollin White finally won his patent infringement lawsuit, and production of all Allen and Wheelock cartridge revolvers ceased.

Rimfire revolvers 

.22 caliber rimfire revolver

This is the first cartridge revolver made by Allen and Wheelock, and one of the first cartridge revolvers from any manufacturer (competing with the Smith and Wesson model 1). It is a single-action seven-shot revolver in .22 Rimfire (black powder equivalent of the modern .22 Short). It features the side-hammer of the early percussion revolvers and a spur trigger. Empty cases were removed by removing the cylinder and using the cylinder pin to push the case out of the cylinder. There are many variations typically organized into six models, though all share the size and critical design features. Most were made with a 3-inch barrel. The first through fourth models have engraved cylinders, with crossed rifles, a horse and rider, military articles, an Indian with a bow, and a sailing ship. Allen obtained a patent granted in 1858, and production likely began in 1857. Production continued until 1863 when production of all cartridge revolvers was halted by the lawsuit described previously. Production resumed upon the expiry of the Rollin White patent in 1869, though likely from parts manufactured in the earlier period. After Allen&#x27;s death in 1871, production continued for some period under the new company name Forehand and Wadsworth.

.32 caliber rimfire revolver 

Following the introduction of the .22 Rimfire, Allen and Wheelock introduced the larger .32 Caliber Rimfire. Stronger to accommodate the more powerful cartridge, the .32 caliber followed the design cues of the .22 in being a single-action, spur-trigger revolver. The cylinder accommodated six cartridges, and barrels could be had in either three-, four-, or five-inch lengths. Engraving on the cylinder was a country scene with dogs chasing a rabbit. There are three &#x27;models&#x27; with detail improvements, though the basic design remained unchanged. The cylinder, and consequently frame, length grew from .905 inch to .940 inch to 1.2 inches. Production likely began in 1858 and ceased in 1863 per the patent suit described above. Production, or at least assembly, resumed presumably at the expiration of the Rollin White patent as a catalog from 1871 offers them at $9.25. A patent was granted in 1860 to reduce drag on the recoil shield applied to this revolver as well as the lipfire revolvers. A later patent with a simplified action was granted in 1861. With the solid frame design, these revolvers were far stronger than the contemporary Smith and Wesson Model 2. In fact, the author would challenge that the design is much more sophisticated than the contemporary Smith &amp; Wesson. Though it cannot be confirmed, it likely beat the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 2 to market.

Lipfire revolvers 

Ethan Allen was granted a patent in September 1861 for his .44 caliber lipfire revolver. As this is more than a year since his patent on the lipfire cartridge, it is possible that lipfire revolvers were produced in late 1860 or early 1861. As many incomplete revolvers and parts would have been in existence at the time of the &quot;cease and desist&quot; court order from the patent infringement in 1863, this inventory was kept and these revolvers were reintroduced when the White patent expired in 1869 until the parts stocks were depleted. All of the Allen and Wheelock lipfire revolvers were single-action. Many of the lipfire weapons were converted to rimfire with the simple removal, and machining of just a small amount on the rear face of the cylinder as supplies of the ill-fated lipfire cartridge dwindled. While it is not known for certain, some of these conversions may have occurred at the factory, especially for those assembled in or after 1869. Others were converted by any number of gunsmiths around the country. The Army model was the first &quot;large bore&quot; (more than .40 caliber) cartridge revolver and remained so until the Remington cartridge conversions of the model 1858 appeared in 1868—soon followed by the cartridge-designed Smith &amp; Wesson Model 3 in 1869. Similarly, the Navy model was the only .36 caliber cartridge revolver until the similar conversion of Colt models 1851, 1861, and 1862 following the expiry of the Rollin White patent.

.25 caliber lipfire revolver

Made without a loading gate or ejection mechanism, the .25 caliber lipfire is still another unique design. To load or unload, this seven-shot pocket gun required the cylinder to be removed to load or unload the cylinder. With just a few exceptions, most of the .25 caliber revolvers carry no markings. It is speculated that these may have been very late to market before the loss of the patent suit as a &#x27;spit in your eye&#x27; gesture to Smith and Wesson. A 3-inch barrel was standard.

.32 caliber lipfire revolver

The .32 lipfire sports a six-shot cylinder in a smaller caliber. The design of the .32 caliber lipfire breaks from its bigger brothers in several important ways. Firstly, it sports a spur trigger rather than using the standard trigger with a guard. Secondly, it uses a side-hammer of earlier design. Lastly, it ditches the trigger guard ejector/plunger for a weaker left-mounted plunger with rack and pinion gears to the top and left of the chamber. In design, it seems to be a marriage/compromise between its bigger brothers and the earlier .32 Rimfire revolver. Barrel lengths include 4-, 5-, and 6-inch.

.36 caliber lipfire rtevolver 

Very similar in design to the 44 caliber lipfire, this revolver was &#x27;downsized&#x27; slightly and chambered in .36 caliber. The cylinder has a six-shot capacity. As with the similar-sized center-hammer percussion, barrel lengths were produced in 5-, 6-, and 8-inch to accommodate different tastes. No significant variants are recognized, which may indicate that the .36 followed the .44 after the .44 design gestation.

.44 caliber lipfire revolver

The .44 was the first lipfire revolver produced. It sports a six-shot cylinder. Similar in appearance to the center-hammer percussion revolver, the rack and pinion mechanism of the loading level is hijacked to provide a cartridge case removal plunger. Thus the trigger guard pivots to actuate the plunger, as the center-hammer percussion revolver used the trigger guard to ram the load into the cylinder. Four variants are recognized, with &#x27;narrow&#x27; and &#x27;common&#x27; width grips and top vs. bottom hinges on the loading gate highlighting the difference. The standard barrel length was a massive 8 inches long, with the breadth and heft of the Army model center hammer percussion pistols.

Single shot rimfire pistols

With single-shot percussion pistols still selling well, it was natural that Allen would adopt cartridges to this style of pistol. A single-shot cartridge pistol also did not infringe on the Rollin White patent as described above.

==Cartridges==

On September 25, 1860, Ethan Allen was granted a patent for his lipfire cartridge. He also manufactured pinfire cartridges from 1862 until at least 1865.

<text>Hope is a district municipality at the confluence of the Fraser and Coquihalla rivers in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Hope is at the eastern end of both the Fraser Valley and the Lower Mainland region, and is at the southern end of the Fraser Canyon. To the east, over the Cascade Mountains, is the Interior region, beginning with the Similkameen Country on the farther side of the Allison Pass in Manning Park.
Located east of Vancouver, Hope is at the southern terminus of the Coquihalla Highway and the western terminus of the Crowsnest Highway, locally known as the Hope-Princeton (Highways 5 and 3, respectively), where they merge with the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1). Hope is at the eastern terminus of Highway 7. As it lies at the eastern end of the Fraser Valley in the windward Cascade foothills, the town gets very high amounts of rain and cloud cover – particularly throughout the autumn and winter.

Hope is a member municipality of the Fraser Valley Regional District which provides certain municipal services to unincorporated settlements and rural areas.

The District of Hope includes Hope (the previous Town of Hope) and surrounding areas, including the communities of Kawkawa Lake, Silver Creek, Flood, and Lake of the Woods.

== History ==

The Stó:lō have lived in the Fraser Valley since 8,000 to 10,000 years ago.

In late 1782, a smallpox epidemic among the Stó:lō killed thousands – an estimated two-thirds of the population.

Explorer Simon Fraser arrived in what is now Hope in 1808, and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company created the Fort Hope trading post in 1848. The area was transformed by the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, beginning in 1858. The following year Governor James Douglas laid out the Fort Hope town site. Hope became part of the new British colony of British Columbia when it was created on 2 August 1858. Along with the rest of British Columbia, Hope became part of Canada in 1871.

Late in 1859, Reverend Alexander St. David Francis Pringle arrived in Hope, and on 1 December of that year, founded the first library on the British Columbia mainland. Within two years, he also founded the Christ Church Anglican church, the oldest church on the British Columbia mainland that still holds services on its original site. It is a National Historic Site of Canada.

Hope incorporated as a village on 6 April 1929, became a town on 1 January 1965, and was reincorporated as a District Municipality named the District of Hope on 7 December 1992.

=== Naming ===
Fort Hope was established in 1848–49 by chief trader Henry Newsham Peers. He discovered a route through the mountains that did not dip below the 49th parallel, which had become the American border. Thus, the hope that his route would be workable was fulfilled.

=== World War II ===

During World War II an internment camp for Japanese Canadians was set up near Hope at Tashme, now known as Sunshine Valley, just beyond the 100-mile exclusion zone from the coast.

===Recent history===
In 2011, the metal Kawkawa Bridge was demolished; previously, it was featured in the 1982 Rambo film, &quot;First Blood&quot;. In 2020, a wood carved statue of Sylvester Stallone character John Rambo was erected in Hope.

== Geography ==

Hope is at the easternmost point of British Columbia&#x27;s lower mainland area and is usually considered to be part of the Fraser Canyon area or &quot;eastern Fraser Valley&quot; as &quot;Lower Mainland&quot; is commonly understood as synonymous with &quot;greater Vancouver&quot;. There are relatively significant peaks to the north, east, and south of the townsite. Only to the west can flat land be seen, and that view is dominated by the broad lower reaches of the Fraser River. The segment from Lytton to Hope separates the Cascade Mountains and Coast Mountains, thereby forming the lower part of the Fraser Canyon, which begins far upriver near Williams Lake. At Hope, the river enters a broad flood plain extending to the coast and Vancouver.
The Coquihalla and Sumallo Rivers and Silverhope Creek rise in the Cascade Mountains northeast and southeast and south of Hope, respectively, and empty into the Fraser River. The Skagit River begins south of Hope, across a low pass from the head of the Silverhope valley, which is the access to the Canadian shoreline of Ross Lake.

<doc id="881072" wikidata="Q20872" url="?curid=881072" title="Order of the Dannebrog">
<text>The Order of the Dannebrog () is a Danish order of chivalry instituted in 1671 by Christian V. Until 1808, membership in the Order was limited to fifty members of noble or royal rank, who formed a single class known as &quot;White Knights&quot; to distinguish them from the &quot;Blue Knights&quot; who were members of the Order of the Elephant. In 1808, the Order was reformed and divided into four classes. The statute of the Order was amended in 1951 by a Royal Ordinance so that both men and women could be members of the Order. Today, the Order of the Dannebrog is a means of honouring and rewarding the faithful servants of the modern Danish state for meritorious civil or military service, for a particular contribution to the arts, sciences or business life, or for working for Danish interests.

==Insignia==
The &quot;badge&quot; of the Order is a white enamelled Dannebrog cross (i.e., a cross pattée, the lower arm being longer than the others) with a red enamelled border, for the Knights in silver, and for everyone else in gold or silver gilt. At the top of this cross is the royal cypher of the bestowing monarch, crowned with the distinctive Danish royal crown On its front, the cross bears the royal cyphers of Christian V at its centre, as well as the motto of the Order: (God and the King) on its arms. On its reverse are found the crowned royal cyphers of Valdemar II Sejr, Christian V and Frederik VI, as well as the years 1219, 1671 and 1808, the years that each of them ascended the Danish throne. In each of the four angles of the cross is found a small Danish royal crown.

The &quot;collar&quot; of the Order is made of gold, with small enamelled Dannebrog crosses alternating with alternating crowned royal cyphers representing Kings Valdemar II Sejr and Christian V, the reputed and actual founders of the Order. When the collar is worn the sash is not worn.

The &quot;star&quot; of the Order is an eight-pointed silver star with straight rays with an enamelled Dannebrog cross (similar to the front of the badge but without the royal cypher above and the royal crowns between the arms of the cross) at the centre.

The &quot;breast cross&quot; of the Order is similar to the cross on the &quot;star&quot; but larger and with faceted silver instead of white enamel and without the silver rays of the &quot;star&quot;.

The &quot;ribbon&quot; of the Order is white silk moiré with red borders, the national colours of Denmark.
The Order originally had a distinctive habit worn by the knights (after 1808, by the Knights Grand Cross) on very solemn occasions. The habit consisted of a white doublet, white breeches, white stockings and white shoes, over which was worn a red mantle with a white lining and with the star of the order embroidered in silver on its left side. Over this red mantle was worn a short white shoulder cape with a standing collar embroidered in gold, upon which was worn the collar of the Order (the habit was always worn with the collar and never with the ribbon of the Order). The habit also had a black hat with a plume of white and red ostrich feathers. This habit was almost identical to that worn by the knights of the Order of the Elephant.

==Grades==
The Order is divided into six grades, which are grouped into four classes:
* Special class
**Grand Commander () — wears the badge with diamonds on a necklet (gentlemen) or on a bow (ladies), plus the star on the left chest;
* First Order class
**Grand Cross () — wears the badge on a collar or on a sash on the right shoulder, plus the star on the left chest;
* Second Order class
**Commander 1st Class () — wears the breast cross on the left chest, plus (for gentlemen) the badge on a neck ribbon;
**Commander () — wears the badge on a neck ribbon (gentlemen) or on a bow (ladies);
* Third Order class
**Knight 1st Class () — wears the badge on a ribbon (gentlemen) or on a bow (ladies) with rosette on the left chest;
**Knight () — wears the badge on a ribbon (gentlemen) or on a bow (ladies) on the left chest.

The Grand Commander grade is reserved for persons of princely origin. It is awarded only to royalty with close family ties to the Danish Royal House. The Grand Cross grade can, as a special honor, be awarded &#x27;with diamonds&#x27; (S.K.i diam., short for ). The Order also has a related decoration, known as the Cross of Honour (D.Ht., short for ). The insignia of the Order must be returned upon the death of the holder.

===Order of wear===
==Cross of Honour==
The &quot;Dannebrogordenens Hæderstegn&quot; (Cross of Honour of the Order of the Dannebrog) in modern times is only awarded to Danes on whom the Order of the Dannebrog has already been bestowed. It is also worn by members of the Danish royal family. Its badge is similar to the badge of the Order, but all in silver. It is worn on a ribbon (by gentlemen) or bow (by ladies), with rosette, on the left chest.

==Recipients==

Each Danish ministry has a quota of Knights and Knights 1st class that they may use at their discretion. It is most often given to high-ranking officers of the police, armed forces and emergency services.

Also used for politicians in Folketinget after 8 years of elected service. Ministers are given the rank of Knight 1st Class.

The rank of Commander is given to colonels, ministers and other high-ranking officials as a retirement-decoration after long service. Commander 1st class is given for admirals, generals, Supreme-court judges, ambassadors, and other governmental leaders as a retirement decoration.
The Grand Cross is most often used for admirals, generals, Supreme-court judges, ambassadors and similar as a reward for very meritorious service to Denmark.

Grand Cross with Breaststar with Diamonds is most often given to high-ranking officers of the Royal Court, such as Hofmarskals.

Finally, the Grand Commander grade is given only to 8 people. The reigning monarch is always a Grand Commander, and he/she may give the grade to 7 others, most often close family.

===Diplomatic use===
Award of the Order of the Dannebrog is often used as a tool of diplomacy. If a foreign country has an Order that they give to foreign diplomats in their country, then their diplomats in Denmark can be given an Order of the Dannebrog. To be eligible, the foreign ambassador must have resided in Denmark for at least three years.

==Grand Commanders==

# &quot;His Majesty&quot; Frederik X, King of Denmark, Master of the Order (1 January 2004)
# &quot;Her Majesty&quot; Margrethe II, former Queen of Denmark, (14 January 1972)
# &quot;His Majesty&quot; Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden (10 April 1975)
# &quot;His Majesty&quot; Harald V, King of Norway (28 October 1991)
# &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; Benedikte, Princess of Denmark (27 January 1993)
# &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; Joachim, Prince of Denmark (16 April 2004)
# &quot;Her Majesty&quot; Mary, Queen of Denmark (26 May 2024)

With the death of ex-King Constantine II of Greece in 2023, one Grand Commander position is available. The number of Grand Commanders never exceed 8.

==Revocation==
It is possible for membership in the Order to be revoked. Before 1808, membership had only been revoked on two occasions – Peder Griffenfeld who was charged with treason, and (1640–1704) who was charged with looting and gross misconduct. In more recent times, it has been revoked on the basis of criminality, such as Peter Adler Alberti (1910), Erik Ninn-Hansen (1995), Peter Brixtofte (2008) and Christian Kjær (2019). Foreigners have also had their membership revoked. Several prominent Nazi officials, such as Hermann Göring and Konstantin von Neurath, were awarded the Order, but it was later revoked.

== Jewelers and goldsmiths ==

Below is a list of jewelers who have made the insignia for the Order:

Anton Michelsen was made a part of Royal Copenhagen A/S, which is now the supplier.

<text> (, ) is a Flemish daily newspaper published in Belgium by Mediahuis (formerly Corelio and VUM). It was traditionally a Christian-Democratic paper, associated with the Christian-Democratic and Flemish Party, and in opposition to the Socialist Flemish daily &quot;De Morgen&quot;. In recent years has renounced its original ideological ties.

==History and profile==
In 1911, Frans Van Cauwelaert founded &quot;Ons Volk Ontwaakt&quot;, the weekly journal of the Flemish Catholic student organization.

In 1914, Van Cauwelaert, Alfons Van de Perre, and Arnold Hendrix formed a publishing company, &quot;De Standaard N.V.&quot; (&quot;The Standard, Incorporated&quot;: the Standard Group). Their goal was to publish a conservative, Catholic, Flemish daily newspaper in Brussels, to be called . The motto of was &quot;Alles voor Vlaanderen - Vlaanderen voor Kristus&quot; (&quot;Everything for Flanders - Flanders for Christ&quot;), abbreviated &quot;AVV-VVK&quot;. &quot;AVV-VVK&quot; appeared in &#x27;s front-page banner until 1999. The first edition was to appear on 22 November 1914, but publication was cancelled due to the outbreak of World War I. did not appear until 4 December 1918, after the war ended. Gustave Sap, who joined the board of directors in 1919, provided the necessary capital for its initial expansion. The paper was started as a conservative daily with Catholic values.

In 1940, during the Second World War, Belgium was occupied by Nazi Germany. again ceased publication. However, a new
paper, &quot;Het Algemeen Nieuws&quot; (&quot;The General News&quot;) was published with &#x27;s staff and presses, printing only what the Nazi occupation government permitted. After the liberation of Belgium in 1944, the management of Standard Group was accused of collaboration with the Nazi occupiers, and the company was banned for two years. A new company was therefore created: &quot;De Gids N.V.&quot; (&quot;The Guide, Inc.&quot;), which began publishing &quot;De Nieuwe Standaard&quot; (&quot;The New Standard&quot;) in November 1944. Older titles of the Standaard group were also continued by De Gids.

In 1947, the ban on Standard Group was removed, and with court permission the company reclaimed all its titles. &quot;De Nieuwe Standaard&quot; was immediately renamed &quot;De Nieuwe Gids&quot;, and then, as of 1 May, again.

In the 1960s and 1970s, was famous for its high-quality and independent foreign affairs coverage. For example, despite its Catholic and conservative ties, was critical of American policy in southeast Asia.

However, the financial condition of Standard Group deteriorated, becoming critical in 1976. Standard Group declared bankruptcy on 22 June. was rescued by André Leysen, a Belgian businessman, who formed &quot;Vlaamse Uitgeversmaatschappij N.V.&quot; (VUM - &quot;Flemish Publishers Partnership&quot;). VUM took over Standard Group&#x27;s titles, and became the publisher of . VUM changed its name to Corelio in 2006. The sister newspaper of is .

Since 30 September 1999 the newspaper has stopped printing the lettercross AVV-VVK on its frontpage. In March 2004, changed its format from traditional broadsheet to compact format. Unlike common practice for most of the newspapers this change occurred during its modernization process, not as a response to low circulation levels.

On 9 January 2017 fired its controversial columnist, Dyab Abou Jahjah, after the latter made comments on Twitter that condoned the 2017 Jerusalem truck attack.

==Circulation==
In 2002 had a circulation of 98,169 copies. The circulation of the paper was also reported to be 93,500 copies in 2002. The paper had a circulation of 79,000 copies in 2003 and 81,000 copies in 2004.

The circulation of the paper was 102,280 copies in 2007. During the first quarter of 2009 the paper had a circulation of 107,888 copies. In 2009 its paid circulation was about 98,000 copies.

<text>USS &quot;Tortuga&quot; (LSD-26) was a in the United States Navy. She was the first Navy ship to be named for the Dry Tortugas, a group of desert coral islets 60 miles west of Key West, Florida, which were discovered in 1513 by Spanish explorer Ponce de Leon.

&quot;Tortuga&quot; was laid down on 16 October 1944 by the Boston Navy Yard; launched on 21 January 1945; sponsored by Mrs. George T. Paine; and commissioned on 8 June 1945.

==History==

===1945-1947===
Commissioned during the final phase of World War II, &quot;Tortuga&quot; conducted shakedown in the Virginia Capes area and was at Colón, Canal Zone, en route to the Pacific combat area on 15 August 1945 when she received news of Japan&#x27;s surrender. The dock landing ship soon proceeded to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, and subsequently operated in Korean and Chinese waters, repairing small craft and serving in the mobile support unit attached to Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet. Operating initially out of Jinsen (now Inchon), Korea, &quot;Tortuga&quot; subsequently conducted her support missions out of Tsingtao, Taku, and Shanghai, China; Hong Kong; and Yokosuka, Japan. In the spring of 1947, the ship returned to the west coast of the United States, via Guam and Pearl Harbor, and was decommissioned and placed in reserve at San Diego on 18 August 1947.

===1950-1953===
Following the outbreak of a civil war between North Korea and South Korea in the summer of 1950, &quot;Tortuga&quot; was recommissioned on 15 September 1950. Reactivated in response to the Navy&#x27;s need for amphibious ships created by the Korean War, the landing ship dock underwent an abbreviated refitting and shakedown before she sailed for Japan on 29 December. Proceeding via Pearl Harbor and Eniwetok, she arrived at Sasebo on 3 February 1951. &quot;Tortuga&quot; participated in a feint landing which preceded the operation mounted to recapture the strategic port of Inchon.

About this time, intelligence reports indicated that the Chinese Communists might take advantage of American preoccupation with the war in Korea by mounting an invasion, across the Taiwan Strait, of Nationalist-held Formosa. American strategists felt that, in such an endeavor, the Communist Chinese would utilize many seagoing junks since, in operations off Korea, vessels of this type had proven to be almost unsinkable. Accordingly, &quot;Tortuga&quot; raised eight 60-foot junks from the depths of Inchon harbor and transported them to Yokosuka to be studied to determine what ordnance would be most effective against them.

&quot;Tortuga&quot; remained in the Far East through 1952 for two more Korean deployments. During the first, the landing ship provided support services at Inchon; and, in the second, she took part in the massive amphibious feint at Kojo, North Korea, from 13 to 16 October 1952, and in operations off Wonsan, supporting mine-craft in November and December. During 1953, &quot;Tortuga&quot; participated in the Korean prisoner-of-war exchange after the Panmunjom Armistice and also conducted landing exercises and maneuvers in the Far East and off the west coast of the United States.

===1954-1964===
&quot;Tortuga&quot; was deployed to the Western Pacific (WestPac) again in 1954. The signing of the Geneva Accords which ended the fighting between the French and Viet Minh resulted in the creation of two Vietnams — North and South. The former was to be in Communist hands; the latter was to be governed by non-Communist leaders. Diverted to Haiphong from Yokosuka, &quot;Tortuga&quot; arrived at her destination on 21 August 1954 to take part in the massive evacuation of French nationals, in &quot;Operation Passage to Freedom&quot;, as well as the moving of Vietnamese who chose not to live in the north. The landing ship conducted four round trips from Haiphong in the north to Tourane (now Da Nang), Saigon, and Nha Trang in the south, before she returned to Yokosuka on 4 October. For the remainder of the year, she conducted minesweeper support operations in Korean waters.

During the 14 years from 1955 to 1969, &quot;Tortuga&quot; would remain employed in a regular schedule of deployments to WestPac. In 1958, &quot;Tortuga&quot; conducted operations in the Marshall Islands. She was based at San Diego until 30 June 1966, when her home port was changed to Long Beach. In between deployments — which included exercises and equipment lifts and labors to help maintain the 7th Fleet&#x27;s readiness — &quot;Tortuga&quot; conducted local operations put of west coast ports and underwent progressive modifications during regular availabilities.

===1964-1965===
As American involvement in Southeast Asia deepened during the latter half of the 1960s, &quot;Tortuga&quot;&#x27;s deployment schedule accordingly reflected her role in the buildup of Allied strength to attempt to check communist domination of Southeast Asia. Soon after receiving word of the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, &quot;Tortuga&quot; — combat-loaded — got underway from Buckner Bay. She remained underway in the South China Sea from 6 August to 19 September before returning to Subic Bay.

For the remainder of the year 1964, &quot;Tortuga&quot; operated out of Yokosuka and conducted troop and equipment lifts between Japan and Okinawa until she headed home and arrived back at San Diego on 18 December. In February 1965, the landing ship proceeded to Camp Pendleton, California, to participate in Exercise &quot;Silver Lance,&quot; the largest peacetime landing exercise ever held. In June, she commenced a WestPac deployment. She proceeded to Buckner Bay and Da Nang and, after operating in the Orient through the early summer, returned to Long Beach in late August 1965. She subsequently conducted a lift to Okinawa before she returned to San Diego for refresher training.

===1966-1967===
&quot;Tortuga&quot; sailed for Vietnamese waters on 1 March 1966, arrived at Vung Tau on 18 April, and relieved as support ship for Operation Game Warden — the Navy&#x27;s operation designed to interdict the flow of Communist supplies along the coastlines of South Vietnam. Initially, &quot;Tortuga&quot; operated in the Rung Sat Special Zone between Saigon and Vung Tau, helping to guard the entrance to the shipping channels snaking through Viet Cong (VC) territory to the capital city.

&quot;Tortuga&quot; shifted to the Mekong Delta region on 12 June to serve as a floating base for the Navy&#x27;s fast PBR&#x27;s of Task Force 116 and for a detachment of Army Bell UH-1B Huey helicopter gunships. Initially, the helicopters were from the 145th Aviation Detachment, however, by the end of &quot;Tortuga&#x27;s&quot; tour, they were Navy aircraft from Task Force &quot;Sea Wolf.&quot;

During her support operations with the riverine assault groups, &quot;Tortuga&quot; received a number of distinguished visitors ranging from General William C. Westmoreland, Commander, Military Assistance Group; Rear Admiral Norvell G. Ward, Commander, Naval Forces Vietnam; as well as United States Ambassador to South Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge; and news commentator Chet Huntley, who brought with him an NBC camera team to record a news story on &quot;Tortuga&quot;&#x27;s river-patrol base activities.

Her deployment completed in the summer of 1966, &quot;Tortuga&quot; got underway on 30 August and steamed via Japan to the west coast. She arrived at San Diego on 7 November for leave, upkeep, and overhaul. The refit lasted through April 1967, modernizing the ship and preparing her for another WestPac deployment. Following a period of refresher training and amphibious exercises, &quot;Tortuga&quot; sailed on 21 July 1967 from San Diego and arrived, via Hawaii, Guam, and the Philippines, at Da Nang on 5 September.

Upon arrival, &quot;Tortuga&quot; relieved with Amphibious Ready Group &quot;Bravo&quot; and operated with that unit into the fall of 1967. She took part in Operations Fortress Sentry and Formation Leader, before her detachment from ARG &quot;B&quot; on 9 November. Subsequently, &quot;Tortuga&quot; loaded a cargo of disabled or damaged CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters for transport from Da Nang to Okinawa, where they were repaired for further service. For the remainder of the year, from 3 to 31 December, &quot;Tortuga&quot; conducted cargo lifts from Japanese ports to Vietnam and vice versa.

===1968-1969===
&quot;Tortuga&quot; then returned to the west coast — via Yokosuka, Buckner Bay, Subic Bay, Hong Kong and Pearl Harbor — and arrived at Long Beach on 9 March 1968. For the remainder of the year, the landing ship conducted exercises and local operations put of Long Beach, until again deploying to WestPac in February 1969. On 17 February, while en route to Yokosuka, &quot;Tortuga&quot; conducted her first underway refueling — with receiving 31,000 gallons of Navy Special Fuel Oil (NSFO). Upon arrival at Yokosuka, &quot;Tortuga&#x27;s&quot; in-port time was extended to allow the on-loading of a complete destroyer radar system for transport to Subic Bay. Underway on 11 March with her special cargo, the landing ship soon reached Subic Bay, unloaded, and proceeded for Kaohsiung, Taiwan, en route to South Vietnam.

On the last leg of her Vietnam-bound voyage, &quot;Tortuga&quot; instituted a stepped-up shipboard defense program consisting of daily general quarters drills, exercising especially with the ship&#x27;s guns and in damage control problems — for the ship had received intelligence reports that a VC rocket attack was expected to coincide with her arrival at Da Nang. When paraflares were sighted on the horizon at 02:00 on 14 March, &quot;Tortuga&quot; knew that she had arrived at her destination and went to general quarters. The expected attack failed to materialize, though, and &quot;Tortuga&quot; unloaded her cargo unmolested but at piers which, only the day before, had been rocketed by the VC. When the offloading was completed, &quot;Tortuga&quot; shifted her berth far away from most of the shipping in the harbor. There, boat crews bent to the task of loading old ammunition on the ship. Meanwhile, one boat crew, composed of one officer and five enlisted men, armed with rifles and Thompson submachine guns, kept a constant vigil in an LCVP which circled the ship at a distance of 60-70 yards. Periodically, at odd intervals, the boat&#x27;s crew would drop percussion grenades in the water in an effort calculated to discourage enemy frogmen. When the task was completed, the ship got underway for the Philippines.

Reaching Subic Bay after an uneventful passage, the ship unloaded the explosives and soon received orders to transport a much-needed suction dredge up the Saigon River to Nhà Bè Base, through territory largely controlled by the VC. At Tan My, &quot;Tortuga&quot; embarked the dredge and a warping tug and got underway. During the transit of the Saigon River, the landing ship stood to general quarters, keeping a sharp eye for enemy attempts to impede the progress of the ship. The enemy failed to appear, however, and &quot;Tortuga&quot;, her dredge, and her tug arrived at Nhà Bè soon thereafter.

From 5 May to 20 May, &quot;Tortuga&quot; participated in Operation Daring Rebel, an operation mounted to seek out and destroy VC rest camps on Barrier Island, south of Da Nang. Joining , and , &quot;Tortuga&quot; closed the beachhead, while stood offshore to provide initial bombardment. When &quot;White River&quot; launched a heavy rocket barrage shoreward, the operation got underway. Landing craft splashed ashore while troop-carrying helicopters quickly airlifted troops ashore in the vertical-envelopment phase of the operation. For the next two weeks, &quot;Tortuga&quot; served as primary control ship for the operation which located and destroyed caches of food and ammunition and VC rest camps.

The landing ship again served as primary control ship (PCS) in Da Nang harbor during Operation Gallant Leader, a follow-up to Operation Daring Rebel. Relieved by &quot;Duluth&quot; on 23 May, &quot;Tortuga&quot; set sail soon thereafter for Buckner Bay and simulated combat landings during exercises with Assault Craft Unit 1 in late June. In July, &quot;Tortuga&quot; transported the first increment of Marines and their equipment for Operation Keystone Eagle, from Cửa Việt Base, South Vietnam, to White Beach, Okinawa, before returning up the Saigon River to Nha Be with a load of palletized cargo.

Subsequently supporting Operation Sea Float, delivering two pontoons and 32 pallets of ammunition from Nhà Bè to Tân Mỹ Base, &quot;Tortuga&quot; onloaded men and equipment from &quot;Charlie&quot; Battery, 1st Light Antiaircraft Missile Battalion (LAAM), 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, at Da Nang harbor for transport to the west coast of the United States. In this last operation, the second increment of Operation Keystone Eagle, &quot;Tortuga&quot; headed &quot;stateside&quot; for the last time, and arrived at Seal Beach, California, on 12 September 1969, unloading the 58 Hawk missiles of the 1st LAAM Battalion, USMC, and then proceeding to the Long Beach Naval Shipyard.
&quot;Tortuga&quot; disembarked her marines and proceeded to pier 7 where she was moored outboard of . On 3 January 1970, &quot;Tortuga&quot; got underway for the Inactivation Facility at Mare Island, where she was decommissioned on 26 January 1970. Transferred to the temporary custody of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) on 6 October 1970, the ship was berthed at Suisun Bay, California, where she was later placed in permanent custody of MARAD on 1 September 1971. She was struck from the Navy list on 15 October 1976.

&quot;Tortuga&quot; was awarded five engagement stars for her Korean War service and eight for service off Vietnam.

From 1983 to 1987 &quot;Tortuga&quot; was used as a target ship and based at Port Hueneme, California. During trials the ship was repeatedly hit by Tomahawk missiles. On 15 December 1987 &quot;Tortuga&quot; ran aground on San Miguel Island after breaking its tow during a storm. The ship was scrapped on site, with the process taking over eight months to complete.

<text>Expedition 2 (also called ISS EO-2) was the second long-duration spaceflight aboard the International Space Station, immediately following Expedition 1. Its three-person crew stayed aboard the station from March to August 2001. In addition to station maintenance, the crew assisted in several station assembly missions, welcomed the first space tourist Dennis Tito, and conducted some scientific experiments.

The crew consisted of one Russian, Commander Yury Usachev, and two American flight engineers Susan Helms and James Voss. The three had been to the station briefly in the previous year, during the 10-day mission STS-101 in May 2000.

The Expedition 2 crew was brought to the station aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; during mission STS-102. The Expedition&#x27;s increment began when &quot;Discovery&quot; docked on 10 March 2001, bringing Expedition 1 to an end. In addition to the Space Shuttle flights which brought the crew to and from the station, there were two visiting Space Shuttle missions and one Soyuz mission which docked with the ISS during Expedition Two.
In August &quot;Discovery&quot; returned to rotate the long-duration crews again, bringing the crew of the next expedition. The Expedition 2 increment ended when &quot;Discovery&quot; undocked from the station on 20 August 2001.

==Crew==

All three crew members had visited the International Space Station together in May 2000 aboard STS-101. In addition to this spaceflight, the Expedition 2 Commander Yuri Usachev also had two other spaceflights, both of which were long-duration missions aboard &quot;Mir&quot; (EO-15 and EO-21).

In addition to STS-101, flight engineer Susan Helms had three other spaceflights, all of which were Space Shuttle missions (STS-54, STS-64, STS-78). James Voss also had three other spaceflights, all of which were Space Shuttle missions (STS-44, STS-53, STS-69).


==Mission highlights==

Expedition 2, the second long-term crew for the International Space Station arrived in March 2001. They returned to Earth on mission STS-105, 22 August 2001 after having spent 163 days aboard the station and 167 days in space. Only Voss performed a spacewalk on STS-101, along with Jeffrey Williams.

During this expedition, research facilities launched to the Space Station included a Human Research Facility, two EXPRESS (Expedite the Processing of Experiments to the Space Station) Racks, one of which contains the Active Rack Isolation System and the Payload Equipment Restraint System. They also prepared the Destiny laboratory to enable upcoming experiments to be conducted.

A major focus was on gaining a better understanding of how to protect crew members from radiation while working and living in space. Radiation exposure in high doses over long periods of time can damage human cells and cause cancer or injury to the central nervous system.

===Launch and docking===

The three-member Expedition 2 crew successfully launched on 8 March 2001 on Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; during mission STS-102. They docked with the International Space Station on 10 March, but the Expedition 2 increment didn&#x27;t begin until the previous crew undocked from the station on 18 March.

===STS-100===

The first visitors to the station during Expedition 2 was the crew of STS-100, when they docked Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; with the ISS on 21 April 2001. They spent eight days docked to the station. The primary objective of this mission was to deliver and install the Canadarm2 on the ISS, which is a robotic arm similar to the Canadarm which is used on some Space Shuttle flights. A later mission in 2002, STS-111, would deliver a movable base platform which would allow the Canadarm2 to have a larger range.
===ISS EP-1===

On the day after the Space Shuttle undocked, the Russian spacecraft Soyuz TM-32 docked to the station, carrying two cosmonauts with previous spaceflight experience, as well as Dennis Tito, the first ever space tourist. This 8 day mission is sometimes referred to as &quot;ISS EP-1&quot;, &quot;ISS-2S&quot;, &quot;Soyuz 2 Taxi Flight&quot;, or simply by its launching spacecraft &quot;Soyuz TM-32&quot;. The Commander of this visiting mission was Kazakh cosmonaut Talgat Musabayev, who had previously been on two long-duration missions aboard the space station &quot;Mir&quot; in the 1990s. The other crew member of ISS EP-1 was Yuri Baturin, who had one other spaceflight, Mir EP-4, which was a visiting mission to &quot;Mir&quot; launched with the spacecraft Soyuz TM-28. Baturin&#x27;s first mission occurred during the long-duration mission Mir EO-25, so he and Musabayev had already been in space together prior to ISS EP-1; in fact both were landed with the spacecraft Soyuz TM-27 in August 1998.

===STS-104===

In July, Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; docked with the station for an eight-day visit as a part of STS-104. The main objective of this mission was to install the Quest Joint Airlock onto the station.

The STS-104 crew performed 3 spacewalks.

;First spacewalk; Joint Airlock Installation

The first spacewalk occurred on 15 July, and focused on installation of the Quest Joint Airlock. The spacewalkers helped as Susan Helms, using the station&#x27;s robotic arm, lifted the new station airlock from Atlantis&#x27; payload bay and moved it to the station&#x27;s Unity module. During much of the 5 hour, 59 minute spacewalk, Jim Reilly worked from a foot platform attached to the end of the shuttle&#x27;s robotic arm, operated by Janet Kavandi. After the spacewalk, crew members inside the Station attached connections to the airlock to prevent thermal damage.

;Second spacewalk

The second spacewalk which happened on 18 July, lasted 6 hours, 29 minutes. The internal hatches between the shuttle and station were closed at the end of Flight Day 6 so Atlantis&#x27; cabin pressure could be lowered in preparation for the second spacewalk. The major objective was to attach and connect an oxygen and a nitrogen tank. Susan Helms operated the station arm to lift the tanks from the shuttle&#x27;s payload bay and maneuver them to the new airlock. At the airlock, Mike Gernhardt and Jim Reilly latched the tanks in place and connected cables and hoses. The spacewalkers were able to get ahead of schedule and also install another oxygen tank, leaving only one tank to be connected on the third spacewalk.

;Third spacewalk

The third spacewalk, which occurred on 21 July, was the first spacewalk based out of the new Quest Joint Airlock, and lasted 4 hours, 2 minutes. Primary objective was to install the final nitrogen tank outside the airlock. This spacewalk tested a new protocol developed by former commercial diver Mike Gernhardt: essentially exercising while breathing oxygen to purge nitrogen from the spacewalkers&#x27; bodies.

===Undocking and landing===

In August, Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; returned to the station during the mission STS-105, which carried the three Expedition 2 crew members back down to Earth. They undocked from the station on 20 August 2001, marking the end of the Expedition 2 increment.

==Mission patch==
The International Space Station Expedition Two patch depicts the Space Station as it appeared during the time the second crew was on board. The Station flying over the Earth represents the overall reason for having a space station: to benefit the world through scientific research and international cooperation in space. The number 2 is for the second expedition and is enclosed in the Cyrillic MKS and Latin ISS which are the respective Russian and English abbreviations for the International Space Station. The United States and Russian flags show the nationalities of the crew indicating the joint nature of the program. When asked about the stars in the background, a crew spokesperson said they &quot;...represent the thousands of space workers throughout the ISS partnership who have contributed to the successful construction of our International Space Station.&quot;

==Science activities==

 Two science racks, known as EXPRESS Racks No. 1 and 2, were delivered to the station in April aboard STS-100. One of the experiments on EXPRESS Rack No. 2 was the Experiment of Physics of Colloids in Space. Several different colloid mixtures were studied, and the analysis is still underway.

<doc id="881099" wikidata="Q1004897" url="?curid=881099" title="Crato, Ceará">
<text>Crato is a city of 130,000 inhabitants on the banks of the river Granjeiro in the south of the state of Ceará, in the northeast of Brazil. It was founded on June 21, 1764 by the Capuchin friar Carlos Maria de Ferrara. Originally it was a small village in which the population were principally native Kariris, it gained official status as a city on October 17, 1817.

The Brazilian city of Crato was named in honor to Crato, a Portuguese town which was founded in the 13th century.

The people of Crato credit their city&#x27;s blossoming to a priest, Padre Cicero, who was outcast from the nearby town of Juazeiro do Norte in the late 1800s and settled in Crato with his various followers thereafter. Various images and statues of the priest can be found around Crato as a sign of appreciation for the priest.

Crato is about 550 km from Fortaleza, the capital of the state of Ceará. Its county has a surface area of approximately 1,117 km2. It is at an altitude of 426m, . Its population of 110,000 makes it the sixth-largest city in Ceará. The economy is a mix of trading and agriculture; , a small industrial park is expanding. The region is rich in minerals, especially gypsum and marble.

Crato has its Roman Catholic Diocese which has contributed to the educational system of the region with schools in the past. For the most recent data (2007) the city has 5.3 in the classification of the development index of basic education (for primary education, IDEB) - this index ranges from 0 to 10. The national average is 3.8 and that of the state of Ceará is 6.1 (the fourth place in the country).

In higher education, in addition to hosting campuses at the Federal University of Cariri (UFCA) and the Federal Institute of Technological Education (IFCE), the city is home to the state institution Universidade Regional do Cariri (URCA), which has around 10,000 students. Several private higher education institutions are active in the city.

The city is surrounded by a tropical wood in the Araripe basin (Serra do Araripe) near the border of the state of Pernambuco. the climate is generally mild, with somewhat more rain than is typical of the region.

Crato is connected to the nearby city of Juazeiro do Norte by a commuter rail line called the Cariri Metro that opened in 2009–2010.

<doc id="881127" wikidata="Q3421106" url="?curid=881127" title="Raymond Ramazani Baya">
<text>Raymond Ramazani Baya (16 June 1943 – 1 January 2019) was a Congolese politician. He served as the foreign minister of that country under the transitional government following his appointment to that post on 23 July 2004, by vice-president Jean-Pierre Bemba, who was allowed to appoint the foreign minister.

== Biography ==
Ramazani was a long-time member of the regime of President Mobutu, most prominently as Minister of Information and as Ambassador to France.

On 23 November 1996, Ramazani was staying in a hotel in Nice, not far from Mobutu&#x27;s Villa del Mare in Roquebrune Cap-Martin when he was summoned by Mobutu to assist at a meeting with Central African President Ange-Félix Patassé. In Menton, he hit two adolescents with his car while driving well above the speed limit. One victim immediately died, whereas the other went in a coma and died shortly thereafter. He quit his position as ambassador, and was condemned to a suspended sentence of two years in prison and a fine of 56,000 FF. 

After the fall of Mobutu in 1997, Ramazani became dissatisfied with the new government of Laurent Kabila. He joined the Movement for the Liberation of Congo, a rebel group based in Gbadolite which was led by Jean-Pierre Bemba. In 2003 the group entered into a transitional government with other rebel groups and the Joseph Kabila government. Bemba became a vice-president and, among other things, was able to appoint the foreign minister. Antoine Ghonda became foreign minister, but Ramazani was by this time an important advisor on diplomacy to Bemba. He became foreign minister in 2004 when Ghonda was sacked. His time in that post ended in February 2007, at the beginning of President Joseph Kabila&#x27;s second term, when the government of Prime Minister Antoine Gizenga took office. He died on 1 January 2019.

<text>Blue Heelers is an Australian police drama series that was produced by Southern Star Group and ran for twelve years on the Seven Network, from 1994 to 2006. Although based around the policing of the town, the series generally depicted the everyday lives and relationships of the residents of Mount Thomas, a fictional small town in Victoria.

The series was one of the highest-rated and most-awarded programs in the history of Australian television, having won 25 Logie awards, and having equal standing with &quot;The Don Lane Show&quot; as the most awarded show in the history of the Logies (with five wins). It is also noted for its two main stars Lisa McCune, a four-time recipient of the Gold Logie, and John Wood, who also won Gold.

== Overview ==
&quot;Blue Heelers&quot; was first aired on 10 September 1993, with the episode &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Place&quot;. The last episode, episode #510 titled &quot;One More Day&quot; aired on 4 June 2006. The series was produced by Southern Star Group for the Seven Network. During its 13-season run it won a total of 32 awards and was nominated for a further 50. This included 25 Logie Awards, five of which were the Gold Logie, the most coveted television award in Australia.

As well as everyday policing matters, the series deals with many controversial and &quot;touchy&quot; subjects. The series was the first to examine the stressful world of young police officers who are &quot;thrown into the deep end where they are left to sink or swim&quot;.

Police procedurals were enormously popular in Australia in the 1960s and 1970s, but by the 1980s they had been replaced by home-grown soap operas and mini-series, like &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot;.

&quot;Blue Heelers&quot;, however, was Australia&#x27;s most popular television drama while it lasted. The series drew more than 2.5 million viewers every week at its peak. Along with the long-running Crawford Productions series &quot;Homicide&quot;, &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; holds the Australian record for most episodes produced of a weekly prime-time drama. It was also nearly the longest-running series, but &quot;Homicide&quot; lasted one calendar month longer and, due to five feature-length episodes, had more time on air.

&quot;Blue Heelers&quot; was sold to 108 territories and gained international recognition in the UK, Ireland, New Zealand, Canada and other countries.

The series launched the careers of many Australian actors, such as Lisa McCune, Grant Bowler, Ditch Davey, Rachel Gordon, Tasma Walton, Charlie Clausen and Jane Allsop. While many of these actors are still best known for their work on &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;, some have gone on to bigger roles. Many other actors of today also appeared in guest roles, including Hugh Jackman, Charles &#x27;Bud&#x27; Tingwell, Peter O&#x27;Brien, John Howard and Robert Rabiah.

John Wood, alongside Julie Nihill remained the only actors with &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; to remain during its entire 12-year run, portraying Senior Sergeant Tom Croydon and publican Chris Riley respectively.

==Plot==
The series primarily focuses on the daily lives of police officers working at a police station in the fictional small town of Mount Thomas in the Australian state of Victoria. Each episode is presented from the perspective of the officers. This was a specific technique that creator Hal McElroy chose to employ.

The police officers, commonly referred to as &quot;Heelers&quot;, are always active sorting out the town&#x27;s many problems. These problems range from trivial complaints such as land and fencing disputes to more serious offences, such as homicides and assaults. The small town is also faced with many other significant occurrences including bank robberies, escaped criminals, police shootings, kidnappings and the acts of deluded criminals. Of these, one of the more significant events is the bombing of the police station during the show&#x27;s twelfth season.

Whenever overwhelmed, the Heelers call on the assistance of the police in the larger town of St Davids, home of the resident police inspector Russell Falcon-Price. An antagonist in the series, Falcon-Price often tries to terminate the employment of the Mount Thomas sergeant or to close the entire station, which in reality would be almost entirely out of his control.

Along with their police work, aspects of the Heelers&#x27; personal lives are regularly featured, notably the relationship between Maggie and PJ, which ends with Maggie&#x27;s death in one of the most watched moments on Australian television.

== Production ==
On average, 42 episodes of &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; were broadcast per year on Australian television, with each episode comprising fifty scenes. One episode was made every week. The scripts were written to a formula which allowed one day for rehearsal, two days on location and two days in the studio. Episodes were shot eight to ten weeks ahead of their scheduled broadcast date. There were 16 episodes in various stages of production at any one time (from the conception of new storylines to post-production). In addition, there were always seven complete episodes waiting to go to air. Apart from the regular cast members, the show employed 4,300 guest actors annually, plus 30 extras every week. A total of 150 people were involved in some way with the show&#x27;s production each week, including cast members, crew, wardrobe, publicists and writers.

=== Conception and development ===
&quot;Blue Heelers&quot; creator/producer, Hal McElroy, conceived the idea of &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; when he heard that an eighteen-year-old friend was planning to become a police officer. Intrigued, he inquired as to why this young boy, fresh out of school, would want to become a police officer, as opposed to the many other opportunities he had open to him. McElroy soon discovered that, at the time, a staggering 60% of Australian police officers were under the age of 26. This, coupled with McElroy&#x27;s desire to create a country cop show, formed the basis of the programme. When this same young officer left the force only a year later due to the shooting death of his colleague, McElroy was even more intrigued to learn about the very fickle, yet rewarding job of policing the community. McElroy continued his quest by asking ex-police officer Michael Winter to write down what it was like to be a city cop who transferred to a country town. These became the ideas that &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; was based around. Michael Winter also conceived the name of the programme by recounting the common names for a country police officer: &quot;tyre-biters&quot;—referring to the fact that country cops are often involved in car chases—and &quot;blue heelers&quot;—referring to their blue uniforms and overall similar appearance and persona to a Blue Heeler dog, a protective and intuitive breed of Australian dog. From the time that McElroy&#x27;s idea was initially conceived, to the time the programme was ready to air, three years passed.

During the early development of &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; two completely different pilots were shot: one depicting the story from the perspective of a police officer and the other from the perspective of a criminal. When these were presented to the Seven Network, the network committed to 13 episodes of the first pilot. The pilot went on to become the official first episode of &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;, telling the story of a new cop in town, Maggie Doyle, and her beginnings in Mount Thomas. Hal McElroy chose to discard the second pilot, realising it was a fatal mistake to be &quot;with the criminals as they plotted the crime&quot;. He also conceived his rule that the producers of the show &quot;couldn&#x27;t have a camera in a room unless there was a copper there as well&quot; (a rule shared by long-running UK Police drama &quot;The Bill&quot;). Hence, the basis of the show being from a police officer&#x27;s perspective became a firm reality. (The only bending of this rule was with scenes featuring publican Chris; as she was billed with the main cast, she was given the same on-screen &quot;rules&quot; as the officers. In early episodes, before she worked at the station, this &quot;rule&quot; also applied to Wayne Patterson&#x27;s wife Roz).

Hal McElroy gives his police adviser&#x27;s opinion:

By creating the programme, McElroy and Morphett hoped to close the gap between to police and the public. They hoped to show the human side of the policing and that, like other citizens, police officers have feelings, regrets, aspirations and fears. They also hoped that the show would act as a tribute to the courage of police officers, who risk their lives everyday, never knowing if they would return home at the end of the day.

=== Filming locations ===
Only about half of the footage for each episode was shot on location. Most of the scenes, including scenes in the police station and pub, were filmed at the Seven Network studios in Melbourne. Much of the filming on location was carried out in towns such as Williamstown, and the more established parts of Werribee. The scenes of the outside of the Mount Thomas police station were actually filmed at the old, disused Williamstown police station, which was then a private residence. Scenes at Mount Thomas High School were filmed at Williamstown High School. The town of Castlemaine was most often used as the backdrop for Mount Thomas, seen in almost every episode. Although the Blue Heelers&#x27; pilot was shot in Castlemaine, the cast and crew very rarely returned there to shoot further episodes; images of Castlemaine were usually just establishing shots. Chris Riley&#x27;s fictional Imperial Hotel, for example, was actually the real Imperial Hotel in Castlemaine. Mount Thomas&#x27; fictional Commercial Hotel was filmed at the Willy Tavern in Williamstown. The second Mount Thomas police station, adopted during the programme&#x27;s reform of 2004, was filmed at Newport Railway workshops. The Mount Thomas Hospital was filmed at the Werribee Mercy Hospital. Sunbury railway station was commonly used as the Mount Thomas railway station.
Hobson&#x27;s Bay, and Wyndham, Victoria were also locations used in Blue Heelers.

=== 2004 revamp: the station bombing ===
After low ratings in 2003 and 2004, the producers and executives of &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; realised that there were apparent problems which could potentially lead to the series&#x27; downfall. In 2004, &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; lost the top ratings spot to &quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot;. During 2003 and 2004, Australian television drama was also at its &quot;lowest point in a decade&quot; and many popular shows were cancelled. As the show remained basically unchanged from its debut ten years earlier, the production team decided that a revamp was in order.

At the beginning of season 11, the revamp began with new, more modern opening credits, using an electric guitar, rather than an acoustic. Later in that season, a live episode, &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;, was broadcast in hope of offering a short-term ratings boost and encourage more long-term viewers. Although an immediate success, the live episode did not bring about a sustained increase in ratings. Producers also hoped that a shift in direction, a change of mood and setting, and the addition of four cast members would cement &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;&#x27; long-term future. They also wanted the show to remain relevant and more accurately reflect today&#x27;s modern world:

The main plot, setting and character changes started in July 2004, with the airing of the episode &quot;End of Innocence&quot;. In this episode, the main storyline was the bombing of the Mount Thomas police station. The blast killed popular main character Snr. Const. Jo Parrish (Jane Allsop) and recurring cast member Clancy Freeman, and injured the show&#x27;s main protagonist, Senior Sergeant Croydon. After the bombing it was revealed that Croydon&#x27;s wife, the Reverend Curtis, was missing. It was later revealed she had been brutally raped and murdered. These events brought about sweeping changes to the mood of not only Croydon but also the mood of the entire show. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; television writer Marcus Casey commented, &quot;Mount Thomas has become a darker, grittier place, the people and cops in it transformed by an invasion of evil&quot;.
Consequently, the story changed its focus from the old Mount Thomas police station to the new one that was used until the show&#x27;s cancellation in 2006. The Seven Network feared that in the modern post-9/11 world, a show about country police was no longer what audiences wanted. Storylines of the proceeding five episodes focused on the bombing of the station and the four new main characters: Rachel Gordon as Amy Fox, Geoff Morrell as Mark Jacobs, Samantha Tolj as Kelly O&#x27;Rourke, and Danny Raco as Joss Peroni. Popular former cast member William McInnes also returned to the show, temporarily reprising his role as Nick Schultz. Producers hoped the new tone of the series, the new younger actors, and McInnes&#x27;s role reprisal would lure back viewers who had stopped watching the programme. This new style of programme that &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; was embracing was a sign of the show trying to keep up with other larger television shows, particularly the &quot;CSI&quot; franchise.

The revamp of the series resulted in a 25% ratings increase, bringing the series&#x27; weekly viewership to 1.6 million people. Critical response after the event was reassuring, and it appeared that critics were approving of the drastic moves by Seven and Southern Star:

=== Cancellation ===
In the hope that viewing would increase, an 11-episode season in 2006 was commissioned by the Seven Network. However, the ratings spike begun in 2004 was not sufficient for the Seven Network to commit to continuing to produce the show. In January 2006, Seven officially announced that they had cancelled &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; but would air a final shortened season of 11 episodes in mid–2006. At the time, the show was still drawing 1.2 million viewers per week on average, down from the 3.5 million it was drawing at its peak. The announcement was front-page news on nearly all of Australia&#x27;s major newspapers, including &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; (Sydney), &quot;The Herald Sun&quot;, &quot;The Age&quot; and Brisbane&#x27;s &quot;Courier Mail&quot;. Two different endings were shot for the final episode, which finished filming on 20 December 2005. The first ending wrapped up all the show&#x27;s storylines, while the second left the show open for another season; the second version was used.

For &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;&#x27; final season in 2006, it was moved from its primetime Wednesday-night timeslot, to a lower-rating Saturday-night timeslot. In the Saturday timeslot, &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; competed with &quot;The Bill&quot;, a British police drama which had become quite popular in Australia on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and Saturday Night AFL Coverage on Fox Footy Channel and Network Ten. This move was slammed by leading cast member John Wood. &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;&#x27; cancellation may also be related to Seven&#x27;s AFL broadcast, which saw Seven invest $780m for the 5-year broadcasting rights of the game.

== Broadcast ==
=== Australia ===
&quot;Blue Heelers&quot; originally aired on Tuesday nights at 7:30 pm on the Seven Network, thus it was limited to a PG content level restriction. When the series was hailed as a success, it began the transition from this timeslot to the 8:30 pm timeslot on the same day. After the move, writers could explore more diverse storylines, as the show was restricted to an M rating. The third and fourth season premiers aired on Monday nights during the 8:30 pm timeslot, but the show moved back to its original slot before the next episode. In its fifth season, &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; moved to the Wednesday night 8:30 pm timeslot, which it occupied for most of its run, until the end of its twelfth season. This move was made to make way for hospital drama &quot;All Saints&quot;.

Starting in 2004, the Seven Network aired &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; weekdays at 2:00 pm. All episodes aired with the final episode airing in 2007. This made way for the broadcast of early episodes of &quot;All Saints&quot;.

Seasons generally ran in Australia from early February to late November. Each season generally consisted of 41 to 42 episodes. The eleventh season however, only consisted of 39 episodes, as the Seven Network had gained the rights to televise the 2004 Athens Olympic Games. In total, 510 episodes were aired: 509-hour-long standard episodes and one live episode. The live episode, titled &quot;Reasonable Doubts&quot;, was filmed to celebrate &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; 10th year on the air. To prepare, the cast was given six days to memorise their lines.

The final episode of the 13th season aired as a 2-hour tribute. It opened with an introduction from John Wood and concluded with a compilation of &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; moments from over its 13-season run.

Australian television quiz-show &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, hosted by Cornelia Frances, also aired a &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; special episode on 9 August 2001. Cast members John Wood, Neil Pigot, Ditch Davey, Jeremy Kewley, Jane Allsop, Suzi Dougherty, Paul Bishop, Caroline Craig and Peta Doodson took part in this special event.

In February 2014, repeats of series 12 started airing; and, in May 2014, repeats of series 13 aired on 7two. &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; has also screened on Hallmark Channel in Australia in various time-slots.

=== International ===
&quot;Blue Heelers&quot; had a strong following not only in Australia but also worldwide; it has been sold to 108 territories and is shown in over 70 countries.

==== New Zealand ====
In New Zealand &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; screened on TV One in a popular timeslot. However, following the on-screen death of Maggie Doyle, ratings fell, and the show was moved to a 9:30 pm slot on Friday. Following that, the show moved to a late night Thursday slot where the rest of the episodes played out, with the show beginning anywhere between 11:30 pm and midnight. It aired its final episode on TV One on 20 March 2008.

In September 2001, season 5 debuted airing weekday mornings at 10:30 am on RTE 1. The 5 episode per week output meant the show quickly caught up with the Australian broadcast, and in 2004, RTÉ dropped back to single weekly episodes airing late night Thursday&#x27;s, typically around 1 am. RTÉ began airing the final season on 30 May 2008 in a late night Saturday timeslot, and the final episode screened on 30 November 2008.
RTÉ began re-airing Blue Heelers weekly from episode one, commencing on 24 June 2009, usually around 4 am Sunday mornings. RTÉ screened all episodes in their original unedited state. The drama proved very popular in Ireland and rated very well.

==== United States ====
&quot;Blue Heelers&quot; aired briefly in the United States of America in the early 2000s on the short-lived cable channel Trio (carried primarily by DirecTV). No episode after number 76 was ever shown in the United States, and when Trio changed their programming in 2004, &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; was dropped from the schedule. The series returned to US airwaves in September 2021 on the new digital network DigiTV, a channel devoted mainly to imported British and Australian series.

==== Canada ====
&quot;Blue Heelers&quot; was broadcast on Showcase in Canada, last airing on 15 May 1998.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom, &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; was broadcast on most of the regional franchises of the ITV Network. At least ten out of the fourteen regional companies that formed ITV aired the first few years of the series and most initially broadcast it in the original hour-long format during the afternoon (with necessary edits to suit the time slot, usually regarding profanity). Some ITV regions edited each episode into two half-hour editions, and stripped these episodes across two or three days. This half-hour format of broadcasting Australian series was well established by ITV with &quot;A Country Practice&quot;. Very early hour-long episodes of &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; also ran unedited later in the evening, around midnight, on both Central and UTV.

Carlton Television and Westcountry Television were the first to broadcast &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;, and they began with three half-hour weekly episodes, Monday to Wednesday, 14:20-14:50, starting from 3 January 1995. Later in the year, they then switched to airing hour-long episodes, 14:20-15:20, on Mondays. Central Television were next to start in February 1995 with a late night 23.40-00:35 slot on Tuesdays, before following Carlton with the half-hour 14.20-14:50 slot on Mondays and Tuesdays from March. Central also reverted to hour long episodes in 1996, usually on Monday and Friday, 14:20-15:15, but went back down to one hourly episode per week in 1997, on Mondays, 13:50-14:45, as the gap with Australian broadcasts narrowed. By 2000, half-hour editions were being aired again, 13:30-14:00, but now on Tuesday and Wednesday, where it remained until 2002. Central were one of the most consistent ITV regions to broadcast &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;, completing series 6 by early 2002. When the three Carlton-owned ITV regions (Carlton, Westcountry and Central) started a uniform programme schedule during 2002, &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; continued to air as two half-hour episodes, and the final batch of episodes shown in these regions were from Season 7, finishing the season on Wednesday, 20 November 2002 (Australian air date: 22 November 2000).

&quot;Blue Heelers&quot; also aired on Anglia Television, Meridian Television and Channel Television, typically Mondays at 14:20-15:15. During the summer school holidays, it was broadcast daily in a morning slot, usually from 11:05, until late 1998. Granada Television and Border Television also screened the series from 1995 in the hour long format but by 1998, these regions had dropped the series. Ulster Television (UTV) began airing &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; in early 1995. The show initially screened 3 times a week, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoons at 13:50-14:20. They then moved it to an hourly 14:20-15:20 slot later in the year. A few episodes also ran at 23:40 on Thursday nights, as they were considered unsuitable for daytime viewing. UTV cancelled &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; in 1998.

Scottish Television began aired hour-long episodes from January 1995, airing on Fridays, Then Tuesday from May until Xmas 1995, the series was dropped as there was no room do to network programmes, 2 editions went out in 1996, the series returned on 9th January 1998 on Fridays until the end of march, then reappeared on 3rd Oct with Eps65 until 19 December. During 1999 From April until early August the series was broadcast at 04.30 most weekday morning before being dropped completely. 

Grampian Television, HTV, Yorkshire Television, and Tyne Tees Television all chose not to purchase &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;, opting for locally made programming instead. 

When the English ITV contractors reformatted as one company in late 2002, regionally-run programmes such as &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; and &quot;Shortland Street&quot; (which were at different points of the series in each region) disappeared from the schedules. No ITV region ever screened the series in full. &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; also aired on an early UK digital and cable channel, Carlton Select, in the late 1990s. Early episodes aired daily, and then in a weekly slot on Fridays at 20.00 as episodes became more recent. Episodes to the later part of the 1997 season were shown before the series was dropped, along with the entire channel shortly afterwards.

=== Critical response ===

Described by critics before its launch as &quot;&quot;A Country Practice&quot; meets &quot;Cop Shop&quot;&quot;, and as &quot;the contemporary cousin of British cop show, &quot;Heartbeat&quot;&quot;, &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; was not anticipated by critics to become a hugely popular programme.

=== Viewership ===
It became a hit TV show soon after it began airing. During most of its broadcast, &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; was very popular in Australia, regularly attracting up to 2.5 million viewers, and up to 3.5 million viewers at its peak. Throughout the show&#x27;s broadcast it continually drew a strong audience, regularly appearing among the top-rating prime time programmes on Australian television. Viewership of Blue Heelers never dropped below 1 million viewers. The episodes &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Fool&#x27;s Gold&quot; (episodes 140 and 141), which aired during the programme&#x27;s fourth season, were two of the most popular &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; episodes. Each drew 2.5 million viewers, considered a huge achievement in 1997.

&quot;Blue Heelers&#x27;&quot; executive producer, Gus Howard believed the show&#x27;s popularity was due mainly to the quality of the cast.

Much of the show&#x27;s sixth season, as well as the first 10 episodes of its seventh season, were the most watched episodes of the series. These episodes focus of the death of Maggie Doyle (played by Lisa McCune). Maggie&#x27;s being shot and left for dead during episode 255, &quot;One More Day&quot;, was ranked by TV Week as the third most memorable moment of a drama series on Australian television.

=== Awards and nominations ===
In terms of awards, Blue Heelers is regarded as one of the most successful programmes on Australian television. &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; has been the recipient of many awards, including 25 Logie Awards, five of which are the prestigious Gold Logie, 3 AFI Television Awards, 3 People&#x27;s Choice Awards, and 1 AWGIE Awards. &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; was nominated for a further twelve Gold Logies. &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; has also won multiple Silver Logies, including numerous Most Popular Actor, Most Popular Actress and Most Popular Programme awards, as well as many Outstanding Awards. Many &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; cast members have also presented awards at the Logies. In the 2005 50 Years 50 Shows poll, &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; was voted 37th greatest show on Australian television and ranked within the top ten dramas.

== Merchandise ==
A CD Album titled &quot;Music From Blue Heelers&quot; was released in 1995. It included the Blue Heelers theme music, plus other songs related to the program, many of them country songs.

The first full &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; novel, &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Story&quot;, was written by Roger Dunn and released in 1997 by Coronet Books. In August 1998, a second novel, &quot;Tom&#x27;s Story&quot;, written by Cassandra Carter was released by Bolinda Publishing.

<doc id="881135" wikidata="Q17181" url="?curid=881135" title="Expedition 1">
<text>Expedition 1 was the first long-duration expedition to the International Space Station (ISS). The three-person crew stayed aboard the station for 136 days, from 2 November 2000 to 19 March 2001. It was the beginning of an uninterrupted human presence on the station which continues as of 2025. 

The official start of the expedition occurred when the crew docked to the station on 2 November 2000, aboard the Russian spacecraft Soyuz TM-31, which had launched on 31 October 2000 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. During their mission, the Expedition 1 crew activated various systems on board the station, unpacked equipment that had been delivered, and hosted three visiting Space Shuttle crews and two uncrewed Russian Progress resupply vehicles. The crew was very busy throughout the mission, which was declared a success.

The three visiting Space Shuttles brought equipment, supplies, and key components of the space station. The first of these, STS-97, docked in early December 2000, and brought the first pair of large U.S. photovoltaic arrays, which increased the station&#x27;s power capabilities fivefold. The second visiting shuttle mission was STS-98, which was docked in mid-February 2001 and delivered the US$1.4 billion research module &quot;Destiny&quot;, which increased the mass of the station beyond that of &quot;Mir&quot; for the first time. Mid-March 2001 saw the final shuttle visit of the expedition, STS-102, whose main purpose was to exchange the Expedition 1 crew with the next three-person long-duration crew, Expedition 2. The expedition ended when &quot;Discovery&quot; undocked from the station on 18 March 2001.

The Expedition 1 crew consisted of an American commander and two Russians. The commander, Bill Shepherd, had been in space three times before, all on shuttle missions which lasted at most a week. The Russians, Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei K. Krikalev, both had previous long-duration spaceflights on &quot;Mir&quot;, with Krikalev having spent over a full year in space.

== Crew ==

The commander, Bill Shepherd, was a former Navy SEAL, whose only spaceflights were on shuttle missions, and at the beginning of the mission his total time in space was about two weeks. Questions had been raised by the Russian space agency about the choice of Shepherd as mission commander due to his lack of experience. Flight engineer Sergei Krikalev had spent over a year in orbit, mostly on &quot;Mir&quot;, and would become the first person to visit the ISS twice. He had felt excitement to have been one of the first people to enter the Zarya module (the first component of the space station) in 1998, during STS-88, and was looking forward to returning. Yuri Gidzenko was designated commander and pilot of the two-day Soyuz mission to the station, had one previous spaceflight, which was a 180-day stay aboard &quot;Mir&quot;.

Shepherd was only the second U.S. astronaut to be launched in a Russian spacecraft, the first being Norman Thagard, who launched on Soyuz TM-21 to visit &quot;Mir&quot; in 1995. Shepherd expected one of the biggest challenges for the ISS would be the compatibility of technologies between Russian and U.S.


== Background ==
The first component of the International Space Station was the &quot;Zarya&quot; module, which was launched uncrewed on 20 November 1998. Between this launch and the arrival of the first crew, five crewed Space Shuttle missions from the U.S. and two uncrewed Russian flights expanded the station and prepared it for human habitation.

Four of the five Shuttle flights focused primarily on delivering and unpacking substantial cargo for future crews. STS-88 launched on 4 December 1998, delivered the &quot;Unity&quot; module, the first component of the US Orbital Segment (USOS) during the mission, the crew spent several hours unpacking and setting up both &quot;Unity&quot; and &quot;Zarya&quot;. Krikalev, who would be a Flight Engineer on Expedition 1 flew on STS-88 and together with Shuttle Commander Robert D. Cabana became the first two people to jointly enter &quot;Unity&quot; and later &quot;Zarya&quot;.

STS-96, in May 1999, delivered of pressurized cargo, of water, and of unpressurized cargo that was attached during a nearly eight hour EVA. Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; visited the station during the STS-101 mission in May 2000. It delivered another of pressurized cargo, and performed station maintenance. Near the end of the mission, they used &quot;Atlantis&quot;’ thrusters to boost the ISS by into a orbit. Three of STS-101’s crew members — Yury V. Usachev, James S. Voss and Susan J. Helms — would visit the station the following year as the crew of Expedition 2.

The &quot;Zvezda&quot; module, the crew&#x27;s living quarters, launched on 12 July 2000 and autonomously docked on the 26th. It was followed by the unmanned Progress M1-3 cargo spacecraft which docked on 8 August. STS-106, in September 2000, connected &quot;Zvezda&quot; to &quot;Zarya&quot;, delivered of cargo including of water, a vacuum cleaner, office supplies, and all of the food for the Expedition 1 crew. In total, the crew spent nearly five and a half days inside the station unloading both the Shuttle and the Progress and setting everything up for the Expedition 1 crew.

While not necessary to the mission of Expedition 1, the Space Shuttle did conduct one additional flight before the crew’s arrival, STS-92 in October 2000, which delivered and installed the first piece of the Integrated Truss Structure along with an additional Pressurized Mating Adapter. This mission would enable future expansion of the USOS.

Prior to Expedition 1, Krikalev expected the ISS to be very similar to his experience on &quot;Mir&quot; ten years previous, due to the physical similarities of the stations&#x27; components.

The launch of the Expedition 1 crew occurred a week before the United States presidential election, so it got little attention in the United States. At the time of the mission, the station was expected to be completed in 2006, and be continuously inhabited until at least 2015. Due to several delays, including the fallout from the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, the station was not completed until 2021, with the arrival of the &quot;Nauka&quot; laboratory.

== Mission highlights ==
The crew of three were on board the International Space Station for four and a half months, from early November 2000 to mid-March 2001. Major events during this time include the three-week-long Space Shuttle visits, which occurred in early December, mid-February, and at the end of the expedition in March.

=== Launch and docking ===

The three-member Expedition 1 crew successfully launched on 31 October 2000, at 07:52 UTC, atop a Soyuz-U rocket on Soyuz TM-31 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan; they used launch pad Gagarin&#x27;s Start, from which the first human to fly in space, Yuri Gagarin, was launched in 1961. After 33 orbits of the Earth, and a series of rendezvous maneuvers performed by Gidzenko, they docked the Soyuz capsule to the aft port of the Zvezda Service Module on 2 November 2000, at 09:21 UTC. Ninety minutes after docking, Shepherd opened the hatch to Zvezda and the crew members entered the complex.

=== Alpha ===
At the end of the first day on the station, Shepherd requested the use of the radio call sign &quot;&quot;Alpha&quot;, which he and Krikalev preferred to the more cumbersome &quot;International Space Station&quot;&quot;. The name &quot;Alpha&quot; had previously been used for the station in the early 90s, and following the request, its use was authorized for the whole of Expedition 1. Shepherd had been advocating the use of a new name to project managers for some time. Referencing a naval tradition in a pre-launch news conference he had said: &quot;For thousands of years, humans have been going to sea in ships. People have designed and built these vessels, launched them with a good feeling that a name will bring good fortune to the crew and success to their voyage.&quot; , the President of Russian Space Corporation Energia at the time, disapproved of the name &quot;&quot;Alpha&quot;; he felt that &quot;Mir&quot; was the first space station, and so he would have preferred the names &quot;Beta&quot; or &quot;Mir 2&quot;&quot; for the ISS.

=== First month ===

In their first weeks on board, the Expedition 1 crew members activated critical life support systems and computer control, as well as unpacked supplies left behind for them by previous supply missions. At this time the station did not have enough electricity to heat all three pressurized modules, so &quot;Unity&quot; was left unused and unheated. &quot;Unity&quot; had been used for the past two years to allow U.S. flight controllers to command ISS systems and read station system data.

The Russian uncrewed resupply spacecraft Progress M1-4 docked to the station on 18 November. The Progress spacecraft&#x27;s automatic docking system failed, necessitating a manual docking controlled by Gidzenko using the TORU docking system. Although manual dockings are routine, they have caused some concern among flight controllers since an attempt in 1997 which resulted in the spacecraft colliding with &quot;Mir&quot;, causing significant damage.

The astronauts had a heavy workload in the first month, as Shepherd told reporters in a space-to-ground interview: &quot;To me, the biggest challenge is trying to pack 30 hours into an 18-hour work day.&quot; Some of the early tasks took longer than scheduled. For example, the activation of a food warmer in Zvezda&#x27;s galley was scheduled for 30 minutes, but it took the astronauts a day and a half to turn it on.

=== STS-97 ===
&quot;Endeavour&quot; docked with the ISS on 2 December 2000, on mission STS-97, bringing four more Americans and a Canadian temporarily to the station. The shuttle also brought the first pair of U.S. provided photovoltaic arrays, which would provide crucial electricity for further development of the station. In total, STS-97 brought 17 tons of equipment to the ISS, which also included expandable metal girders, batteries, electronics and cooling equipment.

Three spacewalks were conducted by the crew of STS-97, all of which were completed prior to opening the hatch between shuttle and station. On 8 December, the hatch between the two was opened and the two crews greeted each other for the first time. It had remained closed to maintain their respective atmospheric pressures. The Expedition 1 crew took this opportunity to leave the station and tour the inside of the space shuttle, which was thought to be good for their psychological well-being.

=== Progress M1-4 ===
Prior to &quot;Endeavour&quot; docking, the Russian resupply spacecraft Progress M1-4, which came to the station in mid-November, was undocked to make room for the space shuttle. This Progress spacecraft remained undocked for the duration of STS-97, parked in orbit about 2,500 kilometers behind the station. It docked manually again with the station on 26 December by Gidzenko, after &quot;Endeavour&quot; left. The automatic docking system for this Progress spacecraft had failed on the first docking in November. The crew spent much of the following week unloading the Progress spacecraft.

=== Christmas and New Year ===
On Christmas Day, the Expedition 1 crew were given the day off work. They opened presents delivered by &quot;Endeavour&quot; and the Progress supply ship. They also each took turns speaking to their families. In the following days they did several video downlinks, some with Russian TV stations. The crew had a quiet New Year. Citing a Naval tradition, for the New Year&#x27;s entry of the station&#x27;s log, Shepherd provided a poem on behalf of the crew.

=== STS-98 ===
On 9 February 2001, Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; docked to the ISS, bringing the five American crew members of STS-98 temporarily to the station. The mission was originally planned for mid-January, but was delayed due to NASA&#x27;s concerns about some cables on the shuttles. This mission brought the U.S. built Destiny laboratory, which has a mass of 16 short tons. It was installed with the use of the shuttle&#x27;s robotic Canadarm, controlled by Marsha Ivins. Astronauts Thomas D. Jones and Robert L. Curbeam helped with the installation during a spacewalk. The &quot;Destiny&quot; module had a cost of US$1.4 billion, and would be used primarily for scientific research. During the spacewalk an ammonia coolant leak created a contamination scare, which happened when Curbeam was hooking up coolant lines to &quot;Destiny&quot;. The other two spacewalks went ahead without any problems. While the Shuttle was docked, the control of the station&#x27;s orientation was switched from propellants to electrically powered gyroscopes, which had been installed in September 2000. The gyroscopes had not been used earlier due to the lack of key navigational electronics.

By the end of STS-98, the crew of Expedition 1 had been on the station for over three months, and Shepherd stated that he was &quot;ready to come home&quot;. NASA used several techniques to prevent the three crew members from suffering the effects of the &quot;three-month wall&quot; psychological barrier, which had caused depression in previous astronauts. For example, they allowed more time for the crew to speak to their families via videophone, and they also encouraged them to watch movies and listen to music they like.

=== Progress M-44 ===
On 28 February the third Progress spacecraft to visit the ISS, Progress M-44, docked to the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module. It brought air, food, rocket fuel and other equipment. It remained docked until Expedition 2, when it was intentionally burnt up during atmospheric reentry, like all Progress spacecraft.

=== STS-102 ===

Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; docked on 10 March 2001, bringing to the ISS the new long-duration three-person crew of Expedition 2, as well as four short-term crew members of STS-102. A few hours after docking, the hatch opened, and all ten astronauts greeted each other, setting a new record for the number of people simultaneously in the ISS. The day after docking, American astronauts Jim Voss and Susan Helms began a spacewalk which ended up being nearly nine hours long, and still holds the record for the longest spacewalk ever performed, as of August 2010. The length of the spacewalk was partially due to some mistakes, including Voss accidentally releasing a small tool. Unable to retrieve it, NASA engineers tracked the tool, and decided to use &quot;Discovery&quot;″s thrusters on 14 March to boost the station four kilometers higher, to ensure the ISS would not collide with the piece of space debris.

=== Transferring expedition crews ===
By 14 March, the expedition crews had completed the change over, but until the shuttle undocked, Shepherd officially remained commander of the station. The morning of the 14th the astronauts&#x27; wake-up call was the song &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go&quot; by The Clash, at the request of Shepherd&#x27;s wife. Shepherd, a former Navy SEAL, said during the change over ceremony: &quot;May the good will, spirit and sense of mission we had enjoyed on board endure. Sail her well.&quot; The commander of &quot;Discovery&quot;, Jim Wetherbee, said &quot;For Captain Shepherd and his crew, we hold you in admiration as we prepare to bring you home. This has been an arduous duty for you. This ship was not built in a safe harbor. It was built on the high seas.&quot;

At about 01:30UTC, one hour before his departure, Expedition 1 Commander Bill Shepherd held a &quot;change of command ceremony&quot; to transfer control of the station to Expedition 2 Commander Yury Usachev.

=== Undocking and landing ===
The crew&#x27;s four and a half-month tour aboard the ISS officially ended on 19 March 2001, when the hatch between &quot;Discovery&quot; and the ISS was closed at 02:32UTC. At 04:32UTC, Mission Specialist Andy Thomas sent a command that released the docking mechanism and springs within the mechanism gently pushed the shuttle away from the station. During the initial separation, steering jets on both the shuttle and station were disabled to avoid any inadvertent firings. Once &quot;Discovery&quot; was about away from the station, shuttle pilot James Kelly, standing at the aft flight deck controls turned the steering jets back on and fired them to begin slowly moving away.

The Expedition 1 crew returned home to Earth on STS-102, landing on 21 March 2001, on a rare night landing at 2:30 am local time. Two days after the landing, coincidentally, &quot;Mir&quot; was intentionally burned up during atmospheric reentry, ending its 15 years in orbit.

== Daily activities ==
In a typical day, each crew member divided his time between physical exercise, station assembly and maintenance, experiments, communications with ground personnel, personal time, and bio-needs activities (such as rest and eating). The crew&#x27;s daily schedule usually operated on UTC; for example, a typical morning had been scheduled to begin with an electronic wake-up tone at about 05:00 UTC. But during the expedition, a more typical wake-up time was actually between 06:00 and 07:00 UTC. The crew&#x27;s sleep habits were sometimes shifted to accommodate the schedules of visiting shuttles or resupply vehicles.

Following the wake-up call, the crew was given some time to clean up, have breakfast, and read e-mail which had been uplinked to them from flight controllers. Their work day included a lunch break at midday (UTC), and ended with a mid-afternoon planning session with flight controllers, regarding the next day&#x27;s activities. Most days ended with some entertainment, with the crew watching all or part of a movie; this was thought to be good for crew bonding as well as their psychological well-being. After watching &quot;2010&quot;, the sequel to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, Shepherd commented, &quot;[There is] something strange about watching a movie about a space expedition when you&#x27;re actually on a space expedition&quot;.

An important part of the crew&#x27;s schedule was regular exercise. They had three pieces of equipment for this: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill (TVIS), and a resistance device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn&#x27;t fixed until March. The treadmill, which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place, was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running. A normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations to shake the station, and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board. The treadmill malfunctioned near the end of February, but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week.

=== Ground communications ===

Until the &quot;Unity&quot; module was available for use a month into the mission, the astronauts used the Russian VHF communications gear (also called the &quot;Regul radio link&quot;) in &quot;Zvezda&quot; and the &quot;Zarya&quot; module to communicate with the Russian Mission Control Center (known as &quot;TsUP&quot;) in Korolev, outside Moscow. The Russian technology didn&#x27;t have the use of satellites, so they were restricted to ground passes (called a &quot;comm pass&quot;) which lasted for only 10–20 minutes. With the arrival of the solar arrays on STS-97, they activated the S-band Early Communication gear in the Unity Module, allowing for more continuous communication with Mission Control in Houston via NASA&#x27;s network of Tracking and Data Relay Satellites.

During STS-106 in September 2000, the equipment for a ham radio was delivered to the station. The first &#x27;ham&#x27; contact with the ground by the Expedition 1 crew was on 13 November 2000 on a pass over Moscow, shortly followed by contact with Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The crew reported that &quot;Voice quality of ham radio continues to be well above any of our other links.&quot;

The &quot;Amateur Radio on the International Space Station&quot; project had the crew of the station to make brief windows to radio contact with schools and clubs on the ground. The first school to be contacted by the ISS was Luther Burbank School in southwest Chicago. The contact had been planned for 19 December 2000, but due to technical problems, it was delayed to 21 December 2000. Due to the speed of the space station, the window of radio contact only lasted for 5–10 minutes, which was usually enough for 10 to 20 questions.

=== Science activities ===
Unlike subsequent expeditions, the crew of Expedition 1 had a somewhat modest amount of science experiments to conduct, due to the priority placed on station construction. The plasma crystal experiment, known as &quot;PKE-Nefedov&quot;, was one of the first natural science experiments conducted on the space station. It was a collaboration between the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany, and the Institute for High Energy Densities (part of the Russian Academy of Sciences).

Like previous missions, the astronauts took many photos of Earth from the station, over 700 in total, which have been made freely available. These &quot;Crew Earth Observations&quot;, are intended to record dynamic events on the Earth&#x27;s surface such as storms, fires, or volcanoes. For example, a photo of 1 January 2001 shows Mount Cleveland, Alaska, with a plume of smoke, prior to its eruption the following month. On 23 January 2001, the crew observed a unique perspective of a plume of volcanic ash coming from Popocatépetl, an active volcano 70 kilometres southeast of Mexico City.

An example of a low-maintenance experiment was the protein crystal growth experiment, which had also been flown on previous shuttle missions. The goal was to produce better protein crystallizations than those produced on the Earth, and hence allowing for a more accurate model of protein structures. Of the 23 proteins and viruses attempted during Expedition 1, only four resulted in successful crystallizations, which was a lower success rate than predicted. Of those successful was the low-calorie sweetener Thaumatin, whose crystals diffracted at a higher resolution than Earth-grown crystal, which resulted in a more accurate protein structure model.

Another research activity was measuring the crew&#x27;s heart rates and the station&#x27;s carbon dioxide levels to determine the effect of exercise on the station.

=== IMAX filming ===
Throughout the mission the Expedition 1 crew filmed footage for use in the IMAX documentary film, Space Station 3D. Highlights of the footage include the first entry into the &quot;Destiny&quot; module, during STS-98; the Expedition 1 crew showering and shaving in zero gravity; and the docking of STS-102, followed by the change over to the Expedition 2 crew.

<doc id="881136" wikidata="Q5005364" url="?curid=881136" title="Fuchsia (color)">
<text>Fuchsia (, ) is a vivid pinkish-purplish-red color, named after the color of the flower of the fuchsia plant, which was named by a French botanist, Charles Plumier, after the 16th-century German botanist Leonhart Fuchs.

The color fuchsia was introduced as the color of a new aniline dye called fuchsine, patented in 1859 by the French chemist François-Emmanuel Verguin. The fuchsine dye was renamed magenta later in the same year, to celebrate a victory of the French army at the Battle of Magenta on 4 June 1859 near the Italian city of that name.

The first recorded use of &quot;fuchsia&quot; as a color name in English was in 1892.

==In print and design==
In color printing and design, there are more variations between magenta and fuchsia. Fuchsia is usually a more pinkish-purplish color, whereas magenta is more reddish. Fuchsia flowers themselves contain a wide variety of purples. Fuchsia was a very popular aesthetic for fashion during the 2000s.

==Fuchsine==
The first synthetic dye of the color fuchsia, called fuchsine, was patented in 1859 by François-Emmanuel Verguin. It was later renamed magenta, and became highly popular under that name.

In the system of additive colors, the RGB color model used to create all the colors on a computer or television display, the colors magenta and fuchsia are exactly the same, and have the same hex number, #FF00FF. The name fuchsia is used on the HTML web color list for this color, while the name magenta is used on the X11 web color list. They are both composed the same way, by combining an equal amount of blue and red light at full brightness, as shown in the image on the left.
==Variations of fuchsia==

===French fuchsia===

At right is displayed the color French fuchsia, which is the tone of fuchsia called &quot;fuchsia&quot; in a color list popular in France.
===Fuchsia rose===
Fuchsia rose is the color that was chosen as the 2001 Pantone color of the year by Pantone.

===Red-purple===
Red-purple is the color that is called &quot;Rojo-Púrpura&quot; (the Spanish word for &quot;red-purple&quot;) in the &quot;Guía de coloraciones&quot; (&quot;Guide to colorations&quot;) by Rosa Gallego and Juan Carlos Sanz, a color dictionary published in 2005 that is widely popular in the Hispanophone realm.

Although &quot;red-purple&quot; is a seldom-used color name in English, in Spanish it is regarded one of the major tones of purple. 
===Fuchsia purple===
The color fuchsia purple is displayed at right.

The source of this color is the &quot;Pantone Textile Paper eXtended (TPX)&quot; color list, color #18-2436 TPX—Fuchsia Purple.
===Deep fuchsia===
Deep fuchsia is the color that is called &quot;fuchsia&quot; in the List of Crayola crayon colors.
===Fandango===
Displayed at right is the color fandango. 

The first recorded use of &quot;fandango&quot; as a color name in English was in 1925.
===Antique fuchsia===

Displayed at right is the color antique fuchsia.

The first recorded use of &quot;antique fuchsia&quot; as a color name in English was in 1928.

The source of this color is the &quot;Plochere Color System&quot;, a color system formulated in 1948 that is widely used by interior designers.
==Crayola color fuchsia==
In 1949, the color names of Crayola crayons were reformed and became more scientific, more of the names of the colors of the crayons being based on the names of colors in the original 1930 edition of the &quot;Dictionary of Color&quot; and the color names of the Munsell color system. Crayola crayons set up a color naming system similar to that used in the Munsell Color Wheel, except that violet instead of purple was used as the secondary color on the color wheel between red and blue. The web color fuchsia is equivalent to the pure chroma on Munsell Color Wheel of the Munsell color system that is designated as &quot;5RP&quot; (&quot;reddish purple&quot;) i.e., a purple that is shaded toward red (the color we can achieve today with computers is a much more saturated pure color wheel chroma hue than the original color chip shown on the Munsell color wheel diagram in the Munsell color system article). In 1972, a new Crayola crayon color was introduced called &quot;hot magenta&quot; which is the closest equivalent to the web color fuchsia in Crayola crayons. (See List of Crayola crayon colors.)

The color shown in the color box above is the color &quot;fuchsia&quot; in &quot;A Dictionary of Color&quot;. That is why the name fuchsia was chosen as the equivalent to one of the three secondary additive primary colors, electric magenta, because &quot;A Dictionary of Color&quot; was the primary reference on color names (besides the &quot;Munsell Book of Color&quot;) before the introduction of personal computers. The color shown above is somewhat brighter than most actual flowers of the fuchsia plant. The color shown as magenta in &quot;A Dictionary of Color&quot; is a somewhat different color from the color shown in that book as fuchsia—it is the original color magenta now called &quot;rich magenta&quot; or &quot;magenta (dye)&quot; (see the article on magenta for a color box displaying a sample of this original magenta).

<text>Monel is a group of alloys of nickel (from 52 to 68%) and copper, with small amounts of iron, manganese, carbon, and silicon. Monel is not a cupronickel alloy because it has less than 60% copper.

Stronger than pure nickel, Monel alloys are resistant to corrosion by many aggressive agents, including rapidly flowing seawater. They can be fabricated readily by hot- and cold-working, machining, and welding.

Monel was created in 1905 by Robert Crooks Stanley, who at the time worked at the International Nickel Company (Inco). Monel was named after company president Ambrose Monell, and patented in 1906. One L was dropped, because family names were not allowed as trademarks at that time. The trademark was registered in May 1921, and it is now a property of the Special Metals Corporation.

As an expensive alloy, it tends to be used in applications where it cannot be replaced with cheaper alternatives. For example, in 2015 Monel piping was more than three times as expensive as the equivalent piping made from carbon steel.

==Properties==
Monel is a solid-solution binary alloy. As nickel and copper are mutually soluble in all proportions, it is a single-phase alloy. Compared to steel, Monel is very difficult to machine as it work-hardens very quickly. It needs to be turned and worked at slow speeds and low feed rates. It is resistant to corrosion and acids, and some alloys can withstand a fire in pure oxygen. It is commonly used in applications with highly corrosive conditions. Small additions of aluminium and titanium form an alloy (K-500) with the same corrosion resistance but with much greater strength due to gamma prime formation on aging. Monel is typically much more expensive than stainless steel.

Monel alloy 400 has a specific gravity of 8.80, a melting range of 1300–1350 °C, an electrical conductivity of approximately 34% IACS, and (in the annealed state) a hardness of 65 Rockwell B. Monel alloy 400 is notable for its toughness, which is maintained over a considerable range of temperatures.

Monel alloy 400 has excellent mechanical properties at subzero temperatures. Strength and hardness increase with only slight impairment of ductility or impact resistance. The alloy does not undergo a ductile-to-brittle transition even when cooled to the temperature of liquid hydrogen. This is in marked contrast to many ferrous materials which are brittle at low temperatures despite their increased
strength.

==Uses==
===Aerospace applications===
In the 1960s, Monel metal found bulk uses in aircraft construction, especially in making the frames and skins of experimental rocket planes, such as the North American X-15, to resist the great heat generated by aerodynamic friction during extremely high speed flight. Monel metal retains its strength at very high temperatures, allowing it to maintain its shape at high atmospheric flight speeds, a trade-off against the increased weight of the parts due to Monel&#x27;s high density.

Monel is used for safety wiring in aircraft maintenance to ensure that fasteners cannot come undone, usually in high-temperature areas; stainless wire is used in other areas for economy. In addition some fasteners used are made from the alloy.

===Oil production and refining===
Monel is used in the section of alkylation units in direct contact with concentrated hydrofluoric acid. Monel offers exceptional resistance to hydrofluoric acid in all concentrations up to the boiling point. It is perhaps the most resistant of all commonly used engineering alloys. The alloy is also resistant to many forms of sulfuric and hydrochloric acids under reducing conditions.

===Marine applications===
Monel&#x27;s corrosion resistance makes it ideal in applications such as piping systems, pump shafts, seawater valves, trolling wire, and strainer baskets. Some alloys are completely non-magnetic and are used for anchor cable aboard minesweepers or in housings for magnetic-field measurement equipment. In recreational boating, Monel is used for wire to seize shackles for anchor ropes, for water and fuel tanks, and for underwater applications. It is also used for propeller shafts and for keel bolts. On the popular Hobiecat sailboats, Monel rivets are used where strength is needed but stainless steel cannot be used due to corrosion that would result from stainless steel being in contact with the aluminum mast, boom, and frame of the boat in a saltwater environment.

Because of the problem of electrolytic action in salt water (also known as Galvanic corrosion), in shipbuilding Monel must be carefully insulated from other metals such as steel. &quot;The New York Times&quot; on August 12, 1915 published an article about a 215-foot yacht, &quot;the first ship that has ever been built with an entirely Monel hull,&quot; that &quot;went to pieces&quot; in just six weeks and had to be scrapped, &quot;on account of the disintegration of her bottom by electrical action.&quot; The yacht&#x27;s steel skeleton deteriorated due to electrolytic interaction with the Monel.

In seabird research, and bird banding or ringing in particular, Monel has been used to make bird bands or rings for many species, such as albatrosses, that live in a corrosive sea water environment.

===Musical instruments===
Monel is used as the material for valve pistons or rotors in some higher-quality musical instruments such as trumpets, tubas and French horns. RotoSound introduced the use of Monel for electric bass strings in 1962, and these strings have been used by numerous artists, including Steve Harris of Iron Maiden, The Who, Sting, John Deacon, John Paul Jones and the late Chris Squire. Monel was in use in the early 1930s by other musical string manufacturers, such as Gibson Guitar Corporation, who continue to offer them for mandolin as the Sam Bush signature set. Also, C.F. Martin &amp; Co. uses Monel for their Martin Retro acoustic guitar strings. The Pyramid string factory (Germany) produces &#x27;Monel classics&#x27; electric guitar strings, wound on a round core. In 2017, D&#x27;Addario string company released a line of violin strings using a Monel winding on the D and G string.

===Other===
Good resistance against corrosion by acids and oxygen makes Monel a good material for the chemical industry. Even corrosive fluorides can be handled within Monel apparatus; this was done in an extensive way in the enrichment of uranium in the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant. Here most of the larger-diameter tubing for the uranium hexafluoride was made from Monel. Regulators for reactive cylinder gases like hydrogen chloride form another example, where PTFE is not a suitable option when high delivery pressures are required. These will sometimes include a Monel manifold and taps prior to the regulator that allow the regulator to be flushed with a dry, inert gas after use to further protect the equipment.

In the early 20th century, when steam power was widely used, Monel was advertised as being desirable for use in superheated steam systems. During the world wars, Monel was used for US military dog tags.

Monel is often used for kitchen sinks and in the frames of eyeglasses. It has also been used for firebox stays in fire-tube boilers.

Parts of the Clock of the Long Now, which is intended to run for 10,000 years, are made from Monel because of the corrosion resistance without the use of precious metals.

Monel was used for much of the exposed metal used in the interior of the Bryn Athyn Cathedral in Pennsylvania, religious seat of the General Church of the New Jerusalem. This included large decorative screens, doorknobs, etc. Monel also has been used as roofing material in buildings such as the original Pennsylvania Station in New York City.

The 1991–1996 Acura (Honda) NSX came with a key made of Monel.

Oilfield applications include using Monel drill collars. Instruments which measure the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field to obtain a direction are placed in a non-magnetic collar which isolates them from the magnetic pull of drilling tools located above and below the non-magnetic collars. Monel is now rarely used, usually replaced by non-magnetic stainless steels.

Monel is also used as a protective binding material on the outside of western style stirrups.

Monel is used by Arrow Fastener Co., Inc. for rustproof T50 staples.

Monel has also been used in Kelvinator refrigerators.

Monel was used in the Baby Alice Thumb Guard, a 1930s-era anti-thumb-sucking device.

Monel is used in motion picture film processing. Monel staple splices are ideal for resisting corrosion from use in continuous-run photochemical tanks.

Monel was latterly widely used to manufacture firebox stays in steam locomotive boilers.

==Alloys==
Monel is often traded under the ISO standards 6208 (plate, sheet and strip) 9723 (bars) 9724 (wire) 9725 (forgings) and the DIN 17751 (pipes and tubes).

===Monel 400===
Monel 400 shows high strength and excellent corrosion resistance in a range of acidic and alkaline environments and is especially suitable for reducing conditions. It also has good ductility and thermal conductivity. Monel 400 typically finds application in marine engineering, chemical and hydrocarbon processing, heat exchangers, valves, and pumps. It is covered by the following standards: BS 3075, 3076 NA 13, DTD 204B and ASTM B164.

Large use of Monel 400 is made in alkylation units, namely in the reacting section in contact with concentrated hydrofluoric acid.

===Monel 401===
This alloy is designed for use in specialized electric and electronic applications. Alloy 401 is readily autogenously welded by the gas-tungsten-arc process. Resistance welding is a very satisfactory method for joining the material. It also exhibits good brazing characteristics. It is covered by standard UNS N04401.

===Monel 404===
Monel 404 alloy is used primarily in specialized electrical and electronic applications. The composition of Monel 404 is carefully adjusted to provide a very low Curie temperature, low permeability, and good brazing characteristics.

Monel 404 can be welded using common welding techniques and forged but cannot be hot worked. Cold working may be done using standard tooling and soft die materials for better finish. It is covered by standards UNS N04404 and ASTM F96. Monel 404 is used in capsules for transistors and ceramic to metal seals and other things.

=== Monel 405 ===
Monel alloy 405, also known as Monel R405, is the free-machining grade of alloy 400. The nickel, carbon, manganese, iron, silicon &amp; copper percent remains the same as alloy 400, but the sulfur is increased from 0.024 max to 0.025-0.060%. Alloy 405 is used chiefly for automatic screw machine stock and is not generally recommended for other applications. The nickel–copper sulfides resulting from the sulfur in its composition act as chip breakers, but because of these inclusions the surface finish of the alloy is not as smooth as that of alloy 400. Monel 405 is designated UNS N04405 and is covered by ASME SB-164, ASTM B-164, Federal QQ-N-281, SAE AMS 4674 &amp; 7234, Military MIL-N-894, and NACE MR-01-75.

===Monel 450===
This alloy exhibits good fatigue strength and has relatively high thermal conductivity. It is used for seawater condensers, condenser plates, distiller tubes, evaporator and heat exchanger tubes, and saltwater piping.

===Monel K-500===
Monel K-500 combines the excellent corrosion resistance characteristic of Monel alloy 400 with the added advantages of greater strength and hardness. The increased properties are obtained by adding aluminum and titanium to the nickel–copper base, and by heating under controlled conditions so that submicroscopic particles of Ni3 (Ti, Al) are precipitated throughout the matrix.

The corrosion resistance of Monel alloy K-500 is substantially equivalent to that of alloy 400 except that, when in the age-hardened condition, alloy K-500 has a greater tendency toward stress-corrosion cracking in some environments. Monel alloy K-500 has been found to be resistant to a sour-gas environment. The combination of very low corrosion rates in high-velocity sea water and high strength make alloy K-500 particularly suitable for shafts of centrifugal pumps in marine service. In stagnant or slow-moving sea water, fouling may occur followed by pitting, but this pitting slows down after a fairly rapid initial attack.

Typical applications for alloy K-500 are pump shafts and impellers, doctor blades and scrapers, and oil-well drill collars, instruments, and electronic components. It is also used in components for power plants, such as steam-turbine blades, heat exchangers, and condenser tubes. In the marine industry, it is utilized in components for marine hardware, propeller shafts, pump shafts and seawater valves exposed to harsh marine environments.

===Monel 502===
Monel 502 is a nickel–copper alloy and its UNS no is N05502. This grade also has good creep and oxidation resistance. Monel 502 can be formed in different shapes, and can be machined similar to austenitic stainless steels.

<text>This is a list of [[giant sequoia]] [[grove (nature)|groves]]. All naturally occurring giant sequoia groves are located in the moist, unglaciated ridges and valleys of the western slope of the Sierra Nevada range in California, United States. They can be found at elevations between .

While many groves are within national park boundaries, such as Sequoia National Park and Yosemite National Park, most of the giant sequoia groves are under the care of the United States Forest Service, placing them outside the legislative mandate that excludes commercial timber harvest. Logging of non-sequoia timber continued as recently as the 1980, especially old-growth ponderosa and sugar pine, which have been logged almost to extinction amongst the groves.

Groves in the northern half of the range (north of the Kings River) are widely scattered and host smaller collections of giant sequoias than groves found within and south of the Kings River watershed. The total area of all the groves combined is approximately . The groves are listed from north to south in the list below.

This list is based on five different sources, with slightly varying views on what constitutes a discrete grove; the differing interpretations are noted &quot;in italics&quot;. The lists of groves were compiled by Rundel (1972; recognizing 75 groves), Flint (1987; recognizing 65 groves), Willard (1994; recognizing 65 groves), the &quot;Giant Sequoia National Monument Visitor&#x27;s Guide&quot; (2003), and the Draft Giant Sequoia National Monument Plan 2010. Currently, the U.S. National Park Service cites Rundel&#x27;s total of 75 groves in its visitor publications. The updated lists from Willard and Flint are now known to be more accurate, therefore some of Rundel&#x27;s 75 groves have been removed from this list. Below compiles a list of 81 giant sequoia groves.

==North of the Kings River==
The 7 groves north of the Kings River watershed are in Tahoe National Forest, Calaveras Big Trees State Park, Yosemite National Park, or Sierra National Forest (listed north to south):
==Kings River watershed==
The 18 groves in the Kings River watershed are in Kings Canyon National Park, the northern section of Giant Sequoia National Monument, or Sequoia National Forest, in southern Fresno County and northern Tulare County (listed north to south):

== Kaweah River watershed==
The 31 groves in the Kaweah River watershed are all in Sequoia National Park or in mixed BLM and private ownership, except the northernmost in Sequoia National Forest &amp; Kings Canyon National Park (listed north to south):
==Tule River, Kern River, and Deer Creek watersheds==
The 25 groves in the Tule River, Kern River, and Deer Creek watersheds are mostly in Giant Sequoia National Monument, with some areas in Sequoia National Park, Mountain Home Demonstration State Forest, and Tule River Reservation; all are in southern Tulare County (listed north to south):

<text>The Pannonian Sea was a shallow ancient sea, where the Pannonian Basin in Central Europe is now. During its history it lost its connections with the neighbouring seas and became a lake. The Pannonian Sea existed from about 10 Ma (million years ago) until 1 Ma, during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs, when marine sediments were deposited to a depth of in the Pannonian Basin.

==History==
The Pannonian Sea, for most of its history, was part of the Paratethys Sea, until about 10 million years ago, when a Miocene uplift of the Carpathian Mountains isolated the sea from the rest of Paratethys. 

During its first historical phase, the Pannonian Sea had a western connection with the Mediterranean Sea through the territories of the modern Ligurian Sea, Bavaria, and Vienna Basin. Through the Đerdap Strait, the Pannonian Sea was linked to the Paratethys in the Wallachian-Pontic Basin. The Pannonian Sea was also attached to the Aegean Sea through the modern Preševo Valley.

The Pannonian Sea existed for about 9 million years. Throughout its diverse history the salinity of the sea often shifted. The decrease of salinity resulted in endemic fauna. Eventually, the sea lost its connection to the Paratethys and became a lake permanently (&quot;Pannonian Lake&quot;). Its last remnant, the Slavonian Lake, dried up in the Pleistocene epoch. The remnants of the former islands of the Pannonian Sea are the modern Pannonian island mountains (Mecsek, Papuk, Psunj, Krndija, Dilj, Fruška Gora, and Vršac Mountains). Despite their location, Lake Balaton and Lake Neusiedl, which appeared during the last 20,000 years, have no relation to the ancient sea.

<doc id="881167" wikidata="Q2747018" url="?curid=881167" title="Al Rosen">
<text>Albert Leonard Rosen (February 29, 1924 – March 13, 2015), nicknamed &quot;Flip&quot; and &quot;the Hebrew Hammer&quot;, was an American baseball third baseman and right-handed slugger for the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball for ten seasons in the 1940s and 1950s.

After serving for four years in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Rosen played his entire ten-year career (–) with the Cleveland Indians in the American League (AL). A stand-out on both offense and defense, he drove in 100 or more runs five consecutive years, was a four-time All-Star, twice led the league in home runs and twice in runs batted in (RBIs), and was an AL Most Valuable Player. Rosen was a .285 career hitter, with 192 home runs and 717 RBIs in 1,044 games. He was selected for the All-Star Game from 1952 to 1955. Rosen appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 1955.

Following two decades as a stockbroker after retirement from baseball, Rosen returned to the game as a top front office executive in the late 1970s, serving the New York Yankees, Houston Astros and San Francisco Giants variously as president, CEO, and general manager. Regarded as a GM who still thought like a player, he became the only former MVP to also earn baseball&#x27;s Executive of the Year award.

==Early life==
Rosen was born in Spartanburg, South Carolina, to Louis and Rose (née Levin) Rosen. His father left the family shortly thereafter, and Rosen&#x27;s mother and grandmother moved the family to Miami, Florida, when he was 18 months old.

Rosen suffered from asthma as a child, which prompted his family to move further south. While growing up, his two favorite baseball players were Lou Gehrig and Hank Greenberg. He attended Riverside Elementary School, Ada Merritt Junior High School, and then Miami Senior High School for a year before attending Florida Military Academy in St. Petersburg, Florida, on a boxing scholarship. After graduating from Florida Military Academy, Rosen enrolled in the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida. He left the university after a semester to play minor league baseball in North Carolina.

Rosen enlisted in 1942, and spent four years in the U.S. Navy fighting in the Pacific during World War II, delaying his professional baseball career. He navigated an assault boat in the Battle of Okinawa. He left the Navy as a lieutenant the following year, returning to baseball.

==Minor league career==
Rosen played for the Pittsfield Electrics, where he was initially given a back-up role. Upon leading the Canadian–American League in home runs (16) and RBIs (86), while batting .323, however, he was bestowed his idol Hank Greenberg&#x27;s nickname, &quot;the Hebrew Hammer&quot;. Rosen played for the Oklahoma City Indians of the Texas League in , and had one of the finest individual seasons in league history. He led all hitters in average (.349), hits (186), doubles (47), extra-base hits (83), RBIs (141), total bases (330), slugging percentage (.619), and on-base percentage (.437). He won the Texas League Player of the Year Award. Rosen played for the New York Yankees&#x27; Kansas City Blues farm team in 1948. He was loaned to the Blues for the duration of the team&#x27;s American Association season as part of a deal that sent reliever Charley Wensloff from the Yankees to the Indians. Rosen was named Rookie of the Year in the American Association for his play with the Blues.

==Major League Baseball career==
Rosen made his first appearance in the major leagues in at age 23. In 1948, Rosen played most of the year in minor leagues with the Kansas City Blues, before joining the Indians in September. He played in the 1948 World Series as a reserve behind regular third baseman Ken Keltner despite only playing five games during the season after the Indians requested his inclusion on the World Series roster. When Keltner was traded in , Rosen took over as the Indians&#x27; third baseman, leading the American League in home runs with 37, hitting more than any previous American League rookie. It stood as the AL rookie record until Mark McGwire surpassed it in 1987. He homered in four straight games in June, a feat unmatched by an Indians rookie until Jason Kipnis in 2011. Rosen averaged a league-best homer every 15.0 at bats, and led the league as well in HBP (10). He batted .287 and had 116 runs batted in, while finishing fifth in the league with 100 walks and a .543 slugging percentage. His 100 walks remained a team rookie record for a right-handed batter, through 2014. He also remained the most recent AL rookie to record at least 100 walks until Aaron Judge in 2017. Despite his home run title, he finished 17th in the American League MVP Award voting.

In Rosen led the league in games played, and was fifth in the league in RBIs (102), extra-base hits (55), and walks (85). He batted .265, with 24 home runs. Rosen hit four grand slams, a team season record that was not broken until Travis Hafner hit five in 2006.

Rosen led the American League with 105 RBIs and 297 total bases in . He also was third in the league in runs (101) and slugging percentage (.524), fifth in hits (171) and doubles (32), sixth in home runs (28), and seventh in batting average (.302). On April 29, he matched the then team record of three home runs in one game, which was surpassed only when Rocky Colavito tied the Major League single-game record with four home runs on June 10, 1959. Rosen came in tenth in the American League MVP Award voting.

In , Rosen led the American League in home runs (43), runs batted in (145), runs (115), slugging percentage (.613), and total bases (367). He also came in second in OBP, and third in hits (201), and tied for eighth in stolen bases. He also had a 20-game hitting streak. Defensively, he had the best range factor of all third basemen in the league (3.32), and led it in assists (338) and double plays (38). His RBI total is still the most for an Indians third baseman, through 2017, and is fourth most for any Indian in a season.

He batted .336, and missed winning the batting title – and with it the Triple Crown – on the last day of the season, by just over one percentage point. He was elected American League MVP by a unanimous vote, the first to be elected unanimously since the original &quot;Hebrew Hammer&quot;, Hank Greenberg.

In the 2001 edition of the &quot;New Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, Bill James named Rosen&#x27;s 1953 season the greatest ever by a third baseman. It is ranked 164th overall, and 48th best by a position player by Baseball-Reference.com as of Rosen&#x27;s passing.

In he hit an even .300, led the league in sacrifice flies with 11, was fourth in SLG (.506), and fifth in home runs (24), RBI (102), and OBP (.404). He also hit consecutive home runs in the All-Star game despite a broken finger, earning him the game MVP. His five RBI in the game matched the record set by Ted Williams five years earlier, which still stood through the 2011 season.

Hall of Fame manager Casey Stengel said of him: &quot;That young feller, that feller&#x27;s a ball player. He&#x27;ll give you the works every time. Gets all the hits, gives you the hard tag in the field. That feller&#x27;s a real competitor, you bet your sweet curse life.&quot; Cleveland won the pennant, but lost the World Series. In spite of Rosen&#x27;s 5th straight year with 100 or more RBIs Cleveland cut his $42,500 ($ today) salary to $37,500 ($ today) for 1955.

In Rosen finished in the top ten in the league in at-bats per home run, walks, and sacrifice flies. By 1956, back problems and leg injuries caught up with Rosen and he retired at age 32 at the end of the season.

==After baseball==
After retiring in Rosen pursued a career as a stockbroker, an occupation he held for the next 22 years.

In 1973, Rosen left investments for Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, where he worked for five years.

==Baseball executive==
In 1978, Rosen became president and CEO of the New York Yankees. They won the 1978 World Series, but Rosen quit on July 19, 1979. Tommy John thought he left because owner George Steinbrenner had replaced Bob Lemon, a friend of Rosen&#x27;s, with Billy Martin as the team manager a month before. The two had made a pact to stick together against Steinbrenner (rather than have a Rosen serve as a go-between for feuds) by the mid-summer of 1978, but the combination of Martin&#x27;s resignation later that year and subsequent return made it impossible for Rosen to continue; the final straw was when Rosen wanted a game to start earlier to accommodate a national telecast, but Steinbrenner sided with Martin, who wanted it to start on time. Rosen served as a supervisor of credit operations at Bally&#x27;s in Atlantic City before a loan going sour led to him resigning.

Rosen then served as team president and general manager of the Houston Astros (1980–1985). Rosen was hired two weeks after the 1980 season ended for the Astros by owner John McMullen, who in a controversial decision had fired Tal Smith despite forming a core that won the National League West title. From 1981 to 1985, the Astros went 386–372 with one playoff appearance [1981 NLDS] before a mutual agreement was reached by both as Rosen departed in September 1985.

He was hired as president and general manager by Bob Lurie of the San Francisco Giants a week after he left the Astros, where he would serve until 1992. Notably, one of his first actions was to remove the television and stereo systems from Candlestick Park as a means to have the players totally focused on baseball. Roger Craig was retained as manager after taking over for Jim Davenport in September, complete with Rosen allowing Craig full control. Through acquisitions (such as Rick Reuschel) and promoting draft picks such as Will Clark, Rosen and his maneuvering brought San Francisco from last place in to the NL West title in and the National League pennant in , earning him the National League Executive of the Year honors. Regarded as a GM who still thought like a player, he became the only MVP in history to also earn the top executive award. The Giants went 589–475 with Rosen as general manager. An announcement of the sale of the team by Lurie in June 1992 (which was bought by Peter Magowan in January 1993 after a scuttled sale to Florida investors) precluded the departure of Rosen, who resigned in late November 1992. He was replaced by Bob Quinn. Quinn fired Craig as manager the following month. To replace him, Quinn named Dusty Baker as manager; Rosen had hired him to serve as first base coach of the Giants in 1988 after telling him he would be better suited for the role rather than assistant general manager.

In 1979, Rosen appeared with Spec Richardson (general manager of the San Francisco Giants) in a television commercial entitled &quot;Baseball Executives&quot; for Miller Lite, as one of the commercials in the legendary &quot;Great Taste, Less Filling&quot; advertising campaign. The idea was two major league high-level baseball executives are discussing a big trade in a formal, stuffy members only club, only to reveal that they are actually trading baseball cards much like a couple of children, ending on a throw-down of a bunch of baseball cards on the polished wooden table. The commercial ran heavily during the summer of 1979 along with every game of the World Series that year.

==Personal life==
Rosen&#x27;s wife of 19 years, the former Teresa Ann Blumberg, died on May 3, 1971. He remarried to second wife, Rita (née Kallman) several years later. He had three sons, and a stepson and stepdaughter. Rosen occasionally consulted for baseball teams, including a stint with the Yankees as special assistant to the general manager in 2001 and 2002. He was featured in the 2010 movie narrated by Dustin Hoffman, &quot;Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story&quot;.

Rosen died on March 13, 2015, in Rancho Mirage, California.

==Jewish heritage==
Rosen was Jewish. He was tough, an amateur boxer, and had a reputation for standing up to anyone who dared insult his ancestry. While some reports have him commenting that, as a minor leaguer, he wished his name were something less obviously Jewish, he is later known to have remarked that he wished it were &quot;more&quot; Jewish—something like Rosenstein. When Ed Sullivan, himself a Catholic with a Jewish wife, suggested that Rosen might be Catholic, pointing to his habit of drawing a &quot;cross&quot; in the dirt with his bat, Rosen said the mark was an &quot;x&quot; and told Sullivan he wished his name were more Jewish so he wouldn&#x27;t be mistaken for Catholic.

Once a White Sox opponent called him a &quot;Jew bastard&quot;. Sox pitcher Saul Rogovin, also Jewish, remembered an angry Rosen striding belligerently to the dugout and challenging the &quot;son of a bitch&quot; to a fight. The player backed down.

Rosen challenged another opposing player who had &quot;slurred [his] religion&quot; to fight him under the stands. And during a game, when Red Sox bench player Matt Batts taunted Rosen with anti-Semitic names, Rosen called time and left his position on the field to confront Batts. Hank Greenberg recalled that Rosen &quot;want[ed] to go into the stands and murder&quot; fans who hurled anti-Semitic insults at him.

A 2010 documentary, &quot;Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story&quot;, highlighted Rosen, who in it is frank about how he dealt with anti-Semitism: &quot;There&#x27;s a time that you let it be known that enough is enough. ... You flatten [them].&quot;

During his career, Rosen refused to play on the High Holy Days, as would baseball Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax, arguably the most famous American Jewish baseball player.

Through 2014, he was fifth in career home runs (behind Sid Gordon), seventh in RBIs (behind Ryan Braun), and tenth in hits (behind Mike Lieberthal) among all-time Jewish major league baseball players.

<text>Sally Patricia Oldfield (born 3 August 1947) is a singer-songwriter. She is the sister of composers Mike and Terry Oldfield.

==Early life==
Born in Dublin, Ireland, Oldfield was raised in the Roman Catholic faith of her mother, Maureen. Spending her childhood in Reading, Berkshire, Oldfield studied ballet from the age of four and won numerous competitions in all styles of dance, including ballet, tap and modern. At the age of 11, she won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dancing, then located in Holland Park, London, and two years later was starred to move on to the Royal Ballet School at White Lodge. However, she gave up ballet two years later, and achieved three A-Levels at Grade A. She studied classical piano to Grade 7. All her school years were spent at St Joseph&#x27;s Convent School, Reading, where she became friends with Marianne Faithfull. Oldfield read English Literature and Philosophy at Bristol University.

==Musical career==
Oldfield&#x27;s musical career started in 1967. While studying in Bristol she used to sing in the Bristol Troubadour Club, and was on the bill of a folk concert at the Colston Hall supporting the Strawberry Hill Boys (later Strawbs) and Fred Wedlock on 30 April. In early 1968 she made some demo recordings with her younger brother Mike Oldfield. These sessions were suggested and overseen by Mick Jagger. It is not known what became of those recordings.

Soon after this she founded the folk music duo the Sallyangie together with her brother Mike. The duo was signed to Transatlantic Records and recorded their only album at the recommendation of Pentangle band guitarist, John Renbourn, whom Oldfield met at the Bristol Troubadour Club. The album &quot;Children of the Sun&quot; was recorded in August 1968. The songs on it are mainly co-written by Sally and Mike Oldfield, and the album contained some of her brother&#x27;s early guitar work. Guesting were Terry Cox on drums and Ray Warleigh on flute.

Oldfield&#x27;s first mainstream recorded release was by a Finnish bass player named Pekka Pohjola. This album was mainly recorded at her brother&#x27;s studio Througham Slad, Gloucestershire, between 22 November and 5 December 1976, and was originally released in 1977 as &quot;Keesojen Lehto&quot; by Pekka Pohjola. Later different labels translated the titles and changed the artist&#x27;s name due to the name recognition of Mike Oldfield.

Oldfield&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Water Bearer&quot;, was released in 1978. Her song, &quot;Mirrors&quot;, was on the album. It peaked at No. 19 in the UK Singles Chart, spanning 1978 and 1979, and remained in that chart for 13 weeks. The song also peaked at number 88 in Australia.

Since then, she has released fifteen solo albums.

On the demise of her record label Bronze Records in 1984, Oldfield relocated to Germany and based her musical career there. Most of her albums from 1983 onwards were not released in the UK. She worked with many German record producers and musicians, including Gunther Mende and Candy DeRouge. Oldfield regularly appeared on national television and radio, and undertook several European concert tours, the last being in Germany in 2003.

==Guest appearances==
Oldfield provided background vocals in sections of brother Mike&#x27;s 1970s albums &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;, &quot;Ommadawn&quot; and &quot;Incantations&quot;. She reprised her role on &quot;Tres Lunas&quot; in 2002 and for the 2003 re-recording, &quot;Tubular Bells 2003&quot;. In addition, she worked on her other brother Terry&#x27;s recordings. She sang &quot;Shadow of the Hierophant&quot; on Steve Hackett&#x27;s 1975 album, &quot;Voyage of the Acolyte&quot;.

<text>Fruit of the poisonous tree is a legal metaphor used to describe evidence that is obtained illegally. The logic of the terminology is that if the source (the &quot;tree&quot;) of the evidence or evidence itself is tainted, then anything gained (the &quot;fruit&quot;) from it is tainted as well.

==United States==
The doctrine underlying the name was first described in &quot;Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States&quot;, 251 U.S. 385 (1920). The term&#x27;s first use was by Justice Felix Frankfurter in &quot;Nardone v. United States&quot; (1939).

Such evidence is not generally admissible in court. For example, suppose a police officer obtained a key to a train station locker in the process of conducting a search of a home that was unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the Fourth Amendment. Any evidence of a crime that came from that locker would most likely be excluded under the &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; legal doctrine. The testimony of a witness who is discovered through illegal means would not necessarily be excluded, however, due to the &quot;attenuation doctrine&quot;, which allows certain evidence or testimony to be admitted in court if the link between the illegal police conduct and the resulting evidence or testimony is sufficiently attenuated. For example, a witness who freely and voluntarily testifies is enough of an independent intervening factor to sufficiently &quot;attenuate&quot; the connection between the government&#x27;s illegal discovery of the witness and the witness&#x27;s voluntary testimony itself. (&quot;United States v. Ceccolini&quot;, 435 U.S. 268 (1978))

The &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; doctrine is an extension of the exclusionary rule, which, subject to some exceptions, prevents evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment from being admitted in a criminal trial. Like the exclusionary rule, the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine is intended to deter police from using illegal means to obtain evidence.

The doctrine is subject to four main exceptions. The tainted evidence is admissible if:
# it was discovered in part as a result of an independent, untainted source; or
# it would inevitably have been discovered despite the tainted source; or
# the chain of causation between the illegal action and the tainted evidence is too attenuated; or
# the search warrant was not found to be valid based on probable cause, but was executed by government agents in good faith (called the good-faith exception).

==Contrasting doctrine==

===Australia===
The American doctrine of the fruit of the poisonous tree has generally been rejected by the courts and legislators in Australia. Courts have tended to reject evidence where there is serious risk of unreliability, but where evidence is obtained unlawfully or improperly, the interest in deterring the police from unlawful, improper, or unfair treatment of the accused is balanced against the public interest in ensuring that those who commit crimes are brought to justice, and the seriousness of the crimes committed. Improperly obtained evidence is therefore several times more likely to be excluded from less serious offences like drug possession or disorderly conduct than from more serious ones like robbery and murder.

===India===
English courts have relied on an 1861 verdict, &quot;R v Leathem&quot;, to admit evidence irrespective of the legality of the source. This is the general stance.
Drawing on the English tradition, the doctrine does not have a parallel in India and courts will admit evidence, even if it is illegally obtained (stolen, etc.), especially if it will help prove guilt or innocence. While the quality of the evidence may be suspect, the position that the evidence should not be considered at all is not a position Indian courts take.

There are other considerations as to the admissibility of the evidence, such as whether it was extracted under duress or other violation of human rights including privacy in modern times, or &quot;if its prejudicial effect on the jury was likely to outweigh its probative value&quot;. However, this article deals only about cognisance in case the source of the evidence itself may be unlawful.

The Supreme Court of India, the highest appellate and constitutional court of India, has dealt with the matter multiple times, decisively so in 1971, ruling against the applicability of this doctrine in India.

In the 2019 Rafale deal controversy, the Attorney General K. K. Venugopal argued in front of a three-member bench of the court, which included the sitting Chief Justice, that official, classified documents stolen from the government – which happened to be integral to the case in question – should not be taken cognisance of by the court, as they were classified, and the stealth and subsequent leakage to a newspaper was a crime under the Official Secrets Act. K M Joseph, from the bench, noted that &quot;even stolen evidence can be looked into by the Court. It is well settled under Evidence Act&quot;, while the Chief Justice, Ranjan Gogoi, queried whether it would be correct for the court to ignore the claim of an alibi (of an accused) if it were based on stolen evidence. The third constituent of the bench, Sanjay Kaul, further noted that even if the Attorney General&#x27;s argument were correct, any evidence would be admissible if it would shock the conscience of the court.

Admissibility of evidence in Indian courts hinges primarily on relevance and then on the source. The Supreme Court, especially, is empowered by the Constitution of India to have &quot;any&quot; document produced before it. In fact, in the 1971 verdict touched upon above, the Supreme Court decision relies on &quot;R v Leathem&quot; (1861).

However, considerations of protection against self-incrimination – a right guaranteed by the Constitution – are taken into account and evidence obtained under duress will be grounds to reject its validity, but not the legality of the source alone.

===Ireland===
In Ireland the only absolute prohibition on admitting illegally-obtained evidence is where the evidence was &quot;knowingly&quot; obtained in breach of constitutional rights. Evidence obtained in breach of constitutional rights where this breach was inadvertent, or where it was illegal but not in breach of &quot;constitutional&quot; rights, may be admitted.

===Sweden===
The judicial system in Sweden follows a principle of &quot;fri bevisprövning&quot;, i.e. &quot;&quot;, where all sides may announce and use any and all evidence available, regardless of the source or how it was obtained. It is then up to the court to evaluate the evidence via the principle of &quot;free evaluation of evidence&quot;, &quot;Fri bevisvärdering&quot;. If a crime was committed when acquiring the evidence, it may still be used in the trial and the accused party may still be tried later for the crime. At the same time, the court may take the crime into consideration when evaluating the value and impact of the evidence.

<text>Spalding is an unincorporated community in the northwest United States, located in northern Nez Perce County, Idaho.

==Description==
The community is located east and upstream of Lewiston, on the Clearwater River, at the mouth of the Lapwai Valley. U.S. Route 95 runs through the community and has a junction with U.S. Route 12 just west of town. Spalding is part of the Lewiston, ID-WA Metropolitan Statistical Area. The village was named after Reverend Henry Spalding, a missionary who taught the neighboring Nez Percé irrigation.

The headquarters and visitor center for the Nez Perce National Historical Park are located at Spalding.

This place is notable as the birthplace of Lillian Disney, the wife of Walt Disney.

In the 1966 film &quot;El Dorado&quot;, John Wayne rode a six-year-old Appaloosa stallion named Zip, from Spalding.

<text>Albert Karl Ludwig Gotthilf Günther , also Albert Charles Lewis Gotthilf Günther (3October 18301February 1914), was a German-born British zoologist, ichthyologist, and herpetologist. Günther is ranked the second-most productive reptile taxonomist (after George Albert Boulenger) with more than 340 reptile species described.

==Early life and career==
Günther was born in Esslingen in Swabia (Württemberg). His father was a &quot;Stiftungs-Commissar&quot; in Esslingen and his mother was Eleonora Nagel. He initially schooled at the Stuttgart Gymnasium. His family wished him to train for the ministry of the Lutheran Church for which he moved to the University of Tübingen. A brother shifted from theology to medicine, and he, too, turned to science and medicine at Tübingen in 1852. His first work was &quot;Ueber den Puppenzustand eines Distoma&quot; (On the pupal state of &quot;Distoma&quot;). He graduated in medicine with an M.D. from Tübingen in 1858, the same year in which he published a handbook of zoology for students of medicine. His mother moved to England, and when he visited the country in 1855, he met John Edward Gray and Professor Richard Owen at the British Museum. This led to an offer to work at the British Museum in 1857, where his first task was to classify 2000 snake specimens. After the death of John Edward Gray in 1875, Günther was appointed Keeper of Zoology at the Natural History Museum, a position he held until 1895. The major work of his life was the eight-volume &quot;Catalogue of Fishes&quot; (1859–1870, Ray Society). He also worked on the reptiles and amphibians in the museum collection. In 1864, he founded the &quot;Record of Zoological Literature&quot; and served as editor for six years. He was one of the editors for the &quot;Annals and Magazine of Natural History&quot; for more than thirty years. His landmark paper on tuatara anatomy was the first to establish that the tuatara reptile was not a lizard, but in fact the only living member of an entirely new group of reptiles, which he named Rhynchocephalia. Fossil and genetic evidence have subsequently confirmed Günther&#x27;s assertion, and the tuatara is now recognised as the only living member of a once diverse lineage that shared a common ancestor with Squamata (lizards and snakes) over 240 million years ago.

Günther was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1867 and served as vice-president 1875–6. He served on the council of the Zoological Society for nearly 40 years (1868–1905). He was elected a fellow of the Linnaean Society in 1877 and was president 1896–1900. He became a naturalised British citizen in 1874. Günther died at Kew Gardens on 1 February 1914.

==Family==
Günther was the son of Friedrich Gotthilf Günther (1800–1835) and Eleonora/Eleonore Louise née Nagel (1806–1899). 

He married, firstly, in 1868, Roberta Mitchell née McIntosh (1842–1869), sister of William M&#x27;Intosh. They had one son, the historian Robert William Theodore Günther (1869–1940). Roberta died shortly after his birth.

In 1879 he married again, to Theodora Dowrish née Drake (1863–1944). They had a son Frederic Albert Günther (1883–1953), a merchant; and a daughter Theodora Alberta Günther (1889–1908) who died aged nineteen.

<doc id="881230" wikidata="Q8047223" url="?curid=881230" title="Yakubu II">
<text>Yaa Naa Yakubu Andani II (1945–2002) was the King of Dagbon, the traditional kingdom of the Dagomba people in northern Ghana, from 31 May 1974 until his assassination on 27 March 2002. He was born in August 1945 in Sagnarigu, a suburb of Tamale in the Northern Region of Ghana. Yakubu II was killed on 27 March 2002 at Yendi, the capital of the Kingdom of Dagbon, by unknown people when clashes broke out between the two feuding Gates of Dagbon Kingship. For 600 years the Abudu and Andani clans, named after two sons of the ancient Dagbon king Ya Naa Yakubu I, cordially rotated control of the kingdom centred in Yendi, north of Accra, the capital of Ghana. A regent (installed on 21 April 2006) acted as sovereign of the kingdom until 18 January 2019 when a new ruler is chosen to occupy the revered Lion Skins of Yendi (Yaan Naa Gariba II) .

==Overview==
After three days of unrest and sporadic violence, Gbewaa Palace, the residence of the king together with thirty surrounding houses were burned down. Thirty members of his household and other members of the community were killed and several others injured. The king&#x27;s body was dismembered and decapitated after he was killed and set on fire. His head was paraded on a spear and parts of his body were paraded around town. Nobody has been jailed in relation to the incidence (January 2014).

Minister of State, Jake Obetsebi-Lamptey, announced his death on March 27, 2002. News of his death and the gruesome manner in which it took place shook the entire country and has since affected the lives of Dagombas in Ghana and beyond in diverse ways especially with regard to their political affiliations. Dagbon citizens who occupied prominent government positions were inescapably caught up in the dispute. Some ministers and government appointees resigned under the heat of the dispute. Aliu Mahama, then Vice President of Ghana, vehemently refused to comment on the matter. Death of Yakubu II set a lot of Dagombas against the Government of John Agyekum Kufuor (incumbent 2002), further deepening the common asseveration that Dagombas are more generally sympathetic towards the National Democratic Congress than the New Patriotic Party.

Many Ghanaians accused the government of not supporting Yaa Naa Yakubu II enough and so made his assassination possible. Former President Jerry John Rawlings is at the forefront of such accusations stating that he has evidence to support his claims and wishes to be given the platform to expose the contrivers of the assassinations. Alex Segbefia, one time deputy Chief of Staff, said that the New Patriotic Party was to blame for the conflict. John Agyekum Kufuor, then president of the country and leader of the New Patriotic Party, however, has always disassociated himself from such allegations. In spite of state of affairs, John Agyekum Kufuor was reelected on December 7, 2004, amazing votes in Yendi and Gushiegu parliamentary constituencies, which have strong representation of supporters of Abudu Royal Gate, whiles the rest of Dagbon and most of Northern Ghana voted overwhelmingly for the National Democratic Congress, snatching away some New Patriotic Party parliamentary seats in the process.

==Early life==
Yaa Naa Yakubu II (1945–2002) was born in August 1945 at Sagnarigu, a suburb of Tamale in present-day Northern Ghana. His father was Andani Zolikuɣuli, also a previous king of Dagbon who reigned from 1968 to 1969, and his mother was Faati Mahama, who hailed from Savelugu. He was named after his Great-grandfather, Yaa-Naa Yakubu I (1824–1849). He was his father&#x27;s eldest son and the only child of his mother. He attended Yendi primary and middle schools and taught as a pupil teacher for several years.

Before he became Yaa Naa, he had already married three wives; shortly after his inauguration, they were sent to &quot;Zohi&quot;, a suburb of Yendi, where they were conferred with titles. The first wife obtained the title &quot;Gbanzalun&quot;, the second wife became &quot;Katini&quot;, while the third one was given the title &quot;Sologu&quot;. By the time of his death in March 2002, Yaa Naa Yakubu II had 26 wives, and each of them was similarly conferred with titles in accordance with Dagomba tradition. He was survived by 103 children including Kampakuya Naa Abdulai Yakubu Andani; his first son and caretaker king of Dagbon.

==Events of the massacre at Yendi==

The perpetrators are believed to have been an assassination squad of Liberian mercenaries brought to Yendi to incapacitate the Yaa-Naa and his bodyguards, paving way for the local militia of Abudu Gate to finish him off. Eyewitnesses say they numbered around 50 and were armed with sub-machine guns, rifles, and hand grenades.

On the day of the incident, all means of communication to Yendi were hijacked. All thought the seizure of the Gbewaa Palace and attack on Yaa-Naa Yakubu II by the hired assassins and members of Abudu family took several hours to complete amidst firing of heavy artillery, incessant pleas made by the Yaa-Naa to a police station under 2 minutes walk away to come and contain the situation was declined. Some occupants of the palace who managed escape to the station for protection were turned away by the police. A number of such persons were assaulted by the police and handed over to the Abudus to be shot. By way of calculated interferences in communication by means of electricity or telephone to the rest of the world, Yaa-Naa was left to his own fate. It appears the king was designedly cordoned in his palace alongside his eminent chiefs and some members of his family and friends who were with him. He was bombarded with firepower and grenades by the armed assassins till his bodyguards and brave young men in his household who swore to protect him were all taken out. At that time, the mercenaries having completed their task, disappeared into thin air. His palace and surrounding houses was burned to ruins. That was when the local militia from Abudu Family took over. Yaa-Naa Yakubu II was killed and mutilated alongside some of his elders.

Twenty-two members of Andani Family were brutally murdered whiles others were severely maimed. The king slayers made away with parts of his body including his head they had decapitated. The vicinity was charged with wild jubilations among members of Abudu Gate amid drumming, dancing and singing Dagomba war victory songs. Famous triumphal rhythm Bangumanga could be heard on loud Talking drum from the house of the leader of Abudus, Bolin Lana Mahamadu Abduliai where the severed head of the Yaa-Naa was presented him. Dagomba talking drums are capable of being heard across the capital of the kingdom (Yendi) and beyond.

==Aftermath of Yaa-Naa Yakubu II&#x27;s death==
A new ruler of Dagbon cannot be chosen until his predecessor is buried. A pathologist from the 37 Military Hospital confirmed that the body of Yaa-Naa Yakubu II is incomplete; his head, a hand or a foot were detached from the rest of his body. However the severed head and hand of the king were mysteriously returned to the Yendi District Hospital Morgue where the body was kept by an unknown person.

The burial of the king finally took place on Monday 10 April 2006 after a compromise reached between the Andanis and the Abudus concerning his successor. The king was given a state burial in the royal musuleum at the Gbewaa Palace in Yendi. The elder son (Zuu) of the king was enskined as the Regent of Dagbon on 21 April 2006 to manage the affairs of the kingdom until the final funeral rites when a new Yaa-Naa will be enskined. The traditional title of the Regent is Kampakuya Naa Abdulai Yakubu Andani. His successor is Yaa-Naa Abdulai Yakubu. On 29 May 2011, a court in Accra acquitted and discharged 15 persons who were accused of murdering the Ya-Naa. This sparked violent protests in Dagbon and other parts of the country.

The late king of Dagbon was survived by 103 children.

==Names in the spotlight surrounding the conflict==
*Yidana Sugri. He hung the dismembered arm around his neck and dared anyone to remove it.
*Iddrisu Jahinfo. He carried the dismembered head around and at some point was kicking it like a football whiles proclaiming himself the sole and actual slayer of the late king.
*Constable Nyarkotey Adjetey. He and his colleagues arrested escapees of the palace that was under fire attack, assaulted them and handed them over to be shot by Abudu fighters.
*Zakaria Forest. Alleged to have cut off the head and hands of the Yaa-Naa. He is currently at large (January 2014).
*Sau Billa. Earliest known initiator of gunfire towards the Gbewaa Palace.
*Mohammadu Abdulai. He and Sani Moro dragged the body. 
*Mohammed Habib Tijani, former District Chief Executive (DCE) of Yendi and one of prime suspects of Yaa-Naa&#x27;s Murder. He is taught to be the mastermind behind the interruption in communications in Yendi on day of murder as well as preventing the police force moving in to save the King as he was under attack. A witness against him in court revealed he continuously lambasted the Yaa-Naa for being an arrogant person (by refusing to flee his Palace) and got himself killed as a result.
*Major (rtd) Abubakar Suleimana, some survivors of the Yendi massacre identified Major Sulemana leading what is believed to be dozens of heavily armed Liberian mercenaries in the attack on the Yaa-Naa&#x27;s palace. He was again spotted fleeing the country to Burkina Faso in the company of the Liberian mercenaries after the attack. 
*Lieutenant General Joshua Mahamadu Hamidu, was arraign in court along with Major (rtd) Abubakar Suleimana for allegedly supplying arms and military assistance to Abudus, both of them were heads at National Security Advisory with Mr. Hamidu as the Chief of Defence Staff.
*Hackman Owusu-Agyeman. The former Interior minister is said to be in possession of a video of the murder of Yaa-Naa, but has not revealed any details about it.
*Supreme Court judge (2015) Justice Yaw Apau accused the media of over-publicizing the report about the murder. He proclaimed as false the report that the body parts of the late King was dismembered. He further rubbished the evidence that was made available to incriminate the suspects of the murder claiming the incidence was an act of war and as such one could not be found guilty of murder.
*Ministers Malik Al-Hassan Yakubu and Imoro Andani resigned as a result of the incident.

==Influence and notable works==
Yakubu II wielded authority over 2 million people aside from the administrative responsibilities the King of Dagbon traditionally has over acephalous groups like the Konkomba, Bimoba, Chekosi, Basaari, Chamba, Waala, Zantansi, and others.

===Education===

====School for Life====
Yaa-Naa Yakubu II attempted to improve the literacy rate in the Northern Region, where the majority of citizens could not read or write. Along with Dr. Abubakari Alhassan, he appealed to the Danish government for some support.
. In response to this, the Ghana Danish community, which eventually developed a Non-governmental organisation called School for Life, was established in 1995. School for life designed a free Educational program targeted at out-of-school children between the ages of eight and fourteen. The program expanded to cover twenty districts in Northern Ghana and has since benefited over 109,000 children (2004) who would otherwise have had no access to education.

====University for Development Studies ====

Yaa Naa Yakubu II was also instrumental in the establishment of the University for Development Studies in Northern Ghana. Plans to set up a university in northern Ghana had been planned since the regime of General Ignatius Kutu Acheampong (1972–1978), but had never been implemented. Yakubu II was unrelenting in his efforts to put pressure on the national government to establish the university. He led several protest delegations to Accra to meet leaders of the country. President Jerry John Rawlings, 10th Head of state of Ghana and good friend of Yakubu II finally cut sod for establishment of the university in 1992. Yakubu II was present at the occasion for that historic moment in Tamale. University for Development Studies now has campuses in Tamale, Nyankpala, Wa and Navrongo. It also has an annual intake of over six-thousand students.

===Sabali bridge===
Between Yendi and Zabzugu, the river Sabali (a tributary of the White Volta) used to flood over its banks, making it difficult for people to transact business at the other side of the river, or transport their farm produce to the market across the river. In 1990, Yaa Naa Yakubu II asked the PNDC government to bridge the river. His request was granted and the river was bridged.

===Elevation of paramount chiefs===
Yaa Naa Yakubu II realised that there was a need to elevate the divisional chiefs under him to the status of paramount chiefs. Paramount chiefs controlled a large area or province, whereas divisional chiefs controlled a small area such as a district or a village. Thus, between 1991 and 1993, he spent considerable time trying to accomplish this. Before he undertook this effort, Yaa Naa Yakubu II was the only paramount chief in the whole of Dagomba traditional area. He was the first chief among the then four paramount chiefs in the northern region to have undertaken this exercise. Yakubu II&#x27;s own status was elevated to that of king. Even today, as a result of the Yaa Naa&#x27;s efforts, there are fifty-five paramount chiefs in the Dagomba traditional area. 

====Konkomba war====
The creation of paramount chiefs motivated the Konkombas, who are under the domain of the Yaa-Naa, to request for their own system of paramount chiefs, to be created at Saboba. Initially, Yaa Naa Yakubu II refused to grant them this request, and this was one of the causes of skirmishes between Konkombas and Dagombas, later culminating into the 1994 Konkomba-Nanumba conflict. The war started at Nakpayili, in the Nanumba traditional area, and spread to the Dagomba and Gonja traditional areas. It claimed two thousand lives, and numerous houses and properties were destroyed. Later, the Yaa Naa gave the Konkomba three paramount chiefs.

<doc id="881233" wikidata="Q316757" url="?curid=881233" title="Demarcation problem">
<text>In philosophy of science and epistemology, the demarcation problem is the question of how to distinguish between science and non-science. It also examines the boundaries between science, pseudoscience and other products of human activity, like art and literature and beliefs. The debate continues after more than two millennia of dialogue among philosophers of science and scientists in various fields. The debate has consequences for what can be termed &quot;scientific&quot; in topics such as education and public policy.

==The ancients==
An early attempt at demarcation can be seen in the efforts of Greek natural philosophers and medical practitioners to distinguish their methods and their accounts of nature from the mythological or mystical accounts of their predecessors and contemporaries.

G. E. R. Lloyd noted that there was a sense in which the groups engaged in various forms of inquiry into nature attempt to &quot;legitimate their own positions&quot;, laying &quot;claim to a new kind of wisdom ... that purported to yield superior enlightenment, even superior practical effectiveness&quot;. Medical writers of the Hippocratic tradition maintained that their discussions were based on demonstration of logical necessity, a theme developed by Aristotle in his &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;. One element of this polemic for science was an insistence on a clear and unequivocal presentation of arguments, rejecting the imagery, analogy, and myth of the old wisdom. Some of their claimed naturalistic explanations of phenomena have been found to be quite fanciful, with little reliance on actual observations.

Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Divinatione&quot; implicitly used five criteria of scientific demarcation that are also used by modern philosophers of science.

==Logical positivism==

Logical positivism, formulated during the 1920s, is the idea that only statements about matters of fact or logical relations between concepts are meaningful. All other statements lack sense and are labelled &quot;metaphysics&quot; (see the verifiability theory of meaning also known as verificationism).

According to A. J. Ayer, metaphysicians make statements which claim to have &quot;knowledge of a reality which [transcends] the phenomenal world&quot;. Ayer, a member of the Vienna Circle and a noted English logical-positivist, argued that making any statements about the world beyond one&#x27;s immediate sense-perception is impossible. This is because even metaphysicians&#x27; first premises will necessarily begin with observations made through sense-perception.

Ayer implied that the demarcation occurs when statements become &quot;factually significant&quot;. To be &quot;factually significant&quot;, a statement must be verifiable. In order to be verifiable, the statement must be verifiable in the observable world, or facts that can be induced from &quot;derived experience&quot;. This is referred to as the &quot;verifiability&quot; criterion.

This distinction between science, which in the opinion of the Vienna Circle possessed empirically verifiable statements, and what they pejoratively termed &quot;metaphysics&quot;, which lacked such statements, can be considered as representing another aspect of the demarcation problem. Logical positivism is often discussed in the context of the demarcation between science and non-science or pseudoscience. However, &quot;The verificationist proposals had the aim of solving a distinctly different demarcation problem, namely that between science and metaphysics.&quot;

==Falsifiability==

Karl Popper considered demarcation as a major problem of the philosophy of science. Popper articulates the problem of demarcation as:

Falsifiability is the demarcation criterion proposed by Popper as opposed to verificationism: &quot;statements or systems of statements, in order to be ranked as scientific, must be capable of conflicting with possible, or conceivable observations.&quot; 

===Against verifiability===
Popper rejected solutions to the problem of demarcation that are grounded in inductive reasoning, and so rejected logical-positivist responses to the problem of demarcation. He argued that logical-positivists want to create a demarcation between the metaphysical and the empirical because they believe that empirical claims are meaningful and metaphysical ones are not. Unlike the Vienna Circle, Popper stated that his proposal was not a criterion of &quot;meaningfulness&quot;.

Popper argued that the Humean induction problem shows that there is no way to make meaningful universal statements on the basis of any number of empirical observations. Therefore, empirical statements are no more &quot;verifiable&quot; than metaphysical statements.

This creates a problem for the demarcation the positivists wanted to define between the empirical and the metaphysical. By their very own &quot;verifiability criterion&quot;, Popper argued, the empirical is subsumed into the metaphysical, and the demarcation between the two becomes non-existent.

===The solution of falsifiability===
In Popper&#x27;s later work, he stated that falsifiability is both a necessary and sufficient criterion for demarcation. He described falsifiability as a property of &quot;the logical structure of sentences and classes of sentences&quot;, so that a statement&#x27;s scientific or non-scientific status does not change over time. This has been summarized as a statement being falsifiable &quot;if and only if it logically contradicts some (empirical) sentence that describes a logically possible event that it would be logically possible to observe&quot;.

==Kuhnian postpositivism==
Thomas Kuhn, an American historian and philosopher of science, is often associated with what has been termed postpositivism or postempiricism. In his 1962 book &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;, Kuhn divided the process of doing science into two different endeavors, which he termed normal science and extraordinary science (sometimes known as &quot;revolutionary science&quot;), the latter of which introduces a new &quot;paradigm&quot; that solves new problems while continuing to provide solutions to the problems solved by the preceding paradigm.

Popper criticized Kuhn&#x27;s demarcation criterion, saying that astrologers are engaged in puzzle solving, and that therefore Kuhn&#x27;s criterion recognized astrology as a science. He stated that Kuhn&#x27;s criterion results in a &quot;major disaster ... [the] replacement of a rational criterion of science by a sociological one&quot;.

==Feyerabend and Lakatos==
Kuhn&#x27;s work largely called into question Popper&#x27;s demarcation, and emphasized the human, subjective quality of scientific change. Paul Feyerabend was concerned that the very question of demarcation was insidious: science itself had no need of a demarcation criterion, but instead some philosophers were seeking to justify a special position of authority from which science could dominate public discourse. Feyerabend argued that science is not in fact special in terms of either its logic or method, and no claim to special authority made by scientists can be sustained. He argued that, within the history of scientific practice, no rule or method can be found that has not been violated or circumvented at some point in order to advance scientific knowledge. Both Imre Lakatos and Feyerabend suggest that science is not an autonomous form of reasoning, but is inseparable from the larger body of human thought and inquiry.

==Thagard==
Paul R. Thagard proposed another set of principles to try to overcome these difficulties, and argued that it is important for society to find a way of doing so. According to Thagard&#x27;s method, a theory is not scientific if it satisfies two conditions:
# The theory has been less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and has many unsolved problems; and...
# The community of practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in relation to others, and is selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations.

Thagard specified that sometimes theories will spend some time as merely &quot;unpromising&quot; before they truly deserve the title of pseudoscience. He cited astrology as an example: it was stagnant compared to advances in physics during the 17th century, and only later became &quot;pseudoscience&quot; in the advent of alternative explanations provided by psychology during the 19th century.

Thagard also stated that his criteria should not be interpreted so narrowly as to allow willful ignorance of alternative explanations, or so broadly as to discount our modern science compared to science of the future. His definition is a practical one, which generally seeks to distinguish pseudoscience as areas of inquiry which are stagnant and without active scientific investigation.

==Some historians&#x27; perspectives==
Many historians of science are concerned with the development of science from its primitive origins; consequently they define science in sufficiently broad terms to include early forms of natural knowledge. In the article on science in the eleventh edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, the scientist and historian William Cecil Dampier Whetham defined science as &quot;ordered knowledge of natural phenomena and of the relations between them&quot;. In his study of Greek science, Marshall Clagett defined science as &quot;first, the orderly and systematic comprehension, description and/or explanation of natural phenomena and, secondly, the [mathematical and logical] tools necessary for the undertaking&quot;. A similar definition appeared more recently in David Pingree&#x27;s study of early science: &quot;Science is a systematic explanation of perceived or imaginary phenomena, or else is based on such an explanation. Mathematics finds a place in science only as one of the symbolical languages in which scientific explanations may be expressed.&quot; These definitions tend to emphasize the subject matter of science rather than its method and from these perspectives, the philosophical concern to establish a demarcation between science and non-science becomes &quot;problematic, if not futile&quot;.

==Laudan==
Larry Laudan concluded, after examining various historical attempts to establish a demarcation criterion, that &quot;philosophy has failed to deliver the goods&quot; in its attempts to distinguish science from non-science—to distinguish science from pseudoscience. None of the past attempts would be accepted by a majority of philosophers nor, in his opinion, should they be accepted by them or by anyone else. He stated that many well-founded beliefs are not scientific and, conversely, many scientific conjectures are not well-founded. He also stated that demarcation criteria were historically used as in polemical disputes between &quot;scientists&quot; and &quot;pseudo-scientists&quot;. Advancing a number of examples from everyday practice of football and carpentry and non-scientific scholarship such as literary criticism and philosophy, he considered the question of whether a belief is well-founded or not to be more practically and philosophically significant than whether it is scientific or not. In his judgment, the demarcation between science and non-science was a pseudo-problem that would best be replaced by examining the distinction between reliable and unreliable knowledge, without bothering to ask whether that knowledge is scientific or not. He would consign phrases like &quot;pseudo-science&quot; or &quot;unscientific&quot; to the rhetoric of politicians or sociologists.

==After Laudan==
Others have disagreed with Laudan. Sebastian Lutz, for example, argued that demarcation does not have to be a single necessary and sufficient condition as Laudan implied. Rather, Laudan&#x27;s reasoning at most establishes that there has to be one necessary criterion and one possibly different sufficient criterion. 

Various typologies or taxonomies of sciences versus nonsciences, and reliable knowledge versus illusory knowledge, have been proposed. Ian Hacking, Massimo Pigliucci, and others have noted that the sciences generally conform to Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s concept of family resemblances.

Other critics have argued for multiple demarcation criteria, some suggesting that there should be one set of criteria for the natural sciences, another set of criteria for the social sciences, and claims involving the supernatural could have a set of pseudoscientific criteria. Anthropologist Sean M. Rafferty of the University at Albany, SUNY in his text &quot;Misanthropology: Science, Pseudoscience, and the Study of Humanity&quot; contrasts science and pseudoscience within his discipline thusly:[E]ven for those subfields where there is a significant element of interpretation, those interpretations are still based on and constrained by physical evidence. And interpretations are always provisional, pending possible refutation by contradictory evidence ... Pseudoscience, by comparison, is scornful of evidence. The pseudoscientist reaches a preferred conclusion in advance, then selects evidence, often removed from any relevant context, to lend supposed support for their conclusions. Often the preconceived conclusion is one that justifies some closely held identity or ideology. Contradictory evidence is waved away or ignored, and as a last resort, one can always claim conspiracy to keep pseudoscientific ideas suppressed.

==Significance==
Concerning science education, Michael D. Gordin wrote:

Discussions of the demarcation problem concern the rhetoric of science and promote critical thinking, which is important for democracy. For example, Gordin stated: &quot;Demarcation remains essential for the enormously high political stakes of climate-change denial and other anti-regulatory fringe doctrines&quot;.

Philosopher noted:

Concern for informed human nutrition resulted in the following note in 1942:

The demarcation problem has been compared to the problem of differentiating fake news from real news, which became prominent during the 2016 United States presidential election.

<text>Darth Bane is a fictional character created by George Lucas in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, Darth Bane is a powerful Sith Lord who lived one thousand years before the events of the films and is known for being the originator of the Sith&#x27;s &quot;Rule of Two&quot;, which states: &quot;One master and one apprentice can be the only Sith in the galaxy at a time&quot;. Before, the Sith empire was structured much like its Jedi counterpart; due to their shortfalls, he killed them and created this new rule.

In 2014, when Lucasfilm officially rebranded the &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot;, and declared it non-canon to the franchise, most of his appearances, including the comic series &quot;Jedi vs. Sith&quot; and the novels &quot;Darth Bane: Path of Destruction&quot;, &quot;Darth Bane: Rule of Two&quot; and &quot;Darth Bane: Dynasty of Evil&quot;, ceased to be canon, leaving his only canonical appearances in the sixth season of &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, in which his Force ghost is voiced by Mark Hamill, a mention in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (2020) #20, and a reference in &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, in which Darth Sidious claims his body to contain the spirits of all Sith since Bane (a concept introduced in &quot;Dynasty of Evil&quot;), whose name is among those his acolytes chant.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Legends&quot;===
==== First appearances ====
The character of Darth Bane, and his Rule of Two, were created by George Lucas as part of his backstory of the Sith he developed for the prequel trilogy. Bane was first mentioned in a deleted scene from &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; and its novelization as the creator of the Rule of Two. In 2000, &quot;The Essential Chronology&quot; collated these events with the Battle of Ruusan mentioned in the 1998 novel &quot;Dark Forces: Jedi Knight&quot;. His first appearances were in 2001 in the &quot;Bane of the Sith&quot; short story and &quot;Jedi vs Sith&quot; comic series. &quot;The New Essential Guide to Characters&quot; (2002) and &quot;The New Essential Chronology&quot; (2005) provided more details, and attempted to correct inconsistencies between &quot;Jedi vs Sith&quot; and &quot;Bane of the Sith&quot;.

==== &quot;Jedi vs. Sith&quot; (2001) and &quot;Path of Destruction&quot; (2006) ====

Darth Bane&#x27;s backstory is established in &quot;Darth Bane: Path of Destruction&quot; by Drew Karpyshyn. He is born as Dessel on the planet Apatros, the son of a miner named Hurst. An abusive alcoholic, Hurst blames the boy for the death of his wife in childbirth, and often calls him the &quot;Bane&quot; of his existence. Bane&#x27;s father takes him into the mines at a young age where the boy is bullied and abused well into adulthood. With his latent affinity in the dark side of the Force, Bane subconsciously uses this power to kill his father in his sleep.

After he kills a Republic Navy ensign in self-defense, Bane flees Apatros to evade arrest, and joins the armies of the Brotherhood of Darkness, an amassing of Sith Lords and acolytes. His instinctive use of the Force (which he initially believes to be a myth) brings him to the attention of the Sith Lord Kopecz. Dessel is sent to the Brotherhood&#x27;s Academy on Korriban to be trained in the ways of the dark side. Dessel (who renames himself Bane) becomes a star pupil after killing another student in cold blood. In particular, he attracts the attention of Sirak, the top student at the Korriban Academy.

After Bane realizes that he had indeed killed his father with the dark side, he subconsciously retreats from the Force, losing his power. Bane falls out of favor in the Academy, and is eventually refused any personalized training. Months later, in a vain attempt to reestablish himself, Bane challenges Sirak to a fight and is seriously injured in the ensuing duel.

Bane&#x27;s training in and ascension to the Sith is detailed in both &quot;Path of Destruction&quot; and &quot;Jedi vs. Sith&quot;. As a student, he meets a new apprentice (and former Jedi) named Githany, who secretly plans to use him to bring down Sirak. Githany reestablishes his connection to the dark side by showing him in secret what the Sith Lords are teaching her. Most importantly, and to the dismay of the instructors, Bane studies tomes from the Golden Age of the Sith. He soon realizes that the Brotherhood&#x27;s teachings are incomplete.

Githany tells Bane that she intends to challenge Sirak, assuming that Bane would offer to assassinate him to spare her. However, Bane surprises her by revealing his intentions to destroy Sirak personally in the dueling ring, and that he had known all along she was using him. During the duel, he seriously wounds his opponent, but stops just short of killing him.

Qordis, the main Sith there, knows of his secret training with Githany. He tells him so, and ends up angering Bane. Bane leaves the academy, hoping to find the secrets of ancient Sith Masters in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban. To his disappointment, however, he finds nothing. He returns to the academy, where Githany lures him to the archives, apparently intending to kill him. When the trap comes to fruition, however, Bane realizes that the trap is actually meant for Sirak. Githany kills Sirak&#x27;s henchmen, and Bane defeats and kills his old nemesis in a lightsaber duel.

Bane takes the long-abandoned Sith title of Darth, leaves the Brotherhood, and travels to Rakata Prime. There, he discovers a Sith Holocron left behind by Darth Revan. Bane completes his training, learning numerous Sith techniques, including the &quot;thought bomb&quot; designed to kill all Force-sensitive beings in reach. He sends this to Lord Kaan. Bane then devises the &quot;Rule of Two&quot;: only two Sith Lords, a master and an apprentice, are allowed to exist at one time (&quot;One to embody power and one to crave it.&quot;)

Kaan orders that all of the students on Korriban be made into Lords and brought to battle on Ruusan. Kaan sends Kas&#x27;im to bring Bane back to Ruusan to join the Brotherhood on pain of death. Upon meeting his former teacher, Bane considers taking him as an apprentice, but ultimately kills him after being refused. Afterwards, Bane takes it upon himself to destroy the remaining Sith and take on an apprentice to carry on the Sith legacy after him.

Bane sends a staged message to Kaan asking to join the Brotherhood; Githany volunteers to kill Bane. Unknown to Githany, Bane had also sent the thought bomb, supposedly as a token of goodwill. Githany finds Bane, and pretends to accept his offer to join the Brotherhood. Githany slipped him poison in a kiss, and he is rendered violently ill. Barely alive, Bane eventually finds a healer named Caleb and extorts his help by threatening his daughter. Caleb cures Bane of the poison and nurses him back to health.

Bane returns to Ruusan, where Kaan agrees to follow his lead in battle. During meditation, Bane uses his own body and power as a focusing agent to unleash a wave of destruction upon the forests of Ruusan, where the Jedi&#x27;s Army of Light is hiding. When the other Sith Lords mutiny, an enraged Bane moves to destroy the Brotherhood. He first orders the commander of the space forces to engage the Jedi fleet, leading to the Jedi gaining the upper-hand, and the Sith bring forced to retreat. Realizing he is facing defeat, Kaan ha s a conversation with Bane, where Bane manipulates him to destroy the Jedi with &quot;a thought bomb. However, he deceives Kaan by leaving out the fact that a thought bomb would engulf every force user within the radius upon use, leading to Kaan believing that the Brotherhood would survive the effects. Kaan then retreats to some caves with the other Sith Lords. When the thought bomb detonates, it destroys the Jedi and Sith armies, including Kaan, Githany, and the leader of the Jedi Army of Light, Jedi Master Hoth.

In both &quot;Jedi vs. Sith&quot; and the end of &quot;Path of Destruction&quot;, Bane meets a Force-sensitive young girl named Rain, who had been brought to Ruusan by the Jedi. Rain had been travelling with her friend Laa, a native of Ruusan, called a &quot;Bouncer&quot;, and had saved Laa from being warped by the Sith destruction to Ruusan. Laa is shot dead by two Jedi troops, because every other Bouncer they had encountered after the destruction caused by Bane and the other Sith had been driven mad. As Bane watches, Rain unintentionally draws on the dark side out of anger and kills the two Jedi soldiers. Bane realizes Rain&#x27;s potential, and accepts her as his apprentice, Darth Zannah.

====&quot;Darth Bane: Rule of Two&quot; (2007)====
In &quot;Darth Bane: Rule of Two&quot;, Darth Bane goes to Onderon&#x27;s moon, Dxun, to scavenge an ancient Sith temple. He leaves Zannah with her first mission: to find her way to Onderon in 10 days by her own cunning and strategy. Bane finds his objective: Freedon Nadd&#x27;s holocron. During the quest, however, parasites called orbalisks cover his body. He uses the holocron to gain further knowledge of the dark side, as well as information on the orbalisks. He learns that Nadd faced the same problem with the orbalisks, so the Dark Lord before him created a suit that would stop them growing on his face, hands and feet. Meanwhile, his apprentice sabotages a Republic craft and lands in an unknown strip of land which belongs to Dxun&#x27;s infamous beast Riders. She nearly dies in the attempt, but Bane saves her. Then, the pair goes into hiding on Ambria, establishing illegal contacts through the galaxy through the use of an information broker.

Over the next decade, Zannah acts as Bane&#x27;s lieutenant, carrying out his orders as she grows stronger in the dark side. He orders her to coerce secession movements to move against the Republic too early; the secessionists are subsequently crushed, both removing threats to the Sith&#x27;s power and deflecting attention off of the two Sith lords.

After a botched assassination attempt against the Chancellor, Zannah discovers a dark side user, Hetton, who has uncovered the location of a tomb of an ancient Sith on the Deep Core planet of Tython. It is rumored that this tomb contains a Holocron with the key that Bane needs to produce his own. After killing the pseudo Sith, Bane and Zannah set off on their respective missions: to recover the ancient Holocron, and infiltrate the Jedi Archives for information on removing the orbalisks.

Upon arrival on Tython and entering the tomb, Bane is attacked by scores of technobeasts, creations of the ancient Sith to guard her crypt. He eventually defeats them and successfully recovers the Holocron. Zannah is able to obtain the information she needs, but her cover is blown at the last minute by her cousin Tomcat, now a healer in the care of the Jedi. Realizing she will need him to remove the orbalisks, she takes him hostage and heads for Tython, with the Jedi on their trail.

Once Zannah and Tomcat arrive on Tython and warn Bane, they retreat to the interior of the temple, waiting for the attack. When it finally comes, the two sides are evenly matched, despite the Sith being outnumbered. When Bane is about to unleash an attack on the last remaining Jedi, his opponent suspends a Force Shield around him. The lightning bounces off the interior of the shield and cooks Bane alive for seconds, melting his flesh and causing the orbalisk to burrow further into his flesh and release a toxin, resulting in unbearable pain. Bane blacks out and is almost killed by the Jedi, but Zannah saves her master and brings him to Ambria, dragging Tomcat along.

Once there, Tomcat (aka Darovit) creates an agreement between Zannah and Caleb (the healer who helped Bane in the previous novel) designed to ensure their survival. Caleb heals Bane under the assurance that Bane will be arrested and imprisoned by the Jedi Council long before Bane is strong enough to fight back. Darovit then sends a message drone containing their location&#x27;s coordinates to the Jedi. Also, he disables their ship to ensure that the Sith cannot escape. After several days, Bane awakens, infuriated when he hears that his apprentice has sent a message alerting the Jedi to their presence. Begging her to kill him, he over-exerts himself and passes out again. Zannah kills Caleb and disables Tomcat with a Sith spell of madness. She then hides herself and her Master in a secret compartment under Caleb&#x27;s bed. When the Jedi arrive, Tomcat attacks them in his delusional state, and he is killed. Finding no other living beings, the Jedi assume they have finally killed the last of the Sith. Zannah nurses Bane back to health — even as she pledges to kill him when her training is complete — and they go back into hiding.

====&quot;Darth Bane: Dynasty of Evil&quot; (2010)====
Ten years later, Darth Bane and Zannah are living on Ciutric IV, disguised as merchants. Bane is growing older and weaker, but Zannah has not yet made any attempt to confront him. Fearing that she is too weak to pursue his legacy, he starts to search for the lost knowledge of Darth Andeddu, a Dark Lord of the Sith who harbored the secret of eternal life. When Bane discovers that a clue to the secret can be found on the planet Prakith, he distracts Zannah by sending her to Doan to investigate the death of a Jedi Knight.

Zannah knows that, despite his frail appearance, Bane is tremendously powerful and that his frailty might be a trap to lure her into attacking him. Zannah also knows that, if she was to defeat Bane and take on the mantle of the Dark Lord of the Sith, she would need an apprentice of her own. During her investigations on Doan, she meets a Dark Jedi named Set Harth who collects Sith artifacts. After a brief duel, which Set loses, Zannah takes him on as her apprentice.

Meanwhile, Bane arrives on Prakith through a series of hazardous micro-jumps into the Deep Core. He storms Andeddu&#x27;s temple, which is inhabited by a cult called the Malevolence, and easily recovers the Dark Lord&#x27;s holocron. On the trip back, Bane is frustrated by the holocron&#x27;s gatekeeper&#x27;s stalling and forcefully uses his power to &quot;hack&quot; the holocron, discovering Darth Andeddu&#x27;s technique of essence transfer, the ability to transfer one&#x27;s consciousness into another&#x27;s body. Armed with this knowledge, Bane returns to Ciutric IV expecting to confront Zannah.

During these course of events, Serra, Princess of Doan, discovers that her father has been killed and suspects Bane&#x27;s survival. She hires an assassin known as the Huntress to capture Bane. On Ciutric IV, the Huntress and a group of mercenaries ambushes Bane, and manages to incapacitate him by a potent nerve poison supplied by Serra&#x27;s healer knowledge.

While in captivity in the Stone Prison on Doan, Bane is tortured by Serra as revenge for the death of her father. However, Serra&#x27;s bodyguard and best friend, Lucia, recognizes Bane as Des, commander of the Gloom Walkers who saved her squad multiple times during the Sith Wars. Lucia secretly counteracts the poison restraining Bane, and he successfully breaks out. However, Bane also senses that Zannah had tracked him to Doan and attempts to elude because of his weakened state. Bane runs into Lucia, but their reunion is cut short when Zannah arrives and engages Bane in a duel. Lucia is killed as collateral damage. Despite being weakened and unarmed, Bane is able to hold his own against Zannah.

Serra is initially hesitant about activating the self-destruct system for the prison, but upon discovering Lucia&#x27;s death, she promptly activates the system. Bane manages to escape from Zannah, and each attempt to escape on different shuttles. Prior to this, Set, who accompanied Zannah, tracks down the aura of Darth Andeddu&#x27;s holocron among Bane&#x27;s confiscated possessions. He attempts to escape, but he is waylaid by the Huntress in the shuttle bay. He manages to evade her and escape on a shuttle. The Huntress then encounters Bane, and pledges to become his next apprentice, offering him back his lightsaber and holocron which she stole from his estate.

Bane and the Huntress, now renamed Darth Cognus, follows Serra back to Ambria near Caleb&#x27;s cottage. The princess, who has now learned to let go of her hatred, calmly awaits Bane and allows Cognus to kill her. Bane then sends a message to Zannah directing her to Ambria to finish their duel.

Zannah arrives and they restart their duel, with Bane now armed. Zannah now knows that she cannot best Bane in combat, so she resolves to utilize her specialty of Sith sorcery. Their fight progresses with Bane pressuring Zannah until Zannah unleashes a mind attack. Bane powers through her illusions, but Zannah reveals her trump card and summons sentient tentacles of pure dark side energy. Bane evades them and rushes Zannah, but his final blow is cut short by a tentacle severing the arm holding his lightsaber. As a last resort, he invokes Darth Andeddu&#x27;s essence transfer technique to possess Zannah. His body is destroyed and reduced to ash as a side effect of the technique and the two fight a battle of wills within Zannah&#x27;s body. The fight ends and it is unclear who is the victor. Zannah proclaims : &quot;Darth Bane is gone. I am Darth Zannah, Dark Lord of the Sith and your new Master&quot;. Cognus approaches Zannah and proclaims her loyalty to the new Sith Master, as her apprentice. Still, Cognus cannot help but notice as Zannah speaks she was continually clenching and unclenching the fingers of her left hand. Bane&#x27;s method of halting the tremors that plagued his old body. Bane&#x27;s essence remains dead, but a part of his influence lives on in Zannah.

In some unknown place, Set has activated Darth Andeddu&#x27;s holocron and plans to obtain immortality.

====&quot;Legacy&quot; (2006)====

Darth Bane is also featured in &quot;Star Wars: Legacy&quot;, set 130 years after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. In &quot;#5: Broken, Part 4&quot;, Darth Krayt uses a Holocron to summon the long-dead Sith Lords Darth Bane, Darth Nihilus and Darth Andeddu. Bane condemns Krayt for taking more than one apprentice, and prophesies that Krayt&#x27;s new Sith Empire will collapse when his followers turn on themselves, since in Bane&#x27;s view the &quot;One Sith&quot; philosophy of Krayt is not an improvement on Bane&#x27;s Rule of Two.

===Canon===

====&quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; (2014)====
In the &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; season six episode &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, Darth Bane appears as an apparition to Yoda on the Sith home planet Moraband. He is voiced by Mark Hamill, who portrayed Luke Skywalker in the films. Prior to taking on the role of Bane, Hamill did not know of the character or how Bane fit into the overall arc of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. His son Nathan knew about the history of the character, however, and was able to explain it to his father once he took on the role. For the portrayal, Dave Filoni recorded Hamill reading his lines using multiple inflections, each portraying different emotions, and then blended all together into the version heard within the episode. Previous to that appearance, the developers of the show had considered and rejected for Darth Bane to appear during the third season&#x27;s &quot;Mortis Trilogy&quot; arc alongside Darth Revan, acting as an influence on the Son (an embodiment of the dark side). For now, this serves as Bane&#x27;s only canon appearance.

Bane was to originally appear, alongside Darth Revan, in the third-season episode &quot;Ghosts of Mortis&quot; as an influence to The Son, an embodiment of the dark side of the Force. Although George Lucas commissioned the scene, he later cut it before the scene could be fully animated.

===Non-canon===
====&quot;Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes&quot; (2015)====
Darth Bane eventually became one of the many playable &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters in the mobile turn-based role-playing game &quot;Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes&quot;, featuring characters from both the mainstream canon timeline established by The Walt Disney Company, along with select &quot;Legends&quot; characters. He was added during the game&#x27;s ninth year of operation in 2024, and could only be unlocked through the Conquest mode.

<text>The Dagbamba or Dagomba are an ethnic group of Ghana, and Togo. They number more than 3.1 million people. The term Dagbamba is originally extended to refer to other related peoples who were unified by Naa Gbewaa including the Mamprusi and Nanumba. The Dagomba country is called Dagbon and they speak Dagbanli language. Dagbanli is the most spoken language of northern Ghana and is a widely spoken local language of Ghana. Dagbanli belongs to the Mabia (Mole-Dagbani) subgroup of the Gur languages, a large group of related languages in West Africa. The Dagomba practises both patrilineal and matrilineal systems of inheritance.

In the late 1600s, King Zanjina, became the first ruler to practise Islam. The reign of Zanjina ushered in an era of greater prosperity. Many learning centres were established and scholarship became an important part of tradition. In 1700, the University Moliyili was established, but was later abandoned during European colonization. The Dagomba resisted European Colonization even after Germany burnt down and occupied its capital, Yendi, located in Eastern Dagbon (Naya).

The Dagomba are one of few African people who reserve royal titles for women. Dagomba women rule, ascend to royal positions with male subjects, and own regal lands. The impact of its women is prominent as it has given birth to Ghana&#x27;s first female minister, and Africa&#x27;s first female cabinet minister. Historically, its noble daughter, Yennenga, is regarded as the &quot;mother&quot; of the Mossi kingdoms, a people who constitute nearly half of the nation of Burkina Faso. The Gundo Naa is the head of all female chiefs, and the Zosimli Naa enhances collaboration between cities of Dagbon and sister cities.

The Dagombas established several schools prior to European arrivals in Africa. A later but more known institution is the University of Moliyili, established in 1700. Moliyili had a hierarchical scholastic system similar to what is found in modern universities. The Dagomba have a writing system, the Dagbani script, which uses a modified Arabic alphabet but Dagbani syntax. The archival manuscripts have been lost, but many transferred to Denmark. After joining Gold Coast as a protectorate (not colony), the Dagombas adopted the Greek and Latin alphabets.

Women are held in high regard, and children fear the displeasure and wrath of the mother. Brothers protect the dignity of sisters at all cost. The Dagombas are one of the few peoples in Africa to have female chiefs who possess regal lands and rule over male subjects. Closest family bonds are termed &quot;Mabihili&quot;. Both males and females in such a close family bond refer to each other as Mabia (mother&#x27;s child), signifying the importance of the mother. Motherland is termed Mayili and fatherland is termed Bayili. There is no English equivalent of Mabihili.

In Dagomba society, there are several gods (singular: wuni, plural: wuna). The chief (Naa) of all these gods is Naawuni. Each city has a shrine (buɣli). For example, the shrine of the People of Tolon is Jaagbo, and that of Nyankpala is Wonoyili. There are many soothsayers (baɣa) whom people consult for prophesies and solutions to their problems. The inheritance of many soothsaying is through a maternal brother.

Many Christian evangelical groups have launched failed campaigns to convert the Dagomba. However, the Dagomba continue practising its traditional religion and Islam. The arrival of Islam to the Dagomba brought prosperity, whiles, Christianity was brought by Europeans, who burnt their cities and displaced its people. Today, the Dagomba have provided free lands to many Christian missionaries to undertake their activities. While Islamic schools do not mandate students to worship or visit mosques, Christian schools makes worship compulsory for all students, even for members of the Dagbon Traditional Religion and Islam.

The Dagombas celebrate the oldest festivals in Ghana, including the Fire Festival, which existed prior to the formation of the Kingdom of Dagbon. Other festivals include the Damba Festival, Guinea Fowl (Kpini Chuɣu) Festival and Yam Festival (Nyuli Dibu), Konyuri Chuɣu (Eid Al-Fitr), Chimsi Chuɣu (Eid AL-Adha). Other minor localized festivals that are celebrated included the Market Festival (Daa Chuɣu) by the people of Tolon.

The Dagomba founded the Kingdom of Dagbon. They are historically related to the Mossi people of Burkina Faso. The Mossi Kingdoms were founded by Yennenga, a daughter of Naa Gbewaa. The Mohi/Mossi have their homeland in central Burkina Faso. Aside the Mossi, the Dagombas are the founders of the Bouna state of the Ivory Coast, and the Dagaaba states of Upper West Region of Ghana. The homeland of the Dagomba, Dagbon, covers about 20,000 km2 in area.

Naa Gbewaa is the founder of the Dagbon Kingdom. Earlier Dagombas prior to Naa Gbewaa lived in decentralized states. Gbewaa, and his descendants, centralized the kingdom. The decentralized states were headed by the Tindaamba. Today, the Tindaamba still preserve the ancient Dagbon traditions that have been passed through the ages, leading traditional religious acts and solving problems of their constituents. The Tindaamba are not appointed by the Yaa Naa, they are chosen by an oracle. Inheritance is both patrilineal and matrilineal. Royalty in Dagbon is complex as it has evolved through the centuries. Dagomba are one of the ethnic groups with a sophisticated oral tradition woven around drums and other musical instruments. Thus, Dagbon history has been passed down meticulously via oral tradition, with drummers as professional griots known as Lunsi. According to oral tradition, the political history of Dagbon has its origin in the life story of a legend called &quot;Tohazie&quot; (translated as &quot;red hunter&quot;).

Dagombas practise both Islam and the Dagbon Traditional Religion. Islam was brought to the region by Soninke (known as &quot;Wangara&quot; by Ghanaians) traders between the 12th and 15th centuries. Since the time of Naa Zanjina, Islam has been the state religion and Islam seems to be growing rapidly ever since. The reformist activities of Afa Ajura in the middle of the twentieth century caused entire communities to embrace the Islamic religion &quot;en masse&quot;. Inheritance in the Dagomba people is largely patrilineal, however, inheritance of certain Tindaamba is matrilineal. There are also female rulers with male subordinates, such as the Gundo Naa and the Kpatu Naa. The Gundo Naa has vast land and head all female royals of Dagbon. Important festivals include the Damba, Bugum (fire festival) and the Islamic Eid festivals. The largest settlement of the Dagomba is Tamale, Ghana&#x27;s third populous and the Northern Region&#x27;s capital.
The Mossi and Dagomba states are among the great West African medieval empires. Beginning in the 12th century, they eventually ruled the lands of the entire northern Volta basin, which today includes all of northern Ghana and Burkina Faso. During their second northern expansion, the Mossi invasion reached eastern Maasina and Lake Débo 1400, Benka in c. 1433 and Walata in 1477-83 (these empires were in present-day Mali). According to Illiasu (1971) in his work &quot;The Origins of the Mossi-Dagomba states&quot;, the second period of the Mossi-Dagomba success came to an end with the restoration of Imperial Songhai power towards the close of the 15th century. Although the Mossi-Dagomba states have the same grandfather (Naa Gbewa), the Dagomba are traditionally regarded as &quot;senior&quot; to the Mossi states of Ouagadougou, Yatenga and Fada N&#x27;Gourma.

==Origins==

The Dagombas have inhabited Northern for thousands of years. Some members of the ruling class descended from Naa Gbewaa, whose ancestors migrated from around the areas of Lake Chad after the break up of the Ghana Empire at the end of the 13th Century. Gbewaa unified the Dagomba people into a kingdom. Chiefs who are descendants of Gbewaa are the Nanima (singular: Naa) and aboriginal chiefs are the Tindaamba (singular: Tindana). Other important chiefs such the chiefs of Tolon, Kumbungu and Gulkpeɣu (Tamale) may not be descendants of Gbewaa.

==Kingdom of Dagbon==

The homeland of the Dagombas is called Dagbon and covers about 20,000 km2 in area. The territories of Dagbon was decentralised until the Great Unification by the Nanima. The Dagomba share close bonds with related people whose lands were also unified. This include the Mamprusi, Nanumba, Gonja, Mossi, Gurunsi (in particular the Frafra and Kusasi peoples), the Wala people and Ligbi. The area constitutes fourteen administrative districts in present-day Ghana. These are the Tamale Metropolitan, Yendi, Savelugu and Sagnerigu municipals, and Tolon, Kumbungu, Nanton, Gushegu, Karaga, Zabzugu, Saboba, Sang, Tatale and Cheriponi districts. The king of the Dagbon Traditional Kingdom is the Ya-Na, whose court and administrative capital is at Yendi. Dagbon as a kingdom has never been subjugated until it was incorporated as a territory of the Gold Coast government. The Dagbon Kingdom has traditional administrative responsibilities hitherto acephalous groups like the Konkomba, Bimoba, Chekosi, Basaari, Chamba, Wala, Gurusi and Zantasi. The Dagombas have cordial and respectful relationships to these groups. The seat of the &quot;Yaa Naa&quot; or king of Dagbon (literally translated as &quot;King of Absolute Power&quot;) is a collection of lion and cow skins. Thus, the Dagbon or its political system is often called the Yendi Skin (not throne or crown or stool). Another characteristic of the Dagomba is that their houses are arranged in a certain order, where the chief or elderly man has his hut built in the centre.

==Chieftaincy==
One of the major features of Dagomba society is chieftaincy. Their system of chieftaincy is very hierarchical, with the Yaa Naa, or paramount King, at its head and a tiered system of rulers below him. In Dagbon, chiefs traditionally sit on a stack of skins.

== Dagomba Festivals ==
The people of Ghana&#x27;s Dagbon Kingdom celebrate a number of festivals. Festivals held in Dagbon include the Bugum festival (fire festival), Damba, and Kpini (festival of Guinea fowl). Additionally, there is the Chimsi festival and Konyuri chuɣu (Festival of Breaking the Fast).

=== Bugum festival (fire festival) ===
Bugum Festival also known as the Fire festival is an occasion where families gather for communal celebrations, rituals, and joy at the Fire festival in order to honor their ancestors, ask for blessings, and ward off evil spirits. Many different ethnic groups in Northern Ghana celebrate this festival. Most attendees of the festivity are both Muslims and non-Muslims. Muslims celebrate the fire festival, known as Bugum, to commemorate the arrival of Prophet Noah&#x27;s (Nuhu) Ark following the flood. During the night, bundles of grass are utilized as torches to celebrate. Since the celebration brings in a new year, some non-Muslims use this time to give sacrifices to God and their ancestors.

<text>Fußball-Club St. Pauli von 1910 e.V., commonly known as simply FC St. Pauli (), is a German professional football club based in the St. Pauli district of Hamburg. The team competes in the Bundesliga in the 2024–25 season following promotion.

The football department is part of a larger sports club that also has departments in rugby (FC St. Pauli Rugby), baseball, bowling, boxing (FC St. Pauli Boxen), chess, cycling, handball, roller derby (Harbor Girls Hamburg), skittles, softball, table tennis, and since 2011, marathon. Until the end of 2013, the club also had a department in American football, but it was dissolved because it lacked the youth team required in order to hold a men&#x27;s team. As of April 2023, FC St. Pauli has 30,400 members.

The men&#x27;s professional football team dropped down to the Regionalliga in 2003, at that time the third highest football division in Germany and remained there for four years. In 2007, they won promotion back to the 2. Bundesliga, the second highest division in Germany and in 2010, they were promoted to the Bundesliga, the highest division. After relegation, since the 2011–12 season they have played in 2. Bundesliga until the 2023–24 season when they were promoted back to the Bundesliga.

FC St. Pauli has a cross-city rivalry with Hamburger SV; the matches between the two are known as the &quot;Hamburger Stadtderby&quot; or simply &quot;Derby&quot;. The club also has a more recent rivalry with Hansa Rostock.

Although the club has been only modestly successful, it is widely recognised for its distinctive social culture and has a large popular following as one of the country&#x27;s &quot;Kult&quot; clubs. FC St. Pauli and supporters are strongly identified with their support of  left wing politics.

==History==
===Early years===
The club began its existence in 1899 as a loose, informal group of football enthusiasts within the &quot;Hamburg-St.Pauli Turn-Verein 1862&quot;. This group did not play its first match until 1907, when they faced a similar side assembled from the local Aegir swimming club. Officially established on 15 May 1910, the club played as &quot;St. Pauli TV&quot; in the Kreisliga Groß-Hamburg (Alsterkreis) until 1924, when a separate football side called St. Pauli was formed. The team played as an undistinguished lower-to-mid table side until making their first appearance in 1934 in the top-flight Gauliga Nordmark, 1 of 16 premier level divisions created in the re-organization of German football that took place under the Third Reich. They were immediately relegated, but returned to the top flight in 1936. Relegated again in 1940, St. Pauli re-appeared in the Gauliga Hamburg in 1942, and played there until the end of World War II.

===Post-war football===

After the war, the club resumed play in the Oberliga Nord in 1947. A second-place finish in the 1947–48 season led St. Pauli to its first appearance in the national championship rounds. They advanced as far as the semi-finals, where they were knocked out 2–3 by eventual champions 1. FC Nürnberg. The club continued to play well throughout the early 1950s, but were unable to overtake rivals Hamburger SV, finishing in second place in five of the next seven seasons, and going out in the early rounds in each of their championship-round appearances from 1949 to 1951. In the late 1950s and into the early 1960s, St. Pauli were overtaken by rivals such as Werder Bremen and VfL Osnabrück, but finished fourth a number of times.

===Promotion to the Bundesliga===
In 1963, the Bundesliga – West Germany&#x27;s new top-flight professional league – was formed. Hamburger SV, Werder Bremen, and Eintracht Braunschweig joined the new circuit as the top-finishers from the Oberliga Nord, while FC St. Pauli found themselves in the second-tier Regionalliga Nord. That year, the club signed Guy Acolatse, who became the first Black professional footballer to play in Germany.

Nearly a decade-and-a-half of frustration followed. St. Pauli won their division in 1964, but finished bottom of their group in the promotion play-off round. They won their next Regionalliga Nord title in 1966, but, while they performed far better in the play-offs, still could not advance to the top-flight, losing to Rot-Weiss Essen on goal difference, having conceded two more goals. Division championships in 1972 and 1973, and runner-up finishes in 1971 and 1974, were each followed by promotion-round play-off disappointment.

The success of the Bundesliga, and the growth of professional football in West Germany, led to the formation of the 2. Bundesliga in 1974. St. Pauli was part of the new second-tier professional circuit in the 2. Bundesliga Nord and, in 1977, they advanced to the top flight as winners of their division. The team survived for one season at the highest level in the Bundesliga.

The club&#x27;s return to the 2. Bundesliga Nord was also short-lived. On the verge on bankruptcy in 1979, they were denied a license for the following season and were sent down to the Oberliga Nord (III). Strong performances that set the team atop that division in 1981 and 1983 were marred by poor financial health. By 1984, the club had recovered sufficiently to return to the 2. Bundesliga, overtaking Werder Bremen&#x27;s amateur side, who, despite finishing two points ahead of St. Pauli, were ineligible for promotion.

===&quot;Kult&quot; phenomenon===
It was in the mid-1980s that St. Pauli&#x27;s transition from a standard traditional club into a &quot;Kult&quot; club began. The club was also able to turn the location of its ground in the dock area part of town, near Hamburg&#x27;s famous Reeperbahn – centre of the city&#x27;s night life and its red-light district – to its advantage. An alternative fan scene slowly emerged, built around left-leaning politics, social activism and the event and party atmosphere of the club&#x27;s matches. St. Pauli became the first team in Germany to officially ban right-wing nationalist activities and displays in its stadium during a period of fascist-inspired football hooliganism across Europe. In 1981, the team was averaging small crowds of only 1,600 spectators, but by the late 1990s they were frequently selling out their entire 20,000-capacity ground.

Supporters adopted the skull and crossbones as their own unofficial emblem in the 1980s. Although precise details are uncertain, the story goes that named &quot;Doc Mabuse&quot;, a singer in a Hamburg punk band, nailed a Jolly Roger flag to a broomstick and brought it to the Millerntor-Stadion. The original flag featured a skull with pirate eyepatch. Inspired, other fans began to bring similar flags to matches. In 1989, Hamburg screenprinter Steph Braun created an image combining a detailed representation of a skull (taken from an anatomy textbook) with the words &quot;ST. PAULI&quot; underneath. Intended to represent the area itself, and sold in various record shops around the district, Braun&#x27;s graphic was adopted by St. Pauli fans and came to be seen as specifically associated with the club.

In the early 1990s, the media in Germany began to recognize the &quot;Kult&quot;-image of the club, focusing on the punk part of the fan-base in TV broadcasts of the matches. By this time, the media also started to establish nicknames like &quot;Freibeuter der Liga&quot; (&quot;Buccaneers of the League&quot;) as well as the satirical &quot;das Freudenhaus der Liga&quot; (&quot;Brothel of the League&quot;, literally &quot;House of Joy&quot;). The club itself realized the potential and in September 1999 bought the rights to Steph Braun&#x27;s skull and crossbones graphic, making it an official club logo.

St. Pauli moved in and out of the Bundesliga over the course of the next dozen years: the club was narrowly relegated to the Oberliga in the 1984–85 season, but won the 1985–86 championship and returned to 2. Bundesliga. Two increasingly strong years followed, resulting in promotion and three seasons in the Bundesliga, from 1988 to 1991. Four seasons followed in 2. Bundesliga, and then another two in the Bundesliga in 1995 to 1997, before another return to the 2. Bundesliga.

===Into the new millennium===
Until 2010, the club&#x27;s most recent appearance in the top-flight had been a single-season cameo in 2001–02. A win against Bayern Munich, the reigning Intercontinental Cup winners, led to the popular &quot;Weltpokalsiegerbesieger&quot; (&quot;World Club Champion beaters&quot;) shirts. However, the team finished last in the league, partly because the management did not trust the team which surprisingly won the promotion in 2001, but rather spent the additional money from Bundesliga TV contracts and advertisements on expensive but disappointing players. After the relegation to the 2. Bundesliga, only a skeleton of the successful 2001 team remained. The 2002–03 season ended up in chaos, with the team fighting relegation (ultimately in vain) from the very beginning, various coaches departing and other problems internal to the club.

With the club almost bankrupt again and the less-lucrative Regionaliga Nord (III) looming, the club began its fund-raising activities, the so-called &quot;Retteraktion&quot;. They printed t-shirts with the club&#x27;s crest surrounded by the word &quot;Retter&quot; (&quot;rescuer/saviour&quot;) and more than 140,000 were sold within six weeks. They also organized a lucrative benefit game, against Bayern Munich, to raise funds to save the club.

The club has also been active in terms of charity and in 2005 the club, the team and the fans initiated the Viva con Agua de Sankt Pauli campaign, which collects money for water-dispensers for schools in Cuba, for clean water in Rwanda et cetera.

During the 2005–06 season, the team enjoyed unprecedented success in the DFB-Pokal, with wins over Burghausen, VfL Bochum and, significantly, Bundesliga sides Hertha BSC and, in the quarter-finals on 25 January 2006, Werder Bremen. Their 3–1 victory in front of a sell-out Millerntor crowd, and their subsequent place in the DFB Cup semi-final, netted the club approximately €1 million in TV and sponsorship money, going a long way to saving the club from immediate financial ruin.

St. Pauli finally went out of the cup to Bayern Munich on 12 April, going down 3–0 with a goal from Owen Hargreaves and two from Claudio Pizarro. Coincidentally, Bayern were also St. Pauli&#x27;s opponents and dispatchers in the first round of the following season&#x27;s cup.

After success in the 2006–07 season, the team was promoted to the 2. Bundesliga. After defeating SpVgg Greuther Fürth in the 2009–10 season, the team secured promotion back to the Bundesliga for the 2010–11 season. On 16 February 2011, during the 2010–11 season and for the first time since 1977, St. Pauli defeated their cross-city rivals, Hamburger SV, away at the Volksparkstadion, courtesy of a Gerald Asamoah goal. The team, however, finished the domestic season in last place, resulting in their relegation to the 2. Bundesliga for the 2011–12 season. Since then, the club remained in the 2. Bundesliga, finishing fourth in 2011–12 but declining in results in the years to come, until they earned promotion back to the Bundesliga in the 2023–24 season.

== Football Cooperative St. Pauli von 2024 eG ==
In order to be able to guarantee and expand financial security in professional football, the board and members of the club have decided in the End of 2024 to found the Football Cooperative St. Pauli von 2024 eG. The cooperative will enable fans and members to acquire shares for 750 euros plus a subscription and administration fee of 100 euros. The club is expecting 20,000 to 30,000 shareholders, which should raise up to 30 million euros, with the sale of shares to be discontinued once 36 million is reached. The co-operative will use these funds to acquire a majority stake in the Millerntor stadium operating company. The income is also needed to service existing loans, in particular from the new stadium construction and the coronavirus period. Members of the cooperative have co-determination rights according to the one man, one vote - priciple and elect the Executive Board. The Football Cooperative St. Pauli von 2024 eG is the first cooperative in German professional football.

==Colours and kit==

The colours of FC St. Pauli are brown and white, and to a lesser extent red. Black is also common among fans and on third kits.

The club has worn brown and white since 1910, when it joined the Northern German Football Association (&quot;Norddeutscher Fußball-Verband&quot;). These early uniforms were made up of brown shirts and socks with white shorts. Some time between the 1920s and 30s, the club took on what would become its traditional look, namely a white shirt, brown shorts and brown socks with a white turnover. From early on in the club&#x27;s history until the 1990s, the club readily wore its brown change shirts at home, even during such games as those against rivals HSV, who also wear white shirts.

During the 1960s, the club introduced white socks which regularly alternated with plain brown socks. A motif was used on the club shirt for the first time in 1968, when the club donned stripes, and, in the 1970s, various other motifs adorned the club&#x27;s first and second-choice shirts. In the 1976–77 season, St. Pauli began wearing Adidas kits, marking the end of a period of often experimental shirts, and this traditional look continued when the club started wearing Puma kits in the 1980s. For the 1985–86 season, the club sported an all-white Puma kit, which would be worn for four consecutive seasons before some brown details returned to the shirt. However, the Kiezkicker would continue to wear these predominantly white kits until 1993.

At this point, the club would return to a kit based on a white-brown-white scheme, but in a more contemporary style, often incorporating patterns. The Reusch kits of 1994–96 and 1996–97 had hoops and stripes respectively, while Kappa would also produce a striped kit in 2000–01. The Italian brand would provide a set of kits for the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons in which the shirt, shorts, and socks were all available in white and brown, meaning that the team would wear a different combination each game, reminiscent of the club&#x27;s look between the 1960s and 1980s. During the 2001–02 season, the team would frequently make recourse to the previous year&#x27;s all-black away kit.

In 2003–04, the club would once again sport a white shirt with brown sleeves, manufactured by Stanno. However this is, as of the 2022–23 season, the last time the club has donned its traditional kit. While the club&#x27;s uniform for the 2005–06 season would combine a light shirt and brown shorts, St. Pauli would wear an all-black kit during the following campaign (marking the first time that neither of the club&#x27;s colours were present on the home kit). From the 2007–08 season, St. Pauli has worn an all-brown home kit on all but three occasions, one of which saw the team return to a striped shirt, while in the two other instances the team wore white shorts.

Between 2019–20 and 2021–22, LGBT details were integrated into the third shirt. In 2020, having sought a kit supplier who would meet their ecological and ethical requirements since 2018, St. Pauli founded their own brand, Di!Y (&quot;Do it. Improve Yourself&quot;). From the 2021–22 season, St. Pauli have worn kits made in-house by Di!Y.

===Sponsors===

==Stadium==
The home venue of the FC St. Pauli is the Millerntor-Stadion. Work on the stadium began in 1961, but its completion was delayed until 1963 as there was initially no drainage system in place, making the pitch unplayable after rain. It originally held 32,000 supporters, but the capacity was later reduced for safety reasons.

In 1970, the stadium was renamed the Wilhelm Koch-Stadium in honour of a former club president. However, this name became highly controversial when it was discovered by historian René Martens that Wilhelm Koch had been a member of the Nazi Party from 1937 to 1945, as stated in his 1997 book &quot;FC St. Pauli - You&#x27;ll never walk alone&quot;. After protests by fans, the name was changed back to Millerntor-Stadion in 1999.

A total redevelopment began in 2006. The final phase of the redevelopment work ended with the completion of the new north stand in July 2015. The stadium is since then permitted for a capacity of 29,546 spectators of which 16,940 are standing and 12,606 are seated.

The stadium is located next to the Heiligengeistfeld, and is overlooked by the Flak Tower IV to the north and a building of the Deutsche Telekom to the south. It can be reached with the Hamburg U-Bahn line U3 (St. Pauli Station and Feldstraße Station).

==Supporters==
St. Pauli enjoys a certain fame for the left-leaning character of its supporters: most of the team&#x27;s fans regard themselves as anti-racist, anti-fascist, anti-homophobic and anti-sexist, and this has, on occasion, brought them into conflict with neo-Nazis and hooligans at away games. However, the fans are reportedly split on the Israel-Palestine conflict. The organization has adopted an outspoken stance against racism, fascism, sexism, and homophobia and has embodied this position in its constitution. Team supporters traditionally participate in demonstrations in the St. Pauli district of Hamburg, including those over squatting or low-income housing, such as the Hafenstraße and Bambule. The centre of fan activity is the &quot;Fanladen St. Pauli&quot;. St. Pauli has a supporters group in England, Yorkshire St. Pauli.

Partly because of shared leftist political views, St. Pauli fans have strong relationships with supporters of Bayern Munich (Schickeria), Werder Bremen, Ternana, Club Universidad Nacional, Unione Calcio Sampdoria, Rayo Vallecano, SV Babelsberg 03, Hapoel Tel Aviv, AEK Athens (Original 21), Olympique Marseille, Celtic, Venezia, Cosenza, Standard Liège and Clapton CFC In the past they also had a friendship with the fans of Bohemians 1905, Partizan Minsk and F.C. United of Manchester, the latter of whom were invited to the Millerntor for a friendly game to celebrate St. Pauli&#x27;s centenary. The group &quot;Ultrá Sankt Pauli&quot; also has a special friendship with the group &quot;Schickeria München&quot;, from the ultras scene of Bayern Munich. A banner of the Schickeria München is occasionally displayed at the Millerntor-Stadion, and a flag of the Ultrá Sankt Pauli – sporting a picture of Che Guevara – has been displayed at the Allianz Arena. Both Ultrá Sankt Pauli and Schickeria München are members of &quot;Alerta Network&quot;, an international anti-fascist network of supporter groups.

The club prides itself on having the largest number of female fans in all of German football. In 2002, advertisements for the men&#x27;s magazine &quot;Maxim&quot; were removed from the Millerntor-Stadion in response to fans&#x27; protests over the adverts&#x27; sexist depictions of women. In 2011, the club banned lap dancers from performing during match before guests at a corporate suite, following fans&#x27; complaints. The suite belonged to local lap dance club &quot;Susies Show Bar&quot;.

St. Pauli is also a worldwide symbol for punk and related subcultures. The skull and crossbones logo and the team&#x27;s brown and white football jerseys have often been worn by international artists such as the bands Asian Dub Foundation, Gaslight Anthem, Panteon Rococo and Molotov (band). The KMFDM frontman and Hamburg native Sascha Konietzko is a recognisable St. Pauli fan at one point placing a huge picture of a fist smashing a swastika on his band&#x27;s main page, with the caption &quot;St. Pauli Fans gegen Rechts!&quot; (&quot;St. Pauli fans against the Right&quot;) underneath it. American punk band Anti-Flag can be seen wearing St. Pauli shirts in numerous music videos for their album &quot;American Fall&quot;. Another notable supporter and sponsor is Andrew Eldritch, lead singer of band The Sisters of Mercy. On his 2006 &quot;Sisters Bite The Silver Bullet&quot;- tour, Eldritch wore the famous skull and crossbones shirt. Georg Holm, the bassist of the Icelandic post rock band Sigur Rós, has performed at several festivals wearing a St. Pauli shirt. Alex Rosamilia, the guitarist for The Gaslight Anthem, frequently wears a St. Pauli hat and hoodie and displays a flag of the club&#x27;s logo in front of the speakers of his guitar amp. Editors guitarist and synthesiser player Chris Urbanowicz frequently wears the skull and crossbones t-shirt. Dave Doughman, the singer for Dayton, Ohio&#x27;s Swearing at Motorists, who has been spotted in concert with the skull and crossbones on his guitar and amplifier, moved to St. Pauli in 2010. Bad Religion played a charity match against St. Pauli&#x27;s third team in 2000. German musicians who are fans include: Fettes Brot, Die Ärzte singer/drummer/songwriter Bela B., Kettcar, Tomte, and many other bands, most of them underground.
Several bands have also made music directly related to St. Pauli: The Norwegian punk rock band Turbonegro recorded a special version of their song &quot;I Got Erection&quot; with re-worked German lyrics for St. Pauli. In 2009, Italian ska combat-folk punk band Talco from Marghera, Venice, wrote the song &quot;St. Pauli&quot;. The team has since used the song as an anthem and Talco has played a number of concerts at Millerntor-Stadion. Glasgow band The Wakes have also played the Millerntor, having written &quot;The Pirates of the League&quot; about the club. Also, British band Art Brut has written a song about the club called &quot;St Pauli&quot; which is featured on their album &quot;It&#x27;s a Bit Complicated&quot;. In 2010, FC St. Pauli celebrated its 100th anniversary. For the occasion, the fan club 18auf12 recorded the song &quot;Happy Birthday St Pauli, One Hundred Beers for You&quot;, with words and music by Henning Knorr and Christoph Brüx.

The Canadian punk rock band The Pagans of Northumberland recorded a song in 2014 called simply &quot;St Pauli&quot; for their first 7-inch detailing their love of the club and its supporters around the world.

In January 2017, FC St. Pauli announced an extensive co-operation with Irish-American Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys. The co-operation includes a strictly limited seven-inch picture disc of the song &quot;You’ll Never Walk Alone&quot; recorded by the band, and new club merchandise labeled &quot;You’ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, sporting both the club and the band.

When the team played in Germany&#x27;s 2. Bundesliga, their home fixtures at the Millerntor used to average greater attendances than any other team and often exceeded turnouts for second division teams. As of the 2011–12 season, St. Pauli was the only team that has close to 100% in average home attendance.

In 2006, St. Pauli had more season ticket holders than many Bundesliga teams. One study estimated that the team had roughly 11 million fans throughout Germany, making the club one of the most widely recognised German sides. The number of official fan clubs in 2011 passed 500, which was an increase of 300 over three years.

In January 2020, the club&#x27;s skull and crossbones flag was listed by the United Kingdom&#x27;s counter-terrorism police in a guide sent to public sector workers, to notice potential extremism, prompting a backlash from St. Pauli&#x27;s Welsh defender James Lawrence.

==Club culture==
St. Pauli opens its home matches with &quot;Hells Bells&quot; by AC/DC, and after every home goal &quot;Song 2&quot; by Blur is played.

The former club president Corny Littmann, long active in German theatre and head of the Schmidt Theater on the Reeperbahn, is openly gay.

St. Pauli have made pre-season appearances at Wacken Open Air, a heavy metal festival, several times.

The club hosted the 2006 FIFI Wild Cup, a tournament made up of unrecognised national football teams like Greenland, Tibet and Zanzibar. They participated as the &quot;Republic of St Pauli&quot;.

In 2008, Nike commemorated the club with two exclusive Dunk shoes, both released in limited quantities. The High Dunk (featuring a black , and the skull and crossbones symbol) was released to all countries throughout Europe, with only 500 pairs produced. The Low Dunk (featuring a smooth white colorway, and holding the team&#x27;s logo impregnated in the side panel leather) was released only to shops in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, with only 150 pairs produced.

==Fundamental Principles==
St. Pauli were the first club in Germany to integrate a set of Fundamental Principles (Leitlinien) to dictate how the club is run, passed by an overwhelming majority at the club&#x27;s annual general meeting in 2009.

The first five Principles states that:

– &quot;In its totality, consisting of members, staff, fans and honorary officers, St Pauli FC is a part of the society by which it is surrounded and so is affected both directly and indirectly by social changes in the political, cultural and social spheres.&quot;

– &quot;St Pauli FC is conscious of the social responsibility this implies, and represents the interests of its members, staff, fans and honorary officers in matters not just restricted to the sphere of sport.&quot;

– &quot;St Pauli FC is the club of a particular city district, and it is to this that it owes its identity. This gives it a social and political responsibility in relation to the district and the people who live there.&quot;

– &quot;St Pauli FC aims to put across a certain feeling for life and symbolises sporting authenticity. This makes it possible for people to identify with the club independently of any sporting successes it may achieve. Essential features of the club that encourage this sense of identification are to be honoured, promoted and preserved.&quot;

– &quot;Tolerance and respect in mutual human relations are important pillars of the St Pauli philosophy.&quot;

<doc id="881245" wikidata="Q7097172" url="?curid=881245" title="Operation Iron Hammer (Iraq 2003)">
<text>Operation Iron Hammer was a joint operation between the US Army, US Air Force and Iraqi Civil Defense Corps with the objective of preventing the staging of weapons by anti-coalition forces, and preemptively destroy enemy operating bases and fighters in Baghdad.

==Launch==
The operation was launched on the night of 12 November 2003 by elements of the US Army&#x27;s 1st Armored Division who performed cordon-and-search actions in several Baghdad neighborhoods. The operation&#x27;s first salvo came when 1st Armored Division soldiers saw mortar rounds being fired from a van and gave chase, noting stops it made. An AH-64 Apache helicopter followed the van and attacked it, killing two suspected anti-coalition fighters and wounding three others. Five others were captured. Soldiers found an 82 mm mortar launch tube at one of the van&#x27;s stops.

==Strikes==
In Operation Iron Hammer the military began preemptively destroying buildings suspected to be bases of operations for anti-coalition forces. The buildings included the former Republican Guard building, in the western part of the capital near Baghdad International Airport, and a warehouse in southern Baghdad. Both buildings had been used to conduct attacks on U.S. troops and were destroyed by AC-130 Spectre gunships and M2 Bradley fighting vehicles. U.S. forces also fired artillery rounds at two suspected mortar and rocket launch sites, one in western Baghdad and one in eastern Baghdad.

==Conclusion==

<text>Eat Drink Man Woman () is a 1994 comedy-drama film directed by Ang Lee, from a script co-written with James Schamus and Hui-Ling Wang. It stars Sihung Lung, Wang Yu-wen, Wu Chien-lien, and Yang Kuei-mei as members of the Zhu family navigating the challenges of love, life, tradition and family. Part of Lee&#x27;s &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; trilogy and similar to Lee&#x27;s other works, this film deals with the transition from tradition to modernity. It is Lee&#x27;s only film, to date, to be shot entirely in his native Taiwan.

The film premiered in Taiwan on July 2, 1994, and it was both a critical and box office success. It received several accolades including an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. It was also nominated for both a Golden Globe and BAFTA Award, as well as three Golden Horse Awards and six Independent Spirit Awards. It would inspire films like &quot;Tortilla Soup&quot; and &quot;Joyful Reunion&quot; and has an eponymous musical rendition. A BBC Culture poll of film critics ranked the film at number 54 of the 100 Greatest Non-English Language Films.

The title is a quote from the &quot;Book of Rites&quot;, one of the Confucian classics, referring to the basic human desires and accepting them as natural. The beginning of the quote reads as follows: “The things which men greatly desire are comprehended in food and drink and sexual pleasure.”

==Plot==
On a Sunday evening in Taipei, semi-retired chef and widower Zhu prepares a feast for his three daughters. Jia-Jen, the eldest, is a chemistry teacher who devotes herself to Christianity after facing heartbreak from her college ex-boyfriend. The second daughter, Jia-Chien, is an executive at an airline company. She wanted to become a head chef like her father but he claimed that it was not for a woman. Jia-Ning, the youngest, is a college student who works part-time at a Wendy&#x27;s fast food restaurant.

At dinner, Jia-Chien announces that she has invested in a new apartment and will be moving out once construction is complete. Surprisingly, Mr. Zhu approves. Jia-Chien criticizes the flavor, claiming Mr. Zhu&#x27;s taste is deteriorating. Mr. Zhu dismisses the idea before suddenly rushing off to help his (and Jia-Chien&#x27;s) long-time friend and &quot;taster&quot;, Old Wen, at a banquet. Afterwards, Mr. Zhu wonders with Old Wen if there is anything more to life than eating, drinking, man, and woman. Meanwhile, family friend Jin-Rong stops by the Zhu residence with her daughter Shan-Shan. Jin-Rong vocalizes her difficulties with a messy divorce while being responsible for work, Shan-Shan, and her opinionated mother, Madame Liang, as she returns to Taipei from America. Jia-Jen comforts her while Shan-Shan colors a caricature of Mr. Zhu.

The next morning, Mr. Zhu meets Shan-Shan, learns that the lunches Jin-Rong provides her are suboptimal, and decides to cook for her. Shan-Shan agrees, letting Mr. Zhu eat the lunches her mom made to prevent her from discovering their secret. At school, Jia-Jen meets the new volleyball coach Ming-Dao and they take interest in one another. Jia-Chien meets the chief negotiator Li Kai during a meeting at work and they flirt with one another. She has a chance to relocate to Amsterdam due to a potential promotion. Jia-Ning meets up with Guo-Lun, her friend Rachel&#x27;s on-and-off boyfriend. As Guo-Lun mopes about his unrequited love, Jia-Ning comforts him, telling him that true love is being with someone he can express his feelings to comfortably, leading Guo-Lun to realize his love for Jia-Ning.

Meanwhile, Old Wen becomes hospitalized. Jia-Jen is fooled by love letters she believes are from Ming-Dao, falling for a prank by her students. Jia-Chien&#x27;s apartment investment falls through as she discovers that the apartment company went bankrupt and ran away with her savings. She also learns that it was Li Kai who broke Jia-Jen&#x27;s heart in college and confronts him about it. Li Kai says he never dated Jia-Jen. Jia-Ning faces a dilemma when she begins dating Guo-Lun even after Rachel confesses that she loves him. Mr. Zhu&#x27;s health deteriorates and secretly visits the hospital, unaware that Jia-Chien saw him while visiting Old Wen. Eventually, Old Wen passes away and Mr. Zhu concludes that his sense of taste has officially departed.

At another Sunday feast, Jia-Chien announces that she will no longer be moving out; Mr. Zhu tells her not to worry. Later, Jia-Ning reveals her relationship with Guo-Lun and her pregnancy. The next dinner, Jia-Jen divulges that she and Ming-Dao have eloped. Jia-Jen and Jia-Ning move out of the residence, leaving Mr. Zhu with Jia-Chien. Troubled, Mr. Zhu begins to confide in and meet Madame Liang, leading the daughters to believe that the two are romantically involved.

Worried about her father&#x27;s health, Jia-Chien rejects her promotion. Soon, the sisters, their partners, and Jin-Rong&#x27;s family gather for a large Sunday feast. Mr. Zhu announces his engagement, not to Madame Liang, but to Jin-Rong, also revealing that his visit to the hospital was to show good health to gain Madame Liang&#x27;s blessing. Madame Liang goes into shock, abruptly ending the dinner. Later, Jia-Ning and Guo-Lun have their baby, Jia-Jen converts Ming-Dao to Christianity, and Mr. Zhu sells the family home and buys a condo with Jin-Rong and Shan-Shan. Jia-Chien, no longer needing to take care of her father, accepts the job in Amsterdam. Before she leaves she prepares a final feast for the family in the family home, but only Mr. Zhu arrives. When Mr. Zhu tastes her cooking he suddenly realizes that his sense of taste has returned. The two hold each other’s hands in the dining room, and call each other “Father” and “Daughter”.

==Cast==

* Lung Sihung as Zhu (), an aging master Chinese chef who works at Grand Hotel in Taipei and the widower father of three adult daughters.
* Yang Kuei-mei as Zhu Jia-Jen (), the eldest daughter, who works as a high school chemistry teacher. Jia-Chien believes that Li Kai broke the heart of her older sister Jia-Jen, and Dariotis and Fung wrote that the event seems to have caused Jia-Jen to turn away from the world. Later in film it is revealed that Jia-Jen fabricated the story, in order to &quot;create a barrier against intimacy—even with her family&quot; according to Dariotis and Fung. Ultimately she marries a new boyfriend after being abstinent for nine years. Her family members seem puzzled when they realize he is not a Christian but Jia-Jen says &quot;He will be.&quot;
* Wu Chien-lien as Zhu Jia-Chien (), the second daughter, an executive at an airline company. Unlike her elder sister, Jia-Chien is sexually liberated, and suspects she disapproves of her moral system.
**Chien-lien Wu, who plays Jia-Chien, also portrays Mr. Chu&#x27;s dead wife. Lizzie Francke wrote that Jia-Chien taking the role of the cook &quot;makes manifest the various needs that bind a family by setting a mother back at the heart of it&quot;. Dariotis and Fung wrote that therefore the phrase from Francke has multiple meanings since Jia-Chien takes her father&#x27;s role of being a chef and therefore &quot;is trying to be the son her father never had&quot; and she takes the role of the mother.
* Wang Yu-wen as Zhu Jia-Ning (), the youngest daughter, who works at Wendy’s fast food restaurant. She becomes involved with an on-and-off boyfriend of her friend Rachel and gets into a love triangle.
* Winston Chao as Li Kai (), Jia-Chien’s co-worker and love interest. She believes Li Kai broke the heart of her older sister Jia-Jen, and Dariotis and Fung wrote that the event seems to have caused Jia-Jen to turn away from the world. Later in film it is revealed that Jia-Jen fabricated the story, in order to &quot;create a barrier against intimacy—even with her family&quot; according to Dariotis and Fung.
* Sylvia Chang as Liang Jin-Rong (), a single mother and neighbour of Chu’s, going through a messy divorce.
* Gua Ah-leh as Madame Liang (), Jin-Rong’s mother who’s recently moved back to Taiwan from the United States.
* Chen Chao-jung as Guo Lun (), Rachel’s ex-boyfriend and eventually Jia-Ning’s love interest.
* Lu Chin-cheng as Ming-Dao, the high school volleyball coach whom Jia-Jen falls in love with.
* Lester Chit-Man Chan as Raymond (), Jia-Chien’s ex-boyfriend.
* Yu Chen () as Rachel (), Jia-Ning’s friend and co-worker.
* Tang Yu-Chien () as Shan-Shan (), Jin-Rong’s six-year old daughter.
* Wang Jui as Old Wen (), Chu’s longtime friend and fellow chef.
* Hsu Gin-Ming as Coach Chai
* Lin Huel-Yi as Sister Chang
== Themes ==
Wei Ming Dariotis and Eileen Fung, authors of &quot;Breaking the Soy Sauce Jar: Diaspora and Displacement in the Films of Ang Lee&quot;, wrote that Jia-Jen&#x27;s story is that of a &quot;spinster turned sensual woman&quot;. They wrote that her Christianity was there &quot;perhaps to match her role as a mother-figure&quot;. She suspects Jia-Chien of disapproving of her moral system. Dariotis and Fung wrote that after Jia-Chien states that she needs not a mother but sister, Jia-Jen &quot;is able to become who she really is with all the complexity that entails&quot; rather than being someone she believed her family needed, with &quot;who she really is&quot; being &quot;a modern, conservative, Christian, sexually aggressive Taiwanese woman&quot;. Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that of the actresses, Yang was the &quot;most memorable&quot;.

Dariotis and Fung wrote that Jia-Ning&#x27;s story is of &quot;naïveté and immature love&quot; and that the love triangle involving her, Guo Lun, and Rachel &quot;is in many ways a parody of comic book romance.&quot; Dariotis and Fung argue that Jia-Ning&#x27;s story, along with Jia-Jen&#x27;s, is &quot;not only flat but also dangerously uncomplicated.&quot; They further state that &quot;[t]he lack of inquiry is endemic of this storyline&quot; and that its &quot;superficial treatment&quot; is &quot;quite disturbing.&quot;

“Due to love and traditional matters, they have to obey, they have to care well. They’re not really level with each other. I think that’s the biggest problem in that family, so the food and that banquet in the movie has become a ritual,” said Ang Lee. The banquet becomes a burden on the family.

The authors Hong Zhao and Haixin Jin argue in their article &quot;破坏中的重建与传承——《饮食男女》解读&quot; that in the film &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot;, Zhu’s family first maintains a semblance of calm when everyone represses their desires, then, the family is destructed when members throw off the shackles of their family roles to pursue their own desires. The family structure is eventually reconstructed when everyone’s desire for eat, drink and sex is well balanced. At the beginning of the film, Zhu’s family struggles between maintaining the banquet (eat and drink) and their sexual desire (man and woman). Food is the bond that holds the family together. However, though they dine together every week, they are afraid to confide in each other. When they focus on “eat drink” but suppress sexual desire, the family is unhappy. No one enjoys the meal and Zhu even loses his sense of taste. When Zhu, Jia Jen, and Jia Ning chase after their sexual desires (man and woman), the original family structure disintegrates, but the family becomes happier since everyone gets what they want. The desire for food and sex eventually reach a balance and Zhu’s sense of taste is back at this moment.

Each character in this film has their own desire but at the beginning of the film, due to the concern with their family roles, they cannot express themselves.

== Production ==
&quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot; was filmed on-location in director Ang Lee&#x27;s hometown Taipei. As of 2022, it is Lee&#x27;s only film to be shot entirely in Taiwan.

The opening sequence - in which a Sunday lunch is lovingly prepared - took over a week to film and was accomplished with the use of an actual master chef, who doubled for actor Sihung Lung.

== Music ==
The musical score was composed by French musician Thierry Schollhammer, credited under the mononym &quot;Mader&quot;, and arranged by Sarah Plant. The soundtrack was released by Varèse Sarabande.

=== Track listing ===

Included in the film but not on the soundtrack, are several Mandopop tracks and classical excerpts from &quot;Israel in Egypt&quot;, &quot;All Creatures of Our God and King&quot;, and &quot;Quattro pezzi sacri.&quot;

==Reception==

=== Box office ===
The film grossed $24.2 million worldwide generating the third biggest percentage return on cost of films released in the year, behind &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; and &quot;The Lion King&quot;. It was the highest-grossing foreign-language film in the United States and Canada for the year with a gross of $7.3 million.

===Critical response===
In her review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin praised Ang Lee as &quot;a warmly engaging storyteller&quot;. She wrote, &quot;Wonderfully seductive, and nicely knowing about all of its characters&#x27; appetites, &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot; makes for an uncomplicatedly pleasant experience&quot;.

In his review in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Hal Hinson called the film a &quot;beautiful balance of elements ... mellow, harmonious and poignantly funny&quot;. Hinson concluded:
According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 91% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A richly layered look at the complex interactions between a widowed chef and his daughters, Ang Lee&#x27;s generational comedy &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot; offers filmgoers a tasty cinematic treat.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
== Legacy ==
&quot;Tortilla Soup&quot;, a 2001 American comedy-drama film directed by Maria Ripoll, is based on &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot;. A semi-sequel, &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman 2012&quot; [饮食男女2012] (billed as &quot;Joyful Reunion&quot; in English) was released, with Jui-Yuan Tsao, producer for the original film, serving as director, and a new set of characters exploring similar themes.

The film was adapted off-screen as well. In 2019, produced by PerfectMatch Theatre co., LTD, the National Kaohsiung Centre for the Arts put on a musical production titled, &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman: The Musical&quot;. The musical is a direct adaptation of the film. With a total runtime of 160 minutes, the production strived to showcase as many iconic aspects from Ang Lee&#x27;s film, such as the character&#x27;s unique qualities and the beauty of food, through song and dance as possible. Unfortunately, the musical only ran for a recorded three days in September 2019; the production had a total of one night showing and two matinees.

== Father Knows Best trilogy ==
&quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot; is Ang Lee’s third feature film and forms the final part of his ‘Father Knows Best’ Trilogy, following &quot;Pushing Hands&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; (1993). All three films depict a clash between cultures like youth and old age, tradition and progress, east and west, and investigate the freedoms and constraints inherent in family structures particularly those between fathers, daughters and sons. Si-hung Lung takes the place of a father in all three films - here as Mr. Zhu, a retired master chef - and He had used it as the motif (idealization of the household&#x27;s head) to resolve all the contradictions and conflict that happened within the family members. The trilogy also takes the repression of individual desire in the face of social pressure as one of its central themes.

<text>The Bombardier Global Express is a large cabin, long-range business jet designed and manufactured by Bombardier Aviation.

Announced in October 1991, it first flew in October 1996, received its Canadian type certification in July 1998 and entered service in July 1999.

Initially powered by two BMW/Rolls-Royce BR710s, it shares its fuselage cross section with the Canadair Regional Jet and Challenger 600 with a new wing and tail.
The shorter range Global 5000 is slightly smaller. The XRS is an improved version of the Global Express and the Global 6000 is an upgrade to the XRS that replaces the older avionics. The longer range Global 5500/6500 are powered by new Rolls-Royce Pearl engines with lower fuel burn and were unveiled in May 2018.

The larger and stretched Global 7500/8000 have longer ranges.

==Development==
===Project definition===
After acquiring Canadair along with its Challenger 600 business jet in 1986, Bombardier studied a longer range business aircraft in which it aimed to carry eight passengers and four crew over 12,000 km (6,500 nmi) at Mach 0.85. To meet this goal, a joint-definition team was established at the company&#x27;s Montreal facility in the early 1990s. By 1994, the team comprised 200 engineers, evenly divided between Canadair and various partners, including Japanese company Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Anglo-German engine manufacturer BMW Rolls-Royce.

These partners independently designed their own elements of the aircraft and shared a stake in the program. The choice of suppliers influenced the aircraft design, with its various systems being selected before the detailed design phase. The CATIA software was used for the kinematics, to feed finite-element analysis software for structural design, and computational fluid dynamics software for aerodynamics, the latter being confirmed by wind tunnel testing.

The new aircraft was designed to use the minimum number of components while still ensuring that no single failure would result in a diversion or the inability to dispatch a flight. Bombardier worked towards a 99.5% dispatch reliability goal. As operators sought a level of safety enjoyed by airline aircraft, Bombardier was influenced to use design rules, such as the incorporation of a maintenance computer to detect, indicate, and isolate faults, although ETOPS rules were not a design requirement. A conventional mechanical flight control system was selected in the new aircraft design instead of fly-by-wire. This was mainly due to the high development expense and customer apprehension of fly-by-wire.

===Launch and flight testing===
In October 1991, the Global Express was unveiled at the convention. In December 1993, the programme was launched. In June 1994, its high-speed configuration was frozen while the low-speed configuration was established in August 1994. By then, most critical design decisions were taken and almost all suppliers had been selected. In January 1995, the definition phase was winding down before detailed design.

By June 1995, the backlog was over 40 aircraft, sold out until 2000, leading to Bombardier to expand its early production plans. At launch, range was extended to to outdo rival Gulfstream. Bombardier guaranteed the empty weight and range to reply to Gulfstream criticism. Around 100 sales were needed to cover the development costs. In October 1995, the first prototype manufacture began. The first sections were expected in December at de Havilland&#x27;s in Toronto, with final assembly to start in March 1996. By June 1996, the prototype was complete and conducting flight-readiness reviews ahead of its roll-out and first flight.

On 13 October 1996, the first prototype performed its maiden flight from Toronto, one month later than planned, lasting for 2 hours 46 minutes and attaining 11,000 ft (3,350 m) and 210 kn (390 km/h). The flight test programme used four prototypes, accumulating 2,200 flight hours. The Bombardier Flight Test Center in Wichita, Kansas was extended by 9,100 m2 (100,000 ft2) for the test programme. In February 1997, the second prototype made its first flight and the third in May 1997.

In late 1995, type certification was forecast for March 1998. In July 1998, Canadian type certification was granted. European and US approvals followed shortly thereafter. The first 15 aircraft were to be delivered before January 1999. The Global Express entered service in July 1999.

===Production===
Since 2023, the Global Express has been assembled at the Toronto Pearson International Airport in Mississauga, Ontario, and formerly at Downsview Airport in Toronto.
Since 2012, Japanese aerospace firm Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has built the wing and centre fuselage sections at its Toronto facility located east of the airport on Northwest Drive, and formerly at 2025 Meadowvale Boulevard from 2007 to 2012. Bombardier subsidiaries involved are Canadair as the design leader and nose manufacturer; Short Brothers in Belfast for the engine nacelles design and manufacture, horizontal stabiliser and forward fuselage; and de Havilland Canada for the rear fuselage, vertical tail and final assembly. The landing gear is produced by Dowty, flight controls by Sextant Avionique, the fuel system by Parker Bertea Aerospace, the core avionics by Honeywell, the APU by AlliedSignal, the electrical system by Lucas Aerospace, and the air management system by ABG-Semca.

In May 2015, production was reduced because of lower demand, caused by slowing economy and geopolitics in Latin America, Russia and China markets. By October 2018, Bombardier had a backlog of 202 aircraft valued at C$14.1 billion ($11 billion), including 128 Global Express aircraft: 67 Global 5000/6000 and four Global 5500/6500.
The Global Express program cost $800 million.

==Design==
The Global Express is a high speed business/corporate aircraft with a range of at , a service ceiling and a 14 hours endurance.
The semi monocoque airframe is made of lightweight aluminum alloys and composite materials. 
It has a low wing, tricycle landing gear and fuselage-mounted engines.

The clean-sheet design draws upon the earlier Canadair CL-600 and Bombardier CRJ.
It shares its fuselage cross-section with these aircraft, paired with a new T-tail and wing.
The latter is a supercritical airfoil with a 35° wing sweep and winglets.
This flexible wing naturally attenuates turbulence.
It was initially powered by two BMW-Rolls-Royce BR710 turbofans controlled by FADEC.
The flightdeck features a six screen Honeywell Primus 2000XP EFIS suite.

The Global Express was the business jet with the largest cabin, until being surpassed by the later Gulfstream G650.
It can accommodate 12 to 16 passengers in three cabin sections: mostly a forward four-chair club section, a central four-seat conference grouping and an aft three-place divan facing two chairs.
Most have a forward galley, crew rest chair and crew lavatory.
The 10.3-psi cabin pressurization maintains a 4,500-ft. cabin altitude up to FL 450 and 5,680 ft. at the FL 510 ceiling.
The cabin has an unobstructed length of while the floor is dropped by from the Challenger to increase width at shoulder level, while the windows have been repositioned and enlarged by 25%.

==Variants==

===Global 5000===

The Global 5000 was announced in October 2001. It was launched in February 2002, with letters of intent for 15 aircraft with a MTOW, and a range at Mach 0.85.
The first aircraft flew on 7 March 2003.
It was introduced in April 2005. There were 224 in service in 2018.
In April 2008, Bombardier lifted its MTOW to to increase its Mach 0.85 range to .
Its cabin is shorter than the Global 6000 with a lower MTOW depending on service bulletins. It has a range at .
The spec basic operating weight is but are actually closer to .
Early models kept the Honeywell Primus 2000XP avionics, updated with the Bombardier Vision flight deck based on the Rockwell Collins Pro Line Fusion avionics since 2012.

It can carry between 8 and 19 passengers. The new seat converts to a full berth. There is an optional private room aft and the galley has room to prepare 16 five-course meals.
It was priced at $40M in 2008. It has forward and aft lavatories. The crew rest area was removed, but could be restored.
The tail fuel tank was removed and fuel is limited in the wings. Some avionics are rearranged to gain usable cabin length. The interior completions allowance is 3,200 kg.

In 2018, its unit cost was US$50.44 million.

At high-speed cruise, it burns of fuel in the first hour, then the second hour and for the third hour.
In 2018, Early models with Honeywell avionics were sold for $10–20 million, while post-2012 aircraft with the modern Cockpit can fetch $22–36 million.
A major inspection every 180 months cost $800,000-1.2 million. Two 8,000h engine overhauls can cost $4 million.
The cheaper and more efficient Gulfstream G450 or Falcon 900LX are slower, have less range and smaller cabins.

===Global Express XRS===
The improved Global Express XRS was announced on 6 October 2003 during the NBAA Convention at Orlando, Florida. It replaced the original Global Express and provides greater range at high speed, cabin upgrades, improved takeoff performance, fast fueling capability and the Bombardier Enhanced Vision System (BEVS) as standard equipment. A new forward fuel tank in the wing/body fairing increases the usable fuel capacity by up to 1,486 lbs, allowing it to fly 6,500 nm at Mach 0.82, 6,150 nm at Mach 0.85 or 5,450 nm at Mach 0.87. It provides improved pressurization with a 4,500 ft cabin altitude at 45,000 ft and a 5,700 ft cabin altitude at 51,000 ft; a 25% improvement on the previous Global cabin.

===Global 6000===
Bombardier rebranded the Global Express XRS and upgraded the avionics from the Honeywell Primus 2000XP to the new Bombarder Vision flight deck, based on the Rockwell Collins Pro Line Fusion avionics suite, to create the Global 6000. The Global 6000 was announced in 2011 and production started in 2012.
Its flexible wing and wing loading, the highest among its competitors, gives a comfortable ride in turbulence. It has improved acoustical insulation compared to its predecessor.
On long trips, its fuel burn is in the first hour, in the second hour, in the third hour and for every subsequent hour.
A Checks are scheduled every 750 hours, and for C Checks every 30 months. Engine reserves amount to $260 per hour.
Over 315 were delivered by March 2019. Its competitors include the more fuel-efficient Dassault Falcon 8X, the Gulfstream G600 or even the G650.

In 2018, its unit cost was US$62.31 million.

===Global 5500/6500===

In May 2018, Bombardier unveiled the Global 5500 and 6500. It was expected to enter service at the end of 2019. It has an optimized wing for a Mach 0.90 top speed, a revamped cabin inspired by the Global 7500 with its &quot;Nuage&quot; seat and updated Rolls-Royce BR710 Pearl engines with up to 13% lower fuel burn for better operating costs. It has better hot and high performance and of additional range for , respectively.
The engines have 9% more thrust.

By October 2018, 70% of the flight testing hours were completed.
The programme involved two flight-test Global 6500s, as the 5500 is a simple shrink.
The redesigned wings are built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
By December, the flight-test program was nearly three-quarters complete.
By May 2019, 90% of the flight testing was completed by two modified 6000s and one modified 5000.

In September 2019, Bombardier announced the Transport Canada Type Certification of both models, before entry-into-service later in 2019 and FAA/EASA approval.
Bombardier announced the Global 6500 entry-into-service on 1 October.
EASA Type Certification of both models was announced in October 2019.
Shortly after, the Global 5500 range was extended by to at Mach 0.85.

FAA Type Certification of both variants was announced in December 2019.
Bombardier announced the entry-into-service of the Global 5500 in June 2020. The first Global 5500 was delivered in July 2020, to &quot; longtime Bombardier customer Unicorp National Developments, headquartered in Orlando, Florida.&quot;

In 2023, the Global 5500 costs $47.4 million, while the Global 6500 costs $58 million.

<doc id="881269" wikidata="Q3997523" url="?curid=881269" title="Rotational transition">
<text>In quantum mechanics, a rotational transition is an abrupt change in angular momentum. Like all other properties of a quantum particle, angular momentum is quantized, meaning it can only equal certain discrete values, which correspond to different rotational energy states. When a particle loses angular momentum, it is said to have transitioned to a lower rotational energy state. Likewise, when a particle gains angular momentum, a positive rotational transition is said to have occurred.

Rotational transitions are important in physics due to the unique spectral lines that result. Because there is a net gain or loss of energy during a transition, electromagnetic radiation of a particular frequency must be absorbed or emitted. This forms spectral lines at that frequency which can be detected with a spectrometer, as in rotational spectroscopy or Raman spectroscopy.

== Diatomic molecules ==
Molecules have rotational energy owing to rotational motion of the nuclei about their center of mass. Due to quantization, these energies can take only certain discrete values. Rotational transition thus corresponds to transition of the molecule from one rotational energy level to the other through gain or loss of a photon. Analysis is simple in the case of diatomic molecules.

=== Nuclear wave function ===
Quantum theoretical analysis of a molecule is simplified by use of Born–Oppenheimer approximation. Typically, rotational energies of molecules are smaller than electronic transition energies by a factor of ≈ 10−3–10−5, where is electronic mass and is typical nuclear mass. From uncertainty principle, period of motion is of the order of the Planck constant divided by its energy. Hence nuclear rotational periods are much longer than the electronic periods. So electronic and nuclear motions can be treated separately. In the simple case of a diatomic molecule, the radial part of the Schrödinger Equation for a nuclear wave function , in an electronic state , is written as (neglecting spin interactions)
formula_1
where is reduced mass of two nuclei, is vector joining the two nuclei, is energy eigenvalue of electronic wave function representing electronic state and is orbital momentum operator for the relative motion of the two nuclei given by
formula_2
The total wave function for the molecule is
formula_3
where are position vectors from center of mass of molecule to th electron.
As a consequence of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the electronic wave functions is considered to vary very slowly with . Thus the Schrödinger equation for an electronic wave function is first solved to obtain for different values of . then plays role of a potential well in analysis of nuclear wave functions .

=== Rotational energy levels ===
The first term in the above nuclear wave function equation corresponds to kinetic energy of nuclei due to their radial motion. Term represents rotational kinetic energy of the two nuclei, about their center of mass, in a given electronic state . Possible values of the same are different rotational energy levels for the molecule.

Orbital angular momentum for the rotational motion of nuclei can be written as
formula_4
where is the total orbital angular momentum of the whole molecule and is the orbital angular momentum of the electrons.
If internuclear vector is taken along z-axis, component of along z-axis – – becomes zero as
formula_5
Hence
formula_6
Since molecular wave function Ψs is a simultaneous eigenfunction of and ,
formula_7
where J is called rotational quantum number and can be a positive integer or zero.
formula_8
where .

Also since electronic wave function is an eigenfunction of ,
formula_9
Hence molecular wave function is also an eigenfunction of with eigenvalue .
Since and are equal, is an eigenfunction of with same eigenvalue . As , we have . So possible values of rotational quantum number are
formula_10
Thus molecular wave function is simultaneous eigenfunction of , and .
Since molecule is in eigenstate of , expectation value of components perpendicular to the direction of z-axis (internuclear line) is zero. Hence
formula_11
and
formula_12
Thus
formula_13

Putting all these results together,
formula_14

The Schrödinger equation for the nuclear wave function can now be rewritten as
formula_15
where
formula_16
E′s now serves as effective potential in radial nuclear wave function equation.

==== Sigma states ====
Molecular states in which the total orbital momentum of electrons is zero are called sigma states. In sigma states . Thus . As nuclear motion for a stable molecule is generally confined to a small interval around where corresponds to internuclear distance for minimum value of potential , rotational energies are given by,
formula_17
with
formula_10
 is moment of inertia of the molecule corresponding to equilibrium distance and is called rotational constant for a given electronic state .
Since reduced mass is much greater than electronic mass, last two terms in the expression of are small compared to . Hence even for states other than sigma states, rotational energy is approximately given by above expression.

=== Rotational spectrum ===

When a rotational transition occurs, there is a change in the value of rotational quantum number . Selection rules for rotational transition are,
when , and
when , as absorbed or emitted photon can make equal and opposite change in total nuclear angular momentum and total electronic angular momentum without changing value of .

The pure rotational spectrum of a diatomic molecule consists of lines in the far infrared or microwave region. The frequency of these lines is given by
formula_19
Thus values of , and of a substance can be determined from observed rotational spectrum.
